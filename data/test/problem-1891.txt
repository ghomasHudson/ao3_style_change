It’s a strange realisation to come to– the knowledge that one is dead. It’s less something he feels and more something he… doesn’t. Since the last time his eyes had been open, something within him has simply stopped.
“You little bastard,” she says, aiming a slew of rapid French at Draco. He can’t make out what she’s saying, whether she’s berating him for being an idiot or for not telling her or potentially for both.
It makes him sick, as though he’s hollow. As though a piece of him is missing and has left a gaping hole in its wake.
Two days after Potter’s visit (which he still can’t trust himself to classify as illusion or reality- which is unfortunate given that he sent Granger a letter of appreciation already), Draco receives an owl. It’s a Ministry owl which shoots him frequent disapproving glares and reminds Draco uncomfortably of great-aunt Alexandra. He hands it a couple treats and with one last look laced with disgust, it takes the treat, hoots loudly enough to startle Draco and disappears before he has had time to open the envelope and read the contents, forget composing a reply.
He smushes his face into his pillow and groans, furious and more than a little hurt. It’s been almost two months of their functional relationship, and the fact that Malfoy has chosen now to be a brat feels a little like deception to Harry.
Harry knows Draco loves it from the moment they step into the clearing when Draco’s mouth falls open at the beauty of the little house covered in creeping tendrils of flowering ivy. There are butterflies here and they sit on everything, including Draco’s nose which both startles and delights him. Harry’s heart clenches at the open joy on Draco’s face.
He doesn’t know why Potter is here. Dench didn’t know either. When Draco asked, Dench told him in no uncertain terms that if he was going to look a gift horse in the mouth and ask it to trot off, Dench would ride it and trot off too.
Harry’s eyes are wide, and green, so green. Greener than the lights Draco sees flashing behind his eyes every time Harry pushes into him, every time Harry’s lips touch his. So green, and blown wide.
All of a sudden Draco’s behaviour almost the entirety of the past week becomes crystal clear and Harry almost wishes Draco had kept the information to himself. He can feel the blood rushing to his face, violating the protection from embarrassment his dark skin offers, turning him flushed and red. It’s too hot and Draco is still touching him and Harry would tremble if he didn’t think it would make him lose control over himself entirely. So he reins in every reaction and reflex he can and holds himself steady as he meets Draco’s eyes.
Harry seems to know this because whatever he does, he doesn’t even touch Draco’s dick. Instead he keeps licking around his arsehole, sometimes with firm hard strokes and sometimes with languid ones with the flat of his tongue.
“Now, if you’re good at what you do, when you fuck, you get the added pleasure of getting to watch.” He bites down, gently, almost lovingly and Draco has a feeling that by the end of today he is going to die. “You get to watch the way their eyes shutter closed, the way their mouth falls open, the way they,” he slides his hand down Draco’s stomach till he reaches the navel and strokes Draco across it with teasing, light touches, “scream, when you hit the right spot.” His hand goes lower, teasing, brushing, not quite touching. “The way they dig their nails into their palms first and then the sheets and then your back. Or maybe if they reach out and cling to the headboard.” His eyes are black, only a ring of green around the pupils.
It’s an act, Harry realises the second Malfoy’s eyes rove over the crowd and settle on him. Behind the blankness of his mask is the terrified boy Harry is here to defend, the one who stepped into a lake of blind loyalty for his parents without knowing how to swim. There’s something pleading and desperate in that gaze, and Harry’s heart unwillingly clenches. He’s not here to be emotional, he’s here to do what’s right, but Malfoy’s grey eyes full of desperate defiance snaps the thin boundary between the two.
So when Harry finds Draco on the couch by the fireplace, the book’s pages crumpling against his chest, he takes a minute to just take in the sight of him– peaceful and calm in his sleep, a rare sight these days.
“Why don’t you hand me the papers if you’re so insistent on getting a divorce? Piece on the side, Harry? Someone you want to marry who wants the final ties severed now that all the common factors have been eliminated?”
Potter takes a breath and continues, “But perhaps, most importantly, Draco Malfoy was instrumental in saving my life. When Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and myself were captured by the Snatchers, Bellatrix, Lucius and Narcissa pressurised Draco to identify us. Undoubtedly, it would have been a glorious step up for him in the Dark Lord’s ranks should he have complied. He refused to answer, buying us time and a visit from the Dark Lord. Later, in a scuffle, he allowed me to disarm him, changing the allegiance of not only his own wand to me, but also the Elder Wand.”
“I don’t think of time,” Draco says automatically, eyes focused on the little tilt of Harry’s mouth. “It’s all a social construct. Illusions.”
They stay in a tiny Muggle hotel near the Duomo that is very creatively named, “Duomo”. Both Potter and Draco snort when they see the word painted onto the dark wood of the sign, and unanimously agree that this place seems perfect for their purposes. The split second hesitation Draco has before asking for two rooms instead of one like he wants to has the shrewd-eyed receptionist look up from her book to peer first at him and then behind him to where Potter’s standing with his hands jammed into the pockets of his jeans, bouncing on the balls of his feet.
Rationally he knows that Draco’s probably just going down to speak to Hermione or get some food or something but his screwed brain screams don’t let go, don’t let go over and over again.
It’s understandable, Aunt Hermione had assured him with a gentle hand on his arm after one of his most vicious panic attacks. He’d only been seven, after all.
It isn’t often that he understands Pureblood traditions, but on some days he understands the sentiment behind some of them.
No one says anything for long minutes. Eventually Draco heaves a disappointed sigh and Harry’s confusion only grows by the minute. “Am I going to be let in on what’s happening anytime soon?”
Harry has heard about the importance of dressing well for hearings. The jury looks upon you favourably when they see you capable of decency. If any part of the jury’s decision hinges on Malfoy’s outfit, he’s going right back into the darkness he’s emerged from. There’s a violence surging in him, a chest monster that has been roaring in the hollow cavern of his ribs since the sound of war and the screams of the bereaved stopped. He clenches his fist against the tabletop, reigning himself in. It would not reflect well on himself or Malfoy if he were to hex the guards.
Whatever had risen in Harry’s chest resembling hope sinks. “A man like me?” he asks, voice bitter and tone harsh. Of course Malfoy is still a prejudiced prat. Of course he’s still a biased fuck—
It had to be worth something, something great, something like his sanity or someone else’s life or an apology he could not avoid. Otherwise, the words avoided him as much as he avoided them. His thoughts were images, memories, fantasies. Not words. Never words. The moment they turned to words, he had what Granger had called them. Panic attacks.
“We’re going to pretend you didn’t say that,” Harry says and Draco almost collapses from how much it fucking hurts. At least Harry isn’t leaving.
It is unusual, Scorpius knows. His sleep is fitful. Not violent spasms, not writhing screams, no nightmares– just sharp bursts of pain blooming through his body, intensifying like cramps. He usually wakes to them slowly, through eyelashes stuck together with silent tears and sleep, and when his breathing grows too laboured for him to secret away his discomfort, Harry or Draco will wake, softly ask him where it hurts and apply muscle relaxant charms or pressure or massages.
When they part, gasping for breath, Harry’s eyes remain closed while he chases Draco just slightly. Then a blissful smile creeps up onto his lips and his eyelashes flutter slightly. But just before he opens his eyes, just before Draco can lose himself in wave after wave of ecstasy at seeing those green, vibrant eyes look up at him, panic courses through him like a Stunner to the chest.
“It’s…” he hesitates, unsure how to convey that he doesn’t want Harry to run because Harry thinks Draco wants too much from him, that Draco wants something he can’t give him, that Draco could possibly be dissatisfied with even the scraps Harry hands him every alternate night of the week before he returns to Ginevra’s waiting arms. “It’s too intimate.”
“You don’t even like me!” Draco feels the need to point out. “You hate me, we—we hate each other, it’s a thing. And now what, you want to go backpacking across the continent with me—?”
“Woman?” Draco prompts. “No, I suppose not. Ought not to get it wrong when that’s what drew you to me in the first place, huh?”
Granger looks up from where she’s stirring her spoon and fixes him with such an intent stare that the blush Draco feels rising darkens his cheeks. “I’ve just, I’ve noticed, he used to sit opposite me in the Great Hall, we could see each other and you all were almost creating some commotion so I, I know–”
Malfoy turns the rest of the way. He’s facing Harry fully, and his posture is wary. His expression is carefully neutral, the corners of his lips twitching with repressed emotion. “I’m not sure that’s a good idea, Potter,” he says, haltingly. There’s an uncertainty in his face Harry is all too familiar with from watching Hermione puzzle out responses to questions she doesn’t immediately know the answer to. “I’m not… welcome in most places a man like you might find suitable for a drink.”
Voldemort he could say in the darkness of his room at night with the curtains drawn around his bed and the blanket drawn up over his ears.
Malfoy shrugs and smiles ruefully. “Helped keep up appearances,” he says. “We never confirmed or denied the rumours but they… served the purpose.”
“You look like you’re having an existential crisis,” Potter observes mildly. The foam of his beer has found its way onto his upper lip. He licks it off and spreads his hands out on the table in a throwaway gesture of
“He looked, he looked like a bloody corpse today, ‘Mione!” Harry bursts out. Hermione’s eyes widen. “He, he wasn’t wearing a shirt and he was talking like he was on Muggle drugs… no filter, completely out of it, bloody hell, if I hadn’t known he was the only one on the property, I would have thought he was someone else!”
“Come in or leave,” he mumbles at the vaguely Potter shaped silhouette before turning his back on it, moving further into the cool, dark interior of his apartment.
His hands fly into Harry’s already messed up hair, gripping it, tightening in it. He has always been sensitive there to the point of it being on this side of painful. But the sensations travelling up and down his body is so far removed from painful, the little electric jolts of pleasure arcing across his spine, his legs, his chest, his dick.
‘That’s because he hasn’t,’ Jemima snorts and then smiles. ‘Have a good time, boss. You need a break.’
“No,” Draco interjects, knowing Granger doesn’t know how to respond given her own situation at the time. “He was casting spells. Pointing his wand at the walls, at the bed, at the pictures. Smiling, completely unresponsive to anything else. Weasleys cuts… the plaster hit him a few times.”
But though they spend time together, they barely speak. When they do, it’s about Quidditch or the news in the Prophet. Sometimes they solve a crossword together. Harry barely ever gets a word but he likes making fun of Malfoy’s failed attempts and even though he won’t admit it, there is something alluring about the way Malfoy bites his lower lip and sucks it into his mouth when he is concentrating.
“I know you thought we were a loose end,” he sighs, letting his head fall back onto the edge of the bed. “I know you wanted to see us solve some part of this before you left.” He chokes out a laugh that sounds far closer to a strangled sob. “I wish we could have given you that. Even if it was a divorce. There would be something then that wasn’t this drifting from one moment to the next unsure of everything. Something concrete.”
Potter saved me from Fiendfyre, Potter spoke at my trial, Potter took me out for drinks, Potter came with me to Italy, and then Potter became Harry. He doesn’t know how to convey any of that in a manner that does not make this sound incomprehensible and ridiculous, so he shrugs.
Kingsley speaks this time. “Even if he is, which is not unlikely, there is little to be gained from cutting him out. His upbringing and knowledge of Pureblood customs and mentality is invaluable to the project’s success. If at the cost of his personal gain the Wizarding World avoids wars such as these in the future, in my opinion, it is a small price to pay.”
“Yeah,” Harry nods. “It’s not pleasant and you don’t have to clean it but if you really need to, we can do it together.”
The Healer’s face is serious. She isn’t too old, Draco thinks, perhaps in her mid thirties. But she appears wiser than anyone of that age Draco has ever encountered. Hermione looks alarmed.
And then Potter ruins it by saying in typical Potter fashion, with a grin broad enough to split his face in two, “I want to measure his dick,” and the world shifts back into place.
Except, one month after Scorpius’ seventh birthday, Harry had arrested Selwyn, dragged him out of the house in shackles with a murder charge to his name and an allegation that he was attempting the resurrection of Voldemort.
“You absolute menace,” Draco says, biting down on his exposed earlobe. “Bumping uglies, Potter,” he says, startling a laugh out of Harry. “Buggering, doing the do, the old in and out—”
He closes his eyes and enters the room and bangs the door shut behind him. Then he falls to the floor at that spot where they had been standing, at the spot where Draco had tracked ash into the room from the Floo. At the spot where they had been kissing and Harry had been certain that his dreams were coming true, finally.
“I have little to say in my own defence,” Draco says. His father would not be proud of his honesty. But then again, his father is not in a courtroom full of people who are looking at him with considering eyes, weighing on a balance that will be flipped with a wrong look, a haughty tilt of the head. “But I would like to take this rare opportunity to do something I have never done before, though there has been more than enough reason.”
“Our grudge extends beyond the War, doesn’t it?” he asks her, raising a hand to his right cheek, a memory of being called a
They have reverted to their weekly routine, only they meet more frequently than three times a week. Sometimes at the Manor, sometimes at Grimmauld and sometimes in Muggle cafes where no one knows who Draco is and when he drops the Glamour, only a few people barely cast a glance at the Mark on his arm.
She cocks her head to the side. Pointedly she brings her gaze down to rest on his ring– the seven emeralds gleaming bright. “Interesting,” she murmurs. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
He looks towards Death, and stares into the indeterminate eyes. If he takes them for what they are, they aren’t ever-changing or even multicoloured. They’re a swirling abyss of normalcy devolving into the madness of infinity. It starts off as an iris of speckled shades that narrows into a pinprick that isn’t black as much as a vacuum. If Scorpius looks into them for too long, the realities of infinity and time will break his mind.
Potter isn’t in the mood for subtlety, Draco realises and furtively glances around the library for Granger.
It is a sharp jut of bone covered in alabaster skin so smooth that Harry couldn’t help but redden it up with bites and kisses. The way Draco reacts to touch… Harry could touch him all day, everyday.
“A branch of the main family got a little tired of the Dark Arts that the main branch kept dabbling in and settled here. Pretty enough to be regal, small enough to be secluded. Simple enough for the Malfoys to reign like wealthy lords.”
“But isn’t he right in a way?” Harry continues, looking down undeterred at the letter, a frown marring his brow. “There’s no reason to not do the things we’re sure about. To not do what we know we want to do eventually anyway. If I want to do something two years later and I know I want to do it, and I have the time now, why wouldn’t I?”
On one memorable occasion, it had been half an hour and eventually Malfoy had opened the door just to ask Harry to fuck off. Harry had held up the lunchbox and a Quidditch magazine and the crack had widened and he had been allowed in reluctantly.
“What did you just say?” He asks her, feeling his eyes widening. “I called you an arse,” she says, not looking up. “It’s not that surprising, surely?”
He knocks on the door of Harry’s room. It had been completely ruined but Hermione had told him the three of them had managed to fix most of it. It had been Harry’s godfather’s room and he refuses to move out into a different one even if the plaster is strangely chipped in places.
“They’re quite alike, you know?” Harry says, latching onto the last topic of conversation he’d have thought possible in any degree of civility with Malfoy of all people. “They’d do anything for us. My mother died to keep me safe from Voldemort. Your mother lied to his face.”
He cries, he cries the frustration he feels at not feeling completely settled as who he used to be, cries because he used to feel more himself as a Dursley house elf than he does now, cries because Ron has to take Fred’s place in the shop, cries because he remembers Hermione screaming at night and Ron with a blank look on his face that indicates he has completely dissociated. Cries because Molly doesn’t smile as widely as she used to, the strain around her mouth more prominent now, cries because Ginny couldn’t stay here after the War and left for Durmstrang to complete her NEWTS, cries because he misses her. He keeps crying and then he cries because Malfoy isn’t supposed to be like this. Malfoy was a constant, a hated but necessary constant. If nothing, he could count on Malfoy to always despise him, to loathe him, to throw hexes at the sight of him. Instead Malfoy opens doors shirtless and looking like he has been living on the streets without a galleon to his name to buy some food. The world is spinning out of Harry’s control and all he can do right now is clutch on to Hermione’s warm woollen sweater, be thankful for the warmth she has encased him in and cry his heart out.
She talks about Ginny Weasley with a sort of hidden longing and when she catches Draco staring, admits to having been in love with her for years but never doing anything about it because she belonged with Harry. And perhaps she senses his pain at those words because the next thing he knows, he is talking about how he doesn’t understand it too well but there is something about Harry that draws Draco to him like a moth to a flame. How he had stopped wanting anything after the War but Harry had whirled his way into his life and made him desire all over again. How he is afraid that Harry’s friendship had just been residual guilt or fear or whatever drove him to this madness today. How he hasn’t been this happy since third year and all just because Hermione Granger and Harry Potter decided to make a routine for him and Ron Weasley decided to cook him lunch on Wednesdays and Fridays. How he is terrified he will lose all of it after today.
. It sounds like a plan to cheat Death– you, whatever– endlessly, but there’s just– it’s a fucking hard concept to wrap your head around.”
They both go on, scratching their quills against parchment, as though she hadn’t told him repeatedly that he might be able to get through to Potter if they’d both just put their stubbornness aside and have a conversation.
When Hermione Granger approaches Draco Malfoy in the middle of Diagon Alley in October after the War, Draco
“Breathe in for me, Hermione,” he murmurs, voice even and soft. “One, two, three, that’s good, breathe out. Again, one, two three, breathe out…”
He can’t bear to look at her so he buries his face in his hands. “How’d it get to this, Mione?” He asks her, voice muffled. He feels the warmth of her hand on his shoulder, a comforting touch that he has missed for a long, long time.
Draco half expects Harry to throw punches or hexes or at least throw his words about, but Harry ambles over to the sofa and perches on the arm of it, his delicate pose at odds with the heaviness radiating from every angle of his posture.
These bedrooms are not the ones where the Death Eaters lived or where Muggles were tortured. In fact, when the Death Eaters had come to the Manor, Narcissa had shut off the East Wing entirely. With everything that has happened within its walls, the Manor is now known as Voldemort’s Headquarters but sometimes everyone, including Draco forgets how large the damn thing really is, how much of it wasn’t the abode of Death Eaters or Voldemort but instead remnants of the proud history the Malfoy lineage has always boasted. The East Wing, though extremely large and practically half of the house, was left untouched by the carnage that took place here, not because of Narcissa’s careful locking charms but because it simply wasn’t required. What was already there was enough for the thirty Death Eaters of Voldemort’s inner circle, chosen carefully to live with him. Thugs like Crabbe Sr. and Goyle Sr., beasts like Greyback, lunatics like Bellatrix and Rodolphus and crafty villains like Rabastan, Macnair and Nott. Draco shudders at the memories of some of those who had touched the walls of his house, slept in the beds, eaten at the tables.
How no one else notices is beyond Draco. Maybe it’s just him who’s grown used to learning cues living with an insane megalomaniac in his house.
Draco swallows and jerkily nods. “Thank you,” he says before turning to fully look at him. His eyes are slightly glossy but Harry doesn’t draw attention to that fact. “Your turn.”
So when Ron pulls him into a strong bear hug, it takes Harry some time to process what the bloody hell is going on. Instead of cold words or shouted insults, Ron is whispering in his ear, you bloody fool, you scared us, why won’t you just fucking talk to us, Harry, mate, we fucking love you, and Harry feels the tears come to his eyes.
“I don’t want our bodies to wash up on the shores of the Channel, no,” Potter says, wiping at the corners of his eyes. His words are warmer now. “But I don’t have anything to do for at least a year Malfoy. Might as well join you and make sure you’re doing what you’re supposed to.”
Granger had Apparated him to a backroom of the Leaky so he could Floo back without anyone seeing him, apologising profusely all the while. Draco didn’t think he could form the words to convey that he probably deserved all of the vitriol Potter threw at him anyway, his mouth was too parched, his throat too dry. She had grasped his shoulders and told him she would keep in touch, said she hoped he would consider the proposal she had, even… after.
The Hallows were loose ends. Tying them up was more complicated than the vaults, but it’s fascinating what a few favours and a little goodwill will do for you.
“Was there ever any doubt?” Draco asks, the words forming and falling before he can stop and censor them.
“Hey,” he asks, once satisfied, the hints of a smile playing along the edges of his lips. “Less drunk?”
“Silencing Charm,” he says, frustrated. Draco fiddles in his pocket for his wand, and Harry, who has had enough of the delays and the derailments, flicks his fingers, whispering, “
The room seems to have a faintly musty odour and he recognises it as one where too many cleaning charms have been applied but the smell itself is sentient and obstinate. Draco knows the process all too intimately, the Manor itself is resistant to simple cleaning charms at the moment. This place is no Manor but it is an old Wizarding House and despite not having seen the rest of it, Draco knows with certainty it will be beautiful once restored.
Feeling lonely for the first time in six weeks in his Manor, Draco wanders around, feeling lost. He has cleaned out every room, even the ones he was afraid to step into and now he has nothing left to do. The Manor, Draco thinks, is something like those Muggle museums Hermione drags him to. Beautiful objects placed in every room to impress viewers and guests, meant to be looked at, not touched. Never touched.
He remembers finally understanding that those days were never coming back, remembers blocking out the sound of muffled yelling in the kitchen to focus on schoolwork from the muggle elementary school Draco and Harry had agreed to send him to prior to Hogwarts.
“We should go somewhere else,” Potter says, stretching his legs out. It’s late evening on an idle day in late June and the villa is bathed in pink and gold, as vibrant as a bruise, as beautiful and inexplicable as a kaleidoscope. “It’s been a while here.”
“I want to go to Florence,” Draco says, because he does. He wants to revisit the city he dreams of in his escapist fantasies, wants to lose himself in the throng of voices. Florence buzzes with people, with voices, with the ambitious silence of art critics and the delighted nervousness of young couples who save up enough money for a romantic getaway to somewhere that is not Paris or Milan. Florence is a hub of everything the better parts of Draco revel in and he wants to visit it, if only to hate himself a little less. Potter shrugs, because Potter doesn’t care where they go as long as they go somewhere.
The twinkle in Hermione’s eye is positively mischievous. “Why don’t you ask him yourself when you go over to say sorry?”
Draco smiles a little. Knocks back the rest of his whisky. “I don’t want Muggles or Muggle-borns dead, Potter, thank you. You needn’t worry.”
“And now, I’m going to take that bottle out of your hands, give you a Sobering Potion, rub your back while you puke, make you take a cold shower and then put you to bed. Does that sound good?”
“I was. I could have, I could have gone to Dumbledore, maybe even to you but if I had done that… I would be disowned. And during the War, all I had left when all my beliefs were shattered, everything had gone to hell, was my name. And I didn’t want to lose it.”
She shakes her head ruefully. “Ginny wants me to help her with an Astronomy project they have. I can get something to eat though.” She turns her hopeful gaze on Potter. “Care to join me?”
Looking more relieved than he should, Draco bends down and places a chaste kiss on Harry’s forehead. Then he looks anxiously back at Harry and says, ‘Was it okay I did that?”
“What brought this on?” Draco asks, eyes sharp and expression demanding. A few months ago, it would have made Harry furious. Now he sees it for what it really is, an expression of concern disguised under cold factuality and rational understanding of the situation. He responds in kind.
“Yes! Merlin! Bloody Merlin! He’s the one who’s supposed to always know what the bloody fuck is going on, innit? Merlin or Ravenclaw, or anyone really! God? Jesus Christ? Hera? Anyone who knows what’s going on! Dumbledore, maybe? Dad always goes on about that bloke.”
“In any case,” he says hurriedly, shutting down that line of thought before it evolves into something unmanageable, “you were saying something about explaining why you’re here?”
Granger is exhausted but sleepless, sitting by Weasley’s head, stroking his hair. His cuts have been healed and salve applied to the bruises on his side and arms. He hasn’t woken up since Healer Choudhury left but she assured them that this was natural sleep and he would wake up, hopefully fresh and stable the next morning.
“Shhh,” says a voice. Presumably the voice of whoever gave him the water. The voice is not unfamiliar but he can’t quite place it. His head hurts too much for him to make a conscious effort.
“I, I didn’t know,” he whispers, sounding so upset and childlike that Draco almost forgets about his erection in favour of drawing Harry into his arms.
“If Harry doesn’t receive professional help soon, he may need to be institutionalised. For his own safety and that of others including yourself.”
“You miss her,” Draco ventures a guess even though his heart is twisting. He is nailing shut his own coffin, asking for the pain. Asking for Potter to reminisce about his lost love. Asking for Potter to confirm that he really doesn’t stand even a fraction of a chance.
“I think,” Harry says and his breath ghosts along Draco’s lips gently, “The only reason I had this much fun was because I went with you.”
A small laugh. Scorpius finds himself relaxing at the sound. It’s strange, how calming Death is. “Indeed it isn’t. It is exactly what it looks like. You are where you seem to be. It is no illusion, child.”
He looks at her, but her face is unreadable. Open and honest as always, but indecipherable. “Oh?” he prompts, and she smiles.
Harry has known joy. Harry has known grief. Harry has known hatred and love, Harry has known victory tinged with defeat. But the satisfaction of this moment is new. There are no proper words for it, none that could encompass the sheer joy of seeing this transformation. It’s like watching a flower bloom, waiting with the diseased bud into the night, waking to a new dawn where a delicate flower has taken its place, as resilient as the bud, as beautiful as life, as sacred as any God.
“What have you been doing?” He asks her instead, avoiding the subject matter of either her husband or their marriage. “To keep busy? Surely you’re not moping around all day, alone, in that great big house of yours.”
“Your advice is to help me process grief, not keep me from alcohol,” he says, tone mild. His fingers clench in the fabric of his pants. Her eyes drop to the gesture and dart away.
Draco exhales. He doesn’t need to answer, the answer is in the tense muscles of his jaw, in the rapid, shallow breaths he’s taking, in the fear he’s trying to swallow back down.
His over sensitised channel clenches and undulates against Harry’s brutal thrusts and within moments of his own orgasm, Harry’s chasing his own high with a guttural cry and a particularly sharp thrust that he can’t sustain, sending him shuddering and shaking straight into Draco’s arms.
“Someone told me that letter would never be enough. But what I am doing with Hermione, what I am trying to do for the Wizarding World, that is a step towards being enough someday.” He tries to look as earnest as possible. “I took that advice to heart.”
“You need help,” Luna says matter of factly. “And before you object and tell me it’s unnecessary, I’m going to give you a rundown of exactly what you did today so you know to what extent this has gone.”
Harry doesn’t say anything, but his eyes are squeezed shut, and his lower lip is sucked into his mouth.
She’d met his eyes then, watched him struggle to breathe with tears in her own and had rushed out of the room crying when he’d said in a hoarse, broken voice that this is why he couldn’t hate them. That they needed him to keep their own pices together just as much as he needed them now.
‘Phenomenal?” Harry teases, catching on to what Draco is trying to get at. “Magnificent? Exciting? One-of-a-kind?”
“I see,” Choudhury says. “I’ll do what I can. Now, don’t you worry dear, go downstairs and have some hot cocoa. Maybe some chocolate. And we’ll have a chat after I’m finished here. Is that alright?”
He throws up too many times to count and when his chest finally stops heaving, he collapses on the floor, sweaty and exhausted. He wants to cry, he feels fucking awful- his head hurts, his body aches, his throat feels scratched raw when the door to the toilet opens and Draco steps back in.
Harry looks up to see Malfoy sucking it into his mouth, cheeks hollowed and eyes closed. He’s a sight, hair tousled and cascading over his forehead, lips a little swollen from the ice cream and an expression on his face that Harry can only describe as post-orgasmic bliss.
“He sent a cryptic note to me the day after you went, the gist of which I figured was that he appreciated me sending you to him even though he still thinks you’re a right pain. There was something about hallucinations that I didn’t understand.”
Sitting across from him, drink in hand, laughing in a way that doesn’t seem to have anything to do with mockery or animosity or unkind one-upping but instead genuine mirth, Harry Potter is nothing short of beautiful. It’s an underwhelming adjective but there is nothing more appropriate for the understated gloriousness of Potter’s dark curls bouncing with the slight shakes of his head, the scrunched up corners of his eyes. A lot about Potter’s persona is loud because it needs to be. But this Potter is steadier, quieter and Draco wonders what it might mean that the parts of him still shrieking from the horrors of Azkaban and Voldemort quiet for a moment as the sound of Potter’s laughter drowns out the sounds of agonised screams.
“Draco,” says the woman sitting across from him in the chair, “we can’t do this unless you tell me what you want.”
She nods jerkily and heads back downstairs, looking up at him every few seconds. Eventually, finding the strength in his knees, he stands up and climbs the stairs back to his room. There he pauses at the threshold. The exact place that Draco had gripped his jaw and pulled him closer. The moment Harry had known that he would be kissed and had wanted nothing else.
Archibald had predictably gone red in the face and had blustered for another fifteen minutes about the importance of tradition and how the modernisation of the economy by introducing electricity and television ruined lives. It had predictably circled right back to Shacklebolt and his ‘pro-Muggle’ schemes and how they damaged Wizarding Society.
That was how he’d come to know Potter better, how he’d discovered Ronald Weasley’s weakness for melted choco lava cakes, how he’d come to know that Ginny Weasley hadn’t taken Potter’s name even after their marriage, because she’d wanted to make a statement: I married for love, not a title.
“I wish,” he says, rolling his eyes. There’s fondness there that he won’t admit to. “Would do Father a world of good. Might even sway Dad if he could swallow down his guilt and just
“Killed twelve people with a Blasting Curse in a bookmaking factory. They’re passing off as a hazard of the job. Honestly, the Kiss wasn’t harsh enough for these bloody monsters.”
He does not expect Malfoy to get up, knuckles white around the stem of his wine glass and disappear into the hallway that Harry knows leads to the staircase.
Draco’s eyes fly open at that. He had expected, I shouldn’t have or I didn’t mean to but Potter is saying he didn’t have a right when in fact, he did. It was his house and he had the right to throw out unwanted visitors. Draco didn’t expect that. He opens his mouth to speak but Potter seems to be soldiering on, “I know Hermione must have had a reason, she obviously weighed bringing you somewhere and honestly, Grimmauld is as much her home as it is mine so there isn’t a reason why she shouldn’t be able to bring in whomever she pleases but I was…”
“I didn’t tell the Burrow yet,” Harry continues, biting into the sandwich. “The Weasleys, I mean. There’s too much to unpack there, and I don’t… romance isn’t…”
“Did I hurt poor Potty’s feelings?” he taunts and watches the way Potter’s eyes go flinty and his jaw tightens. The ache in his heart only serves to rile him up further. “Should I throw in a comment about Mudbloods? What better can you expect from a Death Eater, picking fights and throwing tantrums—”
Instead he smiles and says, “What a caring boyfriend you make, Potter,” and delights in the way the colour rushes into Harry’s cheeks.
His hands fall like dead weights to the bed, but he still brings them to rub his aching, bruised wrists.
“So that’s all I was to you?” Draco asks, trying and failing to conceal the hurt in the words. “An experiment at sixteen and a couple of fucks at seventeen?”
There’s no God in Wizarding culture, so they trust in magic. Worship it. Purebloods are just… religious in that way. And just as with every other religion, there are some who are fanatics who give the whole thing a bad rep. Being married to one of those (a Pureblood, not a fanatic– well. An ex fanatic of sorts) helped Harry see the best of it.
She inclines her head slightly. “The schedule stands, then? Same time, next week. Unless of course you’re possessed to give me a call at another time.”
“Ron and I were thinking,” Hermione says from his other side, fingers seeking his in the dark. He reaches out to clasp them with one hand, gripping Ron’s with the other. “That we should go to Australia.”
Of course there is guilt, stark and black against his pale forearm, a hideous mangled scar of a war Draco fought with himself as much as he did with the classmates he saw growing up.
With trembling legs, Draco raises himself off Harry’s cock with a wince and the wet squelching sound it makes when the ring of muscle finally pops free makes Draco cringe.
‘Yes, Potter, instead of sitting there and looking pretty, might as well put your presence to some use,” Malfoy says, tone snide and mocking.
“In any case, this happened when he came into my room one night. No Death Eater was allowed to protect their doors. Something about a trust of faith and loyalty. Locking spells were allowed, but nothing protective. The Dark Lord, Voldemort, I mean, Voldemort, Voldemort, would check on us. And one night Greyback just… broke open the door. I hexed him away but he kept coming and the one time he was close enough… he did this.”
“What—?” Draco manages eventually, the word filling the space between them with all the unasked questions. “Harry—?”
He looks around, sees nothing until a pale hand behind the bed catches is eye on the floor. He moves fast, almost running and finds Malfoy sprawled on his back, eyelids fluttering. His breaths are shallow though not dangerously so and Harry can’t decide between relief and panic at the sight.
Fixing Potter with one last what he hopes is a venomous and not a full of hurt betrayal stare, Draco reaches out for the parchment Granger has pulled out. If he has to deal with an incompetent bastard, he has to work hard enough to make up for two.
He shouts, a litany of profanities falling from his lips and Harry reaches down and places his hand over Draco’s clenched fist.
When Hermione pulls him away forcibly with strength he didn’t know she had and tells him to stay away, Malfoy’s a right quivering mess. She Apparates him out of the house and he’s left in the kitchen with the burning remnants of the lunch on the stove.
Scorpius smiles, a rueful glimmer of upturned lips and bashfulness. “The very same,” he says with a shrug.
In the few months that Draco has pulled down most of his defences, Harry had forgotten just how viciously defensive most Slytherins are. “What’s it to you?” Parkinson asks, stressing her vowels so hard she sounds more snake than human. “Am I not allowed to visit my best friend?”
Malfoy opens his mouth and shuts it. His eyes are a little wide and his hands are clenching and unclenching on the table. Harry knows it will take a while to break Malfoy’s conditioning, but in the brief but sincere nod he receives, there’s the sweet taste of a battle won.
Potter’s smile is quick and heartbreaking in its accessible ease. Draco can only ever dream of such an expression coming easily to him. His smiles are twisted with mockery even when he doesn’t intend them to be. Potter’s lips are dark and when they curve in a smile, the perfect cupid’s bow of them stretches out in a warm glide. “A mentor if you will.”
“Another,” Draco demands when the burn of the first finger fades. This time Harry isn’t quite as gentle, moving faster, letting the lube and the slight stretch do half his work for him. His poisoning fingers brush against Draco’s prostate and when Draco bites into the pillow with a howl, Harry repeats the motion enough times for the pillow to be permanently pockmarked with the evidence of his agonised ecstasy.
Two weeks later, Draco finds Harry with a letter in his hand, sitting blankly on the windowsill, watching the setting sun from their window, the birds spiralling through the sky to find a safe place to roost, the people jostling each other. He looks thoughtful and a little anxious. When Draco asks him what’s wrong, he startles and holds the letter up.
Everyone had come to know about the Horcruxes after they had all been destroyed. Voldemort with his fragmented soul, immortal in artefacts. They had come to know that each had been destroyed in the time Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Harry Potter had disappeared for a year just before the War. Some on 2nd May, 1998 by others but most during that time.
The look on her face is speculative. She seems to be sizing him up, reading into his expression with a frighteningly intense gaze. At long last, when the staring contest has begun to get a tad awkward and his eyes sting from not blinking, she sighs. “Sit down, Malfoy,” she says. “ I’m going to make tea. Don’t think of going somewhere else, don’t think of drawing your wand, don’t think of anything funny, sit down and wait for me or I’ll make sure you live to regret it.”
Harry resumes his kisses, except now he’s moving steadily downward, sometimes chaste, sometimes filthy, sometimes brushing his lips gently and softly over the ridges of a scar and sometimes sucking a purpling bruise into the tender skin of his side.
Draco doesn’t dare open his eyes. He’s fucking done it, he thinks, panic surging like a rising tide threatening to envelope and destroy everything in its path. He had heaven in his arms and he’s shot it all to hell, like always. He couldn’t even–
For one moment, time is stretched so thin, it doesn’t quite feel quite real. Draco simply stares at Harry, the contours of his face, the sharp line of his jaw, the edges of his curls violating the boundaries of his forehead to fall into his eyes. Draco raises one wandering hand and traces an arched eyebrow, marvelling at the way even this simple motion causes Harry’s eyes to fall shut and his breath to catch.
It doesn’t hurt, the rage and the caustic words. It’s familiar territory. But though he’s seen it a million times, the accompanying undercurrent of disgust burrows under his skin like shards of a broken knife.
He’s burning for Harry, all warmth and light and wonder and combustion has never tasted quite this much like salvation.
“No clue. Nothing I have of my dad’s indicates he knew about any family there. I don’t even know which state my family’s from,” he says. The curve of his mouth tilts downwards. It’s a little bitter, a little resigned, but his words are dry. “It’s all very murky and mysterious.”
On most days, it tastes bitter as bile, a burning in his throat, unquenchable and immortal, a burden to be borne to death. Sometimes Draco wonders if the Wizengamot would have punished him at all if they had been allowed to cast
“Harry?” He screams, and the worry and heartbreak bleeding into his voice is so familiar and foreign simultaneously that Scorpius begs Death to stop letting him see this. Death does not respond.
He looks up at Draco, whose look of concentration has morphed into a look of open, blatant desire and Harry blushes under the scrutiny.
“Pardon me,” Blaise had snarked unapologetically, “I wanted to spare you some dignity. If it makes you feel better, married men do not leave their wives for the gay lover either, Draco. They have some sort of existential sexuality crisis, realise life is better with the white picket fence and 2.5 kids and the stable job and lack of scandal and send a brief apologetic letter to end the affair on a Tuesday morning.”
Draco realises Potter is avoiding him when he doesn’t turn up at the Manor on both Wednesday and Friday.
He stares at her bent head for a few more minutes, opening and closing his mouth like a fish. When he turns back to his cauldron, his light pink potion has gone an alarming shade of red. He hastily stirs anti-clockwise, but his focus is anywhere but on his potion.
“I remember you sitting around in Harry’s chair and scaring the living shit out of me.” He looks away and bites down a bitter smile. “Or whatever was left of it anyway.”
“What?” he asks, and cringes at how irritable it sounds. He schools his expressions into neutrality when Potter turns towards him and scowls.
Draco had shaken his head in response despite her not having phrased it like a question, tracing the soft wrinkle on her cheek. She’d been youthful even a few months ago, but the illness had bled her dry of vitality and brightness in record time. Her age caught up to her, and once unmarred skin had crinkled like old paper.
Harry leans in closer and their lips meet in a sweet, soft kiss that feels like coming home and Draco’s mouth opens under his like the petals of a rose in bloom.
That’s when he notices. Two blonde heads on the couch (which Harry remembers being ripped up with the stuffing flying around), side by side, resting against each other. He walks around the couch and sure enough, Luna and Draco are sleeping side by side, leaning against each other, wands in hand, looking exhausted.
Harry groans. He hears Ron drop something in the kitchen and Malfoy’s jaw drops. “No,” he says. “Thank you, but I couldn’t possibly–”
“Why now, Potter?” He asks, simply because there is absolutely nothing else he can think to say in this situation.
It’s Potter’s turn to shrug. “Anywhere. Everywhere. I was kind of hoping to land up at some point in India, but not right away.”
“Did something happen? I knew I should have gone with you, I just thought you’d do better if I wasn’t there what with your male ego and all–”
Draco had begun on a sheet of parchment, drunk and lost, before scratching it out and tossing the balled sheet away.
“What time is it?” Harry asks her, keeping his voice low so as to not wake Draco. He stretches out, reaching for his spectacles trying to avoid jostling the sleeping man curled into his back as much as possible. When the blurriness that comes with his lack of vision fades away, and even then all he sees her do is press her hands to her mouth and look to be on the verge of tears, he feels the first premonitions of alarm roiling in his stomach. “Mione? Is everything okay?”
“Well,” Draco says, shrugging, “she’s the one who brought it to us. She had two children– twins. They were both born with illnesses likely to kill them young– a blood curse on the boy and a magical tumour for the girl growing in her stomach. He wanted to name them something common and traditional, something made to look fancy on a headstone, but she insisted on naming them after stars.”
He felt sick every single time he did it. But he kept doing it till the name lost meaning, till the word lost power. It felt like a reclamation.
“Have you ever…” Potter trails off, and Draco turns to look at him and finds him worrying his bottom lip with his teeth, staring into the distance.
He bucks up, hips stuttering, unable to control himself and Potter chokes just a little. The hand on Draco’s hip tightens considerably, and Draco feels dizzy with the raw, heady power coursing through his body, spreading from Harry’s bruising grip on his hip. Harry’s magic is floating over him, leaching into the space between his cells, embedding itself deep into Draco’s very being. It’s adding an unfathomably erotic rush to the sex and Draco wants to thrash, wants to pull, wants to jump out of his skin, but all he can do is scream himself hoarse.
“Ginny left,” Potter says, and Draco knows he notices the way Draco’s shoulders tighten and relax at the name. “She told me what happened. Said you had a panic attack.”
Potter still skips classes but he comes for some. When he doesn’t, he asks Hermione to explain things and sometimes if Hermione is too busy, Potter comes to find him in the Library. There has been no truce, no cathartic conversation between them but somehow the simmering antagonism has been reduced to a negligible discomfort.
“Why the sudden change of heart?” Ginny asks. “You’ve been fighting Voldemort since you were eleven, and now that he’s dead, you’re suddenly sick of it?”
Harry is so concentrated on Hermione, he doesn’t even notice when Malfoy rises from his chair. When he finally does, he’s trembling like a leaf near the doorway.
Potter had, with uncharacteristic foresight, conjured IDs for them which look impressively professional though Draco doesn’t understand half the stuff written on them. They fool the receptionist—who, to be fair seems significantly less interested in the IDs than she is in sending the two of them meaningful glances—so Draco isn’t really complaining.
After a minute, he feels the bed dip beside him and Draco is rubbing something that smells nice and feels like heaven into the bruise he knows is forming.
Harry responds with a hum and the vibrations around the heated flesh makes Draco almost start crying.
Ignoring the slight twinge of melancholy in his stomach, Draco responds dryly, “Since I have no better offers coming my way, might as well say yes.”
The East Wing has not suffered anything save neglect. It is dusty and the walls are peeling in places from the lack of upkeep. The paintings have abandoned their frames to either go live in obscure frames in the more habitable part of the house or to other Malfoy properties in the Continent. Some, Draco knows, have gone to the property in France where his mother is staying. So Draco casts Cleaning Charms and Brightening Charms, brings in a broom and focuses on dusting rather than the fact that he is finding doing a House-Elf’s chores therapeutic. But it does not have negative memories attached to it of Greyback tearing raw flesh with his claws or the stench of death.
It’s innocent, said as nonchalantly as possible. And yet, Draco can feel the tips of his ears burning. The thought of activities that might for some reason lead to him using Potter’s bathroom—
Draco looks into those earnest, bright green eyes that hold more weight than words ever will and his throat feels dry when he asks, “Yeah?”
The fact that he can even think those thoughts should fill him with relief at the knowledge that he isn’t quite so broken as to not appreciate a great thing but instead it fills him with shame. More likely than not, Draco will not want a thing to do with him anymore. He will probably still come around to Grimmauld for Hermione’s sake and maybe even Ron’s but after what he had seen Harry do… it is unlikely he will open up the Manor gates to him again at the mere promise of blueberry muffins or cheese omelettes or strawberry pancakes. And yet, here he is, wanting him like some shameless, inconsiderate…
His mind is not safe, but it is still private, and he wonders in the most secluded crevices of it what it means to feel those flutters in the depths of his stomach at the sight of Potter’s broad shoulders shaking.
The living room is complete madness, the couch torn into and stuffing flying around. There is broken glass on the floor, the furniture has been haphazardly pushed around. Cold panic seeps into Draco’s heart, fearing the worst, that some fanatic follower of Voldemort had finally finished his master’s unfinished business when he hears it.
Draco’s cheeks flame. Pansy drawls, “Leave it be, I think I already know,” and he groans and busies himself with his mousse.
‘Ugh, Merlin, Potter, six years with me and I still haven’t taught you how to eat, have I?’ Draco says, turning his nose up at the ridiculous sight Harry surely makes. ‘But pray tell, where is the holiday and when are we going?’
“I don’t… frankly, I don’t see the point of me asking for a divorce. I barely have grounds. You’re the bloody barrister, you know how to phrase these things yourself. You could just… I don’t know, write something up, sign it and hand it to me and when you move out, you’ll be a free man in every sense of the word.”
He’s a little curious, even. Parkinson and Malfoy had been inseparable in school. Crabbe and Goyle had been followers bowing to a king. Parkinson had been the closest to a Queen as Malfoy had allowed.
“I’m hungry,” he calls from outside. “When you’re done with whatever satanic rituals you’ve got going on that involve Harry’s arse, I’d like some food.”
He has only a moment to comprehend what that means before Draco’s lowering his mouth back onto Harry’s nipple, latching on and sucking. This isn’t something he usually lets Draco do, because the sensory onslaught can be too much sometimes and he’s always afraid he’s going to come in his pants but this time, Draco isn’t stopping and Harry’s hands are bound to the rattling headboard.
Scorpius is certain tears would have obscured his vision by now, if he’d retained the ability to cry. The ache in his empty chest intensifies.
When one spectacular thrust sending jolts sparking down Draco’s spine causes him to scream loud enough for his tenor to break through any silencing charms, Harry clamps a hand down over Draco’s mouth.
But on that day… the day of the Court Case That Sent Everything to Living Hell, breakfast had been the last thing on their minds.
“I’m not a Black,” Draco says, circling the rim of his glass with the tip of his finger. “But my mother kept with the Black tradition of naming me after the skies. Ironically enough, she was one of the few Black children for whom the tradition wasn’t maintained. Quite bit younger than both Bellatrix and Andromeda, you see, and both of them were holy terrors by the time they were twelve and ten, so my grandparents thought it best to go with something safer. It’s the Pureblood way– attributing your children’s faults to everything except yourself. They thought it was a problem with the stars.
In dreams, there are no papers, no court cases, no journalists sending him owls trying to extract a double meaning from ‘no comment’.
He lets Draco have his way, lifts his hips when he reaches over to pull the trousers off completely. He’s wearing only his briefs and though he’s still coming back up from the spectacular orgasm he had given himself with his mouth on Draco’s dick, hearing his name on Draco’s tongue over and over, his dick gives a half hearted little twitch at the feeling of Draco’s hand pressing down nervously on it.
By the time Harry’s mouthing just above the waistband of Draco’s jeans, the sounds and moans are falling uninhibited from Draco’s lips. Every time he thinks he might be going overboard, Harry’s voice sounds in his head,
“What sets you at peace?” Harry asks, because the light in Malfoy’s eyes pleads and flickers with the unspoken desire to be asked, though the question is unclear. He wants to speak, he wants to spill, he wants to stop holding back and Harry doesn’t know how to tread around this minefield of discovery but he tries anyway because this is what he came to do.
to slot his body against Harry’s and let himself drift into a mind-numbing, toe-curling kiss that the part of Draco on high alert drifts into the haziness enveloping the rest of his consciousness.
“Draco Malfoy took the Mark when he was sixteen years old. I am certain that many present here today do not recall their teenage years with pride or prestige. I know for a fact, my dear friend and fellow war hero, Ronald Weasley does not. While there is a valid point to be raised—there is a difference between bungling up one’s first enthusiastic kiss and taking a megalomaniac fool’s brand of unquestioning loyalty, there are many emotions that I dare to say are common. Misplaced faith in one’s own abilities being one of them.”
Draco shrugs. “When you cast a curse that takes a life, it leaves its mark. No matter who’s on the receiving end.”
Potter’s eyes widen comically behind his lenses. He opens and shuts his mouth a few times like a particularly inept yet attractive goldfish before hissing, “Excuse me?”
Hermione smiles at him and though he tries very hard not to, the corners of Malfoy’s eyes crinkle just slightly. Harry can’t help but notice how much better he looks when he has that slight softening to the sharp planes of his face, less pointy and jagged, more approachable.
It isn’t a prominent thing, just a subtle twitching which anyone else would pass off as a trick of the light but Harry with his magic sensitivity knows to not be.
Granger frowns. “I don’t like you,” she says after a while, biting her lower lip. “I don’t like you right now and I don’t know if I ever will. But Malfoy, after what I saw, I can’t say I don’t respect you for living where you did. And for stepping out into Diagon Alley. And for not, not… giving up.”
“You think hardcore Purebloods will give familial consent for their kids to just go out into the Muggle world?”
“Darling–“ Narcissa had begun, but one look at his face, and she’d caught on. “I absolutely agree with you,” she’d continued. “Lucius was always so fond of you, Archie, he knew all about the little problems of the shop, of course, but he still poured in Galleons, knowing he was doing you a favour. I can’t expect the same of Draco.”
Draco had kept the master bedroom, Harry had moved out of it once sleeping in the same bed back to back had become awkward. For seven years, Draco has never stepped foot inside what used to once be a guest bedroom. For seven years, Harry’s tossing and turning in a bed too large and empty for him alone has gone unnoticed.
He allows himself a mirthless smile when that thought crosses his mind- a Malfoy so unaccustomed to attention that he shies away from it, like a timid animal from a raging wildfire.
They’re lounging on the garden floor, clothes probably mottled with grass stains and bug juice, but for once in his meticulous life, Draco couldn’t care less. It’s nice in a way he never thought sunset gazing with Potter could be.
“No,” he says. “The branch shifted out here in the 1700s and bought practically half the land in the wizarding village. And then, gradually, they began losing it to pay off debts and taxes until they had only about half the original area left. And then 1876 happened and the French and British branches got to know that this line had been completely wiped out. No one really wanted to delve too deep into it, but once my grandfather was old enough, he came to see it.”
There are frowns in the pews. Draco understands the sentiment wholeheartedly—Potter threw the men who died to protect him under the proverbial bus to testify for Draco of all people. It’s bizarre and if not for the cutting straps pushing into his wrists, Draco would have thought he was caught in some fever dream.
“Harry Potter,” Dench says after a brief, pregnant pause, and the darkness swallows Draco whole from the way his chest explodes with fragmented light.
“I didn’t even say anything!” Potter shouts and Draco faces him to see him red in the face, lower lip jutting out the way it does when he’s upset and doesn’t want to show it. Draco feels guilty and then promptly angry with himself for feeling guilty.
“Potter,” Parkinson says, and Harry is jarred into reality because now that Draco doesn’t call him that anymore, he’d almost forgotten that is the name most people knew him by.
“Hey,” he asks, hesitating, not quite wanting to ruin the slightly lighter turn the conversation has taken. “When you took him away- thanks for that, by the way- did he imply he wasn’t going to do- whatever? Because if that’s the case, I’ll tell him he doesn’t have anything to worry about, he-” Merlin, it almost hurts him to have a civil conversation about Malfoy, “-he seemed pretty interested in his own stuck-up way.”
Luna sends over a floating Pygmy Puff to take the orders, and he asks for mint flavoured hot chocolate while Ginevra orders an Earl Grey.
She nods and hands him a cup. She adds a splash of milk to the other cups and a sugar to each of them and before he can stop himself the words are out of his mouth. “Potter takes two sugars too.”
“Wait till Slughorn sees,” he tells her when they walk into class side by side. “He’ll hate you for forcing him to acknowledge I attend Potions.”
Draco is a little taken aback. He doesn’t know how to respond so he defaults to, “When you write back, do wish them a hearty—”
“I’m proud of you,” she says. “You said you didn’t feel happy or satisfied when you saw him like that and you reminded me that you’re still–” she pauses, searching for a word and settles on, “–our Harry. Mine and Ron’s.”
The man—appointed by Kingsley, given that no one would voluntarily touch a Death Eater’s case with a ten-foot pole—had stared at the document with unrestrained curiosity. “Are you quite certain?” he’d eventually asked, looking uncertain and slightly nervous.
“That’s the vaguest bullshit I’ve heard all day and I heard that man at the leather shop tell us that wallet was sheepskin.”
Harry doesn’t know how to tell her that if the project doesn’t work out between Malfoy and Hermione, he will feel guilty about it for the rest of his life. It is indeed a brilliant idea, he wasn’t saying that just to placate his best friend. It deserves a good shot in front of the Wizengamot. It might stop some of the hatred and prejudice that caused the damn War and he’ll be damned if his hatred and prejudice is going to stand in the way of it.
“My treat,” he calls over his shoulder and wonders what precisely he’s gotten himself into when Malfoy falls into step behind him.
“I didn’t… ever expect an apology from you, Malfoy. And moreover, you did send that letter. After the testimony.”
It takes Draco a minute to process the request. He feels Dench’s eyes on the back of his head. He feels the holes being burned into his body from the weighted gaze of the Wizengamot. He feels the heat of Potter’s stare.
Draco doesn’t want to. Doesn’t want to see the gentle way in which Harry will let him down, doesn’t want to see that vitriolic undercurrent of disgust once again. All he’s ever wanted, he’s had in these perfect, unadulterated moments, and he doesn’t want to look Harry in the eye and let him see Draco fall apart when Harry takes it away.
Draco won Selwyn the case. He was sent out into the Wizarding World and given the status of a free man.
An involuntary smile tugs at his lips at the mention of Potter making a face. His own urge to smile confuses Draco and so he turns the letter over onto its blank side and writes a quick, Today’s fine, on it and reattaches it to the owl’s leg. It flies around Draco’s head a couple more times before pecking him affectionately upside the head and flies back out of the window.
The question catches him unawares, almost makes him believe that Granger has finally and quite officially lost the plot.
Draco hasn’t looked in a mirror for a long, long time. He’s been throwing on a glamour over himself, one customised to look exactly the way he used to before the War and given that he steps out into the public once a month or less, he doesn’t exactly need it often enough for people to notice the edges of his appearance winking in and out of focus. The Muggles don’t have the capability to notice and everyone else is so very determined to not look at him and pretend he doesn’t exist that even if they do, they move on. The only person to have seen him without the glamour is Potter because Potter has the unfortunate tendency to see Draco at his most vulnerable without even trying to but he has accepted that when it comes to Potter, his dignity must take a ride around town on a second hand broom.
Malfoy wakes slowly. His eyes blink open and close before he groans and blinks them open again. He takes in his surroundings and sits up slowly, looking for all the world like a big, blond, confused puppy.
He doesn’t want Granger to probe and as though reading his mind, she rolls her eyes and says, “You’re such an arse, Draco, I don’t know why I bother calling you my friend.”
Harry presses more kisses onto his overheated, sensitive skin and Draco stifles the uninhibited moans that rise to his lips, but he can’t help the whimper when Harry sucks at a spot on his collarbone. He cuts it off immediately, but it’s too late, the damage is done.
Having witnessed their entire exchange with growing happiness etched across her features, she shakes her head quickly and says, “I’m going to leave you two alone now. And I’ll come back up to call you down for dinner.” Just before she shuts the door entirely, she turns back to them, winks and says, “Have fun, boys!”
Parkinson’s eyes widen. Then her smile stretches, until it’s less smile and more teeth. “You both haven’t actually—?”
He doesn’t know who opened the curtains in his room, he makes sure to always keep them closed. It’s probably Hermione, Ron wouldn't bother.
She wanted to see him happy, he knew. He’d closed his eyes when she had gestured to the ring on his left hand two years ago and told him, “You are not happy, Draco.”
Harry kisses like he casts– with effortless ease veiling astounding intensity that yields all the results he wants. Within a few seconds, Draco is losing the last vestiges of his self control, gasping and reaching up to cup Harry’s face in both his hands. Harry’s done his hair up in a topknot with a few strands lose about his face and Draco twirls a finger in the one falling into their eyes and tugs gently. He feels Harry smile against his mouth, and the universe seems to snap into alignment for Draco.
Draco closes his eyes, and his entire being hurts. He tries not to cry but a tear slides down anyway. Harry removes the hand from his mouth and wipes it away.
Harry might have saved the Wizarding World but Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, the Weasleys, they are reconstructing it. So Harry had raised the bottle of gin in Ron’s direction, as though toasting to what he said and taken a healthy swig of it while staring into the fireplace.
The urge to give up is stronger than it’s been in a while, and a solitary tear escapes Draco’s eye and trickles down his cheek.
There’s that word again. Granger uses it all the time, says she has it herself. Says the panic attacks are symptoms of it, extreme symptoms. He won’t deny it, her help has been invaluable in dealing with the damn spiralling in public. Breathing, focusing, concentrating on the senses.
Draco shifts slightly and even in sleep moves closer to Harry, pushing his head up against his chest and curling into the circle of his arms like a cat. Harry knows as he looks down at the mess of blonde hair and soft skin that his lips are tilting up in that fond smile that Draco calls his stupid, Gryffindor expression.
“Does he know?” He asks her. He doesn’t really care if Potter knows but Granger confirming it would at least cement some of the uncertainty.
, Draco had told Hermione when she had sat down beside him and asked if he wanted to just talk it out with Harry. Divorced and in a good mental place with no romantic entanglements pulling at her from any side, Hermione Granger pressed the point with both Harry and Draco time and time again.
He knows Harry might be lying, that Harry probably is lying. He’s always late on Tuesdays, and most of the time Draco doesn’t bother asking, preferring undressing to wordplay. But today, it feels important to acknowledge that he has noticed, that some part of him might even have missed Harry in the moments that he wasn’t here. After all, every delay is precious time lost.
The girl he considers a little sister and the man he wants more than he has wanted anything in a very long time, sleeping on the couch, side by side, looking for all the world like they belong on his couch.
He wears grey robes, freshly laundered and pressed out. He feels better in them, more confident. He looks in the mirror and while he is still gaunt from months of eating far too little and sleeping only under the influence of Draught, he has filled out enough with his exposure to the trio to forego the Glamour.
He looks at Harry, who’s eyes are open and Merlin, the green in them is a faint circle around the blown pupils.
Hermione agrees and after fifteen minutes, there’s a sharp rapping on the window, a large Ministry tawny looking rather disgruntled sitting on the ledge.
“Absolutely not,” she says sharply. “These are working hours. I would advise you to refrain, but it doesn’t seem likely for you to follow my advice.”
“Because they won’t care about this?” Potter asks, gesturing to his own forearm, echoing Draco’s words from earlier in the evening.
Malfoy doesn’t seem to notice. “If Pansy hadn’t tried to hand you over to the Dark Lord, you would get along famously,” he says instead, shooting Harry a wry look which turns mortified in the matter of seconds when he processes what words have left his mouth.
Malfoy shrugs again. He looks uncomfortable and a little embarrassed. “I don’t always know what to think but”—he points at a completely arbitrary building—“that was Domenico Ghirlandaio’s workshop.”
He stops short at those words and through the fog in his sleep-heavy brain, the panic is the first thing that permeates.
This time he smiles. “That’s just it. By some miracle of magic, both of them survived. The girl’s accidental magic manifested extraordinarily young, at just eighteen months, and it destroyed the tumour. One moment she was swaddled in blankets, burning up a fever, on the verge of death and the next she was just another regular squalling baby.”
She looks at him and her face softens slightly. The harsh lines of her clenched jaw smooth out and Harry sees she has creases on her forehead from frowning too much. She moves towards him slowly and when her hand brushes his cheek, he leans into the familiarity of her touch.
“We are not a couple,” Harry says, feeling the heat of his own blush creeping down his face from his ears. “Whatever—whatever Malfoy suggested will do, thank you.”
“Would you like Pensieve evidence of it?” Potter asks immediately. He looks calm, but Draco can tell from the subtle baring of his teeth that he’s incensed.
Harry nods. “I wouldn’t call the second time surviving. I died. I went to something in the… after. But I could come back.”
“No one would want to service someone with the Dark Mark, Granger. Not even supposedly unbiased St. Mungo’s healers.”
After two more spoonfuls of blissful silence, Malfoy slams his own cup down and stares imploringly at Harry, casting unquestionably hungry looks at Harry’s cup, where the chocolate has begun to melt and droplets are cascading down the thin papery sides.
Draco pauses, unsure if he should continue, if Potter’s interested, if this is too much. He enjoys talking, especially about his history—Draco likes to revel in what he’s good at—but he can’t force the same expectations on Potter.
He doesn’t say anything, but he does spell the door unlocked and grits his teeth when the handle snicks and the heavy wood creaks open.
Hermione laughs. “Come on, Harry, we’d rather suffer a few nightmares if you’d actually wanted to come than leave you here alone to fend for yourself.”
“Look at what we have here,” he says, voice so low that Draco needs to strain to hear it. “So perfect. So unbelievably perfect,” he murmurs and it is all the warning Draco gets before the teasing brushes of fingertips on his dick changes to the overwhelming sensation of a warm, wet mouth enveloping him.
Malfoy has the grace to look a little abashed. “I apologise if I overstepped, I was merely curious.”
to be married to me?” Harry asks, incredulously, blowing his fringe out of his face to stare at Draco better.
“I have five,” Draco says. “We could sit together some other time and finish it off. I’d read yours, you could read mine and we’d be done.”
Harry snorts a laugh before tracing the claw marks on his shoulder tentatively with the tips of his fingers. “I think I know what this is,” he says. “There are only so many things it could be.” He looks up at Draco apologetically and Draco clenches his eyes shut against the onslaught of memories and nods.
He follows her out into the living room where Potter and Weasley are talking to each other in quiet undertones. It stops when they enter and Weasley stretches with a sigh. “As fun as it was meeting you again, Malfoy, I’d prefer not being here longer than I have to be. Even if I do believe you aren’t here to cause trouble. So I’m going to take this tea upstairs and go through some of the files from the shop I brought home with me.” He kisses Granger on the cheek and tells Potter, “Keep an eye on him, mate,” in response to which Granger utters a low, “Ron, behave.”
“I am not corporeal. I have no form. Therefore, under normal circumstances, I might have existed anywhere, in any space, at any time, in all of infinity. I am but a thought. When someone dies, they merge into me. Else, they wait and they– I explained this already. But ever since Harry Potter has reclaimed his mastery of me, I am tied to him. Everything– genesis, existence, death– is tied to him.”
“It’s your money too that’s going into this thing, Harry. If this Project passes, you’ll be a major investor. If you’re not there, it will reflect rather poorly on us,” Kingsley says, coming up behind Hermione.
Just as abruptly as he’d begun, Harry stops attending to his chest and brings his attention back down.
Lovegood lays a pale hand on her shoulder, and though her face if turned away from Draco, something about her willowy posture, the way she bends towards Ginevra like a piece of helpless iron unable to resist the forcefield of an industrial magnet betrays the melancholy he would find on her features.
Rolling his eyes at her fondly and then allowing her a grateful smile, he repeats himself, “What’s the time, ‘Mione?”
“I don’t want to talk about the babies right now,” he says, and his words are full of promise Draco knows all too well he’s good at keeping.
The door opens and bangs shut, and finally the Silencing Charm on the room falls. Somewhere far away, an owl shrieks.
“Brilliant,” Weasley says, kissing her on the cheek and smiling. Harry high-fives her and Draco after a moment’s hesitation hugs her tightly.
But Harry can’t bring himself to talk anymore. He can’t bring himself to answer Hermione’s anxious questions or meet Ron’s concerned glances. He can’t listen to Teddy’s innocent babbling or endure Molly’s strange, vacant stare.
Lovegood walks away, and Draco wonders what to do with his newfound knowledge that Harry hasn’t been mentally present in his relationship with Ginevra. With the knowledge that Ginevra has noticed, and that she is hurting, and that though some part of Draco, a small and evil part appreciates this turn of events, most of him aches for her.
Focuses his gaze on the photograph above the mantle. It appears to be of the Weasley family. Guilt threatens to overwhelm him again.
There had been no warning signs for this. The universe hadn’t sent him any and the bells in his head had not gone off. There had only been two bedrooms booked in Florence that eventually became one booked in Rome, there had been eyes meeting in the bathroom mirror over toothpaste and shaving cream, there had been Draco’s sweet tooth finding its way into their kisses, the lingering taste of sugar a constant on his lips.
It ought to be familiar territory, Draco thinks. Potter has always looked at him when he’s least wanted to be seen. Memories of Sixth Year flash unpleasantly through his mind and the scar that still tingles, pulses with life down his chest. But the War has changed them all and Potter’s gaze holds something different now, something Draco can’t place.
To realise his breaths are laboured, and his throat is aching, and his palms hurt from where his nails have dug in.
He’s sobbing and he’s shaking and suddenly someone is pressing a glass of water into his hands and he looks up to see Gianni’s watery blue eyes staring down at him, leathery face screwed up in worry.
Harry traces the claw marks on his shoulder before saying, “One of the Horcruxes. It tried… tried to drown me when I was in a lake. Strangled me, tried to keep me from coming up for air.” A fond, almost nostalgic smile finds its way onto his lips and he says, “Ron saved me.”
Draco laughs and though it is a beautiful sound, the note of disbelief in it is enough to set Harry’s resolve in stone.
“I wish I could say the same,” she says seriously, without even a hint of mocking in her tone. Harry knows if it was anyone else, he would be offended but this is Luna. And Luna is always, always honest. Even when it hurts.
He’s ready to cry when Draco pulls off and does the same to his other nipple, leaving Harry writhing on the bed with nowhere to go and everything to feel.
Harry seems to struggle with his words. “You, you made amends with us. All three of us. And you tormented us more than you ever did the castle. If we can forgive and move on, so can Hogwarts. Especially a place like Hogwarts.”
Whatever is in place of Scorpius’ heart drops like a stone at the words. “What do you mean?” He asks, concerned panic leaching into his words. “What on
There’s an unreadable look in Harry’s eyes. Instead of saying anything, he unexpectedly takes his glasses off. Then lifting his wand to his eyeline he casts a Temporary Vision spell. A fog clears in them, the green seems to impossibly brighten. And then instead of moving away or changing the topic as Draco had expected, he leans in and traces his tongue over the scar.
Scorpius knows if he had been alive, he’d have blushed right about now. There’s no proper explanation for that, but he would have. Honestly, with how easily he colours, he might as well have been a
“I’ll pay,” Malfoy says, words coming in a hurried rush. His face is pale and his eyes are wide. “I wasn’t looking and I can’t make up for your lost time, but whatever you—I’ll compensate.”
Malfoy and Mione look at each other. Then they look back at Harry and nod simultaneously. “Alright. Harry, you’re taking notes.”
“You were scared,” Harry says. Rage flashes over Parkinson’s features but she nods anyway. “And you did the only thing that you thought you could in the moment.” She nods again. Harry smiles, a little rueful, a little bitter.
It feels… horribly, achingly wonderful. The way Harry’s tongue drags over the already sensitised flesh, the way his lips brush electric sparks into the skin.
She sighs. “All of your dead, Harry, they’re floating around you, inside you, like ghosts. And you, you’re in their realm more than you are in ours! We’re watching you waste away to nothing and we’re watching you be-become a ghost yourself and it’s, it’s so hard to just stand here and watch…” She trails off and Harry realises with horrified shock that she’s crying.
“There could only have been one explanation for fluffy blankets turning up in the middle of the night with D.L.M stamped into the corners.”
Harry’s brow furrows and clears suddenly. “Let me,” he says and pushes Draco’s legs further up, changing the angle entirely. He shifts slightly, pulling in and out deep inside Draco and suddenly, all of Draco’s nerves are singing on fire as his prostate receives the full impact of Harry’s thrust.
“Except,” Draco says, with a derisive huff of humourless laughter, “all that pretentiousness didn’t keep him safe, and he’s still dead. At
Pity that he can’t say the same for Blaise– the insufferable bastard– lounging across from him on the armchair Draco bought specifically for the aesthetic of Blaise Zabini in a suit striding black leather, playing with his fingers. It’s too late in the night for Blaise to be wearing a suit, but he still looks elegant in sweatpants and a white shirt, drumming his fingers against the inseam of his pants.
“He did kill a man,” Draco says. “That’s bound to fuck with even those who have all their wits about them at all times and Potter’s hardly in that category.”
“Just a scar,” Draco whispers, meeting Harry’s eyes. Impulsively he reaches up to trace the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with the tip of his fingers. “Just like this one.”
They’re lounging on the armchairs on the patio, glasses of lemonade with a splash of vodka clutched in their hands. Gianni’s meticulous upkeep of the rose bushes is evident in the soft smell of them heavy in the air.
“When they find the leather pouch on you, they’ll find the nullified wand,” says a voice behind him, and Harry whirls around as the familiarity of the voice permeates his consciousness.
The force with which he spins around to glare at her almost causes him to sprain his neck. “Volatile?” He hisses. “I’ll show you volatile! Potter’s the one who goes around looking like one misplaced word would make him cast an Unforgivable and you call
“I know him by another name,” says the stranger. This time the words are serious, unamused. Scorpius even suspects them to be slightly reverential.
“If you don’t want to, I understand but my memories of this Lake aren’t that great and I would like to… rectify that. Will you show me?”
Training, Harry thinks with a bitter smirk. All that pure-blood pomp and show, all the haughtiness bred into him since he was a precocious child blooming into an insufferable bastard of a teenager. He remembers the way Malfoy’s laughter sounded—high and nasty across the Great Hall. He remembers, more importantly, the cool mask of Malfoy’s superiority settling on his face when arguably, he should have been at his most vulnerable.
“I thought the memory charms weren’t reversible,” Harry ventures, tentatively. Hermione’s parents in some little village of Australia are living peaceful lives away from Voldemort’s reign of terror and its subsequent fall, completely unaware of the daughter who left them there.
“Do it yourself. Oh wait, you can’t, can you? You don’t even know where you are and your Apparating license is gone.
Malfoy smiles. It’s small and a little reserved, but undeniably present. Harry wants to see more of it.
Harry’s hands are usually engaged in taking off Draco’s clothes during these first kisses. But when they finally break apart for air and look at each other with smiles that feel perfectly appropriate despite how out of place they actually are in their fucked up reality, Harry’s hands reach into Draco’s hair, his nails stroking Draco’s scalp gently. It feels a little too intimate, a little too hopeful and Draco knows he should pull away before this memory becomes something he can use to summon a Patronus, but he can’t.
Trying to remember what their argument had even been about, Harry mulls it over. “To be honest,” he clears his throat, “both of you have a fair point. We can’t present anything to the Wizengamot unless it precisely details our plans for the project but we can’t spend all our time detailing or we won’t end up with a project at all.”
By the time he looks up, dregs of broken courage mustered in the clench of his palm, Kingsley’s eyes are fixed on him. It’s assessing and cool as ever, indiscriminate in its neutrality. Nothing of his veneer softens when he nods once more, another sharp jerk before banging his gavel and saying in a tenor that brooks no argument, “Court is adjourned.”
By the time they calm down, the only sound in the room is the ticking of someone’s watch and the breathlessness of their breathing.
“Draco,” Granger begins and the apprehension is evident in her tone. “Harry really needs to start on his Transfiguration work and I figured I could help him so I asked him to come along, is that a problem?”
Harry’s forehead rests against his and when Draco opens his eyes, Harry’s are closed. He goes slightly cross eyes from the proximity but manages to press two gentle kisses to Harry’s eyelids.
The words die on his dry, bloodied lips, festering like poison in the spaces between his teeth, when her eyes roll back. She slumps forward, neck lurching at an awkward tilt, body shielding Lavender’s from the rest of the prying world. She lies there, silent and still, more blood pooling around her feet, soaking the steps in the stench of death.
Relief brings a grin back to Harry’s face, small but sure. This isn’t prejudice, this is understandable cowardice. This is Malfoy not wanting to get hexed, which is simultaneously familiar and deeply unfamiliar given Malfoy’s penchant to say the exact things that grated enough on Harry’s nerves for his magic to itch for a fight. So he says in a voice as amicable as he can make it, “Not the Muggle ones.”
Draco’s flicks a confused glance at the scar on Harry’s head and then it strikes him suddenly. The resemblance between them.
Draco knows his mouth has fallen open. He knows it’s ungainly. But Potter is—Potter seems to be genuine. And he’s still talking.
Scrivenshaft’s began stocking Muggle stationery soon enough. It started with fountain pens and notebooks, both of which had enthralled Draco. Gradually, with the resounding success of the products, they branched out, bringing in lines and brands of gel pens, post-cards, post-it notes, pencils and erasers, drawing materials. Muggleborn startups began writing to them with offers, newspapers accepted their advertisements.
“What you can learn is how to not trip on my feet while I lead. Now, if you don’t want to go to the Ball dateless, you will turn up in that Charms classroom beside the dungeons every single evening and spend at least an hour with me.”
“I have absolutely no idea why I let you convince me that this was a good idea,” Malfoy says, wrinkling his nose as he sucks banana flavoured gelato off his wooden spoon.
“The wife always knows,” she says, and the edges of the smile turn sad. “I don’t want to, and I wish I didn’t, but I do.”
Draco sighs. “I just didn’t think he would want to hear from me. I would have written an apology but after he had time to come back from it.”
She screams awake from nightmares where she’s pleading to Bellatrix to spare her, nightmares where her parents cannot remember who she is no matter what she tries. She has panic attacks when she sees too many galleons because it reminds her of the Geminio curse in the Gringotts vault.
“What’s new?” Draco asks, not looking up from where he’s rummaging through his notes to find Snape’s instructions on how to create Dreamless Sleep given that Slughorn just asks them to look at the book and be done with it.
On Saturday evenings, Malfoy turns up at Grimmauld and Harry takes notes of whatever it is the pair of them talk about. On some days its jargon that Harry has no idea how to even begin to understand and mainly misspells when writing and on other days he is a contributing member to the discussion.
Briefly he stops, and Draco’s blank, lost expression gains a little alertness. His eyes dart to the side and his fingers clutch at his robes for a split second.
Clutching Harry’s letter in his hand, he wills his crumbling mind to Apparate him to where he knows Harry will be, hoping to hell that the goodbye note wasn’t a suicide letter.
They head down the sidewalk together for Lovegood’s cafe, a quaint little space, circular from within with floating chairs and sentient tables rather cheerily named Moonshine. He’s been there before, to support her endeavours when she was just starting out, and he’d discovered it to be a surprisingly cosy space with surprisingly enjoyable company. It helped that Luna had asked freed Hogwarts elves to help her with the food, and the croissants and thick jam had reminded him of Hogwarts.
“The Curse did hit you,” he gasps, shocked. “It hit you right in the chest but when my mother was asked to check if you were dead, you weren’t. You weren’t dead.” He grips Harry tighter, not knowing if what he is saying should even be possible. “You survived Avada Kedavra twice.”
“You’re still you,” he tells Harry. “Still you. You never belonged to him. You don’t now. Especially not now.”
He shuts his eyes against the murky black of the room and it eases some of the pain significantly with the strain of keeping his eyes open gone. He allows himself to think and memories come back to him, as though passing through some fog in his mind. Screaming, but distant, constant screaming. Flashes of light. Pulses of fear that sent his heart racing. Hermione’s terrified face flashes through his mind and triggers a memory of Ron, stating motionless and falling to the ground with the impact of something hitting him in the side. Malfoy’s face, grim and determined. Anger, anger, white hot anger.
“I didn’t know that was possible,” Scorpius says. “Death does not just pay a visit to the living, like some sort of brooding houseguest.”
“I’ll be moving out,” Draco says, by way of response. Scorpius can’t help the startled gasp that falls from his lips. He knows he doesn’t need to hold it back, not anymore, but the wince that accompanies the betrayal of his true emotions is automatic. If he had been alive, it would have been unforgivable.
Except, he watches Draco hesitantly bring the ring to his lips, a hair’s breadth away from his skin, knuckles white around the silver band. Watches him put it back down. Watches him raise it again, close his eyes, and kiss it with all the gentleness of a man bidding a lover adieu in a casket.
Harry is coming to believe that Draco means it as a blanket promise, that sex isn’t somehow separate from who they are in their day to day lives. Consent is consent everywhere and Draco will not push in or out of bed if Harry isn’t ready for something.
“Hey,” he says, trying to sit up. It’s alarming to find that impossible. It’s not that he can’t feel his body (the Healers had said that it might manifest as a symptom as the Curse progressed), but he can feel quite acutely just how weak it is. He knows how much strength it will require to push himself up. he knows he doesn’t have it. “I have something to say to you.”
“We need you, Harry” Scorpius had once heard Uncle Ron whisper in the hallway outside his room. “It’s the nastiest piece of work we’ve seen in a decade and a half, mate, more people have died in two weeks than the last three months. Please, just today.”
“You humans,” Death says, shaking their head. “I never understand. Just when I think I’ve understood one of you, another comes along.”
But if Harry isn’t here or in the kitchen, there’s nowhere else he could be, so he must have left. Confusion creeps up Draco’s spine, wrapping his brain with it. No explanations float to him from the corners of Harry’s room, no understanding dawns upon him for the coffee cup still clenched in his right hand.
“If you don’t mind me asking–” he begins hesitantly. Granger looks up inquisitively. “What’s Potter’s deal?”
He turns away, remembering the darkening spiral when he had been in the Dark Lord’s quarters, waking up in the kitchen with Potter hovering over him. He brushes the memory away.
“It’s alright,” he tells her. “I’m not too tired, I barely sleep anyway. I’ll stay awake and if anything happens, I’ll wake you up.”
Draco blinks. Looks up. Blinks again. Granger’s face swims in and out of focus. His breathing is erratic, his heart still lurching inside his chest, wanting to break free of his ribs. He blinks again. He keeps blinking as hard and fast as he can, trying to get out the visions from the crevices of his consciousness.
“I’m here,” Draco says, looking her in the eye with uncomfortable frankness, “because Hermione categorically asked me to be. I have sent away fifteen other women who sat in that chair and looked at me and asked me questions. Everyone tells me
“Look Potter,” he says, suddenly weary. “I know you’d rather be with your friends or be by yourself in India or wherever else you want to go, or back in Britain with your girlfriend. You don’t have to stay here with some pathetic charity case of a failed Death Eater to assuage your survivor’s guilt or whatever it is that made you come up with this mad plan. You can go back.”
“He missed some classes,” Granger explains to Draco as though they hadn’t spent half of Potions with her ranting to him about Potter’s lack of motivation and will when it came to anything except wandering the halls of Hogwarts in the dead of the night.
, Harry remembers Draco saying. He ought to know better now than to doubt Draco’s knowledge of his friends’ tendencies.
“Malfoy, would you mind telling me your version of things once, please?” She asks, finally breaking the silence.
“Yeah well, I won’t be making that mistake twice,” he says, turning away and pouting like a petulant child.
Or at least that is what he tells himself every time Harry asks him if he wants a divorce and he says no. It is the one truth he has centred his life around, and he is unwilling to let it go.
There’s gravel under his feet one moment, cold linoleum the next. There’s a blurring forest in front of him one moment, chipped plaster the next.
Hermione gaze turns thoughtful. “There were a lot of families who stayed out of the War. They’re sending their children to Hogwarts now, surely they don’t want the school to be in shambles? In any case, that isn’t the point. The point is, you’re coming and you’re going to try and bring someone too.”
Harry is mute. He can’t help it, he can’t speak. Malfoy is so distinctly unlike himself right now that Harry thinks he needs to find a suitable bush to puke in. Instead, he reigns it in, meet’s Malfoy’s suspicious eyes and says, “No, I don’t think your magic is failing. I think your house trusts me.”
He wonders how she can be so calm, so reasonable, so composed as his entire world, his carefully constructed realities shatter to pieces around him.
“It isn’t me you need to apologise to, Harry,” she says after a beat, looking straight into his eyes, letting him know he cannot escape it.
“I was going for intense but all of those work fairly well too,” Draco says with a smirk. “Lucky me, you know?”
And when a third pair of arms wrap around them from the side, Hermione’s bushy hair tickling Harry’s nose and her voice saying Ron is too tall for his own bloody good, Harry laughs through his tears and doesn’t pull away up until Ron complains saying, “Harry, there’s snot on my damn t-shirt, mate!”
“Indeed it is, Pansy Parkinson,” Harry says, and smirks when she catches on and winces a little. “Why are you here?”
Harry’s fingers press into the sides of Draco’s neck, where the arch of his throat meets his collarbone. He’ll have to glamour the bruises away tomorrow.
“It is,” he says, instead of shrieking for Father to wake up. There’s no need after all. There’s no threat– he can feel it in the roots of his latent magic. “It’s Draco Malfoy. Everyone knows.”
Harry looks down at his hands, the papers, the legal jargon on them and the edge of Ginevra’s looping signature catches Draco’s eye.
“I’ve never spent Christmas anywhere except the Manor,” Draco tells Harry, wincing when he hears the tremble in his words. Harry turns, just a little, and beckons him closer. Draco steps hesitantly into the circle of his arms and finds his temple kissed achingly slow.
“I think we got quite a bit of it done, though,” she says, critically eyeing her own parchment which is almost full. “I have about seven inches left to write.”
The elegantly labelled bottle doesn’t speak, doesn’t poke him in the ribs, and most importantly is always up for a spot of midnight fun without complaining. Truly, everything Draco could want in a roommate rolled into one gorgeous bottle of amber liquid.
“Well, I’ll be seeing you around, then,” and Draco feels like a pardoned criminal, clearly dismissed.
Today they’re brewing the Draught of Living Death and Granger is narrating a story about how Ginevra hexed a sixth year and was reported to McGonagall who asked her to sit down and join her for tea.
They’re just Harry and Draco, on a sidewalk in Florence, shaking hands and smiling, a little hesitantly, a little euphorically, at each other.
Harry hesitates. He wants to, he does, they’re his best bloody friends, for Godric’s sake. He loves them too much.
“You humans,” Death mutters again. Scorpius wants to lob something at that annoying head, but he won’t be able to lift anything. It’s a pointless, frustrating desire. Instead he simply sits there, watching his father drink away half a bottle of Ogden’s Old in about five minutes.
Until Potter stormed in and ruined the surreal day Draco was having. Well, he’s learnt well enough by now that all good things come to an end.
Malfoy looks spent. “Potter, you’ve insulted me about a lot of things. My family, my pride, my criminal activities but please, don’t insult my intelligence. For one, there is no reason for you to turn up here unless it is to drag me back to wherever it is you want me and for another, the last time I saw you, you were a minute away from calling them into your own home.”
But Draco pulls him in again, his kisses all fire and marshmallow sweet lips and a hint of vodka underneath his tongue and Harry forgets all about inhibitions.
“Tell me what I can do. Tell me what I can do so this doesn’t happen again. So this never, ever happens again.”
“Do you know who it is?” He asks, and his fingers twist in the lacy edge of the tablecloth. “Who he’s…”
This time her smile is more genuine. “If you had to make it up to us for each of your fits Harry, you wouldn’t have time to do much else.” These words have the opposite reaction from the one Hermione had clearly intended if her amusement is any indication. Harry feels ripped to shreds by the grief that replaces the rage he was feeling minutes ago. She seems to understand and her eyes widen. “No, no, I didn’t quite mean it like that. I just meant that we’ve seen you at your worst and we, we haven’t made you make it up to us ever, have we? You will anyway.” She covers his hands with hers and a quiet, reassuring confidence tinges her words, “When we least expect it.”
Harry watches them drag Malfoy in by the scruff of his Azkaban-issue outfit—a misshapen white smock that has turned grey and brown in patches. He swims in it, collarbones sticking out, wrists knobbly and the rest of his body a vague shape beneath the unbecoming outfit.
“Prat,” says Harry, but there’s no bite behind his words. Instead, there’s a ready smile on his lips as his blown pupils slowly return to normal, his eyes beginning to turn back to the forest green Draco so enjoys from the almost black that made him weak at the knees.
She stretches her legs out under the table, and yawns. “Are you not sleeping well?” he finds himself asking. He regrets it immediately when she shoots him a sheepish grin and says, “Oh no, nothing like that. Just last night that we–“ she blushes and Draco holds up a hand.
Draco’s hands have reached up to Harry’s back and he holds on there, scrabbling for purchase, gripping at Harry tightly enough for anyone to assume his life depends on it.
He doesn’t know what to do with this information. When he thinks about it, he realises he feels sorry for her and surprises himself when he further realises there is no part of him that wants to see her suffer any longer. Enough of that has happened already.
He reaches down to unbuckle the belt Harry insists on wearing the Muggle way and feels Harry’s clothed erection against the heel of his palm. He pushes up slightly, with just enough pressure to draw a reaction out of Harry, but not so much as to hurt. Harry’s eyelids flutter shut and the moan that drops from his lips is as sinful as it is holy and Draco feels divine.
While Hermione and Harry spend most of their time in the house, Hermione occupied with reading and Harry with his… complete lack of anything else to do, Ron has been going over to Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes regularly for a while now. George who had drowned himself in bottles of Firewhisky and occasionally Muggle vodka just after Fred’s death, has finally after months managed to come out of his alcohol induced stupor. The last two weeks he had spent trying to get the ruined shop up and in working order, alone. It can’t be easy, Harry knows, a constant reminder that his other half is not there, and that he isn’t there because he’s
