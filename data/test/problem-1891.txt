"Will it be, er, on fire?" Draco shuffles his feet and grabs his elbows, scared of returning to the site of his friends death.
"Klaus," I say. "Your name is Klaus now, okay?" He looks at me quizzically with his pumpkin orange eyes, black tufts on the ends of his large ears pointing backwards, giving the impression that he's glaring at me.
Inside, elves run about, weaving around each other and sending up platters of dessert to the Hall above. I run past Cedric and Hei, wrapped tightly around each other next to the entrance, going straight for the back alcove. Blaise is cutting a length of wire to size and is about to hand it to Pansy so she can wrap it around the form when I reach them.

The morning of June fifth, I'm woke by Mother's gentle voice calling up the stairs, dripping sweetness.
In my bedside drawers I kept incriminating pictures cropped from magazines like Witch Weekly. I'd often pull out my small vial of Amortentia, breathe in his scent, and wank while staring at a bare-chested moving photo held in my hand. Needless to say, I'm infatuated. And Merlin, how I wish to see him in action.
"About half a minute," replies an eager, manly voice. It's Potter, of course. "Care to explain what that was about?" His eyes drift to my groin, my erection still straining to be released.
The others showed up, but to my surprise it isn't Weasley, Granger and Potter, but rather Granger, Potter, and Longbottom. Perfect. Filch leads the four of us down to Hagrids ghastly hut, outlined by the edge of the foreboding Forbidden Forest, telling us about how repercussions should be much harsher. Hagrid splits us into two groups and explains how he wants us to find an injured unicorn.
"Do you? Why is he with you? Where are your parents?" I stomp away the sneer of confusion on my face.
They sit in comfortable silence, calming their breathing and allowing the hot jets of water to cleanse them of their sins.
"Oh, yes, of course."
Obsessed is the only way I can describe how I feel for Potter. What started out as me wishing to befriend him (I knew Father would want me to have nice contacts) quickly spiralled into more - a simple crush to full blown fancying.
After much thanks to Dobby, we compose ourselves so we can eat with our parents downstairs. We walk in right as Mr. Parkinson finishes his sentence with, "and I used the Killing Curse right there, nasty little thing." Pansy inhales sharply. I guess that mystery is solved.
"Draco?" Reality comes back into focus. Potter has dragged me away from the corpse, a trail of our blood winding along the asphalt. "Draco." This time his hoarse voice is stern, commanding. It goes straight to my cock, despite the amount of blood I've lost. I'm dizzy, empty. The only thing that's real is Potter, kneeling in front of me, concern etched into the lines of his face. Oh yeah, he's talking to me...
"The wizarding world never had the Dark Ages."
"One of the main differences between us is that I get my desires filled quite regularly, but you'll never, never have a chance with 'Harry Potter.' Mmm, yes, give me more of your regrets. Tell me just how miserable you are."
"Look!" I yell out while running to it excitedly before squashing the emotion out of me. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."
"What? Did I miss something, Potter?" He drawls, oblivious to his gaping classmates.
"No," he said with a small frown.
Grandma Black was my favorite relative, quite possibly because she was the only one who was genuinely proud of me. All my life I've been told how I'm a disappointment to the Malfoy name, to my Father, to the wizarding world overall. But Gran Black was a proud Veela, and in the end it's what got her killed. I never got to finish the puzzle we had been working on together. For some reason, the puzzle she had given me is my most prized possession. The pieces are under my bed in the dorm, left in the same condition it was when Father yelled Avada Kedavra at my Gran.
Tears are streaming out of my eyes now as I think about everything I'll miss. Astoria is pregnant, and I was hoping to be a better father than mine. I hope she'll be alright without me. Except she won't be. Her disease is progressing faster than ever and she chose me, despite her family's wishes. She chose me as the person she wanted to live out the rest of her short life with. And I never made a move on Potter, not even after he and the Weaslette broke up. Not even when Astoria said she'd be welcome to having him join our relationship. I never attended Father's funeral, even though Mother had begged me for weeks, postponing his burial for my convenience.
He moved with ease, speeding down with an aptitude that shocks everyone on the green Quidditch field. Students screamed and I just hovered, in complete shock, as he grabs the glass ball moments before it shatters in the grass. I'm on my feet and I don't know how I got there, but Professor Mcgonagall comes out onto the pitch, striding furiously towards Harry.
"I'm not gay, Schlongbottom," Draco interrupts hurriedly before running out of the room.
"How long was I out?" I groan.
"Oh, nevermind. I just mean that you guys are more sex positive than Muggles are." A tense pause ensues, in which Harry shifts uncomfortably against the brick wall, Malfoys hands on either side of his head. "Can we... Get back to the snogging now?"
"Oh, yes... Shall we, then?"
"Then, I'll just barely keep you alive, cutting you until you can't think. Oddly, if you lose enough blood you'll float somewhere between life and oblivion... I hear it's euphoric, but I don't know personally." My mutinous traitor of a cock fills even more.
His tongue nearly chokes me as it delves into me quickly, tangling with my own in a frantic dance. He tastes of cinnamon and sage, of citrus and cashews, sweet and savory. I fear I may black out yet again, drunk on the feeling of him.
"So? How is it?" I whisper into the suddenly serene silence surrounding us before ripping her blade from my thigh and wrenching it at her.
I don't believe I got Blaise a present in return for my Kneazle, now that I think of it. He likes Nifflers, I'll get him one of those. Maybe I'll buy him a few if he makes me something. Hell, I'll buy three if he agrees to make me a new set of dress robes. If he did, he'd probably make me a fancy corset vest, the outer robes would have ruffles, the sleeves would open around my wrists-
"I'm really tempted to go sit on one of the stone ledges," he explains. "My instincts are yelling at me that I should transform and just fucking stare at everybody, watch over the room. Do gargoyles merge with stone to get a better grip?" Pansy and I are struggling to hold in our laughter.
She saunters to his office dizzily, eyes unfocused. The sound of her screaming son don't reach her ears. The belt slicing through the air escape her senses. She can't be bothered beneath the Imperius. This is fine. She'll get punished as well, and all will be fine. Lucius walks in, then the enchantment lifts.
"No, er.... How do I put this? He... I'm not sure it's my place to say this, but I think I have to? Neville is an asexual, meaning he doesn't experience sexual attraction? That's why he's my Feeder. I have my meal, he passes out and wakes up with spunk in his trousers and I run off to wank somewhere. That way we don't have to deal with sex... Stuff." He glances shyly to the blond, who looks up at him thoughtfully.
"Are" - he clears his throat - "Are you sure it's not on fire?" He asks, fear in his eyes. His gaze flits down to the floor, expecting to see bright red flames licking up from the bottom of the door.
"You don't know?" Harry shakes his head, still worried. "You went after my prostate immediately, it was intense. Just... Just don't do it that fast next time." He pulls his finger out and grabs Harry's black curls. "Please continue, both fingers this time... And try sucking on my, er, taint. It'll help loosen me for your - oh Merlin yes!"
"I'm gonna ruin your hair if you don't tell me how you feel," she states. "You've hardly said a word since the start of term."
"What is it, Longbottom?" I try to sound exasperated at him, but he doesn't seem to take notice of it.
"Potter, I-" he pants "-I need you too... Oh, just fuck me."
We're in my room, waiting for our parents to finish their discussion. Blaise already left with the Zabinis.

Slytherin won the House Cup, and the Great Hall is decorated green and silver to celebrate my house. It's beautiful, and I find myself smiling genuinely for the first time in weeks. Of course, Dumbledick decides to give Gryffindor hundreds of points because Potter killed a teacher?! The entirety of Slytherin House is livid at the Headmaster, as well as the "Golden Trio"
"What, pray tell, is your excuse for getting my hair wet, Potter?" Draco drawls out with a cold fury singeing his voice.
Bellatrix had gone insane. Andromeda got disowned. And Narcissa? She's afraid. Fear is all she's known. Her entire existence is based on hate, cowardice, and fear. And she mustn't subject her son to the same. She can't.
There's a new Dark wizard on the rise, leaving behind her a trail of limbs in dumpsters behind nightclubs, cut a la Muggle from those she's tortured; with new and improved methods, of course. Thus far, Potter and Weasley are the only people to have escaped her clutches and lived to tell the tale.
Maybe," Potter smirks. He fucking smirks.
They lean into each other, watching as a peacock flies through the stars.
comments make me UwU. also how do i italicize on this hellsite?
I begin coughing into the sudden fluffy cloud of silver and black. Apparently Klaus was ready to drop his coat, like Blaise had told me earlier. The fur enters every orifice to the point where all my senses are muffled. Dobby's voice carries through to me very lightly, growing louder as the fur curls around itself, twisting into very nice looking yarn, and I realize Dobby had been chanting a spell to spin it.
At this point, she's stopped hurting me physically, but I'm trembling. My arms are still bound uncomfortably behind my back and she's probing within my mind, voicing my greatest fears in a way that arouses me in the most morbid way.
"I do - Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree." Please think I'm interesting. "Know what House you'll be in yet?" Hopefully I sound casual.
It feels nice, to share this. I was scared I'd be embarrassed, ridiculed for allowing this hint of vulnerability. But instead it's empowering. I've shown weakness and it only made me feel stronger. Millie jumps onstage and bumps me aside with her hip (none too gently, at that) and takes a seat at the "Sharing Stool" as we call it.
"Breathe through your nose, mkay? Hermione read somewhere that Veela don't have gag reflexes, just wanted to see for myself. Just proves that she's never wrong." Harry inhales shakily before continuing, "Merlin, Draco, you feel amazing." Draco glares in response, held in place by the hand in his hair. He then closes his lips (and his eyes), forming a tight vacuum in which he tries to communicate his need. Harry moans, hand tightening in Dracos hair and Draco feels several strands part with his scalp before he begins to bob his head up and down. It doesn't take long before Potter is coming with a deep grunt, bucking into Dracos mouth while he swallows all the salty seed.
Harry sits at one of the couches in the eighth year common room, reading through the days newspaper, having skipped breakfast the day after the kiss. Somebody plops onto the cushion next to him, probably Ron or Mione. But then a very pale foot is sharing his lap with his Daily Prophet.
The feast on Hallows Eve was amazing as ever, live bats flew through the Hall, giant Jack o Lanterns flanked the walls. It was extraordinary, and I had to wonder if I could transform partway without being noticed amongst the many costumes.
Just as I'm stood on a pedestal, an older witch pinning my robes, another boy walks in. Now, I've thought Blaise was quite attractive before, but this kid was on a whole other level. His hair is darker than the night, his smooth skin the color of my favorite salted caramel, his bright green eyes shielded by very adorable(yet filthy and broken) glasses. I must have him be my friend.
"Well, maybe I am," he all but growls. "You look pretty nice in that button up, too bad it's gone now." Potter starts panting heavily, clearly uncomfortable but not making a move to stop it.
"Never have I ever...." Hermione trails off, turning to meet Harry's gaze. "I've never become obsessed with someone, stalking them around the clock, knowing their location at all times and losing interest in my personal life, justifying this with a hunch that they were quote unquote 'up to something.'"
"On your knees." I whimper. "Now," she growls, acrylics pushing against my jugular. When I'm on the ground, she positions my arms uncomfortably behind my back, murmuring a quick Incarcerous to hold my limbs at angles that, should I move, would surely cause breakage. The toe of her combat boot clad foot brushes against my groin for a moment before she kicks my stomach. I moan loudly, now perched on the ground in the most wantonly sit, toes pointed out on either side while my thighs are flattened against the musty concrete.
Dear Draco,
(also if hermione were white she'd look like the misterwives singer sorry i don't make the rules)
Shit.
"Promise to keep a secret?" He chokes out, voice high. We nod slowly, suspicious. "Ok so I was just, er, you know, smoking-"
The pressure releases with a pop. I guess he was Apparating, not trying to kill me. Not like I care much either way. He could decapitate me and I'd thank him.
This boy really is infuriating.
"Master Draco?" Dobby asks, making me return my attention to him. "Your father, Master Malfoy, is plotting to hurt Harry Potter at school this year."
vibe song: https://youtu.be/z4cYe_aVwS4
"No," he repeated. He's not easy to talk to, that's for sure. I want so desperately for him to be my friend. Hopefully I can charm him into liking me.
"Yes," I reply, sipping on my overly sweet fruity drink before pulling out my hip flask and adding enough firewhiskey to make an Erumpent woozy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Drunk on adrenaline, blood replenishment potions, and, of course, the alcohol from earlier, I have new courage. Boldly, I drop to my knees and shove my nose into Potter's groin, basking in his scent. Then, everything goes black.
The smile he received nearly blinded him.
Sparks fly from his fingertips and singe the hair on my back. His wandless will probably leave welts. But, Merlin, it's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. The last time I come I end up blacking out entirely.
"I sent a patronus to Ron and the rest of the team. Are you hurt anywhere else?" I nod, and he narrows his eyes.
"Ok, I believe you," I drawl. "Shall we visit the elves, then, Pans?" She nods and we walk on, Cedric going through the pear portrait right behind us. I turn to him again with narrowed eyes. "Why are you still here?" Pansy holds up a hand to stifle her laugh.
Not knowing how to handle his first transformation, she thinks back to her own childhood instead.
The blond wastes no time in leaning forward to meet Harry's brown lips with his own pinkish ones. They had locked themselves in the boys eighth year bathroom after deciding to lengthen their kiss from the night previous. The other boys in their year were either still asleep or eating breakfast and getting studying in, but it was mainly muggleborns and students who missed their seventh year down for breakfast, as it was decently early on a Saturday.
It was dead, silver blood gleaming in a puddle around it. It was a terrible sight. A vampirelike figure came rushing out of the wood to suckle at the wound on the unicorns side and I run away screaming. Will I ever be like that?
But for Draco Malfoy it probably will never happen.
My next appointment with Narcissa gives me an idea. She has gotten a lot more open and we have talked about her family quite a lot. Draco has been lonely growing up, and she blames herself for not being more loving towards her son.
"You have no idea how much I would like to just go to bed. But alas the bookkeeping needs to be done." Phoenix meows as if he understands exactly what I am saying. But that is definitely too much interpretation.
“Harry looks like shit, and I wonder if the fact that Philippe Belancourt has gone back to the MACUSA, without much notice has anything to do with it.” Pansy states in her usual blunt way.
“So all ready for me? Cherie?” Draco grinned at him
Harry loved autumn. He loved it when the days started with the crisp air streaming into the room through the open window, and the feeling of waking under his warm duvet. But just as he wanted to turn over again, the pop of Apparition resounded in his bedroom.
“I am not late, am I?” He murmurs into his companion's ear, and revels in the little shiver that his breath causes.
“When I called out for you to be handed over to Voldemort...” She shudders at the name and he sees how much it costs her to say it. ”I wasn’t thinking straight. I hoped that if you were given to him, that the people inside the castle would have a chance to survive. It was not my best moment and I am not proud of it, but I was afraid, and I hope you can forgive me.”
In the case that we are referring to Lucius Malfoy and his son could not disagree more on the nature of this bond.
“No I haven’t, I am still the same arsehole I used to be.” Draco snorts.
“Blaise—I…”
This is what happiness feels like, and he wonders how long it will last.
"Has my mother told you, when she wanted to return?"
“I wish I could say that, but it wasn’t a conscious decision. I’m just glad it helped you.”
“I’ll see you at the Dragon’s Claw?” Ron calls over his shoulder as he walks towards the lift.
He looks intently at Draco and he finds it surprisingly easy to talk about his hopes and dreams.
“Anhe what?” Harry is fully focused on him now and despite being in the almost same situation that he was before the potion, Draco feels a bit warmer being the sole focus of that warm gaze. It reaches something within him that he believed dead and gone.
Headmistress McGonagall looks as if she wants to say something but he is not done yet. Harry’s quiet presence next to him gives him the strength to continue. To voice what should have been said before.
Draco makes a hasty retreat from the room, settling onto the sofa once more. He is willing to try, but changing a nappy? Who knows how he could mess this up? Somehow he cannot imagine his mother changing a nappy in her lifetime, had the house-elves taken care of him then?
The flat is quiet. Not just the quietness of a home waiting for its occupants to come home. No, this is not a place waiting to alight with the sounds of a loving couple. This flat is too quiet - before he has even checked the closet, he knows.
After a while the weight on my shoulders feels lighter and I take a deep breath. Bowing down to Lucy I bury my face in her soft golden coat and cuddle her.
“If you feel like this still after tomorrow, you give me a call.” Pansy’s voice brooks no argument, and Harry just nods.
"So where are you taking me today?"
Draco sits down next to the bed, leaning towards the bed.
I swallow. Now probably is not the time to tell her, that it always ended at the doorstep, and that I have never taken any of these men into bed.
He would have gone on for an infinite amount of time in this manner.
“Especially on your birthday I know.” Harry quips. “I took the liberty of ordering champagne for you.”
"Tell me. I promise we will find a solution." Harry gently took Draco's hand.
Turning towards the newcomer, meaning to ask if he is going to be living solely of potions for the next couple days, but the words are stuck in his throat. Right in front of him stands the man that he hasn’t see in ten years.
I have found Tora. She has settled herself quite firmly onto Potters lap. His crups are settled at his feet and he talks to my cat all the while stroking her fur. The irrational thought that I would like to know what his hand would feel like on my skin, gets stamped down quickly. Even though I could quite easily walk up to him and demand Tora back, I remain rooted to the spot and listen to his words
“First of all, the voices are not in your head, but in your blood. And second, they felt like a song to me, when I heard it. No idea what it is like for you. I have been told it can be quite different for each one of us. But you will hear it louder in some parts of the Manor, and where you hear it loudest, you will find something to help you with your deepest desire.”
"Okay." Harry was puzzled. "Cast something small."
“It is just, Harry Potter is in your house…” He trails off not sure how to say what he should. “He and I have history…”
“Yes - I just don’t want to mess this up for you.”
"You are rambling and I am not Neville who loves exotic plants," Harry interrupted, and covered Draco's hand, "but I really would like to see this place that has you so enraptured. So lead the way!"
“Well, Harry and I are complicated.”
“I believe you knew deep inside that you needed help and guidance. And I am so glad that you sought Andy out, I would have needed a lot more courage to face up to what I know now. And there is no spell or potion I am under, I am simply well and truly in love with the person you have become. We are family, you, Teddy, Andy and I.”
“Merlin help me! Potter, a continuous breeze through the Gryffindor Common room to ruffle your hair and make Parchment flutter away, or an occasional rainstorm within the bathroom where you are supposed to shower anyway, that is a prank!” He raked his hand through his hair, mussing it up subconsciously.
It is as if he is dead and gone, while his body hasn’t received the message yet. He is but a ghost in the flesh.
Not only his wand felt complete when he was with Harry. He himself felt complete when he was with Harry.
"Yeah I know, apart from school robes I never had any made for me. Seemed like a waste of money when I didn't know if I would survive my seventh year." Harry turns on his heel and the robe flares out. Draco notices the slim waist and the shoulders. Harry has been a steady fixture in his life since the eight-year at Hogwarts had thrown all of them together and somehow they have managed to become friends. But still, to see him here throws him a little.
"Well, I remembered that you loved sweets back in the days and hoped that some things just didn't change." Harry grinned.
"No I just knew that HE could not win, and you have been part of my life for so long. I mean you have been a right pain, but I did not want to be responsible for your death." Draco shook his head. "So you have a tour-guide for the next few days. Is there anything you would like to see?"
“I’ll help you,” Draco replies. “It is the least I can do.”
“What I don’t understand is why you acted on the impulse, when you knew something was wrong.” Harry looks so crushed, that a part of Draco stirs with the impulse to reach out.
“Trust me.” Harry must have seen his reluctance in his face. “I would love to see your eyes, but it’s easier this way, for the both of us.”
As he walks towards the Pitch with his broom on his shoulder he sees the lone figure looking out onto the field. He doesn’t think much about it, just following the call of the potion as he reaches out towards Harry, and taps him on the shoulder. He has not anticipated that his date would whirl around wand drawn, curse on his lips. Draco jumps back.
“Come on then, we’ll have an early lunch.” They enter one of the small cafes that have sprung up on Diagon shortly after Voldemort’s defeat, which Draco points out to Harry.
"We can talk later, now you need to rest." Harry made to get up but Draco was having none of it.
“When Voldemort stayed in our Manor, he took delight in making me stay outside in the cold until my fingers were turning blue, my nose and ears as well. I never much liked the cold before that, but I could see the fun you all had. I remember when you  threw snow at my head once, when we were in Hogsmeade. But after the third time he had my mother thaw the frozen tissue, just to hear me scream, HE decided that the next time he would wet my clothes before sending me outside to freeze. I thought I would die that Christmas. So forgive me if I never want to spend another minute that I don’t absolutely have to outside in the cold.”
The existence of the peculiar piece of magic, obscure and just another more archaic aspect of family magic would have remained forgotten. If not for the machinations of one Lucius Malfoy.
"I am sorry sir."
Of course they were not satisfied with putting me in prison and keeping mother restrained at the house for the duration of my incarceration. No they also sought financial compensation. It is only luck that Lucius had invested most of our money in Muggle businesses. Otherwise the outlook would be bleak. As it is the Ministry has seized the contents of Lucius private vault, deeming that the biggest hit to the Malfoy's financial stability.
"We are good, thanks. But I need to talk to you about Draco."
They both look at me, but my eyes are drawn to Harry. I see the love shining from his face and I wonder how blind I was, not to see what has been right in front of me for so long.
Maybe he would need to be a hero for Draco?
"What do you want me to say? You know already why I am pissed off, why repeat it?"
It was the easiest and the hardest thing in the world, to grasp that hand and to close his fingers around it.
“You are one to talk. If you don't watch it, you will be arrested for indecent behaviour.”
"Ok, and what after that picnic?" Draco felt suddenly tired, but also a tiny sliver of hope ignited itself in his chest.
"So, you know?" I step up to him, grasping his hand.
Harry for once chose the cowards way, and let the communication dwindle out. What good would it have done to tell Draco that he had the wrong guy? That he was the only one who would ever understand him? He told Ron and Hermione to leave it alone, when they tried to get him to talk about his feelings. It was bad enough that he knew that he was in love with a man, who didn't return his feelings. So he contented himself with sending a postcard once in a while and Christmas cards. Just enough so that Draco didn't feel completely cut off, but not enough to really let him see how much Harry was hurting.
“Yes, I am taking your offer.” Harry looks straight at Draco and there is stark relief on the handsome face, relief and an emotion Harry can't quite place.
"We’ll leave them as they are."
"I didn't take him for a cat person."
“All you had to do is ask.” A melodious voice replies to his request.
“Draco,” Harry looks up at his… whatever Draco is right now is not important, but he sees the pain in his eyes. The guilt that he has conveniently overlooked because it had been easier to shut himself off from his surroundings.
He can’t feel. He has tried, oh, how he has tried to feel anything other than this numbness, but not even cutting into the disgusting reminder of his past mistakes over and over again made him feel anything. Dispassionately he watched the red blood drip onto the dirt, until his mother found him and cried out in distress. She healed the wounds and he just watched her out of empty eyes.
---------------------------------------------
There were days when his skin itched, all he could think about was shame. And Potter's presence made it all the more humiliating. He wished he had never met him again, maybe then there would be no more pain.
“I have to go.”
Is everything alright?
He made himself a cup of tea, he didn't know when he'd last eaten, but his stomach wouldn't take more than that.
The day before he thought about ending his life, he was going to do it, but he couldn't help having that stupid thought "if someone smiles at me maybe I won't do it" or "maybe I need someone to stop me, please, someone tell me not to do it". He never thought that someone would be Potter. Salazar, he already owed Potter one life debt and now he owed him another.
He knew he had to do something.
When he couldn't find anything and life became too much to bear. He found himself with his hands shaking and the blood was running through his fingers, he didn’t use spells to stop the bleeding or to heal himself. It seemed like years since he last did magic, he didn't have the energy for it, his wand wasn't working properly and it was too much effort.
Please, please, let me know how you are
“No!” Draco panicked “It’s me… Malfoy”
----------------------------------------
Draco didn’t want to end the call, he hadn't spoken with another person for a while, but was Potter at the end of the phone. Potter probably hated him and he deserved to know who he was speaking to.
"So Lucien," he started and Draco opened his mouth. "No, let me say this first." Harry continued on. "I loved the food, so thank you for sharing this with me. I admit I was surprised to see you here, but I do get why you use another name. Trying to go by your normal name would raise probably quite a lot of questions."
Draco took a deep breath. "I have no idea if I don't like it."
"He threatened you?" Harry asks "And you didn't trust the Aurors to protect you."
"I never took you for someone who loves fashion." He quips.
days. He has eight hours of sleep but still feels as if there has not been any rest at all. His muscles feel cramped and stiff, as if he has been running from invisible ghosts chasing him all night. Just the thought of getting up and going through his morning ablutions makes him want to bury under the covers and return to sleep.
“You ruined me.” Draco mumbles. “Nobody can ever compete with that cock of yours.”
"Oh yes!" Harry spilled all of his wishes for his stay and enjoyed planning his days with Draco. They sat at the beach for a long time, and Harry felt warm.
but his hotel was in
They both knew it was a lie, a curse-scar this severe would not be healed with normal magic, he would lose the limb.
When he came into the office on Friday morning, and got just another nod from Draco, he stormed into Ron's office.
"Can wands have glitches?"
"My friendships have not proven very valuable when it comes to my love-life."
“Cousin Draco.” He called and Draco’s voice answered softly: “Hi Teddy, did you have fun outside?”
“Have you done this before?” Harry asks while stroking the tender skin.
“Are you talking to me?” He steps closer.
And the rain started to fall.
“You will tell me with whom my son has entered the bond!”
"Of course, Draco,
“That was your first time bottoming? Draco I could have seriously hurt you!” Harry sounds horrified, but Draco knows how to reign him in,
Together they sit with Teddy until he begins to fuss, and even after feeding and changing him again, no amount of bouncing can calm him down. Draco remembers what has urged him to come to his aunt in the first place. He hands the baby towards his aunt, and pulls the little music box from his pocket. As soon as he enlarges it again, the box pops open. The lullaby begins to play and Teddy blinks sleepily. He stretches his arms towards Draco and Andromeda chuckles.
"Sorry," Potter said. "I just wish I'd been here to see that."
The head turned, and green eyes behind stupid glasses looked at him.
Potter drew his legs up onto the sofa and folded them underneath him. "I missed them. I needed to see them. I needed something happy, and when I read that letter, I knew I had to go."
Draco shoved his mug back into the cupboard and went back to his desk. But it was no use. The entire day was ruined, and he couldn't focus, no matter how hard he tried. He stood up and placed the forms and letters back in his in-tray.
"Yeah." Potter ran a hand through his hair. "I figured that might be for the best."
"Trust me, you're not my first choice." Potter gave a defeated shrug. "But you're here."
He rolled onto his side, facing away from Potter, and began counting in his head.
"Here." He handed Potter his letters.
"You know, there's one thing I haven't figured out yet," Draco said as they walked.
"No," Potter said. "It can be too hot for ice cream, but it's never too cold."
"I'm convinced there's a potion you can take for everything," Draco said.
"I really want you," he said, breaking apart.
"We?" Draco lay on his back with his arms crossed.
"Am I doing all right?" Harry asked.
"Where are you going?" Barclay called.
"I usually sleep better than I did last night, too."
He wasn't about to admit that to Potter, though.
"I can't say, but he did send me," Draco said. "I'm working on a case with him…" He paused, trying to decide what and how much to say. After all, Rutherford knew Harry. He could be guilty.
Potter gave a small smile, then went to the bathroom. Draco flopped onto his back and shut his eyes. At least the world had stopped spinning.
Potter nodded. "I can manage that."
"How—"
"You're not
Victory.
"There you are!"
"Not today."
Draco made dinner and spent the evening working on a 5000-piece jigsaw puzzle.
"Did you go to the Ministry?"
Interesting. That meant, by extension, Robards trusted Draco as well.
"My chest has been hurting again. Just a little."
Draco pulled away, gasping for breath. Harry became painfully aware of his own erection when he felt Draco shift, and stifled a moan. He drew his hands down Draco's back, taking in the shape of him, and hooked his thumbs into the waistband of his trousers. "So, when you said 'take me now', how far did you mean?" Just for good measure, he canted his hips, grinning when Draco's eyelids fluttered.
"Well, maybe Robards has a point," Potter said that evening at dinner.
He pulled away and sat up, breathing hard as he took in Draco's body splayed out before him, eyes lingering over the thin trail of hair that led to his straining erection. He placed his hands on Draco's thighs and pushed them apart, then settled himself down between them and ran his tongue up the length of Draco's cock.
"Malfoy, get in my office." Robards' voice snapped Draco from his thoughts.
Draco sighed. "Potter -"
"If you want to call it that, sure," Draco muttered.
That seemed reasonable, he decided. He shoved his hands in his pockets and started on the path.
"Business is fine, and they're for my regulars." He crossed his arms, hoping that would drive the point home.
"Not—"
It had taken a lot of effort and a lot of donations to various community programmes, but after two years, Draco had finally earned his place among the villagers. He was a local.
Draco noticed that all the couples in the restaurant were no longer engrossed in each other. Their eyes were on him.
"If you want it, you'll have to find it." He reached for Potter's hand and placed it on his thigh, over his pocket.
"They've got nothing," Draco said.
"Potter," he finally began, "what happened the day of the explosion?"
There was nothing to distract Harry from his thoughts as he lay in bed, trying to fall asleep. It didn't matter whether Draco had just sucked him off so thoroughly he'd almost blacked out. It didn't matter whether the sounds of squeaky bed springs and Draco's moaning played through his mind like a soothing melody. His thoughts invariably went back to time. It was insidious, and it fled so quickly when he wasn't even looking. And even when he was, there was nothing he could do.
"I don't want to talk about it."
Something was definitely off.
Draco knew he hadn't paid this much attention to him at the start of their assignment, but he couldn't remember what it was like not to notice Potter. His mind seemed determined to latch onto every detail, and more than once over the next week, Potter caught Draco watching him.
"That's not true," Draco said. "And stop stealing my biscuits. He doesn't know where you are."
a next time. We might be back home before the celebration."
. Draco gave a resigned nod. He could never decide if this was good news. "But I'm not doing that great."
Perhaps all of this was a sign.
"I'm not convinced this isn't related to the case you and Lawrence were working on," Draco murmured.
After three more days of the same increasingly awkward exchanges with Potter and no dinners together, Draco was forced to admit that it did bother him.
"But… But we haven't found anything. Nothing's been tampered with." Draco sat up, mind racing. "Though, if Barclay's the culprit, he wouldn't say anything." It couldn't be, though. "And this isn't an official safe house."
"I don't really know," Draco said, because it was the truth. "I thought we should talk. About us."
"No," MacDonald said. All the colour drained from her face.
Draco stood up and poked his head over the cubicle wall. "Some of us are trying to work!"
was written in plain lettering on the door. Harry let out his breath and raised his hand to knock.
"I'm not a Death Eater any longer."
Well, of course he was. "I'm not. And even if I was - which I'm
"That's not what I said," Potter said. "I don't think you have enough information, though."
"Can't or won't?" Potter's face was twisted in confusion and pain.
Harry wavered sharply between despondency and almost painful desire. He did some thinking of his own, trying to convince himself that Draco had a point, that it would hurt too much to be with him. He had lost so many other people in his life already - too many - and he well remembered the grief from each loss.
Even when Healers came in and found Harry, tried to calm him down, that was all he could think.
"Now flip yours over," Jeremy said.
"I'll think about it."
"I didn't think of that," Potter said.
"There'll be time for that later." Draco shrugged. He didn't care. Not any longer. They could be happy for him or not. His mother probably would be. He was less certain about his father.
"Then what are you doing in there?"
"I imagine he's worse."
"Well," said Potter with a very sincere expression, "I heard the coffee was really good here."
Draco read the log entry and decided that was enough. There was no need to mention the alcohol, or the drunken groping.
"I think one of us is supposed to pull over and allow the other to pass."
Draco drummed his fingers against the side of the bed and sighed.
Potter
They sat in silence and read their post until the doorbell rang. Draco realised he was starving.
"I'm only curious." Well, nobody could accuse him of not trying to make conversation.
The funeral was held in the Cartmel cemetery. Everyone in the village seemed to be there, and Harry actually felt grateful for that. It would have bothered Draco to know he had affected so many people's lives in spite of his best efforts. Mrs. Wilder had held Harry for a long time afterward, rubbing his back as he sobbed into her jacket. She was the only person he believed when she said, "I know how you feel, if you ever want to talk about it." She had lost her husband 20 years ago.
Draco shook his head. "Not right now."
Harry couldn't help laughing. "Who cares? We're adults."
"Better than being an arse."
"Yes?" he said.
"What a coincidence. I also have something important to say." Draco kept silent, so Robards continued. "I have an assignment for you."
By the time he looked up though, Robards had already vanished. Draco stood and, making sure his letter was still in his pocket, went into the sun-filled office.
"You would have me sleep on the floor?"
"I should probably mention," Potter said, blushing and pushing his pants down, "I've never done this before."
Draco let his towel drop to the floor and slid under the covers, where he waited until Harry returned with damp hair and no clothes. Draco's gaze fell to his cock, and he remembered how it felt inside him. It seemed as though much longer than two days had passed since then.
Evening finally arrived, and Harry helped Draco close the shop. He waited while Draco disappeared into the store room. Who knew what he did in there, but he emerged looking rather worse for the wear, like he'd been through some catastrophic weather event. Harry frowned but didn't say anything, and they walked back to Harry's cottage. It was a clear night out. It was probably cold as well, but Harry was so lost in thought he hardly registered it. Beside him, Draco was bundled up from head to toe, and neither said much the entire walk back.
Sometimes Hermione and Ron were there. Sometimes they weren't.
"He didn't believe me." Draco sulked and slouched into the sofa. "Nobody does."
"Water. All right. Well, I'll be in bed."
He paused in front of the shop window.
"You're the smart one, aren't you?" Randall asked. "Why don't you know anything?"
"I'm glad to see you and Potter haven't killed each other yet," Robards said.
Draco scowled. He wondered if Potter was still standing at the end of the street, or if he was perhaps trying to follow behind and eavesdrop.
The next morning, Harry woke up to snow falling outside his window. He lay in bed a few extra minutes, wiggling his toes and burrowing deeper under his thick quilt. He loved watching the snow fall. Everything seemed imbued with a quiet peace. It usually helped to calm his own mind when there was too much clanging around inside.
"No idea."
Draco sat at his desk and glared at Pierce's Stunned, floating body whilst Potter called Robards. Within minutes, he heard footsteps coming towards them, and moments later, Robards' irritated face appeared in Draco's cubicle.
a Death Eater. I'm not any longer."
Eventually.
Harry frowned. "So, can I have the tour?"
Dangling in the air was, of course, the question of whether they would even have time to put it together. Harry wondered if they were both thinking the same thing. It wouldn't be prudent to fall apart just then, on an otherwise perfect day, but the tears were there, threatening to escape.
Lewis waved his arms around as he spoke, and sweat lined his brow. Perhaps he was nervous, but Draco thought he seemed entirely too eager. His robes were very worn and faded as well, and his hair stuck out at odd angles. Couldn't he have at least put in some effort?
What should have been a reprieve from the song and dance turned into a massive headache for Draco instead. Potter made friends too easily, he decided. Draco flashed angry looks at him when nobody else was looking. But Potter, who was on his third or fourth pint, didn't seem to care. Or notice.
Harry's eyes went straight to his cock, which jutted into the air just above his own, then trailed his gaze up the length of Draco's torso, finally settling on his face. He reached his hand out.
Potter sat thinking for a long moment.
Nonetheless, his arrival wasn't terribly welcome.
Perhaps he'd feign illness. Why not? They lied about everything else to the Muggles.
Draco aimed the wand at Pierce's head and said, "
Once he grew tired of that, he decided to review Potter's case file and drink tea.
But it was difficult to avoid the fact that he'd wanked to Potter's photo. Especially when he started doing it every day.
"Good night, Draco."
Draco turned his head and winced in pain. He must have fallen over when Pierce Stunned him.
"Make your own," Draco said, and he stepped around Pierce. "I don't know how Potter could ever work with you."
"Nothing," he said. "It's nothing. Thanks for your help, but I've got to go."
"Did you ever touch yourself whilst looking at that card?" Harry asked. He brushed Draco's hair aside.
He just wanted to explode.
"Not even whilst working a case? Being on look-out somewhere overnight is tough."
Pierce grimaced. "Potter is responsible for Lucy's death. He should have been sacked at the very least."
It had been a long day, and even though the bed was tasteless and the linens old-fashioned, it was a relief to lie down and pull the covers up to his chin. The window was open, and the sounds of the night lulled Draco to sleep.
"Eleven."
Potter's brow furrowed. "Are you just that lucky, or what?"
"I always listen to you." He looked bored. "That's the purpose of our one-to-one."
"But I'm already involved!"
"What's going to happen once we go back to the wizarding world?" Potter asked.
He curled in on himself instead, closed his eyes, and gave in to everything. There was nothing else for it. Eventually, he knew, he would pass out.
Draco went to the back of the shop and unlocked the door to the tiny store room. Even though he was alone, he shut himself in. He sat down in the wooden chair at the desk, unlocked one of its drawers, and removed a jar of thick, blue potion that he'd been taking over the last three years. He unscrewed the top and downed it as quickly as possible. Immediately, his heart began pounding. A wave of icy shock seemed to course through his veins, and sweat beaded on his face. The world became tipsy, as though he'd had a few Firewhiskeys. He shut his eyes again and counted to ten.
"Too late to plead. You should learn to control the beast you made, before you can't anymore." And then he's punishing her, as well.
Firstly, he was extremely shy. He hardly spoke when there were more than two people around him, and tended to speak through somebody else (mostly Blaise or Millicent, but Daphne works too). Secondly, he gets really sad and cries for no reason before storms. He also sings in the shower before storms, but that might not be due to his ancestry. Another odd thing he had inherited is that his skin and hair repels ink, something that Augereys are known for.
You see, in the last seven years we've been out of school, I haven't been able to push these thoughts out of my head. Originally I considered them intrusive, but now they're just plain sexy. Sometimes they're welcome, even. If anything, the daydreams and wet dreams where he cuts me open and fucks my throat, covered in blood and pounding me from behind as he chokes me to death led me down a really fucking weird path of self discovery.
cedric about to make an appearance, and yes i love him. hufflepuffs are great. we love you. also, i renamed cho chang since its a racist name and to spite jk. her name is now Hei Chang, and she will at least be mentioned in this chapter. also the beginning is a memoir warm-up from writing class! YEET
"Why do you always mention your father whenever something doesn't go your way?"
The Express wasn't much different than last year. I sat in a compartment with Vince, Greg, Millicent, Daphne, Theodore, Pansy, and Blaise near the middle of the train, telling jokes and catching up. At one point, Granger came in looking beyond worried.
"Potter?" Draco whispers into the seemingly empty corridor. He feels eyes on him, but all the paintings and statues that used to occupy the seventh floor got destroyed by fiendfyre and war.
"Oh, hey, sorry," he plunders out, backing away quickly and looking worried. "Is anybody hurt?" He asks, grabbing Pansy's hand to inspect her arm before quickly releasing it, looking as though he got slapped. "I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have grabbed you. That was rude of me. Are you two okay?" We nod. "Ok, I'm glad." He smiles at us for a moment. "Oh wait-- I'm Cedric. Diggory, I mean. Hufflepuff. What's your names?"
"We're heading there, too," Pansy tells him. "What's that smell?" I hadn't noticed it before she asked, but there was, in fact, a lingering scent. Not unlike burning sage, it was spicy and earthy, bittersweet and stuck to my nose. Diggorys eyes widen, going from half-moon to dinner plate in half a second.

"Arms... Can't move... Fell off, I'm think..." My voice sounds far off, as though I were speaking through water.
"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?" Do they treat you right?
"Yeah, ok. Thanks."
"Oh," I say dumbly. "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?"
A clang of metal, a cauldron flying, red and white hair flashing, punches being thrown, spellbooks thundering to the floor.
"Bella?" Andy asks, voice quivering. She and Cissa peer around the couch to see their beloved older sister. Much to their horror, Bellatrix is on fire. She's sprouted gold wings, black talons, a dragon muzzle with sharp black fangs. She's not their sister anymore. She can't be.
“Can I kiss you?” The whisper is a gust of warmth on his skin, and he immediately feels as if he is burning from within. He knows logically that he still does not know what kind of potion he ingested and how it really works, but he is only human and he can’t resist any longer so he simply nods. Harry’s lips are chapped and a bit dry but at the same time so soft that Draco feels immediately addicted.
“Yes, let’s go flying!” And he is racing through the sky feeling alive. Over the next few weeks he spends more time with Harry, although he is careful not to instigate too much touching. He still hasn’t figured out what potion he has been given and he doesn’t want to take any chances.
"Oui, oui!" A voice rang out from the back and Harry's breath stuttered. It couldn't be. Surely he had misinterpreted the voice. He stared at the figure emerging from the kitchen. Broad Shoulders a muscled lean back, that tapered into a narrow waist and long legs. Harry's throat felt suddenly very dry. But it was the blond hair that made him freeze. Harry kept thinking that it just was a trick of his eyes. when the man who had answered her, placed the steaming bowl which emitted a delicious aroma in front of Harry, there was no denying it any longer. He looked directly into the grey eyes of his former school-rival.
And that is the last thing they say until Andy returns and Teddy calls for them to play with him.
"Yes, I think that is the name she called out., and you keep mention the name too."
“That is surprisingly deep, coming from you,” Draco quips, trying desperately to defuse the strange atmosphere between them.
"If your father wasn't dead already, sometimes I would happily kill him for you." She states what he feels, and Draco's laugh is a balm for his soul.
has erupted and left you dead and dry inside, I felt like the
"Well if you are sure, we have intelligence on a potions smuggling ring. I need you to get into it. No contact with family and friends for at least two months. Think you can handle it?"
A startled laugh rips from Draco's mouth and he conjures two plates. "You remember my weaknesses well." He motions for Harry to sit at a small table, which he has positioned at the side far away from the fabrics. Harry nods and begins to dish out the food while looking at Draco with seriousness now.
The club is loud, louder than Draco has expected and even though he feels comfortable with the stares and the come ons most of the time, tonight  is different.
Healer Montrose turns serious. “Even though we expect a full recovery, it will take several weeks with a strict regimen of potions, to achieve this. We are lucky that Mrs Tonks has had several health issues that her magic has not healed but merely suppressed until her magical core was so weakened that she collapsed."
“What?” Harry blushes up to the roots of his hair. “Why would she think that!”
Harry just shakes his head. “Did it ever occur to you that I might have broken up with her, because she expected me to become an Auror, just like the rest of the world? That I realised that spending time with you, meant more to me than it should, if I declare myself entirely straight? That I wouldn’t sleep with you in one bed if I didn’t feel comfortable with it? Draco, I could throw off the
God, I am tired, but tonight I have to get the books in order. That was something new for me as well, the Muggle Tax system. I am just glad that I learned quickly, otherwise, I might have ended up in jail for something that I honestly did not know.
The glass in front of me is not yet empty and Harry has already found me. Sometimes I wonder if he has a Tracking Charm upon me, but then again I might have grown to be somewhat predictable during the last five years.
Draco took the wand hesitantly, but the feeling of the wand was warm and friendly again. Casting the spell softly, he watched as the small cut over Harry's brow knitted itself back together.
-----------------------
Harry blushes violently, but doesn’t comment. He silently hands him the dish with his food, and plops down on the couch. They eat in silence, and Draco is grateful for the reprieve.
“May I see the box? Maybe I can help, you know, a fresh pair of eyes?”
"Can I see her?" I feel cold sweat running down my back, and it is only Tora who keeps me from freaking out.
“Of course, you know me, for Pansy I would turn straight”, Harry grins.
“Well, there is no one else around is there?” she quips.
Harry nods. "Can we sit down? I do owe you an explanation."
"She is here with me. Won't you come and sit with me for a while?" The tone is soft and in light of what he has just said I answer in kind.
"Magicis Nexum by Tiberius Black" he read the title, frowning at the Latin title. "Tibby, are you sure?"
My heart aches at the sight in front of me. Luna and Draco are so caught up in their discussion that they don't notice me, but it seems to be intense. Luna looks sad, as if she would like to help but doesn't know how and Draco? He looks defeated, and he holds the soft grey cat close as he walks away. Much later I will realize that seeing him so lost holding his friend close, I finally understood that Draco Malfoy had been hurt by the war as much as I had. He didn't refuse my hand to spite me, didn't try to pay me back for our schoolboy squabbles. He simply didn’t know how to act... But what have I done to deserve his ire then? His exhausted words ring in my ears.
"Nothing worth mentioning." Draco sucked his index-finger where he had noticed a tiny drop of blood smeared.
"Ouch!" Gingerly he sat up. The cup was broken, he was soaked with hot tea and his right hand hurt.
Life is far from perfect for us, but as Luna once said to me. It is all a matter of healing .
I am relieved and make her, the coffee that she usually drinks when she tries to pay for it, I decline. "You can stay and keep me company while I eat." I set Phoenix on my lap again, since he has meowed plaintively at being left out. I eat and feed him little scraps of my ham, while she sips the coffee.
Harry doesn’t listen; he is too busy observing the pale boy as he assembles his workstation for potions. Draco is doing all the right things, but the spark that made up such an integral part of him, seems to have fizzled out.
He focuses on the menial task of setting up water, spooning out tealeaves, pouring milk and setting out sugar. When he is done with the mugs, he is calmer again. Stepping out with the tablet he sees two heads bend together talking seriously. He puts the mugs down and settles across from his visitors.
I think hard about the day. But there is nothing that comes directly to mind.
“And nothing bad happened until Mr Malfoy retaliated with the Breeze Charm.”
"What do you say, Teddy? Are you ready to have a fun day with Harry and me?" Draco asked his cousin, while nodding at Harry indicating that yes, he knew where to go.
He stepped into the flames, not quite understanding what Tibby was mumbling, but he could have sworn she uttered something close to, "So it begins."
"Thank you," Draco bit out, but pulled the cup towards himself.
I feel like a complete new human. Weeks of spending all of my free time in the park and playing with Lucy have alleviated my nightmares. I talk more freely and have gained at least a stone in muscle, from all of the exercise.
He freezes again.
“I wonder if you’ll ever smile at me like this,” Harry grins.
“Hello Malfoy,” Potter breaks the silence after painful moments have passed. Still his words fail him, it is not as if he is silent otherwise, but with Potter he has always had the tendency to put his foot in. Of course most of the times he wanted to antagonise the other boy, but right now he wishes for invisibility. Knowing that this is not an option he just nods towards Andy and Potter and turns away, towards the desk where he puts his paperwork down and starts to work silently.
"Tibby, is being very sorry, but Master Harry is needing help."
Surely some day in the future their children will record their own bonds in this very tome. Let us hope that in their cases Draco and his sons will not disagree on the nature of these bonds as much as he and his father did.
"So I watched him grow into the wonderful man that he is now, and I knew him safe from your attempts to marry him off against his wishes. I was so proud when he stood up against you again and again. And yes I love him, and I would do anything to protect him from your machinations."
"Malfoy! Please stay!" The man has gotten up from the floor and stretches his hands out.
* * *
It is quiet in the office for a long time after that. One could probably hear a needle drop, and Draco looks at the Headmistress until she turns her eyes away. Ginny looks so small in her chair, broken in another way.
Harry then picks up speed. Playing Draco's body like an instrument he wrings curses and pleas from his mouth. His cock is rock-hard again and he wraps his own hand around it, stroking it harshly, until he can't hold his orgasm any longer and spurts onto the sheets. Harry moans brokenly at the feeling of Draco's channel contracting and comes with a shout shortly after Draco has finished.
Harry kisses him softly. “She sees that you make me happy. You make my soul sing, no matter how corny that sounds, and I waited so patiently for you to touch me, but I would be happy with just lying in bed with you and hearing you breathe evenly.“
Relieved, he opens the collar and takes off the robe, leaving him in a button down and neatly pressed trousers. As he sits down, he takes care not to jostle the music box too much, lest it open too early.
"That is better than what Ollivander told me. He basically told me to buy a new wand. And I don't want to give up on this wand."
"If you don't mind teaching me?" Harry is still shell-shocked, but excitement begins to weave its tendrils through his body.
“It is snowing! Everything is white outside, I wanna play!” Teddy bounced on his toes.
“Are you even gay?” Harry grinds out and there is a horror in his eyes that makes Draco wince.
“I am sorry, I need to get back to the Manor for a bit,” he throws out without a thought or two. “You can manage with Teddy?” Without looking back he Summons his things and Apparates back to the empty Manor. He throws up the wards that won't let others pass and collapses onto the cold stone floor.
The parchment in my hand speaks a clear language. He has gone and done it again, it is not the first time he has tried to force a marriage on me. But now he has gone too far.
“Well, nephew. Please put Teddy to bed, I tried everything today, but he wouldn’t have it.”
When he came to again, there was a soft humming sound in his ear. As if someone was singing along to a song, under their breath.
Draco pushes the letter ahead of himself until Samhain has long passed, and Yule is in the air when he finally sits down and writes a short missive. It is painfully formal, but he doesn’t dare address her in an overly-familiar way, afraid of overstepping the boundaries.
“Mr Potter, you need to let Mr Malfoy guide you.” Professor Hamish has shown up after watching for what feels like an agonizing eternity but can only have been a few minutes. “Take a look.”
“Why? Because you accepted Ron and his family as yours?” Draco shakes his head and holds up his hand to interrupt the argument Harry is about to make. “I think by now you have accepted that they are your family, but not when you were a child. Think about it. I am not judging, and you should rest now.”
. You are lucky that the volcano is quiet at the moment, and accessible. In nineteen-ninety eight there was a big outbreak and it was closed off."
“I wish I didn’t have to ask this, but it is important.”
“Harry! Can you take Teddy? I need to clean myself too!” He is sure his face is going to explode when Harry opens the bathroom door.
He wakes in the middle of the night, sure that he has heard Teddy call out, but once in the room he only hears the soft regular breathing and sees the soft pulsing light that the music box emits. He heads back to bed and snuggles back under the warm blanket, lulled to sleep by Harry’s regular breathing.
When they stand outside, Harry cocks his head, as if waiting for something.
The rest of the night is spent plotting and laughing and Draco’s heart feels a bit lighter by the end.
The doorbell jingles softly when he enters, and the enticing aroma of coffee and freshly baked scones waver over him. Draco looks up, with a friendly greeting on his face, which morphs into a glow of happiness that makes his heart stumble.
“Ok, on your hands and knees. It is easier that way!” There is no room for argument in his voice and while Draco would prefer to see Harry's face when they do this, he doesn't want to argue.
* * *
since it is the only place that is openly for a gay public. I know most people on the island, and there are not that many. Usually I only hook-up with tourists, who leave again."
"What? That I am bound to you? That the bond we have made has prevented your father from messing with you?" He smiles and I swallow.
Draco knows that his subconsciousness is trying to show him something. He has no desire to go back to Hogwarts, facing the justified slurs and hostility against his family name  would definitely be too much, but the memory of working with potions is growing more prominent. Maybe he should start to look into the correspondence NEWTS and apply himself to that field of study. Even if he can’t work as a Healer, he might be able to work on potions for Healers, or he can pursue the idea about working in magical restoration, as he has talked through with Pansy.
My girls and I do a lot of groundwork with traumatized people, but Draco and his loneliness are never far from my mind. I really need to find a way to get him to talk to me, but I fear that he will avoid me, if there is not a really valid reason for him to stay with me.
Draco nodded. "I do go to a club sometimes when I want to pull. But I have to drive to
Until then he needs some more rest, and Harry softly hums the melody of the music box—the melody of his life.
He would go and eat, and then he would send of his owl, to set up the meeting with Draco. He would figure out what Draco thought to make of this without talking to Bill. If it came to nothing, he didn't want to face the friendly ribbing, he would get from him. And if it came to something, he would like to do it at his own pace.
charm that had kept him dry during his brisk walk from his office at Gringotts. Autumn in London unfortunately meant not only sun, but also rain. Without the charm he would have looked like a drowned rodent.
"So you can understand me." the cat definitely nods at that.
"Draco." That is Harry again, and when has his hand found mine? It is warm and comforting, and suddenly I feel an intense longing. But I pull my hand away, and smile at him.
"Where do I start?" Harry wonders for a moment. "I got injured in a raid. Badly as you had seen. My wand was gone and my emergency portkeys had malfunctioned and dropped me in London, not at St Mungo's. I dragged myself towards the hospital when my body gave out. My magic must have decided to turn me into my animagus form since that is smaller and doesn't bleed out as quickly, but since I was so weak it turned me into a kitten. You found me and cared for me. I couldn't turn back until I was fully healed. Which actually was this morning, I didn't just want to walk out on you, so I turned back. Since you had figured out I was an Animagus, I didn't want to lead you on. So here I am at your mercy."  Somehow the last bit sounds more playful than he wanted, but it is the truth.
"Your second name is Lucien?" Harry asked.
The day before he had tucked his cousin in and had tea with Andy, as she insists on being called, he had planned to catch up on schoolwork and therefore had to excuse himself early. He had been apologetic but Andy said she understood. After dinner he had settled into the library, only to be roused by Mipsy, who had led him to the foyer.
Maybe even travel a bit, even though he feels it in his bones that he can’t leave the Manor just yet. He has to stay and fix something. Although he doesn’t quite know what it is. Knowing his ancestors, they cursed the place so that at least one Malfoy has to remain within its walls to take care of it.
His voice had risen considerably and his hands itched to wrap around the neck of the smug, grinning goblin across from him.
"Relax. I am glad it worked, do you want to give the replacement wand back right now?"
They kept kissing for a long time. But then Draco pulled away and regarded him with bright eyes.
The sun warmed them up quickly enough and Harry smiled at Draco, reaching for his hand and holding on for the trip back to the car.
Harry cocks his head and looks at Draco with that boyish smile that has never been directed at him before, at least not with such promises of intimacy.
“It seems that Mr Zabini and Miss Weasley have been overheard and seen dropping a potion into your drink.”
Autumn had come early this year. It was wet and cold, dark even though it was only four o’clock in the afternoon. The steady drizzle added to the feeling of gloom that permeated the air. It suited his mood, as he walked through the empty street. The conversation he just had at Ollivanders played in his mind again and again.
"Nice." Draco blurts it out before Harry can cover himself, and he cannot help it he begins to laugh helplessly "Oh Merlin  I am so sorry." He brings out in between peals of laughter, before grabbing a blanket and handing it Harry.
When they drove back, Draco indicated for Harry to stop shortly after leaving the plain
It takes a long time for Harry to be himself again. And then he keeps apologizing, when Draco doesn’t want him to.
He does this so well that when he raises his head a little he realizes that he really
As he drifts back to sleep he knows that not all is well by far, there is still the question of his future work and Harry who is still unsure about his own place in life. There is the issue of Ronald Weasley and his problem with their relationship, but all of these issues will find their resolution through time and communication.
"Right, and we have gotten good at being good together haven't we?" Draco sounds unsure. "I know we bicker, and I am not that open with my emotions, but I have been trying."
Or the way that Narcissa and he are slowly beginning to talk with each other, about substantial things, about the way they want to rebuild the Malfoy name, but without the pressure that Draco would have experienced would he have to decide alone. I am happy to see how Narcissa reigns the expectations in that Draco is setting for himself, reminding him gently that only his happiness is her goal and a way to live in comfort, not the extravagant lavishness that Lucius provided.
“Come inside.” It is so easy to spread his legs and offer his body up for the taking. Harry won’t hurt him. He is the epitome of warmth and love and it feels right to give himself to this man.
“Was any of it real?”
"It would be very hypocritical of me, to be angry at you now. After all you came back for me once through Fiendfyre because I was in over my head. But I wish you would stop trying to prove that you are a hero. The entire world knows it. But I would prefer to have you alive."
“No, I am sorry Mother.”
"Yes Harry although I really wish you would stop referring to yourself as ordinary." Draco shook his head a little, before a mischievous smile flitted over his face. "You never asked what my first boyfriend was like, but if you had I would have described him as a little shorter than me, with tousled black hair and green eyes. Trust me, it was a shock for me as well when Pansy pointed out that I was dating a poor Potter Lookalike." Draco moved closer "I came back as soon as I finished my education, but when I actually saw you, I froze. I just didn't know how to address what was going on. And come on I am a Slytherin, just throwing my feelings out there is not my forte, but before I could work a way out to gather the information I needed. You were fleeing the office and your best friend was tearing me a new one. And I had two months to come to terms with the fact, that you like me as well. Do I need to get more obvious? I thought you are the brave one here?"
Harry obligingly trudged along, mentally going through the cases that had been put on hold. This was his only excuse for not realizing who stood in the Auror Office, his back to Harry, avidly talking to Ron.
He skidded to a halt on the grimy floors, and took the salon in. The stench of decay was even stronger in here than it was in the entrance hall. The walls were covered in green mouldy wallpaper, the windows covered in grime. Bill stood a couple feet away from ornate carved doors, covered with impressions of chimeras and basilisks. Draco shuddered.
"You care about me?"
“I would like to take another dose, maybe half to see how it affects me now that we…” he blushes and wonders if that is another after-effect of the potion.
"You are a prat." it just broke out of him, but when Harry's eyes dimmed, he grabbed his hand, lest the man did something rash again and disappeared. "But you are my prat. And trust me when I say, that you will spend the rest of your life making up for the misery that you have put me through. I will collect on each thing that you admitted to owing me. AND I reserve the right to hex Hermione silent if she goes off on me again,"
And then it was over.
Draco feels dizzy as they land in the living room of Harry's flat. He knows the room, the soft colours that are so much more tasteful than he had thought. The earthy tones soothe a troubled mind, and he feels a little calmer already. He turns toward Harry and find him studying his face intently.
Not many people know about the existence of this peculiar piece of magic. Obscure and just another more archaic aspect of family magic. It might have even been forgotten entirely if not for the machinations of one Lucius Malfoy.
“That was amazing, Draco.” He kisses him softly and Draco settles against his chest.
---------
It has been remarkable, and Draco has stopped lying to himself, he wants Harry as much now as he did years ago. But having Harry's friendship itself is a heady thing and makes it ok to keep this professional for a while longer.
Harry exhales softly, and hugs Draco closer.
"Well, you should take that complaint to my boss. He works me to the bone you know?" he quipped.
Harry Potter smiles at me.
"Yes, that would be fine." Draco took his outer robe off.
Kingsley looks at him with something akin to kindness in his eyes and Draco feels his world shift again. Well maybe Potter will say something in his favour and he can hope for a shorter stint in Azkaban. He probably should respond to the inquiry.
Draco grimaces and there is a tacit understanding that just because the two of them have grown to like each other, and Harry is still not quite sure just how that happened, there is still a long way to go on the road to healing.
“A little warning would have been nice.” Draco breathes deeply, only to catch a full nose of Harry’s cologne. The woody scent makes Draco’s head spin. And he drifts subconsciously closer to the other man. Harry coughs a little and nudges him softly.
"You are doing it again!" I am angry all of a sudden and only the weight of the crups keeps me where I am. "How can you sit there and say you care about me and at the same time threaten to leave me alone? Mother, I don't want to be alone! I want you to talk to me, to be there for me for once! Do you know how happy I was to hear you laugh when I came to visit you? And then I realized that is was because of them, and Potter here." I blink because suddenly my eyes brim with tears and I will NOT cry in front of Potter. "I would have done anything to be able to make you laugh like this."
And that is the last thing he hears before everything goes black.
“I am not hiding,” he states flatly. “I just have no energy to move.”
Harry nods. "Can we sit down? I do owe you an explanation."
Headmistress McGonagall raises an eyebrow at him, in a way that makes him think of Malfoy for an absurd second.
“Stay...” The other man—his lover—implores half-asleep.
"Did you?" Bill asked again, and the piercing blue eyes did something to his innards. Draco felt like he was in a body-bind from head to toe, unable to do anything but nod. Nothing else would have been possible.
He splashed water at his face. "Okay you are going to fix this."
“Are you alright sir?” One of the recruits has stepped forward in alarm.
By now he is alone in the room that he shares with the other returning eight years, but that too is a normal occurrence. He gets dressed, grabs his satchel and leaves for breakfast, because that is what he is doing every morning.
He dresses just as quietly and walks towards the Great Hall for breakfast. He is one of the earliest risers, only a few students already up and awake. What surprises him most is the huddle at the end of the table. The former Slytherins are already up. Draco is leaning heavily on Pansy and sips tea looking only half awake.
Over the weeks the bags underneath his eyes, grew more and more pronounced, and his movement became sluggish. Still he forced the wand and his magic to do what he needed done.
"Not weakness, dedication and passion."
"Tibby!" Harry called as he settled his companion on the sofa.
Harry takes his time, stroking his channel with warm fingers, touching a spot inside of him that makes his heart race faster, and makes him see stars.
"Well he is pretty good at pretending not to see me." Harry held a hand up "I know I reduced the contact. I just couldn't talk about his wonderful boyfriend."
, is a private garden that is open to the public since nineteen-eighty-nine and we will have a guided tour."
“Fine by me.” Draco stood from the table and left the kitchen.
"You miss me too?" Draco can’t believe that this is his own voice. He never sounds so raspy and insecure.
"I have a problem." Draco pulled his wand out again. "It once again doesn't work."
Again he only nods.
For now, she waits and listens - a thousand years have taught her patience.
"Merlin, this looks as if we have made an excursion to the moon!"
“You seemed miles away.”
His eyes widened, surely she didn't mean that Draco was mad at him? What for?
And that is exactly as he wants it to be right now.
I know better than to argue with her, she is in a sense like Pansy when she is concerned for my health and I suddenly experience a hard bout of homesickness. I turn away so that she cannot see my face, but Phoenix is looking at me as if he understands what is going on. He growls at Vicky and swipes a paw at her hand, and I find that I have to step in.
It takes a couple moments, but Draco knows exactly when Harry makes the connection. The hand that has drawn patterns on his back, stops abruptly.
"Well I was talking about Chicken Kung Pao, but thank you for the compliment." Draco tries to diffuse the upcoming tension, and Harry smiles.
"Uncle Harry said we are going to the zoo!"
“No, they know that I like dancing with you, I think we could be amazing if you just let yourself, but that there is something holding you back. Do you still think I would betray you? Are you so repulsed by the idea of dancing with me? Is it that…”
Draco moves towards Harry gliding, stretches his hand out towards him, imploring him seemingly singing along.
"Oh no you don't." He grins downright filthily, leaning up he whispers in my ear, "I want you to take me apart - on your bed, with the grey satin sheets..."
"Why?" she seems more confused and less angry now.
"Pray tell, what business do you have with my love life? I have had all that I needed and wanted during the last few years." Harry sounds impatient now.
He finds himself pulled into a tight hug and reciprocates a little awkwardly. How on earth is he supposed to get through the actual fittings when he has to touch Harry quite often?
Although he wondered, why it always rained. No hailstorms or gusts of wind. No signs of jealous fury that he had half expected from the weather magic. Just torrents of rain as if the heavens were crying.
"They wanted to order you to the Wizengamot, present you with the candidates and proceed with the ceremony immediately." Draco sounds almost amused at the thought that anyone would order Harry anywhere.
"I am not running!" Harry bristled, but Draco looked at him with calm understanding that sent a pang through his heart. "I really am not..."
“Sounds nice…” Harry whispered.
“Do you think he’ll share the sofa with us?”
And with that she leaves him on the floor.
Ron breathes heavily as he looks down on him, but it is Harry who stands protectively over his fallen form, wand drawn and eyes blazing.
He looks through the ranks of the spectators and sees Potter on the side, he nods at him and Draco feels calm suddenly. He will own up to his shortcomings, and if he has to go to Azkaban to atone for his sins, he will because if Potter thinks he has done something right in all of the horrific mistakes that he has made within the last year then there is hope for atonement, and he will take it up with dignity.
"What happened? Is my mother not here?" It stung a bit to think that she would not be allowed to be at the hospital.
“So you will come by tonight?” Harry asked, wanting to make sure that Draco understood how much he wanted him, just not when he was wet and cold.
I laugh but even to my ears it sounds bitter. "You know her well."
"I had a couple of requests, but I never felt really comfortable doing it."
“What?” Harry almost jumps out of the bed. “You what?”
“Morning.” He is startled into replying, and nods cautiously at her. She looks at Malfoy and he motions her towards him. She gets up and plops herself down on the other side of the table,
Blaise simply pulls a vial out of his robe, hands it over and leaves. Right now that is more than Draco expected. They are still at the beginning of healing. Harry’s hand is warm, curled around his and that is more than he felt at the beginning of the year.
Yule is a quiet and relaxing affair. They both celebrate it with Andromeda, with an opulent meal and burning the Yule Log. Draco places his gift for Harry onto the table, smiling at the obvious joy Harry takes in the fine gloves made from soft leather, spelled to keep his fingers warm even in the coldest temperatures. Harry gifts him with one of the books that he had eyed in Flourish and Blotts and Draco can’t keep the pleased smile from his face. Teddy plays with the toys they both have bestowed on him and Andy enjoys the shawl he picked out as much as the gifts Harry picked. Harry spends Christmas with the Weasleys and returns afterwards to Andromeda’s cottage.
“Why did you just leave? Have I given you any indication that you are not welcome in my home when I have guests? You are family, you are always welcome!”
"Of course, now eat. You probably haven't had much food today and will continue to work late."
But now waiting for the trial that would condemn him to Merlin knows how long of Azkaban he wonders if the appearance of dignity in the face of a long separation was the best decision.
"Hey Mione." He tried to get the words past his lips, but he was already tiring. He pulls on her sleeve to catch her attention. "What happened?"
"I think you better start in the beginning." Bill handed him a goblet of spiced hot apple juice and steered him outside. "I want to know what is going on, and why Draco refuses to talk to me."
Harry shivered, but it wasn't because he was cold, no far from it.
“Great, I am a world class twat.” He turns the other way and trudges out of the courtyard. Right now he needs to be alone.
“I am upsetting myself.”
It was ironically one of those comfortable dinner nights when things started to go pear shaped.
Draco swallows, but Harry can’t be stopped.
“No.” Draco is surprised when he finds that this is the truth. Yes, the fog is back, but there is also a spark that is still yearning for Harry’s company. “He changed something.”
“Yes, Mione?”
"I hate to agree with our favourite hero here." My oldest friend blows into the scene like the whirlwind, she has always been. "But why do you put up with his antics again?"
"One day you will understand my reasons, for now you can take the life debt that I still owe you." Draco won't budge. By now Harry knows that from experience.
When they step in the room, they see her lying on the carpet, so still. Draco would panic, if not for Harry who takes over without a thought. “You pick up Teddy and go outside, I am checking Andy.”
“I promise Andy, I will take care of both of them. Don’t worry. And Draco will take care of me.”
But when Harry stood there, asked about his designs, with so much interest, when his eyes looked at him with such warmth. Draco felt whole for the first time in forever. As if Harry's smile was a thread that could mend the pieces of his existence.
"So, I am a liar now on top of everything else?" Draco almost whispered. "If I am so wrong, then tell me, when was the last time that you put everything aside and took time for me?"
"Sounds like you have a plan. But as you said yourself, Draco needs time to cool down. Maybe wait until tomorrow, before you confront the issue."
Draco burns for this design. He can't wait to see, what Harry will look like in his robe, stunning, that is for sure, but he wants to see Harry's eyes alight with pleasure.
Draco snorted, "You didn't listen to any of what I said." It was a statement but delivered with humour and a spark in his eyes. Harry ducked his head, embarrassed at being caught.
A smile plays around his lips, and he crouches down, in order to check the fall around his hips. He trails his hand down, following the stitches that embroider the sides.
"Do you also remember that my blood was on the wand?" Harry sighed.
"Don't push it," Bill grumbled, but led Draco to the Leaky.
Silence reigns, but Harry never once lets go of Draco’s hand.
* * *
"Master Malfoy is being calling?" the little house elf with the clean uniform asks.
Harry hates that Malfoy becomes quieter and quieter, he doesn’t want to subdue the bright spark that he had seen shine in the last few weeks while watching the other man dance at night. So, he has to offer at least an explanation and hope for the best. Malfoy has not once given up on him while they attempted to dance, has been a solid presence and Harry is sick and tired of hiding part of himself.
“I couldn’t risk it, because if you had asked me just once to come back, I would have dropped everything. As much as I wanted to hear from you, I thought making something out of myself was more important for the first couple years. And then it became so difficult to start a letter to you. I was too much of a coward.” Draco sounds tired “I kept your letters, but never opened them.”
“No!” She looks at the two of them. “Stay at the cottage please, take care of him together. You are so good for him.” She grips his hand tightly. “Promise me, you will take care of him!”
----------
“What are you talking about? There was no spell.” Harry frowns.
She looked at the two young men and saw that both of their ears were bright red, and while she usually didn’t condone relationships between students, they lived through a war and deserved happiness.
"Why?"
"Why would you want that? You don't like me." Tora yawns on Potters lap and curls up tighter. As he makes a move to lift her I shake my head " No keep her. I am just glad to know where she is."
Draco is confused. “Would you have wanted to carry him?”
Wrapping his arms around Draco comes natural. He pulls him against his own body, sharing the fact that he is shaking.
Going home is difficult, but Andromeda insists that he comes back soon.
"Good then. Well, a fit model is basically a mannequin, a person to which I am moulding the pattern."
Harry grinned and kissed him softly. "Anything that you want, Draco."
Now though, she's found the two young men who can reconcile the world, once they get over own their initial hurt feelings.
"Hey, Phoenix. You seem to be all healed again," Draco crouches down and scratches him softly underneath his chin. "Are you going to leave me now?" he sounds sad at the thought, and Harry feels his heart clenching again. He shakes his head and Draco stops the motion.
“Yes, it is as I thought,” Filius said. “Hogwarts has pulled such a stunt before. She wants to prevent an all-out war from breaking out and thus tries to push the two people that she sees as the major source of tension together.”
Potter stuck his head into the kitchen. "What happened?" He took in the sight and burst into laughter.
Draco had a hard time falling asleep that night. He lay on his back in bed, staring out the window.
Draco thought about his bath. He'd soaked for nearly two hours whilst drinking tea and reading. "Yes, it can be difficult to stop doing something you love."
Harry smiled, but tears ran down his face and soaked into the pillow. Even as more time had passed, nothing had become easier. He still couldn't accept this, and it was getting harder to ignore. Moments of Draco's pain snuck through, and what could Harry do? What could he say? He wondered how much Draco was hiding, but knew it would kill him to ask.
He closed his hand around Draco's cock, drawing back the foreskin and taking him back inside his mouth, where he belonged. He heard Draco's feet scrabbling for purchase on the quilt, trying to thrust into Harry's mouth.
"I'm going walking again Saturday," Potter said.
"Ouch!" he cried. "How much have you had to drink?"
Draco's heart was suddenly in his throat. He wanted to say meaner, nastier things to push Potter away. He wanted to apologise. He wanted to run.
Potter gave a wry smile. "It's served me well over the years."
At the shop the next morning, Draco looked over the small selection of astronomy books and chose one to read while he sat at the counter. He became so engrossed in it that he completely lost track of the time until Potter's voice interrupted him.
"Oh, right. What's going on with the investigation into the break-in attempt?"
"The only entry we have for the sixth of August has nothing logged except the message itself."
"Of course I'm bloody sure!"
Potter shivered and nodded, and his mouth fell open. "More."
The Healers wouldn't give him any more Dreamless Sleep, so Harry had decided it was time to leave.
"Thanks, Malfoy."
Robards had definitely done this on purpose.
"I know that, too. It's rather difficult to be unaware of my own chest pain. So then, what can we do about it?"
"That's it."
Potter cocked his head. "So what does it take to be classified as a regular around here then?"
"Damn," Potter said. "We should've come here last. Some of this stuff will go off sitting in the car all afternoon."
Draco raised an eyebrow at him and backed away.
magic at play here.
Someone here still wanted to kill Potter, and that was a sobering thought. One that gave Draco heart palpitations and made him panic the more he thought about it.
"I don't think so. I don't like Randall, and I don't think he likes me."
Draco nodded and waved him away.
"Not quite."
Potter sat back and thought. "I can't believe he put a junior Auror in charge of protecting me."
"Deal yourself five cards, and deal me five. Don't look at them yet, though."
But Draco didn't answer him. He took the access book with him and sprinted until he found what appeared to be the correct row. It was so bloody difficult to know for sure—everything looked the same.
They looked at each other for only a moment before Potter set his glass aside and launched himself at Draco, as though afraid he'd change his mind.
How did Potter do it?
"Does it matter?"
Maybe it was time to go.
"I'm on the side that finds out who wants to kill me."
Draco's eyes had squeezed shut in pleasure, but he forced them open to look at Harry. His face hid nothing in the pale moonlight, and Draco could see plainly that Harry needed him as much as he needed Harry. It was enough to push Draco over the edge, and he threw his head back and cried out as his entire body throbbed in pleasure. Harry gave a few more jerky thrusts and clutched Draco's legs to him as he came.
It was good that Draco had the memory of Potter on his knees to carry him through the next day, because work was miserable.
Fireworks were launched then, and the sky lit up with brilliant displays of red, green, blue, yellow, and violet. The entire crowd stood still and watched, transfixed.
Draco yawned. "Sleep well?"
He always let her have the first cup of coffee, and he had to smile as he watched her relax into her chair with the first sip. She liked to point out that she'd been having a cup of coffee at nine o'clock every morning for the last 60 years.
He tried to swallow, though his mouth had gone dry. He had to do something, but he didn't want to rouse Potter.
Draco pursed his lips and crossed one leg over the other.
Draco settled against a cushion and thumbed through the pages, looking for one that seemed easy. "What else am I going to do?"
"What's this?" Potter asked.
"I didn't." Jennings glared and added, "I should Obliviate you."
"Dunno," Harry said. "Early."
"Nothing," Draco said, holding the book against his chest. "I'll be back. Coffee."
And what was all that rubbish about helping himself? Draco had already tried that by making a generous donation over the last six years. His father had always said money could convince even the most stubborn wizards. If that hadn't helped, certainly nothing else would.
Harry gave him a small smile. "Well, at least I know I can trust you."
Lister entered the room again carrying a large styrofoam cup of coffee. "Right, any questions?"
"Yes."
"God, you really are the worst." Potter snorted. "I almost
It was Saturday.
Draco glared at him. "That mindless work is going to be my life for the foreseeable future. I'll be lucky to die before it's finished." He snatched a dripping bowl and set to drying it.
He watched it for a long time.
"I'm dressed well enough like a Muggle. Nobody will know. Besides, I've always wanted to see this bookshop of yours." Whitby began putting on his jacket as well.
He handed it to Draco and sank to his knees to lean against the bathtub. "How long are you planning to stay here?"
Harry smiled. "I think you can call me 'Harry' now." And he pulled Draco into another kiss.
He arrived to a Ministry in chaos.
Harry was so nervous he almost dropped his keys as he made to unlock the door to his cottage. It was something of a relief to see that Draco seemed nearly as nervous. At least, Harry had never seen his face so pale and pinched.
"Yes, fine. Let's keep this between us then." He unscrewed the cap and screwed it back on. "With this," - he waved the potion in the air - "you said I could manage the infection."
"This feeling won't go away once I'm sober. Trust me."
"Afternoon, Malfoy."
Draco blinked.
He'd discovered the official letter and the land deed in Draco's journal, which was otherwise fairly rote in its contents - he'd used it to track potion dosages and symptoms. Harry planned to keep it.
"Fine." He got out of the car and winced from how stiff and sore his legs felt.
Draco saw Robards coming towards them with a stern look on his face. "Sir," he said, but Robards ignored him and instead held a hand out to quieten everyone.
"Some old guy. He knew where all the files are and how they're organised. And he kept watch of what went in and out of this room."
"Well, then you'd best get to the shop."
"I could, but where's the fun in that?"
If only Potter hadn't fucked up the charm he'd cast on Draco's shoes to add extra cushioning. They felt stiff and unpadded, which made the entire walk miserable.
"Frankly," Robards said loudly, "I haven't seen any initiative from you. You never volunteer to oversee departmental expenses. You never offer to help train and mentor new Aurors. You never help to evaluate our case review processes. There have been plenty of leadership opportunities over the years, and you always pass on them."
Harry jerked to a halt and pulled Draco to him. "I don't either."
"I doubt you wandered here by mistake. Can you read?" He tapped the placard bearing his name next to the door.
"Fine" Draco whispered, he didn't know if he could speak louder, didn't want to try either.
Potter was waiting for him.
Then came a reply, the handwriting, though a little shaky, was still as stylised as it had been at school, and in one corner of the parchment he swore he saw a stain that looked like blood.
-----------------------------------------
------------------------------------
Inside the toilet, Draco sighed and prepared himself to take a look at his face. His hair is down all messy and greasy, his face too pale, his eyes swollen from all the crying, dark, deep circles under his eyes. He tried to comb his hair and washed his face with cold water. Looking at himself in the mirror again, he didn't look any better, but that was all he could do at that moment. Now he had to face Potter who was acting so oblivious and as if he really cared about his well-being. Draco was tired and couldn't concentrate on his intentions. He would apologise and thank him, he didn't have to see him again.
Harry didn't know where to find him, he had no address and no one had heard from him since the sale of the mansion a few months after the death of his parents. He opted to send him an owl, a silly idea, but he thought it was worth a try, the worst that could happen was that the owl would come back with the note intact.
-----------------------------
Nothing in return. He probably sounded desperate and a bit stalkerish, but he didn't stop sending him notes every day, he couldn't think of anything else but Malfoy. His job was to try to help people in similar situations. But it was different when that person was his childhood "enemy". He never really hated him, even though he thought he had at one point, now he realised that they were children and decisions were made before they even thought about it.
When he had free time he would go to Draco's flat. Sometimes he found him passed out, sometimes staring out the window, sometimes with a cup of tea and a cigarette burning between his fingers, and rarely he found him writing in a journal.
