"Malfoy!" Harry yelled, the laughter in his voice loud over the whistling of the wind. Draco forced himself to face the other way and dipped under the railings along the side.
He thought about heading down to see him (he knew he'd be welcomed) but decided he didn't want to encourage the reckless behaviour.
He allowed Malfoy to kiss him, to slip his hands up his robe. Allowed him to slide off the frustrating material that kept their bodies apart where the heat was most intense.
He became aware of Potter's hands, broad and strong - he'd know them anywhere - clasped on his arms and pulling him away from the mess, and he resisted violently.
Harry turned his head to look at him, his fingers playing idly with stems of warm grass. "What do you mean?"
"About you and your thing for Malfoy. Fuck you, by the way. I thought we had something serious. Thought you might ask me to be your girlfriend soon." She shook her head with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "But all this time, you were faking it."
The next morning, as the Sixth year Slytherins and Gryffindors lined up outside Snape's dungeon, Pansy and Blaise were unable to keep still or quiet, much to Draco's irritation.
Malfoy still hadn't reacted and it was beginning to worry Harry. The boy was impossible to read - was he about to punch Harry, or apologise, or something completely different? Harry had no idea, but he kept talking.
"Stop being gay, Potter."
Harry nodded. The first thing he reached for when he got outside was his wand, hidden in his boxer waistband, and he sat there levitating little stones into the air and letting them fall for a while. It was Lily's favourite game, and Harry smiled as he pictured his daughter's delighted giggle in his mind's eye.
"I love you, Draco," he moaned against Draco's mouth, and though the other boy never returned the sentiment, he found he couldn't stop saying it. It was the most intense and dangerous feeling in the world.
"So, what I'm trying to say is - what if that was somehow wrong?"
He realised suddenly that that was the only time he'd been allowed to watch Draco while they fucked, really watch him.
"Please let me," he replied in a slightly broken voice, holding Harry's hips hard as if to make sure he stayed. "I want to so badly. Please."
Hermione stared at the blonde, who was fixed to the spot, his expression of amusement slipping slightly. "Go after him, you prick!" she snapped. "
This changed everything.
"I was thinking about what happened earlier," he replied lightly, forcing Draco to look him in the eyes. "Are we gonna talk about that?"
The two boys lay there side by side in the grass for a while, fully dressed again but more than slightly rumpled up, watching the clouds drift blissfully over their heads.
Harry's eyes widened as Draco slipped the crimson sweet - still wet with Harry's saliva - into his own mouth, clicking it against his teeth. Then he rolled it decadently around his mouth with his tongue, coating the inside with traces of scarlet sugar and making it hard for Harry to respond.
"You're acting sort of unusual," Harry said when he pulled back, and instantly regretted the sentence - he didn't want to sound like he was complaining by any means! But the other boy didn't seem to care.
Almost immediately, he realised why Malfoy hadn't wanted him to see all of it.
"I'm going to hurt you in a minute when you've heard what I've got to say," he assured him, and then felt the tiniest jolt of something like genuine amusement, because he knew it was true. He was going to hurt Potter again.
"Thank you, sir," Harry said weakly, pushing his dark hair up off his sweaty forehead.
he'd shuddered on more than one occasion), surely a saint like Potter could find it in his heart to forgive and forget?
It was lying in Draco Malfoy's cold hands, where he kept painfully squeezing it whenever the urge arose. And it arose all the fucking time.
He picked up his brush again, and sketched two more large, long-lashed eyes right over the picture of Harry, so his beautiful face was rendered behind the lids. If they were open the irises would have been his own grey.
"What is it?"
Green apple.
Pansy was delighted to find, as she slipped in the 'Draco Ingredients', that the concoction was bubbling away exactly as it was supposed to. A glance into Draco's cauldron in front of them (because of course he'd have it perfectly made, even with Goyle to contend with) confirmed that Blaise and Pansy's mix looked just like the real thing. It even glittered the same way, and was the same fetching shade of pink.
Potter nodded with a slight wince. "Of course I do."
"Potter," he whispered, "Potter..."
Draco did understand. She told him anyway.
Harry had never seen himself in such a light before. It was bewitchingly pretty.
"Why don't you just make me?"
"You need to learn to be strong on your own, Draco," Harry said, as firmly as he could manage. "I can't save you forever. Don't you see? This is what's fucked us up all along. You need somebody to save you, and that can't be me any more."
"No!" Harry moaned, scrambling to his feet, but he knew it was too late as the dark Lord advanced. "Look me in the eyes, Potter," Voldemort crooned. "Let me watch the light leave them."
"Draco, seriously, you want to give that back," Blaise chipped in, the same expression of weird concern written over his face.
"Yeah," Harry nodded. "Meet me at the Lake when you're done. Usual place."
Blaise frowned. "What is tomorrow's Potions class?"
"And guess what, I do need you," Potter was saying, his green eyes darkening with frustration and the headrush of power. "It's real, Malfoy, forget the Amortentia. You don't have to even fight for it any more. I'm all yours and I know that intoxicates you. You want me more than anyone you've ever had."
Draco froze at the contact, then collapsed into Harry's arms, his body trembling with the effort of holding back sobs. "I can't look like I've been crying when I go back to my parents," he whispered, frantically rubbing at his eyes.
The Gryffindor changing rooms were empty, their House practice having technically finished twenty minutes earlier, and for this fact both boys were relieved. Too much of their dirty laundry had already been aired for the school to see; they appreciated any privacy.
"I will!" Harry grinned, and with that he was out of the Burrow and Apparating away to London.
he wondered, stretching back on his pillows as Malfoy left the room. A formal date seemed too intense, so a trip to Hogsmeade was likely off the cards. He couldn't imagine the two of them getting dinner together, or even just drinks for some reason.
Malfoy's body tingled with a hot rush of hatred as Harry's gaze slipped up and down him, but he didn't let the smirk fall from his face. "You should, you really embarrassed yourself," he said, making sure to keep his tone cold.
"I hate you so much."
Harry wondered if a hot bath would make him feel better, and resolved to run one quietly before grabbing his cloak and heading to Hogsmeade. He'd already bought for all his friends and the Weasleys, but it seemed that now he had one last present to buy.
And he breathed for him.
"What the fuck is he doing?!" Harry hissed, more to himself than anyone else, but it was apparently loud enough for Ron and Hermione to hear, and they regarded him with interest.
"Everyone's staring at him," Ron noted. "Is he alright?"
"Objection sustained - Mr. Mallory, is this fact supported by the defence?"
His mind slipped to Potter, as it so often did.
Malfoy sighed loudly. "Why do you insist on bothering me when I've told you I'm busy?"
He hadn't shared with Harry how gruelling it would be to fulfil his request and stay away from drugs when his body craved the high so badly, but he was doing his best. And two weeks was a little milestone for sure.
Ron and Hermione struggled watching their best friend slip under such a tide of pain that winter, and each insisted on hating Malfoy more intensely than ever, despite Harry's feeble efforts to defend him.
"He couldn't legally consent!" Harry echoed joyfully. "He didn't want the Mark!"
Hermione, meanwhile, was much less relaxed when 10 o'clock rolled around and Harry was still nowhere to be found. She'd even managed to drag Ron out of bed by this point, which showed how dire the situation was.
It had been a good week since he told Malfoy he was taking him out - he hadn't been called once to pick the other boy up over the past three days, which he took to mean that Malfoy had been staying away from the drugs for once, and might not be in his usual state of going up or coming down.
But the colours meant something must have had that effect on him.
Draco was beautiful and gentle and funny with wintery eyes and a mouth like red berries and tea, but Malfoy had tough, hard hands and a vicious tongue and those pretty eyes were flint cold.
"That might be difficult, he's pretty hard to stay away from," Draco said softly. "Sometimes I see him chucking pebbles into the lake, or walking out to Hagrid’s with his hands tucked in his pockets and his head right down, and he looks so lonely and vulnerable it's all I can do not to run to him. So instead I start fights and trash things to get his attention."
"Mr. Green, you'd do well to wait your turn," sniffed the Judge, and he was instantly silenced, mortified. "Thank you, Mr. Potter, for your input."
He leant in and Malfoy held his breath, but Harry could tell by now exactly what he'd been drinking. It was coming out of his skin, the smell of the wine he liked to crush his ecstasy into.
"Do you think I can't feel how nicely you're proving my point right now?" Harry breathed, an insolent smile spreading over his face. "Do you think I can't tell how much you want me?"
"The dorm," Draco panted, gripping Harry's hand and dragging him up the stairs. After a few make-out stops, the boys made it up to the dorm and fell back onto Draco's perfectly made bed, still kissing.
"Yeah. I know you do. It's OK, Harry. I'm sorry."
"I can do whatever I like, and you all know it," he grinned maliciously. "Who's going to stop me?"
Twenty-two months of missing him, of yearning to hear his voice, of waiting up for him out of habit, just in case he'd come home to bed.
There was a loud gasp, and the bottle was shattered, dropped from the height onto the flagstone floor. Pink liquid spattered the floor and walls all around Potter, but he didn't even seem to notice. His eyes were wide with shock and he looked like he might really be sick.
"So the most powerful love potion in the world was lying to you, was it? It's a fucking potion for Christ's sake, Potter, and it was made by Granger. It works. Get over yourself."
"Fine."
Harry was too numb even to cry, though he was slightly sick on the grass beside them both. There was nothing to throw up in his stomach so it was mostly spit and bile, but still an unpleasant feeling.
Pansy looked equally uncomfortable as he turned back to her.
But the Slytherin was up with the sun as ever, desperate to avoid Harry, and so his Christmas present went unopened.
Harry sighed, exasperated. "Malfoy, I don't know what more I can say! I've said a million times that I'm sorry-"
He looked at his friends, two people who he loved deeply but who had just never had the taste of intoxication and rapture that Harry had experienced, never had whole art books dedicated to them (
"You have to stop hurting him, Malfoy," she told him, knowing the blonde knew who she was talking about immediately. "He really will break."
"Really, Potter, you're deluding yourself if you think any of this tension comes from me," he said cruelly. "I mean, look at you and look at me. How on a million years did you ever see that working?"
"Sleeping nicely, are we, Malfoy?!" Hermione yelled as she burst into the Sixth year Slytherin boys' dormitories, sending a ripple of shock and disgust around the boys in the room.
The seriousness in his tone assured Harry that he meant what he said.
Malfoy slowed his pace kindly, and looked down at the creature with a distinct lack of contempt which shocked Harry to his core. It was almost warm, the softest he'd ever looked to Harry, who dropped back to ensure his shock wasn't seen.
"Potty's mad because Malfy doesn't love him," Peeves sang, eyes flashing delightedly. Draco's head snapped up across the Hall, his own eyes wide with panic.
Potter didn't even blink; still staring into space with that dazed expression. "I think I ought to leave, Professor, I feel quite unwell," he murmured, and then left without even waiting for Snape's response.
He breathed a sigh of relief the second he caught sight of Hermione's familiar curls in the corner of the room.
"My robes are getting wet."
And the hands that had caused so much injury to Harry in their lives became heaven-soft in secret; they stuck to Harry's sensitive skin like spun sugar.
Draco got the upper hand in this moment of relapse, and shrugged out of Ron's grasp to lean against the opposite wall. The redhead knew better than to approach him again.
Harry chuckled, his anger dissipating in a rush of affection. "This is very sweet, Ron, but I think you're forgetting Blaise is at least an inch taller than you."
Harry didn't look up from his plate, which dampened Draco's mood slightly, but he supposed he'd just have to try a little harder.
Draco felt tears prick his eyes as he read his own words.
Luckily for Draco, he noticed in that minute that Potter was causing a scene again, and was swiftly diverted from his anger into fascination again.
There was no arguing with that.
"Yeah, I do, I've always hated you," Draco whispered, ignoring the tears that were brimming up and threatening to spill, but not breaking Harry's gaze. "I hope you die."
He swung his legs out of bed and dressed quickly alongside Harry, ignoring the stares from the other Gryffindor boys, and then headed down to breakfast.
Or how massive it would become.
Harry hadn't even hit seventeen when Lily was born and her mother had left her to his care, which was terrifying to think of now, but he'd already been starting to make his way up in the modelling career and was earning enough to support them both. Thankfully Lily was a very small baby, and very quiet and easy to look after too, but Ginny wasn't around to care about that, or ever even meet her daughter properly. She made herself scarce as soon as she was out of hospital but Harry had always told Lily it was better that way, because who needed a Mummy when Harry could look after her? Maybe they had an especially close bond because it had always just been the two of them, Us Potters Together. Against the world, if that was what it took.
"You wish," Harry managed, but it sounded feeble even to him. He steadied himself on his broom, shit, why was he so shaky?
Harry nodded. "Yeah- what's your point? If they'll come back, it's just a matter of time, he'll be fine again in what- a couple months?"
With that, he turned and all but strutted out of the Hall. Draco couldn't keep his darkened eyes off of him, trying to burn holes in the back of his cloak with the heat of his hateful gaze.
"Hopefully," Mallory smiled wryly. He was really getting to like this Potter kid. He had spark. He'd make a good lawyer himself one day if he chose to follow that path.
The pain of the pressure against the fresh and burning Dark Mark was almost unbearable, but it was less bad than watching Potter fall, so Draco bit back his scream. His mind was swimming though, unable to even comprehend the event.
"No."
"I don't know why you're so bothered, Draco," Blaise tried quietly. "It's not like you like him."
"Potter, we were on ecstasy," Draco interrupted hurriedly. "Most people I've slept with on that drug have said exactly the same thing. And trust me, because I do it all the fucking time."
An uncomfortable silence ensued, the unsaid three words ringing in the air like a chapel bell.
"It's reckless and stupid," Harry replied firmly. "What if the ice cracks?"
Harry's eyes widened with realisation. "Like a kiss better?" he whispered.
He sulked into his empty glass. How dare Pansy say he was obsessed?? Draco hated Potter, everyone knew that. He was a cocky bastard who thought he was better than everyone else. Better than purebloods! Draco glared after his best friend's retreating back as she headed off to her first classes of the day, then gathered up his own stuff from his place and stormed off to Quidditch practice with Crabbe and Goyle with slightly more aggression than was needed.
The Gryffindor party was well underway, the clock showing a quarter past two in the morning, when Draco Malfoy staggered through the portrait door and shattered any illusion Harry might have had of peace from his tormenting for one night.
Or perhaps he'd gone further south to the beaches of Devon, got himself a little waterfront place in the way Victorians used to go down to the sea to get well. Harry couldn't picture Draco properly swimming, but maybe he liked a coastal walk, and skimming flat blue pebbles on the waves.
His heartbreak was definitely audible.
The sketches weren't at all explicit or vulgar, yet they still had an incredible intimacy about them which made them feel as though they shouldn't be viewed. It was Harry, in a way that only Draco had ever seen him. Harry, beautiful, but torn apart and angry and wrecked. Harry's soul on the page.
He was a vision, that boy. A blonde-headed angel in the afternoon light that poured through his windows and soaked his skin.
Harry wished he could give her another Christmas like that one, but money was so tight they'd had to move to a cramped apartment with no garden last April, and Lily had to wear last year's clothes, which were quite small on her now. Harry hadn't stooped quite low enough to need to accept the nasty old hand me downs that our neighbours kept offering him, but if this shoot didn't work out, he knew he might have to do worse than that.
"Ooh Potter, was that your arse? What an unfortunate accident!"
that.
," Harry sniffed. "You're a moron and you deserve to feel pain for what you've done. Because I know this wasn't an accident, whatever you say."
What could he do to get Potter's attention again? Draco had reluctantly realised his ego was growing quite dependent on the other boy's confirmed attraction to him, and it wasn't something he wanted to lose.
The whole thing in Astronomy had been very bizarre behaviour simply for the sake of proving a point, and Harry realised now why Malfoy couldn't leave him alone - it went far further than ego, or point-scoring, or hate, though of course those were factors.
"And you know what, fine, maybe this wasn't your fault. But what
"Look, Potter, I'm just warning you so you know to expect it. Alright?"
"Draco!" Harry roared, and several heads flicked immediately towards him, though not the one he wanted. That one was still and limp and grey.
Arousal flared through Harry's body - he should be used to this by now, but every time was exciting.
Harry laughed. "Charming."
The bruise from Harry's punch was fading from Malfoy's cheek now but it was still just about there, blue enough to still hurt, and Harry grabbed a rough hold of the other boy's jaw to press his thumb into the mark the second they were alone. Then he forced Malfoy down hard onto one of the benches, while he himself stayed standing, staring down his nose with hostility. It was an excellent way of making sure he had the blonde's full, wide-eyed attention.
And of course, Harry only laughed.
"You scrubbed up nicely," Harry offered. Draco grinned.
"Give me another kiss," he whispered, a rush of affection and admiration overwhelming him.
he reminded himself of Mallory's words.
And then, towards the back, was Harry.
Draco decided to make an effort to be especially mean to Potter on the pitch that lesson, "accidentally" crashing into him on his broomstick and making him nearly fall, stepping on the back of his robes to watch him trip, getting him sent off by pretending he was cheating.
Harry had been expecting the "something" Draco wanted to show him to be Draco's dick (it would have been a rather on-brand joke for the Slytherin) but instead when they got down to Draco's part of the boys' dorms, the blonde knelt down and pulled a large leatherbound book from under his bed.
"I promise to think of you when I do it," Harry grinned.
"I can't exactly help it, Neville," Harry snapped. "I'm not having an amazing time of it, either - if you hadn't noticed, he bullies me senseless every day and this is the best ammunition of his life."
"Oh, don't, don't," said Draco awkwardly. "This is a good thing, remember? I'll get clean, and you'll get over me-"
"You did Hex a librarian, after all," Dumbledore noted over the lenses of his half-moon spectacles. "And you caused thousands of Galleons' worth of damage before Miss Granger kindly stepped in to clean up your mess. And the drugs issue ... this is something I cannot turn a blind eye on, Draco, you must understand."
He knew he'd played better than ever that day, and as well as the attention he would receive for winning the match that evening, there was the added interest because of the whole ... Potter situation.
"Why did you call for me?" he asked, surprising himself with the boldness of his question. The words hung in the air, and he felt Malfoy prop himself up on an elbow to regard him with those beautiful dilated eyes in the dark.
"Try it again and I'll be
Harry couldn't even find it in him to be angry about this. At least he got to be around the other boy, even if it made him fucking miserable.
Draco was furious at the implication but there was no denying that he'd never felt so alive as he did in that moment, tousled and pushed back on the bench, Harry's hand pressing a dull ache into the arch beneath his eye. The contact was delirious.
Malfoy blinked down at her in genuine confusion. "Can you point me to a time when i ever cared about that?" he asked. "I'm well aware of what I'm doing, and I don't wish to discuss it with Mudbloods."
Oliver shrugged. "I don't know about that. I just know about Quidditch. I hope whoever's shit it is, it's sorted soon, though."
"I just wanted to assure you, Malfoy - about last night-" Potter began, helping himself to a leisurely swig of the other boy's glass of juice and ignoring all protests. "I meant every last word I said and I don't regret a single one."
"We'll tell you eventually," Blaise grinned. "Just let us enjoy our joke for now."
"Fuck you, Malfoy," he said, as the four of them were escorted from the library. He meant it from the bottom of his soul. "I hope you've got what you wanted."
It made it ... gay.
"If you say so, Potter," he replied, aiming a sharp jab of his hand dangerously near to Harry's bollocks. Harry tensed immediately; he knew a threat when he felt one.
"Malfoy, no, I-"
"I finished coming down yesterday. So I guess just under a week ago?" he responded. That was his best guess.
"That's how it should've happened," Malfoy breathed, and Harry melted into the offered kiss like it was the last he'd ever have.
Since learning that it was the date his parents died, he had found it hard to enjoy the 31st of October, but this year Ron and Hermione were determined to take Harry's mind off things. Being only sixteen, the trio had had to ask Fred and George for a couple of bottles of Firewhiskey and Elvish wine, and they'd happily obliged, even throwing in a dangerous-looking little cask of Fred's own "home brew".
"If you ever snoop around in my shit like that again I will happily set you on fire and warm my hands on the blaze, you revolting little scumbag," Malfoy told him, voice as even and calm as if he was merely mentioning the weather, or his impending Quidditch practice.
"Not like that, Weasel! Ugh, as if," Malfoy snapped when he regained his breath. "I just mean she came on to me. But we absolutely didn't have sex. I'm not that bloody quick- she was only there for thirty seconds!!"
"I told you myself that I'm not!" Harry protested. His jaw was so clenched he could barely speak through it, and he resented Malfoy for standing up so early because it forced Harry's head to tilt right back to see him, and drew attention to his own reluctance to stand.
Hermione turned her head to look up at Harry with pity. "You didn't always think that," she said quietly.
He grabbed a robe and some slippers, dashing briefly back for his wand to conjure a
The younger students were watching the situation unfold in awe and amusement, some of them literally open-mouthed, and Draco whirled round to glare at them too.
But as Harry chewed his breakfast in the Weasleys' kitchen that morning, a week from the trial, a new idea was forming in his mind, and he knew he wasn't going to listen to whatever Draco wanted this time.
"And you're acting like I've molested you! Have I even made a single move on you? Have I made one inappropriate comment? No. Yet you make everything tense, and sexual, and weird."
"I read Draco's diary," he said suddenly, hot shame overwhelming him again.
Harry frowned lightly. He should've known they wouldn't understand. How could they, when they'd never felt the balm of the other boy's kiss after days of enforced pain, like giving a cool draught of water to a parched man stranded in the desert?
He realised they weren't heading towards the hospital wing any more, and he also realised he didn't care.
, he thought.
He raised his voice to a normal speaking level and turned to their friend, who'd been successfully drowning them out thus far. "Draco, can you come here for a second?"
"I expect so," Mallory agreed. "The blood is the ink of the Mark - presumably the contents stay in the exact same condition they were in when the Mark was made."
He gasped for breath, his energy clearly waning with the effort of his speech.
"It's also the anniversary of my parents' death. So it's kind of a hard enough day for me without you assaulting me in front of my entire form and then embarrassing me."
"Thought you were waiting till the match to go sheet-sniffing," Ron called after him.
"I suppose you're going to think about me in the showers after this, are you?" Malfoy taunted him. "Better lock the door to the Slytherin ones, boys, before he gets any ideas!"
Blaise and Pansy looked up with nothing more than lazy interest; they'd heard that specific phrase many times and didn't need to ask who, exactly, had gone too far.
"Malfoy?" Ron's eyes widened. "Hermione, are you mad?"
Both boys were trembling with shock and exhilaration, Harry didn't even reach up to wipe the spit with his sleeve but let it drip from his cheek loudly onto the stone floor.
The first that caught Harry's eye was a familiar scene, a skilfully captured snapshot of the event on the bank of the Black Lake, drawn out and re-imagined in lurid grey and black and indigo.
Harry replayed the conversation he'd had with Blaise that morning as he watched Malfoy in the water.
, and the other day, before he ruined everything,
Potter faltered. "I think I do," he muttered, though his mind was clearly reeling.
"Aww," Harry cooed. "So the little dragon boy has emotions after all!"
"Not like this, they don't. It's very specific. Besides, there was something else in there... hair gel, I think. And green apple for sure. Broom polish, too. The good kind."
Draco didn't know what exactly was beginning, but it certainly felt ominous.
"I bet you can't do this, Potter!" Malfoy called, attracting Harry's attention over the Lake before executing a moderately graceful spin on the ice. He let out a loud, exhilarated whoop, and as he spun nearer to the edge, Harry came close enough to see that the boy was injured.
"I'll get to the point," the Weasel sighed. "You hate Harry Potter, right?"
"I'll have a very lonely couple of years," Harry corrected him with a sniff. "I may never have been safe with you, but at least I was never bored. I won't know what to do without you."
But the look on Malfoy's face that accompanied the pain wasn't anger, as Harry had first assumed. Instead, he appeared overcome by hurt and guilt and confusion, which even he wasn't able to mask.
"I'm dating the great Draco Malfoy, the twattiest pureblood in school, of course I have high standards," Harry teased through another bout of shivering. "Yours are another matter."
"Right, let's try it again... oh fucking hell, Potter, I literally pay you to look pretty in front of a camera, why aren't you doing it? D'you think you could manage to freaking cooperate with me for one day? That means that when I say smoulder, you fucking smoulder, not grimace, or smirk, or anything else. Fucking smoulder." Mr Malfoy yelled, slamming his hand on a table and making Harry jump.
By a couple weeks of this chaos, Harry decided that it was high time (Malfoy laughed at the pun, though Harry found it less amusing) that the two of them did what he wanted for a change, and announced this thought to Malfoy one morning after a particularly hard and late night.
He gazed thoughtfully into the fire, and wondered what the time was. He glanced at the clock and gasped, leaping up and tugging his robe back on. It was two minutes till the end of lunchtime, but if he was lucky he might get a piece of cake or a banana.
All of this was a source of great distress for Draco, however. How was he meant to hurt Potter when all he did in return was laugh in his face and ask if he wanted a
"Potter, we've not got the samples back from the lab yet," he said. "They're due to arrive with the medical expert as evidence today - we won't get to see them first!"
Harry bit his lip. "Mine too. They were my last ones. Doesn't matter though, I've had loads," he added quickly.
"Chosen a seat with a view, have you, Potter?" Draco asked, already enjoying himself.
He'd told Ron so many times not to owl him at work, but Hermione had always been a natural worrier. She worried that Harry wasn't getting enough rest or vitamins, spending enough quality time with Lily, eating properly, stopping smoking "that bloody stuff" etc. Okay, so maybe she was right, he wasn't doing enough of any of that, but Harry wished she wouldn't keep making Ron check up on him.
He ignored the pretend hurt looks Malfoy threw his way. "You may well be manic and euphoric right now, and that's fun for you, but I'm sober and really exhausted and I don't want to come over there and fetch you like I'm your fucking dad, okay?"
His pulse roared under his skin, making it hard for him to think, let alone respond.
"Your dirty Mudblood mother never tell you not to be a thieving arsehole before she snuffed it, then?" Malfoy asked viciously, wiping his hand on his sheets as though it was diseased from the contact with Harry's stinging face.
And he'd thought about it, really he had.
"The- the news?" he asked, surprised.
Harry gave in pretty quickly. He peeled the sheets tentatively back, keeping one watchful eye on the sleeping boy beside him, and then he was on his knees and fumbling under the oak slats of the bed for the precious leather book that contained access to Malfoy's mind.
He opened his eyes slowly again, and saw through the slats of his lashes the look in Malfoy's eyes, those eyes he knew better than his own. He realised with a shudder what Draco was about to do, and almost screamed for him not to. But Harry knew better than anyone what Malfoy was capable of if he set his mind to it, and how hard he was to deter, so in the next couple of seconds he watched in a mixture of horror and awe as Malfoy tore away from his parents and launched his wand at Harry, avoiding dozens of spells as they whizzed lethally past his skull. He was a target now, a traitor in front of his Master.
He paused, and a cruel smile played across his lips. "Suppose that's how she liked it anyway, isn't it?" he asked. "So she didn't have to remember it was you? I wouldn't blame her. God, the idea of having sex with you turns my stomach."
His lips crept down to suck and bite at the sensitive skin of Harry's throat in between sentences, a feeling which did nothing to make Harry want to stick to his idea of not having sex.
Malfoy's proximity made the little hairs on Harry's arms stand up, as if they were pulling him towards him by the follicles.
The first thing Draco wanted on his return to Hogwarts was ecstasy, sex, and a good fucking nap, in that order.
Saturday morning arrived, the day of the match, and Harry was ready. He waited till the other students had flooded out of the castle to the stands, then made his way slowly down to the Slytherin dormitories.
Harry's mind insisted as he rolled over to sleep,
He had known his parents would do something like this, but so soon? He closed his eyes and wished, not for the first time, that the darkness he saw when they were shut would surround him with open eyes too.
Sure enough, no sooner after 8am rolled around, Potter appeared with his pet Mudblood and the Carrot Top, and Draco wasted no time in hauling him aside.
"I don't care," Harry beamed. "I still loved every second of it. How does that make you feel? I thought about it later, too-"
Then he took a sip from his glass, set it aside, and opened his mouth to let a pretty stream of wine drip from his lips into Harry's willing open mouth, and that was enough of a wave to start the tsunami.
But before Draco could enter the other boy's mind he was already blocked out, and he growled in frustration.
"Objection dismissed," said the Judge with a wave of his pale hand. "I'm interested in what Mr. Potter has to say. Continue, Mr. Potter."
"I saw him throw it," said Fred, followed instantly by George.
"Fucking hell, Harry."
That evening Malfoy waltzed over to the Gryffindor table as Harry and his friends were leaving, and shoved a card unceremoniously into Harry's hands.
you?!" Hermione asked, aghast. "What is wrong with the two of you that neither of you can process emotions in any way resembling normal?"
me taking it easy!" he yelled. "You have no idea how badly I want to punch his stupid fucking lights out right now!"
But he didn't quite manage to say that. Instead, "You look sun-strewn," he replied quietly. "And vulnerable. You look like you shouldn't be looked at, like it would hurt if I did for too long. You look like you've just been fucked, and like you liked it. You look like ... you look like someone who wants to save me."
"Make me."
The next morning was a Saturday and Harry still hadn't emerged from Ginny's room by 10am, where he'd run in the panic of the night before.
"A significant issue with Draco's case is his Mark," Harry mused, taking a thoughtful sip of his tea. "It's cold proof of his Death Eater affiliation."
Funny how something so simple as a kind word and a pretty light could spark such a fire inside Harry's existence. Except this wasn't a fire like the previous fires Harry had learnt to associate with Draco; not one of craving and lust, built on the kind of desire that was indistinguishable from anguish, but something entirely new and unfamiliar to him.
"They'll fuck and get over it, they always do," Blaise had rolled his eyes, but no one else seemed so sure.
Pansy reached out to touch Draco's arm gently but he flinched away from her.
"I won't shut up," Harry snapped. "You've been trying to make me shut up for years, and I won't give in on this. But you know I'm right, Malfoy."
Harry blushed violently. "Not yet," he mumbled, avoiding Draco's eyes. "I'm sorry, I'm not... I don't want to..."
"Come on, Harry," Draco said at last, standing up and pushing his chair back. "Let's go and get pudding in Honeydukes. I hope you realise how packed our itinerary is today."
He fully cracked the first night of the next Quidditch practice, of course - there had been some kind of weird hot tension in the air all evening, and when Harry asked the blonde what to do with it he grinned and said "
"You can't, you idiot," he'd snapped. "Think that'll go down well with my parents? Having my gay lover speak at my trial? The boy who happens to be the icon of their opposition?"
Don't leave me alone, the voice in his head begged.
"I know, I'm gorgeous, aren't I?" He sighed, running a hand lazily through his hair. "I almost wish I was going on a date with myself instead."
"I had an idea," he began. "But perhaps we could discuss it somewhere a little more private?"
"What?" Harry asked, a confused little smile on his face.
, the snake in his head wheedled.
The request seemed to actually work, as the only sound for a couple of minutes was the sound of their breathing before Harry broke the silence himself.
He had assumed, for example, when Potter strolled over to lean on the Slytherin table, that he was coming to apologise or make some excuse for his behaviour the previous evening, defend himself somehow - but no.
Draco stretched out on his back and laced his hands behind his head, exhausted by the effort of so much reading and writing.
In the fucking Amortentia.
"No, it's more than that," Harry shook his head. He wondered how to give his sadness words. Malfoy's eyes drank him thirstily up while he waited, almost primal in his need, and Harry could tell that once again their minds were speaking different languages.
He turned off the shower, and then realised he'd forgotten to get himself some clothes, and smacked his forehead in frustration. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Wordlessly, Malfoy lifted his arms up in response to the contact and they broke the kiss just long enough to slip his hoodie off over his head, before Harry followed suit. Their skin was burning hot as they pressed against one another once more, and it wasn't long before Malfoy (impatient at the best of times) decided to move things forward.
By now the taller boy was leaning in very persuasively, Harry could almost feel his body heat, count his abs through his soaked down jersey, but he told himself he wouldn't give in.
Draco took a deep sip of his drink, then exhaled in pleasure. He smirked a little, running a ringed finger round the rim of the crystal glass. His pupils were huge, Harry noticed with surprise, like two great abysses in his flashing silver irises.
"That's what these are here for," he told Harry as he tore the wrapper off. "Ecstasy makes you grind your teeth and these are a good distraction. Open your mouth for me."
Malfoy thought about it, and his nose wrinkled in confusion. "For what?" he asked.
He let it hold him
"I know," Harry whispered, kissing his forehead, "I know you do."
"Please turn to page 256 in your textbooks," Trelawney said in a strained, quavery voice. "We're going to be learning how to read a glass ball like the ones you've got in front of you, so if you'd just like to look at the diagram at the bottom..."
He was crying now, and completely mortified to be doing it again in front of Malfoy.
"As the court is possibly somewhat aware, Your Honour," the man began in a reedy tone, "The material used to inscribe a Dark Mark is not in fact ink, but the recipient's blood."
Harry knew that he meant those words, and bit back the bile in his throat. He wanted to apologise but it seemed a bit wet just to blurt it out, so he stayed kneeling at Malfoy's feet in stunned silence and shame, willing himself not to cry.
Draco didn't bother arguing with that.
"Ew, it reeks of wet dog in here," Malfoy announced loudly with a wrinkle of his perfect roman nose, causing some giggles from the Slytherin girls in the room.
"Take it off," Harry mumbled, pulling gently at Draco's sweater.
Who else would have their emerald silk sheets so pristine and sharply folded in? Who else would have a robe with the Malfoy family crest hanging from their bedpost?
"Okay," he said grudgingly. "Let's call it a day."
"How exactly is someone Marked, Hermione?" he asked, tapping thoughtfully on his glasses as he spoke. "It's nothing like a Muggle tattoo, is it?"
"Ugh, I don't want to know! I can't believe you'd touch me like that! Fuck off before I'm sick."
"Come on, you fucking moron," he snarled as he came up to take another breath before going back down again. "Breathe, it's not that fucking hard. Breathe. BREATHE, goddamn you!"
Ron and Hermione did their best to coax him out of his low mood, but the truth was that nothing really worked to distract Harry from the emotions surging inside him. It was a cocktail of anger, remorse, loneliness and anguish which could only be cured by Malfoy's presence, but there was nothing he could do to have that again.
Harry nodded. Malfoy's fingers pressed harder into his skin; he lifted Harry's inner thigh up to press against his hip, and Harry's eyes widened. The two of them still weren't perfectly aligned, but the pressure was certainly there now, and it would begin to ache pretty soon.
"Oh, did that hurt?" Harry seethed as Malfoy backed off, his face screwed up in pain. "Good. You deserved it, you evil bastard. You're the worst person in the world sometimes, you know that?"
"Shut up," Draco hissed, but Harry pressed his fingers harder into those high cheekbones, causing Draco to audibly wince.
Pansy thought.
Harry shrugged. "Just interested. Have you?"
"Shut it, Malfoy."
And this desire always arose at the worst and least appropriate times - Harry would be sat in Charms, doing nothing even remotely suggestive, and suddenly Malfoy would give him that pointed look and he'd have no choice but to leave with him-
"No," he said quietly. "Though I hardly think casting '
"I'm busy," Malfoy shook his head.
"I assume you want that shag you've been banging on about," Draco rolled his eyes. "You're horny, I'm horny, let's get it over with."
He'd probably never kiss him again now he had the Mark.
It was Draco standing in the doorway of the Great Hall; tall, immaculately dressed and visibly scrubbed clean again, all traces of soot soaked out of his hair like nothing had happened. He was whistling nonchalantly as he wandered over to the Slytherin table, and slumped down casually between Theo and Millicent Bullstrode.
, Harry thought.
"Oh, yes," she grinned. "Oblivious Potter is going to fall like a stone for this one! Can you think of anything I've missed?"
"I ... I can't have it any other way."
Better to crash in the basement where at least Malfoy was popular, and most people had apparently seen him in this state before, if Daphne Greengrass's description of events was anything to go by.
"That's none of your business." Cold, closed off again. Harry could tell he'd gone too far.
His fascination with the other boy's appearance quickly turned to annoyance and resentment, though, as he watched him help himself to more bottles on the table with those slender fingers, carelessly discarding any that he found unappealing, not caring when they smashed on the floor.
"Do you - do you not realise how irresponsible that is?" Harry spluttered. "Do you have no sense of self-preservation?"
He saw ...
A clever Muffling charm had been cast around the far parameters of the grounds, so the blaring music was only audible once you got through the magical boundary, but after that point, God, it was loud enough to blow anyone right off their feet.
Recently if they slept together it was more frantic, hungrier, a way to distract Malfoy from his comedown, but this? This was tender, this was gentle. It felt like love.
“Yes, but I understand he’s quite a good guy,” Draco countered.
Or maybe he'd imagined the more complex, more obviously 'Draco' notes in the scent - or maybe they weren't even Draco's scents?
"Only if you keep me supplied with the best gossip about what Potter looks like in the shower," she teased, earning herself a swat across the head.
The drink was pretty and sweet and almost silky in texture, though there was something in the aftertaste that Harry had never tried before and couldn't describe. There were peach and orange edible flowers floating on the top, and he put the aftertaste down to having something to do with them, though he couldn't be sure.
"Those evil serpents!" Ron exploded, gripping the page so hard it tore a little under his fingers.
Malfoy took Harry's jaw in one rough hand and pulled it back to force Harry to look up at him, pressing his fingertips into the skin hard enough to make it feel bruised. "I can do whatever I like, and you won't stop me because you're obsessed with me, and you
"Can't you just stay one night?" Draco asked. A pleading tone slipped into his voice and he coughed to force it out, but it was no use. "Harry, I have nightmares."
What should he say to that? 'Well, Potter, since you're asking, I've been battling some serious internalized homophobia for the last five years and I bully you on a regular basis, partially because it's the only way I know how to get your attention, but also to try and hide how attracted I am to you' ?? Yeah, right. That would go down well.
"It's 10am, Zabini, but don't mind me," Hermione snapped, heading straight for the blonde in the corner. "It's Malfoy I'm after."
"I only found out by accident yesterday!" Draco protested. "I'm angry about it too, believe me."
He glanced in the mirror and rubbed a little more gel into his hair, which was again swiped from Percy. Good. He looked as presentable enough; it would do.
"I just am," Malfoy mumbled. "I'm so fucking sorry for everything."
Draco froze in horror; there was half a second of contact before he shoved Harry with all his might back against the wall, threw back his own head and spat violently in the other boy's face.
"I don't understand why you both decided to take that antidote so quickly after the Veritaserum," he grumbled as he wiped down his work surface with a flick of his wand. "You hadn't even answered my question before you reversed the truthful effects!"
"I'll always choose you, Potter," Malfoy replied slowly, and somehow he made even that phrase sound malicious. "Whether you choose me back or not. And there's nothing you can do about it."
"Exactly," Blaise sighed. "His brain doesn't work that way. So in the meantime he'll give in and take the ecstasy again, because he can't help it. Because that's what addicts do. It's only a matter of time."
Harry despised himself for letting that one slide, though the desperation had admittedly added an interesting new dimension to the sex that evening.
"Perhaps not if he's the Chosen One," Draco joked.
he thought, but in a whirl he was spun back around by a cool hand, such urgency it made him dizzy.
"Except it wasn't just sex. Don't you remember what I s-"
"Which is the nearest to Jupiter of the four Galilean moons, Mr. Potter?" Professor Sinistral asked, making him jump. She was apparently oblivious to the fire threatening to consume Harry as she spoke, as was everyone else in the room.
"He's using you for sex, Harry," Hermione insisted, on a private walk to Hogsmeade (a well-meaning attempt to distract her best friend from the walking talking nightmare of Draco Malfoy).
This time, Harry saw, as the images flickered and Malfoy's cursive writing captioned their movements, the blonde doesn't quite manage to leave the dark haired boy on his own in the rain with his heart falling out of the gaping hole in his chest.
And punishment indeed it was, as two hours later at dinner Harry was still spilling his every thought to anyone who cared to listen.
Harry knew it was a lot more serious for Malfoy, too - he'd been found in possession of Class A drugs on the school grounds as a result of his little explosion in the library, and Dumbledore was apparently in negotiations with Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy on the subject of Draco's return to school the following year.
He spun round to hurry out of the Hall, eyes still fixed on the ground so no one could see the angry tears blurring them. It was probably as a result of that that he found himself tripping as he went through the door, but a surprisingly gentle pale hand was there to steady him.
He was like a man unhinged, more wild animal than human as he fought to get to the dark-haired boy. Blaise and Theo were clearly having an issue holding him back, even between the two of them.
But Malfoy didn't even falter, his grey eyes fixed firmly on his work, answering the professor's questions when asked and writing lines of perfect script in his free hand, while the other dug hard grooves into Harry's thigh beneath the table.
Their first Quidditch practice of the new term was a dark Thursday evening, and once again the Slytherin and Gryffindor slots overlapped, so Draco assumed he'd at least be in luck afterwards, like he normally was.
It had been Harry.
With that, he turned and strode shakily off down the corridor, leaving Harry equally turned on and disgusted with himself for his behaviour.
"My client has a drug problem, there's no denying that," he began. "But all too often we forget that addiction is a disease, and we instead perceive the sufferers as evil, or weak, or wilful. Why not instead let this fact humanise Draco? He stands before you, a boy with a confirmed medical addiction, which his own parents used against him for their selfish Death Eater agenda. He was coerced and manipulated into something he didn't believe in at seventeen years old - I request that the Jury ask themselves, what choice did this boy have?"
There was no indication of what was going on other than a slight flicker in his irises, but even then only if you knew what you were looking for.
When Hermione and Ron couldn't find Harry that morning, Hermione went instantly into concerned mode.
The idea didn't seem to calm Hermione's despair at all, and finally she decided to tackle the real problem.
"Yeah, he was crushed," Ron agreed reluctantly. "But 'Mione, really. He'll just have slept on the stairs somewhere or something and then gone for a walk to clear his head."
Harry convinced himself, and though it was a weird picture, it actually relieved him a little. He didn't fancy Draco Malfoy. He was still himself.
"What sort of weird joke is this?" Potter asked once he'd read it, looking like he'd like to rip the parchment up.
He only managed one glimpse of the blonde head he craved so badly before it was out of sight entirely.
"I know," Harry smiled sadly at him. "I do too."
They were playing Exploding Snap, but Harry's mind didn't seem to be on the game any more. He was staring pensively out of the window, losing card after card to his opponent.
"No, he's bloody not," she hissed angrily, storming past the group. "Malfoy's probably
When he wasn't in the air, Harry had taken to going down to the banks of the lake at erratic times, and forcing himself in, though the ice sometimes had to be cracked around the edges - December that year was particularly unforgiving in a number of ways.
"You're messing with my head, Malfoy."
"It's rare," Malfoy conceded.
"Harry, please." Barely audible. Quickly hushed. Mallory had promised them both that drug offences wouldn't be added to Draco's charges if they were used as character evidence, and this knowledge emboldened Harry.
"I'm so sorry," Harry sighed between kisses and the odd flick of his tongue over the warm skin that made Malfoy's eyes roll back. "I've never been so sorry, please forgive me for hurting you-"
Draco scowled, biting back a snide comment about Harry's father since it was fairly likely to earn him the Crucio curse, watching as the other boy tipped another handful of brightly coloured sweets into his mouth. They clicked and flashed against his teeth and Draco's own mouth watered.
Draco wheeled round to glare at him full in the face, eyes burning. "I don't, Blaise, you're right," he replied nastily. "But that's none of your business anyway. The point is that the two of you were set on trying to embarrass me in this weird little trick of yours, and I hate you for that."
But suddenly, a realisation began to dawn on Harry, and the constant infliction of pain began to make sense.
"Though are we not to consider the circumstances as the climax of a very troubled year?" Harry persisted.
Draco laughed. "I'd love to Potter, but the thing is, my fist's still sore from the last time I beat you up. Maybe later though, yeah?"
Draco's head remained remarkably un-kicked-in, but Harry grew pale and wan when he was told what had happened, and he dropped the brown paper bag he'd been holding behind his back loudly to the floor.
Harry collapsed onto his chest, not caring if it hurt the other boy, just overwhelmed with his own misery.
Draco looked at him. "You're disgusting, you don't deserve to be wanked over."
"You're lucky we didn't involve the Aurors, young man," Professor McGonagall had informed him brusquely when delivering the information of his expulsion. "Your behavioural misdemeanours this year were extremely serious!"
"Objection!" snarled the prosecution, but the Judge waved a hand, eyes fixed on the unfolding scene.
"You want to fuck me so bad it makes you look stupid-"
"I was in the common room," Harry frowned. "Not that you care."
Pansy stared too, transfixed, as Potter's hand reached for the heart-shaped bottle, and he began to unscrew the lid.
"True or false, a planet can travel through space without a parent star?" she asked, taking a slurp of her drink.
"Yeah," Draco admitted. "He's got these really intense eyes and stupid cute glasses and an ugly laugh and God, he's so pretty."
"C'mere," Malfoy muttered, heading back over to Harry. He looked at him for a second, a torn expression on his face.
Oh? Weakness!
"Get out! Ugh, get out!" she shuddered.
Hours and hours of the most delicate artwork Harry'd ever seen covered every beautiful page; pictures of the castle shrouded in clouds, of the view of the lake from his window, and dark, twisted self-portraits, where Draco had drawn himself in charcoal with his eyes scored out and the Dark Mark emblazoned over his forehead and chest as well as both his arms. That particular series had small wet splatters all over it, which had been smudged out with chalky fingers.
He was a picture of misery, his figure hunched completely over, and clearly racked with sobs. His shirt and trousers clung to his skin and Draco wondered if he was allowed to enjoy the sight just a little.
"What do we do now?" Harry whispered when he pulled back, leaning his burning forehead against Draco's. "What if our friends need us?"
Harry didn't bother to challenge him; it was true, more or less. He'd seen the cracks in Draco's mortality, but somehow the boy still managed to seem pretty much indestructible to everyone else. How did he bloody do it?
"Watch what you're bloody doing!" he said through gritted teeth, careful not to attract anyone else's attention with his tone. "Those are precious!"
Glass pierced through his soles, but if it penetrated all the way through he didn't react, and instead began casting spells to whip the paper up in a blizzard around his head.
"Not really," Malfoy replied in the usual lazy drawl that Harry found so attractive.
"Harry James Potter," Harry said, willing his own voice not to tremble.
. That certainly was a spanner in the works. "I'll work on him," he said quietly. "I sometimes have a knack for getting him to do what I want. But you're right, that could present an issue."
"I'm in love with you," Harry whispered suddenly, shock and devotion and shame bleeding into his words. "I'm in love with you, and I hope you know."
, and surveyed the damage.
Harry could see the real ones to the right of his head, discarded for the night on Malfoy's bedside table, but in the picture they were perfectly in place. The signet, the silver serpent, the jet stone, and the wide band with the Malfoy family motto looped around the inside -
"If we're going to do what, exactly?" Harry asked tentatively, trying desperately to catch his breath.
"I've never failed to pull in my life," he replied scornfully. "And for your information, they asked me to join them. I just told them not after last time."
Harry grinned through a mouthful of fried fish. "I'm so hungry I think I'm gonna throw up," he said happily.
"Ganymede?" he croaked, and again the Professor shook her head.
"-And I assume they will arrive on the morning of the 13th to remove you from the premises. Do you understand the reasoning for your expulsion?"
"I wish you wouldn't say things like that," Harry frowned.
"No?" Harry breathed. "Sounds alright to me!"
"Could be years," Blaise told him firmly. "He could be permanently damaged. But either way even if it's fixable, Draco won't be able to wait that long- you know, long enough for his brain to make those happiness chemicals naturally again. It takes self control, which you know he has in buckets, but it also takes the desire to stop."
"Not that I didn't bang her after, of course, but at least she can control herself while she's actually on the pitch."
Potter, meanwhile, was having a similar dilemma. He was sticking firmly to the walls of the Slytherin Common Room (having been allowed entrance after displaying Draco's invite), searching desperately for a blonde in the sea of serpents.
He couldn't believe Potter had said that in front of Snape, of all people, and didn't seem to give a single fuck about it now.
"Just try, would you?!" Harry waved his arms wildly in the air in front of Draco's face, as if trying to snap him into reality. "I'm not even asking you for romantic gestures, Draco, because I know you're fucking incapable. I just want you to fuck me sober, once, like you vaguely care about it. Like I'm not just a convenient way for you to get off. Maybe ask me how I am sometime too. Hey, how about this: maybe just don't hurt me any more."
"You were being fucking weird in there, mate," Ron informed him, following closely behind her. "Is there something actually wrong with you?"
"You can't bear to have one aspect of your life that doesn't work, can you, can't bear to see something corrupted and not redeem it?!" he continued furiously.
"Come to bed."
"Fine then," he said reluctantly. "Up we go."
Vanilla.
"What am I going to wear, Hermione?" he asked in a slightly croaky voice. "Friday's tomorrow - this is the most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me!"
Harry got the impression she was palming Malfoy onto him rather like a mother dropping her hyperactive child with an underpaid babysitter, but again he nodded. It didn't feel like his own feelings really came into the matter.
There was plenty more of Harry, in colour this time as he moved towards the back of the book. Malfoy had evidently been employing the new paints Harry gave him, and Harry had to admit he'd made a good choice with them.
"Look, Draco, I'm really sorry about what I did to you," he began. He got no response, so he tried again. "I truly am sorry. I feel like such a twat, I just-"
"Oh, that's an option, then, is it?" Harry snapped, irritated now. "And kissing me is the same to you as kissing Pansy?"
"That's great, Potter. but he's ill," Blaise sighed. "You have to remember that addiction is a disease. And he can't get really happy naturally any more, not the same way as you or I can. Why do you think he wants to have sex all the time?? Sure, he's a teenage boy, but he's a teenage boy with an ecstasy addiction. He's constantly craving serotonin."
As Harry looked closer he could see there was still soot staining Malfoy's perfect blonde hair, and with that he completely lost it.
Harry clenched his fists at his sides so hard he could feel the grooves his nails made in his skin.
prick!"
They'd been making the antidote to Veritaserum that lesson and, granted, Harry's wasn't looking good. Hermione had agreed to work with Ron that lesson so that left Harry stuck with Neville, and neither of them really had any idea what they were doing.
"That's because you were asking us top secret information, Draco," Pansy smirked. "Which we aren't going to tell you."
"He sees me," he responded slightly weakly, still half lost in these precious visions.
"A while," he said thoughtfully. "Not long enough."
"It isn't really Malfoy's fault," Harry said quietly, inspecting his fingers.
. It makes me fucking SICK, Potter, do you hear me?"
He'd been feeling calmer since the latest confrontation, and hadn't seen Malfoy half as much as he normally did over the past few days, which was a relief. Maybe he'd finally listened and agreed to stop tormenting him. Or maybe he was just cooking up something worse.
There was a pause, then he heard Draco's voice on the other side of the door. "Yeah, I'm here, you drowning?"
, Harry thought, willing his eyes not to well up behind his glasses. But that was a hard task when the boy that he loved was stood in front of him, literally saying he didn't want to treat him with anything other than disdain, and it hurt unimaginably much.
Harry faltered. "I don't know either, I just want a little more. You take advantage of me so much because you know I really-" he stopped himself as he saw Malfoy's face screw up- "Fine, I really care about you. Is that ok to say?"
"I saw him too!"
"I mean that I shouldn't have taken advantage of you physically the way I did," Draco shrugged. He put a hand over his eyes to shade them from the blazing sun, and his other hand traced over Harry's stomach, causing ripples under the skin wherever he touched. "I felt bad after I notched my broom with your line, for example. That wasn't how your virginity should've gone."
Loathing coursed through his entire body like acid, making every atom vibrate with wrath. It was as though his body was purely powered by rage against Draco Malfoy, and Harry hated it. He didn't even recognise himself.
Draco realised, and he groaned. "Get away from me, I said what I said!" he snapped, and Harry's face fell instantly.
He glanced over to Potter's work station, where he was apparently engaged in trying to blow up his cauldron as usual with Longbottom. Little terrorist.
He asked himself.
"Yeah, I know," Harry said quietly. "I kind of want it to hurt. Give me something to remember."
"I'm pretty sure I say 'awful things' when they aren't there too, if you remember our nice little chat the other day," he snapped. "And I'm more than happy to do it now too, away from everyone. Is this loud enough for you? Because I've got plenty to say."
"Er, Callisto?" Harry guessed after enough time had passed for it to be awkward, his voice higher pitched than usual.
"You know that Potions class where we brewed Amortentia?" he asked.
There was no way Malfoy had been actually high today - he was lucid, present, and seemed every inch his authentic self. He certainly hadn't struggled with getting it up. And besides, Harry knew he would've seen him sneaking a tab or a line if the occasion had arisen.
The end of the day came far sooner than Draco would have liked, and within minutes of the last bell, the castle was buzzing with everyone's excitement to be going home for Christmas. Professor McGonnagal was checking names off a register as Hagrid helped students up onto the thestral coaches, and Draco felt a sudden burst of longing to join them. It really wasn't going to be fun staying here over the break, with only Peeves, a few second-year losers and Potter for company.
Shame to have been seen so vulnerable, to have been made so weak as to apologise for his actions, shame to have given in so easily when he was meant to be ignoring the other boy - it was all unfamiliar and repulsive to Draco, and it clouded his mind with red fog.
Maybe he'd gone even further afield, and was living in some tucked-away town in the Alps, or a remote Italian village in the countryside surrounded by wildflower meadows.
"Want me to read your future, Malfoy?" Harry shot back aggressively. "It involves a fucking punch in the mouth."
While Draco inadvertently played the perfect part in distracting Potter with insults, it was not at all difficult for Pansy to slip down the front and deftly swap the sparkling pink liquid in Potter's vial for a replacement bottle of her own - identical in looks, but obviously very different in smell.
Draco paused, trying to work out if he felt remorse or embarrassment, but laughed it off - the other boys were staring. "I think you're misunderstanding my intentions, Granger," he said slowly, glancing around for his friends' reactions. "If Potter has got himself into some trouble, then that is a source of
"You left without saying goodbye," was all he managed. His voice cracked, and he knew he hadn't conveyed even a glimmer of what he'd wanted to say. He sounded pathetic, infantile, and Malfoy scoffed unsympathetically.
"I wont," he sulked. "I feel like being in a bad mood, so I am going to be in a bad mood."
"It's not like that," Harry huffed, but he realised with irritation that he couldn't explain it away any better than how they'd put it.
"Incendio," Harry muttered, waving his wand over the fireplace, which ignited immediately. He chucked the letter onto the fire, and stood watching to make sure it caught fire. The tongues flared green with ink, and then faded softly back to red. Gryffindor consuming Slytherin, Harry thought before he could stop himself.
Then one frosty morning in the last week of term, Harry realised that his infatuation with Draco Malfoy was unexpectedly over, and in its place was complete and helpless love for the other boy.
Harry turned to look at him as though he'd only just remembered he was there.
"So it's true, then? You aren't even going to try and deny it?"
"Withdrawal." Malfoy answered his question before it was even asked. "Detoxing is really hard."
He dropped to his knees softly, and Malfoy grabbed a fistful of dark hair to push his head right back for eye contact. His eyes swept the exposed skin of the other boy's throat. He could see the racing pulse in the sensitive hollow by his jugular, see the way his Adam's apple bobbed when he swallowed.
"He's done this before?" Harry asked, turning his attention back to the seething Malfoy.
Mallory shook his head. "Top secret information, apparently. They don't send that stuff by Owl. It's infuriating."
The next picture was a kiss, raw energy radiating from the moving lines, and "
"This is twice you've kissed me now and it always hurts," he persisted.
"What's that supposed to mean?!" Malfoy spluttered. It never failed to annoy and confuse him when Harry said that - because what was the right response? It was an impossible conundrum.
"Feels good though, doesn't it?" Harry asked breathlessly. "Hope you're glad I suggested it."
he asked himself angrily.
That next Saturday was a blazingly beautiful early Spring day, the sky a soft cornflower blue splashed with sunlight.
It was twenty-two months of carefully distanced friendship with Draco once the letters started, watching his progress slowly and supporting him, but never getting too close.
A small smile played over Draco's lips. "Normally I'm not. But you were special."
It wasn't an erotic dream - more just an extension of Malfoy's real-life behaviours - but it still made Harry deeply uncomfortable, as he felt it signalled a deeper level of consciousness being accessed by the other boy.
"Did he stay with you last night? Ginny was meant to come and ask you."
"I just need to get something," he said, and he straddled Harry to reach his drawers, putting more weight on him than he had before. He rummaged through his drawers and drew out a plastic sheet of blue tablets marked with a telltale 'V', the packet at least a quarter empty.
"I won't," Harry wept. "I won't get over you. Not ever."
"You can't Hex a member of staff, you fucking terrorist," Harry snarled, shaking the blonde roughly in an attempt to bring him back to his senses. "You're going to be in so much trouble, do you realise that?"
"Wow, huge scandal, Draco Malfoy can't think of a better insult again than to comment on someone's blood status! The way he does in every fucking argument he ever has where he isn't winning!" Harry laughed coldly. "Pathetic."
"OK, and pout just a little more for me, Harry.... and just hold that... nope, that's not working, try a little more bad boy. Yeah. Go on, really glower, emphasize those cheekbones. Dark eyes, brows down... Okay, a bit more, I'm not feeling it. No. Awful. Worse. Horrific. It's all wrong, ugh! I want smoulder, not whatever the fuck you're doing," Lucius Malfoy snapped, running his hands through his silvery blonde hair as he paced up and down in front of Harry. He sighed dramatically. They'd been working on this particular shoot for two hours already without a break, and Lucius was starting to get frustrated.
He didn't know what made him say it: that particular phrase. And he certainly didn't know how appropriate it would become.
"Oh, but we can," Pansy smiled. "You'll find out soon enough, though. And it'll be glorious."
Somewhere in his rush of humiliation and hurt, Harry realised that Malfoy's expression mirrored his own feelings exactly. He looked angry, but like he was hurting somehow, and if he hated Harry so much, why was he leaning in...?
"Come to bed, darling."
So no, he realised, it hadn't been ecstasy in Malfoy's system.
"He wouldn't do that," Ron rolled his eyes. "He isn't a full idiot, Hermione. Maybe only half."
The letter berated Harry angrily.
Lots of people were attracted to Draco, he knew that. It was the whole sexy, insufferable, Daddy-issues, rich boy thing he had going on. But Potter? That was new.
"That's all I want from him," he'd told Ron and Hermione in a tearful confession one night. "I'm so sick of watching him come up and down, I want him level and stable for once."
"Come on, then," he said, slapping an encouraging hand on Harry's back. "It's time."
"Nah, you've got to tell me," he glared at his friends, getting to his feet and spinning his wand through his fingers. "Besides, think I don't know Legilimency? Hope you're an Occlumens, Blaise. We'll soon find out one way or another."
"N-no, it was nice."
"Oh, I'm not supposed to be here because none of you like me?" Malfoy asked in a mocking voice. "Is that supposed to hurt my feelings? Shut the fuck up. At least ten of you have sucked my dick."
"You do it," came Malfoy's reply, and Harry could feel the smirk without lifting his wand to see it.
The Charmed paints he'd bought for Malfoy were evidently recognising the gentleness in his feelings at the moment rather than the usual rage, and this was reflected in the subconscious splash of sea greens and pearly blues they produced on the page, mingled in with the odd blush of pink.
His left hand slipped subconsciously up to press against the mark left on his cheekbone, the only sign of his dishonesty. The mark would fit Potter's knuckles precisely.
"I'll be your character reference in court," Harry had insisted, but he was met with a violent head-shake from Draco through the bars of his temporary cell.
Harry paused. "He's a fucking mess," he said quietly after checking to make sure that the few remaining others around them weren't listening. "I had to save him after he all but drowned in the Lake in the middle of the night last night. Gave him the kiss of life and everything. And I hate that now he's just strolling about like it didn't even happen."
But Hermione and Ron's cause for concern increased as the end of the term drew nearer and Harry began to be missing more often than he was around.
He despised himself so much for permitting it to happen in the first place. It wasn't like he could really have said no, but to have actively allowed his parents to Mark his forearm the way they did... the way he'd been dreading it and then so readily accepted when the time came... it was hateful to remember.
Harry and Draco's relationship was still a little cautious, wary, but war had changed them, there was no denying that. It stripped the capacity for malice away from them, so they were just two uncomplicated souls desperate to be around one another again.
He hated himself for giving in so fast once the pitch was empty though, and melting so easily into the kiss Malfoy offered him against the back of the changing room building.
Malfoy didn't seem convinced, though he also looked far less apprehensive than before.
"Liar!" Malfoy called back with an eye roll. "It's
Draco sighed and pressed his forehead against the cool glass of his dormitory window, watching the last coach pull away into the fog.
"So you can leave me alone now?"
"What happened, then?" Ron asked reluctantly. "With Ginny."
"What were you going to tell me?" he asked, keeping his voice soft in the hopes that Malfoy would let his guard down, be Draco again. "About why you had to stay high."
"Mallory," Harry nodded politely, shaking the other man's hand. He respected the lawyer; he seemed like a genuinely decent guy. He wasn't old and stuffy like a lot of the usual Pureblood legal advocates, but sharp and not too long out of training, yet clearly knowledgable and good at his job. This all seemed like a good sign to Harry.
Harry groaned. "I really don't need this stress. I mean, I'm already anxious enough about the game - if Malfoy lets me get that far without beating the shit out of me, that is."
But as he leaned in, Malfoy left his brush pressed to the parchment, and on the corner of the page, bolts of lightning appeared to shoot out from the tip. Radiant colour spilled over the book, vibrant hues that felt oddly familiar to Harry, and when he saw them down on paper his mouth fell open.
"You're more than capable," Harry rolled his eyes fondly, but his hands went diligently to the buckle of Draco's belt, undoing it with as much care as he could, keeping the operation clean and clinical and distinctly un-sexual.
It was his favourite picture of her, the one of her last Christmas playing in the snow in the garden behind their old house. Her tiny bobble hat was slipping off her dark hair, and her cheeks glowed red, laughing up at the camera in her adorable new pink puffa jacket and matching snow boots and little mittens.
When he told Ron and Hermione of his plan, they burst out laughing.
"Thanks," Harry nodded awkwardly, not sure why he was thanking the other boy. "Daphne said."
"And since I've become close to him in this past year," Harry continued. "I have noticed a problem Draco's got in his personal life."
Harry wasn't sure Malfoy deserved a gift, if truth be told, but he hadn't known what else to do. He wasn't sure Malfoy deserved love either, but he still gave him that, didn't he?
"Seems legit," Harry nodded. "Let's be real, we've all wanked over me at some point."
Harry felt a lump grow in his throat, thinking back to Christmas. Draco had left him then without saying goodbye - surely he wouldn't do the same again this time?
"Thank you so much for having her, guys," he said gratefully, hugging his best friends tightly.
"No problem. You know what, Harry, though it pains me to say it, I may have finally found someone prettier than me," Draco frowned.
"I just don't understand why you had to be so weird, Harry!" Hermione pouted as they walked. "Or why you smashed it, when we worked so hard to get it right. I didn't even get to smell it for myself, and now I suppose I'll never know-"
"Three Broomsticks won't know what's bloody hit them the way you eat when you're hungry," Draco shook his head. "Have I ever told you what fucking dreadful table manners you have?"
He had helped himself to a scarlet lollipop from one of the tables, more for something to do with his hands than a real desire for sugar, and ground his teeth against it awkwardly.
Part of him was aware that it was a good opportunity to get his own back on Potter for all his recent tormenting, though, and when had Draco ever passed up a chance to hurt the other boy before, if one arose?
"Come on, Potter," he said gleefully, standing up and stretching ostentatiously. "You not coming to Charms?"
Draco was surprised to find that it did feel good, and he was glad.
," he wheedled. "
Draco zoned out. He didn't need to learn all this fortune shite, it was all made up anyway. Potter was still muttering angrily with his friends; presumably it was about the troublemaker sat on the Slytherin side of the classroom. Nothing new there then.
But before he could actually respond, the younger girl had reached boldly out and began to dryly rub Draco's crotch over the duvet. The contact felt like an electric shock; his senses kicked in and he recoiled.
!" Draco screamed, dragging Harry up roughly by his wrist and bolting away from the inferno that was Hogwarts School. It felt like a volcanic eruption behind them as the ground shook hard enough to propel them both forwards onto their faces, but they were up again in seconds and running again.
The first picture that caught his eye following the inscription was an intricate drawing of a hand. It was unmistakably Draco's own: those exquisite fingers had found their way to Harry's face and throat enough times for him to know it anywhere.
"Fuck you, Potter," Malfoy snapped, but he pulled his robes off his shoulders, and let them fall to the grass. Then he kicked off his shoes, unbuckled his belt, wriggled out of his trousers, and off came his shirt, socks, boxers, and finally his rings.
"Why?" Malfoy frowned. "I probably won't sleep anyway and this isn't exactly my first time getting high. I know what I'm doing."
"Just don't look at him, mate," was Ron's advice. "Block him out."
Draco's broom dipped and soared underneath him, turning with the slightest tilt of his weight, and he crouched low over the smooth handle to gain speed. He dragged the back of his hand across his eyes to wipe away his angry tears and did a quick flip through the goalpoast, feeling suddenly free. He spun again, and again, over and over until he was dizzier than the time his team had had to share the Gryffindor changing rooms. This was fun.

The boys were still laughing when they walked into the Three Broomsticks a few minutes later, much to the surprise of many of the regulars in there. They'd often enjoyed the Potter-Malfoy feuds that they'd witnessed in the pub when the boys had come inside in past years on school visits to Hogsmeade, and thus was a far cry from that kind of drama.
One night, after a swim so late that the Lake was indistinguishable from the sky, Harry paused on the staircase up to the Gryffindor dormitories. Pictured Malfoy's bed lying empty in the Slytherin dorms, pictured his own white costume robes on the bedpost from after the infamous Slytherin party.
"Well, is he there now?" Ron asked, just as Ginny rounded the corner, fists balled at her sides.
He had hardly slept and felt increasingly shit on the comedown from Draco's 'fairy wine' from the night before - he was right, ecstasy was a hell of a drug. Still, he'd been warned that this part wouldn't be fun.
Harry nodded sympathetically. "Want a distraction?" he offered.
"I hate him too," Weaslette nodded, her head on one side and a devilish look in her eyes.
She looked around to check that Draco was engrossed in his book on the other side of the room, and then wordlessly held up the ink-spattered parchment. A matching smile of glee spread across Blaise's face as he read what she'd written.
"Of course I'm sure," Draco scoffed. "What do you take me for, Potter? I may be a Slytherin but I wasn't gonna rape you, for fuck's sake."
"How very bloody Slytherin," Ron scoffed at the whole formality of the exchange.
His eyes flickered open, just a tiny crack, and instantly he met the eyes he wanted to see most in the world. Draco's eyes were blurry with tears and dismay, but they were still fixed on Harry's - and he noticed the jolt of realisation in them as they made eye contact.
"I would if you wanted to be poisoned like I want it," Malfoy whispered. his eyes were grey hollows in his face. "If you wanted to escape your head the way I do."
"Granger blackmailed me," he said. "I suspect she wants me to apologise, which of course I won't. The only thing I'm sorry about is that I had to touch you last night to prove my point."
"I fancy Draco Malfoy, Mum," he whispered to the sky one night as he lay awake in bed, "But he hates me more than anyone else in the world."
He sighed, his breath making dragon clouds in the frosty air as he did so. "Are you coming inside?" he asked impatiently. "Because it's now-" he checked his watch- "Quarter to 5 in the morning. And I don't want to be here, but in some way that I don't quite understand, I'm responsible for you."
No, instead he would ignore the other boy entirely, hope he got bored, and then forget about the whole thing. Hopefully.
It was only once he was outside in the fresh air that Harry realised he was crying a little. Mortified, he glanced around quickly to ensure that no one else was around; thankfully they weren't.
Silence.
"Had enough?" Harry simpered sarcastically. "This a bit much for you?"
He decided to clarify. "It just feels weird when you're so high and I'm not, like I'm taking advantage of you. I'm not sure if you can consent."
Wherever he was, Harry hoped he was happy. Most of all, he hoped he came back.
He got his reaction- Malfoy's eyes narrowed with a menacing glare, and he pressed his chest up against Harry's again to force him to look up. "Keep my father's name out of your filthy mouth, you little bastard," he snapped, and Harry felt that surge of power again.
"What's the matter with you?" Draco hissed as Potter pulled his books over to a desk nearer the tower's windows. "Afraid I might finger you?"
"Ugh, Granger, get
"Since we were 11," Harry responded. "We met in our first year of Hogwarts."
"We'll cross them," Ron rolled his eyes. "Have fun, Mr. Mystery."
"He's the best seeker in the school," Draco smiled proudly. "Well, maybe second, after me. Ow, ow, stop that! Yes, fine, he's the first best. And I love watching him play because his eyes get all light and happy vand his cheeks flush pink with excitement and it's the prettiest thing."
Bloody Pansy and Blaise. He wouldn't forgive them in a hurry. Draco was very good at a lot of things, but it had to be said that holding grudges was one of his specialities, a trait he prided himself on more than he probably should.
Before Harry could stop him, he'd leant in and pressed his lips firmly, deliberately, against Harry's. They were warm and soft without the fangs of the previous night, and sweet, unlike the salt of the tears on Harry's own lips, and it took every atom in Harry's body to fight the urge to melt into the sensation.
"Do you have any idea how especially hurtful what you did last night was?" he asked. "Do you know the significance of the date, for example?"
Neville worried away at his lip. "Fine, forget I said anything," he said after an awkward while, and Harry shot him an unkind glare.
"Wanted to see you," Draco said awkwardly. "S'alright, I had a letter to write, I was fine."
On a sudden, almost uncontrollable impulse, Harry closed the distance between the two of them and kissed Draco hard on the mouth, anything to stop him saying those cruel, hurtful things, anything to satisfy his own desire. He'd never wanted to be kissed so badly in his life.
He paused, remembering. "Also sometimes he takes his sweater off after he lands on the pitch so I can see his abs and those little indentations over his hipbones and I have wet dreams for weeks."
Harry felt much better after a long hot shower, washing the snow and the cold out of this hair, but he couldn't quite relax for worrying that Malfoy was going to burst in. Harry had hastily declined the other boy's offer to join him in the shower ("to save water") and made him solemnly promise not to come in, but his instincts told him not to trust the little snake.
"What did we do to each other?" Harry gasped when he could finally breathed again, and Draco just shook his head and pulled him in for another kiss.
"Get high, then," was Malfoy's suggestion.
And so they did, though there had been one occasion where Draco himself had come up to the dorms to knock for Harry, weeping at 3 in the morning.
"Is he..." Harry's voice trailed off.
"Why the hell would I tell him anything?" Harry yelled back, angry now. "He's a bloody poltergeist! And when would I have told him, hmm? Bearing in mind you were the last person I saw last night and you were in the Hall with him before me this morning!"
"Potter!" he said in surprise when he saw Harry. "What are you doing here?"
So he stored up every interaction in his mind, every shove, every arrogant comment, every vicious insult, and at night with the drapes of his bed drawn, he would replay them again in all their agonising glory.
He left his tongue in there long after Harry had swallowed, swirling it gently around the inside of his mouth, and Harry reciprocated gladly. Every nerve was heightened by the chemicals in what they'd drunk, every cell in their bodies appeared to be animated and fizzing, and even just kissing was heavenly.
"Er, the Map?" Hermione asked weakly, for once quite panicked as to what she should say. "It's a sort of code name we use for an, er, book we have... nothing for you to worry about."
But under the surface, Draco was also still struggling to come to terms with the revelation. He hadn't realised how dependent his ego truly was on Potter's interest in him until he thought that it was taken away, and found himself desperate for validation where he could get it.
By the time all the letters were written and either sent or hidden, Harry's hand was aching horribly. He got up, flexing his fingers, and stirred through the ashes with a black iron poker until the remains of his note to Malfoy had completely disintegrated.
Harry sighed, and turned over again to try and sleep, but quickly realised it was no use. His mind was racing, his stomach was full and there was a heightening sensation just beneath it as his mind drifted back to the events of the day.
Harry widened his eyes in mock horror. "What, that Potter kid?"
Malfoy's voice was low, dangerous. "Show me on your knees."
Draco kept his word, and Harry was overwhelmed with relief to see him again when he peeled back the drapes of the bed.
Starting it was the hard part - should he say his name properly? 'Dear Malfoy' sounded a bit wooden. Though maybe 'dear' was a bit sentimental.
It swiftly became clear to Harry, and to everyone else, that Malfoy was trying to hurt him with this kiss rather than anything else - those fangs were sharp and making his lip lightly bleed - but he was too numbed by alcohol and overwhelmed to care.
Malfoy had naturally been even more vile since the incident - Harry knew he shouldn't have tried to kiss him, but found it hard to regret at the same time.
"For ecstasy," Harry responded. "That would be detectable in his blood, right? Even long after the Mark was performed?"
"Bastard!" He shrieked. Draco laughed back delightedly. He hadn't had this much fun in ages.
Malfoy ignored him for a second, his hand moving faster.
"I've never wanted anything more," Harry replied, aware that he sounded more than a little needy.
"Hard, Potter?" the blonde called with a gloating grin the second the Gryffindors flew onto the pitch.
A low groan ripped through with agony tore from Malfoy's throat as Harry's foot made contact, and his friends' grasps relaxed just enough to him allow him to double over, gritting his teeth to stem his whimpers of pain.
Instantly, Harry was livid. "Oh, you were meant to finally apologise, were you?" he snapped nastily. "Let me see, would that be for-"
Harry nodded, still shivering. "But if you take me to Madam Puddifoot's stupid fucking tea room, you're dumped," he managed.
He pulled back the covers with shaking hands, careful not to crease them as he did so, and then did the same thing down the soft sheets where Draco slept. He stayed on his knees for a while, drinking in the scent, then groaned and sank his face into his hands. He was getting aroused, he couldn't deny it, and he hated himself for it. Hot embarrassment coursed through his body even though no one was around to see, and loathing quickly followed.
Yet it wasn't gentle in the way it was when he was high. Draco seemed present and more aware of his surroundings, and enthusiastic too.
He took a deep, shaky breath.
Harry watched as the boy helped himself to fruit and toast, but didn't touch any of the juice or coffee on offer, instead swigging occasionally from an embossed metal water bottle with identical thirst each time. Something about the sight didn't sit right with Harry, and then he suddenly realised why, and it enraged him.
Draco was wonderful on ecstasy, Harry decided. He wondered what it would be like to have that all the time, the way they'd discussed that night. Delirious, he presumed.
"I'm going to find Malfoy," she declared, snatching up her wand and striding towards the door, her curls flowing behind her.
But as it was, he knew he had to go without. "
No, he decided, he had more self restraint. Apart from that attempted kiss, Harry knew he'd done a good job of keeping up the pretence of hatred - not that it much of a pretence was necessary; even nowadays he harboured more than a little resentment for the other boy on top of his attraction.
"What for?" Malfoy asked. "I'm purely thinking of my own enjoyment here, Harry. Sex is absolutely RUINED if the other person isn't up for it, take it from me. It's shite. In fact, as a boy with a very active giving kink, I'd put non-con down as a definite turn off."
Or perhaps, "It should be bubbling up now, Potter! You're going to want it hotter than that!"
Malfoy shrugged him off aggressively and stared down at Harry's face, his eyes burning.
He grabbed his broom from the Slytherin common room and ran out to the pitch, barely stopping to pull his shirt and tie off with his trousers, and drag his green and white Quidditch uniform on in their place. He wasn't technically allowed out to fly on his own, but he'd never been one for rules and he needed to feel the wind through his hair, the stinging of the rain against his flushed cheeks.
"Do you want to go down to my dorm?" Malfoy asked thoughtfully. "I have something I could show you."
choose to subject us to your thoughts, Miss Granger," Snape mused cruelly. "Fifteen further points from Gryffindor."
Mallory's eyes widened with full realisation. "He was high when he was Marked, wasn't he?" he asked. "He couldn't legally consent-"
"Couldn't pull anyone for yourself, then?" Harry asked unkindly, but Draco laughed, not even bothering to grace him with a look.
On an impulse, he grabbed Harry's screwed up soaking face - clumsily, hastily - and pressed a soft kiss to his lips, trying to convey all the horror of his emotions in one simple motion. And then he walked away. He'd done what he was asked to do. He hoped Harry understood.
Harry couldn't keep up.
By the time Harry had written his apology it was light outside and time to head for breakfast, after a quick trip to the Owlery with the freshly inked parchment.
"How long have you been out here?" he asked, and Malfoy shrugged. He took a red lollipop out of his pocket, the same ones Harry had seen the last time he'd seen him high, and slipped it into his mouth to calm his grinding jaw.
As Harry drifted back to his body, the first thing he became aware of was Hagrid's firm huge hands cupping him to his vast chest, and the feeling of his sobs over Harry's head.
Not because of Draco fucking Lucius Malfoy.
"If you can't take this seriously, I won't tell you guys things," Harry sulked.
"You're a fucking mess, you know that?" he asked. "Do you have any idea how reckless you're being?"
He chanced a peek Malfoy's direction, but Malfoy was staring straight ahead, a muscle in his jaw flexing. If he'd even noticed Harry come in, he didn't show it. Harry sighed again. Fuck. He was really hungry now, he'd forgotten what hard work writing letters was.
So distraught, in fact, that he decided not to even get on the Express; he didn't want to ruin the Weasleys' Christmas with his own colossal feelings. Better to attempt to deal with the thoughts on his own over the holidays.
Malfoy smiled a hateful, condescending little smile. "I feel like you need to just stop hurting yourself over me, Potter," he said. "It's getting embarrassing."
, he opted for.
It seemed hypocritical to say he hated Harry when his bed was still soaked in Harry's scent from the night before, when his sheets were practically still warm from the shape of Harry's body, and his lips were bruised from Harry's mouth.
"Are you going to kiss me, Malfoy?" he pressed again. It was glorious to be in control, to watch Malfoy fidget uncomfortably for a change. "You going to put your tongue in my mouth again?"
"What did you do, Malfoy?" the girl demanded, ignoring his question. "Harry's gone and it's obviously to do with you because all you do is hurt him, so tell us what you fucking did this time!"
"The stairs?!"
"Yeah, I'd like that," he said. "Stay with me."
"Oh, shit, indeed," Hermione yelled. The volume made him jump. "Surely you've seen what you've been doing to him recently? He isn't
Harry was still reeling from the shock when Blaise and Theo appeared in the doorway, and each of them gasped when they saw the mess the library was in. They wasted no time in wrestling their friend fully away from Harry ("I thought he wasn't your problem any more, Potter?" Blaise added snidely) and attempted to drag him out of the library, but he put up a good fight.
Harry pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose with two fingers, a light pink tinge running up the slant of his cheekbones. His confident façade had slipped a little and God, he was so cute.
"Oh, Harry, God!"
Was he supposed to be grateful? He supposed he was, but just nodded numbly.
"He can't," Draco glared. "He's got very important business, you wouldn't understand. Top secret Ministry work, or so I believe. He's got a lot of influence, my father."
"There are always huge trials after wars," Harry replied shakily, still realising the horror of what he was saying as he spoke. "You'll be tried as a war criminal, Draco - you were on the wrong side, and now you can't say you weren't because you're Marked - oh, my God-"
There was a question underlying it, though, which had been bothering him for a while, and Harry felt he needed to get the answer before anything progressed that night. He wasn't sure exactly how to broach it but sheer curiosity swiftly got the better of him. "Malfoy," he began, "Have you ... have you done anyone since me?"
Harry felt his lip curl into a mean grin, remembering Draco's outburst in the library earlier. "I don't think that's a good idea, Malfoy," he said coldly. "That's something friends do, and you hope I die, right?"
"Lots of purple ones."
The boy was very attractive, but right now Harry was far more focused on how intimidating he was - the blonde was a good three inches taller and always knew exactly what to say to make Harry want to disappear.
"I'm going to bed," he said, his voice shaking slightly with emotion. "You should probably leave now."
As he dressed and then collected everything he needed for his plans, Harry hummed cheerfully to himself. It was going to be a good day.
"What the fuck, Malfoy?!" someone yelled, and others joined in. Malfoy was a picture of brazen amusement.
"Pretty much, yeah. I'm fucked up like that."
Harry couldn't help thinking,
"No, I'm just being realistic," he said, and his time was resigned. Final. "He's done it before, OK? I've seen it. And you should know, it's ... it's always worse on a relapse. He can be quite dramatic."
"You can't blame all the faults between the two of you on Daddy issues, Harry," Hermione told him, but she was smiling gently.
"Could you maybe want to see me sometimes when you aren't high, or just wanting sex?" Harry asked in a quiet little voice, his eyes fixed on his own hands, which were twisting in his lap.
This was the angriest kiss Harry had ever received in his life, including even the Halloween one when the sole purpose had been to draw blood - and he completely loved it.
Draco lay down beside him then, and took Harry's face above him in his hands. His fingers traced coolly over the hot skin of his jaw, then found their way into the curve of his jugular. The blood was close to the surface of the skin there; he could feel it throbbing against his fingertips as he pressed. He opened his mouth to speak, but Harry pushed two fingers to his lips to stop him.
"Bugger," he scowled down at the mug. There was a lot of caffeine in there; he might as well kiss goodbye to the idea of getting to sleep in the next few hours. His stylist was going to give him hell in the morning, but that wasn't anything new either. Stylists were usually short-tempered, shit at their job and unable to put up with Harry for more than four or five shoots, and his current one was reaching the end of her tether.
Later, he dressed in front of the mirror, hardly breaking eye contact with the eyes that stared impassively back at him. Lily's eyes, Lupin said, Sirius said. Had they ever looked this empty? Greenless, ringed with ghostly shadows. Like one of Draco's drawings.
"Ginny, can you stop being so bitter?" he asked. "I told you before that I do hate him, and I want to be with you if you'll let me. The only barrier between us right now is you, so stop pretending I've done anything wrong."
When he eventually managed to say it, it was on his last night at school. "I'm leaving tomorrow," he announced, as casually as he could manage. Harry was lying beside him in bed, the red drapes drawn and a Muffling spell cast for privacy.
your fault is your reaction. You fucking
His friends gave him a long, hard stare. He quickly re-evaluated his response.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Wasn't quite the description I was looking for, Ronald, but it'll do."
"You do that all the time in front of Malfoy, what's different now?" Ron asked, earning himself a swift elbow from Hermione.
Draco left in a daze, a million thoughts tearing up his mind. How was he going to tell Potter? He hated that that thought was at the forefront, but it really bothered him.
"The bastard's always thought he's some sort of God," Ron muttered. "Thinks he's bloody invincible."
"Should've acted like it," Harry quipped, and the other boy nodded.
He replayed the incident in his head relatively often as he did this, mentally watching the half-devastated, half-aroused expression on Potter's face as he'd shoved him back and spat on him.
"People are looking, Potter, don't cause a scene," said Malfoy witheringly. "I'll see you tonight."
He popped one out and broke off half, which he necked with a drag of his wine. It looked like a little piece of blue chalk on his tongue. "Do you want the other half?" he asked. "I can tell the drink has affected you the same way."
Harry cleared his throat. "Those paints, then," he offered, an attempt to move on from the awkwardness.
Malfoy's hand obeyed. Harry squirmed. It was between two now: Io and Europa, and he knew full well which it was. He wondered if he should get it wrong on purpose - Malfoy's hand was tantalisingly close to his crotch, and he wanted to see whether the other boy would actually go there.
He faltered, the first crack in his perfect façade.
Harry put his hand thoughtfully into his pocket for his wand, but instead his fingers closed around a crumpled piece of parchment. He pulled it out and read it curiously. Fuck, it was the first letter he'd written for Malfoy yesterday after he'd stormed out the library!
Hermione sighed, resting her head against his chest. She could feel how hard his heart was beating, and her own heart hurt for him.
"And you can all stop staring if you know what's fucking good for you," he snarled.
!" in a voice torn and cracked with anguish.
He supposed what was hurting him was really the betrayal of his friends. They'd always played small tricks on each other when they were younger, but Draco had assumed that they'd all grown out of it by now, and knew better than to put his Malfoy honour at risk like this. Didn't they know what such a scandal could do to Draco if his father heard of it? It was reckless, thoughtless behaviour and it didn't bear thinking about.
"You know I want that," Harry smiled softly. "But this is you and me we're talking about. I don't think we even know what that kind of stability is."
Harry hurtled into the Great Hall just as the pudding plates were disappearing, and sighed in dismay. He'd completely missed it. Typical.
"Oh, that's interesting! I sprayed some Amortentia before I came up," shot back Harry sarcastically, generating some laughter of his own. "Wouldn't have had you down as the bestial type though, Malfoy. Interesting."
Harry laughed. "You know Malfoy, most boys would have said 'thanks' or 'you too' or something in response to that," he pointed out.
"And you're fucking perfect, aren't you?" Malfoy beamed back. There was a fine line between sarcasm and sincerity, and Harry had no idea where that sentence fell on it.
"Can I have yours then, if you're done?" He asked, switching his newly empty plate for Draco's half-full one before he could refuse.
Another pause as the words sank in. Mallory took a sip from his water bottle to soothe his throat; his hands were calm and steady.
Malfoy glared down at the incriminating page, boldly bright against his feigned indifference. Evidence of his feelings for Potter, evidence of the effect he could have on him.
"Disgusting," he said, but the words '
"Ok, you absolute misery," Harry rolled his eyes back. "The first thing I want is for you to fucking lighten up. But failing that - I brought you an apple pie from breakfast because I imagine you're hungry, and we're going to go and study together by the lake."
"Fantastic."
Harry laughed nervously. "Thank you."
A sudden flash of white hot panic ran through Draco over the memory of what Harry might have seen in the book before. How long had he been sat there that morning? How had he managed to still love him afterwards?
He pointed to the final spell on the list. "There is evidence that it changed hands to perform the
"Always," Harry said dreamily, only half-joking. He paused, soaking in the moment and enjoying the wash of sugar over his tongue. "Draco?"
Just hypothetically, of course.
"Thanks," Harry snorted, taking the clothes and placing them by one of the mirrors. "You can leave now."
"Ok, well, you have got to leave me alone," Harry insisted.
"Where are you going? Will you come back?" Draco asked.
They'd won the following match, and the next, and were shaping up to win the last match before Christmas, too.
Harry, by the time Malfoy found him, was even less in the mood than usual to act as a venting board for the other boy's problems, having just had an argument with Neville Longbottom, of all people.
Towards the end of the lesson, Snape wandered round and placed a little heart-shaped glass bottle on everyone's work station, to contain what little potion they had made, and everyone got to emptying their cauldrons precariously into the neck.
"Fucking Potter," he muttered darkly again. Who did he think he was, with his pretty smile and his stupid assumptions? Fuck him. But also FUCK him.
The image was still in his head even when bedtime rolled around. Malfoy's skin, starkly pale against the pop of colour on his tongue, that beautiful vivid colour that would send the chemicals pouring through his bloodstream and transform him into that heavenly figure Harry had met at the Christmas party.
The following night, Harry's dreams took a darker turn.
There was a tortured silence as the words hung in the air. He hated himself for hoping Draco would say it back.
"Password?" the serpent on the portrait demanded, and Harry sighed.
in love with you, Draco?" some younger Slytherin girls simpered over dinner at the Great Hall.
And Harry screamed.
"Are you sure, Potter?" Blaise asked uncertainly. "We can help you, you don't have to take him alone."
"Yeah," Draco nodded. "You'll get anxious, dizzy, paranoid - it's not fun. Even when you take the really really good shit, which, for your information, the stuff you took was."
"You don't seem sorry," Malfoy replied with a curl of his lip. "Show me how sorry you are."
"God, that woman," he muttered slightly proudly. He knew she was about to give Malfoy hell.
The next time Harry saw Malfoy again, he was on the wrong side of the war.
Harry's cheeks flared red, and he made to stand up, but Weasley put a restraining arm across his chest, hissing something in his ear about 'not worth it'. The blonde boy laughed again.
"Get the FUCK away from me, Peeves!" Draco shrieked, wiping his face aggressively on his robe sleeve and lobbing his spoon after the laughing poltergeist. His shouts and the clanging of the spoon echoed around the hall as he flounced out, and everyone turned to stare at Harry.
"I won't ask you again to shut up," Malfoy warned him, real danger edging over his tongue. After a shaky breath, Harry decided to risk it.
Harry's mouth was warm and tasted like blood and jellybeans and rain, and Malfoy skimmed his own teeth roughly over the bitten part of Harry's lip to see what would happen. He was highly amused when the smaller boy's whole body stiffened in a sharp gasp of shock.
"I just don't want you around me right now," Draco shivered, humiliation still coursing through his veins.
Harry had shot him the most dangerous warning glare he could muster, but the Slytherin swallowed the tab too fast, an insolent smirk on his face.
"Thirsty, Potter?" Draco asked with amusement, though he helped himself to a second glass from the table, too.
Was it a caption? An afterthought? A diary entry? It was hard for Harry to tell, but it thrilled him either way, and he kept turning the pages to drink in each new confession, each new glorious image from Malfoy's brain.
"I think the woman's got her priorities all out of order," Molly Weasley tutted, clattering a steaming plate in front of each of the boys before turning for Hermione's. "If it were one of my sons, I'd do whatever it took."
"Pansy sent me," Daphne replied. "Draco's being a prat on the Lake and keeps calling for you. Won't let anyone else take him home."
"Don't make it too soft," she advised him cautiously. "Don't give him ammunition."
"I love this," Harry rasped, voice strained from focus and pleasure. "I love what you do to me. I love watching your face screw up above mine. I love the way your hair falls in your face-"
, he mentally responded.
"You wanted to taste my spit, Potter," Draco snarled in the cruelest voice Harry had ever heard. "That's the only way you're ever going to get it, you freak. Lick. It. Up."
He paused. "I was gonna say I won't be too long but you look like the kind of guy who gets off in about twenty seconds flat on a good day, so we could be alright. Especially if you're thinking about me. You're gonna be so spent, Potter."
Harry had even managed to get his place back on the Gryffindor Quidditch team by early November after three weeks off, much to Ginny's anger and disappointment.
Harry looked at him, trying to get inside his mind. What was it Malfoy felt? Derision? Irritation? It couldn't be lack of attraction, he'd proved that countless times now. He always seemed to desire Harry, more than Harry even wanted him sometimes, which was crazy.
Harry reached down straight away to prise off his tight black shoes, which had been absolutely killing him all day, then Apparated straight to the Weasley's to see Lily.
he tried to tell Harry with his eyes.
"Is this about the ecstasy thing again?" Ron frowned. "Why is she so desperate for you not to mention that when it's so useful in Malfoy's case?"
"What I really want is for you to leave me alone," Harry managed. He backed into the wall as he spoke, but forced himself to retain eye contact. Who would break it first?
Yet the more Malfoy hated Harry and the nastier he was to him, the more persistently interested he became in response. It was the only way he'd ever known how to relate to the other boy, the only attention he could get off him, and he relished it. He craved a reaction from him, any reaction, even disgust.
"It isn't the 'inkling' that 'someone might' want me, Potter, it's
"Beyond infuriating," Harry glared, and let out a loud, aggravated sigh. "OK, well, we'll just have to do the best with what we've got. I'll be a good character reference, you be a good lawyer, hopefully we have nothing to worry about."
He slept better that night than he had in weeks.
"Not got so much to say for yourself now, have you, Malfoy?" he breathed. Draco whined and fidgeted against Harry's forceful hips, trying to switch positions. He hated not being the one in control.
Draco looked out of the window, and laughed. "Wanna go for a walk?" He suggested, holding out his hand. Harry paused, then took it. Malfoy's fingers were long and his rings were cool against Harry's skin, digging in slightly, but it was a comfortable kind of pressure.
Harry was brushed off rudely when he'd attempted to discuss it himself, of course. "Is this just what you do then?" he'd asked irately when he caught Malfoy one evening on his way to Hall. "Just hit and run?"
"Obviously I'm going to get hard if someone touches me like that, Malfoy, don't flatter yourself," Harry sighed.
"High?" Daphne checked with another expressive roll of her eyes. Harry was beginning to find her attitude quite wearing; why were all Slytherins like this?
"Talk with your mouth full like that again, and I'm gonna piss on your chips," Draco said, and Harry spluttered with laughter. A small piece of spitty chip actually flew from his mouth across the table and landed by Draco's plate.
"How will I know when it's time?" Draco faltered. "I thought this was just getting good again!"
"So does this mean Harry fights Malfoy, then?" Hermione asked with a wry grin. "Just so he doesn't feel left out."
"Just the effect you have on me, Malfoy," Harry grinned. His heart rate was going wild and he hoped Draco couldn't feel it through his shirt.  The Slytherin's face was so close above Harry's that he could see the individual tiny snowflakes on his eyelashes, feel his breath on his mouth.
"Fine," Harry had whispered back as he slid under the covers and breathed in her familiar scent. "Thank you."
He smiled to himself. Time to see how far Potter's remorse would go, and how much Draco could take advantage of it.
"I'm not a virgin," interrupted Harry hotly, and he knew Malfoy was rolling his eyes bedside him without even looking up.
"I don't care! I literally don't care! You should've tried harder to not hurt me with it," Harry's voice cracked as he spoke. "Because actually, shit like this inevitably always is your fault, Draco, whatever you say."
Dusk was drawing in around them, and both boys became aware that it would be cold soon. Early May was not particularly forgiving that year, and neither of them fancied sleeping outside.
' were echoing loudly around his ears again, practically scorching him with their volume and potency.
"Nice?" Harry laughed. "Do you
"Oh no," Harry's eyes widened in mock horror. "Then you might kiss me again, better not do that!"
Harry, meanwhile, was having an enormous identity crisis over coming to terms with his memory of the Amortentia experience. He'd thought about it enough that he had convinced himself maybe it wasn't even Draco he'd smelt after all - like Hermione had said, plenty of people wore Dior Sauvage.
A lifetime of flings and minor infatuations had at one time sounded very appealing to Draco, but having tasted love he knew he'd never go back.
Why hadn't the curse worked on him? That was something to work out later, he supposed, but still it bothered him.
Draco's hands only hesitated for a second as he passed the crumpled sheet of parchment to the other boy, whose face was screwed up with the same confusion Draco himself had felt when he first read it.
"I did write," Malfoy told Harry awkwardly as he slid the book out from under his pillow. "Just didn't send them. You can't read all of them, but I can show you some at least."
"Halloween." Malfoy rolled his eyes; Harry was just pleased to hear him speak, but he shook his head.
"I sleep with all my friends," Malfoy told him airily. "Just because you and your friends are all ugly virgins who can't force yourselves to stoop that low-"
"Mr. Malfoy!" Madam Pince exclaimed in a horrified tone, looking as though he was casting Unforgivables in all directions. "This is outrageous behaviour, I demand that you leave my library at once!! Professor Dumbledore will be hearing all about this!"
Hermione didn't laugh, so he sighed dejectedly.
Harry pulled back his hand and slammed it into the other boy's smug face as hard as he could, taking great joy in the yelp of pain Malfoy let out as his knuckles collided with one of his sharp high cheekbones.
"Good, Potter, it's you." She rolled her eyes. "I thought I'd never say those words."
just now."
By the end of the match Draco could see that the Gryffindor was trying really hard not to completely lose it, and to be honest a small part of him hoped he would. He could do with some entertainment, with the added effect that it would prove to everyone that their precious Harry Potter wasn't perfect. Also it would be kinda hot. Cough. Um. Yeah. I don't fancy him though, Draco assured himself. He's a dick.
Someone had conjured a delicate haze over the area, giving it a soft, film-like quality, and coloured lanterns filled with fireflies cut through the mist to illuminate faces and bodies with shards of jewel colours.
"Had your entertainment for the day, have you?" He snapped bitterly. "I hope you all bloody enjoyed that, yes, go on, have a good gawp at me. It's what I'm here for."
It was all he could do not to lose consciousness right there on the floor.
Harry appeared to notice for himself that something was on Malfoy's mind as soon as he woke up and saw him there.
He paused, thinking. "Maybe I should write him an apology letter."
"Fantastic," said Harry sarcastically. "Really cool. Good chat, Gin. Let's do it again sometime."
Wordlessly, he laid it out on the sheets and Harry joined him in a kneeling position on the floorboards to have a better look.
"This isn't enough for very long, he needs actual Healing," Pansy said, "Who knows what damage he might have done to himself?"
Armfuls of emerald ivy vines had been strung around the space and hundreds of twinkling candles nestled in each loop, casting sparkling light across the scene. Rose petals laid pristine paths through the room to the drinks tables, the dance floor and the sitting areas, and more petals drifted like feathers down from the ceiling to replace the old ones as they were sullied by expensive brogues and heels.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "It could be literally anything, Potter, but let me see. Is it because you're a massive virgin who's scared it's going to
A guarded look came over Malfoy's face. "It's none of your business. I don't want to talk about it. Just- just let me in, okay? Get me out of my fucking mind, please.... please, Potter."
"I'm fine, thank you, Hannah," Trelawney nodded weakly, turning to rub off the chalk marks from the blackboard.
Harry bit his lip. "I want to hear you say it." Quiet, only slightly pleading.
His heart seems to speak the same language mine does, Harry recognised at once. It was some kind of beautiful tiny heaven contained in a boy.
Draco flipped them both over so that he was the one on top as his tongue darted into Harry's mouth since he preferred to be the one in control, and kissed him like he'd wanted to be kissed for so long.
It was dark-haired and weak and wrapped round and round the finger, and as Harry watched, the body flailed wildly. It didn't take a genius to work the metaphor out.
"Oh, for fuck's sake, I'm about to get my head kicked in."
"What the fuck are you doing here?" he asked, attempting to mask his desire with anger as always.
It was growing dark and cold enough on the pitch that everyone else was heading very swiftly for the showers, but there was enough light still for Harry to make out Malfoy's defined features under his shock of wind-tangled blonde hair, and it had to be acknowledged that he looked very, very tempting.
"I didn't fucking touch her!" Malfoy yelped. "How many fucking times am I going to have to tell you this?"
He batted them down at Harry, who didn't think it was at all funny.
Now and again over the following weeks, he allowed himself to consider the other possibility: that maybe Draco would find himself and learn to live too well without Harry, and he'd get a letter someday in years to come, saying "
"It's incredible," Blaise agreed. "Dramatic, but incredible. Amazing what one little interference can do."
"You go ahead, Draco," he said in a casual tone. "It's Potter I need to talk to..."
It started slowly, with a mere distraction in Potions. Potter was being obnoxious as usual and taking all the attention in class, and before Draco knew it, his Potions book was lit up like a bonfire over the cauldron.
"Stop being such a prick, Malfoy," Ron snapped, striding over from the Gryffindor benches. "You said yourself that he hasn't done anything to you. And he's told us he doesn't want to."
"This is a good spot," Malfoy admitted quietly, taking in the elements. "And it's ... it's a good day. I didn't think I could have those any more."
"Neither of us have decent father figures?" Harry suggested.
"Just come here, you brat," Blaise grinned, and when Draco reluctantly obliged, he took a deep sniff of him from his hair down to his shoulders.
Harry felt like a huge weight had been lifted from his body, so excited at this news that he was hovering above himself. "If ecstasy is found in the Mark," he said almost gleefully, pacing quicker with anticipation, "Then that proves there was ecstasy in his bloodstream at the time he was marked."
Harry grinned. "Lying snake," he retorted, but he stood back to let the door open.
The brick wall was cool and solid against Harry's back, and he leant against it gratefully, closing his eyes against the migraine that was threatening to attack at any minute.
His soul had felt restless in his body for some time, without the boy it loved. It was as though it no longer knew where to go. But suddenly there the two of them were on the battlefield. And each of them knew exactly where to go.
He felt almost betrayed by his own body, by the sickening adrenaline that still fired through his veins whenever Malfoy was anywhere near him and made him hate himself to the core.
need to know.
Malfoy reached up firmly but gently, cupped Harry's chin, and then kissed him with soft but deliberate intent.
"Morning," he replied awkwardly. He ran his hands through his hair in agitation. "Look, Potter, there's some stuff I have to do this morning, ok? Before I leave."
As he planned the day, a small smile crept over Harry's lips.
As his fingers made contact with the flask, Draco's sleeve slipped up to reveal the beautiful untainted skin of his left forearm. His parents' eyes locked greedily onto it and the boy allowed himself nothing more than a slight pang of regret at the sight. It wasn't nearly enough to open the gaping chasm of sorrow inside him and let his pain pour out. And not enough to make him feel better, either.
"I'm not stopping you."
"What?"
, Potter. I can see your bollocks turning blue."
"Draco, we'll discuss this later..." Blaise shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
Harry wasn't sure exactly how much better he felt afterwards, but he was realising that he wanted to make amends with Malfoy whatever the cost. Anything was better than being ignored again.
like that."
"Has he made a move on you?"
Draco saw what he was doing and smiled to himself. Harry's cologne had always appealed to Draco too, though he'd spent years telling people how nasty and cheap it was. Third-year Draco probably would've sold his wand for one of Potter's jackets.
"Prefer to gawp," Blaise grinned, but Draco ignored him. The question had clearly been rhetorical.
"What have you done to me, Malfoy?" he wondered aloud.
"Surely the more it upsets your parents, the better?" Harry'd replied, bemused. "And surely my significance on the anti Death Eater front makes me a more respectable witness in court?"
"Of course," Potter grinned. "I think I told you about that yesterday."
He'd left the colour out of the sketches but somehow Draco knew you could still feel it. Harry clearly could, because he went red the second he saw it.
"It's OK," Harry blinked away and eyeful of his own tears. It really wasn't OK, but he said it again. "I'll miss you."
"Didn't you already have two cups, Draco?" Pansy's eyes danced with wicked merriment. "Wouldn't want you getting jittery, now."
Harry had been kept behind after Herbology and was therefore late to the class, flustered and slightly rain-soaked from the run over. Ron and Hermione weren't in that class, and Harry's lateness meant he was forced to take the nearest available seat when he finally arrived at the top of the tower.
It took the Gryffindors a second to work out what he meant, and Malfoy spent that particular second preparing himself for impact. It came promptly.
Those eyes lit up when he spied Harry across the room, and he quickly forced his way over through a crowd of irritated Gryffindors. It didn't take long for Harry to realise that Malfoy was a lot drunker than he was; he reeked of red wine.
"What's up, Potter? Want to believe in all this future nonsense? I'd have thought it would scare you. That business with the dementors on the train in September proved that's not hard."
Harry sighed. "I'm coming. Though I'm not sure what exactly I'll be able to do. He doesn't listen to me, either. He kind of follows his own laws, in case you hadn't noticed."
"This is so fucking ridiculous." He began to rake his hands through his hair in frustration, not stopping till it was completely wild. "You can't keep secrets from me."
Malfoy's cruel words tore Harry calmly apart in public, piece by aching piece, but when no one else was there he put him right back together again as if nothing happened, his tongue licking honey into every wound he'd ever made.
"Probably easier to show you," he mumbled, pushing up his sleeve to reveal the raw skin where the skull-headed serpent lay. Harry gasped, a ragged breath that got audibly snagged in his throat.
McGonagall's eyebrows shot up in displeasure. "You would do well, Mr. Malfoy, to watch your tone!" she reprimanded him sternly. "Now, be on your way. Try not to cause any more serious damage as you leave."
They began slipping out of classes early to hook up whenever Draco gave him what Harry described mentally as "the glance", missing meals and losing sleep over one another yet unable to do anything but cause the other pain when they weren't naked.
Draco probably should've been more focused on where his was going, but it became increasingly difficult to stop staring at the pretty little shock headed seeker behind him as time wore on.
"But you call the shots, Malfoy!" Harry hissed, desperate to scream but not wanting to wake up the school.
There was a little inscription on the first page that he opened, in Malfoy's looping script.
"Let's talk about that later, when we get you to bed," he insisted, keeping his tone kinder than he really felt so as to make Malfoy listen. "We can go to yours if you prefer, but we aren't having sex, I want to make that clear."
And God, Draco was going to have fun with it.
"He's good," Harry had smiled back, and he really meant it. "He's been really great compared to how he was before. He's not been high in two weeks now, so-"
Harry grinned to himself. Maybe tomorrow he'd finally get a decent stylist as Jenna's replacement once she quit. He slugged back the last of his coffee, then made his way up to bed. He knew he wouldn't sleep for a while, but being in his pyjamas and sat under the covers reading would be better than pacing around the kitchen, jittery off caffeine and exhaustion. Besides, knowing Lily was just in the next room sleeping soundly was a real comfort to him.
"Sorry my palm's a bit sweaty," Harry mumbled after a while. Draco laughed.
His father cut him off with a short knowing laugh. "Not too early for a Malfoy," he boasted. "You're too strong for this piss, Draco. Besides, today is more important - you get to prove yourself! Isn't that glorious?"
! You've broken my fucking nose, you moron!"
"You shouldn't. He's going to hurt you."
"No, you're just going into cardiac arrest," Ron rolled his eyes in amusement. "Are you really that scared?"
"What, you can't kiss and draw at the same time?" Harry asked cheekily.
"Shall I tell you what he's done, or would you both prefer to gawp at me for a bit longer?" Draco snarled.
His friends laughed again, riling him up further.
"Thank you, Parkinson," drawled Snape. "At least someone has brains around here. 50 points from Gryffindor for your carelessness, Mr. Potter."
"If it's filthy," he replied with a hard stare, "It's only because you spend so much fucking time in there."
"Yeah," Harry said, surprising himself as much as Draco. "I am. For a while."
"His Mark, Draco's Mark," he said, refusing the offered chair and instead preferring to pace. "Have you tested it?"
All this was only serving as a reminder to him of the real reason Slytherin always lost to Gryffindor. Fucking hell, when did he become so gay for Potter?
Draco shifted uncomfortably. "It was just sex," he said. "Don't say
He and Hermione stood up and pulled Harry hurriedly along behind them, ushering him out of the Hall before he could somehow find something worse to say.
"No, you aren't going to do this."
And his mind - his mind was manic, constantly hungering after the next hit, the next thrill. With Malfoy gone there was nothing so cleansing as the cruel coldness of the Lake to Harry's bones. It was a familiar coldness that satiated his constant need for sensation, for a reminder that his heart was beating.
Harry smirked. "Neither did I. But it's not exactly like I haven't seen it before, is it?"
"Under my bed," he said quietly. "I don't know if I really want to give it to you, though."
In reality, Draco was distant because of an emotion that was previously entirely foreign to him - an inkling of remorse. And it wasn't remorse in the sense that he wished he hadn't done it because he'd been punched, but actual genuine guilt for his actions and the things he'd said. And he hated it.
Draco wished he didn't remember the night before. More than that, he wished it hadn't been the best of his life.
Harry wondered idly what Malfoy was doing. He hoped he was okay, even if he was a dick. He had seemed really freaked after breakfast.
he thought.
A dozen compressions that felt like thousands passed, a dozen breaths too, and then suddenly the frozen boy's body shuddered back to life and he coughed up what looked like buckets of tar-black water.
Harry's lips hurt more after that kiss in the rain than they had after any of the others before. It felt like Draco had really taken something from him this time, something internal.
"Professor, he can't help it!" she protested. "He's under the influence of Veritaserum, he has no control over what he says!"
And with that, he turned on his heel and stormed out of the Common Room to get some air, breathing heavily with frustration as he did so.
Thank God he'd sent the second one instead; Harry didn't think he'd be able to live this first one down now. Sentimental bullshit.
"About as much as I've thought about fucking your dad's corpse."
But Draco Malfoy did not take kindly to being ignored. In fact, he was outraged.
He wasn't sure quite why he said it other than that he was beautifully high and it felt like the right thing to do, but Draco didn't stop him so Harry carried on.
"I'm allowed to watch my greatest Quidditch rival while he trains, aren't I?" Harry grinned innocently, lacing his hands behind his head and flexing. "Just getting some ideas, Malfoy. Don't let me distract you."
The next Quidditch match was to be Slytherin versus Ravenclaw, and while Draco was looking forward to showing off immensely, Harry was plotting on how to sneak into the Slytherin dorms while the other boy was occupied.
"Shut up, shut up!" Malfoy seemed almost panicked. He glanced around; people were milling to and from classes and could easily hear the conversation. The pair of them were certainly drawing at least a couple of glances already, which was mortifying.
It took a while before Harry remembered staring was weird and his breathing returned to normal once again, but it looked like the other boy was having a similar problem. Harry wished he'd stop staring at his legs.
"A colossal sweaty knob?" Ron offered.
He decided eventually that he'd have to tell Potter, though. It wouldn't be as fun to hear about his crush any more anyway, knowing he'd simply been conditioned into it and that it wasn't genuine. What a weird thing to have to tell someone.
"Aren't you always angry?" Harry sighed.
"This
"I'm staying," he managed, taking a hasty deep gulp of the liquid in his glass.
