Harry kept talking and talking. He had stopped listening a while ago. The bright green of his eyes kept glancing down, the lids lowered, the pupils widened… And that was when he felt them; those beautifully soft lips on his own.
He slowly lifted his right hand and rubbed it over his face. He couldn’t focus anymore. He couldn’t think. His thoughts were muddled and confused, weaving into each other, without a start or an end.
“You lost a lot of blood,” the blond’s head jerked up and he looked at Harry whose eyes were focused on the white bedding that covered Draco’s lower body. “The wound got infected since it went untreated for so long. I nearly lost you.” His voice cracked towards the ends, not louder than a whisper.
I huffed, shot a last glare in the mirror’s direction and marched my way down into the kitchen where my dear darling of a boyfriend tried to get an explanation and probably an apology out of a barn owl that was staring at him with confused and slightly annoyed amber eyes.
!” she hissed as she came to a stop right in front of the traitor, finger ramming into his chest. She ignored his shocked expression, grey eyes big and round, as she focussed solely on why she was here. “Do you even know how pathetic you are? Treating someone like that is even below
"Research, huh?" His glance darted to the blond Slytherin who was still standing next to him, smirking. "I wonder whether that research had anything to do with two letters that happened to be delivered to us yesterday evening."
And to top it off, Draco had not yet deemed Harry a visit. He had not seen the blonde wizard for a whole day and as he walked through the dark corridors of Hogwarts, making his curfew round as a Prefect, he couldn’t stop wondering what this was about.
Her heart started beating faster. She wasn’t sure whether it was anxiety and fear for Harry or anger. She took a deep breath, told herself to remain calm, and turned her focus back on the two boys huddled in the corner.
This insane man wasn’t his father. He was nothing but a torturer, a murderer, who had clearly lost his mind along the way. The Dark Lord had cost him his soul, if he knew it or not, and if Draco allowed this to go on, allowed this to be him in a few years, he would never be able to live with himself. That man standing in front of him wasn’t human anymore. Hasn’t been for many, many years.
He tried not to think about what was happening to Draco at this moment as he carefully pressed his ear against doors and listened to the slightest noise that might tell him what was behind each door. He forced himself to keep from thinking that he was too late, that he had waited too long to come and find him.
“Draco, dear,” he blinked rapidly as he rather felt than heard his mother take a seat on the settee next to him. She took his hand in hers and waited until he looked her in the eye. Her smile was sad. Her bright blue eyes gazed into his, her free hand came up and cupped his cheek lovingly. Draco swallowed. She had never done this in front of his father. Never.
Harry didn’t understand what was going on. People kept snickering when he walked past, pointing at him and whispering behind their hands so he wouldn’t hear what they were talking about. He was used to being in the centre of attention, but this was annoyingly much, even for his standards.
“Breathe, love,” Draco said amused as Harry took a huge gulp of air and stared at him as if he was suddenly sporting a set of wings on his back and a horn on his forehead.
The whispered question crept out of Lucius’ corner, who came out of his shocked state and ripped his mask off his face. His expression was murderous. “What did you just say?”
"I'm sorry to be late, love, but I can't stay for long. I need to quickly change and set off again. I'm needed at the shop." Draco didn't even take his shoes off as he already moved past Harry, pressing a fleeting kiss onto his cheek, before he vanished into the bedroom.
– never mess with a Malfoy before he’s fully awake – I decided to take mercy on him and turned towards the owl. It had an official looking letter clutched between its talons, the deep blue symbol unmistakably from my least favourite institution of Great Britain – the Ministry of Magic.
The hairless man turned his blood-red eyes towards the kneeling men in front of him; both Malfoy males couldn’t look more different. One dressed in a black cloak, the hood hiding his silver-blond hair, the other pushing a stubborn strand out of his eye; one being hunched in on himself, grovelling at the feet of his master, the other glaring at said man, wishing the most terrible things on him.
On any other day, his heart would beat calmly in his chest, already used to the secrets and thrill that came with his activities.
This one was for the Harry Potter's World forum on FFN. (Come and join us! It's a lot of fun and there are no word count restrictions or deadlines! Shamesless forum promotion hahaha) The stories submitted for that forum are always longer than the QLFC ones, because there we're not allowed to submit more than 3k words, which isn't good for the story flow.
The blond jumped slightly as the surprisingly strict voice hit his eardrums. He turned his head and stared at the anything but amused-looking saviour of the wizarding world, gobsmacked.
“Well, what am I supposed to do then, according to your opinion?” I asked timidly, as to not aggravate her any further.
, whispered a seductive voice in his ear, luring his darkest dreams out of the deepest corner of his heart.
Draco’s heartbeat was so fast that he feared it would jump right out of his rib cage any second now. He swallowed as he looked into those beautiful eyes that led him through every one of his dreams. “No, it wasn’t,” he whispered as if in trance. His eyes wandered down to Harry’s lips. They looked so soft and sweet…
He had never witnessed this kind of punishment before. Usually, those who refused to join his ranks were killed almost immediately. No-one survived more than ten minutes after the refusal. What was so different about him that they let him live?
A sigh could be heard through the door and a soft thud as the person leaned against the wall across from them. He didn’t know who they were but according to Ginny’s excited, whispered descriptions she was very happy with what she was witnessing...
for my next article. People get bored with all this speculations and my editor is breathing down my neck, so I need your help to…"
His eyes were focused on Harry’s face, which looked so different from the last time he had been able to touch and kiss him.
her to believe that was the case, but there was still that small voice in the back of her head that kept telling her different. There was still suspicion and uncertainty that she wanted to get to the bottom of. She was worried, but if Hermione said that Malfoy had changed, if
Light steps echoed through the hallway leading to his room and made him freeze. What seemed like an eternity later, his breath hitched as knuckles knocked against his door, whose handle was immediately being pushed down. In a panicked second, wild storm grey eyes searched for a way he could prevent what was now about to happen. His breathing was shallow and too quickly, his heart beat so strongly as if it wanted to escape the prison of his ribcage. A fleeting moment, he seriously thought about wrenching the window open and jumping out of his third storey room because death would surely be preferred over the alternative.
“Yes, yes, yes, I have heard you alright, young lady, calm down. I’m not as fast as I used to be, you know? Not getting any younger here, I’m afraid.”
Harry looked from one Order member to the other. They have been awfully quiet throughout this discussion. Looking into their faces though showed him that they were all agreeing with Hermione. Every single one of them. Betrayal shot through his veins, leaving him with an empty feeling. These people needed him, that he knew, but they needed him for the wrong reasons. He didn’t mind helping, he never did, but being told what to do never sat well with him and they should know that. They might all still be the old man’s pawns in this big game he called the Greater Good but he wouldn’t be one anymore. He had done what he had been called to do. Either they were happy with what he had accomplished or they could piss off and look for another idiot to sacrifice their life for them, just so they could lay back and enjoy the praise they got for ensuring peace.
All eyes turned to him as wands were pulled out of robes and gripped tightly. This wasn’t a voluntary action. They would make him torture the poor girl if he refused, but he had reached a point at which he simply didn’t care anymore. Anything was better than being one of his brainless followers.
His parents' marriage was the product of a betrothal between two high class pureblood families that had needed this connection in order to keep their influence on the wizarding world up and going. He was pretty sure that his parents loved each other, but he had never seen them act loving or caring towards each other. The only reason why he knew that his mother was able to love was her treatment of him. How she spoke with him, how she hugged him... His father had always been this untouchable persona, not even being himself whilst talking with his own son. Or maybe he couldn't act any different? He grew up with elders, never allowed to get in touch with people his age. Maybe his father didn't know how to properly interact with someone younger than him - his son at that?
Harry smiled, relieved, and hurried through the room. He could hear the front door close shut as he reached the top of the staircase. Screeches that he was by now used to filled the halls as he raced down the stairs and nearly collided with one of the hooded figures, who caught him in time to prevent a painful collision.
"Mother told me about a potion once. It will work. I know it will. We just need to make sure you'll be the first person he sees."
Just as he hushed Draco, who again wanted him to get out as quickly as possible and not to worry about him, he heard hurried footsteps outside the room. Voices that he hadn't noticed before quickly came nearer.
He spotted a chair next to a door that most likely led into the bathroom, and carried it to Harry’s bedside. He didn’t want to leave him alone just now, mostly for his own sake. He had spent the last year without any information on where he was or how he was. He hadn’t wanted to know where he was, as if he knew, it would have been a risk for both of their safeties.
The raven-haired wizard felt a shudder run down his spine as he moved towards the grand staircase leading to the upper floor, careful to not let the cloak ride up over his shoes. The portraits might be silent, but they still had eyes and – no doubt – strong voices.
“How are you, son?” The elder Malfoy asked as he walked into the room and positioned himself next to his slightly frowning wife.
Draco stared at the very angry-looking Harry Potter in front of him. He was fuming. His handsome face was red, his beautiful eyes flashing and his adorable hair pointing in every direction. His fit body was still glistening with drops of water that ran out of his hair and caressed every perfect curve of the porcelain skin. Draco swallowed as he felt his blood flow in a direction he did not want it in at the moment. “Will you let me explain?” His voice was a mere whisper. He didn’t trust himself to speak normally, as he feared his voice might crack with the pressure that was lying on his shoulders right now. He wanted Harry to see! He needed Harry to see and he couldn’t fail!
What he saw inside the classroom made his blood run cold. He couldn’t breathe as his eyes zoomed in on his boyfriend – the exact same one that made a point in avoiding him today – tightly wrapped around Hermione’s boyfriend. Harry blinked. His mouth had gone completely dry. No, this couldn’t be true!
Being out in the open for everyone to stare at and insult did not feel right while being alone. He wanted, no,
“Well, he probably thought you liked him,” Nott shrugged nonchalantly as if he didn’t care. Ginny ground her teeth. She could feel her jaw muscles cramp. It was getting increasingly difficult to stay calm and hidden. All she wanted to do was jump out of her hiding place and punch that greasy slimeball straight in the face! How
Just as he was about to turn the corner into the East Wing of Hogwarts, he heard muffled voices from behind and unused classroom’s door. Expecting a couple making out or doing worse thing, Harry stood straight, cleared his throat and knocked against the wooden door. No answer. The voices could still be heard; it was as if they hadn’t heard him. Somewhat annoyed, Harry knocked again - still no acknowledgment of his presence. Groaning softly, he steeled himself for what he would soon witness, turned the doorknob and pushed the door open.
He looked up and saw Draco stare at his arms with a weird expression on his face. Harry frowned. “Hey, you alright?” He asked softly, successfully pulling Draco out of his reveries.
Draco smiled softly as he turned towards the stairs at the other side of the cozy room. Hermione had said they led to the dorm rooms. Summoning more courage than he felt at that moment, Draco started towards the left one, and climbed up the crooked staircase. He moved past the first and second year dorms before he noticed that each storey harboured one year of students.
you seemed to be. Why would you suddenly decide that it’d be a great idea to catch up and get over our past, to start anew? To maybe be friends? I actually believed you, you know? I actually told my best friend that we were past that phase when we used to try everything in our power to lure each other into traps! Seems like I was wrong. Again.” Harry turned around and started to pick up his clothes that were lying on the bed. “I actually thought you wanted to make a truce.”
"It was an accident, okay? I didn't do it on purpose!" Draco exclaimed, his face flushed. "Do you honestly believe that I would destroy the watch on purpose?"
Blaise tense posture relaxed somewhat as he heard Madam Pince’s stern voice chastise Draco and hopefully manage to stop whatever he was planning to –
He was saved from having to answer by the object of Ron's worries marching back into the living room, happily munching on some crisps. "That pie looks and smells incredible, Harry."
Slowly he turned the knob and opened the door. It had been oiled recently, as it wasn’t creaking. Silently, he thanked the elves responsible for that bit of foresight.
Harry Potter scowled at the large banner hanging above the festively decorated ball room in a rarely used part of the Ministry of Magic. People had told him that this part used to be where balls and festivities were being held, long before he was even born. Now the words ‘Third Anniversary of Harry Potter’s Triumph’ labelled the room Harry had no desire whatsoever to enter.
Slowly, the young Malfoy tried to get to his knees before his arms started trembling violently and gave way.
Astoria gulped, looked up to her older sister and slowly shook her head, her dark hair swinging from side to side. “No, he didn’t have a say in this. It was –“
“I will not allow my son to be in a relationship with a man!” He hollered as he took as step forward, his finger pointing accusingly at Draco. “A
It was a cold autumn day. Leaves were turning orange, falling off the trees in the Forbidden Forest to cover the ground in gold, and the atmosphere within the castle was changing along with the weather. The younger years had started to get excited, anticipating Hallow’s Eve and its famous feast. Hagrid had started dragging pumpkins over the grounds, collecting leaves and twigs along the way.
“Five foot? That’s insane!” Ginny heard Lavender Brown complain in the row behind her as she packed her books back in her satchel. “Flitwick already wants a three-and-a-half-foot essay on the Vanishing Charm by Tuesday, and Professor Sprout requested another three-and-a-half-foot essay by Monday. How am I going to get all of that work done in time? There’s no way!”
Lightning illuminated the street outside. Three people stood in the middle of the road, all hidden under oversized hoods and dark cloaks. Thunder rolled overhead as they quickly made their way over to the front door.
Imagination and laughter had quickly turned into reality and nightmares. The screams from the Dark Lord’s victims still echoed in his head as he tried to fall asleep, knowing fully well that just a few floors below him, his father’s companions all had met up to get ready for the next summoning.
“Yeah, I’ve assumed as much,” Draco sighed and rubbed over his face with his free hand. “It doesn’t matter that I am a free man according to the Ministry. That one decision has them bound to that way of thinking.”
After a short but comfortable silence, Draco gently put his hand under Harry’s chin and pulled his head up so that he was looking at him. “But that’s not why you’re so upset, is it?”
“She’s fine!” Harry hurried to say and pushed a wound-up Draco Malfoy back into his pillows. “She’s completely fine now. She was hit with a cutting curse. Nothing Madam Pomfrey couldn’t fit. She’s on bed rest for the next day, but after that she’ll be back to her usual cheery self, I promise.”
"I'll levitate you out. Once you've reached the ground, I'll follow you. We'll get you out of here safely. I promise."
Before Draco could do anything more than let out an embarrassing squeak, his way too stubborn boyfriend stood up and jumped on one leg, making himself look like the buffoon Draco already knew he was.
“I’ve heard what you said,” Harry heard himself snap, ignoring the sharp intakes of air of a few people in the room he slowly started to hate that followed almost immediately after. “I’m not deaf.”
or whatever the hell they were calling him nowadays. They had even tried to drug or hex him in order to get the most honest interview in the history of love life interviews, but thankfully Hermione had been there to keep him from any harm.
“Yeah,” he muttered awkwardly, and forced himself not to flinch as she threw her arms around his tall figure.
“He’s in his dorm, then?” Dejectedly, Draco looked up the staircase. He wouldn’t be able to see him then. He would have to wait yet another day to see and hopefully talk to him. The hole inside him grew as the newly acquired knowledge settled in.
A sharp pain shot through his chest. No, that couldn't be… Draco had said that he meant something to him… That
“No, you don’t, Hermione.” He took a deep breath, lowered his head and pressed the bridge of his nose between his thumb and pointer finger. He was developing a headache. “Draco is my boyfriend,” he knew without looking that both Hermione and Ron flinched, “and I will not betray his trust just because someone told me to.”
“And what about Snape?” Harry exclaimed. An angry blush rose on his cheeks. “He has changed sides. Why can’t Draco do the same?”
My eyes narrowed as I tried to stare the mirror to death. Everyone knew that charms only did so much to your hair.
a Death Eater,” Harry stressed and put a finger under Draco’s chin to force him to look him in the eye, causing the blond wizard to shiver pleasantly. “Past tense. And it wasn’t like it was your decision, right?”
"I promise I'll get it, Harry. Relax. See you in a bit." And with that, he hung up and the kitchen went silent again.
“Could you please tell me what the heck is going on between you and Draco?” He hissed in a low, dangerous voice. His bright green eyes flashed with barely contained fury as he stared down at the fidgeting wizard at his feet.
He squeezed his eyes shut shortly before ruffling his hair and marching to the last door on his right. He twisted the handle, pushed against the wood and froze. There, just a few metres in front of him on the floor lay Draco Malfoy. His blond hair unkempt and loosely hanging around his pale face, one arm outstretched, the other cradled against his chest. His eyes were closed, his lips slightly apart. His alabaster cheek rested in what looked like a drying patch of blood.
Hermione jaw dropped as she stared at her beet-red boyfriend who was fidgeting in front of her. They were sitting in a secluded area near the Black Lake, where other students wouldn’t directly see them – including one certain blonde wizard.
But as the hands on the clock hit 6 pm and crept on further towards 7 pm, Harry's excitement slowly ebbed away. Absent-mindedly, he fumbled with the hem of his shirt, his eyes never leaving the clock or the door for longer than a few seconds at a time.
It had been about three hours since the Dark Lord had fallen, and Draco Malfoy didn’t know what would come next. All of his life, he had been prepared to join a war in the making, to fight for a side he hated with all that he had. Yet, being a good son and afraid of what would happen to his family, he had done as he had been told.
Harry took a deep breath and turned towards his best friend. “Oh yeah? And what makes you think that?”
at that! You will end this immediately, Draco, do you hear me? You will stop thinking with a certain part of your anatomy and start thinking like a Malfoy! With your brain! You will end it this very instance or I will-“
"I think it's broken," Harry ground out through clenched teeth as he tried to out weight on it carefully. Pain shot through his whole side, pulling a pained gasp out of him.
(dialogue) "You're crazy!" // "Were you ever under the impression that I was normal?", (word) mist, (word) scarf
An amused chuckle greeted him as the man raised his hand and pushed his hood out of his face. His greying hair was slightly rumpled, but his smile was warm, if a bit tense.
A sob escaped him as he threw his clothes onto his bed, just as his knees gave way underneath him. He sank to the ground and buried his face in his hands.
Harry jumped into action. Not thinking twice, he waved his wand and silently charmed his boyfriend into the air. He threw his invisibility cloak over his body and pushed him out of the ruined window. Fists banged against the door, the light of curses shining through the slid between its wood and the floor.
He glared at the girl who had been the only person dear to him who had not once turned her back on him – until now. All of those moments when she had defended him from friends or enemies were nothing against what she was asking of him now.
He'd put everything into this relationship, had given Draco everything that he'd had, and now he felt as if he didn't have anything left to give. He felt empty, helpless, desperate. He felt
His plush and light pink lips stretched into a loving smile, his emerald orbs glistened with unshed tears and just as a soft thumb stroked his cheek did he realize that he was crying as well. He had not realized just how much he had needed these words.
This is a break-up story in which Harry loses his trust in Draco. If you want to read fluff, better stay away from this chapter :D
Harry looked down sadly, nodding. He knew that but it didn’t make things easier. His fingers started to play with the bottom he had abandoned a few minutes earlier.
Of course, he'd forgotten the flour. When he came back the next morning, long after Hermione and Ron were gone, he didn't bother mentioning it.
Harry Potter had been his official enemy from that point onward, someone far more important than just a little school rivalry that centered around who caught the Snitch faster. Harry Potter had jumped up and straight into the bull’s eye, being turned into a target for thousands of
“Not helping, Blaise,” Draco hissed through clenched teeth, only succeeding in making his friend snicker merrily. He found this whole disaster absolutely hilarious since he had been freed of Draco’s obsessiveness. That though, he had to admit, had scared the shit out of him.
Grimacing, he inhaled deeply and set out into the Great Hall, maneuvering around the injured until he reached the huddle of Weasleys. “Hermione?” he asked quietly and tapped her shoulder lightly.
“I’ve heard from your case, Malfoy,” her voice ripped me out of my calming breathing technique and caused me to swallow way too much air at once.
Draco had to swallow the bile that was slowly accumulating in this mouth. He was too paralysed to really do anything than to stare, breathe and not faint right there on the spot. His heart was beating ten times its usual rate, his breaths were shallow and painful. Voldemort smirked, and Draco knew that he knew.
, they would’ve been killed almost instantly. No, he hadn’t blamed his parents, still didn’t. The real reason behind this terror and pain was the remains of a man at the very top, someone who declared a boy of sixteen-years-old his mortal enemy.
Draco’s lips twitched slightly as a smile tried to creep onto his face. Without thinking, his brain gave his left arm the command to rise off the cool blanket, lift over the unconscious wizard next to him and run his fingers through his messy hair, but a sharp jab of intense pain made him gasp in shock and immediately regret his decision to move. He winced as his lover twitched and slowly turned his head to look at the sheepishly smiling pureblood.
doing here?" His dark eyebrows drew together as he watched Draco fidgeting and Parkinson nearly bouncing up and down with… His eyes zoned in on the camera.
Harry followed him, confused. "But we've had this dinner planned for over a week now." He sounded slightly whiny as he couldn't help but feel slightly angry at the sight of his boyfriend rummaging through his wardrobe. "You promised you'd be here for it. You know how much this means to me."
"Can you walk?" Worried blue eyes shot a glance to his leg that was scraping over the floor, useless.
He had grown paranoid, fearing, or maybe hoping, that someone would notice, that someone would see his peculiar behaviour and care enough to get him to stop – and one person had.
Why, you ask? Well, what else could he have done, really? His whole family had the reputation of being dark, and he had been pegged as a future Death Eater from the day he was born. His parents, although not totally convinced of and passionate about the Dark Lord, had followed him and had thus taken his chance of a normal life. He had been put together with other Death Eater’s children to play, he had sat through so many parties and afternoon tea meetings with distant relatives, all bearing the Dark Mark.
"I don't care!" His green eyes glistened dangerously as he grabbed his shoulders and made it impossible for him to move away. "You hear me? I don't care! All I care about is you and if you go through with this, it will destroy you and I will not sit by and watch as you die on the inside."
“He didn’t.” Harry stood straight, shoulders squared. “He didn’t. I don’t even know why Hermione thought to bring it up.”
Draco shook his head. “Even if someone did intercept it, they wouldn’t be able to read it. I spell it so it can only be read by Harry.”
“No, I believe that he’s been working with everyone equally.” Draco narrowed his gaze. “You don’t think this clerk had anything to do with it?”
“But I want you to remember that this goes both ways.” He tucked a lock of hair behind Harry’s ear. “You don’t have to hide your scary boxes from me.”
“I’m not sure, but I’m blaming you for this recklessness.” Draco growled. “Perhaps you should slow down,
Draco walked toward Harry, a predatory glint in his eyes. “Perhaps a thank you for letting the entire Wizarding World think you’re my bride.” He knelt in between the brunette’s legs. “I’m sure it’s all people are talking about.”
“I don’t know… I think he may have coerced Harry into some kind of Dominant/Submissive relationship.”
Harry shrugged. “Why not? Could be fun.” He rose from the table and disappeared into the smaller bedroom. “What do I wear?”
“I never disliked you.” Draco explained. “I think it stemmed from place of jealousy. You were famous before you had even learned to talk. My father would describe the ‘
“Good.” Narcissa took a deep breath. “You look extremely well-polished, Mister Potter. Did you dress yourself or did my son help you?”
“Well that’s lovely. I was expecting him to give you some time off but I doubted you’d be paid for it.” Harry scooted closer to Draco. “You don’t seem happy about it.”
Draco visibly bristled. Harry sighed, sitting up straighter in his chair. “Lord Malfoy, if I may interject.”
“I know… I just… wish that I could remember them the way everyone else does.” Harry replied, hands curling around Draco’s.
“Oh, well then, I must absolutely make it for my charming husband.” He slipped his arms around Draco’s waist. “I’ll stop at the grocers on my way back from the Foundation office.”
Ron cleared his throat. “We think it would be best for you to stay out of the Ministry for the time being.”
Draco pulled the spoon that had brought them to the Manor gardens earlier in the evening. Harry wrapped his hand loosely around the spoon, leaning into Draco. The blonde whispered the password and the pair was whisked away from the garden party.
“Kearns, Troughton, Scannell, Molyneux, Woulfe and Furey.” Ron replied. “One for each of you, they’ll rotate eight hour shifts. We’ll let you know if they are pulled out of the rotation.”
“Hey, hey, hey…” Harry leaned in, running his hands up and down Draco’s arms. “I’m right here. I’m right here in front of you. I’m here in our flat. I used your shampoo. I’m wearing your clothes, you’d hate that. I’m here. I’m very much alive.”
“He’s only here in the mornings on Tuesdays and Thursdays if you would like to continue to avoid him.”
“About Praetor? No, he hasn’t.” Draco replied. “I’m only aware that they dated for a significant length of time before Harry and I got together.”
A deep blush spread across Harry's face. "That was a tad inappropriate for normal conversation, Drake."
They watched as he staggered down the hallway to his room. “I haven’t seen Draco that distraught in years.”
He pulled his shirt back down and sighed. “Oh, don’t worry, it’s nothing… We were just a bit overenthusiastic last night.”
“Impressive and incredibly unexpected.” Narcissa snapped at the two of them. “Come on you two, he will not be kept waiting.”
“You are more than welcome Mister Potter.” Poppy smiled cheerily. “I’ll be at my desk if you need anything.”
of Magical Law Enforcement worked through their investigation, but he couldn’t help wishing he could just get back to work. Bury himself in paperwork and come home to Harry. The dark-haired wizard set a plate of toast and bacon, then hopped up on the island.
“Six o’clock, right on the nose.” She intoned. “Sit, I’d like to get started.” Harry plopped into a seat across from Narcissa while Draco sat at the head of the table. “Franco, you may begin.”
Draco sighed. “Unfortunately. One of the pitfalls to being promoted to the Deputy Head Solicitor is that I must be present during the Ministry Equinox Gala.”
.” Harry stood, rounding on Draco. “We’ve been in a secret relationship for the last few years. Off and on, to explain your philandering—”
“Yes, I’m positive. Have a good evening, Mister Malfoy.” Cristler turned on his heel, waving him out. “Mister Potter, feel free to have the morning with him. He can come in late tomorrow.”
“We shouldn’t do this here.” Draco pulled the two of them into a sitting position, pressing kisses along Harry’s collarbone.
“I thought it’d be better to let you sleep in.” He rinsed the shampoo from his hair. “Ron fire-called this morning. He said he’d be round at eleven to take your statement. Cristler sent an owl as well, it’s on the island in the kitchen.”
Harry responded by kissing Draco deeply, pulling at his green button-down shirt. Draco pushed Harry down onto the bed and began exploring his body with his mouth. Harry was gloriously sensitive. Every little kiss, nip, and lick seemed to set the smaller man a flame with desire. By the time Draco had pulled off the ridiculously frilly undergarments, Harry was panting. Draco pressed his lips to the head of Harry's straining erection, which caused the Gryffindor to gasped loudly.
“Ah…” Draco nodded solemnly. “I suppose someone must and you have quite the lengthy experience dealing with demanding wizards.”
“You thought it was information I needed to know.” Draco said quickly. Cristler was motioning for him. “Thank you. I have to go.”
Poppy opened the door to the archives. “All the stacks are numbered by year, odd numbered months on the left and even on the right. Newest in the front, oldest in the back. I’m assuming you have a time-frame to work with.”
“Yes, she did. You thought I—you were bordering on hysteria. She thought it was best to calm you down.”
Kearns nodded. “Definitely. You might look like a carbon copy of your father at first glance, but you are mot certainly your mother’s son.” He crossed his arms. “I bet when he’s angry with you, he tilts his head to the side, glares, and presses his lips into a thin line.”
“Yes, I am well aware of how charming I am.” Draco replied, backing Harry up to the bed. “As much as I would like to continue this, I do have to go into the office.”
He walked quickly back to the elevator, thanking Poppy for a third time on his way out. Harry yanked Draco down an empty corridor and then slumped against the wall.
Harry walked briskly towards the desk. He ran his hands through his hair and adjusted his recently transfigured suit coat when he reached the desk. The woman sitting behind the desk currently had her face buried into a copy of the latest
Draco leaned against the island, cup of tea in hand, as he watched Harry flit about the kitchen cooking breakfast. The letter from Devon Cristler open, the strong slant of his hand had gently suggested that he enjoy the next four weeks of paid holiday time while they relocated his office. He sighed, re-reading the letter. He knew Cristler was right to keep him away from the department while the Department
“You are a Malfoy.” Draco’s grandfather said sharply. “We cannot afford to want, especially after your father’s indiscretions. The Greengrasses are a good family. A well-connected family. They will be outraged when I have to tell them that my grandson is no longer available.”
“Like what, Hermione?” Sirius huffed. “They accidentally killed a Muggle and married each other to keep the secret?”
“Even after last night, as you slept in my arms, I thought I’d wake up and you wouldn’t be there.” Draco wound his arms around Harry’s middle. “Or that I’d wake up with a bloodied version of your body in my arms.”
“His throat was slashed. Deeply. You could see that he had fully severed the trachea. He was wearing a button-down, white. It was open and you could see words carved into his chest.” Draco swallowed thickly. “Erm—the words ‘
Lysander smirked. “My Father has never been very approving of anything.” He turned his attention back to Harry. “I hear you even spoke back to him. That’s very brave.”
Harry rolled away from the offending light coming in through the window. He hated how much brighter the sun seemed in the winter. His body deliciously sore from his activities the night before, he cracked any eye open to find Draco staring back at him.
“Good.” Hermione smiled. “Now go home and shower, you smell like a bar and Valentine’s Day threw up on you.”
“He has the general Malfoy features, yes.” Lysander sipped his drink, eyes straying over to where Draco stood with Sirius and Remus. “You ever notice how much he and Sirius look alike?”
“I won’t tell Molly.” Hermione replied. “Or Sirius and Remus. I know this is a difficult time of year for you, just promise me that you’ll keep yourself out of trouble.”
"It's completely unnecessary." Draco replied, eyes returning to work. "I'll have this finished in no time."
Harry rolled his eyes. “Someone is obviously very upset with the fact that we are married to each other.”
Harry crossed his arms over his chest. “Perhaps if you didn’t work so much, you could see more of my wardrobe than my sweats and pajamas.”
Draco hummed. “It’s a good suit.” He extended his hand to Harry. “Remember, we’ve been together for years. You’ve got to show complete and utter adoration for me and this relationship.”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’ve been forbidden from the office for the next three days. Cristler was very direct about his instructions.”
“I suppose that could work…” Harry slumped in his seat. “What about this? How long do we let this go?”
Harry grabbed the spoon and felt the familiar tug behind his navel. After the feeling of being squeezed to a tube, they landed in the Malfoy Manor gardens. Despite the normally chilly weather, the garden was in full bloom and warm, decorated with fairy lights and high-topped tables with lacy tablecloths. Trays floated around carrying flutes of champagne and hor d'oeuvres. Narcissa moved toward them, carrying two wreaths in her hand.
Draco watched Harry’s lithe form saunter down the hallway to his bedroom. It took large part of his self-control not to follow him down the hallway and take the dark-haired wizard in the shower. Despite being under the influence of a Lust Potion the two times they had been intimate, Draco had to admit that Harry Potter was his type. Most of the lovers he had taken in the past were built with the same small frame, dark hair and jewel-bright eyes. He shook his head, hoping the inappropriate thoughts tucked themselves back into his subconscious. He was not yet willing to come to terms with the fact that he may or may not have had a crush on Potter for years. Stalking across the living room to his den, he plopped down behind his desk and hit the speed dial on his desk phone.
They hadn’t had any time to really look at each other, let alone talk, so he couldn’t really count that moment as ‘meeting him.’ No, the last, real time he had seen his boyfriend had been a few weeks ago in his own house. He had never called it home, as
, friends for having someone they could count on, someone who accepted them with all of their mistakes which Weasley was still full of. He had hurt back then and unlike then he hadn’t had his boyfriend’s loving words, gently touches and sweet kisses. He had had no one to heal his wounds back in the day.
"We have to get you out of here," Harry muttered as he wrapped the expensive material around the blond's bloody arm. "Is there a quick way out of here that doesn't include the main entrance hall?"
sniffed and turned her glare back towards me. I pushed all of my strength, conviction and energy into the corners of my mouth, only to stop right away as I saw Harry wince.
Malfoy blinked and Harry could see a subtle tint of pink colouring his pale cheeks. "Let's take this somewhere more comfortable, shall we?" Without any further ado, he turned around and hurried through the hallway towards a slightly ajar door, his head held high and his muscles tense. Harry swallowed down the tingling feeling that threatened to wander into regions he honestly didn't want to think about right now – or didn't want to do his thinking for him, as that would be more fitting.
Harry turned towards one of the two windows of the living room in hopes of seeing an owl, but of course, he didn't.
“Do you think she would help me? I mean, we still don’t really get along that well,” I mumbled embarrassed. That was an understatement. She hated me. She did her best to overcome our not so peachy looking history – another understatement – and see me for who I really was, but it was taking her so much effort that I slowly started to believe it was going to take a while before she could handle to be in a room with me and not trying to do wandless and deathly magic.
"But I want to greet your guest before leaving. It would be quite impolite otherwise, don't you think?"
(Weather) Ice Rain, (Non-canon pairing) Harry x Draco, (Quidditch terms) Quaffle, Nimbus 2000, Nimbus 2001, Firebolt, Cleansweep 5, (Quidditch Players) Madam Hooch, Oliver Wood, Cho Chang
had taken a hold of the young wizard, and Lord Voldemort had to admit – it amused him immensely. Ah, youth. The youth still thought they were in control of their lives and would one day change the world for the better. They didn’t want to accept the fact that the world’s future was bigger than their person, that sacrifices would have to be made, even if that meant giving up their own lives for their master.
There in the middle of his bedroom stood no other than Draco Malfoy himself, wearing what looked like a button-down shirt, inside out, a pair of chinos and no shoes or socks. His hair was dishevelled and his cheeks were slightly pink. He looked nervous as his eyes travelled over Harry’s naked chest, down over the towel around his waist, to his bare feet. Harry blushed almost immediately; his heart started beating twice its normal speed. His hand jerked towards the towel, securing it in place.
“Draco,” he exclaimed, and was immediately shushed by the blond who kept shooting fearful looks towards the door of the medical ward that he was currently resting in. “You’re awake,” his voice now barely louder than a whisper.
Ginny’s heart stuttered before picking up speed. What? That couldn’t… He couldn’t… No, she was sure that…
"Malfoy! Come on in." Potter was dressed in a similar fashion and he had to admit he quite liked how his opposite looked. His shirt wasn't that good of a quality, but it didn't look cheap either. His trousers were beige instead of blue and he wore his all-time favourite sneakers. Draco knew that because those were the shoes Potter was wearing quite often when they would meet in the Ministry. "So, are we ready to go?" Potter grabbed his leather jacket and looked at him expectantly.
“I want to see a five-foot essay on my desk next Monday,” Professor McGonagall said, her voice raised to be heard over the loud groans of the seventh years. “And no moaning! This is your N.E.W.T. year, so buckle up and research. Class dismissed.”
His mother waved her hand in a authoritative manner, and he forced himself off the window still and onto his feet. The way the witch held herself, Draco figured that she had made sure to have her wand somewhere from where she could easily and quickly grab it. He didn't fancy being disarmed by his mother and led to the meeting room at wand point, so he decided to not give her a reason to literally force him into his imminent future.
"Love, you know that I can't change it now. The choice has been made and you should do everything to fulfil what's asked of you."
“The fact that this has all started the second he set eyes on Blaise first thing yesterday morning.”
"And can you bring some more flour as well?" Harry asked as he kneaded the dough for the pastry. "Hermione said she has some left-over filling that she needs to get rid of before it spoils."
“You need to what? Calm down, Draco! We’ve got what we wanted. You won the bet and I got my front page story. Everything’s brilliant and I’ll be the editor’s favourite for bringing him the story of his lifetime! I can see it printed already. The words above the picture of the half-naked darling of the wizarding world, ‘Harry Poof, it’s all a farce!’” Her laugh was high and way too loud and Draco pushed past her and dragged the blanket with him out of the bedroom. “What are you doing?”
“Oh, yeah? Watch me!” Angrily, he ripped his cloak off of the hook and stormed further upstairs to retrieve his Invisibility Cloak. He didn’t know what he would have to face, but he had grown accustomed to having his trusty heirloom with him. It gave him courage and strength, both of which he dearly needed right now.
Harry sniffed loudly, wiped away his tears, and sat up straight as he heard Draco close the front door.
"I bet that you won't accomplish getting Harry Potter into your bed and my story onto front page!" Pansy Parkinson smirked at Draco Malfoy, who had his raised cup of tea near his mouth.
, his inner nasty voice replied. He scowled. He couldn't control with whom he'd fall in love, now could he? His parents had organised a betrothal between himself and some other rich pureblood he had yet to meet. He didn't want to meet that person. He didn't want to marry someone he didn't love, hell, didn't even know!
What if this wonderful, brave man behind this door didn’t want him anymore? The last time he had seen him had been when he had jumped up from the ground, proving everyone that Harry Potter didn’t just
“Come on and get ready,” he said, totally not seeing the beet red and extremely unmanly colour my cheeks had adopted, or just choosing wisely to ignore it, so I could at least keep some of my manliness and self-respect for later destruction. “Breakfast is ready and…”
On any other day, he would watch the sky for any signs of a certain white owl carrying a much waited for piece of parchment, fully knowing that what he was doing was unwelcome, forbidden, dangerous.
Harry sighed and leaned back against Draco’s shoulder, putting his arms around said waist and feeling the blond’s arm pull him towards him even more.
Harry raised his head slowly and zoned his eyes in on mine. His brilliant green gaze caused tingles to shoot through my body so abruptly that I winced.
I tried to smile back, only remembering too late that it probably looked like I wanted to kill her for real. I winced as her smiled vanished and Harry’s hand squeezed my knee.
"Of course not." Draco's voice sounded hollow, lifeless, as he once again glanced at the Muggle on the floor. She had stopped sobbing, but tears still kept streaming down her dirty face.
Harry tried to hide his smirk as Ron scratched his lower back. “I think George put some Tickling Solution into my robes,” he grumbled as he reached up to scratch his shoulder. “Damn it! Harry, could you help a man out?”
“Well, do you have a better one?” Hermione snapped, ignoring Harry’s nervous fidgeting. “We have to get him out of there now. Preferably before it’s too late!”
He sniffed and allowed the tears to fall freely. His vision blurred and the image of the broken glass once protecting the intricate design of the watch's dial warped in front of his eyes. The orbs that had been spinning merrily as he had handed the watch over into Draco's care lay in between the still hands, equally unmoving.
Draco wheezed as he inhaled painfully. "No," Harry had to lean down in order to catch the whispered word. "They would take too long and are too dangerous."
Disclaimer: This story ignores Oliver’s age. Don’t get confused :) Harry and Draco are fifteen, Oliver is seventeen.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, walking slowly towards the wooden table, never taking his eyes off the parchment in his hands. His brilliant eyes met my rather boring looking ones as he gave me the Ministry letter. “It’s yours. You read it. I’m sure it’s nothing too serious,” his voice was calm, his smile gentle, his lips way too soft and enticing looking for his own good.
"Don't be ridiculous, Harry," Hermione snapped and whirled around from where she had been keeping an eye on the mansion. "We have to leave now and with 'we' I mean all of us. Draco," the blond's head jerked up, light grey eyes looked at her tiredly, "can you stand up?"
I nodded to Granger, to show her my support for Harry’s announcement. That’s how you act around a woman like her. Act as if you don’t feel the slightest bit nervous in her presence and don’t care one bit that she tried to murder you with her fierce gaze only.
"Do you?" A sad laugh escaped his parted lips. "I'm so sorry that I can't be the one that you deserve. I'm so sorry that I'm not strong enough to go against him and choose for myself. You know that I would choose differently. I don’t have any control over that but please let me protect you as much as I can. Please."
“You’re alive,” she sounded relieved, which gave him hope that maybe someday she might actually forgive him and maybe even become his friend.
“Would you mind telling us what exactly you’re doing in an unused broom cupboard, both covered in dust?” Harry grinned down at her as she straightened her school robes, trying not to blush too much.
Draco froze, a shocked yet happy sob escaped his lips as he quickly whirled around and stared right into blinking green eyes that looked at him with both surprise, relief and love.
he was doing what he was doing. His original plan had merely been getting Potter to go out with him and thus give Pansy something she could work with for her article. And now he was acting like a total Hufflepuff, blushing and all, and was actually
He could still feel that laugh if he closed his eyes and let all the worried thoughts flow out of his head. He had not said it then, but he had admitted to himself as he had returned into the mansion that that night had been the last between the two wizards. He was sure that the other had known and he was thankful that it had not stood between them. They had both needed it as a source of a sense of security and love, giving them strength for what the future had in hand for them.
He forced himself to turn his head to his right slowly. The motion made his head spin and he had to inhale deeply to not vomit all over the young man sitting hunched in an uncomfortable-looking wooden chair at his bed side. Raven hair was sticking out at unnatural angles, clumping together and making it look anything but its usually shiny nature. A small strand of the soft texture hung into closed eyes, lashes fanned over pale cheeks.
Draco blinked at the blushing wizard and took a deep breath. “I didn’t quite catch that,” he deadpanned and waited for Harry to get his Gryffindor courage back because that he would need if he had dared to get himself hurt and tried to wave it off as something not worth mentioning.
He looked dead. Only the movement of his chest and the slight tremors going through his body calmed Draco down enough not to start panicking immediately.
He was worried that something had happened to a guy who lied, betrayed, and used him! Malfoy didn’t deserve him!
Harry eyed him warily as Draco’s laugh subsided slowly. “Why are you doing this?” He asked softly as Draco’s false chuckles stopped.
Ron didn’t look happy, but didn’t say anything else to contradict her. He looked towards Harry and nodded, proving his absolute and blind trust in his friends. “You ready?”
Her eyes darted from Harry to Draco and back again. Both of them seemed different than just this morning at breakfast. Not that she was particularly close to the blond but she was with the raven-haired Gryffindor and that much was for sure – he was behaving differently.
Draco blinked after her, clearly confused as to what had just happened. “Um, are you drunk, Potter?”
"Are you sure, Harry?" Draco looked at the expensive-looking watch that was resting in the palm of his right hand.
Granger sighed and massaged the bridge of her nose with two fingers. “They aren’t going to throw you into Azkaban, Malfoy.”
Ah, Granger. Of course, I could have thought about that wicked, way too intelligent for her own good, muggleborn witch. Yes, I have worked on my vocabulary, thank you very much.
"Well, I told him I wanted to catch up with him and chat about the good old times over a butterbeer-"
“But how?” The younger Greengrass sister was close to tears as she listened to Daphne’s story. “It will never work out!”
Draco flinched as he saw something that looked eerily like a huge puddle of halfway dried blood underneath a fallen column. He couldn’t believe what destruction one man could accomplish, just by finding insane enough people and others who have too much to lose that are either too desperate or too scared to not follow him, and torture and kill along the way.
He rubbed his eyes tiredly as he saw a man drag his woman away from him, glancing over his shoulder as if Draco might attack them any second. He sighed and downed the rest of the whiskey in his glass. He rolled his shoulders and looked around. He had to be here
This one is from the third season of the Quidditch League Fanfiction Competition on FFN. In this one, we had to write about forbidden relationships.
The population of Hogwarts was excited and it was impossible to not feel it. So, as Ginny sat in front of the burning fire in the nearly empty Common Room, she couldn’t help but smile.
Said young wizard raised his head and looked at the origin of the deep voice. His father stood in the door frame, a neutral, yet calm expression on his face as he looked at his only son. Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw his mother straighten up and tense. He just barely held back his infamous scowl as he looked his father into the eye.
His heart made a slight jump as he saw a familiar head of bushy brown hair in a group of redheads. Hermione Granger had turned into a sort of friend during their sixth year, yet she had never truly forgiven him for what he had done since their first year.
"They were indeed interesting, I have to say," Draco replied and a soft smile appeared on his face as he tried to look everywhere but to the spot next to him where Harry was doing the exact same thing.
“Do you know how they did that to you?” Deep green eyes studied him closely as the Malfoy heir swallowed.
What awaited him inside nearly had Draco lose what little food he had managed to force down this morning.
“He’s fine,” she said as they moved towards the stairs and away from curious eyes. “He fell asleep as soon as I managed to drag him into his bed.” She chuckled, but the sadness still lingered in her eyes.
The bushy-haired witch looked at Harry for some painfully long seconds. Her best friend had hectic red spots that were colouring his cheeks, his eyes were wide and desperate, and the hand that wasn’t clutching the cloak as if his life depended on it – which was very likely – clenched and unclenched in a nervous manner.
peaceful and purposefully ignorant life had ended. The Dark Lord had returned, and once Draco returned back home, his father took him aside and explained to him what was expected of their family, and how he had to behave and act.
Even at Hogwarts he hadn’t been able to breathe because students tended to follow him everywhere he went – the library, the class rooms – no matter whether it was an eighth year class and they were supposed to be in a second year one. Some even had the courage to march straight into the Quidditch changing rooms which had not only been horribly embarrassing for his boxershorts-clad self but for the other team members as well.
Feeling like a prisoner being led to receive the Dementor's kiss, he held his head high as he walked through the long halls of Malfoy Manor, his mother closely behind him. He ignored the paintings that yelled encouragements and supremacy bullshit that was supposed to make him excited as they passed by. Contrary to his expectations, Narcissa Malfoy did not lead her son into the meeting room that usually served as the main location for initiations but to a rather narrow and hidden staircase that he knew led to the dungeons.
“I had started to think he was even more thickheaded than I had originally believed him to be.” Hermione grinned at her, a mug of hot cocoa in her hands. She had asked an elf for one earlier and had immediately wrapped her fingers around the warm porcelain when it had been delivered. Ginny watched Hermione’s subconscious smile every time it filled up automatically.
Disappointment was the main emotion that Harry felt at that moment, mixed with anger. Situations like this were accumulating lately, and he didn't know what to do about it. Draco hadn't been like this when they had started their relationship. If he had, Harry wouldn't have wasted so much time and energy in what they had, but time and time again he couldn't help but think that something was wrong. When your partner kept flaking on you, surely that wasn't normal?
“He isn’t a Death Eater,” Draco turned around and saw a livid Harry, who had effort to put his glass down slowly, as to not smash it on the table top. “He was cleared of all charges,” well, that wasn’t exactly true, but that witch didn’t need to know the minor verdicts anyway. Who was she to interfere with their business anyway?
Blinking, confused, Draco took a deep breath to remark that he hadn’t even said anything when a pair of soft lips took every bit of left-over oxygen out of his system, kissing him into unconsciousness. The slightly chapped lips moved against his, kissing him softly, lovingly, yet with a hidden strength and desperation that Draco did not dare to pull back, as he cautiously lifted his right arm and pushed his fingers into that soft, tangled mess the other called hair.
“I want you to find out who the remaining Death Eaters are and where they are currently hiding, my dear boy,” the strong voice of the white haired man in front of him broke through the confused rambling inside his head.
"Don't," he whispered and gently wiped a crystal tear from his boyfriend's face. "Don't cry. I understand."
His heart was beating too fast, and it was slowly getting difficult to get enough air into his lungs. The room was too stuffy, too hot.
I pushed the letter back into the envelope and thrusted it into Harry’s direction. “No, you open it. Please.”
The young wizard slowly turned his empty eyes onto the cloaked Death Eater next to him. His eyes were shining behind his mask, glistening in a maniacally way.
"Well, of course!" Malfoy huffed and jokily glared at Harry, causing his stomach to do a weird somersault within his body, leaving the smaller wizard dizzy and befuddled. "Wealth is the ability to fully experience life. Why wouldn't I use it to make this date as enjoyable as possible for both you and me?"
Groaning loudly as another wave of pain hit him, he tried to push himself to his knees. He refused to suffocate in his own damn room! He just had to reach the window and everything would be fine. Someone would see him and he would once again be able to breathe and get some order into his thoughts.
"I will do no such thing without you and now shut up and let me think," the beautiful voice of his lover hissed as he muttered the words, "dangerous" and "killed", but the raven-haired boy didn't listen.
Hermione sat up and put her mug down on top of the coffee table. Upon contact, the porcelain started whirring just before the cup proceeded to jump up and down, anxious to be picked up again. “You’ll see,” she said with so much certainty that Ginny couldn’t help but believe her, “Malfoy’s changed. He would never hurt Harry.
Because some bimbo had sent him a letter he had intended to ignore only to have it ripped out of his hand by none other than Pancy Parkinson herself who immediately started gushing about how cute all of this was and teased him with having a crush with whom he’d write love letters. Pfft, as if a Malfoy would downgrade himself like that. But he had had to agree on meeting said mystery crush in order to shut her up and prove to her that he had indeed no idea who that person might be and to prove that he had no positive thoughts about this matter whatsoever. It was very twisted logic but logic one Pansy Parkinson thought to be accurate and who was he to not do anything in his power to convince her that he did not have a crush that sent him love letters?
Hermione nodded slowly and Ginny could practically see her brain working at high speed. After a few moments of silence, she took a deep breath. “I think he’s changed. No, I really do,” she added, eyebrows high on her forehead, as she had seen Ginny’s sceptical look. “I know it’s odd, and I know Ron has a problem accepting it, but have you really looked at Harry recently? Have you noticed how happy he is? That’s Malfoy that’s doing that, and if I’m honest, as long as Harry is that happy, I don’t care who is the reason for that.”
Even after all this time Harry still found old wounds that needed to be healed and as if it wasn’t anything special or anything to be thankful for, he just reached out and made sure Draco was alright.
He took a deep breath and strengthened his mental walls. Voldemort frowned, obviously displeased. Draco was sure that Lucius would get into a lot of trouble once this was over, since he wouldn’t be there anymore to take all the blame. Hiding thoughts from their master was a huge act of disobedience, which was usually dealt with through torture.
Cautiously, as to not make any sound, Harry pulled the door shut, twisting the doorknob in the last second to keep it from falling shut and possibly alerting any house elves. Trying to calm his nerves, he hurried further down the hallway to the next door. He pushed it open, only to find a relatively small room filled with bookshelves that reached to just underneath the ceiling. A desperate huff escaped him, and he moved to the next door.
A punch in his knee had him bend down himself, catching his fall at the last second before his face would have made contact with the uncomfortably hard floor. He couldn’t believe it. Pure instinct and his bloody so-called father had him involuntarily kneel down in front of a monster. A voice in the back of his head that sounded suspiciously like Harry yelled at him to stand back up. Doing that would get him killed in an instant. Straightening up and looking the darkest wizard of the last century in the eye, though... That he could do, he thought cheekily, and risked his health and probably head as he raised the latter defiantly and glared at the ugly man in the doorway.
As Draco’s shouts drifted off, Hermione turned towards her sheepish looking boyfriend and narrowed her eyes. Blaise gulped. “What was all that about?”
“Yes, Zabini. He was getting on Draco’s nerves, but that rightful idiot is too much of a pureblood to just tell him to bugger off and leave him alone.” That was the first time Nott had said anything and his words turned her stomach upside down.
Grumbling, I turned around and buried my face into the softest pillow I could find. It smelled fresh, like flowers and air. I smiled happily and started to drift slowly back to sleep. The edges of my consciousness became fuzzy, my focus on the nearly forgotten dream of one black-haired wizard lying at the shore of the Black Lake, with only a pair of swim trunks on…
"Hey." Harry looked up and saw the blond standing in the doorway, looking worried. Go figure. "Are you okay?"
A frown darkened his face as he wandered through the dungeon corridors towards the meeting spot he was supposed to be at in - he cast the
He didn't feel the usual butterflies somersaulting in his stomach as Draco's thumb ghosted over the back of his hand, only emptiness, which increased as he saw the apologetic look in his boyfriend's eyes.
Draco gaped at the witch standing in front of him. An easy smile lit up her face as she saw his reaction. “Y-You’d do that?” he stuttered, not caring how ridiculous his reaction had been.
She leaned over him, uncorked the vial and let one drop of potion fall onto each of his eyelids. They twitched slightly as the cold liquid hit the soft skin. "Do your magic," the heir of the Greengrass family whispered as she watched the drops seep into the thin flesh.
A smile lightened up the Slytherin’s face as Harry leaned forward and caught his lips in a sweet kiss that would forever be engraved in his memories.
A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth as he closed his eyes and enjoyed the love he felt radiating from her. "I missed you too, mother."
"Our Lord has chosen a special task for you, son," Lucius Malfoy said quietly, and kicked the girl in the stomach as she sniffed loudly. "I said hold your filthy mouth, you pathetic creature!"
"Draco, open your eyes. Please, it's me. Harry. I'm here now, love! Everything will be okay. You'll see," his muttered words fell on deaf ears as the first desperate tear dropped into blond hair. "Don't do this to me!"
A ear-splitting bang ripped Harry out of his concentration. He whipped around and stared at the three men standing in the doorway, the destroyed door blown off its hinges. Evil grins spread over their faces as the blond man in the front raised his wand. Harry, not wasting precious seconds to think, acted purely on instinct as he yelled the first hex that came to mind, at the exact same moment as Lucius Malfoy's cold voice filled the room.
He laughed awkwardly and put it back down. Clearing his throat, he tried to smile pleasantly at the annoying woman. “Well, I guess you’ve found me,” he chuckled weakly and gulped as the woman started laughing hysterically. It reminded him painfully of Aunt Petunia’s laugh when Uncle Vernon’s boss and his wife had been over for dinner.
Draco’s eyes widened as he set eyes on the Gryffindor common room for the very first time. Plush, red couches and seats littered the room, soft carpets covered the dark wooden floor, and the lighting was warm and inviting. This room was the exact opposite of the Slytherin common room, and he couldn’t help but feel the slight tinge of jealousy that shot through him.
"No," the blond moaned and squeezed his eyes shut. It was too dangerous! He didn't want them here, especially not him. He could get hurt, or worse killed, and all because of him! He wasn't worth it! Harry had to get out of here and leave as quickly as possible!
He smiled sadly and pressed a light and loving kiss onto my forehead. “I’m sure she will,” he whispered, pushing the stray strand of hair behind my ear. I scowled. “She just needs some time to get along with the current situation.”
His voice was excited, his eyes showed a determination that was endearing. It meant the world to him that he wanted him enough to ask him to abandon everything he had known and to just stay.
“You know what?” He stood up and helped me onto my feet. “I’ll firecall Hermione. She works in that department and I’m sure she’ll help us. Or at least tell us what to expect.”
“Please, Harry,” a soft voice interrupted the tense silence that had filled the room after his outburst.
Grumbling, I tried to push a lone strand of white-blond hair back, without throwing a fit of rage when it decided to jump back onto my forehead, where it tickled my temple like there was no tomorrow. I glared at the mirror.
Harry snickered as Hermione gaped at her husband, who shuffled forward and pointed at his back. “Sure,” Harry scratched his friend’s back just between the shoulder blades, getting a satisfied groan from the red-haired wizard.
need a break, Draco. We can't go on like this. If you promise something, I rely on you, and you end up disappointing me… It's not a huge deal if it's flour you've forgotten or you haven't told me that you needed to stay at work for longer, but it's how you go about it. You let me wait for you, sitting on the couch and wondering whether something has happened to you. You force me to go to Molly's and tell her that my boyfriend won't make it to her sixtieth birthday, although one of her sons who lives in Romania has arrived a day early to surprise her, even though his work doesn't allow it."
A booming laugh had them freeze again as Harry pushed away from the wall he had been leaning against and leaned down to them, still giggling, as he tried to pull her away from the other Gryffindor who was doing his best in fending off the Slytherin as the latter pulled him onto his feet, the sneer more prominent on his aristocratic face than usual.
Draco took a deep breath to keep from shivering. This was wrong. This was so wrong. What was he thinking just going along with it? He could’ve been at Harry’s side right now if he had just stayed.
“I didn’t know that this was what I found out. To be honest, I didn’t want to think about it being a possibility, but having spent last night with you…” A shy smile crept onto his face. His pink cheeks highlighted his bright grey eyes as he tried to, once again, find the right words. “I don’t want to go back to how it used to be! I don’t want to act as if nothing has changed because something
“It can’t be helped.” Harry shrugged. “You destroy one Dark Wizard, and everyone thinks you’re the Gaea’s gift to magic...”
Potter stood, snatching his shirt and suit coat from the floor. “Then we go to the Hall of Records.”
Lydia pursed her lips. “There are a finite number of good looking wizards in this world, forgive your majority female staff for wanting to appreciate an excellent specimen.”
“I’m sure it’s very lovely. Utterly adorable.” Draco deadpanned. “It’s just not in an ideal location.”
Harry flopped back down on the bed, hearing the crack of Disapparation. “No, you’re to good for me.” He replied quietly.
“I asked Harry to.” Draco replied. “I know that you all aren’t entirely fond of me or my family and I didn’t want our budding relationship to affect his relationship with all of you.”
“Yes, very good.” Quentin focused on his notepad. “But potentially dangerous if it’s intercepted, especially so if someone is stalking you.”
“Yes, that’s about right.” Draco replied. “Send me your travel details, Pans. You’ve earned your trip.”
Draco leaned back in his chair. All, or most as Marc had said, of the clerks had gone home for the day. He stared down at the small pile of paperwork he'd completed. Surely the clerks that were still here had no desire
“You really are, you know.” He turned in the tub, grey eyes starting into green. “Do you want to know when I fell for you? Honestly fell for you?”
“Drake… D-Draco…” Harry curled his fingers around the bars of the headboard. “I can’t… I-I’m going… Uhn…”
Draco strode from the bathroom, completely dressed. “I suppose that’s true. You can be very distracting.”
. I let him get so close, and yet, I still feel as though I'm an arm's length away from him. I can't help but get the feeling that he's keeping something from me."
Narcissa raised an eyebrow. “Why did you decide to get married? I assume there was a method to your decision making.”
Harry sighed as he pushed open the door to the Lilly Foundation offices. The light blue-grey walls were still plastered with photos of
Draco rolled his eyes. “Why you ask? Why are we in the horribly decorated room?” He held up his left hand. “Tis because we are married.”
The three Slytherins stared in awe as Potter downed all four shots of tequila. He shivered slightly, the alcohol starting to seep into his system. Harry then snapped at the barman. The Gryffindor smiled broadly at the man. He flushed deeply in return at the attention.
“Absolutely not!” Harry dipped even lower in the bath. “I know what that thing is and I’m not going to let you take a photo of me in the bath!”
“I am well aware that you are an adult, Harry.” Hermione followed after him. “You promised you’d cut back on the drinking. I’ve watched you jump from one serious relationship to a marriage with a man I believed that you one-hundred percent hated—”
, they will see the strong Destroyer of the Dark Lord as a sweet-faced bride of a former Death Eater’s son.” He exposed a tan strip of Harry’s stomach. “It’s honestly a little bit of a turn on.”
Harry plowed on. “—Last night was the final straw for me. I gave you an ultimatum, either be with me forever or I was gone.”
Draco licked and nipped Harry's cock before taking the length into his mouth. Harry moaned deliciously, enjoying being enveloped by the warm heat of Draco's mouth. It wasn't long before Harry's hips were bucking, his back arching up off the bed. His hands clutching at the sheets. Draco looked up and almost came at the sight of Harry's face. His face was slightly turned to the right, bottom lip caught between pearly white teeth. A deep blush splayed across his cheeks. Dark eyelashes fluttering, hiding his bright green eyes from the world. Draco continued laving and sucking Harry, until the dark-hair man couldn't take any more attention.
Lydia stood. “Reid has been handling them. He said between the goblins and himself that there wasn’t really a need to have all eyes on the weeklies. He thought it would be most efficient to discuss any irregularities during the monthly board meetings.”
“The Great and Powerful Harry Potter.” Lysander replied, shaking Harry’s hand. “Your photos really do you no justice. I can see why my nephew fell for you.”
Ron shrugged. “Just covering all the bases. You never know, we’ve had weirder things happen to us in our lives.”
“Yes, but that was almost two years ago. Right around the time he would have bumped into you.” Pansy said slyly.
“She’s concerned about you.” Draco said, his tone touched with worry. “After doing a little digging myself, I am too.”
“No, we’re meeting him at eight o’clock, Mother was very specific in the Howler she sent me.” Draco explained, walking briskly. “We are going to my flat to discuss what to tell him when he asks why I decided to toss my betrothal to the Greengrasses into the fire and marry the Savior of the Wizarding World.”
He sighed, flopping back on the bed. “Perhaps I’ll pop round to the Foundation offices today instead of lazing about the flat.”
Just keep this giant secret and let it fester for the rest of our lives.” Draco sighed. “I need some tea…”
“I’m fine. Totally fine. I may have had one too many but I’m fine.” Harry reassured. “If you could please do me a huge favor and not tell Molly, I would greatly appreciate it.”
Magic. Spells that are rarely used anymore, so people forget to check for them. My grandfather was very adamant that I never lose sight of the old ways.”
“Yes, um… There was a method to the decision making.” Harry began, shrinking under Narcissa’s gaze. “In that there was no real method to the decision making.”
“You’ll have to forgive me.” Draco said tightly. “I wasn’t paying much attention to the rest of my office.”
you’d tone down the drinking.” Hermione crossed her arms angrily. “But there you were gulping down flutes of champagne at your wedding celebration. I heard from Templeton, who was at
.” Pansy smiled. “Four shots of your finest tequila, barman!” The man nodded and pulled a bottle from the top shelf.
Draco watched as Harry continued to shamelessly flirt with the bartender until the man left the bottle. Feeling victorious, Harry took a pull directly from the bottle.
Pansy tugged Harry through the club, Blaise and Draco trailing close behind. She pushed the Gryffindor into a stool near the bar and snapped at the barman. She ordered something called a Snake Bite, practically poured the drink down Harry’s throat, giggling madly.
“I’m doing a bit of research about my parents and I wanted to know if it was possible if I could take a look at their marriage certificate.” Harry leaned over the desk. “I don’t know much about them and it would really mean a lot to me if I knew when and where they got married.”
Draco sighed. “Important things. Large things. Things that have been in motion since I was an infant.” He pinched the bridge of his nose. “You should go home, shower and find the classiest outfit that you have in what I can imagine to be the most minuscule wardrobe for a wealthy wizard then meet me at this address. Two hours should be an acceptable timeframe, yes?” He handed Harry a card.
“Franco,” Draco folded his hands in his lap. “Is it possible for us to keep this simple and light? For my husband’s sake, please?”
“Not another word, Draco.” Narcissa folded her hands in her lap and turned to Harry. “You have created a shit storm of epic proportions for my family, Mister Potter. Here’s what going to happen. I’m going to give you a week to tell your family and friends that you’ve married my son. In two weeks, I will throw you a perfectly planned announcement party where you will pose for the
Draco groaned. "What do I have to do, Harry? What? I've been a completely open book for your to write whatever you please. I've learned to appreciate Hermione,
Draco sighed, closing his eyes and leaning back in his chair. He could have it infinitely worse if he had followed through with his Grandfather’s selection. He had been slightly aware that he had been courting a betrothal to the Greengrasses, Astoria to be most accurate. She fit the general Malfoy demographic. Petite, blonde and beautiful with dangerously icy intelligence not unlike his mother. Harry Potter could not be more opposite than what his Grandfather designed for him. The phone on his desk rang loudly, interrupting his thoughts.
“He was, but he was promoted to the Head Solicitor when Mortimar retired.” Draco replied. “He actually recommended me for the position.”
Draco licked and nipped his way from Harry’s neck down to the sharp curve of his hipbone. He sucked hard in the space where Harry’s leg met his hip, causing the brunette to flick his hips forward. His cock bounced against his stomach, hard as steel. Draco hovered over it, staring up at Harry. His grey-blue eyes clouded with lust as he waited for permission. Harry lifted his hips to meet Draco’s lip, the blonde licking a stripe from the hilt to tip. Harry shivered violently as Draco swallowed him whole.
"Hat? What ha—" Out of nowhere, a Santa hat appeared. "Is he serious? I'm not wearing this." As if the little note knew exactly what he was saying, the words bolded themselves and grew bigger. "Fine..."
“You know, I used to think that you used to hide behind Granger’s intelligence, but you’ve got a brain of your own.”
He could practically hear the eye roll through the phone. “You two have been together not even a month and you’re already looking for dirt?”
Draco kissed him deeply before pulling away to dig in his bedside table. Pulling out a honey-colored jar, he popped the lid off and dipped his fingers into it. Harry watched with anticipation, rolling his hips forward. Draco smiled, hovering over Harry as he eased a finger into the tight heat. Harry moaned, arching slightly off the bed, clawing his hands into the sheets. The blonde leaned down, peppering kisses along Harry’s collarbone, his neck. He added a second and a third, twisting and stretching, leaving Harry gasping, begging for the blonde to be inside him. Draco obliged and buried himself to the hilt, causing Harry to cry out.
“And Deputy Head Solicitor of the Wizengamot?” Hermione leaned back in her chair. “I mean, he may be the youngest wizard to ever hold that position. His career path alone would elevate the Malfoy name back to good standing. Marrying Harry would just be a bonus.”
"I love you. I love you, Harry James Potter." Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's small frame. "I love you more than I love my own goddamn magic."
Marc set the photo back down. "That's your prerogative." He leaned against Draco's desk. "It's not like you can file anything anyway. Most of the clerks have gone home for the holiday."
“’Mione, I assume that you are trying to make a point that Draco’s friends are a bad influence,” Harry snapped, walking back into the kitchen. “but I am an adult. Or have you forgotten?”
“No, they were not the happiest, though I think that my uncle rather likes you.” Draco replied, looking up from his files. “Don’t you have work to do?”
Harry’s words spurred him on, sucking the brunette slowly, he pressed a finger gently against his entrance. Harry tangled his fingers in Draco’s hair as he felt himself being breached. He moaned deeply, feeling as Draco wordlessly performed a preparation spell.
Harry crept over the threshold of their bed, the dim light of the bathroom warming the room. His bloodied clothes lay in a pile just outside the bathroom door. Harry twisted a hand, conjuring a plastic bag. He leaned against the doorjamb, just like Pansy had done earlier and watched Draco in the bath. The once milky white of the water was now tinged pink, the blonde wizard’s head lolling slightly against the back of the tub. He knelt on the thick rug that stuck out from underneath the tub, , dipping a hand into the water.
.” The square glowed brightly and then she returned it to her purse. “Thank you for your cooperation. He should be home shortly.”
Realization dawned on Draco’s face. “The gold would react with the Ashwinder eggs, creating memory loss.”
He knew that Harry had lied. That what Hermione had disclosed to him made perfect sense. Why they had ended their relationship so suddenly. Why Harry never spoke of his previous relationships. Draco knew the situation all too well. Partners of powerful people too afraid to leave their situation for fear of the loss of the comfortable life that had become accustom to. A pretty outside with an absolutely toxic center they only showed behind closed doors. Draco slumped in his seat. He should have known better than to confront Harry directly about the situation. It had never worked with nervous plaintiffs he dealt with on what seemed like a weekly basis.
“So, your family… They’re rather upset you married me then.” Harry said quietly, flopping into an overstuffed leather chair.
He stalked back down the hallway, across the siting room, slamming the door of his office behind him. Clenching his fists, he sat back down at his desk and angrily began shuffling through his files. Potter seemed insufferable, a constant game of hot-and-cold. He had to admit that he enjoyed the demure version of the Savior as much as the feisty one.
“It wasn’t intentional, we were both drunk.” Harry replied, pulled his shirt more firmly over the bruise. “We just got a little out of hand. I mean I practically asked for it…”
“Your fourteen citations say otherwise.” The blonde pinched the space between his brows. “You’ve experienced something traumatic on more than one occasion. You have nightmares – do not deny they don’t exist because I can hear you at night. You isolate yourself, yet you don’t want to be alone. The hyper-sexuality while intoxicated—”
“That’s incredibly taxing to do every day.” Draco replied. “Perhaps we can reside at my apartment during the week and your lovely cottage on the weekends and holidays.”
The room moved to hug and congratulate the pair on their recent nuptials. Draco and Harry smiled graciously and left quietly. Ron flopped down into one of their emptied chairs, while his father paced across the room.
“Welcome to Hall of Records.” She deadpanned, flipping another page. “My name is Poppy Canham; how may I help you?”
Ron cleared his throat. “Sorry to bother you, but I wanted to introduce you to Kearns and Furey. They’ll be taking the daylight shifts, so they’ll be the ones out and about with you.”
Draco looked over Harry’s head to find Pansy and Blaise looking wonderfully scandalized. He looked down at Harry. Even in the dim lighting, he could see the alcohol-induced blush coloring his cheeks. The flirtatious smirk that played across his lips, the seductive look in his bright green eyes. Draco leaned back from Harry, taking two large swigs from the tequila bottle.
off the shelf and sat down in the chair Imogen provided for him. The children wiggled excitedly, whispering behind small hands to one another and staring adoringly at him. He choose to read
“He speaks!” Draco’s grandfather leaned back in his chair. “Alright, Mister Potter, you have the floor.”
So enjoy the new chapters -- but also, if you've been a fan for a while, I HIGHLY recommend going back and re-reading earlier chapters.
“Hello, Mister Potter.” She smiled, plopping herself down into the seat across the desk. “Or, I suppose I should say congratulations, Mister Malfoy.”
Staring up at the canopy of the impressive queen-sized four-poster, his thoughts drifting back to the previous night. Watching Draco dance in a crowd of people had been an intense turn on. The blonde knew how to move his body in a way that should be illegal. Pulling himself into a sitting position, he slid slowly off the and stalked to his wardrobe. Pulling out a t-shirt and a well-worn pair of sweatpants, he dressed quickly and then headed to the kitchen. Opening a cupboard, he reached to take down a kettle and cup for tea when there was a sharp knock at the door. Moving quickly from the kitchen, he pulled open the door to find a stern-faced Hermione.
“You look… sufficient.” Draco raked his eyes over Harry’s form. “It’s a good color for you skin tone and it’s expertly tailored. Shall we go?” He gestured toward the tall grey building.
“Shhhh…” Harry wordlessly summoned a washcloth. “We’re not going to talk about right now. We’re going to talk about happier things.”
Narcissa began pacing the room again until she heard the sure footsteps of her son and his guest enter the room. Draco strode forward and kissed his mother on both cheeks.
Hermione leaned back in her chair, pinching the bridge of her nose. Remus and Sirius sat silently, looking at one another while the Weasleys sat stunned. Harry lifted his hand to naw on his thumbnail, only to have Draco take his hand in his own. Hermione raised an eyebrow at the gesture.
“Well, I’m glad, but I am also happy to see you back in the office.” Lydia sat back in the chair. “Anything I can help you with?”
Draco crawled onto the bed between Harry’s legs. He pushed Harry’s knees outward, running a hand down the inside of his thigh. The brunette moaned, spreading his legs further. Draco pressed a finger into him, finding that he wasn’t lying about any preparation not being necessary. Placing on hand on Harry’s hip, he angled himself with Harry’s entrance.
“Molly, dear.” She corrected. “None of this ‘Mrs Weasley’ business now that you’re married to our Harry.”
“I suppose only the people who can get close enough to see them.” Harry scrubbed the blood from his hands. “Even I don’t notice them and they’re on my face.”
Draco leaned in towards Harry. “Spanakopita is just a fancy title for spinach and cheese wrapped in phyllo. You’ll like it.”
Franco rolled his eyes. “I suppose I could come up with a simplified menu for your husband’s delicate palate.”
“T-trust me… i-it’s not neces-necessary.” Harry arched again, clutching the sheets. “For god’s sake, just fuck me.”
Sighing, he trudged down the hallway to their bedroom. Pushing opening the door, he found Harry lying face up on the bed.
She was a little over right months pregnant, though she looked like she could pop at any moment. Not that any of the three men would say that to her face. They knew better.
“Every Brit should have a healthy appreciation for Coldplay, Elton John, and Billy Joel.” Draco replied, sliding out of bed.
“Yes, I’m quite sure. There’s only three mild Lust Potions that would make your body feel hot like it did. Only one of them has coriander in them.”
“I’m going to go check on the food. The two of you go and mingle.” Narcissa readjusted the wreath on Harry’s head. “Draco, make sure to say hello to your uncle first.”
“Just HSW Cristler and DHS Mogin.” Draco was thoughtful for a moment. “And two clerks. Rhys Payter and… er.. a new kid. Travill. Alfie, I think his first name is.”
He turned around to find Harry standing behind him, a delicate blush playing across his cheeks. "Hello..." He murmured.
“One of the many perks of being an in the Order of Merlin-First Class.” Harry tossed him his coat. “People tend to just do things because I smile at them.”
“Dumbledore left the Resurrection Stone to me after he died. This was after Voldemort turned it into a Horcrux. I left it on the floor of the Forbidden Forest after Voldemort hit me with the Killing Curse.” He ran the bar over Draco’s chest. “The Elder Wand, I won from you, after I wrestle it away from you when we were brought to the Manor by Snatchers. You won it from Dumbledore, before he died. And the Cloak of Invisibility is a Potter family heirloom.”
“I will remember.” He kissed Draco deeply, pausing only at the knock at the door. “To be continued?”
“From what I understand, it’s real. And due to the lack of clothing we woke up with, we most certainly consummated the relationship.” Draco twirled the ring around his finger. “We’d have to check the Hall of Records to be absolutely sure.”
“I see…” Hermione pulled the two of them into an alcove. “He hasn’t told you anything a Reid, has he?”
“Because telling your grandfather that we got black-out drunk and then got married on a whim doesn’t seem like a stellar idea.”
He stood in front of the mirror, brushing his teeth. After rinsing, he stared at his face. He stared at the smattering of freckles that dusted over his nose and cheeks. The way his green eyes stood out in a ridiculous manner but still somehow fit his face. He wasn’t unattractive by any means but he wasn’t anywhere near Draco Malfoy’s league. He sighed and dipped his hand into a pot of Sleakeazy’s hair potion Hermione had gifted him and quickly ran his hands through his hair. Exiting the bathroom, he dressed quickly and Apparated to the location that Draco had given him. He hadn’t landed for more than thirty seconds to find Draco waiting patiently on a park bench, reading the
“But you have agree that it’s a bit odd that they’re together.” Ron said. “I mean the last time that they were in a room together was graduation.”
I wasn't going to post two chapters today, but I feel like the loyal fans of this thing deserve it. Enjoy!
“I, er… Um… Perhaps?” Draco shutting his eyes, expecting to come to some type of fisticuffs. “Perhaps… I have… grown to…
Harry walked backward towards the bed, pulling the t-shirt over his head. Draco followed, lifting the dark-haired wizard and tossing him onto it. Harry barely shimmied out of his boxers by the time Draco was on him. He kissed and licked every inch of skin he could see. This was his Harry. This Harry with freckles on his nose, wild dark hair, and emerald-bright eyes. This Harry that snorted when he laughed, that hummed Elton John when he cooked, that snored lightly on the sofa waiting for him to return. This Harry that washed blood from his hands and kissed his scars. This Harry bore a pretty flush across his cheeks and moaned deeply as Draco tasted him. Not the cold, lifeless body that had sat propped in his office chair. Not the empty green eyes that stared in unending silence. No, his Harry’s eyes burned the color of the Killing Curse. His lips bruised pink from kissing. He started to turn over when Draco stopped him.
Linley glanced sideways at Ron. “Was it normal for the Wizengamot Administration Offices to be that empty during that time of day?”
Draco and Harry spent the next two hours, pacing bout Draco’s enormous, perfectly decorated flat, trying to concoct a plausible story to tell Draco’s grandfather but were failing miserably. Harry had taken off his suit coat and toed off his shoes, lying back on the ridiculously expensive sofa. Draco was currently wearing a hole into the expensive carpet of his sitting room floor.
Pansy in turn rolled her eyes. “Oh, of course you would, Potter.” She popped her head over the sofa. “C’mon Draco… Bring the little lion with you. Merlin knows he could use a little mindless debauchery.”
Draco chuckled. “That and I highly doubt that you would enjoy having carpet burn tomorrow. I know I wouldn’t.”
“Fine.” Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s forehead. “I’ll take the compliment. We should get going though, Mother is expecting us at six.”
Remus raised an eyebrow. “Is this a recent promotion? I thought Devon Cristler was the Deputy Head Solicitor.”
Harry tipped his head slightly. “So, you’re just going to work the entire time? You’re not going to follow his advice and relax with your new husband?”
“I just don’t understand why the food needs to be so complicated.” Harry replied, pushing the crab puff around his plate. “It’s just food.”
Harry nodded, dropping his glass on a floating tray as he made his way over to where Draco was standing. The blonde smiled softly at him as he wrapped an arm around his waist. As they stood speaking with Remus and Sirius, Harry wavered slightly. Draco tightened his grip around the dark-haired wizard’s waist and looked down with concern.
It was almost nine o’clock before Draco dragged him weary body over the threshold of his flat. It was dark, save for a small light on in his kitchen. He smiled slightly, seeing the covered plate on the table. He pulled the wrapping off to find it still hot. A simple dinner of chicken curry and rice, one of Harry’s specialties. Taking the plate and tucking his attaché case beneath his arm, he made his way towards his office, only to stop next to the sofa. Harry lay asleep on it, a tangled mess of limbs. Draco frowned, noticing the large bruise on his hip. He sat down on the coffee table, staring at the purple mark decorating Harry’s hip. His fingers ghosted over it lightly. Harry stirred, rolling over on his stomach, stretching like a cat.
“Yes, he is.” Draco replied, opening a cabinet containing a record player. “And a fucking talented one.” He held out his hand to Harry. “
Draco was instantly treated to the mental image of Harry in a Slytherin uniform, spread out across one of the dormitory beds, a look of smug satisfaction playing across his elfin features. “Oh, I can imagine.”
Harry's breathing became shallow. "Say it again." He stepped closer to Draco. "Please, say it again."
“I find my sexuality to be fluid.” The blonde slid behind his desk. “Most Purebloods are. We don’t find it necessary to fit ourselves into little descriptive boxes like the Muggles do.”
The warm sensation that had been sitting in the pit of his stomach started to burn. Those two little words. Two little words that Draco had been dying to hear from Harry forever. The post script had been put there to quash down any lascivious thoughts that had immediately entered his brain. He was thankful for the fact that he'd decided to walk home instead of Apparating. The cold night air kept his mind clear. As he came closer to the home that he and Harry shared, he found a little piece of paper floating near the door. Harry's script standing out boldly against the cream colored paper.
“I’m sure that you do.” The blonde wizard smiled. “But you’ll have a very nice navy set here on Thursday.”
“Yes, in the most delicious way.” Draco grabbed two flutes of champagne off a floating tray. “Uncle Lysander, so glad you could make it. I’m sure that you know my husband.”
“Er, around seven-fifteen. My last case ran later than I anticipated and I made a mental note that I needed to owl Harry that I was going to be late.”
Harry ran the soap over Draco’s back. “I said technically, I don’t know where two of them are at present. Rinse.”
Harry sighed, pushing the white-blonde locks from Draco’s face. “You are stupidly charming, you know that?”
I am not going to apologize for the length of this chapter, but to warn you that it is most likely going to be one of the heftiest ones. I was going to break it up but I thought that you all wouldn't care. You might even a appreciate a longer than normal chapter. So enjoy!
Narcissa placed the other wreath on Harry’s head. “You look rather dashing, Harry. Dress robes suit you.”
"He's terrified that if we do sleep together, that I'll leave him." Draco stared out the window. "Leave him and tell the world about it."
“She’s not wrong, Draco.” Harry sighed. “I wasn’t raised in this type of environment. I never learned the importance of canapés.”
Draco stretched. “I couldn’t risk damaging your delicate Gryffindor sensibilities by letting you wake up alone.”
“Anyway,” She continued. “I always thought something was off. Harry started to change. He’s always been somewhat quiet, not a fan of being alone in large spaces, but he his whole demeanor changed. The way he dressed changed. The way he would flinch ever so slightly when Reid touched him. He stopped going out. Stopped spending time with us. He started drinking more.” Hermione chewed on her bottom lip. “And then I started to see the bruises.”
Quentin closed his notepad. “I think we have everything that we need, Mister Malfoy. Thank you so much for your time.” He tapped the speaker box and then pocketed it. “The Department has assigned you a protective duty, both of you. From what I understand, Mister Malfoy, HSW Cristler has given you leave.” Draco nodded. “You’re welcome to enjoy it, all I ask is that you don’t leave the United Kingdom.”
“Yes, yes, coincidence.” Harry said, waving a hand dismissively. “A Cinnamon Cal isn’t a drink that you would normally order in a pub. It’s a drink meant to be shared at home between lovers.”
“Okay, fine...” Draco stood, picking up the plate and his attaché case. “I just want you to know that I would never hurt you like that on purpose. Intoxicated or not. As much as you think that I don’t care about you, I am concerned for your personal wellbeing.” He strode from the living room, the door to his office snapping shut.
“No, no, I want to.” Harry quipped. “This bed is significantly more comfortable than the one in the guest bedroom and you make an
“So… You don’t think they’re doing this as some sort of publicity stunt?” Bill asked, causing Fleur to smack him in the shoulder. “What? I wouldn’t put it past Malfoy to pull a stunt like this to pull his family’s name out of the gutter.”
Harry sat back in his chair. “Surprisingly normal. He works long hours. I cook dinner and wait for him to come home. He reads in bed and we snuggle. It’s all very normal.”
Cristler looked up from his file folder, stared at the two of them over his glasses. A small smile crept across his face. “Go home, Mister Malfoy.”
Harry moaned, wrapping his arms around Draco's neck. Draco murmured something and Harry felt a cool liquid filling him. He looked wide-eyed at Draco, who whispered that it was just a preparation spell. The blonde nuzzled Harry's neck and he pressed a finger into the warm tightness. Harry hissed at the intrusion, clenching tightly around Draco's finger. Draco whispered words of comfort, kissing Harry's face and neck. Thr brunette relaxed and he began to fuck him with his finger. Then applied a second, stretching him. It wasn't long before Harry was rocking in time with Draco's thrusts. Moaning erotically, begging for more.
Draco pulled out and thrust back in, starting a slow rhythm. It was driving Harry crazy. He was clawing at his chest. Running his slender fingers up the back of his neck. Speaking nonsensical things that sounded vaguely like Draco's name, asking him for more. Draco stared down at Harry's face. The expression was priceless. The deep blush that Draco had noticed before had spread to his ears. There was a fine sheen of sweat upon his brow. He looked perfect, just as Draco had imagined. He sped up, unable to control himself any longer. He wrapped a hand around Harry's erection and stroked it in time with his thrusts.
Draco sniggered as Harry rolled his eyes. “Why does everyone think I’m the ‘bottom’ of this relationship?”
’ to have this horrible scar running down his face. Where the Dark Lord had marked him. Then I met you, this small little mop head with a neat little lightning bolt in the center of his forehead. You weren’t ugly, you were the exact opposite. You looked like a little doll, with your round glasses and too bright green eyes. You were… You were almost too pretty to be a boy.”
Draco stared up at Harry’s spectacle-free face. He looked so infinitely young without them, you could see the smattering of freckles that ran over his nose. How thick and dark his lashes were. How intensely green his eyes were. Harry was handsome, ridiculously sweet, deceptively intelligent and witty. He was everything that Draco wanted while being everything his grandfather despised.
“Mmhmm.” The blonde murmured against his stomach. “Your skin looks like caramel. It looks very tasty.”
“Of course, Harry.” She waved him off. “Oh Draco, please make sure that he’s dressed appropriately for this affair.”
Draco laughed. “No… I never thought I’d see you again after the Leaving Ceremony.” He tucked a strand of hair behind Harry’s ear. “Then there you were, in that little out of the way, hole in the wall pub. You looked so different. You looked relaxed.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “That’s nearly two hours outside the city. Not necessarily ideal for a daily commute.”
Draco turned onto his back, pulling Harry more firmly onto his chest. “I do want you here. It’s nice not to be alone in this enormous flat. The fact that you actually know how to cook has been a wonderful bonus. Though,” He dropped his chin on top of Harry’s head. “I may have to parade you around like a fancy piece of arm candy at an upcoming Ministry function.”
“Son of a high-profile Death Eater becomes a prominent solicitor for the Wizengamot.” Draco sighed. “I’m perfect fodder for the tabloids. Not that they ever report on my successes in court.”
“Nothing. Absolutely nothing at all.” Harry replied, scooping eggs and sausages onto his own plate. “You are a product of your upbringing.”
“I don’t feel the need to read your mail.” He rolled his shoulders. “I thought you were helping me wash my back.”
Harry waited until he heard the click of the bedroom door. He dunked his head again to wash out the soap and then exited the tub. He dried himself quickly and pulled on one of Draco’s t-shirts and and a clean pair of boxers he had laid out earlier. Grabbing the towel and drying his hair, he made his way to the living room. Pansy was pacing, twisting one of the many rings on her finger.
“Well, if you need it, it’s available to you.” Draco replied, leaning against the door. “Are you sure you’re alright? I know I was a bit… over enthusiastic… last night.”
“No, but it was your’s the carried the most weight, Order of Merlin-First Class.” He tucked a dad lock of hair behind Harry’s ear. “I’m forever grateful, you know. I get to be the man I am today because of you. I got to be absolutely wrecked in a pub and stumble into marriage with you. A surprisingly wonderful marriage to a very handsome wizard.”
Harry nodded and tried to lift himself of the floor. He slipped and collapsed forward into Draco’s arms. “Why a-am I so w-weak?”
“Sorry does not even begin to cut it, Draco.” He replied. “I am trying to pull this family out of the black hole that your father decided to put us in and you make a move that sucks us back even further!”
“Yes, yes…” Pansy capitulated. “Anyway, your beautiful bride has been linked to exactly four people. Ginevra Weasley, which the entirety of the Wizarding World knows how that ended.”
Quentin glanced between Harry and Draco. “Then you and Mister Potter are bonded, as well as married?”
“Harry James Potter, you are a terrible liar. I am well aware that yesterday was Valentine’s Day. You didn’t owl, fire-call, or stop at the house.” Hermione narrowed her eyes. “How drunk did you get?”
“Of course, Narcissa.” Harry replied. “Then you will call me Harry, I am your son’s husband after all.”
“Oh, shut it!” Harry tossed a pillow from the bed towards the bathroom. “You’ve enjoyed the perks of having a house-husband. Besides, my role isn’t deeply involved in the day-to-day operations. It’s better that way. People can actually get things done. I show up and the volunteers lose their minds.”
Ron saluted as he follow Quentin out of the door. Draco pressed it close, hoping to feel finality of his portion of the situation. Harry stared at him from the sofa, his green eyes tinged with worry. Draco slumped away from the front door, back to the living room. He flopped down, laying his head in Harry’s lap.
Draco watched as Harry made his way towards the dance floor. He watched as the brunette gyrated to the beat. Harry crooked a finger at the blonde, wiggling his hips. He watched as the brunette rolled his body to the beat. Running his tongue along his top lip, he moved his body in the same pattern as Harry’s. They moved together, Draco wrapping his arms around Harry’s lithe body, pressing their foreheads together. They sway to the thudding beat, bodies undulating against one another. Draco smirked, bringing his hand to rest on Harry’s cheek. The brunette tipped his head up, nipping at Draco’s lips.
“I may have dug a little bit into your background after you said you wanted to remain married.” He slid down on the sofa. “I mean, is it wrong of me to want to know a little more about you?”
“Well, I’m proud of you, being responsible for once.” Hermione placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Are you sure okay?”
Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Harry, you know, it’s not my intention to treat you this way.”
“The financial reports are missing.” Harry replied flipping through the files once again. “Expenditures, spending approvals, grant submissions; they’re all missing. They’ve been missing for a while now.”
“No, no…” Harry examined Draco’s hand. “It’s just… I just want to forget about it. It didn’t feel like he was doing anything wrong. I didn’t think anything was wrong. Hermione says it has to do with a common response to the situation.” He twisted the silver band on the blonde’s finger. “I just expected this to be like before. I thought you two were so alike—”
“But, you are quite official according to the Ministry.” Poppy stood, coming out from behind the desk. “What with having an Order of Merlin, and all. I don’t think I can get in trouble if I make an exception just this once.”
“I like it when you’re honest.” He rolled his hips, pushing Harry’s shirt up farther. There was a sharp knock at the door. “Apparently, I’m just not suppose to have you at all today.”
The blonde set about to readying himself for bed as quickly and quietly as possible. Harry moaned, brows furrowing. Draco frowned, taking in the fact that the dark-haired wizard was having yet another nightmare. He slid under the duvet next him and Harry twinged again, this time a breathy ‘
“Just making sure that the protection we invoked last night wasn’t one-sided.” Draco touched the matching mark over Harry’s heart. It was the opposite of him, the triangle around the ouroboros dragon. “It looks like it was.”
"Mum says it's the best way." Ron replied, munching on a biscuit. "You tend to have healthier babies if you don't know."
.” Harry closed the book matter-of-factly. “Except I remember that my drink was shimmery. The bartender told me that there was Goldschläger in it and that’s what made it shimmery.”
“Uh-uh, no.” Draco pressed Harry’s hand to his chest. “You don’t get to be sad about this. I saw a version of your dead body today.”
“Thank you, sir.” Draco’s mouth dropped open as a smirk crept across Harry’s face. “Your boss is a secret pervert.”
“You are my husband, I am allowed to buy you things. Nice things that you’ll look very handsome in.” Draco said haughtily. “Just like you’re allowed to sleep in my bed.”
“I run a foundation and I’m independently wealthy.” Harry smiled. “I don’t necessarily ‘do work’ as you eloquently described.”
“Again, you look fine.” He stared down at his pocket watch. “Stop fussing, our Portkey activates in two minutes.” Draco pulled Harry close, producing a silver spoon. “Remember, we are disgustingly in love.”
“First up is a lovely Muggle named Hals Stewart. Potter’s first foray into dating someone of the same sex. Harmless and mind-numbingly boring.” Draco could practically hear Pansy roll her eyes. “Then Justin Finch-Fletchley. Again, harmless. Just a simple fling that maybe lasted six weeks. The last, before you, is by far the most interesting. He and Harry were together for almost two years before they called it quits. A Mister Reid N. Praetor, ultra-successful Gringotts investment banker. If I wasn’t positive that you were an only child, I would’ve said he was your illegitimate brother.”
“Then there should be no issue with this marriage. Remember who I am, Lord Malfoy.” Harry lifted his chin. “I am Harry James Potter, Order of Merlin; First Class. Destroyer of the Dark Lord. I believe my social and financial standings make me a worthy candidate for your grandson.” Harry lifted his chin slightly. “And I love him. As unorthodox as we may be, I care a great deal for Draco. I have for a long time.”
Harry molded his body to Draco’s. “But you don’t have be in first thing. Cristler said you could come in late.” He rolled his hips. “Come on, live a little,
Hello! I know it has been a hot minute since I've updated this wonderful piece of work (almost two years, but like, don't fight me). I haven't abandoned it! I spent the last month that working and re-working this thing until I was finally happy with it. Camp NANOWRIMO had it's ups and downs, but we did it. I think there's actually an end in sight for this thing. I've also jumped on the Scrivener train, which honestly, has made planning out plotlines much easier and I can keep everything in a nice little project binder.
Tables discreetly crept their way from the middle of the garden, leaving a bare space in between. Draco led Harry to the middle of makeshift dance floor and the fairy lights dimmed slightly. Malfoy pulled the dark-haired wizard close. The dulcet tones of a guitar filled the air and the two began to sway to it gently.
“The last time you said it was nothing, it turned out to be a something. A big something.” Hermione’s expression softened. “Are you sure he’s not—”
Draco smirked, continuing to thrust sharply into Harry. His hand curled tightly around Harry’s left hip. Vulgar epithets fell like rain from Harry’s mouth, demanding Draco drive harder, to go deeper. The blonde dutifully obliged, letting go of Harry’s hip to curl it underneath his shoulder. He snapped his hips, driving himself deeper in Harry. Draco set a punishing pace, forcing the brunette to brace himself against the headboard.
“Yeah… The Aurors will need them for evidence.” Draco heaved his body from the sofa. “Thank you, Pansy.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You expect to just walk into the Hall of Records and ask for what you want?”
“Why does that not surprise me…” Harry muttered. “I suppose you’re going to tell me what she laces them with?”
“I’ll try not to be.” He pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple. Pansy and Blaise made a gagging noise. “Oh, stop it, he’s my husband. I’m allowed to be disgustingly romantic.”
Hermione shook her head. “No, they weren’t normal bruises. I only noticed them around his wrists, ankles, maybe a handprint mark on his hips. It wasn’t until I saw a band bruise around his neck, that I finally voiced my concern.Told him that he shouldn’t stay in a relationship that makes him feel uncomfortable. I helped him leave. I wrote the note. The cottage he owns now once belonged to my parents.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Then sincerely disliked…” She watched as Harry reached up, noticing the large bruise on his hip. “Harry… That bruise…”
“I would like you to stay.” He curled his hand around Harry’s. “But I will understand if you don’t want to hear any of this.”
“Because they’re a reminder of how idiotic I was believing in the Dark Lord.” He touched the center of his chest. “
“It’s nothing special, just Chinese takeaway.” He plopped down in the seat opposite Draco’s desk. “And, well… I just haven’t seen you in a while.”
Draco nodded. “Oh yes. It makes me just want to…” He licked a stripe up Harry’s stomach. “Eat you up.”
“Thank you for being on time.” She placed a plain laurel wreath atop Draco’s head. “The natives are already restless.”
“If you’re sure…” Draco looked skeptical. “I think I should take Lupin’s advice and make you some toast.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You can dismiss my upbringing, but I was well cared for. You would have been brought up in a similar fashion had your parents survived.”
A small blush crept across Draco's pale cheeks. "While I appreciate your opinion, Marc, I can finish my own work. On time. Good day, Marc."
“I see.” Quentin tapped the pen against his lips. “So, you, HSW Cristler, and DHS Mogin headed from the elevators back to your respective offices. Are they near one another?”
Draco and Harry walked briskly up the garden drive to the Malfoy Manor. They were dangerously on the edge of being late to meet with the caterers and Harry could feel the waves of uneasy rolling off Draco as the blonde tugged him towards the main house. They practically sprinted to the dining hall, where Narcissa sat waiting.
Top of his class at the London Institute of Banking and Finance, a Muggle university. Finished in the top five of the Dumbledore’s Army Triathlon. Draco raised an eyebrow, Mister Reid N. Praetor was Chief Financial Officer of the Lilly Foundation. The smug bastard had his fingers in Harry’s foundation. He closed the folder and tucked it back in the top drawer, warding it close. He didn’t need the Gryffindor finding out he had dug up information on his past. Turning back to the files on desk, he set about working through his open cases.
“I have a trust fund.” Draco quipped. “From my mother’s estate. We can talk about this later, Harry.”
Harry and Draco landed soundly in the middle of Draco’s living room. Harry stumble slightly as he made his way down the hallway to his bedroom. He placed his hand on the wall to steady himself.
Biting his lip, Draco slid closer to Harry. The smaller wizard turned into him, curling a thin hand into Draco’s t-shirt. Draco wrapped his arm around him loosely and watched as a Harry relaxed into the embrace. He sighed, finally coming to terms with the fact that he was most definitely falling in love with Harry James Potter.
Harry heard the sharp pop of Apparition, signaling Draco had left for the office. He slumped against shower wall, hiccoughing and wrapping his arms around his knees. He stared down at himself, assessing the damage from last night. Deep bruises forming on his legs and hip. His head thudded against the bathroom wall. He should be upset, but he had asked for Draco to take him roughly. He sighed, standing slowly and washing his body robotically. Exiting the shower, he wrapped his body with the plush towel and collapsed onto his bed.
Furey nodded slightly. “We’ll also act as your drivers, so it would be best for you not to Apparate or use the Floo Network other than for Fire-Calls until we have a clearer picture of the situation.”
Ron smiled sadly, but nodded, pulling the door to the flat shut behind himself. Draco pressed his hand to the door, sealing the wards.
Harry had touched so lovingly the night before. Perhaps he shouldn’t hide them. Then he noticed it, over his heart, faint and silvery rather unlike the angry pink scars that decorated his chest. An ouroboros dragon around a triangle. He smiled, walking into the ensuite bathroom. He watched as Harry stood behind the tinted glass of the shower, humming softly, hands massaging shampoo into his hair.
Harry watched as Draco walked towards the Apparition points from the Ministry. He groaned, of course Draco would take the easy way out and force Harry to the Floo exits. He hated the Floo. Sighing, he began to trudge his way toward the Floo area when someone touched his shoulder.
Draco shook it. “It’s a—perhaps under different circumstances, I would say it’s a pleasure to meet you Mister Linley.”
“Are you sure? I have bruise cream in my medicine cabinet.” Draco replied, swirling the curry into the rice in his plate.
Draco stood, pulling the brunette up with him. Harry faltered, his inebriated state making him unsteady on his feet as he made his way down the hallway. He stumbled backward into the wall, tugging Draco with him. He snickered, curling his arms around the blonde’s neck, carding his fingers into his hair. Harry molded his body to Draco’s, grinding his hips. Draco growled, lifting Harry so that his legs came around his waist.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I very much doubt my husband uses Dark Magic to send me a note that he’s going to be late.”
Draco was quiet. "What I want... I want you in a red and gold corset and tutu, with matching thigh-high stockings with bows on them. A crown a top your head, ribbon around your neck, and an expression on your face akin to that of a wanton slut." He brushed his lips across Harry's cheek. "That is what I want for Christmas."
“He’s not. All he’s doing is giving you the time to deal with what happened.” Harry pushed the plate over, scooting himself closer to Draco. “We learned at a very young age to take the bad things that happen to us and put them in a box and shove the box into a dark place where we don’t deal with it. War can do that to children. It makes us very fucked up adults.” Draco snorted. “But we bring people into our lives that hopefully will let us cope with our scary boxes. People to lean on. Significant others, for example.”
