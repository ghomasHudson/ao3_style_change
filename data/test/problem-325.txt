That made Brooks pause. He had probably thought Harry would go along with whatever they wanted to do in the interests of not getting bad publicity in the papers, and that meant they could bully him into coming back to the Ministry. But now he was on the spot and had to make a decision.
Harry glanced up and found Parkinson facing him, heedless of the gaping observers still passing them. Her hands had taken both of his, and she was staring into his face with a direct, human stare he hadn’t known she was capable of. He tried, embarrassed, to take his hands away, but she held on to them. Isabella had disappeared behind what was probably another Disillusionment Charm.
“No. You’ve been mostly polite, and it sounds like you’re a good, kind teacher to James and so are the other people who are educating them. That’s all I can ask for.”
Draco was still surprised that Potter had got, and retained, sole custody of his son. The Weasleys were too rabid about their children to permit such a thing, normally. But it almost certainly had something to do with the boy’s Parseltongue.
.” Potter whirled around and paced in a circle, coming back to him with one hand raised. Draco instinctively moved a step away, then realized Potter had done it to keep Sela in place on his shoulder, rather than fend Draco off. “They can hammer on me all they want. They can hate me all they want. But they’re not going after James.”
Ron’s stare grew more penetrating, and he glanced once at Hermione, who was still cooing over Sapphire and James, then turned back to Harry. “I
Harry thought she might leave once she understood that she wouldn’t get anything but clipped responses out of him, but instead, her smile tilted towards amused. “I just wanted you to know. Especially since your basket can be stolen, hovering behind you like that, and you wouldn’t know until long after it was gone. Whereas the snake basket won’t be stolen because—”
People already know more about my connection with Voldemort than I’m comfortable with.” Harry hid his reaction at Malfoy’s flinch at the name.
In seconds, he saw the way it should go. It had been pouring in a smooth circle, with Malfoy as the beginning and end of the ring. Harry caught his eyes, which were blown wide with what might be pain or surprise, and tossed the cord of magic to him.
“That’s not what I meant. I mean that you want to change hearts and minds, that you’re going to go out there and
Draco stroked her hood to let her know that he’d heard. Yes, Potter’s Parseltongue did sound different from most voices he’d heard, including his own, his son’s, and his father’s. He sounded as if he became an animal when he spoke it. But now wasn’t the time to get into that. “
Dust shook into the air as the papers hurtled towards them. Draco stepped neatly aside and let them stack themselves on the only table in this section of the Archives, which had a chair in front of it. When the flights had stopped, he sat down and sorted through them slowly.
the magic? Not even Draco could do that, and he was the most experienced Parselmouth in the circle, since the gift seemed related to the length of time that someone had borne the Dark Mark.
Harry nodded, keeping his face quiet and neutral. It was difficult. When he looked at Goyle, he remembered Crabbe burning to death in the Room of Requirement. With Parkinson, he could remember her voice demanding that he be thrown to Voldemort.
Harry glanced over his shoulder, and whatever was in his eyes made Malfoy falter and fall silent, and Malfoy’s cobra rear up and hiss.
“I’m not—” Potter closed his eyes and clenched down on what seemed to be his emotions, or maybe just his tongue. Sela hissed softly at him, the kind of soothing nonsense noise that Draco heard often from Charlie when Scorpius was going to sleep. Potter didn’t respond to her, but opened his eyes a second later and said, “I’m not frightened. I just think that I’ve taken enough of your time.”
the one with the right to make decisions about my son,” he said. “Since Ginny’s—not here.” He’d wanted to say “gave up all responsibility,” but that wouldn’t be fair.
He had brought in Greg and Pansy because their magic was of the sort that would balance the circle. Greg, as one of the few Parselmouths who had a constrictor instead of a venomous snake as a Match, would provide the gentle intent of this ritual. Pansy would add the womanly energy that would somewhat substitute for James’s missing mother. Scorpius would be there because he was friendly to James and near the same age. Draco, as leader of the ritual, would do the actual Calling.
Draco watched Potter and his son go, and tried not to show how shaken he was, although from the way Edwina coiled closer to him, she could sense it. Scorpius and Charlie were giving him thoughtful glances, too.
“I askded for help, and they came and didded it!” James said. He still had trouble with English words sometimes. He waved his hand around. “
James hissed softly to Sapphire, and received a response that was conveyed more in the coiling of his body than Parseltongue, because Harry couldn’t hear anything, but James nodded proudly.
She said “campaigning” like it was a dirty word, and even though it was almost a year later before they divorced, Draco knew then that his marriage was over.
Harry thought of how to phrase it, turning it around in his head, and finally said, “They have a right to say it.”
“Buying supplies for the school?” Harry asked as he slowed down to match Malfoy’s pace. James and Scorpius were already lagging behind, chattering away to each other in Parseltongue. Harry maneuvered to get the boys in front of him, and wanted to snort when he realized that Malfoy was doing the same thing at the same time, like a coordinated dance partner.
“This is what I have to do for James,” Harry said absently as he eyed the small dots that had appeared at the end of the white stone path leading to the school. Those would be reporters, probably, or maybe people who had heard about this and come as spectators. “I wouldn’t expect you to understand.”
Harry made polite noises, while his eyes went back to his son. Hermione was sitting on the floor while Sapphire crawled into her lap, and laughing, her eyes bright.
Harry dragged his hand across his face and decided to put it in terms that Parkinson could understand, since obviously speaking about the harm to innocents wouldn’t move her. “Has it occurred to you that I still have to do my
Hermione relaxed so much she practically collapsed onto the Gryffindor-red couch in front of the fireplace. Harry shook his head fondly at her. Yes, it took a lot of self-control and practice, but he
Harry had to turn his head and stare in the other direction, at one of the small courtyards with food stalls where he went to buy vegetables. He shuddered and shook his head and finally murmured, “Well. Anyway. I need to be getting on.”
“My Parseltongue has caused enough damage,” Harry said, and then regretted it when he saw how Parkinson recoiled. He shut his eyes and tried out the breathing exercises he’d looked up for himself after he learned that going to Mind-Healers was futile. He breathed a few times to the count of ten, and then said, “I don’t want to pursue the magic the way that you and Malfoy and the rest do.”
But thinking about it just made him feel pathetic, so he turned back to Malfoy in time to see him nod. “Some people who didn’t admit before this that their children could be Parselmouths are contacting me now.”
“I understand now why you want nothing to do with your Parseltongue.” Malfoy was scrutinizing him in a way that reminded Harry absurdly of Hermione. “And I wanted to let you know that if you became part of my Order, I would never betray your secrets like that.”
“Oh, please,” Parkinson said, her voice heavy with contempt. “As if I would tax my dear Isabella by using a Transfiguration on you.”
She cut herself off as Malfoy and his son came down the stairs. They were both carrying their snakes, and Harry looked a little off to the side to conceal his own negative reaction. That was when he caught sight of the small krait coiled around Parkinson’s neck and the large python crawling along to catch up to Goyle.
Dark Arts, man?” Auror Brooks finally snapped, gesturing at the place Moonborn had been. There were still a few dark flakes of what had been her arm wisping around the street, but other Aurors with better sense than these two had removed her to a holding cell in the Ministry. “You
Parkinson shrieked next, her eyes wide, the krait on her shoulder opening its mouth as if to echo her, and then Goyle wobbled in place. Scorpius made a wounded sound, and James—
“Well, you’re in the wrong part of the Archives for that, first of all, Mr. Malfoy! Come with me, and we’ll make sure that you’re set on the right path.”
“It simply gets them more attuned to feeling their ritual magic. It isn’t as potent a shape as the circle.” Draco motioned with his head, and Potter reluctantly followed him back towards the other side of the classroom, a large room with grey walls and a blue floor. The combination of colors, like the pentagram, was one that got young Parselmouths used to feeling the flow of their magic. “What’s wrong?”
“Someone who wants to have children who don’t speak Parseltongue! Someone who’s going to divorce you because it’s clear that you can’t!”
“I think I have a good idea,” Potter said softly, and then flipped the hood back from the woman’s head with a push of his wand tip. Draco stared at the face that was revealed. She looked shaggy and old. He didn’t know he’d had any enemies that looked like that.
“Maybe,” Harry said, which was a good enough promise with as sleepy as James was. He yawned once more, gave a huge stretch, and went to sleep so fast that Harry could only stare.
“I never intend to follow the same path that the Dark Lord did. How many times do I need to tell you that?”
“All right,” Draco said. “That is, of course, your decision. I will say that I have seen ritual magic help other Parselmouths sleep better and release some of the tension that boils up in them on a regular basis. But there are other ways to do that, and probably talking to your friends is one of them.”
Harry shook his head and lay back in the bed, staring at the ceiling. He’d had a Floo call from Ron and Hermione that morning, inviting him and James to dinner tomorrow—today, now. He’d go, and he’d talk to them, and he’d try to shed some of his burdens that he was carrying in regards to them.
Now, Draco watched Harry Potter and his son walk towards him across the patterned floor of the great ballroom, and wondered that he had managed to come this far. Astoria would either have laughed or outright refused to believe it.
Potter turned to face him, hostile magic rising up around him like steam. He ignored Edwina’s hissed warning and the way both children shrank away from him. “There was a snake who wanted to Match with me, or some other absurd name,” he said, voice clipped. “She came into the house without permission and into my son’s bedroom, specifically. I put her outside. I didn’t hurt her, and I didn’t bond with her. She’s not
Draco glanced in the direction of Moonborn and Potter. Potter met his gaze, all the hatred and rage he had shown already concealed behind the opaque surface of his face again. He nodded, as though in response to Draco’s silent question, and then turned away and cast a familiar stag Patronus.
But from the haunted way Jamie stared up at him now, Harry was cursing himself for waiting so long. He knelt next to Jamie beside the front door and ran his hand gently through his son’s hair.
Draco sighed and reached down to tickle his fingers against the hood of the young king cobra whom he had called to him not long after his Parselmouth powers began to grow. She had said she was named Edwina, and Draco found too much joy in her companionship to change her name. “
“I ensured that whenever you go around spreading ugly rumors and lies you don’t even believe in yourself, that you’ll be subject to a phantom snakebite,” Parkinson said, and laughed at the expression on the man’s face. Harry wished he could. The coldness surging through him prevented it. “Don’t worry, it won’t poison you. It’ll simply hurt, until you retract the lie.”
Parkinson gave him a sharp glance before she left, and Goyle might have done the same thing if he was capable of it. Harry stretched his arms and waited until Malfoy escorted James out of the circle. Scorpius immediately bounced up to James and started chattering away, comparing their snakes.
Malfoy’s outstretched hand couldn’t be slapped away. He wasn’t doing this for James, or because Harry was his old friend, or because they were in-laws. In fact, Harry was pretty sure that Malfoy would argue it would be the best thing for James if Sela stayed with Harry and their family. He was doing it because he wanted to help
And there was one avenue of appeal open to him, as little as Draco liked to think about it. Potter should want this gift for
Potter stood still, his arms at his sides, except that he turned his head a little to follow the flows of magic with his eyes. Draco blinked and nearly dropped the strand that was unfolding in his mind. That was more participation than he’d expected.
“Oh, really? When it’s simply a curse to increase your virtue?” Parkinson smiled at him and twitched her fingers, a cue that the snake apparently picked up. Isabella wove her neck into a complicated knot, which Harry realized, abruptly, resembled a rune. Parkinson touched it with her left hand and flung her right hand at Harry’s interrogator.
!” Scorpius reached into the terrarium, towards the small ball of green scales that marked Charlie’s curled, sleeping form.
“It means that you and Draco have magic much closer to each other than most Parselmouths do. I don’t think he’s realized it yet. He’s probably still thinking about other things than the ritual, like the daily business of the school. Just like some Parselmouths Match with snakes and others bond with them, some Parselmouths Match with each other. We’re seeing that now that we’re asking Parselmouths in countries where they were never so scorned.”
“Hi,” the boy, James if Draco remembered correctly, said before Potter could say anything. “Are you that git Malfoy?”
Harry turned and began to walk away, but Malfoy called after him, “Haven’t you considered that your experiences with Parseltongue aren’t any more traumatic than mine are? I was Marked by
Harry raised a hand to touch Sela’s back. He didn’t entirely trust her yet, but at least he might make her quiet down. And it seemed to work. She said nothing further, only darted her tongue out again to touch his hand.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “And my parents were murdered by a Parselmouth. Because of that, I had to spend ten years with Muggles that the whole wizarding world knows now were abusive, I had to kill a giant basilisk in our second year and a man possessed by Voldemort in our first, I had to put up with opinion swinging back and forth on me constantly and people thinking I was mad and evil and dangerous, my godfather was innocent and then I lost him, I was used as a
“The girl came over to James. She told him that he was supposed to be a hero, because of his last name. And that he shouldn’t be talking to snakes. That might have been a factor in her mother’s decision not to enroll her at the school.”
Harry shrugged, cast a Netting Charm that he usually used on some of the pixies and fairies who tried to get into the house since it resonated with James’s magic, and carried the snake in the transparent bag that had surrounded her to the window. She hissed at him in agitation, but Harry forced himself to essentially unfocus his hearing and not listen, the way he might prevent himself from reading a book. He’d learned to do it when he was trying to make sure James learned English, too.
Ron, watching from the other side of the dining room, winced a little as Hermione extended her hand to Sela and let Sela’s tongue touch her fingers, but at least he wasn’t upset or trying to interfere. Harry smiled at him, winked with a casualness he didn’t feel, and glanced at James and Sapphire. James stepped forwards and said, “
Harry shook his head. “I’m glad that you seem to be benevolent,” he said. “But I don’t want to bond with a snake.”
Harry listened calmly to a long description of the game. James was still only four. And then Jamie hesitated, and Harry was sure they were getting to the real problem. He rubbed his hand up and down James’s back again.
Another thing that was different between them, and the only one that Harry envied. He went back to his room and sipped carefully at Dreamless Sleep. He was always careful with it, given how addictive it was.
his attention, but it couldn’t have it. Harry looked back to the circle and concentrated on keeping his magic flat like a floor to support James’s leaping flame.
The articles were filled with details about Potter casting the Unforgivables during the war, his childhood with the Muggles where apparently his cousin had chased him and bullied him and his aunt and uncle had called him a freak, his Parseltongue, and his confrontation with the basilisk at the end of his second year in school. Bandler said gravely that “Parselmouths are dangerous” and that he “wouldn’t be surprised if it turned out that Potter is an unwitting weapon of You-Know-Who.”
“But it ate away her flesh,” muttered the other Auror, a trainee young enough that Harry hadn’t known her as a full-fledged Auror before he retired. He gave her a mild glance, and she flinched in turn, but squared her shoulders and met his eyes with her own dark brown ones, which at least made her braver than Brooks.
Harry crossed over to his son and crouched on the brick rim of the sunken area. James grinned at him. “I’m doing it, Daddy!”
Malfoy nodded. His voice when he spoke next sounded as though he was trying to urge the words past a loose tooth. “Are you—it’s really been that long since someone did something specifically for you?”
“I’ll tell you something else that not even Draco knows,” Parkinson said. “I was in that ritual circle, and I know that you shouldn’t have been able to pick up the current of power like you did. Not when Draco started it.”
Harry felt the wariness trying to stiffen all his muscles, but he only nodded and turned to James. “Why don’t you and Sapphire play with Scorpius and Charlie for a little while?” he suggested.
Draco thought, and opened his eyes as the first call boomed out of him, to see how Potter was taking this.
Draco watched in silence as Potter spun a masterful story, keeping every eye locked on him and his audience spellbound. He told them what they wanted to hear, flavored with just a few personal touches here and there, and told them nothing about his son and nothing that would make the school vulnerable to intruders. It was praise of the kind Draco could only have dreamed of, given the reputation of most of Parselmouths as former Death Eaters and their children being too young to make good interview subjects.
Power like water poured past him, and he found himself tensing his shoulders and shaking his head against it, without meaning to. The flows alternated between blue and black, water in the daytime and water at night, and there was a soft voice that flowed along with them, speaking words now in Parseltongue, now in English, seducing his attention.
Harry just nodded. By now, he had given up on hoping that a non-dangerous snake would choose James. Although it would have been nice to have a little grass snake or something like that.
” Draco hissed to soothe her, and then went back to considering Potter. His face had frozen in the kind of mask Draco had worn himself when he didn’t know what was happening and which way he should react. “In the meantime, Potter, I can take care of her.” He held out his arm.
“She just wants to work with someone who was in Gryffindor House,” Potter interrupted. Draco fumed, but held his peace. “There must be someone else who was. Or who would find the honor of working with a Gryffindor snake greater than they—who would find it an honor.”
Then again, he wasn’t old enough to hear about why his mother had wanted to leave, anyway. Harry kissed James on the forehead, and then tickled him a little until James was giggling and yawning.
Sela hissed a meaningless sound, but then turned her head, flicking her tongue, as the door of the school opened behind Harry. All of Harry’s muscles tensed, but it was Malfoy who came out and stood beside him, not James, as he had been afraid of.
“She’s fine. It’s fine.” His eyes were on James and Scorpius, who were playing with the little Flint girl Julia in the middle of a pentagram on the floor of the classroom. The pentagram was only chalk, but Potter was watching it as if he expected it to explode. “Should they be in a shape like that so young?”
“Then I’ll work on becoming more comfortable with that. But part of the answer is just that parents and children
always put everything relating to Potter on the front page, so Draco had only to glance and move on if a particular edition didn’t have anything.
“Sure,” Harry said, feeling as though someone had fed him a Calming Draught. No one except Ron and Hermione had taken his refusal to talk about something this well in years. “I’ll donate as much money as you like.”
Now,” Draco continued in English, since it was important for Scorpius to get practice with both languages, “why don’t you go to your bedroom and have Kala help you dress?”
It wasn’t often that Draco felt he had no idea what someone was talking about, but he felt like that now. “Enough of my time,” he repeated blankly. Edwina raised her head and turned from where she had been watching the children to study Potter, her tail flicking so that it tapped the back of Draco’s wrist.
embrace your Parseltongue. Your snake, wherever she is. Do you understand how powerfully we can cast together if you do this?”
“You have no idea what you’re rejecting,” Parkinson said, her eyes hard. “Not just the ability to participate in ritual circles like the one we did the other day—”
the class, when he would come to retrieve James, but that didn’t matter much. Draco still had to speak to him.
Draco jerked his head violently to the side, and Potter followed him to the right, far enough away from their children that Draco was fairly sure they wouldn’t hear, although Potter did still keep looking over his shoulder. Draco claimed his attention with another sharp jerk of his head. “
“Edwina told me not long after we first met that you smelled of pain,” Draco said. “I’m sure your Sela has said the same thing. Is there anything I can do to ease that pain? I thought maybe giving James access to Parselmouth classes would help, but it doesn’t seem to have.”
That sounded like a threat, but Harry forced himself not to take it that way. He simply lay there, and eventually, Sela went back to sleep, and let Harry wander in his head, in silence, turning pieces of the past over and over in his head like wheels.
Potter hated himself didn’t matter that much. He would pay the money, and his son would receive the education that he needed, and Draco’s Order of Serpents would be more accepted in the future because of his association with the “Savior” and his son.
“Can you talk to it, James?” Harry was casting a few charms as he spoke, ones that would pick up on the ill intent of the snake if it had been conjured to bite his son. Nothing came back except the charm that clarified the snake
“A lot of spells could do that, Dark Arts or not,” Harry said blandly. “The Lye Soap Hex could do that, if you put enough power behind it.”
Draco didn’t know the dark red spell that soared away from Potter’s wand and crashed into the other wizard, but he didn’t know that he had to. The intent behind the spell was perfectly clear. The flesh on the other wizard’s wand hand
“Why would you assume that your presence would be more of a deterrent than an attraction?” Draco asked then. He half-hoped that having two questions to answer at once would make Potter drop a few more hints about the inside of his skull.
But Draco, with the curiosity that had driven him deep into Parseltongue and its mysteries, found that he did want to know. And, well, he had uncovered more than anyone else in the last hundred years. Who was to say that he couldn’t learn Potter’s secrets, too, even if Potter tried to keep them buried?
” James said, apparently deciding that he could get over his shyness about speaking in front of a snake.
Harry shrugged. “It didn’t sound that way. If only because you couldn’t be sure I’d do either of those things. And I still don’t really want to practice ritual magic with the rest of you.”
Harry tensed despite himself, and noticed Hermione noticing it. He exhaled hard and looked in the other direction. “I appreciate his concern, but
Harry just grunted and didn’t say anything else to Sapphire, instead conjuring the floating bag, then conjuring water to fill it. Sapphire coiled his body before Harry could offer to Levitate him and floated from the tank to the bag under what had to be the push of his own magic. Harry blinked a little, then shook his head as he settled James with a charm so he’d be less likely to roll over on Sapphire no matter how much he tossed.
Harry stood back with his hands in his robe pockets and watched Ginny throw robes and books and hairbrushes and Quidditch equipment haphazardly into her trunk. He knew he should speak up, say something, convince her not to leave him. If nothing else, she had a duty to James.
“So tomorrow,” Harry said aloud, even though James was occupied with his pillow and wouldn’t understand him even if he was, “we have to go talk to that git Malfoy.”
Astoria’s shoulders slumped for a moment, which made Draco wonder what she had hoped he would say. That it wasn’t potential? That neither he nor Scorpius had any interest in Parseltongue? Well, that would simply be wrong. Scorpius had been babbling in Parseltongue from the time he was nine months old, and it had been one of the best days of Draco’s life when he realized he could understand snakes.
Harry sneered a little. “Need to rely on your snake to tell you that, Malfoy? When you went to the trouble of looking up all the details in the papers?”
it when someone revealed that he was vulnerable like that. And luckily enough, the people on the street couldn’t understand Sela, but Parkinson certainly could.
Draco hesitated, then sighed. He still thought Potter was an idiot for rejecting a gift as mighty as this one, but it was true that they’d accomplish nothing with him resisting every step of the way. “
And wasn’t that what really mattered? Being a good father for James? He would be a better one if he wasn’t in pain all the time.
?” Parkinson asked. She didn’t wait for an answer before she turned back to Malfoy. “I don’t know if I can be in a calling circle with him. His stupidity might taint my magic.”
it,” Ginny repeated, throwing a decorative robe into the trunk with enough force that it caught on a splinter in the wood and tore. With a huff, Ginny Levitated it into the air and threw it with her wand. This time, it sank into the interior of the trunk like a snowball into a field of snow. “To know that my son has Parseltongue because of
“I’ll find someone else for Sela if you want me to,” Draco said calmly, and tried to avoid sounding like he was speaking to one of the children. Potter’s wide eyes had already narrowed in suspicion. He would strike out if he thought Draco was being condescending, or probably just refuse to listen. “I would prefer not to, of course. She’s established a bond with you, and that means there’s something in you that she finds valuable—”
Sela squeezed his arm where she was loosely looped. Harry took a deep breath and slowly released his anger. Sela was right. He had to hold back, because his anger might frighten his son.
” Scorpius said, with the kind of smile that Draco knew meant his son was already planning to be lifelong friends with Potter’s. Someone who admired his snake always had a passport to his good will. “
Auror Brooks’s eyes widened, as if he hadn’t expected Harry to admit that. Then he gave a braying laugh. “So when we charge you for not following the Auror Code of Conduct—”
Draco studied him, and decided, reluctantly, that that was probably true. He could wish Potter would do things for other reasons, but for right now, that his defense of his son would be sturdy was for the best. Draco didn’t have to worry about defending Jamie. Instead, he would concentrate on his son, the school, and the other students.
But he had. And for all the disgusted looks the Aurors were giving him and the fact that they kept asking him the same questions again and again, trying to trap him into admitting that he’d used Dark Arts, he didn’t regret what he’d done. He had to make sure James was safe. Scorpius and Malfoy didn’t deserve to suffer, either.
The boy walking at his side, clinging to his leg, had unruly red hair and brilliant brown eyes when he shyly peered around his father at Draco, who stood with Edwina, Scorpius, and Charlie in the middle of the grand blue-and-white ballroom. Draco stifled disappointment he didn’t understand at the fact that the boy didn’t have green eyes. No reason he should inherit them.
more open than he wanted to be with Malfoy. What he’d done during the ritual to find Sapphire was one thing, because that had been to protect James, but he couldn’t see helping Malfoy become more powerful.
Draco did his best to drive all his tension down into his body, because right now it was affecting Edwina and she had begun to hiss in agitation. “
And the woman couldn’t cast anymore. She was staggering, most of her right arm gone, decayed and vanished. She sagged to her knees, her mouth open and her breath rasping up harshly from probably desiccated lungs. Potter walked slowly and deliberately towards her.
Harry turned back, wary. If Parkinson had children, he hadn’t met them yet. Then again, why should he have? He was only a Parselmouth who had once been an enemy, and who hadn’t yet agreed to become part of the ritual circle or the school or the whole
Hermione touched Sapphire behind the head and made a soft noise. Ron leaned towards Harry and muttered, “That snake looks venomous.”
Sapphire floated in the watery tank next to Jamie’s bed. Harry hesitated, glancing at him, and then spoke to his son’s snake directly, one of the few times he’d done so. “
The blond man who was staring at him looked vaguely familiar, but then, as Hermione would say, that was down to inbreeding in the British wizarding population. He shook his head and stepped backwards hastily, and then pointed one finger at Harry.
Draco gaped before he could stop himself. Then he studied him. “This is an extreme change of heart.”
Potter spun fully around to face him then, the tension uncoiling and spilling all at once, and the children fell silent in their play and their half-Parseltongue, half-English chatter. Potter sensed that and curbed the things he would have said (which made Draco blink in regret). Instead, he stepped nearer and lowered his voice.
Draco eyed him for a second, then snorted. “Yes, that’s why you look like you’re going to bolt from the room at any second.”
Harry halted and stared at him. Malfoy came to a halt and stared back, eyebrows rising a little. “Something wrong, Potter?”
Harry looked up from his pile of post. He still received way too much despite having been retired from the Aurors for two years. People wanted his autograph, or thought he would give them a perfect quote about their random product, or wanted to talk about the war, or, in case of the stupid letter in front of him that he was about to tear up, wanted to convince him to enroll James in a “Parselmouth School.”
James pouted and sighed, but Malfoy obviously wasn’t going to be moved. He looked down at the snake in his hands. “
Harry paused. Parkinson gave him a superior look that he tried to ignore. Sela continued reaching for him, twining along Parkinson’s arm to the furthest reach of her hand and leaning out. Harry tried to ignore the imploring way she looked at him. Snakes didn’t
“I don’t know what my final answer is going to be,” he decided on. “I think ritual magic could offer me a chance to protect James, but it seems intense.”
” Harry shifted to the side, intending to get up and walk to the bathroom, and received a nudge in the ribs from her head. Growling under his breath, he turned so that she could climb up and coil around his arm near his shoulder.
Harry arched an eyebrow, remembering a frantic young woman who had advocated for throwing him to Voldemort. “Fancy
“No, I just guessed what would put that expression on your face.” Harry sighed when Hermione looked as unhappy as she had the last time she heard about a mistreated house-elf. “Listen, Hermione, the main thing I hope is that the pregnancy goes well and the baby and Ginny are healthy and that someday James can have a good relationship with his half-sibling. That’s all.”
She did send the divorce papers in the morning. And Harry and James (more to the point) hadn’t seen her in the past two years.
No, probably not. But Harry was cowardly enough that he didn’t want to repeat it. It was going to be hard enough to explain it to James when he was old enough to understand it.
Ron had just come in through the door and was shedding his Auror robes. Harry leaned back to smile at him. “Hey. Have a good day chasing down villainous Dark wizards?”
He hadn’t remembered the exact weeks or days, only the months, but in the end, that didn’t matter, because the
Malfoy’s eyes widened a little. He sat there as if he didn’t know what to say. Then he murmured, “I’m surprised that you’re not accusing me of trying to manipulate you so that you would want to keep Sela and eventually join our ritual circles.”
Harry laughed, and then stopped when he saw how James had twisted around to stare at him. He tried not to bring the ugly, violent side of himself around his son. He faced Malfoy and shook his head. “And give them the chance to betray me
Malfoy’s arms were laden with baskets, and his pockets bulged. A small line of packages floated behind him as well. Harry wondered idly how many people in the Alley had noticed the subtle protective spells shimmering around the packages that kept them from being touched or bumped or tampered with. Harry himself had probably only noticed because he cast such spells on his own shopping all the time.
Harry knew the mood would pass. He knew he would get up in the morning and attempt to do the best he could for James. He knew that his and Ginny’s marriage probably wouldn’t have lasted given what had happened, and he knew that quitting his Auror job to be a father to James—to
“Here we are!” Parkinson finally said in a bright tone, and held out what looked like a clump of yellow yarn.
He sounded as if he was making a proclamation from on high, and his eyes were shining again. Draco wondered for a moment what it would be like to see them shine with something other than resignation or regret or guilt. Then he shook himself out of that. It was too tempting to follow that vision laid out like a path, and it also meant that he would end up dashing himself to pieces against the rock wall Potter had raised between himself and the world.
Draco shook his head. He supposed he shouldn’t have expected to get so quickly through walls thick enough to have withstood years of betrayal, but he was still…well. Frustrated.
Hell, James had only learned it himself a few months ago, or at least enough to understand what it really meant when Harry asked him to say that he was sorry for something.
Malfoy.” Potter’s voice hissed, but not in the good way. He turned his gaze on Draco, and Draco tensed. Edwina, coiled around his shoulders, at once lifted her head and flared her hood. “And you, a cobra, because of course you do. I wouldn’t have answered the letter if I’d known.”
Harry ignored her again. “Well, then I’m going to keep refusing Malfoy’s offers. Thanks but no thanks.”
Malfoy paused for a long moment. Harry looked longingly over his shoulder, almost wishing that James would have the kind of tantrum that he did when he went too long without a nap, but he was happily hissing away with Scorpius and their snakes.
Draco didn’t need to say anything to that. He was sure his face expressed the force of his skepticism. Potter glanced to the side and moved his fingers for a second as if he was clutching an invisible wand.
“But you had already called your Match. This isn’t the same as working with someone untrained, who can unbalance everything!”
in Voldemort’s resurrection ritual, I spent a year with the Ministry trying to crush me and carving words into my hand with a Blood Quill, I spent another year hunting down ways to destroy Voldemort and in the end walked to my
A dark-robed wizard was walking towards them, hood up to conceal his, or her, face. One hand rose, and the wand pointed steadily at Potter. Draco’s blood swam cold, and he grope for his own wand, even though he wasn’t sure he could get through that shield.
“Of course.” Harry shrugged. “But from tragedy can come a blessing, don’t you think? That’s certainly true enough in my own life.”
Harry bit back the stream of curses he wanted to unleash. Losing his temper was the cause of most of his past woes, at least the ones that Voldemort wasn’t directly responsible for. He’d lost his marriage with Ginny because of it, and he wouldn’t have driven Bandler to reveal all those facts about his past if Harry hadn’t screamed at the man for calling him a Dark wizard.
Harry shrugged and clawed the sheet away from him as he settled the glasses on his face. The dimness of his bedroom only lightened when he cast a
” he said, only speaking Parseltongue because if he spoke in English she would just pretend not to understand, and he would have to spend more time talking to her. “
And then Harry forced himself to snap out of his thoughts, and pay attention to his son, who was more important than he was.
“Potter,” Draco said quietly, drawing Potter’s attention as he knew he wouldn’t have with a snap or command. “Will you please tell me what’s wrong?”
And sure enough, there it was, beginning the third week of April. A picture of Potter flinching and trying to duck out of sight in an obscure corner of Diagon Alley, while the headline blared,
“We are here,” Malfoy began with a peculiar cadence Harry was instantly certain had something to do with the ritual, “to call a snake for James Sirius Potter. To find his Match if we can; to find a good snake for him to practice magic with if we cannot. He wishes to be a true Parselmouth, to stand among the Order. I chose you as the ones whose magic aligns most closely with mine.” He turned his head, and his eyes seared into Harry’s, even though Harry thought he should have been looking at James. “Harry Potter is here to lend his family magic to the calling circle and make things more familiar for his son.”
Potter snarled, a sound that made Draco feel for a moment as if he understood what other people felt when they heard Parseltongue, and struck to maim.
,” Ron said, and retreated backwards up the stairs, keeping a firm eye on Harry, as if he expected him to explode. The news about Ginny, Harry supposed.
Harry tried to leap forwards, but he was standing too far away, and behind Parkinson besides. The curse hit the man, and he shut his eyes and shouted, then started patting himself all over, as if he thought he was going to find another limb or head.
“I have to change hearts and minds to build the school system for Parselmouths and alter the beliefs about Parseltongue that so many people have, yes,” Draco said dryly. “I have to ask people for money. I have to find the other ones who have Parseltongue and encourage them not to be ashamed. I have to build a ritual circle so that we can practice the most powerful magic together. I’ve been talking about this for
“Um.” Hermione spent so much time staring at the tattered thread hanging from one of her ink-splattered sleeves that Harry took pity on her.
cleared his throat. “But you wanted to talk about the Parselmouth School, and why your son is attending?”
“Hell, no, Malfoy.” Sela shifted on Potter’s shoulder when he swore, while Edwina lifted her head from the loose coil she’d been collapsed in at Draco’s feet. “I want to
Harry relaxed a little. Yes, Malfoy’s fixation on power was annoying, but it really did defend him and James. “No one else had, either. Like I said, though, it became much easier to claim that I was Dark after that. Voldemort returned. Unhinged. Dangerous. All of that.”
,” the krait agreed, and raised her head to focus on the man, hissing loudly. They were drawing a crowd, and Harry glared at Parkinson, wondering what in the world she was thinking. This would hardly help better the reputation of Parselmouths, the way Malfoy was always harping about them needing to do.
“This doesn’t have to take too long.” Potter stared at him, and seemingly through him. He really did have amazing eyes, Draco thought. It was equally amazing that no one had snapped him up since Weasley had divorced him, dark rumors swirling around him or not. “James told me that a woman came here yesterday to talk about enrolling her daughter in the school.”
Well, fine. That would just mean she had a front-row seat to laugh from. She only taught at the school one day a week, so Harry didn’t have to worry too much about her negative opinion of him affecting James.
They were in the drawing room, a large room with a little sunken area in the middle of it that Harry could fill with balls or pillows for James, and had been the reason he’d bought the house. James was hovering a cushion in front of him now.
Parkinson seemed to be fumbling in her bag. Harry watched, his heart rate accelerating, ready to leap away if this turned out to be some kind of ambush. It was, but not the kind he’d thought.
Hermione sighed when Ron was out of sight. “He wants to discuss the Parselmouth school that you’re enrolling James in with you.”
your school. To say that I don’t care about my son being a Parselmouth. No, wait, more. That I’m proud of it. And that I’m trusting you to take care of him.”
” Draco said, because Potter’s stupid prejudice against snakes as much as his speaking in English was irritating him. “
” Harry watched his left hand close on the handle of a basket. “But there were also other people who apparently spent time around one of his safehouses or the like. Some of those less tangible connections…it’s hard to trace. I was hoping to consult with you about it.”
Scorpius and Charlie didn’t provide much more than a contained pool of warmth, but that was all right. Draco smiled at his son, who was doing very well for his first calling circle. Scorpius beamed back.
And it was probably going to be a venomous snake, although Draco was sure that wasn’t Potter’s preference.
Malfoy’s shoulders tightened, but he kept meeting Harry’s eyes. “I mean, I’d like to help you become more comfortable with your Parseltongue and your Match.”
Harry resisted the temptation to bang his head into a different bedpost than the one the snake was coiled around, because it wouldn’t help. “
“Think of calling your snake, James,” Draco whispered. He was the one who would perform that part of the ritual, in truth, but he wanted James to feel involved. And his desire for a snake would shape which kind responded. “You can do it.”
“Oh?” Harry blinked at his best mate. He wouldn’t have thought that Ron knew much about ritual magic.
“He still needs his mum!” Harry threw up his hands and paced towards the far side of the room. “Merlin, what kind of mother
“It’s not easy,” he finally managed to say. “I’m adjusting. Malfoy wants me to practice ritual magic with him, and I don’t want to.”
Malfoy fumbled for a second, then caught it. The yellow glow around his cobra faded. James stopped screaming, and something in Harry that had wanted to kill people until his son was all right relaxed.
Malfoy was quiet, his eyebrows still bent as if he was trying to think of some way to make Harry’s words not be true. The cobra around his neck woke up and aimed her snout at Harry. Harry let his hands rest by his sides, where he could get to his wand and snap up a shield in seconds if he needed it.
,” Sela hissed, lifting her head to stare at the side of Potter’s face, as if she thought she could will him to face her. “
Draco didn’t know what was worse, the idea that offers had been so rare that Potter hadn’t recognized them, or that all it took was something so small to change Potter’s mind.
Harry sighed. He hated Parseltongue, but he wasn’t the one being asked to speak it. And he wanted to do what was best for James. He deserved to be trained even though Harry would never embrace his own Parseltongue.
“Yes, but Ginny would,” Harry said, and that ended the conversation, as far as he was concerned. He would listen during dinner when Ron and Hermione talked to him again about the Parselmouth school, but his mind was made up. James adored being around Scorpius, he adored learning how to care for Sapphire, and from what Harry had seen when he toured the school, the teachers were doing a surprisingly good job.
The word was like a jab, and Draco swallowed down his irritation once again. It was clear that too many people had failed Potter over the years, including the Mind-Healer who had betrayed all his secrets and the wife who had walked away. Draco would
Just another thing he had to do because of what had happened in the past, if he wanted to raise a good son.
Potter narrowed his eyes and cast again. This time, the spell hit the woman’s shoulder, and pierced through cloth and flesh alike. Draco watched as the skin and muscle rotted and fell away, and revealed slick muscle beneath.
Scorpius Malfoy laughed, sounding more surprised than anything. Malfoy raised his eyebrows, but then smiled. “
to tell his best friends something of what was going on with him, and reclaim them as best friends again. He hadn’t known how hard it would be, or how hard his heart would be pounding.
Potter stared at him in silence, and Draco had the impression of a coiled, waiting will that would drive itself over and over again into a trap if that was what it took, in order to get free. Finally, Potter nodded abruptly and said, “
have venom. He studied it in the light. Bright red stripes caught down its golden body, so bright that he was inclined to believe it wasn’t natural, but a magical creature someone had made in Gryffindor colors.
Besides, it was pretty convenient to have a private way of speaking to his son that not many people could understand.
!” She dropped her wand and swiped with her left hand at Potter, the claws she had in place of nails glinting in the sunlight.
, isn’t he?” Ginny put her hands on her hips. “Someone who’s not horrified by Parseltongue. Someone who
Malfoy stared at him with his mouth slightly open. Harry ignored that, too. He would put up with a lot to have a competent teacher for James’s Parseltongue, and amazingly, it did seem that Malfoy was that. Of course, that might only be because his passion for making Parselmouths strong and achieving power through rituals had overruled his blood prejudice, but Harry would take it.
James joined in with a pure note of song that made the circle quiver, and then a snake crawled into being over the edges of the physical circle on the floor, between one of its ripples and the next.
Draco stared at her. Then he said, in a wonder that felt as if it had hollowed him out, “You don’t trust me.”
seeing her cry like this. She hadn’t even done it when it became clear that James’s first language was Parseltongue and that his English was slow and late in coming.
Snakes could yearn for the companionship of humans. He was sure of that, after seeing Malfoy’s circle. What was wrong was that she was yearning for
“Wh-what did you do, then?” The man had his courage back, from the way he glared at Parkinson with folded arms.
had been a treat, too, to come down the stairs and walk past the rooms where Harry and Hermione and Ron and Luna and Dean and Ollivander and Griphook had all been held). “His mother isn’t here?”
Malfoy hissed a sharp word that streaked past Harry’s ears like a bolt of lightning, and then the ritual room lit. The torches on the walls flickered with uneasy blue-white brilliance, like lightning itself, and the circle on the floor
“I thought it would be different,” Astoria whispered. “When your parents left for France and you told me that you wanted to have a life out of their shadow. That it would be—quiet. Normal. Who cares what other people think about our charitable contributions? Let’s make the ones we want to make. Let’s do what we want to do. Travel. Take care of Scorpius. Teach him that all people are good.” She was rubbing her hands up and down her arms as if she was cold.
Ron’s eyes softened. “I know about that. You want your son to have a different reputation with the public than you had.”
“Someone might overhear us. You might think you could explain to other people about it, and hint around the subject, and one of them might guess.”
Potter nodded. His magic was quiet and buried so deeply inside him that Draco couldn’t feel it. Draco tried not to frown as he faced the black wall of the ritual room that was the closest to the sunlight outside. He still didn’t know what to make of this strange Potter, who was like a cross between the boy he had known at Hogwarts—
James was sitting up in bed, his eyes wide. He didn’t have the usual tears, though. Harry looked around the room decorated in soft blues and greens, wondering if he had cast accidental magic and startled himself awake, instead of with a nightmare.
Harry rolled his eyes and didn’t answer, just going to the bathroom and putting Sela down on the counter while he used the loo. She coiled and stared at herself in the mirror, head swaying back and forth a little. Harry glanced in the mirror himself, and then turned away sharply. He missed the days when it wouldn’t make him flinch to look at his own reflection.
The power paused for a long moment, wavering back and forth, and then it leaped forwards again. Harry assumed it was reaching out in the calling, but then Malfoy gave a hoarse yell, and when Harry spun around to face him, he knew that something had started to go wrong. The cobra on Malfoy’s shoulder had turned a sickly yellow color, and so did the magic that was flowing from him to the others in the circle.
” He glanced at Potter, who was staring out the window with his jaw clenched hard enough that Draco winced to think of what he was doing to his teeth.
“Because I do lose my temper,” Harry said. “And I am a Parselmouth. And they associate that with Voldemort.”
Harry reached without even thinking about it, seizing the flow of the magic and bending it to his will. It smashed against him and tried to flood his nerves with pain. Harry laughed at it with the silent scorn of someone who had faced the Cruciatus from Voldemort himself, and bore down on it.
, and that his whole life he’ll be speaking the filthy language that Tom Riddle whispered in my ear when I was eleven…”
“All right.” Harry sat cross-legged on the floor and pulled James into his arms, ignoring the uncomfortable coolness of the tile against his arse. Sela slithered up to his shoulder, but she wasn’t saying anything, so Harry felt free to speak with Jamie. “That’s not a problem. I just need you to tell me what happened.”
Harry took a deep breath, ruffled his son’s hair, and went back to the table to stare at the letter. There were several lines about how the Parselmouth School would help Parselmouth children because they instinctively performed magic in a different way than ordinary accidental outbursts.
that you’re getting something out of this. That you’re not just turning it into another sacrifice for your son.”
affect your son? He’s already asked me why you insist on speaking English with him so often and why you don’t like to look straight at Sapphire.”
“I believe you,” Potter said in English. His posture had gone tense, and Draco’s own muscles ached at how tight Potter’s appeared. “I just don’t need to take up more of your time or attention than I have. I have friends I’ve neglected and who invited me and James over for dinner tonight. I’ll talk to them.”
Draco blinked and inclined his head. Sela had her tongue darting in and out in agitation, and Draco wondered if she knew it was generally considered bad manners among Parselmouths, at least from what Draco had learned as he began to establish his own schooling system, for a snake to introduce herself. A Parselmouth should do that.
,” Harry said, and noticed that a few people turned around to stare at him, but didn’t scream or gasp. He hoped that the articles had done that much good, then. Parseltongue was James’s native language, like it or not, and Harry wanted him to be able to speak it in public without a fearful reaction from the mob.
Harry gasped and sat up with a sheet half-strangling him. He closed his eyes and massaged his forehead with one hand. His skin was cold and wet enough from sweat to make him feel as if he’d just climbed out of the bath, and he groped for his glasses, surprised that he
Draco swallowed against the impulse to roar at Potter. The blankness and repetition were designed to do that, he knew. Then Potter would have the satisfaction of knowing that he was in the “right.”
Draco understood it better then. Potter hadn’t suddenly decided that he did want to be companion to a snake or Draco’s partner in ritual magic. He was doing this to deflect criticism and hatred back to himself.
Draco swallowed to control his long breath of disgust. He would have liked to speak to many of the people who had hurt Potter, including the Mind-Healer who had betrayed him, and ask them to look at what they had wrought. Potter looked back at Draco with slow blinks, caught up in a world where he was broken and hurt and couldn’t trust anybody except possibly some of the Weasleys, and thought it was
Harry smiled at Hermione. Honestly, he loved his friends, but they went out of the way to protect him too much. Harry was more than capable of doing that for himself, and James, too. “It’s all right, Hermione. Life goes on. And we didn’t end things on good terms. She’s got a right to live.” He settled back against the huge wingback chair in Hermione’s drawing room with his mug of cider and subtly checked the charm glowing on the pocket watch that Molly had given him all those years ago. Yes, James was all right at the Burrow. “Who’s she getting married to?”
” Malfoy continued, his voice curling and seeming to ride the circle of power that went flowing past Harry rather than echoing from his mouth. “
Sela touched her tongue to his neck. Again, Harry let the anger go and focused on James, cradled in his arms, the most important person in the world.
“Yeah, you are,” Harry agreed, staring at the snakes. They weren’t illusions, but neither were they real creatures. They were conjured ones who had appeared because James wanted to hover the pillow, he was pretty sure. But he needed to ask. “James, how are you doing it?”
Hermione snapped her head up. “What? Did someone tell you? Did you write to her?” Ron and Hermione appeared incapable of understanding that Harry had resigned himself to the end of his marriage, and had thought he was writing to Ginny every day or something.
Parkinson flinched a little, but didn’t back away at the name. “So what? They should associate it with other people more by now. They ought to see Parseltongue as the trait of a savior, considering what you did for Britain.”
They continued walking down the alley side-by-side, which somewhat surprised Harry. He’d have thought Malfoy would leave in disgust or high dudgeon, but other than a few annoyed blinks, he seemed to take what Harry had said in stride.
!” The blond wizard leaned back as Parkinson pointed at him, as if he believed that she would launch lightning out of her finger. Given the average wizard’s notions of defense, Harry supposed that he couldn’t really blame the git.
Harry stared at her in turn. Sela stretched up to meet his eyes, although Harry suspected she got more information about him from her darting tongue.
Scorpius looked a little startled, but he trotted off to do that. James was so involved in watching Sapphire and asking him questions that he didn’t appear to have noticed. Sapphire answered in a soft voice that made Harry obscurely glad James didn’t appear to have attracted an arrogant snake.
On evenings like this, when James had been full all day of tears and wails and unreasonable fixations on Muggle cartoons on the telly that he wanted to watch thirty hours of, Harry sat beside his cot and smoothed his sleeping son’s back and thought about the unforgivable thing he had said to his wife.
Harry tensed his shoulders and turned to face the blustery voice. This was one reason he never went to the shops with James, who was safely at school for the morning. Parkinson halted beside him, but didn’t move away.
“Annabelle Selwyn, yes. She didn’t stay long. Ultimately she decided that this wasn’t the right school for her.” Draco restrained his sneer. It wasn’t as though she would be able to find another school for her daughter to learn the magic she’d inherited from her Marked father.
Brooks grumbled and postured some more, but he had no grounds to arrest Harry when he had acted in self-defense, Moonborn was a wanted criminal plus a werewolf, and Harry hadn’t actually killed her. In the end, Brooks let him go with some mutters that Harry didn’t bother paying attention to. He walked over to Malfoy and their sons, nodding in thanks to Malfoy before he crouched down in front of James.
, and should value the power and companionship it held out for himself. But if Draco could only reach him through concern for his son, he would take it.
“And that just proves that you’re more of an idiot, that you use that kind of cliched dialogue.” Parkinson stalked a step forwards, and abruptly her krait was visible around her throat. It had probably been under a specialized Disillusionment Charm before, Harry thought, and noticed the way the man paled when he saw the snake. “
Maybe her wanting to help him with Parseltongue wasn’t just because she was determined to have a Speaker of her own and participate in ritual circles. And helping him with nightmares and pain…
As, in a different way, his divorce from Astoria had. She hadn’t been horrified at all that Scorpius was a Parselmouth or that Draco had developed the trait by the time they wed; she was a little proud, in fact. But what he wanted to do with it…
He had been asking for her last name, but Draco preserved his smile, and simply nodded. “Of course. Well, Clarissa—” she giggled “—I’m here to see about some of the old editions of the
Draco thrust the thought away as the current turned into a waterfall for a moment and Pansy gave him a sharp glance. He knew better than this. He knew that Potter wasn’t important right now. James was.
She sounded somewhere between angry and hurt, herself. Harry blew air out between his lips and sat up. Sela came with him, but stayed where she was, even though it was a more awkward position now and made Harry have to juggle her on his arm. Sela just gave a sulky little hiss and didn’t move.
“I assure you that I’m not upset about losing her custom.” Draco let his voice shade cooler. “And if you intend to take James out of the school because of her, I must advise against it. He is thriving here.”
Memories of Ron and Hermione leaped to mind, but they were all from years ago. They hadn’t interfered in his divorce from Ginny, but they had accepted what Harry had said about it, and that he blamed himself. They had offered comfort and babysitting for James and to stay with him, but—
“I—didn’t know if you wanted to know that Ginny is getting married again. But it’ll be in the papers, so…”
Potter closed his eyes and took a long, slow breath. Draco blinked, and finally said, “My name is Draco Malfoy. This is my son, Scorpius.” He patted Scorpius’s shoulder, and Scorpius stood upright.
“I think it’s a good thing that you’re talking to your friends,” Draco said mildly, surprising Potter into a sidelong stare. “But that doesn’t mean I can’t help as well.”
“You want to be politically active, Draco,” Astoria said, and turned around to face him with her hands shaking. “That’s the
Harry laughed, and watched both the reporters and Malfoy jump at the sound, which was a source of some satisfaction. “That’s a Muggle concept that demands the government
Pansy Parkinson had fallen into step beside him as he walked through Diagon Alley to go to the shops. Harry bit back the urge to curse, and nodded distantly to her. “Parkinson. How are you?”
The wizard began to scream, and it was a distinctively female voice. The hood still hid her face, and Draco had no idea who she was, but he felt a little better knowing her gender. He would have stepped forwards to support Potter, but the shield that still held him held him back, too, and he couldn’t move.
Potter twisted his head a little in Draco’s direction without looking away from his victim. “She still isn’t retreating,” he muttered. “I don’t know for sure what she’s going to try, but—”
And Draco Malfoy, who did have some political power if he’d managed to keep his school open, was watching.
He hadn’t meant to use that kind of magic on Moonborn in the middle of Diagon Alley. In front of his son. In front of Malfoy, who thought he belonged around children other than James, for some reason.
Harry hated the sensation that was making its way up his skin, like thousands of spiders crawling in his veins. Over and over again, a voice bleated in the back of his head, asking what he thought he was doing by attracting the attention of the press.
” Harry stroked down James’s spine again while he tried to think about how to explain something that often made no sense even to him. “
” James said, from where he was stroking Charlie’s back. Charlie had rolled upside-down with what Draco privately thought of as his idiot expression on his face. “
That had been the same year that details started out to come out about those who had been branded by the Dark Lord developing as Parselmouths, so outrage over that part of the story had died down fairly quickly. There were simply too many purebloods with money and good positions in society speaking Parseltongue for the prejudice to endure.
It was a variation of the Parseltongue word for “light.” Harry looked at her again and saw her neck stretched yearningly towards him.
Malfoy blinked, and then seemed to be fighting back his own irritation. “Haven’t I proven that I’m nothing like
Parkinson and Goyle didn’t answer. They were too busy staring at the circle on the floor, which Harry hadn’t noticed so far because it was so perfectly black and blended in with the stone of the floor. James gasped as the black snake stretched itself, a long ripple that ran up its body and down without making the serpent let go of the tail it was holding with its mouth, and said, “
Watching the way James’s shoulders tensed, Harry thought that perhaps he should have left this longer. But even though he’d seen the change in Jamie’s demeanor at once, he hadn’t intervened for a full day. He’d thought that James had just had some argument with the other kids at the school and would work through it.
understand it. The way James had lit up at the sight of Scorpius made up for it, but not as much as Harry would have liked it to. “Hello, Malfoy.”
Draco skimmed quickly through the article, then nodded and flipped to another. Few had much to add to the original, but they repeated the details enough for Draco to build a coherent picture of something he’d barely thought about for years.
“I don’t want you to take Sela.” Harry said it with dry lips that he licked, hard. He wondered abstractly if he looked like a snake, too, darting his tongue out.
There was a sharp indrawing of breath from some of the reporters, and Temperance looked as if she was about to ask a question. But Harry kept his gaze locked on Keller, and he spoke first. “Do other nations on the Continent have as many?”
native language now that he knew he could do so. “Not when I know you have venom. Go find someone else.”
Harry snorted softly. “Or the reporters might ask them questions and twist their words. I have more experience of the press than you do.”
“That doesn’t mean I get to have some kind of personal claim on you.” Potter turned back to watch the children again, ignoring what seems to be the rhythmic clenching and tightening of Sela on his arm. “I’ve already confessed enough that’s personal to you. I—have inappropriate emotional reactions in your presence. I’m sorry.”
,” Parkinson said. “That man approached you when you hadn’t said a word to him, hadn’t even bumped into him. Don’t you deserve some peace from that? Doesn’t
They bounced from a shield that Draco hadn’t even realized Potter had wrapped around himself. Potter broke it a second later with a twist of purple and blue magic that sent Moonborn sprawling on the cobblestones. At least it seemed as if the rotting spell wasn’t going to consume more of her, Draco thought, queasy. Her right arm was mostly bone, but it hadn’t spread anywhere else.
“You don’t have to look as though you’re about to be devoured by a pack of werewolves, Potter,” Malfoy muttered out of the corner of his mouth.
It could have been worse, Harry reflected. In fact, everything could have been a great deal worse, if the ritual going wrong had affected the calling of James’s snake. At least this way, if something was off, Harry couldn’t tell what it was, and he didn’t think Malfoy and the rest would have been so contented if something was.
“And you should know,” Draco said, switching back to English, too, because he wanted to drive home the point, “that training for most Parselmouths and their children is free because I want to get this system off the ground and I want to see them embrace their gifts. That won’t be the case with you. I’m going to charge you all the Galleons I can get away with.”
Harry shook his head. “Ginny and I divorced a few years ago.” With practice, he kept his voice neutral as well.
“He needs to know things about his Parseltongue, things I can’t teach him. And right now, he doesn’t have a lot of other friends like his cousins because of the continual delicate dance we have to do around the Burrow to make sure that we’re not there when Ginny is.”
Ginny screamed as the fangs stabbed into her, and Harry could see her convulsing under the weight of all those bodies, as much as she could. He imagined the venom heating the blood in her veins, tearing apart her muscles, making her limbs swell up—
But he hadn’t had a peaceful night’s sleep without it in nearly a decade now, and he didn’t see that changing any time soon.
“Of course I have. Although I don’t know for sure why you wanted them out of the way. They might make the school seem more friendly.”
He started to say something else, but Potter abruptly moved like a whirlwind, turning and ducking so that he was crouching over James, Scorpius, and their snakes. Draco started fowards, and found himself encased in a translucent shield. Stunned, he stood still and stared around as Edwina reared, hissing, on his shoulder, and only then realized that there was a hole in the cobblestones at his feet, and people were screaming and scattering.
It was as if even his body warmth had been shut away behind some door Draco didn’t know how to unlock. Draco couldn’t sense his magic, either, which had been so resonant around him the last time he’d visited the school. Draco bit his lip and said softly, “Are you all right, Potter?”
The snake arranged herself around the foot of one of the bedposts on James’s bed, and yawned soundlessly at him, revealing the delicate fangs that stood out in the front of her mouth. She seemed to have no other teeth. “
“You’ve made sure the children are out of the way?” Harry asked, without turning his head to look at Malfoy. The reporters were close enough that he could make out the gleam of the sun from the silver robes that many of them had started to wear after the war to identify themselves as official employees of the papers.
Draco paused, his fingers smoothing along the back of Edwina’s hood while she hissed sleepy compliments about how good he was at this. “I have no desire to bribe people in the Ministry the way my father did.”
That was a phrase straight out of the pamphlet that Draco distributed to anxious parents. He eyed Potter and wondered why the git had decided to repeat it now. “Yes.”
Harry chose to shrug and wait. None of the people coming up to the path now were as bad as Skeeter, that was one consolation. They chose to salivate after him, but they reported the truth more often, and took delight in more things than scandal.
Potter stared off into the distance. “Doesn’t it matter that I won’t be a good Parselmouth?” he whispered. “I can’t give that snake what she wants. I can’t give James what he’ll need, apparently. Isn’t there another way that he can learn from you? That he can call the snake?”
James sounded as if he was about to cry again. Harry turned from the window and went to sit down next to his son, holding him close and stroking his hair back from his forehead. Sometimes he would just sit there and look at his son, so different from him despite how messy his hair was. No scar, no green eyes, no black hair, no haunted, terrified expression.
“Well enough.” She eyed him sharply, and then the basket that hovered behind him. “Did you know that you could conjure a sturdier basket that would be attached to you with a snake?”
“Potter?” Parkinson asked at the same time, eyes narrowed in the way she seemed to have of pretending she didn’t care. “Are you going to be all right?”
“Potter?” he asked, because Potter had a look of both hatred and recognition on his face. “Who is she?”
Draco bit back his amusement, and reached outwards with the flowing force of the magic shifting in a watery circle from him to Edwina to Isabella to Pansy to Greg to Bael to Charlie to Scorpius to James and back again. He felt a mind speak in answer.
human being, not like you, with the Parseltongue and the filthy Muggle home you hailed from and all the rest of it!”
Harry didn’t acknowledge that Sela had spoken, other than shifting his shoulder a little when she tried to crawl down his arm and towards the Aurors his Patronus had summoned. Her Parseltongue would probably sound like ordinary hissing to them, and as long as she didn’t attack them, everything would be fine.
Harry sighed and got down on the floor. He hated speaking Parseltongue, especially since it had been one of the things that had cost James his mother. But on the other hand, maybe it was best that he take the lead so James wouldn’t get charmed by the thing and want to keep it as a pet. “
But then, would he have agreed to take the snake away instead of arguing to try and make Harry accept her?
James was looking up at him with big, scared eyes. Draco bent down, relieved to find that the shield around him could blend with the shield around the boys, and he could reach out and place his hands on their shoulders. “Someone attacked us because she hated your father,” he said quietly. “But we’re safe.”
” In truth, he didn’t think there was much change since Sela had started helping him, except that he dreamed of Voldemort less. But he would take that.
Sela twisted her neck to the side so that they could make eye contact. Her eyes were a startling green, even after he’d been around her long enough that Harry would have thought he’d get used to it. “
Malfoy’s voice could have cut through the black stone that made up the walls and floor of the ritual room, Harry thought. Parkinson gasped. Goyle stared at him as if he didn’t know what to do with that information. Harry folded his arms and glanced away.
Harry nodded and smiled and waved a hand at James. Speaking in English would disrupt the ritual—Malfoy had made that clear before they started—and fuck everything if he was going to speak in Parseltongue.
Yes, Harry knew he had trauma. But when everyone would side with the Healer if one betrayed him again, and people still flinched away from him in the streets when he went to the shops in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade, Harry didn’t see what he could do about it.
Potter had gone to a Mind-Healer called Leroy Bandler after, apparently, some kind of traumatic incident had happened to him on an Auror mission. Bandler had listened to Potter for three months, then sold the secrets Potter had told him to the papers. Bandler’s excuse, as listed in one article that included a photograph of him standing with his arms around his wife and children, was that his children were starving and he needed the money, and he believed Potter “a danger to our society.”
He sounded reverent. Harry stared directly into his eyes. “I’m grateful for what you did for James. And I’ll never keep him away from Parseltongue, or speak badly in front of him about it, or try to separate him from Sapphire. But the rest…”
“I wanted to introduce you to my snake, Sela,” Harry said, extending his arm, and at least Sela cooperated this time and lifted her head, slithering into view. There were a few gasps, one scream, but Harry didn’t allow them to take hold, rolling with his own momentum instead. “And to tell you the story of how I started to think better of my Parseltongue, and why the school appealed to me for my son…”
But instead of a Death Eater or that group of lunatics calling themselves the Order of the Serpent, there was nothing but a small golden snake curled up there. Harry lowered his wand, but kept it out. The snake
“We’ll do that, of course,” Draco tried to soothe Astoria, although he retained some private doubt about whether teaching their son that
He turned his gaze back to the basalt walls and raised his mental voice, calling and calling, reaching for the snake that would best complement James Sirius Potter.
And although there might have been people, like Astoria, who would say the same about Draco, Draco didn’t think it was the case. He’d had friendships and the goal of staring the school and promoting other Parselmouths and Parseltongue ritual magic from the time Scorpius was an infant. Potter appeared to have nothing except James and his obsessive circling around the boy.
“There was something else I was hoping to speak to you about,” Malfoy said then. “Something that I believe you could do to benefit the school.”
Harry just shook his head and looked at Parkinson. “I appreciate you bringing her here, but I won’t bond with her.”
Potter looked at her with those same blank eyes, and Draco had his answer as to what was wrong with Potter. He had locked away the anger he had shown Draco last time, the magic that made him who he was and lit his eyes from within, and now showed barely enough to go on walking around with. He seemed to have decided to respond to his own Parseltongue, and his snake, with passive rejection instead of active.
Harry bent down and wrapped his arms around James as he burst out of the corridor into the schoolroom. He buried his face against his son’s hair and breathed in the soft sweetness of it.
And Harry was determined to keep it that way, which was why he was so reluctant to tell James about the unforgivable thing.
Parkinson shook her head a little. “The difference between me and them is that I can admit I fucked up,” she said, and ignored the glare she got from a witch walking by with two young children. “And that I’m fighting to make a world that’s different from what we grew up with, not just settling back and trusting that it’ll change on its own.”
people were good was a good idea. “But I also want to practice the ritual magic and let Scorpius explore the fullest potential of his gift.”
Hermione flinched a little, but took her hand gently away from Sela and smiled down at James and Sapphire. “Were you trying to show me your snake?” She bent down and examined his scales as James tilted his head back and forth. Sapphire held still. Harry could admit that he was glad his son had been found by such a
” He cast a helpless glance around at the maze of sapphire-colored shelving and the random cubbyholes and nooks that were as likely to hold ancient scrolls as rolled-up newspapers. “I don’t know where to start.”
fallen asleep at all. Most of the time, on nights when he couldn’t take the Diluted Dreamless Sleep potion because it would otherwise build up too much in his system, he simply lay staring at the ceiling until the sun rose.
But it was clear that waiting on Potter to do it was useless, and so Draco simply nodded and said, “
it to him. It’ll be better for him not to have me around when I can’t get over my horror. And don’t tell me that you’re over the nightmares, either, Harry! I hear you hissing and twisting in your bed at night!”
Unlike everything else. The snake was offering to take the place of his Mind-Healer? That was so broken that Harry didn’t know what to say.
To appeal to his son? If James had been by himself and spoken innocently to the snake, or been attracted to pick it up…
And Harry wasn’t in the mood to translate her contribution to the conversation. He shrugged at Ron. “I don’t think me trying to ignore that I’m a Parselmouth has done James much good. He needs to learn how to control it, because he’s already performing accidental magic with it. The last thing I want is for him to hurt someone with it.”
?” The snake flicked her neck to the left this time, and revealed that the blood-bright stripes ran all the way across her scales and ended up in a messy knot of color on the back of her head—which at least didn’t have a hood the way a cobra’s did, Harry saw. “
as the power surged past him. He was stretching out his hands and whisper-hissing, and Harry could almost hear the hissing of the snake that would come for him.
“It is, but I can’t get rid of it, and I’m not going to teach my son to be ashamed of his potential.”
The ritual ended with Malfoy softly chanting phrases that made the ripples fade and disappear, and the black snake on the floor went back to looking as if it was made of stone. Harry let the magic go with a relieved sigh. Carrying it around had been like carrying boulders with knives on the bottom that were planted in his shoulders.
Harry controlled the urge to laugh hysterically by clutching his basket. The handle creaked, but it didn’t break. And if it had, then he could have cast a
Harry rolled out of bed in instants. It had been two years since he was a full-time Auror, but he still had the reflexes. He sprinted down the corridor, aiming his wand in front of him and calling up
And that was the way he had to think of it, he thought, carefully reorienting himself, managing to skip over the bright-hot pain of losing James’s mother. The Parseltongue was something he was doing for his son. James would feel more comfortable because Harry also had a snake. This was like retiring from the Aurors or committing, as carefully as he could, to staying away from the Burrow when he knew Ginny was going to be there.
“It’s free publicity for your school, Malfoy. And me admitting that James is a Parselmouth. You’re going to turn it down?”
” Sela did lift her head from its resting place now, her tongue darting out as she considered Harry. “
He thought Parkinson would drop her arm and leave in disgust. He was good at making people do that. But Parkinson only marched closer, so that Sela’s head was only a few centimeters from Harry’s elbow. She still couldn’t cross the distance, though. Or, presumably, they wanted him to do a bit of symbolic reaching-out.
