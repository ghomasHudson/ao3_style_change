There was a rustling sound and then Draco held up the map for both he and Harry to see. The shape of the island fitted the shape of the island on his map.
Harry put down the book he had been browsing and walked quickly out of the shop, the front doorbell ringing loudly as he left. But as Harry stepped outside, Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.
Dean tried to interrupt. 'Harry, I know all of this. You don't have to apologise to me.'
My father is a good man, no matter what the history books say. Since the day I was born, my father has always protected me and loved me, and that is more than I can say about pretty much anyone else in the wizarding world, including my mother.
In response to Harry's accusation, Draco's face had paled of colour and his mouth was left open wide.
"He speaks!" I say, thinking it a funny joke, but Mr. Potter doesn't laugh. He just pulls down his jumper and stares at me until my giggles turn to nervous laughter.
Right. They were just experimenting. Well tonight was too nice to dwell on why that hurt Harry, so he nodded and smiled.
There was a pause and then Draco chuckled. “I had no idea you had a sense of humour, Potter.  That might come in handy.”
"Harry! Harry! Oh God! Harry!!"
“Don't you think you should release my son?”
With a calculated quizzical look, Draco sat back into the office chair and rested his head on top of his raised fingers. 'Strange that you say that. According to my sources, the
Draco then left his bed and stood in the middle of their quarters. Harry was unsure if Draco was awake or still in midst of his nightmare, but Draco’s intensity led Harry to believe that Draco was awake and fully aware of what he was doing.
Draco didn’t respond. He continued to hang his head, his blond hair falling into his face. Harry shrugged, not too disappointed. This was just the Hogwarts Express, nothing else to worry about really.
“It’s not so bad.”
Harry continued his private worship service to Draco's tight entrance, the slightly wrinkled surface a perfect playground for his tongue. Getting it good and wet, he slowly moved one finger in, turning and twisting it inside, loving how Draco's hole sucked it in tight. He added another, and then another, slowly loosening Draco up for the big show, loving the look of pure ecstasy on Draco's face. His eyes were closed, his hand was on his cock, and his lips continued to open and shut in a continuous silent scream.
She too followed Randoph, giving him a hug on approach.
Suddenly there was a creaking noise. Harry turned to see the front door of the house he had mysteriously landed in front of began to open.
“You said that you and I were researching being gay together. Together, alone, in some shack we’re going to build!”
He bounded to the table, whooting with the rest of the Hall. Kids were standing, high fiving each other.
“They still have you on?” Detective Jerry said, his fat belly waving as he spoke. “I thought they fired you a long time ago.”
And then there was nothing.
Draco leaned forward, grabbing a fistful of Harry's  shirt. “Don't you see? That's what it was like for me growing up. I had no consequences for my actions, and see how I turned out? Do you see what I did? I worked alongside a killer! I watched as my professor was murdered before my eyes and I did nothing. I stood by as my best friends tortured eleven year olds. I stupidly allowed Crabbe to cast that bloody spell. I need consequences. The world needs consequences. That's why that wand has to be destroyed.”
Ollivander began to walk to the back of his shop without looking back. Harry looked around, placing his hands in his pockets, and followed.
Draco smiled a bright wide smile. “He remembers.”
“Sure, Ron.”
Harry pocketed the item and made a mental note to ask the family if they knew anyone by the name 'Potter'.
Made when God slept in times of old.
'Damn it, Malfoy. I'll be out in a second.'
Harry quickly stepped towards Teddy and looked up. It was better than anything he could have imagined. The house seemed to go on forever and there were so many twists and turns Harry was unsure how many rooms were in the place. The trees looked as if they were part of the place.
Ollivander waved Harry’s comment away. “Never mind that. You must come with me, and quickly.”
The phrase began to swim in Harry's head sounding a lot like crazy portrait Snape's voice. What was he saying the other day, something about dancing trolls and a something green growing over it? How dare the man compare him and everyone else in his year to a troll? Teaching them ballet . . . Just like Barnabas!
“People are always misunderstanding me.”
"Make it quick. And don’t touch my Cornflakes."
“No thanks, Hermione, I’m not really interesting in dating anyone right now.”
All the talk had just made Harry harder and imagining fucking, being inside Draco. Harry really couldn’t wait.
Malfoy shook his head as if Harry just asked him why the sky was blue.
Harry followed Draco out into the hallway leading to the front door. Draco was standing at the door waiting for Harry. When Harry was in arms reach Draco grabbed him and again cupped Harry’s cheek while kissing him. The kiss went much longer than the kisses before and seemed almost desperate. Draco then stopped, rested his forehead against Harry’s for a second, and then walked out the door.
My eyes grow wide, putting two and two together. "You invited your probation officer? Isn’t he an Auror?"
“Draco, what happened? Please tell me what happened.”
I'm dropped to the ground. My arm is still over my eyes, so I can't see anything. I can hear voices, but underneath the spell they seem hazy, their timbre obscured.
Harry cried out. 'But it was my fault! I made the decision to help Shiraq! I dragged you all into that mess when we should have stayed out of it! We had no business being involved.'
Harry brought out a small notepad. Knowing Cindy was coming in today, he had written everything down.
“Malfoy Architecture? Malfoy Archi… oh my god. You make the tree houses.”
“It was hard. It was really hard to be by myself.”
"Come on, you're not like those kids that think the Sorting Hat is wrong, are you?"
Flashes of men with red robes raiding our home unannounced fly through my mind. The Aurors came often when I was little. I was always so frightened as they yelled at my father, threatened to take him away, and broke everything.
“I think perhaps you should head upstairs and think about things."
is the final answer and my stomach is growling.
Harry walked out whistling.
The burly man grunts as he throws his suitcase into the now furnished guest room.
So Harry did what he always did when he couldn't sleep, he wandered the halls until his body was near exhaustion. Somewhere along the way, Malfoy had joined him and had walked silently with him, until they both collapsed beside a wall in the middle of an empty hallway on the fifth floor. It was then that Malfoy brought up the issue of the wand.
This morning was special. Harry had brought with him ribbons to decorate Draco for Beltane. Harry had been invited to several bonfires that night, but he was going to spend this night with Draco. He fashioned red and white ribbons along the branches, placing wishes of love and happiness on each one.
'Harry!' Padma shouted somewhere to Harry's left. 'Over here, I think I found a way in.'
"Where the green valley roams, where the green valley roams, green valley roams, green valley."
'I just hope you don't plan on using all the hot water.'
Then, out of the darkness, came movement. It was something large, and slow, a substantial body too big to create a discernable shape. Several tentacles rose and lined the walls. It was as if the animal was pulling itself from the depths of the cave, dragging its sizeable body along the rock and dirt.
“Touché”
The elf tapped him again on his nose.
He looked down to see Draco touching himself. It was so hot to see Draco pleasuring himself, and Harry’s cock was inside him. The thought was mind blowing. So much so that he felt his orgasm coming.
He could feel Draco's eyes boring into the back of his head from the high table. Harry swallowed and began his speech, hoping Draco might hear the apology in his words.
Draco scoffed. “My bark keeps me warm enough. No need to turn into my mother, Potter.”
Draco took back the tongue and sped up, adding a twist to the end. Harry took both of his hands and slapped Draco's arse making a loud sound, and soothing the heat it caused.
Sir Culhwich stepped beside Harry. 'This is the strongest ward I've seen. I've never seen one that would kick a group of people out like that. I'm not sure we'll be able to get through by throwing spells at it.'
Neville looked at Cindy and used his surprisingly sexy bedroom voice again, "We're having sex?"
Harry's eyes grew heavy and his muscles limp. His empty glass tumbled onto the floor as his body relaxed and his head fell to the side.
“This tree was discovered by one of three brothers. The magic inside the tree had called out to a young man, to cut it down and harvest it. The wood was fashioned into a great wand that could never be defeated. But once the wood was harvested, the tree withered and died, as did all that was contained inside it. Wand makers have attempted to recreate the wand, but none have succeeded.”
Malfoy inched closer, his breath making Harry's eye's water.
"Um, well."
“Oh, this is getting good!”
“Oh yeah? What did you get him this year?”
The two men sat quietly on the ground. Harry was pretty sure Draco would Disapparate any minute now. It was actually pretty surprising that he was still here, and being relatively nice.
Draco grabbed Harry's hair and pulled, hard, until their noses were squishing together. Harry reached up and yanked off his glasses, throwing them somewhere. Harry then pulled Draco so hard that Harry fell backwards, his back landing on the desk, with Draco on top of him.
Harry gave Draco’s hand a squeeze and followed him up the stairs.
“It doesn’t,” Draco said a little breathy, “I just need to get used to it. Give me a minute.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You banged outside my door for three days straight, just to tell me that you're having weird dreams?”
“Yeah, this is the first time I’ve ever been able to talk about this stuff. It’s really nice.”
“What? I went in, didn't I?”
Groaning, I take my time heading downstairs, poking my head around the boxes already on the floor and attempt to calculate in my head how many hours it will take to put everything up.
Oh buggering hell.
"Well, yes, but he has some time off. He seemed very intrigued by our Twelfth Night traditions."
Groaning, I take my time heading downstairs, poking my head around the boxes already on the floor and attempt to calculate in my head how many hours it will take to put everything up. Too long is the final answer and my stomach is growling.
The wonderful nolagal! Also, a big thank you to Sevfan for all her hard work, and the rest of the hex mods! You guys are great!!!
“Mother, did you not hear me?”
I bound up the stairs two at a time, making as much noise as possible. My father dumps another box in my arms before I can get a word in and kicks me back toward the stairs. This one smells like salt and brine. It must be the seaweed.
Draco wasn’t lying in the middle of the bed, like Harry had been expecting, but was rather standing in the middle of their room admiring himself in a full-length mirror, swishing back and forth.
Draco pointed to the three long rows of twigs that littered the ground. It had taken him three days to get to this point. He was almost done.
Unlike what had happened the day before, where memories came in an out like a strobe light, memories of the past few months, his time away from Draco, living as a Muggle police officer, came rushing back. He clung hard to Draco's hand in desperation.
“Yes! Brilliant right? The family reconciles, you know Teddy will love him with his obsession with blond hair, and Draco and I can become better friends while solving a mutual problem!”
Harry looked up confused. “No?”
Bark.
Draco walked up to Harry and slapped him in the face. He hauled Harry by his shirt until he was inches from Draco's face. His white skin had turned red and the sneer was back in all its glory.
Draco suddenly stood. 'Of course not, you twit! But I thought the Dark Lord's body was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere. Why would I have it?'
Harry smiled, baffled at his elated excitement over tree watching with Draco Malfoy. Were there pigs in the sky? Was Voldemort chilled by the sudden freeze in hell?
"Is that the Auror uniform? It's different from what I remember."
I hear shuffling and a few muttered shhs.
Narcissa continued to look at her sister. “Old family secret. Our parents did it to us; I did it to you, Draco, although you must not remember. I’m surprised you have not thought of it sooner, Andy.”
He was going to come, but he was determined to make Draco come first. He stared into Draco’s eyes and saw his glance at Harry’s lip when he bit into it. So he leaned forward and kissed Draco.
“No I meant I was a total virgin. I’ve never had sex before.”
I place the box down next to the others in the living room and wipe my brow. All the work has made me thirsty and I make a mad dash to the kitchen for some orange juice.
Draco looked directly in the house-elf's big beady eyes and  truly wished that he was as cruel to his house-elves as they led everyone to believe.
“She clearly doesn't have a problem with it,” Harry responded without thinking. The woman snapped her head sharply towards him. She sneered, and then after getting a good look at his face her eyes widened, much like Draco's when he first recognized him. She also moved her right hand into her right pocket. The motion was swift and Harry had almost not caught it.
“Because I don’t want any magic interfering with the wood until I start building. I told you this was a delicate process. But you are in luck. Today we start the building.”
Harry followed the man down into the basement stepping over torn laundry baskets and mangled plastic remains of detergent bottles
Harry looked up to the tree-tops and tried to image a tree house, but he couldn’t picture anything except wood and windows.
The next page in the file looks more promising. It's a piece of parchment with an official seal on the bottom. It's an order for Mr Potter, to begin an investigation on my father for use of Magic in front of Muggles.
“No you can’t. You can’t just fix things because you say so!
'See, there he is.'
His cell phone, still inside its holster on his hip, began to ring and vibrate madly. Still disorientated, Harry picked it up, distractedly answering while he scanned the area to find out where he was.
Which is why he was so frustrated with himself for not saying no to Draco's foolish adventure. He knew better.
Draco pulled on his hair. “But, weren't you angry? You trusted Dumbledore! You said so a few days ago that you considered him to be a father figure. But what kind of father sets things in motion so that his son has to knowingly walk into death?”
Harry yelled. 'Put that away, Malfoy!'
It was worse when we visited my grandfather and grandmother. My grandfather would curl his lip until it reached his nose when my father said it, and my grandmother’s eyes would fill with tears. My father would grab my grandmother’s hand, squeezing it in sympathy, until my mother gave an annoyed sigh and he let go.
Padma then jumped into the hole, crawling on her hands and knees until she reached the other side. She continued to crawl until she reached a wall, touching the side of the castle and yelling in triumph.
“Stop the act Potter! You look even more ridiculous!”
I like my imperfections - the hole in my socks that I forgot to mend, the ink stain on my letters from spilling my ink well, the owl feathers that litter my living room. My past is a part of me. The dirty cot is my right leg, the bloody nightmare of fallen friends is my left hand. I have a scar on my head. I am an orphan. I swear far too much.
The crew shuffled back, covered in mud, dirt, and rain. Harry didn't want to stop digging but there was something in Draco's eyes that urged Harry to trust him.
After Lucius finished speaking, he fell back into the bed. The message he had given Draco had drained him of all his energy. Draco stood away from the bed, watching his mother resume her fussing, brushing out the creases in the quilts and placing small kisses on Lucius’s forehead.
And for his last birthday, Ron had decided Teddy was old enough for Quiddich paraphernalia, purchasing mini pads, gloves and broom polish. Teddy loved the presents, but decided the broom polish would be better lathered all over his own body, instead of a broom, and ran around naked outside. Harry and Andromeda attempted to catch him, but he was so slippery that he kept getting away. Harry had to bring out the hose. Teddy did have fun with that gift, even if Harry and Andromeda didn’t.
I hear a muffled sob. “But, he was so angry at us. Did you see his face? I don't think I can do this.”
I overheard my mother, in the midst of one of their many arguments, claim that my father refused to believe that I was his, at first.
Harry attempted to uncurl Draco’s hands. Draco reluctantly allowed him. “Do they know if it will stop?”
Harry yelled. 'I don't give a rat's arse what your father could or could not do. I just want to know how to get inside and get Luna out. Or is this a happy circumstance? Was this your plan all along, to drag us to this unknown island in hopes of us all getting picked off one by one?'
"Watch me."
“What happened?” he exclaimed, trying, in vain, to remember how he got to the hospital.
'The anchor's up, Captain!' Luna cried, her tiny body leaning over the forecastle.
I shiver, unwilling to think about how Harry convinced my father of his seriousness. I make a face, sticking my tongue out and making a gagging noise.
I shiver, unwilling to think about how Harry convinced my father of his seriousness. I make a face, sticking my tongue out and making a gagging noise.
Harry kissed Draco on the top of his head.
“Of course, your highness.”

Harry ran straight to him, grabbed his face, and took what he had been dreaming about since that morning, so many months ago, when he saw Draco in the bookshop. His lips devoured Draco's, taking in every thing Draco had to give. Their tongues met and lightening danced across his skin to his very toes.
Draco looked around, seeing them hanging on the edge of a desk chair. He picked them up and placed them gently on Harry's face. Once on, Harry looked up to see Draco smiling at him.
Martin, Merryweather, Nathon, Perry, all continued to be sorted into Slytherin. Harry could hear McGonagall begin to ascend, but the other professors were holding her back.
Harry looked across the hallway at Malfoy who had curled himself tightly against the wall. The git was annoying, mean, spiteful, hateful, but a constant in Harry's life. It was hard to imagine him not in it.
There, through the broken branches, go
Draco gave Harry a dismissive wave, but his cheeks did redden. “Whatever.”
“Did you hurt yourself? Did you fall?!”
Returning to his normal tone of voice, Harry spoke sharply, 'What have you heard?'
He searched every angle, every nook and cranny, trying to find anything that was remotely human. But there was nothing.
Harry began to laugh. Draco swotted his arm. 'I'm sorry, Malfoy, but you must admit it has a certain karmic charm to it.'
thesamanthahope and turnedinpages.
“I wanted to try Draco’s easel! Grandma let me use all the paints.”
“Be right back, Andromeda, just going to walk Draco to the door.”
'I've heard all the stories about Harry Potter, but clearly the old man's lost his touch,' Finn snapped back, his chin held high as he pulled away from Dean's clutches.
Draco didn't respond at first. Harry heard what sounded like brushing. Considering Draco's now-long locks, it made sense.
Thank you so much for reading this fic - this is the last part. And thank you to sevfan for all her help. Disclaimer and thank yous are also on Part One.
'I'm not sure, Harry, but I think it might be another flying ship.'
‘I’ve spoken with the giant squid,’ Luna answered. Harry was not surprised that Luna had spoken to the mollusc. But that was Luna. She always made it a point to speak to all creatures, no matter the species or ability to respond. ‘He’s found himself a nice lake, but sometimes he’s lonely. I’m sure he misses his brother.’
“It was my mother's favorite poem. I memorized it when I was a child for one of her birthdays.”
The End :)
Adults these days.
Harry giggled into his own bun he was currently stuffing into his mouth. The two had been enjoying the meal for the last ten minutes, diving in hungrily into the roast and potatoes. Their words had been few due to the lack of breath between bites.
“Sweet! I win the bet!”
But, seeing this open unblemished island hit Harry somewhere deep in his core.
"I didn't realize Herbology was a favorite."
But he hadn't. This Draco was Harry Potter's, not his. He was Harry Black, detective for the London Police, stationed at Paddington Green. Hit his head a few months ago, making the past a bit fuzzy, but Katie and the Chief filled in the gaps for him. He was a single child, parents unfortunately deceased, dedicated to law enforcement and solving crimes. He lived alone and rode a motorbike.
“Draco, can you get dressed? We're going to see Snape for a minute.”
"This brute manhandled me and I demand compensation. I go on holiday for the first time in 700 years and I hear that you send this man to come fetch me? I demand a pay raise and for you to send me back to Hawaii after the Sorting."
My father kicks me in the shins and gives me a look that threatens to turn into a lecture if I don’t keep quiet. I sigh and stab a piece of carrot with my fork, imagining it to be Mr Potter’s arm.
"I notice stuff."
The boys chuckled. Jerry flicked Harry’s badge that he wore round his neck. “Harry Black, eh? Not John Doe?”
“Had I found a solution I would have been applying that, rather than gathering blankets for dunderheads.”
“Harry, I was wondering if you would like to continue our experimentation tonight?”
I dare not look at my father. He thinks I don't know he's got copies of my maths and history books underneath his bed.
“But I didn’t know you were a virgin! You didn’t tell me until after we had sex too!”
Harry stood up quickly, his knees bumping into the table, making the cups clink on their saucers. Snape brought down his paper and looked at Harry disapprovingly, but Harry ignored it. He turned, ready to race outside.
“I can and I will. Snape I need you to be our bonder. Can you do that?”
Harry began to push Draco up the stairs, staring at his reddened bum the whole way.
“What was that again? I think I misheard you.”
Harry groaned internally;
“We’re outside!”
Harry put an arm around Draco and spoke into his hair.
“Andromeda, what happened?”
Darco moved his hands to the back of Harry’s arse and pulled in forward. Getting the message Harry began to rock. It felt so good. Nothing had prepared him for this. Ron had said that sex was good, but this was better than good, this was heaven.
'I'm fine, Dean, really. Just need a moment to clear my head.'
“Natural.”
The owl hooted in response.
"The Sorting Hat went missing right before the Sorting itself. All attempts at retrieving it have failed. There was no magical signature left. I checked too. I've spoken with a few students, including Dylan Quaglia, and they all seem not to know what happened to the Sorting Hat, or they aren't telling me. Headmistress McGonagall believes it to be the work of The Green Rebellion but I have yet to see any evidence to support that. No one will speak to me about The Green Rebellion. The students here are very tight-lipped. But I did receive an owl today that advised me to attend this morning's breakfast and the password for the student newsletter
"He can help. He went through almost the exact same thing before he started teaching here."
I must look like a daft drunkard, but my body worked faster than my mind and right now seems as good a time as any to bring up the whole
The King stared longingly up at the released bird, but shook his head. Draco released another cage, and then another, and then another.
Harry had been envisioning Draco Malfoy’s trio of freckles, so it took him a few seconds to process what Kreacher had said. “Did you say bark?”
“I demanded this suit. I like this suit.”
Harry woke with a start, his body sweating profusely, his thoughts whirling about his head. He jumped out of his leather chair, his neck pinching from lying in the same position for too long. It was still dark outside, but Harry could see the tip of the sun poking out in the horizon.
"No, Teddy. No, I ... I believe I have another solution."
"It's a pencil pusher's job."
Harry twisted a biro around his fingers. “Katie, stay out of it,” he replied teasingly.
"I can smell your cheap cologne from here. It's the same from yesterday. Did you shower?"
“Don’t you recognize me, Harry?”
It was early. The sun was barely peeking out from the horizon. Snape was an early riser too, and was inside making the morning tea.
'You saved me, Harry,' Dean said. He lifted his eye-patch, showing the gaping hole that was left. 'Shiraq did this to me, and would have done the other eye, had you not stormed his stronghold and rescued me. You could have died, but you didn't care. You just cared about making sure I was safe. No matter what Harry, I would follow you anywhere. No matter what.'
There is a silence. Every muscle in my body loosens as relief floods through my body. So he's not here to arrest my father. I thank every god and goddess I can think of that I know, and some made-up ones, and promise them all my left kidney if they ever need it.
Malfoy gave him a strange look. “Was this before or after he was killed?”
'Fail to recognize me, then, Potter?'
Luna, suddenly appearing from behind the fore mast, stepped up to Padma, her tiny stature reaching only Padma's leather covered breasts. 'Why were you searching South America? The Chupacabra lives in a shack on the east side of Texas, eating up all the goats on a nearby farm. We reported on it a few years ago in
But there was one thing Snape pressed Harry about constantly.
“He was worried about me.”
Draco pulled his suit jacket off completely and folded it neatly next to him. He uncuffed his shirt and rolled up the sleeves. Once done, he relaxed back against the wall, his feet still touching Harry’s.
Harry closed his eyes in shame. Of course. It all made sense now. Of course Draco was acting out of character. Of course he wasn't complaining about his impossible task. Because he had never planned on completing it.
“Draco, how did you know those spells?”
“How did you know you were gay?”
And yet, in the midst of their coupling, his feelings had turned into an overwhelming ache of despair. Why, when they had just discovered each other, discovered that there was more than just an old schoolyard rivalry, was Draco then to be taken away from him?
Each tree was different, from the very large trees that seemed as big as a small cottage, to the gnarly old trees whose branches slumped to the ground. The ground was soft as they walked; the smell overwhelmingly earthy.
Draco looked down at Harry's penis, his long thick penis that still looked massive at half mast.
“What did you mean?”
"When I eleven, I showed up at Hogwarts not knowing anything about magic or the wizarding world. I kept waiting for the moment that I would wake up and return home realizing it was all a dream, but that never happened."
Harry frowned.
The man continued, scratching his armpit. “Went to school together in Little Whinging for a while, but then his family sent him to a correctional school named Bulldog or Brutus or something like that. Not sure why, the kid was a billy no-mate, stuck to himself. His cousin, though, was a real git. Used to shake down the younger ones for their lunch money.”
Finn, grabbing the smallest and fastest broom, zoomed off into the air first, flying in circles above the rest, eager to begin. The small man was practically bouncing with excitement on his broom, his feet swaying in the wind.
They left Teddy’s room quietly and began to head downstairs.
Snorting, my father ruffles my hair before pulling me into a tight hug. “I don't like when you call yourself a Squib.”
And yes, he was calling Malfoy “Draco” now. It was hard not to when all he ever heard from Teddy was
“Both.”
'Listen, Harry, I know you worry about me. I see the way you look at me. At first I thought it was just my injuries, and trust me, Harry, we do need to talk about that some day. But today, I think I sensed something different.'
“Panicked! Panicked would be perhaps just saying that I was working on a project for Teddy’s birthday and it was a secret and leave it at that! How in the fifth level of hell did it end up being some sob story that even Lavender Brown, the same girl who believed that Ron Weasley enjoyed being called Won-Won, wouldn’t buy! And did you realize, in your great wisdom, that you just implied that you and I, that you and I, oh I can’t even say it.”
“Harry, I think we may want to discuss this a little later.”
Harry smiled and lay down on the bed, attempting to take a nap before his tour with Draco.
Harry had reached the end of the line. The last little girl with pigtails and wide eyes. She was bouncing on her shoes, unsure if she was excited to be sorted or scared that she would be the only one not included in the Slytherin house.
The boy from the article. The one that didn't want to be sorted into Slytherin for fear that the friends he would make would disappear once he was sorted with the snakes.
Harry knocked on the door before opening it slowly, wanting to prolong the anticipation of seeing all the smooth pale skin.
By this point, my headache has begun to clear, and with it the voices start to make sense. Had I thought logically I would have realized towering above me were my father and Mr. Potter, but it is hard to think logically after a brush with certain peril and death. I want to yell out that I'm okay, a bit scared, but generally all right, but I can't move, can't speak.
I was eight when my father and I moved to the Muggle world.
, wasn’t exactly what he expected to see on a badge, but the phrase was quite catchy.
Or the next.
was ripped. But to be honest, I’m not sure it would have made a difference. A tree house is the perfect birthday gift for Teddy. It seems like something a child should have. So, if you wouldn’t mind, I'll have that consultation, please. Afterwards I will pay your fee.”
No one mentions my growing up in a closet, crying myself to sleep and befriending the tiny insects that crawled around with me on my dirty cot. No one mentions the death, the rotting corpses that littered Hogwarts that night. No one mentions the blood that ran down my face or the complete impotence I felt at not being able to save everyone.
interesting. According to my mother, the
"Oh, Hufflepuff for sure."
The dirt blasted away until there was a large crater like hole, much larger than any of them would have been able to create in such a short time.
~ * ~
Not quite awake, Harry would push the hairs out of his mouth and adjust Draco's body to fit more comfortably on top of him. This usually caused Draco to hold on tighter and mumble something incoherently at Harry, like 'pancakes' or 'buy me a lolly'.
A typical English woman, Mrs Granger had her hair up in a frizzy bun, pencils sticking out this way and that. She was wearing an apron that said, “Kiss the Cook,” that looked completely unused. So much so the creases from the packaging still showed.
From then on Harry would get up, get dressed, and head over to Draco's cottage. Snape would greet him gruffly and threaten him in different and descriptive ways until Harry nodded that he understood and made his way to Draco.
He leaves my father and I alone in the hallway. Without thinking, I start toeing my socks. My father pointedly stares at me until I reach down and yank the socks off my feet.
‘Draco!’ Harry yelled. He mounted his broom and began to fly toward him.
“Oh, maybe he was getting off on it.”
The End.
“Oh, okay.”
Harry shook his head and returned to observing his surroundings. While exciting, Harry still needed to keep a look out for dangers around them. The
“What do you mean? Where are you?”
"Tonight, at 6:23. I advise you take your Invisibility Cloak and just observe. No need for you to go half cocked into a room full of students. We really don't know what's going to happen in that room. It could be a sing-a-long for all we know."
Mrs Granger held on tighter. “Stop it, Harry. You know me. You went to school with my daughter. We had you over for Christmas a few years ago. You and your nice young man.”
Draco laughed, not opening the shower curtain again, but remaining in the bathroom.
My father looks wistfully into the dining room. I can't imagine what he thinks Harry is doing in there, but I'm sure he's stuck his bear paw into the middle of the pie and is stuffing the mounds of baked apples into his mouth.
Harry grinned back and patted Finn on the shoulder.
"I said no. The Sorting Hat does not need to be found."
“And you're an arse.”
With a twinkle in his eye, imagining Draco's very
"You're right, oh great detective Auror. The newsletter is printed here. It's a school project."
'The ward goes around the castle, up and around. But there is one place it does not go. And that is under! There is a small hole here and I was able to push my hand through it.'
Both Lestrange and Nott began to laugh.
My feet begin to bounce on the floor.
He knew that sometimes Draco just needed to sit in silence, and that talking would only make things worse. He had gotten pretty good at reading Draco's moods and anticipating his needs, so he figured all he needed right now was company. The two of them sat in silence for a long time.
"Harry, you're awake!" Hermione appeared beside him, helping him get upright. Ron came around the other side of the bed, followed by Neville.
"Hey, hey." Potter stopped them just outside the door to the classroom, everyone else having already gone in. "If you ever need to talk to someone, I'm here. I know this is new and all, but I really want this to work."
Harry kissed him on the forehead, then gently laid his head back down. He got up and retrieved their wands and the cloak, stowing them away, before returning to Draco and carefully scooping him up bridal style.
"I can't –"

"I had a good time, really," Draco assured him. "I guess I just got a bit overwhelmed."
"It's okay, I've got you…" he said as they made their way over to the bed. Harry settled him down and even pulled the covers up, then went to grab the water pitcher from the nearby desk. He returned with a full glass of water, which he handed to Draco. "Drink." Once he had drained the glass, Harry refilled it and passed it back. When he was done, Harry set the glass aside and sat on the edge of the bed.
Harry tried to get to him, but quickly realised that his hands were tied behind his back with rope. He tugged at the bonds, the remnants of the cruciatus curse sending sharp shooting pains through his arms and torso.
"Nooo!" Draco really wanted to point out that he sounded like a child, but kept his mouth shut. "Why, did something happen?" Draco tried to keep his face blank but was apparently unsuccessful. "What happened, Malfoy?"
Draco gave him a small peck. "Thank you."
That made Draco more curious than ever, but he kept quiet, waiting for him to continue.
Harry turned his head to look at Draco, and their eyes met. "If I calm you down during a panic attack, will you bring me back to the present if my PTSD hits?"
Malfoy didn't respond, only furrowed his brow. Since he wasn't immediately shutting him down, Harry saw that as an opportunity and stuck out his hand, taking them back to all those years ago when they had first met.
Draco's head snapped back towards him. "Wait, is this going to bring up bad memories?"
"Basically, they raised me to believe that magic was terrible, and that being different in general was terrible, and so it took me a little while to come to terms with the fact that they had been feeding me lies my whole life."
What better time than now, Harry thought, to bury the hatchet. Maybe they would never really be friends, but if he didn't try, he would never know. And he didn't want to leave someone to suffer on their own, even if it was Malfoy.
He kissed him deeply, hands clutching at his shirt, and Harry responded immediately. Draco tugged at his waist, pulling him closer, and felt Harry arch into him. Harry's fingers were in Draco's hair, tugging at the stands, until Harry pulled away and flipped them in a heartbeat, so that Draco was against the wall.
Harry scoffed, putting on a bit of bravado as he said, "Highly unlikely, Professor."
Draco didn't know where he was headed, he had simply felt cooped up in his room and needed some air. And then, of course, Potter had cornered him with a proposal – that they start over. Draco didn't want to admit it, but the gesture meant so much to him that if he hadn't made a quick getaway after shaking Potter's hand, he might've done something stupid.
"I know why you did it, Draco. I know it was to protect me."
Was Draco flirting with him? Harry had to turn back to look up through the branches of the tree above him, tearing his eyes away from those depthless grey ones before he started to overthink things. He would only drive himself crazy.
"I think I might call it night."
McGonagall, Dumbledore and a few other teachers arrived some time later, bringing with them Ministry of Magic authorities. They confirmed the Death Eaters were dead, found the Slytherin seventh years elsewhere in the building, and recovered Harry and Draco's wands.
"Sounds good to me."
"It didn’t feel like that long."
"Not even your boyfriend?"
Harry broke away with a grin. "You wish."
"Draco," Pansy replied.
"Protective now, aren't we?" Snyde continued to look between Harry and Draco, both disarmed and pretty much unable to defend themselves. Snyde looked like a kid on Christmas day. "And I thought my night was made when we found Malfoy. But now we have a betrayer of the Dark Lord… and the one who killed him."
Draco gave Harry's hand a grateful squeeze. They sat there for several minutes, Harry holding Draco close, until his breathing completely evened out. Eventually he raised his head to look at Harry, and he found only warmth and caring in his face.
The next week progressed in a similar manner. Draco would share his meals with the Golden Trio, sometimes also joined by Neville, or Ginny and Luna. Draco seemed to settle back into their old routine in Potions classes, confidently going about their experiments. Their study sessions, during which they were supposed to be researching more experimentation methods and ways to improve their potion, usually ended with them talking for hours instead. Draco was slowly opening up more and more to Harry, and Harry found himself doing the same for him.
Draco was apparated to the outside of an old stone castle perched on the edge of a cliff. Far below, waves crashed relentlessly against the rocks and the air tasted of salt. The building looked like it was crumbling under the weight of time and Draco was weary to go inside, but he was led in by the Death Eaters, Snyde and the other two Slytherin seventh years. He was taken to a cavernous room with a high ceiling that was open on one side, a metal railing the only thing between him and the drop to the ocean. He kept away from the edge.
"Well I think that maybe it is," Harry said, changing tactics. "Because we're friends now, aren't we? I said I would be there for you. And I understand –"
"Draco," he said softly, desperate for him to look at him.
"Yeah, it's fine with me. He was cool the other night when we had drinks, so I'm not bothered."
Draco squeezed his hand. "That's great. I think it's a wonderful idea. Props to Aberforth!"
They reluctantly pulled apart, allowing Harry to inspect the wound Draco had made. It was fairly deep, but the bleeding wasn’t as heavy anymore. He spelled the wound closed, along with the ones along his knuckles, and charmed the blood away and the mirror to repair itself.
Soon the class was set up with practice dummies for students to practice spells on, the kind of spells that you would use in a real fight if you wanted to stay alive. Harry and Draco were at the back of the group waiting for a turn, watching the bolts of colour from various spells hitting the dummies and sometimes blasting them away, or reducing them to dust. Dumbledore would simply wave his wand and the dummy would reappear good as new.
"No! Draco, don't, I'm begging you. Don't take it away.
Okay, now that these bonus chapters are up, this is all that I plan on writing for this story, so this is the end! (probably, unless I decide to add something else lol but at this point I think it's unlikely) Thank you all again so much for reading and for leaving kudos and commenting. Love you all x
"What does it say?"
Draco crossed his arms. "Get on with it, Potter."
But it didn't matter. Draco planned to avoid him as much as possible, which was made a bit more difficult by having his room right next to his, but he would manage. He would cope.
"Father," he began.
"It's not your fault." Harry took one of Draco's hands and squeezed. "Okay? I'm here for you, and I will be the next time you fall apart, and the time after that."
"Night, Malfoy."
"I think this classroom is needed for the next period," he said. "Room of Requirement?"
Her eyes softened, and she smiled as she said, "Thank you, Malfoy. That means a lot."
Defence classes had been a lot less intense in the couple of weeks since Draco had had his panic attack, and he had a feeling that Harry might've had a word with Dumbledore. He didn't mind. While he half-heartedly listened to Dumbledore, he kept sneaking glances at Harry, and he knew that Harry was doing the same to him.
Harry gave Draco an incredulous look as if to say,
TW: PTSD, self harm (mentioned).
"What was me?"
He was still undecided about whether to find Draco or not when he found himself at the bottom of the stairs to the Astronomy Tower. He took a deep breath. If Draco happened to be up to there, he would tell him, and he if he wasn't then he would leave it for now and think on it some more.
And so of course, when Draco was feeling like things might be slowly getting better, the universe had to remind him why that couldn’t be allowed to happen.
"Look, whatever happened to him, I'm sorry –"
"What?"
Hermione smiled. "I knew you'd say that. But how? Did he tell you where he was going?"
All was well.
Daughter – Medicine
"In fairness I think that Mr Potter would be better at performing some of these spells than I would," he was saying.
He left then, closing the door behind him, and Draco stayed sat in front of the fire for a long while after that.
"Would you want me to stay again?"
Draco nodded, and gave Harry a tight smile as they parted ways. Draco wandered for a bit, not really sure where he was going, until he found himself back at the top of the Astronomy Tower. He took a seat on the edge with his legs dangling over and his arms resting on the lower railing, looking out over the castle and the lake beyond. He felt the wind on his face and tried to let his feelings for Harry be carried away with it. But he couldn't let them go.
"Your choice, Malfoy."
"Yes, Harry!"
"A fair fight?" Draco's eyes were darting around frantically, and too late Harry realised he was looking for him. "Three against one?"
It was Harry. Draco could make out his blurry form though his eyelashes, on the floor across from him. Draco blinked, trying to bring him into focus, to rouse himself enough to respond. The effort almost caused him to fall back into unconsciousness – he needed Harry.
Lord Huron – The Night We Met
"Harry, what do you remember?" Hermione asked.
"Why are following me?" he asked without slowing down.
"It just never felt right. But I know what I want now." Harry turned his head just as Draco closed the space between them and captured him in a kiss. It was slow and tender, like he was showing Harry exactly what it was that he wanted. When they broke apart, Harry couldn't take his eyes of Draco's misty grey ones, content to stay like that forever. "I don't know if I'm ready to come out as gay yet though," Draco said, pulling Harry out of his daze.
He tried not to let his disappointment show as he watched Harry carefully roll his sleeve back down, and then he pulled them to their feet.
He heard the sound of someone apperating behind him and took a moment to calm his expression. He couldn't go running into his arms, or he'd never let go. Slowly he turned around.
Draco froze, except for his hand which Harry saw twitch at his pocket, a second away from grabbing his wand. Under the cloak, Harry took out his own wand. For a few strained seconds, Draco and Snyde stared each other down, neither making a move. Then Draco grabbed for his wand, but before he could raise it there was a shout of "
When Draco woke, he immediately reached out to the other side of the bed but found it empty. Bleary eyed, he lifted his head and looked around the room.
He recounted the attacks that he had suffered from a group of Slytherins since the start of the year, and Harry could feel rage bubbling up at what they'd done to Draco.
Harry opened his eyes and looked over at Draco, who was watching him curiously. "A stag."
"No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," Draco said, dropping his arm. Seemed like he was just full of apologies tonight. "I didn't mean to yell at you."
As much as Draco didn't want to let go of Harry, he was relieved to be able to have a shower and change his clothes. When their friends realised he was back he was overwhelmed with questions, and then he and Harry were asked to speak to McGonagall. They were still trying to sort out what happened with the Death Eaters and while they were relieved that Draco was alive and safe, they needed to know the details of what happened.
"I'm Harry. Harry Potter."
Potter stuck next to Draco as the group made their way over to Hogsmeade, trailing a little bit behind once again.
"I belong with them, Harry."
"Interesting, very interesting," said Snyde with a glance back at Draco, who had gotten to his feet and was nursing a cut lip. His left cheek was already swelling with a mighty bruise.
This was a concern of Draco's that they'd been over several times, but Harry was happy to reassure him every time until he no longer needed to. "Trust me, if I ask McGonagall if I can apparate in every day instead of have a room in the castle, she'll let me. The woman loves me," he added with a cheeky grin.
Harry made a snap decision, picked up his stuff and headed over to Malfoy's bench, noticing that no one else had approached him so far. "Hey," he said as he set himself up.
"Okay."
There, standing across from him, was Draco. He looked battered and beaten, but he was fully formed and corporeal. Harry blinked, and he didn’t disappear.
"No," Draco said softly. "Sirius handed this place down to you, and…" he gestured widely at the mural, "my family's here."
He looked back up to see Potter grinning, and the sight of it made Draco warm, because he had caused it. "Come on, let’s go inside."
"How about I get you some proper food?" he said instead of doing what Draco really wanted him to do. Draco only nodded. "Okay, wait here and I'll be right back."
KALEO – Way Down We Go
He continued to follow Draco down corridor after corridor, weaving his way through the quieter parts of the castle. Harry was about to suggest trying another night, when up ahead three figures rounded the corner. Draco immediately came to a halt and tensed up, and Harry stopped a safe distance behind him, still hidden under the invisibility cloak.
"Do you?"
"Probably," was Harry's only reply.
"Potter," he snarled. "What are you doing here?"
It was at one of these study sessions, however, that Harry noticed Malfoy's dark circles were returning.
After a few shuddering breaths, he watched calmly as the blood continued to drip off the side of his arm, until eventually it slowed and started to clot. Draco then whispered the healing spell that would seal the cuts but not make them disappear completely. They were there in part to cover up the Dark Mark after all.
He slipped his wand out of his own sleeve, and immediately had to deflect a curse thrown at him by Snyde. He was forced to stay on the defence with the three of them surrounding him, but they got around his defences far too quickly. He was hit in the stomach with a hex that sent him flying against the wall, hitting his head. His vision burred, and just as he tried to raise his wand again one of the boys slammed his arm back against the wall. He dropped his wand, and then he was punched in the stomach right where the hex had hit him.
"Yep, they already agreed."
"Hello, son."
Harry gave small smile as he said, "Just a little."
"But it's the truth, Harry. You know it is, you can feel it."
Draco nodded and closed his eyes for a moment. At the start of the semester, Draco might have thought that coming up with a happy memory was impossible. Perhaps that was why he had never been able to conjure a full Patronus. Now, however, he knew exactly what – or rather who – it was that made him happy. In fact, he had a surplus of memories, but he chose one and focused on it, drawing out the details.
Harry lazily opened his eyes and looked up at him, and the sight of them unimpeded by the glasses took Draco's breath away. "Depends on you."
Hand in hand they exited the room, not sparing another glance for the mural. If they had, they would have seen flecks of ash falling from the wall and swirling in the air, as Draco's image was restored by the magic of the house, whole once more.
"Yeah, right…" Harry was still a bit perplexed, but just then he noticed Draco enter the Great Hall. He called him over, indicating for him to sit down.
Draco laid his head back down on Harry's chest. "Yeah, pretty much. But I think… it was easier to sleep with you here."
Potter gave him a piercing look, and Draco felt like he was seeing straight through to that hidden part of him. "More than you know. You probably don’t know much about what being raised by my aunt and uncle was like, but… maybe one day I'll tell you, for now I'll spare you the gory details."
Draco was most definitely not okay, but he nodded. "I'll be fine." He remembered what one of the Slytherin seventh years had told him when they had first arrived at the castle: "We can only disapparate from outside the building."
"Not much. Like at all. It's like there's these huge time gaps and I think it's got something to do with Malfoy." Hermione flinched at the name, so small he almost missed it. "What aren’t you telling me?"
Ron chuckled a bit, even as his forehead creased as he wondered what Harry was going to say.
They were currently sitting at their spot by the lake, Draco lounged back with Harry's head in his lap, running his fingers through his hair. Harry's eyes were closed and his glasses dangled from a hand, a blissful look on his face. Draco admired the curves and lines of face, and with his other hand traced his lips. Under his touch, they curved into a small smile.
"Okay, good, good…" Draco wandered over to a life size dummy in the middle of a training ring. "I'm honestly surprised the fiendfyre didn't destroy the place."
"I can feel the energy of it," Harry said. "But I don't think you're reaching its full potential. You need to let that feeling come from deeper."
"Didn't realise you wanted a snog so bad," Harry said, his voice rough.
The self-loathing reared its head and threatened to drag him down into a place deep within himself that he didn’t want to explore. He dragged his wand across his arm once more to silence it.
When it finally died down, Draco captured Harry's mouth in another kiss, this one a little more passionate. Harry felt all the emotion behind it, all the words left unsaid because they understood each other right down to their cores. This was all they needed.
"We don't know if it's connected, though," she went on. "We were hoping you might be able to clear up some of the details."
Lucius Malfoy. His father.
"Okay," Draco said, letting a long breath out through his nose. He did as Harry said, trying to place himself in the memory as if he were there, and said with confidence, "
"And Harry…" Hermione said nervously. "Draco's gone."
"Is that a compliment, Malfoy?" Potter held a hand to his heart as if he was so shocked he might have a heart attack. "Why, I never would've thought!"
After a few more questions that Harry didn't have any answers to, they left him to rest and recuperate. But Harry could only lie there trying to think back on what happened. Why couldn't he remember anything? Had he even been attacked, or had he truly just drunk too much and passed out? He could barely even remember going out, and the further back he thought the more he realised there seemed to be gaps missing.
"So Pansy and Blaise will be there?"
Draco raised his head slightly, and Harry could see how much pain he was in. His face was red and blotchy with tears, and his shoulders were shaking with barely contained sobs.
Ruelle – Until We Go Down
Draco went over the message again and again in his head.
"No, Harry, you've got it all wrong." Hermione's face was pained, and she put a hand on his arm. "He was your friend."
"Draco…" Harry wanted to reach out to him, but with his hands tied behind his back all he could do was press his forehead against Draco's.
TW: PTSD and panic attacks (both mentioned).
Eventually they migrated from the booth over to the pool table, and currently Weasley and Longbottom were playing while some of the others cheered them on. Draco was stood nearby with Potter and Granger, and they had been chatting about their Potions projects. When they finished off their drinks, Potter volunteered to grab them some more and headed off to the bar, leaving him alone with Granger.
"No, it's putting you in danger. I won't do that."
"Father," Draco started to say.
Every muscle in his body froze. He didn't want to dare turn around in case he had imagined it. But slowly, he spun, one hand still clutching the railing like it was an anchor.
Draco was discovering that Potter was actually really easy to talk to, and even easier to open up to, which was a scary thought. There were many things that Draco was ashamed of, and there were certain truths about him that he'd never shared with anyone and didn't know how because he had pushed that part of him down so deep. That identity was buried right at the back of his mind, the bottom of his soul, and if he knew that if he dug it up it would change everything.
The sun was hovering over the ocean now, casting the ancient castle in soft gold light. Harry looked towards the cliffs, searching the waves crashing below. His chest was tight, and he wanted to throw himself into the water to look for him, to bring back his body.
Satisfied, Draco left the bathroom, not daring to look back up at the mirror again.
"Harry, we've been here for about four hours."
"I'm sort of just discovering who I am, and who I can be now that the war is over, when I'm no longer the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived," he had said to her. "I feel like that part of my life is over, and you were a big part of that time for me but… I think I need something else."
"Yep. Well, I've never been with a guy but I'm pretty sure. No, definitely sure. Pretty definitely sure."
"What could you possibly have to say to me?"
!" Snyde went soaring backwards, landing hard. He started to get straight back up, however, as the other two recovered from their shock and took their wands back out. They immediately had to defend against the onslaught of hexes and jinxes that Harry threw at them, but once Snyde re-joined them they quickly went on the offensive. Harry was pushed back, until one of them got in a lucky disarming shot and his wand flew from his hand. Snyde swept his wand in a wide arc, and Harry was thrown against the wall and held there, immobilised.
Hermione only took his hand and squeezed, letting him know she was there. She held onto him as he finally let go of the tears, allowing himself to feel the pain of the loss. Once the sobs started, he couldn't stop, and Hermione stayed by him until exhaustion took him once again.
"Why don't you heal them completely?"
"No, but… I can try sending him a message."
They spent the scenic train ride catching Harry up on the latest mishaps at the Burrow, since Harry had spent the last week and a half at Grimmauld Place after breaking up with Ginny. He had realised over the course of the summer that they just weren't right for each other, and around the same time Harry had also realised he was bisexual. Ginny was the first person he told, when he explained his feelings and why he thought they should separate.
Draco hated himself more than ever in that moment, and as he got to his feet there was only one thought on his mind.
Sorry for being a couple days late on uploading this chapter! But I'm sure this one is what you've all been waiting for, so enjoy ;)
Harry pulled back and held Draco by the shoulders so he could look him in the eye. Draco was only about an inch or two taller than him, but Harry's glasses had slipped down his nose a little, so he had to tilt his head up to look at him properly.
"Because I said I wanted to talk."
"Malfoy?"
He realised he couldn't breathe properly, hadn't been breathing properly – or maybe he had been holding his breath the entire time. He tried to suck in rasping breaths, quicker and quicker, but it only made him more panicked.
Harry hadn't expected that, would've thought it more likely that the Astronomy Tower would hold too many bad memories for Malfoy. But he supposed it made sense if nightmares that made him dwell on the past would draw him to a place of such significance.
With a jolt he stood up and made his way to the doors, knowing that everyone had to be watching him, but he just had to get out of there. Just needed a distraction so that he could breathe again. Once the doors had closed behind him and he stood in the entrance hall once more, he stood still as he tried to catch his breath, pushing away the memories that threatened to bubble to the surface and strangle him. After a moment, he regained a little bit of his composure.
He debated whether he should go over or not. Would now be the right time to say something? He didn't even know what headspace Draco was in at the moment. He listened quietly for any sort of sign, but then there was a loud smash and the sound of shattering glass. That answered that question.
Draco closed his eyes and held onto him, feeling the weight of his presence, the strength of his arms. He listened to the sound of Harry's voice, gently guiding him through it, until his breathing evened out and he stopped shaking. Exhausted, he sagged against him, and Harry laid them down with his arms still around Draco. He put his head on Harry's chest and his arm around his waist, the steady rise and fall of his breathing soothing him. He was safe. Harry was safe.
Billie Eilish – everything i wanted
"Please don't ever let me go," he whispered, his words almost carried away on the wind.
Once he felt better again, he realised that someone was watching him. Looking over to the doors to the castle, he saw someone he had come to terms with not seeing here this year at all. Draco Malfoy. Next to him stood his luggage and his mother, Narcissa. What Harry's attention was drawn to, however, was how gaunt Malfoy looked. He defiantly had his shoulders back and his chin high, but Harry could see even from this distance that there were deep circles under his eyes and his cheeks were hollow. His hair was unkempt, without its usual gel (which Harry had always thought was over the top anyway) or even a comb through.
"I think McGonagall would have a fit if you two started doing potions experiments at the school. Slughorn would probably love it though."
Noah Kahan – Hurt Somebody (with Julia Michaels)
"Of course not, I fully expect to be working together on this one."
None of it made sense. He only wanted the hollow feeling in his chest to go away.
"Definitely. Maybe we can even be friends, I mean I'm optimistic. But if that's going to happen, I think we should go by first names."
"I'm not entirely sure, but I have a theory." Draco took another tentative step forward. "I think when I took the cruciatus curse for you, and then you took it for me, it created a kind of shield."
As Hermione and Ron waved Neville over, Harry stood up and headed over to the Slytherin table. Zabini had his arm around Parkinson's shoulders, and when he caught their eyes they both frowned slightly.
Draco nodded. "Okay. I promise."
Draco reached out and took his hand again. "Then don't. Stay."
Hozier – Like Real People Do
It was at dinner one night when Draco didn't show again that he voiced his concerns to Ron and Hermione.
He was gone.
Thank you so much for all the support on this so far! Also just a reminder to please listen to the song for each chapter, I recommend listening while reading. :)
"I wish you were here," he whispered, hanging his head.
"She's been taking it surprisingly well," Ron began, "I honestly think that I was more upset about it than she was."
"Draco…" Harry put his hands over Draco's, careful not to apply too much pressure. "Please let go. Please drop the glass."
"I also thought that he seems a bit withdrawn," Hermione said.
Harry was about to throw the cloak off, when Snyde and the others pocketed their wands. Maybe he didn't need to reveal himself after all.
They pushed the doors open and walked into the same room that they had once trained in, when they were a part of Dumbledore's Army in fifth year. Except in the middle sat two comfy looking armchairs and a coffee table.
"Hermione, thank you," Harry said earnestly, hugging her.
"Where do you go?"
"Draco Malfoy," Harry said with feigned shock, "choosing to be at Hogwarts when he doesn’t have to? Outrageous."
"I know. But none of that matters now." He held out his hand. "Draco come home with me."
Harry’s sudden intake of breath was louder than he expected, and he stepped back behind the corner. He heard the swish of Malfoy’s robes as he spun around, and in a panic Harry quickly started towards the exit before he could be spotted.
Every time he closed his eyes, Harry saw the blast hitting Draco and exploding back. When he couldn't take it anymore, he got up and made his way out of the infirmary.
"Scared, Potter?" Draco held out a hand to pull Harry up, and Harry looked at it for a second before taking it and allowing Draco to hoist him up.
Snyde only laughed. "That's alright, there are other uses for you."
Draco hadn't realised how much the ropes were supporting him until his wrists were free, and he fell into Harry's arms. "Are you okay? I'm here."
Draco relished the feel of Harry's body against his, and he wanted more, but Harry pulled back as though he too knew they were reaching the limits of what they could do in an alleyway. They both panted, still holding onto each other. Draco saw Harry's gaze flick up to his hair.
"Yes, there is. Do you remember what I told you in the Room of Requirement? That you deserve the world. Because you do, Draco. You have to keep going, if not for yourself then for me. Because I need you." His voice cracked on the last word. It was true, he needed Draco, more than anything – and he couldn’t lose anyone else.
"Don't!" shouted Draco, surging forward. The two others grabbed his arms and held him back, but he struggled against them.
"Nope. You can’t get rid of me that easily."
Draco thought for a moment on whether that meant he was included in the people that mattered most to Potter, but decided that that was just wishful thinking.
"I love –"
Harry thought for a moment that Malfoy was going to send a snide remark his way, but then he was approached by Filch and led upstairs, presumably to the new dormitory. Perhaps their childhood rivalry would finally be put to rest this year. Harry wondered what that would mean for them as he took a deep breath and re-entered the Hall.
"Yes!" Harry didn’t bother to hide his excitement.
The shout came from down the alleyway toward the street, and Harry's wand flew from his pocket and out of reach. He frantically looked back for Draco, whether to make sure he was gone or for help, he didn't know, but he was already back inside. Harry was alone and unarmed, and stalking toward him were the three Slytherins, flanked by two robed figures.
!" he cried.
He was sitting on the bathroom floor with his back against the wall. The mirror above the sink had a fist-sized crater in the middle of it, the glass shattering out from it and pieces littering the sink and the floor. Draco's knuckles were cut and bleeding, and he held a large glass shard against the Dark Mark. The edges were cutting his fingers, and he wasn't slicing the point but rather just pushing down right on the skull of the tattoo, causing blood to well up and drip down his arm. And there was so much, so much blood.
"Did you say we were coming?"
At that point they had reached the Three Broomsticks, and the group found a large booth inside and ordered a round of butterbeers. Draco sat at one end, across from Potter and next to Granger, Weasley on her other side. The two had their hands joined on the table, but Granger regularly turned to him to make conversation as the others were chatting, and she was so nice to him that Draco wondered how he could have ever thrown slurs at her. He almost felt like he didn't deserve her kindness, but she somehow made him feel worthy of it. Potter also frequently included him in conversations, but mostly he listened as everyone chatted, catching up on what had happened over the summer and recounting old memories. Every now and then something to do with the war would be brought up, and a few nervous glances would be thrown his way. But Potter or Granger (and even Weasley once) would quickly change the subject.
Malfoy looked at him fully then, a slight frown on his face as though he were calculating. "You really mean this whole starting over thing then?"
Draco heard Harry sigh next to him, and asked quietly, "What?"
The two left the classroom and headed straight for the hallway where the door was concealed. This time, it opened for them immediately, and Draco was once again struck with awe at the magnificent space. There was definitely a part of him that wished he could have been here in fifth year, a part of Dumbledore's Army preparing to fight against Voldemort. If only he had known back then how much everything would change.
"What?" asked Harry, looking back at him and noticing a mischievous glint in his eye. Harry was honestly thrilled that he was able to see this side of Draco at all.
"Draco?"
gnash – i hate u, i love u feat. Olivia O’Brien
"No!" he shouted, and Lucius turned his wand on Draco. Draco knew he should be feeling the adrenaline of fight or flight kicking in, but all he could feel in that moment was relief that Lucius was now focusing on him instead of Harry.
"Go to hell," Harry said, trying to muster all his bravado.
Taking out his wand, he whispered a curse as he drew it across a space on his arm, the tip of his wand acting as a blade. Blood welled up, and Draco let out a sigh as he watched it slowly drip into the sink. Looking up at his reflection, he hated what he saw. He was a shadow of his former self, he knew that.
He took a few steps closer, but Malfoy only turned back towards the sink, clutching his bleeding arm with his other hand. "It’s none of your business," he hissed.
He felt Potter step closer to him, and then his arms were wrapping around Draco's neck. He leaned into the embrace, wrapping his arms around his waist to hug him back, and enveloping himself in his warmth. It was comfort like he'd never known before, and it felt like home. Draco clung to him like he was a lifeline and buried his face in his shoulder just as a sob racked uncontrolled through his body. Potter only held him tighter, one hand on the back of his neck, fingers in his hair.
M83 – Outro
"Doesn't matter, really." Snyde sniffed and took a casual step forward. Draco saw his wand shoot out of his sleeve and into his hand. "But you're a traitor to the Dark Lord, so you're as good as anyone else to blame for it."
"I was supposed to protect you. This is my fault."
"I… wasn't in the best headspace and I didn't know what it would show me, or if it was even operational."
Draco only laughed some more, and Harry couldn't stop staring at his lips. He felt a flush creeping up his face, and quickly turned away. "I think our free period is probably over by now, we should get going."
Draco only raised his eyebrows, surprised to hear Potter using their first names. It took Draco a few minutes to respond, but he replied, "It's not your fault."
Thank you all so much for all the support on this story! This is the final chapter that I had written, but I'm thinking now that I might write an epilogue just to wrap up some other plot lines like what Draco and Harry are going to do after they graduate and where their mental health is at that stage (also would it be a terrible idea to end the epilogue with 'All was well'? I know the epilogue in the books has it's issues but I love that final line). I also had an idea to write the chapter plummet from Draco's perspective instead of Harry's so you can see both sides of how it happened. Would you guys be interested in those two ideas as bonus chapters? Let me know, and I'll work on them when I can but it might be a while before they're posted.
"Harry, it's a good plan –"
When he reached the Great Hall, he headed straight for the Slytherin table but gave it a quick sweep of his eyes as he walked over. No sign of those seventh years, but there was something else. One too many people were looking up at him as he passed. In fact, there were a lot of eyes following him from around the room. Surely they hadn't roughed up his face as well and he'd just been too dazed to remember, right?
"You said yourself we need to find out what they're up to, and if we do then we can tell McGonagall." Harry looked like he was about to protest some more, but Draco silenced him with a kiss. "I promise I'll be careful."
"There will be no curfew forced upon you, and you will be allowed to venture into Hogsmeade as you wish, no need for supervised weekend trips and permission notes."
Potter. He had seen him downstairs, just outside the Great Hall, looking like he was coming down from a panic attack. Draco was all too familiar with panic attacks, but he wondered why Potter of all people would be overwhelmed enough to have to step outside and calm down. Surely, he would rather be basking in the glory that came with being the saviour of the Wizarding World.
Harry shifted on his feet a bit. "Not today Professor."
He gathered up his courage and finally asked, "What are your plans for the holidays?"
Finally, he broke through the ropes and Draco collapsed. Harry caught him under the arms. "Are you okay? I'm here."
"No reason," Harry said, readjusting his glasses and looking back down at his notebook.
"Draco, no," Harry pleaded. "Don't do this. You don't have to join them; we can fight them off together." He didn't know how, but he didn't say that. He only wanted Draco to come back to him.
"I still think this is a terrible idea."
Harry led the way, thinking of ways he could make Draco laugh again.
"No, I saw you weren't okay and I got you out of there."
"Harry, you don't understand. It's my father," Draco said, his voice cracking. "He's out. He's here."
He half walked, half ran up the stairs when he reached he tower, and felt a wave of relief when he saw Draco sitting on the edge. "There you are," he puffed, a little out of breath.
"No, it's not." He drew in a shaky breath. "It was my dumb idea, remember?"
them all.
"Now, we're here to negotiate, Malfoy."
"Wait, what?"
Hermione seemed to relax a bit as she considered it. "You're right," she said. "He can't redeem himself if we don't even give him a chance."
Of course, Ron and Hermione were returning as well, along with Neville, Luna and Ginny, as even though they had attended last year, their education had been greatly disrupted. Harry was ecstatic to have all his friends back together, and even though it would be difficult returning to Hogwarts, it was where he wanted to be.
Draco cursed at him and opened the door. Potter walked right in and turned back around to face him. He closed the door and tossed his bread on the desk nearby, resigned to letting it go stale for now. Potter looked at it in confusion. "Was that supposed to be your dinner?"
Harry was getting to his feet, leaning heavily on the wall. "Then let us go. If you have no use for us the what's the point in keeping us here?"
!" He looked over Harry to see his father advancing towards them, his wand trained on Harry. "
Draco frowned. "I sent my mother a letter, and she said she wants me to come back to the Manor. I don't think I can do that though."
Harry was sat at his desk in his room, studying in an attempt to take his mind off things. Or at least he was trying to study. He'd just about given up when he heard the door next to his – Draco’s door – open and shut again. He must've finally come back.
He cared about Draco. He really, truly did. And over the last month he had let himself grow closer to him, and now there was a new depth to his feelings, and he didn't know what to do about it. Should he tell Draco? Try to explain? Or would it only make things worse and push him away further? Perhaps he had already ruined any chance they might have had.
Harry backed towards the courtyard.
"Pfft," was all Ron said after that.
"I think you have the wrong door, Potter," Malfoy said with a sneer, but there was none of the usual malice behind it. That was a good sign, right? In fact, he sort of looked… tired. The circles under his eyes were so much more pronounced close up, and his eyes looked hazy.
Hermione nodded as if she'd been waiting for this. "Okay."
Draco felt he was losing track of what was real.
He felt Harry tense, then shout, "Draco!" and spin them around.
Harry took a deep breath. "I'm bi."
"Then let us go," Harry said, using the wall to push himself to his feet. "If you have no use for us then what's the point in keeping us here?"
Draco gulped down a few more deep breaths, and then his shoulders collapsed in a sob, his head hanging forward. Harry moved to his side, putting one arm around him and pulling him close while the other still held onto Draco's hands. Draco realised that they were sitting against a wall in a deserted corridor, probably not far from the classroom.
Tearing his eyes away, he locked his gaze with Harry's, who was being blocked by a Death Eater. Draco knew that Harry would do anything to get to him, but he couldn't see a way for them both to get out of this alive.
Harry knew this was important, and he wanted to make sure he didn't scare Malfoy into closing himself off again. So he went with honesty. "Yeah, sometimes."
As soon as they disappeared around the corner, the binding spell lifted and Harry fell to his hands and knees. He crawled over to where Draco lay and rolled him over, a sob heaving through his body at the sight of him. He was pale as a sheet, almost grey, and his lip and cheek were swollen and dripping blood. His eyes fluttered, and he let out a small groan of pain. Harry cushioned his head with his hand and tilted his face towards him.
Potter nodded to his friends to carry on ahead, and then walked alongside Draco at a slower pace. "What's up?"
Draco couldn't form words, couldn't find the strength he needed to say what he had to say. Harry raised a hand to Draco's cheek, and Draco leaned into it, his eyes slipping shut and a tear escaping.
"I don't need his help."
"Thank you," Draco said.
On the way to class, when Draco spotted the Golden Trio, he saw his opportunity.
Lewis Capaldi – Bruises
"You're good at potions, right?"
TW: self harm, suicidal thoughts.
Harry's hair was whipped back and forth in the harsh sea wind. He looked out at the water, then up at the crumbling castle above them, taking it all in. They were on a secluded section of the beach along from the cliffs, walled in by great mounds of rock that provided little shelter from the wind and spray, but it was the best Draco could come up with.
Harry flipped it to face Hermione.
"Don't touch me!" Draco held his wrist to his chest, feeling the cuts there as if they were burning. But then he noticed Potter's face, his mouth open and eyes wide.
"Go fuck yourself."
"Great. Love the enthusiasm," Harry said with a double thumbs up before walking away, thinking that it definitely could've gone worse.
"She's got a point," said Ron.
Harry sounded like he was in pain just seeing what Draco had done to himself, and Draco wanted nothing more than to make that pain go away. But he could only watch as Harry took out his wand and performed a gentle healing spell, sealing the wounds closed and reducing the redness. When he was done, he kept holding onto his arm, and Draco could tell he wanted to say something.
"Don't ever do that to me again."
After a long time, he spoke, saying the two words he had been most afraid to voice but knowing that it was the truth. "He's dead."
"Where are we going? We've still got drinks," Harry said.
"I – I'm sorry," he said, panic flooding his brain, and then he was fleeing from the room. Leaving Harry standing there.
Harry jumped out of his chair and ran out of his room, over to Draco's door. He pounded on the wood, then tried the door handle, but it was locked.
"Nope."
Draco was cut off as Harry crashed into him, hugging him tight. Draco's wand lowered, but the Patronus remained, circling above them. Harry pulled back, and they stood there, still holding each other but neither closing the distance. A thousand thoughts raced through Draco's mind in an instant and with the force of a tidal wave, the fear he had let go of crashed back into him. The Patronus flickered out as Draco took a step back. Hurt flashed in Harry's eyes, and Draco faltered. What was he doing? He was going to ruin this.
"Alright, alright, just don't forget that I'm right here if you need."
"Harry…"
"Well, I'd very much like it if you came. Hermione is pushing for house unity among the eighth years, so I thought this is a good way to start off the year." Harry knew he was using Hermione's desire for house unity to cover up the fact that he just really wanted Malfoy to come, but hey, whatever worked.
Draco smiled and squeezed back. After a few moments, Harry let go with a sigh. "Will you be okay?" Draco gave a weak nod, but that didn’t reassure him. "I… I don't really want to leave you like this."
"Aberforth!" Ron said excitedly beside him, and Harry realised of course,
Mallrat – Charlie
As soon as Harry saw Malfoy get up and speed walk for the doors, he followed him. Through corridors and up staircases, seemingly at random, Harry followed him. He couldn't believe how terrible that article had been and couldn't even begin to know how difficult this was for Malfoy. All he could do was be there for him, as he had said he would be.
"Are you sure? You understand that you deserve the world, and nothing less?"
Draco spent the rest of the day hunting down Pansy and Blaise between classes. He wasn't looking forward to this chat, as he'd kind of been avoiding them so far. But they had once been his friends, and if Potter could make an effort to be friends with someone like him, then he could make an effort to reconcile with his own friends.
When he woke in the morning, Draco was still curled up to his side. For a few minutes, he just savoured the feeling, wishing that it could be like this all the time. He tentatively raised a hand to run through Draco's hair, but Draco stirred. Bleary eyed, the blond looked up at him.
Snyde raised his wand to point it directly in Harry's face.
"Malfoy!" boomed the tall one in front from the other end of the hall. Draco stood his ground with his chin high, though Harry could tell by the slight shifting of his feet that he'd rather run. He wondered what these guys could have done to Draco to make him so scared he had nightmares, and the ideas that popped into his head made his blood boil with anger. If only he could reveal himself now and
"There's no point!" he screamed, and Harry felt his heart breaking.
"No, I should be able to do it, and I do have some experience with bringing back memories." Harry thought back to last year, when Hermione had taken her parents’ memories and sent them to Australia to protect them. She had returned their memories when it was safe, and that was why Harry knew that if anyone could help him, it was her. "It's a complex process, is all."
Malfoy closed his eyes, that crease in his brow stubbornly remaining. "I get them every night. And sometimes they feel so real that I forget that the war is over, that he's dead, and I'm safe. And when I wake up, I don't want to go back to sleep because I don't want to feel that way again. I don't want to see his face again." He took in a deep breath and opened his eyes but still looked towards to the window. "Sometimes I end up going for a walk so just so that I don't fall back asleep."
Draco sighed, his eyes downcast. "I suppose I should tell you."
Draco looked back up at him, grey eyes meeting green. "Would you want to?"
Draco chuckled and kissed him again, unable to get enough. It wasn't until after the sun had set that they finally came down from the Astronomy Tower.
me? What makes you think that you have any right to –"
"I don't know what I feel."
"We only want a little revenge for our imprisoned fathers," said Snyde. "And our fallen Lord."
Draco pointed with his other hand to the spot on his wrist. Harry brushed a thumb over it, feather light. Draco looked up at him and saw that there was a tear running down Harry's cheek. Without thinking, he reached up and brushed it away, and his hand lingered on his cheek as Harry looked up and their eyes met. They were so close, their breaths mingling, and all Draco wanted to do was close the distance. But Harry shifted back slightly and looked away, and Draco let his hand fall.
"However," McGonagall continued, "these privileges can be revoked if they are abused." The students quieted down at that. "Finally, your dorms. Along with the rebuilding of the castle, we have constructed a separate tower for eighth years so that you may have your own space, and each dorm is a private bedroom with its own en suite. You also have a shared common room, but you are still welcome in your houses' common rooms. That will be all, you may now join the feast."
Harry stood motionless for a long time, staring at the railing that Draco had gone over. Only when the sky started to lighten did he move, finding a Death Eater's wand and summoning a Patronus. He told it his message and sent it to Hogwarts. Then he collapsed to his knees and waited.
"You need to explore your identity," she had replied. "I understand."
“You know she thought that story was complete bullshit.”
He reached out to Harry with his free hand, his face triumphant. Harry grabbed hold and pulled Draco atop his broom.
"Harry, we all love you, but you wouldn't notice your own nose if it wasn't screwed on your face. Don't worry about it. I'm coming tomorrow. Tell the house-elves to supply me with a set of dumbbells."
Harry, still attempting to find the source of the voice, decided that it was his turn to try his hand at negotiations.
My mother called my grandmother ‘weak,’ and that was the last time she came with us to my grandparents’ house.
“Get out.”
Maybe he should tell Draco he was a virgin.
“Well yes, because Teddy is four. I helped him, but I only wrote down exactly what he wanted to say.”
The two continued in silence, except for the soft whispers of Harry’s words. “I walked in on Bill.”
The pace was brutal. Harry could do nothing but hold onto Draco's hard hips as he bounced on Harry's cock. He reached out and began to pull on Draco's cock only to be slapped away. “Focus on cumming. When you feel like you are going to, tell me.” Harry could do nothing but nod his head in agreement. It was now his turn for his head to knock back into the mattress and his eyes to roll back into his head.
And then Draco Apparated away.
Suddenly, Harry was tired. His bed called out to him and he was eager to answer. He felt as if he could sleep a million years, and was probably going to do so. It would be the first sleep without the threat of Voldemort invading his dreams. He could sleep without fear.
The Floo connection ended. God he hated Fire calling. He wished the wizarding world just get damn cell phones.
"No, I like your nose. But you never answered me. Teddy never mentioned any male lovers, and from the show downstairs and the lack of freaking out up here, I would assume you've had some."
An older round woman carrying a feather duster in her hand answered the door, her cheek stained with a faint line of soot, her housedress a faint shade of puce.
Or else they stand and sniff the wind,
My socks are loose on my feet and I toe the extra material, flipping it back and forth.
Draco bent Harry almost in half and began to pound in earnest. Harry reached up and pulled Draco’s down for a sloppy kiss, enjoying the slick feel of Draco’s glossed lips.
“Oh, okay.”
"Neville, I am not nor will I ever be anyone's woman. But if you like, you can be my man."
I duck my head, completely shamed at my behavior while rubbing the back of my skull. My father has quite an arm on him.
“Forty-one, forty-two.”
Harry took a hard look at Draco before responding. “Actually, I think I'm due for a holiday. I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think you'll see me next week.”
Ah ha!
"He speaks!" I say, thinking it a funny joke, but Mr Potter doesn't laugh. He just pulls down his jumper and stares at me until my giggles turn to nervous laughter.
Harry ran towards him, wiping his hands on his apron.
“You need to go inside, now. This next part I have to do by myself.”
Draco raised one eyebrow. "My prick made you forget?"
“Stop jerking off and get to work.”
Harry stood up from beside Neville and walked to the Sorting Hat. He looked out into the crowd and saw Teddy. His eyes bright and strong. How could he have missed it? Teddy was always strong, always smart. He was gentle, never wanted to hurt even a fly that had lost its way and landed in Andromeda's kitchen.
Has planted quiet in the night;
Harry paused and turned quickly around. “Owl?”
"Why is the rule wrong, Miss Jadeson?"
Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco's strong grip and shook his hand off his arm. 'Do you see a dock? Also, the sun is about to set. We stop here until dawn and then we go to the island. I would prefer to explore during daylight.'
“Teddy’s spending the day before his birthday at the Weasleys’. Andromeda’s picking up last minute presents and supplies for the party. The party is Muggle, so Teddy can invite his friends from the park. You are still coming, right?”
Draco nodded, padding out of the bed. Harry enjoyed the view for a moment before getting dressed himself. It didn't really matter what he wore, but he was sure Snape would prefer him not be nude when they spoke.
“Thanks, Malfoy, I would be honored to have that tree house.”
There was a tiny touch. It was a bit wet, but very light, on the side of his hand. Had Harry imagined it? It had felt suspiciously like a tiny kiss.
There was a birdcall, and then a yellow goldfinch landed on Harry's shoulder. He petted the goldfinch's head and retrieved the letter from her leg.
Harry ran up to Cindy on the front lawn to greet her, but she lifted hand to block Harry's progress.
Harry maneuvered Draco so his head was snuggly fit underneath his chin and his deliciously silky legs were wrapped around his hips.
“No, the spells make it quite painless. I won’t feel anything but a bit of pressure.”
“Stop questioning greatness.”
My father laughs. "So Twelfth Night this year will be extra special. We’ll celebrate both the end of Christmas and the end of my Probation. Sound good?"

“But… but…” I sputter; my mind is not able to comprehend what my father is saying. I want to argue, shake my father until he sees reason, but the sudden closeness between my father and Mr Potter is sending my thoughts whirling.
"Budge up," Draco grunted.
Harry scooted closer. “No really, thank you. It was really dangerous for you to lie like that! Why did you do that for us? I thought you would have been overjoyed to hand us over.”
“I thought you said it wouldn’t hurt.”
In the midst of my father's laughter, he whispers in my ear. “My son.”
“Why is there a tent here?”
Draco, his arm outstretched, was also holding a stick and it suddenly turned on Pansy.
The old man whispered it again, and again, and again, his voice rising with each word.
Draco responded, still staring at the ship. ‘I understand what I must do.’
The word sounded familiar. An image of a man with red hair crossing his eyes in concentration before disappearing flashed through Harry's mind.
“Hey.”
'I'm sorry, Ron, but I have to go back to work.'
Harry barely glanced at the tall golden trees surrounding them in the park before returning all of his attention to Draco.
Draco yelled back, 'Everything’s fine. We'll use the brooms to fly back up.'
Harry shuffled his papers and sighed. Ron often had something he
Padma hit the ground with a thud. Harry started to move toward her, but a shout of “
"That wasn't what you wanted," Harry said.
The voice came from the other side of the room. Draco struggled to open his eyes and lift his head, seeking out the owner of the voice.
He stopped and leaned against a wall, trying to catch his breath. Stupid, he was so stupid. If he was just a little braver…
"Draco –"
After a few more tries, Harry whispered, "
"No, I want to."
It was a relief when things slowly started to go back to normal. Harry and Draco didn't explicitly come out to their friends as dating, but they stopped hiding their affections and shamelessly held hands and kissed in public. None of them seemed surprised – in fact Hermione actually rolled her eyes but had an affectionate smile. He had a feeling she'd known from the beginning.
it wasn't Dumbledore, it was his brother. The two looked so alike that they could be twins, but as Harry really looked, he could see the subtle differences.
"No, you don’t!" Malfoy whipped around, grabbed Harry's collar and shoved him against the wall. He pressed his wand under Harry’s chin, his eyes red-rimmed and burning. "You don’t understand what I’ve been through, you haven’t done the things I’ve done, you didn’t serve
"I'm surprised you didn't go this morning."
Draco collapsed to the floor, leaning back against the wall as Snyde came up to him. "I know you're best friends with Potter now, Malfoy. So why hasn't he come to save you yet?"
"Yeah," he said, Ron and Hermione nodding their approval. He cautiously sat down, and any awkwardness quickly dissipated as Hermione asked them how their Potions project was going. The conversation seemed to pick up right where it left off the other night at the Three Broomsticks, but with Ron included to add to Hermione's descriptions of their experiments and the extra details from their most recent lessons.
He opened his eyes and saw the reason for it all standing in front of him, and he knew he could do it. Raising his wand, he shouted, "
"I'm really glad you came tonight, Malfoy," she said.
"Wait, what?"
"In fact," Dumbledore went on, "I rather think that my Patronus is a bit weak, and perhaps you would do better at teaching the students how to conjure one, Mr Potter."
He couldn't feel his arm anymore but he couldn't stop scratching, until strong hands suddenly pulled his hand away, and there was Harry in his face, telling him to breathe. He could only just hear his voice, as if it was travelling through a tunnel to reach him. Harry held onto his hands and Draco gripped back like he was lifeline, pulling him back.
"Oh, Harry!" she cried, gripping him in a bear hug. "I'm so proud of you!"
Draco spent the day avoiding Potter, which turned out to be immensely difficult. He knew he would have to face him eventually for Potions, but that was a problem for another day. He was finally unsuccessful, however, when Potter followed him all the way from the Great Hall where Malfoy had snagged a piece of bread for dinner and back to his dorm. Draco had thought he was scot free, but Potter managed to get his foot in the door – literally.
Hermione's brow creased, and she glanced up at Ron and Neville. "Some other Slytherins are missing too," Neville added.
"'Brightest witch of her age,'" she quoted airily.
Draco could only stare at Potter. He'd rarely ever had anyone offer to be there for him in his times of need. Every instinct told him to push away any and all kindness, to deal with it on his own the way he was raised to. But where had that gotten him? Standing here in front of him was Harry Potter himself, with his stupid glasses and messy hair and earnest green eyes, just wanting to be there for him. Curse him for being so perfect.
"Malfoy, wait up!" came a call from behind him.
"Okay. We'll find a way out." He lifted Draco up with an arm around his waist and together they made their way to the door. Harry tried the handle and was surprised to find it unlocked. This was starting to feel an awful lot like a trap.
"I'm sorry," Harry said with a sob, letting his head drop onto Draco's chest and bunching his shirt in his fist.
They were sitting in the Great Hall for breakfast the first day of classes. Harry knew that there were likely to be mixed reactions among his friends when he told them of the proposal he had given Malfoy to start over. Ron's mouth was hanging open, while Hermione's was in a tight line.
Harry stood up and pulled Draco with him, but Draco lost his balance and swayed against him. Harry wrapped an arm around his waist and led him out of the bathroom.
Ron and Hermione kept debating while Harry followed them to the Gryffindor table. He was uncertain about it, but only time would tell if an exclusive eighth year dormitory was a good idea or not.
"Can't we stay like this for a little longer?"
"I walked past it on my first night back, and the door appeared but I didn't go inside."
"Why not?"
After several tense moments where Draco wasn't sure if Harry had heard him, Draco heard his breathing even out and the shuffling of his feet as he got up. He heard footsteps coming towards him, and then a sharp intake of breath.
back, but it must've sounded off because Harry frowned at him. "You okay?" Draco just nodded, not trusting his voice.
Behind him, he heard footsteps coming up the stairs.
It was Harry's turn to shout, and as he tried to run forward another Death Eater stepped in his way, wand raised. He locked eyes with Draco, saw the desperation there, but he couldn't see a way out.
"We need to talk."
Draco rolled his eyes. "Okay, because if you can't, we're sticking together, even if that means I move into Hogwarts for the school year with you."
"What's that from?"
He had just wanted to be get away from everyone, to be alone so that he could relieve some of the immense pain that he was feeling. But of course, Potter had found him, and now he knew about Draco's coping mechanism.
"What's this weekend?"
Matt Corby – Made of Stone
The butterbeer flowed and so did the conversation, until Potter quieted them all down. "I have an announcement to make! The next round is on me." There were cheers from all the boys bar Draco, but Potter interrupted, "No, no, that's not the announcement you twats! I have something to tell you all." He paused for a moment, looking around at everyone's faces as if savouring the anticipation. "I'm bi."
Draco. Draco had been at the Malfoy Manor too, had lied to his father so that Harry might get away, or at least be bought some time. And Draco was here now, pulling him back to the present. He needed him.
"Of course, it's fine. I actually think it's a good idea," she said. "He doesn't seem to have any friends in Slytherin anymore, so it makes sense."
"Yeah, I'll be alright."
"Would you like some expert instruction, Draco?" he asked with a grin.
Once the bathroom looked back to normal, Harry gently tilted Draco's chin up to get a good look at his face. It was still tear-streaked and his eyes were puffy, but he also noticed a bruise on his cheekbone.
"Like hell there isn't!"
!" and Draco's wand sailed through the air.
He had been a Death Eater after all.
Draco couldn’t read anymore. He looked up, and his gaze immediately met Potter's across the room. His eyes were so full of sorrow, and Draco couldn't take it. He stood up as quickly as he could and bolted.
He gave in and threw his arms around Harry's waist, holding onto him as tight as he could. Harry gripped him back, and within his arms Draco felt like he was already home.
Draco pursed his lips, unsure of how much he should say. "Because of me."
Potter looked satisfied with that. "I'll take this tray downstairs to the common room and hopefully the house elves will come get it during the night." Draco put his cup back down on the tray and Potter picked it up, taking a step towards the door. "Will you be okay tonight?"
"Harry, what's –" Seeing the Slytherins and the Death Eaters, Draco immediately pulled out his wand and took up a defensive stance.
"This isn't going to hurt or anything is it?"
Harry gaped at him. He had expected much more of a rebuttal, but he hadn't even questioned Harry switching to Draco's first name. He looked to Hermione.
Draco's breaths quickened as he raced down hall after hall. What had he done? He hadn't meant to panic, hadn't wanted to run. But he had been overwhelmed, and now it was too late.
He got his wish sooner than he'd hoped. He was tackled against the wall before he even had a chance to defend himself, and then whoever had grabbed him was punching him in the stomach.
"Ah." They stood in the hall, facing each other, and Draco found himself wishing that the night didn’t have to end. Instead, he said, "Goodnight, Potter."
Malfoy finally turned to face him. "Meaning?"
Harry led him to a space where the walls were covered in mirrors, reaching all the way up to the arched ceiling.
Malfoy's frown turned into a scowl. "That's not happening."
"Although, that means we'll have to keep our hands off each other this weekend."
"Why doesn't everyone know?"
"Who are you gonna go with then?"
No. He steeled himself and continued on his way to the Great Hall. He wasn't going to let this stupid attack bring him back down when he had been doing so well the last few weeks. He hadn't even cut since the first night he arrived, and he didn't want to fall back into that habit just yet.
Her friends looked slightly alarmed and she continued, not moving her gaze from Draco’s limp features.
Over 2,000 hits and nearly 150 kudos. Thanks so much for all your support!
Draco groaned, hiding his face in his hands. Daphne was howling and Blaise wiped tears from his eyes. Theo had opened his eyes and rolled onto his back, wearing a pained expression from trying not to laugh. Both Slytherins rose to introduce themselves to Izzy. Weasley looked at them, openmouthed. Granger and Potter both looked slightly confused as Draco gave a small smile, laughing along with his friends at his own expense. The Golden Boy had obviously not expected Slytherins to be so easy-going and accepting, not to mention laugh at self-deprecating jokes. Maybe this year they could change his mind. Wouldn’t that be something? Harry Potter: Slytherin supporter. Ha.
“You saw?”
Thanks for reading! I promise I will continue to update. I do not abandon stories, just put them on hold for five months. 🤣🤣
Hermione blushed crimson. “Of course we weren’t. Stop giving me that look, we weren’t!”
Draco shuddered, feeling his breath catch in his throat. There were eyes everywhere, more still as they exited the train onto the platform. He couldn’t do this, he couldn’t. He had spilt blood here. He had bathed his home in red. He couldn’t go back. A slight hand slipped into his, tightening softly, palm against palm, wrists brushing.
“I don’t have a wand.”
Luna took this moment to interject. “I wasn’t.”
“When did you see this?” Hermione tried to interrogate him.
Theo looked up, giving him a small fragile smile, his hand sliding down to discreetly brush against his thigh. His hair was matted and Draco knew it would probably be painful to brush out. He more than likely had scars on his scalp to deal with too. Just seeing the broken look on the dark-haired boy’s face made him want to curse the Ministry into oblivion, but the way his eyes lit up and his lips curled into a tentative smile when it dawned on him that he wasn’t in Azkaban anymore, that just made Draco want to give McGonagall all the money in Gringotts to make up for this miracle she had overseen, for giving Theo this second chance. He deserved it more than anyone.
“Are you going to be ok?”
He shrugged, answering without thinking, a habit he had not lost from his time in the Ministry’s cells and his trial. “My boyfriend.”
Theo laughed weakly. “You take the fun out of everything, Dragon.”
He nodded obediently, wondering how on earth he could keep such a promise, but before he could say anything else, his aunt was gone. He slumped into his seat, trying to ignore the twist of loneliness in his chest which he knew he would have to get used to. The train whistled its final warning and Draco pulled an old paperback copy of a muggle book Andy had recommended from his trunk, lazily flipping to his marked page, clamping his bookmark between his teeth. He sighed as the main character went into yet another soliloquy regarding the case of the missing Antichrist. Honestly. If only he could just grab his friend and take them both into the stars where they would be safe. That’s what he would have done. There was a whoosh as the doors slid closed and the train began to move away from the platform.
If looks could kill, everyone in the castle would have suddenly caught a fatal disease. Izzy’s jaw stiffened and she tightened her grip on Draco’s shoulder. “Bellatrix may have given birth to me, but she was not my mom. My parents were Muggles whose son had just begun to develop magic when they adopted me. They raised me since I was a baby. They brought me to Diagon Alley to collect my school books. They supported me and they comforted me after we found out about the Azkaban breakout. They protected me. Bellatrix was the witch who murdered them in front of me when I was sixteen. Bellatrix was the one who ruined my life. I’d kill her myself if she wasn’t already dead.”
He looked up to see that Theo was giving him a fragile smile, lips quivering. “I don’t care what they look like,” he said wearily. “It’s what they signify that I hate.”
Have some wrackspurt repellent standing by and stay safe!
(See the end of the chapter for

The surrounding students choked on their laughter, but Izzy’s jeering cackle brought them all to a halt.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry gave her a weak smile, trying not to see the obvious similarities between her and her brother, Hermione making more of an effort of politeness with a little half-wave. Andromeda took Ella’s hand in her’s, swinging the rucksack over her shoulder. “We can talk over coffee,” she decided. “I know a nice place down the road from here.”
Luna rolled her eyes. “You’re covered in wrackspurts, Draco. Come on. We have a carriage all to ourselves.”
Izzy took Theo’s arm and dragged him inside, but when the two boys slid onto the floor, arms wrapped around each other, Theo’s dark head of hair in the blonde’s lap, she stayed standing. She had a slightly manic grin on her lips, though Draco supposed that having Bellatrix’s genes made her look crazy whatever she did. Her boots were muffled against the carpet, but the ruffle of fabric as she moved behind them told Draco she had skipped over to the bookshelf and was no doubt running her fingers over the stiff spines. She returned a moment later, flopping onto the floor in front of them, bearing a large pack of Muggle markers.
“You’re so beautiful, mon beau” he whispered, pressing his lips firmly against the mark. “Scars and all.”
What is your favourite Harry Potter headcanon or fan theory?
Draco jumped to his feet, pulling a still quivering Theo into his arms. “We’ll sit down too, sir.”
The boy gave a short huff of laughter and turned his head to kiss Draco fully. Draco put a hand to the back of Theo’s neck, pressing their foreheads together so they could look each other in the eye. At that moment, his vulnerability was undeniable.
He looked up quickly and saw a pair of Fourth Year girls standing awkwardly in the doorway. He raised an eyebrow.
“I hope so.” His cousin nodded, carefully running a hand through Theo’s hair. The boy didn't stir, but his breathing hitched slightly and he let out a low sigh that sounded almost like a purr. Around them, the other Eighth Years were sinking into armchairs as close to the fire as they could manage, chatting avidly with one another. Blaise and Daphne had sunk to the floor beside their sofa, arms wrapped around each other, talking quietly. Brooks had finished her speech and left them alone.
Izzy was next. When she faced the boggart, she was met with eerie brown eyes and a cruel sneer on lips that were supposed to be her own. She was met with a sharper, more callous version of herself that left her looking surprised at first. But then the figure opened its mouth and Izzy’s expression stilled.
There was the sound of steady movement at the doors and his head snapped around. The Aurors came first. They had been his nightmare every single day he had resided in their cells. Their cruel taunts - which often matured into assaults - still rang in his ears. The feeling of their boots still jarred his back. He took a quick step away from them, completely forgetting about his cousin and boyfriend. Blaise stepped close to him, taking his arm in a gentle grip, helping to ground him. Almost distantly, Draco noticed that Blaise had avoided his forearm, something he was grateful for, as the Dark Mark still hurt sometimes when he touched it.
“A hot werewolf,” Draco growled, running his fingers down Theo’s spine. Theo shuddered and arched into the touch. “But you’re also a really powerful wizard, a loyal friend, an amazing boyfriend and the greatest Slytherin since Salazar himself. And that tops Merlin, Theo.”
“How do you know that?” Harry asked suspiciously.
Andromeda raised an eyebrow. “Aren’t you staying at the Burrow, Harry?”
“Oh, you know. How to get rid of bubotuber pus, how to teach my stubborn sister how to cook, how to distinguish between hate mail and normal mail.” Harry cringed slightly at this. “Speaking of which, do either of you know anything about Theodore Nott?”
As promised, another chapter in Harry's POV. It's time for the long-awaited feast.
The Slytherins, including Blaise and Daphne, could sense that this class would not go in their favour, and immediately took seats right at the back of the room, attempting to melt into the shadows.
Draco sincerely doubted that but he wasn’t really in a position to argue with them, so he just nodded, even helping the shorter of the two to slide her trunk into the luggage rack. Just as he was attempting to slump back into his window seat and immerse himself in his book, another girl slid open the door. Her friends greeted her, gesturing for her to sit down, but she froze, her deep brown eyes fixed upon Draco with undisguised contempt.
Be safe!
He couldn’t look at him, but he could feel those green eyes burning into him. Potter ignored Theo completely, stopping in front of Draco, his hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath. Finally, he straightened and Draco raised his eyes slightly to show that he was listening.
“Sweetheart, you didn’t do anything wrong. I’m glad you were able to get out when you did. We both are.”
“We don’t have a curfew,” he droned, “but we will be punished if we fall asleep in class. We can visit Hogsmeade every weekend if we want to. We will be getting careers advice over the next few weeks and apprenticeships start next month. We should look out for younger students. And we should all see a Mind Healer.”
Draco just looked at her. He didn’t deserve the understanding expression her face melted into, or the gentle fingers tucking a strand of hair behind his ear.
The boy gave a short huff of laughter and turned his head to kiss Draco fully. Draco put a hand to the back of Theo’s neck, pressing their foreheads together so they could look each other in the eye. At that moment, his vulnerability was undeniable.
Draco gave him a small smirk. “It’s not the same. It’s actually really nice.”
He received a curt nod in response and slowly inched into a standing position, pressing his hands into dark hair, his gaze flickering over the suddenly silent room.
Theo trembled but forced himself to continue through the enclosed space. Obviously, their stint in Azkaban had left them both quite claustrophobic, probably touch starved too. The group halted, having reached a dead end, and Brooks raised her wand, tapping the bare wall.
Sorry for the long wait, but I'm giving you an extra long chapter to make up for it.
Izzy glanced around, a fragile smile playing on her lips.
Potter was saying something to Weasley. Potter was shaking his head. Potter was walking towards him. Potter was going to kill him. Potter was going to finish what he started.
“What are you looking at, Malfoy?” Weasley snarled. Both Granger and Potter were instantly wide awake.
“You better watch your back, Death Eater!”
Draco shook his head and looked away, hoping to avoid a fight, but Weasley was already on his feet. Draco stood quickly, grabbing Theo by the waist so he wouldn’t fall as he slid off his lap. Weasley approached them, wand in hand.
Hermione glanced at Harry, who had to force himself to keep still. “We’re not staying here are we?”
“I’ll do your face first.” Draco forced his voice to remain calm and steady.
“Hey, Theo,” Granger frowned. “Are you ok? You look sick.”
Any specific scenes?
Draco looked between the two girls, a nervous smile forming on his lips. “That would be quite hypocritical of me, wouldn’t it?” He murmured, remembering the time Luna had walked in on him and Theo. She still hadn’t told a soul - that he knew of anyway.
The young teacher stepped forward from where she had been hovering, a small smile on her face. Draco looked at her for just a moment before quickly averting his gaze,  not wanting to draw unwanted attention to himself. He stood, pulling Theo up beside him as gentle as he could manage, shooing Izzy away when she tried to help. For Merlin’s sake, she was barely able to carry her own weight, not to mention Theo’s. Theo let out a soft whimper but allowed Draco to carry most of his weight as they shuffled after the others. Brooks led them out of the hall and towards the grand staircase. Instead of moving up it, though, they followed her around the back of it and through a hidden doorway into a narrow corridor. Theo’s grip on instantly tightened and Draco saw Izzy’s smile drop into a scowl, her eyes darting around nervously.
“Come on, Draconis,” Izzy pleaded. “It’ll give you something else to focus on.”
The dark-haired boy knew not to complain, and Draco knew not to argue with the ex-Auror, but they both knew Theo was in no condition to face his worst fear. His magic always got worse this close to the full moon. Theo limped to the top of the class, facing the boggart with a lot more bravery than he felt. The boggart sneered at him, before twisting its shape into Fenrir Greyback. Someone screamed. Theo’s wand clattered to the floor and he jerked away from the werewolf. Greyback loped after him, grinning toothily, a soft growl echoing through the classroom. Theo’s legs came out from under him and the boggart crouched, putting a sharp nail beneath the boy’s chin, forcing him to look up. Tear tracks scarred Theo’s cheeks, his chest rising and falling fast, but no air reached his lungs.
“A relative of mine.” She smirked. “And that’s all you’ll be getting out of me so don’t even try.”
Draco pressed his face into Theo’s neck, breathing in his familiar scent. He smelled like lavenders, something Draco had always been quick to tease him on in the past, but not today. Not today, when the only thing keeping him from losing his head completely was Theo’s unwavering presence. Theo’s lips pressed against Draco's temple, his fingers swimming through Draco’s hair, his free arm wrapped around Draco’s waist. Salty tears meandered down Theo’s neck, but he didn’t wipe them away. He hummed into Draco’s temple, kissing him gently.
“We’re home,'' he whispered. And they stepped together onto the crowded platform. They were going home.
Thanks for all your support! So, here's chapter 9. I honestly didn't think I would get this far!
Harry stiffened and Luna and Ginny gasped, glaring at Ron, but when Malfoy turned to look at him, there was no coldness in his eyes.
He sneered, “I never said I wasn’t, Weaslette.”
She nodded quickly, as though she was scared he was going to start shouting at her and Harry felt a surge of guilt in the pit of his stomach. He bowed his head, forcing himself not to look at her expression as she pushed open the creaky gate and letting them walk into the playground. He couldn’t deal with her feelings, not now, not when he was having enough trouble with his own. The laughs and screams of muggle children filled the air around them. Disapproving parents standing by frowned at their children, calling out to them to ‘be careful’ and ‘not so fast’. A light scent of car fumes and pine needles hung over the scene almost purposefully, as though it was trying to remind him of the smoke and the Forbidden Forest. Harry could see a light smile playing over Hermione’s lips at the sight of the contained chaos, but every loud noise, every scream, every yell made him stiffen. To him, every laugh was high and cold, every scream a dying friend, every shriek a curse.
I can't choose one. I love "Draco Malfoy is a Werewolf" a lot. Also, anything to do with the Slytherins looking out for each other because no one else will. Have I mentioned that I love Slytherins?
Thanks so much for all the support and love this fic is getting.
He took another deep breath before raising his head to look up at the castle. This was still his home. There were still people who cared about him here. There were still good memories mixed in with the bad ones.
“And Draco?”
Enjoy!
Their banter was interrupted by a whistling sound that seemed to be coming from Andromeda’s watch. She tapped it quickly, muting the high-pitched sound before it could attract the attention of the muggles nearby. She turned back to them. “I have to go. I’m visiting Azkaban in an hour and I can’t be late. It’s been lovely seeing you, but…”
So sorry for the long wait. Please forgive me!!! Thanks for the kudos. Hope you enjoy this update!
This update's question:
Surprise! Another chapter. Who would have thought. I'm getting better at speed-writing, so I will try to update more often. So here it is: Chapter 3.
Draco ignored her, narrowing his eyes at the Weasley girl. “Since it is suddenly your business,” he said haughtily, “I’m gay. And Pansy and I were never a thing.”
“We - we met in the library during our Fourth Year. He was doing some project on the history of muggleborn Slytherins, but he helped me research for SPEW.” Harry gave her a sceptic look, but she plunged on. “He was polite. He was interested in my views. And he didn’t use derogatory slurs. The fact that he didn’t idolise Malfoy helped too. Once the git walked in on us making badges and Nott just had to raise an eyebrow and he left. It was pretty badass actually.”
Ginny opened her mouth to retort, but he was saved by the trolley, rolling up laden with the sweets he sorely needed right now.
Theo kissed the top of Draco’s ear, whispering, “you deserved to be saved, Dray. Do you hear me? You deserve to live.” Draco didn’t give any indication that he had heard and Theo sighed, shaking his head and wrapping his arms around him. “It’s ok, Draco. This is going to work out. It’s going to-”
“What sort of research projects?”
“Ron, stop!” Potter jumped to his feet, closely followed by Granger.
The redhead finally found her voice. “You have a boyfriend?”
Blaise snorted. “Yeah. I appreciate the compliment, Weasley, but you’re not my type. Your lips will never grace these cheekbones.”
“Sure,” he grinned, earning himself a hard glare from his friend.
“That I’m a werewolf,” Theo snapped. “Just like this mark…” He raised his left arm. “…reminds me that I’m a Death Eater. I’m a monster on two fronts. I’m nothing more than a vicious animal that followed a mad man to my doom.”
“May I stand?”
Ginny hesitated, before reaching forward to take a pumpkin pasty, muttering under her breath. “You’re still a git, Malfoy.”
He only half-listened as McGonagall continued to list off rules as though the interaction hadn’t taken place. He took that moment to examine Theo, noting how much thinner he was, how he had huge shadows under his eyes. He ran his finger gently over the scar on his cheek. It looked painful, untreated and still fresh.
When Theo caught sight of the statue of Barnabus the Barmy, he froze, reaching out to lay a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Dray,” he breathed. “We don’t have to…”
Izzy raised her wand. “I. Don’t. Care… Riddikulus!”
He put his arm back around Theo’s shoulders and they shuffled towards the Hospital Wing, not looking back to see the stunned look Potter threw at their retreating backs before his friends caught up to him and dragged him away. They didn’t hear him whisper resentfully to himself, words that were not meant for anyone else’s ears.
“Mr Weasley,” McGonagall’s lips were thin. “I think you will find that now is a good time to keep your mouth shut and your nose out of other people’s business. Mr Malfoy, please enlighten Mr Weasley on the important points of what I just said.”
Theo was already in the common room when he returned, kneeling on the carpet right next to the fire, staring into the dying embers. For just a moment, Draco could see the old Theo, the one who would lounge about in the Slytherin common room, sitting as close to the fire as he could to protect himself from the cold, trying to focus upon anything but the impending summer holidays. As the heirs of prominent Pureblood families, both Draco and Theo had had similar upbringings, knowing little love and care, taught not to show emotion and to look down upon others. Draco had adapted to this treatment quickly, but even Theo’s best acting didn’t save him from his irritable father’s wand.
“I know you were,” he breathed, sadly. “And I appreciate it, I appreciate everything you’ve done for me since… But, people don’t like to see the Saviour of the Wizarding World standing up for a Death Eater.” He saw reality dawn upon Potter’s face. “Let people say what they want to say. As I said on Tuesday, it’s better for us to stay out of each other’s way.”
He rolled his eyes, pushing her towards the door, a smile twitching on his lips. “I will curse you,” he rasped.
Draco just about managed to hide his smirk. McGonagall seemed to have gotten a good understanding of him through the meetings she had set up over the holidays. She had come to try to convince him to make the best of the upcoming year, but she was too cunning not to use the time to get to know what he was really like. His consistent ability to simultaneously take in information and entertain Teddy had probably been the first thing she had spotted.
Potter hesitated before moving back to his admirers, running a hand through his hair, an easy smile drifting back onto his face. Draco buried his eyes in his knees, shoulders shaking, ignoring the stern gaze his father would have given him for crying in public. Theo slid down against the wall, his shoulder brushing Draco’s.
“But, sir!” Draco’s head shot around to stare at Potter, who was standing, surveying the scene with a shocked expression. “He really should go to the Hospital Wing. He needs a calming draught.”
“Who’s we?” He asked sceptically, but the blonde only shook her head and moved to help him pick up his trunk and cage.
“He needs to go to the Hospital Wing, sir. Please, I’ll take him.”
“I’m sorry,” the red-head whispered. “I didn’t mean to…”
"Draco?" He pounded again. "Draco, it's me, open up!"
Malfoy only looked at him side on. Back at the table he'd just vacated, Ron was shaking his head.
"Wait, why aren't they going anymore?"
"Because there's nothing you can do."
This bonus chapter is a rewrite of
TW: panic attacks, self harm.
"We are. But I'm going to think of you as my date," Harry said with a mischievous grin. Draco thought he looked gorgeous in the soft bedroom light and pulled him down to kiss him.
"I'm sorry…" Draco started.
"Draco –"
"You wish," Harry replied easily. He let go of Draco’s hand somewhat reluctantly, and only because they needed to gather up the books.
"I'm here, Harry," Draco was saying. "I'm here."
Draco shook his head. "Unbelievable, you are."
Billie Eilish – when the party’s over
They waited. Harry knew a response might not come at all, but he was desperate. After a few minutes, his prayers were answered as the flame reappeared, the same piece of paper reforming. Harry caught it and stared at the message written below his.
A sob racked through Draco, and he could see from the way he looked into Harry's eyes that he needed him too. Desperately.
"If you don't want to tell me anything then I'll just be on my way," Draco said, taking a step back, but Synde whipped out his wand and levelled it at Draco's chest.
Ron went a little bit red. "Well, I guess I just liked the idea of… Harry being my brother-in-law."
"I draw them out and ask them more about whatever cult it is they're forming, and you stay nearby hidden under the cloak so you can listen and jump in if you need to."
Harry was pulling them across to the other side of the room, when a voice shouted, "
The night progressed much the same. Harry and Draco would sneak touches under the table, or when they would go up to the bar together. The others seemed oblivious, and Draco was living for it. The more butterbeers that flowed, the livelier the group got, and Draco found himself actively engaging in everyone's conversation. He was starting to feel like he belonged, and it made him swell with warmth and pride. Especially as he watched Harry laughing at something Ron said, and thought how stunningly perfect he was, from his smile to his hair to his strikingly green eyes. When they all took a shot of firewhiskey and Draco noticed the flush that crept into Harry's cheeks, he pulled him by the arm away and towards the bar.
Draco could just make out Harry's face in the dark and tried to focus on him, but he was still shaking.
Draco chuckled, but then he considered it. "Would they have me?"
It was a weak proposal, he knew, and he saw straight away that it didn't go over well with Pansy. She stood up to face him properly, and Draco had to will himself not to cringe away from the fire in her eyes.
When they reached the new dormitory, Harry took a moment to take in the common room. It was smaller than the house common rooms, as there were less students for it to house, but it still had a cosy feeling. A banner for each of the houses hung on the walls, and a great fireplace set into the wall filled the room with warmth. Heading upstairs, he saw that each room was labelled with the owner's name, and with a jolt he saw that Malfoy's was next to his.
He wasn't going to let his thoughts fall back into those dark places, wasn't going to let himself think he deserved it. Wasn't going to…
Draco captured his mouth again, wanting to taste him. But Harry's kisses moved past his mouth, along his jaw and down his neck. Draco tilted his head back to give him better access, and when Harry found his sweet spot just above his collarbone, he couldn't help the noise that escaped his lips. Harry suckled and nipped at it torturously, and when Draco couldn't take it anymore, he pulled Harry's face back up to his, recapturing his lips.
The Cinematic Orchestra, Patrick Watson – To Build A Home
There was another moment of shocked silence, but Granger and Weasley were grinning – of course they already knew. Longbottom clapped him on the back and said, "Good on you for coming out, mate!" and the cheers started up again.
"I –"
"I know. Just don't come out unless you absolutely have to."
He opened it anyway, and carefully stepped into the next room. The first thing Harry noticed was that one side was open, a railing along the edge seeming to be the only thing that separated them from the nothingness beyond. He could hear the crashing of waves, however, and assumed it dropped down to the cliffs below. He spotted another door on the other side and started towards it.
"No, I'm glad I came."
"Draco?" His voice was barely more than whisper, but he saw Draco's head lift.
"Ron, I'm sure he didn't do anything to upset Draco."
Opening the door to his room, Draco stepped in to find that it looked like a typical Slytherin dormitory, but fitted for just one person with a four poster bed, a desk, wardrobe, a small fireplace with a couple of armchairs (not that he would ever be entertaining a guest) and a door off to the side that led to the bathroom. That was where Draco headed first.
The table reappeared with paper, a quill and ink. He thought for a moment then quickly jotted down his message. With a wave of his wand and an incantation he set the paper alight and watch it float up, engulfed by the flame, and disappear.
Draco pushed those thoughts out of his head as Filch brought him to the painting concealing the entrance to the new eighth year dormitories and told him the password. It was ridiculous, he thought, that he had to share a dormitory with the other eighth years and not just his house. Most of them hated him. But he knew there were a great deal of Slytherins that hated him too, and at least he had a private room here.
Draco chuckled, and Harry felt his own grin spreading, until he was laughing too. He threw his head back, and Draco laughed harder as well. It was contagious.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was knocked down, but immediately scrambled back to his feet. All around him Death Eaters lay motionless, but when he looked to the space where Draco had been standing, it was empty. There was only the railing and the open sky.
Theo gave another nod and turned slightly so he was facing him, his scar illuminated by the dying embers. Draco took some of the cream on the tips of his fingers and steadied Theo’s head with a hand to his jaw.
From that moment on, the class was actually pretty great. Brooks was an excellent teacher and had explained all of the potions in detail before instructing them to begin concocting the blood replenisher. They had all been sorted into pairs to brew, Draco immediately choosing Theo, who would need as much help as he could get with the class, especially when his senses were dialled up to eleven just before the full moon and he could barely concentrate. Somehow, Izzy had managed to pair up with Granger and they had become the best of friends by the time the class was over. In fact, the day as a whole could have been much much worse. And lying in his four-poster bed trying to stave off sleep, fearing the nightmares that would no doubt accompany drifting off alone, he endeavoured to remember that.
“Try to enjoy yourself.”
And... I'm not dead!
Harry cut her off harshly. “I’ve already said yes, Hermione. I don’t need you to try and convince me to go when I’m already going.” Hermione looked slightly startled and he sighed. “Sorry, I just… Can we not talk about this right now. I’m stressed enough as it is.”
“Vincent,” he choked. “He’s dead, Theo. Potter left him to the Fiendfyre. He saved me instead. He should have… He’s gone, Theo.” He let out a retching sob and buried his face back into Theo’s shoulder, his body trembling. His tears stained Theo’s shirt, but the boy’s calm facade didn’t fall.
He shook away Lucius’ words with a whispered, “sorry.”
Knowles sneered. “You do that, Malfoy. And another twenty points for not obeying my instruction fast enough.”
Please don't kill me.
“Not really,” Andromeda gave a weak smile. “Come on, Ella. Harry, Hermione, it’s been great to see you. I’ll try to write as often as possible. Say hello to the others for me.”
Draco couldn’t stop himself from flinching and closed his eyelids over his silver irises. So, this was Katie Bell’s sister. When he forced himself to look at her again, she was tossing back her brown mousy hair and baring her teeth.
Mine is wolfstar (Remus Lupin/Sirius Black). What's yours?
Draco was on his feet, a curse flying from his wand, banishing the boggart back into the wardrobe it had climbed out of. He fell to his knees beside his boyfriend, feeling him flinch when he put his arms around him. He raised his head, looking up into Draco’s silver eyes, still gasping for breath and crying silently. Draco released him slowly and took one of Theo’s hands, placing it on his chest.
“That is the most Gryffindor insult I’ve ever heard!” She let out a soft scream of mirth, her eyes fixed on Weasley.
Daphne yawned and stretched, before announcing that she was going to bed. She hugged each of them in turn before trudging off to bed. Blaise left minutes later. Draco glanced toward Potter and his friends, wondering wearily if they would be going to bed anytime soon. Granger had her head in Potter’s lap, her eyes closed and Potter was staring into thin air. Weasley, however, had noticed him watching and had a hand on his wand.
“Why did you let him do that?” Potter seemed angry. He would have laughed at him, had he not been so frightened.
She shrugged. “Your face. It went all scrunched up…” She demonstrated the expression. “And he was sad when you were there with the other boy. He got sad when I asked him about it too. Luna said he will get sad a lot because his soul is all hurt, but you make him sadder.”
They separated, moving through their assigned doors. Draco hated the idea of having to sleep in a different room from his boyfriend after seven years of being in the same dorm, but there was nothing he could do about it. He couldn’t risk getting sent to Azkaban. He could feel eyes upon him as he moved to the only empty bed, pulling his trunk from beneath it. Pulling the hangings around him, he slipped into his pyjamas. They were soft and seemed to soothe his aching body. He could not wait to fall asleep in them. He escaped from behind the hangings, rummaging through his trunk until he found the small tub of scar cream he had been looking for and began to make his way back to the common room. Just as he closed the door, he saw a pair of green eyes blinking at him curiously and looked away. Potter, it seemed, had been watching him.
“No, of course not,” Andromeda stood,  her bright smile almost hiding her sleep-deprived features; the shadows under her eyes and her too-thin lips. Only as she straightened, did Harry notice what - or who - was missing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco closed his book with a snap and stood, lifting Ulysses’ cage into his arms, sliding his trunk from the luggage rack. He turned back to Bell, his fists clenched. Of course he regretted it. He had been sixteen. He had been a child. He had watched those around him be killed and tortured. He had been tortured. He took a deep calming breath and tilted his head to the side.
“I was just trying to help!”
“He’s Draco Malfoy. He’s a Death Eater. He cursed my sister and he killed Professor Dumbledore.”
Ginny blinked once and then sighed, nodding to the seats opposite her. “I honestly don’t have the energy to fight you right now, Malfoy. Keep your mouth shut and you can stay.”
There is some period-typical homophobia in this one, but it is shut down pretty quickly.
Izzy smiled, not answering, and Theo let out a small sigh from where he had fallen asleep in his lap. Draco ruffled his boyfriend’s hair, keeping his left arm perfectly still as a bright red marker met his skin and the ink began to spread.
“Where’s Teddy?”
So here it is: a Draco POV chapter. Some Narcissa and Draco time and then just a tiny bit too much of Draco reliving his past.
Theo bit his lip, casting a nervous glance in Draco’s direction as the blonde ran his fingers nervously through his hair.
“Nope,” he shook his head quickly, trying to ignore the loud slurping sounds Ella was making with her drink. “Ginny and I broke up - or decided not to get back together - so I’ve been trying to give them some space.
When she moved back to her seat, Theo stood and hugged her from behind, whispering something comforting into her ear. She didn’t have time to reply before Knowles noticed them. “Nott!”
His eyes widened and he shied back further.
Hermione glanced at Harry again, as though she was scared he would have a nervous breakdown and start singing in mermish, before nodding. “Yeah, we were.”
“Yeah,” Harry said cautiously. “He was in our year. A Slytherin. He was with Malfoy after the Battle. They were taken away by the Aurors together.”
He thought back to warm summers, stretched out under the oak tree by the lake, finishing homework or reliving particularly good Quidditch matches. He may be dreading the crowds of curious students and memories of pain and death, but Hogwarts was home to him. And despite everything, he was looking forward to going back.
Draco froze, his heart catching. They were here? They were in this very building? McGonagall had looked deadly serious when she had said it, but how on earth had she been able to get them out of Azkaban? That was probably why Professor Knowles hadn’t seemed too happy with her. He had made it abundantly clear to him that he didn’t want him there and that any misbehaviour would send him straight back to prison, where he belonged. This wasn’t a second chance. This was a test.
“You should be writing this down. Your homework will be to find a way to use each of these fears against your classmates.”
The honesty of the youth threw Hermione slightly, but when Andromeda didn’t interject, she answered carefully. “What makes you think that?”
“Hermione,” Theo greeted Granger, who was waiting eagerly outside the door.
Seeming to realise what he had done, the Saviour’s hand pulled away as if burned. “S-sorry. I didn’t-”
“I don’t want you to appreciate that I told the truth. I did it because it was the right thing to do.”
Theo flinched as he traced the cream over the scar, gentle fingers on damaged skin, but soon he stilled, tears glittering being his eyelids. Without waiting to be asked, he began undoing the buttons on his shirt, shrugging it off his shoulders to display his chest which was covered in a spiderweb of scars reaching into his back. Draco tenderly slid the shirt away and set to work on the wounds. Theo looked away from him, tears racing each other down his cheeks. His eyes avoided both Draco and his own body. It broke Draco’s heart. Draco ducked his head, his lips ghosting over Theo’s stomach, over the bite mark which was proof of what Greyback had done to him, of how his life now revolved around a lunar cycle.
Draco slipped his hand into his boyfriend’s, being careful not to squeeze too tightly. He knew that this close to the full moon, the werewolf’s bones would seem more fragile and uncomfortable. He gave Izzy a meaningful stare, jerking his head towards the staircase behind them.
He put his arm back around Theo’s shoulders and they shuffled towards the Hospital Wing, not looking back to see the stunned look Potter threw at their retreating backs before his friends caught up to him and dragged him away. They didn’t hear him whisper resentfully to himself, words that were not meant for anyone else’s ears.
“Harry, Hermione, it’s great to see you.”
They couldn’t spend the break in some abandoned classroom, or wandering the corridors. It wasn’t just Knowles who held a personal grudge against them. Most teachers would give them detention as soon as look at them. There was only one place in this whole school that he knew they would not be found and forced into the boisterous atmosphere of the Great Hall. But, it was the place he had stood when, one by one, the Death Eaters had stepped out of the vanishing cabinet. It was the place he had watched his friend burn to death. It was the place he had nearly died, had Potter not swooped in at the last moment. Draco didn’t want to return to the seventh-floor corridor, he didn’t want to make the door appear, but there wasn’t really any other choice. They needed somewhere to get away from everyone. They needed the Room of Requirement.
Theo stepped out in front of Draco, a hand around his wrist to keep him from doing anything stupid. “I think we should go to bed. It's been a long day.”
“Why?” Harry asked, refusing to return her smile.
The little blonde girl, whom he remembered from the trial, scurried over to them, bringing whatever conversation they might have had to an abrupt halt. “Hi!”
And then they turned on the spot and he was sucked into suffocating darkness.
“Promise?” Draco slipped his hand into his boyfriend’s.
Draco wrapped his arms around him. “Of course, mon amour.” Theo had been there for him after the Battle of Hogwarts, and now, when the dust had settled, Draco would be there for him too.
“Murderer.”
Theo shot her a halfhearted glare but didn’t argue with her description of his condition.
“Do you still think you’re better than everyone?” Weasley bared his teeth. “Because you’re not. With Daddy in prison and Mommy stuck at home, you’re nothing. You should be in Azkaban.”
McGonagall nodded for the Aurors to leave and Izzy blew a kiss at their backs, followed almost immediately by a very rude hand gesture. Blaise and Daphne rushed to cover their laughter and Draco didn’t hide the tiny smile that decorated his lips. He moved without thinking, darting forwards and taking Theo’s other side. Izzy rewarded him with a dazzling smile and together, they helped him shuffle to the Ravenclaw bench and slump onto it. He was weak, shaking from all the eyes on him, but he seemed to have calmed down now that the Aurors were gone. He raised his head, offering a weak smile and shifting closer to Draco, who threw an arm around him to keep him by his side.
Something inside Draco was broken, shattered into tiny little pieces. The memories of Voldemort reared their snakey heads and sprung from every corner of the Manor. And Draco curled in on himself as he cried for every time he had wanted to and wasn’t able.
“What are you blabbering on about?”
“Hmm?” Hermione’s eyes were slightly out of focus, but she quickly snapped back to attention. “Oh, yeah. She barely leaves.”
“Can we sit here? All the other compartments are full.”
Draco shook his head vigorously, trying to warn Potter to stay out of this and not make it worse, but it was too late. The Golden Boy was just as oblivious to what was happening as he was before the war. Of course, the Gryffindor Hero wouldn’t understand that now was a time that self-preservation was important. He wouldn’t understand that he was putting them in more danger by speaking out.
Hermione took him by the wrist and together, they traipsed out into the summer sun. “We may as well go to Diagon Alley since you’re out of the house. I need to get my new school books and so do you.”
Potter was watching again, his brow furrowed and his arms crossed, but he didn’t try to step in. Draco had stilled, tears forgotten and left to soak into his cheeks. His expression was unreadable. Having the Dark Lord living in his house had taught him how to close his mind to intrusion.
Thanks for reading! The next chapter will be out next Monday. It will be another Harry POV chapter, but then we're back to Draco. Stay safe!
Thanks to everyone who has stuck by me. Stay safe!
Draco raised an eyebrow, smiling ruefully. He stared at Potter, searching for some small hesitation, some small proof that he was being mocked, but found none. Of course, Saint Potter with his ‘Saving People Complex’ wanted to help him now. He hadn’t so much as lifted a finger during their sixth year, but now, when he was no longer in danger, Potter wanted to save him, to make himself look good. Saviour of the Wizarding World, through and through.
Theo did indeed look sick, but they all knew that Granger could not know the cause for his being under the weather. The werewolf boy smiled weakly. “I’ll be fine. I can sleep it off tomorrow.”
“Are you going back to Hogwarts this year?” Hermione asked breezily, breaking the uncomfortable silence that had settled over them like fondant on a birthday cake.
He stroked Draco’s thigh watching the tears clinging to Draco’s sharp chin. Draco started shaking again, his grip on Theo tightening desperately.
The Dark Lord was dead. All around Draco, people laughed and cried and rejoiced. The body had been moved to a chamber off the hall and Draco silently applauded the individuals brave enough to touch it. He certainly couldn’t have. He raised a trembling hand to brush away a treacherous tear that was sliding down his cheek. He knew people were watching him; some of their laughter was aimed in his direction, their stares boring holes in the top of his head. He couldn’t care less anymore. Laughter was the least of his worries. He was a Death Eater, now wholly at the mercy of his conquerors. Draco shuddered, pressing his spine against the hard stone wall behind him, raising his eyes to sweep carefully over the room. He pulled his knees tight to his chest, balancing his chin on top of them. The fallen were still laid along the centre of the hall, eyes closed or unseeing, weeping friends laying over them. A knot of guilt tightened in Draco’s stomach.
Andromeda looked surprised by the question. “Yes. She didn’t tell you? She came to see how Draco was doing. She’s a nice girl. The two of them spend the whole day in the garden. Talking. She’s smart too. And funny. Whatever they talked about helped Draco a lot. I haven’t seen him so happy.”
“Dray,” he whispered, gently putting his arms around his waist and pulling Draco onto his lap. “It’s going to be ok, dragon. I’m here. I’ve got you.”
Draco straightened, pressing a fleeting kiss to his boyfriend’s lips. “That you’re a survivor?” He tucked a strand of hair behind Theo’s ear. “That you looked the Dark Lord in the eye and refused to do his bidding? That you’re a fighter?”
Sorry for the long wait.  This chapter was so much harder to write than the others and so, it took an extra week to post. I'll try to have the next one up within the two weeks this time.
Theo flinched at the loud noise and raised his eyes carefully to the Professor. “Yes, sir?” His voice trembled.
“Now that we have that sorted out,” she ran her gaze over all of them, “I have one more announcement to make. Your year group will be joined by two more students. One of them was your classmate for seven years, and the other has never even stepped into the grounds. I ask that you treat them both with respect; they have been through much more than any of you and still have managed to remain kind, respectful people. They do not deserve your scorn.”
Over 100 kudos. Thanks so much for all of your support!
“All right, all right,” she laughed, rifling through her pockets and pulling out a few stray coins. “Get yourself something sweet from the trolley. I daresay you need it.”
He realised with a jolt that he had been staring and looked away, flushing. “Nothing,” he stuttered, “just thinking.”
Luckily, the compartment in question was only a few doors down, but when Luna pulled open the door, Draco froze. Ginny Weasley did likewise. Luna broke the silence with her usual dreamy tone.
He forced his eyes away from the mass of cruel expressions, letting his gaze linger on Theo and Izzy as they stopped, holding out their hands to be free of their bonds. Theo looked sickly pale, a long scar from his chin to left ear standing out strikingly from his pasty skin. He was leaning on Izzy for support, walking with a limp, his eyes fixed on his feet. Izzy was the opposite. Sure, she was a bit unsteady on her feet, but she kept her chin up, staring around the hall with a crazed smile, undeniably delighted with the situation she had found herself in. She had somehow managed to tie her jet-black hair into a plait to keep it out of her face and her dark brown heavy-lidded eyes caught the attention of everyone in the room.
Izzy raised an eyebrow sceptically, giving him a piercing stare before shrugging and obeying his instructions. She took long steps, striding past the wall with a look of extreme concentration, wringing her hands slightly. She noticed Theo opening his mouth to speak, but Draco gave him a ferocious look and the dark-haired boy lowered his gaze meekly, staying quiet. On her third turn past the wall, she gasped as a door materialised right in front of her. Draco shuddered, but pressed past her suddenly grim expression, shouldering his way into the room. He let out a small sigh of relief. He was not in the Room of Hidden Things. This adaptation of the Room of Requirement came in the form of a cosy-looking sitting room. The floor was covered in a soft grey carpet, a small sofa taking up one of the walls, cushions piled in one corner and a large bookshelf in the other. The whole room was bathed in a dim glow that would easily help with Theo’s headache.
“I have the cream,” he mumbled. “I can put it on for you.”
Draco took a deep calming breath and gestured to the wall opposite them. “Walk past it three times thinking of what you need and it’ll give it to you.”
“Promise.”
“And for your information, Potter, sometimes it’s better to keep your mouth shut and deal with it.”
“Nope,” Harry grimaced. “I heard they were found in the owlery. And Nott’s parents both died in the Battle, so it was just the two of them.”
Harry hummed noncommittally. “Malfoy wasn’t really all there and Nott was way too calm, especially when the Aurors came. I think he’s the reason they came quietly.”
I am no quitter! -This is what I've been chanting inside my head for the last five months. Lol.
“Are you ok, Dray?”
He nodded, only half-listening. He was watching the teens by the lake again, their laughter reaching them from across the road. He thought back to warm summers, stretched out under the oak tree by the lake, finishing homework or reliving particularly good Quidditch matches. He may be dreading the crowds of curious students and memories of pain and death, but Hogwarts was home to him. And despite everything, he was looking forward to going back.
“Do as they say, Draco,” Theo whispered, glancing at the Aurors. “Please.”
Draco gave a small nod and half-carried Theo to his seat. He didn’t much care about the points being taken. It wasn’t as if Slytherin had any hope of winning with all this prejudice floating around and he honestly had other things to be worrying about. Namely, the fact the Theo was still trembling against his chest, his hands gripping his robes, his shoulders shaking with silent sobs. Class ended abruptly and Draco helped Theo stand, allowing Izzy to trail behind them miserably as they limped from the room. His boyfriend’s eyes were bloodshot and the whole experience seemed to have taken all the mental and physical strength from his body. As they rounded the corner, someone grabbed Draco’s forearm, right over his Dark Mark. He flinched and yanked his hand away, but the grip tightened.
“No, you won’t,” Knowles growled. “Back to your seats, both of you. He’s fine. Twenty points from Slytherin for interrupting the lesson, Malfoy.”
1 Month Later...
Platform 9¾ was packed when he arrived, parents dragging excited children towards the scarlet steam engine, owls screeching, toads croaking and cats hissing from their baskets. Trunks dragged along the smooth floor, teens crashing into Draco as they passed on the way to greet their friends after a long summer apart. Despite the ruckus, the mood on the platform was still sombre. It was not as packed as it should have been, even with the Eighth Years winding through the fray. The last time many had been at the castle, they had been fighting for their lives. They had survived a war but were now grieving the loss of family members, friends, loved ones and classmates. Students held each other tightly, whispering softly into each other’s ears, wiping tears from each other’s eyes and promising that they would be there for each other. Parents’ smiles were forced, as though they were unwilling to let their children leave them again, though they knew the fighting had come to an end.
Draco’s lips twitched and he turned his head to meet Izzy’s gaze. “No. But… maybe things will get better. For all of us.”
“Also, I’d prefer to go by Black. Being forcefully reminded that I am related to that bag of cats is starting to wear on my patience. No offence to cats.” She gave McGonagall a sideways glance.
“We’re home,'' he whispered. And they stepped together onto the crowded platform. They were going home.
“I see,” the Headmistress nodded. “Ms Black, then.”
Any characters/ships/settings you want to see more of?
He took the money gratefully and pulled her into another hug. “Visit,” he mumbled as she stepped back towards the door.
However, Draco shook his head. The girl obviously thought that Theo was dead and after what happened to her brother, Draco refused to allow her to believe she had been insensitive. “He’s in Azkaban,” he muttered. “Two years.”
Andromeda made the introductions. “Ella, this is Harry. And you already know Hermione.”
Weasley went bright red and he spluttered incomprehensibly as Granger tried to hide her smile behind her hand as Blaise continued.
Now, stuck here in the Manor, as he had once been, facing the burden of fear they had once shared, facing Hogwarts, facing the Golden trio, facing hate and misery and pain, Draco missed that sweet, sweet boy.
Izzy pulled up her sleeve, revealing her Dark Mark. Swirls of faded colour circled the ugly tattoo, taking the form of an emerald-eyed snake, the shadow of a dementor and a braid of daisies. Draco slowly raised his eyes to his cousin’s face, which was, for once, emotionless.
“It was Helena, wasn’t it? The Grey Lady?” The raven-haired boy asked tentatively.
Hermione’s eyes widened. “That’s a lot for someone who’s only just come of age. I thought the people who joined when they were underage only got one year.”
Harry sighed. "Fine. It'll have to be tomorrow night though because drinks is the night after that and I'm not missing that,” he said a little more playfully, and Draco kissed him again.
"That's right," Snyde said with an ugly, lopsided grin. "You remember my father, do you? I thought he mustn't've been worth your time."
Draco drifted in and out of consciousness; for how long, he wasn't sure. When he was somewhat lucid, he tried to stand, to take the weight off his wrists, but he was too weak to hold the position for long. The rope cut into his skin, rubbing it raw, reopening the wounds each time he shifted so that blood dripped down and mingled with the crusted over cuts on his forearms. In his wakefulness, he knew that Lucius was no longer there, dragging the tip of his wand over his cuts, mocking what Draco had done to himself. But in the fits of sleep in between those moments of clarity, he felt like his father was still there, tormenting him.
"I think we should start over," Harry said.
He let go just as abruptly and turned back to the sink, gripping the edge with shaky hands. Harry was stunned, rooted in place.
Draco tried to follow what Harry was saying, gulping down huge breaths. Slowly, gradually, he found he could breathe normally again. He kept staring into Harry's eyes, focusing on the colour, the intensity, as he felt the sensation come back into his limbs and the feeling of danger melted away. He was safe. He was safe because he was with Harry.
