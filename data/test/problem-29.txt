‘And she doesn’t wish you were dead?’ Harry sounded impressed rather than incredulous which was nice if a little bewildering. Mostly because Draco was just impressed by Hannah’s nature and not a little confused by it.
He lifted his other hand up so that he was gripping his glass with both, twisting it and turning it, in a thoughtful if nervous manner. He turned to look out the window, taking in the blurred shadows that were people walking on the street outside and he thought about what he wanted, about why he’d sent her that sketch and why he’d agreed to meet.
‘It does though. You were just a kid, Hermione, why should you have been the one to fix everything? Don’t you think you were already doing enough? You and the Weasel were Harry’s entire emotional support system for the better part of seven years.’ Draco paused, considered his words and then said, ‘I spent a lot of time watching Harry, I’ll admit it, and do you know what I noticed? The isolation, the way he didn’t talk to anyone but the two of you. Maybe he’d talk to the twins occasionally,’ he conceded. ‘And sometimes the others in your house but only in your year or those on the quidditch team. Is it really any wonder that, at first, I thought that he thought he was better than everyone else – the famous Boy Who Lived? But that’s not Harry, I know that now, I’ve known it for years.
Obviously sensing that they might finally be getting somewhere, Draco had kicked off his shoes and shuffled across the short space between them to press into Harry’s side. He took Harry’s face in both hands, cupping his cheeks tenderly and forced him to look at him.
Weasley paled beneath his freckles, the tips of his ears turned pink and he floundered for a moment before he hurried to say, ‘I mean she’s not exactly…’ he trailed off clearly aware there was no hope of recovering from this.
He still remembered Luna’s tear stained face as she panted heavily, eyes looking up at him wide and terrified as she whispered out, ‘Thank you.’
Kreacher disappeared with a soft snap – so far removed from the sharp cracks he once travelled with and a physical reminder that he was being properly cared for now. Draco looked up to see Hermione scowling at him in disapproval. Draco ignored her look and took a seat beside her on the sofa, spreading some of the papers he was carrying across his lap and onto the floor at his feet.
The two captured wizards weren’t so lucky. Still crouched in the road, Draco snapped a powerful stunner at the one trying to curse him and slapped a more traditional body bind on the other. As it wasn’t normally his job to capture dark wizards – or anyone for that matter – he didn’t have any of the portkeys aurors and members of the MLE often used to tag and transport suspects. He’d just have to hope his spells held until someone else came along to scoop them up.
Draco grinned, patted him on the shoulder in an intentionally patronising manner, and got up to go get the ingredients they’d need from the store cupboard. He was aware of all the stares following him but with Harry back and treating him like a friend and not a Death Eater, Draco didn’t much care. Harry had quashed any remaining fears Draco had about how things would be between them now that they were back at Hogwarts. Maybe he could finally start enjoying his lessons again.
Draco might have come a long way from the arrogant prat he’d been before the war but that didn’t mean he didn’t relish an opportunity to be the one Harry chose. He might be becoming a better person, but he still had a long way to go before he stopped taking advantage of something like that. He wasn’t sure he’d ever have it in him. Especially when it came to Harry. He’d spent years watching the way Harry was with his friends, he’d worried for weeks over whether or not Harry would change his mind about him once confronted with his friends’ disapproval.
‘Charlie?’ Harry repeated, for a moment he looked confused but then his expression brightened. ‘Charlie.’
‘Harry didn’t have friends,’ he stated bluntly. ‘He didn’t have a single adult in his life that loved him. You need to understand that he was isolated, that he was the only person he could trust or rely on and then – first thing he does on the train to Hogwarts and a new life – he meets a boy his own age who finds him interesting and wants to talk to him and be his friend.’
Hermione’s expression softened. ‘I know – Harry does too.’ She studied him for a long moment before she said, ‘We knew that you’d take it badly, Harry wanted to give you time to get to know Draco, to see how much he’s changed, before he told you. We all just assumed that you’d be mad and hurt because it’s Draco – none of us imagined you’d say the things you did.’
By the time they walked away from the stall, Harry was left considering that even with his muggle education prior to attending Hogwarts, the children in that man’s family were far better educated than Harry and possibly even Draco, who had been getting some extra tutelage prior to Voldemort’s return.
What did Granger know about proper traditions and magic when hers was a shallow corruption of everything Draco had ever been taught? Of the things he knew to be true?
don’t understand,’ he told Granger. ‘I knew exactly what I was doing. Those runes did exactly what I expected of them.’
Hermione, who was risking life and limb by staying over the shop with George for the holidays, had visited the Manor more than once. She’d braved her own memories of the war and her torture at Bella’s hands to show her support for Harry. Ginny, who didn’t have any memories of the war regarding Malfoy Manor, had easily followed Luna through the floo every morning with the reasoning that she couldn’t stand looking at her brother’s mopey face every day.
Moving through the surging crowd of muggles, Harry pointed his wand into the air and shouted a Ministry spell that shot something that, to the muggles, probably looked like a glitter bomb, high into the air. The sparks shot high into the sky like a brilliant firework before dropping down with a woosh, latching single fine specks onto anyone in the area, marking them for tracking and obliviation later by Ministry officials. It wouldn’t get them all, would be a hell of a night’s work – possibly even longer – but depending on the size of the village it could help keep speculation from getting out into the wider muggle world.
I have put Astoria's signs in bold and kept them blunt and to the point because she's only been signing for a year and Draco, a month or two. I am also aware that when signing sentence structure is a bit different but it's been about fifteen years since I've had to sign anything more than the alphabet or a thank you so I thought I'd just stick with this.
As he approached the door, Draco cast a series of diagnostic charms Bill had taught him while Harry cast a few he’d been taught. There didn’t seem to be anything worrying about the house itself now that the initial wards had come down and so he simply walked in through the open door, Harry a step behind him. They both paused on a shudder inside and immediately whipped back around in alarm.
by people he loved and trusted to believe a certain thing and you just – what? You think that after a couple of months in Azkaban that all just goes away? How can you be so naïve? How can you truly believe that someone can change so much that you just love him unconditionally? How can you believe someone changed so much – how have you tricked yourself into believing it to the point where he’s speaking in nothing but Parseltongue?’
Harry nodded. ‘Yeah, okay, and most of those are held on the first couple of floors. Not much foot traffic to notice someone turned this corridor into a fucking sex trap.’
After some careful probing and some unsuccessful spellwork, Draco was left with little choice but to perform a controlled break of the wards.
He’d known before he even set foot on Platform 9 ¾ that coming back to Hogwarts would be hard. He’d known that so many of the things he’d done and was doing to redeem his name would go unnoticed by most of the wizarding world and he was okay with that. The choices he made now weren’t about anyone other than himself. They weren’t about living up to what his father expected of him or the things his mother had always wanted for him. He was no longer making choices based around the Malfoy name or what it meant to be a pureblood wizard.
He woke to blistering warmth, layers of warm blankets and the presence of a solid male body wrapped around his own. When he opened his eyes the soft sunlight didn’t burn, it didn’t come through a tiny window by the floor but a series of windows taking up two walls and the clear sight of sky and forest.
was from the cemetery and not their dinner date or the visit to the house where Harry would have grown up if not for Voldemort. Draco had the distinct memory of wrapping and arm around Harry’s shoulders and holding him close as they studied all the messages left behind by visiting witches and wizards and he was positive he’d kissed Harry on the street outside the restaurant.
Harry frowned, not bothering to question why he was only just now hearing about this and why it was Draco knew and he didn’t when Hermione had been avoiding them both. ‘Why does she feel guilty for talking to Ron?’
He spent longer than was strictly necessary browsing through the aisles and ended up buying more than the beer and bottle he’d gone in for but that just meant he didn’t have as long to wait, standing around with his stomach rumbling amidst all the good smells.
‘So unfair,’ Draco murmured but he pulled away from Harry, drew his wand and set his mind back on the task at hand.
Katherine Delaney, a short witch, fresh from training, was paired up with a stooped and elderly black man who was missing an ear and had a massive scar slicing through the white scruffy beard on the left side of his face. Mustafa sent them up to sweep through the first and second floors while he said he and his partner, a tall, delightfully curvy Samoan woman who Draco honestly thought could take him down in a fight with her eyes closed (and who he found startlingly attractive – so did Harry judging by the way he glanced at her as he walked up to them, clocking her curves and the dangerous glint in her eye with considerable appreciation) were set to take the third and fourth.
Astara, though, was looking at her with wide eyed wonder. ‘Daddy tells stories about you!’ she exclaimed. She turned sparkling eyes on Malfoy. ‘Papa, is she really Hermione Granger?’
‘I bought you clean clothes,’ she murmured, nodding to the neatly folded stack she’d deposited on the next bed. ‘You should change. Have a shower.’
Harry grinned. Draco felt the way his lips tugged up into a smile where they were pressed against his bare shoulder, just above the tattoo of the stag and Luna’s moons.
Kate, all of seven years old, was not immune to love or too young to pick it when it was staring her right in the face because she went all soft and dreamy and asked, ‘Are you in love?’
Granger looked devastated, as if he’d just slapped her rather than drop a few truths that he didn’t understand how she could have overlooked. As though none of the things he’d brought up were things she’d considered when making her decisions, even though Harry was looking distinctly uncomfortable next to him which suggested these were things he’d considered. How could he not? He might not like his muggle relatives, but the Order had chosen to hide them, not erase their memories. Hiding them kept them safe, no matter how undeserving. Wiping their memories would have made them ripe for Voldemort’s taking and as much as Harry hated his relatives, he wouldn’t have stood by and let them get hurt.
Coming back to Hogwarts might have been part of his probation after his term in Azkaban but it was also an important step in reclaiming his life as his own. He needed to get decent NEWTs if he had even a hope of getting a decent job – something he’d never even considered before Voldemort. But more than that, this year would be a buffer of sorts, allowing him a foray into the wizarding world without actually stepping out into it. It was a year, where he could keep his head down and work on his studies, it was a year where he could show the changes he’d made to his life and his attitude, one more year to prepare himself for the harsh realities of life as an ex-Death Eater in the wizarding world.
Draco had only managed to grunt in acknowledgment of Bill’s words, somehow managing to convey a desire for an explanation while trying not to end up cursed. He liked his fingers exactly where they were and didn’t fancy having to allow Pomfrey or Bill to reattach them. It might have been a mild curse he’d been set to dismantle but he was struggling to use the new diagnostic spell Bill was teaching him because it required so much attention to detail in a type of magic Draco had never used before.
‘We’re paired up already,’ Slughorn said jovially, ‘Odd numbers, though, so I won’t say no to the three of you working together.’ Slughorn gave Harry a gentle push in the direction of the two Gryffindors, clearly expecting Harry to scramble eagerly toward them.
It didn’t erase seventeen years of pureblood upbringing that had made Draco’s first words to Harry that morning a snide remark. It didn’t erase the way he couldn’t just say thank you or the way Harry’s temper got the better of him and he’d stomped out before Draco could find a way around his own pride to apologise. Sheer stubbornness (and a little gentle shoving from Luna) had driven Harry back.
Dumbledore had left Hermione clues, but it had taken them months to decipher them.  How many more lives could have been saved with a simple conversation with the old headmaster about the Hallows? How many lives could have been saved if any of a million different actions had been taken? How many lives would have been saved if people had put less store in prophecy?
The look on Slughorn’s face was priceless and the moment his back was turned he and Harry glanced at each other and shared a laugh.
One he did know the answer to, and one that had hurt to hear when the mind healer had brought it up, was his relationship with Hermione in those first months of school – and a lot of the time after that when they were friends.
Draco tried to look annoyed, but it came off looking pleased, so he gave up on that idea and drew his wand to cast the first of many (many) spells for the day. ‘Close your eyes, focus on our connection and tell me if you notice anything.’
‘Do you think we should head back?’ Harry wondered, lifting up an arm to check the time on the watch he’d gotten from the Weasleys when he’d turned seventeen.
Okay. That might have been a lie. Maybe he was enjoying the power display a little, but no one was around to judge him for it and that meant no one was about to roll their eyes at him for enjoying Harry’s display of magic and power in his defence. He did so love the way Harry got all possessive and protective – even when it wasn’t actually necessary.
He made it through the rest of the week; it wasn’t easy, but the classes helped keep him distracted and Luna tried her best not to leave him alone where another student might try to take advantage and hex him. She couldn’t be with him all the time, though, and he was hexed and jinxed and spelled numerous times by students who now seemed to think it was acceptable. He never said a word about it. He relied on his training with Harry and everything his father and Bellatrix had taught him to block, repel and counter everything thrown his way.
‘I’ll have to research magical tattoos,’ Hermione’s gaze seemed aimed over Draco’s shoulder as she made a mental note to herself. ‘We couldn’t tell any of this was happening.’
None of them showed any signs of going off to bed. It seemed even Luna and Ginny were settling in to wait with him as long as it took.
When he’d pointed that out to Robards, the gruff head auror scowled at him and snapped, ‘I know Potter. Why do you think I assigned Winthrop and Mendenhall?’
‘No, I don’t,’ Harry countered, crossing his arms. ‘I’ve got the time.’ And Hermione had a good point about interhouse unity and erasing prejudice.
, was what he didn’t say, and Draco realised, rather stupidly, that the thought had never occurred to him. He and Harry didn’t need to be touching to draw on each other, they just sort of hovered at the edge of each other’s awareness, always there, always waiting for the connection to be pulled or pushed in a certain direction. It had never occurred to him to draw on that magic and even if it had of occurred to Harry, Draco still would have needed to shape the magic Harry pushed his way.
It hadn’t happened that way, but it could have. Just like he might have failed Ginny in second year because he was a stupid kid who thought he could handle the world. Or all the ways he’d failed to understand Sirius, to just be with him while they had the chance. The way he could have killed Draco, or simply not saved him, they were all things that could have happened, that he’d feared would happen and his brain kept throwing them at him when all he wanted to do was sleep.
Harry made an annoyed sound that tickled the sensitive slope of Draco’s neck and he shivered at the pleasant sensation. Harry’s hand slipped under his jumper and started to stroke the bare skin of his stomach. If not for the nature of their conversation, it might have started a soft heat that got his blood flowing south.
So no, Draco might have thought about it, but he would never turn his back on magic and this life he was creating from the ruins of his old just because he’d done some stupid things in the past. He had way too much to live for to let Voldemort win one more time.
Not that Harry will tell her that, she doesn’t need more power over the two of them, she currently wields enough. Whether this was how he saw the night going or not, Ginny is literally cradling their future inside her right now and it is honestly terrifying.
He hoped he wasn’t too late. He hoped she was one more person who would forgive him the sins of the past. Even if he didn’t deserve it.
But Harry didn’t think Hermione needed to hear that. Not yet anyway. He supposed there might come a time, if Ron didn’t settle into himself and learn from all his past mistakes, that Hermione would be quite happy to let Harry point out Ron’s flaws and criticise his many failings. Harry was just trying not to be too eager about that possibility. He didn’t want to give Ron that much of his time and energy at the moment. He just wanted to quietly hate him for a bit but sort of in the background where it didn’t impact on his day and was just something that occurred to him at random moments when he was forced to remember Ron’s existence.
Draco was going to blame the tone on Harry, they were usually more friendly with Draco, yet when they’d first arrived in the bank, Harry had been surrounded by angry looking security goblins and given a list of rules he had to abide by while he was in the bank if he ever wanted access to his gold again. One such rule was that Draco was to be in possession of Harry’s wand. Harry had handed it over easy enough and let the goblins do their search to make sure he wasn’t carrying any sort of artefact or concealing any form of enchantments he might use to break into other vaults.
The common room was empty when he came back and that saved him having to stop and talk to Granger or the Weasel. It meant he got to quietly slip back into bed beside Harry and drift off without any kind of interrogation. He did have to shuffle Athena a bit to make room. She’d decided in his absence to stretch her body as long as she could across the warm space he’d left.
‘He’s already useful,’ Harry snapped, but the anger he’d been feeling had subsided somewhat in the face of Robards concern and his obvious regard (and respect) for Draco.
He was gone before Ron could say anything else and then he was so busy trying to catch up and learn the differences working for the British Ministry versus the Australian one that Friday rolled around without any other sign of Harry, although Hermione said she’d gotten an owl asking them to meet for dinner.
Harry, pressed as close to him as he was, felt his flinch. He didn’t acknowledge it, though he did ask, ‘Can it wait?’
He smirked at her. ‘Oh, I assure you, it is.’ She opened her mouth, no doubt to ask a ridiculous number of questions but Draco cut her off. ‘Now, if you’ll excuse us, I believe I was promised a blow job.’ And he dragged Harry inside and up to their room, making sure to lock the door behind them before she could catch up. He did hear her frustrated shout following them up the stairs.
‘Sorry,’ Harry offered, looking and sounding genuinely apologetic, which Draco assumed was due to the prospect of spending days and weeks (Merlin, don’t let it take months) cleaning up and sorting through the Lestrange vaults.
Harry nods. ‘It went about as well as you can expect, he said something, I said something, pretty sure the only reason it didn’t come to blows was that we were in a muggle area.’
The fact that he had indeed healed overnight as she herself had predicted seemed to both satisfy and annoy her and although she tried to convince him to stay in bed and eat breakfast he staunchly refused. During the night one of the house elves had left a neat pile of his clothes by the bed and he’d already pulled on clean pants and jeans when Luna sat up and blinked at him.
Longbottom grinned. ‘Don’t die,’ he offered cheerfully before he started off across the Entrance Hall.
His father had changed when he’d returned from his short stay. He was quieter, gaunt, shadows constantly under his eyes and his loyalty hadn’t quite been the same.
Hermione very clearly wanted to ask what he meant by that, but she changed her mind and instead nodded. Ron seemed relieved, like he didn’t know how to deal with Harry in this situation. Harry couldn’t help wondering if it was the lingering dislike he harboured for Draco or if it was watching Harry care so much about someone who wasn’t him or Hermione. It didn’t matter, not really, Harry was just in a dark mood and he was looking too deeply into things and creating feelings that weren’t there.
Draco called out to her as she started to walk away. ‘Hermione!’ When she turned to look at him, he said firmly, ‘It’s not your fault.’
They stood staring at each other for a long moment which was only interrupted by Lisa Turpin announcing from a chair by the fire, ‘You are both disgustingly sappy. I think I just revisited my dinner.’
Kate, on the other hand, wasn’t put off by the potential of talking to a former Death Eater because her startled response to Draco’s arrival was a breathy, ‘You look like a prince!’
‘Why did you do this?’ Draco gasped, eyes betrayed and full of pain. ‘I loved you. How could you do this?’
Of course, it was his father, he should have known the encounter wouldn’t go as either of them expected.
Draco gave him a dry look. ‘I do so love how you made that sound like it will be you in those vaults sorting through paperwork and having artefacts evaluated.’
They’d only turned up one more curse like the one Draco and his second years had triggered – Bill and Fleur had found that one in the dungeon. It had been another blood curse with a much sturdier trigger and even after careful study, neither of the curse breaking Weasleys had been able to identify just what was set to trigger it. It had the same magical signature though, so there was some comfort to be taken in the knowledge that just one witch or wizard had been responsible.
‘I don’t know,’ Harry admitted. ‘I think if I’d realised how much you weren’t playing up your injuries, I might have better understood everything that came after.’
He and Draco had history, yes, and a nasty one full of bullying and physical violence at that, but they had faced those things head on, talked them to death until they understood and healed and that was why he and Draco could love each other now. Facing those actions, learning how it impacted them – how Draco felt knowing everyone assumed he’d bought his way onto the quidditch team or why Harry reacted the way he did to remarks about his schoolwork – that was how they could be in a relationship.
After his release from Azkaban he’d been so skinny and weak. Some of his bones had been broken and hadn’t healed right (again), he’d been malnourished, pale and he’d had a lot of trouble with his magic. No healer had wanted to treat him at home and his house arrest left him unable to try his luck at St Mungo’s. Harry had once again gone to Madam Pomfrey for help and Draco had been given a strict regimen of nutritional potions, orders to spend as much time outside as possible for the sunlight and fresh air and told to take up some muggle exercise to build back his physical strength. She’d told him it would help with his magic as well and she’d been right.
Harry grinned. ‘Thanks, but it’s not a secret. You can shout it from the Astronomy Tower if you want to.’
Draco’s alarm disappeared and he felt his lips tug up into a smirk. He read the caption under the photo before he trailed eyes up to the bold headline. He nudged Harry in the ribs with his elbow, ‘You’re still the dashing hero, I see.’
Harry rolled his eyes and started to tug Draco out of the room, before Turpin could act on the vengeful look that crossed her face at his teasing.
Draco pulled a face, but Harry grinned. ‘You know, this is the second time I’m hearing about these fantasies,’ he teased.
‘I buy him fancy chocolate all the time,’ Harry replied, returning his attention to a drawer that had tried to take a bite out of his fingers when he’d taken his attention off it. He gave it a stern poke before adding, ‘He’s fucking addicted to this raspberry cream thing they have at Honeydukes.’
‘You can go,’ he told them. They hadn’t come for Draco; they’d come to check on Harry and it grated on him. Luna was here for Draco, Merlin so was Ginny, but Ron and Hermione had only come for Harry and he didn’t want to deal with their questions or watch them trying to build up more than a passing concern for someone they still hated and didn’t trust.
Draco makes a sound as though he wants to speak but doesn’t actually know what he’s supposed to say in response. Ginny tips her head forward and looks at him expectantly.
Kreacher nodded, glared at Hermione when he thought Draco wasn’t looking (Draco didn’t actually care whether or not Kreacher showed Hermione respect as she in turn did not respect Kreacher as far as Kreacher was concerned) and disappeared again.
But it wasn’t okay because he didn’t find Ron or Hermione and so he sat alone in the compartment and waited, wondering if they were running late, if they’d come looking for him and he kept wondering that for hours and hours until he’d have welcomed even a confrontation with Malfoy but even he didn’t show his face and the deep gaping hole in Harry’s chest that had started in those first few weeks of summer, yawned bigger and bleaker than ever as he realised that last year was a lie and that he didn’t have friends who were worried about him or looking forward to seeing him again.
‘Like muggle physiotherapy,’ Hermione nodded, sounding impressed. ‘I didn’t even know Madam Pomfrey knew about that sort of thing. She certainly never did anything like that with Harry and you know he ended up in her care a lot.’
That probably would have been the end of the conversation if Hermione hadn’t slipped into the spot beside Ron and questioned, ‘You don’t have access to your money? How have you been buying things?’
Harry opened his mouth, couldn’t come up with a rebuttal and growled. ‘Merlin knows why,’ he settled for muttering.
‘Do you still speak to them?’ Draco wondered, thoughts still on that first time he and Blaise had perfected the lubricant charm and had some fun with Daphne.
He’d looked at the both of them helplessly, not knowing how to interpret the expressions on their faces.
It wasn’t something that had occurred to Draco, but he had noticed the general sense of the castle was lighter, more hopeful, in a way it hadn’t been even before the war. He hoped the investigation into the harmless charms and spells placed around the castle wouldn’t bring that sense down and darken it again. He suspected there was no avoiding the chill that would fall over the castle once the investigation into the harmful spells and enchantments had turned up what answers they could.
His heart twinged with possessiveness – with a rightness that had him feeling smug and called back to the conversation they’d had the night before about marriage and names and a future that was becoming firmer and firmer in Draco’s mind. The one he’d never have thought he could have after everything he’d done as a kid and during the war.
And Harry is forced to realise that perhaps Ginny is angrier than he’s realised, if that is even possible.
Last year, he’d been nervous and excited, so full of hope for what magic could bring into his life. Sure, there’d been that thing with Voldemort and Quirrell but there’d been classes and quidditch and Ron and Hermione.
‘I listen,’ Draco answered. ‘I observe.’ His stomach rumbled. ‘I am late to meet Harry and Luna for dinner.’
It was as if the ward itself detonated. Heat flared around Draco, seeming to crawl up his arm through his very veins. He gritted his teeth against a snarl of pain and focused his power down into the ward, fuelling the crude spell as it tore the ward apart. Somewhere deeper in the house he heard glass breaking and a moment later a pipe exploded, filling the house with the added sounded of rushing water.
Hermione nodded, still staring at Harry but not really seeing him as he finished dressing and moved to the bed and his dinner. He was careful not to sit on Athena who was still hidden beneath the duvet.
Of course, there was every chance it hadn’t been quietly waiting for someone or something to trigger it. But Draco was not about to think about that possibility just now. Much better to assume it was left over from the battle and the Death Eater occupation and then build up to other more worrying possibilities.
It was hard. People died. But Harry played the role. He faked confusion and anger and a whole host of other things. He’d gotten very good at lying over the years. Very good at pretending and hiding. He’d managed to conceal an affair for five years. Managed to hide where he was really getting most of his insight into Voldemort’s activities from for just as many.
Harry had heaved again, spilling what little remained in his stomach out into the sea. The wizard controlling the boat didn’t even bat an eye, he’d seen this before (was actually quite surprised Harry hadn’t done it before given how often he visited) but for Harry this trip was different. He’d thought when he first started visiting Draco that he owed it to Narcissa, he’d thought he was doing it out of some weird obligation because he hadn’t been able to keep Draco out of Azkaban the way he had his mother.
For a moment, months ago, when she’d been stood up before them to address the plans to clear the castle, Draco had thought she looked tired. He’d thought she’d looked wary and done in with all the fallout from the war, but now she seemed tiny, seated behind her desk. She looked, for the first time Draco could remember, old. Which was ridiculous because she’d not even had time to embrace her sixties yet and had no reason to look twenty years older.
The Dursleys had just been glad he wasn’t underfoot as they prepared to uproot their lives and the Order, who should have been closely watching for his comings and goings (because there shouldn’t have been any) missed it entirely because as far as they could tell, Harry never left. How could he? He was underage, still subject to the trace, and was perfectly aware of the dangers. Slipping out from the careful watch of the Order was a stupid risky move and, although he was prone to those, he’d made a much more concerted effort since the death of Albus Dumbledore to not put others (or himself) at risk.
It didn’t. It might have been true but there were things Harry was beginning to understand about their school quidditch matches that didn’t make him feel particularly generous to Madam Hooch. And weirdly made him respect the fact that Lucius had purchased seven Nimbus 2001s and not just given Draco one.
‘Close enough.’ But Harry pushed to his feet and held his hands out to help them both up. ‘Better not risk it though. Kingsley and Robards won’t care but it won’t look good to the rest of them if you’re getting special treatment.’
Maybe if he’d been forced to sit through a Muggle Studies class as a child, he would have seen how much of what his father was pushing him to believe was complete dragon dung.
‘Oh, I’m not disagreeing. Just informing you that I am both older and wiser and know not to be stupid enough to mess with you. Even if I didn’t think Harry would hex me for it.’
‘No,’ he’d agreed, ‘but you can put a stop to them for a night – just one – so that we can deal with what’s causing them.’
‘You can’t leave!’ the junior auror blurted out, sounding horrified that his suspect was up and planning to simply stroll away. Draco could sympathise, it was hardly going to look good on any upcoming evaluations. Of course, the fact that he’d stood by and watched over
She and Ron had seen the whole thing and it had been awful. They’d rounded the corner in time to watch a couple of seventh years step out from an alcove and fire curses at Malfoy’s back. what happened then was a bit of a blur because Hermione had a disjointed moment of being there in the corridor and back in a different corridor during the war and when she managed to shake off the sucking feeling of being back there, Malfoy was slumping to the floor blood covering his robes and a piece of glass sticking out of his shoulder.
‘That was a bit mean,’ Harry informed him lightly, but Draco noticed he wasn’t doing anything to break from his hold, nor to prevent Draco from locking the door on his friend.
Harry groaned, swooped in for a quick kiss and then stepped back. ‘For that,’ Harry grouched, ‘you can come running with me tomorrow.’
Harry tentatively crouched down to get a good look at the rusted metal claws attempting to gnaw through Draco’s boot. ‘Fuck, yeah, okay.’
‘He asked me on a date,’ she admitted, sitting down at the Gryffindor table across from them at lunch as though she hadn’t been avoiding them for days. ‘A proper one.’
Mendenhall stomped across the short stretch of road to assist them; Draco’s brief glance didn’t tell him where Winthrop had gone when he looked back to check on his spell. Both wizards were jerked beneath the car when his spell took hold and dragged toward him, one of them was firing spells at the purple bands around his legs, the other, more sensibly, fired them at Draco. They weren’t complex spells and they bounced harmlessly off a lazily erected shield charm.
His attempt at some form of diplomacy drew a snort of derision from Hermione. ‘Yes, Ron, they’re called boobs.’
Ron didn’t move. Harry was the one to get to his feet. ‘I’m – uh – I’m going to go back to looking for the rest of Draco’s present.’
worked with Draco clearing the Manor, but he was one of many. The offer of lessons had almost certainly come about because Bill knew how deeply Harry loved Draco and he’d seen an opportunity for the man he was coming to know and respect to drag himself out from under the stigma of being a Malfoy and a Death Eater.
Draco and honestly thought he was barmy for buying the bloke a Christmas present when he could have just owl ordered some chocolate and been done with it.
Harry, mature person that he was, stuck his tongue out. He turned back to Longbottom. ‘Seriously Neville, what’s the worst that could happen? Just take her into Hogsmeade, go for a bit of a walk and then take her for a drink at the Three Broomsticks.’
Harry did wonder if she’d mentioned to any of her friends who she was asking before she’d approached Draco because he didn’t imagine they’d have thought that a good idea, let alone a good idea to do alone.
Honestly, if he weren’t lying on the bed with his right thigh shredded, blood soaking what remained of his jeans, and a shard of stained glass embedded (rather painfully) in his left shoulder, he might have found the looks on Granger and Weasley’s faces hilarious. As it was, his thigh was shredded, his shoulder had been stabbed and it was taking everything he had not to break down and sob.
Draco on the other hand, was confused. ‘I’m sorry, isn’t this a good thing? You didn’t want them to know about our world because it was dangerous.’
articles are helping too,’ Hermione murmured when Draco voiced this observation. ‘You’re always with Harry and always doing something for the Ministry to help stop dark magic.’
‘Besides,’ Draco added, with a smirk. ‘I slipped a portkey onto your wrist when you weren’t looking.’
‘Oh Merlin,’ Harry breathed, burying his face into Draco’s chest hoping that the familiar warmth would force the lingering hooks of his nightmares to stay they hell out of his head.
Harry read the question there and answered as if Draco had spoken. ‘The whole of wizarding society is built on nepotism,’ he stated. ‘I don’t think it really occurred to me until just now but back before fourth year, before I really knew anything about the Ministry or how our government functions – which it doesn’t, but also why weren’t we taught that? – it didn’t occur to me that Arthur knew practically everyone in the Ministry – and they all seemed to owe him bloody favours.’
grown and changed after the war even while they’d stayed the same, just as Harry had. Hermione wasn’t prying (exactly), she wasn’t judging, she was just asking. She wanted to know these things because she was his friend and she loved him, and she saw now how much he loved Draco and she wanted to know that what she was seeing was real and true and that Harry really was happy and safe – loved in a way he’d never been loved before.
It might have been subtly trying to push away unwanted visitors, but it wasn’t doing a particularly effective job of it. The aurors were aware of it and, as he knew Harry’s strength and power well enough to judge how easily his boyfriend could sense the ward, Draco wouldn’t be surprised if Harry could taste it on the air, the same way he could.
But in fifth year, Draco was still a proper Malfoy and one who believed in everything the Dark Lord stood for. He believed that those with the wrong type of blood shouldn’t be allowed an education at Hogwarts, he believed that the Dark Arts should be taught and that their place in society shouldn’t be consigned to quiet corners and warded homes and back alleys and shady places in Knockturn. He believed, because he saw no reason not to, that he was better than those whose blood was not pure and that the Dark Lord was right to educate them.
Draco raised his brows. ‘They’re not supposed to fade. They’re blood runes. They’re supposed to dry and flake once the magic wears off and then you just wash away the rest.’
With all the wards and spells on his door the other students never heard his screams or the whimpers from his nightmares that might have urged them to come see what all the fuss was about. Even if only to laugh and tell him he deserved them.
‘Don’t apologise,’ she told him softly, shrugging off his words as though they were unnecessary – he felt they were. ‘I’m not trying to tell you what you feel is wrong,’ she murmured, ‘I’m just trying to understand how it happened.’
Draco nodded. ‘Give me your hand. I think if I use you to boost the spell I can send it through the entire corridor.’
Weasley gaped after her as the rest of the Hall turned away, disappointed by the lack of a fight. Granger also looked at McGonagall’s retreating form, but it was once again with a deeply thoughtful look. He had the uncomfortable feeling that look was going to cause him trouble.
Unconcerned by the sharpness in his tone, Harry did as he’d requested, stepping fully outside to stand in front of Mendenhall and Winthrop. He might have been happy to stand outside and wait but he still felt the need to to casually lean back in – head poking through the bloody ward – just to observe Draco work.
And he was just really fucking grateful Ginny hadn’t been home and that neither Molly nor Arthur had found the time to mention that little outburst to Draco. He’d never – NEVER – live that down.
Harry’s Killing Curse hit Voldemort from behind. He hadn’t been expecting it. He spun trying to evade it, but it was the Killing Curse and it hit his side with the same finality as if it had hit him square in the back as Harry had intended.
Harry grinned, he closed the distance between them with slow languid steps and reached out to hook a finger through the belt loops of Draco’s jeans, tugging him close to shed the last bit of space between them. Draco’s own hands went to Harry’s chest, sliding up smooth skin until they reached his neck and slid into his hair. He leant in close until his breath ghosted over Harry’s lips, he could feel the way Harry’s breath hitched in anticipation and then he grinned. He dropped one hand back to Harry’s chest and shoved.
Unfortunately, now that he’d seen Ron looking to talk to him – and looking like a kicked crup – Harry was stuck thinking about him. He’d done a decent job of avoiding Ron, not an easy thing given they shared all their classes and a common room, but he’d not been as successful in avoiding thinking about him. He’d tried to make it abundantly clear that he didn’t want anything to do with the man and, although the sad wistful looks Ron had been shooting at him (and Hermione) were starting to border on pathetic (Harry was stubbornly agreeing with Draco here even if Hermione wasn’t), Harry still felt no desire to smile and accept apologies as though he was perfectly willing to let everything go back to how it had been before.
Harry pretended not to have any idea what Weasley was talking about. He ignored the obvious rage and confusion Weasley was exuding and used his toast to indicate Luna. ‘You should hear what Luna has planned for Christmas.’
‘Ginny hated the way you wouldn’t talk to her about things,’ he offered into the darkness, feeling no guilt at sharing something Ginny had told him. If she hadn’t wanted Harry to know, she’d have told Draco so. Even then it wouldn’t have made much difference. He kept no secrets from Harry, not now, not after all they’d been through.
‘Of course, it does,’ Draco had snapped back. ‘I love you, why the fuck would I let you go through this alone?’
He didn’t tell his friends that, though, what he said instead was, ‘He’s got permanent nerve damage down his right leg from being held under
Luna accompanied Harry to Azkaban exactly once, three weeks into his sentence. At that point in time, he and Harry were still struggling with their new bonds of friendship and were frequently prone to sharp bitter words and moody silences. Harry would not have been nearly as receptive to the observation then as he was now.
She was no-nonsense, treated Kingsley like he was still the fresh-faced eighteen-year-old who’d turned up for his first day at the Auror academy, and had proven time and time again that, despite being on the wrong side of eighty, she could still tackle Dark Wizards (and Chosen Ones) in her sleep.
Harry had no idea where they were, just that they were still in England, and the sight was wondrous, capturing all the magic of his first moments in Diagon Alley all those years ago. There was a sense of excitement in the air, one of relief and hope because, as Draco had informed him before they arrived, the market hadn’t been run the last two winters, not with Voldemort ruling over the wizarding world and now these people could finally come back to show off their equipment and ingredients, their newly developed potions, and that feeling of relief and freedom hung over the market palpably.
Harry thought he was overreacting which just guaranteed that when Athena did bring something home Harry would be the one to deal with it.
‘Not now, Ron,’ he snapped, and, in his frustration, it was a lot less sharp than he would have been if he’d been wholly focused on his ex-best friend and not the potential for Draco to burst into flames. His magic popped ahead of him to open their bedroom door because his hands were scrambling to undress Draco as he pushed him inside.
Winthrop, who had been with Harry when Draco had last performed a break on some of Voldemort’s wards, shuddered and said, ‘Let’s not do that.’
‘I think I’ll let you figure it out.’ Draco took a bite of toast and deliberately changed the subject.
Draco scoffed, he didn’t have a choice and they all knew it. He’d gotten off easy with three months in Azkaban and a month of house arrest. This was just the price he had to pay for his freedom. It wasn’t like it was a bad price, either, under other circumstances he would have quite enjoyed the work, but both McGonagall and Harry were right to be worried. If he were anyone else then being called on by the Ministry to offer his Dark Arts expertise following the clean up after the war would have been an honour, something he could have built a respectable career on.
None of them had attempted to make excuses for Weasley’s behaviour. There couldn’t be any excuses for that, and even if there were, they’d all been so completely blindsided by it there wasn’t much chance they’d have managed anything coherent.
Ginny looks at him blankly for a moment and he waits for her mind to catch up with his words because it’s not like she’d be expecting it. Harry has never once expressed an interest in men. He’s never once expressed an interest in anyone other than Ginny, at least not as far as she’s aware.
He would not let Ron’s pathetic mopey look as he stood on the outside of Harry’s life looking in affect him at all. He would not give Ron that power over him. He wouldn’t. He couldn’t.
‘Do you think the Ministry will want it for their stores?’ Harry wondered, rubbing at his ear as though that could erase the beginnings of the cry they’d both heard.
Hermione made a small noise that might have been amusement but also might have been disgust at his and Harry’s complete lack of interest in the movement of their new tattoo. Draco honestly didn’t know how to make her understand that he didn’t much care that it moved between them or that it was the result of their bond because it was something else that showed his connection to Harry, and it was hardly harming either of them.
Surprised, the man nodded awkwardly and informed them, ‘No one in my family has been to Hogwarts in about six centuries. Its tradition to teach our children at home.’
‘It’s different than it was with Ginny,’ Hermione observed, her voice a whisper as she darted cautious eyes back to the bathroom.
He gently extracted his arm and started to wiggle his fingers to get the feeling back. He tried the same on his left, but it seemed as though Madam Pomfrey’s prediction was accurate and those pins and needles didn’t seem to be going anywhere any time soon. Gingerly, he slid the blankets off one side and had just succeeded in sliding one leg out of bed with the hope of acquiring some clothes and a bathroom when Pomfrey came bustling around the curtain and snapped at him to get back in bed until she’d finished her examination.
Draco had his doubts about the junior auror – he no longer felt bad for not learning his name. If he kept making such basic mistakes he wasn’t going to survive out in the field.
‘That’s rough,’ Longbottom chimed in, coming up behind them with Hannah Abbot. He clapped a hand on Draco’s back in sympathy. ‘Hannah and I are doing the greenhouses.’
Ginny shrugged, a little uncomfortably Draco rather thought. ‘He’s done it before, you know he has. He’s was a right arse when he turned up last Christmas. He’ll come around eventually; he always does. Probably only after we’ve all hexed him another two or three times – Mum’s already got a head start.’
Draco tried knocking Harry off his feet again but the Gryffindor took control of the movement, seizing his chance to tangle their feet and drag Draco down with him. There was a brief fight to gain the upper hand which ended with both of them lying on the floor in a tangle of limbs, each with a wand held at the throat of the other.
Draco looked at Pansy, looked at her properly for perhaps the first time in the entire fourteen years they’d been acquainted, and he realised what he’d been missing out on. He’d known for a while how distant and aloof he’d been as a child and a teenager, how the way his father acted and the lessons he’d been taught shaped his beliefs and his mannerisms but it wasn’t until that moment, face-to-face with someone who had likely witnessed it all, that he realised just how much he’d missed what was right in front of him.
McGonagall looked tired in a way she hadn’t since the war ended. Draco wouldn’t be telling her that, of course, but he made the observation in a quiet whisper to Harry who gave her a quick (not at all subtle) look and nodded his agreement. It wasn’t just McGonagall though, all the teachers seated at the long table behind her were looking tired and a touch defeated. The war was supposed to be over, their expressions said. He could read it in the tightness of shoulders, the sagging smiles, the way they’d each hoped the terror of Voldemort had been placed firmly behind them.
Draco had known of Harry’s possessive streak long before the incident and took a great deal of pleasure in knowing that this time around there would be no Ginny between them. This time, Harry had made the right choice from the beginning.
‘I think I’d like to know some of the traditions of my ancestors,’ Harry said thoughtfully, then he sharpened his gaze and gave Draco a look. ‘You definitely needed some Muggle Studies.’
According to Pansy, Blaise had spent a good five minutes laughing hysterically when she told him (via international floo) about his relationship with Harry. Daphne, by all accounts, had gotten a good giggle out of it and honestly, Draco didn’t mind that his old housemates were finding amusement in his relationship. It had given Pansy a reason to reach out to them and for that, Draco was more than happy to be the butt of a few jokes. He didn’t like thinking she was isolating herself in the muggle world. Oh, he knew she was friendly with the people she worked with and that she’d struck up some sort of friendship with a woman at the kebab place around the corner, but he didn’t like thinking he was the only one she could talk to about magic.
‘Draco’s punishment for his crimes during the war was three months in Azkaban, a month on house arrest at Malfoy Manor and a probationary two year period, the first to be spent at Hogwarts getting his NEWTs and proving he was capable of being a productive member of society, the second with weekly Ministry check-ins and “services rendered to the Ministry”,’ Harry said that last bit with all the disdain he could manage.
Harry would have been terrified by how everything went exactly as it had before if not for the fact that he’d been warned it would. He’d been cautioned to let it. Back when they’d first been making the plans, back when the Order thought it would be him and Ginny and knew nothing about Draco.
Fifth year was a strange year. Dichotomous in that he was young and carefree, free to explore his sexuality and the joy of hormones, but he was given power and responsibility in the form of first his prefect duties and then his role in the Inquisitorial Squad. His prefect status acknowledged his hard work and his status within Slytherin and the school long before Umbridge created her squad of students who could properly wield that power and influence in a way being a prefect didn’t allow. She might have made sweeping changes (not all of them good, a lot of Slytherins felt free to admit to that in the safety of the common room) but Umbridge had been exactly what Draco had needed in that moment, an opportunity to show that his father’s teachings had not steered him wrong.
‘I just never even realised this kind of magic existed,’ Hermione went on, ostensibly ignoring Ginny. ‘I just thought it was all fairy tales and people being poetic.’
‘I wanted to hurt Harry because I was hurting,’ he told her, and the words were true even if he sounded as though he were repeating something his mind healer had said.
‘I know I’m not a sadistic psychopath but – I mean – why?’ Harry muttered as he tried another spell with similar results. ‘Oh, shut up, would you?’ Harry grumped at it.
Harry followed him easily into the house, Winthrop and Mendenhall were much slower and a lot more cautious. Both had their wands in hand and shields at the ready. They stepped where Harry or Draco stepped and kept their pace slow and steady to match his. It seemed they were finally learning. Perhaps he could look forward to a future in which they didn’t just let him go about getting himself killed for them. He wondered if this meant that he’d earned their respect. Just because Winthrop had broached the idea of him working for the Ministry didn’t mean she respected him as a wizard or a curse breaker, it just meant she knew how much easier it would be to make use of him if he became compliant.
Amused by the sheer delight on her face and the way Harry couldn’t seem to contain his laugh, Ron replied, flushing slightly, ‘You’re welcome.’
‘I’m honestly beginning to wonder how Arthur has any limbs left,’ Draco admitted. ‘All my mockery over his job when I was a kid seems really pathetic right now when I think about all the junk he had to deal with.’
‘That’s true,’ Harry agreed. ‘You are the only Death Eater free and willing to work with the Ministry.’
‘You’re stupidly pretty,’ Harry corrected, not even caring how goofy and lovesick he sounded. Although, ‘I think I’m really fucking tired, Draco.’
Instead, Harry had spoken for him. Luna had spoken for him. Both of them talking about things that had happened during the year Voldemort occupied his ancestral home. In a way, he’d expected the kind words from Luna. The time she’d spent as a prisoner in the dungeon had forced Draco to make decisions he never thought he’d be able to make. He was a coward, after all. But during Luna’s captivity he’d made decisions that he would have to live with for the rest of his life, some he was sure he’d never be able to reconcile. Draco Malfoy was a coward. He wasn’t a killer. Dumbledore had said as much on the Astronomy Tower.
Their calm interaction stumped Weasley and he stood gaping at his girlfriend, words forgotten. Eventually he managed a garbled, ‘Hermione!’
This Draco could one hundred percent agree with. The circumstances surrounding Sirius Black’s death were tragic but avoidable. It hurt to admit because that gave Harry reason to believe his death was somewhat Harry’s fault, but Draco couldn’t deny the whole thing was handled very, very badly.
As long as he got grandchildren, of course. That part was nonnegotiable. Not that he or Harry minded, there would definitely be children in their future and given how lonely both of them had been as children, certainly more than one.
The Ravenclaw smiled, eyes flashing viciously as he glared up at Draco, still hunched over. ‘They’ll send you back to Azkaban for that,’ he declared, in a pained sputter. ‘Maybe this time they’ll give you a Kiss.’
‘Do I want to know what that was?’ Harry asked, trying to keep his tone conversational when he just wanted to grab Draco and leg it.
This exchange, however, was one too many for Weasley. He stood up suddenly, seized his bag and stormed away from the table. Harry watched him go with a sigh, but Granger was looking at Draco, rather than her angry boyfriend.
His attackers had all been sprawled on the floor incapacitated and it wasn’t what she wanted at all.
Harry came through the door just as Kreacher returned with dinner – the perfect timing of a good house-elf. Draco and Hermione looked up when he came in, but it was Kreacher who commented disapprovingly, ‘Master Harry is in need of a shower.’
Huh. He felt that was something worth mentioning to Draco. He probably could have bought it up right there with Hermione and distracted her from being mad at Ron, but he was enjoying not having to think overly hard about anything and an in-depth conversation about what had turned him so against studying wasn’t anything close to fun. Also, it possibly had something to do with Ron?
Harry, who couldn’t help agreeing, once again pointed out, ‘You know you’re the best choice for this.’
Pansy smiled at him softly. ‘We could take this slow, spend weeks and months dancing around all the shitty things you did, all the ways you hurt me and how we just gave up on you, but that’s not really my style. We’re going to order lunch, we’re going to drink this entire bottle, and we’re going to sit in this shitty booth until we’ve sorted this out.’
That didn’t bother him, he was used to pins and needles and weird sensations. Prolonged exposure to the
‘And hideously complex,’ Hermione added thoughtfully, staring off into the distance as though she were mentally going through a potions textbook, considering all the steps and ingredients involved.
Draco pulled a face. Not at Longbottom or even Harry’s advice but at the mention of the Three Broomsticks. He still owed Madam Rosmerta an apology, one he wasn’t all that confident in giving and one he knew for certain would be poorly received. He’d be steering clear of the Three Broomsticks for the foreseeable future. His plans to meet up with a visiting Pansy were to be at the Hog’s Head. At least he was sure of his welcome there.
This time Draco gave a wry smirk. ‘He did. But it still has to go before the Wizengamot for approval. He thought it best to wait until they’d cleared out all the corruption and assigned the new seats before we had Andromeda present it.’
He frowned at Harry and tilted his head – Harry took that to be about the choice of breakfast location – and Harry shrugged. The wrinkle of Ron’s nose that followed was definitely directed at Harry’s and Draco’s attire (which was directly linked to the eating at the Hufflepuff table, not that Ron needed to know Draco had pushed himself too far on his first run since he’d been injured and so they’d both just dropped down at the nearest table).
‘I thought if I reached out, I could pull on this connection between us,’ Draco explained. ‘I thought I could use some of your power as you suggested after the blood curse, but I think I’m always using your power. I think you’ve been using mine too.’ Draco held up their connected hands and studied them with wonder – if a little alarm.
They’d spoken with the mind healer again, after they’d had a good night’s rest and from all they’d discussed, Draco could agree that Weasley’s walking away had triggered long-held fears of abandonment and loneliness in Harry which had caused the nightmares and brought up all the things about the isolation in his past he hadn’t fully been able to deal with growing up.
He didn’t want Draco waking up with strangers around him. He didn’t want Draco experiencing that moment of fear and panic when he opened his eyes to find people he didn’t trust hovering around him.
He and Harry stepped over the rope but didn’t go much further than that. ‘How do you want to do this?’ Draco asked.
He wished today wasn’t one of the bad days. He wished he could have gone with Draco. Maybe if he’d taken the Ministry’s offer, maybe if he’d stayed away from Hogwarts and instead gone straight to the Aurors, he would be the one escorting Draco on this task. At least then he would be there to help, to step in and help shield Draco when the curses and wards became too much.
He pointed his wand sharply upward to indicate the bloody hand hanging through the hole in the ceiling and then he ignored the new arrivals in favour of making sweeping gestures with his wand, casting hasty (but thorough) checks for spells that might be triggered by any sort of rescue operation.
Still, he didn’t want to talk about Azkaban and so he skipped over it to talk about the month Draco spent on house arrest. ‘It seemed stupid not to keep visiting him, by then,’ he explained with another shrug. ‘He was a mess. I think Luna and I spent most of that first week constantly reminding him to eat. Madam Pomfrey gave Narcissa this huge list of potions he needed to take and devised a rehab routine to help him get back his strength and his health. It seemed a good a way as any to help him get back proper control of his magic by training together, so I taught him everything I was learning from the Aurors.’
Draco moved further down the corridor until he reached the suit of armour. ‘It’s dead,’ he announced, before reaching up and tracing his hands softly down the gauntlet. He felt it, the soft heat that threatened to drive attraction he already felt into overdrive. If he didn’t know what he was looking at, if he hadn’t cast the spells first, he might just have thought he was in the mood for some healthy snogging with Harry now that they were in a quiet corridor and away from prying eyes.
He moved to pull the strap over his head to rest on his right shoulder and across his chest and winced at the way his left shoulder twinged when he moved. After a couple of steps he felt the ache in his right leg. Both were dull aches he could – and would – ignore. He’d certainly had worse over the last couple of years and he refused to be the old Draco, moaning and wailing over an injury long healed.
Pansy, perhaps for the first time ever, offered up a piece of wisdom he could actually respect. ‘You live your life exactly as you want to because you want to. Just because he didn’t belittle your choices and attempt to disown you for daring to be with another man – and Harry Potter to boot – doesn’t mean you have to feel like the choices you make are for him.’
Though that might just have been the junior auror who, when Draco glanced over his shoulder, he could see had gone an interesting shade of green and appeared to be rethinking his career choice.
This time, Draco gave him such a pitying look, one that suggested his fondness somehow encompassed Harry in all his completely stupid glory. For some reason the look made Harry grin goofily which had Draco raising a sharp brow before turning his attention back to Longbottom who seemed to be watching them with poorly disguised longing.
She didn’t know what he’d said or done in those quiet moments in Azkaban, but he’d shared every part of himself with Harry and Harry had done the same and they’d healed their souls together, stitching themselves together with love and hope and acceptance and things she shouldn’t need to know. She shouldn’t need answers to so many of her questions. She wished, like the rest of the Weasleys, like Andromeda and Hagrid, that she could just accept it for what it was.
‘Flitwick is outside,’ Ginny told him. ‘All I need to do is get her out the window and he’ll do the rest.’
Then again, its Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy and just maybe it all started in the summer of ’91 on the 31
Pansy nodded. She looked between them once more and the soft expression she’d held since taking a good look at him, slipped into a devilish smirk. ‘I don’t think fifteen-year-old me, listening to all your Potter fantasies, ever thought we’d wind up here.’
He hastened to explain his question, ‘Draco and I have been talking about how few kids actually get the opportunity to study there and how we could go about fixing that.’
As if she could read his thoughts – and he might be the (somewhat) accomplished legilimens between them but he wouldn’t put it passed Luna to have something like that up her sleeve and just not have thought it worth mentioning – Luna peered down at his leg and hummed happily.
Just as Draco was preparing to stand, spinning around in his crouch to keep his eye on the fight still happening behind him, Winthrop grabbed him and shoved him sideways. He hit the road with a grunt of annoyance, glaring at her as she stood over him. Her stance was protective, shield held firmly in place. He didn’t know why she was protecting him all of a sudden. It wasn’t like he’d needed the help. Or that she’d ever put on such a display of protecting him before.
‘Hey,’ he greeted, throat dry making his voice a croak. He didn’t think he’d been asleep that long. Madam Pomfrey had only stopped working on Draco as dawn broke. The weak sun streaming through clouds wasn’t offering much warmth in the Hospital Wing and it didn’t give him any idea what time it was, but he didn’t think it was early.
He’d heard about these rings, heard the family stories about them and assumed, like everyone else, they’d been lost when the Black family fell apart. They were old magic, very old. The runes etched into the band called on love and magic to allow the pair wearing them to always find a way back to each other. They didn’t work like portkeys, didn’t immediately take you where you needed to be, the magic in them was softer, subtler. Made for remembrance and longing, they used belief and faith and love to gently guide and steer you where you needed to be.
With a deeply put-upon sigh Draco made to detail just why he wasn’t about to give back his wand but Weasley stood up, leaning over the table to glare right in his face. ‘What the fuck, Malfoy? You took his wand?’
Something in his thoughts must have shown on his face because Robards’ scowl deepened. ‘Get out of my office, Potter,’ he commanded. ‘You’re late for your session with Smith.’
‘I don’t think I ever really thought about it that way,’ he murmured. He saw that they were both looking confused and added, ‘No, I know I still see things differently to Ron and sometimes he’ll make a comment about something that seems completely strange to me and Hermione, but I never really thought about the fact that he must think we’re both daft sometimes for not knowing what he’s talking about.’
repercussions) meant that he didn’t just provide his own image to work with but was given smell and taste and feel as well. The wards for him were tangible. In this state, he could reach out and touch them, smooth his hands over the soft curves where they guarded the property. There was no spiderweb for Draco, not this time.
She apparated away with a soft crack before he could say otherwise, leaving him with Ginny. He eyed the youngest Weasley warily and found himself asking, against his better judgement, ‘Are you alright?’
‘They stacked up his case files and reports, gave a detailed description of all the work he’s done when he was supposed to be restricted to Hogwarts and pointed out the good he was
‘Instagram,’ Hermione corrected, a little guiltily. ‘And I know,’ she agreed. ‘It’s ridiculous! What right does he have to be so fit?’
Madam Pomfrey did something that had Draco shouting out in pain before he could lock his reaction down and Luna squeezed his hand in sympathy. ‘Fuck,’ he swore when he managed to unlock his jaw again.
Harry dove back onto the bed and wriggled up under the covers to press icy skin against Draco’s warm side. Draco yelped and tried to shove him away but it was as though Harry had grown extra limbs as he tangled around him and refused to let go.
He’d barely even noticed when they arrived at the little dock. Barely noticed the way his legs shook beneath him or the way he’d brushed off the proffered hand and sympathetic smiles of the guards. He’d just had to get away. He’d apparated without any clear understanding of where he was going – which was terribly dangerous in its own way – but he hadn’t been able to clear that terrifying sickness that had come with the realisation that to Albus Dumbledore, Draco hadn’t meant enough to save him, not until the very end, not until it no longer mattered. He couldn’t shake the disgusting feeling that he’d been just as much a pawn to Dumbledore as Draco had been to Voldemort.
‘Of course, not,’ confirmed Draco. ‘That’s definitely our own magic interacting with the magic in the tattoo.’
Given that Harry didn’t actually expect Ron to do much looking – half the bloody stuff in this vault was probably cursed – he didn’t hold it against his friend. It wasn’t like he’d been dragged along as another set of hands. If Pansy had been the one to come with him as he’d originally planned, she’d definitely have draped herself dramatically across the couch to shout criticisms at him from a safe distance.
Draco unabashedly watched Harry’s jumper rise, revealing smooth tanned skin and then turned to find Longbottom watching him in amusement.
‘Did you know that’s what he was doing?’ Granger demanded. ‘Did you even check the meaning of the runes?’ Her tone told them both how very much she doubted that. As Harry’s friend, she knew for a fact he didn’t know anything about runes.
Harry wouldn’t lie to him. He couldn’t. That didn’t mean he wanted one of the first things he said when Draco finally woke to be that Astoria was coming back.
He looked around at the busy street, searching for some way to ease the mood and his eyes locked on a small narrow shop squeezed between a second-hand bookshop and a milliner’s. He’d never been in there before, but he knew what he’d find when he went in. Perhaps it was time he paid the shop a visit instead of expecting Ezekiel to come to him? He did have some time before he absolutely had to be at the Ministry.
Harry was quiet for a while, staring out the windows as though he could see into the garden. Draco and Luna ate quietly, giving him the time he needed to digest what they’d just said. Eventually though Harry gave voice to what was putting the strained (though thoughtful) look on his face.
At which point Lisa, seeking revenge no doubt for all those sleepless nights, piped up from an armchair to say, ‘Ron hit him first.’
‘Bugger,’ Ron muttered, removing the pouch of wizarding money from his pocket. ‘I don’t have any muggle money.’
Joseph attempted to take Harry off guard by casting without warning. Harry deflected the jinx without effort, and it shot back at Joseph with such force that when it hit the man’s hastily erected shield, his feet slid back across the floor a few feet.
‘Well,’ she laughed. ‘Can’t say I didn’t see that coming.’ She patted him on the shoulder and wandered away.
Harry’s expression hardened and he stepped closer forcing the fourth year boy to hastily take a couple of steps back. All the more humiliating for him, he tripped over the hem of his robes in his haste and had to be righted by one of his friends. Draco skilfully managed not to smirk, continuing to watch the whole exchange impassively as he sipped on his tea and enjoyed his toast.
It seemed Draco wasn’t going to get his wish. Although before he was forced to stand up and intervene someone else did.
Harry may have regrets, he was allowed those, he was allowed to let those regrets shape some of his actions, but he couldn’t let them control him. Draco struggled with that. He struggled with the idea that he was allowed to have regrets and that not all of them were things he had to make up for. Sometimes it seemed as though Draco was getting better, that he was putting some of it behind him, but on the bad days they threatened to consume him.
It all left Hermione feeling as though she was missing something very important. There had to be a reason Luna had forgiven Draco, that Ginny put up with him and professors were worrying over him. There had to be something she didn’t know because she couldn’t think of any other reason people should be worrying over Draco Malfoy. He deserved what he got for all that he’d done.
He would not let that go for Ron Weasley. He was very firm on that. He would not let Draco think for even a second that Harry didn’t see the hard work he’d put into changing himself. He would not let him think for even a heartbeat that he was losing Harry because Draco needed Harry in the same way Harry needed Draco. He wouldn’t destroy that, wouldn’t set that aside for his old friend.
He didn’t envy Winthrop trying to clear it on her own and hoped she’d taken the advice he’d passed on from Draco not to touch anything she wasn’t one hundred percent sure about.
‘I hate him, Hermione.’ He looked at her imploringly, but his voice was calm. He was dropping a simple fact not flaring with rage. ‘I can’t just forget everything he did. He nearly killed me!’
‘Yes, it does!’ she cries, and the part of him that has a death wish very nearly questions if her sudden tears and swing in mood is because of hormones. ‘I can’t – I need this to be now, Harry, I need to…I need to have a plan. I need to be able to – I don’t know, I just need to know. Floo him.’
Draco followed Harry back across the common room but paused with his foot on the first step when Longbottom called out to them.
There was a long silence and Draco dared to turn and look at Harry. Over Harry’s shoulder he could see Mustafa crouched and studying the ground. If he’d turned and glanced quickly around, he might not have noticed the way the curse breaker lifted a hand to scratch at his beard, frown creasing his forehead as he brough his wand down in an arc over something Draco couldn’t see. If he’d simply glance over, he wouldn’t have seen the way Mustafa flickered as though a shadow passed over the sun obscuring him for a moment and then again Mustafa reached up a hand to scratch at his beard and moved his wand down in an arc.
also landed on the table, one knocked his knife to the floor with a clatter, the other only just missing Granger’s glass of juice. Draco watched Harry picking up his letter with an annoyed look as he unrolled his newspaper. He glanced at the front page, only giving the photo on the front of Kingsley in the Ministry’s atrium a brief look before Harry tossed his letter into his lap. Draco placed the paper down and picked up the letter. He only had to glance at the now broken seal before he laughed.
Harry elbowed him sharply and then they both scrambled around a bit trying to find something that resembled clothes. Harry was still hopping about trying to get his joggers over one of Dobby’s hideous socks when Draco went to open the door. He hadn’t bothered to do more than put on pants before he’d wrapped himself in a blanket and made for the door. No need to leave Longbottom lurking out in the hallway raising all sorts of awkward questions it was far too early in the morning to answer.
‘I need you to tell her exactly what I’m saying,’ he instructed Harry, who had a tendency to paraphrase for expediency. He waited for Harry to search his face for understanding, waited until he’d nodded, before he turned to Hermione and said, ‘I don’t mind if you want to hate me.’
Hermione gave him a wry smile but contradicted him when she told him, ‘Harry’s actually rather good at it now. He’s been seeing a mind healer for months. Draco helps too.’ She’d added that last bit out of spite because she was mad that Draco was invading her thoughts and knew that Ron wouldn’t take the mention well.
‘Oh Harry,’ he breathed with such deep affection, when he finally drew his gaze away from the rings to stare at his boyfriend. ‘You great sap.’ His voice was thick with emotion that he did nothing to conceal.
Draco smirked. ‘I’m about to spend the day playing with piles of gold – it’s going to be a lovely day.’
Looking back at it, Harry could laugh. He could find amusement in the way Arthur had dropped a corner of the paper to look at him, eyebrows raised and looking as though he must have misheard. He could see the fun in the way Molly had frozen, half into her chair, with a look of complete astonishment on her face.
She wanted to help build an inclusive and (most importantly) functional wizarding society so that what happened with Voldemort never happened again.
Draco glared at her and she took that as invitation to take the empty seat across from him. She stared back at him until curiosity got the better of him and he picked up the roll of parchment and started on the (extensive) list she’d created.
For Salazar’s sake, even his own pureblood Death Eater father supported his relationship with Harry. Admittedly, he probably thought he could use it to his advantage but when Draco had brought that up with his mother, she’d told him otherwise. She’d gone so far as to assure him that, yes, his father likely hoped to gain something from being Harry Potter’s father-in-law but that was more a delightful by-product rather than his main reason. His father, despite everything he’d done that had made Draco’s life a (quite literal) living hell, loved him and supported his right to be in a relationship with whoever he wanted.
‘Focus!’ he ordered himself. He snapped his wand in a complicated spiral, casting the rough kind of stasis spell hated by proper healers but taught to every auror because it was the one thing that might keep them alive long enough to get proper help.
Having penetrative sex that first time with Draco probably wasn’t really what Ron was angling at either. That had just sort of happened, too. There’d been no planning, no worrying about whether they should or shouldn’t and what it would mean for them. Harry had known he was in love with Draco, had been pretty fucking sure Draco was in love with him, and so they’d been right in the middle of some heavy frotting when Harry had demanded Draco fuck him. It had been hot and, despite the horrendously awkward conversation with Luna that had given him the basics, he’d been nervous and unsure but eager to learn and Draco had taken a lot of delight in teaching Harry just how good sex could be.
Oh, and Ron, of course. He did wonder how she’d gotten rid of Ron, though perhaps she’d just told him she was planning to study in the library, and he wasn’t to disturb her. It wasn’t as though Ron could be expected to know that it was where Harry had taken refuge while Draco ditched him to supervise some sort of Potions tutorial with the first year Slytherins.
And for what? Harry’s own stupidity? Because Harry had thought he could do this on his own? Because he’d gone to a teacher he knew was useless instead of tracking down McGonagall? So many stupid mistakes and it would get him killed, would get all of them killed. Even stupid Malfoy with his sharp pointy face and that stupid snarl because Riddle was Voldemort but Harry wasn’t stupid enough to believe that meant people were safe just because of their blood status and now Harry had failed to save Ginny and he’d likely gotten Malfoy killed, Malfoy who could have been his…Harry didn’t know how to finish that thought because here in this moment he was twelve and he was dying and what did he know about the future and the love and hope and happiness that would come from knowing Draco Malfoy? What did he care to know (what did he care to dream?) about a future he would never –
Ron laughed and Harry turned away from his friend to glare at the air above the goblin leading the way. Harry hadn’t been given the goblin’s name, he’d just been hustled off to the side the moment he’d set foot inside Gringotts, surrounded by angry looking security goblins and then been forced to wait while they ran through exactly what he was and wasn’t allowed to do while in the bank. Again. As though they hadn’t made it clear every other time he’d tried to set foot in Gringotts since they’d lifted his ban – conditionally, of course.
He had to cast a lightening charm before he could ease the large chunk of floor off his legs. Thankfully, it seemed to have been balancing over his leg rather than squishing it into a paste. He was very lucky it had fallen wedged against another piece of floor and not directly on his leg. Wedged as it was it had still torn his leg up enough to have him wincing and glancing away.
.’ Harry made sure to put enough derision on the title to make it clear how much he hated it. ‘He agreed to training throughout the year and we settled on taking the exams right after my NEWTs.’
. What made him all the more newsworthy (apparently) was that so often these days, he was captured beside Harry and the wizarding world didn’t seem to know what to do with that.
Luna had slipped down onto the bench beside her and started up a conversation quickly, introducing herself and explaining she would be happy to talk any time Astoria needed to speak to someone and didn’t want the bother of writing it down.
‘You know how it is,’ he shrugged, mischievous grin making Ron frown warily. ‘Four kids, it’s not exactly easy to get out for a date.’
But that was later when he understood that the world he loved so much and the things he believed so strongly were corrupt and wrong and that everything he thought he knew needed to be twisted and turned until it was shaped completely different. Until he was completely different.
Four months should not have been enough to overcome the years of hate and hurt between them. It shouldn’t have been enough to turn loathing and spiteful words into soft smiles and tender exchanges. Harry should hate him for all he’d done and all he’d put him through. But he didn’t and Draco didn’t hate him either.
‘That glass cut off the tip of an antler,’ Hermione informed him in a probing manner. Apparently questioning Draco’s tattoos was easier than addressing the larger issue of what exactly Harry meant about what he’d been through during the war. They’d need to talk about that though, eventually. Not all of it, not the details, they had no right to those, but there were some things they would need to know if they were to accept Harry’s acceptance of Draco.
Harry pulled one of his hands out from under his pillow and snaked it around Draco’s hips. He slouched down further onto the bed to make it easier for Harry.
‘Magic is always full of surprises,’ Draco reminded Harry. ‘But yes, I think that giving students a place to learn about magic from a young age will mean that muggle raised wizards like you don’t feel like an idiot for not knowing the plant life might eat you.’
‘I don’t want to look up at you,’ she snaps, pointing her finger sharply at the other side of the table.
Draco laughed. ‘Come on, you sap,’ Draco murmured, gathering his book and the boots he’d kicked off and leading the way up to their room.
‘Some of those are more than gentle. Are they on all the portraits?’ Harry frowned down the length of the corridor, gaze following where Draco’s had been just moments before, tracing the path of the portraits along the walls. Each of them was pulsing with a soft pink glow that was indeed, after a second glance, a compulsion charm.
Because that hadn’t created a panic at all. Bloody Pansy. The worst part was he knew she was being truthful. Whatever Draco got him was bound to be amazing and was likely to put every other gift to shame and so Harry was scrambling to put together something that might vaguely measure up. Because they might not be rivals anymore but they hadn’t left their competitive natures behind.
But there were those ifs again. Draco couldn’t change the past. Even if someone handed him the most powerful time turner in existence and offered him the chance to go back and change his own choices, he wouldn’t take those choices back. All the bad things in his past shaped him into the man he’d become. They’d shaped him into the man who could understand Harry, who could understand his dark days and his good ones. Those choices had shown him just how important the decisions he made were.
Draco started to pull his hand from Harry’s, but Harry tightened his grip. ‘Can I have my hand back?’
‘Sorry, Harry,’ Arthur patted his shoulder, sounding not at all sorry. ‘It’s for the best,’ he assured him, before bidding goodbye to Robards and leaving Harry alone with the Head Auror.
‘The only Defence teacher we had with any sort of qualifications was Remus,’ Hermione put in quietly.
Before the war and Smith’s sweeping cleanse, Draco suspected it would have been more a case of incompetence and inadequacy. He felt deeply sorry for the aurors who had escaped Smith’s savage cleansing, they were in for a harsh new reality once Robards managed to implement the new training guidelines in May. Draco entertained himself for a long moment thinking about what would happen if he went to Hermione with his concerns about Magical methods of criminal investigation in a post-war world and then let her loose on Robards and the Ministry.
He would no longer work for the Ministry. He’d drop out of training, stop taking the private lessons and going on raids to sweep up fleeing Death Eaters and the last of Voldemort’s sympathisers. He would turn his back on a Ministry making choices he didn’t like and risking the life of a teenager because they valued Draco less than they did the Mark on his arm. He didn’t know that it would make a difference to the Ministry, but it wasn’t about that. He wouldn’t be able to face Draco if he stood by and continued to work with the people who so easily put his life at risk. He couldn’t work with people who saw nothing wrong with shackling an eighteen-year-old man and dragging him off to Merlin knew where, just so they could force him to break through Death Eater wards and identify curses favoured by Voldemort and his followers.
‘Hi,’ Draco murmured before his eyes rolled back in his head and his entire weight dropped down onto Harry.
This felt like an appropriate place to get in a reminder that he and Harry, despite how they’d started, actually had a very healthy relationship. ‘Probably not, communication is necessary for any healthy relationship.’
Luna, not wanting him to be alone, locked herself away with him. She wandered into his dormitory as though she had every right to be there first thing after breakfast Saturday morning, with an armful of her own textbooks and homework, her bag packed with everything she’d need to lock herself away with him, including a ridiculous Butterbeer necklace and an enormous hippogriff feather she’d brought for Harry’s kneazle kitten, Athena, to play with.
‘Does it still hurt?’ Harry brought Draco’s arm closer and pressed a kiss to the Mark before letting go and allowing Draco to slide it beneath the covers.
It would take some adjusting, learning to share Harry when he’d never had to before. He couldn’t keep Harry from Granger and Weasley and even if he could he didn’t really want to. Keeping Harry from his friends would only drive him away in the end and Draco had no intention of ever letting Harry go.
He might have been dressed warmly, the beanie on his head covered the tip of his scar, and he didn’t need his glasses anymore, but he was still easily recognisable as Harry Potter. While it wasn’t always a comfortable thing, being so easily recognised, the worshipful adoration had died down a bit in the last month or so and people had stopped rushing up to him asking for a handshake or (embarrassingly) his autograph. Draco likely helped with that. People were strangely hesitant to approach him when Draco was around, they’d smile and wave but wandering about with a convicted Death Eater made people second guess their approach. As though Harry was busy working or doing something they didn’t want to interfere with, thanks to the articles in the
‘Fourth year,’ Harry replied, ‘Triwizard Tournament.’ He probably could have left it at that but because he was Harry and Joseph had annoyed him, he added, ‘I taught it to my DA students in Fifth year.’ He motioned vaguely at the rest of the students.
He turned his gaze back out the window and tried not to listen to Ron quickly explaining to Ginny what was going on. He didn’t know how much Ginny knew about his summer, not all the details. She knew he’d been visiting Draco, but he doubted she realised how often he’d been out to Azkaban although he suspected Arthur and Molly had some inkling. They’d all made a point of asking him what he was doing, and he’d been honest with them both when he’d first told them he was trying to understand, trying to be better.
Of course, the beauty of the self-awareness that was the discovery and acceptance of his own sexuality painted a lot of his own interactions with Harry differently. So used to the open way he talked to his housemates – and desperately needing the reassurance of someone listening and talking to him – he’d made an offhand comment once amidst a lot of other remarks about their past and Harry had turned such an interesting shade of red and sputtered all of his words before he’d made a hasty exit from Draco’s cell a full twenty minutes earlier than normal.
He didn’t know how to talk about the truth of Dumbledore’s plans, not the full extent of them. How did he talk about the way his life had been carefully planned out from the very beginning? How did he talk about Dumbledore’s plans without the bitterness he now felt? When he still didn’t know how to properly connect the man he thought he’d known with the cold man who had planned out his own death – and Harry’s too?
She didn’t know how to set their relationship back onto the right path when she wasn’t sure it had been on it in the first place. Had she even been in the right headspace to take their relationship from friendship to romance? Had she let her fear of the war and her feelings of loss about her parents drive her to something she wasn’t ready for? She’d spent
Twenty-eight people seemingly trapped in a seven second time loop while Draco and Harry were just stuck.
Draco didn’t get a chance to answer her because the fourth year seemed to have finally worked up the courage to confront Draco again, as he stomped up to the table, this time accompanied by just three friends, to stand behind Weasley to glare across the table at him.
While Harry would never know how that question had even come about, he’d found himself thinking about Dumbledore’s words at the end of first year and the points he’d awarded Neville for standing up to his friends. He’d found himself admitting he’d not had that courage. Not then, not in the beginning. Not for a lot of things, he was realising. Harry had courage, plenty of it – too much if you asked some – but what he’d never really had was the ability to stand up to Ron and tell him he was wrong, not forcefully, not with any weight.
‘Did you?’ She sounded amused and not nearly as drunk as he did but that was Pansy. She’d always been able to drink them all under the table. She suffered the worst hangovers for it though, so none of them had ever minded.
He’d gone about this whole thing hoping that he could help Harry learn about his family. He’d never imagined he’d be able to give Harry the chance to know his grandfather.
Harry nodded and went back to searching for the book to give Bill. Draco went back to searching through the box and was brought up short when he found the deed to a cottage in Godric’s Hollow. He debated mentioning it but, in the end, he knew Harry would want to know about that too.
Draco saw every side of Harry because Harry found it so easy to share them with him. But being honest with Hermione and Ron, sharing that open and easy honesty, was so much harder than it should be, than he’d even realised it was. There was still that underlying fear that something he said or did could lose him his only friends and now that it had, now that something had made him lose Ron it was startling – and freeing – to realise that it wasn’t the end. That he had other people in his life now that he loved and treasured and who hadn’t left him because of something as simple and complicated as who he loved.
‘That’s when we gave up on you, you know.’ Pansy said it bluntly, as though that would somehow take the edge of hurt off the revelation. Not that it was much of a revelation.
Draco grinned and nudged Harry’s thigh with a knee. ‘Do you think it’ll kill you?’ he asked, gleefully.
But sitting on the freezing cold street in a random muggle village wasn’t really the place for having deep thoughts about all the work Kingsley and the rest had ahead of them. Cleansing the Ministry of corruption was one thing, establishing new laws and regulations to prevent it happening again was another thing entirely and one he suspected would be hit with a lot more resistance than they’d so far received. And there’d been plenty of that. No one was happy to be fired from their position, certainly the members of the Wizengamot hadn’t been impressed to be given the boot. He didn’t imagine any of them would be impressed when they saw where those seats and votes would now be assigned.
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face, shoulders slumping. ‘I can’t do this right now,’ he muttered. ‘There’s no fucking spell.’ He turned to Draco. ‘Let’s go.’
Why she had a muggle pen in her handbag, but no paper or parchment was a strange contradiction he’d not expected from Hermione.
Harry was tempted but he thought he’d look like an idiot, so he settled for burying his nose in the crook of Draco’s neck and breathing him in instead. Draco shivered pleasantly and Harry, who was already plastered to Draco’s back, burrowed a little closer, gloved hands sliding easily into Draco’s pockets as Draco went back to his conversation with the stall owner, his own gloved hands gesticulating enthusiastically as they discussed something Harry didn’t understand.
Harry considered this. He’d never known a piece of Voldemort was inside him. The piece of soul had been with him for as long as he could remember, but now he could feel the absence of it. Like having an aching tooth removed or finally getting pressure put just right on a muscle you hadn’t even realised was tight until the instant you felt relief.
‘Malfoy?’ she was aware how shrill her tone was, how incredulous she sounded but honestly that was just not something she’d been expecting.
has been running on your work with the Ministry.’ He offered them an awkward look of apology as though confessing that his wife once read Skeeter (she’d since been relegated to the
Harry’s stinging hex might have had a bit more power behind it than he’d intended when it slammed into the Ravenclaw’s back, judging by the pained scream he gave as his whole body jerked forward with the impact. Startled, the audience of NEWTs students drew back, some of them reaching for wands (some of them already had wands in hand) as they looked at Draco in alarm.
Bill snorted at the suggestion the Hogwarts dungeons were anything like the tombs he’d frequently explored during his time in Egypt, but he didn’t argue with the task, striding off with Fleur by his side, head bent as the pair worked over a strategy.
He shoved him again when Ron made to push forward and then looked over his should at Harry, his expression more furious than Harry had ever seen it, even when he’d been slaying Nagini.
But Ginny is Ginny and she’s not about to become the damsel in distress (not again at least) and so she rides out her emotional outburst, sucks it back in and says, ‘I’ll sign the divorce papers. Give you the baby but fuck you both. Get out of my house.’
‘Ah, Mister Potter,’ Joseph managed to keep his voice even as he spoke, ‘please see me after class to go over everything you’ve missed.’
It was a perfect example of why Harry went with Draco now when the Ministry called on him. He doubted any of the aurors, even Winthrop (who was properly softening up to Draco now), would have done the same – jumping in to save Draco from the full onslaught of slime while he struggled to stop another curse, as easily as Harry had.
Draco had frowned at her words, but before he could enquire into what in the name of Merlin that was supposed to mean, she went on.
‘No,’ Draco answered softly. He still didn’t understand that either, but he would forever be grateful. ‘She wants to be a healer, but her Potions grade isn’t all that great. I used to help her – before the war. I think…I think she looks at me and tries to see the boy she knew before the war.’ He gave a Harry a wry look. ‘It really was mostly Gryffindors who hated Slytherins. At least at first.’
Draco, forced to stop tracing patterns on Harry’s arm, instead slipped his hand beneath Harry’s t-shirt to trace them on his stomach. He moved his head so that it nestled into the crook of Harry’s neck and got to enjoy it for only a moment before he felt Athena shift behind him, claiming the tiny bit of space he’d freed.
Harry’s blood protection leftover from his mother’s sacrifice might have been something else they had to conceal but after talking it through with Harry, Draco wasn’t sure it had ever existed outside of that first encounter with a possessed Quirrell. Dumbledore’s insistence that Lily Potter’s sacrifice was tied to her blood didn’t really hold with the fact that the moment Harry left the Dursley’s, that first September, he’d stopped considering Privet Drive home. Petunia Dursley had never sheltered Harry with love, she’d never given Harry a safe and nurturing home. Why shouldn’t Harry have turned that feeling on Hogwarts itself and then later on the Burrow where the Weasley’s cared for and loved him as one of their own?
Luna and Draco shared a look, a silent battle over who would step in if Harry’s temper got the better of him. Draco lost. Luna’s pointed look very clearly stated that he was Draco’s problem. He dearly hoped he wouldn’t have to intervene; it was a lot more fun watching Harry tear people to shreds on his behalf.
‘Longbottom,’ Draco greeted softly (civilly) in return. Up close, Draco could see a shadow in the man’s eyes. ‘Couldn’t sleep?’
‘Absolutely not,’ Draco replied with a wrinkle of his nose. That would be like dating a sister, which explained the horror in Harry’s expression, he too would see dating Luna the same way.
‘I assured him he would be safe here,’ she’d snapped at Madam Pomfrey as she’d ushered them out of the Hospital Wing and Hermione hadn’t missed the fury in Madam Pomfrey’s eyes either.
He gave Ginny a look, but she merely smiled winningly and said, ‘You owe us for scaring us yesterday.’
This amused Harry terribly and he wondered rather, idly, how long Ron would ignore the obvious truth of his relationship with Draco if no one actually said the words.
‘It isn’t that we heard it,’ he tried to explain, despite having no inclination to do so. ‘It wasn’t sound so much as it was a feeling I interpreted as sound.’
Hermione didn’t seem convinced, but she didn’t say anything more on the subject and Draco was happy to let it drop. ‘I’ll start on a list of muggle subjects I remember if you want to go through the OWL and NEWT catalogues,’ she suggested.
‘Not one that made the paper, no,’ Ginny smirked. ‘Dean’s been seeing one of the photographers at the
‘I knew you were friends,’ she told them, which was obvious, Harry had point blank told her that. ‘And I suspected Draco wanted more but – oh Harry, you really are hopeless when it comes to this sort of thing, I honestly didn’t think you’d even noticed.’
He and Harry kissed both women on their cheeks in greeting before Harry flopped onto the floor to play with Teddy and Draco slid down beside the two, though he chose to reach for the tea laid out on the low coffee table rather than roll about on the floor. It seemed breakfast would be informal this year and Draco was thrilled not to bother with proper clothes so early in the day.
He still had the scars across his chest to remember that lovely little moment. They were a part of him now, a reminder of what war could do and all that he’d survived. Harry hated them, hated that he’d left such a permanent mark on Draco when he’d never even known what the spell did. Draco had forgiven him long before they’d even become friends, but he wasn’t sure Harry would ever forgive himself, not truly.
Ginny shrugged. ‘You didn’t want to talk about it and I certainly wasn’t going to bring it up. I just assumed you’d talk when you were ready. Or maybe get over it.’
‘He stalked you for an entire year and then almost killed you,’ she’d pointed out as though he needed the reminder.
‘Oh, shut up,’ Harry snapped lightly. ‘Once we put Sesha’s tail out and rescued the pygmy puffs we had to go and put the house out.’ Harry was starting to sound less annoyed the more he talked and more amused.
‘I was under the impression you have most of your capital tied up in Burbage Hall,’ McGonagall responded, a little warily as though she wasn’t sure she wanted to know but her conscious said she had to ask.
‘There’ll be another meeting with the rest of the teachers, and I think we should include the students, but what it comes down to is that McGonagall would like to be able to offer all magical children the opportunity to learn here and that somehow we’ve got to make it a viable option.’
They called Kreacher to come and get the cabinet and after ordering him to take the cabinet out into the Forbidden Forest and release the boggart, they turned their attention to the next classroom. And the one after that, and the one after that. Hours and hours of tedious combing through classrooms and corridors, alcoves, and hidden rooms. They passed Hermione and Weasley at one point who were climbing a rarely used spiral staircase painstakingly sweeping every stone step for spells and jinxes and frequently came across the house elf who was restoring the castle’s connection to the armour, statues and portraits they’d already cleared of spells.
At first there was nothing. Draco’s steady breathing beside him, the thump of his heart in his ears and the chill of the steady wind. Slowly though, he began to realise it wasn’t the wind he was hearing. There was a slow and steady hissing coming from the ward and if he listened just right, if he relaxed his mind and tried not to focus on it, then he could almost make out words.
Harry didn’t bother to fold his robes, tossing them aside until he was left wearing the same blue jeans and grey t-shirt Draco had watched him pull on just an hour before. Draco scrunched up his nose at the trainers on Harry’s feet but made no comment about his treatment of his robes. He too had a leather wand holster strapped to his right forearm. Stripping off his robes also revealed the large grim tattooed on his left forearm, Harry’s own tribute to someone who meant a great deal to him – Sirius Black.
‘Fuck,’ he hissed. He searched around for some way to get out of the classroom, some way to help the other students and came up with the only response he could. He leant out over the gaping hole as far as he dared, one hand gripping tight to the jagged edge of the wall and peered up, trying to get a better angle as he cast another diagnostic spell.
‘You’re good for him,’ she told Draco. ‘I’m sorry I didn’t see it before, but I just thought he was repressing all of his feelings and pretending they didn’t exist.’ She frowned at Harry. ‘And I thought this was some weird saviour thing.’
‘Did they really?’ Hermione was just as surprised as Ron but whereas Ron looked like this was a bloody stupid idea, Hermione looked thoughtful.
But Harry wasn’t quite ready to leave yet. ‘I’ll be going with him any time he goes out,’ he informed Robards. ‘You do still want the man who killed Voldemort working
‘You were the first wizard my age I’d met, the first properly magical person. We could have spent the whole day with you showing me Diagon Alley.’
Strange to think there was no Harry without Draco. Strange to feel as though part of him had been ripped away and that he would never be whole again. Strange to think that this perfect broken boy had been Harry’s reason for everything, that he –
As soon as they were out of the room, the door closed behind them, Harry shoved him up against the wall and snogged him breathless, forcing a knee between Draco’s legs that he couldn’t help but ride until he was hot and shivery and looked exactly like he’d just been shoved against a wall and thoroughly snogged.
‘Bloody hell, I’m in the kitchen,’ the other voice called back with exasperation. This voice sounded familiar too, but Hermione couldn’t place it.
Although, not having it out could lead to Draco not having to share Harry with his friends and that was hardly an unpleasant concept. He really had liked having Harry mostly to himself over the summer. Luna was easy to share him with, she seemed to understand Draco was selfish and possessive and never got in the way. Given Harry could be just as possessive and selfish in return she’d gotten very good at working with the both of them and letting them be just as possessive as needed.
Harry raised his hands in defence. ‘Hey,’ he said softly, ‘I’m agreeing with Draco here. Hannah’s great.’
Smothered in a tight motherly embrace, he’d only been able to squint at Arthur over her shoulder, his nose squished into the knot of her apron string. Arthur had still looked a bit stunned, but he’d managed to pull it together long enough to offer Harry a soft smile.
Harry grinned. Then he sobered, looking darkly down the corridor at the alcove just beyond the suit of armour. ‘Proper sex ed.’
‘What, all of it?’ Ron had a look of complete bewilderment on his face as though he’d never heard anything stranger.
When his feet next landed on solid ground he opened his eyes and found himself looking up at the burned-out shell of a seaside cottage. The image was blurred around the edges and he blinked his eyes a few times before his magic worked through the wards around the cottage and showed him that far from being a burned out shell, the cottage was well maintained, with a flourishing garden and gleaming windows that must have been spelled to protect them from the sea spray.
‘The vine didn’t kill her,’ Mustafa grunted, eying the ground around Marigold cautiously. ‘It just ate her.’
The old Draco would have been crying hysterically over something a lot smaller. The old Draco hadn’t spent three months in Azkaban after living with the Dark Lord for over a year. Honestly what was a little flesh shredding and a stabbing compared to a prolonged
Robards regarded him in silence for a moment, taking in the sweaty hair, ratty trainers, the joggers and t-shirt and grunted. ‘Malfoy tricked you then.’
‘You will, you know,’ Ron assured her. ‘You’re going to do amazing things. Make the world a better place.’
Mustafa stood from his crouch as the owl faded away and, in the distance, sparks shot high into the air, a beacon for them to follow. ‘How do you want to do this?’ Mustafa asked Mendenhall.
Ginny shrugged. ‘He said he didn’t want them falling into the wrong hands. He’s been passing them all along to George so that the
Draco didn’t know what to think. He and Astoria had never talked much before, she was two years below him and as such he knew her as well as he knew every other pureblood family. There’d been no reason for her to seek him out, no reason for her to smile at him when she caught him looking at her over breakfast.
‘Get over it?’ Harry repeated amused. The idea that he could ever get over Draco Malfoy seemed laughable. What of his life in the last eight years that hadn’t revolved around Voldemort, revolved around Draco. If he hadn’t gotten over it yet, he didn’t see that adding sex to the equation was going to help any.
But four months had turned out to be a lot longer than he’d anticipated, than Hermione and Ron had too, and, in the aftermath of the war, Harry hadn’t realised how much he needed – how much he wanted – to change. To grow and find himself now that he wasn’t being hunted by a madman. Now that he didn’t have a dirty tainted piece of a soul shoved inside of him.
‘Morning,’ Harry replied. The bite of toast he took was rather pointed but Draco wasn’t sure Weasley noticed. He knew there was no way Granger missed it. Harry seemed determined not to make a thing of his sitting at the Slytherin table and Draco was perfectly content to let him.
‘Thanks, Hermione.’ Harry hesitated and then he rushed on to say, ‘You know I’m happy for you and Ron, too, yeah?’
‘Mister Carrel, I suggest you return to the Hufflepuff table immediately,’ McGonagall ordered. ‘You can retrieve your wand from me after you serve your detention. Perhaps by then you will have learned not to curse your fellow students.’
Harry was still thinking about it when they arrived home and he stopped in the sitting room to speak with Narcissa about her own education – being a Black he wondered if she’d had tutors and extra studies outside of Hogwarts. She had, which was something to think about, she’d spent summers between her years at Hogwarts learning the things that Hogwarts didn’t offer that any person wishing to be successful would need – like basic mathematics.
She’d let it be another chink in the wall of her hatred for him, let it be another sign of how he was trying to change and just why he’d been able to build such a strong bond with Harry.
Harry was already moving, sprinting across the common room, arriving beside Draco at the same time as Hermione even though she’d been much closer.
I would love to hear your thoughts on this chapter, especially on Harry's own interpretation of his past and growth.
‘Over the summer of course,’ Luna answered, her gaze was all for the Hogwarts grounds, much as Harry’s had been earlier. He wondered if she saw the same things he did when he looked down or if she was thinking about things so confusing Harry didn’t stand a chance of following her train of thought.
Clearly, one of the reporters had arrived on scene earlier than the aurors had realised. The picture had perfectly captured the moment Harry had teasingly joked about it being kinky. They’d gotten Draco’s smirk clearly despite the grip he had on his wand with his teeth. They’d captured the wink too.
Surprised by the question, the man still answered. ‘They’re not down for Hogwarts, we plan to teach them at home.’
His father had sighed and, if Draco hadn’t known his father so well, he would never have seen the frayed edges to his aggrieved expression. He would never have noticed the tired and broken pieces his father was desperately trying to hide behind his pride and a decent Malfoy mask. He would never have noticed the cracks in his mind growing wider than they’d been when he’d first returned from Azkaban.
‘She’d give it to you.’ Harry had no doubt about that. She’d have shown it to Harry already if she didn’t think the moments surrounding it would hurt him more.
‘When did you see them duel?’ Ron asked, looking a bit confused by the sudden change in conversation and not having any idea, judging by the frown, what one had to do with the other, let alone a conversation Ginny had with Molly.
Thankfully, before either of them did something they’d rather not do in public (Draco felt like his list of these things was ever shrinking, especially when Harry was looking at him like that), Longbottom broke the silence.
‘I think she’s trying to learn from her mistakes,’ Bill had said, eyes locked on where Draco had been struggling to break through a ward he’d set around an ordinary chair. They were working together in the classroom McGonagall had set aside for their use.
Perhaps Hermione was right to hate him. Perhaps she was right to doubt him if he could stand there in a field of torture and cruelty and see a similar path he might have taken if things had turned out differently.
Draco nodded smugly but he was being perfectly honest when he said, ‘You should talk to Madam Pomfrey. She gave me a lot of exercises to do after Azkaban – and some back in third year – to strengthen certain muscles that’ll help you with your game.’
. Draco’s old prefect was doing a remarkable job of painting them as a dark magic fighting team and Harry was not above dragging Draco places just to take advantage of the way he kept
Harry kept his eyes down, traced the teeth marks on one hand with the fingers of the other and thought about all the things he hadn’t said to Ron in the last eight months. All the things he’d meant to say and just hadn’t. All the words he’d put off because it wasn’t the right time, or he wasn’t sure his friend was ready to hear it.
‘I’d have married a lovely pureblood girl who’d provide me with the son my father wants,’ Draco played along.
And that was perfectly fine, he knew that. But Hermione didn’t. She didn’t understand how in just four months Harry had changed so much that he was a completely different boy than she’d left behind.
‘Who took him?’ Luna asked, easing onto the window seat beside Harry and crossing her legs until she was sitting with one knee against the glass, her back against the wall.
‘I do think Ginny and Charlie are right. I don’t think it’s about me shagging a bloke so much as it is that he hates Draco and that was the best way he could think to hurt me. Because he has a lot of other issues he needs to work through that don’t really have anything to do with me and that I’m sure are the reason he always does this. I can live with that – I expected some of that. Just because I need more time to forgive him – just because I don’t know that I want to ever forgive him – doesn’t mean you have to wait on me. I don’t want you to choose our friendship over Ron’s not unless its what’s best for you.’
Ron and Hermione stopped their retreat to look worriedly after her. Ginny stood quickly, freeing her chair for Luna but Luna waved her away and climbed onto the bed settling by Draco’s feet. As they watched, she kicked off her shoes and brought her feet up to tuck beneath her. She had her wand in hand, twirled it in steady patterns as she studied Draco. She was looking at him with a frown as though trying to puzzle something out.
He didn’t not like it when Harry snapped his name like that. Although, he preferred it when Harry would snap “Malfoy” like when they were younger and still thought they hated each other. It sent a pleasant shiver down his spine that was wholly inappropriate because he’d been a horrible human being and Harry had no reason to find that version of him in any way attractive or nice to be around.
There’d been so many people clambering for his attention and so much homework to catch up on having missed almost two full weeks, that he’d managed to go two whole days without having to have
What it boiled down to, though, was that she worked him hard, taught him a lot and that by the time he’d stepped through the floo back into McGonagall’s empty office, made for his (Draco’s) room, tripped over Draco’s bloody kneazle, showered, dressed and made for Potions at a dead run, he was too tired to even attempt to keep his temper (which it turned out Smith had not as thoroughly tempered as he’d thought) in check when he arrived in the dungeons to find Draco being verbally abused by a seventh year Ravenclaw while everyone else (even Ron and Hermione) stood watching without trying to step in.
There was a moment, frozen in time where Harry and Draco could see the future stretching out before them perfectly. All the horror and the fear, the chaos and the death. Everything that had been and could be again if they didn’t play this right.
They’d never found the time and Harry has stopped wanting to. He hasn’t stopped to think maybe Ginny was still waiting.
When Draco had set out to reclaim some of Harry’s past for him, he’d had no idea what he would find. He’d gotten on Pansy’s last nerve dragging her through every bit of parchment he could find in their vaults and he’d even dragged her to the ruins of the house in Godric’s Hollow. He’d expected to put together a family tree, small anecdotes taken from history books or older witches and wizards who had known the Potters. He’d expected to find paperwork about their arrival in Britain, intermarrying with the Peverell family and all about the tradition of wayward hair and the creation of the best-selling hair potion on the market.
Slick blood was sliding down the side of his face and he just knew he was going to have one hell of a headache in the morning, but he couldn’t worry about that now. Not when there were other – younger – students crying out in pain and fear. Both of his arms seemed unharmed, for which he was grateful, and it didn’t seem like he was stuck under anything too heavy or damaging. It was easy enough to shove the lighter debris clear so that he could sit up and flick his wand free of its holster.
The tired croak was the most beautiful sound Harry had heard. He lifted his head and as his eyes met Draco’s he felt the worry ease away. He’d known, of course, that Draco would be fine, but finally seeing his grey eyes made it real.
Harry did most of the work, which was fine, Draco had done most of the spell work while they’d been out with the Ministry. By the time Harry had him dry and into some clean pyjamas, he was struggling to keep his eyes open. Harry gently eased him into bed, towel still around his own hips and water dripping from his hair down his back.
About the only consolation Harry had, was that Draco was at least with two aurors who took their job seriously and didn’t actively wish Draco harm. There’d been too much of that on the last one of these little tasks the Ministry had taken Draco on.
‘Just this one,’ he told her, after checking over the list twice. ‘I’ve read all the rest.’ No need to explain he’d read most of them long before he’d needed answers to this particular bond. He spun the parchment around and pointed to a text two thirds of the way down the list. ‘I don’t even know what this says. Is it Gobbledegook?’
If he got to her in time, she might live, if not, there would be one less witch tormenting muggles in the world.
Draco placed a hand on Harry’s elbow and murmured a soft litany of calming words in his ear which did nothing to improve the suspicions of the class but at least served to calm Harry enough to get a lid on all that power leaking out of him.
Harry had spent hours on what should have been his day off, working to interview muggles, taking their statements before sending them on to the obliviators. He’d done a few rounds of knocking on doors and checking the closed-up businesses for people hiding from it all. Every muggle found needed to be interviewed and sent on to obliviators who erased any memory of the terrifying end their nice little Christmas festival had met. They’d no doubt replaced it with a warm fuzzy feeling and the implication the day had bled into night and it had all been a wonderful time.
Luna and Draco followed a moment later (Draco also with a soft pop, though Luna managed near silence), arriving in a surprisingly clean ally down the street from the takeaway Pansy had recommended. He debated for a moment going and seeing if she was home and wanted to join them but then he remembered she was working and wouldn’t be home until late. He’d make it up to her later.
George, later that night, had cackled, ‘Well, we had been wondering – you do love those dragons an awful lot, brother.’
The guilt Harry felt welled inside him. What if he’d opened the parcel? What if he’d just talked to Sirius and given him that connection, that reason to keep fighting off the sadness and depression? What if he’d –
Yeah, this was a conversation better suited to Draco or even Narcissa and certainly not one he wanted to have with either of his friends then and there.
Luna looked at him calmly before her eyes travelled down to rove over his chest and down his legs before coming back up to meet his eyes with a satisfied smile. ‘You’ve healed.’
‘And you know what you’re doing.’ It was a statement, not a question but Draco couldn’t treat it as such. Not if he wanted to end this nonsense of Granger dogging Harry’s every move and constantly second guessing his choices. Not if he finally wanted to be done fending off her lectures about redemption and how escaping his past as a Death Eater meant he really shouldn’t be using Dark magic.
Again, his words are harsh but they’re not untrue and he sees it, sees the way the anger in her eyes fades – just a little. Its’s still there and it’s going to be for a while, he knows that, but he thinks he sees a little hint of understanding, thinks that maybe, when she’d been sitting alone at the table thinking about a baby she wasn’t ready for, that there was a different path she saw for her life and it wasn’t staying at home and being the perfect little wife to Harry Potter.
Hermione seemed surprised by the questions and she frowned thoughtfully before slowly admitting, ‘No, I – we – just thought you were fixating because he was there.’
And so he’d sat beside Draco, talked with him, laughed with him and it had been just as easy as it had been in those later summer months once they’d gotten to know each other, once Harry’s temper stopped getting the better of him (mostly) and once Draco had been stripped of the pureblood rhetoric that made him such a git. Although, honestly, he was still a bit of a git.
‘Pomfrey is regrowing his lung,’ Harry answered, walking right by his horrified friends to take the chair Luna had left empty. He kept his eyes on Draco, watching the stuttering rise and fall of his chest as Pomfrey’s spells and Draco’s own magic worked tirelessly to repair the damage. ‘She thinks he managed to slow the spread of the curse and that’s why it only took one of his lungs.’
But that was another of those conversations they’d had in the quiet moments in his Azkaban cell and Draco didn’t want to bring it up again. ‘I think you’d have been sorry you made so many wrong assumptions but I’d have hated the pity.’
‘How is he?’ Ron asked. It looked like the question cost him. Ron didn’t want to care; he didn’t want to feel for Draco but for the second time in less than a month he was looking at Draco in the Hospital Wing cursed and broken, and Harry could see it wasn’t sitting well with him. He could see how much Ron wanted to hate Draco, to lash out and be uncaring but he could also see that Ron believed his words from the day before, that he truly believed that what the Ministry was doing was wrong.
‘She asked me to go with her to Hogsmeade,’ Neville admitted with a blush when he realised both Draco and Harry were looking at him again.
But he wasn’t going to think about that, all it did was make him mad at Draco, mad at the Ministry, and the tiny first year did not need to be even more twitchy than she was. Struggling with an obvious bout of nerves, eyes darting from Draco to Harry and over to Hermione and Ron before they slipped once more back to Draco, it was a moment before she managed to speak again.
Draco nodded, expression not changing even if he was feeling a little alarmed at the idea that they only had eight months to put together some sort of plan. At least with Burbage Hall he had a full year on top of that to sort out the finer details. There were a lot of things he’d need to look into, a lot of things he knew Hermione would want to research, and he thought he might want to draw Andromeda and his mother in for help, he imagined a lot of what they were doing for Burbage Hall could be applied to Hogwarts as well.
He pushed up onto his elbows and eyed the two at the end of his bed suspiciously. Hermione was sitting cross-legged at the foot of his bed, nose buried in a book while Ginny was building a house out of exploding snap cards. How long had they been there? He didn’t usually sleep so deeply that he’d have missed the warm comforting presence of his boyfriend being replaced by his best friend and ex.
Harry felt like a bit of a dick and he seriously wished he’d bought Pansy along. She wouldn’t have batted an eye at all the talk of money and fancy heirlooms. She might have tried to take a few, citing he still owed her a Christmas gift – he didn’t. He and Draco were going about Christmas in the manner of most established couples and were buying gifts together – and Draco had had Pansy’s gift ordered before November was even half done.
Harry might not have had any idea what the two of them were talking about, but it didn’t matter, what mattered to him was that he and Draco were out exploring something new and that they were together. They could have been back at the Manor tearing down walls like they’d been doing yesterday, making room for a new series of classrooms. Or they could have been painting walls as Narcissa had been doing with Andromeda, trying to brighten rooms and make them warm welcoming colours. They could have been back in the tiny cottage in the woods that had belonged to one of the Death Eater’s they’d captured on Christmas Day battling their way through her protective hexes, and as long as they were together Harry would have been happy.
This was going to take a lot of research and for just a moment Draco wished he was still the self-absorbed arrogant and entitled prick who didn’t much care about anything that didn’t directly affect him. Life was much simpler. For the three years he’d lived that way. The war had truly been eye opening and dear Merlin, he’d been such a snotty brat. But caring about things had brought him Harry and Luna and allowed him the chance to get to know Aunt Andromeda and Teddy and if that meant he lost another hour of sleep a night until this was done then that was a price Draco was willing to pay.
‘Hermione might know something about the Mark,’ Harry murmured, sleepily. ‘She used a similar charm on those coins we had for the DA.’
They’d filled the rest of dinner with neutral topics, homework and classes and what they planned when school was finished. Ron still had plans to be an auror, he seemed more confident in that now, confident in the idea that he would be training alone.
‘No,’ Draco said, ‘McGonagall.’ He considered Harry’s question. ‘I love Luna, obviously. What’s not to love?’ He considered that. ‘Honestly, don’t have any idea what I did to deserve her but I’m not about to let her go.’
Hermione and Weasley both flinch at that, it being news to them. Harry didn’t look surprised at all which was all the confirmation Draco needed that he was right about the type of curse he’d been looking at.
‘I thought it would take you at least another year to work through all this childish tugging of pigtails with Potter. Now I owe your mother a villa in Tuscany.’
‘Please don’t tell me it was a person,’ Harry’s voice was just as soft despite the disgust in his tone.
Draco knew everything about Harry, what he didn’t know from observing him at school, he knew from their talks in his cell. He knew Harry inside and out and Harry knew him too. He knew exactly what had driven Draco to take the Mark, knew exactly when his thoughts on blood status had changed.
Draco would have supported Harry no matter what he’d chosen to do but he couldn’t deny he’d been happy when Harry ultimately decided he wanted one more year, one chance to have a normal year as an ordinary student at Hogwarts. He and Luna had both laughed at that, but they’d promised to help Harry have as normal a year as possible.
‘Aurors,’ Harry said the word aloud. ‘Aurors,’ he repeated and this time the word was sharp on his tongue, bitten off with the swelling of a deep rage within him.
Draco shrugged but he smiled at Harry’s words. ‘I’m not having a moment,’ he assured Harry. ‘Sometimes it just strikes me that I’m really fucking lucky to have Luna – and you – in my life.’
His words were misinterpreted by everyone but Draco and Hermione. Hermione’s eyes widened as she realised he’d been the one to curse the Ravenclaw’s back, Draco’s impassive expression had morphed into a smirk, as though he was going to enjoy what was about to happen.
‘I don’t understand how you “couldn’t let him go”,’ her voice was soft, curious, she wasn’t pleading with him now, she just wanted to understand, and it softened his annoyance with her some.
Hermione turned pink at the compliment but said with a shake of her head, ‘I’m surprised she didn’t suggest Harry. Your Transfiguration skills are quite good and it would look good if you were the one helping the Slytherins.’ She looked at them, thoughtfully. ‘It would be a good opportunity to strengthen interhouse unity and stop some of the behaviour directed at the Slytherins. That girl wasn’t even here last year, she didn’t even know magic existed, she shouldn’t be punished for prejudices coming out of the war – she’s muggleborn, for heaven’s sake.’
Mustafa gave him another nod and turned his attention to McGonagall as she began to speak. Draco glanced at Bill and Fleur and was amused when they both winked at him. He rolled his eyes, but he knew his lips had curved into a smirk when he glanced back toward the Slytherin table to find Harry grinning at him with a stupidly proud look on his face. Luna was pressed against his side giving Draco a look that suggested pride, fondness and oddly enough (though it was Luna) a sense of exasperation that it had taken people so long to see Draco’s worth.
Draco shook his head, pointed to Harry. ‘Mad man after him.’ Pointed to Hermione. ‘Actually mature and dedicated to your studies.’
‘Almost anyone would have helped him if he’d said something,’ Draco said, with all the embarrassment that would have caused Harry, he didn’t think it was a lie. Assuming Dumbledore let them, of course, but that was something else entirely and he wasn’t about to bring that up with Hermione just yet, that was something Harry would have to bring up when he was ready to finally talk about Dumbledore grooming him to die.
‘She’s weirdly likeable,’ Harry replied before the whole conversation caught up with him and he turned to Ron with a confused, ‘Wait, what?’ and promptly had his hand swallowed buy a teapot that had grown fangs and a sandpapery tongue when he took his attention off it.
‘Seriously?’ Harry looked between Draco and Hermione and both nodded. ‘What an idiot. I mean, I’m assuming you did upset her, but I expected that given what you had to tell her. Did he even give you a chance to explain?’
Draco couldn’t help wondering if she wasn’t trying to tell herself that. If she wasn’t trying to remind herself that Harry had to make his own choices. ‘It matters because I’m not Ginny,’ Draco replied, warily, not touching on his other thoughts. ‘I don’t fit his little vision of what the Chosen One should want.’
It was in the quiet moments when Draco knew he and Harry had a future. They might not talk about marriage and kids, not exactly, but the times they’d skirted around the idea of their future it had been unspoken between them. Draco wanted the husband and the kids. He might not have brought it up since he and Harry started dating but he knew he’d brought it up before, back in Azkaban during one of his bad days when all he could think about was how he wouldn’t survive. He could remember huddling in the corner of his cell, on the bed for once and not the floor, seeking warmth from Harry’s touch even if at the time they were still pretending those moments cuddled together meant nothing.
There were about a million different ways Harry had pictured the confrontation with Ron happening. Strangely enough, he’d never once considered that it might happen while he and Draco were covered in thick brown sludge and in desperate need of a shower. He wasn’t in the mood to talk, Draco wasn’t in the mood to entertain his least favourite Weasley, and honestly, all they wanted was a nice long hot shower and a warm bed.
There was only one person that stag could possibly represent, and it sent her mind spinning. It sent Ron’s spinning too and neither of them had an explanation for what they’d seen and McGonagall’s fury as she asked them for details in her office had been another startling discovery because the headmistress was
Hermione, as he’d suspected she would, found his bond with Harry fascinating. Draco, as expected, found her enthusiasm irritating. But he’d found McGonagall’s astonished look amusing and Bill’s gobsmacked expression somewhat delightful. Madam Pomfrey had only sighed after he and Harry had explained it all and promptly run a series of diagnostics on his and Harry’s magic while Bill and Hermione were still firing questions at them. The fact Madam Pomfrey could find nothing wrong with either of them and no real evidence of such a bond had only spurned Hermione’s fascination and had Bill calling on Fleur because he thought her understanding of blood magic might help.
When the bell rang and they’d put away the last of their things and collected up their bags, Harry twisted on his chair until his knees pressed against Draco’s thigh and rested his elbow on the work bench, his other hand reaching up to cover a sudden yawn as he stared at Draco.
‘I wouldn’t try to get closer and I wouldn’t move anything,’ Draco advised and was it just him or had his voice sounded a little rough? He coughed suddenly and felt the (by now) familiar feeling of blood filling his mouth. He wanted to roll his eyes. He couldn’t even feel what was causing that and that should have been alarming.
But he never would. There was no life in those eyes and the blood that flowed over Harry’s hands had slowed until it was spilling from an empty shell that was no longer Draco and all Harry could do was gather him close and rock back and forth keening over the loss of his greatest love if only there’d been time because this wasn’t how it was supposed to go. It wasn’t. It –
‘Speak for yourself,’ Ginny grumbled. ‘I’m flat broke but you owe me for putting up with my brother after you apparated out of the kitchen with Harry yesterday.’
She was even more terrifying than Mad-Eye Moody (whom she’d helped train) had ever been and consensus in the DMLE was that a great many people had only survived the war because of her. She reminded Harry a lot of Neville’s grandmother (a close friend, he’d been unsurprised to learn), though he wasn’t sure if that was a good thing.
‘Does thinking it would hurt more make it easier to accept?’ Draco questioned. One of his hands was under his pillow but the other was resting on the mattress between them. Draco reached out with that hand to trail soft patterns on the bare skin of Harry’s arm.
The words hit Harry hard. They were all wrong because the Ron he knew, the one who had been his friend for seven years would never say something like that. He would never use words or language like that and even if he didn’t like Harry’s choice in partner, he would never be so vicious and cruel.
So they’d made the move. There’d been shouts and fights and all sorts of tantrums about leaving friends behind and Nan and Pop, too but there’d been excitement as well. She and Ron had told the kids so many stories growing up and probably made Hogwarts out to be more of an adventure than it really was, but she still wanted that for her children.
‘We just want you to be happy, dear, and if that happiness is another boy, we’re going to support you just the same.’
Draco understood how that could drive Harry to keep coming back, it was exactly the kind of thing one would expect from a brave and loyal Gryffindor. Not that Draco had ever expected that loyalty and bravery to be directed at him. At the time he’d been convinced it had nothing to do with him, brushed it off as Harry’s Gryffindor inability to let someone be treated unfairly. If not that, then certainly the debt incurred when his mother lied to Voldemort in the forest and saved Harry’s life was surely reason enough. They’d exchanged so many sharp words and insults in that holding cell that when Draco found himself chained to a chair in front of the Wizengamot he’d been fully prepared to face a lifetime in Azkaban.
And then he’d laughed and joked with Malfoy with an ease that twisted something up inside Hermione. The way he smiled so easily at Malfoy, as though there was no bad history between them, as though they hadn’t been on different sides in the war made her sick.
Athena landed on the bed with a hefty thump, stalking up the bed until she could drape herself across them both. Harry ended up with a mouthful of fur and Draco fell asleep with an amused grin and laughter on his lips.
Draco didn’t even care that when he returned to his desk, Harry was turned around talking earnestly to Granger and Weasley because it gave him the chance to start the base of their potion simmering in his cauldron without Harry trying (and failing) to help. Once that was done, he held out a piece of willow bark to Harry without looking up and demanded he shred it.
He’d almost finished his little speech, only had the last bit about assignments to go, when his eyes skimmed over a head of dark messy hair. He clocked the hair as belonging to the auror he’d seen shirtless putting some recruits through their paces, and his eyes moved on.
At least he’d thought there’d been Ron and Hermione. Two months without a single word. Two months. Maybe he didn’t mean anything to them. Maybe they’d only hung around because he was Harry Potter – the Boy Who Loved – and not because he was someone worth knowing. It wasn’t as though he’d had friends before. Before Hogwarts he’d been a risk no one had been willing to take. Who would want to be friends with the weird skinny kid that Dudley liked to beat up? Who wanted to be friends with someone who made weird things happen and frequently was covered in bruises?
Harry grinned, a little sheepishly, but he met Draco’s look with a heat of his own. ‘Take me to bed?’
‘I think he’ll come around,’ she’d said. ‘But I need him to see that what he said was wrong. We all expected him to hate Draco and be mad about that – for good reason! – but attacking you for loving a man isn’t something I’m willing to let slide. It makes him just as bad as Draco when he called me mudblood – that isn’t something I have any control over, and your sexuality isn’t something you chose.’ She took a deep breath before she said her final words on the matter, ‘I don’t want to be with someone who could take seven years of friendship – in which we went through hell together – and turn it aside with words specifically chosen to hurt.’
Harry doesn’t roll his eyes because up until about an hour ago he’d honestly thought that was a possibility. ‘No, she really won’t. The three of us have a lot to talk about.’
Given Hermione’s fascination with their bond he didn’t see any reason not to explain, ‘I got another tattoo over the Christmas break. A snitch.’ He motioned over to Harry and the now covered tattoo. ‘It seems to travel back and forth between us at will.’
The man stared at her in surprise, green eyes just as vibrant as she remembered, although they weren’t hidden behind glasses anymore. ‘Hermione?’
It was strange, knowing that the relationship he had with his childhood rival was more stable and healthier than the one two best friends had embarked on. He didn’t fancy Hermione’s reaction if he actually said that, though. This was one of those times where he could only offer bits of advice when asked and mostly, he just needed to be a friendly shoulder.
Malfoy looked at her and smirked and that smirk was every bit the Malfoy she remembered. ‘She really is that Hermione,’ Malfoy assured his daughter. To Hermione, Malfoy said, ‘Do you have time for tea? My husband would really like to see you.’
There was a beat while they all considered that and then Pomfrey knocked down the suggestion. ‘Any form of apparition will do more harm than good. The stasis can hold her another thirteen minutes by my count.’
‘What was I supposed to say?’ Harry mused. ‘I didn’t even know I fancied him.’ He considered that. ‘I mean, I didn’t fancy him, not then, but bloody hell Hermione, he took up a lot of my time.’
It was only when they turned to face Joseph and their classmates that Draco realised at some point during the duel, they’d traded wands. Draco held Harry’s wand out for him and accepted his own hawthorn wand in return, stowing it back in his holster before he ran a hand through his sweaty hair.
‘Not just the Dark ones,’ Harry murmured but didn’t elaborate. He thought if he laid out too much, Ron’s head might explode. He seemed to be having enough trouble wrapping his head around the idea that Harry was friends with Draco. Harry was sure the idea that Draco and Narcissa were contemplating clearing out the Manor of everything magical and selling it to some muggles would blow Ron’s mind. He was only just learning there was more to Draco than the pointy arrogant git, best not to push it with a wild story of redemption and muggle acceptance.
Draco turned back around, his stomach twisting. Harry reached out and lay a hand on the portrait’s frame. Draco watched him send a pulse of magic into it, not much but enough that it tore through the spells on the frame. ‘Hello,’ he said softly. ‘Who’re you?’
He tightened his hand around Draco’s in his pocket, but he didn’t speak, leaving Draco to have this moment of quiet reflection.
‘I can’t,’ the junior auror repeated. This time he said it with an apologetic shake as he tried to stare down the famous Boy Who Lived and found himself wondering if he was about to be cursed. Or die. Harry’s expression was rapidly traveling from anger to rage and while Draco wasn’t surprised when the streetlight above them blew in a shower of sparks and glass, he did wish Harry could have kept better control of his temper.
He’d been tired and sad, and he remembered telling Harry about his fantasy, about the wife or husband he’d have, about the kids – always more than one because he was an only child and he’d hated it. About the warm house he wanted. Even then he’d been able to admit the Manor would never be home again, not the way it once had been. The Dark Lord had ruined most of his childhood memories associated with those great sweeping halls and lush gardens.
Draco tugged his arm free. ‘It’s fine.’ Draco started moving up the stairs toward McGonagall’s office. The Headmistress swept after him, lips pursed. Draco appreciated that this didn’t sit well with her but there wasn’t much she could do about it. There wasn’t much Harry could do about it either but that didn’t stop him from trying.
Draco thought that was hilarious, but his attention was drawn away from Weasley when he felt Granger’s eyes burning holes into him. He met her gaze and raised a brow, wordlessly issuing her a challenge. He knew what he was saying with his look, he knew he was daring her to make a thing of it, but he wasn’t sure she understood the full implications of the challenge he was issuing.
She studied him while he tugged on his t-shirt and jumper but didn’t say a word until he’d pulled on his boots (Pomfrey, thankfully, had simply removed them the day before, rather than vanish them), propping a foot on the chair by the bed to do up the laces.
If, if, if, so many possibilities, so many chances and moments where things could have gone so differently. There were moments of choice he remembered so clearly, moments like the Astronomy Tower, the night after fifth year when he’d been summoned to Voldemort and given an ultimatum in the form of a reward.
Draco had come to hate these particular wards. They were the main reason he’d become so useful to the Ministry.
Draco snorted. ‘I’d have loved to have seen that.’ He laughed with genuine delight. ‘Your face must have been hilarious.’
‘In Defence,’ Draco hastily clarified because he knew the kind of response such an open question could elicit from Luna.
‘Harry,’ Luna scolded, reaching out behind her to gently stroke the peeling atrocity of wallpaper on the internal wall. ‘He didn’t mean that,’ she crooned.
So she watched and watched, and she saw the way Malfoy looked at Harry and she thought maybe she understood why he was trying so hard to pretend he had changed but she didn’t, and she missed it completely – much like she thought Harry had missed it because even in his obsession he could be oblivious. Only she’d stumbled across them kissing so tenderly in the entrance hall and it had taken her so completely by surprise because she’d suspected Malfoy’s interest, but Harry’s had completely escaped her.
Harry drew Draco back out of his sleepy musings with a quiet chuckle and the suggestion, ‘Maybe next year.’
Draco shrugged. ‘You had a lot going on,’ he conceded. ‘That doesn’t mean the fact you can’t even identify the four other prefects in your own house doesn’t baffle me.’ He gave a shudder. ‘I couldn’t forget any of them after the sexual education fiasco that came about in third year.’
Luna. She was standing back, long blond hair hanging loose over her shoulder, with her wand tucked behind her ear and her usual strange style – today she appeared to be wearing her old radish earrings – but what brought Hermione up short was the man standing beside her. The much taller figure wasn’t her father – it was Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked as though he wanted to protest but Draco nodded easily and turned to walk out of the house. Harry hesitated a moment before he turned to follow. ‘We could stick around and help.’
The spell didn’t so much trigger as erupt. There were more than a few startled cries from behind them as a mushroom shaped cloud burst out of the ground at the dog’s feet and engulfed it. Draco had been prepared for a curse or a spell, he’d not been prepared for a mushroom cloud of hungry cannibalistic magic that soaked up the magic from Harry’s spell until the transfiguration failed and the rock fell lifeless to frozen ground.
Pomfrey used a spell to clear away the blood, another to seal the wound and applied some dittany to ease the inflammation and scarring. When she stepped back Luna sighed sadly, fingers reaching out to trace over the tattoo now that there wasn’t a chunk of glass in the way.
Harry dropped his head against the table with a thump, just barely missing his soup. He was pathetic.
What it was, was chaos. For a disorienting moment, Draco could only make out colour and sound in a kaleidoscope of impressions that made his stomach lurch and then reality snapped back around him, and he realised they were in the middle of a muggle town and the screams and chaos came from the magic and curses being thrown into a crowd of celebrating muggles.
‘Narcissa Malfoy tutored you in Potions.’ Ron didn’t seem like he believed they were words coming out of his mouth. He shook his head. ‘Nope. Sorry, mate, I get that you’re friends with the git now – not that I understand that – but I just can’t picture that.’
The class was probably larger than any previous NEWTs class had been but remained small enough with the limited number of students returning to feel somewhat intimate. Still, everyone who came in cast surprised and suspicious looks at Draco seated beside Harry. Girl Weasley shot him a look of aggravation when she realised she wouldn’t be sitting beside Harry and dropped into a chair beside one of her friends instead. Draco remained unaffected by her look.
Draco had coughed to clear his throat and straightened up, grateful the urge to hug her had passed and now he was just left scrambling madly to pull himself back together. Correcting her was about the only thing holding him together then because he’d been rather in the mood to go and find Harry wherever he was, drag him back to his (what would absolutely become their) room and fuck him into the mattress. Or potentially up against a wall. He wasn’t too picky right in that moment. Someone he never thought in a million years would accept their relationship had literally just given her blessing and it was weird. He’d needed something to ground him and spin everything back to normal.
‘I got my first hand job that night,’ Draco told her, eyes distant as he thought back to a time when life had been easy and he hadn’t yet been forced to understand.
‘I hate you,’ he told Harry when just opening the door of Bella’s vault had resulted in a cascade of ugly magical knockoffs that almost knocked their goblin escort clean off his feet.
While Harry poked around the towers of books looking for the one on blood runes that Draco had used and promised to lend to Bill, Draco picked a box of parchment at random and started to leaf through its contents. What he found made him snort a laugh.
It was why the relief he felt when they reached the gargoyle and found Katarina Winthrop and old Abe Mendenhall waiting for them had him almost wilting. Winthrop was young but competent, she’d come through training with Tonks and although she’d never been part of Dumbledore’s Order, she was one of the good ones. She always treated him fairly, being of the belief that he’d done his time and that someone like Harry Potter wouldn’t have spoken up for him if he wasn’t somewhat deserving of a second chance.
curses was reserved for the worst (and sometimes just the oldest) when the counter curse wasn’t known or wasn’t possible. Some blood curses fell into the category of impossible to dismantle as not many curse breakers were willing to perform their own sacrifices just to safely take down a curse. Most of the broken curses were simply so old the correct charms and counter curses weren’t known.
While re-reading the books, the amount of fat shaming I've realised is in them is actually horrifying. I spent all of my teens and a good part of my twenties clinically obese and it took a long time to relearn my food habits and that exercise was a good thing, I'm in the fourth book now and just, the things that Dudley is going through are just dismissed and made a joke and I HATE reading that. But in thinking about the fact Smeltings doesn't make big enough uniforms I was also thinking about the Hogwarts uniform (from the books - the movies did this way better). I am never going to be a twig, I don't want to be a twig, I (as much as I complain) like my boobs and my butt, I worked hard for those things but even now, if you put me in one of those Hogwarts robes I would hate it. I would feel like the Trunchbull, I would lose so much of the confidence I'd gained because all the things I have struggled to own about myself would be hidden beneath a shapeless sack of heavy black fabric and so here in this chapter, Hannah is me. Ron is looking at her and he's seeing a shapeless blob, he's seeing and voicing all her insecurities and Draco and Hermione are the friends I'd wished I had.
Harry took the bark without pausing in his conversation with Granger and Weasley and began to dutifully shred it. Draco felt his lips twitch into a smile. If he’d turned around then, he might have noticed the weird look Granger was shooting him. Draco was focused on his potion though, and it was easier to follow the instructions (making his own small changes along the way just as Severus had taught him), handing Harry things to shred or dice, than it was to deal with Granger and her Weasley on a high from seeing their best friend for the first time in four months.
And on that note, please leave me your thoughts on the continuing development of Draco and Harry's bond and how I'm torturing poor Hogwarts.
Draco studied the smooth surface of the box and, after all four of them had tried every diagnostic charm they could think of, shrugged. ‘I haven’t a clue.’
Draco had laughed then in the library and now he took her affection with good humour, not even feeling remotely disturbed to realise he was happy to return her affection. He liked Ginny, had watched her enough over the years as she hovered on the periphery of the Golden Trio that, now that he was with Harry, he could view those moments of observation objectively to see how strong Ginny was. Who else could have fought off Voldemort at the tender age of eleven?
