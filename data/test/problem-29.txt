It was Draco’s turn to frown. “We haven’t really talked about it. He just helps separate me from Theo during meals really.”
Sirius grinned. “That’s the best part!” he exclaimed. Harry looked up, temporarily offended until Sirius continued. “I’m not dead.”
The Healer ran a light scan over Draco. “Well, I’m putting you back on bedrest but I don’t think for long. A couple days and you’ll be right as rain.” Draco groaned in annoyance. “You didn’t lose any of the core, just tore it a bit. Please don’t cast above the level you’re ready for next time, okay?”
put it together, albeit drunkenly at the club but had figured it out nonetheless. The green-eyed teen in question was poking his head into the door.
Remus frowned and for a moment, Draco thought he made it worse. “He is. They think he’ll wake up sometime today, now.”
The night was set from there. Once Harry was drunk enough, he regaled them with the summer’s events, carefully editing out the parts with Draco. The whiskey had loosened his tongue, making it easier for him to admit out loud his new heritage to people other than his best friends. They swore not to spread it around; Harry wasn’t sure how much he trusted that. At the end of the night when the three were sleeping, Harry snuck out, making his way to the Prefect dorm.
James ran with Sirius to the fireplace and threw Floo powder into the flames and suddenly his son was gone, leaving him alone in the house with a werewolf upstairs.
“I don’t know, how is Remus, dad?” Jack joked, giving the two some space.
of us,” he said, aiming his own glare at Harry.
Harry sighed, waving a hand at the shattered vase—it put itself back together as he said, “You’re right. I am exhausted and I do need rest. I’m a bit cranky.” He smiled sheepishly.
"Great," Draco replied sarcastically in between enthusiastic bites. "Just what I need: more mother henning."
“That was courageous of you.”
Draco shook his head. “No, it just all happened at once. I feel like a snapped band.” He rubbed his throat at the soreness of speaking. Remus rummaged through the shelves and handed him a pain potion, which he took immediately. Draco sighed in relief as it worked wonders on his aching muscles. The headache began to lift as well. He began to change under the blanket. “I don’t understand what happened.”
If Draco were to say no, he'd pack up and leave the very day. He hated being embarrassed and he was risking a lot in this simple question.
So if this was worded incorrectly, or something that Draco did was not probable (even for wizarding standards) please tell me so I don't offend anyone. And also so that I can be a better writer.
"Just some... ideas of what to do. I wasn't sure if you had much planned." He answered, his voice still slightly above a whisper.
“Wait!
“You aren’t the only one who wishes they were dead, Potter. Death is far better than life.”
She still stood tall and still when she spoke, but her facial features had softened tremendously, allowing Draco to see that she meant it. “I do sincerely hope this year can be of some relief to you,
In those moments, it was easy to disregard Draco’s lack of words. Those moments felt so intimate. So sure. They felt like Draco was just moments away from confessing his undying love, and that feeling was enough to carry Harry ions away.
Blood traitor! Friends with the son of a mudblood now, aren't we?
Draco stared at him, his body language changed instantly. Instead of the usual straight back and folded hands, his body slumped over, hands running through his mane of platinum blond hair.
How dare you?
Draco slumped in his seat, and a persistent thought told him that Harry was cross with
“Yeah? Go on then.” Draco broke away in the hug and stepped back, but he held Harry’s hand and didn’t let go.
"Well, Draco," Narcissa reminded kindly, "you don't have to go." She stood amongst the mess too, looking at her son with a confused expression on her face. As a Slytherin, she had obviously faced numerous moments of persecution in her life, but never as much as her son had to.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
Have a wonderful day! Thank you for keeping with me through all of this!
"Yes?" Draco asked with a mouthful of jellybeans.
in general, didn’t deserve to feel happiness in any shape or form. “Are you mad at me?”
After all, your house was your family, and family understands one another like no one else.
hope they are smiling and laughing, something they weren’t able to do in their last days.” He tried hard not to look, but he heard sniffles and quiet sobs all around, they only made him feel worse.
“I suppose.” Draco said, eyeing his own platter. He
The last thing Harry said that was audible, before his voice shut off like a child’s wound-up toy was “why did you leave me?”
He got to his knees and kneeled directly in front of the blond haired boy. Blowing on his face, he reached for his wand hand slowly.
their purpose.” Draco replied, giving Harry a pointed look. Of course the Hogwarts library books were helpful, if they weren’t, there’d be no point in them being there.
"Draco, what could you have possibly done?" Narcissa kissed his head once more, "What was so bad that you feel you are unfit for companionship?"
Draco stood abruptly, and it was all Harry could do to keep up with the wizard’s long strides. They walked and walked, and Harry wondered how they would manage to sneak out, before they found the Room of Requirement and stepped inside.
cared back. He had no more energy to care, if his father was dead so be it. If his mother was gone, so be it. Maybe he could join them, maybe then, after an eternal rest, he’d have enough energy to care again. Care that he’d wasted his life. The eighteen years that he’d lived were for not, because he only used them to cause pain.
No, in fact, Neville had been more than kind. He apologized for both the death of his aunt and the imprisonment of his father. And now the three of them had become "good" friends. Friends who talked about possibly real creatures and idolized the idea of plant growing then gossiped about young toddlers.
“Maybe you shouldn’t have eaten so many treacle tarts then,” Draco offered, lightly placing his hand over his stomach.
But in a way, she did.
“More like this one,” he pointed to his book. “With stories like it?”
Draco stared at his hands, well, more so at the camera of course. It was a dark color, made of smooth silver steel, it was slick and it seemed to fit perfectly in his hands. “There was a boy, Professor.” Draco felt his nose burn, but he continued, never looking up from the device. “There was a boy and he had one of these. He loved it, I think. I
“Just me, I’m afraid.”
"Why? Why!" Draco said standing up from his place at Luna's table."Because, if you haven't noticed, Ginny Weasley is a bloody Weasley!"
“Are you an eighth year?” Draco stumbled and his nose flared as he looked down on a short, chubby witch who couldn’t have been in more than fourth year.
“He gave Hagrid his motorcycle to drop me at the Dursleys. Do you think he had it back yet?”
His mom smiled a heartfelt smile and stood up herself. "Dress, Draco. And maybe we can discuss my lengthy paragraph over a mid-morning breakfast. Harry and Teddy are spending some quality "Godfather and son" moments together, so I'm free most of the day." Draco nodded, already starting to choose an outfit to go under some casual robes. "I love you sweetheart."
After a few moments, Draco’s stomach began to growl and rather than let it be, he decided to try the Shepard’s pie. As usual, it was rather delicious, and he finished it up quickly. Every so often, his stomach would growl, and he’d give in, taking bites of roast beef or Yorkshire pudding until he was full. Harry didn’t seem to eat anything other than his tarts, but Draco didn’t comment on his eating habits.

“I don’t suppose you know what you plan on doing for the future, Mr. Malfoy?” She asked.
noticed a few people gathered around the Giant Squid’s lake, he hadn’t realized they were making memorials; he certainly hadn’t had the guts to go and ask the Headmistress, who’d been the only teacher he’d talked to in his days at the castle. He hadn’t thought to ask the Bloody Baron either, because he was a ghost, and prior to that morning, he hadn’t realized ghosts could leave the inside of the castle.
He sighed and wished he could shut off his brain. He was done thinking faster than the speed of light, trying to anticipate the enemies next move in order to live another day. He shouldn’t have to do this anymore. The enemy was dead.
Was he getting worked up again?
He continued browsing the internet in search of muggle things worthy of his attention; he'd probably been distracted not five minutes before a red-faced Draco Malfoy barged into his room.
For the day that allowed Draco Malfoy to finally feel like a new man - a changed man even - only burned Harry Potter in the most agonizing of ways. While Draco smiled at his reflection, feeling for the first time in ages like someone worthy of fighting for, Harry Potter lay glowering in his four-poster bed, wishing more than ever that he could see the face of Sirius Black just once more.
He placed the key in his bag before apparating downstairs, right in front of Draco Lucius Malfoy. He began making a face and looked as if he'd start berating Harry for startling him, but Harry quickly silenced him with his hand.
if he could convince Hermione to make them, getting fake IDs and drinking the nights away.
Harry gulped yet again at the encouraging look on Draco’s face, and it took all of him to not breakdown into tears.
But of course, he was exaggerating.
“I know it’s Sirius Black’s birthday,” he stated, and he allowed himself a quick glance in Harry’s direction. He didn’t know how to react when Potter sucked in a deep breath, so he continued, hoping that whatever came from his mouth next wouldn’t force Harry Potter away. Not that he would care, but maybe he would. Losing potential friends seemed worse than losing people you were already close with. Draco compared it to grabbing for something that was barely out of reach; longing for something you just couldn’t get. Perhaps it was precisely what he deserved, but he tried not to think about that.
Narcissa would surely think he was with fever if she checked his forehead, he was so nervous.
Thankfully, Ginny cleared her throat, silently telling everyone else in the room to focus on her and what she was about to say. "So Draco," she began. "Have you got a bunch of clothes in your case? What did you bring?"
“Okay.” And it was clear that Draco wanted to say something else, something different; but something stopped him. Was it Harry? Or something else? He supposed it didn’t matter, even though it did.
Friends.
“That’ll be a miracle.”
A few more minutes passed and Draco eyed the clock again, a bit disappointed to see that time had barely changed. He ought to make some excuse and leave the room, or better yet, make Harry leave himself. It wasn’t that he didn’t enjoy the company, he supposed it was alright, it was simply because things were becoming rather awkward, and he didn’t trust himself to even things out.
“Thanks, Potter.”
Left and right the voices went, never ceasing to stop or even so much as become quieter. Harry tried his best to ignore it with his entire being, focusing on the small crunch as he munched his toast and the burst of tangy juice when he bit into his orange slices.
Harry’s knuckles were white from the absurd amount of force he used to grab hold of the steering wheel, and he could practically hear Draco’s worry-filled voice reminding him to not get so wound up.
"Shut up, Potter. It's much to early for this." Malfoy and Harry, although they had lived together almost two years, could not at all call each other friends.
“Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall greeted, a tense smile across her face.
But his hair was teal and unrecognizable as long as he didn’t brush it back in its usual style, which he’d made sure not to do. Instead it was a mop of unchoreographed hair atop his head. Draco found it quite uncomfortable, but the thought of being around so many people, being unrecognizable, even for a moment, enticed him way more than it should have.
He remembered the exact way Potter's mouth had formed when he asked his question. He knew the exact hair that had fallen out of place when Harry showed him the box with the key. He knew exactly which of his green eyes reflected the light more during that time.
It was only when Draco was on the verge of giving up the search, and instead ready to sit down and ponder for a bit, did he find Harry in a darker part of a rarely occupied hall. It made him wonder how similar the two actually were.
Harry nodded, "Right." he sighed and Draco thought he looked personally defeated. "Sorry."
, a real muggle experience.
Every ounce of uncomfortableness was revenge dedicated to the lives he’d stolen. He hated to admit it, but he was eager for the accusations that were sure to come, telling him that it should’ve been him cold against the concrete rather than the people who
He quickly swished his wand and watched as everything flew back into its rightful place. His large king-sized bed was made. The nightstands on either side of it was instantly cleared of wrappers and bottles. The rug on his floor looked as if it had been recently vacuumed. His dresser drawers closed and he could no longer see clothes hanging form them. His wardrobe was instantly repaired to its former glory. Not a speck of dirt was visible. Even his desk with all of his trinkets was organized.
Once completely clean, the two hugged each other and began making small talk. Luna squeezed Draco's thigh before excusing herself and sitting understandably close to her girlfriend.
For it was the morning of September 1st. And the students of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were surely on their way.
"Yes, thank you Harry." Narcissa seemed calm but he could tell she was urgent to see what was the matter. He had become a sort of second child, or third, after the war and like any good mother, she knew when her children weren't at their best.
Draco inhaled and fell silent. Harry couldn't tell if Draco was upset or not, his reaction could mean a number of things. He only hoped that when he asked the question he wanted to, Draco would respond the way Harry was hoping. Had been hoping for weeks, months.
"You haven't so much s sneered at me for..." Harry stopped and looked as if he were thinking. "Eight or nine months. It's weird, honestly." The boy admitted.
Friends that didn't complain about being a Slytherin in these times of uncertainty, friends who didn't leave him because of his status or his disgusting tattoo.
“Your hunger-” Harry paused, and a small smirk spread across his face as he tried to hide his laughter. “Your
"Draco, darling." Narcissa knew and had always known that despite Draco being raised like his father's perfect heir, he was a sweet, caring boy at heart. One with feelings, one with empathy.
eat, afterall, it was over twenty-four hours since his last meal. And he could always stay up and finish any forgotten assignments, seeing as he’d slept so much in the past day, he wasn’t really tired anymore.
“Y-yes.”
to bee bc i know she's secretly asking this I AM SORRY and to anyone else reading I will work on my updates i swear!
. But what could he do about it? Everyone knows the weak can’t do a damn thing for themselves.
Will be updated every other Friday!
As Draco nodded Harry crossed the room and sat on his bed. It was squishy and soft and seemed to be perfect for sleeping on. He sighed a relaxed sigh as he bounced a bit.
Caring took energy, energy he didn’t have anymore. He’d cared about his father all of his life and he’d been hurt by him. He’d cared about his mother all of his life and he’d been hurt by her. He cared and he cared and he cared and no one
And then Hogwarts had come, and that was the end of it all.
From his desk, he took out a stack of short square shaped papers, and waved Draco over to him. “Going home every summer was always a treat, and bringing back my
"Yeah. Tricky part is Luna and Ginny."
Harry and Draco didn't really get much of a chance to talk during the day, busy schedules and clingy friends got in the way; such as Ron Weasley, who refused to grow up and behave like the adult he was. The redhead was constantly muttering nonsense under his breath which earned him deadly glares from his girlfriend and terrifying threats from his sister. It didn’t cheer him up much, Hermione and Ginny having his back, because the thought of someone muttering about him, when he was only a few feet away, was intoxicatingly stressful.
looked. No one he’d ever truly
"That one's rather difficult, I'd say. You wouldn't believe me." Harry said quietly. It was a rather far stretch, comparing Luna Lovegood to the man he had thought of.
"Well, Ginny did. Because you've become friends with her and Luna and Neville. I thought it would be smart, because you're considering sharing a room with me anyway."
They were so close, they told one another everything. They confided in each other, they trusted one another. They could throw around jokes and funny stories, as well as have deep and meaningful conversations. They were perfect for each other. Draco was Harry’s soulmate, at least that was what Harry believed.
sincere.
"Anyway, Harry," Ron started, the argument between the couple subsiding rather quickly. "Why would you want to live with Malfoy anyway? After everything you two have been through, I mean you were at each other's neck for years?"
Harry could practically hear Hagrid's voice as he read the short letter. He shook his head, grinning a toothy smile, as he placed down the letter and looked through the clothes.
He turned quickly and ran up the stairs, stopping only when he saw the boys dorm.
He’d only placed his
“I’m completely fine, Potter. Thank you.” He answered shortly, wishing hard that he could just stare at the stars for the remainder of the night. For the remainder of the weekend, preferably, or perhaps even until the very last hour of the last day of October. He imagined how absolutely bliss life would be if he could watch the minutes of October slowly trickle away as he stared at the stars he’d always looked at.
“And you’re sure it's nothing to do with your-” Harry took a moment to look around, making sure no one was eavesdropping onto their conversation. “-Your
"I've invited Neville over as well," Luna Lovegood said as she placed a small cup of tea in front of Draco.
"I... I just have been thinking. I am... I am nearly nineteen. I'm an adult in both the muggle and Wizarding worlds." He took a sip of tea before continuing. "I've always wanted to go to university, even after getting accepted to Hogwarts."
“Quite.”
Three hours before the train was set to arrive, Draco was back in the Eighth year dorm rooms, standing a few feet away from his four-poster bed, hands on his hips. He was trying his best to think of a spell that might conceal his entire existence a bit better, but the stress of the upcoming events were overtaking him. His breath was heavy and labored, as it had been since his meeting with the Headmistress had concluded. He knew he had every opportunity to go and ask a professor for spell help, but his mind told him no.
Like the petty wizard reshe was, Draco had no interest in actually speaking to the boy the first few times, and he’d enjoyed the way Potter squirmed in the awkward silence until it became too much and he left again. He would continue his persistent studies and smile to himself at the thought that he, Draco Malfoy, had made Harry Potter nervous.  But eventually, around Potter’s fifth or sixth visit, Draco had decided to question his actions. It didn’t seem right that he’d
he’d probably bullied a number of times. “He would’ve loved this class, he really liked cameras.”
Draco sipped from the cup, then turned a page before another shiver erupted through his body. It seemed his body adopted an unusual rhythm for any given moment, and this panic-attack-aftercare that Hermione had forced upon him was no exception. Sip, turn, shiver, repeat.
need a bit of a break from the chaos this wonderful usually brings.” Mutters of agreement began to erupt in the room, and Draco nodded along.
"What would you do?" Draco raised an eyebrow and made eye contact with the messy haired boy for a small fragment of time before putting his focus back on his plate of breakfast. Harry's eyes widened and he choked a bit on his pumpkin juice.
Harry glared at him, lifting his head just a bit, revealing the redness in his eyes that Draco must have missed when he was giving Harry a one-over.
Stupid boy! And everything went white. Draco whipped his head around.
Real friends.
“If you insist.”
Just for a moment.
“I’m sure. Might I add, show him some of your new
Draco was significantly early to his first class, which coincidentally was Muggle Studies. He’d yet to go inside, because his nerves were through the roof and he wished that he could just disappear into the void, but he’d already given himself a pep-talk, and he thought it’d be enough to just walk in.
"Why does this bother you?" Draco figured answering only yes or no questions or just asking them himself, he wouldn't reveal too much to Harry.
No, that wasn’t her name.
Draco continued his unintelligible mumbling as Harry accioed a glass of water to him. "Draco," he said quietly. Nothing. Not even a glance.
Draco widened his eyes, though it was more so in annoyed shock than genuine. “You’re absolutely horrific when it comes to answering simple questions.”
The ground was covered in snow, and Harry found himself slowly growing a hatred for the freezing air. Of course, the snow had nothing to do with the death of his parents, but there was no one left to blame, so he figured he could go on blaming other things until he felt it was good enough. He knew it wasn’t healthy, but no one could really tell him anything anymore. He had saved the entirety of the Wizarding World, and as a gift, they’d given him the feeling of loneliness.
He knew what he’d tell them. He’d say they were right, that there wasn’t a single lie in their words. He’d encourage them to do it themselves,
Ron looked up, one brow up showing his confusion quite clearly. Suddenly, both raised into his hairline and his mouth fell open. Harry felt something in his stomach twist. If Ron found out, what would he say? This was his best mate, he wouldn't judge him, would he? His own sister was lesbian, he had never gotten the impression that Ron didn't support her.
problems into
“Why do you dislike October?” Harry asked suddenly, startling Draco. Draco shut his book sharply and inhaled, trying to digest what Harry had asked. He rolled the phrase over in his mind until it made sense, and then allowed himself to process it a bit more to figure out how he’d word his answer.
"No matter, her parents have suggested a sleepover. We're going to America to do something random, but its couple's Draco! It's bloody couples. And Neville is dating Hannah Abbot and I've no one to go with and...
Draco had realized that rather quickly as he ran down a staircase that was about to move by itself. His new blue hair and slight tan would do nothing to hide his appearance. If he wanted to go unnoticed, he’d have to do a hell of a lot more than
“Erm, yes?” He answered, taking a step back and praying the girl wouldn’t recognize him.
“Thank you.
"Mother, please." Draco's voice was nothing but a croaky, quiet whimper after all of the sobbing that had been done. "Please come in." It was said as an afterthought despite wanting to burst out of his mouth the moment he heard his mother tapping at his lavatory door.
"Draco?"
"A few minutes. I came the second he started mumbling. They aren't incantations." She said. She seemed confused.
It was almost melodic, and he relished in the peaceful silence.
His face relaxed and he thanked her for the food. She nodded her reply and moved away, going back to talk with her husband.
“I thought you might be hungry,” Harry said, and it really didn’t seem like he was talking to Draco, even though they were the only people in the room. Draco placed the platter he’d taken onto one of the Hufflepuff’s bedside tables, and watched as Harry did the same. Draco wondered just how difficult it had been to sneak off away from the feast, because Potter was bent over and trying his hardest to take in the deepest of breaths.
Interrupting his thoughts was the ever familiar door to the Transfiguration room, where Professor McGonnagall, despite being the headmistress of Hogwarts, still taught. He stepped in the classroom, and he sighed when he realized he was still rather early. There was almost no one in the room. Just a small group of Hufflepuffs. He took a seat at the back of the classroom, careful to not make eye contact. He  even roughed up his hair a little bit, knowing that his usual slicked back style was a very prominent identification for him.
“You’re sure you’re fine?” Harry asked again, and Draco rolled his eyes. Clinginess seemed to be a prominent trait in Harry Potter, as well as irritable persistence. He was
Narcissa Black was a gift from heaven in his opinion. He'd told her this before, after a good amount of drinking during the Christmastime holidays, and unsurprisingly, Narcissa was now one of the many people who thought of Harry as dramatic.
No. this wasn't right. They were enemies. Enemies don't help each other out, no matter if their wrongdoings were forced out of them. They were enemies. "We were enemies!" He said rising from his seat.
Immediate talk of who could replace Draco began.
"You shouldn't've," Draco said lowly, his voice slightly hoarse from crying.
emerged from the doorframe. Draco took a few steps back, eyes wide and arm ready to grasp his wand.
Didn’t he deserve love too?
"Okay."
"So," Draco began, desperate to get away from the center topic of discussion. Despite everyone's prior beliefs, he no longer wished to be the center of attention. "Are you expecting?"
Narcissa, ever the gentle-hearted mother, sat next to her son, rubbing his thigh and leaning him on her chest. "I'm sure his recent yearning for friendship with you is nothing but heartfelt," she whispered into his ear. "But you'll never know how people truly feel unless you allow yourself to take certain matters into your own two hands. Then, and only then, is it appropriate to judge one's true intentions."
"Draco?" Her voice was small and timid. Harry didn't realize someone from the snake house could be so kind.
“Are you…” Draco trailed, not wanting to be seen as rude. “Are you a muggle-born?” He still found that to be a bit rude, though he hadn’t said “mudblood.” Would his words be constructed into something different just because of his blood status? Would he have to be more careful than other pure-bloods because of his namesake? Was this even something to worry about, was he just over reacting?
“If I had been just a bit older, maybe-” he stopped, not even realizing he had begun to cry until he joked on his own sob. “It was me Voldemort was after, not my mum, not my dad. If they had just-”
"We talked this morning, Harold," Draco chided as he turned on his heels. He stood at the door of the Manor, and Harry got the impression that he was about to apparate, so he called out again.
“How about the lot of us split into groups and,” She reached behind her desk and pulled out a crate of random objects. “I’ve found that I need new cushions for my desks, so get to it.” She flicked her wand and a bunch of random things appeared on everyone’s desk. Draco wasn’t paying attention though, she’d said to split into groups. With other
“Sprout reckons taking me on for an apprenticeship would put me first in line to be the new Herbology professor the moment she retires!” Neville explained, taking a triumphant bite into his bagel and leaning backwards so far Draco thought he might fall off the bench. “How brilliant would that be?”
! There's a difference." Ginny said, bags under her eyes. Her fiery, red hair was messy due to the lack of brushing it had that morning.
Hermione brushed her hair out of her face and took a seat next to Ron. "And you drenched the poor boy in water." She made a disapproving look that both Professor McGonagall and Molly Weasley would have been proud of.
"Yes, Blaise, I know they're mostly Gryffindors but-"
“Oh! Yes, Professor.”
“Erm, uh, yes! Yes. I’m sorry, I’d already,” he motioned for his stuff in the corner.
Draco was sure to stuff his face as respectfully as he could, all the while pouring himself into a lengthy textbook or sprint writing notes or essays on long pieces of parchment. There was a brief moment in which Draco had filled himself to the brim, and looked away from his task to take in his surroundings. That was when Harry cracked his way through Draco’s pent up walls with a witty joke that more often made Draco scowl than laugh. Although, sometimes, it was an observation about the weather, or a small fact he’d learned in his studies.
Draco was much better now. It was a few minutes before dinner time and he was standing in front of his mirror, note cards in hand.
"Harry's? No. I assure you." She began gently rubbing his head, pulling his platinum blond locks through her bony fingers. "But I of course knew something was aloof."
He shook his head, becoming cross with himself that even in such a troubling situation he could only be bothered with himself. His internalized selfishness was slowly becoming one of his most hated things about himself.
“And so she confided
Draco Lucius Malfoy could very plainly hear his mother outside the bathroom door, knocking urgently, yet quietly so as to not awaken the baby. He himself was curled up and away in the corner near the sink, his usually pale, smooth face was now blotchy and red. His eyes were swollen, his nose was brighter than Rudolph's, and his bottom lip quivered unpleasantly.
"Busy doing what?" Draco looked personally offended.
Yes! And Teddy was gone.
Hermione giggled at Neville’s antics, and Draco joined in easily; he was happy to be happy.
He cleared his throat before standing, rather abruptly in Draco's opinion, but he obviously didn't mind. Why would he? It was just stupid Potter, the hero of the Wizarding World that his mother had so graciously invited into their home.
What was it with these nice people in this ugly world?
Draco was putting off his visit to the headmistress’s office for as long as he possibly could before Professor McGonagall caught on to his stalling; but each minute he allowed himself to waste, the more he felt himself wanting to follow through with his tasks. Eventually, he stood up, pocketing his book, and walked back into the castle.
“Well, you can understand why I never knew that.”
“WHY WAS I SO IMPORTANT?”
"Hi, Mrs. Weasley."  Harry was engulfed in a warm hug by a certain red-haired witch.
-----
And he couldn't understand why that was, because he, Draco Malfoy, was definitely
. He didn’t see the need to worry about anything, he was completely fine, if not a bit numb. And wasn’t being numb a good thing, especially in this case? Feeling numb meant no possibility of an intensely emotional panic attack any time soon, and wasn’t that what everyone was trying to make sure wasn’t happening?
“I suppose,” Harry said cheekily, then let out a loud burst of laughter so contagious, Draco joined in quietly.
Just as he got the nerves to say something else, Harry took in a breath and said quite suddenly, “Have you ever been trick-or-treating, Malfoy?”
The room steadily filled with children, adults now he should say. Only twenty were there, of the eighty-eight, and he found himself very grateful. A mix of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors talked loudly as they came, making Draco uncomfortable. He hadn’t been friends with any of them, but he did wish he had the luxury of laughing and smiling on the first day of school again, rather than cowering in fear.
He set his hand out to open the door, wincing at the uncomfortableness of his left arm grasping the door knob. He had stopped using his right arm almost completely over the summer, only using it to write the occasional handwritten letter. But of course, any one could magick his or her quill and parchment to do it for them. His arm wasn’t used to being used so much, but Draco wished it’d learn quicker.
Unlike chapter six, this chapter was read through and planned out. I hope this one suffices a bit better than the last, though I didn't really try to give our poor baby a break. Hopefully, we'll see him get some relief soon, but to be honest, your guess is as good as mine lol. I'm just the writer.
“Oh,” said Ron, and his ears began to turn red. “Oh, right. I dunno to be honest, kept muttering about something in his sleep though. Something about Sirius.”
When he was younger, it had been the imaginary driver that crashed into his parents during their non-existent car crash. Then it had been Sirius, then Peter Pettigrew. Then of course Voldemort. But they were all gone, and who else could he blame but himself.
“You don’t think I’ve read them?”
"What, may I ask, did he say?" Draco let out a dry sob, he was quickly realizing that his distressed mind couldn't actually remember the exact words. The hysteric thoughts zooming through his brain were going so fast, he couldn't grasp onto a single one.
He tensed, he felt that it was rather understandable, and stepped forward,
Finally, when things were just a little too tense and uncomfortable, he allowed the words to shoot off of his mouth before he could rethink his decision.
No. Why was he making himself look like the victim?
“Agree to disagree, I suppose.” Harry said, standing up. Draco stood too, not at all interested in allowing Harry Potter of all people to get the last word.
He, in all honesty, had no idea how she would react. He only hoped it would be nice.
“No it’s not.” Harry said. The idea that death was
.” Draco replied, but he made sure that his smirk was quite prominent on his face.
“I’ll work on that when the world stops its chaos.”
The thought was sweet, and nearly made him ease up his grip. But he shook his head and tightened his hands around the wheel nonetheless, wishing nothing more than that Draco wasn’t so bloody sweet. He wished that he had a reason
But they had never truly spoken to each other. In Harry's defense, Malfoy, and all that he had stood for, hurt and/or killed everyone he had ever loved or cared about.
Harry smiled. Narcissa actually, truly, cared about him. To the point where she'd adopt an entire human just so he could go to Muggle university.
, though he didn’t know what
I-” He stopped suddenly when Draco turned rather abruptly back to look at him but pursued, trying to come off as a calm type that Draco knew he most definitely was not. “I think- I think she was just a bit worried. And-”
But these people, these people who had invited him, were friends. Friends, not by default, but by choice. All of them had chosen to talk to him, without having to live with him for months at a time or being forced by his father.
Pansy sat on the top of the island in his kitchen, Draco noticed how she watched longingly at Teddy, how she cooed and her stern eyes faltered whenever he babbled. He, Harry, Narcisa, and Teddy's grandmother may be the only ones who understand his gibberish, but that didn't stop Pansy from trying at all times.
"Snape! Snape, okay? I think she'd be Severus bloody Snape, Ron! Happy?" Harry snapped, rather upset himself, both at how strange it sounded at loud, and how much Ron disbelieved him.
A few minutes passed, and he finished the pastie, but didn’t take anything else. Harry continued to stuff his face with treacle tart, occasionally pausing to sip his goblet of what was probably pumpkin juice.
Not even a bowl of Severus Snape's pensieve could retrieve whatever had happened in the past hour, it was all going away so fast.
“Don’t worry about it,” and the wizard's hand was touching his shoulder again. He didn’t care really, knowing that it was Professor Wilson’s arm and not
Perhaps it was a all a lost cause, perhaps Draco was right in lack of verbal adoration.
“Can I go now? You do realize you’re making us both late?”
“Because Voldemort killed my parents, and then I killed him. Or kinda, that is.” Draco flinched at the name, and it felt as though his arm began to buzz. Draco spluttered for a second, rather impressed with Harry, as well as a bit startled at the ease in which he said the Dark Lord’s name.
He slid down the wall, lowering Teddy's seat with him. Pansy wasn't there anymore, or at least he couldn't see her.
It was as if he himself wasn't doing a single thing. His eyes were crying, his fingers were clutching to his mother's torso, his toes curled into the bottom's of his feet.
"And who'd Ron be?" Her mood was much calmer, far more interested. Harry made a mental note, Always complement Hermione if you want her to agree to you on things.
Picking up a fork and cutting the pancake in front of him into tiny pieces, he fed small bites to Teddy.
"That father and his friends trapped in our basement? Yes, the very one." Draco said in a monotone voice. Narcissa's eyes widened in horror before shaking her head.
Draco nodded, Of course he knew. His father was a death eater. HIs father was in jail for his crimes. His father, not Pansy's or Blaise's. Draco Lucius Malfoy's dad was rotting away in Azkaban for helping a man whose name wasn't spoken for almost two entire decades.
to be more. Right?
It's November 3rd, and with no way of properly remembering the man that had died for him, Harry comes up with a different solution.
Thank you, and if you like the book, leave a comment or a vote so that I know!
Draco should have snapped at his mother, it was something his father would do. He should have screamed at her that she didn't understand. His father would have expected that of him. He should have glowered at his mother's idiocy, his father raised him to do the very thing.
“Hmm, well then. Forgive me for not believing you.” Harry said, and he rolled his eyes jokingly.
The afternoons gave Harry more of a chance to bother Draco, but still, it was rare. Though Draco could almost always be found at a tucked away table at the far end of the library, he gave little to no leeway to being disturbed during his studies. He worked diligently and tirelessly at perfecting his skills for his NEWTS, and rarely conversed with anyone besides Hermione Granger once the end of school hit.
"I'm fine, Ms. Black, and you?" Harry asked, anxious about continuing. He knew what it would turn into and no matter her reaction to it, he still was nervous.
Post-war Slytherins, especially ones with Dark Lord supporting parents, would most definitely be persecuted for years to come. She didn't understand his struggle as much as she wanted to. She didn't understand why he couldn't accept the people who've accepted him.
Or maybe his getting worked up was the problem?
He thought, though he realized just as soon that it was a silly idea. Draco was rather skilled at occlumency, and Harry was rather
Slowly, he stepped out of the car. He was thankful he hadn’t shed any tears in the car, because Draco was always obscenely quick to noticing them.
He was grateful for the sudden silence when it came, although he didn't know why it happened. He saw Mrs. Weasley walk over to the front door and open it only to reveal Draco Malfoy himself, suitcase in hand and flowers in the other.
Harry cringed.
in this room, as well as the ones who are, unfortunately, no longer with us.” Now the hall filled with regretful and sorrowful murmurs as they remembered the lives of the loved ones they’d lost. Draco squirmed in his seat, beginning to feel quite uncomfortable.
Instead, it was his beloved mother who, instead of magicking the door open, knocked gently at it as a form of privacy.
“Perhaps it’s a full moon,” Draco said as a way to dismiss the current topic of conversation and hopefully eradicate the discourse completely, but it seemed his words brought a sort of strange tension to Potter. One that made him tense up and suck in a seemingly exaggerated breath. One that caused the Boy Wonder, the magnificent Potter, the one that could do no wrong, to stumble and falter. To reach up and squeeze the back of his neck and run a hand through his wild hair.
He found that he didn’t miss the solitude at all, and that he much preferred the presence of others. Draco and Hermione took turns quizzing one another on notes from Transfiguration, a class it seemed every Eighth Year struggled with. Neville joined in, but mostly talked about his invitation to intern under the Herbology professor after second term, which Draco quickly deemed more interesting than studying.
"Yes, because I've given you a key. Like, two or three weeks ago, and you've said nothing but you haven't given it back so I'm assuming you are thinking about it," Harry whispered, ducking his head but looking up at Draco from time to time. Hoping, begging that he'd been considering and that Harry hadn't gotten his hopes up.
"Snape?" Hermione said, rather quietly, yet thoughtful nonetheless. Harry wasn't upset at her tone though, she looked as if she was deeply in thought.
“It’s designed after a muggle classroom,” Professor Wilson explained. Now
Draco sat tentatively next to Potter, and for many moments no sounds were made besides the distant chatter from the goings-on of the castle. Draco had always found it easy to start a conversation, but it seemed that as of late, talking didn’t come quite as easily as it once had.
Harry eyed him as discreetly as possible while reading his book. Draco marched over to the kitchen only to come back minutes later with an angry expression lining his pale face.
“Are you really fine?”
But his mother wasn't placed in this world to serve the every need of the Malfoy boys. "Men."
"But, darling," his mother sighed, deep in thought. "That's... wonderful, I would think."
.” They were mere feet away from the graves, and Harry was boiling. “Why was I so important?” He whispered, and it floated away into the cool wind. He whirled around to Draco, making the boy flinch, and he gave him the deadliest look he could muster. Draco took a step back, reaching for his back pocket, but Harry couldn’t care less. He spun back around and yelled at the top of his lungs:
“You are welcome to visit my office during lunch. I’d be happy to eat and chat with you.” Draco nodded, thanking the man. It seemed he killed two birds with one stone. Not only would he be able to have a seemingly peaceful lunch, he'd also be able to get rid of the thousands upon thousands of questions he had about the muggle world.
With Zabini being a Slytherin and Harry being a Potter, he wasn't allowed to be in the room with him. An unspoken rule made by both Harry and Draco without either of them talking about it.
Stupid boy!
“No,” he said, sighing at the answer he’d settled on. “Well, I suppose I don’t know.” He felt that was a better answer, but he also didn’t like the fact that he’d contradicted himself, something Malfoy’s didn’t do. And though that wasn't what he wanted to be known as anymore, simply another Malfoy, in this instance, in most actually, it was the persistent thought that ran through his mind.
"Well, maybe he could just sleep alone."
"Ginny?" Ron said, his interruptions now annoying both Hermione and Harry.
There was a long silence, and Harry felt an equal sense of comfort and tenseness in their tiny spot. Harry looked over and into Draco’s general direction, and debated on asking a question for what seemed like years.
-----
Draco joined Harry in a quick but intense staring contest in which he was sure he looked downright evil compared to Potter’s innocent stare. It simply wasn’t fair that he was so much better than Draco was, in almost every way possible. It had always been like that. From day one of Hogwarts, from day one in general. Perfect Potter with his perfect scar come to perfectly save the world.
He pleaded with the god's above to let the knocker be his mother coming back for him, but he knew there was only one person it could possibly be: Harry James Potter.
. That somehow Harry’s negative mood was his doing, and that a wizard on his way to becoming a friend was quickly becoming yet another enemy. Potter being his enemy wasn’t anything new, but it certainly wouldn’t help in his current situation. If Harry Potter, the most selfless man of his time, couldn’t find it in his heart to forgive a Malfoy, the rest of the Wizarding World wouldn’t even consider it.
“That’s bullshit, that is.” Draco rolled his eyes, but didn’t explain any further. If he had to go through the process of explaining that he didn’t want to eat, because that would awaken everything else in his body, he’d probably die from embarrassment.
And somewhat unhelpfully, Ron Weasley was the second. “Isn’t today the third of November?”
Just as he placed the cards down on the table and wiped his face down again, a knock was heard at the door.
"Wands everyone! Wands! Give them to me, if you're to be muggles for the weekends, you mustn't have your wands!" Arthur Weasley said loudly as he tried to make his voice heard. Seven rowdy teens were sitting at his table, all of which didn't seem to have learned the meaning of "Sit down and eat your food quietly."
"Hey, Draco!" Harry called out while he was a ways away from Draco. Sprinting a bit, Harry made his way over to the blond-haired boy. Draco turned to face him, his face flushed with unamusement. "Hey, what're you up to? Wanna-" he bent over to catch his breath "-wanna talk?"
Professor Wilson had said he didn’t have a lesson planned, as usually Muggle teachers apparently didn’t give lessons the first day of school. Draco had found it rather weird when he’d heard the man say that they could ask him questions about strange Muggle objects they’d heard of, because surely that wouldn’t take much time at all. But Merlin’s beard, they’d used up the entire block and didn’t even make a dent in the questions the others threw at him.
In fact, that was one of the few similarities with the two boys. Both of their two childhood friends grew up to date each other after Hogwarts. Actually, Hermione and Ron just recently got married.
He’d fallen asleep.
Besides, allowing himself to complete assignments would force his body into accommodating another schedule, and he had no interest in doing such things. The only thing that appeased him was the idea of making it to the next chapter in his book, and perhaps getting another tea once he was done. He hadn’t been hungry in over twelve hours, and he was hoping to keep that record. He knew that tomorrow morning, the first of November, Hermione would drag him from his bed and force him to eat. Then force him to take his classes, finish his work, and go back to normal.
Neville, who usually wasn’t one for conflict in general, had gratefully reentered the conversation, but Draco didn’t find it that easy. As subtle as possible, he kept his eyes on Potter’s movements, wondering what could  have possibly compelled the usually upbeat boy to be so sullen and angry. Hermione and Neville began to talk loudly again, seeming to forget about Potter’s sour mood for the moment; and in an attempt to seem present, Draco nodded his head along with their words, occasionally muttering a “Brilliant!” here and three to sell the deception.
"Draco? Something I said?" He shook his head and placed the biscuits and tea on the table before sitting down himself. "Draco, considering going, and actually going, are two entirely different things. You wouldn't be... You wouldn't really even be a Slytherin if you do this. You're already living with Harry Potter. Is that not enough?"
Hermione had insisted Draco stay the rest of the weekend in the hospital wing, completely isolated from all people besides her and the occasional Neville Longbottom or Luna Lovegood. He’d subjected himself to stiff and rather infrequent bursts of sleep and awkward-to-write-in positions as he completed assignment after assignment. Overall, he supposed it wasn’t too bad. He had plenty of time to complete his classwork, without distractions.
But now Potter was a new person, he looked as if he’d been visited by a dementor. All of the pleasantness had been sucked from his body, leaving only an angry carcass in its place.
you and I should spend some time together, because that's what we'll be doing in America."
"And you think a lot can change in a fifth of that time, Harry?" Draco asked, his voice was quiet, yet still accusative. "You think that because my mother took in your son, you think the two of us, " he gestured to them both, voice becoming softer with every word. "You think that you, Harry Potter, can forgiv- forget what happened in Hogwarts?" his monologue ended in an angry whisper, his gray eyes glared threateningly at Harry as if daring him to forgive his mistakes. But truly, inside, he was begging.
He was working himself up, and in the process, making himself late for class. He knew that, for whatever reason, Harry potter wasn’t as skilled at reading a room as Draco was, and because of that, most likely couldn't sense the tension that radiated off of Draco. And even if he could, he certainly couldn't blame him for trying the distraction because, over the course of several days, he’d sneakingly let on that he was always grateful for even the slightest distraction.
Clothes were
Draco so much, and he went out of his way to show him. To tell him. And the very idea that all of this..
Harry had yet to take his hand off of Draco’s boot, and though the warmth was subdued from the leather, it was still a good source of comfort. He shook his head, swallowing as he tried to force the words out again.
And when Draco noticed his overthinking and held Harry’s shaking hands in his steady ones, it always
“No, we met him towards the end of the year,” Ron’s voice was distant and thinking, and everyone shared a disgruntled look as they racked their brains for more answers as to why Harry Potter was acting like a petulant child.
. I was only worried for myself.”
Draco's mind wondered back to third year, year of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin. The only living relative that the boy in front of him had left, the man that might as well have been killed by Draco's own father.
. Why won’t you say it back?”
He remembered how Harry's face had fell when he didn't answer his question, when he walked away and kept on until he was sprinting in his own home. He remembered the faint, "Draco?" that had escaped the black-haired wizard's lips as he disappeared down the Malfoy Manor hallway.
to visit them, he
He hoped he would, he hoped Neville Longbottom tagged along, and beat him down. He hoped the duo, the entirety of the golden and silver trio perhaps, would perform every Unforgivable Curse on him until he passed from the pain. He hoped they got revenge on him for their fallen family. He hoped Ron Weasley personally hurt him, he hoped Ron blamed him for his brother's death. He hoped the little boy, Dennis Creevy, blamed him for Colin’s death.
Draco looked into Harry’s hands, which had been all but thrust into his face, and smiled a strange smile as he picked a small piece from the boys’ collection.
"Well, Neville would be Peter-"
Was this boy making fun or genuinely asking?
He didn’t stuff himself, he left room for dessert of course, but after said dessert, his stomach could literally hold nothing else. He hadn’t eaten so well in weeks, months even. He’d refused to eat almost everything when he was still at home, only giving into temptation after hours upon hours of stomach growling and nearly unbearable pains.
Those were ones Draco enjoyed more, and Harry was delighted when he realized that Draco was just as nerdy and easy to impress with silly factoids as Hermione Granger was.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I think, well. I think we might be our own version of my parents and their friends. I think, I think we might represent... what they could've been. What they could've done." He put his head down, waiting for the expected confusion that was bound to come from the two people in front of him.
After all, Draco didn't care. Right?
“I don’t know Harry.”
Right.
He lifted his fork and started eating while the rest of the room gained its volume back. Everyone took turns eating and talking. Everyone except for Draco and Harry, for two separate reasons though.
Draco, ever confused, watched as all eyes fell on him.
“Well,
Draco looked away, taking a moment to think. The act itself was such a simple thing, but it was so complex, so controversial, so confusing. The action could cause detrimental changes, or simply bring a group of people closer. To see Harry Potter crying in front of so many people - so many that looked to him for guidance and structure, whether they be younger or older than him - was something Draco couldn’t determine. Was it powerful? A sign of trust? Was it a form of weakness, like Draco’s father had lectured him about so many times in his adolescence?
“I was just wondering if you were alright,” Harry said simply, and Draco noticed he’d taken to bouncing slightly on his feet. To Draco, it created an energy of always being alert, and he assumed it was a token of the war. A small and seemingly irrelevant outcome that he knew deep down was something that had the ability to drive Potter into a hole of constant worry.  But perhaps it was just a sign that Harry was wanting to go quickly to his class. Get his question answered and zip away, leaving Draco in a cloud of comforting dust.
"What's it to me? I don't care." Draco spoke with such honesty it made Harry's heart ache. Ignoring the stuttering and opened-mouth, messy haired boy before him, Draco continued. "You're The Boy Who Lived. You have friends all over the world." Harry shook his head slightly, but tried not to make it obvious.
Every time Harry would glance over at him, a shiver would erupt through his body. A window was directly in front of their seat so his grey eyes were especially beautiful. His blond hair was done before he stepped down the stairs, but a strand was out of place from when he sat down angrily.
"Do you think you're friends would be tolerate of me joining your traveling crusade to the states?" Draco asked with deep breaths between his words. Harry, who was already upset, rolled his eyes at the thought of Draco running up the stairs of the manor rather than just apparating like any normal wizard their age.
. The man had an eternity to live a long and happy life, but he'd succumbed to pain and suffering. It was hardly his fault, Sirius did nothing wrong besides being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
But overall, evenings and the time after was the easiest time to start a conversation with the stressed out blond. The evenings were when the common room was filled with tired witches and wizards who could hardly do anything more than fill the room with a low buzz as they conversated with one another. It was much different than the main house common rooms everyone had been used to. With loud first years and giggling fourth years and everyone in between, you could hardly find a quiet moment until the very late hours of the night.
His small corner of the room was just that, a small corner. And there were another nine beds in the room. The day before, he’d found a secret door that led to another room filled with beds. It was strange, having a second dorm room, but all too suddenly, the reality came crashing down. There were
“Oh. Erm, yes Professor.”
"You don't understand the things I did to him." he said, melancholy like, "not that your daft! You aren't, you are brilliant, Mother!"
, because he was far too weak and cowardly to do it by himself. He wished someone would compare him to his Aunt Bellatrix, his father even. He wished someone would say he was the pet of the Dark Lord. He wanted to see the looks on their faces when he agreed with every statement that spewed from their mouths.
agree that this year should be filled with games and fun and laughter, like you deserved.”
So his small hope of simply saying nothing and walking away from the curly-haired boy was immediately cast aside by the ever growing hatred of making people, even a person he once called his worst enemy, sad and left out.
to think about the boy every minute he could.
, he realized on Wednesday morning. He looked at his reflection in the mirror inside the boys bathroom.
Draco sighed, he and Luna had begun being friends nearly six months after the end of the war. She had been one of the only people to see him in public and not scowl at his mere presence. She began making small talk eventually, extremely small talk being as Draco didn't see the reason to befriend a person like Loony Lovegood.
-----
And he simply was not ready for such things.
“There are, yes.”
Harry Potter had too much of a hero complex, but Draco supposed in that moment, it was
Sitting through Muggle Studies wasn’t that difficult. The oldest person there, aside from him, was a seventh year Ravenclaw who thankfully didn’t recognize him. The other people were a mix of two bored second years who wanted to take an “interesting” class. A brother and sister, fourth and fifth year, who were being forced to take the class by their parents, who were probably wizard-born and probably afraid of confrontation. Everyone needed to be clear that they didn’t support the works of the Death Eaters and the Dark Lord.
Surely no one else would? Surely.
"You designed this after it?" He questioned. He assumed if he got Draco talking, they'd eventually get to his true reason of coming here.
“I’m not, but thank you for your efforts,” Draco tried, but he soon realized the conversation was being put on hold while Harry struggled to catch his breath.
"It'll do to get it off your chest, whatever it may be." Suddenly, a cup of tea appeared before Harry and he grabbed it, the warmth of it raised the temperature in his sweaty hands a noticeable amount.
He grabbed a spare key to his future apartment, because he was Harry Potter. His apartment was already ready to live in. He was prepared, after all, he was the son of Lily Evans, wasn't he?
"I don't know. Maybe one day I hope. As for now, no. I don't think any of could bear to see it open with... without
“Yes, Professor.” God, he was being terribly awkward, but he didn’t know what he could do about it. He gave his hands another shake before looking the Headmistress in her eyes, trying to show
Draco shrugged and reluctantly placed a smile onto his own face, not wanting to make the situation any more awkward than it already was.
“Excuse me, Potter. But I don’t really need you blithering Gryffindors in my business, it’s rather unpleasant.” Draco strained, beginning to turn on his heel.
The door immediately opened letting Draco know that his mother had her wand the entire time yet never used it. Maybe, Draco thought, maybe I've got some compassion in my blood after all.
"Pansy and Blaise, but I've been friends them. Luna got Ginny and Neville to come around. Now I'm friends with the 'Silver Trio!'" Draco said,  slowly allowing his voice to fill with excitement. "Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, along with Harry, were the Golden Trio of Gryffindor."
"As always, Harry dear, I'm fine and well. Teddy however..." her voice trailed off as she looked up at the ceiling in the direction of Teddy's bedroom.
“Of course not,
He nodded his head, not quite ready to speak. He placed a hand over his left side, where his book was, as if that would give him some sort of relief. It didn’t of course, what relief could a
“But it’s Sirius’ birthday.” It felt like Draco was going off topic, and Harry wanted to scream because he thought Malfoy wasn’t taking him seriously, but he was too tired to even consider the possibility.
So is that why he couldn’t go through with the words?
He’d gotten quite the tan over the summer, something he could honestly say had never happened before. He spent so much time reading in the sun, that his face and arms weren’t the pale color he was known for. They weren’t overly dark, but the change was noticeable. And noticeable was good in situations like this.
“Seems Halloween was shit for the both of us,” Draco said softly.
"She has a prankster for a brother, a dragon-handler for another, and this list goes on. And on! One peep out of her red-haired piper and I'm dead." Draco said, sitting down once again at Luna's disapproving tone.
You're a muggle-born, you are."
The young witches and wizards that filled the castle every year were back, unsuspecting of poor, sleepy-eyed Draco Malfoy. His hair was atrocious and one side of his face was flat, while the other was puffy.
. He knew that didn’t make sense, he knew he’d basically just contradicted himself, but it was the only way he could describe his feelings. It was fair, but it wasn’t.
The observations weren't helping his situation, they weren't making his question any easier to ask. Why was it this way?
Not since father left the Manor.
"Right," Harry repeated. "If you aren't too busy, I'm quite bored stuck here. Could I maybe accom-"
So he was right in walking away, right in ending the conversation before things got out of hand. He was always looking at the bigger picture. If he were to snap at Harry, which was definitely in option in the next few seconds, he’d appear to be the bad guy that had sworn at the recent victor of war. But if he turned away, and went to class, well, he’d simply look like a student on his way to start his school day.
“I hope you find
"It is a theory, but magic. It does work in mysterious ways."
He hoped they all blamed him.
“Young Mr. Malfoy.” Draco groaned at the voice.
“Yes, Professor.”
I'm sorry, but it needed to happen
"We were children."
“It’s my fault he’s dead.”
"Whatever. What's wrong with you anyway?" Draco stared at Harry, looking him up and down in attempt to figure out the situation by himself. "You're louder than this."
Hai, thank you for reading!!
"Good."
He ripped away the brown paper to reveal a note with scribbled lettering and beneath it, muggle clothing. The letter was addressed to him from Hagrid, and he smiled at the thought of knowing the half-giant thinking of him.
“Have you never seen them before?” And there was confusion in Draco’s voice, as if he
Why was every horrible memory he had riddled with screams? Screams so torturous and so inhumane they filled every inch of his brain with thoughts of ending it all, just for them to stop. Why was he like this? Was it selfish of him to wish they’d go away, or did it make him seem sane? Was this the price of saving the only place he’d ever felt at home? Screams from the only parental figures he’d ever known? And if he were to say out loud that he wished these screams didn’t rattle around in his head, or rather, if he could simply pluck them from existence, would he be cruel? What is one boy’s family to thousands of other families? Who was he to think he deserved anything other than those screams?
Draco met him as the garage opened up, and Harry tried his best to plaster on his best smile. Draco looked at him, and his face was questioning and stern. He didn’t like secrets. To Draco, secrets rarely brought along good things. To Draco, secrets were the very least perfect thing in the entire world.
"Well it," Draco began, with a small amount of happiness in his voice. Subtle yes, but it was there. (Although it went completely unbeknownst to Harry.) "Well, I was just-" and he sighed, realizing that Harry wanted nothing to do with him, and if Potter wanted nothing to do with him, why would any of the boys friends?
questions. When class was dismissed, he found himself back up at Professor Wilson’s desk. He tried, he really did, to not let the thousands of questions roll off his tongue, but he failed miserably. He only found himself able to stop when the wizard held up a hand to silence him.
He tried to focus on the people and conversations surrounding him, but intruding thoughts of hateful family members and reckless blame took over and his mind continued to zone out. It had seemed like things would turn up, now that the worst of the year was behind him. Now that his father was safely locked away in Azkaban, and his Aunt Bellatrix was dead, and his godfather had died a heroic death he didn’t deserve. Now that his mother was out of the picture, with some bedridding illness that he wanted to believe was a publicity stunt for the rest of the world to pity her, though in the back of his mind he knew his mother would never do such a thing. But he knew that such hope was incorrect, because nothing could truly ever be better for Draco. He had dug his grave before he could even realize what he was doing wrong, his desperate hope to impress a man that could hardly protect his family from harm getting in the way of seeing things clearly.
“Thanks,” he said shortly and walked as quickly as he could away from her. He thought to sit at the end of the table, but thought it might draw too much attention. He certainly couldn’t sit in the middle. The end closest to the professors seemed too risky, so he decided on a spot in the middle of the center and the end, on the side closest to the exit.
"You foul, loathsome, evil, little cockroach!" She had said, then a wand was against his neck, his back against a boulder. Then she was off of him and he should have been grateful. He should've thanked his lucky stars that he was alive because Hermione Granger would have killed him if she truly wanted to. That was what happened when you were the smartest witch of the grade. But no. He laughed.
Draco gets to see everyone and feels hella guilty
"Go! Go get Cissa!" Pansy stared at him, tears running down her cheeks. "Now!" She sprinted away without a word.
“Implying something, Malfoy?”
He stuffed his mouth full of food, not bothering to slow down. No one was there to watch him, no one was there to judge his every move. He could eat as fast as he wanted, he could eat as much as he wanted as well. He thought that, going by the previous logic, he could also eat as slowly as he needed to. However, everytime he tried, his anxiety had a wonderful way of making it sound as though hundreds of kids were seconds from bursting into the hall, and suddenly his moves sped up once again.
Saturday morning, however, was when things officially set into motion. Harry Potter, ever obnoxious and in someone’s business, had made sure to wake up bright and early and waltz himself down the stairs to stand right in front of Draco’s designated sleeping spot. It seemed he was quite interested in why Draco Lucius Malfoy, the purest pureblood he claimed to have ever met, was so intrigued in reading Muggle classics by starlight. Draco had stared at him for a good few moments, wondering what had come over him that he thought it acceptable to wake Draco out of his slumber to ask such questions, before answering in reluctant earnestness.
“And Sirius is graveless.”
Nevertheless, he didn’t say anything. Better to not dwell on the happenings of previous years, of previous Octobers. Better to focus on the now, and on getting better, being a better and more empathetic member of society. Better to focus on being seen as
"I was a horrid little..." Ferret, his mind thought to say. He silently cussed his own conscious out before continuing. "Git, mother. The terrible, awful things I did to him."
"I see."
His legs were crossed into each other, his arms held one another. His face was going numb, he couldn't feel it. He couldn't move his legs, his feet, his toes. His arms were stuck together, holding hand in hand, each finger curled into another.
“As are you,” Harry said. He didn’t have a smirk across his face, but it still made Draco want to throw a quick fist.
care anymore.
Another turn came, but rather than a light, the flat Harry shared with Draco came into view. He could see the boy in his gardening clothes sitting on the porch, reading a book in the wooden swing Harry had constructed for Draco’s birthday. He gulped and squeezed to wheel even tighter.
Friendships have always been difficult for Draco, but with the way things are now, they're a whole lot harder. Besides, does he even deserve friendship, after everything he's done?
, which for Draco, at that time, was all the more reason to dislike him.
"Harry! Harry, you're gay!"
"Well, so would my other brothers, it wouldn't be fair to exclude them."
"Then what's in the case?" Neville questioned. The others stared in curiosity.
Friends.

It was crazy that he was wanting to ask now, nearly six months after Harry first said it, but he supposed better late than never.
Hi again! I really hope you enjoyed it, seeing as I stupidly used the month, going on two months, break for it. I wish I could say that in the nearly five or six weeks I was gone, I took the time to write out many chapters, and that they only needed some editing, but unfortunately I cannot. Instead, I spent every single moment editing and reediting in fear that this wouldn't be good enough to publish. By the time I felt confident enough to move on with a scene and go to another one, something came up and my anxiety would kick in like nothing before. But, finals are over, I'm getting a decent break, and I'll be returning to my classes in-person in January. All of the things playing into my anxiety are slowly trickling away, and I couldn't be happier. Please let me know what you think, and I do hope you enjoyed everything.
November third was a day of pain rather than longing, or better yet, a sort of longing that ached so deep into your soul that it began to damage your physical self as well.
hurt in unimaginable ways.
Draco remembered how one of the half-bloods had begun to cry in their first year when Halloween came around, and she didn’t get to go trick-or-treating. Her feelings cheered tremendously when the feast came, and though it had been spoiled rather soon, it had definitely been quite a memorable one. He remembered wanting to write his father a letter on if he could be taken out of school the next Halloween, to go trick-or-treating with Pansy and Crabbe and Goyle and Blaise, but he thought better of it and decided not to. Lucius was always rather terrifying when it came to anything October related, and he had no interest in getting a howler sent to him.
He didn’t think they’d cast him aside, Professor McGonagall had promised no judgment from any staff members, promised that his slate was wiped clean. Of course, he knew that wasn’t entirely true, there was bound to be heaps of prejudice against him from a number of different sources, that he expected. He was just
Draco sneered and his eyes squinted at the person in his kitchen. How dare she?
The Slytherin table was less full for sure, but there were still smiling faces sitting around it. They seemed so calm. Unbothered by the pressure of being at school. It occurred to him that maybe they had no reason to be pressured. That it was a lie that all Slytherins were evil. That someone could happily live a Slytheirn life, have friends that they could talk to during the summers, have family that didn’t judge their every waking move. It occurred to him that not every Slytheirn witch or wizard had the unfortunate life of a Malfoy, of a pure-blood.
“You wouldn’t happen to know what you’d like for classes this year, would you?”
-----
Harry Potter was a difficult man to find when he was truly trying, which made perfect sense in Draco’s mind, seeing as their entire lives there was a power-hungry excuse of a man searching high and low for Harry  and a chance for revenge.
Blaise Zabini was in the manor.
"H-harry?" Draco walked toward the door, unsure if he was about to close it in his face or invite him in, or something totally opposite of both.
"No, no. We aren't. I shouldn't have said couples. We're only going to share a room. In a hotel. In America. For the long weekend." Harry insisted.
"Yeah, Potter. Pansy. From school." She through the paper. Down at her feet. Harry relaxed, maybe she wouldn't kill him.
"That's smart, I should have thought of it!" Hermione exclaimed, a big smile on her face. Draco hoped it was sincere but a low voice in his head said it was out of pity. He returned a half-hearted grin back to her.
Draco, who couldn't bring himself to utter anymore stuttering words, simply nodded his head and moved out of the door frame. Harry stepped in and thanked him. He looked around the clean room and smiled. The walls were green, Draco noticed self-consciously. A dark emerald green for his house. The trinkets on his desk were childish and definitely not fit for the son of a death eater.
"You'd essentially be betraying Slytherin if you went with them, you
He sighed and focused his attention back onto the professor, not wanting to be caught off guard and get himself noticed too early on. No one was looking behind them, trying to play “Find The Malfoy,” and he wanted to keep it that way.
“Well, I have. I’m practically Muggleborn, remember? I had to experience Muggle life for nearly 17 years.”
Harry and Hermione looked at each other and seemed to share the same thoughts: "I guess he really isn't a bloody idiot."
Draco was in fact starved from not eating for at least 24 hours, while Harry sat there in amazement that Draco was there. He hadn't thought he would come in a million years.
go." Blaise crossed his arms and sat down in a dining chair as he watched Draco prepare tea and biscuits that were made by Narcissa earlier that morning.
Harry was steadily scarfing down his food, only stopping for a drink every so often. Ron ate as well, but he didn’t bother joining any conversations, seeming to have decided it was better to keep an eye on his best friend instead.
Draco found himself feeling a bit sorry for Harry, because as much as the month of October had brought him fear and pain, it had given Harry life without a family, and that seemed just a bit worse.
By Wednesday, Draco was starting to think that maybe - just maybe - his sleep schedule was finally getting back on track. No longer did he wake up drowning in puddles of sweat and shivering as if he’d apparated to the North Pole in nothing but his underpants. No longer was he shaken awake by frantic whispers from Hermione Granger telling him that he was calling out names she’d never heard of, and if he didn’t stop he’d soon wake the entirety of the common room.
“Unfortunately,” Draco thought that was a  rather off putting answer, but nevertheless, he picked up his book and placed it on his lap, looking up at Potter with interest. If he’d at least read them, well, that was enough for Draco. “That one, no. Though I’ve heard Mr. Darcy was quite the prick.”
"No. Father, no! I'd never do anything to earn your distrust. I swear it."
to interrupt, but Professor Wilson had said ‘books’ with an ‘s’ which meant there
“Of course.” Draco gave a small smile. That was probably the best news he’d heard in his life. He was beginning to love these
him. Pansy was all he had left, he couldn’t do that.
He didn’t say that either. “He was muggle-born, he knew so much about them already.” And the Professor understood, understood that the little boy that hadn’t even been able to apparate successfully yet was
(See the end of the chapter for
"Not early enough it seems. Breakfast was over ages ago!" Harry stretched out his words dramatically. "Crikey, even Teddy's asleep."
“Are there more?” he hadn’t
Harry rolled his eyes at the two idiots in front of him. Just like old times, they were bickering left and right, leaving him to be the third wheel. Only now, he truly was the third wheel as Ron and Hermione had begun dating after the Battle.
During the days before September 1st, Draco Malfoy had occupied much of his time doing the most simplicit of things. He’d never truly had the satisfaction of doing
from the hand that probably didn’t mean any harm. But when you’d grown up with murderers running in and out of your childhood home, it slowly began harder and harder to tell over time. “Minerva said you had a rather splendid surprise to show me?” Draco gave him a confused look. He most certainly did not. “A book, I believe was what she said.”
"Now what is this, Ms. Black?" Narcissa made a face, her voice getting a bit louder now that she wasn't within inches from an exhausting baby. "Are you alright, truly?"
however, as a birthday gift from me to you, i will be posting a special list of "Weird" Things That Draco Malfoy Does Now That He's Trying To Change on November 15th. Thank you for your kind comments and messages whether through tumblr or comments. they mean so much to me!
Potter.
"People are busy, people have boyfriends and girlfriends that they want to spend time with," he stated simply, taking a standing spot in front of Draco's seated position.
“No you wouldn’t,” Draco said with a bit less enthusiasm than before, hoping this conversation wouldn’t take a turn for the worst. When purebloods were mentioned, offensive and cruel things came from the mouths of those who were speaking on them. That was just the way things were, the talk of the times. Draco didn’t think
After all of the love that he bestowed upon Draco, all the care and gentleness and adoration he so willingly granted his boyfriend, did he
"I'll, I'll call, someone. St. Mungo's perhaps." She said distressed. She apparated god knows where and Harry turned his attention back to Draco.
Instead, the messy haired teen slid into his own chambers and readied himself for sleep. Trying hard not to think about whimpering Teddy or indecisive Draco, he was happy to hear pecking at his window.
“And I’m sure your parents were rather cross when that happened, because Voldemort was just getting big, wasn’t he?” Draco nodded tentatively, but realized Harry couldn’t see him and tried to let out a verbal answer. All he could do was sputter out a choppy “I suppose,” - which wasn’t even meant to be funny, especially with the topic of conversation - and wait as his cheeks heated up uncomfortably.
peace here, Mr. Malfoy.” There goes that blasted name again. It felt to Draco that McGonnagall was purposefully throwing it out, as a reminder of just how weak and helpless he truly was. “I know you may find that strange, but I don’t wish pain on any of my students.”
Perhaps he was being a bit dramatic, perhaps wanting, longing for, craving death wasn’t the proper way to go about things. Perhaps owning up to his mistakes, and staying around long enough to see the change they brought was a better thing. But he was tired, he was hurt, and he truly just wanted to be gone.
"I've just got a letter. Sent by Hermione and Ron. I've only visited them last week, but Hermione's been insisting like crazy.
“Because you let Hermione Granger do all of your work?” Draco bit back a smirk and waited patiently for Harry’s response. Of course, perfect little Potter had never moved a finger to do his work. It was just like him.
“Come in, come in. Make yourself at home,” The man made way for Draco to fit through the door. The inside of the classroom was rather
before, and he was ecstatic to finally have the opportunity to search for something to do.
“I love you
He heard Draco Malfoy shift and he quietly questioned this arrangement. What had happened in the short months since the war that caused this situation to be a possibility? He worried that perhaps it had been his hero complex trying to befriend Draco, if only to give the wizard the benefit of the doubt. Harry knew that outside of Hogwarts, Draco would have tremendous difficulty doing anything without being the target for a lot of hatred. Was he still trying to be the bigger man, subconsciously? Or had it truly been an act of friendship? He hoped the latter was true, because the idea of still trying to help everyone but himself, even after his literal death, was beginning to disgust him.
"Ron, you're a pure-blood!"
In short, he looked like a fool.
"Maybe you could go with me?" Harry was understandably out of breath by the time his confusing sppech was over and Draco stood across from him, quite confused. He glanced at his mother.
"Sit." Hermione said, the same scary whisper still flowing form her lips. As angry as she seemed, she still brought him some tea and pumpkin juice, a plate and some silverware and allowed Harry to dig into the food in front if him and Ron.
"And then," Draco said dramatically, "he said: 'We were children.'" He stuffed an entire  chocolate frog into his thin-lipped mouth before guzzling down so pumpkin juice.
“It’s been a day, Potter.”
to boss him around after he acquired his dark mark. But it truly did hurt when he’d heard of his death, and for that, he gave a moment of silence.
He also planned on getting them all phones, or puppies, or both. He didn't exactly know just yet but he knew he definitely wanted to do that.
“That didn’t really sound like you’re fine.”
Draco was finding it unbelievably difficult to figure out what to do in the situation, aside from darting to the dorm rooms and diving into his bed, pulling the curtains and hoping no one noticed the bed in the corner.
"And at the most?" He asked, keeping the talking to Harry and the eating of sweets to himself. He saw Harry eye his stash a few times since the beginning of the conversation and hoped he wouldn't ask, because he definitely wasn't ready to share.
“I suppose.”
"Mother, my brain is too tired to even begin to comprehend what you've just said, but it sounded nice, so I might replay it a little later, when it isn't nine o'clock in the morning." Draco kissed his mother's forehead before standing up and picking up his wand from his bedside table. With a quiet
“Cheer up, Potter,” he managed to mutter after a while, and he hoped that the far from sweet tone in his voice was enough to suck Potter out of his depressive  hole, though deep down he knew that it was not.
The lounge area at the front of his room, bean bags and blankets, were clean, yes. But there were games, both muggle and wizard like. A stash of candy laid in a wicker basket. How very stupid he was to not take the time to put away his childlike possessions. How stupid of him to even have them past adolescence! He was an adult after all. Much to old for such things.
He sat forward contently, leaning his arms to rest on the table before him, and waited around for the remainder of Hogwarts students to finish their own food, which happened rather quickly after he did. Satisfied sighs and half-hearted shouts filled the silence until McGonagall cleared her throat and gathered their attention once again.
“What is it, Potter?” Draco attempted a sneer, but it was a bust. He was already too distracted to have the energy to sneer at anyone. It was the middle of October and he was worn down from the constant stress of assignments and exams and memories that threatened to emerge at any given moment. He could quite honestly say that he was in no mood to conversate with anyone, in fact, he was in no mood to even lift a finger. He was so overcome with stress that even his fascinating Muggle books that filled him with seemingly endless joy weren’t enough to lift his spirits.
"You idiot!" She said under her breath. "I haven't seen Malfoy recently and even I can tell what happened. It was an anxiety attack, by the sounds of it."
“Bloody hell, Malfoy!”
. Draco wasn’t finding his consistent happiness
In the photos he had of his parents, he found whenever his father was upset with him in real life, he’d walk away in the photo and Draco wouldn’t be able to see the happy smile that was usually there. He thought that if he’d had a muggle photo of his father, maybe he’d remember what his father looked like when he was happy. It’d been so very long since any of the Malfoy’s got the luxury to smile.
Harry smiled with her as he too thought of his godson. And honestly, how amazing is it to have a godson in his life, yet not have to constantly care for him. Harry was able to live his life freely.
“That’s okay,” Draco heard Harry say, though it echoed through his mind for a bit before reaching him fully. “It’s okay to not be okay.”
“We heard what happened. We heard about everything.” What was everything? Who was we? He wished he understood, but at the same time, he was glad he didn't. Whatever she knew, it was about him. Something had happened concerning him and he couldn’t be bothered with it. He wasn’t prepared mentally to take in any extra besides school related topics.
, Draco.”
But Draco was here, and he was going to listen to Harry.
And thus started the Sorting. The infamous Sorting Hat sat on it’s slightly less infamous, but still well known stool, and began singing its song of comraderence and bonding. He’d never been able to admit it before, because he’d always been a stuck up brat that only cared about himself, but he did quite enjoy the simple songs of House Unity that came from the animate object.
He wanted to imagine that he strutted over to his bedroom door, back straight, shoulders back, nose in the air, but he just couldn't. He knew that he had tiptoed over to the door in hoped that Potter would think that he'd gone along with his mother. In hopes that he would leave him alone to sob in his bedroom chambers.
"Wha-wha the fu-?" He spluttered out, desperate for just a bit of air.
He could only imagine the pain the others felt. The Weasley’s for example, who’d lost
professor who seems quite skilled I suppose. Of course, she’s not as good as your late godfather, as much as I hate to admit it.” Draco scratched his nose and looked down, waiting for the topic of conversation to change.
“It’s alright, Potter.”
was in fact the wizard’s next victim.
peaked Draco’s interest. A Muggle classroom was something he’d never really gotten the privilege to see, being a Wizard kid. He was sure some of the half-bloods or muggle-borns had been able to have such experiences, but he’d never really
"Yeah? That's great!" Neville said, his voice not at all filled with judgment or resentfulness. "And how's Harry? I haven't heard from him in months."
His hands shook as he read the prompts off the cards, his voice was a quivering mess, and best of all: his mother was not in the house.
Harry nodded, mug shaking in his hand as he took a hesitant sip. "Perfect as always, Aunt Cissa."
When he was sure there was no one else would come out, he opened the door quickly and flew into the room. He caught his breath and sighed in relief.
coming?" Harry and Draco sat across from each other at the rather large dining table in the Malfoy Manor. Teddy sat next to Harry, feeding himself so porridge and babbling about nonsense that neither teen understood. Harry had on casual black robes with a Gryffindor scarf to protect himself from the cold. His hair was a right mess, per usual, and his glasses stood on the tip of his nose.
And also, Harry was petty as fuck. Anyone would agree. Dead Sirius would raise a glass to that in his grave, if he had one.
A woman's job is to serve. A favorite line of Lucius Malfoy's.
“And I’m the one who stopped Voldemort, a
Silence filled the room.
Draco was silent for a moment, but eventually he nodded and reached over, taking a piece of pumpkin pasties. He bit into it, and smiled. He supposed it was alright.
"You have three other brothers, one could pair with Harry and the other two would be fine."
Ron frowned. “Nah, it’s alright. I’ll see you later.”
“I still can’t help but feel horrible. He suffers too quietly and explains away things too easily.”
The Weasley matriarch laughed at that. “Too right, you are.”
Despite the fancy digs, Harry looked paler than usual and had deep circles under his eyes, otherwise looking unharmed. His arms were still bandaged up, but it seemed as though that were just a precaution in case the bleeding began again. He was in a hospital gown that looked way to large for him, curled up on a sofa with a cup of tea in his hands, overgrown hair covering his face. He looked up at his father when he entered the room and visibly winced.
Draco stood at this, feeling immediately dizzy. "No way. Nope. I'm not getting weirder than this. Thanks, I'll risk it with the Wolfsbane." He made to leave but he swayed in his spot. Remus was by his side almost immediately, gingerly sitting him back down.
Harry’s scars on his arms were now prominent, having finally been able to receive the magical intervention he needed for the bleeding to stop. Harry had crawled into Draco’s bed late one night to show him, knowing that Draco was well enough now to handle shifting to let him in without causing pain. Draco could tell that Harry was very self-conscious about the milky white lines that ran top to bottom on his inner forearms, even if they weren’t very noticeable against his pale complexion. Draco only traced them gently with his fingers and smiled at Harry. “You match me now,” he said, trying to ease the tension.
Draco let out a breathy laugh. “Me too. Let’s wait until we’re both stitched back together to try that again, yeah?”
“I was trying to keep my family safe! I didn’t know if you were aligning with your father or not.”
“I’m scared he’s already in too deep.”
“I’d never let that happen,” she replied. “I just wish it was under better circumstances.”
Ron looked to Harry as Sirius disappeared to the other House’s tables. “Bad night, then?”
“I’ll go check on him,” Ron said, disappearing after Harry before anyone could raise an objection.
Draco pushed past his godfather who obviously didn’t know what to do with the situation and pulled Harry into his arms and off of the sill. He refused to admit to himself how nice it felt after a few weeks of little to no contact with the Black Heir and focused on calming him down instead. “Hey, it’s okay. I’m here. It’s alright.” Harry, terrified and wild, dissolved into sobs as he buried his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, the flames growing larger. “I got you,” Draco murmured against unruly hair, rubbing circles into Harry’s back. He looked at Snape. “What did you do?”
Harry nodded, trying to ignore the dormant wolf suddenly inside of him
"Ah," the blonde responded, "now you're speaking Slytherin." Harry's eyes snapped open and they settled on Draco with a glare. He raised his hands in defense. "I'm not saying that's a bad thing, Potter. Snake in residence here, remember? It's okay to be selfish with your feelings sometime. You just lost someone – really lost someone. It's okay to not be okay. Nobody should force you into not owning that." Harry's glare turned into something more of confusion. Draco realized he just genuinely gave Saint Potter advice and shook his head to snap out of it. "I'm going to go eat before this gets any weirder," he said, leaving the room and the puzzled Boy Who Lived behind.
Harry looked up at him as if noticing his presence for the first time. “Hi,” he responded, then dissolved into giggles, “don’t I know you from somewhere?”
“Even better, you can leave tomorrow—clean bill of health.”
“Where were you two?” he demanded. They had got to stop doing this to the poor man, Draco thought. He looked a bit crazed as he stared the two down.
Draco dragged his hand down his face as he said, “Ginny told me to burn them. Why is she always right?”
When they began to leave for their Prefects meeting Harry recalled his actions over the summer, trying not to fuss too badly about it. He needed to learn to school his emotions—his new power acted like accidental magic, causing mayhem every time he became too upset. He couldn’t have that occurring at school. When he saw Blaise he almost lost it.
They were silent for a bit after that. “I’m not used to this—having a Dad,” Harry admitted. Sirius felt panicked for a moment, worried that he was already overstepping. “It’s nice.”
“Will Mum be there as well?”
Draco suddenly looked up from his own mug, ready to hear about the aftermath. “Blaise?” was the first question out of his mouth, silently ashamed that he didn’t ask about Harry.
“We can’t know for sure unless you indulge me in a little experiment.” He rummaged through his bag pulling out a familiar potion bottle.
Hearing Harry sniffling on the balcony the night prior to leaving had Draco’s mind made up about the one thing he could actually do for Remus and Harry but he had to make sure he had access. When everyone was finally asleep that night, he crept into the tapestry room, taking special care to miss any creaky floorboards or bumping into creature. He looked at the familiar fireplace with determination, gripping his wand in bunched nerves.
“A horcrux?”
Draco let out a shaky laugh against Harry’s chest and let himself be held. Maybe everything would be alright after all. “Last night was brilliant, by the way,” Harry continued. “You did such a wonderful thing for everyone. Even Nott was smiling and not being an arsehole.”
“Black Manor,” Draco explained. He took his hand. “Come on.”
Draco tried to catch his attention on the way out. Just because he screwed up doesn’t mean Harry deserved the cold shoulder. “You okay?” he asked as they headed towards Transfiguration.
She replaced a bag that Draco just noticed was attached to him. He looked at his free hand and saw a needle inserted. “What’s with the Muggle tech?”
“You didn’t do anything: I just wanted to talk.”
“Do you have any patience?” he heard a very familiar voice drawl out. “I was all the way across the garden for Merlin’s sake.” There he was. Looking very much like his nephew, albeit with neater hair, Regulus Black was approaching him, a bit shiny around the edges but looking quite human and quite alive and quite young. It knocked the breath out of Draco—he forgot how low the veil was here.
“You never know—you have more of it in you than the first time I reckon.”
“Uncle Sev, please,” Draco pushed, not caring that they were in school and he wasn’t to call his godfather by that name here. Harry’s tornado was quieting down slowly as he continued to sob into the blonde’s arms. What a mess this was.
The looks lingered until Dumbledore began speaking again. “A new rule this year is for our Prefects,” he said. “To better aid our school, all Prefects Sixth Year and above will be asked to use only the Prefects’ dorm for their sleeping quarters. If there is an emergency during the night, we will be better able to reach you this way. There will be a special way to access these from your respective Common Rooms.’
When the day arrived, Harry was feeling very anxious. He was sitting out on the balcony for most likely the last time, Sirius probably wanting his room back when he came. He wasn’t smoking, which to him was quite a bit of progress from before he was in the hospital, even if he was itching for one. He was just letting the crisp London air fill his lungs, though, snow falling softly around. Draco found him there around mid-morning.
Harry laughed, thinking about a menacing figure like Fenrir discussing something as intimate as marking with Draco. He must have been mortified. “Have you thought about marking me?” he asked, to which Draco tensed up again looking around wildly. “Nobody is around, Draco. Don’t get your knickers in a twist.”
Draco had forgotten that tidbit. “I’m just worried that he’s going to go deeper into himself. He’s taking it really hard.” There was that look again. “What?”
Harry’s head was spinning trying to process this new information. He couldn’t be suggesting what Harry thought he was. “What are you trying to say?”
Draco repressed the urge to snort in response. “I thought you were a Gryffindor,” he bit back.
Remus frowned. “Scratching his hands?” The Healers had warned him to watch out for new tics—this seemed to be one of them.
Draco. I don’t need a Healer. I’m going to work on it on my own. Besides, Madame Pomfrey probably wouldn’t let me leave without a dampner and I don’t want that. It’ll make me feel all foggy.” Draco frowned. “Would you stop worrying? It’s going to be alright. I’ve got you don’t I?”
Harry laughed again. “I noticed. You’ll barely sit next to me when other people are around.”
Harry was frowning. “You need to work on that whole martyr thing, you know,” he commented.
“This might be advantageous for you,” Draco supplied, trying to brighten the mood a bit. “Nobody knows what you look like right now. That means You-Know-Who doesn’t either. You can go out to London and enjoy anonymity for awhile.”
There was a long silence. Then: “Please don’t freak out,” in a small voice.
Draco nodded in understanding. “I think you were here, then.”
Bill squeezed his shoulder in comfort and Harry latched on to the feeling, trying to stop the panic bubbling out of him. “He’s there to help with his transformation issue he’s been having. Fenrir said the halfling status was slowly killing him so he had to reopen the bite—he’s alright, he’s with Jack. He’s safe.”
Draco looked down. Was he ready for that? “I’ll think about it.”
Seamus turned to rummage in his trunk, pulling out a bottle of Firewhiskey. “We have time.”
He woke up to arguing the next time. He didn’t open his eyes or make any motion that he was awake again, even though his limbs were crying out in agony. His pain potions must have worn off. His father and what sounded like Remus seemed to be having it out.
“I was five,” Remus supplied. Draco looked ill.
“I need to tell him I’m sorry for everything—the leaving, the tantrums—everything.”
Remus’s explanation quelled some of Harry’s nerves. “So the wolf isn’t forcing Draco to like me?”
Sirius raised his hand in defense. “I’m just telling you what works for me. Besides, we can’t very well get a mind healer in here, can we?”
Draco scrunched his nose in disdain. The first war seemed more complex than what history books or his parents allowed. “Maybe you were all Confunded,” he suggested.
dealing with that so it isn’t a lie. You can tell who you want discreetly, but this would be a good cover for the rest of the world.”
Draco jumped at the sudden intrusion and looked up. It was Blaise. “Don’t scare me like that!” Draco replied. “I thought you were one of the others.”
James shrugged. “It must be a glitch of some sort, yeah?”
Draco began to get his bearings and shift out of the foggy, half-asleep state he was in. “How are you at Hogwarts? Death Eaters can’t get in,” he said, reaching a hand up to massage his throat gently. His voice was coming out so creaky. He hated sounding so weak.
“And is there some secret therapist in the Forest of Dean we need to know about?” they both jumped at Draco in the doorway. “Haven’t heard you respond this maturely since
Sirius rubbed his face tiredly. This new war seemed to be even more high stakes and terrifying than the previous one. It was almost too much to think about on his first day back. “That’s awful.”
“I meant for Harry.”
“Your sacrifices throughout your very short life were not without witness. You have been blessed.”
As if Merlin were against him, Harry took that moment to saunter over and plop down unceremoniously next to Draco. “This. Is. Fun.” He said, punctuating each word as though trying not to slur. He eyed Draco’s drink. “What’s that then?”
Draco gave a slight nod. “Okay,” he breathed.
“Could say the same for you.”
When the wedding arrived, the Ministry fell. Harry, Ron, and Hermione disapparated in the fallout, leaving Draco behind. Draco was heartbroken, left tucked away in the Manor with Sirius and Remus: it was almost too much to bear. He couldn’t understand why they didn’t take him with them but there was nothing to do now but wait for Harry’s return. It was devastating. He resolved to spend his time studying defensive and battle spells with Remus and Sirius. When the time came, he would be ready.
“No.” It was a chorus of Remus, his mother, and Healer Markus combined.
“Just come off it, okay Blaise?” Draco said, not really wanting to interact at all, still stinging from their last conversation.
Remus raised an eyebrow. “That was a bit sudden – you alright?”
Sirius knocked. “Hey, it’s Sirius,” he voiced. “Can I come in.”
“Considering last week I wasn’t so sure,” Remus responded. “If you’re on Wolfsbane there is no need to return for the moon. We can relax in the attic instead.”
“He didn’t really outgrow that,” Draco said, thinking back to the last blowup.
Remus frowned. "The Wolfsbane isn't working as well as I wanted it to. Bill did a lot of his schooling studying this type of problem. I thought he could help."
“I’d doubt he’d show it in front of all of his followers. Father was at his beck and call, I suppose he still is. He was muttering a lot about Hogwarts, but I’m sure it had more to do with taking over the school than anything else. He let slip something about a cup?”
“What the bloody hell happened to you?”
“Aren’t I always?”
“I thought she was staying in France with her parents.”
Draco looked away, embarrassed. He didn’t fancy baring his love life to a professor, but the lines of mentorship and guardianship had become so blurred between the two of them that he gave up the ghost fairly quickly. “Blaise and I had been friends for a very long time. And then we weren’t.”
Draco reached for it with shaky hands. What would he see? He lifted it up to his face and drew in a breath. His left eye was perfect, mercurial silver but his right eye…His right eye was pitch black with no distinction between his pupil, iris, or cornea. Curious. “Oh.” He looked up at his mother and adoptive father, surprised to find he didn’t care nearly as much as he probably should. “I can see fine, though—how did this happen?”
“He’s okay but I haven’t seen him yet. I came home to get changed and go back. I hate to ask you this but is there any way you can get Draco today? They’re holding Harry in a long stay after he gets out of the trauma ward. He needs help. Draco grounds him better than anyone else.”
Draco pulled his hand away and rubbed his face in frustration and embarrassment. “You were so drunk I didn’t want to take advantage of you,” he explained. “Weasley has been pestering me for weeks about my feelings. I wouldn’t have been able to heal you the way I did if I didn’t have feelings for you.” He glanced at Harry when he didn’t say anything. “I’m sorry, I should’ve kept it to my—”. But Draco was cut off by Harry’s lips crashing into his.
“Do you think I can see Harry when we get back?” Draco asked as the two exited the village to Apparate back home. Sirius as the newly reinstated Lord Black was able to key the both of them into the wards of Black Manor, making the cumbersome stop at Grimmauld Place a thing of the past.
“He didn’t breathe until I pointed you out to him from the window,” Blaise interjected. “Do try not to disappear, Antares, especially given your attraction to danger.” The nickname reminded Harry of his rashness, and he felt bad about making Draco panic.
“Can we leave today?” Draco asked despite knowing the answer.
“Healer Abbott is coming today to check on your arm and your progress, alright?”
Draco sat back down slowly, suddenly feeling foolish. "Why did I just disclose that much information to Potter of all people?" He agonized. "Bloody fool can't keep his mouth shut."
“Please don’t apologize for saving the world and needing a rest, mate,” Seamus voiced with a laugh. “We just wanted to make sure you weren’t buried under some rubble.”
“I’m glad we’re in agreement on that.” Turner leaned back in his seat. “We’re looking at minimum at an intensive six week program.” He pulled out a file and pushed it towards Sirius, who began to read through it. He wondered if this is how his James’s parents felt after he had his own stay here all those years ago—the guilt welled up inside of him for putting his adoptive parents through that. “It’s difficult to say whether he’d hit the low he did without the cheering charms, but I want to conduct a full evaluation and move on to treatment from there. He would also benefit from Occlumency training and physio for his magic. He’s extremely powerful and has difficulty keeping it in check. If he calms his magic, his emotions may not be so volatile.”
“Good,” he said, closing his eyes, “because I’m so tired of hospital food.” His Healer laughed. The potion was making him overtalk again, he realized. “They should just use this instead of Veritaserum. Can’t keep my bloody mouth shut, can I?”
“Well that’s good news,” Remus said, relief colouring his tone of voice.
He winced at that. He’d really rather not be compared to his father, who was prickly at best and absolutely menacing and deranged at worst. He looked towards Harry as well, who was eyeing the pair with curiosity. He supposed if Harry was over the situation, he should let it go, too. “Sorry, Pans,” he said finally. “I didn’t provide the most pleasant of greetings, huh?”
“Too close. Glad you had the sense to get out of there.”
“Antares?” Malkin said, knowing full well Harry gave Harrison Black as his name.
Lucius smiled for the first time in what seemed like years. “I won’t let you down, I promise.”
She smiled. “Alive,
“You’re not going—not with all of this new rhetoric about blood traitors roaming about. Did you see they’re registering Muggleborns? How cruel.”
“Yes – let’s turn this birthday around shall we?”
“I suppose not. Never thought I’d think of Draco as non-evil,” Harry mused.
“You’re the savior of the wizarding world: of course they’re going to freak out if you go missing.”
“Even I have to agree with that,” Ron replied, “I’m not that fond of him but snakes can be cruel to those they think betrayed them. I wonder if Dumbledore will move him.” Draco’s eyes narrowed at this – they were obviously talking about him.
Draco’s expression went flat at the mention of Lucius. “What about him?”
“It’s not, though. I’m just waiting for my friends to join me, you know?” He leaned back into the bench, eyes closing in contemplation. “When I no longer have skin in the game, I’ll feel at ease. It’s hard not to feel nostalgic for life when your nephew is sitting next to you and you’re the same age as him
Draco spun to greet him. “You’re thinking of the old, bitter Draco—this one quite likes Bowie.” Taking the elder wolf in, he frowned. “You look tired, why don’t you sit down while we fix you something?”
Draco shrugged. “I honestly don’t know. I was so scared I would run into him during the Final Battle and when I didn’t, I was relieved. I don’t even know what I should say to him.”
Friends.
to go. I do." No one but his mother had really ever seen him as he was now. His hair was an absolute disaster, blond strands going every direction. He wore his underpants and a thin tank top only, goosebumps lined his arms and thighs.
"Nothing." Harry said, shaking his head as if to toss the idea of something being wrong out of the window.
He didn’t care anymore.
It hurt to think, hurt even more to know such a statement was so
"Talking with Pansy." Draco said shortly. It was no secret he was still good friends with Blaise and Pansy just as Harry was still close with Hermione and Ron.
"Parkinson?" Pansy retorted. "I'm more than a mere acquaintance to you Draco, I would assume. Or shall I call you Mr. Malfoy?"
“Was Remus already gone, underground? Did he celebrate completely alone, no one to remember anything with?”
Draco, who had whipped his head around so fast and hard at the sound of the only female Weasley's voice, was following her back in awe. Luna, however, had a gentle smile on her pale lips, and the spot on her forehead seemed to have begun radiating with pure... joy?
"I... I'm moving out!" It came as a yell. As if he was trying to hold it back for a long period of time.
was the question that left the mouth of The Chosen One. He held his breath for a moment, both in fear that he might say something sudden and abrupt and probably untrue and in deep thought as he decided how exactly to answer.
He supposed that if Professor Wilson was the only kind person to him, despite knowing about all of the horrible things he’d done, he’d be alright in school.
"I think you'd be Remus. You're the smartest of us all. You get us out of trouble, you found the loopholes for us. Just like Lupin did for my dad, for my godfather." Hermione smiled, much like she did in their sixth year, when Harry told Professor Slughorn she was the best in the year.
Shaking his head as if that simple motion would erase all thoughts of death and family members, he opened it to reveal a large, brown, barn owl with a not so reasonably sized package tied to his feet.
That didn’t make much sense in Draco’s opinion, seeing as his father had said things completely opposite of that phrase; but with Harry’s hand on his foot and the curve of the circular window outlined against his back, he couldn’t bring himself to care much. Besides, Lucius was in Azkaban, and Potter was not. If that said didn’t say anything about morality, then Draco and his echoing brain didn’t know what did.
"Why?" He asked suddenly, snapping out of his trance. "Why would you want that?"
His father.
Not Harold." He gave a small smirk, the corners of his eyes crinkled at the action. "And secondly, you haven't said you wouldn't come. Which means you might. Which
“Brilliant observation, but I’m afraid to say you're wrong.” Draco said stiffly, and he placed a hand to his left side, where his books usually lay. Despite his depressed mood, the Muggle treasures gave him a lovely sense of comfort.
"No." Draco shook his head as he said it. "No, I once visited America with my father and mother. When... when we were in town... I believe."
"The devils are you talking about? You only spoke to them last week! 'In forever!' Kiss my ass, Potter!" Draco shook his head at how theatrical Harry was.
Another silence took over the room, and the smell of the Halloween feast was drifting into Draco’s nose, making his mouth water. He
The words on the cards were becoming harder and harder to read but he didn't realize he'd begun to cry again until a tear fell on them.
"I'm bloody dating you, aren't I?"
Teddy.
Draco just nodded again, eyeing the objects on his desk. He didn’t plan on doing anything with them, he was far too nervous. He only kept thinking about how dumb he’d been to come back to school, how absolutely idiotic the idea was. He didn’t care if something had happened to his mum and dad, he didn’t care that Hermione Granger, and probably everyone else, knew about it and he didn’t. He didn’t
“I was…” Harry trailed, and Draco noticed the raspiness in his voice. He could tell Potter’s nose was stuffed already, because his voice was froggy too. “I was so
family member, the only one she truly cared for was a soulless, loveless, shell of a man. Death was a terrifying thing when it came to people you knew, he’d only just found that out.
He only wished more people than his mother said it.
reading projects,” she said with a wink and a smug smile. He blushed and nodded. “I believe he’ll find them of great interest, might even introduce you to some other Muggle loves.”
“Oh, you twit. You don’t get to take credit of my obvious victory!” Harry laughed and Draco jumped when the boy's hand slammed down onto the table. Draco wasn’t fond of Harry Potter’s laugh, he never had been. When he was younger, it had been because Draco wanted to be in on whatever funny secret Harry had been laughing at. But now, as an eighteen-year-old, he resented it for its boastfulness. It’s resemblance to the one of Lucius Malfoy. The man who always laughed at the dispense of others, namely Draco.
Originally I wanted this to be a happy chapter but then I started writing at 2am and all of a sudden, Draco just started craving death. I went with it and now we have this angsty ass chapter that hurts even me. So I'm very sorry. Please forgive me. *hands tissues*
"Well obviously," he said hotly. He walked over and waved a hand in front of Draco's face. When he wasn't acknowledged, he picked up Teddy and gave him to Pansy.
"Draco? What's the matter?" Draco's head shot up, and he stared at Harry.
"No one said that, Draco!"
As he read another line off of his stack of cards, a thought crossed his mind. How dare he even think about accepting Harry's request.
But something he’d found out over the two weeks he’d allowed his slight friendship with Potter manifest was that the boy didn't take lightly to being ignored. A fact known to Draco Malfoy and Draco Malfoy only, or so it seemed, was that Harry Potter, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, was a huge baby that didn’t enjoy being looked over.
Another roar of agreement, more smiles flew around. Draco looked around for someone he recognized, though he sort of remembered all of them. After all, these were the people he’d grown up with. These were the people he’d lived with consecutively for months at a time. They were supposed to be family, why did he never let them be family? After his own
all that life had to give to her for all of her sacrifice. He deserved to feel the pain, all of the hurt he and his side had thrust upon the good.
Anyone wanna be my beta? It would really help, lmao!
“Can I have your attention everyone!”
"And Sirius risked everything for me, he saw me as another James, as my dad. That's why, I think." Hermione nodded.
"No." Pansy sighed, no normal wizard would have gotten away with the intrusive questions alive, but Draco was her best friend.  After all, her, Blaise, and Malfoy had become the sort of out-of-school, slytherin golden trio. "It's hard for everyone, you know?"
"So yeah, in short, I could kick your pure-blood arse, Malfoy." Ginevra Weasley stood in the doorway of the small home, broomstick over shoulder, leaning against the wall with a pleased smirk on her face.
“Erm,” he flustered, although he knew she was right. “I suppose, Professor.”
Hating to think of his father, realizing that the man haunted him no matter if he were in Draco’s memories or in the flesh, he allowed himself a brief moment to think of his mother. Could it be all for show? No one would imprison a bedridden witch, would they? He knew his mother wouldn’t stop so low, but entertaining that thought was easier than accepting the fact that his dear mum was alone at the manor with no one but the house elves to keep her company. She could be moments from death, and Draco was simply too stubborn to go and see her, or perhaps he was simply too embarrassed.
He didn’t think he was above assistance, nothing like that. He merely thought of himself as an outsider, someone that didn’t deserve help; and certainly the majority of the Wizarding World would agree with him.
The idea that the past year had been an emotional roller coaster that had the possibility of being nothing more than a faint memory for Draco disgusted him. All of this hard work he’d put in, and he wouldn’t even be more than a fond thought on a lonely night.
