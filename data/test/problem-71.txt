“Well, apparently, my dad had known for years as Sirius always went to him after having a wet dream about Remus…” Harry smirked.
Draco wasn’t blind. He knew he liked the stupid Golden Boy… Physically at least. He wasn’t as perfectly handsome as Teddy was. He was small, cranky and clearly never learnt how to use a hairbrush! But he had this
“You have nothing to be ashamed of, you know?” the Slytherin continued while resuming dressing in dry robes. “Teddy is just a bit taller, but he isn’t that fit.”
The Slytherin met Harry’s eyes across the Great Hall. The Gryffindor had noticed their common best friend’s strange behaviour too. And it didn’t stop at breakfast on that first morning either. For the next few days until the end of the term, Teddy would spend all his time in the library. Apparently, he had unlimited access to the Restricted Section and was hunting for any book about alternations in time…
“A bit?” Harry admitted. “I think I will take a nap in the train…” His hand kept on brushing against Draco’s as if he was hesitating to take it.
Anyway, Harry had barged in too less than 30 minutes later and Dobby had embarrassed Draco in a way only his mother could have equalled…
Harry’s eyes were large with fear and fixed on his best friend. “I… I don’t know. I don’t want to let him alone… Maybe… maybe we could take him to the Infirmary…”
He turned and climbed the few steps leading to his dorm room. He grabbed his two-way mirror and cast a privacy charm around his bed.
Granger then asked him a few questions about the prefect position in the different houses, which was a good distraction to avoid bringing Harry in the discussion.
It was unsettling… To realise that despite everything Teddy seemed to have told Draco about himself, he still had kept so much for himself.
Draco rolled his eyes while Harry chuckled softly. The fake-child hide his face against the Gryffindor’s chest. Harry hugged him back and Draco just watched them with a loving smile on his face, wondering if this could be their future in a few years.
“Don’t think about it… we just have to be more discrete when we see each other, that’s all,” Draco said.
Draco hesitated for a second. Did he go too far? But Harry’s wrist was still in his hand and the boy hadn’t moved the slightest away from him.
“Thank you! I am so excited! Do you know what our position really entails? I tried to find some more information on Hogwarts History – Prefect edition, but I think the book is incomplete.”
“… no… he shouldn’t… he shouldn’t have died… I… Why did he die?! It’s not… it shouldn’t have happened…”
“Why is he reacting like that??” Weasley asked behind them. “Do you know if he has a thing for Diggory or something?”
“I know…” Harry sighed. “Believe it or not but I’m starting to know you a little, Draco Malfoy. And I don’t mind a little teasing but…” He stopped and sighed. “I’m sorry… you must be thinking that I’m a bother and you probably regret asking me out in the first place…”
He sighed, putting Pansy’s hand out of his body, and looked up at Blaise. Even if they weren’t that close, they were still friends and Blaise wasn’t the kind to boast around.
Draco and Potter had watched their friend recollecting on the edge of the Black Lake. Then, they had walked him to the Castle as Professor Sprout had asked to see him and Draco had left when they met Sirius Black – now Lord Black – his mother’s infamous cousin. Draco’s mother had talked to Draco about the man in her letters that year. She wasn’t sure how they should act regarding him yet. He was a wild card. So, Draco decided to keep it as neutral as possible. The man clearly had prejudices against him already and, even if Teddy defended him, he didn’t want to stay near the man longer than necessary… So, he had left Teddy with Potter and went back to his Common Room.
“Shagging you until you forget how to ride a broom…” Draco confirmed, and Harry’s lips were on his again.
But Potter was off-limit. Because he was Teddy’s best friend… Teddy’s brother. And if anything went wrong with him, Draco could lose Teddy in the process.
“Oh, don’t worry about me… I just need to get used to it but I’m alright…” the other boy said sheepishly.
Despite being the birthday boy only a week before, Teddy had seemed a bit down lately. Harry had asked Draco if he knew anything but the Hufflepuff hadn’t talked to him either. Harry and Draco had been exchanging glares for almost ten minutes for one of them to ask their friend what was going on, but Harry was the Gryffindor! Not him! So, Draco wouldn’t ask!
teach Harry how to properly cut the Scurry grass… And he certainly didn’t force Harry to put his head on his shoulder just so he could read his notes on when to add the Lovage… And the way his hand slipped on Harry’s tight had been totally accidental! If he had noticed the way Harry shuddered, he certainly would have stopped but Draco was a diligent student so, of course, he was focusing on their potion!
“You know I’m the real Harry, you git…” Harry sighed. “Otherwise, how would I know that you have a mole on your left cheek?”
Draco smiled and then his mind went wondering who the other prefects would be. Teddy had told him, as one of his stupid predictions, that Weasley would be Gryffindor’s… which didn’t make any sense if anyone was asking. Of course, he came to tolerate the redhaired because he was friend with Teddy and Teddy didn’t always have time to see all his friends separately… but still… Weasley’s and Granger’s constant bickering was insufferable and Draco really didn’t want to spend every Prefect meeting listening to it for 3 years…
Teddy was doing so much better. It seemed that he had completely given up on his research mission. Which was good… Draco thought.
During the first breakfast of the term, Granger and Weasley came to see him which drew a bit too much unwanted attention since, for once, Teddy wasn’t with him – he learnt later that it was very much intentional on the Hufflepuff’s part. After their uninspired menaces which included lines such as ‘
Are you still there? This chapter is a bit darker than usual but I promised Harry won't be too angsty in the future! I mean, if you read Teddy you know he's not angsty!
Harry shrugged. “How common death by acromantula bites at the end of a centuries-old tournament is?” he asked evenly.
But they didn’t kiss this time. They hadn’t kissed in two weeks since that day in Gryffindor changing room. It was strange… And Harry was definitely as nervous as he was.
“Well, my mother had been a prefect when she was at Hogwarts. She told me that rules tend to be adjusted every year but that everything will be explained during our meeting in the Hogwarts Express. And then, during the meeting with Professor McGonagall during the first Sunday of the school year.”
Draco pinched his lips. Was Teddy having a vision of some sort?! He had read that that could be one of the manifestations of his gift, something to do with prophecies…
“It was my father’s,” Harry explained softly. “Your mother taught me that it was common courtesy to offer a piece of family jewellery when two members of respected families start courting…”
On the morning of the 14th of February, Draco was sitting in Slytherin table with Teddy, Pansy, Theo, and Blaise. Teddy had just started going out with Tracey Davis from his house, so the girl was there too.
“Please, Draco…” Harry begged. “I… I’m so scared he might get himself sick at this rate. He’s having nightmares you know… Remus said that he hears him crying at night… but he just closes off when we try to talk to him about it… I don’t know what to do…”
Maybe Potter had noticed his feelings and asked Teddy to set him off to beat the shit out of him. But Potter seemed as surprised as he was to see him there. So maybe he didn’t know… Maybe Teddy noticed Draco’s feelings for Potter and had set them up! But that would be… so much like his best friend… What if Teddy knew something thanks to his seer abilities?
“No,” Draco stated clearly as Harry lowered his eyes out of shame. “I don’t regret anything. I… I’m sorry. I’ll try and back down on the sarcasm, ok? But if I don’t get the signs quick enough, could just tell me? I don’t want to make you feel uncomfortable. Believe it or not, I’ve not been in many relationships either and I want this to work.”
The mirror blurred and only his own reflect appeared in it. Draco sighed and crashed on his mattress. Why couldn’t Blaise just shut his mouth?!
Lucius turns back to the man and raises a perfectly unamused, blond brow. “I’m afraid I haven’t, Borgin, though I am tempted to if you use that tone on me again.” Both sneer at one another. “However, I
Mr Crouch must've been hiding his stupidity behind that fancy Muggle suit, because no half-way-intelligent wizard could believe that Harry Potter had conjured the Dark Mark. In fact, Draco doubted Harry even knew what it was, what it meant.
Pansy and a boy called Blaise sit with him on the train. It had been a boring journey, filled with stilted questions and uncomfortable silences. When they finally arrived, Draco quickly separated from them into the endless sea of students.
Draco stared at her, thinking of his own mother's curt farewells every September. "Thank you for looking after me, Mrs Weasley."
“No,” the voice says. It’s Terry, Draco realises. Sweet, kind Terry. “Well, sometimes he wakes me up cause I can hear him like, pacing in the middle of the night, but nothing this… bad.”
He sits with Boot in the corner of the room, only half focussing on the world around him as he daydreams about the comfortable, silk pillows back at Malfoy Manor. He’s tired (though Draco is used to that feeling) and homesick. He almost misses Potter’s grand entrance.
Potter's caterpillar eyebrows furrowed. "Then where were you? Hold on, have you been ignoring me? I've been inside this castle all morning, by myself, and you just left me to it?"
“Buckbeak,” said Granger, and bowed low at the creature. Harry and Weasley did the same and encouraged Draco to, as well. He did so, a little nervously, and internally took back ever wanting to be in Hagrid’s class. Magical animals were all so awful.
Just then, the bell rung, signalling the start of their first lesson for the day. Everybody stumbled into the classroom in relative silence, except for the odd giggling girl or two.
“This book is dark!” she hisses, finishing a page about magical poisons. She sounds remarkably scandalised for a girl who’s fingers are itching to read the next chapter. Draco rolls his eyes. “I’m serious!”
The end of the summer came alarmingly fast once Harry was cleared of all charges. Draco spent his last few hours at Grimmauld Place double-checking he had packed everything for the coming months, and making promises to Mrs Weasley that he wouldn't be a stranger. Tonks, Moody, and Lupin escorted them to the station, as well as Sirius, who insisted on coming along in his dog-form.
Professor Umbridge made a note on her clipboard. "And, correct me if I'm wrong, you are the first in your family to have inherited Cassandra's Second Sight?"
Oh, but Harry sounds so damn sure. And Draco knows what Severus thinks of the great Harry Potter, how he treated him during class. Everyone at school knows.
Again, the boy doesn’t say anything. He’s just beginning to run out of icebreakers when there’s a heavy thump-thump-thump at the shop’s front window. They both look over, and Draco almost falls off his stool again.
Madam Malkin was friendly enough, aiming different fabrics over his head and humming whatever tune is stuck in her as she works. Draco normally can just ignore her, and be done with it in a couple of minutes-- not on days like these, though.
"You've got no right to talk to me like that, Malfoy," said Sirius, "If I had any say in it, I wouldn't even let you stay here. You're just lucky Dumbledore thinks you're important enough to protect."
Severus pulled something from his coat pocket and handed it to him. It was a piece of scrap parchment. "Memorise that. Quickly, please."
Draco screams and falls off his bed with a lasting bang. A series of curses slip past his lips, and his arm blossoms in pain. Tears sprang to his eyes. He pulls himself into a tight ball, shoulders trembling.
He waves. Draco gives a shy wave back. Potter starts walking over, but another boy, the redheaded Weasley that bumped into him on Monday, drags Potter to the gaggle of Gryffindors across the classroom. Draco is relieved, he’s not entirely sure what would’ve happened if the great Harry Potter sat down with Lucius Malfoy’s son. Nothing good, that’s for sure.
When he arrived home, his head took on the numbing emptiness that it sometimes did these days. Draco picked up Helga from where she was attempting to dig a hole in the couch and presses their foreheads together. He pretended the stinging in his eyes was from exhaustion and nothing else.
The end of lunch bell rung, and he stood and could see the heads of Weasley and Potter heading in the direction of Trelawney's classroom. He sped up and matched their pace. "Hello."
Not even a Floo visit from his mother helped to cheer him up. She'd gotten permission to call and tell him that he was to start having sessions with Terra, his old Mind-Healer, again— apparently all the teachers were getting concerned, mainly Lupin, so it was necessary that he wastes some of his own weekends to 'talk about his feelings'. He hadn't liked these sessions when he was younger, and he definitely wouldn't, now.
Draco shook his head. His parents always said the Knight Bus was for lesser wizards and witches; Muggle-born and blood traitors, in other words. So they would usually just Apparate, or Floo everywhere.
Weasley flipped him off. Harry was still worrying his bottom lip between his teeth, while Granger pulled her thick hair into a floppy bun. "Whatever, Malfoy. Let's just get out of here. Oh, and Harry, did you notice how Cho was looking at you earlier...”
The man swept away. Draco could’ve laughed if he hadn’t been so terrified of what was about to happen. He ran back to Luna, who grabbed onto his hand again, and it was like that they watched; like that, they waited for the inevitable.
He cut himself off. Heart skipping, Draco stared into the infuriatingly green eyes of one Harry Potter. His skin is tanner than it had been at Hogwarts, and his back is visibly less tense. Draco noticed the smaller boy beside Potter a beat later, placed delicately atop the hospital cot, with his little legs dangling over the side.
"Just that Dumbledore would be mighty interested in who has it out for that boy. And I am, too... Very interested..."
Draco waved his wand and the blonde locks on his head pulled themselves into a loose bun. “I doubt it’ll be busy. Maybe I’ll run into Neville, he’s probably back from Hogwarts by now. I should visit if I don’t see him.”
copy into her bag, along with her timetable that had been laid out on the table. “Fine! I give up, then! I’m leaving!”
He knows the dream hadn’t been real, yet afterwards he cannot help the icy fear running through his veins. Draco rushes downstairs to the Manor’s library to search for books that mention any serpents with the ability to kill people with only its stare. His search is futile, he finds nothing.
Only one door was open. As the three stepped closer to it, a pained moan and loud purring came from inside. Draco hardened his jaw, swallowed any fears, and went first.
. Oh, but what a dream it was. Flashes of green, so curiously bright in the endless abyss that the night sky is, while shouts and cackles floated in the air. The cruel man’s words bounce around Draco’s head the most, real and evil;
hole. His dick jerks and so do I; his opening quivers under my mouth. I smile against it and kiss him again, mouth open, breathing warm air on his entrance.
... but considering that I went home alone that day, it can be rightly said that we both lost. As I fucked my fist alone in the shower later, however, I realised one thing: I didn't
I love Harry when he's like this: on his back, legs spread as wide as he can for me, cock bouncingly hard on his stomach smearing his skin with sticky pre-come.
I couldn’t help my mouth curving in a smile before I’d even opened my eyes. I turned my head to look at him, met his lips with my own and muttered into his mouth, "I love you too, Harry."
In winter, we snuggle up in the red parlour. I figured Harry would love it for its Gryffindor connotations - all furnished in red and gold, with a real fireplace. Of course, it's also the only living room without a portrait - I can't see my father's wandering shade rejoicing in watching us screw each other madly in what was his favourite room. I thank whomever enchanted the fur rug in front of the fireplace almost daily; I don't know how much sweat and come we’ve deposited on it, but it remains pristine despite our best efforts. On colder days, this is where I introduce Harry to the pleasures of roasted chestnuts, mulled wine and toasted marshmallows.
"I can't sometimes," said Draco. Mrs Weasley came over and placed a couple of slices of toast in front of him, too. "Are you okay?"
Was that all Draco was ever destined to be? Lucius Malfoy's only son... An ex-Death-Eater's child...
So, he spends his morning making a list of who he would be spending his Christmas money on. Potter is at the top, obviously-- his reaction to a singing card will be hilarious. He also buys one for Severus, Luna, and Professor Flitwick. "I think that should do it. Do you have a camera? I would love to immortalise my godfather's face when one of those... troll-baby things come and start serenading him."
He thought about his dreams, the ones that showed him battles and death. They were scary, sure, but not his greatest fear. Perhaps a snake, then. Draco definitely didn't like those much, especially after last year. Although, that man could show up— the one with the scarlet eyes and paper skin. No, that wouldn’t happen. Surely. Draco would just settle with, "A basilisk, sir."
Without waiting for a response, he stormed back upstairs and headed for Regulus' bedroom— the one that stupid Sirius had assigned him. It was smaller than his room at the Manor, but still relatively big. It was also covered in green in whatever direction you looked.
The teacher arrives then, and Draco gets to forget all his problems for one more night. Astronomy turns out to be a fun class, as he already knows a lot of stuff. Perks of having private lessons since he learnt to walk and all that superiority rubbish. When it ends, Potter is hurried out by his friends, leaving no chance to say goodbye to Draco. Once again, he's glad for it and leaves for the trek back to his own dormitory.
A wisp of white-blonde hair fell over his eyes. Draco tucked it back into place, vaguely aware of the stare Potter was giving him.
“So, yeah, I reckon I could kill you, but you deserve a fate worse than death for what you’ve done. I think I’ll just leave you to the dementors.”
The next few days passed in a numb, forgetful sort of way. Draco kept himself busy up in his bedroom, reading books and doing any last-minute homework. Only the house-elves bothered to make sure he was still eating, as neither of his parents ever knocked on his door to make sure he was okay— Lucius was rarely home at all, lately. So, when September first finally came around, he was glad to have been done with summer. The castle's twisting corridors and moving staircases had never seemed so alluring in Draco's mind.
Potter is also there, which he wisely ignores. The git hadn’t responded to any of his owls over summer, despite promising to stay in touch after they’d reconciled on the train in June.
It took him even longer to get past the riddle with Potter breathing near his ear, though eventually he managed. Draco ran up to his empty dormitory, and sat down on his bed, back straight. A memory from first-year surfaced, just for a moment.
“Surely eet can wait till after ze task, little boy,” Madam Maxime said, when Dumbledore failed to reply.
When his breathing became too painful to keep running, Draco leaned against one of the many trees and whispered a quiet, "Lumos," into the night. The tip of his wand lit up. He tilted his face forward and found the moonlight glittering through the thick branches above him. For some reason, the sight calmed him down. It was familiar; grounding. His friends would be looking up at the same moon, hopefully in a safer position than he was in, now.
“My darling,” his mother sobs, pushing Potter away to be closer to Draco. “You’re alive. Thank Merlin.”
After dinner, the opening song started. Predictably, Harry made a fool of himself on the dance floor, and Draco took pity and dragged Luna out only a few seconds in. Other pairs followed suit.
Draco had a lot of practice at lying and was about to put it to good use, but Harry beat him to it. "Sirius. I'm wondering when he's going to write back."
Her tail stuck up as she ate. Draco shook his head, fond, and walked on unsteady legs to the bedroom. His cottage is relatively small, so it’s only a couple of steps to travel. The hallway is dark, but he doesn’t bother lighting his wand.
“Peter Pettigrew was killed twelve years ago!” Snape snapped, suddenly angry. “I don’t know what Black has told you, but he proved himself capable of murder when he was sixteen-years-old! He deserves exactly what he’s going to get, so I won’t hear any more nonsense about his innocence! What would your father say? He’s already mad you didn’t want him to speak at Hagrid’s trial.”
"Beautiful, beautiful..." Draco applauds. As he claps, his eyes catch on something near Potter's feet, and his heart stops.
“Magical snakes?” Borgin murmurs, sounding curious as he walks around the counter and towards a shelf coated in spiderwebs. “I have a large collection of books about magical creatures, although none so specific. Maybe… ah.” The man reveals a leather-bound, thick book. The spine is covered in inky splotches that resemble birds if you squint. “This one has lots of information about reptiles. Dark ones, ‘specially.”
Draco approaches them silently, hovers his hands just above Harry’s shoulders and says, as loudly as he can, “
"Has Mistress' house been saved? Has Kreacher finally found a worthy master? Oh, let it be so, let it be so!"
He wasn't handsome, exactly. Krum, that is. He was surprisingly lean under the thick coats the Durmstrang students were wearing, and was always sporting quite a dark look on his face when Draco glanced over. Really, Draco didn't understand all the fuss. Sure, the guy was an alright flier, but so were plenty of other people. The commotion about a famous Quidditch player being at the school reminded him of first-year when people were still starstruck at seeing Harry Potter roaming the halls.
It takes ten minutes for them to get through everything-- the facts, their theories, their questions. By the end, Draco has a solid idea of what has been transpiring between the three all year. It had been triggered by Zabini, the kid from the train so many months ago, who challenged Harry to some sort of duel. It continued with an extraordinary amount of eavesdropping and guesswork.
“I missed your potty mouth,” Potter laughs. They huddled together on the grimy floor for another minute. Then, “We should start heading back. Ron will be waiting.”
“It’s not a dog,” Weasley murmured between clenched teeth. “Harry, it’s a trap... The dog is an animagus. Black, he’s—”
Potter stared at him, silent. Draco fell back onto his bed and pulled a pillow over his face. “Suffocate me, please. I’d rather not exist, anymore.”
Sirius Black. Draco knew him— well, not knew-knew. They were related through his mother, and Draco had a vague memory of meeting Walburga Black before she died. That woman had been as bitter as he was dramatic. All she'd talk about was her blood-traitor son who ended up in Azkaban even after all his little rebellions as a teenager.
Draco ignored them, looking up and down the train's corridor for Luna. She must've already found a compartment, though. "I suppose I'll be off, then?"
Draco decided it’s time for him and Luna to go. Any respectable Malfoy knows to never stay till the end of the party-- the key was to leave sometime in the middle, to successfully make an appearance and consequently not create drama, but to avoid still being there when people started getting drunk.
“I don’t care.” Potter hesitated and then laid down beside him, so they were both facing the bed’s navy blue canopy. “I don’t want to get you worked up again, but Trelawney always refuses to start class when you’re late. She doesn’t do that for anyone else.”
Today, he was being measured for Hogwarts robes; his new uniform. Mother had insisted on getting three sets a size too big, in case he grew over the school year, as well as a set one size too small, in case he somehow shrunk! Of course, there were also the sets that needed to fit him as he was now. Altogether, it was taking too damn long. Draco had been stood on this stupid stool for almost half an hour.
A flash of lightning revealed the man's face. He had one real eye, and another, fake one that rolled around in his head, as if trying to get a glimpse of everything at once. A large chunk of his nose was missing.
Draco swiped a dash of marmalade over his bread and thought about his words. Harry very well could be right; the Ministry had been trying to make him out as crazy all summer, to dispute his claims of the Dark Lord being back, and having him be expelled from Hogwarts would be the cherry on top. Still, he needed to comfort his friend. And more than that, he
The Gryffindor's did, eventually, hurry off without any more comment. Harry flashed him a quick, grateful smile before disappearing back into the dark, and Draco most definitely would not be storing it away for the future.
When Christmas finally rolls around, Draco spends half the morning finishing up his first full night of sleep in months. He opens his gifts a little bit before dinner and then heads to the hall for the feast. Potter, Granger and Weasley are already inside, waiting.
Draco rolled his eyes. "It can't be. My mother's French." Kind of. She hadn't been raised there, or anything.
Word spreads around school that Harry Potter isn’t returning home for the two weeks, either. Rumours are common in the corridors of Hogwarts, and whispers of his rough upbringing have already gone through them. Draco doesn’t want to believe silly gossip, but with the way Potter had been dressed in the robe-shop… Those baggy clothes? And now that he thinks about it, the boy had been far too skinny as well. Draco instantly realises he’s being childish for getting upset over having to stay when other kids have spent entire childhoods with shitty parents.
The witches and wizards that roam in this alleyway are as hunched as they are cruel, and the shops that Draco wanders by with his father are infested with dark and stomach-turning things. There’s always a feeling of discomfort whirring in the musty air, easily countering the warmth that comes from walking through Diagon Alley’s bustling streets. Draco, fortunately, is rarely allowed to visit this particular part of London, so it had been with plenty of surprise that Lucius dragged him along this morning. He’d wanted Draco to accompany him in selling some useless junk that has been collecting dust in their underground vault for the past century.
He’s so caught up in cussing his parents that Draco doesn’t notice Harry Potter before he’s standing right in front of him, a curious tilt to his stupid, ugly head-- just when he thought his day couldn’t get any worse. “What do you want?”
“No idea.” Harry drapes it across his shoulders, which leaves him a floating head. “It came with a note, though. Apparently it used to belong to my dad.”
The sound continued until he, angrily, curled his fingers around the base of his wand and muttered a spell to shut it up. Breathing a sigh of relief, Draco dropped back into the warmth of his covers, eyes crusty with sleep. He cursed his past self for forgetting to cancel the Siren Charm that many of the Healers use, as it leaves him awake at 6:02 A.M. on a Saturday for no reason.
Tears stung at his eyes. Only minutes before Weasley was defending him, calling them friends. And now— now he was accusing his father of something with no evidence. Draco clenched his jaw, and said, “Thanks a lot. I think I’ll be going now.”
p.s. i changed the title of this fic because i felt like it didnt match with the story anymore (used to be Nothing Noble About This Life)
Perhaps he could try mediating the situation before it really begins, though. Draco wanders over, and hopes this will work.
“Busy time at the Ministry, isn’t it?” Draco’s father asks idly. “All those raids… I do hope they are paying you overtime.”
The next morning, Draco decided he'd rather die than attend the stupid therapy session. He hid under his covers until Severus sent an older Ravenclaw student to come up and drag him out of bed. He skipped breakfast and went straight down to the dungeons. The plan was for Draco to go through the Floo network, meet his mother at St Mungo's, and then spend an hour of his life with a woman who once claimed he was depressed. He'd been eight.
The doors squeaked open, revealing a wizard who must've only been in his early twenties. He had large ears, and pimples in sizes that Draco had never seen before. "Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stra..."
Sirius grimaced, “If you say so. Now, Harry, I wanted to be ready in case anything went wrong at Hogwarts. Your last letter... well, let’s just say things are getting stranger. From the papers I’ve been stealing, I’m not the only one who thinks so.”
Draco doesn’t know what to think about the whole evil-Professor-Snape aspect. He doubts his godfather would bother with such a confusing plan… But, then again, Harry claimed his scar had hurt the first time he’d seen Severus, and the man
This was the closest they’d gotten to talking about it. Granger had gotten swept away by Krum, and Weasley was still distracted by Fleur. For all intents and purposes, they were alone. “Harry, what I said that night. I wasn’t kidding. Me liking boys is part of my, er, identity, I suppose, and if you don’t approve of it, then I can’t—“
Draco fluttered his eyelashes at Granger. “If that part is true, have you really been using Love Potions?”
"Oh, it's splendid," Luna giggles. "I've already sent cards to Terry, Penelope, Ron, Pansy, and you! Although I doubt you've received it yet."
In the end, Draco nods off during a particularly boring passage about experimental breeding on dragons. A shame, really.
Taking his usual seat in the darkest corner, Draco pulled out his copy of A History of Magic and began to flick through it. The Goblin Rebellions, combined with Professor Binn's terrible teaching was almost enough to put him off of the subject, but being able to read ahead made it much more interesting. He knew in sixth-year, they would learn about wand-lore, which surely would turn out to be better than what they were doing now. Truthfully, anything would be better than what they were doing, now.
Moody raised his wand, and the spider stopped rocking in pain. It relaxed, barely, still twitching slightly. He put it back in the jar, after putting it back to its proper size. "You would be Lucius Malfoy's son, eh?"
Ginny raised an eyebrow at him. "And I doubt you would've noticed either way Malfoy if I'm right in remembering you were drunk for the better half of that night. What d'you want with a pair of earrings for anyway?"
Many evenings were spent falling asleep early just to escape the suffocating loneliness that followed him everywhere around the house. One night, after waking from a dream he'd rather not think about, Draco ventured outside his room and into the kitchen, where he found Sirius sat at the table with a collection of expensive wine bottles surrounding him. His dark hair had been groomed since his escape from Azkaban, though his eyes were just as lifeless as the day they'd met. Draco hesitated when he caught sight of the man, but his dry throat painfully reminded him why he had come out in the first place.
Weasley and Potter glance at each other. “Well, we were visiting Hermione in the Hospital Wing when we found a scrap of paper in her hand that said what had been attacking the students. A basilisk.”
A little terrifyingly, she set her large grin on Draco. Her eyes wandered over his white-blonde hair, his pointy nose, and the necklace still cupped in his hand. Embarrassed, he shoved it into the same pocket with his trunk. Her attention lingered on it for half a second, until she abruptly thrust her hand out and said, "I'm Tonks."
"He's a useless old fool." Severus hurried them further inside, and let the door fall shut. For a moment, they faced each other in silence. Then, "I've told your mother you'll be spending the rest of your summer with that Luna girl. She wasn't happy, of course, but had no reason to forbid it."
“Please,” Draco begs through gritted teeth. Severus passes him a cup of icy water that he probably summoned with his wand. He takes tiny sips, each one calming him down bit by bit. Eventually he asks for his blanket.
“Obviously I’m okay,” Draco snaps. Potter flinches and steps away. “Sorry. I was just… Nevermind. Leave me alone, Potter.”
Draco shrugged, pleased. He doubted Potter had ever thanked him for anything in their lives. “Of course. You know the way out?”
He sighs. "I'm leaving. For real this time," Draco announces, and walks off before Potter can try to stop him. He hears their argument resume as soon as he’s a few metres away.
Potter’s face breaks out into a smile. His green eyes shine with something. Relief, maybe. “I’ve been trying to talk to you, but we don’t really have any classes together.”
As they head to the castle, he realises Weasley and Potter were still absent. Draco seriously doubts the pair are smart enough to send a letter to the school explaining they’d missed the train (if that indeed was what happened. He hopes they hadn’t been injured or something else disastrous). It’s more likely they’d found a broomstick to Hogwarts instead, though. That mental image makes him snort.
He ignored him. Zabini was terribly rude and had done all sorts of cruel things over the years. Draco doubted he'd ever forgive the guy for trying to have Buckbeak executed the previous year. "So. You actually like history, then?"
Weasley thumped him on the back, and Granger started crying from joy; Draco privately thought he wasn’t too far behind.
Draco allows him to rub warmth back into his arms, all while keeping in time with the counting. One, two, three… seven, eight… ten… He still feels like shit, and probably looks it too, but Severus’ presence at least helped his heart rate not be so deadly. Once his vision has finally cleared, he’s mortified to realise all his roommates had watched the ordeal go down. They stand around him and Snape, varying degrees of worry painted into their faces.
And so it began. Draco’s eyes started stinging after staring into his crystal ball for only five minutes, and if it weren’t for Granger’s complaining, he would’ve fallen asleep.
Number twelve Grimmauld Place was a black-painted building, with grimy windows and a neglected garden. There was an overwhelming sense of unhappiness about it, and already Draco was dreading stepping inside. However, as Severus tapped at the doorknob with his wand, he knew he had no choice. It was either this, or going back home where You-Know-Who could find use of him at any moment.
“I need you to stand now,” Severus says. He stands cautiously himself and pulls Draco up by his hand. “You have permission to lean on me.”
Potter looked embarrassed. He ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair, avoiding Draco’s eye. “It’s not any different to usual.”
A month into term and Draco isn’t feeling especially wise, though. With each that passed, he grew more and more tired. Even Severus had sent him a note one morning, asking whether he was feeling alright, and perhaps he should visit the Hospital Wing to pick up some sleeping draughts. The whole ordeal is stressful, and Draco’s only refuge becomes his diary, which he hides in his pillowcase.
“I just remembered I have to do something,” he lies. Pulling his bag over his shoulder and ignoring Boot’s mutterings about detention, Draco hurried out from the classroom. Professor Binns never even noticed the door opening.
Of course, you did, Draco thought. He'd learnt about it in a book, as well, though likely a much darker one than Goldstein had, as it had come from the Malfoy Manor's library.
The relief of having Harry permanently in the house quickly fizzled out by the time his trial came around, though. Draco left Regulus' room early one morning to find Harry sat at the eating table, a plate of toast untouched before him. The sight of him sent a flutter of worry to tiptoe around his stomach. "Hey."
On the train, he sat with Luna, Harry, Granger and Weasley. The four spent most of the ride in silence.
Draco was actually attending his classes on time, too. Muggle Studies got more interesting with each lesson, along with Arithmancy. Divination was harder to explain. Granger was set on hating it, and Weasley and Potter always treated it like a joke. Trelawney
, Draco thought. He’s never encountered such a person before, nor has he ever heard of a Metamorphmagus losing their powers. Of course, he can’t simply say that. Half of his job was just reassuring patients that they would end up alright, and admitting to his cluelessness wasn’t reassuring in the slightest.
"Maybe." He scooped a bit of mashed potato onto his plate. "Have you finished your essay for Muggle studies yet?"
The bell rung out across the library, signalling the end of class and giving Draco an excuse not to prolong the encounter any longer than necessary. "See you around, Zabini."
The title read ‘Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache’ and was all about Hermione Granger’s horrid affair with Viktor Krum, just as Draco had predicted it to be. “Well, well, well. I have never read something so tragic! How could you, Granger? Harry adores you!”
“Yeah.” He avoids Potter’s amused gaze, his cheeks feeling hot all of a sudden. “Not even the good kind of incest either, like the Blacks. The Slytherin’s didn’t do it to stay pure, they did it because they were selfish. They didn’t want anyone else to have the ability of talking to snakes, you see, so they only had offspring with people who already could. It’s all very gross.”
Mrs Weasley's efforts to hug each of them became more frantic as the train whistled overhead, urging the students still on the platform to hurry up. She was looking teary-eyed. "Stay out of trouble! If you've forgotten anything, we can owl it over... Ginny, please write to us weekly..."
They left the room, ignoring Septimus' indignant shouts of kidnapping. When Severus replied, he spoke in a hushed tone, as if he didn't want any other portraits to overhear. "The Dark Lord may want Lucius to hand you over soon, what with... Well." He coughed. "So, Dumbledore arranged for you to be moved to a place where neither of them will think, or be able to look. Some of the Order doubt you'll be at the top of You-Know-Who's list of priorities, though, so don't get too worried."
Something worse than the shadows passed by their door, making loud wheezing sounds as it moved down the train. It was like somebody had taken Draco's very soul, and pulled apart the fickle joy which had gathered there over the summer. He had to blink away the tears that began to gather in his eyes.
Luna and he found an empty spot beside some third-years, who all hastily turned away when they sat down. Frowning, Draco asked, "Do I smell bad or something? Are my robes inside out?"
Severus raised an eyebrow, seriously doubtful. “You really should stop hanging around Gryffindor’s so much. They’re making you act incredibly stupid.” With that, he left to go find Potter, Granger, and Sirius.
He disappears without waiting for a response. Potter gives his hand one last squeeze before going after him. Weasley waves a quick goodbye too.
“Of course,” Severus agrees, and orders one of the other boys to grab it. Soon his mother’s silky Christmas gift is being wrapped around him. It somehow smelt like her. “How do you feel now?”
“We had guests,” Potter cut in. “Hermione and Ron came over, plus Luna and Seamus dropped in at one point, too. What’s that got to do with his magic, though?”
"Don't protect him!" Snape snarled, and glared right up at the staircase where Harry was probably standing. "That is Potter's egg, and that piece of parchment belongs to him, too! I saw it last year! Potter is here, in his Invisibility Cloak! And, you!" he whirled around to point at Draco. "Were you planning to meet with him? Try to help him figure out the clue, despite it being against the tournament rules?"
“Severus?” Weasley speaks for the first time in a few minutes. “Why are you on a first-name basis with that git?”
He nods and swallows it whole. The potion immediately gets to work, making his tongue feel thick and eyes hazy. Draco lays on the thin bed, staring at the white ceiling, and welcomes sleep.
“You don’t need to lie, Draco,” Snape murmured, almost comforting. “The headmaster and I have known about you for a very long time. Since your first-year, in fact. I had no intention of ever confirming it with you, nor telling the Dark Lord about it, so I hope you forgive me for doing so, anyway. It was the only way to gain back his trust. Not even Lucius could’ve shared such important information with him.”
Potter held his arms up, grinning. A second later, Granger and Weasley appeared by the door. Their injuries had all healed, and both looked almost entirely back to normal, except for the secretive twinkle in each of their eyes. The four of them had a secret now, and it’s brought them closer together. “You don’t mind if we join you, Malfoy?”
A few minutes of meaningless chatter pass between the three. Draco jumps up for the bathroom at some point to splash cool water over his face and smooth out his hair. When he comes back, Boot and Corner are ready to go downstairs for food together. They talk the whole way there. Something warm floods through his veins; he thinks it’s contentment.
The three of them began to yell out denials. Weasley's voice carried the clearest as he asked, "What'd you attack us for?"
In the fridge, there’s some leftover spaghetti and a bar of chocolate that Cho must’ve brought over the last she visited. “Bless you, Chang,” he murmured, grabbing both the pasta and chocolate to eat. Draco closed the fridge door with his ankle and struggled off in the direction of the living room.
Madam Malkam’s face was looking rather concerned now, so he blinks out of his stupor and says, “I’m fine, sorry. My fault.”
The only class Draco has with the Gryffindors is Astronomy, so it’s not till his third day at Hogwarts that he gets a glimpse of the famous Harry Potter.
“Oh yeah, terribly wounded,” Draco says dramatically. He shimmies further into the blankets. Harry smiles. “Only kidding. I should be fine for Astronomy tonight.”
Potter pushed his glasses further up his nose and stood. He put his hand over Teddy’s shoulder, again. “Thanks, Malfoy.”
"No, it wasn't," said Potter. "Draco's a real Seer. Why d'you think he was at Sirius' house for the summer? Voldemort wants him to see into the future, and his slimy dad would've been willing to sacrifice him if Draco hadn't left."
"Not even a little," Draco chirps helpfully. He doesn't let go of Potter's hand, and starts dragging him further down the corridor. "Come on, then. We're almost there."
Borgin and Burkes is just the same as he remembers it to be; dusty and pulsing with a twisted type of cruelty. His imagination also seems to think he’s being watched.
“Cedric Diggory is going to die,” Draco said. As the words floated in between them, he found himself knowing they were truer than ever before. “And the Dark Lord is going to return, with the help of Peter Pettigrew. And Harry is— is... going to fight him. The cup is a port-key.”
Halfway into the journey, a knock forces Draco to uncurl himself from the corner seat. Potter gives him a sheepish wave from the other side of the door. “Can I come in?”
Some time later, six people come running in. He’s relieved to recognise two of them as his parents, while the others take another second to remember. Severus, McGonagall, Flitwick and Weasley crowd around the bed.
are on the tip of his tongue, but Draco allows them to fizzle away before he could be bothered to utter them. He knows the Gryffindors will reveal themselves eventually (and his fellow Ravenclaws are probably waiting for him somewhere) but Draco sort of would liked some time to himself. Maybe this girl could give him the peace he craved. So, Draco decided, it’d be best for her to stay. “No. I’m not.”
A few things happen in the next couple of seconds. For once, Granger drops a thick book she’d been bent over, which leads to an array of flowery language coming out of her mouth. Weasley falls onto his backside in surprise, while Harry lets out an extremely emasculating shriek. To summarise, it’s certainly a memory Draco plans to hold on to. “Priceless, absolutely priceless. You guys should’ve seen your faces.”
“Are you gonna tell us who Flamel is?” Weasley says, unaware of the agony occuring inside Draco’s head.
At the Leaving Feast, Dumbledore went through his yearly farewells, only this time he spoke of what had happened— the truth. Not the rumours that had been spreading since Harry appeared that night, clutching the lifeless body of one Cedric Diggory. Draco’s tongue felt heavy through the entire thing, and couldn’t even muster up the energy to applaud when the rest of the school did. He was strangely numb.
life. Draco privately thinks he should’ve aced it-- with every question, he’d come up increasingly more stupid answers. Like,
Draco rolled his eyes, and crouched down to pick up the book he'd dropped. Zabini doesn't move, though he does continue to watch. "How come you're not in class?"
“Oh?” Draco replied, knowing very well what he meant. Some of those entries talked about his dreams of Potter’s adventures, well before they’d even met. “I have no idea what you mean.”
"You didn't know?" Harry asked, sounding apologetic. Draco shook his head. "People have been saying it all term. I mean, it's not as gossiped about as me being completely insane, but it's still a pretty well-known rumour. Not that we believe it!"
A silence similar to the ones from their awkward robe-shop encounter occurs, then. Draco’s social skills have improved somewhat, so he has half an idea on how to proceed this time. “How’s Hagrid?”
He crossed his arms over his chest and cocked his hip, silent. Zabini raised an eyebrow at the display, gaze travelling downwards for a split second. "What? No snappy comeback? Or quick-witted reply? Your little friend Potter could do much better than that."
Or, really, he doesn't, because the man wanted to use the Imperius Curse on the students, and Draco felt no reason to take part in such a cruel activity— even if it was a waste of an hour. He could try catching up on some homework, take a nap ... So, after feeling Moody's fake-eye follow him out of the classroom, he headed to the library, only a pinch of regret fluttering around his mind.
Standing, Draco went and grabbed the cat food from the pantry. He poured the recommended amount into a yellow bowl before sliding it over to Helga, who had been lurking about an arm's length away.
They stopped in front of the trapdoor leading to the classroom, and Draco went first to climb up. Trelawney was talking to two Gryffindor girls, and didn't look up when the three entered. Harry led them toward a table near the back, and they sat down in silence.
Once at the station, his mother was there alone to pick him up. She engulfed him in a warm hug that had them both on the verge of tears and then Apparated them away, leaving Draco no moment to say his goodbyes.
“Are you going to kill me, Harry?” Black asked. Potter’s hand didn’t falter. “You’ll regret it. You don’t know half the story—”
"Sure, but I'm not going," Draco said. "I've got a... family thing. I'm allowed to leave the grounds that day."
"I'm really looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures, you know," said Luna in that enchanting way of hers. "I've heard wonderful things about Professor Hagrid."
There was stomping downstairs as Draco collapsed onto the emerald sheeted bed. He thought he could hear some cursing from Sirius before silence engulfed the house, thankfully. He dropped his eyes shut, but sleep didn't come, no matter how many Hippogriffs he counted. Giving up, Draco stood again and directed his attention to his suitcase. He'd never got around to unpacking it, even after Sev had returned it to its natural size, as the reality of the situation had never really hit before that moment. Grimmauld Place was, for now, his home. At least, the safest place he could call home at the moment.
"Same as you, I expect." Draco wiped the sweat from his forehead, still slightly breathless from his run. "Woke up from all the screaming, and made a break for it. Have any of you seen Luna?"
He had a strange feeling of being watched and looked up the staircase. Harry's egg was here... but no sign of him, anywhere... Or, perhaps, Harry simply didn't want to be seen.
“Yes, actually. Your mother has asked me to make sure you don’t do anything else stupid over the holidays.” He glares pointedly at Draco’s Ravenclaw tie. “So, don’t do anything stupid.”
"It's been great getting to know you, Draco," said Tonks. She was disguised as an old lady today, a hideous purple hat placed over her grey hair. "Just wish it was under better circumstances, yeah?"
"You do need a haircut," she said, reaching over to tuck a fallen lock of white-blonde hair back behind his ear. "Are you trying to grow it out like your father's?"
As he disappeared down the corridor. Draco slumped back onto the stone wall, a red flush dotting at his cheeks. He let his chin drop forward onto his chest, absently going through Sev's breathing exercises.
“Jealous? Please. Of what? I’d rather give my entire fortune away than have to suffer being the great Harry Potter for a day.”
“You’re my best friend, of course, I’ll keep it a secret,” Luna replied. A serious light had entered her eyes like never before. “And I think I’m rather fond of girls myself.”
"You're meant to stir it, dear," Trelawney muttered as she walked past them, probably noticing Draco's confusion.
Then, as if somebody had simply needed to flick their wand, light surrounded them again. Draco's breathing came a little easier.
“Oh, my!” Madam Malkin immediately rushes over to help him up. Draco’s face feels very, very hot as he reorients himself, and his bottom already has the beginnings of an ache. “Are you alright, dearie?”
They don their darkest, most depressing clothes for the event. It’s Luna’s idea, but Draco hadn’t needed much convincing to agree. They both look fetching in their Snape-reminiscent cloaks.
Resisting the urge to spit something worthy of a slap across the face, Draco looks innocently up at his father and says, “I just find them fascinating. Perhaps you’d rather I asked Hagrid about any magical creatures I’m interested in when I return to Hogwarts? He’d be
The stranger who had spoken let out a wince of his own, "Sorry. I wasn't thinking. You just looked so..."
get along. “But I reckoned you seemed a little lonely sometimes, and Hermione always says that you’re only ever at the library alone, so I thought maybe you needed a friend, and… yeah.”
Granger, who Draco doubted he’d ever look at the same again, stood up. “Honestly, you can’t actually believe he’s seen something! What utter rubbish!”
Draco had no qualms getting rid of the Dark stuff, but privately thought it was a waste to throw out everything else, as well. Just because Sirius had bad memories of the place didn't mean the heirlooms were any less valuable... So, he didn't fault Kreacher for sneaking around and trying to grab a few things.
History of Magic, as I’m sure you understand, is truly the most dull subject. Their teacher just drones and drones, so you can’t exactly fault Draco for falling asleep.
Breakfast is a tense affair. Draco can tell all of his housemates have already decided not to bother with him, which makes his chest tinge a little with hurt. No matter, though. He’s above these nerds - he’s a Malfoy.
Another round of cheers put a stop to their conversation. All of them turned to see the judges putting up the points for each contestant. Fleur had gotten twenty-five in total, and Krum forty. Diggory’s came next, with an impressive forty-seven. Draco held his breath, crossed his fingers and— “Forty-five points! You’re still tied for first!”
“Kind of,” says Potter. “I said I’d meet him at the Great Hall. He wants to show us the Christmas decorations he helped set up.”
“We only sit like that for important things. Like dinner with a governor or something,” Draco explains. He wants to be defensive, which is silly, since they’re just messing around. Still though, it’s his family they’re making fun of, and Draco loves them despite their various faults. “It’s better than slouching.”
For starters, Terry insisted on arriving early so they didn't risk missing anything. The other Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had a similar idea, and soon the corridor was filled with excited murmurs of what Professor Moody would have them be doing. Draco just hoped it wasn't anything practical, like the boggart that Lupin had shown them. He wasn't prepared to experience anything too traumatising this early into term.
“Alright. Sorry for wasting your time, Malfoy,” said Potter as he stepped outside. “See you around?”
From there, the lesson went rather smoothly. This lasted until Lupin decided it was time to actually use their new knowledge and had Draco go up first.
Draco stretches out, cracking his fingers and back. The sun is setting behind the perfectly shaped bushes down below, which casts a pink shadow across the roof of the Manor. It's a pretty sight and enough of an encouragement for him to stand and begin packing his necessary belongings. Starting with his robes, a set of silk pyjamas and a Muggle outfit Luna bought him, he carefully folded each item and put them in an order that ensured the best use of the trunk's space. Next, Draco packed his socks and some shoes, followed by his most recently bought journal, which is placed right at the top with a couple of other books. Once the trunk is clicked shut, he dragged it to the door and reclaimed his spot by the window.
And before Potter, Granger or even Weasley could call out, Draco runs. (He means Ron, by the way. There are so many of them, he’s not yet sure how to make the distinction in his head.)
"My father wanted me to go there." He scooped some vegetables onto his plate. "Though it was more likely I'd end up at Beauxbatons if Hogwarts wasn't an option. I mean, I don't even speak Russian!"
Frankly, Draco didn't know what to 'reckon'. He was so shocked at the discovery of having an actual cousin (not that third, twice-removed shit) who was semi-normal, he doubted he'd ever get another word out.
After the meeting was over, Draco ignored Granger whining about his inviting the Slytherin's— as if that was fair in any way. Just because they got saddled with some shitty family didn't mean they were less entitled to better education. Anyway, afterwards, Zabini wanted to speak with him alone. Draco went, if only to avoid Harry for a little while longer, who had been even madder about the Slytherin thing than Granger.
“It’s… extravagant,” Draco whispers. He snaps himself out of it and addresses Hagrid. “I’m assuming you brought the trees in?”
As Mrs Weasley bustled over to try and smooth out his hair, Harry mustered up a weak smile and said, "Thank you. Really."
Draco blinks. Potter’s face has turned all red like he’s the one that should be embarrassed. “You noticed all that?”
For reasons he cannot articulate to even himself, Draco hasn't moved from his spot by the window in hours. When he realises this, a burst of shame crawls along his legs, so he reaches out a hand, slowly, to the abandoned book near his feet.
"Then give it back to me," Draco snaps. He reac for Potter's bag and rips it open. Things flew from it, "Give it back, give it back, give it back."
Luna rested her cheek onto Draco’s shoulder, again. She was still half-asleep from her nap during the task. Harry looked embarrassed. “You shouldn’t’ve worried.”
The Gryffindor trio enter their own world after that. Draco is tempted to leave them to it, but he’s curious (stupid Ravenclaw habits), so he decides to stay, at least until curfew. He watches Granger disappear between one of the aisles and come back with a dusty old tomb. He watches them whisper, bouncing ideas off one another, but they all circle back to Snape. A feeling of dread curls in Draco’s stomach.
The party is in the dungeons, with a line of floating candles to guide them to the entrance. Draco links elbows with Luna and is giddy to discover the massive turnout. Ghosts surround them in every direction, from translucent soldiers to dancers that glow blue in the dark. He spots Potter on the opposite side of the room, near what appeared to be a table of rotten food.
Draco waited for some kind of reaction, but Potter just kept reading. He got to the last page in no time, and finally looked up. “Some of these seem really familiar, you know.”
Draco chuckles dryly at the comment, ignoring the betrayed look his father sends him. When his dreams had been at their worst, his parents became desperate and decided he was cursed with something. He hadn’t been, but it’s still a funny memory.
“Okay,” Draco says, sluggish. It takes them a long couple of minutes, as it’s dark and Severus can’t risk using his wand without dropping Draco, but eventually they find themselves knocking at the Hospital Wing’s shut doors. Pomfrey answers quickly, half-asleep in her pyjamas. She prepares a bed for him, asks Sev a few questions, and thankfully gives him a small bottle of sleeping draught.
She glanced up from her pile of rattling artefacts and stared at the pearl earrings dangling from his fingertips. "I wouldn't wear them."
Lucius reaches his hand into Ginny’s cauldron and pulls out one of the books Potter hadn’t gotten to replace before Draco arrived. It was battered, and obviously secondhand. “Clearly not. What’s the point of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they aren’t even going to pay you for it?”
Oh, Merlin. Another reason for Harry to fall hopelessly in love with her— everything about the girl was cute! Draco was sure if his own preferences didn't lean solely towards boys, he would find her just as breathtaking as the rest of the male-population at Hogwarts.
Severus disappears around the corner. Draco sighs, shoves his face into his hands and tries to put out the anger burning through him.
Predictably, Weasley choked on his bacon. Draco pretended this reaction didn’t discourage him, and simply poured a glass of pumpkin juice for himself. Harry, who sat beside him, looked mostly curious, and a bit worried. “Is something wrong?”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “At the Quidditch World Cup.” He explained the story of what had happened with the Dark Mark, and it being cast by Harry’s own wand. Draco hadn’t been told about
Finally, blessedly, Potter's hand is ripped from his own. Draco wipes the sweat that had gathered on his palm away. It's quiet for another moment, until Hagrid says, "You three should drop it, anyways. It's none of yeh business on what that dog's guarding."
In his third year, Draco left his dormitory and was attacked by one Pansy Parkinson’s lips. It had been his first and most horrible kiss. When she asked if he’d enjoyed it and he said, “No,” Pansy claimed the only reason why he wouldn’t have is because he’d’ve rather been kissing a boy. Never one to leave sleeping dragons lie, Draco had gone and found himself a boy to kiss instead. It was safe to say Pansy’s cockiness had turned out right for once.
Her face takes on a look of relief. “I’m meant to be meeting Cho for ice-cream, but they’ve given me more patients than usual today, and I don’t want to waste any time on minor injuries. Will you please, please take a few of them off my back, just for today?”
“As much as I appreciate you sticking up for me, Granger, my family is no longer a respected one and I shall not defend my ancestor’s actions against true accusations. I would say it’s what turned us all evil but really that was mother’s side.” Harry couldn’t help it, he let out a shocked laugh which earned him an amused look from Draco and a glare from Hermione. He tried to pass it off as a cough for Hermione.
“Oh yeah. He had a major crush on you. Couldn’t date a guy who liked my best mate.” Harry shuddered and turned back to the models. He rubbed his hands together and started pairing them up quicker than before. Eventually, after some help from his team, there was Malfoy left.
“That if there were more people,” Potter continued, settling on his knees and pulling Draco forward, away from the bed, by the shoulders, “I wouldn’t want to kiss you.”
“Ah,” Harry sat up to flip through some designs. “The while savour thing. Well,” Harry leaned over his desk so it came out more like a grunt than a word, “despite what you may think, I try not to let them treat me any differently. Besides, it’s my company. There’s no ‘they’ to lessen the workload.”
“Five years’ vegan and you ask me the same question every year. No, Harry.” He sighed and made a huge deal about standing up.
“What do you mean ‘it’s not me’?” He glanced up at Harry who had stood up to put the waistcoat on a different hanger.
“It might be if we weren’t at work.” Harry brushed off Draco’s question only to have it dumped back on his shoulders.
His room was clearly owned by someone who had never struggled for money. The bed was large, with silk pillowcases and soft sheets, pressed up against one of four grey walls. A tall cabinet rested near the door, filled with items that Draco hasn't touched for years. On top of the cabinet, a box of glittering jewellery and books were placed. In particular, a necklace from one Harry Potter— the rose pendant hanging off it had been rubbed at so often by Draco, its metal had gone an ugly dull.
“One of those Ravenclaw boys. The half-blood,” Severus explains. “I’d been on hall duty and he came running down, yelling about you having some kind of fit.”
Weasley sneers, but there’s a twinkle in his eye like he thought it was funny too that betrays him. “Malfoy…”
"Severus, don't be rash," Draco said, which was almost definitely the wrong thing to say. Snape hadn't so much at glanced at him during class, and probably would've preferred to kiss Sirius Black than get some sort of order from Draco.
“No, I mean, from the robe-shop,” Potter elaborated. “Don’t you remember? We met, and you saw Hagrid with the ice-cream. Did you know who I was, then?”
Only two of the boys are in the five-person dormitory, sitting upright in their beds and chatting. Draco collapses on his own blue canopy without care and ends up slipping right off. “Fuck.”
“That’s quite enough,” a new voice murmured. Draco blinked and watched Dumbledore take a step between them, like a shield. “Severus, I believe the Minister wishes to speak with you about tonight’s events. Mr Malfoy, walk with me.”
When the Duelling Club was announced, Draco couldn’t summon more than a halfhearted cheer. He’s always exhausted recently, and his marks have been reflecting that. If he were to attend the club, he’d probably only make a fool of himself.
He felt, inexplicably, like crying. It explained a lot, though— why his house has been ignoring him, why students he's never even met before seem afraid of him. They're all under the assumption that Draco's going to become a fucking Death Eater.
Draco thinks, and then remembers Ron and that other girl Potter mentioned. Harmony? Hermione? Whatever. It’s enough to remind him he shouldn’t be hanging around Harry Potter, and again he tries to walk away. Potter catches his arm, though.
Luckily, there weren't any sobs coming through the wall when he arrived. Draco put on his patient-face and swung the door open, purposefully swishing his robes as he did so.
Just as Draco begins to wonder what was happening, a new voice startles into his consciousness. A warm, determined voice that he’d learnt to recognise over the last few months.
“Why? Because you pathetically refuse to let go of some rivalry from your childhood? And now you’re letting it dictate the fate of an innocent man. What. Is. Wrong. With you?”
The bus gave a sudden lurch, and both Draco and Tonks fell off their seats and onto the sticky floor. He had just gotten up again when the bus turned, and he was right back down. "D'you reckon our clumsiness was inherited?" Tonks yelled over the increasingly loud complaints of the other passengers.
Over the next few days, Draco was tasked with cleaning out a few of the guest-rooms for when the Weasleys arrived. Professor Lupin would sometimes drop in to help— though he suspected there was an ulterior motive there, like visiting one Sirius Black— but for the most part, Draco's first week at Grimmauld Place was incredibly lonely, as Tonks was not kidding when she said the Order of the Phoenix kept her busy.
Their carriage jolted forward as Luna shut the door behind them, cutting him off. Draco swayed in his seat when they began moving down the road and passed the gates to the school grounds, which were drenched in utter darkness. The castle could be just seen up ahead, its countless windows dripping with orange candlelight. He gazed up at the flickering shadows for a while, before darting his attention back to the horses that drove them.
Frantic footsteps that weren't his own echoed in every crevice, every shadow. It hardly bothered Draco. He had been through worse.
“I’m on lunch break,” said Draco. He chucked his half-drunk coffee into the nearest bin and tried to walk away. He has no desire to spend the last ten minutes of lunch with Astoria-fucking-Greengrass who, although is very kind, almost exclusively talked about her girlfriend. Draco only gets about five steps away before she’s running after him, though. “Why are you following me?”
Not even a day had passed after Harry's arrival before Draco was made to play house-elf, again. Mrs Weasley was determined to have the house as clean as it could be, which meant waking early each morning to get it all done quicker. It was dull work, and only Granger's reproachful looks were enough to stop him from summoning Kreacher to do his bit, as the elf was determined to only follow his orders— in a way that was actually helpful, that is. Eventually, morning became noon and Mrs Weasley called for a lunch break. Draco noticed Harry and Black whispering between themselves at the Black family portrait, but ignored them in favour of grabbing some sandwiches off the tray that Mrs Weasley was keeping afloat with her wand. He joined Granger and Ron, who he ate with in silence.
Draco's breath came out sharp as he looked up and down at the creatures standing between each carriage shaft. They looked like the kind of horses that a dark wizard would want to ride, with their black wings and skeletal bodies. Still gaping, he turned back to see if anyone else was shocked at the sight of them, but it was only Harry who seemed to have noticed their presence at all. "What the fuck are those?"
He’s pretty sure there hasn’t been a Malfoy not in Slytherin for years, so it certainly isn’t ideal. Morgana, what will his father say? Probably something about family and expectations that Draco has undoubtedly not met. There’s probably a whole line of Black’s staring at him from their graves in disappointment, too. Yikes. He best start an apology letter as soon as possible.
Finally, Trelawney gave one final turn. She glanced in, then gasped and let out a scream. The students who had already been watching immediately huddled around their table. "Oh, goodness— my, boy, oh! You have, you have the
Potter laughs. “He hasn’t given anyone else tails, if that’s what you’re worried about,” he promises. “In fact, I was just with him before I saw you and Snape talking.”
“Yeah,” the boy replies, eyes flickering between Draco and the charmed tape measure whizzing around them.
The spider leapt from Moody's hand, and onto his desk. It moved in a dozen circles, surely making it dizzy, before doing a backflip. The class burst into laughter, though Draco couldn't even muster a weak smile. His father had claimed to be under that curse during the War, and for Moody to practically tell all his peers ... It was mean and unfair. Lucius had donated a lot of money to the Ministry to try and keep his trial hushed up, and it had almost worked until Rita Skeeter wrote an article about it. There was now a fair share of wizards who didn't believe the Imperius story— Draco didn't even, and he was the man's son.
knowledgeable on the subject, you know. He even looked after a three-headed dog last year. Yes, Father, maybe you’re right. I don’t need the book at all.”
“Perhaps, but I can count on one hand the number of accidental magic episodes I had before starting at Hogwarts. Now.” Draco stood suddenly. “Is that all you had to talk about? From what I’ve seen, there isn’t a thing wrong with Teddy.”
that. Because when he told us the answers, he basically called me an idiot in front of everyone. So, fine. You can say he’s not after the Philosopher’s Stone, that he doesn’t have it out for me, but you can’t say he’s good. He’s not. Snape is the worst kind of bad, and I would know. I’ve had a lot of experience with bad.”
Pushing past, Draco squeezed his way inside, vaguely aware of Harry and Ginny doing the same, Longbottom with a tad more hesitation. Luna was sat by the window, her copy of the Quibbler upside down in her pale hands. Grinning, he dropped into the space beside her, saying, "Hello, Luna. Do you mind if these idiots take some of these seats?"
Draco has hardly woken when his three Gryffindor’s make the noisiest entrance in history. Harry leads the front, eyes worried behind those ugly classes, while Granger and Weasley arrive not too far behind. Madam Pomfrey never stood a chance.
“You just said you don’t know who he is,” says Draco. “So what does it matter if I told Severus you guys happen to know Flamel’s name?”
“Then Harry had some kind of epiphany about the entrance being inside Myrtle’s bathroom, so we found Lockhart and went in. The place sort of crashed around us, though, which is why we were separated.”
"You must've visited before the last owner died," Severus said as they walked up the front steps. "I'd be surprised if you actually remember the inside, though."
His bed is pressed into the corner, with navy-blue sheets and far too many pillows. It’s in this bed that Draco collapsed for the day, feeling as settled as an ex-Death Eater could be with their life.
Immediately, the spider began to writhe in pain. Its hairy legs bent inwards and rolled over onto his back. Draco was sure if it had a voice, a loud screaming would've been echoing throughout the entire room. He hated it. "Stop!"
“That’s very progressive of her,” Draco agrees, thinking of his own father’s long hair and excessive ring collection. He can also recognise an olive branch when he sees one. The necklace is meant to make up for all those things they’d said to each other-- and it does, in a way, because it proves Potter is willing to make an effort. “Why the rose though?”
Draco leaned down to pet her, smiling apologetically when she cried out for breakfast. “I’m sorry, Hel. You finished the box last night. I’ll go and fetch some food from Diagon Alley now, or Hannah will kill me for starving us both to death.”
It continues like a memory, only with blanks in the narrative. Draco doesn’t know what diary it is that Riddle is yammering about (and something about a snake?), nor why he’s there in the first place. He had definitely not actually fallen into a Pensieve, and he doesn’t think Potter had gone up against
He could've laughed. Instead, Draco rolled his eyes, and shuffled past them all with his trunk, and murmured, "I'm gonna go find Luna. You coming, Harry? Ginevra?"
The ink fades into the paper. A pronounced frown sews itself on Draco’s face, deepening as the diary starts to write back.
Potter sat down beside him. He pulled the cloak off himself. "It's nice in here. Very blue. Pretty stars.”
His father guides him to the side of the crowd that has gathered inside the store. Apparently, some famous wizard is visiting, although Draco didn’t really care for celebrities. He’d never had much need for a role model.
"So you lied instead? Look, you don't owe me anything, but friends shouldn't keep stuff from each other. Not big stuff, anyway. Like, you were there for me when I was a wreck about Black. I wanted to kill him."
"Right on," Moody was saying. He scribbled the answer onto an old blackboard, and said, "You don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse."
"It's good to see you again, Draco," Terra said when the session began. She poured him a cup of tea. "When I found out about the dementors at Hogwarts, I was very worried about a lot of the students! My daughter, Daphne, wrote to me and said Harry Potter faints whenever he comes close to one. Not a surprise, really, knowing
It’s been three years now since he became a Healer for St Mungos, so Draco knew the corridors well. He reached the room number scribbled in hasty scrawl at the bottom of Edward’s files in minutes.
Dumbledore glanced at the maze. The creases near his eyes had tightened the longer Draco spoke, and when he looked back down at him, it was quite clear that he believed him. “Very well. I find it impolite to cut our talk short, but it’s important for me to fetch Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape.”
The sound of turning pages flipped through the room. Potter grabbed a second notebook and landed on another dream he recognised, “And I suppose this is a coincidence, too? Why didn’t you say you’d dreamed about Riddle before any of it even happened?”
For starters, he’s the boy. The one from his dreams, the one from the robe shop. It’s such an unlikely coincidence, but also makes complete sense. Draco reasons that he must’ve seen a picture of Potter’s parents years before, and his mind created a mix of them to use as a character in his nightmares. He didn’t entirely believe this theory, but it’s better than the alternative-- that he had somehow known what Potter looked like without ever having met him.
Luna insists she needs to ready herself for bed, despite it still being early. Her roommates like to play pranks on her otherwise, like stealing her clothes or hiding her school stuff in random cupboards. It’s nasty business, but Draco knows it’s not his responsibility to intervene. Not yet, anyway. So he went up to bed himself and pulled his diary out. He’s only about half a paragraph in when things turn black.
He woke at the usual early hour and donned his lime-green robes, using a Cleaning Charm for his teeth to save time.
Potter shakes his head. “He isn’t bothering me. Not really. I’m just worried. How does a house-elf even know so much about the Chamber of Secrets? Ron reckons your dad helped open it, and that’s what all the attacks are.”
"Anyone in here knows which curses are the most heavily punished by wizarding law?" Moody asked, after rambling on about curses for a good ten minutes.
Once Draco’s showered and in a Muggle turtleneck and jeans, he headed for the kitchen and conducted a half-hearted search in his cupboards. He already knew there wasn’t any food in the house though, since he hasn’t quite kicked the habit of simply assuming a house-elf will come and restock it for him.
Before the year started, Snape had given him a note that would allow Draco to visit Madam Pomfrey in the night without getting in trouble for sneaking around past midnight— mostly due to his mother's insistence. Draco hadn't wanted to use it, but on one particularly restless night in January, he crept out of his dormitory and headed for the Hospital Wing, note held tightly in his hand.
“Don’t try anything,” Draco found himself saying. His voice didn’t sound like his own. It was protective, brave. “You’ll have to go through us first.”
The sound of a new voice startles Draco from his musings. He glances over at the new incomer and promptly falls off the stool. Ouch.
make sense. But, Draco still had bloody morals. And, also, maybe, an unrequited crush on his best friend... "No. Absolutely not."
He grabbed a jacket from the floor, and tucked his wand inside one of the pockets. A crash sounded somewhere nearby. Draco steeled himself and ran right into the chaos. Immediately, he was swallowed by a crowd of terrified people.
They stop outside their destined shop. Lucius’ nostrils flare like they always do when Draco says something out-of-place. “I am not
Nobody moved. Draco resisted the urge to throw up a rude hand signal and stormed over to the entrance of the cave. As soon as he was hidden from view, he dashed away the tears on his cheeks and ran for Hogwarts castle. He had no inclination to stay for any longer than needed.
When he woke up, there was sunlight glaring through the window and a high ringing coming from somewhere beside him. Draco groaned and rolled onto his stomach, stuffing his face into the nearest pillow.
“Why aren’t you in class?” Sev replied in his ‘I’m-teaching-you-have-to-leave’ voice. “Nevermind, I’ll speak to you at lunch, Mr Malfoy.”
been simple, yet Draco still wished Potter had had a reason to stay for a bit longer. Suddenly annoyed, he pushed himself up and returned to work.
Draco took a deep breath and blocked out everyone around him. He thought of how he felt after his most terrible dreams, the fear in his veins. He focused on the swirling white fog inside the orbs and Saw... “What the fuck?”
Granger’s bushy head enters Draco’s line of sight. Her nose is scrunched, indecision sewed in her furrowed eyebrows. She exchanges a glance with Harry. “I’m not sure, Malfoy. What if you run off and tell Snape?”
"Welcome to Divination, my children," the teacher said, clasping her hands together. "My name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before, as I find that being around the main bustle of the school tends to cloud my Inner Eye."
She squeezed her eyes shut, scrunched up her nose, and all-around just looked to be in pain. Slowly, her blue hair faded into a silvery grey, and her face created wrinkles from seemingly thin air. Draco, gaping, said, "You're a Metamorphmagus?"
Draco blinked, and finally took a proper look at who he was talking with. It was Blaise Zabini. He had his usual look of his distaste in his brown eyes, like everything was beneath him, though it seemed less pronounced. His cheekbones were sharp and overall handsome. "Um."
Snape's hands dropped back to his sides. Draco let out a relieved breath and watched his godfather step back down to their level. "I merely thought that Potter should be heading back to bed. For - for his own safety."
“Are you insane, Potter?” he mutters into his neck. “You all of all people should know I don’t do hugs!”
Trelawney stood behind Draco and placed two hands on the side of his face. Her golden bangles were cold on his cheeks. “Clear your mind, child, keep your thoughts empty.”
"So. You have decided to study the art of Divination, although I now realise some of you—" Here, she sent a meaningful glance in Draco's direction. "have already begun to unveil the mysteries of the future. This gift is extraordinarily rare."
"The Killing Curse is not something you can avoid with a Shield Charm. If you ever encounter it, you dodge. No spell blocks it."
Terry patted Draco's shoulder, "You're sounding a bit like a blood supremacist there. I'd reign it in if I were you."
“What triggered it?” Severus asks. He sounds merely curious, but Draco reads the meaning behind his words. He’ll need an explanation for Draco’s parents, since the school will be contacting them about his visit to the Hospital Wing. “Well?”
A wizard with greasy hair appears behind the counter, his broad shoulders droopy and his face covered in dirt. “Ah! Mr Malfoy, what an absolute pleasure it is to see you. And you’re brought your son along, too… I hope you haven’t come here to accuse me of cursing him again, have you?”
"Harry is coming over," Luna said. A couple of dirty blonde strands had fallen from her hairdo, framing her youthful face very prettily.
Draco stood up and rushed down the middle of the crowd. Luna followed after a moment of hesitating, and soon the two were talking with the four champions and their rescued persons on the ground.
“It’s probably just a simple jinx. Anyway, thanks for this, Healer Malfoy. See you for dinner tomorrow night!”
Abruptly, Potter stops. Draco doesn’t notice and continues walking. “So no, my father would never-- Potter? Are you alright?”
Another tiny noise came from the step that Draco knew would often Vanish. None of the others noticed it, as Snape had started on about how somebody had broken into his office. Moody was arguing back.
He glanced back over at that step and was quite sure Harry was stuck there. "Get to bed, Snape," Moody said, bringing Draco's attention back to the three men. "And you've dropped something, by the way."
Draco could remember, now. He’d spent the last month of his life hiding from Potter, even after Granger was petrified. That was around when he realised who had actually been behind all the starks. Resisting Riddle’s diary was too difficult even once he’d figured it out, though. He vaguely recalls a handsome boy erupting from the pages before… blackness.
“Look at this one.” He shoved the book at Draco and pointed to a line that spoke of green eyes and baby dragons. “You’ve practically rewritten exactly what happened to Hagrid’s old pet, Norbert. But— no one ever told you about that. Not properly, at least.”
Potter dropped a tender hand on the boy’s shoulder, appearing troubled. “Teddy is a Metamorphmagus, but he’s not been able to change anything since early last night. I think it might be a side-effect of one of George’s newest inventions that were left lying around.”
Draco turned his back on them, walking down the narrow aisle between two lines of seats. There’s a family of goblins huddled together in the front, and a pair of Aurors playing Exploding Snap over a circle-shaped table near the window. Draco found a seat in the back, purposefully out of view from the Aurors. Through the glass, his cottage sped out of view in a blur of green and blue.
Teddy shook his head. Draco smiled and continued, “Well, do you think that might be the issue? When exactly did the problem start? Around dinner, before bed …”
“Both Granger and Weasley are missing. Surely Harry isn’t meant to rescue both of them!” He was mostly speaking to himself, now. If that was indeed the task, it made sense that Harry hadn’t come back, yet. Perhaps, if he was supposed to rescue two students, then he’d be awarded extra points. That would be the only way for it to be fair. “Maybe... maybe...”
He hadn’t been able to find Granger and Weasley that morning. The two had been absent during breakfast, as well as Cho, whose friends had been worrying all the way to the Great Lake. Draco had been, too... He really hoped Harry wasn’t dead, having drowned or frozen to death as soon as he jumped in.
His fingers curl around the spine. It's a copy of Omens, Oracles & The Goat by Bathilda Bagshot, which Draco had gotten as a late birthday gift from Sev. He's had no inclination to read about the history of Divination, though, and had only given it the barest of his attention before losing interest.
Weasley and Harry showed up with the Patil sisters. Both couples looked supremely uncomfortable, which set both Draco and Luna into another fit of giggles.
As they bickered, Draco took the time to admire the place. Although, perhaps admire wasn't the right word. He was more sneering at every little decoration, as the interior ranged from age-blackened portraits to a chandelier covered in cobwebs. There was also a terrible stench of piss. "It's disgusting in here. Walburga had house-elves, didn't she?"
Harry shot a look at Tonks, Lupin and Sirius, who all sat at the end of the table, talking amongst themselves. Then, "Not really. I keep thinking, you know, what if the next time I come back here I've got no wand, or... or future at Hogwarts?"
Draco rubs his thumb over the rose pendant hanging on his neck. He enjoys wearing Potter’s necklace under his robes, where the metal can lay cold against his skin. It acts as a comfort, a reminder that in spite of everything, things could turn out alright.
Draco hugged his knees to his chest. "They're not so bad. Dumbledore doesn't let them inside the castle or anything."
“I was getting to that.” Draco pulled a chair from the corner of the room and dropped into it, crossing his legs. “A child his age rarely has much control over their magic, so I’d guess it’s a simple incident of accidental magic— but in reverse. Perhaps Teddy was feeling a bit stressed from the number of guests, and his abilities reacted accordingly. If the problem persists, I can prescribe some Calming Draughts. But, for now, I recommend for him to get some sleep and to avoid any crowds.”
“Sell?” Borkin chokes on a gross laugh. He pushes away the box Lucius had placed on his counter and says, “I don’t do business with you anymore, Malfoy. You’re either buying or leaving. Whether it’s at your own will or not doesn’t matter to me.”
“As long as you don’t tell a teacher about it either,” Granger adds. “We aren’t meant to know anything about it.”
This compliment put a dark blush onto his cheeks, which Draco quickly blamed on the stifling heat. It wasn't like what Harry had said carried any real merit, as Draco couldn't really control what he saw, and most of the time the visions seemed to be set years in the future—in other words: useless— but. Still. He was a sucker for flattery. "Oh, please. I'd be as useless as her."
Draco stole another glance inside the classroom. Umbridge had started waving her wand and pushing all the chairs in from her spot at her desk, which seemed a bit stupid. Students were about to arrive and mess it all up, again, anyway.
Umbridge clenched her jaw, narrowing her eyes, before seemingly scribbling an entire paragraph onto her clipboard. Finally, she stepped toward Draco— he held his breath— and shoved a piece of parchment his way. "You will take that to your head of house immediately, thank you."
As if summoned, a smattering of Ravenclaw's came into Draco's line of sight. They all stopped short when they saw him, and silence fell over the hall. Terry stood near the back of the group, staring down at the floor. Draco felt a fierce urge to strangle them all, but could not come up with a reasonable excuse as to why. Stamping these feelings down, Draco sent a rueful smile at Goldstein, who only stared back.
Draco licked his lips, belatedly realising that his attempt to stop crying had failed. His cheeks were wet.
Nobody else in the classroom notices his distress, which allows him to count to ten without an audience. His heart is hammering far too fast to be healthy, and the inside of his nose burns with panic. Draco starts packing up his things strewn across the desk.
They served a more variety of dishes than usual, for the feast. Draco tried a little of everything because his palette always got so dull when he went to school. Luna was a large fan of a French pudding that popped into existence on their area of the table.
Draco, of course, already knew what these notices would be about. Still, he placed his chin in his hand and listened.
He let out a breath. Potter tapped his fingers on his knee. An uncomfortable silence settled over them. Then, "You'll think I'm mad if I tell you. Everyone else who knows does."
Draco shook his head, grinning. Their conversation was interrupted when the Sorting hat broke into song; it went on and on with warnings, and suggestions that the school would do better united than divided in these times. Draco thought he had a pretty good idea why it had decided to branch out this year, but didn't voice it, for McGonagall started calling out the names of first-years as soon as silence fell over the hall, again.
He squeezes his eyes shut and shakes his head. Draco is tired everywhere and feels sure that if he were to stand, he’d die or something equally as dramatic. “That’s alright. Would you like some water?”
“Language!” a voice chides, goodnaturedly. Draco glances over from his new spot on the floor to find a hand offered out to him. He takes it, recognising Terry Boot as the one helping him up. “You’re Draco, right?”
"Er, non. Je suis English, désolé," Draco said, the words unfamiliar in his mouth. She giggled, probably due to his horrible accent. "Au revoir?"
He resisted the urge to hex her. Cho was a perfectly nice girl, if a bit boy-crazy. Unfortunately, Harry fancied her, which obviously was enough to erase all those positive qualities and leave Draco with a burning jealous whenever they spoke. "Is that so? Well— well, go on, then!"
It was true. After that first Astronomy lesson, Potter never made any more attempts at speaking with him. Draco just assumed his Gryffindor friends had told him all about the evil Malfoy family, and Potter rightfully gave up. This is a nice surprise, though. It even cheers him up a bit.
The doors to the Great Hall banged open, just as a rumble of thunder rippled through the room. Draco swivelled around in his seat and saw a man stood in the doorway. He was leaning on a long staff, and was more shadow than person, what with the black travelling cloak pulled over his shoulders. Draco watched him begin to walk up towards the teachers' table, a clunk ringing through the hall with each of his steps.
He feels himself flush. The other boy, Michael Corner, joins in, then. “I always thought Pureblood families would sit like this.” He makes his back go grossly straight and tucks his hands into his lap as if they were doing a family portrait. Draco rolls his eyes. “Obviously I was wrong.”
"No! I just never got around to cutting it. I don't think that's it, though. Look around! I feel like everyone is scared of me or something."
He had informed Luna of everything that transpired the previous year. For some reason, he already trusts her, and she’s always ready to listen. Nobody else at Hogwarts finds her anything other than looney, but Draco knows there’s more to her than that. The Sorting Hat placed her into Ravenclaw for a specific purpose, and though she was definitely intelligent, it isn’t the sole reason. It wasn’t with Draco after all-- something he also confessed to her. The hat’s words often come to him at random moments.
Another voice answers for him. “He was sleeping, Professor. I think he was having a nightmare, because he started yelling.”
"You heard me, Malfoy. If we date, we can graduate Hogwarts with some experience under our belts. This is a chance of a lifetime, there aren't any other boys who would be up to your parent's standards."
"That you're queer," said Zabini casually. Draco let out a breath. That was hardly a secret, anymore. He'd been slowly telling people since the Yule Ball, last year. Harry first, then Granger and Weasley, Severus... Luna had always known, so she was the easiest to come out to. "And don't deny it. I noticed last year."
Snape hesitated. They stopped in the middle of the hall, and Snape turned him so they were facing each other. “I told him about your status as a Seer.”
The afternoon before his roommates are to leave is also the afternoon that Severus finally speaks to him outside of class. The man has always been rather cold with Draco-- except for that year his nightmares were especially bad-- so he’s unsure of how the interaction will go. Probably not great, considering Severus doesn’t even care enough to acknowledge him during Potions. Sometimes he wonders why his parents made Sev his godfather in the first place.
He doesn’t get a chance to speak with Potter until lunch. He spent the morning in Transfiguration with McGonagall, and then wasted another hour in DADA, which Gilderoy Lockhart is now for some reason teaching. The man is a complete buffoon! He made them all do a ridiculous quiz about his
Granger had stopped listening, though. She’d moved onto flipping through his book. Her nose starts doing the thing where it scrunches up like she couldn’t decide whether to be interested or disgusted by what she is reading.
"Have you got your permission slip signed?" Granger asked in late October, the evening before their first Hogsmeade weekend.
Granger shakes him awake as they pull into Hogsmeade station, urging him to change into his robes, while Luna is busy tucking her wand behind her ear.
“Just watch.” Potter pulls the watery thing around himself and disappears. Draco hears a gasp that must have come from his own mouth. He reaches toward the place Potter became invisible, but he’s gone. “I’m here now.”
He curled a hand around Luna’s wrist and tugs her toward the exit. As soon as they're gone from view, the pair run in the direction of Ravenclaw tower, giggling and yelling the entire way. Draco is sure that at that moment he’s never had a friend like her.
Professor Lupin pursed his lips, then nodded to himself. "Alright. When I pull out the drawers, the boggart will manifest itself into a basilisk. I need you to think about one of those skinny balloons, that can be tied into animals. Got it? Yes? Let's go."
Leaving, the morning air hit him in the face, harsher than it had been before. He looked down each side of the street and decided to make a last detour for a fresh box of cigarettes. Draco doesn’t smoke often, but it’s good to have some handy.
It was too late. Snape was smart, and was already putting it together as Draco had. He kept darting his head from the golden egg that Filch had picked up, to the map that Moody was now holding. It was a little like watching something from a movie. "Potter."
He guesses he’d been sitting like that for ten minutes before somebody familiar and grounding appeared next to his ear. “Draco, you must count to ten. Do you mind if I touch you?”
He can’t respond. He’s too busy staring over her shoulder. The boy who had entered the shop was the same boy from his dreams. Those green eyes, the horrible hair, the glasses-- all of it! He’s wearing a Muggle shirt with sleeves that fall past his wrists, and grey pants that looked to be three sizes too big, since the only thing stopping them from falling was an ugly old belt.
“It’s really, really important.” Draco stared at Dumbledore and allowed all his desperation to enter his face. It worked immediately. Maxime shut up, looking concerned herself, and the other men avoided his eye. “Please, Professor.”
Draco nodded hurriedly, and they went over. He caught Luna watching a little worriedly, and tried for his best smile. She focussed back on the maze.
They don’t calm down by Christmas. Draco receives a note from his mother two days before the holidays are scheduled to begin, with only a few words written on it in her elegant cursive. He’s forbidden from going home. He pretends not to cry himself to sleep that night.
Draco rolled his eyes and took a dainty sip of his drink. "I'm planning your untimely demise. What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?"
"Not just that," Potter said. "Fred and George gave me this map of Hogwarts. It's got a bunch of secret passageways and tells me where everyone is at."
Draco was still tying his hair back when he came flying out from the Healer fireplace and onto St Mungo's floor, decidedly more covered in soot than he’d like to be. He ignored any looks he got from colleagues as he began his trek to the ground floor.
"Stupid— fucking— book," he muttered and threw it in the direction of his bed. It landed just short, and fell to the floor. He rolled his eyes, not bothering to go and pick it up.
With a click of Dumbledore's fingers, food appeared on the four tables. Draco wasted no time in grabbing himself a plate of roast beef and mashed potato. When the main course was cleared, the castle served them ice-cream, various pies, and a couple of chocolate-looking things that he quickly took. Once he'd finished stuffing himself, Boot started blabbering on about the fourth-year curriculum.
"I, um..." Draco looked over Moody's shoulder. "I get nightmares sometimes, and Madam Pomfrey gives me Dreamless Sleeps when I really need it."
“No!” Draco says, pushing away the memories of waking up with bruises from knocking into things the day before and falling over bumps in the road outside the Manor. “It was an accident.”
had unexpected written all over it. Really, what kind of ice-cream was Astoria getting that was worth owing a favour to a Slytherin? Though, it might be more about the company she’s getting it with …
“This probably doesn’t help, but it’s good that Teddy’s magic is so out-of-control at the moment. It’s been widely established in the wizarding community that children with more bouts of accidental magic tend to have stronger control over their magic in later years,” Draco said slowly. “I mean, think about your childhood. I’m sure you can remember many incidents where your magic went ‘haywire’ as you put it.”
At breakfast the next morning, the school turns into a nervous frenzy after somebody overhears McGonagall speaking with Flitwick about a student being attacked in the same way Filch's cat had been. None of the professors deny, which is enough proof it had happened.
He turned and revealed three jars sat on his desk. Each one had a spider inside. Moody waved his wand, and the one in the middle grew larger and larger, till it was about the size of a small dog. "Pay attention. This curse was very popular at one point in the War..."
They abandoned his search for chocolate frogs and found a compartment with Boot and Corner, quickly joining a conversation about whether Arithmancy would be a better class than Ancient Runes. (Luna opened up the latest Quibbler, instead.) Draco must have fallen asleep at some point because when he woke up it much was darker outside the window, and colder inside the train.
Potter wants to go, though. He slips Draco a note during Astronomy on whether he’d like to meet up beforehand. They still haven’t had that talk about why all of his carefully crafted letters went ignored over the holidays, but it was bound to happen eventually. Draco decides if Potter is too busy dreaming about duelling, they could get through the chat quickly.
Lupin led them into an abandoned classroom when he finally showed up, where a single set of drawers was rattling in the corner. A few students jumped back.
A harsh intake of breath has Draco glancing worriedly at his father, but the man is busy staring resolutely at a spot on the wall.
"What the fuck!" he screeched. "How are you here? I thought— of course. I should've realised you'd use your invisibility cloak."
Draco stared down at his expensive shoes. "It takes away the victim's free-will, and gives total control to the castor."
“You most certainly can not!” Draco said, clutching the diary to his chest, cheeks pink. “The future must be kept secret, you fiend!”
Draco breathes in once, twice, and back out. He counts to ten in his head, barely resisting the urge to punch Potter in his annoying face. The two others stand to the side of them, waiting; watching. “You must be fucking delusional, then.”
Potter rolls his eyes. “You would love to be me. Don’t deny it,” he teases. Draco resists the urge to stick out his tongue. “Malfoy, can we please talk about the letters now? I know it seems like I might’ve ghosted you, but--”
A new thought occurs to him as he looks at his surroundings. “Are we in the fucking Chamber of Secrets right now? Ugh, it’s disgusting.”
“Because it scares me!” Draco shrieked. He grabbed the diaries back and placed them back under his bed. “If my dreams are meant to come true, then what about the really bad ones? The ones of war, and my fucking godfather bleeding out in front of me? When I told Severus about that, he said I was wasting his time with silly stories! That’s why I, I even go to the therapy sessions! They manage to convince me I’m only paranoid, if only for a few hours.”
He swore. It was immature enough to be jealous of Cho, who Harry actually fancied, let alone a stupid Weasley. The two were best friends— brothers, even. It made sense for Weasley to be the thing that Harry would miss the most. In fact, it was almost sweet, in a way. Only... Why not Draco? They were just as close, weren’t they?
"Yeah, probably." Draco laid down and turned his head so he could face Luna as he slept. She did the same.
The boy grins, moves to reply, but then Madam Malkin taps him on the shoulder to say, “That’s you done, sweetie.” She pulls off his new set of robes off him, and the boy ends up having to settle on shooting a small, almost secretive smile at Draco.
When Saturday dawned on them, the sun was weak and not particularly helpful, so Draco pulled a thin cloak over his shoulders and hoped it wouldn’t rain. He’d spent the night before explaining to Luna that he wasn’t abandoning her, just running an errand. She knew he was going to spend the day with Harry though, and didn’t need much convincing.
Draco wanted to curse him. "You're mad! What would Potter be doing out of bed? You know I was getting my potion, or do you think I was lying about that?"
"Malfoy?" Granger said, incredulously. She lent him a hand to get up with, which Draco took gratefully. Weasley had stood up on his own, and was now brushing away dirt on his red pyjama trousers. "What are you doing here?"
On February twelve, Draco resigned himself to missing a second Hogsmeade trip for another appointment with Terra. They talked about utterly meaningless things for the hour, and when he finally got back to Hogwarts, he was ready to climb into bed and forget the rest of the world. His plans were interrupted by an invisible Harry Potter, who knocked right into him and pushed them both to the floor.
"So, what? I'm not meant to go to Hogsmeade without a permission slip signed, yet I still went, anyway."
The village turned out lovely. Draco spent his first hour wandering into shops to find things he could buy for Luna's Christmas present. Just as he'd been deciding whether she'd prefer a box of Jelly Slugs or some Peppermint Toads, Potter's head popped up beside him.
Draco wishes he hadn’t asked to be part of this. He wants to go back to Malfoy Manor and pretend he’s not a Ravenclaw yet, pretend there’s still hope for his Slytherin qualities to win out. He wants to cuddle with his mother while Father reads books to them, the sun slowly setting to give the moon an opportunity to glow. Draco yearns to be small and stupid and not have to deal with any of this. He never should’ve fucking asked.
Standing and tapping at the window is a giant of a man, with a tangled beard and messy brown hair that hides half his face. His eyes, however, are small and kind compared to the rest of him. The man is smiling at Green-Eyes and gesturing at two ice-creams in his hands in a way that Draco supposes means he isn’t allowed inside.
"Why is that boy so wet?" Luna asked no one in particular, staring over at the Gryffindor table, where a tiny first-year had just sat down at. He was dripping all over the floor, buzzing with excitement ... or the cold.
Weasley hurries off. Pomfrey began fixing up his leg. Draco bites down on the pain and clutches at Potter’s hand.
"I'll just be heading to bed, now." Snape gave each one of them another glare, and sauntered off down the hall, black dressing gown billowing behind him.
"Meet our newest staff member, Professor Moody," Dumbledore said into the silence. "He will be teaching DADA."
Draco rolled his eyes and looked over his shoulder. The Gryffindor's were huddled on the opposite side of the Hog's Head together, looking a little worried, now.
Weasley’s rant stopped. He was staring over Potter’s shoulder, mouth dropped open in a comical O. Draco spun around, and with a lasting bang, the door snapped shut. A man emerged from the shadows, black hair grew out to his elbows, and arms so thin they looked like they belonged on a corpse. Worst of all, he was grinning.
Tapping his chin, he thought. Draco went through a mental checklist, and then remembered— "Hold on! Let me just..." and, wrapping his fist around Potter's necklace, Draco said, "Now I have everything. Where are you taking me?"
Draco despised Harry Potter, and whoever else decided it was a good idea for a second-year with practically
“I bet you’re hungry. You are, aren’t you?” He scratched at that one spot behind her ear. “Come on, then. I’ll get you your dinner.”
There was a loud pop, and when Draco took his next step, he tumbled over an elf that looked on the verge of tears. Either from sadness or joy, he didn't know.
A bell chimes when they enter the shop. There’s an old man bustling about that must be Ollivander, since he whirls around when the door snaps shut and quickly pins his pale, translucent eyes on Draco.
"It's a powerful curse, that. You could all try to point your wands at me and say the words, but the worse thing I'd get would be a nose-bleed. Of course, none of that matters. I'm not here to show you how to do it, but to have you appreciate what the worse truly is."
"That's what I thought," said Umbridge, tutting slightly. "If neither you or Professor Trelawney can predict something for me, I'm afraid I'll have to..."
? That time he disguised himself as a house-elf for a super dangerous, top-secret Auror mission. Obviously. Alas, Draco only got one thing right.
He flinched and ended up banging his foot against the table's leg. A blast of pain shot up his calf, and Draco barely was able to muffle his own shout. "What the hell did you have to sneak up on me for, mate? You fucking scared me!"
"Well, you could be with me, then," said Zabini, crossing his arms over his chest. "It makes sense, no? Our parents know each other, we're both Pureblood and you're handsome enough."
Voices whispered around him. He ignores them, and continues to rock back and forth. He imagines his mother’s soft hand running back and forth through his hair, and his father’s reassurances.
Severus taps a rhythm onto Draco’s shoulder as he thinks. Draco focuses on it, hoping it distracts him from everything. It works, sort of. The words from his dream at least backs away from the front of his mind. “It hasn’t happened before?”
A moment later, the trapdoor flung open, only it wasn't a student this time. Umbridge revealed her self entirely, rather ungracefully, with a clipboard and quill in her hands. The class fell silent at once. Unaffected, Umbridge said to Trelawney, "I trust you got my note about inspecting your class, today?"
Draco sticks his left arm in the air. Ollivander then measures from Draco’s shoulder to little finger, wrist to elbow, knee to armpit, and eventually around his head. He didn’t really know what all that has to do with getting a wand, but Ollivander must’ve been doing this for years and probably wouldn’t do something just for the fun of it - hopefully. “Let me think… Yes.”
Draco did so without question, and as he thought about the address written onto the note, a multi-storied house appeared, placed snugly between the homes numbered 'eleven' and 'thirteen'. He immediately worked out what had happened. "A Fidelius Charm! That's brilliant. Hey, wait, I've been here before."
Draco lowers his head, ashamed. They lapse into a short silence. “I was under the impression you weren’t having panic attacks anymore.”
He shook his head, waving a careless hand for them to sit. Weasley took the window seat, Granger beside him.
Draco pursed his lips, looked down at Ron’s still figure, and began levitating him up the hill they were on.
“Chicken?” said Sirius, pulling the newspapers from his mouth. All of them tugged open their bags and revealed drumsticks and bread inside. Draco had nicked his own horde at dinner the previous night. “Thanks. I’ve had to rely on rats, mostly. This is a welcome change.”
Harry’s hands tighten into angry fists. “You’re really that blind? Snape is a horrible person. Do you know what he did to me in my first potions class? He insulted me, badgered me with questions that almost no one in the room could answer. I didn’t even know I was a wizard before last year, let alone the difference between stupid monkshood and wolfsbane!”
Draco put on a mask of the utmost innocence. “Feel free to correct me, Miss Granger, but I think it's for reading. Oh, yes, how interesting!” He turned to a page dedicated to the most recent winner of the Most Charming Smile award. “Gregory Cotton? Never heard of him, though I can see... Ah, what’s this?”
A little bit later, Severus arrived in the Hospital Wing with Potter and Granger floating along behind him. They were passed out.
“Yes, but he doesn’t know we know who he is,” Potter explains gently. Then he turns back to Hermione. “See? Draco won’t tell.”
With Harry's presence, Draco was sure that they were getting more and more visitors with the more time that passed. Several times a day the doorbell would ring, which then prompted Draco's great aunt Walburga to start screaming her head off from her portrait downstairs. It was torture in the most amusing form.
a drama-free term. When Draco got back to Hogwarts, he quickly realised that Granger's fight with Weasley had gotten worse, as it now seemed to include Potter as well. He'd gotten a Firebolt for Chrismas, only for it to be taken away that same day. Such poor luck. Though, Draco didn't really blame Granger for wanting to turn it in. Potter hasn't had much luck in Quidditch so far, and it very well could be cursed.
"Oh. You're not? I'm not totally sure, but it seems unlikely for the Potter family to have Slytherin blood in them. Not impossible, obviously. But..."
Sometime in March, Draco seated himself at the Gryffindor table, with no protection except for his confidence. The seventh-years, sat a couple of seats further along, paid no attention, but the rest of the house did. It became very apparent to him at that moment, that perhaps Hogwarts should put less effort into inter-school cooperation, and more into inter-house cooperation. “Nice day, isn’t it?”
Potter wants to show him something after supper, and they head in the direction of what Draco supposes must be Gryffindor tower. He waits by the Fat Lady’s portrait as Potter runs up to grab whatever it is.
“Oh, I got you something!” he says abruptly, rummaging through the pockets of his pants. Draco waits patiently. “There you go. A late birthday present.”
He pushed his chair backwards, forcing Trelawney to move with it. She hissed questions at him, unconcerned about the students around them. Draco breathed in through his mouth, out through his nose. “What have you seen? What was it? Was it the Grim? What have you seen?”
, almost killed yourself in the process, all before Riddle drained my life source beyond repair. Should I be thanking you?”
Before she could answer, Luna sat down in the seat beside Draco. Her wand was placed behind her ear, and she was wearing a new charm around her neck. Neither Draco or Granger commented on it, as they were used to her strange accessories by now. "Have you two read the new Quibbler article yet?"
"I envy you, then," said Severus. "The Knight Bus is a filthy form of transportation. Terribly unhygienic, and the conductor is one of the most annoying people I have ever met—Come
“That Fleur Delacour girl kissed us,” Harry explained. “Um. On the cheek, I mean. She was very grateful for us helping her sister.”
As they grabbed and swallowed down a few cups of punch, Draco admired the pretty decorations around the room. It was like a snow kingdom, with the towering trees and ice-covered walls. Hogwarts had gone all out.
The story is weird. Draco instantly believes it’s true when Potter mentions Dobby, though. “That meddling elf! Oh, what my father would do if he found out…”
Inside, it was warmer and louder. Torches lined the halls that they all walked through, and once they'd made it to the Great Hall, the students' voices rose even higher in volumes. People called out greetings and spoke eagerly with those surrounding them. Draco waved at the Gryffindors before drifting off to the Ravenclaw table with Luna, who'd already started a running commentary about her newfound passion for sewing. He listened with an alert ear but got distracted by a group of girls giggling behind their hands at him. A well-done scowl shut them up, though it didn't shut off the bad feeling that had stirred in Draco's gut.
He’d picked up smoking from Blaise in sixth year. He and Pansy had fucked off to America after the war, but the habit persists. Draco preferred not to think of them, so he cleared his throat and moved to finish his visit to Diagon Alley.
The window looked out over the Manor's gardens. As a child, he would often stick his head out as far as he could, simply to get a whiff of the roses and wet soil down below. On this evening in June, Draco has only glanced outside once, instead keeping his eyes on the bedroom door, where Severus Snape would be arriving in a little under an hour if everything goes according to plan. If it didn't... He doesn't want to think about it.
"The final curse," Moody whispered, "is the most deadly. Only one person has survived it, and he goes to this very school.
I'm just touching his inner thigh now, Delicate, featherlike strokes. It must be admitted that I have been caressing other parts of his body for over an hour, but always only small teasing caresses - the tips of my fingers and my lips – so so soft until his nerves are afire. His body quivers as I drift my fingers lightly over his abdomen, and then trail them down one leg, avoiding the area he wants me most ... I whisper to him wickedly, "Patience, baby, patience," as I lick a wide circle of skin around one nipple, and then I drag my tongue down his body until I reach his navel, fucking it hard. His dick jerks and bumps against my cheek, and I can make him moan just by breathing on it.
I have the fucking Boy-Who-Lived in my shower, shivering in spite of the hot water because I have three fingers buried deep in his arse as I suck him, inhaling his eight inches like it's meant to live in my throat, feeling him quake and quiver, and swallowing his seed like it’s the water of life.
, only my Harry; and it is my touch that does it - that pushes him to the limit, dances with him on the edge of oblivion, sends him screaming into the void just to bring him back again - my touch: mine, and nobody else's.
We dried each other with soft towels and provocative kisses, making each other smile until we were finally dry and our bodies began to get too cool for comfort.
He Apparated us directly to his house, squeezing me tightly in his arms, as if I were likely to escape. I assure you I was not even considering it. I hardly noticed his place, that first time. He led me to a large bathroom where he undressed both of us, and we took a hot shower, learning each other's bodies with natural sponge, scented soap and wandering hands. Our third orgasm of the evening came slowly, exchanging soft caresses in the misty heat of the shower, guiding each other to completion with gentle sweetness rather than
, and he's still him, and our fights are the stuff of legend in Weasleyville - but I know him, and he knows me. He knows that I would give him the moon and stars, and name nasty potions after him – no, wait, that was Severus after
... and then I’m kissing him awkwardly as I keep thrusting into his arse. My dick spurts its final jet of spunk inside Harry’s quivering hole and I almost collapse on top of him, feeling his skin – hot and sticky with sweat against mine, and it's too much and it's never enough - and now, fuck, I'm kissing those beautiful lips and his arms wrap around me, and he whispers in my ear that ‘We're fucking amazing and shit, he needs to sleep for a week, and if I keep him waiting that long again he'll die, and am I cold?’
And I let him indulge in his little fantasy that he is anything but a loser, because I'm clearly the winner here, even if he can't see it.
Harry drew me to his bedroom by the hand, pulled back the quilt, and jumped into the bed like an excited teenager, arms outstretched to welcome me. I remember feeling absurdly shy at that moment, as I crawled into his bed and then into his embrace, tangling my own limbs around him. We kissed for a while before snuggling close to each other to rest - at this point I'm pretty sure I told him he needed a bigger bed. We sprawlers need it, you know.
“No, you don’t.” A new voice walked into the room. “What you need is some sleep.” Hermione came into view and frowned at him.
“Accio chair.” She pulled her wand out and the chair flew from under Draco into her free hand and she quickly slammed it to the floor before it twisted her wrist.
“How am I supposed to kiss him if he’s dead?” Draco stopped the bottle halfway to his mouth and turned to stare at Harry.
“Merlin Potter, I feel sorry for the poor bugger you’re going to propose to.” Draco crossed his arms and Pansy let out a giggle. Harry chose to ignore them.
The trousers, now buttoned-up, were much looser; they only just stayed on his hips. Harry told him to tuck the shirt and, as Harry predicted, you couldn’t see any marks from the shirt through the fabric. He took a step back to admire his work but noticed there were things missing.
“Thank you. It means a lot.” Harry gave a smile. “And, if it’s any consolation I don’t think you’re still the twat you were raised to be. Maybe just a bit annoying now.” Draco let out a sheepish laugh and dipped his head.
And then there was Draco. Draco Malfoy was probably the only model who had worked with Harry more than once. Harry had discovered he liked being the boss and, since models were his worst enemy, he found he liked making them do what he wanted. It became the norm for models to work for him once (It wasn’t like they complained because they found other modelling companies treated them just as harsh) but Draco had stuck around. He had raised an eyebrow at Harry’s behaviour, shut his mouth, and did what he was told. Harry suspected he was having a hard time finding a job at first and heard Harry was adopting Slytherins, but as time went on and Draco’s name as a model gained more respect, Harry started to suspect Draco liked working for him. Either that or was used to the routine they had. Harry was the most careful with Draco when they started, not knowing where they stood with each other after everything, but he found it rather easy to casually banter with Draco when they were together. Besides, it was second nature for Harry to tell Draco to shut up when he was being annoying.
“Master Lord Black also asks Dobby to inform Master Harry Potter that he is to behave if he goes to Young Master Draco’s room.”
“It’s Harry, you bloody git,” Potter-Harry breathed before closing the last remaining distance between their lips.
And Harry, who was just that away to go back to Potter in Draco’s mind, didn’t only leave him there! He started avoiding him in the next few days. What was he supposed to think about that?!!! Harry had been the one to take that step by kissing him! He couldn’t just ditch him like that, could he???? And what with the avoidance?! Wasn’t he supposed to be a Gryffindor?! How could that be qualified as bravery????
Draco had stayed at Grimmauld Place for Christmas after spending Yule and a few days with his mother. Of course, Black had invited his cousins for Christmas so, his mother wouldn’t be alone, and they can still spend it together. They waited for everyone to arrive before opening their presents.
But Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to force that type of encounter on himself. If Teddy wanted to see him, he knew where to find him…
Someone – probably a Weasley – spanked the punch and Harry had been even more handy than usual that evening so they finally did it… Not in Teddy’s bed! Mind you! But well, a transfigured desk in a deserted classroom was as comfortable as anything and they didn’t really have time to think about that anyway!
“You couldn’t afford to lose him either…” Draco corrected but Harry didn’t even acknowledge it. “What about a mind-healer? I know Black is seeing one.”
It was okay. They could make this work… Draco thought. Most of his doubts about Harry’s willingness to keep their relationship hidden were long gone.
Black seemed really proud of his wards… unlike Lupin who was sending disapproving looks not only to the two teenagers but also to his partner.
Harry must have realized what he had just done because he let Draco’s arm go and looked away uncomfortably.
With time, the platform started to be more and more crowded. Draco overheard some girl talking about Teddy. He didn’t even know the girl who didn’t seem to be in their year… which was strange.
He went to the nearest loo and splashed some water on his face. He looked at his reflection in the mirror. It was going to be okay. Teddy was still his best friend and he was going through something… That’s why he was so mean… nothing to do with finally realizing that Draco was a selfish prick and wanting to cut ties with him…
Draco tried to focus back on the game, but he was boiling inside. How dare Teddy talk to him like that?! After twenty minutes of failed attempts to stay calm, Draco got up.
“Don’t ask me, she told me they had broken up,” he said. “And, it’s not as if I had to force her to do anything too…”
“I love you too, you idiot…” Harry whispered before kissing him again under a full standing ovation from the rest of their friends, dispatching in every House.
“I think your boyfriend is cheating on you with your brother…” Weasley sighed without looking up from the Quidditch magazine he was currently reading.
But clearly, Harry hadn’t found his Gryffindor bravery back just yet as he just cuddled his best friend… Draco was fuming. Could it be that the reason Harry was willing to ask Teddy before doing anything with him because the two had feelings for each other?!!! No, it couldn’t be! They were friends! Almost brothers! They…
Draco laughed lightly and took his boyfriend in his arms to kiss him. Harry wouldn’t let go with a light kiss though. And after a long minute of tender snogging et finally settled down against his neck.
“But Teddy! We’re underage and we’re Prefects! It’s forbidden to perform magic outside school!” Harry exclaimed – imitating Granger’s tone.
“Yes… It’s barely if he reckons the man is dead sometimes…” Draco sighed. “Do they think that he might have died in a similar fashion as Diggory?”
Draco had to force himself to breathe again. He wanted to kill them… Who were they?!! Who dared doing something like that to his boyfriend?! And it was all before he even came to Hogwarts!!! But that wasn’t the priority. He remembered what Harry had said before telling him all this. He had to say something, or Harry will really believe that he hated him now!
“She promised to come over to Grimmauld for New Year Eve. We were mostly okay last week, before the exams… I don’t know where she is…”
But it was unnerving… Seeing him pretending to dance with that Patil girl… It was also funny to realise that the boy seemed to be looking Draco’s way more often than not too… But he wasn’t sure whether the other boy might feel something for him too, or he just had noticed that Draco was looking at him and thus, was looking back. That later explanation wasn’t funny at all.
So... I guess I must tell you that I haven't actually worked on this fic in months... Chapter 12 to 14 are already written but I kind of lost my motivation after that... Maybe it will be back at some point, who knows?
“Move along, to your Common Rooms, all of you!” some prefect ordered behind them, forcing them to move and to lose Teddy in the crowd.
“I know, it was stupid and insensitive on my part!” he defended himself. “The point is, that would explain why he felt so responsible for the man’s disappearance… and also how he reacted to Diggory’s death. Maybe his godfather’s mission was linked to Teddy’s gift and maybe Teddy is trying to pursue the man’s job and that’s why he has never contacted his family to tell them what happened. Anyway, you shouldn’t project your own experience on him, you know what the mindhealer says…”
Teddy and Harry had then realised that they had only three weeks left to finish all their summer assignments and that they hadn’t even started yet. Draco agreed with them when they said they were doomed. It wasn’t his case in any way as his summer assignments were all almost done.
However, when Teddy didn’t show up at dinner despite Potter being here, Draco felt like something very wrong happened.
“Oh? Should I offer you my shoulder?” Draco said, turning his hand slightly so Harry’s fingers would cross his.
Draco and Harry shared a look behind Teddy’s back. Neither of them knew Tracey Davis that well to reassure their friend.
He didn’t need to open his eyes to know that Harry was now blushing his incredibly cute tomato blush. He kissed him again and sat next to him on the bench.
Draco stayed silent. He had never been engaged enough in a game to just jump by a window to win… It was a classical Gryffindor move, he guessed.
Now, Draco was having the most boring year at Hogwarts. They had started working for their O.W.L.s which was due for the end of the following year, so most of their lessons were reviewing what they did during the first three years of school. He didn’t have Quidditch practise because the House Tournament had been cancelled. And he was still unable to work at the Hospital Wing to support his eventual summer internship application to St Mungo’s because he was too young! What was he supposed to do with his time???
were sometimes forcing their children to play with him only to get the opportunity to talk to his own father. Lucius Malfoy had also taught his son to take advantage of this situation. That’s how Draco had formed an alliance with Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle before he even started Hogwarts. The two boys were taller, larger and stronger than him, they could protect him from older students if they ever decided to pick on him.
Harry nodded and sneaked into the bed next to Teddy. The mattress was large enough for the three of them anyway. Draco looked at them and sighed. It was creepy.
“It’s not… we’re not…” Harry stuttered without managing to form a complete sentence. He ended up in a total blushing mess.
Harry didn’t want Teddy to know the details about what he had been through because he didn’t want him to see him differently. Draco thought that was stupid, but he could see why Harry wanted to avoid having an even more overprotective brother on his back.
Granger and he didn’t have any trouble finding the Potter-Wolfe-Black-Lupin household. They were with the Weasleys and if that wasn’t noticeable enough, Teddy was wearing bright turquoise hair.
Harry hesitated before taking something from his pocket. Draco couldn’t see what it was as Harry displayed it off-screen.
“I love you, okay? And nothing that had happened to you in the past will change that! Don’t think so little of me, please…” he added, trying to sidestep the fact that it was the first time that he told him those three words so clearly.
“We were already friends… I mean, people are used to seeing us together when Teddy is here. Maybe we can get them used to see us together even when Teddy isn’t around? It’s not as if you were planning to shag me during Snape class, wasn’t it?”
Draco nodded but grabbed Harry’s wrist before he could step away. “I’ll need another kiss now as I won’t be allowed to do it when I see you on Friday…”
Teddy had asked him a few times if he was really ready during the past two weeks. Harry had told him about the bet, apparently, and Teddy wanted to make sure neither of his friends would force themselves to do something they weren’t ready for.
His mother sighed dramatically and then opened her arm largely. “Come here. An old woman has the right to hug her son when she is so very proud of him…”
“Shut up, Edward,” Draco scolded. He was the only one who had any right to make Harry blush like that. And he kissed him again, more gently. “Thanks, Har’. I love it.”
Draco had learnt his lesson well. He knew most of the people around him were kind or mean to him depending only on what they thought about his parents… or more often what their own parents thought for younger people. So, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested for being a Death Eater and couldn’t get his way around it, Draco knew immediately that his own world was finished and nothing he ever wanted would ever be possible anymore…
So, Potter told Draco how Teddy seemed to have been through a break down on Christmas Day. And Draco told Potter when he noticed, despite Teddy always talking about his large and loving family, none of them seemed to ever owl the boy. Not even his godlike godfather who didn’t seem to have time to spare on his beloved godson, even for Christmas or for Teddy’s birthday. Draco was mad at the man even if he didn’t know him.
Draco chuckled. “No way. Teddy will definitely be Head Boy. I have my eyes on the Slytherin Quidditch Captain position though…”
“What? You have to put the right words on the things you want to talk about. There’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Harry explained with a similar smirk on his face.
And Draco looked at his big perfect emerald eyes. He wanted to kiss him, to lean on his shoulder and let him tell him that everything would be okay. But they weren’t there yet, were they?
Draco stayed shocked. He barely knew the guy but… but could that even be possible?!! This Triwizard Tournament had been put back in place on the only condition that safety measures were improved and yet, it was the second accident of this kind! The first time, the merpeople of the Black Lake apparently misunderstood their ‘
“It’s noted,” Draco nodded. “I’m going to change in the Slytherin changing room. See you on the pitch in 5, Harry.”
Teddy had also willingly given him crucial information about himself. He had told Draco that his father was a werewolf. That single piece of information combined with the fact that Teddy was friend with Harry the Boy-Who-Lived Potter would be enough to make Teddy the most hated person in Hogwarts and thus saving Draco from that position. Seriously, how would people react if they learnt that a dark creature had lurked and became their very Light Saviour’s best friend in less than a few weeks? Teddy seemed to know what he had done when he had told Draco. Yet, he had done it. As if he trusted Draco… or maybe it was just a test or a way to manipulate him…
“Really?” Draco gave him a wolfish smile and Harry blushed a little more before kissing him to make him shut his mouth.
Potion was already one of Draco’s favourite subject, but he now had a new reason to enjoy this class. And for the record, Harry started it first by leaning on him while adding Sneezewort to their Befuddlement Draught. Draco had only been innocently clockwise stirring their potion. So, it’s not really his fault if later he
“Draco didn’t say that to blame you, Ted’,” Harry said softly. “And for the record, I don’t know what you planned to do with Tracey but the two of us haven’t had penetrative sex before very recently, actually…”
“Mistress is also telling Dobby to tell Young Master Draco to refrain from doing anything indecent in the shared rooms of the Manor when Mistress is in the Manor too.” The Elf continued with a joyful smile.
Harry opened the small package at the other end of the Great Hall. He read the note attached to it. Granger asked him something and he shook his head slowly without looking up from the small piece of papers.
They were now only a few centimetres from each other. Draco was a bit taller than the Gryffindor and he was looking down at his emerald eyes which seemed hypnotized by the Slytherin’s lips.
At 10:30, he met with Hermione Granger. The girl was okay, he guessed. He didn’t know if he could consider her a friend. She was more Teddy’s friend and a good study partner but otherwise… he guessed he tolerated her. But now, it was a bit different because Granger was one of Harry’s best friends and he definitely didn’t know for sure what he told her about them.
“No, I think we’re going to be okay. The room provided us with everything we want, so currently, we have a fireplace and a large couch, but I made sure that a bed was available too…”
“It’s okay…” Harry said as if he had read his thoughts – which was a bit strange because Draco’s emotion usually wasn’t that obvious with his Slytherin mask on. “Everyone will be so focused on Teddy’s new look that no one will probably notice us anyway.” Harry continued putting a new light kiss on his lips. “Sorry for making you uncomfortable around your friends…”
Draco had had to work with that knowledge for the next few weeks of school. What was even worse was that he had received a letter from Sirius Lord Black himself, explaining that Teddy was under some sort of Fidelius Charm and that asking him too much about his godfather’s death could permanently turn him into a vegetable… Who would ever put a child under the Fidelius Charm?!!! How do they expect Draco to tame his killing morbid curiosity????
Draco followed the owls, pretending not to care, but carefully waiting for Hedwig to land in front of her owner.
“Like… Quidditch, friends… Teddy… liking to look at each other ass…” Potter blushed at that. “Liking to look at each other’s body while undressing…” Draco took one step ahead. “Liking to look at each other’s lips while speaking…”
“You’re not old…” Draco smiled at her. “Here the book list of the year… and of course the reminder about the rules, and oh! My Hogsmeade visits permission form if you’re kind enough to sign it…”
“Then go outside! Go play quidditch with Harry or something but leave me the fuck alone, okay?!!!!!”
“As she should be,” Granger nodded. “It’s not a very serious career choice! Only a handful of people can do that. And maybe you’re good here in school but professional competition is a whole next level!”
“It’s okay Rem’, it’s for a special occasion…” Black told him softly after serving everyone. “And it’s not as if it was their first drink anyway…”
Draco looked down at the way Harry’s hand was still holding his sleeve. Was that kind of proximity okay when someone could barge in at any moment? Would they ever be certain that no one was looking at them when they’d be at Hogwarts? Was holding hands okay or too much in the end?
Harry’s hand moved and started stroking slightly the back of his head, brushing the base of his neck under the collar of his shirt. And suddenly, that embrace was nothing like anything he might have shared with Teddy.
“Let’s go see Daphne! I want to see her face when she sees you!” she said grabbing Teddy’s arm and driving him away.
But Draco sent him a disbelieving look and Potter didn’t even try to deny it. Silence settled between them.
Teddy groaned and morphed into what looked like a 5-year-old a child with turquoise blue hair. He sat up and climbed above Harry’s body to squeeze himself back between Harry and Draco.
“Why?!! Why did you want me to go there?!!! Did you just want to prove that he does hate me now?!! Was that your idea of a joke?!!!!”
“I… I can’t! I… No,” he said but Draco could see that he was still into chock. His eyes were unfocused and couldn’t see them.
went. Draco only had to tell him that Harry told him about the Dursleys and the Hufflepuff immediately quitted asking questions – just like Harry had told him he would.
“It’s not like that… He’s my brother, just like you said… I want to talk to him first… And I said it could wait until we’re home anyway.”
In the end, Draco came up with a new version of the scar removing salve by the beginning of February. Snape let him test his invention on him and Draco hadn’t expected his Head of House to have so many scars. The result exceeded expectations and Snape offered him to put him in contact with the patenting committee of St Mungo’s. This would surely help his internship application next summer! But Draco had other plans for now.
“Harry, Teddy didn’t have the same childhood as you did. He told you that his aunt wasn’t that bad, didn’t he?”
“I… I think I need to go… my mother is waiting for me…” Draco muttered the lie and disappeared in the floo before having to deal with any of it.
“Falling in love, Draco?” Teddy smirked after some time. He seemed perfectly aware of what his new look was inducing in people around him.
On the 31st of July, Harry didn’t answer his first call but called back at around 1 a.m. The boy had seemed ecstatic as he told Draco about his day in Paris. The whole thing sounded very muggle, but Draco didn’t care because there was something on Harry’s smile which was just preventing him from teasing and instead forced him to smile back. The boy was also clearly tired.
“Do you think I’m strange?” Teddy continued. “I mean… I’m a boy, I should be eager to just… do it? No?”
“Well… at least, it’s clear now…” Teddy mumbled, he even tried to smile but his two friends could see how dull his turquoise hair had become.
“Guys,” Angelina Johnson said as she entered the boys’ changing room. “I caught this Slytherin spying on us. It’s getting worse every year…” She sighed. “What do you suggest we do to him?”
With the two of them, they managed to convince Teddy to get up and to walk along. But as soon as they entered the Castle, the Hufflepuff stopped.
In April, they organized a big party in the Hufflepuff Common Room for Teddy’s birthday. They’d all been quite busy with O.W.L.s study but they couldn’t very much miss Teddy’s 16th birthday, could they?
Teddy jolted and stared at him as if he had just hexed him. Draco smirked; he was getting used to that side of Harry.
Harry was crying again while laughing disgustingly at himself, and Draco didn’t know what to do to make him stop thinking so badly about himself. He sat back on the bench, pulling Harry with him. The Gryffindor was shivering. He was only wearing his underwear after all. Draco quickly detached his robe and hung it around Harry’s shoulder.
But, of course, that would be something Draco would do. Harry had to break up with him before he went Horcrux hunting because he knew it would hurt Draco more if he died. Draco didn't, shouldn't know Harry was still madly in love with him and was doing everything to stay alive and save him.
"And tell me, all you found was heartbreak and misery." Draco allowed himself to frown as if he was upset with Harry being hurt.
“Wait, the guy with black hair and the creepy eyes,” Ron asked as Harry gestured for them to come forward.
Pansy was head of makeup and Harry was always so glad he had reached out to her with his plan. Despite not knowing anything about makeup (and dismissing that they were supposed to hate each other) he had always admired Pansy’s look during the later years at Hogwarts. He had found her address as soon as the idea blossomed in his mind, walked around with it in his pocket for many months, and on the day he had braved up enough to go visit her he had bumped into her on the street and, after apologising for his clumsiness, he had warily asked her, and she had just as warily accepted until he reassured all her suspicions. Pansy and Harry had a lot of time to get to know each other while building the business and had bonded loads during that time to a point of knowing what each other is thinking with one look.
“That’s not fair. Do I not get a partner?” He pouted walking closer to the group. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Perfect.” Harry glanced at them and gestured for them to move closer. There was silence for a while after. At some point, Ron returned with Dean and they settled into the silence. Someone would go to say something and then stop themselves knowing Harry wanted perfection.
“Just try the trousers on.” Harry gestured to a pile with a note with Malfoy’s name on. “I’m sure I got the measurements right but I wouldn’t put it past you to have done something.” Harry leaned back in his chair.
“It doesn’t scream Draco Malfoy. Besides, you’re smart enough to put on a shirt and not a waistcoat. Why would you mess around with a waistcoat when you’ve been caught rendezvous-ing.” Harry explained turning to him. “But not having the shirt tucked in when it’s a perfect fit is… messy, it’s… shaggy. It’s more…” Harry waved his hand around trying to think of the word.
"I'm jealous of the rain." Draco began to sing causing Harry to stop. He really did love Draco's voice.
"You like it when I sing don't you?" Draco whispered. Harry looked at him like he was mad but then softened when he saw the fear in Draco's eyes.
“Well, I mean everyone else here is like my family,” Potter explained and Draco let out an understanding noise before looking back at his bottle. What else did he expect? There was a shuffling noise but Draco didn’t look up.
“Take it from under him,” Harry said as if it was obvious. Pansy stared at him for a while until he raised an eyebrow.
“Alright. Well, my father would kill me if I married someone other than a pureblood.” A few of them rolled their eyes. “And mother would go mental if she didn’t get grandbabies. So, I suppose, if I want to live, I’d have to marry Ginevra.” One of the twins, Draco couldn’t be bothered to think which one, put a protective arm around her. As if Draco was going to sweep her away and force her into marriage. Draco smiled to himself as he leaned back against the bed.
“He doesn’t work for me,” Harry answered. “You in the corner,” he gestured to someone he hadn’t noticed at first, “come closer.” The model did so and Harry flickered over the faces to someone he thought would fit with. When he found him, Harry gestured to them both, “Get.” He ordered.
“I’m under no such impression.” Harry took it all in and frowned. He was sure that it would work. He rubbed his hand over his face and stepped forward again.
“I beg to differ.” Harry’s eyes snapped back up to Draco’s questioning. “I usually stay naked for longer but I don’t think you’re going for full-frontal nudity.” Harry rolled his eyes.
“Come on Malfoy. Kiss, marry, kill. Out of all of us,” Granger urged him on. He rolled his eyes and took a swig from the bottle of firewhiskey in his hand. He’d only agreed to play the stupid muggle game to get information against the others playing. The others being the Weasley twins, the she-weasel, the original weasel, Granger, and Potter. He was staying at the burrow for the summer – it was a long explanation.
There was a cough from behind them but Draco really couldn’t care less with Harry looking at him like that.
"No. NO. Draco No. Don't do this. No. Draco no. Please no, don't. Please." Harry begged. Ron came back to see what happened and now was pulling Harry away by the waist.
“Malfoy,” Harry answered pulling his designs out of Draco’s loose grip. Harry sometimes wished he could call Draco by his first name. He was Draco in his head and had been for a long time. Draco was different form Malfoy in Hogwarts. He only stopped himself because it felt like Draco was the only one who remembered he was a Potter. Harry preferred being famous for being Harry rather than Harry Potter but he was proud to be a Potter and he liked that Draco emphasised that.
“I see where you’re going with that.” She nodded and Harry turned to look at her. She looked back with the same expression she had when she thought what someone had said was worth listening to.  She gave him a soft smile, though, which she wouldn’t give to others.
"Don't make that promise. If I see you after. I see you after. If not, then fine. Do what you need to do Harry." And with that Draco pulled away.
Some of the models looked scared. Harry loved that part. When he had become so cruel he didn’t know but he enjoyed watching them squirm not knowing what to do under the gaze. Of course, Draco couldn’t have looked more at ease (after he stopped posting about the chair). He started making noises with his mouth and Harry endured it for a while since it made the silence in the room a little less awkward but eventually, he snapped out a sharp “Malfoy!” and the noises stopped.
He thought about his answer carefully, looking at each individual member sitting on the floor of one of the, surprisingly many, rooms of the burrow.
"I didn't, Draco I didn't. No please." Harry only then realised Draco wasn't giving up and allowed himself to cry.
“What? No. It’s too close to the show. They’ll just have us go out individually. They’ll probably do that anyway. It’s the best way à mon avis but we don’t have a say as models. I should know I’m their favourite.” Harry felt Hermione go to reply to Draco’s comment about favouritism so he placed a hand on her arm to stop her. It wasn’t worth it. Besides, he wanted to savour the sound of Draco casually slipping into French as he did sometimes. Pansy spoke instead of Hermione and ruined the moment for him anyway.
"Father will be so mad at me he'll forget about you. Now go Harry." Draco tried again but Harry didn't let go.
There was a chorus of “Bye Harry”s as he made his way into his office sipping his coffee. He waved at them with the back of his hand.
Models. His worst enemy. Everyone cared about the models. No one cared about Harry. If they did they would buy him coffee but as I said, he was very undercaffeinated. So Harry wasn’t a huge fan of models, or it was less the models and more that he had to design for them, create a set for them, create outfits for them, and make them look good when he hadn’t changed his shirt in 3 days. Fashion week. That was the real enemy. The models were like death eaters and fashion week was Voldemort, except he didn’t think he had the power to kill fashion week.
“Umm,” Potter seemed to collect himself before answering, “marry Hermione to annoy you,” He pointed at Ron who stuck his tongue out.
"'Cause I wished you the best of all this world could give." Draco waved his hands gesturing to everything. "And I told you when you left me."
“I think you’re under the impression I’m a bottom, Potter.” He said as Harry smoothed the tie down. Harry raised an eyebrow taking a step back.
“Exactly!” Harry grinned as he walked closer and popped Draco’s collar up. “It will make you stand out and get a few laughs.” Harry wrapped the tie around his neck and started doing it up. “Besides, I doubt even you would have time to check what tie you put on after being fucked senseless.” Harry pulled the tie tighter and covered it with Draco’s collar.
“That’s really specific. Does everyone have the same backstory?” Draco raised an eyebrow. Harry sighed and turned to look at him.
“And now I’m undoing it.” Harry retorted. He pulled it completely so both sides dangled down. He then undid the top buttons of Draco’s shirt and stepped back again. He sighed at what he saw. “Does your hair have to be so perfect?”
"Hermione's got some clues, Ron has the key to my Gringotts volt. In it is a portkey but it doesn't have a destination yet. It was a gift. It sort of apparates you wherever you want. You'll know what it is. Well, I hope you know what it is. I don't know where the last Horcruxes are but tell Hermione to look at the blank parchment in the moonlight. That all I overheard. Now go." Draco tried pushing him away.
“Now, we’re going to look at you for a very long time. If it makes you uncomfortable, what the hell are you doing as a model? If we tell you to stand somewhere specific, just go and stand there. It makes everything so much easier for me and you. You may talk to each other, but as I said I’ve got a migraine so do it really really quiet. I think that’s everything.” He clapped his hands together and then winced at the sound. He looked around him and frowned. “Where’s Dean?”
Draco’s eyes flickered to Harry and the group before looking back to the model. “They're sizing you up to eat you,” he answered simply but gave a short laugh at the horror on the guy’s face. “They’re just seeing who looks good with who. If they want to do pairs down the walk or triplets or neither. No point all of us looking good if we don’t look good together.” Draco shrugged but Harry thought he had explained it rather well.
“So a drink then?” Draco quickly switched his trousers for his jeans leaving them undone as he picked up the trousers to hang them neatly.
“Are we just not going to discuss Malfoy just admitted to his family having incest?” Seamus asked from behind them. Harry let out a laugh before kissing Pansy on the head and pulling away from her embrace.
"Harry, we have to go," Ron called for him not looking back. They were escaping the Malfoy manor but Harry wasn't leaving without Draco.
“That…” Draco prompted. Potter's eyes lifted from his lips and then quickly glanced around the circle. Before Draco knew what was happening, Potter was shuffling over to him until they were face to face. Draco placed his bottle down to the side of him.
“Have to get my beauty sleep,” Draco smirked but the hand he ran through his hair told Harry he was sorry. For someone wearing glasses, Harry was quite observant.
And that was everyone. Who mattered to the company at least. Harry couldn’t have asked for a better team. There were probably people better at their jobs but they wouldn’t work as well together or care as much for Harry, so Harry wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Mother, I really can’t talk now. I’m at work and I’m late.” Malfoy rushed in talking down his phone (Harry had talked to pansy about getting them for work purposes and she had introduced Draco to the wonders of muggle technology). Harry raised an eyebrow and Pansy pointed towards Draco with her whole arm. Harry rolled his eyes at her.
“Here babe.” Harry heard Seamus talking to Dean. “Black, although I don’t know why, you prefer sweet things.” Dean absentmindedly handed the coffee cup to Harry who took a big sip without saying thank you. He didn’t need to. Dean got the message from Harry suddenly standing up. “Oh that makes sense,” Seamus muttered before Harry spoke up.
“Hardly,” Harry let out a laugh, “I just wouldn’t be surprised if you managed to do something that would ruin my set.”
“I don’t… you don’t think I still believe that do you?” Harry’s head snapped up at the tone of Draco’s voice.
“Enjoy your drink,” Harry added wanted to have the last word before turning back to his work. He looked down and ran his hands through his hair. It was going to be a long night. He reached for his phone as he heard the door close.
“That’s not to say,” Potter said way too loudly and too fast. Draco lifted his head to catch Potter turning back from glaring at Hermione. Their eyes met and Draco pursed his lips to try to get Potter to continue. Instead, he just stared at his lips.
“You’re not going to tell him off for being late?” Draco piped up when Seamus gave a sheepish smile and closed the door with his foot.
“I want this to be classy. Not getting caught behind the dumpsters with a drink in one hand and your dick in another,” Harry faced Draco but was speaking to everyone.
“Huh? No, it’s not.” Harry removed his hand from his mouth and stopped tapping and pulled out Draco’s design. “I can’t put my finger on what’s wrong though.” He paused for a second. “Tell a lie. It’s your bloody arse. The trousers are too tight because of it, so you’ll be able to see the shirt, but if I loosen it, the waistcoat will look too tight.” Draco’s lips quirked but he didn’t say anything. “Okay put the waistcoat on without the shirt.” Draco did so after pulling his shirt off and Harry regretted even thinking it. “No, absolutely not. You look ridiculous and guilty. Try the shirt but don’t tuck it.” Draco did and Harry bit his lip. “I don’t know if I like it.” Draco chuckled and looked down at himself. “Add the waistcoat.” Draco pulled it on shrugging his shoulders and Harry huffed in frustration. “It’s not… you. I’ll give it to the brunette at the beginning, it might work with him.” Draco took it back off frowning.
“Hi,” Draco said instead of acknowledging anything. Harry laughed for a second before pressing his lips back against Draco’s for a quick one. When he pulled pack, he moved his hands from the side of Draco’s face to trace his lips.
"Draco?" Harry was confused at why Draco was shutting the gate with him still inside. That wasn't the plan. Draco was coming with them. Draco was escaping this hell with them. After all they'd been through, he wasn't going to stay.
Anyway, Luna had become a set designer without Harry knowing what was happing (Luna managed to do that to a lot of people: doing what she wanted and it fitting with everything) and had hired a very lost Blaise Zabini, taught him about electricity (how Luna knew so much would always faze Harry) and taught him about lighting sets, so that was his job.
“Is there a chair anywhere?” He asked Pansy while eyeing a model. “You two,” he pointed at two of the men, “Stand next to each other.” One crossed to the other side and he nodded.
“You’re insinuating I’ve put on weight.” Draco gasped before continuing. “Are you calling me fat, Potter?” Draco put on an offended face while starting to unbutton his jeans.
Draco didn’t answer he just pulled Harry down from the front of his shirt and pressed his lips, hard against his. He was sure there was a selection of reactions in the room, but, at that moment, all Draco could think about was pulling Harry as close to him as he could. It was everything he’d ever wanted and nothing he could’ve expected all in one. All those years of Draco wistfully thinking of Harry just pushing him up against the wall and kissing him like he was now. All those years of fighting when they could have been doing this. Draco groaned into Harry’s mouth at that thought and got rewarded with a little bit of tongue. When Harry pulled back, Draco followed for a second before stopping himself. He would, probably, follow this boy to the ends of the world, but he still had some sort of reputation.
Harry didn’t even jump when a hand rested on his shoulder. He didn’t know who it was but he really didn’t care. At this point, he would welcome a murderer with open arms. At least he wouldn’t have to go through the mess of killing himself.
Three fingers and a stubborn tongue are no problem for him now and I fucking wanna be in there. It's kind hard to breathe with my tongue in Harry’s arse, and I'm still twisting my three fingers, his hole struggling a little more against me. I contort to suck my thumbs hard, and then my fingers are out and the thumbs are in – fingers gripping his butt as I spread his hole wide with my thumbs, a buffet of delicious smooth flesh as I push my tongue inside him.
, fuck, we were horny and it was dark, and you'd be surprised how few people come and investigate strange noises in the dark! From there things escalated to mutual groping, and before we knew it each of us had a hand on the other's dick and I was pressing wildly against him as he devoured my mouth. The feeling of Harry, warm and hard, but soft as silk in my grip, as I thrust into those big hands of his ... I'm sure I'll never get enough. I certainly didn't get enough that night; as I spread the pre-come across the tip of his dick until it was completely sticky, I moaned into his mouth, telling him how much I wanted to suck him, to taste the unmistakable musk of him, that I’d let the sticky tip of his dick past my lips and let him fuck my mouth. He came then, thrusting into my hand and covering me with his essence, moaning my name reverently as he trembled, his grip reflexively strengthening around me as his hand sped up. I followed him over the precipice, gazing into his eyes as I went slack with pleasure.
, lock, stock and barrel, complete with spare parts and a lifetime guarantee. I’d always wanted him - his friendship, his attention, even his hatred was better than nothing. Merlin, it was all too easy to provoke him! You know, sometimes at school I didn't even need to
Lying on the bed to get closer, I grab his arse with both hands and bend down to kiss that precious hole -
I joined him for that coffee. I will admit that I indulged in one with a generous swirl of whipped cream floating indulgently on the top. I sipped it slowly, enjoying the fact that I’d noticed Potter was completely fascinated by my tongue – giving in to the urge to show it a little more, I managed to get more cream around my lips than in my mouth. The temptation was irresistible. Can you blame me? Okay, I admit fellating my finger was
I know his hole will have reacted too, and I can't keep myself from it a moment longer. I run my tongue along the seam of his balls, down the line of his perineum, straight to his entrance - my entrance.
Knowing he was still going to be hypersensitive, I licked delicately all around the shaft, cleaning his come from his hot skin with my tongue. I teased the tight curls at the base of his shaft, burying my nose in his groin in an attempt to burn his unique scent into my memory. I'm not known for my patience, though, and Harry's beautiful cock, already leaking more pre-come, called me back like a hot toddy on a winter's eve. Barely taking the time to savour his sensitive glans, I sank his dick into my throat, in a desperate need to feel – to know – to own – this thing between us, whatever it was. Harry groaned above me and I drowned in Harry’s heated gaze as he watched me pull back off his length and then take him in once more, until my nose was buried in the soft fuzz of his pubic hair. Merlin, I
I knew he was going to lose before we made love for the first time, when he was all sparkling eyes and nervous touches. I knew it when he opened up to me and trusted me to love him, and I knew it when he came, shuddering and quivering endlessly around my dick, uttering delicious little words of pleasure and love for me, dragging me over the edge with him until I found myself exhausted in his arms as he stroked my hair.
We collapsed against each other, supporting each other to remain standing; kissing messily, mouths wet and soft against each other as we caressed our softening cocks with light touches. He whispered into my mouth what became a tradition for him: "I won," and then grinned like a loon. I'm sure I raised an eyebrow before he explained that he
, and my tongue is in pole position. I swipe my tongue down his crack and across his hole wetly, feeling the heat of his most private place, leaving as much saliva as I can before dipping the tip of my tongue into that wonderful wrinkled flesh and
, it's all so slippery and yeah ... I get up on my knees and then stroke my cock lightly with my slick fingers, and all I can see is Harry's hole twitching from lack of stimulation and Harry whines, accompanies the movement with groans of need until I position myself at his entrance and push home.
. I find myself squirming against the bed every time I push deep inside Harry and he has stopped rocking and is now shuddering against me. My tongue is back in action and Harry is now so wet he's dripping on the blanket, but I don't give a damn because, fuck, Harry's taste is a fucking aphrodisiac and I want to rut against in the bed, but I WON'T … This is too much, I won't last much longer. Shit, three fingers - a quick suck and my now-completely-sticky-wet hand has three fingers buried in Harry's hole and he's dizzy with delight.
Harry summons a blanket from the rocking chair and covers us up, chiding me softly for trying to move, because he likes the feel of softening dick in his arse. I give up, because I don’t have the energy to do anything more than roll off anyway, so I just lay there, tangled in heat and Harry, listening to him mutter to me that he loves us, and he loves me and that he won again. As a sleepy chuckle escapes me, he kisses my head and tells me that maybe one day he'll let me win.
is mine, and Potter was just some self-righteous, argumentative little prick he was before he was mine.
. The tongue is the strongest and most versatile muscle in the body for its size, but trust me when I say Harry's sphincter puts up a good fight. It trembles and pouts under my lavish attention, and every time I press inwards, it tightens like a vice, forcing me out. Again and again my tongue begs to enter and is rejected. I growl, and lift my head slightly, slide my teeth over that tiny opening. Harry's litany of incoherent moans turns into a monologue of swearing as I take advantage of his momentary surprise and stick my tongue inside him.
I pulled Harry in for a kiss, my arms wrapped around his body still trembling with aftershocks. I licked into his gorgeous mouth, drowning out his cocky assertion that he’d won, and then we both collapsed, exhausted, and he started breathing slow and deep, warm steady breaths into my neck. I closed my eyes to follow his lead, and was drifting off to sleep when he said it. Trust a damn Gryffindor to hit you when your defences are down and it's absolutely
Did I tell you I love him when he's like this, lying on his back, legs spread as wide as he can for me? Dick so hard it is bouncing against the taut surface of his belly, both sticky with pre-come as he squirms under my touch.
I prep two fingers now, eagerly sucking Harry's flavour from one of them and trying to wet both of them with new saliva - it never works and I don't know why I keep doing it - and then I'm back inside Harry, two fingers pushing in and out without giving him time to get used to it, because,
first, and therefore he won. I don't know how I managed to keep myself from telling him that this wasn't a Quidditch championship. Perhaps what prevented me was the light in his eyes: brimful of wonder and delight, as if he had never been so alive and so happy.
I let go with one hand, sucking a finger into my mouth and making it all wet before sliding it all the way into Harry's tight arsehole. I can hear him panting softly as he contracts for a moment around the digit, but my finger isn't thick enough to cause him pain – he’s just getting used to the feeling of having something entering him again, instead of being expelled. I give him a good five seconds before pulling it out to the first knuckle and then pushing back in with ease, my mouth eager to be close again, breath warm and hot on his hole. My tongue flickers out to touch and taste my Harry, licking the finger I'm fucking him with and I’m practically drooling into his arse, my tongue trying to invade his ass along with my finger. Now I’m getting needy; little moans escaping me as I suck messily at Harry's opening, my finger fucking him eagerly and I will never get enough of the taste and the feeling and the pleasure.
Of course, I still haven't told you yet when I knew I won. It didn't happen that night; we fell asleep in each other's arms and woke up in a much less romantic position. At least, so Harry tells me. I woke up in the perfect idyll of having my dick being sucked by Harry - and for a beginner, he’d mastered the art pretty fast. He came first again, fucking his fist furiously as he sucked me. Looking at his face, mouth wrapped around my swollen length as he came in an agony of pleasure, tipped me over the edge after him.

I love to finger-fuck Harry. I could sit here and play with his arse all day, but then I'd miss out on other interesting parts like his dick and his mouth and, “When’s it
is, how much he loves it. I love him for this – his abandonment to pleasure, abandonment to me - so open in this intensely private act.
I smiled and let go of his dick as we parted, bringing my sticky hand up to my mouth and licking it thoroughly, sucking each and every finger. I have to admit, knowing it was Harry's come I was tasting made me hard again. I licked my lips gratuitously, glancing up through my lashes at him, and then I discovered that Harry has black eyes when aroused; I think maybe he remembered the coffee incident. Without a word, he lunged forward and kissed me furiously, ravaging my mouth as he pressed himself against me. His dick, still free and wonderfully hard again, pressed against me insistently.
. But yeah, I'd move mountains for Harry (and have done - the first thing I did was to get rid of that ‘freedom of the press’ shit, so his private life is actually private). He knows it too. His latest Christmas present to me was a damn magical orrery, “So you don't have to go too far to move heaven and earth.” I love that man.
I nudge his balls with my nose, dragging my tongue over his clean wrinkled flesh, until they are completely wet, sucking one into my mouth and then the other and massaging them gently with my tongue. I feel him twitch again and his dick bounces gently on his abdomen - the force of inertia perhaps slowed by the trail of clear fluid that joins the tip of his shaft to his belly.
He chose me – over anyone else in the world. I managed to win, even over him! I won, everyone else lost, and he just
I have the Golden Boy of the Wizarding World panting in my bed, begging for my touch, desperate for release. I've had him for a while.
He's so bloody responsive and I really can't believe I’ve managed to tease him this long without giving in to my urge to fuck him. I'm pretty sure I mentioned that I'm not the patient type - and I know with painful certainty that Harry will revisit this pleasure-punishment on me again ... and that I will scream in desperate

– so tight around me. Harry's internal muscles are working overtime as the rest of his body shuts down, and in the silence of our room I can hear our breath, hot and heavy as he adjusts to the penetration.
Harry helped me up; he seemed almost groggy as he pulled me into a hug before I had time to step away. I felt his lips silently whisper something into my neck,
But I’ve gone off-topic – where was I? Ah yes, kneeling on the ground with my lips around Harry's meat.

Tuesday (not sure it was a special day) when I tied him to the bed and made him come four times. So what's the excuse? I forgot, temporarily, that he likes to make me come as much as I like to do it to him, so a session of sex, a cuddle and a takeout curry later we were both okay again.
