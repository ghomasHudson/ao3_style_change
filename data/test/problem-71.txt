The Quidditch pitch is almost as invisible to the world as the house, possibly more so because it’s got Draco’s more recent charms work in it, but that doesn’t stop them being right in the middle of a wide open space, even if the trees do surround the edges of the pitch. Draco glances around them.
He's a charms consultant, occasionally showing up to do a carefully exquisite job of untangling some cretin's botched charm project, taking a large Gringotts deposit with him when he leaves, and never having to work with the same people twice. He's only called in as a last resort, when every other charms specialist has retired in confused shame, and as such, he can set his own price. Which is good, because these kinds of projects don't come along all that often, and when they do, no one wants to admit they're working with Draco fucking Malfoy.
"Yes," Draco says. "My cocklet's so hard." The humiliation is soft and gentle, but it still hums through him, trembling across his skin as Harry presses himself to Draco's back.
"A specific way of saying traumatised," Harry says. "Like any of us came out of that unscathed. I suspect I came out just a little bit more scathed than some of the others because it wasn't like I showed up at Hogwarts on day one without a shit ton of childhood trauma before we'd even started."
"No what, Draco?"
Draco shakes his head. "No," he says. His heart's pounding. "No, it's not that anymore."
Saturday, when it comes around, sees Draco turning up at Harry's house relatively late in the evening, dressed casually in dark trousers and a grey t-shirt. They're the kind of clothes he always wears when he's going to take himself out for the evening, and Harry had promised him a seedy back room and a supply of the kind of men who were going to take advantage of Draco's eager mouth being on offer. He's not wearing his glamour yet, and he's not entirely certain why. It's not as if Harry didn't see straight through it before, or that he hasn't seen it on two more occasions since then. Or that he's not going to see a variation of it tonight.
"Oh my god," Harry says. "You're so posh."
"The snitch," Draco says, but Harry’s grin is wide and bright and true.
"I can," Harry says, hunching his shoulders against the rain. "But we've got plans."
Draco hisses in a breath, and Harry taps his dick against Draco's cheek.
, his mother had always said he should be.
"Draco," Harry groans, and it's his name,
Harry touches him then, cups his cheek in his hand and rubs his thumb over Draco's jaw. "Make as much noise as you want," he says. "Eat as many of them as you'd like to. They're yours."
Harry rolls his eyes, even as his expression settles into something a little more serious, a little more in control. "Undo your trousers," he says, and after that he makes Draco kneel down and masturbate onto the entrance hall floor, all the time telling him how pointless and small Draco's little cock is, and how boring it is to have to put up with someone as dirty and fucked up as Draco.
"Good bye," she says, following him to the door. "And I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said--"
The guy looks surprised for a fraction of a second. "You don't mind?"
"You're just an animal," Harry tells him, cupping Draco's balls in his hand. "And animals don't use their hands to come. Is there anything else?"
Draco goes immediately silent, apart from a high, vaguely strangled sound as Harry slides his mouth around Draco's little cock. He must be easy to suck off, because his entire cock fits easily in Harry's mouth without any effort at all, not like when he gives Harry a blow job or warms his cock. He raises his eyes to the ceiling. He loves being on his knees so much, loves Harry using him, making use of him, like he's a thing, like he's Harry's to direct. He's wanted to be used for so long he can't remember a time when he wasn't secretly fantasising about being pushed to the floor or humiliated. Even before he'd realised it was sexual, when he used to think about Crabbe and Goyle pushing other children around and bullying them at Draco's demand and he'd found himself wondering night after night what it would be like if he was the one getting pushed around. He'd been confused for so long, and then after that, knee deep in secrets so embarrassing he'd known -- even as a teenager -- that he couldn't ever tell anyone. It had been years later, years of embarrassing, lonely masturbation sessions and even more embarrassing lonely days and nights as the wizarding marriage mart passed him by that he'd realised he could have a bit of what he wanted, and he'd found himself in the back rooms of clubs, his glamour spells getting better and better.
"He was," Harry says. "And you love him."
"Well, that's going to make it slightly more difficult to masturbate in here from here on in, so thank you."
"Were you all right with that?" Harry asks, turning a little so that water splashes. "What we just did?"
"Don't you dare fucking come," the man says, and Draco has to reach down to squeeze his dick and his balls to stop it from happening. "Turn back around."
, and it’s everything, and Draco, just like that, with no one touching him, his hands tied above his head, is coming.
"For me?" Harry looks a little uncertain, and there's quite a strong probability that he's readying himself to bolt. Draco doesn't allow his expression to change.
Draco's only just come but his cock makes a pitiful attempt at a jerk anyway.
Draco trembles. The sheer, unadulterated shame of being treated like nothing better than an animal. The humiliation.
"Hermione Granger, buying wine for me," Draco says. "Does she know she was buying it for me?"
Draco tilts his chin up. "No," he says. "Martin the mad Muggle went to one once."
“I love how desperate you are for it.”
, and Harry stays still throughout it, his cheeks stained pink, his dragons tucked up under his arms. He keeps inching his chair closer to Draco's, though, and in the end, Draco stops reading and asks if it's okay if they move to the window seat so that Draco can put his arm around Harry's shoulders.
"I know," Draco says. "I know you are. But… maybe I could get something out of what you need, too. If you'd let me."
He wants to weep, and they haven't even started yet. "I'm yours," he says, and his voice catches a little, small enough that he can't hide it.
Draco thinks for a minute. "I don't know," he says finally. "Kindness, maybe." He pauses. "You, I think."
"What can you see?"
makes very little sense to him, but he's content to let Harry lead with the rest of their evening's entertainment.
"Are you sure?"
"That's right," Harry says. "Do you tell yourself that?"
Draco nods. He cuts the sandwiches into tiny quarters and arranges them neatly on a plate on the tea tray. "And how did that go?"
"Good boy," Harry says, wiping Draco's come across his thighs. "My good little pig. My little piglet."
"Greedy piglet," Harry agrees. "Greedy soft piglet."
"Follow me," Harry’s already walking away. "And don’t forget that piglets crawl."
Harry's in the sitting room on a sofa, feet flat on the floor, elbows resting on his knees. "You're late," he says, without looking up.
"Would you like that? If I did that for you?"
When he gets home, he barely gets through the wards before he's dropping down onto his knees and wanking, shuddering his orgasm out into his fist, desperate and nothing and shamed.
“He was a great man.”
Draco makes a soft, desperate sound in the back of his throat.
Draco glances up at him then, and for a moment, their eyes meet. He's always been able to say no, always had a way out. He still can.
, a pet.
And Draco - to his utmost humiliation - does.
Harry rolls his eyes. "What do you think?"
"No," Harry says, quite patiently for someone who hasn't quite made eye contact since they'd got out of the bath. "We're an
He hums. "Just a little," he says, which is somewhat of an exaggeration given the complexity. Harry's not wearing any clothes, and the part of Draco that's been bred to live and breathe etiquette shivers with the flagrant rule-breaking.
"Don't worry, Piglet," Harry says, and his fingers are back again, and so is a second chocolate. "There are as many chocolates as you want to eat. No one's going to tell you no. They're all for you. You have permission to eat as many as you would like."
Draco looks up at him. He knows his eyes are probably wide. He probably looks like a complete state and he's barely got started.
Draco makes a sharp sound around Harry’s cock.
"I already am," Harry says, and Draco's whole body reacts to that, shivering in heated, incredible joy. Harry's hand stills on the back of Draco's neck. "But if you're good, I'll fuck you this weekend."
Harry's smile is almost sad. "And where do the Malfoys carry their weight?"
"I’d been doing this work for the Muggle Outreach Centre," Harry says. "Before I went to work for them, just stupid stuff really. Trying to track magical signatures and stuff. Because sometimes we go and see primary schools and we wanted to make sure that when we went outside to the playing fields to play our games, we didn’t, you know, lose anyone."
Draco looks at him, wide-eyed. He doesn't want to talk. He's not even sure if he could, right this second.
"It's light enough outside," Harry says, looking away from Draco, and taking his hand away too. "No need to put the lamp on yet." And then he walks away from Draco like he's not even there, and Draco can't move, spelled still, couldn't even if he wanted to, but part of him longs for Harry's attention. He watches as Harry sinks down onto the sofa and takes off his boots. They're muddy, but they don't leave a mark on the carpet - another useful spell Harry's used without saying it out loud. Draco would be jealous, except his charms skills significantly outweigh Harry's, even if his non-verbal spells don't.
Yes, this.
Harry presses closer. His breath is hot against Draco's neck. "I want it to be."
"I can't," Draco says, because all he can think about is Harry playing with his nipples and telling him about being covered in cake, and about masturbating into a bowl and having to lap it all up, and about treating Draco like an animal. Thinking about it is already getting his little cock all stiff, but it doesn't mean it's easy to say out loud.
"You can beg for it," Harry tells him, kissing the skin just behind Draco's ear, where he's ticklish and can't help but tremble. "My darling. You can beg for it."
Harry rolls his eyes. "The floor will clean, Draco. It's all right. It's just mud."
Draco gets down on his hands and knees. He’ll be obedient until the end of time if Harry lets him. It feels like he’s cracking his very soul in two to let Harry inside. He wonders if Harry knows.
Draco glances over at the bakery box. He shouldn't have another cake. All those years of being sent sweets and cakes, all these years living with his mother and indulging her in lonely afternoon teas with tiny cakes, and him never being able to eat all that he wanted. Never giving in to how much he wanted the cream cakes.
"You're my nothing," Harry says. "You're mine."
"Sir," Draco says again.
"Of course," Draco says, and he helps Harry out by pouring some milk into a milk jug and positioning on the tray next to the cafetière and two cups and saucers. "How is it that we have cups and saucers in the same meal as you making me serve myself potatoes out of a pan?"
It's all right, but it's not enough.
"I was going to ask you for a nappy this morning," Harry says, still touching him. "But I couldn't. I couldn't say it out loud."
Harry keeps stroking his cheek, even as he's murmuring the immobilisation spell, and a curious kind of stillness sweeps across Draco's skin, gentle but firm, and he's held where he is, eyes still on Harry's. The spell's warm against his skin.
“I’m seeing Hermione and Ron on Friday night for dinner,” he says, climbing back under the covers. His toes are cold and he warms them against Draco’s calves. “After that I was just going to see what came up.”
"Going to come all over your face," Harry says, flushed. "Going to make sure you know who owns you." His hand wraps around his cock but Draco's not having that. This is his job. He pushes Harry's hand away so that he can curl his own fist around Harry's hard cock, masturbating him, his mouth already open and waiting. "Fuck," Harry says. "You know just what I want. My dirty little piglet. My pig."
Draco stills. "My first time?"
"By ringing the doorbell," Harry says.
"You're not," Harry says, and he reaches down and cups Draco's dick in his hand. "Unless you can show me your dick in less than two seconds. Can you?"
"You keep saying I'm not getting what I need. That's the
"Nipples," Harry says. "And the underwear area. You have seen a bra before, right?"
"Even at Hogwarts?"
"I think if you'd kissed me then, I might have kissed you back."
"Life's too short," Harry says, shortly. "If it was a rule of etiquette my Aunt Petunia thought was essential, then I definitely don't abide by it. No pans on the table? Fuck that. Saves on washing up."
He finds his way to Harry's laundry room and sets the first load going. He'd brought his own washing powders, shrunk down into his pocket, and he disposes of Harry's without that much consideration. Then, whilst that's washing, he gets his mending kit out and goes back to the bedroom to set about mending Harry's clothes.
Draco closes his eyes. Three times, at a minimum, but it's more like-- "Five, usually."
Harry just grins at him. "Finish what you're working on, it's all right. I can keep myself busy."
Draco's hands twitch. He reaches for his wand, then stops himself. "It's the cottage," he says softly, then he glances up at Harry. "It's for the cottage."
"Louder," Harry says.
"You sure?"
He comes, untouched, and it’s everything. Harry kneels over him and masturbates until he’s coming too, all over Draco’s tits like he promised, and Draco’s skin feels like it’s on fire.
"Yes," Draco says, for there it is, just like Harry says. Terribly small.
"A bit," Harry says. "But really, you just carry it with you and try to find ways to make it hurt less."
Draco wraps his arms around Harry's shoulders, and hugs him. "How does it feel?"
“Tales of your fame have spread far and wide,” Draco says, but Harry’s pressing closer and grinning into Draco’s skin, so Draco prolongs the joke because when Harry smiles it’s like Draco’s heart’s just opening up to let him crawl inside. “My hero, the saviour.”
He leans in and kisses Harry's cheek, flushing as he does so.
"Please don't go to any trouble."
"I'm the one who makes you come," he says. "Me."
"Marks and Spencer," Harry repeats. "Good for pants, socks, and pyjamas. And other things, but mostly them. It's Muggle, so you don't need to wear a glamour. It can just be me and you."
"Come on the floor, Piglet," Harry says. "Come on."
“You need it,” Harry says. “You’re a horny little piglet.”
"Even if it comes with blankets and bottles?"
"Who's Jamie Oliver?"
*****
"Just holes," Draco says. "That's what I am, just a hole." He's staring down at his cock, and he's so fucking hard. His tip's slick with pre-come and want.
Draco studies him for a moment. "What do you need?"
"That she's married," Harry says. "His name's Ron. You might like each other if you give each other a chance."
Heat settles in Draco's belly. He can't respond, but there's no need. He's where he needs to be, drooling around Harry's cock, servicing Harry however he needs. Spit runs down his chin. Above him, Harry hasn't even started eating. All Draco can hear is the rustle of pages.
"You're not, are you?"
"That's right," Harry says, opening a box of something that Draco can't see. "What else?"
too."
"Fondant fancies," Harry says. "I thought maybe I could wank as I watched you eat them."
"That's right, Draco. Not as stupid as you're behaving, are you?"
"You swallowed it once. Whilst falling. It was another reason for me to hate you an awful lot. I was absolutely obsessed with hating you. It was my number one hobby. For years."
Draco shivers. "Can we do that?"
Harry rolls his eyes. "Draco Malfoy, compromising."
"You have no reason to trust me," he says. "I know that. I don't ask you to. But you can trust Harry to tell you if he's happy. So you should ask him if he is. If he feels safe. You should ask him that."
like," Draco says.
"You cannot," Draco says. But then, he did live in a house with the Dark Lord. "You can't, can you?"
"It's you," Ron Weasley says, when he answers the door.
"I am," Harry says, taking off the rest of his clothes and climbing onto the bed so that he's kneeling over Draco, who's still under the covers. "Because you love me, and I love you."
He has an armful of clothes by the time Harry clears his throat from somewhere behind him.
"Making conversation," Harry says. "A bit more public friendly than 'how long have you been getting your dick out and wanting people to use you', don't you think?"
“I notice it all,” Harry says. “It’s been years and I still can’t help myself. You can open your eyes.”
Harry hums. "Sometimes it's kind. If someone likes sweet things, sometimes it's kind."
Harry takes a few minutes to return, and when he does, he's holding the leather lead rolled up in his hand.
"I mostly forgot I owned it," Harry says with a sort of half shrug. His hands are deep in his pockets as the rain falls around them. "Not forgot, I suppose. I just didn't have a particular use for it. I didn't want to get rid of it - and who would want it if I did? But I didn't know what to do with it either."
Harry rolls his eyes. "I suppose," he says. "Hurry up, some of us want to get fucked tonight."
Harry’s smile is crooked. "If you’d like," he says. Is that another piece of the jigsaw puzzle? There’s something about Draco wanting to look after Harry that’s supposed to tell him something, but he just can’t figure out what it is.
. "Tempting," he says finally.
Neither Draco nor Harry pay him any attention. Harry's smile has turned into something of a smirk. It makes Draco's fingers twitch.
"Are you getting in too?" Draco asks, still confused.
Draco has no plans to see Harry before going to Scotland at the weekend, so it comes as somewhat of a surprise to find him standing on the doorstep on Thursday evening.
The clock by the door chimes a
Harry's sitting on one of the sofa's, knee drawn up to his chest. He's changed too, into another hoodie and jeans, and his hair's a mess. He's reading another Muggle magazine.
"Yeah," Harry says, hand furious on his cock. "My piglet," he says, and comes. He comes all over Draco's stomach and his cock and his balls and his crack, stripes of come across Draco's skin.
Draco sits back down, and settles his teacup neatly on its saucer. “There’s nothing to be embarrassed about,” he says. “It’s a nursery and it’s yours. Let’s not waste our lives distressing ourselves unnecessarily. Don’t be embarrassed about wanting to be looked after.”
Draco's breath steadies, and slows. He's nothing. He's not important. He's forgotten.
"A hole," Draco says. "A come rag."
Draco goes down onto his hands and knees. His cocklet hangs down between his legs, his trousers hanging awkwardly off his hips. He drops his head.
," Harry says, climbing back into bed. He arranges himself, untidily limpet-like, at Draco's side.
"Hello, Draco," Harry Potter says, reaching for his drink. "I'm glad you took me up on my invitation. How was it when you got home last night?"
Except, when Tim and Dave have finished and gone, Harry's not by his side anymore. Harry's braced with his hands on the wall and his trousers down by his knees, and Harry's found someone with a big enough cock to fuck him. Harry's found someone to bracket him against the wall and fuck his cock into Harry's arse. Harry's found someone who's more than just a hole, more than just a rag to come on. Harry's found someone who isn't covered in strangers' come. Harry's found a tall blond guy with strong shoulders and a slim waist to fuck him, to hold his hips and slam his cock inside.
"Not like it works for you."
Draco's mouth waters. The decadence. The exquisite, extravagant indulgence of Harry buying these for him, of shrinking them down in his bag, of him picking one carefully and holding it out for Draco to see.
"I bought them for you," Harry says, coming a little closer. On the wall behind him is a large painting, a little abstract, of a wolf and a stag and a dog. The sun's going down and the sky's orange. It's obviously an original. The frame isn't quite right and Draco can't help but wonder if he can find Harry a better one, one that fits better with the room. "Draco."
"Tell me it's all right," Harry says quietly, once they've turned the lights off. "Tell me it doesn't change anything."
There's a pause. "I could very easily tell you that what I wanted was just the opposite side of the coin to what you wanted."
"Harry's here," he says simply.
. He looks away.
Draco rolls his hips up and helps Harry get rid of his pyjamas over the side of the bed. Harry settles in-between Draco's legs and cups Draco's balls in his hand.
"A lot. You'll have to tell Mrs Weasley that I enjoyed it."
Harry doesn’t say anything to that, but he presses even closer, and slips his hand into Draco’s.
Draco takes a piece of toast and licks the butter from his fingertips. "I thought you might make love to me again," he says, and just saying the words out loud take some careful saying. "Maybe one of the ways you talked about last night."
Harry's note was mercifully short.
“How about you come up,” Draco says. “Come up here. Let me spoil you.”
"A house for every situation."
Harry looks hopeful, and mostly happy, and almost relaxed. It’s nice.
Draco shrugs a shoulder. "I don’t know if I’d describe it as fun. Important, maybe. It means a lot."
He takes his time picking, moderation being everything. The gold ones were too beautiful. The dark ones too exquisite. He goes for the third kind, and takes a bite. It's rich, and strong, and he groans with it.
"Good," Draco says, and he holds out his wand to lock the flat from prying visitors, slipping it away in the wand pocket in his trousers before going over and dropping to his knees in front of Harry. He's unbuttoning Harry's jeans and pulling them down even before Harry's realised quite what's happening; at that point, Harry helps, pushing his underwear and trousers down out of the way.
It's a while later when they pull apart, and Draco considers for a second his inexperience, and then lets it go because Harry looks pink and well-kissed, skin flushed and smiling. "So when do you want to to eat cake from the floor, then?"
Then he walks - via the writing desk in his father's old office -  through his flat to the back terrace, where the balcony houses his virtually empty owlery. The side terrace is where they used to entertain guests, back in the day. They're both as empty as each other nowadays, except for the periodic residence of Draco's owl, Estelle, who is snooty and dismissive and spends most of her time away from her perch.
"Don’t move," Harry chides, without looking up from his book.
And then, after a final check in the mirror to remove any imperfections, he goes back into the bedroom and kneels by Harry's side of the bed, and slides his hand into Harry's hair to wake him up.
"A come rag," Harry says. "Just something to be used."
"I know you are," Harry says, his hand stroking down Draco's neck and coming to a rest in the small of Draco's back. "Because what you want is shameful, isn't it? Spread your legs a little, Draco, and then anyone walking in can see you properly, see that hole of yours and your balls, and they can laugh at how little your cock is. Do you like it when they laugh, Draco?"
Harry looks at where Draco's looking, then rolls his eyes. "Such a fucking animal," he says. He throws a cloth in Draco's general direction. "Clean that up." Harry's cock is still hanging out of his trousers and he doesn't make any move to put it away. He starts to make a plate up for Draco and Draco wants to complain, say that
"It's the only way to do it," Draco says. "Some of the protections are extremely intricate. Having plans like this for the spell work is imperative. They've got to layer together at exactly the right point so that they interact in just the way I want them to."
"No," Draco says, but he's burning red just thinking about it. He eats more cake from Harry's fingers.
"Show off," Draco says, grumbling. He's still flushed and hot and embarrassed.
"You don't want to wear it any longer?"
Draco's hips rock up. Toys, for him. Harry thinking about this away from him, away from here, and
"All right," Harry says. He stops holding on to Draco's shoulders and pats him in the small of the back instead. "Go through to the bedroom. I'll be through in a moment."
"Sorry," he tells Harry after a minute, hiding his face in Harry's neck again. "I'll clean your clothes."
"Weirdo," Draco says, after a pause, and Harry laughs.
He's not sure if he is ready. Is there anything more shameful than going to the toilet outside, like he really was no more than an animal? It's not something that he'd ever really considered, not like he'd imagined all those men in the back corridors, using him and coming on him and letting him suck them off like he was nothing. He'd masturbated to that over and over again, fantasising about being used, about being holes, being ignored, being forgotten in favour of being used. He'd never let himself get close to imagining the things that he and Harry have done, though. The way they've fallen ever further down the rabbit hole of Draco's desperate need for humiliation and shame, but the whole time he's fallen, he's had Harry holding on to him, never letting him go. He'd never for a second fantasised about getting everything that he's ever wanted, and being loved at the same time.
"Fine," Draco says, tapping his finger against the edge of the table. "Everything's been fine."
"Yes," Draco says. "Sometimes I think you see inside of me."
Draco knows the answer to that one. "A come rag."
"I brought sweet things," Harry says, picking up a box from just outside the bedroom door. "They're yours if you get into bed."
It's later, when Harry's cleaned them up with a gentle
"It's nice in here," Harry says. He leans back against Draco's desk, legs stretched out. Draco has to work very hard not to react to Harry virtually sitting on his desk; growing up he had been taught very explicitly the rules for climbing and sitting on furniture, and Harry always seems to ignore all of them. There is also something remarkably intimate about sitting this close to Harry's thighs, especially now he's made the move towards better fitting clothes. "It's very you."
Harry fumbles in the pocket of his shirt, and comes out with something tiny, which -- when Harry whispers a spell -- grows into a tin. A tin of Turkish Delight. "You like Turkish Delight," he says, like it's not even a question, which it sort of isn't. His mother had sent him tin after tin at school, and Draco had savoured his two pieces and then let the rest of the house at the remains. "Rose and pistachio."
"I never thought about it," Harry says. He's poring over Draco's plans. "These are incredible. How do you decide what to charge people? This sort of spell work can't come cheap."
"Or smug superiority. Do you remember that time you gave Rita Skeeter all those stories about me during the Triwizard Tournament?"
"Plate," Harry says, and then he peels the lid of a carton of ketchup. He wraps his hand around Draco's, and makes him pick up a chip, then dip it in the tomato ketchup ."Now, eat."
Hermione glances at him sharply. She hasn't heard Harry yet, and isn't attuned to the wards.
"I was with Ginny Weasley," Draco says, eyes still closed. "When you sent me that message."
, and then they're in Harry's upstairs hall, right by his full length mirror.
with his perfectly mediocre robes, and next to Harry Potter with his magical scar, he's practically invisible. He does think quite a lot of the pile of clothes in Draco's arms though, particularly if it means Harry Potter's going to buy them. It almost doesn't matter that Draco might just have broken something that he holds quite dear, because Heathen takes the piles of clothes into the changing rooms and Harry spends the next half hour changing in and out of them, trooping out and into the shop so that Draco can say either yes or no. The no pile is bigger than the yes pile, but then Draco has always been able to distinguish between what is mediocre and what is a classic cut.
"Well, if I don’t, then maybe I can give you part of it. Or some of it. But I don’t think that’s going to happen."
“Yes,” Draco says.
Hermione gives Draco the ghost of a wink. "I adapt to circumstances."
"What is it?"
"I'll come through with you," she says. "Kitchens are always the nicest bit of any house, anyway."
Draco crawls over to the cake, his mouth watering. He longs to taste it, to put his mouth to the cream, but he's not allowed. He has to masturbate on it, like the filthy little piglet he is. His useless little cock is so stiff and he wraps his hand around it, even though he's really too small to fist his cock. His cocklet disappears inside his fist. It's not going to take him long to come, imagining what's coming next. Just being naked and on his knees for Harry is enough to push him to the brink, but couple that with Harry virtually ignoring him, getting on with his breakfast like Draco's not even there, it gets him almost there already. But then, adding that to the fact that he's going to be coming on a cake that he's then going to have to put his face in, that he's going to eat for breakfast, it's barely going to take him any time at all.
The teacakes are buttery and hot and fully of juicy, delicious raisins. The butter runs down his fingers and down Harry's and when they finish the plate, neither of them look particularly full, so Draco replenishes it with the same amount again. It's worth it for Harry's smile as he holds his tea cup with licked-clean fingers.
"There were," Harry says. "You don't have to live up to them anymore. Not if you don't want to."
Harry, sitting next to him on the sofa with his knee pulled up to his chest and his cheek pressed to Draco's shoulder, offers him another After Eight.
"Greedy piglet," Harry admonishes, but he's smiling and reaching for the box again. "Do you want more?"
"I'm only good for my holes," Draco says, and he might just come like this, right on the floor with his arse cheeks spread.
"And you like watching me eat them."
"Good, so long as you do," Harry says. "Come on. I've made us food. Practice looking happier, we've got to make stupid faces at each other over the table as we eat, like we're young and in love and out on a date."
Draco doesn't answer too quickly, still trying to fit the last bits of his body and his mind and his voice back together in the right way. "I am," he says, and even though he doesn't want to, he tries to pull away. "Sorry for being so--" he stops. "Clingy."
He can only imagine what he looks like. Spit all down his face from holding Harry's cock in his mouth, bits of food on his cheeks and his nose and his chin. Cock fucking leaking. Skin flushed from the humiliation. His hair must be going everywhere after having Harry's hand in it, fucking it up.
“Just so you know,” Draco says. “I want to do it.”
"I will," Draco says. "I will." He's always imagined it would be faster than this, that fucking was rushed, but Harry's slow. He's fucking him so slowly that it's going to be easy for Draco to masturbate and come again; it'd be hard for him not to. Harry's telling him everything he knows Draco will want to hear.
"Don't keep it inside," Harry says. "Make all the noise you want, Piglet. I already know how filthy you are."
"All of them," Harry says, and Draco lifts his gaze to meet Harry's. Harry cups Draco's face in his hand. "Everything you're wearing today. Property of the House of Potter."
"I want to be with you," Harry says again. "I want to be with you and it doesn’t matter if you don’t want to do what I’m asking. I don’t care. I just want there to be an
"My darling," Harry says, and it's as if the reverence in Harry's voice takes root in Draco's chest and steals his breath. "Draco, my darling."
"No," Draco says. "Just some socks and slippers and something warm to put over your pyjamas. I've got a jumper you might like."
The coin glows with a message that says
about Draco. Jonathan, who's about a foot taller than Harry and twice as broad. Harry's glamour is even taller than Harry himself is, so Jonathan's fucking huge. "Piglet, for fuck's sake. Get your tits out."
"I'd ask you if you had an opinion on what underwear you wanted," Harry says after a while, without looking up, "but it's not like you would want to express an opinion even if you weren't bound still. So I get to pick my piglet's knickers."
"I imagine so," Harry says. "He lives there. They share children, etc."
It takes a long time for Harry’s breathing to settle, for him to shift position so that he wasn’t kneeling up over him anymore, instead sitting down next to him and resting his cheek against Draco’s shoulder.
"I thought we could apparate," Harry says, but he's opening a little velvet bag from his pocket instead, and putting their shopping inside of it. The bag's tiny, but their large shopping bags go in easily. "The Mary Poppins effect," he says, like that's supposed to mean something, but it doesn't so Harry just puts the little bag back in his pocket.
Draco shudders with it, need pulsing through him. "Harry," he begs, hips rolling up, begging for something to rub up against. He'll rut. He's only an animal, after all. "Please. Let me come. I want to come."
"This remains a terrible idea," Draco says, sotto voce. Harry has apparated them to a small lane apparently around the corner from Hermione Granger's house, and for a moment, they stay wrapped around each other, as Draco's stomach returns to its normal place and not in his throat. Apparation is also a terrible idea if you're not quite feeling well, which Draco isn't, because he's as nervous as he can remember being.
Draco whines again, but Harry just keeps stroking his hair. "You've cleaned up," he says. "You've cleaned it all up. You can stop now."
He shames himself for coming after barely a minute, but it's his first blow job and Harry Potter is on his knees for him, so Draco allows himself the premature orgasm. He can't imagine he'll be receiving many blow jobs in the future; his dick's tiny and mostly useless.
Harry's hand strokes over the curve of his bum and down to cup his balls. "I could immobilise you here," he whispers, and the hairs on Draco's arms stand up on end as Harry leans in and blows a warm breath across his skin. "Like a statue, like you're part of the furniture. Like you're nothing but something to walk by and ignore."
Harry shakes his head. "Turns out he just really likes dragons and magic stories. Not an ounce of magic in him."
He keeps licking until Harry strokes at his hair. "That's enough," he says. "That's enough, Draco."
"You'd do it though, wouldn't you? Baby me." He doesn't wait for Draco to respond, which is good because Draco isn't sure he can. "I just want to know what it feels like. I just want to know if it's like I imagine." His eyes are so bright. "I've imagined it such a lot, Draco, you've got no idea. Sometimes I hated myself for it."
The little overgrown lane turns into a street, and to Draco's surprise, it's half full of Muggle cars and children playing. Hermione Granger's house is a semi-detached with a short driveway and a garage, and Draco is firmly reminded of the houses in Martin the Mad Muggle as they go up the drive and ignore the front door in favour of knocking on the side door by the garage. Draco can feel the gentle pulsing of the wards around them.
"I have no idea what you're talking about."
"Yes, sir," Draco says. "I masturbate my tiny little cock until I come on the tiles."
"I like it," Harry says. "But I thought you were just going to tidy up my clothes."
Draco trembles at
"All right," Draco says, and they stay there for on the floor, quiet, and don't say anything else.
Draco stares at the clothes in Harry's hands.
“Do you want to sit for a bit?” Draco asks. He takes his scarf off and transfigures it into a tartan blanket, not giving Harry a chance to say no. He casts a warming charm on it as he sits down, and pats the blanket next to him, an invitation to Harry that he hopes he won’t turn down.
"Yes," Draco says. He stops himself saying
"I don't think this cottage is an example of how to hide money in property."
Draco can feel himself going pink. "I can't."
It is only Draco's immense self control that ensures he remains at his desk and at his work rather than pacing the flat and driving himself slowly mad at the thought of what's coming, of Harry fucking him, of all the consequences that that entails.
Harry fucks his thighs, dick sticky and slick, the cake catching at the hairs on his legs, on his pubic hair, and every pull, every tug, every catch makes it even better.
"Uncle Harry, hey?"
It's the desperate sadness that threatens to engulf him, and that's worse than anything else. "I know, my darling. Just come over here and let me hug you."
Harry starts to lead him upstairs, and this is new. They've stayed firmly downstairs before, but he doesn't say anything. He's not exactly sure of where they stand tonight, at least at this point. It feels like Harry's gearing up for something rather than anything else, and Draco's willing to follow him. He's the same, buoyant at the thought of what's coming, of getting to go down on his knees and be humiliated and shamed and used. Even more than that, to have Harry take him, to take charge and decide where they're going and what he's going to wear. It's easy to follow Harry up the stairs and along the hall to what must be his bedroom.
"As I'll ever be," Harry says, his hand hot in Draco's.
Draco nods. He wriggles at the idea of being Harry's piglet for the day.
"Such a little thing," Harry says, still touching him. "Such a tiny, pointless little thing."
"It was," Draco says. "I think my father wished I'd been your friend. He liked powerful people."
"No," Harry says. "I just know you are. It's all right."
"Then what do you do? Do you masturbate?"
He’s made such a mess.
"Hilarious," Draco says, and his heart's pounding.
"I know," Harry says. He stops leaning against the doorframe then, stepping closer. He takes off his coat and his scarf and leaves them over the edge of the sofa. "Show me them."
The dog bed is soft and warm and Draco curls up on it, one knee up to his chest, waiting. He rests his cheek on his knee, trying to ignore his stiff little cock. Harry is ignoring him, drinking his tea and reading
There’s a pause. “Is this one of those moments where I’m supposed to laugh?”
Draco leans in and presses a kiss to Harry's forehead. "Morning, sleepyhead," he says. "Would you like me to show you your nursery before breakfast?"
"Very nice," Harry says, leaning in to press his mouth to Draco's collarbone. "I told Hermione I was in love with you."
Draco is in his underwear; he's standing in the middle of his room in his vest, pants, and socks. Harry has laughed at his underwear before, telling him that his underpants were so long they were practically trousers, but then Harry thought going outside in a
"Perfect," Harry says. "You can imagine her knowing what you're doing in it."
It's an hour before Draco comes to find Harry to tell him he can come back upstairs. The kitchen is clean from lunchtime, and Draco has made use of Harry's bathroom and washed away all the dirt and spit and come from earlier. His hair is washed and neat again, spelled tidy. He's got rid of the worst of the creases in his clothes, short-term spells to take away some of the marks and lines from where he'd worn them that morning. His shoes are laced and he's buffed them up so that they shine again. He stands by the mirror upstairs and watches himself looking back at him, at the uniformed valet he's become.
"Did you," Harry says levelly.
"Ron," Hermione hisses.
In the kitchen, in the middle of the floor, is a single chocolate gateau, covered in chocolate cream and little chocolate stars. It's sitting in Draco's red food bowl, but this time the gold lettering says DIRTY PIGLET in all caps.
Harry just looks at him. "Everyone wants to fix me so that I’m not broken."
Harry looks at him. "Eat as many of the chocolates as you'd like, Draco. They're yours. You should have as many sweets as you want."
"How's the work going?" Ginny asks, like she's on perfectly friendly conversational terms with Draco, instead of this being maybe the only time they've ever talked. "Any surprises?"
Harry comes back with the tea, and the knitted blanket off the bed. He's got that little, magical bag with him again, but Draco still feels hazy and isn't up for asking questions. Instead, he waits until Harry's got himself settled on the tiny sofa, and then lets himself be manoeuvred until he's curled up with his legs over Harry's lap, and the blanket over the two of them.
Harry laughs at that, and embarrassment courses through him.
"Let's get you cleaned up, Piglet," Harry says, stroking his hand through Draco's hair. He unclips the harness and helps Draco out of it, and then unbuckles his collar. He puts them both onto the closed lid of the toilet. There's no where else to put them in the tiny bathroom. "Into the bath on your hands and knees, please. That's how animals get washed."
Harry's eyes are bright. He slips back into Draco's hug. "I know what it feels like now. The nappy. I can ask for it again. It won't ever be as hard as the first time."
"I'm covered in come," he says out loud, touching his face. "Just a fucking come rag."
Draco's cheeks burn. "A cocklet," he says. "Nothing."
"With Harry, for the weekend," he says. "Would you like to wait in the sitting room whilst I make the tea?"
. There are also big furry dressing gowns and slippers and fluffy socks.
. An animal. A pet. He nods, and Harry leans down to press his mouth to Draco's forehead in a kiss.
Harry rolls his eyes. "For someone who's obsessed with ironing, you are criminally uninformed about Muggle fashion."
“Don’t be,” Harry says, and then he comes over to the sofa and kneels over Draco and buries his face in Draco’s neck. Draco — a little uncertainly — wraps his arms around Harry’s back, and Harry presses closer, hugging him back.
The charmed coin he and Harry sometimes use to communicate vibrates in the glass bowl by his bedside, and with a sigh, Draco picks it up. It's warm in his palm, with
There is literally no way on earth that Draco is drinking wine of this vintage out of a
"All right. I'll leave it." There's a pause. "You've at least got nice PJs, right?"
"I've been imagining it," Harry says conversationally. "I've been imagining two cakes, though, one for you to eat from your bowl and the other one for you to fuck."
"A one on one game of catch the snitch," Harry says. "Kinky."
Draco offers Harry a biscuit. "I’m there to do a job," he says finally.
"What are you saying?"
"I like it when you touch me," Harry says.
"Less of the taking over the world, and more of the being forced into saving it," Harry says. "Imagine how good a teenager I could have been had I not had someone trying to kill me every single year."
"Very good, Sir," Draco says, and carries on.
The club is busy and loud and the music pounds through his body and settles in his chest. People look him up and down as they pass, at his clothes, and Draco's never been poorly dressed in his life. His cheeks burn. He'd never have chosen something like this, this kind of casual humiliation. It wouldn't have come to his attention to even try it. They stop at the bar for a vodka and lemonade, and then Harry's leading him back through the crowds until they're going down a flight of steps and into a corridor busy with guys. There's a space when the corridor widens out, back in the shadows.
, and it's like no kitchen he's ever been in. It's unrelentingly Muggle, down to the tiles and the
"Normally she hates shopping but I think she was intrigued by the fact I actually asked Ginny for help."
And the pyjamas are
Draco burns red. His dick jumps.
"People use old socks for come rags," Harry says. "They use any old crap. Something they don't care about anymore. What do you think that makes you?"
It's only then that Draco realises he's started whimpering, soft little sobs into Harry's skin. He presses his nose into Harry's neck. His body feels locked in position, even though he's free; his hands are still laced together behind his back.
"I promise," Draco says again. "I promise you."
"I think it's very likely," Harry agrees, "given how I currently feel about you. Unfortunately I was a little too tied up in ridding the world of an evil dictator, so I didn't really have any time for all that, you know, important emotional growth and healthy stuff you're supposed to do as a teenager, so that you're not a fucked up adult with a side helping of post traumatic stress disorder."
Harry's hand stays in his hair, stroking. "My darling," he says. "I'm sorry."
The address on the business card is Harry's home. He answers the door after a too-long wait, still dressed in a shirt and loosened tie like he's been to a meeting.
Harry's hand is still in his hair. "Stop whining," he says. "You can suck me later. Greedy piglet."
"Was there anything there, or are you just trying to make me feel better?"
He closes his eyes and presses closer instead. "I want to give you what you need too."
"School was a long time ago," Harry counters.
Harry taps Draco's thigh with the toe of his shoe. "Don't fucking wank," he says. He turns back to the guy. "Can't take him anywhere." He pauses. "You want a go?"
. "That may be acceptable."
He doesn't clean up after himself. He lies in his own mess, Harry's come drying across his back, until Harry urges him up and onto his knees.
"Just so I’m clear. You’re not, you know, generally averse to the idea of me and you."
Harry leans forward then, and holds the cake by Draco’s ear, so that Draco has to twist to try and eat it from Harry’s cupped hand. The layers are already going everywhere. The cake’s rich and alcoholic and full of cream. He’s making such a mess.
Harry shifts in his arms. "When I first saw you," he says, "you were crying out for this. You needed it so desperately it was coming off you in waves. You think I haven’t seen that part of you? You think I don’t know you at all?"
The second guy, he raises an eyebrow at Draco at the same time as going for the zip of his trousers, and Draco prefers that, like he's just a service to be utilised, a hole to be filled. His dick's not as wide as the first guy's, but Draco's jaw still aches. But then someone else comes through from the main bar, looking for the guy getting his dick sucked, and the new guy just rolls his eyes and says,
Harry looks tired, and like he hasn't bothered to get changed. He's in his robes - crumpled, Draco notes, with a Valet's efficiency, because there's still a lot to do on Harry's wardrobe, and Draco has it listed in his head - and underneath that a shirt and tie. "I'm not having sex with you tonight."
"Do you know," Harry says, as they file in-between racks of short skirts and longer skirts and skirts with splits up the side, "this makes the fact that you like to get naked in front of me even dirtier."
"How was dinner?" Draco asks, even as Harry's nudging Draco up so that he can slide his pyjama shirt over his shoulders.
Draco drops his head and crawls after Harry.
Draco colours. "Sorry," he says. He slips them off and then folds them up and puts them on the bed. His dick is pitifully hard. "Can I leave my socks on?"
Draco, skin flushed and dick jutting out, stands, and looks, and wants.
, but he hopes him not saying anything at all is loud enough for Harry to understand.
"Breakfast is ready," he says, coming back in laden with tea and toasted teacakes. "Would you like to sit in front of the fire?"
Draco shakes his head. "No," he says. "You read me really well."
But then, then, Harry comes to a stop in front of the dog and cat beds. They all look relatively small on the shelf, but the labels promise that they're magically expandable for any pet size.
"Servants eat after their masters," Draco says. His face is hot. "And never at the same table."
"I want it less than you want your thing, that's all," Harry says quickly. "It's fine to want it less. Just because I'm not asking for it every other day doesn't mean I don't want what you built for me. You made that for me. I'll use it, I promise."
Draco can give him this, and this again, and anything else Harry wants. He rather thinks he could give it to him forever, which is telling in its own way. He strokes his hand over the small of Harry's back, brushing over the waistband of the nappy. "You never have to be ashamed, not with me. Not of what you want."
Harry smirks. "Just think, when we're away in Scotland, you'll be mine to do what I want with for a whole weekend."
"You should take more care of your clothes," he says, fingers grazing a pile of discarded hoodies. Harry's bed is large and his sheets unpressed. They're creased, the duvet a bit haphazardly pulled up to a mountain of pillows. They're also green. "Don't you press or iron anything?"
"You can wank if you'd like," Harry says, as Draco leans in to take the first mouthful, chocolate already catching his lip and his chin.
"Maybe it's in your bedroom," Draco says. He unbuttons his coat, and slips it off and over his arm. "Is there somewhere I can hang my coat?"
Draco whines. He doesn't know what else to do, which part of him to move. His face is already chocolatey. He can't look down, not at the mess he's made all over the kitchen floor by sitting on his cake.
"Noted," Harry says, and they up the pace as they enter the wood and see the Quidditch pitch coming up in front of them.
Draco shakes his head. He's full for now. It's been a lovely evening, so far. Not that he needed to, but Harry has proved that he can be romantic. They've had dinner and danced in Draco's living room and had coffee and chocolates. Draco's warm right down deep inside of his chest. When he's with Harry he feels settled in a way he never has been before in his life, and never even imagined being able to be. He's stopped feeling like he's tearing himself apart wanting something he can't have; in those endless months and years before he'd starting going out and begging for someone to use him, before he'd met Harry, he'd spent half of his time half sure his chest was going to tear itself in half just to let his desperation out.
"Hello," Draco says, answering his door.
"No," Harry says. "You stay out here and commune with nature. I'll make breakfast."
"My dirty piglet," Harry says, stroking his hair. He's gentle for a moment, and then he takes his hand away and scoops up some of the cake and icing, smearing it over Draco's cheek. He holds his hand in front of Draco's mouth and Draco licks at it, tries to lick him clean. He lets Draco keep licking him even as he's running his other hand down Draco's back and over his arse, where he's dirty and there's cake stuck to his bum. "Spread your legs, Draco."
"I'm honoured," Harry says, and Draco wants to weep with it all over again. His breath catches in his throat. His eyes water a little and he has to blink as he looks up at Harry. "My darling," Harry goes on, stroking Draco's hair, his cheek, his jaw. "I've been really looking forward to this weekend."
Draco ignores the fact that his dick has just got hard. The one benefit to having a stupid little dick is that when it gets hard in situations where it shouldn't, it doesn't exactly come across as obvious. "Cautiously positive," he lies.
Draco cries out. It feels like it's wrenched from inside of him.
Draco considers a life without neat, pressed clothes. His mother might have a conniption if he showed up at her door in anything that looked as untidy as Harry's clothes pile. He's not sure he
Draco nods. "I'll make tea if you'd like, whilst you get changed. And then I can get out of your hair."
Draco's skin heats. "I do," he says, and the admittance makes him tremble.
"But you did," Draco says. "I was your nemesis. I tell you, there's a teenage version of me out there that's just had all his dreams come true. That's all I ever wanted."
, it's fucking great.
The want.
"I love it," Draco says. "Love being this dirty."
Draco can't help but feel a little self-conscious. He does all of his work from here, when he's not out in people's houses. There's almost a whole wall full of neatly labelled scrolls of charms plans, all corresponding to his notebooks and his reports. His bookshelves take up another wall, his collection of books on charms, and wards, and all the notable charms masters of the past two centuries.
"You still haven't told me what you want."
"Right now you're not," Harry reminds him.
"Cool," Harry says, and kisses him.
His dick's already hard, useless and small, hanging between his legs.
"Is it embarrassing?" Harry asks. He cuts up his bacon and eats a bit.
"What are you good for?" he asks.
"He wore flip flops," Draco says, but his heart's not in it. To Harry, was this the equivalent of meeting Draco's mother? Meeting Hermione Granger and her family?
And then blow job guy shoots his load into Draco's mouth, and Draco does a shit job of swallowing. He loses half of it down his chin, and it drips down onto his tiger shirt, even as the guy's stepping back and finishing himself off with a couple of wanks with his fist. His mate's coming to the end too, and Draco turns his attention to him, opening his mouth in case he wants to finish off inside Draco's mouth.
Draco's heart pounds. "And a hundred more nights in."
Draco, humiliatingly tiny and unable to stop himself, comes after barely a touch, pulsing slick over Harry's thumb. The shame trembles over his skin, embarrassment entwining itself with want, with need; Harry is still pressed deep inside of him, his hips still rocking up against Draco's bum.
It's another couple of minutes before they move. The warming charm is starting to wear off, and Draco's knees hurt a little because he's not made it onto the bathroom mat.
Afterwards, Harry settles himself next to Draco, and wraps an arm around Draco's chest.
Draco complains at that. He won't have Harry's cock in his mouth if he's in bed, and he won't have
Harry shoots him a sharp look.
"It's just a nappy," Harry says, but it's muffled in Draco's shoulder.
"No," Harry says. "It's cold out here. Can we talk about this later?"
Draco nods. He takes another sip of wine. There's a fire in the grate, very carefully guarded so that there's no chance of a stray ember catching alight. One of the reasons Draco had gone into charms and wards professionally was because of the sheer amount of work he'd undertaken after being caught in the fire at school; endless nightmares keeping up in the middle of the night, countless hours where he'd read everything he could possibly read about fire charms instead of going back to sleep.
He licks his lips, trying to taste the cake, and he wants Harry to fuck him, wants him to fuck him properly, really own him, but what he's doing right now feels incredible. Harry's incredible.
"Please," Draco manages, and
And Harry comes, just like that, shooting his load over Draco’s face and his mouth and even into his hair.
Draco keeps stroking his hair. “You look after me so well,” he says. “All those sweets. All the ways you know to give me what I need. I want to learn those for you.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco says. “I think I’m just getting this wrong over and over.”
The wait this time is longer. “All right,” Harry says finally. “All right.”
"Ron," Hermione says warningly.
Draco finishes fucking with his hair and puts his brush down. "I have perfectly acceptable pyjamas, Potter."
"You both like me," Harry says, nudging his knee upwards so that it brushes Draco's little cock.
"I didn’t expect to ever actually see you," he says. "I was just looking around for things that I had at home that belonged to other people, and seeing if I could tie the charm to them that way, and, well—" to his credit, he’s looking pretty embarrassed. "I still have your wand."
Draco presses his hand to the brickwork by the doorway, and the bricks start to move to reveal an archway, and another corridor beyond it. Harry's gaze keeps drifting past it, to Draco, to the long gallery, to the coat of arms above the nearby fireplace. "It's a notice-me-not," Draco says softly. "I think the strongest I've ever made." He takes Harry's hand and touches it to the brickwork, and Harry steps back in surprise.
Draco rolls his eyes. "Just because you own nothing I wouldn't burn." He goes over to the dressing table for his wand, murmuring the spell to dry his hair.
Harry doesn't bother rolling his eyes, but clearly that's mostly just because he can't be arsed. "Life's too short," he says. "I said you'd get what you wanted if you came here today."
"To make up for the dinner we didn't have last night," Harry says. The evening had rather stumbled to a half after Harry's awkward orgasm, and Draco had made his excuses to go home and wrap his hand around his stupid little cock and remember Harry's mouth on him.
Harry seems to get it. "If you want to come," he says, "come and rut against my leg, Piglet. Rub yourself off like an animal."
tonight," Harry says. "Company might be all right."
Harry's chin goes up. He's a little pink, like last Saturday when he'd asked Draco if he could wank as Draco ate his way through a packet of Fondant Fancies.
"It isn't a terrible plan," Draco says.
"Good," Harry says. "That's more important than how big it is. How'd you like the stew?"
Nobody in the room comments on what teenage Draco was actually busy doing, which Draco is thankful for. It wasn't his finest decade. So far, none of them have been that great, although the past few weeks have nudged this one up the leaderboard.
Draco's little cock twitches. It's smaller when he's not hard. Just a tiny little cock, useless, and of no importance to anyone but Harry. "Useless," he manages, trying to focus. "Useless little cocklet. You're right. I'm just a desperate, horny piglet. Just holes to be filled."
"Hmmm," Ron says, having won the toss and already on his second glass of wine. "So tell me again, how did you and him end up, you know. Wozzname."
He looks up at Harry then, who's sitting with his legs spread and the line of his cock obvious in his pyjama trousers. And then he lifts his hand, the one he's just wanked himself with, and he licks it until it's wet with spit and clean of come and pre-come.
And Draco can't resist being told what to do, even now. His hips rock up and he comes, into Harry's hand and over his and Harry's dick.
"You make me feel like I'm loved. Like you know me, and you love me anyway. That's not stifling." He struggles to find the words. "It's like you're giving me the world. It's the opposite of stifling. You're the opposite of stifling. I used to be so alone, Harry, you have no idea. But I'm not anymore. I'm not anymore because of you."
"I think it's really nice that you want to share things with me. It means a lot to me."
When he looks up, Harry's watching him. He's getting fucked by a stranger in a seedy back room, and his eyes are on Draco.
Harry pours them both some more tea. Draco’s remains insipid, the way he likes it, and Harry’s is strong like it’s been stewed in a puddle for a long time. "That first time I saw you," he says, "in that back room. I didn’t know it was you."
“Apparently,” Draco says, after a while. “Apparently there are some people out there who remember their school days fondly. They just went there and made friends and did exams and left.”
"Clean it all up," Harry says. "You're not supposed to be enjoying this, but you are, I can tell. Your little cocklet's twitching again."
After the salmon comes another glass of wine and the strawberry tart, and then they clear the table into the kitchen and wait for the kettle to boil for after dinner coffee. Harry's brought decaf, because apparently he's got to be careful about how much caffeine he drinks now that he's older, and Draco watches with some affection as Harry spoons grounds into the cafetière and tears the wrapping off a box of After Eights. Harry's clearly dressed for the evening, in his new, well-fitting trousers and a shirt under his sweater. Draco, who's dressed similarly because he's never allowed himself to work in anything less than formalwear, itches to slip his hands under Harry's clothes and find skin. He doesn't, but he does slip his hands into his pockets and wait for Harry to make up a tray.
He's nothing but an animal, Harry's pet, and as he waits, his breath evens out.
"Maybe she is."
"You can have as many as you like," Harry tells him, and he's close enough to touch now, but he doesn't. "You can have the whole box if you want."
Draco goes to his bedroom to change.
"It's where I should be," Draco says, eyes closing. "It's where I wanted to be. I used to put a silencing charm on the bathroom and say out loud what I wanted. What I was."
Draco attempts to roll his eyes. "At school I would never have believed you could be romantic. All that charging around and trying to take over the world."
And Draco obeys, hooking his arms under his knees and drawing them up to his chest, keeping his legs open so his cock and balls and hole are on display. He makes eye contact with Harry and shame courses through him like a flood.
Draco nods again. His mouth's dry. He gets out of the bath and his legs shake. It's easier to just get down on his knees again. He waits, and Harry's more than two seconds but not by much. He comes back in with two towels in hand, and when he sees Draco on his knees his face softens.
"You don't have to talk about the intricacies of what you want tonight," Draco says. "But maybe we can talk about how loved you are instead."
"Have you touched yourself here before?" Harry asks, ignoring Draco's pleas. He crooks his finger a little inside of him. "Do you do this when you masturbate?"
Harry nods towards the dog bed. "Wait there," he says. "I'm drinking my tea."
. "And we'll have to have another dinner when all four of us get together."
Draco hums a little, and stays.
"The kettle's going on anyway," she says. "Come in when you're done. Get warm before you go home."
"If I want to be fucked, I'll have to go elsewhere," Harry goes on, almost lazy as he runs his fingertips over Draco's hips. "Do you remember that, Piglet? You being cuckolded as I got satisfaction from a man with a real dick."
"Nope," Harry says. "It was with my book."
Draco considers sinking through the floor as an option, and then revises that in his head to going down on his knees with his face in Harry's crotch.
"I know. You can't not mention cupboards for the rest of forever just because I used to live in one. You're allowed to smile at it. I'm smiling, aren't I? Anyway, maybe that's why I like it. That cupboard was the safest place in my entire house. I could have either come out of it hating confined spaces or feeling safe in them, and I bought this house out of choice. And I haven't sold it. There's got to be something here that I like."
"I'd like too," Draco says, still stiff. "I'd like to do that for you."
"Or if you must wear it," Harry goes on, like he wasn't paying any attention to Draco at all, "I'm going to pick it from now on. Frills, I think. Satin. Lace. Pink. The more humiliating the better, don't you think?"
It takes Harry a while to come, and when he does, Draco swallows it all down eagerly, and doesn't pull away. Harry's hand in his hair holds him there, even as Harry's shivering through the aftershocks.
"Hello," Draco says, hurrying along the pavement.
Draco comes to stand by him. "You can come on me."
"Draco," Harry says, and it sounds a little awkward, like he's gearing up to ask if Draco's all right. There's a large box of chocolates on the table, although where Harry had been hiding them when Draco had served him lunch, Draco had no idea.
"A piglet," Harry says. "A come-hungry piglet."
"Oh, he visited then?" Draco reaches for the kettle. "I always like to test the wards very thoroughly."
Harry's breath catches.
Harry nods. "Get it and bring it here. Bring it all here."
. He's allowed it. He doesn't know what to do. He doesn't have the words for this, not in the way Hermione wants him to.
"Harry—"
"You don't have to want it then, but you could tell me. I could look into it, perhaps. Be prepared."
"Piglets don't," Harry says matter-of-factly, but Draco can feel Harry's erection pressing against the small of his back. "Do you eat from bowls on the floor?"
"Don't you own anything comfortable?" Harry asks, looking Draco up and down.
"Someone was thirsty," Harry says, from behind him.
"No, sir," Draco says. He can't help himself. "You should, sir. Please." Just the idea of completely giving up control leaves him breathless with want. "Please, sir. Take it away from me."
As approaches go, it turns out that this one is relatively successful.
"Take them to the counter. I'll pay."
"My cock's so tiny," Draco says, although his voice is partially muffled by the cake.
"Well," Harry says. "Piglets don't wear clothes."
"I bet you would. Imagine him seeing you like this. Seeing that fucking useless cock of yours, and how hard you are. Think of the shame, Draco. Think of what it would feel like if you had to beg him to let you suck him off. You would if I told you to. You'd beg."
"No," Draco says. "I can't explain. I felt a lot. I couldn't stop it from coming out."
"Do you need help?" Draco doesn't want to come in yet. He wants to taste the sea spray on his tongue, watch the seagulls bobbing about on the grey waves, just stand out here a little longer and let the new day settle around him and shape him new.
“Are you hungry, Piglet?” Harry asks and he holds his hand out. There’s a small slice of Victoria sponge there on his palm, icing sugar dusting his fingertips. “Don’t talk. Piglets don’t talk.” He beckons Draco a little closer, a crook of his fingers. “Come here and eat your dessert, Draco.”
Harry arranges himself so he’s comfortable, his back to Draco’s chest.
“I’ve got my eyes closed.”
"Drink your tea," Draco says. "When we get to Scotland we can play Quidditch."
Draco wants to come. He wants to come imagining it, imagining being so far removed from his life right now that he's just an animal for Harry to own. A piglet with endless sweet treats and a tiny little nub of a cock he can rub off on the furniture whilst Harry keeps him on a lead, his little collar bell ringing.
Harry leans in close enough that his breath tickles against Draco's ear.  "When we get home, you're going to show me how you wank when you come in from the clubs, when you're so desperate you can't even get to the bedroom, when you wank all over the floor. And if you show me that, I might even let you use your food bowl for the first time."
"Yes," Draco says. He has some of his beer. It's as foreign a meal as he's ever had. "Earlier… I said that this place was like a cupboard. I didn't mean that. I just, I meant it was small."
"No," Harry says. He brushes a kiss to the underside of Draco's jaw. The few inches of height difference is best when they're together like this. "Not right now. I want to masturbate watching you eat all the sweets you want."
Draco licks his lips. Cake clings to his hips.
Draco can't understand how they get from him humiliating himself on the floor to the two of them sharing a bed with a cake box between them. "Is this us trying?" he asks.
Draco puts his own jumper on then, an arran sweater that's much the same as Harry's except for the colours. Then he holds out his hand, and waits for Harry to take it.
"Hello," Harry says. He's wearing a wool coat, knee length and dark wool, fitted in a way that Harry's clothes normally aren't - at least the ones that Draco hasn't adjusted. He clearly sees Draco looking. "Do you like it? Ginny and Hermione helped me choose it."
“I saw them in the children’s section in Flourish and Blotts,” Draco says. “They’re dragons. I didn’t know if you wanted toys. I was guessing for all of it, really, but the toys more than anything. They’re small and fluffy. They sort of purr, really, rather than blow fire? But their wings move. I didn’t know which colour to get you, that’s why there’s two. An orange one and a black one.”
"Ugh," Ron says. "I'll go and see if the chicken's ready. And if we've got another bottle of wine. We're going to need it."
Draco undoes his trousers and pushes them down to his knees. His stupid little cock bobs in the fucking breeze.
Draco leans in and presses a kiss to Harry's forehead. "That's the point," he says. "Whilst we do this, you don't have to think of anything at all. I'll take care of it all."
"Fair," Harry says. "But I can give you what you want, and I'm pretty sure you'll give me what I want, when I need you to."
"You have cups for coffee and cups for tea, and I don't think they're your mother's."
"You're very astute," she says.
"It's already paid," Draco says. "He paid in full when he said he loved me." He looks away. "Don't let's talk about it anymore tonight."
"Will he do my mate too?"
Draco tries very hard not to let on how sad he feels whenever Harry reveals something so desperately mundane that he's never been allowed to have. "Not in the least," he says after a moment. "Not at all."
Draco gets hard fast enough to show Harry how much he does like that. He hasn't thought about this very much; immobility hadn't really crossed his mind until that time with Harry last week. But the idea of being part of the furniture, of being on display only to be complete ignored, well-- that turns him on. The humiliation of not being worthy of attention, of being walked by and ignored, of being on display but being nothing.
"Settle down, pup," Harry says, and Draco shivers with it. "Just warm my cock. You love cock, don't you?"
He leans down and he gets chocolate icing on his chin even before any makes it into his mouth. It smells incredible, a heavenly rich chocolate cake that he's covered in his come. And then he takes a bite, cream catching on his cheeks and his nose as he groans over his mouthful. He's never eaten anything like this before, never been offered as much of a cake as he wants to eat, never eaten one without a cake fork. He wants to smear it across his face and into his hair and really be as dirty and as filthy a piglet as Harry seems to think he is. He takes another mouthful, and another, groaning into it, the icing and the cake going everywhere. Some of it hangs off his cheek. He hasn't even had the equivalent of a full slice yet.
"A hole."
"Well, then," Draco says. His heart's pounding. "I want that so much. A life together."
Draco glances at him again. "So, you’re in this back room."
Draco reaches over and covers Harry’s hand with his own. “You always have to be special, don’t you?”
"Okay," Harry says. There's a pause. Draco takes a sip of tea. It's a light ceylon, too light for him perhaps, but the last of his mother's collection. "Would you ever consider doing it again?"
"Can I ask why?" Draco's eyes are still close, which is probably why he's got the courage to ask. They're not friends, him and Harry, and one day Harry's going to want Draco to do something for him, and then they'll be equal and this will be done.
Draco, bewildered and bemused, climbs awkwardly to his feet.
Harry wraps his arms around Draco's shoulders, and keeps him close.
"I'd like that," Harry says, and when Draco looks down, Harry's vanished the nappy. His wandless magic far outstrips Draco's, but Draco can't find it in himself to be overtly jealous. He'd put that one to bed a long time ago. Harry is spectacular in all manner of ways, not least in his erection, which is magnificent, and pressed against Draco's thigh. "Malfoy, my darling, will you let me take you to bed?"
"All right," Harry says softly. "If you want it left on, you can keep it on. It's your collar, darling. You were so good," he says, stroking Draco's back, in between his shoulder blades. "So good for me."
A while later, Harry passes Draco his pyjamas and rearranges the sheets so that they're in some semblance of order, just like Draco likes.
"No," Draco says, getting down onto his knees. "That's my job. Making you come."
"No one should do this," Harry goes on, "want to humiliate themselves like this. But you do, don't you, Draco? You love the humiliation. You crave it. You crave cock."
"Quite clear," Draco says. "So, you’re in this back room, having sex with a stranger, and you’ve got your keyring in your pocket—"
"No one else ever has," Draco says, and he curls closer into Harry's side, and Harry pulls the blanket up and over them both. The fire crackles. "No one else has ever wanted to."
"But you're happy here?" Harry asks.
With great and genuine thanks for the comments and the kudos. They are much appreciated.
when he spies the snitch, just behind Harry’s head.
"Put me in one of those nappies," Harry says. "I want to know what it feels like. Here. Now. I can't go on not knowing. And I can't not ask anymore."
Draco tries to wriggle to see how much give there is, but there’s barely any.
Draco kisses his hair. "So what if it is?" It's a new approach. "It doesn't matter if it's out of the ordinary. We always were out of the ordinary. Our personal life is just going to reflect that too. Our private, safe, personal life. You looked after and me looked after. Isn't that grounds for a life together?"
"Well? Can I?"
Draco follows Harry out of the kitchen and into a living room that's smaller than Draco's bedroom in the flat. It's still clearly a Muggle room, but it's crowded with pictures of the Weasley branch of the family, if the red hair is anything to go by, as well as pictures that don't move at all, which Draco suspects is the Muggle arm of the family. Harry, who clearly knows where he's going, opens the cupboard in the corner with an
"Filthy piglet," Harry says, coming closer, and this time there's the sound of clothes being adjusted, and a zip being unzipped. "Dirty piglet, with your stupid, useless cock."
. Harry buckles it around his neck, and Draco closes his eyes and lets out a breath for a moment before Harry tilts his chin up with the crook of his finger. He's holding the harness. It's oddly shaped, crossing his chest in an X so that he has to put his arms in it in order for Harry to fasten it closed along the line of his spine. There's a metal hoop there so that Harry can attach a leash to it, which he does.
He nods again. He can feel his skin flush as Harry keeps teasing at his nipples.
"Yes," Harry says, and his smile looks rueful. "I'll try, all right? I'll try."
"With a touch of disdain. Always a touch of disdain."
He reaches over to slide his hand into Harry's hair. Harry groggily opens one eye. "You okay?"
Draco looks at him for a moment before nodding. "Whatever you need."
"Occasionally." There's silence. The wards aren't why she's come. The tea brews. "Thank you for inviting me to dinner. It was a nice surprise."
Draco feels his wards shift before he hears the front door open and Harry arrive out in the hall. "You're early," he calls, without looking up from his desk. He's been working since lunchtime, drawing out layers of charms on parchment. He's been thinking for a while that it must be about time for a tea break.
"Not unexpected," Harry says. "Bet you secretly thought about being caught, didn't you? One of your housemates pulling back the curtains and seeing you like that, humiliating yourself. Did you think about that, Draco? About them finding you?"
"Just now. There's a nursery upstairs. I think it's got a nice view."
"What?"
"I know," Harry soothes him, kissing the back of his neck, the curve of his shoulder. "You're desperate to be filled, aren't you? We'll get you a plug. Keep you filled up for hours."
"Laughing's good," Harry says. "Anyway, pyjamas. If there's one thing I learned from my Aunt Petunia, it's where to get good pyjamas from. How do you fancy a trip to Marks and Spencer?"
Draco whines. Harry keeps stroking his hair, wiping off the lick-sticky jam and cream into Draco’s soft hair. Draco knows his face is a mess, and that there’s still sugar on his nose and around his mouth.
He's a greedy piglet who loves sweet things and being dirty, and he fucking loves Harry, and of all the things that have happened to Draco recently, it's loving Harry that is perhaps the most unbelievable. He'd never imagined the rest of it could happen, not in his wildest dreams. Most of it hadn't even made it into his fantasies. Harry, though, Harry's been stuck in his head since he was eleven, and Harry had never wanted him. He'd never, ever wanted him.
"Please," Harry begs.
As it is, he's got nothing else to do other than sink into the quiet, desperate shame of the moment, to find the space between his breaths, and settle into it. His humiliation, his shame. His nothingness.
Harry steps back, tucking his cock back into his trousers. He reaches down for his broomstick. He’s flushed red and is a little out of breath. He sets off back towards the castle, and Draco’s left to stumble to his feet and practically run after him, gathering up his broom and the snitch case on the way. Harry doesn’t look back at him and Draco’s cocklet is hanging out of his trousers and he really isn’t anything other than a filthy piglet. A dirty, shameful piglet with a useless little stiffy.
"He is well adjusted."
"Everyone's got to have a hobby," Harry says. There's a pause. "We had no idea what we were going to grow up to want, essentially, and when we got there it was two different things. So that was that, basically."
"Wine, I think," Hermione says, after what may or may not have been an awkward pause. "Harry, take the bottle through to the living room, will you? There are glasses in the cupboard in there."
"I don't want to do anything."
"I know what you are," Harry says softly. "I know it all."
"For you," Harry says, coming back into the room. He's got his toothbrush in his hand, and he's changed his t-shirt. Draco didn't realise they were dressing already. "You like coffee, don't you? And chocolate?"
Harry tilts forward and rests his forehead against Draco's shoulder. "My piglet," he says.
Draco gives into it, and sucks Harry off.
Harry leans down after that, and breathes into Draco's ear. "When you get home," he says. "Do what you were supposed to do last night. Wank in front of the mirror. Say it out loud."
"Yes," Draco says. "Are you?"
"Just a hug," Draco confirms. He holds out a hand. Harry waits a moment before bolting across the room and onto the sofa, into Draco's arms. It happens rather quicker than Draco had anticipated, and he covers his surprise by stroking his hand up and down Harry's back as Harry buries his face in Draco's neck.
for him. That the space he takes up in Harry's life is bigger than just what they do together behind locked doors.
Draco comes, right there on the floor in the castle entrance, like a dirty little piglet.
"Come here," Harry says, and he pats his lap, which Draco absolutely does not understand. It takes Harry literally manoeuvring him into position, legs over Harry's lap, before Draco gets where he's supposed to be sitting.
"As many of them as you want," Harry tells him, and he cups his hand, holding it out so that Draco has to press close and bury his face in Harry's cupped palm as he licks the chocolate up. It's melting on his lips and his cheek and he doesn't pull back, not even at the now-familiar tang of his own pre-come, slick across the chocolate from where Harry had held it to his cock and waited for him to leak. He's such a spoiled, over-indulged piglet. "That's right," Harry tells him, as Draco laps at his palm. "Lick that one up and you can have another. And another. As many as you'd like."
Harry gets to the bed first, and settles himself back against the pillows, legs up on the sheets. Draco hadn't quite imagined going that far, he'd sort of pictured them perching on the edge because he wasn't dressed properly for bed. Nevertheless, he climbs onto the bed and next to Harry, who immediately curls into Draco's side, much to Draco's surprise. He hovers for a second before wrapping his arms around Harry.
“I like being in charge of you when everything’s normal.”
Draco resorts to stroking circles into Harry’s back, just to see if he’ll settle. He’s restless, breath still catching, shoulders heaving a little as he tries not to cry into Draco’s skin.
"They're all right to come on," Harry says finally, like he's looking for something to say.
Harry ignores him, flicking through the magazine. "My cock needs warming," he says, without looking up. "Get down and do it."
“We’ll keep it separate from the rest of your life, if that’s what you need. Out here you can be whoever you need to be. Whoever you want to be. Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World.”
"Malfoy," Harry says, after a minute. "Did you fucking come?"
Harry grabs onto his trouser leg, and the snitch takes the opportunity to dart away.
The jar smells a little like citrus. He's breathing it in when Harry slips his slick fingers between Draco's legs and strokes over his hole. He can feel himself flutter in embarrassment at being touched there; at the private place he's inviting Harry to enter. Harry strokes him over and over, never venturing inside, getting him so slick and warm that the ointment slides down his thighs, and Harry presses his mouth to the back of Draco's neck and kisses him over and over as Draco makes tiny, desperate noises at Harry's touch.
"I know you are," Harry says. "Now shout it out. Fucking come-hungry pig."
Harry looks up at that. "Yes," he says. "Because you like cake and I like buying it for you."
Harry wraps him up in a hug and lets Draco carry on touching himself, masturbating in Harry's lap like it's a treat. Draco's breath comes in ragged, torn off hitches, and he doesn't know how long he takes but it's over sooner rather than later, come sliding through his fingers and over Harry's thigh. He's made Harry's clothes a mess.
Harry has somehow moved, kneeling down by his side, his pyjama bottoms gone. He's hard too. He slides his hand into Draco's hair.
Draco glances down, but the glamour's still in place. Thank fuck.
Draco spends most of Friday in Scotland, making final adjustments to the complex castle wards. He's not expecting Harry to join him until the following morning, because Harry's spending his Friday evening having dinner with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.
Then he turns around, still on his knees, so that his back is to the mirror. He bends down, pressing his cheek to the floor, his legs apart. He twists so that he can see himself in the mirror, see what the stranger saw in the back room of the bar. He reaches behind him to spread his cheeks, his little pink hole visible in the mirror.
"They make me come too," Harry says. "And I want this."
. Was that what they were doing? "Dinner with Hermione," he said, all of a sudden. "You told Hermione Granger about us and I accepted her dinner invitation."
Draco's tired, but he stifles a yawn. "You've got it wrong," he says. "I should be the one thanking you."
There's a sort of desperate, aching sadness taking root in Draco's chest.
He's ashamed. He's embarrassed. He's humiliated. He's so humiliated he could sob with it, shame coursing over him. It's just that it's the most excruciatingly perfect thing he's ever felt in his life. He wants to come.
"I'm not a savage," Draco says. There's a beat. "Of course I do."
She cocks an eyebrow. "Does the house sometimes… not welcome them?"
"Such a silly little thing," Harry agrees, licking his fingers so he can go back to plucking at Draco's nipples. It stings a little, and Draco's little cocklet reacts accordingly, slick dripping down its length. "Such a pointless, tiny little thing, isn't it? No use for fucking anyone. It's a good thing that all you want to be is fucked, my love, isn't it?"
"No more escalators," Draco says, as Harry half drags him over the road. "Promise me."
Draco doesn't know what else to do, so he covers Harry's hand with his own.
"Let me suck you," Harry says.
"Your mum loves you."
Draco's mother only approved of cups of tea if they were neatly placed on saucers, on coasters, and on tables. Draco had never looked as comfortable as Harry did right now, curled up on the sofa with his attention fixed firmly on his book. Draco couldn't do anything other than look at him, watching. He might not be able to move a muscle, but it doesn't stop him from drooling around his lolling tongue, and the shame courses through him as he dribbles onto the rug. He longs to come, longs to touch his tiny little cock, longs to masturbate his need onto the floor. All his life he's wanted something, needed something that he's never been able to properly vocalise, even to himself, and Harry keeps finding new ways to bury in deeper and uncover parts of Draco's soul.
Draco deliberately keeps his face neutral. "From clothes shopping maybe. I think there might be a pet shop around the corner, though. Didn't you want to pick up a few bits and pieces?"
"All right," Draco says. "Whatever you need."
"Who said you could wear underwear?"
"You look beautiful in them," Harry says, and Draco flushes even more.
"Don't suck, Piglet. I just want your mouth on me. Want you where you're supposed to be, love. My pet with his mouth on me."
Draco hums. "Depends," he says finally. He runs his fingers up and down Harry’s wet bicep. His arm has a faded grey dark mark on it, not like Harry’s.
"Go on," Harry says.
"I thought you might be," Draco says, and he pours them both a small glass of the red wine. It needs more time to breathe, but it would do. He sits down next to Harry, and Harry bumps his knee into Draco's.
"I don't know how I expected this conversation to go, but this wasn't it."
He'd be hard even if he wasn't immobilised by Harry's spell, such is the humiliation of being so forgettable, of being discarded and ignored, of being nothing.
"I'm so small," Draco says. "I'm sorry."
"You brought wine," Hermione says, in sheer relief. "Thank goodness. Ron?" It's clearly an instruction to open the wine, which Ron does, with Rose still clinging to his leg. "And chocolates and flowers. Thank you, Draco, you shouldn't have."
Obediently, trembling a little, Draco follows him inside. He crawls across the tiny kitchen floor, and into the hall, following Harry into the bathroom. The whole cottage is tiny; it might fit, wholesale, into his bedroom at the castle. The bathroom, small and cramped, barely allows for him to stay on his hands and knees with the door closed, and Harry to stand by the old-fashioned, 1970s bath and shower. Underneath the avocado sink is Draco's bowl,
"You do," Draco says. Pre come blurts out of his slit. "You own me."
"And anyway, it all sort of got swept away with the whole, you know, Voldemort chosen one thing, and fighting evil from the age of eleven. All sort of overshadowed the bits that came before. And during, you know."
Draco knows what that means by now. He sends his own message back, an elegantly scrawled
There isn't much to Harry's fantasy that isn't just him being looked after, and Draco considers for a moment the realisation that for Harry, being looked after by someone else is a fantasy he considers impossible.
Harry smiles. "I know," he says. "Anyway, I was testing some stuff out. Ways to see if someone was out of sight or in sight, you know? And I made this." He pokes at the keyring. "Tells me if you’re near."
Draco takes a minute or so to get to his feet. He still feels a little fuzzy, like he’s just woken up from a very long nap. Harry closes his copy of
"Why would I?" Harry says. "You're just holes."
"I'm sorry," Draco says, but Harry just shakes his head.
"Well," Harry says. "Aren't you going to clean it up?"
He comes in helpless spurts in Harry's mouth, embarrassed that he didn't give any prior warning and couldn't hold out any longer.
"Please," Draco begs, and his head feels like it might explode. "Do it. Please do it."
Draco nods. "Yes, please."
Ginny Weasley's house is still in a state of disarray, but Draco suspects that's only partly down to the fact she's only just felt secure enough with the in-progress wards to move in. She seems to live in a state of perpetual, happy chaos, the kitchen table already full of Quidditch magazines and bags and bits and pieces and half written lists. There are pictures all around, Draco Malfoy standing in the middle of an army of Weasleys. He leaves his workbag in the hallway, and goes into the kitchen to see if Ginny needs any help with the tea.
"Unfortunate thing to smell of," Draco says. "Was it as bad as you're making it sound? Living with them?"
"You were breathing very loudly," Harry says, and when Draco raises an eyebrow, Harry rolls his eyes. "Okay, you set off my intruder wards."
"I heard your mother moved away."
Draco must sound at least a little sharp, because Harry closes the book he's flicking through, and neatens up Draco's bookmark.
And Draco takes it. He takes Harry's cock and he knows his place, what he's here to do, and he loves it. He loves every bit of it. He sucks Harry off until Harry is breathless and panting and rocking his dick up into Draco's mouth, and Draco takes him in deeper, letting Harry fuck his mouth because he's
He picks out a dark green pair with black piping. "These are nice."
, not really, not that Draco's had any intention of starting to articulate any of the stuff inside his head, and he's fairly sure Harry hasn't either - and now's not the time to start. He cleans up the little wet spots under the table, focusing on making the tile sparkle, until Harry clears his throat.
"Are you going to come, love? I want you to come."
He kisses Draco's messy cheek, wrapping one arm around Draco's chest. "Let me fuck your thighs," he says, and it's the only thing that he's said that isn't a demand. It's a question by any other wording, a careful request because Harry only ever seems to go as far as Draco has allowed him, and never past his limits.
"Just a hole," he says out loud. "I'm just a hole." His whole body is flushed pink, and this time when he does the same thing he did last night - down on his knees with his cheek pressed to the floor, hands spreading his arse cheeks apart, he stares at his hole until his dick's so hard he could come right there and then.
"Good," Harry says. "They're all for you."
Draco nods, his cheek scratching against the tile.
"You're not going to set the new wards up, then?" Ron calls after him.
“All right,” Draco says, because it’s obvious that Harry does want it. That he longs for it. That he’s never going to ask for it. He strokes Harry’s hair. Harry shivers underneath his touch. “I like looking after you so much,” he says, after a while. He’s still stroking. “I like making your bed and warming your cock and looking after your clothes and making you come. I like making you feel good. I like that. I want it.”
Harry's smile makes his face look a little younger, a little less worried. "I'm glad. I've been thinking about it for so long."
"She's come over all shy again," Hermione Granger says, coming into the kitchen with a little boy on her hip. He's dressed in little sleep clothes with owls on them, and his dark hair is sticking up in defiant curls on top of his head. He's rubbing his eyes. "Hello Harry. Draco." She leans in and kisses first Draco's cheek, then Harry's. Draco knows he's going red and doesn't know how to stop it. "Harry, will you take Hugo for a bit? He might fall asleep on you, which would be the best possible thing if I'm honest. He's decided he's allergic to sleep, which automatically means the rest of us have to be too." She bundles Hugo into Harry's waiting arms, and Draco is horrified at having to watch Harry make faces at this small, sleepy child, and down at Rose, who giggles and hides her face again. It makes strange things happen in his chest. He has absolutely no idea how to deal with any of those feelings, so he busies himself by looking the other way, which unfortunately means meeting Ronald Weasley's assessing gaze. Hermione slides a hand into Rose's hair, and Rose sneaks a look up at her mum, but doesn't detach herself from Ron's leg.
Draco looks down at his knees. "You're important to me too," he says. His voice catches. "You're very important. And it's not just because you… you see bits of me that no one else ever has."
"HIs dick's not up to much," his mate says, but he's already reaching for his fly. "Eh, whatever. One mouth's as good as another."
"Yes," Draco says, because he doesn't know what he's supposed to say.
"All you're getting."
"Of course," Draco says. "Of course this is what you're doing."
Harry smiles at him. It looks tired at the edges. "Yes," he says. "I'm Harry Potter."
"God knows," Harry says. "Tea, maybe."
"Yes," Draco says. "I know we don't leave your past behind. I know it. I know you carry it with you, and I know Harry does too, and I do as well. I know you're here because you love Harry. But you need to trust him."
"I'll take you out," Harry says. "Parade you around the seediest back rooms if you'd like. Find the people who couldn't give a shit who's on their knees for them, get them to come on your face. Wank two of them off as one of them fucks your mouth. None of them paying attention to you. They don't care who you are, and you don't want them to, right? You want them to think that you're nothing, that you're worthless. Just something for them to come on. Or come in. Holes, right? Just fucking holes. Say it."
It’s a collar, and not the one that they’d picked out together at random from the Magical Menagerie. This one is dark, bottle green leather, lined with wine-red velvet. There are two tags. One says
"You might not want to."
"Will it?"
"I’m not—" Draco stops. "It’s not like this all the time. It’s not all me wanting to come. It’s just normal and boring. I make client appointments. I eat toast. I plan out how to fix wards that incompetent people have threatened their homes with. I uncharm charmed objects. I’m bad tempered and I’m so fucking lonely and I’m terrified of that being too much for you. I’m so alone, Harry, and I’ve been alone for years, and if I let that out for even a second it’ll be like a fucking avalanche, and you won’t want to stay for that. Who would?"
"Always got to offer my best," Draco says. He cleans the nib of his quill and settles it by the inkwell, ready for tomorrow.
"I didn't intend to," Harry goes on, kissing his way down Draco's sternum with a detour to each nipple. "I tried to say you were just important to me, but I couldn't stomach the lie. So I just said it."
Harry looks almost embarrassed. "Yes," he says. He closes the door behind him and the complex lock mechanisms start to slide into place. "I just didn't want to sit at home by myself tonight. Thought I might come and sit at yours, with you, instead."
Harry sounds nervous and a little unsure.
"It's funny, that," Harry says. "Because I want you to kiss me until
"Let's get you home," Harry says, like he's not the one who's just been fucked.
Draco moans. He can't help it.
Harry ignores him, just carries on masturbating, and it's another couple of minutes before he hears Harry cry out, and start to come. He can't feel it hit his coat, not like he can feel it against his skin, and the fact that he's been used and can't feel it, the fact that he's been treated like a thing and he can't even be aware of it, it's a feeling he can't even understand. He can't articulate how it feels to finally, finally get what he's needed for so long. That even if he knew how to ask for it, he wouldn't have been able to.
Draco's heart speeds up. "You fuck boys in back rooms."
"A piglet," Draco says. "Your piglet."
He waits.
"Me and you," Harry says. His hand is still stroking over Draco's back, up and down over the bumps in his spine.
Draco burns red but he nods anyway; the embarrassment makes his cocklet twitch.
"I don't know how you can say it's all right," Harry says, but he lets Draco curl his fingers into his anyway, which might be half the battle. Draco's spent enough time this week thinking about how Harry seems to think that basic human touch is outside of what he can reasonably ask for. "It's weird as fuck."
Draco goes naked to the door.
"Draco." Harry's clearly worried, which his Draco's fault for getting his words in a knot.
"I bought it a couple of years ago," Harry says. "It belonged to someone at work's grandparents, and at the time I was feeling… a little trapped. I wanted a bolthole to escape from everything and everyone. But then I never really got around to getting it sorted out, and I just kept saying to myself I'd do it next summer, but so far it's been two summers and I haven't really done much else than come down a couple of times and then go home again." He slides an arm around Draco's waist. "Turns out I didn't so much want to be alone as just have somewhere to go that wasn't work and home."
Harry shrugs. "If you fuck it up too much, there's another cake."
"Have you told anybody?"
"All the better for getting to the end of it. Hermione, honestly, what on earth are you doing here?"
"Never said otherwise," Harry says. "You already know I think you're brilliant. I just never really thought about the practicalities of what you do." He's still looking at the plans, so he doesn't see the way Draco can't help but react.
"Right," Harry says. "Is, uh, turning Ron blue always on your to-do list, or was today just a special occasion?"
"I think it's worth trying," Harry says. His smile is a little uncertain. "Is that what's going to happen today? You're going to look after me?"
"That's all I want," Harry goes on. "Something I can mess up and not worry about having to clean up afterwards."
"Maybe," Harry says. "But you can't catch the snitch if you don't bother getting on the broom."
"Bet you just go home and wank, don't you? Think about how you looked here, how you appeared. How humiliating it was."
"Being nothing more than a hole," Draco says, and he wants to come, he wants to come so badly, but he doesn't dare touch himself.
After that, when he'd licked Harry's hand clean of cream and pastry, Harry had made him clean up his mess on the floor by hand, no spell work allowed, and hadn't allowed him to wipe his face. He'd called Draco filthy, and dirty, and then he'd flicked through a book at the same time as wanking himself off and coming on Draco's face, and then he'd sent Draco home with instructions for how to contact him today.
“I want that,” Harry says softly. “I want what you’re offering.”
"That's because you don't know what you're looking for, or how to purchase things that actually fit you. Or get them altered."
Harry obediently -- and nervously -- runs his finger down the back of the little orange dragon, and is startled when the dragon starts to purr, arching into his touch. He looks up at Draco with wide eyes. "They do purr."
He blushes, unable to help himself. He still can't quite believe that Harry thinks of him outside of what they do together; that when he's alone, Harry Potter thinks about him, and plans for him, and
“It’s weird, what I want,” Harry says.
"Yes," Draco says, and he's close now, close to just coming all over the tiles in a North London muggle pub.
“Draco.”
and comes back out with four stemless wine goblets.
"You could," Draco agrees. "But it isn't, is it?"
"Open up, Piglet," Harry says, offering him another piece, and Draco - fearing that he'll stop - does.
Draco presses his forehead to the tile and breathes. He sometimes wonders if there's an end to what he imagines, a line beyond which he doesn't want to cross, but the truth is that they keep going beyond what he's thought up, Harry throwing him scenes that he just wants to gather up and add to his collection.
"Fuck me covered in cake," Draco says, the corner of his mouth curving up. It's a strange angle to look up at Harry from, cheek pressed to the floor, down on his knees, but he likes it. It makes him feel settled down in his stomach. Grounded.
Harry looks at the little jut Draco's dick is making. "Cautiously positive, huh? How about if you had your own bowl?"
Draco does like this. He likes it far, far more than he’d anticipated, given that it’s only ever been the stupid, overblown fantasy he’s masturbated to time and time again. Harry’s striking the right balance between keeping it fantasy, and making it real.
Harry follows him a little shyly, a little uncertain, a step behind Draco as Draco leads him down the quiet, carpeted corridors and up a staircase to another long gallery of paintings and doorways. Even Draco, growing up in the manor with its endless rooms, finds the sheer endless nature of the castle a little daunting. So much of is closed up, what leftover furniture remains covered in dust sheets and endlessly waiting for another life. He stops, half way down the long gallery, between a portrait of a laird in full highland dress and a huge coat of arms over a fireplace. There's a doorway here, but Harry's eyes glance past it at first, looking up at Draco in confusion.
Draco remembers. His cocklet leaks. His face burns with the shame of how much he'd wanted it, how much of a mess it had been, what he'd looked like in the mirrors Harry had conjured so he could see the extent of his humiliation.
"Sorry," Draco says, dropping his hand to his side. "Sorry, sir."
Draco's little cock perks up. In his llama pyjamas it's an odd sight, the little jut of his tiny cock.
Harry doesn't look away. His gaze searches Draco's. "You'll be able to move your eyes," he says finally. "Blink three times in a row and the spell will break."
Draco stops touching his cake-covered little cocklet. "Can I?" he asks. "Can I fuck the cake?"
Draco considers that for a moment, and then puts his empty cake plate and his cup and saucer back down on the coffee table. "Do you think I could kiss you?" he asks, all in a rush, cheeks pink. It's not the time to consider how similar it sounds to Potter's
"Out you go," Harry says, patting his bottom, like he really was nothing but his pet. "Animals piss up against trees, don't they?"
And Harry takes Draco's little cocklet in his finger and thumb, and touches him.
Scotland is grey and cold and familiar in the way the chill settles down into Draco’s bones right from the moment his portkey lands them in the castle grounds.
"How long have you been awake? You're all dressed and everything." His gaze sweeps Draco up and down, and then settles on Draco's collar. "And everything," he says, reaching out to touch it with his fingertips.
"The Carpenters," Harry says. "When we went to stay with Hermione's family after... after everything, her dad used to put this on when we had dinner. They were still struggling with their memories but everyone was trying so hard. At the time I thought I wouldn't want to remember it, but I do. And I saw this record a while ago, and it just reminded me of that holiday. So I bought it."
Harry looks at him. "Take me to bed," he says, after a moment. "Just take me to bed."
"No," Harry says. "They left me with a squib called Mrs Figg if they were taking Dudley out for a treat. I didn't know she was a squib until later. She just had a lot of cats and smelled like cabbage."
"Boyfriend," he says slowly. "Boyfriends."
Draco makes a soft, strangled noise in the back of his throat.
"Get a move on, Piglet," Harry says, without turning around. He's making himself tea and a piece of toast. A perfectly normal breakfast, but then he's not a greedy piglet, not like Draco.
Draco wishes
"Rose and Hugo," Harry says. "They're lovely."
"Yes," Draco says, and only partly because he'd spent 45 minutes naked and on his knees before he'd realised Harry wasn't coming, and he was still feeling the cold from where he'd failed to cast a warming charm on the tiles. "And a biscuit, if you've got any."
"Swift as they go, now," he says, and she hoots in disdain at him, but then she's gone, sweeping up into the early evening sky.
“Good,” Harry says, and he downs the rest of his tea before standing up and picking up the plate of cakes. “We can eat these in bed.”
"You want strangers to come in your mouth, and on your face. You want them to use you. I'll get you a queue. Tell them to ignore you, if you want."
"Come?" Harry makes a face. "Probably," he says. "If only because you'd humiliate yourself, coming all over a cake. And because I'd probably make you eat it afterwards."
"You'd be so lovely to look at, my piglet covered in my come." Harry curls his fingers around Draco's little cocklet. He kisses Draco's temple. "There's nothing stopping you, you know, from having some of what you want."
"Indeed," Harry says, with all the cautious emphasis of someone who's never been measured for anything in his life. Except--
"That's right," the man says. "Nothing more than a couple of useless holes, that's what you are. Now shut up and let me forget who's wanking me off."
"Going to make you crawl," Harry says. "Make you eat from a bowl on the floor like an animal. I can't believe you want that. You should feel ashamed."
Draco, happily obedient, gets to his feet and goes to join Harry on the rug by the window. "I don't know what to do."
"I'm not breaking up with you. I'm trying to talk about us finding a way you can feel safe getting what you need, unlike now. We're only talking about this now because I thought we were at a point in our relationship where we could, and it would be honest and might move us forward."
"My name?"
Then the guy's unzipping his trousers and shoving his cock into Draco's mouth, and Draco's taking it. He's taking it even though it's making his eyes water and his jaw ache. The guy's big. He's bigger than Harry, although Draco hasn't spent enough time sucking Harry off. He's fucking Draco's mouth and he's not even paying attention to him, he's calling his friend over and talking to Harry over the top of his head. Then Harry's taking Draco's hand and lifting it up, and then he's wrapping his hand around someone else's dick. Two dicks at once. The angle's weird and Draco's never been amazing at multi tasking but it doesn't matter. So the fuck what if he's not great at rhythm. He's not here to excel. He's here to be used, to be a hole. He's a hole. A rag for strangers to come on, and Harry promised him a queue.
"The nightmares are just an added extra?"
"Did you have a nice time?" Harry goes on, and he slides an arm around Draco's waist then, resting against the waistband of his trousers.
Draco obeys, even though he's missing the weight of the collar around his neck and the feel of his harness against his skin. Markers of being owned, of being nothing more than an animal. Of being Harry's pet. He gets into the bath and gets down onto his hands and knees again as Harry tests that the water's warm enough. And then he lets Harry sluice him down, the shower water soaking his hair, and his back, and his legs. Harry soaps him up, water going everywhere, washing his hair with a shampoo that Draco hasn't approved and probably wouldn't, but right now it doesn't matter. He's an animal, Harry's animal, and it's more important that Harry wash him everywhere, including between his legs and down his thighs and around his little, stiff cock. It seems less important that Harry make him come again, and Harry must get the message, because he does nothing more than clean him off, making sure the soap's gone from his hair and his skin before he turns the water off.
"Potter, if you buy that, you and me are breaking up." There's a solid fracturing of time and space around Draco as he realises he can't steal the words back from the ether.
"Just a little bit," Harry says. "Go and sit down for a minute."
"Your dirty little come rag," Draco says, and tries not to think about coming. For all the times they've done this now, it surely shouldn't still be making him this hard, and this turned on, and this needy. But it does. He likes the way this feels. He likes the anticipation and the waiting and the position and the desperate, shaming embarrassment of displaying how much he loves to feel this humiliated.
He's going to come. He's going to come and Draco's going to make him, even when he's muddy and dirty and harnessed up like an animal. Even when he's nothing more than Harry Potter's pet piglet. He's going to make Harry come.
Harry lets him have as much cake as he'd like. Harry gives him permission.
"Fills it," Draco says, and snaps his fingers. A stool appears in the middle of the floor, somewhere for Harry to stand whilst Draco measures him for his clothes. "Your wardrobe is sadly lacking in some areas."
Draco's heart pounds, but he keeps on doing just what he's being told. He's never-- virginity is still sacred. His marriage was supposed to be sold to the highest bidder. He's not the only person who thinks he's worthless, as it turns out.
Harry rolls up onto his elbow. "Are you insane?"
"It's black forest gateau," Draco says, rather to cover up the desperate realisation that his feelings for Harry go somewhat beyond a business relationship of a sexual nature.
Harry shoots him a glance. "I've never said that… I mean, what I wanted. I've never said it out loud in my life."
Draco laughs. "A thousand," he says, and just for a moment, it feels like forever.
"You can pay me to do that if you'd like," Draco says. "No skin off my nose."
Draco stares down at the card.
Draco’s cock jumps. He’s leaking. A stupid, dumb animal. He’s dying with want.
"A special bonus," Harry agrees. "Saved the world etc etc, lost everyone."
Harry lets out a breath and squares his shoulders. "So," he says. "What does a valet do when his master's wardrobe's empty?"
"Go on, then," Harry says, gaze fixed on Draco. His eyes are bright. Draco loves him.
Afterwards, when the guys have gone and he's wiping come off his chin and he's got it down his shirt and his dick's fucking hard as a rock, the guy who was getting a blow job when Draco first came in wanders over.
Draco squeezes his thighs around Harry's cock. "I'm all dirty."
Harry's hand is hot in his. "I just do," he says. "I just do, all right? I want to give you what you want and I also want to find out what you need, and I think this is a part of that? I think it is, anyway. I think you want it."
"Just holes," Draco echoes, a trifle dazedly. "Please.
"Get on your back," Harry says. "Hook your arms under your knees. Show me both your holes at once."
"Roast salmon. It's a Jamie Oliver recipe, one that Hermione found. If she can make it without fucking it up, then I can too.
Somehow, doing this with his clothes on is even worse than naked, and Draco burns with it. As he listens to Harry masturbate behind him, taking his time, waiting to use Draco to come on and not even acknowledge him, Draco gets harder and harder, and more and more desperate.
“All right.” Draco holds his hands up. “We won’t talk about Dumbledore. Not now. I just…” He stops. Looks down. “I want so much to give this to you but I don’t know how to, not in a way you’ll accept.”
He's so, so hard. He'll never be able to... to
"Yes," Draco says, because his hand is still in Harry's and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere soon. "All right."
Draco shivers, and Harry grins. "I've got just the thing."
Draco burns red. "Potter--"
Draco doesn't bother pulling his trousers up, and apparates home in just the state he's in.
There's one that's a red tartan on the outside, and white fleecy fur on the inside. Harry runs his hand over the fleece. "Maybe Piglet needs to learn his place," he says, and adds the tartan pet bed to Draco's pile.
And then it's morning, and he's slept in, and when he wakes up, it's to find Harry sitting up in bed sipping at a cup of tea.
“We weren’t talking about that.”
"Philistine," Draco says, and attempts to keep the affection out of his voice. It turns out he's not marvellous at it, particularly whilst distracted with tea and cake. He doesn't look at Harry, just cuts him a slice and pours him some tea. Then he does the same, and sits back on the sofa so that their knees are almost touching. The cake is rich with chocolate layers and cherries and cream, and the scent of it is rich with alcohol.
Harry's smile curves across his whole face. "Am I, now?"
"Love cock," Draco says. Love it when you humiliate me."
"Would you?" Harry tilts his head up.
, and it's so, so filthy. He never knew he could be this dirty, or this full of shame, or this fucking turned on.
It's barely five minutes before he's finished and going downstairs to the kitchen, but Harry's waiting for him, seated at the head of the table.
The walk back through the club is thoroughly revolting, and Draco practically radiates shame whilst Harry keeps his head held high. He holds onto his wrist all the way down the road until he nudges them into an alleyway, his hand still wrapped around Draco's arm.
"I'm a come-hungry slut," Draco calls out, and his voice cracks in the middle of it, pre-come dripping down his cock. "I'm a piglet."
And then he waits.
He takes another bite of cake. "Yes." He picks a piece of strawberry off the top of his tart. It's sweet on his tongue. "You should know. I haven't done this. It's just been-- a few times. I've only been out a few times."
Harry's immediate, quiet orgasm comes as somewhat of a surprise.
In the morning, Draco's been awake for a while before Harry finally starts to wake up, sleepily yawning into Draco's shoulder.
"Christ," Jonathan says.
"I'm being nice," Ron protests. "That's what you said."
"We are in love," Draco says, going pink but letting Harry tug him up and out of his chair anyway.
“How could I forget,” Draco says, “given that it was the first in a series of disappointments for House Slytherin.”
"No," Harry says, and Draco doesn’t know whether to be hurt by that or not, but then Harry speaks again. "I think when I was with Ginny, we were both desperately trying to put everything behind us and create something normal when everything around us had been something other than normal for so long. And if we could have managed it, maybe that would have worked, but I don’t think the world’s like that. We’re not here to fix each other. I couldn’t fix Ginny and she sure as fuck couldn’t fix me. I just tried to make her happy so that I’d be happy and it never worked. But I come here and I see you and you’re not trying to Spellotape me back together. I think you were just trying to find a way to be happy. Or give yourself what you needed. I just think, I don’t know, it worked because underneath it we wanted to make each other happy. For some degree of happy that’s about orgasms. I wanted to give you something that you wanted and that made you happy and I got something out of that too. I don’t think that’s a bad basis to build something on."
Harry looks at him. "You saw them. I don't exactly look after them. Not like you do."
Draco doesn’t think twice about it, leaning in so he can cup the back of Harry’s head in his hand and pull him closer in for a kiss. The brooms shiver in the breeze, but Harry just kisses him back, one hand curving around Draco’s waist to hold him near. He kisses Harry hungrily, like they’re not fifty feet up in the air, like there isn’t years and years of history between them. Like Draco wants to kiss him, and Harry wants to kiss him back. He tastes the Scottish chill on Harry’s lips, the excitement and the anticipation and the adrenaline of flying together, and he wants more. He chases the taste, chases Harry for another fucking kiss, but then he’s hit on the elbow by the snitch.
A steady stream of people then traipse past them, marching up the escalator, and Draco is even more confused. He's also still standing on the step below Harry, and Harry's still got his arm around Draco's shoulders.
"That's right. Just a rag for my come, aren't you? Useless for anything else."
It's like Draco's not even there. They're talking about him, not to him. He wants to cup his dick and make himself come.
“There you are,” Draco says softly, wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulders. “There you are, my love.”
That first time, he gets smacked around the face with a stranger's cock, and it's not what he imagined and it makes him feel like he's two inches tall. He's so hard he's fucking leaking with it, and the man laughs at him for it, laughs at him for the humiliation that Draco's been craving his whole entire adult life and never properly understood.
"I think you've got a hole I can fill," Harry says, and he thumbs at Draco's chin, at his bottom lip, so that his mouth falls open. He's got his dick in his hand, chubbed up and hard. He keeps thumbing at Draco's lip. "Drop the glamour, Malfoy."
He settles on the sofa whilst Harry puts the kettle on to boil in the kitchen, drinking a glass of water that Harry's got him to be going along with. He watches as Harry gets a fire lit, and puts the radio on. It's the Witches' Hour programme on the radio, and it's a gardening slot. Draco's never really gardened. There were some very nice flowerbeds and greenery at the manor growing up, but they were overseen by his mother and managed by someone else. One of the gardeners. There's something that sounds very nice about looking after plants. Maybe he'll buy some when he's back in London, back at the flat. It sounds calming. Peaceful.
"It's nice," Harry says. "You're nice."
Draco opens his eyes. There's a second mirror now, and the two of them are kneeling between both mirrors. He can see Harry hugging him, and Draco wrapped around Harry with his face mostly hidden.
"He doesn't open up easily. He barely does with Ron and I, and we've known him forever. You can't know everything."
Harry goes an even deeper shade of red, and Draco doesn't push him beyond saying, "is there something you need, my love?"
Draco hasn't got it in him to try and understand it all right now, so he doesn't. He closes his eyes, and for a few minutes he just gets himself back, all the pieces of him consolidating into something whole.
Draco doesn't know how to answer that. He wants to be looked after, he wants to be given the chance to be blessedly, happily obedient. He wants to be loved, to be petted, to be be humiliated by wanting to be treated like something less than human. "I just want it."
"I can't promise anything," Harry says, "but I'll hold your hand if we have to do anything scary."
Draco goes for it, one hand around Harry’s cock and the other on his balls. Harry’s going to make a mess of him, just like he deserves, and he wants it. He wants it so badly. Harry’s not that far off coming, and Draco’s on his knees in the middle of a Quidditch pitch, he could come right now just from the shame of it.
"Do you think people would laugh at you?"
Draco has been obsessed with being the centre of Harry's attention since he was eleven years old. It didn't stop with adulthood, or with them not seeing each other in years. It just got hidden somewhere, underneath, out of sight.
"I'm sorry," Draco says, and means it.
Harry glances at him. When he sees how pink Draco probably is -- certainly, if he's anywhere near as pink as he feels, he's probably nearing the colour of a blanched tomato -- his mouth curves up into a smile. "I like complimenting you," he says. He relents a little when Draco feels himself growing even more flushed. "What's this for, anyway? All these plans for wards and protections."
"It's not that," Harry says. "I don't know if I know. Or if I do, how to tell you."
"If you'd like," Harry says.
"We’re all broken."
"I like serving dishes," Draco says mildly.
Harry just smiles. "To get out of these clothes, maybe. And before you suggest it, into some other ones. And then maybe food."
"I could do it," Harry says, which is quite clearly a lie, "but it's starting to rain."
Draco's mouth waters. "I gave most of them away. Bought my friends, even then."
Harry just nods, and turns his attention back to the room, waving a hand towards the empty wardrobes. "I thought there'd be more clothes."
Draco shudders beneath Harry's mouth, hands in Harry's hair, hips pressed up to meet Harry's mouth. He cries out into the soft lamp-light of his McGonagall-themed bedroom, and Harry just sucks him harder.
"She’s a forthright kind of a person," Harry says. "Voldemort tried to kill her once. He succeeded at killing her brother. She thinks life’s too short."
"I love you," Harry says, finally, and Draco squeezes Harry's hand and blinks his tears away.
"No," Harry says. "I woke up on Christmas morning at Hogwarts, my first year, and Ron's mum had knitted me a jumper. Hagrid made me a flute. And it was the first time in my life anyone had, um, I don't know. Cared enough to give me anything."
Draco crawls closer, in between Harry’s legs, and leans in so he can take Harry’s cock in his mouth. It’s a solid weight against his tongue, not quite bumping against the back of his throat, but getting there. He tilts his jaw up a little, trying not to groan. This is where he wants to be, on his knees, a hole, providing a service.
"It's me trying," Harry says. "I'd like it if it was you too."
Harry's late.
"We've all spent too long dwelling on the past. Maybe it's time to put it behind us."
Draco had dressed for the occasion, in a shirt and waistcoat and trousers. His shoes shine. He's done his hair. Harry settles himself on the bed, and Draco bends over to get Harry's book from the floor, pages crumpled to keep his place.
"You'd beg for it," Harry goes on, hand moving furiously. "You'd beg me for anything so long as you got cock out of it."
Harry's mouth curves up at the edges. "Good," he says. "Good, that's how it should be." And then he starts to undress Draco, taking off his jumper and his belt and kneeling down to take off his slippers and his socks. It's always really been Draco undressing Harry, and he's unused to this kind of attention; maybe he always will be. In his head it's always him looking after Harry, it's always him on his knees. This time it's Harry undressing him, standing up to help him off with his trousers and his shirt, until he's just in his long underwear, and Harry's still dressed.
He stares at it for a long time before he reaches for his coat.
"A come rag."
Harry bumps his toe into Draco's shoulder. "Up on your hands and knees, I need something to come on and your face seems like an easy option."
"I missed you," Harry says, crawling over him and pressing a kiss to Draco's sleepy mouth. "My love."
"Something like that," Harry says. "I was contemplating making some tea."
"No," Harry says again. He summons his bags with a flick of his wand, and they deposit themselves at his feet, in the entrance of Draco's bedroom. "Are you going to show me around then, or what?"
"Um," Draco says, and lets himself be led down the road. He's really lost his edge.
"Malfoy."
"What have you got there?" Draco asks.
"What are you?" Harry asks, hand still on his cock.
"Yes, well, I didn’t know to ask you."
Harry practically rolls off the bed and onto his knees. Draco's precisely dressed and he has to move the mending out of the way so he can stand up and Harry can get to his trousers, pushing them down to Draco's ankles.
He leaves the mess on the floor when he's done, and practically crawls into bed, still dirty and used, but suddenly exhausted.
"That's right, get me hard. Make me come."
He drifts. He's safe. He's used.
"I'm not waiting all day," Harry says, and Draco - on fire with wanting it so much - leans down and laps at his come with his tongue.
"Draco," Harry says. "My filthy boy."
Draco chews it down, bits of chicken and lettuce and bread. The cucumber sticks to the plate and he can't get his teeth around it. He whines in frustration.
"He does. He wanted to."
Draco hopes his uncertainty doesn't show on his face. "I thought you might like to have breakfast in the nursery, little one," he says. "I thought the collar might help remind you that you're still in charge, even when you're letting me look after you like I will be."
Draco rolls his eyes. "Child." His hand is still in Harry’s. He isn’t entirely sure when it was he started feeling this way about Harry. There’s been way too long hating him. It’s all sort of rolling into one.
…Maybe Harry will take him. Maybe he'll ask.
"I wanted to give you somewhere safe too," Draco says. "So I built you the nursery. I wanted to give you somewhere you could be yourself, but I've been thinking and I went about it all wrong. I didn't give you freedom like you gave me. I gave you more walls you had to break through to allow yourself to want this. And I don't think you can do it."
, Draco thinks, and he nods.
Draco's heart pounds. "He's a wanker," he says.
"And I'll put a perfectly passable mediocre one on." He pats Draco's arse. "Never was that great at glamours."
"I know," Harry says. "We can do it again whenever you want."
"Of course we are," Hermione says, and if she's glancing between them, Draco doesn't pay her any attention.
"They've done everything they should do, in cases like this, liaising with the authorities and everything. They'll look after him."
"I don’t know why I’d say no," Draco says. He runs his hands up Harry’s sides. "Why would you think I’d say no?"
Harry presses his fingertips into Draco's hips, sliding his trousers down. "It's enough for me," he says.
"You spoil me," Draco says.
"Maybe," Harry hums, climbing into bed with him. Harry indulges these little things about Draco that he can't imagine anyone else doing; slipping under the covers, a moment of modesty in amongst all the immodest things that Draco desperately wants. "We can talk about that later." He rolls Draco onto his side, facing away from Harry, so he can drop kisses along Draco's shoulder and up his neck. His dick bumps up against Draco's bottom. He wraps an arm around Draco from behind and teases gently at Draco's nipples with his fingertips. "My good boy," he says, "so fucking responsive, aren't you?"
He's nothing but an animal, nothing but a piglet, and his mouth's a hole to be filled.
"I want to kiss you again."
"Nothing," Draco says, breath catching. "Make me nothing."
"Not me," Ron says, looking him up and down. "You think I'd pay you to do anything other than walk away forever?"
"Filthy," Draco says. He can't look up, can't meet his eyes in the mirror.
Draco crawls awkwardly in, his head a tumultuous mess of shooting stars and sound. He doesn't know what Harry wants from him. Harry's kneeling on the floor next to it, still fully dressed.
