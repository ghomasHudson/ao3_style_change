“I'm sorry, Harry...” she mumbled, a sleepy, tired Jasmine in her arms. “I'm sorry...”
Focussing on the wonderful, wet tightness that surrounded his cock, Harry swivelled his hips to find a better position to thrust as deeply as he possibly could. He wanted Draco to burn from his massive cock, to be ruined for anyone other than him ever again. He didn’t want to be gentle. He wanted to ram in his length until the other man wailed and screamed...
As Draco took his cock in her mouth; so tightly, sucking so hard and so deeply, Harry thought his mind would just explode. Draco felt so great, the best and most powerful lover of his life.
and his breath tight in his chest. His knot was sandwiched between them, heavy, wide and
Harry could hear himself panting, hear his groaning as he entered Draco over and over. It was an awkward angle, his cock slip-sliding everywhere, his grasp leaving red marks on Draco’s skin.
“We’ll use a portkey, then, darling. I’ll pack all your gorgeous new floaty things, and shrink them down so they’ll be easy to carry. I’ve even been practicing my translation charms, but I’m not all the way there yet...”
Harry steered his wife into the nearest Burger King. It smelt fantastic, and Harry realised how long it actually had been since the two of them had gone out for a date.
"Don't do it too much... I might just sleep and we'll lose the ice-cream with Lyra..."
The only cure, as far as Draco knew, was wanking. He took himself in hand, every opportunity that came his way, and lay back, nestled on his bedsheets. Draco liked to imagine that it was Harry’s big Seeker’s hand that was stroking his cock and not his own. It was only when Draco moved to lay on his side that the wizard noticed something unexpected.
“It’s your orgasm. It gives you an increase in your hormone level”, he murmured. “So it’s all completely natural, baby.” Harry took Draco in his arms, enjoying his languid, post coital buzz.
She hold onto Harry, hiding her face into his chest.
“He can go and fuck himself, I don't care that she has his blood. He'll still look at her as some atrocity. Firstly, because I birthed her and carried her. Secondly because she's a half-blood. Also, she's a Potter. Finally, she's a girl. Not worthy of any Malfoy money. I don't want her near any of it.”
... Knot me, aaah~! Please!"
“Ummmm. Chocolate dessert sounds just about perfect from where I’m sat,” Harry smiled. “But I insist we take it to go. I want to enjoy my dessert with you. You’ve got me feeling very alpha tonight Draco... Maybe it was your polite little request, or maybe it’s that traditional omega dress you’ve decided to wear. What I want,”, he whispered, bringing his lips close to Draco’s ear, “is for you to spread it all over me. Make me sticky and messy, and clean me up with your tongue. It’s one of my biggest fantasies. Shall we take these desserts to go?”
Draco let himself be hold by Harry, warmth all around him. It was perfect, just perfect being there, like if he was meant to be in his arms. It seemed like Draco was made to be there.
Picking Draco up easily, and he teased his husband’s slick cunt, poking and prodding and generally being a giant tease. Lining his cock up ready to take Draco entirely, Harry looked his husband straight in the eye.
Harry was proud of his computer skills. He’d certainly not used a computer at the Dursley’s, and there were no computers at Hogwarts. But Harry liked Muggle inventions, and he’d brought himself a laptop and taught himself to use it. And right now, he was happily researching the various dog breeders locally, and he
“Nothing at the moment, Draco,” Harry smiled, aiming to swipe a bite of his wife’s toast. “I’m so full of love that there’s no room for toast... I’m hurt; you don’t seem to be having any problems. But then I suppose you do have to keep Jim the worm fed.”
“Come here, you dafty! There’s never, ever been a sillier, more beautiful creature than you. I adore you, Draco. You and our baby... But right now, I may well collapse into an absolute heap unless I get some breakfast in me. Shall we go downstairs?”
"They're so pretty! I wish I had a pair just like yours!" she said, and proceeded to look at his whole outfit. Before they could talk more, Ginny came to talk to him, and Draco felt his cheeks burn.
. To take the full bond. I don’t know... What do you think about alphas and omegas who do that? Do you think it’s a ridiculous commitment?”
him to, and it felt wonderful. Cuddling up close to the smaller man, Harry was soon fast asleep, far too exhausted to worry about anyone’s parents or anything but the sleeping man in his arms.
"I'm sorry that this has happened to you, Mr Ollivander... But I don't understand why you had to call me, sir." He replied, trying to keep his tone low and calm, as expected from an omega. Ollivander was a nice man, but still very traditional.
She was so petite, and Harry felt his heart grow two sizes when he realised that everything she’d known; being warm and snug inside Draco had been
He didn't know he'd like a little pain with his pleasure, but now that he was feeling it, every little dot of it made him closer and closer to his climax. It wasn't a big source of pain, no. It was like pinching his nipples hard, a slap on his arse, biting his bottom lip. But it was constant, and as he thought of how bizarre it was, the pleasure exploded.
She touched her bump, smiling sleepily. She couldn't wait to meet her so awaited baby. Hers and Harry's. Her smile got wider as she felt happiness take over her.
He laughed, climbing into the bath behind his husband. Hooking his arm around Draco’s middle, he pulled the slighter man onto his lap. Harry couldn’t help burying his face into Draco’s neck, inhaling the musky scent, and enjoying his soft flawless skin.
She was screaming by the time she ended, tears falling freely down her cheeks, her whole body trembling.
Pushing his back on his silky green sheets, Harry had his hot red mouth all over Draco’s cock in an instant. His lips were everywhere, sucking, kissing, licking. He held Draco still, refusing him any room to wiggle... Harry wanted him coming in record time.
Draco wanted to give Lyra a good impression of him  even if she never would know that he was indeed Harry's boyfriend. He dressed in a white jumper, neckless, so Harry could see his unmarked neck all the time. He put on some tight, light blue jeans, and low heels. He didn't want to show off as much that day. The high heels were for work.
"Tomorrow, I'll have to leave earlier. Alone. I have to go to the bank and... Fix some stuff. And I have to do it alone. Do you mind?"
“I like you like this. So soft. Don’t be sensitive about your body... I could see you looked uncomfortable walking in... But you’re gorgeous, perfec.t”
He angled himself against Draco’s entrance, thinking her body as beautiful and wanton as ever; childbirth having enhanced her womanly physique, and in one hard thrust, made his entry into her most precious place.
Draco knew that, what once was just physical attraction was becoming way more than this to him. He really did love Harry, and he couldn't control it. That was why he was sending Pansy those checks. He used to do that in the past, and he knew the money he sent to that account, in her name, was making more money, but he stopped doing this for about two years because... Well, he'd never marry, why was he worrying about his money?
“Look at you Draco. So fucking hot for me, desperate for my prick”. Draco’s dirty language was such a turn on for Harry; to see him losing his mind, and his well-spoken, crisp voice beneath him was breath-taking.
Secretly, though, Harry thought it all sounded like quite an adventure. He knew there was a wizarding school in Brazil.
He pulled Draco to him. They’d had a wonderful, loving honeymoon and it had only made Harry adore Draco more than ever. He didn’t care about small-minded muggles pulling disapproving faces. He cared about the man he loved. He pulled Draco’s lips to his, enjoying their softness and warmth, the taste of pastries still there from lunch. Harry ran fingers through Draco’s hair.
Draco sighed happily with Harry's tender touch on his mark, his body pliant and submissive to Harry's touches. It was so... So good! Draco would never get tired of this feeling.
The last time they did it, it was the third finger who made Draco cry and suffer in pain. It didn't happen this time, maybe because they played a little with their fingers as they showered, waiting for this moment. Now, Draco knew he was ready for a forth finger, maybe something bigger. He opened his eyes, swallowing water pooled around his tongue, and looked into Harry's eyes.
Taking in the city was a revelation for him; Harry was sure he had never seen anything quite as grand in his life. The ancient buildings and churches radiated old magic and he immediately felt this week would be one of the most important of his life.
He breathed in deeply. Harry would just look at it like the omega in love he was and ignore it. It was just two letters anyway.
“Move, Harry... I want to feel you...” he whispered on Harry's ear, his legs pulling Harry even deeper.
!” Draco was sure she was paying all her sins as a child.
"I'll have some tea... And I'd love to be quiet," Draco said, and as Harry asked him what he wanted, Draco felt lost. What did he mean? Did he mean now? Or forever? "I want to mate with you, alpha. I want to walk around with your scar on my neck, and I want to bear your babies, and I want you to take care of me forever. That's what I want, alpha."
“So gorgeous, Draco”, Harry whispered. “Going to put my fingers in you now.”
Draco let Harry pamper him all he wanted. He sighed, happily with Harry's touch, and closed his eyes to enjoy everything. So that was what it felt like having an alpha to take care of you? Draco felt lucky to have Harry beside him, then, because he'd trade everything to have this every single day of his life.
“Well, I jolly well hope that they aren’t born amongst the goats,” Harry commented, scraping his spoon around the edge of his bowl, in a vain attempt to finish off every scrap of ice cream.
Harry wand-dried his hair, and checked his appearance in the mirror. He looked as rough and unkempt as he normally did. Darn it, he hadn’t even managed to have time to shave that morning! The Brazilian Quidditch fans would have to have a star seeker that was slightly more stubbly than usual. He didn’t suppose they’d care too much.
That’s why your words cut me deeper than any
consider you. I think about it all the time... But...  I have too much to lose.
Exhaustion overtook him and Harry felt himself drift off to sleep. Before he finally fell asleep, Harry set a tempus charm to awaken him in plenty of time.
, but all Nott did was laugh. “I’ve known the Malfoys all my life Potter... You aren’t going to get rid of me quite as easily as all that.”
“Fuck, Harry, I missed this... I missed you, how I missed everything...”
“Really?” Harry laughed, “You’ve honestly never had one?”
“You’re fucking fantastic... You’ve no idea,” gasped Harry, as he picked up Draco up like the blushing newlywed he no longer was.
Harry sat up, surprised, pleased and scared at Draco’s words. A big tumble of feelings that were hard to comprehend and smashed down some of the walls he’d built up around himself since his break up.
"I'm a friend of Harry's. I was on his Instagram and ended on yours by accident."
! And you’ll be betrothed soon I expect? And you must be...” Pausing, the old man looked at Harry, “Draco’s servant?”
Harry Potter wasn’t a man for
Pansy laughed on the other side, and after a couple of minutes talking, Draco hung up. Grabbing his purse, he walked out his room. He had some checks to sign and send.
Harry seized his husband’s waist with one hand, running his fingers though the other man’s hair. Draco was no match for Harry’s height and strength, and as he moved forward towards the bed, he was able to easily move Draco along with him. Dropping down onto the bed was perfectly easy, and the slightest pull had Draco spread out on top of him.
Draco moved his wand, and the image zoomed in, the seed getting bigger and showing what it was. It was strange shaped, like a big headed worm inside a cell, but Draco knew exactly what it was.
Sure, they got on brilliantly, and still did. But great friends and good co-parents weren’t enough. The spark had never been there, and he could see from her happiness with Blaise that she finally had what she needed.
The healers helped Draco to attach Jasmine's mouth on her nipple, and Draco just couldn't look anywhere else. Jasmine was
Harry didn’t care so much about the sex as he did about showing his wife how gorgeous she still, absolutely was.
"Harry, take care... You'll be the first one to ever touch it besides me... I want to feel good, and I want you to claim me too... So much... Even if it is with your fingers..."
. The first thing was to send Harry a message:
Harry stroked his lover’s lower back, peppering little kisses all over his creamy white shoulder blades.
Harry lavished kisses all over her silky hair - which he thought was even more thick and glossy with the pregnancy - and found her lips. He wanted Draco to know she was utterly loved and wanted.
"It's good to see you, Severus," Draco said as he entered his old family home. The nostalgic sensation ended as his mother arrived at the foyer, absolutely livid, her eyes red from tears.
Draco felt on fire. Everything inside him was burning, burning like never before. It was like something had clicked, like he was free. He never thought that actually saying those things to Harry could make him feel this way. Maybe... Maybe, in the future he would say all the things in his mind. But for now, it was enough to feel all of these amazing feelings.
Harry looked down admiringly at his daughter, who looked back with unfocused green and blue eyes. She was so, so light, and she fitted in the crook of his arm. He looked into her face, and tried to decide who she most looked like.
He turned to Harry, his smile getting bigger from his compliment. Harry had such a delicious scent that day, even stronger. It was a comfort scent. He looked up and down at Harry, and felt his nipples harden with desire. Draco was dating the definition of a
Also, way too damn small for an adult.
"Why do you smell like you are..."
Draco felt incredibly comforted by being between Harry's arms and legs. It was like a safe place, a place where they could be forever.
They were together on bed, Draco snuggling against Harry, feeling comfortable and warm enough to tell him what she wanted to say.
Holding his hand inside for a moment, feeling the give of the muscles, Harry couldn’t help but feel awed by the moment. This was an intimacy only experienced once in a lifetime, and Draco had given it to him. His husband was forever changed as a result.
"I don't give a flipping fuck to the business. I'd never get into it if it meant that my life would be fine. But I'm not an alpha, Harry. And my family is not a nice family."
Silence, for a moment. And then:
Draco sobbed, harder, the image dissipating when he covered his face and started to cry into his hands. It was a baby! He was
Draco felt like he could cry of pleasure. It was just so good, so delicious to have Harry sucking and nipping on his tender flesh, that he felt like he was in paradise. His cunt was so wet it left a dark, damp spot on Harry's jeans.
The option was amazing, though. Harry's hands on his hips were grounding him as the alpha pounded inside him like a beast. Draco was trying not to scream, not to show how amazing it was to be fucked like that, but he just couldn't. He bit his lower lip to stop himself from making sounds.
Hooking his arms around Draco’s back he picked up the smaller man easily. Harry truly wasn’t in the mood to be trifled with.
. But how many remained to be seen.
to get hold of the dog. Magical pet shops were out. They dealt with magical creatures only. He’d have go to the Muggles, but that was no trouble. He decided to go online. There was an Internet cafe a few streets away, and Harry knew he’d find the information - and the dog - he desired.
“I know you're not. Harry, I know I don't say it a lot but I love you so, so much. Sometimes I look at you and I wonder how someone so amazing, so perfect, so understanding, is with me. I don't think I feel like doing... Anything more than cuddling today. I'm... Honestly, I'm still confused, but I'm happy that you're on this with me... And you'll still love me like a girl. Me and Earthworm Jim will be here with you and I'm... Really happy that you're going to be here with me.”
“That was fucking fantasy, Draco, just intoxicating”.
Olivia beamed at Harry's words, looking immediately at Draco to see if the CEO had noticed how Harry had complimented her. Draco did smile in acknowledgement, but his focus was totally on Harry. The way he stood, powerful and bright, the way his eyes looked into Draco's like he owned the place. Draco might be the boss around there, but Harry definitely was
She was so scared of this. It wasn't supposed to go this way, it wasn't supposed to be today. She had planned everything, and it was all going wrong.
"I don't mind. I love kids..." Draco got closer to Harry and smiled, kissing his lips tenderly. He whispered against his mouth, figuring it would be an amazing way to end the night. "But now, I want you to suck on my tits until I come again just from your mouth in me."
He smiled at his omega who was mussed up with sleep and looking superb in the warm light of the morning. Harry couldn’t resist and pulled Draco close to him, meeting his partner’s lips with his own.
, but he couldn't. He was in a top position, he was not only the CEO, but the future owner of this company. And people would shame him for giving up this position to be with someone who loved... Worst of all, to have children and settle.
He made them coffees, too. Rich lattes that from Draco’s percolator that probably cost more than his kitchen. With the thin layer of dust on everything, it didn’t seem like his omega came in here much. Obviously working far too hard.
Draco was a truly beautiful person, inside and out, and Harry thanked Merlin every day that he was lucky enough to share his life with him. This was the life he’d always imagined, complete with beard and dog thrown in for good measure!
He had so much love to give; so much love for his and Draco’s child who might not ever exist. He, who had never known his parents, who had been brought up by people who’d thought him lower than dirt.
. Perhaps life couldn’t get any better.
“Is it mozzarella?” Draco asked behind Harry's back, holding his waist and trying to look at the pizza box, as if he could see through it.
“You’re everything to me, Draco... You and Jasmine. I’ll do anything to protect you both. Tell me what you want from me.”
“Harry...! More! Please, touch me more...!” he pleaded, as he opened his legs slightly, trying to help. He raised his left leg, touching his foot on the opposite wall to prop it up and keep his legs open. He then supported his back on the wall behind him, giving room so Harry could work on him. “I... I want to feel your thick fingers inside me, Harry... Please... Touch me where I've never even touched myself...”
she cared so much about it, but she did. And she felt bad because, looking at her baby, she could see Jasmine was just a regular little girl, and she felt relief.
“Come to bed” Harry whispered. “You’re tired... I’m tired too. All I want to do is hold you, have you next to me, Draco. I’ve missed having you close.”
The Black property was indeed beautiful, secluded from the prying eyes of journalists and filled with all the people that he and Draco loved best in the world. The last few days of separation had been difficult for Harry but he was happy to know that Draco’s traditional values would be satisfied. In the future, their days and nights would be entwined, and their lives and bodies would be shared.
Draco sighed, drinking his last gulp of wine. Their plates were gone already, and Draco felt the night was coming to an end.
Draco felt protected there, between Harry's arms and kissing his mouth. It was, of course, inappropriate to kiss him like that in their work hours, but Draco couldn't do much about it. He needed Harry right now.
Draco screamed, his hands getting white from grabbing the sofa cushion. The delicious stretch pain was there and his mind got blank. It was amazing, and he felt his toes curling from the pleasure. Harry's cock was this thing from heaven, and Draco wanted to have this forever until he passed out from pleasure. He was unable to play with his own nipples, or else he would fall from Harry's powerful thrusts. But he needed that little sharp pleasure that he knew was going to throw him over the edge.
Draco couldn't stop his smile as Lyra went and hugged him like they've known each other forever. His smile was broad as she got apart from him, looking immediately at his sandals.
He smiled, for whatever was happening between Draco and himself, this was only the start.
“Yes, you have mentioned,” Draco moved, turning to be front to front with Harry and hugging him, hiding his face on Harry's muscled chest. “I don't feel really good today, Harry. Can you cuddle me?”
“Well, if Mr. Malfoy here speaks highly of you, then my company and my home is open to you both. I’ve taken the liberty of booking you both into the Presidential Suite of the Adlon Hotel - don’t worry, I insisted on separate rooms, I know you value your reputation highly Draco - I couldn’t have you stay in that
right, his husband had never had many people who really
Draco really needed his alpha.
For real, Draco didn't want to hand Jasmine to Harry. They had been together for so long and now they were two separate people that it felt weird. She knew that Harry was her father and had to take care of her just as much as Draco, but Draco felt so...
“Sorry we’re a touch late,” Harry said, turning a touch red. “We got a little bit held up getting here”.
Harry set to work in Draco, rubbing and stroking a stripe up his skinny back. He wanted his omega to feel like the absolute prince that Harry knew him to be.
alone and childless than have an arranged marry with a dumb, weak and smelly alpha." He looked at Nott, deep into his eyes. "I can smell your fear when you're close to Harry, Theo. That's why you came to my family with your pictures. You're too afraid of going old-fashioned and fight for the right of breeding with me. You know Harry would win in a fight." Draco smiled, cruelly, and he felt happiness as Theo lost his smile.
He smiled as Harry touched his belly again, and held the hem of his tee shirt to show his flat stomach. It was definitely softer, but it was probably because he had been eating so much junk food these days.
Popping them into his mouth, Harry sucked and kissed them all over, tickling his tongue between them and enjoying how smooth and perfect they were. Harry loved every inch of Draco, from the very top of her blond head to the these smooth, round wet toes.
”, she’d laughed. “
He deepened their kiss, Harry slipping his arms around Draco. This small, slight man was his whole moon and stars. He only hoped he could give him everything he deserved. But Harry wasn’t worried.
Harry shook his head. He’d never say a word to Draco; he let her lead, and make their sexual decisions. Otherwise, he’d feel too guilty, like he’d pressurised her.
When Harry walked away, Draco had basically lost all hope. He controlled himself in front of others, but as soon as he entered his room, he started crying and sobbing.
like sex than what they did until now. Until now, they were fumbling, playing... This was when stuff got serious and Draco wanted it so bad.
He kissed Harry back with all his heart, and after they stopped, Harry's words made him flush red.
Draco felt his cheeks burning with Harry's tone of voice and nodded a little too strongly. He didn't think he'd ever supply any of Harry's fantasies, but here they were.
“We need to go grocery shopping, Harry. I really want some celery to munch on. We have nothing here!”
Draco hugged Harry even stronger by his shoulders, moaning when he felt Harry's cock against him, even if he was still wearing his shorts. He was hard, starting to get wet, and his body was on fire.
With Harry's words, Draco felt his cheeks burning. He was sure he turned red, but he couldn't help but get turned on too. It was a little bizarre being turned on by the idea of having Harry's baby, but he was, and he couldn't help it at all. His cunt got wet immediately as he listened to it.
Goodness; he needed to pull himself together. Act like the executive he was supposed to be! He walked into the room, and clocked immediately that only Draco had arrived so far...
Unable to resist, Harry kissed Draco’s forehead both chastely and lightly. His omega’s skin tasted so mild and delicious. “I love this,” Harry confessed. “I wish we could be together all the time.”
Harry felt like he’d never been closer to Draco in his life.
Draco wanted to take tons of this cheese home.
His eyes rolled with pleasure, the sharp pain of Harry's cock pushing his insides all at once almost making him come right then and there. He didn't want that feeling to stop, so he started riding Harry's cock immediately, once again pushing his small breasts to Harry's mouth.
“It's... Stupid, really. Just... I worry that our first night is going to suck. Because... I mean, you have done it before. So I guess you're good at it. I have never... I have never had sex. The first time you touched me more intimately, I made a fool of myself. I worry that I won't be able to give you what you need.”
Draco was smiling, his cheeks hurting from happiness, and as they went to the room, Draco had the mind of asking... Why did they send the tarts to the same room? They had different rooms... And they weren't dating,
He held hard on the sheets with his clean hand, and his vision went white.
“I don't know how I'd like it, Harry,” he admitted, guiding Harry's hand to between his legs. “I've saved it for your touch only. Please... Touch and teach me everything about it...”
The rest of the meal passed by in a blur. Draco was wonderful company, very funny, with a dry sense of humour that made Harry feel quite scandalous with some of his observations. Harry told Draco a little of his history, about his first degree and the MBA that he’d taken at Cambridge after working in the field for a couple of years. “But I prefer working directly with businesses, you know? It’s far more satisfying.”
They arrived there and found a table, and Draco couldn't help but feel nervous.
"I'm sorry, did I say something wrong? You don't need to come if you don't want it. Maybe I was too much into it. You hated the picture, didn't you? I know some alphas don't like male omegas as much. I'm sorry again. If you want we can just forget it, okay?"
Draco hugged Harry tightly, inhaling the scent of love, home and safety that always surrounded him. He'd never thought he'd find his alpha like this, his true mate, but he was happy he did. Harry had changed his life so much in a few months that Draco knew this couldn't just be coincidence. It was fate.
Draco asked him, already stuffing her mouth with toast.
Harry was a mass of sensations. The hot water surrounding him, the snug heat of Draco’s cunt and the breath that didn’t seem to quite fill his chest.
"Shut up, Potter. I know I'm younger than you, but I'm an adult. I know what I'm feeling and you know what you're feeling. My life is on hold since I presented. And seriously, you are a way better option than good old Ollivander, don't you think?" Draco laughed, putting himself up with one arm so he could look at Harry better, touching his face and resting one leg over Harry's, unabashed, careless that he was completely naked. "Would you trust me enough with her? I'd love to meet her. It... It would mean the world to me to see her."
. His cock almost reached his navel when he was over Draco, and he wasn't even lined up properly, so it might be bigger than that. Draco didn't know he'd be such a size queen, but here he was, craving for that piece inside him already.
His other hand was holding onto Harry's leg, giving him support, and he closed his eyes, moaning with the feeling of it. He let his hand fall from Harry's leg and started playing with his own nipple, pleasure taking over his body. Merlin, if this was so good, he couldn't imagine how amazing it would be when he finally gave him completely to Harry.
He was also tired, and missing Harry terribly, but he forced himself to only talk to the alpha as soon as he got into his car. He hated the way Nott looked at him when he was around, as if Draco was becoming soft, and the omega absolutely refused to show any weakness.
, and Draco followed him immediately before stalking his photos.
The message showed it had been received, which led Harry into imaging Draco on his bed. Feeling his cock stir to the image, he thought it might not be too late to have some fun...
without even thinking. The women froze, and Jasmine was freed. Harry was immediately by his daughter’s side, pulling her to the heat of his body and carding his hand through her dark, wiry hair.
Harry looked at his gorgeous, red faced husband and felt like smiling. He didn’t though, not fancying being hexed into the middle of next week.
Draco kissed Harry back, tenderly, his hand going up to his hair, caressing.
“Healer, we will need every bit of evidence that you have in this matter. We need every single person on this floor under strict orders of silence, we will be requiring oaths.” Susan barked for him.
When Harry went to the kitchen, Draco waited looking around his house. It was indeed very much smaller and plainer than the houses Draco has ever lived. But it had... Something. It looked
Draco knew the feeling would probably fade. Maybe it was because it was such a new experience, having Harry touch him like this. Maybe it was because he was half way through his heat, but it was
He lay down next to Draco, pulling their bodies together, their come mixing together, a slick dampness between them, soaking their sheets and filling the air with the scent of musk. He kissed Draco too, soundly and purposefully.
When he felt Harry touch his nipples, his eyes rolled back to his head. It was comforting and at the same time, so pleasurable. He'd love to have Harry touching his chest all day long.
Harry pulled, and licking a second finger, worked his way in, easily. Working his fingers in a circles, Harry felt nearly as worked up as Draco by the rough, passionate heat of their touch. Draco’s arse was perfect, pliable and opening up for him so well.
When Harry received Draco’s text he signed in sheet relief. He was sad that Draco had agreed for them to work apart for the week, but overjoyed that the omega still wanted to be a part of Harry’s life. He quickly texted back.
"The pleasure is mine, Mr. Potter," he said, his voice sounding a little too submissive for his liking before he turned, open the door, closed it behind him and left as fast as he could to his office.
As the water from the shower cascaded over his hair, every part of his body felt like it’d been
Harry pushed down the blankets and set to work on Draco’s breasts. They were perfect; flushed and swollen in his mouth. They were pebbled and wide, and they filled his mouth adorably. He nipped, and bit, and sucked hard, knowing that they’d be sensitive against Draco’s shirts for
Draco just melted into Harry's arms, holding him by his neck and giving everything he had into the kiss. He pulled Harry closer to him, walking back until his back pressed against the counter. He held his moans back, but he couldn't stop his body, pressing himself hard against Harry, trying to find any kind of pleasure.
She was sad. Even though she had made Harry come, she was sad and holding back tears. She stood under the spray of water so he wouldn't see her tears in case they fell.
Draco. Coming to work with a belly full of baby, and
-x-x-
"Don't... forget to put the leftovers on the refrigerator..." he mumbled, sleepily, before completely falling asleep. His emotions were too strong, and he couldn't keep awake anymore.
“Are you insane? This tastes delicious. I could eat it all day and not even get tired. No, it is the opposite of a diet. I guess everybody has their comfort food, right?” Draco shrugged, biting a large piece of his last toast, licking his lips and then finishing it all, licking his fingers.
“Very good question, Draco.” Harry looked at the omega thoughtfully. “It’s difficult to imagine what I’d be doing if I didn’t work for your company. I do have one dream, but it’s hardly likely to ever come to fruition.”
“I try... I really try not to hate on Weasleys. But... It's just
“Doggy home?” Jasmine asked, her hand holding Harry's beard. “Want doggy, dada!”
"Yes?" he answered the phone, and he could hear her sobbing at the other side.
Harry found Draco’s message when he logged onto his computer.
“I want you... I want you to fuck me in the arse. I want you to fuck me raw, to pin me on the mattress and leave me destroyed.”
Draco returned Harry's kiss, closing his eyes and hugging him with all his might. He stopped after a moment, thinking, and then sat on the bed, holding himself in his hands.
The silk felt wonderfully soft next to his broad, muscular sated body. Compared to his physique Draco was so petite and delicate. He shivered in delight at the idea of his hot thick cock nestling against the curves of Draco’s round little arse cheeks tomorrow, and every morning.
Harry felt like he was losing control as he squeezed and bit Draco’s breasts. They tasted so good, sweet and slightly of Draco’s honey body lotion. He knew he was marking Draco, bruising him, but he couldn’t help himself. His husband’s nipples were hard, pebbly on his tongue. His mind swirled and whirled, and he knew he couldn’t last longer.
After his bath, he dressed in comfortable clothes, still feeling a little hot, but manageable, and got his phone, sending a message to Harry:
to be your boyfriend. I've... I've never had one so... Fuck, Harry, I fall in love with you a little deeper everyday," Draco admitted, touching Harry's face. "But maybe only tell this to Lyra, for now? I don't want people at work to find out... My parents would and... They won't be happy."
Of course she was taking care of what she ate, especially because she was still breastfeeding Jasmine, so she couldn't just
His husband was small, but to Harry’s mind, perfect. He felt his own cock growing heavy and thicker in response, and he took a moment to grind it against Draco’s thigh, enjoying the tingle the friction spreading all over his body.
“You are way too good for the world, you know that?  And how did you make Jim sleep?  She was so fussy with me. Do you think she doesn't like me?”
, and explained his principles, Harry had wanted him. For the first time, this Harry understood this was a man with perfect self-respect and understanding of what he wanted. God’s, he wanted him badly.
Harry was absolutely, completely petrified when they walked through their door. That was the thing about babies. They were the world’s biggest responsibility, and they came with absolutely no instructions! What did you actually
“You’re safe here,” Harry said, leading Draco to their bedroom. “Let’s sleep, and we’ll see how you feel in a couple of hours.”
"Thank you. Now I'll have to lead the meeting completely wet. I hope the other alphas don't smell it," he sent, and then went about his day.
Harry dug into his breakfast, enjoying the wonderful, scrumptious food that the hotel provided. Checking that there was no one around, he gave Draco’s thigh a quick squeeze.
Only once he had Draco sat down did he even try to speak. Harry picked up a fleecy thrown blanket and wrapped it around Draco. True, Harry has certainly envisaged their evening differently, but he could tell that Draco was terribly anxious.
“Eat me up, Harry. You can have me all you want. I'm all yours.”
to have babies, but that's not as if I can decide whether or not I can have one or not have one. You know I love sex with you, and I have no problem with doing it every day. Me wanting or not a baby is not really a problem, is it?”
The world around Harry seemed to disappear; to fade away so that it truly didn’t matter anymore. Even Lyra, sitting there shocked into silence by Harry’s actions didn’t register on his emotions. He knew that when Draco walked out of the door, he was going into an uncertain future.
“I guess I have to pack our lightest clothing. We're going to Brazil!”
He called an Uber, and left as quickly as possible to the bank, signing the checks inside the car. All of them were small amounts of money that he could justify as if he was buying some jewellery or some clothes, but that, together, was a small fortune if ever he lost all the money on his account. He hoped it wouldn't happen any day soon, but...
"But, Draco...!"
Draco was being a hypocrite, he knew that. He touched himself there before, but the idea of Harry's massive cock getting in there... It was scary, to say the least. And it was improper. He couldn't even have babies from there.
Moving downwards, he licked and sucked on Draco’s cock, enjoying the feel of its hardness against the end of his tongue. It tasted delicious, sour and sharp at the slit. Harry rolled his lips around his husband’s petite hardness, groaning in ecstasy at the intimacy of the moment.
Harry commenced cleaning Draco with his mouth, wiping away the soap with the day old stubble of his beard, and swallowing down his cock with the searing heat of his mouth.
“Will you do what I asked...? I really... I really want to hear you talking how you filled me up with a baby... How my breasts will grow heavy with milk... How you'll just fuck me every day and fill me with your come even though I already have a baby inside... Will you do it for me, Harry?”
Slowly, she unwrapped her baby, supporting Jasmine on her legs, and took off her green and white onesie with a “P” on the chest area. Carefully, she opened her nappy - clean, for now, as she had just changed -  and looked between her legs. Draco didn't know
Stripping off his underwear Harry climbed into the shower. The water was wonderfully hot, and cascaded over his muscles in a heavenly stream.
“Is that something you’d like?” Harry asked, surprised. Draco “I know you like Lyra, and that family is important to you... But a baby? With me?”
Harry sat up, rubbing his chin a little before he spoke. “I’d like to be the Managing Director of a charity, supporting impoverished young people. My life was hard as a child, and I hate the idea of any other child having to go through what I had to endure... I’d like to advise on staying in education, avoiding the pitfalls of getting pregnant or forced marriage. It doesn’t matter whether they were alpha or omega; the awful prejudices we live with makes the world worse for everyone. But it’d take a lot of setting up, and I can’t for the life of me imagine where I’d get the finances.”
As Draco saw the image, he couldn't help but drool. He had never seen such... a thing before. Not in a real person that he knew in real life, at least. From that moment on, porn was ruined for him. Completely ruined.
Draco drank it all, eyes closed, her body desperate for it. When his body relaxed,  she got to her pillow again, a smug smile on her mouth.
And just looking at Draco was making Harry close to coming too. He could see how she was convulsing with pleasure, and his body was vibrating alongside hers. His body felt like it was   burning with pleasure, like he was a firework that was rigged to explode.
“Harry? Can we talk?”
“Take me, Harry... Make me forget about everything...”
, at least it was how it felt when it was all the way inside him. Draco held on Harry for dear life, and he closed his eyes, hard. He knew he asked for it, but the shock still lingered. He didn't know what to expect. He felt so full, and complete, and at the same time it was something so new and strange. His feelings were pouring and for some reason, he felt like crying.
That, however, wouldn’t be the woman he had married.
Draco moved a little, kissing Harry on his cheek, thinking about his words.
“I’m coming too... Fuck, Draco. You’re so good, so beautiful...” Harry could feel the familiar swirl and twist in his stomach, could feel his orgasm shivering thought every cell of his body.
“Don’t be ashamed” Harry said quietly, as he sat up more fully. He could see that Draco looked embarrassed by her leaking breasts but he thought that she shouldn’t be.
“You okay, Draco? You seem a bit shocked, and I suppose I did spring it on you a bit... But you’re completely perfect, and we’ve managed everything else, you just need the proper preparation. But we don’t have to do it at all, or I could just use fingers... Draco, we’ll do whatever makes you feel safe.”
Harry was heartbroken though.
“That was just... Well, it was just
The wizard had trained himself in both apothecary and Muggle horticulture so Draco paid his employees to learn the same. Both disciplines were necessary to create amazing bouquets that were both safe and beautiful. Draco had an owl system as well as a phone with which to take orders. One morning, Draco was in the back office, working on bookkeeping, when he heard the chime of the Firecall. Knowing his apprentice would answer, Draco worked until he found a good stopping point before going to assist with putting together the new order. His apprentice was currently taking muggle horticulture classes, so Draco needed to ensure that he didn't agree to make a bouquet that would eat each other or otherwise have a negative reaction.
Pulling off, Harry kissed a line into the curve of his boyfriend’s arse, licking and nipping lightly as he went. Panting, Harry begged, “Let me make love to you... Let me fill your arse with my wide cock. I want to feel you riding me, Draco-”
Well, he didn't say that actually, did he?  He was actually trying to protect their baby and her. He was doing the right thing. Now she felt so guilty she wanted to cry all over again.
“Firstly, Draco, I can’t imagine you’d only think your parents valued you for your breeding abilities. You’re one of the finest businessmen I’ve worked with, and you’ve got such innovative ideas for the company. You
Before they left the hotel, the receptionist exchanged their wizarding british currency to their own equivallent, something called 'Tostão',  that their translation spell always translated to 'pennies' and Draco found it to be hilarious. They were spending all of the pennies on wooden made toys, like cars, and very classic fabric dolls, soft and made with coloured cotton, something only found in this region of Brazil. They were naturally coloured and very expensive, but Draco found it very worthy.
“Of course we can get you some boy clothes, sweetheart. Anything you want to make you feel good... Draco. Remember, we’re meeting some of your friends this weekend. Why don’t you buy yourself some new jeans or maybe you’d like to wear one of the dresses? Whatever you want, Draco. You’d look wonderful whatever you chose.”
tongue.
“Okay my darling... You’re so shy and tight, and I don’t want to hurt you, so I’m going to be so gentle and slow. Your body is a joy to me, and I’m going to make it a joy to you too”.
“Is this...Is it okay? Gods, you’re so fucking tight, so hot... Fuck, Draco... Is this good for you?”
“This is
because your sperm was weak," Draco said, turning to his Mother with sadness in his eyes as his Father struggled to find his words. "I love you, Mother. I'm sorry that you have to leave with an alpha who doesn't know how to properly treat the preciosity an Omega is. And you, Nott," he looked at the alpha who seemed misplaced in the middle of the Malfoy's foyer. "I hope you find an omega who makes you lick the ground they walk over. You're not good enough to protect anyone."
Missing the warmth of his t-shirt and due to Harry's touches, his nipples hardened immediately, and he felt chills running down his body.
Harry had wanted this to be innocent, a relaxing start to their trip, but the slick body under his fingertips and his painfully hard cock were telling him a different story, making the massage into a far more sensual experience.
. Draco felt sad. He wouldn't ever compare to her. She had long, red hair, beautiful brown eyes and a well-built athletic body. She was apparently married again with fucking
Draco raised her head, her mouth wet and red, frustration rolling over her body. She sighed, holding herself up with her hands on Harry's knees and stood up, rearranging her clothes so it didn't show too much of her skin.
"Stop with this non-sense right now, Draco! You'll marry whoever we say you will! You're an omega, I'm an alpha, and you do as I say!" He could see a vein pop on his father's head, and Draco knew he already lost everything, so why not stick his fingers into the wound?
“And don’t worry about being confused about your feelings,” Harry reminded his omega. “I’m a bit confused too. This is all new to me, this is a whole new world for both of us.”
“Harry... Harry...!” her voice didn't come out, and she started to cry, holding her bump as she could make Jim stay inside for longer. She moved, trying not to slip in the dripping liquid, turning around the bed and touching Harry's shoulder, shaking him. She couldn't speak. Dear Merlin, Jim wasn't supposed to come now! It was too soon!
Draco smiled, sitting on his bed as his plan was traced on his mind. He got his extra phone from his bag, turned it on and called Pansy from it.
“Harry... Please... I need it... Just put it in... Fill up all my holes with you... Don't leave anywhere empty...”
When Harry heard Draco’s words he couldn’t help himself. His body was moving far faster than his mind, the orgasm happening faster than he’d ever imagined possible. His magic flowed through his veins and he felt a heightened sense of his husband’s body, so tightly clasped around him.
than surprised at the menu.
Draco swallowed hard. He pretended he didn't see the message and called Harry immediately. What the fucking hell would he do now? He was totally busted. Once Harry picked up, Draco immediately spilled his worries:
Normally, Harry loved the weekend, but he had a bad feeling about this one. His daughter, Lyra, was turning seven and he was expected to attend her party. Well, that was all fine but that meant Ginny and her new alpha, Blaise. Oh, Harry supposed he was
The feeling passed at she opened her eyes and saw her nipples still dripping milk.
“I know I’ll love your cock... You shouldn’t have anxieties about it. If it’s joined to you, then it’ll be the best cock on the earth. Tomorrow, I’ll suck you, and lick you... Make you gasp for mercy, Draco”.
, going up again and smiling as he bit half of the chocolate still sticking out of Harry's mouth, his lips touching his alpha's in a sinful kiss.
He started to undo his husband’s shirt, wanting to pinch and squeeze his nipples in return, not even feeling slightly inclined to be gentle.
He got up, stressed, his whole body trembling. Oh dear God he was fucked.
Harry leaned in, taking one into his mouth, sucking hard and enjoying every moment.
He took a wash, leaving his hair to dry itself and put on some jeans and a black jumper, together with some black converse shoes. He didn't care about look proper or omega right now. He just wanted to get home and relax for once is his life.
Draco felt that Harry was hesitating, and she didn't want any of that. She grabbed him by his arms and walked to the settee, making Harry sit on it and straddling his lap.
Draco's hands gripped his silk sheets tighter than he ever intended to. It hurt. Fuck, it hurt. Harry was so big and he had never done it before. It was like he was being stuffed way much more than he could be. But also it didn't hurt near as much as losing his virginity. Actually, compared to that pain, this one was very bearable.
Draco loved every bit of his wedding day. Everything was beautiful, his mother had made miracles on that place. The food was amazing, and he felt really good even among dozens of Weasleys and so little of his family and friends. He knew Andromeda and Teddy were his family, but they looked like they were Harry's. Draco didn't mind, really. Now, all of them were both his and Harry's family.
him. Plenty of people who had demanded he follow them, submit to their orders and threatened him perhaps. Nobody deserved a baby more than him.
About a year had passed. Jasmine was one year and 2 months old - and, no, Draco wouldn't say those ridiculous months age. Jasmine was walking, and speaking a few words, her hair longer and really, really smart. She was still very small for her age, but Draco had to remember she was an early child.
“I can’t see inside your heart, Draco. I love you, you must know that.... And not because you’re a boy. I’ve never been gay, I don’t think... Not in the traditional sense of the word. I’d have loved you, anyway, if you’d been a girl when we met... I suppose what I’m trying to say - incredibly inelegantly, as always - is that whatever, however you define yourself, I love you. All I ask is that you let me stay by your side, and let me support and care for you. Me and the worm, we’ll both be here, looking after you, loving you. You just need to tell me how you see our future.”
“I guess I was crazy when I bought it, then. This aftershave has to go in the bin.”
“Okay, Draco,” he said, nuzzling close to his beloveds throat and kissing a line down his wet jaw. “I’m going to go
Harry relaxed into the kiss, feeling like he never wanted his omega to leave his side again.
Flowers of a Dragon was a blooming florist emporium in the middle of Diagon Alley. They combined magical and non magical plants for their bouquets, something that really seemed to hit it off with their magical customers. Draco Malfoy was the owner and head florist of the shop, and he hired only the best to work alongside him.
Harry didn’t quite know what the score was with Draco today, but he certainly wasn’t going to do any complaining.
Harry’s heart was racing. He couldn’t believe this was really happening, that it could be true. He knew he was shaking but he couldn’t seem to control his reactions.
Days passed, and on Wednesday, Draco was having his customary dinner with his parents. His mother was a petit omega, just like him. She had a strict expression, but her face was soft around the edges. His father, on the other hand, was a 'square' alpha, as he liked to say. All edges. From him, Draco only got the pale gray eyes, different from the lagoon blue of his mother's. They were eating their dinner making small talk. Draco didn't know, but his mother had invited her sister, Bellatrix, the alpha of his three aunts, and her omega husband, Rodolphus. He had to keep his smiles on all the time, acting like the cute, polite omega he was. Thankfully he decided to wear a dress that day. It was very common for male omegas to use alpha-like clothing, but on Draco's household, it was still a bit frowned upon. His parents got used to it, but his aunt... Well, she'd be the first to tell him he looked like a modern whore.
Harry’s hands gripped his lover’s sides, and he lavished kisses all over Draco’s breasts and body. Harry could have stayed like this forever, could willingly have taken him there and then. He’d felt his excitement building, and a loosening off of his control...
“Fuck, Harry, yes! Fuck me... Fuck me deep and hard...” Draco tried to move and make Harry's cock slip inside, but he only managed to make his finger go deeper. Draco moaned with the sensation, legs trembling. He was so wet that the insides of his thighs were glistening with his transparent pleasure.
A sharp, strong pain took over him. He gritted his teeth, tears filling his eyes, his cunt clenching around Harry's erection, trying to come back to its original, smaller shape.
“We’re having a bit of a party. Cakes, a magician. We’d love you to come, of course.” Ginny smiled, and fished three juice drinks from the picnic basket. “You’ll be eight and a half months then, though Draco. What has the hospital said? Are they planning to induce the baby before your due date?”
She now only had to wait a little before she could see Harry. As she held Jasmine in her arms and gave her index finger so her daughter could hold her, Draco had a thought. The healers said Jasmine was a
His balls were tight and close to his body, and then he just couldn’t hold on any longer. His cock was pulsing, searing hot into Draco’s mouth and filling it with his pearlescent come.
taste.
Draco sighed, feeling like Harry was drifting to sleep. He wasn't feeling that much tired anymore, but he tried to force himself to sleep. He knew they had a long trip tomorrow, going back to England and their lives, now as a married couple.
"I told you plenty of times that I would like that. Did you think I was joking?" Draco frowned, touching Harry's shoulder and looked deep into his amazing, green eyes. He loved that alpha so much it hurt, and he knew he couldn't do much right now. "Harry, you're turning to be so important to me. I never thought I'd feel a connection so strong with someone, or that I'd have so strong feelings in such little time. We had months together and it seems it was years. If... If I wasn't a Malfoy, I'd be proudly showing off your mark right now, begging for my heat to come so you could fill me up with your seed. I'm in this deep, Harry... I just don't know what to do from now on... Because I feel like I'd have to live in secret and... I don't want that. I want you, and a babe,
He passed the pickle on the honey and then into his mouth. A burst of flavours took over his taste buds and he had to put some pickles all over his toasts and honey.
... empty...
“Delicious, baby,” he smiled, piecing his fork with a little pancake and feeding his daughter a little of his back. Of course, he hadn’t told Jasmine he’d put lemon juice on his pancake. Jasmine’s eyes opened comically, but she was her father’s daughter and ate up the whole mouthful without a complaint.
Harry seemed to be doing so much stuff around her and she felt useless. She just wanted those weeks to pass and have her baby out of her.
This omega was
"I believed in you. And after... you said, you were
Focusing on Draco, he licked, kissed and bit a line down Draco’s body. He felt wonderful under Harry’s lips. Soft, pliable and beautiful. He smelt like an alpha’s dream, and looked like a prince nestled on the soft white sheets.
Maybe Draco would talk to him when they arrived home.
"Oh, fuck, fuck,
He opened his eyes when Harry asked that, one of his small hands going to one of his breasts, squeezing, touching the nipple and teasing it. He looked at Harry and smiled, spreading his legs.
It hurt. But it didn't hurt as much as what it represented. It represented that Draco was wrong. Wrong to be a wife, wrong to be a mother, wrong to be a human being. She was born wrong, a boy with too many bits, and now a girl with too many bits. It was like Draco could never be what she was without having people around telling her she was
After a few moments Harry slipped in just the tip of a finger. It felt searing hot, and tight. This tiny touch was the most erotic thing Harry had ever experienced, and he pulled in a sharp breath. His cock was leaking, swollen against the other man thigh, but his whole attention was focussed on the minuscule movements of his finger.
When he reached Harry's cock, Draco didn't wait before licking around the head, tasting his alpha and the sweetness of chocolate. After he was clean, he opened his mouth, sucking his cock up and down, bobbing his head and holding Harry by his legs, one hand going to Harry's balls and playing with them, his saliva running down the shaft.
the love of Harry’s life.
"Harry, look how I am for you... I'd love you to lick me here..."
that was pouring from his body as he stood there.
“I missed you, too. She slept the whole night, because of the spell. It makes her drowsy,” Draco showed him the yellow light around their baby, being careful not to disturb it. “You can hold her if you want, but take care. I think she wants to know daddy a little better.”
Lyra declared that she would love a banana split, and Harry ordered two of those, and a tutti-frutti for himself once the waiter had arrived. They sipped their drinks while they were waiting, and talked about their afternoon plans.
Draco grabbed his cup, sipping the coffee with pleasure. "I'd like to unpack. I'm wearing the same clothes of yesterday and I really want to have my comfy baggy tees back."
“I promise you’ll be pregnant far before that... The idea of you, big with our baby, growing a person that is part of both of us... It’s the hottest thing I could imagine...”
As he entered the bathroom, he looked at his husband's back. He didn't tell Harry enough how he loved him, how he was lucky to have him, but he just didn't know how. He hoped his actions spoke better than his words.
“That’s where you belong,” Harry stated. “In your alpha’s arms. You’re precious to me, Draco Malfoy.”
“Jasmine, I said
He passed her carefully and delicately over to Draco, and then fished around in his bag for his camera.
“Ha--arry...” he whispered, his legs trembling at the sheer energy of their coupling. As he felt Harry reach the bottom, he swallowed the saliva that gathered in his mouth and tried to open his eyes. He was sweating. “Do it... Please... Move... I can handle it... I need it, do it, do it...”
“It’s so fabulous to hear from you!” Lyra gushed, her voice sparking on the other end of the line. “Mum and Blaise are so
to have a visit. I'm sure you are going to like it very much, sir."
“Fuck me already, Potter. What are you waiting for? A formal invitation?” she teased.
The problem was, having an alpha there would cause Draco far more agony than he might be used to. He didn’t want to cause any omega physical pain, and he had no idea if Draco Malfoy knew what he was doing.
“I don't think me and Jim can eat it all,” Draco confessed, but bit into her burger all the same. She moaned with all the flavours in his mouth, so unexpected, and started stuffing her face. She just couldn't stop. Everything was so delicious she wanted if forever.
“Draco... I’m going to come any second,” Harry groaned. “I’m so close. Do you want me to-“
Draco was feeling as if his body had been drained of all its energy. He was still feeling full, and sticky, and so spent. He let Harry hold him, and closed his eyes, enjoying the amazing feeling of post-orgasmic bliss. He didn't know how much time they spent like this, but he may have dozed off a little. He opened his eyes, touching Harry's shoulder and smiling.
Feeling the milk leak from Draco’s breasts nearly broke Harry. It was so primal and sensual, and so completely feminine. As Draco gasped her desires; her wanton wish to be filled with another baby, Harry pulled Draco’s body towards his and lavished kisses and small bites all over her breasts.
Harry was shaking too. He loved his wife so much, and he just wished she could see it. He just wondered why he was forbidden from being comforted as well.
Harry just
The knots were loose, and really a representation of Draco’s submission rather than actual restraints. Even so, Harry made sure his omega wasn’t uncomfortable, and felt safe.
First things first, though. Before he went to work on Draco’s breasts, he wanted to remove those knickers with his mouth.
Draco’s mouth was a perfect circle taking every inch of his cock. Just looking down at her sopping wet head, bobbing so beautifully on his prick was nearly enough to tip him into the abyss, and he nearly spent his load straight into her soft red mouth.
When Harry asked about Nott, Draco refused with his head.
“This is less a bedroom than it is a bloody suite of rooms. No wonder you’ve always been such a fancy git. This is bigger than most muggle flats.”
"I'll go. Just let me shower and relax for a couple of minutes. Can you dress Iris...? With beautiful clothes, I mean. Not that cowgirl non-sense thing you dressed her last week, please."
He tiptoed, kissing Harry lightly.
"Don't worry about Nott. We've been childhood friends so he sometimes forgets himself," Draco said, smiling at Harry and feeling like he was at home. He has never felt protected like this. It was only him in this big world, and now... Now he felt he had someone to be with him, even for a couple of hours.
While they walked to get what he wanted, Draco remembered they were out of honey - his favourite treat of all.
Harry shook his head. He’d made a promise not to pressure, and he’d stuck to it. But those jeans were so snug and the t-shirt looked positively sinful. Harry couldn’t help feeling attracted to the man inside them.
A sense of sheer happiness had taken over him. Also confusion, and sadness, and a feeling of being inappropriate. There were so many things inside his head, he just went with Harry. Let him kiss him, closed his eyes with the feeling of Harry's hand running through his hair strands.
Harry read the text, getting to his feet immediately. His omega was summoning him, and every urge told him that he needed to be with him straight away.
," Draco replied, raising from the chair he was on and walking over to his bedroom, flopping on the bed stomach down, which made his bum show. He didn't care much, but the sensation of being cold on that area made him think of being undressed by some alpha hands... "I'm not busy," he continued. "it's just... I'm sorry, maybe I'm being too forward, I know that not how a proper omega would act but... I couldn't stop thinking about you this weekend. I am interested in... A little more than talking about our job. If you don't want, that's okay."
“Have I ever mentioned how gorgeous you are…?”
Harry didn’t want Draco to move ever again. Having the omega nested in so close to his chest felt like the most powerful luxury, and he revelled in their closeness. Draco smelt beautiful, his scent warm and rich, filling Harry’s nostrils, and sending a shiver of pure lust down his spine.
He was constantly in and off a healer’s clinic, since his reproductive system was underdeveloped and he needed to pay attention closely to his pregnancy. They said it was like a miracle it happened, because although it was completely formed, it wasn't mature enough to hold the pregnancy. Perhaps he had had fertilised eggs before that were expelled before they could latch on his uterus, but they'd never know. The current theory was that his magic was holding this one in place, so he was drinking a lot of magic replenishers and blood thickeners to lessen the risk of a miscarriage. He was also advised to take it easy on the field, no rushing to the fallen players, and sitting all the time when he wasn't performing any type of healing.
, he wanted to give that impression.
“Yes, we have room for everybody. We have too Quidditch camp behind hotel, you have to sign if want to use it two hours before and see if it is free,” she spoke slowly, trying to find her words. Wood wasn't using a translation spell, thus forcing the receptionist to actively speak English, and she seemed a little rusty. The girl separated their keys and distributed them, asking for their names. When she got to 'Harry Potter', she breathed in a little, frowning her eyebrows. “Do I know you?” She asked, looking at Harry. Draco smiled. It seemed like Harry Potter wasn't quite as famous, even though he was at least known, on this part of the world.
Draco breathed in, noticing just now that he was crying.
His trousers were tented with the heft of his cock, thick and heavy with want for the beautiful woman in front of him.
She sighed, but then a small smile appeared.
Draco's smile got bigger. He sat down, even though he hadn't eaten that afternoon, from his nerves. He really wanted her to like him.
He leant over and peppered tiny kisses all over her face and hair - knowing he was touching her with his beard and not caring - and ghosted his arms all over her sides.
was part of both he and Draco. He hoped that the whole world would be accepting of their family, just as their close social circle were.
Harry pulled Draco to him, revelling in the omega’s soft, warm skin and his sweet scent. He pressed a few more chaste kisses on the top of his silky hair, and made his way to the door. There were still a few more hours of the day left, and if Harry didn’t want to attract suspicion he needed to work every minute of them.
“Harry... Fuck... Why is it always so good?” Draco asked, raising his head and smiling. “I'll never, ever get tired of you.”
He looked around the living room, searching Harry with his eyes.
It showed him perfectly. Legs open, small, closed cunt glistening with slick. It was but a line, so small and delicate. His small cock was hard, a dark shade of pink. Draco supposed he could have taken another one that showed his arsehole better, but this one showed enough.
"You make me feel safe, alpha... I know I'm in the right place when I'm with you."
“Are you ready?” he asked Harry after he'd put on his shoes. “I'm excited. I've read so many things about this place.”
"Harry..." He purred, fingernails touching his alpha's back, needing to be taken care now. "Thank you... Fuck, it was so good Harry... But I need you to bathe me and put me in bed now..."
What followed was an extremely enjoyable morning for Harry. The factory was new and modern, but Harry could see some areas in Design and Technology, Operations Management and Personnel where he felt good advice could develop productivity. While Draco kept up a litany of blue-blooded gossip with Ollivander, Harry enjoyed making notes, and finding areas of improvement.
so badly, and Harry knew he could be seriously tempted...
A note on how heats work in this story: it's a feeling similar to PMS. The omega gets extra fertile, extra horny, and also, extra emotional. It's not an uncontrollable feelings, but it's very strong. An alpha can smell the omega's heat, and much more intensely if they are bonded.
- and then asking if Draco was interesting in maybe have dinner together after work -
Their home?  Maybe?
It was the first time he was touched like this, and so intensely. His cunt was gushing slick, his body craving to be filled, the omega inside him screaming to be knotted, to be full, to be claimed...
After a while he managed to open it, and pulled Harry's cock out. He knew it was going to be big, at least bigger than his, but... That was
A little softer perhaps, a little less angular. But still perfect under his fingers, intoxicating and attractive.
I can imagine how you look; the curl of your lips and the furrow of your brow. Of all the wizards in this world, I expect I'm the last person you imagined receiving an owl from today.
“You are so warm... And comfortable,” Draco mumbled, as happy as he would ever be.
Harry texted back quickly, suddenly beyond excited at the thought of seeing Draco. They’d not really seen each other for the whole week, and had only talked in professional emails. It simply hadn’t been enough, and every part of his alpha soul had been crying out to have his lover close, skin-on-skin, their scents mingling and filling the air.
Draco's face reflected his relief, but he rested his head on Harry's shoulder for a bit, loving that Harry didn’t care he was also getting wet.  Draco’s nose scented Harry's bonding scar. It wasn't as deep as Harry's mark on Draco's neck, but it was there forever nonetheless.
His balls tightened up close to his body and streams of hot come filled Draco, leaking out onto his husband’s arse cheeks and the green sheets beneath them.
“Well, then let's go. After all this
"Yess, Harry! Prep my arse to have you, please... Make me loose enough to have all of your cock inside me... I want to ride you, I want to feel your knot inside of me... Please, Harry, give it to me..."
Harry led Draco up towards his bedroom, both of them sneaking past Lyra’s room in an exaggerated silence.
Harry wondered at Draco’s words. From the confident, masterful way that Draco had spoken to him in the office, and the sheer
The feel of his small, warm breast under Harry’s rougher hands was addictive. Rolling his nipples between his fingertips, he squeezed the small curve of it in his palm. It felt great just to share their bodies, their intimacy needing no words to express it.
“It just doesn’t seem fair, daddy,” Lyra said, looking at Harry with red-rimmed eyes. “If I was the Queen I wouldn’t let anybody be horrible. I’d let everybody do what they wanted.”
“I’ll take my chances, thank you.” Harry smirked. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I have work and a life to lead. You just have high blood pressure and killer breath from all the coffee you consume. You know what people say Nott? Small things concern small people. Seems like you’re
hand, she was sure - and just pain and strength. She was doing it for Jim, she tried to remind herself. It was all for Jim, if they wanted to come out earlier, that was okay, but then they needed to be with her forever.
"Yes, alpha," Draco held the blanket around him, hugging his own body and trying to be smaller. He wanted to be protected, and he really didn't want to think about difficult things on that moment. He had to make difficult decisions all the time, so he let Harry do this for him now.
“It’ll be our secret, love. We’ll sneak around keep it our own private business. And now I owe you a rather lovely orgasm, I think...
?” Draco asked, his mouth red from their kisses. “I... Maybe if it's here... Under the shower... Maybe we can do it...”
. Or else you'll get me dirty again,” Draco got up, feeling his legs shake.
“Your tits are sore?... I’ll have to massage them, kiss them all better. Can’t have my spoilt baby aching and sore.” Harry kissed Draco, loving how warm she was under his mouth.
Just as a matter of information, Polly writes as Draco and Ladderofyears writes as Harry.
But Harry pulled away. He wasn’t willing to pressure or manoeuvre Draco in any way. And he knew that showing his obvious want was doing just that.
Draco walked around their living room, one hand on her baby bump, the other on her hip.
deep into the cut.
Draco's eyes rolled back, and he tried to shove back at Harry, even though the alpha's strength was enough to push him completely forwards. His chest was resting on the mattress, and he could feel the burn building in his lower belly.
"Harry... Harry is my mate," he whispered, hugging himself. "I've only ever wanted him. I want to marry him, Father. I'd... I'd keep running the company, I'd do only the best for our family, but plea--"
“Thank you for coming to me,” said Harry warmly, taking a bite of the chocolate digestive and promptly getting crumbs all over himself. “I’m a bit nervous I suppose... Worried that now you’re here you might find me wanting, or not quite what you imagined.” Harry took a sip of his strong, bitter coffee and waited quietly for Draco to reply.
The sensation was just too big. Even though they had played many times, touched and he had felt Harry's mouth before on his body, it wasn't even near the sensation he was having now. His whole body tingled and shivered, and he couldn't make his eyes open. It was as if the feeling was too big and he couldn't have other sensation such as vision on the way.
“Gods Draco, I have never met any bloody person in my life as jealous as you! No, having kids with anyone else isn’t on my agenda now, or at any other time...”
Taking a deep breath, Harry counted to five and started to speak. He made an effort to speak clearly and without a tremor in his voice, as he didn’t want Draco to know just how terrified he was feeling. He put his arm over hers, squeezing her forearm to say that he was there, and that she was loved.
Harry pushed in a forth finger. It felt tight, and scolding hot inside Draco but not impossible. Tensing his hand Harry gave one last push forward, pressing with all his strength till he met resistance. It felt so fantastic, like he was discovered Draco’s most hidden, forbidden place, and he was loose limbed and panting with desire.
Stroking Draco’s cock, Harry moved onto his knees. He was going to do everything in his power to make his husband feel better.
If anyone had asked Harry what was discussed during the rest of the meeting, he doubted he would have been able to tell them. He had noticed the tall, younger alpha, Nott, glaring at him as the meeting carried on, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to care.
Finding his footing, Harry started to move more speedily, rocking his hips and enjoying the rosy arse of his husband as he took every inch of Harry’s massive cock.
“I’m not going to stop, sweetheart... Your body is perfect to me, every part...”
Harry was happy with Draco’s decision. Diagon Alley was chaos at the best of times, and while his wife was pregnant, there was no way he wanted to risk anything happening to either her or the baby.
Draco was finding it more difficult to get around as the pregnancy changed her body. They’d lay, legs wrapped around each other on the sofa and Harry would feel the taut, stretched skin of her swollen tummy under his fingers. He’d feel their baby shift and wriggle and respond to his magic when he came close.
Harry writhed under Draco’s attentions, the blood thrumming though his body and his pulse jumping in his throat. His skin was shivering, and he felt like all his deepest desires were being met in that moment. The chocolate felt bizarre next to his skin; cold and sticky, but still very sexy.
His pale skin was little by little showing itself. He wasn't using anything under his robes besides his tailored trousers and pants.
Hearing Draco’s words, Harry forced himself not to show his annoyance, and to swallow his disappointment. They were bonded now, and Harry had to respect that if Draco were saying no it must be for a good reason.
“Going to take this slowly, Draco,” he gasped, lining up his immense cock with Draco’s perfect arse. “Hold onto your legs really tightly, love, and push back against my cock. Your great big swollen prostrate will give you so much pleasure...”
Harry thought a blow job sounded like the most wonderful idea he’d heard all day. Draco was all mouth and desire, and he couldn’t help but be enraptured.
His heart sank. Out of 30 days in that month, his period has chosen that day to arrive. He washed in denial, but he couldn't anymore when he had to stick a pad on his underwear, a beautiful piece of white lace he bought for that day, including his top. He didn't like to use tops for his breasts, because he didn't like the restraining feeling, but those were cute, and he couldn't just not wear it.
. One of her hands grabbed Harry's hair, the other on his shoulder as she tried to have some balance over him. His cock inside her felt amazing and she helped his movements by going up and down, her strength on her rounded white thighs.
Instead, he arranged his face into a more serious, concerned look.
He even harboured secret thoughts of how he’d like to misuse Draco, shag him till his eyes rolled back in his head and he couldn’t even get his breath. Shag him till they were both sated, sweaty and sore.
“We’re going to Brazil!” Harry laughed, incredibly happy that Draco was up for an adventure. He was so happy that he could share this adventure with the woman that he loved and their baby too.
Talking made Draco calmer, but he got a bit more nervous about meeting Lyra now. She would of course tell her stepfather all about Daddy's new boyfriend. Draco knew his appearance was easily recognised, and he sighed.
If Draco wasn't so envious of them, it would've been an amazing night.
He smiled, holding Harry by his shoulders and tiptoeing so he could kiss him.
Harry took over willingly, and pushed Chloe and Iris around in the roundabout, their squeals noisy and happy. There wasn’t any resentment anymore between Ginny and himself. He knew that their relationship worked far better as friends, and that Lyra was parented better with them living apart.
"No lies, dear Draco. Only the truth. You must understand that me, as a respectable alpha, had to do what I had to do to protect you. You are out of your mind since that old alpha came to our business. You need to come back to what you were! A beautiful, calm and quiet omega your parents raised you to be!" Nott said, trying to show emotions on his voice.
Harry was glad that they still had just a few more weeks left. There were lots of little odd jobs still to do, and he didn’t want Draco to be stressed out by them.
Harry could feel his own body respond to Draco’s touch. He could feel his own response building, and her erratic hand movements only added to it.
Feeling his heart beating fast against his ribcage, he spread his legs wide, showing off his glistening wet cunt and his hard cock.
Then something magical happened. Somehow, Harry touched something deep inside him, that made him literally explode inside. He gasped, the jolts of pleasure dancing inside his body. When it happened again, Draco came, his hand going limp on his cock, and he was coming, and coming, and coming non-stop, getting even more pleasure as he felt Harry coat his insides with hot come.
He moved into Draco’s space, lining up their bodies so that their cocks rubbed against each other, their lips touched in a kiss, and Harry’s torso crowded Draco’s lovely breasts. Rutting his hips against Draco, the friction was delicious. His husband smelt beautiful, warm, clean and citrusy.
Harry flooed back to the hospital with a selection of the clothes Draco had asked for and some new clothes for Jasmine that he’d charmed into a smaller size. He’d also brought Draco’s wand, so she could make her surroundings exactly to her liking.
Slowly she was falling asleep, satisfied and happy in his arms.
Harry stood, and stretched. His morning cock stood stiffly to attention and he smiled. “Don’t worry, I’m not about to ask for another shag; I know we’d get caught in the act.”
Pulling his lips away, Harry breached his husband’s cunt deeply, heavily and purposefully. Pushing his hard length home, Harry was buried root deep in moments, an unconscious gasp escaping his mouth as he slammed into Draco repeatedly.
Draco smiled at his phone when he saw Harry's message. He was indeed a very different alpha from all of those who Draco have met before. He sighed, replying:
"That's what I always say: a good spanking would've prevented it," Lucius concluded, and looked at Draco. "Thankfully, we know our boy wouldn't ever do something as shameful as this. He's well educated."
being an omega, with this particular alpha looking at him as if he'd destroy the world to protect him.
for me. Which is nice, I suppose. I'd be thrilled to have heard it from your mouth,
Draco haven't noticed he was crying until he started to sob. Fuck, his period has ended already, it couldn't be PMS. It was just him being bloody sensitive.
"Like this... Like this, please, alpha. I want to feel it perfectly when your knot stretch me open and your come fills my insides..."
It didn't help though. A couple of minutes later,
Harry felt himself coming too. The tight snug heat of his lover’s body, the splash of the bath water and the coiling intensity in his stomach mixing, making him lose all control. Everything felt like it was aflame, like his body was filled with a hundred slithering snakes and he didn’t quite have control over his actions.
with him. His body, his mind, his soul. Everything was Harry. As he felt Harry's body pounding against his, his slick dripping down his legs, Draco came,
He was reading towards the living room when his phone rang.
“Alright love... Whatever you want. Just remember, you’re not your past. That person isn’t you anymore.”
He pulled the omega onto his knee and wrapped a throw around them both. “How’s this for domestic?” he smiled. “We’re just two boyfriends right now, being boring and couple-y together. Watching TV. This is what I do with Lyra when she’s upset... I’ll always look after you, Draco. Always try to give you what you need.”
“Please, take me to bed. I need you with me, too. I'm sorry... It's just everything is so new... I'm not sure how to react yet. And I'm sorry for earlier. If you want... Maybe we can continue? I'm... I'm definitely more awake now,” she laughed a little.
“My mother's name is beautiful, but I'd rather give one of her own... What do you think of Thalita for a second name? Then we could have both of our traditions?”
Harry felt the most wonderful erotic charge as he stroked Draco’s breasts. They were warm and smooth, and he rolled the taut little nipples in his palm. They felt so good underneath his rough fingers, like the softest silk, and it left Harry panting, feeling so much need for this man and everything about him.
Draco couldn't help but feel excited about it. He missed Harry so much this week, because of his self-imposed distance. It was needed, they were getting to clingy at work, and Draco hated the gossip, especially because of how crude they were.
“Okay,” he agreed. “I’ll come to your house at six. We’ll talk more then... But I’m sure that it was just Pansy nipping past or somebody talking a short cut. Nothing to worry about darling.”
Draco felt tears of pleasure falling from his eyes, his whole body trembling with the sensation of Harry licking, kissing, touching him all over. His legs were weak, and he held himself with his chest, his arse up for Harry.
He was a mess, but he couldn't care less.
The sight of licking his come was the sexiest sight he could conceive, and he moaned in delight at the sight. The clasp on his cock was tight and slow just like he loved.
Draco like stare when it was cheeky enough to quack in her direction.
Harry started moving a little faster, cock still clasped so tight and so delicious. The sensation was entirely different to their earlier fucking: more sensitive and less pliant.
Harry looked at his wife, glad she had started to get her thoughts on a more even keel. In his experience, it just took Draco some time to come around, she was complicated, but that was part of why he loved her so much.
"I'd bond you this
Harry rang Lyra instead, wanting desperately to speak to somebody. His daughter was as chirpy as always, and was overjoyed to hear from her dad.
With that, leant back down over his lover, and started kissing a line down to Draco’s slick soaked knickers.
Harry massaged his temples. He could feel the start of a massive headache coming on, and the last thing he needed was for this argument to carry on even one more minute than it had to.
“Not on my watch!” Draco said, getting into the living room. She had changed to black skinny jeans and a shirt, hair loose for the day. It was very long, and she didn't have any plans to cut it out. “You'll destroy my hard work, Potter, and then I'll have to wash you both,” Draco got closer to him, kissing his cheek and Jasmine's hair.
But Harry knew he couldn’t have made a different choice. He wasn’t willing to risk their precious baby. Even though they’d never met, their little Jim had become one of the stars at the centre of his universe.
Harry had to smile as he finally spied his phone, hidden in a pile of pillows on the floor. It seemed that Draco and his baby had been playing with the phone earlier and had hidden it in her ‘den’. That was life with a toddler, Harry supposed. The baby was tiny but all the equipment filled rooms.
It was all too much and too fantastic, and Draco ejaculated into Harry’s mouth in record time. The next thing Draco knew, Harry was kissing him. It was every bit as good as Draco’s hottest daydreams and the bitter flavour of his own climax was a potent aphrodisiac. His cock already felt ready for round two.
A few quick spells and Harry thought he might pass Draco’s high standards. Holding his husbands hand they walked purposefully out of their suite, and down to meet Narcissa.
. He opened it and read, his heart beating fast.
not focusing on when we were at school. I do realise we have a Queen, but Queens marry Kings right?”
When he checked his accounts, he wasn't surprised. It was all blocked. He couldn't make a single transaction. All his credit cards were also blocked, except for one - his first credit card, that his Mother helped him do when he was eighteen, and that only her and him had access to. Its validation ended in a year, though, and even if it worked, he had no money to pay it.
“Don’t you worry Draco, the driver knows about keeping his mouth shut. If people’s secrets got out, then I promise you, they’d have no business left.” Harry broke off his words to kiss Draco once more, his kisses this time a little bit more sensual and hot, his body growing warm and sensitive under the deliciousness of their touch.
“Do you have any plans? I want to see the market, see if they have something different that I can use for potions or just buy as a souvenir.”
Harry realised that he wasn’t even that far from coming.
Harry felt everything around him grow blurry as his orgasm hit him hard, the shockwaves pouring through his body, his skin on fire. Come poured out of him, filling Draco, coating his husband’s inner thighs with spunk, making his entire body shudder in love and excitement. It was perfect, utter joy and Harry was completely sated, completed debauched.
A pungent perfume smell reached Draco’s nose as he exited the lift on his floor. He picked up the pace, curiosity fueling him as he practically ran to his door. Outside of his flat, every single bouquet purchased from his shop had been arranged in a beautiful display. Draco gasped and dropped his keys in shock. A figure appeared from behind some of the flowers and handed Draco his keys with a smile. Emerald eyes flashed with joy as Draco’s eyes widened in shock.
“Draco... What’s wrong love? You were upbeat and feeling okay, just a second ago... It’s not our baby, is it? No, you’d be hysterical... And it’s a muggle place so it’s nobody’s used any slurs against you...”
Draco felt her cheeks burn with desire and a little of embarrassment from what Harry said, but she loved it so much. She went down with him, feeling her body pliant and lazy. Harry's arms were warm and comfortable, and she felt like sleeping then and there. She stretched her hand, summoning her wand with a whispered spell, and cleaned both of them, because the smell of sex was getting just a little bit too much for her sensitive nostrils.
Sitting as she was, Harry thought Draco’s bump seemed more pronounced this morning, and he couldn’t help tickling his baby. His wife felt like satin, round and comfortable.
“You’ll be the most wonderful, perfect mummy,” Harry whispered into her skin. “You’ll have so much love to give... “
Harry held the limp, pliable Draco in his wide arms. Their bodies were hot, and sticky, their scent a thick miasma of hormones that made Harry feel like there was no other place on Earth he would rather be.
Draco nodded, relieved. But she wanted her baby back with her. Why were they taking so bloody long?
Draco felt his heart sink. He truly understood why they'd have to keep it to themselves, but it hurt him so much. His eyes were teary as he spoke, at least.
“I know, Harry... It's just... I feel ashamed that I even have these type of thoughts. Maybe because I had to contain them while we were courting. Give me time... I'll tell you eventually.”
“Fuck, Harry... Can you see it? It... It... It's a... It's a baby... It's really a baby... Oh my fucking Salazar, it's... “
It was too weird when it began. Draco didn't understand the feelings he was having but, after a few thrusts, he started to feel real, real pleasure. The way Harry's cock slid inside him was delicious, and his own hand on his cock was making him closer and closer to his own peak.
Draco certainly took his time. He was even more sore now, and his hips hurt a little, his legs unused to being so open for so long. Maybe he'd lost his envied body when he quit Quidditch and spent so much time eating in Venice. His tummy was softer now, it was for sure, and he made a note to himself to start a diet as soon as he put his foot on England again.
As he wrote these words, Harry had been squeezing and rubbing his cock. He came on the last word, hot ribbons of come covering his hands and taut, muscular stomach. He groaned at the thought of the next night, when he’d be filling his husband with come instead.
The man has obviously planned something. Harry knew he couldn’t tell Draco. It would upset him further, and there wasn’t really anything either of them could do. All Harry could do was warm his lover, and support Draco after the eventual fallout.
The sensation of being complete was suddenly bigger than the pain. Maybe it was the bond mark and the sensations ti caused, but Draco was, indeed, ready. The pain slowly started to diminish as he rocked little by little over Harry.
Of course questions of 'how did you guys do it?' popped up, and Draco had to explain to them how they made it without potions or magic. Hermione, being who she was, was the first one to catch up and decided to do the explaining herself, even though she was already big and round, shiny eyes and chubbier cheeks. Draco thought with himself if he would ever get as big as she was now, and probably yes. It wasn't a bad thought, and he felt a little ashamed about it. He was fit and loved his body now, but somehow he wished for the round shape of her belly.
Draco opened his eyes, moving his head so he could look at Harry.
Draco was
“I would've healed myself when I got myself alone in the bathroom, you know that,” Draco said, his eyes turning to Harry just before his husband kissed him. Draco melted against him, closing his eyes and feeling like he was exactly in the right place.
He leant in, not caring that his clothes were getting soaked, drinking in the scent of the skinny omega in his arms. Their kiss was searingly hot, all lips, mouth and clattering teeth, and Harry found himself getting more heated as the seconds passed.
Draco was nervous, but he still explained everything to Harry. He would have a job, a good money, and would be able to work at home. It was more than perfect. It was everything he'd ever wanted.
have babies, but it is so, so rare, and people don’t expect it.... And you have waist-long hair... And you’re petite, you have very fine features. You wear feminine style clothes sometimes, like that green top. But that’s you, and I’ve always loved you just as you are. From our very first meeting when we met again, you’ve been my everything. And... I’m not sure what else to say. You’ve never been any different. You shouldn’t feel bad for being yourself”
“The worm will have your eyebrows, and your eyes... Also, they can have your height, I'd like them to be tall... Maybe they'll have your hands, and your bum... But I hope they have my knees, Merlin forbid they have yours. Also, they must have my hair and my nose. They can have any of our mouths. They are pretty good, I think...”
He’d ask him after their afternoon meeting...
“Fuck, Harry... I want it all, please, I want every single thing you said... I'll never again want to be empty, I'll want you to fill me up every day... Please... Give me all that you promised, let's... Let's celebrate our happiness today...”
Brimful of lust, Harry looked down at his wonderfully sexy little omega. Draco looked magnificent like this, like he’d been designed entirely to Harry’s liking. He was mindful of the trust that Draco had put in him though, and he was determined that this should be a pleasurable experience for both of them, with no regrets on either side.
At the moment, anyways, she felt like a girl. And she really wanted to tell Pansy, although she didn't know what her friend would say.
Picking up his phone once he quickly typed out another message.
He let his arms loose, breathing in and still scenting the horrible aftershave.
boss.
She left the bathroom teary eyed and with a red nose, head down and guilt all over her face.
Harry looped his arm around his wife as they strolled over the sunny cobblestones. It felt wonderful to be away from the pressures of England and the expectations that they whole world often seemed to hold him to.
Draco stopped, crossing his arms over his chest and rising an eyebrow to look at Harry.
He lathered the Vaseline onto his scalding hot cock, and gave it a few rough strokes to cover it completely.
Draco had his eyes glued to Harry. They wandered to his hair, and his face, strong jaw and beautiful lips. To his neck, to his chest, and his stomach. Draco wanted to lick him all over.
Harry realised immediately that Draco wasn’t going to order, and narrowed his eyes. When was Draco going to realise that he just wasn’t that sort of Alpha? If Draco wanted to order omelettes and broccoli then he ought to just do so. Harry ordered the all-day breakfast, and then quietened his voice to let Draco make his order after he was finished.  No doubt Draco would have words with him about that, but Harry didn’t care. He wanted Draco to know he was valued as man, not just as an omega.
“Warn me, would you?” Draco complained with a hoarse voice, his cheeks burning with pleasure and embarrassment. “You want... You want... From there? But... But... Does it feel good? I mean... Harry! This is not meant for sex!”
at that moment. It was heaven right now.
It was as hot as when they arrived, but, different from where they lived, everything was just so... Spacious. The roads were incredibly large, all covered in cobblestones, with many trees on the pavement - yes,
little knickers.
Cupping Draco’s jaw, Harry moved in delicately for a kiss. He knew Draco felt poorly so he wasn’t going to push, but Merlin! He could never resist those soft, silky lips.
Harry leaned over and pulled Draco onto a kiss. He tasted delicious, sweet and sexy and oh, so beautiful. Draco has the softest skin and his blond hair seems to glow. Maybe that was being in love, Harry though.
It took a while, but Draco was feeling much more confident after a week has passed from the park episode. At each day, though, that bugging thought kept creeping around her head, and, one night, she just couldn’t stop her mouth from saying it out loud.
“Of course I would forgive you, except you’ve not done
The trip back to the hotel felt like subtle torture for Harry. There was a definite energy between the two of them, a tension that hadn’t been there before. Harry felt excited, his stomach tied in knots, his heart racing.
It was a completely different feeling from when Jasmine fed on her. It was like Harry was putting her body on fire as he touched her nipple with her tongue and teeth and lips.
“He hid me my entire life under a cover. I won't allow him to do that with my baby,” Draco murmured still, looking at Harry. “And I hope her eyes turn green, and her hair is just like yours and her nose is freckled just like yours. I want her to be a little Potter through and through. When I gave up my Malfoy name, it was for good. I don't want any of that in her life. And not in the life of any other kid that we might have in the future.”
And a pure virgin, who didn’t even masturbate? Was Harry taking advantage by going to Draco? He had to be a
“The office is lovely, thank you,” Harry muttered, “I’m just settling into the new role... It’s very different, having a client-centred job. A lot to get used to.”
“So... Our marriage is in three months. I think I have found the perfect place for our ceremony,” Draco started, turning a little to look directly to Harry. They were on the sofa, because they couldn't bother eating properly at the table.”Also... Do you know someone who could cast the bonding spell on us? It must be a very important person. And you know a lot of important people.”
It wasn’t time to push Draco now, though. The man was obviously exhausted. Harry was a little disappointed. He had hoped to spend their evening together.
, Harry. I want to be yours forever. It would break my heart if I weren't."
Harry shifted his body under the quilt. Draco was warming up beautifully now, his body silky smooth and soft under his touch. He stroked Draco’s nipples between his fingers, enjoying the easy touch of the sexy omega in his hands.
“Quick, Potter. I know you can come in two minutes, but I want to come too,” he teased.
Perhaps you are waiting for Zabini to make an honest man of you? The two of you were very close when we broke it off. I imagined that wedding bells were imminent.
“Fuck, Harry...” she whispered back, spreading her legs to give him more space, her thighs trembling with desire. Her fingers felt a little damp with his precome, and she wanted to taste it, and suddenly she felt empty. So, so empty...
The bar wasn’t busy, but there was a pleasant buzz around the place. A pianist played soft melodies in the corner, and several couples sat, like them, drinking cocktails and talking.
“When they get bigger,” she said, touching her own breasts “and even fuller of milk, I want you to drink from them. I want you to squeeze them until they leak in your hands. Fuck, I wish you could do it now...”
His first orgasm did wonders to his body, and he already was leaking again around Harry's digits. He knew he could take more.
“No,” said Harry, leaning over to give Draco a long sweet kiss, “I can’t let go either... The laws in this country are fucked. And most people don’t agree with them. Our laws are changing, though I know it’s slow. And don’t talk such utter,
To be honest, Harry couldn’t even tell whether Draco was asleep. Perhaps he was, for he seemed entirely relaxed. Not worrying about clothes, Harry places Draco in the bed, and curled in beside him. After all, his omega had given him permission to stay -
Draco felt relief when Harry didn't disagree with him about his decision to be at the party until the ending, but as the night went on, he felt even more nervous. Harry was obviously excited about their night together, and as his friends and family said their goodbyes, Draco felt like being sick. He couldn't just do it. But he couldn't just
Granted, his hymen was still there, his cunt untouched, but after that experience, he knew he was changed forever. He couldn't wait anymore. He wanted it
“Draco, you’re so, so fucking hot... And yes, I want to fuck you... So much.  But I can’t run the risk of hurting our baby... Having that on my head. We can’t risk it, love... I’ll take you to our bed, and lick your cunt until you’re coming but I don’t think I want us to shag... I’m sorry.”
Before he could even think about what was happening, he was coming in Harry's mouth, his stomach contracting and his holes twitching from pleasure. His cunt was leaking his transparent slick, making his arsehole wet with pleasure and saliva from Harry's mouth.
“Auror Potter, we realize this is unconventional, but the patient is distraught, and we cannot calm him. He keeps insisting on only speaking to you. He won’t let anyone else near him and has had to be physically restrained from attacking our staff.”
Draco buried his face in Harry’s shoulder. “More like a secret Harry kink,” he confessed, laughing.
"I wish we could just be, you know? Sit in a place with a bottle of fizzy drink and just talk. No fancy dinners or long walks," Draco said, and then looked at Harry, a bit hurt. "Don't do that again, please. What you did with the waiter. I know what you're trying to do and I appreciate your feeling, but it makes me look like a reactionary omega, which I am not, and do not wish to be. This place is way too expensive and all the people here have ways to tell my family what's happening with me. Trust me on this one, love. You don't know how terribly cruel my world can be."
He took a bite of his sandwich, and chewed thoughtfully, wanting to move the power back over to Draco. Finishing his mouthful, he looked Draco in the eye.
She almost screamed in pleasure, her tight channel convulsing around his cock, her breasts leaking and her eyes turning in her head.
With a last pinch, Draco's hands left Harry's body and helped him with the job of taking his shirt off. Soon he was naked except for his navy blue knickers. He got away from Harry and took off his last piece of clothing before sitting in the sofa.
do you part. It’s more than a marriage, this bond. But then, of course I’d still like to marry you.”
There were two problems in being an Omega. The first problem was: he had to constantly prove he was worth being who he was, being in the position he was. He had to prove he didn't need to have a family, and lots of other omegas loved his imagine because it empowered them.
. She was holding Lyra in her arms as Harry stood next to her in a green field.
, communicating his needs honestly and openly.
“Isn't a burger something cheap? Why are we going to a King to eat it? Harry, I'm not dressed to meet a king! I'm sure I can eat this whole whopper thing, but not while dressed on your tee shirts! It looks like a dress on me! Find me a restroom so I can at least change!”
He walked to the settee, where Harry was waiting for him, straddled his alpha's lap and hid his face on his neck, letting his tears fall and his sobs out. He hugged him like he was the only thing that could save him, and cried, cried and cried.
Merlin! Of course, Harry wasn’t Draco’s actual alpha. He didn’t think he’d ever have his own omega again, and he momentarily felt sad.
“Don’t feel pressured to sleep with me love,” Harry whispered into the dark of their bedroom. “But I do miss holding you close on these, and feeling you soft silky skin next to mine”
“Oh yes... I like this a lot... I could get very used to this”.
Draco was so fucked.
Time had passed and Harry had been so consumed by his conversation with Draco that they’d arrived at the Ollivander offices without his noticing.
Harry’s week was as busy as any he could remember. His love affair with Draco had meant his work had gone on the back burner, which was never a good look when you’re only a few weeks into a new job. He knew it was vitally important to support his clientele, so he locked himself in the office, catching up on everything that had slipped past his notice. Harry soon felt happier and more confident.
Harry felt true happiness; felt the overwhelming joy of having his family - his
“Ahh... fuck, yes...” Harry groaned. He was exhausted, sated and thoroughly debauched. Harry hadn’t expected to get quite as intimate with Draco during their bath, but he wasn’t complaining.
? Do you know what happens to a person without a name? All my money, all my bank accounts would come back to my family... The money I worked so hard to have. My house, would come back to them. I'd be homeless, unemployed, extremely poor... And do you know what happens with pretty little male omegas on the streets? I bet you don't know. We're toys, Harry. A cock and a cunt. We can please anyone. So they grab us on the streets, cut off our bond glands and use our bodies until we're no longer of use."
She came too fast. Before she could even warn him, her body arched one more time, her eyes rolling back, thick liquid wetting Harry's fingers more and more. Her hand's movements got erratic, but she didn't stop. She didn't think she
Harry loved how slick and wet Draco always got when he came, how reactive his husband’s body was to pleasure.
If Draco was in any other situation, maybe at the beginning of this one morning, he would be ashamed. But as it was, his cock out and his body covered in Harry's come, he was pretty much free of anything that could hold him back at that time.
Draco.
“Okay, love”, he rasped, the excitement in his voice obvious. “I’m going to move now... Tell me if it hurts or you want to stop...”
"I'll make sure they'll suffer living hell," she said, and he smiled a little.
"I'd love to have tons of babies with you... Immediately!" Draco smiled, hugging Harry by his neck. "I'm sure we'd be amazing parents. I'd have a lot of love to give and you... You'd know how to properly raise them. All I know is to hire nannies and hand money whenever they need. And yes... I might call her, but for now... I really just want to settle down a little. Breathe. Take my stuff out of those suitcases and dress comfortably. I'll think of the rest when I make this house my home."
It was all there, all the smiles, and kisses, and the way Harry hugged him for dear life. The pictures were lovely and their love was so obvious, Draco would be happy to see them if they weren't his death sentence.
Manoeuvring his swollen, ready cock into place, Harry got ready to push against that gorgeous hole that was so ready to take him.
Harry bit his lip, focussed entirely on the sweet little arsehole in front of him. His fingers were thick, and wide, so he wandlessly summoned the lube. Slicking up his finger, he cautiously rubbed the beautifully soft little hole, entering just a fingertip.
Harry stood, and looked down at Draco. “There’s nothing more that I’d like than to take you home with me. I’d like to sweep you up into my arms, kiss you like you deserve. But you’ll never let me.”
"I like novel rubbish, Potter. It makes me feel like someday I might have a charming prince on a white horse come to save me from my high castle. Do you like horses, by any means?" Draco asked, jokingly, sipping his wine. Draco drank because he was used to it, but he preferred sweet wines. He'd never admit it, though. How peasant.
The dates were simple: lunch with friends, cafe breakfasts, museums. They all looked so innocent...Their chaste handholding and tiny kisses reserved for a viewing world who speculated on their every breath and word.
“...I just want to touch you everywhere... Kiss you all over... Tell me where to kiss you next...”
She breathed in his scent, and although he was too warm and the weather didn't help - thank Merlin for the white box that made their room cold. Harry smelt like home and love. She could just be there with him forever.
a dog close to me. Isn't it going to eat us? Eat Jasmine?”
He didn’t think that Draco, in his currently anxious state had noticed, but it did feel very strange with the omega under his roof.
Harry broke off his sentence with a sigh. “I don’t know, Draco... Can we do this? Lovers and business associates? Every time I get close to someone, I feel like I get burned. Everything you said earlier... I can’t imagine you giving up the business or your families respect for the likes of me. And that’s
Draco sent it, feeling bad. Oh, good. Now he had sent sexy pictures to a stranger that wouldn't even reply to him. He shouldn't have let his omega speak so loud. And now he was reaching a peak on his unwanted heat, which made him emotionally needy. Fuck. Fuck, fuck.
He’d decided to grow a beard at his wife’s insistence (and he’d  got a little tired of her pointing out every piece of facial hair ever printed in the bloody Quibbler) and as Harry kisses her, he made sure to tease her terribly by rubbing his chin all over her cheeks.
It was a nice affair, much bigger and noisier than on Draco's mother's household. He asked Pansy and Blaise to come for a tea afternoon, and as they sipped on their Earl Grey, he told them casually.
“I can't wait for it, Harry. Not only the wedding night, but the wedding itself. You made me come just to think about it. I'll try to sleep now. I have to have my beauty sleep. I love you.”
Draco was smiling so widely he could feel his cheeks hurting. He was about to answer when his house's bell sounded. He jumped out of the chair, practically running to the door, not really remembering the simple clothes he was wearing. At night, they didn't show much, but on the bright day, his tee was almost see-through as it loosely hugged his body, almost covering his shorts completely.
, I wasn’t quite feeling like a woman I was so used to be… And it keeps coming back. I… Can’t keep it to myself anymore.”
alpha that had ever lived but Harry wasn’t sure he cared. Draco was here, under his roof and wearing his mark. It was his every dream come true and he didn’t think that he could be any happier than he was there and then. Behind him the kettle boiled and he poured out two coffees.
“Do you want me to fuck you again Draco? I can take you where you’re sat. I’ll do all the work... You just need to open your legs just a little bit wider...”
He shifted his body, annoyed with himself for his constant inability not to be an utter prat. He was glad it was dark; he didn’t like the idea of Draco seeing how red with annoyance that last comment had made him.
Harry gasped with pleasure at Draco’s beautiful reaction. He ground his cock into his lover deeply, enjoying the heat and the soft, plush skin of Draco’s round arse. Harry knew it wouldn’t be long before he came; Draco just had that effect on him.
Draco smiled, sated, snuggling closer to Harry's chest. His smell was amazing. It was weird, because they've known each other for a couple of days only, and Draco already felt at home.  Smelling him around his bedroom gave him peace, made him happy.
Harry held up his hands in a sign of defeat, the picked up the rest of his belongings.
Okay, you wanted coffee. I can do that. Please, sit down.”
“But I miss us... I miss to be always near you. I miss work, and I miss the fields, and the cheer of the crowd. I miss lots of things we did together and now we... Well, we do
Harry didn’t think his show had been that sexy, but with Draco fellating him so beautifully he was hardly likely to complain.
Draco licked his lips, looking at his husband's body. He couldn't help but feeling hot and desiring him.
turn into a dog! A big shaggy thing, far bigger than you! He could turn into a dog
“I’m not going to let you get cold. Although you’re so bloody cheeky I’m not sure you deserve it. Quidditch star indeed. Perhaps in a different universe. A universe where you don’t have to catch the Snitch.”
Harry looked up at Draco’s open, smiling face, and felt a twist of love in his throat. His omega really was a beautiful man, and even more so when he was relaxed and happy, both of which he’d seen so very rarely. Harry drained the final dregs of his coffee, and leant back in his chair, considering Draco’s words. They certainly tied in with the reading he’d been doing online about alpha and omega history.
he’d found the puppy that would suit their family perfectly.
"I'm sorry how I reacted in the end of the night. I didn't want to make you feel bad for being respectful. But how would you feel if you didn't make
The desperate need to knot, the need to fill Draco beyond his wildest imaginings and an insane need to pulse his seed into the omega and make a
They finished their breakfast at a leisurely pace, and Harry didn’t think he’d ever
“I know what it looks like... The lateness, sore breasts. Feeling sick... But I don’t want you to get your hopes up.”
He gave into the kiss, Harry's big, hot hands making him shiver. He touched his husband's tongue with his, putting a little more strength on his legs so he could use his hands to finish opening his robes.
“Come here already. I'm sleepy and I need you to clean me up. You made a mess out of me, Potter.” Draco smiled as he said those words, feeling a slight pull on his lower belly.
“Oh Draco,” smiled Harry. “I’d be honoured to call you my boyfriend. If that’s what you’d like. You’re growing to be very important to me... But we should keep things quiet at work. I’m not having Nott harass you, or make you feel bad about your choices. It wouldn’t do for you to be the subject of gossip.”
She just didn't know it would happen so soon.
"Nonsense! You need a strong, wealthy alpha, from a good and respectable family. We've waited too long for you to make the right choice, Draco. Now it's time we do it for you."
. And sometimes I want to be both. It's been on and off over the years, the need to be a boy, but for now... I only want you to call me that. I don't actually feel like a boy. But I don't think I can
Harry’s body was shuddering with desire and need as he moved slowly within his wife; his body covered with a sheen of sweat and he could feel his own erect nipples bounce off Draco’s own.
Life with Draco was better than he ever could have imagined. Harry had made good on his promise, and never once let Draco feel cold or alone at night. Every evening, he’d wrap his powerful arms around his lover, pulling him close and holding him till they both slept.
Harry opened his mouth, and took the chocolate into his mouth with a soft suction. The chocolate tasted rich and bitter, and he seized Draco’s mouth in his own, kissing him roughly and passionately. He pushed his tongue into his omega’s mouth, and explored, enjoying the warmth and the soft, wet embrace of the other man.
Every date they went, every time that they were together, Draco felt complete. Of course he didn't stop messing with Harry whenever he could just for the laugh of it, but he liked that Harry teased him back. It was just amazing.
"I guess I can make an exception for you, alpha," his smile got bigger. “But now... Please, just hold me tight...”
…" Draco mumbled, his eyes shining. "But I have to ask for me, too... After I have my dessert, I need you to eat me out until I pass out. Can you do it for me, please, alpha?"
"Fuck, Alpha... I missed you so much... I felt so lonely without you..." Draco whispered against his mouth, giving him small kisses between phrases. "Thank you... I'd like to have that talk... But not now... let's talk after, in my house... After you give me the orgasm of my life... Then we'll talk..."
“I love how hard you are for me Draco... So good for me.”
stop.
Harry loved to please Draco. While his taste ran to the more simple things in life, nothing pleased him more that getting Draco smiling. Of course, he could imagine all the fancy clothes and flowers Draco would think absolutely necessary, but he’s put up with anything to make this man a permanent part of his life.
Luckily, Harry’s Quidditch training had kicked in, and he’d got between Draco and the slippery floor. Holding on to his husband tightly, Harry couldn’t help laughing at their wonderful wedding night. Only seconds before, the feeling of his husbands sweet wet cunt hugging his fingers as they’d orgasmed together had made every previous sexual experience seem tame, every previous moment just a preview before he could get his mouth round Draco’s cock once more.
Harry held onto Draco tightly, kissing him wherever he could reach. He pressed his and his darling’s heads together, their breath mixing and their lips touching as their bodies moved sinuously together.
Draco widened his eyes, but then he smiled immediately after. Dear God, how he loved Harry. He'd known it for a while now, but it always made him feel butterflies in his stomach.
His voice was hoarse, rough and so sexy, she didn't think she could avoid the shock of pleasure through her.
“Of course I could handle you for eternity, Draco. I wouldn’t mind you soggy, and old. You’ll never be ugly though, that’s an absolute physical impossibility. We’ll be soggy and old together, sitting together like those alpha/omega couples you see sat at the back of the bus. We’ll be an embarrassment to our grandchildren,” Harry giggled at the fantasy.
“You know, you’re still the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life... And I’ll make you come if that’s what you want... But I know you, and if I did fuck you, the voices would start to whisper in your head, and you’d be heartbroken and guilty tomorrow... You know I love and want you, darling. Let’s enjoy our day and have make some wonderful memories.”
"We have to finish our negotiations in the factory, unfortunately, as I don't want to come here in the near future," Draco said, putting a stray strand of hair behind his ear. "But I think we can stop by somewhere after we come back to London, somewhere you think people might not notice us..."
Harry freed his cock from his trousers, and slowly rolled the foreskin over the red, leaking head. The idea that Draco was wet, his slick pooling in his hole was a massive turn on for Harry. He thought about how he’d love to lick it off, rimming Draco deeply and thoroughly.
Draco blinked at the unexpected message, but it wasn't a bad feeling. He replied fast:
He pressed his nails over Harry's chest, leaving his mark over his lover's body. He found a nipple with his mouth and did what he liked when Harry did to himself. He bit it, sucked on it, as he pressed the other with his thumb and forefinger, all the time as his wet, hot cunt pressed over Harry's cock on a lazy motion. Draco knew he was wetting Harry's pants with his slick and... He didn't fucking care.
He got closer to Harry, and set the plate aside before taking off his boxers, finally letting his beautiful, huge cock breathe. He picked up the plate again and started to smear chocolate all over Harry. On his neck, his nipples, the middle of his abs, a line down and around his cock. Draco then broke a bit of the tart and put it on Harry's mouth.
Harry had literally no idea if it was going to be fine or not. Most of his travels had been with the team, and they sorted out every detail.
Draco kissed Harry tenderly on his lips, touching their noses together.
Harry has been pacing up and down his lounge. He hadn’t known where to put himself and his mind was frayed with worry. When he heard the knock on his door he flew to open it.
“Look. I love you, you always drive me crazy. If the aftershave is so bloody disgusting, into the bin it shall go... But I’m not going to this thing tonight without you, so I’m sending an owl with our apologies. If you want to stew in your annoyance all night that’s fine, love. But I’m going to a bath now, and you’re very welcome to join me.”
Harry’s teeth sank into Draco’s pulse point, and every cell in his alpha body felt like it was going to simultaneously explode and erupt.
Draco let himself be guided by Harry. He felt safe and calm again, although his brain was still chaos. It wasn't easy, despite that he knew it was the right path to go. His destiny was with Harry, his whole happiness depended on being here, and it was his
Harry lounged back in his seat. This was more luxury than he was used to, and he intended to enjoy it.
“Are you okay, sweetheart? You went down fast there, baby, gave me a bit of a shock. I think we should retire to bed, start the rest of our lives in tomorrow. You’ve made me the happiest man in existence today... Come to bed with me darling, I want to hold you close all night”.
Pulling out his finger, Harry gave Draco’s arse a playful little slap. Lining up his heavy cock, he couldn’t help but enter his husband in one quick movement, a heavy groan escaping his mouth.
The following morning arrived, the grey dawn sliding in through the slats of the blinds. For a moment Harry couldn’t quite place the relaxed feeling of bliss that rolled through his body, but he soon realised. It was the lovely omega that was still slumbering beside him. Draco must have been far more tired than Harry had imagined because he was still wrapped up in the sheets, his blond hair a halo around him. Harry smiled. He didn’t think that his life could get much better than this.
His thoughts were interrupted by Theodore Nott, though, another alpha. He raised his chin, looking at Harry with a frown. Draco thought he was handsome, in a cleaner and slim way than Harry, but he didn't have the raw power Potter had.
Harry around, his energy touching Draco's, like it was supposed to be.
Draco rested his wand aside, opening up again.
“But I’m starting to realise something about you Draco. You always know better, don’t you? Know better than
He got lost. He closed his eyes, letting his body just
“You can... You can use your fingers... You can put your fingers there by now... But I want your cock in my cunt... I want your come inside me and you fucking me deep in my cunt while you finger me from behind... Please... “
Idly, Harry smiled. Stroking Draco’s hair, and looking down at him, he wondered how he’d got so lucky. Unable to resist, he kissed him chastely on the forehead. He knew there was something he wanted to say, but he couldn’t know how Draco would react.
“Harry... I want your mouth... I want you to eat me up... Please... “
- but
“How bloody sexy are you.... That wet little mouth, so clever for me.”
When Harry suggested their honeymoon location, Draco spent a lot of time researching the most beautiful places to be. That hotel was one of them and he was proud of it.
. Maybe... Maybe I'd like you to touch me above my navel too. It's only three months. We... I guess, we can play before it, can't we?”
Draco's mouth hanged open, and he didn't know what to say. He felt his eyes water, and he tried to swallow his tears. Fuck, what was happening to him?
"I understand, Harry. It will be better for both of us, indeed," he took the phone out his ear so he could wipe the tears from his face. He put it close to his ear again. "I'll just tell her I am your friend and I liked by mistake."
The water dripped down his hair that clang to his back. He looked up to Harry's eyed and hugged him by his shoulders, tiptoeing so he could kiss Harry on the mouth. He was so turned on that maybe... Maybe if Harry offered, he wouldn't deny him. He would just give in. Even if he was embarrassed. He wanted Harry too much, just too much.
“And I miss us, too. All the things we used to do... But we’re here now, and I think we should make the most of our night. Would you like another one of those, or shall we head off towards home?”
“Harry... I'm late. I'm almost three weeks late. I haven't even noticed... How come I haven't noticed...?!” he moved his eyes to Harry and they were teary, his nose turning red and his whole body trembling. “Harry, I'm three weeks late. I'm
“I think it's boring. I'd rather watch the ice skating,” she snuggled to Harry's side. She wasn't confident to ask for sex, but she wanted his comfort and his kisses. When he complimented her, she felt her cheeks burn, but also felt that he was just saying that to make her feel better. She couldn't be beautiful like she was now. Just... Not possible.
“You are pissing me off, Potter, and if no one else is going to say it, then I will! I’ve known Draco since we were children, and he comes from a good, old-blood, traditional family. They don’t need your modern,
Harry could feel Draco’s soft wet flesh, feel him shiver on his lap. Using Draco’s bony hips, Harry easily manoeuvred him around so that they faced each other. His body was thrumming with energy and want, his body as responsive as it always was to Draco.
He was wearing heels, since he was small even for an omega, and he did want to impose a little bit more. A
-x-x-
He got even closer to Harry, letting his tee fall down on the floor, and reaching for one of Harry's hands. Slowly, his own hand trembling nervously, he put Harry big, callous hand over one of his breasts. The contact was hot, new, incredibly alien and delicious. Draco slightly closed his eyes, a pleasured sigh coming out of his mouth.
Harry didn’t want to move. Having Draco underneath him, ripe little breasts under his hands, gorgeous mouth meeting his, it was just too wonderful. He respected his mother-in-law well enough, but he only had eyes for Draco today.
He pulled Draco to him, cradling his hot, tearful face in the crook of his neck. He couldn’t believe that this man who he loved more than the world would put himself down like that.
"I don't have a family, Harry. I have owners. And they'll either sell me to someone equally wealthy or throw me in the trash. There's no in between. There's no choice. Unless you want a poor, useless omega living on your sofa for the rest of your life. Because that's the only option for me, if I ever say no to my parents. Would you be willing to do so?'
Nott was a constant thorn in his side of course: unlike the other man, Harry hadn’t fired him when he took the CEO post. A better punishment was keeping him inside the business, and getting him to deal with some of the more acerbic clientele... Harry smiled.
Hello, dearies! Thank you so much for the reception! Me and LY are so happy that you are enjoying our story as much as we enjoyed writing it! This chapter is the one that is going to lead us to the end. Our story is almost finished, and we have about 4 chapters left. So I hope you all enjoy this slightly angsty ride!
They bathed their tiny baby, who quite liked the warmth of the bath tub, and put her in the slytherin green baby gro that Pansy had thought was both hilarious and incredibly sweet. It was time for Draco to try to feed her to sleep, and Harry hoped she’d be successful. He couldn’t bear to think how upset with herself she’d get were she to fail her own ridiculously high standards.
It was Mr. Ollivander.
Draco sipped his coffee once again.
The days turned into months, and Harry barely got any time away from the Quidditch ground.
"I'm happy you came to your senses, Father," Draco had said, and he didn't ignore his mother's hand on his father's arm, as if she was the one making him go there. An omega's power, silent but final. "But I have a good job at Ollivanders' now. And I'm also pregnant. I'm not coming back to my old routine. Harry, on the other hand, is perfectly capable of running the business. And it would be kept within the family, as it should be."
"I'll be here for whatever you need," she said, kissing him on his cheek.
- exactly where he belonged.
But one of the most attractive parts of Draco was his traditional nature that guided his actions. It was so exciting to Harry that Draco was pure, virginal and had waited for his love. He wanted to make everything incredibly special, and knew that their wedding would only be the first step in a full and wonderful life together.
Harry was only slightly aware of what Draco was saying to him. His whole body felt as if it were trapped in a haze, as if he’d regressed to a more primal state. This happened, he knew, with alphas who’d met omegas with whom they had a powerful bond. His prick was hard and pulsing, his knot sizeable. He knew, bone-deep that he wanted his omega to ride his cock. He wanted to bathe in his scent for the rest of his life.
Harry’s weekend was nearly as bad as he’d imagined. The party been wonderful, but he’d been left with the nagging feeling of everything he missed in his life. His parents had died not long after he was born, and he had grown up with relations that felt any other alpha was a deliberate challenge to their own son. Family was massively important to Harry, and the idea that Lyra was growing up without him seemed absurd.
Draco in his blood and his heart. He could feel the thrum of Draco’s blood in his veins and the love, the adoration, that crackled between them. There had never been a moment like it, and Harry knew there never would be again.
“I don't really know... It was mostly sex talk, if I'm being honest... I like the way we both get when we get on like this, with this type of words, but... I'm not on any contraceptives and I don't plan on taking potions or wearing muggle rubbers. If it happens, it happens. I don't mind. Do you?”
Life was amazing, even though Draco missed his family fiercely. They weren't the best parents in the world, but Draco loved them and it was hard to think they wouldn't talk to him anymore.
Lyra has fallen into an uneasy sleep on the settee. He decided to leave her there for a little while, and take her to bed in a bit. He tried to read but the words swam around the page. Every one of his thoughts was with his omega lover, and he only wished he knew what happening.
Harry pulled Draco’s hand down onto the front of his shorts, his massive, solid cock both obvious and ready for sex.
He curled around himself as soon as he lay on the bed. his shoes on the side of it. He waited for Harry, looking at him with round, big, grey eyes.
“Hello darling,” he moaned, his legs stood apart and his broad, muscular chest all soaked from the cool water of the shower. He knew he was giving Draco the show of her life, but he didn’t care. He was thrilled to be an exhibitionist.
Draco giggled a little, looking at Harry deep into his eyes.
Draco had little time to catch his breath before Harry was coming in his mouth. He could feel his cock pulsing under his fingers, the hot liquid filling his mouth.
In the end, Draco did neither. He darted out a hand and grabbed hold of the boxers, enveloping them in his fist. He used his other hand to stroke his prick even faster. Fuck, but that felt nice. Draco’s prick was hard as diamonds and was very soon smeared in slick precome. He was so turned on that he thought he’d vibrate out of his skin.
He took off his top, sighing with the feeling of having his breasts free at least, but being a little upset with the sensitivity of them. He put on one of Harry's team tees, that they had received from one of their sponsors, and it was big enough to reach his mid-thigh. Draco then marched to the kitchen to have some toast with honey, and after he assembled his toasts practically swimming on honey, he looked at the pickles bottle.
“Okay, I’ll go,” muttered Harry quietly, quite aware that it wasn’t really his partner talking, but more likely a toxic mix of pregnancy hormones and culture shock at the very different world they’d found themselves in.
Harry growled his desire at Draco’s words, flipping the smaller omega over onto his front, exposing his luscious white bubble arse. Bearing his teeth, he bit lightly, enjoying the soft flesh between his teeth, restraining himself so he didn’t leave a mark.
He was afraid she could smell his lies.
“Draco!” Harry hissed, aghast. “You’re not supposed to eat soft cheese! If you’re desperate for cheese then you can have some cheddar when we get home!”
-- The end
But he wouldn't dwell on things he knew he couldn't have. He would feel what he had now, and it was Harry all to himself, all
Harry told the unpleasant man simply to
“Of course. I don't really want to come back home and be alone.”
