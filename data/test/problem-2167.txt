Harry shakes his head. "I just...I don't even know, I lost so much and I don't know what I did to deserve all that," he says. "I don't know if I can do this anymore"
“I don’t even know why I'm crying, it must be the hormones," he wipes his eyes. “Anyway,” he starts. “I have an appointment at the hospital to do an ultrasound, do you want to come?”
They sit in silence for a while, each not knowing what to say or do now and being to scared to question it out loud
“And she’s right!” Potter exclaims. “How dare you!” he yells, dark face becoming red with anger. “If you are going to be a wimp and can’t face up to the responsibilities of becoming a father you should have been more careful in the first place”
Draco starts the day by making a huge breakfast, his stomach growling and rumbling as the smell of pancakes fills the air. He plops a few stacks of pancakes on his plate and drowns them in maple syrup before placing a few strawberries over it. Rubbing his hands together, his mouth salivating at the sight of the pancakes, Draco cuts into the stack and takes a huge bite, practically moaning at the taste which overcomes his mouth.
His stomach rumbling and growling with hunger makes Draco sigh. Stumbling to a stand, he makes his way towards the kitchen and opens the fridge only to find it half empty. He opens the cabinets to find nothing also.
“Huh?” Pansy questions. “What does that have to do with us hanging out--wait,” she cuts herself off. “--Did something happen, what happened?!”
As he’s nearly finished with his shopping, he grabs some milk but as he’s about to grab it, someone bumps into him making the milk slip out of his hand and fall to the floor.
Harry looks to Narcissa and sends a small shrug. Narcissa sighs. “Fine whatever, but what are you going to do since you can’t ever be treated there again” she questions
Ron grumbles nonsense under his breath and looks away. "Only because Harry seems to care about you for some reason"
“But clearly trying to forget is not helping if you have constant nightmares--i can tell as you have dark circles under your eyes. I talk about my nightmares and it helps”
"Look, I don't mind you anymore," Ron states. "And I wouldn't like for something to happen to you no matter how much you piss me off sometimes"
“Stupify!” Draco bellows, a flash of red magic lighting up the room and racing to hit the figure only for it to hit a white shield instead. Before Draco could conjure another spell, a familiar voice yells “Draco!”
Draco opens his mouth to retort but Narcissa holds a hand up. “Don’t protest, i won’t change my mind and we both know i will get my own way” she says
Dr Jones shuts the door behind her and gestures for Harry to take a seat. "So how have you been doing?"
“Stupid baby,” he grumbles glaring at his stomach and the baby bump which is showing. “I hate you, you know,” he slaps his stomach as if it would somehow make it disappear. “I hate you”
Harry sighs. "We spoke about it before and he was worried about talking to strangers and how they might leak his information, as well as how no one will want to help a death eater which is actually true--he got kicked out of St Mungo's for Melins sake after he tried to kill himself"
“Then this is your chance to slowly get back into the wizarding world, start by going to Hogwarts, if it doesn’t work out, you still have the muggle world”
Draco makes his way to bed, snuggling into the covers, burying his face deep into the fluffy pillow with a sigh.
Ron tilts his head. "I don't know how Harry managed to sleep with you constantly tossing and turning, though he's probably just as bad to be fair"
Narcissa holds Draco’s shoulders tighter and looks at him straight in the eyes, moving her head to force her son to look at her back in the eyes. Draco’s eyes are watery with tears and distant. “Draco, look at me,” she says firmly. “Everything will be alright, take deep breaths for me”
Deciding against the red jumper, he puts a green one instead and looks at himself over in the mirror once again. With a satisfied nod he smiles slightly. “Much better”
“Blanket hog?” Draco turns to him crossing his arms at the playful look in Harry’s now open eyes. “Well at least i don’t snore” he huffs
The healer scoffs. “Disgusting death eater” she mutters to herself making Draco’s heart stop for a moment. He shuts his eyes to soothe out the pain flaring through him inside and out. Of course, why did he expect people to think differently?
Harry glares at Ron. “It’s fine, it’s my turn to make it, and I don't need anyone's help,” he says before looking at Draco. “Go rest”
Draco drops the knife down on the counter with a sigh. “I couldn’t tell anyone,” he whispers. “I just wanted to forget that it ever happened”
Narcissa glares at her son. “Draco, this isn’t only about you, this child deserves to be with its family and I will use all my power to make sure it does”
"Merlin why?" Harry clenches his fist staring at nothing. Blinking back tears that threaten to fall, Harry jumps to a stand and bites his lip while pacing around the room. "I mean, is it too much to ask for something great"
“Ron did most of it, he’s really good at cooking when he wants to be” Hermione sends a small smile at Ron who grumbles nonsense in response taking a huge sip of his morning coffee. Hermione looks between Harry and Draco. “So how did you two sleep?”
Narcissa chuckles but then looks at her son and sees the dread in his eyes. She smiles at Potter and Weasley. “What about you both?” she doesn't answer properly
After a bit of rough silence, Narcissa looks at her son carefully. “So,” she starts. “What do you plan on doing?”
Draco blinks. “Oh,” he says, somewhat thankful. “By the way how did you know I was here?” he questions before all the colour from his face drains away. “Don’t tell me they published in the news what i did already”
“Nothing,” he starts but then sighs. “It’s just Potter and Weasley lost their baby, and...i don’t know, i kind of feel bad as they were really looking forward to the baby, and i’m here with mine and i don’t want it, i just feel bad”
“Very good,” she says approvingly, rolling her hips to chase the sensation of his thumb. “I’d quite like your cock, thanks for asking.”
Malfoy nuzzles Harry’s bared throat – because that’s what he’d instinctively done, thrown back his head and bared his neck to Malfoy – and asks, “Potter, do you-” he pauses to groan when Harry bucks up against his thigh. “Do you wish to be free?”
Hermione lies in place, breasts heaving against her own tie, legs spread wide for both of their viewing pleasure. Harry thinks he’s never seen anything like her, not even in his dreams. He thinks, for a second, that perhaps he should be doing something other than staring with a hand on his dick, but for now he’s perfectly happy watching.
She pushes lightly at his shoulders, and he lifts up enough to see her grinning at him. “You’ll need to kneel,” she advises. Harry pulls back, lets his cock slide out, sits back on his heels, and waits. His prick waves high between his legs, wet and red and so very hard. He watches as Hermione turns around and backs towards him, her knees outside his, her arse in his lap. She grabs hold of his cock and angles it up into her sweet cunt, then bounces in his lap. He wraps both arms around her and pushes up into each of her downward thrusts, lets her guide his right hand to where she needs it. It feels like they’re so much closer like this, his front pressed to her back, his fingers rubbing against her clit. She’s much, much more vocal in this position, hips squirming like he’s nudging something brilliant inside her on each stroke, and very quickly she’s coming on his cock, hips rolling and pitching wildly as it seems to wash over her in waves.
Harry whines at the reminder that Hermione’s arse has also been spread wide by this fantastic prick. At the reminder of what they’d got up to two nights ago. “It’s so much,” he whispers back, praying Draco doesn’t take that as a complaint.
Hermione moans out loud, and it sounds like they’re both about to get off without ever actually specifying what they’re thinking of.
All in all, it’s a good day, especially when Malfoy unearths Harry’s List of Fantasies to go over together. He sounds smug when he announces how much progress they’ve made, and Harry doesn’t bother to fight him on it.
Malfoy and Harry walk to class alone, as Ron had to run up for a quick shower. Even a good Scourgify would have left him rather sticky at this point. "Thanks," Harry says quietly. He hates to be grateful to Malfoy, but needs must. "For, you know, not saying anything about last night."
The glove is gone and Hermione’s hiked up her skirt, hand in her knickers as she watches them with heated eyes.
Malfoy gives him such a filthy look that Harry blushes. “Hmmm,” he hums, turning contemplative. “And where, exactly, would this further exploration take place?”
Malfoy’s reading voice is posh and refined and the perfect soundtrack for a cozy evening by the fire. Harry is hardly even listening to the words themselves, and he suspects Hermione is doing the same. She sends Harry a sweet smile and he smiles back peacefully. Tomorrow she will likely yell at Harry for not finishing his Transfigurations paper, but that’s tomorrow’s concern. Tonight, he gets peace, and Draco’s smooth voice washing over him, telling him things he mostly already knows.
Oh, that. “Yeah, definitely,” he gushes, thinking about it now and fisting his prick enthusiastically. His eyes squeeze shut briefly, and when he opens them, Hermione is dragging a pair of red pants down her legs and tossing them at Harry. He catches them – of course he does – and before he can come up with a reason not to, he holds them up to his nose and inhales the scent of her sex. He groans loudly, suddenly harder than he’s ever been, smelling the sticky panties of his best friend while she touches herself in his bed.
“Coralie Laurent,” he replies, voice softening on her name tellingly. “She’s all right, for a Hufflepuff.”
Harry shrugs, feeling embarrassed all over again. He hears the echo of Hermione telling Draco Malfoy to
When she and Harry sit together at meals – which is now only half of the time, because it appears they’d decided to split Harry 50/50 without even asking him – she smiles more, laughs more, and takes much greater pleasure in poking fun at Harry than ever before.
But it’s so, so good in the dark like this too. He tries to fuck up into their grip, but can hardly move with them holding him down.
Draco moans in the affirmative, eyes rolling back in his head, and Harry has no choice but to give him exactly what he’s asked for: a mouth full of come. Draco swallows round him, again and again, and then licks Harry’s prick clean for good measure. Harry doesn’t get up, not even when the sensation gets to be too much. Something about watching Malfoy lap at his nearly flaccid cock seems dirtier than Malfoy sucking him at full hardness, and Harry’s loathe to stop him.
It seems that that thought had not previously occurred to Ron. He looks bewildered. "Didn't really think about that." He rubs the back of his neck and looks down, thinking for a bit. "You can, you know,” he says when he looks up again. “Hit me, I mean. If you want."
He’s just shaking apart in Draco’s arms, Draco’s legs wrapped around him as they chase satisfaction together.
Gone is last night’s languid disrobing; his movements are jerky, sloppy. Harry watches, spooning up behind Hermione and wrapping his arms around her to unclasp her bra. She scoots back towards him, rubbing her improbably soft arse against his prick with a moan. Harry rolls his hips forward in response, instinctively holding her tighter as her back arches, loving the feel of those skimpy little knickers against his half-hard cock. Harry keeps an eye on Malfoy as he reveals more and more of his pretty pale skin, and keeps his hands on Hermione’s supple tits. Godric, Malfoy’s big cock looks delectable in those tight little pants. There’s a noticeable wet spot round the tip of Malfoy’s prick, and Harry thinks about putting his mouth just there, to taste and tease. To see what kinds of noises Malfoy will make when he’s at Harry’s mercy. The thought prompts a particularly vigorous thrust against Hermione’s arse.
Malfoy is, in fact, gathering up his things for a shower. Instead of hurrying off into the en-suite as usual, though, he begins undoing the cuffs of his shirt while standing right there in the room.
Harry slips halfway off Malfoy’s body, wedges himself against the wall so he can get access to the front of Malfoy’s trousers. He rests his head on Draco’s firm chest, one leg still tangled with Draco’s, and peers across the gap at his own bed. Hermione has drawn up the skirt of her dress, already has a hand in her black knickers.
, you’re perfect, fuck.” Harry clutches the obscenely, unrealistically hot blond in his lap and gasps for breath, feels his cock twitching in Draco’s arse.
But enough thoughts about sentient headgear. Harry’s finally got a hold of Draco’s prick, heavy in his hand and so very responsive to his touch. Draco is trying to sweet-talk Hermione into sharing her very private imaginings with them, and Harry is unsubtly rubbing his cock against Draco’s thigh. Life has turned out pretty great, regardless.
Zabini smirks. “It’s all right, Pans. We can understand the desire to cosy up to a war hero in the interest of bolstering one’s reputation, can’t we?”
Even Ron should be able to see that this would be a good time to stay quiet, but it seems he can’t help himself. “Well that’s just disgusting,” he spits.
Malfoy blinks down at him blearily, looking like he is about to collapse right on top of Harry. Harry prepares himself for it, maybe even welcomes it, and finds himself disappointed when Malfoy rallies and gracelessly clatters out of bed. “I’m still angry with you,” Malfoy informs him, words belied by his distinctly calm and satiated demeanor.
.” He’d been too angry, too lost, too afraid that Ron was right and that Harry really was leading them all on a path to destruction. He couldn’t have possibly made a move on a girl like Hermione in the midst of that, best friend or no. She’d deserved better. Besides, she’d had her heart set on Ron at the time, and Harry’d still been entertaining fantasies of coming home to Ginny. He’d been holding out for their happily ever after.
, Harry thinks, grinning, as they hastily put their things away and leave the library without saying a word to their study companions.
“I’ve been reliably informed that they are spell-compatible brands. It will take some learning how to use them, but they seem so much simpler than a several fire oven that needs to be managed and maintained by House Elf magic.” He passes Harry a photo of an elegant dining room much more befitting the Malfoy heir.
Harry hadn’t really thought of it that way, and from the look on Hermione’s face, she hadn’t either.
Professor Slughorn eyes the mess impatiently. Malfoy has happened to spill a somewhat volatile ingredient which would react unpredictably to being swept up with a spell. No, each bean will need to be picked up by hand, and their professor looks none too pleased about it. Everyone knows he has a standing appointment to get completely sloshed with Professor Flitwick and Madam Hooch once a week, on this particular day.
It quickly becomes clear that Hermione and Ron have truly worked out their issues, because they bicker good-naturedly for the entire walk to Defense Against the Dark Arts. Malfoy and Harry walk just behind them, and when Harry catches Malfoy’s less than subtle gaze and Hermione’s arse, he suddenly remembers the knickers in his pocket.
The week following their split had seen Hermione looking healthier, freer, and lighter than she’d been in years. Ron, in absolute denial, claimed that she was faking it. Harry couldn’t help but feel torn. He was of course loyal to Ron, but his other best friend hadn’t looked this happy and self-assured since that time in 5
From within their privacy bubble, Hermione and Ron both raise their goblets distractedly. This is one of the many reasons they’re Harry’s very best friends.
Harry turns his head to shoot Hermione a look, but she’s already perched on the edge of Malfoy’s desk, watching them with a glint in her eyes. Something about her heavy gaze makes Harry feel hot all over.
“You’re not sure it’s right to accept Potter’s love and still have the freedom you need to be happy.”
It's less normal that they're including Malfoy in the privacy bubble, but Ron can be flexible when he wants to be. "What I meant was: maybe I never wanted her back at all. I mean, you said it yourself: I'm hardly likely to get her back by insulting her. It seems a bit like I was sabotaging any opportunity for reconciliation, doesn’t it?"
? He needs Hermione, has relied upon her for years. And now, he's lost his virginity and potentially impregnated a girl, and he can't even talk to either of his best friends about it. Fuck.
Harry blinks a few times as he tries to return to the present. “My… what?” But as he says it, he realizes with growing anxiety that he knows exactly what Ron means.
Pleasure zings through him in response. He’s tense, feeling newly conscious of the numerous scars littering his body. But Hermione doesn’t flinch or hesitate, doesn’t shy away from them, and Harry can feel himself relax a little.
Harry responds in the affirmative, voice rough. He sounds hungry, even to his own ears, and Draco moves aside to make room for Harry. Harry leads with his tongue, trusts them to advise him as needed. He’s vaguely aware of Malfoy climbing off the bed to disrobe, but most of his focus is on the job before him. He licks up her slit, focusing on that slick button at the very top. She’s already so wet, and it tastes so incredible to him that Harry can’t help it- he moans his satisfaction right into her pussy.
“Good man, Harry!” Professor Slughorn replies cheerily, and is gone, the door slamming shut behind him.
They take an open spot near Hermione, Su Li, and Padma Patil, who are in the midst of a discussion far too intellectual for this time of morning, in Harry’s opinion. He doesn’t even attempt to parse it as he loads up his plate with what is left of the breakfast platters. When there is a lull, Hermione shoots Harry a very knowing look over her muffin. Harry smiles at her lazily, briefly dropping his eyes to gaze admiringly at the curve of her breasts in that flattering sweater. She smirks at him and turns to Su with a rebuttal.
He's right, of course. Hermione and Malfoy manage to flirt in utter silence throughout double Transfigurations, lunch and Herbology. Between the heavy looks, suggestive handling of dirt and quills and wands, and - Godric, he doesn't even want to think it -
She rolls her eyes. “Well, yes, I was aware, thanks. I just meant that it’s rather unlike you to go above and beyond the required reading.” She thinks for a moment, shrugs, and adds, “Not when no one’s trying to kill you, anyway.”
Right on time, Hermione walks in. She grins when she observes Malfoy standing there in just a tiny pair of dark green briefs. “Not interrupting anything, am I?”
Hermione gives it to him, nice and slow, and Draco takes it beautifully. He whines, squirms on her fingers, cock leaking and jerking where it lies untouched. Harry watches, riveted, can’t believe Draco.
Hermione seems to be enjoying herself immensely, eyes bright and engaged as she pushes three fingers in Draco’s arse and curls them. Draco cries out, fucking himself on them, his prick fat and leaking on his belly.
Harry ponders this contradiction all morning during classes, but even hours later the only thing he can say with any certainty is that he resents that bloody Concealment Charm.
“I see,” Blaise says, sounding rather impressed. Then he addresses Harry again. “Listen, Potter, we’re not asking to you betray any confidences. But give us something?”
Draco’s words have trailed into garbled noises, and Harry finds them particularly motivating. He fucks his tongue in and out of Draco’s wiggling arse, moans happily, and is distinctly satisfied when Draco comes explosively.
If Malfoy's fingers are enough to make Harry feel this way, he can only imagine what it'll be like to stretch his mouth wide around Malfoy's fat prick. Harry's dick spurts a little more come at the thought.
“No need,” he asserts, thrilled to brag just a bit. “I’m not much of a reconnaissance man, myself. Usually just like to dive in and figure it out as I go along.”
“Hmm,” Malfoy hums, kissing Harry’s mouth with plenty of tongue. Harry’s dick jerks at the knowledge that Malfoy is trying to taste himself, but he’s mostly spent. They snog lazily for quite some time, and then Malfoy climbs out of bed to get ready for Magical Theory.
“Yeah,” Harry sighs, thrusting his hips a bit. He hisses when Draco pulls his fingers out, feeling terribly empty.
“Oh my God, oh, you’re. My God!” Harry babbles as he pushes, inch by inch, inside Draco Malfoy’s arse. His hands snap to Draco’s hips, holding on, tugging him down. “My
“Oh, so sorry,” Malfoy says, and it’d be perfectly polite if his lips weren’t shining with the evidence of Hermione’s arousal. “Did you want some?”
The rest of the night is pretty much normal, although Harry does have a rather weird dream. It started as a re-telling of their adventures in the Greenhouse, only confusing and sinister and murky like only dreams can be. Draco had been leading Harry to the back of the Greenhouse, when the twists and turns of the aisles has become more and more elaborate. The foliage around had gotten taller and thicker until Harry realized, with a sinking feeling, that they had somehow entered a frighteningly familiar hedge maze. Harry had rushed to catch up, but Draco had turned a corner out of sight, and when Harry had tried to shout for him to come back, his voice would only come out a whisper.
Malfoy hastily cuts him off, cheeks flushed. "But you needn't commit to any of that now! Right now, I know you've no plans for after Hogwarts. And you likely have several options. But this is one." He gestures between them. "Just this. We can carry on doing exactly this, if you want. Because it's what I want."
“Didn’t exactly bring lube with me to classes today, Malfoy,” he gripes, kicking himself for his own lack of foresight.
“Ugh.” Having entirely forgotten about his earlier conversation with Ron, Harry grunts unhappily at the reminder. He's too satisfied to be really upset, but he doesn’t love being made to feel like having a chat with his best mate is some sort of crime. “He was going to find out sooner or later, Malfoy,” he offers mildly, watching Malfoy bend over to retrieve some fresh pants out of his trunk. Godric, he’s
Instead, he shushes Harry, runs a gentle, almost tickling hand up his thigh. He hardly touches Harry’s prick at all, ghosts over his balls, and stops to tap a finger at his hole. “Here?” Malfoy asks lowly. “Is this where you need me?”
Harry can’t help but give his prick a squeeze through his trousers, watching Hermione quiver and moan as she comes under Draco’s skilled mouth. She’s so- she’s like a piece of art, like something surreal he’d never begin to think he deserved. They’re both so bloody hot, Harry has no idea what he’s doing here, but he’s not about to leave any time soon.
Harry jolts awake sometime later with Malfoy standing over him. His Charms textbook is in his lap, there’s a crick in his neck, and for some reason, Malfoy looks almost... fond? Harry rubs his eyes because, clearly, he is not fully awake. But no matter how much he shakes himself, and even discreetly pinches himself, Malfoy still seems to be hiding a tiny smile for the duration of their walk down to the Great Hall.
When lunch rolls around, Harry has to make a quick stop in the nearest gents’ to relieve a bit of tension. Who knew the library was so full of erotic possibilities? It takes hardly two minutes for him to get off, especially when he discovers that Hermione has somehow managed to slip a pair of damp purple knickers into his trouser pocket without his notice.
She purses her lips and looks back at her book. “Well, Harry, when I’m pursuing a new line of study, I usually start by making a list of everything I’d like to learn and go from there.”
The Slytherins apparently deal in pointed silences and slight expressions of disgust. Harry rolls his eyes a little, but the truth is that he finds them far more amusing than annoying. “If you want to know about Hermione, you’ll have to ask Hermione.” He doesn’t feel great about the idea of discussing her behind her back.
“Oh Harry,” Hermione says affectionately, shifting from underneath him. Malfoy is still giggling, and she looks distinctly amused, but they start working in tandem to strip Harry completely naked, so it’s hard to be very mad. Hermione gives an appreciative hum when they’re done, eyes trailing down Harry’s body at a leisurely pace. She traces her finger across his collarbone, down his chest to toy with a brown nipple.
Harry is officially done with his meal. He’s about to get up and head to class early when Hermione grasps his hand.
Malfoy tenses, keens, and comes explosively between their bodies. Harry is moments away from following him, when suddenly Malfoy is no longer wrapped around him. He shoves at Harry, now genuinely trying to escape his hold, and Harry has no choice but to let him go.
Harry thinks dizzily, just as Malfoy makes a wounded noise shoots across Harry’s cock and belly. Harry follows him over the edge, bucking up against Malfoy frantically and probably babbling something embarrassingly effusive about how bloody hot he is.
Having anticipated a row, and possibly even an exchange of hexes, Harry finds himself quite mystified to be looking down upon a kneeling Draco Malfoy.
A full minute passes before her surprised, “Draco! So good of you to join us.” Then, catching sight of Harry, she issues a disdainful greeting of, “Potter.”
Hermione is gone when they wake in the morning, which is likely for the best; it wouldn’t do for their nosy classmates to see her creeping out of their room at this hour.
Harry’s only got a few months to make an impression on his Charms professor to that end, so he’s genuinely interested in digging into whatever dusty old tome Hermione is about to hand him. He’d quite like to come up with a project that is both compelling and unique, and because his focus is firmly on this, he’s rather dumbfounded when Hermione yanks him in by the tie and kisses him soundly.
“Yeah,” Harry encourages. And then, just because, he tells Malfoy about how much better his fingers are than Harry’s own. “So good, you’re so good, Malfoy.”
“Do you ever think about it?” She asks breathily. She looks over at him touching himself and gasps. “I’m guessing yes, then,” she says, laughing a little, hand still moving beneath her skirt.
“Godric,” Harry mutters, moving to bury his face in her gorgeous tits. She sighs and moans while he kisses them all over, sucks at one nipple and then the other, laves his tongue over them.
And then, gradually, Harry finds himself being deliciously pinned down by both of them. His shirt has disappeared, and Hermione’s legs are wrapped around one of his own, half her weight on top of him. She kisses him, long and slow, her hips squirming against him as she gets more and more swept up in the moment. Draco is on him too, one leg draped over Harry’s other leg, his erection prodding Harry’s hip while he focuses his attention on Harry’s exposed neck. There are hands stroking his chest, playing with his nipples, running up his thigh, tickling his belly button. Hermione sits up suddenly, shifts in the dark. He hears her murmur a Silencing Charm and set her wand down somewhere. When she lays back down, her shirt is gone.
Harry reflects for a moment, hyper-aware of Malfoy closely watching him. He's always like this when Ginny comes up in conversation, but Harry tries not to overthink what that may mean. "Well, yes, in the sense that it didn't much feel like I'd expected it to. But did I break up with her under false pretenses and then sling sexist insults at her in front of our peers?" Harry gives him a pointed look, and finally Ron begins to look appropriately sheepish. "No, it was not like that, and if it had been, you'd have kicked my arse from here all the way to London."
“Oh, do wipe that befuddled look off your face, Potter. You’ve only been teasing me with this thing all term,” Malfoy complains, reaching up to grope at Harry’s erection.
Harry, graceless and randy, lifts her just enough to angle his prick up, and then lets her rock back down on it. They moan out simultaneously, and something about Draco Malfoy’s molten silver gaze, the fact that he’s about to join them, makes it feel nothing like what they did yesterday.
“I just, I know, okay? He doesn’t-” Harry stumbles, then pushes past his embarrassment. “He doesn’t feel the way I do.”
“And hardly even then,” Harry adds, because it’s not as if she’s wrong. If he tries really hard, he can pretend Malfoy didn’t squeeze him painfully when Hermione mentioned Harry’s tendency to draw certain danger like a magnet. Hermione lies down fully and relaxes into Harry’s side. The heavy tome adjusts automatically.
Only, Hermione’s tie and shirt are both gone, and she is teasing a tantalizingly peaked nipple through the entirely sheer material of her black bra. Harry’s cock jerks alarmingly at the sight, but he finds himself incapable of looking away. Hermione watches Malfoy’s head bobbing over Harry’s cock eagerly, pinching her nipple with a breathless moan.
“I’m here,” he says mindlessly, grasping her hand. “Godric, Hermione, you’re so bloody hot,” he babbles, struck suddenly by the fact that she chose to do this here,
Slowly, carefully, Harry caps the jar in his hands and sets it on a workstation on the other side of the classroom. It occurs to Harry, suddenly, that Malfoy had not in fact
to wipe that well-shagged look off your face? As if our traipsing in late, together, isn’t going to draw enough attention on its own.”
After Harry’s caught his breath and most of his senses have returned to him, he’s kneeling between the spread of Hermione’s legs. Her arse is still in the air, though she’s collapsed onto her elbows. He watches her still pulsating, shiny and wet and so pretty, and leans in to lick a stripe from her clit all the way to her dripping hole. He pulls back to look again, sees his own come starting to drip out, and decides to take a page out of Draco Malfoy’s book; he licks and licks, spreads her wide and pushes his tongue inside to lap at the sticky mess he’s left behind. It’s not that it’s delicious, as such, but the act itself is filthy and delightful, and if Hermione’s desperate moans are anything to go by, she feels the same.
Hermione distractedly approaches Harry’s bed and flops down near the foot of it, gusting a sigh that sounds a bit like a whimper.
“Yes,” Hermione moans, thrashing. Harry ruts against her arse happily, rubbing harder between her legs as she begins to quiver. Her moans rise steadily, possibly due to some slick magic Malfoy is working with his tongue, but maybe the combined results of their efforts. She gets louder, and Harry can’t help but echo her, reveling in the sumptuous slide of her body against his. She crests, her voice rising until it breaks off, her body shaking deliciously between the two of them. Harry presses his fingers against her clit, letting her buck and squirm and twitch against them to her heart’s content.
She ignores the admonishment, staring unseeingly at the canopy of Harry’s bed. “Is this what it’s like in here every day?” she asks.
, Malfoy,” he grits out, giving himself a stroke. He doesn’t know what’s going on, has no idea what he’s about to
he is for them. Before he knows it, Harry is murmuring utter filth to him. “You like that? Your mouth full of my cock?”
Caught out, Malfoy straightens his back and looks down his nose at her. “I’d hardly say it was shoddy at all!”
He tells him, puts his lips to Draco’s ear and tells him he’s so good, he’s so hot, how is he even real?
They pass the rest of the day hanging out in Harry and Malfoy’s room, reading and poking fun at each other. They even get Harry to make progress on his Transfigurations essay, utilizing makeouts as incentives. Between Malfoy’s biting, almost possessive kisses, and Hermione’s playful seductiveness, Harry finds himself nearly done before he knows it.
He’s actually right, for once. After Charms, Hermione drags Harry to the library in search of a rare book she thinks would interest him. There’s hardly anyone in the library at this hour, but Harry doesn’t notice anything amiss, not even when she leads him deeper into the stacks than he’s likely ever been. His mind is entirely on the term project for Charms, and whether Hermione’s about to connect him with the inspiration he’d been seeking.
And she does. Within minutes, both Harry and Draco are fully seated inside her. Harry can feel Draco’s thighs on either side of his legs, straining with the effort of keeping still. Harry’s not so strong, and bucks up into the wet heat of Hermione’s cunt. He knows Draco can feel his prick by the frayed little moan he lets out. That’s when Hermione starts to move on them, twisting her hips, encouraging them to move. Draco’s got the most freedom of movement in this position, and he takes full advantage; he starts to slowly pull out and thrust back in, then picks up more speed as Hermione’s moans get deeper.
“Oh my God,” Harry says, hips jerking involuntarily. “I- I, yes, will you…? I want. I want you.” His words tumble over one another. He can’t seem to push a coherent thought past his lips.
Harry beams a smile her way, not deterred when she rolls her eyes. “But that’s just it,” he says, making sure to keep his voice low. “I’d like to advance past the level of a beginner. I want to learn to be good.”
“It’s lovely, Malfoy, but why are you showing me this? I grew up in a cupboard; I’m hardly an expert on interior design.”
It takes a second for her words to sink in, what with most of Harry’s blood having travelled directly to his cock. Then it clicks- Good Godric, they’re still in the Potions classroom! Far from dampening his arousal, the thought gives Harry a dirty, delightful feeling. But he snaps his wand out in a rush and tosses up all the privacy charms he can think of anyway. The Charms have little chance of keeping Slughorn or McGonagall out on the off-chance they should stop by, but at least they don’t have to worry about being interrupted by a fellow student.
Hermione pulls away just as suddenly, eyes slightly glazed. She turns to shoot a hateful glare at Ron, silently daring him to call her a slut again.
Bulstrode has always had a rather androgynous appearance, and Harry can’t remember the last time anyone had used gendered pronouns to refer to them. Mill very nearly cracks a smile at this, and says with some relish, “Haz.”
“That I hadn’t. Last year. But I did. Last night.” He’s still cringing. Silence reigns for several minutes. Harry wonders if Ron is about to hit him, but is otherwise feeling surprisingly calm. He’s relieved, even if this is all about to go to shit.
Harry is, again, forced to choose between agreeing with Malfoy and staying silent. He stays silent. Harry gathers his things and heads up stairs and down the hall to his room. He’s fervently hoping he’ll be able to get in a good wank before his roommate comes up, but alas, Malfoy has followed him here.
When they get to the Common Room, though, Ron is waiting. It is, of course, Ron's turn to have breakfast with Harry. Merlin fuck, maybe Harry should have taken the time to talk with Malfoy after all. At the very least, he could have mentioned the need for discretion.
But it isn't just sexual frustration that leads Harry to say, "No, mate. You've got to fix this yourself." When Ron looks stricken, he elaborates: "You're my best mate, Ron, but this isn't the first time you've torn Hermione down just because you're confused about your own feelings. You need to make this up to her, and she'd be less than impressed to learn that I'd helped."
Malfoy looks for all the world as though he's enjoying a tasty dessert, humming and licking his fingers clean. When he's done, he adjusts his prick in his trousers and glares down at Harry. "Get
Harry does know. Pretty much nothing in his own life has turned out according to his expectations. He's still not entirely sure how this relates to Ron's treatment of Hermione, though.
Harry feels his prick bump the back of Malfoy’s throat, and that’s pretty much it for him. Stars burst behind his eyelids and his hips jerk again and again, and he moans himself just about hoarse. It's the most intense, toe-curling orgasm of his life thus far, and Malfoy just keeps sucking him the entire way through.
He crowds into her space, holds her against the bookcase behind her, and lets her have her way. She kisses him, dirty and hot and almost greedy. Harry lets his hands roam her sweet little body, marveling over his luck.
And as he compiles this filthy list that will ultimately become his own sexual curriculum, he realizes Hermione’s right; he really
He takes another step forward and angles his cock down to presumably rub along her slit, and Hermione rolls her hips and moans loudly at the contact. Then it seems Malfoy is slipping right inside of her, just like that. Hermione’s mouth drops open and she gasps for breath. “You’re so wet,” Malfoy says, sounding a bit awed. He pulls his hips back and pushes forward, slowly picked up the pace. Hermione encourages him, with her words, her hands, her hips.
Incredibly, Malfoy’s cheeks flush. He throws his hands in the air dramatically, scoffing dismissively to try to cover it up, but he’s bloody well
“Morning, Blaise,” Harry says. The Slytherins apparently are not much for morning conversation. It’s sort of relieving actually, not having to speak.
“Fuck,” he hisses, watching as Hermione threads both hands in Draco’s hair and begins to shamelessly fuck his mouth. It’s not just a visual thing, either; he knows that this is what Draco likes. He
And work he does. He starts with a swirling movement that makes Harry hiss with pleasure, begins to buck with a filthy grin. It’s all Harry can do to hold on and try not to come too quickly. Draco closes his eyes, throws his head back and starts to bounce, rising high and squeezing Harry’s prick at the top of each stroke.
After dinner, Harry and Malfoy head upstairs to their bedroom while Hermione joins the contentious discussion on ancient wizard philosophers between a few Ravenclaws by the fire.
“Yes, Potter, I think you’ve made your point.” Draco is making every effort to sound dignified, but his voice is ragged, like he’s still shaken by what Harry had just done.
Harry’s eyes pop open and he looks just in time to see Hermione’s hips lower onto him, his cock being swallowed up by her dripping wet cunt. Dripping wet with - his eyes roll right back into his head and he blindly grasps Hermione’s hips, thrusting mindlessly up into her. She feels- she’s so- he’s never done this before, and he’s quite sure he won’t be lasting long at all. And then Hermione is getting louder, has started
Harry kicks off his shoes and gathers his notes close to him. This is likely for the best, though he’d had something much more fun in mind.
Malfoy turns to look at Harry as though he's said something particularly dim-witted. "Do you honestly think Granger is likely to let me anywhere near her spectacular little cunt again if the first thing I did was run and blab about it to her ex?"
around, trying to find out what you’re up to! It’s preposterous!” They both laugh at him, and it’s reminding Harry all too much of Ron and Hermione’s insistence that he was obsessed with Malfoy.
Harry is far too impatient to undress; he unbuttons and unzips his trousers, taking his cock out of his pants and rubbing it against Draco’s arsehole teasingly. Draco’s hole twitches needily under Harry’s gaze, and Harry moans shamelessly at the sight. He has to dig around for several seconds in search of the lube, but soon enough he’s slicked up and pushing inside Draco’s perfect arse. “God,” he verbalizes, staring as Draco’s greedy hole sucks him in. Hermione had prepared him so well, Harry pushes all the way in to the hilt without pausing, watches Draco’s back arch, listens as both Draco and Hermione moan.
"I'll not be missing breakfast because you're in the mood to show off your cock. Again," Malfoy informs him, and he almost sounds as annoyed as the Malfoy in Harry's fantasies. Except he's a bit breathless and his prick is very obviously fattening up within the confines of his trousers.
When Flitwick toddles off to extinguish a small fire down at Seamus’s end of the classroom, Harry innocently asks Hermione if she would like some tutoring to help get her up to speed.
And it’s not as if Harry’d somehow forgotten that Malfoy is and always has been a Slytherin. He’d just not considered that Malfoy might be using Harry for anything more than brilliant sex, and a body to warm his bed at night. Now that he’s thinking about it though, the notion that Malfoy might have another, hidden motive is hardly shocking.
He hasn’t a clue how to spell the number one thing he’d like to learn. He’s pretty sure it doesn’t actually have the word ‘cunt’ in it, although it definitely should. There are of course plenty of slang terms for the act, but Hermione is a studious, sophisticated sort. He doesn’t want to put her off this early in the game. He comes up with, considers, and ultimately discards: ‘taste your sweet cunt,’ ‘eating pussy,’ and ‘carpet-munching.’ He’s still cringing at the last when he realizes Hermione is watching him, eyebrows raised. “I, er. Don’t know how to spell it.” His mortification is somewhat lessened by the fact that this is Hermione of all people; she, at least, will appreciate his efforts to get it right.
He’s so turned on, he has to sit back on his heels and try to remember what it was he’d wanted to do to Draco here. Oh, right: devour him. Harry smirks and digs the phial of lube out of his pocket with one hand, the other caressing and squeezing Draco’s twitching arse.
Harry has exercised as much restraint as he possibly can, and finally releases Draco in the interest of yanking open his trousers with shaking hands. It’s unlikely to take him more than a few strokes to finish, but Draco apparently has something else in mind. He shoves Harry to sit, bare-arsed, in Hermione’s seat, and grabs for the mostly empty phial of lube. Harry watches, open-mouthed, as Draco dribbles the remains down Harry’s aching prick. Is this- Is he about to…?
He just can’t. He yanks his trousers open, pulling out his cock in record time. He really hopes he hasn’t somehow misread the situation, and that Hermione will still be his friend after this, but he
Harry, Hermione and Malfoy snag the coveted armchair and couch nearest the fire in the 8th year common room. Hermione gives an exaggerated yawn and claims, rather uncharacteristically, to be tired of reading. Malfoy and Harry aren’t buying it for a moment, but when she puts her socked feet in Harry’s lap and pressures Malfoy to read the assigned chapters for Defense Against the Dark Arts aloud for them, they indulge her.
Up at the Head Table, Headmistress McGonagall's lips are pursed disapprovingly. "Five points from Gryffindor for disrupting breakfast," she says crisply, ostensibly to Ginny. Her icy glare is directed at Ron, though.
Harry tosses aside his shirt and joggers post-haste, and climbs back between Hermione’s legs. He kisses her, sweetly, lets his prick lie against her, almost where she needs it. She thrusts up against it, and he groans at the wet slide of her.
“Yes, rather,” he agrees. “But back to Granger’s filthy fantasies: am I to understand you’ve written a list just like this one?”
There is a moment of quiet while they all contemplate the magnitude of what they’ve just agreed to. And then Hermione floats a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration their way. Malfoy laughs for a long minute and then agrees to read to them, so long as Harry agrees to teach him the modified Levitation Charm.
“God,” Harry says, bucking into Hermione’s tightening grip. She squeezes him just right, moaning and rolling her body on top of his, and then she whines with loss. Harry has no idea what’s happening, until Draco’s soaking wet fingers are at his lips. He licks them, tastes Hermione, and slurps them into his mouth with a moan.
Harry says nothing. Wild thestrals couldn’t drag the story of Slytherin’s locket from him just now, but he does feel something unnamed rising in him at Malfoy’s uncharacteristic show of emotion.
Harry hesitates a bit too long, and watches Malfoy’s playful expression melt away, leaving nothing in its wake.
“We’ll fill you up,” Draco says on a moan. “Both your holes dripping with hot come-” And then he arches up against Harry, swelling even bigger and hotter in his hand, and bursts. Hot come splashes over Harry’s fist, dribbles across his wrist, and Harry can hear Hermione coming too, their sweet sounds of pleasure mingling into a cacophony that makes Harry’s eyes pinch shut. His hips keep rolling against Malfoy, and he’s not even doing it intentionally, but he can’t seem to stop.
Harry says, “Look, mate, you told me that this whole breakup was meant to be temporary, that you had every intention of getting back together with her. But at this point, you'll be lucky if she ever speaks to you again."
Of course, put that way, Malfoy's seemingly kind silence makes much more sense. It came from pure, unadulterated self-interest. Malfoy wants back into Hermione's knickers, is all. He's probably, even now, thinking only of fucking her again with his fat prick, making her moan and come and...
“What did you do?” Harry asks, without quite meaning to. But now that the subject has been broached: “When you brought your flings here?”
Harry just strokes her hair. He may or may not be waxing poetic about just how brilliant that had been, but neither of them comments on his effusiveness, so he doesn’t stop.
Harry has every intention of sharing this dirty little secret with Malfoy, but it takes a while for the right opportunity to arise. Defense class is half over by the time Harry gets a chance to sneak the panties into Malfoy’s pocket away from prying eyes, and takes pleasure from watching Malfoy’s confusion give way to realization, and then to burning arousal, and then to embarrassment. He doesn’t have to look down to know that Malfoy is now sporting a raging hard-on.
Holy fuck, how is he now meant to get out of bed and start his day? He's feeling much more inclined towards a nap, to be honest, but he doubts Malfoy will allow it.
Malfoy pulls away again, looking aroused and irritated in equal measure. "Absolutely out of my mind,” he continues, shooting Harry another searing glare before dropping entirely out of sight.
He and Ron will get past this, Harry knows. It may take a while, but Ron will come around sooner or later. He always does. It’s just that they’ve all survived a bloody war, and against all odds, Harry is here. He’s alive, and he’s mostly sane, and he’s even had a bit of a post-Horcrux growth spurt. And now he’s lost his virginity in a scorching hot threesome, but instead of being toasted by his mates, he’s sitting alone by the fire feeling utterly out of sorts.
Draco promptly obeys, smoothly picking up speed at Hermione’s encouragement. Harry would dearly like to touch himself, but he’s got his hands full here. He delights in the feel of the muscles in Draco’s arse clenching and releasing with his thrusts, delights in the stutter in Draco’s hips when he lets his fingers drift inwards toward his hole, is delighted when Draco starts pumping his hips with purpose while Harry pets his pretty little hole. Hermione gasps a ‘yes!’ and Draco leans forward over her, all but begging Harry to push inside.
Malfoy gives them a wide-eyed look, and Harry can’t help but suck in a quiet gasp, but luckily it’s covered by Parkinson’s dramatic sigh.
The entire Great Hall is watching them now, and the 8th years who had witnessed the events of the previous evening are visibly entertained. Harry hardly feels he deserved to be splashed as well, but the part of him still offended on Hermione's behalf is soothed by the sight of his drenched, stuttering, and humiliated best mate.
, he thinks, resting more of his weight on top of her and letting Draco stroke his prostate with those glorious fingers. Draco pushes his fingers in, curls them expertly, pulls them mostly out. He does this, over and over, seemingly tirelessly, until Harry can feel his cock beginning to rise again.
Eventually Hermione loses her patience. “Damn it, Malfoy!” she says, and he laughs and puts his mouth where she wants it. Happily, Harry is close enough to really take it in this time. Hermione seems particularly wound up already, but Malfoy takes his time, laving her with his tongue. He places a sucking kiss on her clit, plays with her slick lips with his mouth. Hermine’s enthusiastic reactions are starting to make Harry think he should be taking notes, actually, but then Malfoy turns and looks at him sideways.
“Can’t reach your arse from this angle, sorry.” Harry gives his prick a teasing stroke. Guess you’ll have to ask someone else.” Harry meets Hermione’s eyes, sees them light up.
Malfoy scoffs, but Harry has gotten good at ignoring that sort of thing. Malfoy just wouldn't be Malfoy if he weren’t occasionally snide and bratty.
Several gasps sound throughout the very crowded room, and Harry finds that he has jumped up from his seat by the fire. “Over the line, Ron,” he says tightly. He wonders wildly if he’s going to have to punch one of his best friends in the face.
Hermione pipes up, then, having figured out exactly what Harry had meant in her predictable fashion. “We’re happy to help, Harry. And… I guess I’m also quite grateful.” At this, Harry turns to look at her. She’s smiling almost sheepishly. “I appreciate being able to explore my… sluttier fantasies without being called degrading names.”
Huffing in defeat, Harry shakes his head. He lifts his weight off Malfoy’s back, pushes himself up on his palms. “No, that’s- of course I’d like your help, Malfoy-”
Harry means to answer, but what comes out is an embarrassing whine. Malfoy squeezes his wrist and ruts against his hip at the noise, but Hermione needs more. He tries again, but all he can apparently say is, “
Harry’s body is quite awake now, though, so he gets out of bed as well. He takes a long, leisurely shower, and thinks about what illicit acts he’d like to learn next. He wonders if he should add a few more things he’d not initially thought of, such as Draco plowing his arse from behind while Hermione grinds her pussy on his tongue like she’d done to Malfoy yesterday afternoon. His mind wanders, but he feels no need to indulge in a wank for the time being. When he comes out of the en suite, Hermione is lounging on his bed stroking her pussy.
In the ensuing silence, Harry wonders just how furious Ron will be when he learns about last night. Considering Ron's current turmoil, there's a good chance Harry's got another week or so before Ron notices. But that's only if it doesn't happen again. And when one takes into account the signals Hermione and Malfoy have been sending out all day, to say nothing of his assisted wank this morning, it seems nearly inevitable that they'll do it again. It's rather unlikely Harry will be able to keep repeated instances of sex with Hermione and Draco bloody Malfoy secret for very long, all things considered.
Hermione, though, looks at Parkinson and gives her the dirtiest smirk Harry’s ever seen. Parkinson, incredibly, blushes a bright pink and hops out of her seat. She turns and struts toward her room, shooting Malfoy a look of wide-eyed incredulity as Hermione follows her. Once they’re gone and Parkinson’s door has slammed shut behind them, the entire common room bursts into chatter about the scene.
Hermione nudges him several times but Harry’s mind refuses to focus on what Professor Flitwick is saying down in front. When it comes time to practice, Harry discovers that his grasp on concentrated weather charms is actually rather impressive. When he is called upon to demonstrate, Professor Flitwick takes the time to remark upon Harry’s recent improvement in the subject. Harry spends the entire conversation trying not to laugh at the furious glare Hermione is directing his way. It doesn’t help that Malfoy is in the row just behind, snickering quietly, but Harry holds up admirably.
She moans and jerks in his arms, squeezing her pussy around him. He can’t help but move, then; he pulls out a bit and then rolls his hips back in, then does it again. Every time he pushes all the way in, her muscles clamp down around his prick, and he feels certain he won’t last long at this rate.
“I heard,” Malfoy informs her roughly, cock jerking. He steps forward, eyes fastened between Hermione’s legs. The blazing desire in his eyes is hard to miss, and Harry’s spent cock gives a feeble twitch in response. Malfoy takes another few steps forward, only millimeters away from Hermione now. “Curious about how my ‘fat cock’ will feel inside, are we?” he asks, voice low and gravelly. Harry can’t decide if he enjoys Hermione’s filthy mouth more, or Malfoy’s, but his dick is now making every effort to rejoin the fun.
"Mate, you've got to help me fix things," Ron pleads, looking quite pitiful. He's had a rough day, Harry knows. A number of upper year girls - several of whom aren't even friendly with Hermione - have worked together to make Ron's life hell. He'd been sneered at, hit with tripping jinxes, sabotaged in class, and called number of rude names all day.
“But not ‘just’ friends, right?” She gives him a knowing look. Harry tilts his head in acknowledgement. Ginny thinks on it for a moment. “I’m hardly surprised, Harry. Ya kinda love her.”
Harry considers this as he piles his plate high with fluffy eggs and several rashers of bacon. He hums skeptically, certain there are better ways to let a girl know things are over for good.
He moans, louder, nodding his head and closing his mouth over her clit to suck, as he’d seen Malfoy do. Hermione hisses a bit in response, and Malfoy puts a calming hand in Harry’s hair.
“Yes, thanks,” Harry replies quietly, knowing his face must be beet-red. He carefully copies the word ‘cunnilingus’ to the top of his list and is again fervently grateful that he gets to do this with someone who knows him so very well. As the list goes on, though, the technical terms give way to descriptions that thrill him, acts he’s heard whispers of, and things he’s only ever imagined.
Malfoy watches her go for a moment. As soon as she rounds the corner out of sight, he takes her seat. He pointedly sits too close, leans his shoulder against Harry’s, and stares out the window silently.
He's a bit torn on the notion that Draco Malfoy is the hottest guy he knows, but again, his prick is decidedly for it. Malfoy, with his sharp nose and prominent cheekbones and miles and miles of pale skin. The very same Malfoy who had bent right over last night and shown Harry his dusky little arsehole without any prompting whatsoever.
Harry blinks. He’s sure the Cloak is fully covering him, so he can’t imagine why his name has been brought into this.
Malfoy gives a delicate shrug. The other Slytherins seem to get more out of this small gesture than Harry can divine; they seem rather shocked, in fact.
It’s fine that they’re roommates, really. They just don’t talk, for the most part. Initially, they’d each spent as much time away from their shared room as possible, but once they’d figured out that neither of them particularly wanted to maintain their legendary animosity, they’d managed to just… coexist. And then, they’d begun to coexist in the Common Room. And then they’d begun to coexist in the Great Hall from time to time. They’d even coexisted in the library once or twice, one or the other of them sitting down at the same table and silently studying nearby, but not quite together. It’s totally not weird at all, aside from the fact that Harry’s dick seems more alert and active than ever before. Also, he keeps getting the urge to show it to Malfoy, for some reason.
“Draco,” she says, mimicking his tone perfectly. She rises to her feet and gives Harry a subtle wink. “See you later tonight, Harry?” Her voice is low and full of promise, which seems to raise Malfoy’s hackles even further.
“That’s it, Draco, come for us,” Harry encourages, and then can’t seem to stop babbling praise. “You’re beautiful, you’re amazing, love you, love to see you like this, let me see you come-”
Ron, quite red in the face, responds nastily, “Yeah, and you’re unlikely to get me back, slagging around with the Slytherins like this!”
“Gentle, Potter. There’s about a thousand nerve endings in that little nub; a bit of stimulation can go a long way.”
Out in the hallway, Hermione says, “Thanks for joining me, Harry. You really should come to the library more often.” She’s said it to him probably a thousand times, but instead of sounding like yet another lecture from his brainy best friend, the invitation sounds almost illicit. Harry has to work not to hasten his steps toward the Common Room.
He remembers Draco’s tongue driving him wild, and tries the same approach. Draco is tense and silent, so Harry tries to take a bit more of his cock, sucking and licking around his mouthful as best as he can. Draco twitches, and when Harry looks up, he’s got his eyes squeezed shut, sheets balled in his fists, teeth in his bottom lip. Harry
The fat head of Draco’s prick feels significantly larger than his fingers, but Harry feels greedy for it, even if it is rather a lot to take.
Until Malfoy gives a none too gentle tug at Harry’s hair and tells him, “Get your cock out, Potter, I want you to come in my mouth,” at which point Harry hastens to obey. He’s out of his trousers and pants in record time, and since Draco just lies on his back, looking up at him, Harry realizes exactly what he must do.
“Yes,” Harry answers simply. He doesn’t mention that being ripped away from his life was what he’d spent all 11 of those years dreaming of.
Harry’s Fridays are splendidly free of classes. He has a plan to spend most of the day lazing about in bed, but something about sleeping in Malfoy’s bed with his face buried in Malfoy’s hair is having an unforeseen effect on his subconscious mind. He has a profoundly detailed dream about sucking Malfoy off, and when he wakes up that morning, the only thing he wants more than sleep is to make that dream a reality.
“Ooooh!” Hermione says, drawn out like the slow slide of Draco’s prick inside her. “Yeah,” she declares when he’s fully seated in her cunt. “Fuck me.”
“God, Hermione,” he pants into her hair, lacking anything else to say. Malfoy hums, seemingly in agreement, not letting go of the dark nipple he’s sucked into his mouth.
“Ah, here it is!” she announces needlessly, sliding past him with a smile. Harry means to check out the book, but mostly he’s just watching the sway of Hermione’s hips as she walks away.
“If she keeps this up, I may end up fancying her before the term is over,” Malfoy says, dragging his eyes up to meet Harry’s again.
Draco Malfoy eating their come out of Hermione’s swollen pussy while she twitches, whines and whimpers. Harry groans as his oversensitive cock gives a reflexive jerk at the sight. The both look over at the sound, and Hermione smiles at him the way she always does – like she’s happy to see her best friend – while Malfoy smirks. He takes another long lick and crawls over to Harry, messily kissing him. Harry can taste all three of them on Malfoys tongue, and his dick gives another determined twitch.
Harry Potter,” she says, still laughing, and Harry doesn’t feel the least bit bad about landing halfway on top of her.
“Whoop!” he shouts, arms flailing comically as he goes down. After, Harry lies on the floor mortified and red-faced, thinking about being somewhere very, very far from here.
Harry deliberately casts his mind back to about 15 minutes ago, when he slipped his soap-slicked cock between Malfoy’s tightly clenched thighs, hips bouncing off Malfoy’s slippery arse, and wanked the blushing blond to a second wailing orgasm. He feels his mouth curve into a salacious, satisfied grin, and doesn’t fight it down. He’d not be who he was if he didn’t still enjoy annoying the piss out of Draco Malfoy.
I’m going to-” and just like that, he’s coming. Some of it shoots across Harry’s tongue, and the rest hits his lower lip and drips down his chin.
“You can. Pinch,” she pants, and when Harry obliges, her whole body tenses. Her voice is high, almost pained, as her orgasm washes over her. Malfoy takes control again and fucks her through it until she collapses back in Harry’s arms, shivering.
The next morning, Harry wakes up in Malfoy’s bed, erect and alert. All night, he’d dreamt about their plans. God, he can’t wait. He kisses the back of Malfoy’s neck and shoulders until he wakes up, and then they lazily wank each other off. Harry looks at Malfoy’s mussed hair and sleepy eyes and doesn’t think about the weird feeling in his chest. He thinks, instead, about how Malfoy is so pliable, so willing to give Harry what he wants, but that only makes the weird feeling grow, so he closes his eyes and listens to Malfoy’s breath catch and drag.
Now, Harry climbs onto his bed, letting his books fall to the floor. Maybe he can make Malfoy go away with the power of his mind? He sits and stares, silently demanding that Malfoy fuck off.
. He spins around, throws his shoulders back, and struts through the doors. Malfoy clips confidently towards the Eighth Year table, giving every appearance of not noticing the eyes on him.
“Yes, Draco, you may finger my arse.” Her tone is a bit sardonic, but Harry watches her tension drain away at Draco’s reassurance.
Hermione rolls her eyes a little as she takes off her top and unclasps her bra, tugging the cups away from her tellingly peaked nipples. It seems he’s not the only one who’s been thinking of more than just schoolwork.
After, after they’ve petted and stroked and kissed and nuzzled each other. After they’ve luxuriated in the feel of bare skin against so much more bare skin. After, Hermione hums reluctantly.
Once they're seated at the 8th year table, Ron erects a mild privacy charm to prevent eavesdroppers, and even lip-readers, from learning anything said. This, too, is their new normal.
Laying kiss after kiss over Harry’s heart. It’d be difficult, even for Harry, not to read into that one.
“I should go,” she says. Which, not the worst idea, considering how small the bed is. But Harry gets the feeling that’s not what she’s talking about.
Harry, presented with an unimpeded view of Malfoy’s furled little arsehole, forgets his resolve and his hand flies to his cock. “Jesus
Malfoy pants and curses above him, tells Harry how dirty he is, and pushes his arse back into the onslaught.
Malfoy closes his ledger, setting it to the side. He stands, tall and sleek, and stretches his arms above his head. Something in Harry desperately wants to pounce. Malfoy walks over, leisurely in his approach, slowly crawling on Harry’s bed to sit between them. When he speaks, his voice is sleek like honey. “There’s hardly any need to be nervous. We’re just going to have some fun, and if we never reach our desired destination, I imagine we’ll still enjoy ourselves quite a bit along the way. Alright by you, Potter?” He lays a hot little kiss on Harry’s mouth without giving him the chance to respond.
Malfoy catches on rather quickly, to his credit. Not five minutes in, he hisses, “Potter, you bleeding idiot,” from the side of his mouth. Harry counts himself lucky that Malfoy leaves it at that.
“Right,” Harry says again, and performs the appropriate sweeps and swirls with his wand. He maybe mumbles the incantation against the soft skin of Hermione’s neck, but can feel the spell take effect anyway.
Malfoy is murmuring something between moans, but he’s clutching Harry so tightly, undulating in his arms, and Harry can’t make much sense of it. He can’t fucking believe Malfoy is letting him do this, even if he is complaining at the same time. The words, “fuck you, Potter,” break through Harry’s aroused haze, but they only encourage him.
Harry takes a long time spreading him open with wet fingers, fingering him happily until Draco begs for his cock. Then, graciously, gives it to him. Mostly, only Draco’s arse is on Harry’s jumper. The truth is that Harry lays Draco Malfoy in the dirt and fucks him slow and hard in the dim quiet of the Greenhouse. Draco pants and cries out, but mostly, looks up at Harry with a questioning, confused look.
But now, he’s remembering the way Hermione had shamelessly used Malfoy’s mouth, the way Malfoy had unhesitatingly offered Harry his arse. The way he’d happily surrendered his body for their pleasure.
He blinks, looks away, tries not to drown in the wave of emotion washing over him. When he turns his head and sees the look on Hermione’s face, so startled and intrigued, and he kisses her. He knows Malfoy can feel the erratic pounding of his heart, knows Hermione can see that his eyes are maybe just the
He feels feverish, like he’s swimming, caught on powerful waves but not the least bit frightened of drowning. She feels so bloody good under him, and Draco puts his hands on Harry’s arse, touches him fervently. Harry is lost in sensation, and is glad Draco doesn’t ask.
“Yes, I do recall,” Harry replies, rolling his eyes. “I was just thinking that it’s a subject worthy of…
“Hermione,” he groans, loud and long, seemingly unable to say anything else. He doesn’t do this, doesn’t let himself look at her like this. But it’s impossible to avoid right now, because she knows Harry is turned on, and she’s lying on his bed. Her breathing is uneven, and the points of her nipples are clearly visible through her blouse, bra conspicuously missing. Did Pansy Parkinson remove it? Harry groans again, thinking about Parkinson laying kisses over Hermione’s bare breasts, sucking a dark nipple into her mouth, making Hermione moan…
He’s coming, like a shooting star bursting across the sky. His cock shoots off, entirely untouched, and come spurts across his own chest.
“Hm?” Harry asks, unapologetically smug. He uses both hands to spread Malfoy’s arse, and licks another slow stripe over his hole and up. Malfoy curses creatively, but Harry notices he’s neither pulling away nor asking him to stop. He’s working purely on instinct and imagination here, so he tries a few things: flickers his tongue over Malfoy’s hole and around it. He prods at the puckered ring gently, feels the muscles twitching under his tongue, listens to Malfoy’s guttural sounds of approval.
Malfoy’s reaction is much more interesting to Harry. He stands, looking almost more shocked to see him than either of his friends. He’d known Harry was standing there, so Harry can’t imagine why he looks so relieved to see him.
Hermione gets a pleased, flustered look on her face. She writes something on a little scrap of parchment and slides it his way. “That?” she asks, voice low.
When their laughter finally dies all the way down, Ron looks pensive. Harry suggests a game of chess, because that always helps his best mate sort out his thoughts, but Ron says no thanks. He needs time, and takes off without telling Harry where he’s headed.
Oh fuck, Harry's close. The hungry look in Malfoy's eyes as he watches Harry's fist move is only pushing him further along. He's embarrassed at being caught, of course, but he's also maybe been fantasizing about this all term. And potentially even longer than that.
“Silencing Charm,” Hermione orders, and Harry throws up the strongest Muffliato of his life. She whimpers as he kisses and nips his way back up to her lips. This time, he takes control. He kisses her the way he’s wanted to for ages, takes her breath away. She’s panting when she pulls away to request a proximity alarm, and Harry, sick of the disruptions, performs the charm silently, as he licks his way into her sweet mouth. He slips a thigh between her legs, feels her immediately respond.
Harry spends some time nibbling on Malfoy’s neck and groping his arse, trying hard not to think about how many more times he’ll get to do this before Malfoy inevitably moves on.
Harry moans, snaps his hips twice, and is done. He comes, cock twitching deep inside Hermione’s cunt, arse clenching on Draco’s fingers.
“Harry,” Hermione says, drawing the end out on a moan. She tries to say something else, but Malfoy makes an obscene slurping noise, and the next thing out of her mouth is, “That’s right, Malfoy, suck my clit.”
Cuffs undone, Malfoy unbuttons his shirt and slides it off his shoulders. He’s still slim, but it’s clear to Harry from the glimpses he’s caught that Malfoy is steadily putting on muscle. Harry is still shamelessly eyeing his back when Malfoy turns around and looks right at him.
Harry smiles and gets back to the task at hand. He tries to suck a bit more into his mouth, but promptly gags. Draco gasps above him. Okay, that was too much. Harry pulls back, gives most of his attentions to the head of Draco’s prick, stroking the rest with his hand. Draco’s so hot and so thick, and Harry bobs his head slowly, using as much tongue as he can.
The photograph Malfoy hands him is of a gorgeous Queen Anne style home, in white with classy green accents. It is opulent, yes, but practically understated for a Malfoy home. “Looks nice.”
When he looks up again, Draco’s buried his face between Hermione’s legs, moaning into her cunt while she bucks against his face.
Malfoy slams into Hermione a few more times with a deep and continuous groan, coming deep inside her cunt. Harry’s eyes roll back into his head and his hand is frantic on his cock and, oh God, he feels some of Malfoy’s come drip out onto his hand and he’s going to-
The healer nods and notes it down. “Well, I’m sure you’re aware that you’ll have to be watched over for a while”
Draco walks to the mirror and takes his pajama shirt off. Staring at his swollen growing stomach, he sighs rubbing a hand over it, thoughts whirling through his mind. He forces his eyes away and walks towards the wardrobe and pulls out some warm fluffy jumpers. Putting on a red one, he puts on some dark denim blue jeans and looks at himself over in the mirror.
Draco stares in horror at the sight of Rita Skeeter sitting there staring at him as if she’s about to eat him. “So,” Skeeter says leaning in, reaching for her notepad and pen. “What’s this about you being pregnant with Voldemort's child?”
Draco stares right back at Ron. "They're out early," he comments to which Ron nods. "So it's just you and me"
Harry turns to him. “That’s your problem Malfoy, you don’t face your problems, you run away from them, you must face them”
As Draco makes his way home he feels a craving creep upon him. A craving for donuts and pickles. Draco scrunches his face at the thought however his stomach is yearning for it. Pulling over to buy the donuts, his phone rings loudly
Harry enters the fast food restaurant and bites his lip to hide the small smile that threatens to lift on his face. ‘Draco is going to be able to get help’ he thinks to himself happily. Once he’s next in line, Harry asks for two take-away double cheese burgers with chips. He then leaves and once he’s in an alleyway, he apparates home to find Draco watching TV. He smiles widely and it doesn’t drop when Draco stares at him weirdly.
Draco smiles slightly. “That’s true,” he says. “But i wasn’t safe there, people kept attacking me and no one wanted to hire a death eater, and surely at Hogwarts, it will be the same”
Chanting the words “They’re wrong” over and over again is how Narcissa found him when she used “Alohomora” to open the front door when Draco didn’t answer. She races towards him and drops to the ground where Draco is rocking back and forth.
He glances at the time and sees it’s a few minutes past seven in the morning. “I can’t go back to sleep,” he mutters to himself. “Might as well start the day”
“Wait a moment,” Potter says holding a finger up. “What’re you doing in a muggle supermarket,” he questions. “Did you get lost” he teases
Once Narcissa finally leaves after loads of convincing from Draco that he’s fine, Draco shuts the door and slides down the wall, pulling his knees to his chest blankly staring at nothing, thoughts whirling around his head
“Not really,” Harry says. “The baby might not end up dark like Voldemort, i believe we are different from our parents despite whether or not we look or act like them, we’re all different in our own ways,” he states. “Besides, we all have light and dark inside us, we have the ability to choose which to act on, and if i have any say in it i’ll make sure this child won’t have to choose dark” he says mostly the last part to Draco. Harry sends the stunned store helper a smile. “Anyway, help us look for a sofa bed?”
“I understand darling, but still--” she cuts herself off at the sigh and sad look Draco sends her. “--Okay, i respect your decisions”
Pansy nods. “At first i was a bit iffy about the muggles and muggle world, but it’s not that bad I guess, phones and TVs are amazing though”
Guilt bubbles in Draco's stomach already that he's causing so much worry to those around him "I'll be okay"
Harry shakes his head. “You were taken advantage of and forced to become pregnant by a horrible man, what you feel is absolutely valid”
Draco scoffs, tempted to tell Potter what really happened to be able to prove him wrong. Instead, he says “Well, it’s not like I can change things now, so i’m going to have to deal with it”
Draco glances at the time in confusion. ‘I’m early’ he thinks to himself, but instead, he says “Good morning Sir”
Dr Jones frowns. "It may be for the best, rape is traumatic, and from someone like he who must not be named, it must have been horrifying, and for it to result in pregnancy..."
Granger, Weasley and Potter stare at him with their mouths open in shock. “Wait,” Weasley holds a hand up. “You…” he starts. “You work here, as a waiter?”
Draco sighs, resting his head against the wall, looking up to the ceiling. “Great, just great” he mutters. “Now everyone is going to know what happened” he squints his eyes shut with a grimace
“--No need to fret Granger,” Draco says. “You guys are the golden trio and you have your secrets, i understand”
Narcissa chuckles. “Oh, I'm fine,” her chuckle then dies down. “But i’m worried about you Draco, i’m constantly on edge and scared something might happen to you,” she squeezes his hands tightly. “Please, come live with me, come home”
Draco sighs in relief when Potter leans back, away from being so close to his face. He glances around to find that Rita Skeeter is not in the room. “Where is she?” he bites his lip so hard blood comes out
“This isn’t fair mother, why did Potter and Weasley have to lose their baby and why did i have to fall pregnant and be stuck with this monster growing inside me”
“Draco,” Narcissa breathes through her nose to try to calm the fire burning of rage flowing through her. “Are you saying that the dark lord...raped you?”
“You know,” Harry says, grabbing a towel to dry off the dishes Draco is washing. “You could move in with me, Ron and Hermione”
“I can’t believe I didn’t have the courage to end up getting rid of you last month,” Draco says to his stomach. “You’re so going to ruin my body” he whines
Narcissa exclaims “Yes please” at the same time Draco says “No”. Narcissa glares at her son. “I want a picture of my grandchild”
Draco makes his way to the kitchens, but with each step getting heavier and head starting to feel light, Draco’s vision starts to blur before black overcomes him and he falls to the ground with a hard thump
They both hear footsteps slowly fade away and they both let out a breath. Harry looks to Draco carefully. “Will you be okay?”
When he arrives home and turns the light on, he jolts and jumps at the sight of Pansy standing in the corner. Heart pounding from the fright, he counts himself lucky that he didn’t drop the shopping. He places the shopping on the counter and begins to put the things away.
Once Hermione and Draco return, Hermione sits besides Ron on the sofa and wraps her arms around him into a snuggling cuddle as they watch a cooking show on the TV. Harry stares at Draco who’s standing shuffling his feet and staring awkwardly at the ground.
“What’s wrong? What’s wrong?” Draco starts. “Well first, i was forced to do something i never wanted to do and now i’m stuck with the consequences, and i have a monster’s baby growing inside me and everyone keeps saying i’m being a horrible person for not wanting to be reminded of what happened” he exclaims, voice breaking and breath hitching slightly.
“No it’s not ‘whatever’ Draco” she starts but before she could finish Draco starts vomiting again into the toilet
Narcissa’s face turns slightly red with fury. “I’m going there right now and i’m going to give them a piece of my mind, how dare they not look over or treat my son when he needs it” she says as she’s about to apparate but Draco exclaiming “Don’t!” stops her in her tracks
Draco is searching for the pasta as Harry rambles on about anything and everything he can think of to fill the deafening silence which threatens to overcome. As Harry is slicing the onions, he curses through blurry eyes as the sizzling of the minced meat starts to get higher indicating it’s almost burning. He’s about to turn around when he spots Draco stirring the meat, making the sizzling die down
Once he arrives at the supermarket, he grabs a basket and grumbles when his stomach starts to roar again. “Calm down, I’m getting food” he says to his stomach earning a few strange stares from strangers
“I understand Mrs Malfoy,” Harry says. “But there will be three of us and we will look after him, we won’t allow him to harm himself, and part of recovery is also having alone time and being with friends”
They all agree and make their way to the sitting room. Draco is about to leave, but Harry looks at him in confusion. “Aren’t you going to stay?”
Narcissa nods before watching as they take Draco away. “Why Draco why” she sobs to herself as he’s taken away by healers
As the day goes past, serving customers in the prestigious restaurant in central muggle London, Draco spots the time and sees it’s four in the afternoon. He sighs bringing a coffee to an old couple who scrunch their faces like there’s a bad smell.
“Right” Draco nods biting his lip hard to fight off the tears swelling in his eyes, everything becoming overwhelming
Draco moves to a stand and makes his way towards the door where Ron and Hermione are looking in with wide eyes. “We’ll leave you both to talk in private” Draco says before leaving the room and signaling Hermione and Ron to follow him before shutting the door
Harry nods. “I understand, at least you found something to help distract yourself and keep you calm”
With a sigh, Draco allows his mother to place the gift in his hands. He fumbles and feels it, before gently peeling off the sellotape and pulling the small fabric box out. He opens it and feels it to be a pendant with the outline of two dragons on the side of a large silver M in the middle
Draco sits down and watches as Harry sits in front of him before taking a small bite of his burger. “No, not really”
Harry apparates in front of the clinic and enters the big building. He states his name and date of birth to the receptionist and then makes his way to the waiting room.
“I don't know Harry,” Ginny sobs. “I was so careful, how could this happen?” she cries. “Today i found blood when i went to the toilet and i went to the healer and they did a few scans but the baby...the baby...the baby is gone”
“It just occurred to me, I've been living in the muggle world too long,” Draco says. “Why don’t and didn’t we use transfiguration to transfigure something into a bed”
Harry stares at Draco for a moment before turning and putting the milk in the fridge. He then turns and looks between Ron, Hermione and Draco. "I have an appointment with my therapist around twelve today guys, so I won't be here for lunch"
Draco shrugs picking at his burger, his stomach twisting and turning like a washing machine. “Nothing much, mostly watched TV and drew a bit”
Not sure how to respond to that, Hermione, Ron and Ginny stay quiet and wait for Harry to calm down a bit.
Once they’ve finished eating Draco starts to wash the dishes, as Harry goes to the bedroom to get changed. When Draco finishes the dishes, he knocks on the bedroom door and opens it when Harry says “Come in”. He walks in only to flush when he sees Harry shirtless, his muscles flexing as he puts a shirt on.
Hermione sits down besides Ron after putting the rest of the shopping away. "But if you feel like you're a danger to yourself if you're left alone or won't be safe then we can change our plans," she says. "We don't want any harm to come to you"
Thank you all for the comments, kudos, and everything. Please be careful of triggers, this story has triggering content
“Draco,” Potter says. “I’ll talk to them and we’ll see how things go, I can't promise that if you do live with us that it will go smoothingly, but it will only be for a few weeks before going to Hogwarts”
“Well as your son, i’m begging you that you please don’t say anything or go there and just leave things be”
“I spoke to her,” Potter says. “I made sure she won’t write anything about what happened or anything we spoke about”
Draco crosses his arms and looks away with a pout. “Then you’re the most...the most…annoying person i’ve ever met”
Lucius swallows a thick stream of saliva which is stuck in his throat. “Okay, you don’t have to tell me anything and I won't ask further questions to any of you,” he holds his hands up. “I just don’t want to lose you all again”
Draco nods. “Yeah, i’m going back to sleep,” he then looks at Ginny. “I’m sorry about the baby Weasley”
“Gather your things Mr Malfoy, you are discharged” the healer says before leaving the room as Harry yells “Cowards!”
The presence of his best friend, helping to calm Draco’s nerves. Draco breaks the silence by his stomach growling. Pansy chuckles and allows Draco to stand and make some lunch. Helping Draco cut some vegetables, Pansy stares blankly at the wall thoughts whirling.
Hearing her footsteps slowly fade away. He quickly goes to the toilet and changes into jeans and a shirt before leaving the room. As he enters the sitting room, he quickly glances around for Draco and frowns when he can’t spot him.
Draco hastily wipes his tears with the palm of his hand and opens the tap to splash cold water over his warm face, the shock from the cold water snapping him out of his loud overbearing thoughts once more.
“I don’t want anything to do with this baby, if you want to be in its life, you can, just don’t force me to be in it” Draco states
Narcissa grabs his hand and exclaims. “Hey, why don’t we go shopping for more baby things--OH, maybe even buy things for the nursery”
Narcissa and Pansy stare down at him. “Answer the man” Narcissa says curious at how long this has been going on, and she can see right through Draco if he lies
Harry sighs. “You know how the news came out about him being pregnant with Voldemort's baby?” he questions but knows that she knows already, everyone knows. At Ginny’s nod, he continues saying “Well, i invited him over to stay until we go back to hogwarts”
Pansy and Narcissa stare at him in shock. Narcissa looks at Draco and sees he’s not lying. How could she have not known or noticed her son was doing this, she’s supposed to be observant, how could he miss that her baby was in so much pain that he had to resort to this
“I still don’t understand why you insist on living in the muggle world,” Narcissa comments. “You hardly even use magic nowadays”
Draco holds onto his mother, holding on for dear life as tears start to fill his eyes. “I love you too mother”
Draco bites his lip. He doesn’t want to move in with his mother as she will be overbearing and won’t leave him alone. He’s about to say something but Harry beats him to it
“Well, I can't keep living here that’s for sure since Skeeter now knows where I live,” he says. “Maybe I’ll move back in with mother at the manor, but she’s so overbearing and makes me constantly think about the baby when i just want to forget this thing exists”
‘Beautiful’ is the thought that goes through Draco’s mind before he could stop it, and as soon as he thinks about it, his face scrunches. ‘What on earth am I thinking, Potter is NOT beautiful. Beautifully annoying maybe’
Entering a small coffee shop, he sighs taking in the warm heat flushing across his cold face. Making his way to the line, he spots Potter sitting at a table all by himself. Draco hums at the sight of Potter's wild mop of hair and bright green eyes focused on a book.
Heat flushing his cheeks and heart dropping to the pit of his stomach, he covers his mouth and races towards the bathroom and hides in one of the stalls, pulling his knees to his chest as he sits on top of the toilet seat and allows his tears to fall
Once they reach the hospital, Draco does some tests and answers some more questions, and the results come back that he fainted because he didn’t eat anything today.
Narcissa catches herself and yells “What about the fact that you didn’t tell us you self harm?!” she exclaims, still angry. “If i didn’t check up on you, you’d be dead” she says
Draco wakes up in a cold sweat to a cold empty bed. He frowns at the loss of warmth but of course he should've expected it as he was sleeping alone on the new sofa bed. It's comfortable but he misses the warmth and comfort of another person besides him, though he would never admit it.
“--Also Hogwarts iis a safe place, and i’m not alone, i’ve got my friends--hell, i even have Potter”
Before Harry can respond, a crack echoes across the room. They snap their heads to the source to find Ron and Hermione laughing at something as they apparate into the room. “Hey guys” Hermione greets her laugh dying down slightly
When Narcissa spots that Draco is awake, she stomps towards him. “You better explain right now,” her low voice exclaims. “Explain why i found you nearly dead in the bathroom, why you have all those old and new cuts across your wrists, go on explain” she growls slightly
She stands and hugs Draco tightly. “Hello darling, how’re you doing? How is Mr Potter treating you, tell me everything” she sits once again and waits for Draco to respond
Draco tilts his head as a sudden thought hits him. “And are you two,” he points to Ron and Hermione. “Sleeping in the same room, wait are you two together?”
Stumbling up to a stand like a baby deer, Draco grasps onto the sink with one arm, to hold himself up while staring at the reflection in the mirror who stares back at him. With a sigh, he manages to hold himself up without holding onto something and he washes the neatly scattered cuts under cold water before bandaging his arm up
He takes a deep breath and fumbles to find a razer, knocking over things in the process and having things fall to the floor. He freezes like a deer in the headlights as he holds his breath to hear if his mother noticed but he just hears the TV loudly play.
Dr Jones shakes her head. "It may be how things are, but it still affects you and you shouldn't bottle those feelings in," she says. "This may sound like a stupid question, but how do you feel about it? Angry? Resentful? Sad?"
Hermione blinks at him. “Wasn’t he sleeping with you” she says and then winces at how weird that would sound out of context
“Yes,” Draco says. “I can't keep looking at this child and remembering what the dark lord did, not only to me but to everyone. If I weren't a coward, I would abort this thing, but what if this child ends up being like him”
Hermione goes towards Ginny and rubs her back in comfort. “Let's talk about this over some tea, yeah?”
Potter nods. “Only for a while, things are quite hectic in the wizarding world and i want to take a break”
Slamming a fist on the table, Draco shakes his head. “No,” he says. “I’m not telling him, if mother wants to tell him, she can tell him herself”
Walking towards the kitchen, he sits on a chair and holds his head in his hands, staring at the Hogwarts letter which glares at him.
Draco hisses in pain at the pressure on his freshly cut arm and whirls around to see Potter glancing around the flat. Draco yanks his arm back and glares at Potter with wide eyes. “What did you do, why are you here?!” Draco yells
Before Draco can retort, Ron’s and Hermione’s soft chuckles fill the room. “What?” Harry stares between them
“Well Draco, this baby is real, all this is real, and it’s happening whether you like it or not. So you might as well accept it as soon as possible” Narcissa says
Draco startles awake with a jolt and heavy breaths, memories flashing through him. Taking deep breaths, heart pounding against his chest, he sits up and glances around the low lit room from the dawn of a new day peeping through his window. Draco refuses to shut his eyes as he takes deep breaths, slowly counting to ten, and since he only sees blood and carnage and fire behind the darkness of his eyes.
Harry looks at Draco carefully. “Yeah i meant it, whether you like it or not, i’m going to help take care of the baby and make sure it doesn’t go dark”
Ginny laughs a bitter laugh. “I was actually excited for this baby,” she states. “Even though it was unplanned and we’re not together anymore...i actually already love--i mean, loved, this baby”
He stares at his stomach once again which sticks out slightly. “You’re going to ruin my body,” he grumbles. “I hate you”
The healer turns to him. “You know if i had it my way, i wouldn’t treat you nor care less if you kill yourself again, you and that disgusting baby don’t deserve it”
Flinching as a hand touches his back, Draco relaxes as he looks at Harry’s big green concerned eyes fill with determination.
Draco rises to a stand. “I’m going to get dressed” he makes his way to Potter's room where his clothes are hanging in a wardrobe. He shuts the door behind him once he’s in the room and puts on some red jeans with a white button up shirt before making his way to the mirror and staring at his reflection. Draco states at his small baby bump which sticks out slightly, he sighs deeply before shaking his head.
Potter holds a hand on his chest as his laughter dies down. “I don’t remember you being this funny Malfoy,” he says. “You, living in the muggle world? Please, if you want to lie at least tell a more convincing story”
Draco sighs. “We spoke about this mother, I'm not welcome or wanted in the wizarding world, I'm not safe, and I don't like it anymore. Magic and the wizarding world is what got me into this mess in the first place”
Once he’s officially done vomiting, Draco brushes his teeth and rinses out his mouth before going back to the dining room. Pansy points to the food. “You’re going to finish the rest of the food,” she says in more of a statement than a question
“--I never consented for anything, much less to end up having his child, I refuse to have anything to do with it”
He races to work and sighs in relief when he barges through the door and finds that his boss is not here yet.
Draco stares at Potter, his eyes are full of concern and worry. Draco lowers his gaze unable to keep contact with those fierce eyes. He takes a deep breath and shuts his eyes. “I--I was…” he trails off biting his lip, unable to say the words. “I can’t do this.” He turns around and apparates to his flat unaware that Potter grabbed his wrist at the same time he apparated and is now standing with Draco in his apartment
Hermione huffs. “Well if you must know, i am seeing someone, a therapist and believe me, it helps a lot”
Narcissa curses and sprints towards Draco, pulling her son's cold body out of the bath and checking his pulse. Her heart shatters as she stares at the cuts across Dracos's arm, some new, some old.
“Thank you, darling, I just don’t want you to regret anything,” she cups his cheek. “And remember, I’ll support whatever decision you make”
Harry hesitantly brings a hand up watching as Draco flinches but allows him to gently wipe away the tears streaming down his face. Harry sighs. “You didn’t deserve what happened to you, as much as you were a git, you don’t deserve that, and i’m sorry that happened to you”
A flash of a fiery flame flares across Draco’s stomach and up to his chest. Anger burning through him. “Why?” he looks up now in despair, a pit forming in his stomach. “Why did this have to happen, why? It was bad enough the dark lord…” he trails off unable to say the words. “But now, this?”
Potter stares at him. “No, you’re not okay, I can tell,” he says before standing up. “I’ll make us lunch, I’m a very good cook."
Draco walks into the sitting room with a sigh. Ron and Harry are setting up to play some chess while Hermione is getting dinner ready. He walks towards Hermione and stirs the rice and vegetables together. Hermione sends him a tight smile
Draco glances at the clock on the wall and spots that it's just over nine in the morning. 'I'm hungry' Draco thinks to himself and just on cue his stomach rumbles and twists with hunger. Draco raises to a stand and makes his way to the kitchen, Weasley's eyes follow his every move, observing him.
Opening it to reveal his mother with a bunch of shopping bags in her hands. Draco furrows his eyebrows. “Hello mother,” he starts before pointing to the bags. “What’s with all the shopping bags?” he questions
As soon as the door is shut with a soft click, Ginny drops to the floor and sobs into her hands. Harry joins her on the floor and pulls her into a tight hug, rocking her back and forward, forcing back a stray tear that threatens to fall. “What...how…” Harry trails off
“--No buts,” Harry cuts him off. Staring deeply into those stormy grey eyes Harry firmly says “It is not your fault”
Draco sighs and wipes his eyes before opening the stall door to reveal Potter standing there with a small tight smile. Draco goes to the sink to wash his hands, Potter following him like a dog.
Draco has no idea why Potter is saying these things, he figures it must be because of the loss and grief Harry must be feeling.
Taking a deep breath he glances across the open cabinets and looks for the razer. Spotting it, he pulls down his sleeve and removes the bandage, revealing his scratched and cut arm. Long cuts are scattered across his wrist, the deep cuts burning against his skin as blood slowly seeps out.
Narcissa shushes him with a hiss and wide eyes before glancing around. She turns her hard gaze towards Lucius. “What happened is none of your business”
Narcissa squeals holding them up and barging through to the inside of the flat. She plops them on top of the table and turns to Draco with a huge beaming smile. “So,” she starts, gripping Draco’s shoulder. “I went shopping and I just couldn’t help myself”
“I’ll never like, much less love, this thing” Draco slaps his stomach glaring down at the small bump sticking out
“Hello,” a store helper greets walking towards them before stopping in his tracks, making Draco and Harry stare at the blonde haired man in confusion. “Oh my god,” the man gasps. “You’re Harry Potter” he whisper-shouts making a few close by people glance at them in confusion
Sitting down, Draco serves himself the food and waits for everyone to be dished up before eating his food. The air is looming over them. Once done, Draco offers to wash the dishes but Hermione says it’s her turn and that it will be his turn next time.
“I’m meant to be on my period, but it hasn't come yet, but menstruation never made me vomit before…” he trails off to himself starting to feel a bit of dysphoria
Draco flinches at the cold liquid being rubbed on his stomach but settles down once the doctor puts the ultrasound scanner on the lower part of his belly.
After watching a movie, Narcissa decides to check on Draco. She opens the door to his bedroom to find his room empty. She knocks on the bathroom door and she grasps the doorknob and attempts to open the door only to find it locked. “Draco, darling,” she says. “Are you in there?”
“Right, wouldn’t it be better to move in with me?” Narcissa says before looking at Harry. “No offense Mr Potter, but Draco needs to be looked over and he’s not safe to look after himself after what he did”
Having enough of the stare, Draco turns to stare back at her, making flinch and move her gaze but Draco doesn’t stop there. “Is there anything i can help you with Granger” he questions
Making his way to the dining table with Potter, Draco sits and starts to eat his food along with Harry, Chatting every so often about random things which soon turn to hushed bickering before starting a new subject and repeating the cycle. Once done, Draco goes to wash the dishes and Harry follows.
“Here’s my phone number if you change your mind” Potter writes his number down on a tissue before handing it over to Draco
Potter knocks on the door once more. “And since when do you care what others think of you Malfoy, come on, come out”
For a moment Draco is silent, just staring at her, tears streaming down his cheeks. “You’re wrong,” he finally whispers, shaking his head. “You’re wrong”
Draco squints his eyes further shut, however stays quiet and doesn’t respond as the healer continues to ramble on about him. It’s not until he hears a cough that he snaps his eyes open to see Potter standing at the door with a deep frown upon his face.
A loud deafening silence fills the room. Harry shuts his eyes. "Why?" he questions. "Hermione, you know everything," he says much to Hermione's protest. Harry glares at the ground. "Why must this happen?" he says but knows its not her fault. He grits his teeth, anger bubbling in his stomach
"Yeah" Ron moves his gaze to the TV to which Draco is grateful as the air becomes tense and he can't keep the eye contact up.
“But--” Harry starts but cuts himself off at the pointed hard look Draco sends him. “--Okay, i understand, but just think about it more”
Draco is shaking, his whole body trembling. “You are,” he says. “At least wrong about me, all my life you were wrong about me”
Harry bites his lip in thought. “I don’t know, i just don’t like people getting hurt or being treated unfairly”
Draco sighs thinking back on how his mother reacted when he said that he’s not going to visit him in Azkaban, let alone tell him about the baby, but he said that if his mother wants to visit and tell him, she could. She was not happy, saying how he’s still his father, the baby’s grandfather and nothing can change that, which made him feel and still feel right now guilty
Draco sighs. “I think about it more later” he glances at the time then races out the door and on his way to work
“My son…” Lucius trails off at the sight of a broken Draco, a bandage around Draco's arms showing the cuts and his stomach bulge slightly swollen. “What happened?”
“It’s not your fault” Draco whispers looking deep into Harry’s eyes before slowly lowering his gaze to the ground.
After ordering and taking his hot chocolate, he makes his way to where Potter is sat. “Hello Potter” he greets sitting in front of him in an armchair
Harry huffs while Draco narrows his eyes at them. Ron and Hermione share a look and continue to chuckle.
They enter the store and glance around at all the bed frames scattered neatly across the large store room. They walk towards where the sofa beds are and glance around at their options.
Narcissa sighs. “Why don’t you go to a wizarding healer, they’re more reliable and this is my grandchild we’re talking about, i want the best for them”
Potter lowers his head forcing Draco to look at him. “Everything will be alright, take deep breaths”
Potter's forest-green eyes look up to him. “Hi Malfoy,” he says before narrowing his eyes. “Don’t you know you should ask before sitting at someone's table”
Draco grasps his stomach and drops to the floor leaning over the toilet and vomiting. Draco wipes away tears forming in his eyes, as he stands wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and making his way to where the pregnancy tests lay
“Yes it is, I didn't fight back, I should've fought back,” he exclaims. “I may have died but at least i wouldn’t have to deal with this now”
“Play your cards right and you won’t” Narcissa states before turning around and strolling back into the room
Draco smirks. “I see you’re as graceful as ever, bumping into people and making them spill their milk”
“Let me put the shopping away first” Draco says but in reality he just wants to procrastinate telling her the news.
Harry leaves the room and makes his way to his bedroom. Opening the door, he spots Draco who looks up from his book and then puts it away saying "How did it go?"
Draco sighs picking at one of the baby shirts with a deep frown, thoughts whirling across his head. “I understand, but I want nothing to do with this thing, so leave me out of it please, i don’t want to go clothes shopping nor do anything to do with the baby”
“My therapist said she’d talk to her colleagues, and if none want to take you on, she would.” he says. “She’s a witch and i trust her so i guess it counts for something”
As he fumbles to click the piece together, Draco bites his lip until the pendant is clipped around his neck. He fumbles with the pendant, trailing his hands over the outlines of the M. “Thank you” he smiles
Ron frowns with a thoughtful hum. "I don't know man. And don't worry, therapists have a legal obligation to keep things confidential. I'll talk to my therapist who's a witch about you needing one and I'll see what they say--only if you're actually up to seeing one and won't chicken out last minute"
It’s not until loud ringing slices through the silence, startling both Draco and Narcissa out of their thoughts. Like a baby deer, Draco stumbles to a stand, and with the help of his mother, he stands and makes his way to the bedroom where his phone lays.
Draco sighs, dropping the letter onto the table. Glancing at the time, his eyes widen. “Shit,” he curses. “I’m going to be late”
Draco smirks. “Well well well,” he hums. “If i didn’t know any better i’d say you’re worried and care about me”
“You can get through this,” Narcissa cups Draco's face once again, tears swelling in her own eyes as she looks at her son and sees how much he’s hurting. “Darling i’m so sorry about everything i put you through, just please be strong, if not for yourself then for me, i can’t live without you”
Dr Jones uncrosses her legs and leans forward. "Did anything else happen that you want to talk about?"
At that exact moment Hermione threw the door open. "Did I just hear you say you don't know any spells?
Not sure if this was already known, but I'm not British. I'll try to do the best I can, but no promises. (LJ: Maiwiz)
"This isn't the time for making threats, Black. You know as well as I do what we do for the Order. But why you're out of Azkaban and Dumbledore hides you alludes me sometimes." Snape said. Black moved to point his wand at Snape and in that moment Remus went to stop him and Snape held up his own wand, Pettigrew transformed back to a rat and ran into the woods. Harry screamed as he saw him disappear in the dark woods where he surely would be able to apparate away. They stopped fighting, and saw with horror that he was indeed gone. Sirius began to curse while Remus shook his head.
"Harry!" Draco yelped as Harry's grip tightened and he pulled Draco down on top of him, only just managing to lay down without getting himself a paper cut. Draco could hardly breathe, they hadn't gone past the shirts-off phase, and it made Draco squirm just thinking about if for Harry it was different. He hadn't heard of anything explicit had happened while Ginerva and him were in a relationship, but he hadn't pressed on it for obvious reasons. Harry shook him out of his thoughts by pulling his shirt off him and throwing it onto Draco's bed. "Merlin." Harry growled and Draco almost wet himself.
Draco followed Harry out of the car as Harry had abruptly got out to pace out in the woods. "Merlin's pants, Harry, please get back in the car!" Draco yelled, feeling like he was dealing with one of the angry peacocks back at his estate. Except this time, this 'peacock' could do more than bite. Draco wondered about the full extent of Harry's power as Harry caused a tree to blanch away from him. Was it true that he contained part of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? "Did you do that? Wait-Did you just say Merlin?" Harry asked, stopping in front of the now bent tree. "No. And yes, I did. It's a wizard expression. You could use it if you want." Draco began, before stopping himself.
Draco didn't realize it was a joke and stared at him intensely for a moment. He then opened the door to the car so Harry could change out of his robes without Draco's lecherous arse watching. "Right. You should go change. I don't want you to crumple up my robes." Draco tried, before looking off into the other direction. Harry just got closer to him. "What's wrong? Did what happened to me scare you off that much?" Harry asked, looking more disappointed than Draco ever wanted to see him. Draco wanted to say something, really, but Harry's face was a bit too close to his, and what would it do if Draco wasn't to kiss him for it?
Draco decided to ignore it for now. If she was a squib- and there was nothing wrong with that, Draco shook himself before he looked disdained, she likely did not know about Harry at all. "Alright then. Are you here to attack me?" Draco asked, already walking off. Black kept in pace. "No. Just here to see what he was so obsessed with." Draco felt his stomach warm.
Harry, mouth gaping, was left with a sound “What happened to our jokes?” Draco, quite done with being left clueless, asked accusingly, “Does anyone mind telling me what’s going on here?” George grinned solemnly, and a dimple appeared through his shave. “Sorry Harry, but now that Draco’s investing, I’ve got room to invest in a bit of my own.” Draco, shocked beyond comprehension, still found room to talk. “Invest? What are you bloody well talking about?” Harry let out a squeak as George whipped his hand back and pulled out a large cone. “This is a spirit stick.” Draco blinked dumbly, and Harry wondered if he was seriously regretting choosing Harry’s surrogate family as an investment.
It then went on to talk about various accounts who’ve claimed to see the couple-them-he meant. He didn’t know how long he spent looking at it, shaking. He didn’t know why it came as such a surprise that they would eventually be outed. But, he thought it would be them against the world. It was an idiotic thing to think. Father would likely be ashamed. Even more than he already was.
Draco kicked back his feet on the Potions table and hummed with delight. Blaise was in this class this time, so he now had a competent partner to do his bidding while providing useless commentary. The teacher growled -he hadn’t been listening when the loser said his name- but did nothing. Spineless Ravenclaw. He could practically smell it on him. He felt alive after all the Potter-torturing yesterday, even if there was a lot less yelling than there used to be.
"I can't believe you just acted as if kissing me was a inconvenience for you." Draco said angrily. Knowing he had just angered the beast, Harry tried to slide away, but Draco stopped him. "Don't even try it. What's the matter with you?" Draco asked, peering into Harry's glasses as if the answer was actually visible in his eyes. Which it wasn't. Harry liked to think he was brooding at all times. "Nothing. You're just very trying sometimes." Harry said, crossing his arms. "Oh bollocks. You're in a mood and I want to know why." Draco insisted, making Harry meet his eyes again. Draco didn't have to drag him by the collar, but it sure felt like it.
progress, but Harry was beginning to wonder if Draco was purposely making it harder for himself. He kept telling Draco to think of his best memory, but he kept thinking of things that just didn't cut it. Draco was smarter than this, Harry knew, he was just doing this to postpone Harry. Which was pissing Harry off, but he wasn't going to let it get to him. This time. He just had to focus on finding time outside of it to train.
Draco spit out, as Ron also knew about the Blood Pact Draco was planning to make with Harry once he got him to trust him. "You will have no choice but to trust in Draco, Mr. Weasley." Snape told him.
Harry shuffled his feet beside the Victorian-style Greek house indignantly, waiting for the hail to stop. The awning above him was being assaulted, and Harry wondered how long it was going to last. He took one for the team and put up a protective charm. He could apparate, but he wasn’t looking forward to being beat down with hail on his way to the dorm. A robbery had occurred and there were even more protections put in place, now you had to apparate a mile away from the building. Harry didn’t quite want to.
it's time for your arse to hit the hay." Draco smiled down at Harry, who's bulkiness trumped Draco's sense of flight. There was no escaping this embarrassment.
“Okay, want to explain what happened to our plans? I hope you don’t bring along uninvited guests on your dates with the she-weasel.” Potter made a sound between a whimper and a groan and sunk back into his seat. “First off, Lovegood was busy being lovesick with some Rolf Scamander. Second, don’t call Ginerva she-weasel. Third, Hermione found out, inevitably.” Draco hummed at the Scamander fact. At least someone in Potter’s posse had taste. But then scowled at the two next facts. He could see this exciting mystery dissolving into a bout of annoying homework.
"Don't feel bad. Even I am stressed from my own beauty sometimes." Harry crossed his arms as Draco smoothed out his hair. Stupid, arrogant, too pretty for his own good prat. Harry really wanted to punch him at times like these. "Some of us don't spend all our valuable time doing our bloody hair in the mornings." Harry fired back. "Oh Harry. Why are you so jealous? I could do your hair, you know." Draco smirked. Harry subconsciously scratched his hair, which he was sure was in all directions by now. Draco noticed it too, and took his wand just to smooth it out. "I could teach you that, but I doubt it'll work for long." Draco laughed.
Draco was... easily the most haughty, attractive person at the whole ball. And it irritated Harry to no end. But what really drove it home was Draco's bangs, which was normally slicked back, was flowing supernaturally through the air is if compelled. And it probably was, knowing Draco's abilities. He was also wearing almost completely black, with only silver cuffs and a tie. Cheeky bastard. "Harry. He greeted, and Harry, really feeling the compulsion himself, stood up, and Draco stood right by him as if it were natural and Harry didn't currently feel as if he were sick to his stomach. Best not throw up on Draco, though. He didn't think he'd like that.
me sometimes." Draco turned to Harry. "Okay, maybe I'll kill her too. But Draco, you can't go over there anymore. You have to stay away from the manor, and your father." "No!" Draco jerked away. "I don't have a choice, Harry. He'll hurt my family if I do. He'll hurt everyone." Draco shook. Harry put a hand on Draco's face and caressed it. "You don't have to do anything. I'll take care of him for you."
Harry saw Malfoy hanging back from the crowd and walked over to him. He didn’t say anything, just stood next to Malfoy and, when it was time, sang the Happy Birthday song. Malfoy was shooting looks at Harry from the corner of his eye, but otherwise didn’t acknowledge him.
“He bloody well would,” Malfoy grumbled, not quite under his breath. Malfoy Vanished the tea in his cup and said, “I wouldn’t offer that swill to an American and they don’t know shit about tea. Did you know? They sometimes drink it cold. On
On one of the few calls he’d been sent out for since the incident and Roberts’ house, he’d ended up just outside Knockturn Alley. As he was explaining to an elderly witch that higher than usual prices for beetle wings didn’t actually count as robbery, a flyer caught his eye. Posted in a grimy window of a specialty clothing shop, a small, yellowed parchment read:
“Kreacher is not hiding! Kreacher is being very busy with – with,” he searched for inspiration and failed. “I is being a very busy elf,” he finished insistently.
“Seems there was an accomplice this time. Average height, dark hair, mostly obscured. Not much to go on.” Robards looked Harry in the eye menacingly.
It was a relief to unlace his trousers and pull himself out. His eyes fluttered shut on the first slow stroke he gave himself. He worked himself up and down leisurely for a few minutes. Opening his eyes again, he found Potter avidly following the movement of his hand and his cock at full hardness.
The man next to Neville stepped forward and Harry recognized Amycus Carrow. There was a cruel look on his face as he eyed Ginny up and down.
It could have been someone in the surging muggle support movement. Muggle was trendy these days. Wizards were bending over backward to show how much they loved muggles. It wasn't impossible that someone could try to prove themselves by "punishing" a blood purist like Malfoy.
Again, Harry blinked. Her son? Malfoy? Draco Malfoy? The body she held couldn’t be him. It was too small, too… broken. The limbs looked twisted and misshapen, the fabric covering the limp form too ragged and torn.
He managed to squeeze himself into the clothes and headed back downstairs. Entering the sitting room, he tried not to whine as he complained, “these don’t fit.”
Harry’s face went slack as the shirt hit him in the chest and fell to the floor. It was not better. It was so much worse. Harry’s eyes locked on the line of hair that trailed from Malfoy’s bellybutton and disappeared into his trousers. He could just see the very top of indentations that formed what Harry’s brain decided would be a sculpted V, pointing toward Malfoy’s prick.
Regaining his balance, Harry looked to the bed and then felt a deep flush sweep up his neck and cover his face with heat. More of Malfoy was visible now. Much more. The only thing still covered was his head, where it was buried under a pillow. From shoulder blades to toes, Malfoy was naked.
A proud, smug smile graced Malfoy’s lips. “I have been so fine, in fact, that I was able to figure out the Ear-Bugs.”
Frustrated, Harry swept the surrounding street for movement. Nothing. And none of his spells had hit a target.
He hadn’t expected Narcissa to be so early, but as soon as he saw that it was her, the fog in his brain and the tired feeling behind his eyes evaporated.
Cautiously, Harry opened the door. The sight that greeted him froze him in place. On his door step, disheveled and slumped around a body was Narcissa Malfoy. Her eyes rose to meet his and Harry stared back in stupefaction.
He had a wonderful life. A Malfoy-free life. He tested products for George, went out with his mates on the weekends, and generally, lived a nice, quiet life. Now, he was saddled with the git and was probably going to be an accessory to murder if the look Narcissa had worn as she left was any gauge.
“He’s going to tell me what he knows. He’s always been a conniving bastard, you know he has. We need to know why he’s here.”
A series of memories involving all the times he and Malfoy had insulted, punched, or hexed each other flashed through Harry’s mind and he found himself at a loss as to where to begin contradicting her.
“It was… the air felt heavy. I felt like someone was watching me,” Harry described. “What does this have to do with anything?”
Malfoy grabbed the teapot gleefully and poured himself a cup. He was about to set it back down when he glanced at Harry. With extreme nonchalance that was obviously fake, he summoned another cup and filled it too. Then he roughly shoved it across the table, sloshing tea over the sides as it stopped in front of Harry.
“Hermione,” he said, mimicking her speech, “good morning. I see you’ve met my houseguest. Can I assume you’ve spoken with Ginny?”
Harry was left reeling. What the fuck? Who reacted like that? Roberts was an accountant for fuck’s sake.
Harry fell back onto the armchair and pulled Malfoy with him. Malfoy held Harry’s cock as he sank easily onto it. He moaned loudly and hissed, “
It was nothing like flying. People where all around him, he felt closed in, and everything was loud.
Ginny had pity in her eyes as she said, “you’re always trying to be there for everyone. You can’t save him, Harry. He doesn’t deserve to be saved.” She softly placed her hand on his cheek. “He’ll use you if he can, you know that.” She brought her mouth to his and whispered, “let me save you this time. I’ll make him leave.”
Rules? Approached for what? What was off-putting? Harry felt like he was missing a huge part of the conversation but tried not to let it show as he casually asked, “what did he want to play?”
Are you going to his birthday party? He’s going to be five!” She held up her hand to show how many that was.
Harry was excited to get home and open up his new toys. Malfoy disappeared into the library and Harry settled himself into the sitting room with his bags.
With quick strides Narcissa strode to Malfoy and took his face in her hands. “What have you gotten yourself into?”
Before Harry could respond, she was striding off toward the group of older ladies. Thankfully, Malfoy had left that particular group and Harry spotted him talking to a delighted, blond headed Teddy.
“Safe? Here with me? You realize we’ve tried to kill each other?” Harry was growing a bit frantic at the idea of Malfoy as his house guest for an undisclosed amount of time.
hunch says there’s something we don’t know.” Harry felt his temper slipping. “If I could just get in there, I know I could –“
to watch over me.” Sneering, Malfoy rose more slowly this time, barely wavering at all. “I’m leaving. Give me my clothes.”
“Mmm,” Malfoy hummed, “I think I could develop one.” Slowly, he rose up and Harry’s prick slipped out of him. He looked over to his disarrayed computers and said, “well, we did a number on…”
Kreacher vanished and Malfoy set to his stew expeditiously. He dropped his spoon into an empty bowl and stood only minutes after he’d sat down.  “Owl your secret mistress and tell her to meet you at ten. Only old people go out at seven on a Friday night. I need to go get ready."
Malfoy spoke while addressing a spot just above and to the left of Harry’s head, “your elf told me about the condition I arrived in. And it seems that was
The building, when Harry found it, wasn’t much. The windows were blacked out, the dark paint was peeling, and the only thing telling Harry he was in the right place was a small wooden sign featuring a black rose and reading
Harry hastily stood. “I think it’s time we headed back. Thank you for having us over, Mrs. Weasley.”
“I promised. You should have seen – He was –” Harry trailed off remembering the blood and Narcissa’s pained expression.
Pale skin. Smooth curves. Lean muscles. The risk of seeing it every day, forever and responding in ways Harry wasn't comfortable with. This bizarre fascination and the way his brain seemed determined to fixate on it would drive him crazy.
This was ridiculous. They were probably petty thieves or dabbled in illicit brews and thought it made them cool. They didn’t know anything about him or anything else. He was wasting his time. Robards was right and Harry was leaving.
“Let me see that.” George brushed by Harry and grabbed the parchment. Malfoy relinquished it with smug satisfaction.
“What happened? What’s wrong?” Harry’s heart was beating rapidly, and his chest heaved as he came skidding to a stop in the doorway.
Harry was showing himself out when she stopped him. “And Harry lad? Do be sure to thank me grandniece if you see her again, for that drink she bought you at the pub today.” She winked at him as the door closed in his face.
embarrassing stroll through my memories, and I’m going to meet my five-year-old cousin tomorrow amidst, what I can only assume, will be a crowd of people who don’t particularly like me. We are going to stop for coffee and then we are going to find the best gift ever given to any child anywhere because I can’t do anything about being stuck with you for the duration and I will not wallow endlessly in this house until I die of old age.”
had been a nightmare. Andromeda took it with the grace of a woman who had already raised one Metamorphamagi, but Harry had practically gone spar the one time it had happened on his watch.
Everyone else in the DMLE office was working industriously. Quills scratched, papers shuffled, and Harry was ready to bang his head on the desk out of sheer boredom. Every so often, a head would pop up and the Auror would quickly confer with their partner before bending back to their task.
“Wait, I wanted to ask about the fellyfones with the lines. Do owls travel through the strings? Is that what they’re for? How does that work if there are no strings?”
Blinking, Harry waved his hand toward the back of the house and said mechanically, “library is down the hall. Kitchen is that way. Bathroom is up the stairs, first door on your left. Kreacher will make up the guest bed next to it. Dinner is usually around seven. I’m going to my study.”
Harry tried, he really did. But every movement he made felt clumsy and awkward. He accidentally bumped into someone and received a dirty look. Giving up, Harry stopped the jerky steps he’d been making and turned back toward his table.
“Not,” Malfoy interrupted, “that kind of noise.” He straddled Harry and ground his arse onto his lap. “I can feel your cock through all those layers of official ministry robes. You must be so hard. Did you enjoy watching me work?”
The line for the Women’s was ridiculously long and Mary wasn’t in it. She could have been inside, but Harry was starting to doubt it. As he reached the Men’s room door, it opened, and Mark came out. He stopped suddenly when he saw Harry.
Harry decided to Apparate several blocks from his house and take a long walk home. He mulled over Emilia’s parting words with frustration. She’d known it was him at the pub. Did her grandniece know she’d blown a kiss at Harry Potter or was Emilia playing her cards close to the chest? Was she having him followed? How many aliases did she know about?
Sure enough, Draco always had the most to-die-for wizard's attire a wizard could wish for, and could it be so different for Muggle clothes? Snape did not give him an answer, instead dumping a bag of clothes on his desk for Draco to grab. "I hope this doesn't
Draco pulled his knees to his chest and huffed out a breath. Finance was arse, the lot of it. Really, who knew studying corporate investing was so damn hard? Apparently, it was, at least according to Draco. He found himself secretly fiddling with several potions inside of his robe instead of working. And it was just so dreadfully boring. Not the kind of boring where Draco could laugh with his friends over some inane thing, this boring involved dead quiet and non-distracting working was just not Draco’s strong suit.
Draco straightened up the box that was crooked on the stage and smiled at his progress. Roger was laying out several fireworks, most of which Draco recognized from George and Fred’s stint back at Hogwarts. There were some new ones, gold striped in color, with a silver band that begged to be lit. A mischievous smirk fought to be on Draco’s face. “Easy there!” Roger shouted, and Draco noticed that he still had his hand on the wand and the box had almost fell off the stage.
Harry smiled awkwardly at Ginny, who had cut her hair back to a straight bob in a effort to look older, but Harry thought she looked even younger with it. She had made a joke that Harry would have laughed at if he was still in school, but had lost its charm as he had spent more and more time in the outside world. He made a
"Do you agree with them then? Think I'm some wild beast who got rid of my son?" Draco said angrily. Harry had messed up. Again. He must have thought Harry was stepping away because he thought Draco was a threat. Well, he did think Draco was a threat... but not like that. "No, not at all. Just ask Hermione. We've been calling to everyone we can to release you." Harry put his hand on the bar, trying to show Draco a sign of trust that he had ruined before. "But you have no proof that it wasn't me. Scorpius still hasn't been found." Draco said, his voice edging on desperation. "I know that. But I have faith in you, Draco. I have since we were kids."
Like full on." Harry told him. Draco looked confused. "You're seeing things. My eyes are just gray."
“Don’t be a spoil-sport.” Harry joked and waved at George from behind the counter. He was wiping off a plastic container with something practically hairy inside, and Draco was almost afraid to ask. “Hello, Harry! Hello, Draco.” Draco waved as well. “I’ve made some process.” Harry traveled over to the counter almost automatically, and Draco sighed before following. “What progress?” Harry asked curiously as ever. George put the object back under the counter and Draco sighed in relief. “I’ve got new games in mind, and Ireland has already signed off on the deal.” George grinned and put his hands onto the counter and leaned forward.
“Draco! Hey, love!” Harry said, holding open the door with one hand and wiping a cold sweat from his forehead. He was wearing the cute beanie Draco had picked out for himself- and boy, if that did not make a warm feeling in his stomach. “’Hey’ and ‘Love’ are muggle words, Harry.” Draco scowled half-heartedly and went over to hug him, not caring in the moment that anyone might see.
Draco sat on Blaise’s purple leather couch, the one he had miraculously smuggled past campus security. He was thumbing a striking poster, put together by Blaise himself. “Aren’t fraternities a bit… muggle?” Draco laughed. Blaise held his hands up. “Why Draco, didn’t you hear? Muggle is in now.” Justin piped up from his position on his very decorative orange bed. “Isn’t it a great idea? I always wanted to join one when I was a kid!” He then went back to his pop-listening on his ear-what’s-its.
Muggle outer wear was in more than ever, and while Draco would never understand why one would wear a skinny jacket instead of a warm cloak, it was all the rage for everyone else, including his half-blood boyfriend. Yeah, he called him his boyfriend sometimes in his head. Don’t judge him. He finished the jingle bell wrapping paper and collapsed in a heap on his comforter, pulling his cloak tighter around him. It was freezing and Merlin knew why Harry was out and about in the first place, and it didn’t help that the wintry weather had inspired his illness in the first place.
Harry squeezed Draco’s leg and hid a smile under that head of hair. Dean was ecstatic, saying he could just kiss Draco’s pointy face and that thank Merlin he was Harry’s roommate, but Draco was too busy staring at Harry. Harry looked up and gave him a big grin, the one where his face stretched and his eyes squinted. This frat idea was making him into a loser, Draco thought. A very whipped, very close to falling loser.
happen. Scorpius was just allowed to go off on his own, Albus said, and had just gone to Hogsmeade. And then he was gone.
actually. Draco didn't consider the forced kisses Pansy had planted on him real. Harry didn't know this, however. And even though it was a bit of a compliment that Harry assumed that Draco had experience, it still annoying the Merlin's bloody pants out of him that he had to bring it up while Draco was hiding from people.
Now, they were pushed together whether Draco liked it or not, in Ron’s dorm room while Nott was out with his chess club. Harry had never heard of a chess club, and had spent most of the time (while Hermione’s back was turned) chatting with Ron about the possibility of joining together. “…And Harry, I’ve prepared some cards for when it’s your turn for a statement. We’re going to go over them together.” Harry groaned, and Ron looked at him with understanding. He had gone through worse before. “What kind of statement?” Harry asked, hesitantly.
Draco shook his head warmly. "Your son is just as much of a monster when it comes to surviving things, when it comes to what Scorpius and your son James puts him through." They were bantering. Without anything ruining anything. Harry's heart soared. He
Harry looked at him with shock, and Draco marveled in his own Slytherin power to be able to answer something that the other person was thinking in their head. Draco wondered if Harry would be a Slytherin. "You got me. I looked it up. But that was only after I remembered how insistent you were to talk sometime again." Draco was about to answer seriously before he realized that Harry was making fun of him. It should have infuriated him, and perhaps it would have, had Harry been anyone else, Malfoy's would never stand for such insolence, but he found it increasingly hard to be anything but appreciative of who-and
"You mean after the Dueling Club? Hufflepuffs are nothing but gutless back-stabbers, I thought I told you that already." Draco said harshly. Boys Draco couldn't even remember the names of blowing Harry off or giving him looks. He didn't get why Harry cared. Draco only cared about what the important people thought, but that seemed to be everyone for Harry. "It's not that I like all of them. I'd just appreciate it if they stopped treating me like Merlin, Merlin's pants." Draco snickered and Harry groaned. Draco knew he could be considered one of them, but he wouldn't treat Harry like he was perfect. Draco knew much better than that. Harry eventually chuckled at Draco's behavior.
"Well, your father doesn't trust me either. And yet you trust me." Harry rebutted. "Well, you're different,
I wanted to give you guys a sweet epilogue, as well as the first chapter for the next volume, which will be as cool as this one, I promise! (LJ: Maiwiz) {June}
Harry expected a lot more action than he was getting. Currently in Magical Forensic Science, which was just a fancy name for Potions, he thought, he was sitting in a lab desk next to Ron who was groaning loudly, having mistakenly mixed the wrong Finder potion with the evidence the 3rd time in a row. “I know Auror training is intensive, but I prefer the running to the studies, mate.” Harry laughed at Ron’s poor predicament. Their ‘Recruitment’ was on Mondays, which was a version of boot camp but with less camo and more uncomfortable and hot robes in various wilderness.
Harry had owled him before and they remained unanswered. Draco just didn't want to bother him. He wasn't even sure Harry felt the same way about him that he did. Harry had lots of suitors- he saw how Cho and now Ginerva Weasley looked at him. Why would he stick around for someone who had to clean his house of dark artifacts? Again, he wasn't worthy. So he was shocked when Harry eventually came to Draco's front door. "The wards are disabled. Do you know how dangerous that is?" He had asked once Draco had opened the door. It was true, Draco had managed to dismantle them all after the war. It was darkly done as well.
do. I say hello like a polite individual." Harry mocked. Draco wanted to jinx Harry's head off. Sure, when he was with
“That’s me.” The ghostly voice contrasted strikingly with Colin’s old squeaky one, and Harry started. Draco looked aghast too, and mumbled “So, more like a portrait than an actual mirror…” Leaving Malfoy to figure out the calculations in his head, Harry turned back to the mirror. It was Colin. He could feel it in his gut, and the boy had the spot-on smile. “How did you get into this mirror, Colin?” Harry asked. Colin’s smile dissipated. “It’s kind of a long story…”
“Oh, it’s terrible! Truly terrible!” He shook out, putting the flip phone under his ear. “The preparations, they haven’t been sent yet!” Draco didn’t know what this meant, but apparently Harry did, as he groaned and stepped closer. “Why wouldn’t George send them?” Anthony seemed to calm a bit at this sense of rationality and shook his head. “I think he said something about a Championship.”
Harry turned back and offered Hermione puppy eyes. "Pretty please help me with the essay part? I haven't got a clue for what to say to the 'My mark on the world' part."
When he got into the murder contraption Harry gave him a smile as if it were perfectly normal to ask for a drive around a muggle dangerous neighborhood. Draco was already wracking his brain for possibly enchantments he could use on muggles in case Harry revealed his power or... Draco didn't want to think about that. "You're a decent driver, right?" Draco asked instead of greeting him. "Of course. I have a natural way with cars." Harry responded, but with a grin on his face, which Draco knew by now was not to be taken seriously. He put his seat belt on in a hurry as Harry drove off. "Where are we even going?" Draco asked, wondering what Harry was thinking when he suggested driving around.
Uncorking the red and tipping it over so it would slime its way across the floor, Draco watched as it slowly became a mirage like a boggart, except it was rigged to be a siren, wailing loudly in the middle of the floor, distracting his classmates long enough for Draco to rid any evidence pointing to himself with a green cleaning potion. The professor, irate and a little terrified, put his hands to his ears and screamed to make it stop. Several of the nerdy students were hurriedly looking through books, Draco snorted, but it was his job to take the responsibility.
Draco spotted Harry when he got off the landing. Dressed in loose swim shorts that looked like they were bought off the clearance isle, old flip-flops that were tearing at the corners, and a baseball cap with a metal band that probably belonged to Sirius Black beforehand. "You sure clean up nicely." Harry told him, lounging on the couch with his feet kicked up on the coffee table like a pig with no manners. Of course, Harry somehow made his whole ensemble with no thought involved look handsome. "Thank you." Draco answered, biting his cheek to keep a blush from heating up. "Now get your feet off my poor mother's coffee table." Draco bit out. Harry rolled his eyes and dropped them to the floor. "Are you finally ready, princess?"
What he found almost surprised him. There was a crisp portfolio with artwork inside! Harry knew that Draco liked to craft, but was he seriously considering being an artist? He’d gone into business, hadn’t he? He flipped through the folder, and was impressed with Draco’s work. How batty, to say that he was impressed by him! Stopping the internal monologue, Harry continued the look-through, picking a good favorite in one piece, that was a small white fox sleeping in a ball peacefully in a bush in wood area Harry guessed was the Manor’s woods. There seemed to be a common occurrence in the drawings, all were sketches, and barely any had color.
Harry didn't have to be told twice, whisking over to try and see through the crack in the door. He probably saw wizards agonizing over potions, as when he turned back he didn't look as happy. "That looks incredibly boring." Harry commented, and Draco couldn't help but laugh. "Yes, that's OWLS class for you." Harry looked at him in confusion. "It's like college preparatory." Draco told him. Harry rolled his eyes. "Of course you'd like something incredibly snobbish." Harry mocked. "Hey! Way to thank someone who's skipping class for you!" Draco complained, pushing Harry. "Oh, and you call me the brute." Harry said back, bumping him.
Harry awoke the next day with a major headache and his back half asleep on a box in the worker's room at the Universal Championships. He groaned, stretched and wondered how he got to be on the box in the first place.
He was thankful for spending his free time flying when he got onto the broom while only shaking once. Draco had already gone off by now, he was supposed to meet him by the portkey point. Harry wasn't gleeful about having to kill a Peruvian Vipertooth, as they were apparently known for being lovely human-eaters. But with the combined forces of them, Harry figured they could kill it off without much fleeing from a hungry dragon. Merlin. Draco really got the worst of them. When he finally got there, Harry could see Draco shared his thinking, holding his arms close to this chest with worry across his face.
No, he had to be mistaken. Could he really hear breathing this far away? No, that definitely was breathing. Harry looked back completely to see that the breathing started getting quieter, and realized why. There was a
“Look who it is. Harry Potter!” A familiar voice called out and Harry turned to see Blaise stand half-in half-out the wooden doors.  “Zabini.” He grunted and tried to not get a future migraine. “Is that anyway to address your boyfriend’s best mate?” Blaise said, in his trademark surprised voice. “Why aren’t you in the party?” Harry sighed and leaned back against an awning pole. “Because they hog me like flies and Draco is home sick and even though he said to go on without him, I want to make sure that prat is okay.”
“I’m sorry, Harry. So, so, sorry…” Draco cried, beginning to break down from the stress. Once the internship company saw this bad publicity, his chance at anything other than managing his Father’s name was gone. And with it, the small respect he had gained back from Britain, as he had now ‘enchanted’ the Chosen one. Harry got up urgently and smooshed him with a mind-numbing snog. “Please don’t cry, Draco, you mess up your hair when you do.” Draco gasped from laughter and indignation as Harry wound his fingers through Draco’s fine-done hair, and Harry pulled back in. Draco heard the door close but didn’t acknowledge it.
He was probably the most morning person at Hogwarts. He would be up before any of the other Slytherins, chatting loudly until all the others would come up angrily until Draco’s endless charm or endless intimidation would set in. But now, all he had was himself and his loneliness. Oh, and Potter.
Draco's hands had moved from Harry's chin to his messy hair. Harry's own hands were now resting firmly on Draco's chest, like he didn't know what to do with them. If it was not for uncontrollable lust, Draco wouldn't know how to kiss either. The only time he had ever been kissed was-regrettably,- by both Blaise and Pansy in a disgusting game of Spin the Bottle. This did not feel disgusting. When Harry finally pulled away, Draco wanted to faint. "Okay, that was... unexpected." Harry said. Draco blushed,
Snape, said in a sharp voice behind him. Draco briefly registered a vial sitting precariously on the desk before swinging around and knocking it off, causing it to crash and break on the floor. At this, everyone who had been previously making glances were now full-on staring.
"Ladies, if you are done conversing, they are finishing." He nodded to the stage as Harry left the podium and stood by the side with Granger and Weasley. He admired the way Harry handled his composure, something Draco could have never done. As a child, he dreamed of being the one everyone payed attention to, now he feared it like no other. Mother and Pansy were already collecting their bearings, probably gearing up for some suspicious glances and sneers, something that would never go away. Draco himself dug in his briefcase, looking for the admission paper in the clutter. Mother wanted him to go, and there was no question that there'd be no arguing, as she had that look. But he was still not done with the 'My mark on the world' part. Because really, what did he have to offer?
to focus on the preliminaries notes, scratching off the to-do list and keeping an eye on any glitches in the program, but the rowdiness of the team was distracting him from his perched spot on a forgotten box pile left by a frazzled Dean Thomas.
After Draco had bored himself of Harry's lips, they had agreed to test the cold waters off Kent's beach. Draco had clinged to Harry as they walked into it, and Harry had to tighten his toes on the ocean sand to keep from falling over once or twice. Draco had cracked multiple jokes of this being like swimming in Ronald's lake last year, and Harry had shushed him while laughing too. Draco had insisted on taking pictures, so Harry held him steady while the blonde took snapshots of the ocean with an antique camera and then a snapshot of Harry's brooding face while Harry was busy watching their towels and property. Draco had eventually grew tired of his muggle DIY, and they had dried off with their towel when Draco had spotted a ice-cream shop.
Harry felt significantly smaller than he already was as they walked out into a crowded shopping area. The shopping area wasn't what captured his focus though. It was the huge castle that Harry could see if he squinted in his round glasses, and four smaller castles near it making the shape of a pentagon. Out of all his years sitting on his aunt's apple tree, he had
Harry hurled himself onto his bed, half-remembering that he could use a levitation charm, and half-not giving a shit, just in time to fall back-first onto the mattress with the books on top of his stomach. “You great oaf.” Malfoy said, scoffing and hiding a laugh. “Ever heard of levitation?” Harry wanted to point out that he did, thank you very much- but found that it would be heard on deaf ears. He knew he looked a picture, a short half-man with books taller than himself. But it would be nice not to be reminded.
“I mean really, do you two ever quit it?” She huffed and plunked the stack on the poor table that had sent two rapidly inclining heads back to their seats. Harry smiled sick-sweet at Hermione. “What did you find?” Hermione sent a look that she was totally not bought by his treatment. “Not that you were any help, but I found several cases relating to the mirror of the Creevy fellow. I bookmarked them and stacked them by relevance. Oh, and Harry, do consult your girlfriend,” -Harry winced- “and maybe tell her that one of her dearest friends was found stuck in a mirror? You can’t put her off forever, Harry. But I should go now, since apparently I’m not wanted.” She glared at Malfoy before going off into the direction of the girl’s dorms.
"What? But, your own family..." Draco started. Harry thought he would feel the need to interrupt Draco various times this evening. "They are still my family. But you are my family too, Draco, with your son who survived off gas station food and ambition, and even your mother who resides in this very manor, ignoring me at this time." Harry said knowingly. "Don't think he'll get away with this. He took his allowance and used it for idiotic purposes such as revenge. And even tricked a
There were multiple cats in the household, which she had rubbed once or twice, and Harry had to admit he was quite enamored with the black one. It was a full kneazle, and had green eyes so it was only natural. Mrs. Malfoy practically cooed at that fact and Harry thought that she would have snapped pictures if she had such muggle contraptions in her home. There was a crack and Malfoy had flooed in, dusting off his trousers and scaring the poor cat on his lap.
Harry decided that he couldn't stand by while the adults he loved worked alone, possibly hurting themselves in the process. So he decided to make his own group. His own order. When he asked his Gryffindor friends, they were more pleased then expected. Umbridge had been a living hell on all of them, and they all wanted to do something against the rules for once. So he enlisted more and more people,
Harry had been learning how to be a wizard for forever now, he thought. Where was the action, for Merlin's sake? All he seemed to learn was basic potions and spells. He wanted to actually learn something that would make a difference... maybe even something that would get You-Know-Who, the wizard who had killed his parents and tried to kill him, gone for good. But when he had asked Ron, he had clammed up and said such a thing didn't exist. A way to kill You-Know-Who didn't come from potions class. So Harry thought of a new plan. Ron had been learning for a long time now, long enough that he had
"Alright then. Five. And you better not be late, or I'm leaving." Draco huffed and moved to Harry's side, as if he were a pet getting told off. Harry groaned as Draco plopped down on the other couch, the one Harry was sitting on. And of course, he left no breathing room. "Do we have to do this now?" Harry asked, not wanting to snog the annoying Slytherin. They had been doing that a lot of that, mindless snogging with no explanation afterwards. Of course there was the whole love thing, but didn't that include
Lily was quiet and observant like Luna too, and Harry found himself missing her. They barely talked since Luna was a year behind Harry, something Harry often forgot. “Don’t brush my mane like that, you’ll tangle it.” The Centaur groaned and Harry hurriedly changed the brushing pattern. Lily was busy polishing his hooves, and the Centaur, with its lovely white horse body and arrogant streak, reminded Harry very much of Malfoy. His name was Zeke, which helped.
Draco stuck a inked quill in his ear while occupying his hand with a very difficult scratch at the top of his neck. Just as he was about to find the sweet spot, The quill fell out of his ear and onto the table with a thud. Draco cursed as he felt the ink seep through his hair with a quick sweep of his fingers to the hair above his hair. Great, just great. Draco thought. His concentration was off ever since he hadn’t had to look double while crossing the street, even though it might have seemed as if the opposite should be occurring. He could tell his Accounting professor- and his elbow partner- weren’t having it.
Draco held in a laugh successfully. Oh, was Luna the loony one indeed. Rolf looked confused, and Draco tried to rack his brain to see if Rolf went to Hogwarts or not. He couldn’t remember anyone past Slytherin’s and Harry’s little gang. His life did seem to revolve around him. “I’m-I’m” Greg started. Draco turned and saw that Greg’s face was indeed covering with sweat after being outed in front of a bunch of people. Greg did hate his love life being shown. “I’m sorry, Greg.” Millie said, looking down at the floor. She, also, hated being vulnerable. They both erupted into tears and Draco and Rolf edged out of the room while Luna gave them pecks of kisses. It seemed everyone had had an insufferable day.
Draco stood with a permanent-looking scowl on his face as Stephen measured an abandoned storefront as if he had all the time in the world on this blisteringly chilly day. Draco, of course, had come prepared with a silk jacket, but the fact that the chill still infiltrated his body made him even more impatient than usual. “Do hurry, will you?” Draco yelled against the frost. Draco wondered why in September it would penetrate with the cold, but Draco was always a cold one to begin with. “I’m doing the best I can, without your help I might add!” Stephen yelled back, stepping back and writing more measurements on his levitating clipboard. “I see, I see.” He muttered. Draco groaned at the Ravenclaw chatter, and resisted the urge to throw their folder at him in the wind.
. He told himself vehemently. He got back in the car after doing a mental-checkup on himself and his lower region. "I'm in trouble, aren't I." Harry asked Draco when he slipped back inside. Draco sighed. "Yes. But I'm here to keep you safe." Draco told him in a rush. Harry looked at him with wide eyes.
Draco began to notice that Harry was spending more and more time 'sneaking out.' When he asked Harry about it, Harry had nothing to say but that he was 'studying' or 'hanging out with Cho.' Draco knew that all of those excuses were shite, as Harry had never met up with Cho, and had already disappeared nowhere near the library. Draco had tried following him sometimes, but the prat always eluded him. It came to his attention also that Weasley, one of Harry's biggest male admirers, also disappeared around the same time with a bunch of other Gryffindors. Draco had no choice but to conclude that Harry had a plan to go against Umbridge.
He stood up off the box and left the workroom, calling out again once he got to the bleachers and finally hearing an answer from one of the rows. "Over here!" Draco called, his head ducked under a row of chairs. "What happened last night?" Harry laughed, finally less tense now that he knew where Draco was. "You got tired, and I thought I'd give you a break. Your silly bugger decided to fall asleep on the boxes instead of getting a cuppa. I didn't want to wake you." Draco shrugged, faintly blushing and trying to put it off. "You're so sweet." Draco groaned.
obviously, but he didn't want Draco to make assumptions after such a long time. Harry felt like a idiot. "Harry Potter." Draco said simply before putting his hands on the well-behaved child.
to wake up Draco to try and practice with him. Draco had almost punched him. He was grateful that he had fast reflexes, and that he was able to evade Draco's angry wake. He really
Now, the reason behind this protectiveness was something that Draco did NOT like to think about, so he tried in vain to focus on this stupid Herbology assignment. The muggleborn that had given it out was going on that disturbing hippie trend that was plaguing the muggles, so Mr. ‘Cool’burns had assigned to them a tropical plant that had rainbow leaves. He sloppily rained on the plant, so that the leaves would puff out like it was supposed to.
Draco had tears in his eyes. Merlin. This was all his fault. But he did his best to look him in the eye, though he felt like a complete wuss. Where had his confidence gone? His comebacks? Everything had vanished when he found out Draco wasn't just a want. He was a
talk to the Boy Who Lived? He might kill him! I don't trust him at all!" Okay, he was right here, for Merlin's sake. Draco glared at him.
He gave a glare to the annoyingly skinny professor and put his head in his lap as the professor gave him a detention for not listening. He didn’t feel like making a snarky reply, all he could think about was how disappointed Colin was going to be when he found out Draco had come up with nothing. And to think, his current life was being spent caring about what other people thought.
“Women? Malfoy, I’m not a p-poof. I’d think I’d know.” His face flushed and he stomped off in the opposite direction. Draco laughed and cocked his head. “Whatever you say, but you wouldn’t be the only one, Potter.” Draco grinned as Potter’s array of emotion showed up chaotically on his face. “What? I’m not even going to ask. But I assure you, I have an interest in women.” He growled and nitpicked on his jacket, stealing looks at Draco all the way. Draco smiled and felt a change in conversation was in order. “Ms. McGonagall would be honored to have us have a look at the records and have a ‘chat’ with her. I figure we’ll be gone a while on Saturday.” Potter looked relieved at the changed and stood up straighter.
Draco glared at him. Harry couldn't help it. He wasn't perfect, after all. "No! Fine, you win, you stupid prat. I'll keep you as my parole officer. But you will
“Harry’s right, mate. Just because us big blokes must take on the role of the Aurors, doesn’t mean the civilians have less to offer.”
sister. But the others are Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. But they're only second to the real prize... that being Gryffindor." Ron reaffirmed. Harry wondered about the other houses, and what it meant to be assigned one. But, since this boy was nice enough, he hoped he was in Gryffindor. He didn't want to deal with arseholes without an ally or two. Correctional' taught him well. Ron was about to say more, probably about his brothers, but a old man came up to the front of the room and everyone went silent. Creepy.
Draco had then started to yell at Harry for learning such a powerful spell. He had already gathered what it was for.
But Draco's mother did the unimaginable; she didn't give him up. So when she lied and Hagrid went to pick him up, Harry acted dead. Acted dead right up until his friends waged war (again) and Neville attacked Nagini with the sword. It was insane, and Harry knew it was his only chance to off Voldermort once and for all. His own wand did most of the work. Voldermort ended up dying from his own spell. Neville killed Nagini, and Harry thought his friends deserved more credit than him when it came to defeating the Horcruxes and the Death Eaters. But he still couldn't find Draco, up until he had come at him fast.
