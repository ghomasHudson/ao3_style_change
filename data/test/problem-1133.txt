Since he was the boy who lived, the Order of the Pheonix—or the group of the protagonist wizards—has dragged the teenager to their AA meetings. Training him so he could be ready whenever there is an attack. In the end, with one simple spell that an old DADA professor taught him, he was able to disarm tHe dArK lOrD and win the war. Hurrah!
"I honestly don't mind" Draco chuckled, smiling at Harry. "But yeah, I don't think the others would appreciate seeing it so... visible. I've tried different healing spells but it's not much of an injury, is it?"
"Listen to her, big mouth!" A Slytherin added, causing the group to erupt in laughter. Draco snapped his neck back at him and glared. "No. No. Only I get to make fun of him" The laughed died down and the Slytherin nodded.
After being confronted by Albus Dumbledore, the professors all agreed to let him join the goddamn competition.
The only lady in the room turned her head at Dumbledore in fucking confusion. "Is that really your first question?"
"You know what it's like staying at my uncle Dursley's house. It's a complete and utter nightmare." Harry admitted, "So, I've been talking to Voldemort about this and he insisted on staying in his place for the summer, even though he won't be around too long. He's visiting his friends during the summer. So I have the place all to myself"
C: "And what's wrong with that?"
After a few muggle magic up their sleeves, the group was able to find a way to go out to Hogsmeade. The only thing left doing is Harry dragging Draco out of his room. "Are we even allowed out of school?"
"Well, no shit" Pansy retorted as the lady continued to snore loudly. "She snores just like you, Ron" Harry commented.
Harry got up to fetch a spare book on the rack. They were dusty and old like Dumbledore. Before reaching for the cleanest book he could find, he noticed someone standing beside him, possibly getting a book as well. He noticed the shiny black pair of shoes and coughs lowly. "Hello.." He stretched his word.
"It's okay. Can I just ask why?"
"What?!" He snapped his head at his father, trying to find a hint of
didn't scream gay as fuck"
he is. He'll tell us if he's a hundred percent sure and ready" Hermione told.
Harry pointed at his Ron. "He was the last one!"
The whispers went something like this:
"Okay! Shut up!" Ron and Hermione said in sync, which made Harry laugh louder. "Oh my god, Harry!" She rubbed her temple. Seeing Harry still laughing, she grabbed her notes again and smack his head from across the table. "It's not funny!"
Harry smiled lightly. Draco looked down, "I avoided Ron and Hermione for a few days, which is probably why they thought I did it. But I promise you with all my overpriced heart that I did not think or do anything, be a part of this shit, hell even put you to the trouble that I'm not invited in"
A tad surprised but still manages to blush, Harry looked down as he chuckled unevenly. "Sorry" He mumbled delicately. Ron furrowed at his best friend. "What's he talking about? Staring? At who exactly?"
A: "Isn't it weird that they're actually together?"
Harry might be the only one who finds it quite endearing. "Consider this a privilege, mate" Ron riposted. The Slytherin rolled his eyes—again. "Fine. I guess it's better than being stuck in this filthy school walls"
"Hermione's not really a big fan of... breaking the rules," Harry said carefully, turning to see Hermione's reaction who rolled her eyes. "Well, not for you at least."
"Mr. Malfoy" Harry spoke like the heroic motherfucker he is. Lucius' head still stiffs as he turned back at his gay son. "May I speak to you, Draco? In private."
"See you tonight, Potter" He left him a glare one last time before walking away with Slytherin students of all ages and skin color trailing behind him. Even if he is a bully, he doesn't discriminate.
Harry furrowed, "Keep it in my pants? Well, you—" Harry was ready to hit him with a sarcastic remark he thought of one night on his bed when Ron shouted from behind. "Shove off, Malfoy!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Before the girl could answer in her
as quiet.
Yep, he's tearing up a bit now. "Wow." He breathed. Pushing his tears back so his gay son doesn't cry in front of his daddy. "Never thought I'd hear you say that"
Harry smiled assuringly. "I'll be okay. You have a lot of things here." He stated the obvious whilst scanning the room he has been to countless of times.
Dumbledore gasped and looked back at them. "Really?! What were you two doing in there?" He asked. Snape spoke monotonously, "I found them.. in the middle of... a tongue match"
"I get to choose what you wear." Draco pointed at himself, "You have terrible taste in fashion"
No wonder she made her way next to Draco the second she saw the opportunity. The boy looked disgusted at first, before retrieving with a smirk when he saw Harry staring at him. Acting as if he enjoyed the pair of boobs smashed into his upper arm.
"Worse than yours." The latter admitted with a chuckle, "And we're still halfway through breakfast"
He tilted his head and was confirmed that it was Malfoy. Hagrid didn't seem to mind and smiled widely, "Ah! I see what you mean there, Harry. I'm gonna let you two do what you gotta do. I'm off!" He announced before making his way to Dumbledore's tower.
That's one class down, a few more to go. This time, they're sharing Transfiguration Class with Professor McGonagall. She also very gorgeous, if I may add. But let's not get swoon over her flawless looks and see what these bitches are up to this time. "Wonderful, Ms. Greengrass!" she complimented the Gryffindor. "Now—"
"Yeah..." He's fucking speechless. What the fuck is this? He stared at Draco's back, trying to make sure he's not being delusional like us shippers. "What are you doing here?" Harry asked after he gulped.
Harry nods before scooting closer. "When is the right time exactly?"
"Shit. That's hot" Astoria whispered from the sidelines, as the other students watch the drama unfold.
The group grew very very close afterwards. From planning Draco's birthday party and then it being ruined by Filch, to Draco insisting on taking everyone back to the pub and Harry encouraging everyone to have their first shot. Let's just say, it did not end well. But they had the rowdiest time of their life. No dark wizards, no haunting childhood trauma, just teenagers being teenagers. And that's
And people would be like wtf are they dating? And Harry and Draco couldn't give less of a damn.
Blaise doesn't smoke. He's just there to accompany her when she needs to smoke. It's such a muggle thing to do but it works. Her family can be tight around the edges—kinda reminds me of someone I know. Even if Blaise and Draco don't smoke, they were nice enough to accompany her every time she needs to, which usually happens when she's nervous to meet her family again.
so you know. "Do you do this often?" Harry asked.
"Since when?"

"Yeah, so you can win that stupid prize. Fucking, Potter" Draco spat.
Furrowing like a dumb idiot he is, he asked, "What effects?"
The girl just stared at him in confusion, while the rest of the table with seemingly teasing smiles. Like they knew a secret no one else in the world will ever know.
"Of course, we won't. Or at least, I won't" She said, both Harry and Hermione turned to Ron, who made a look of offense but then shrugged and promised to not freak out as well.
The transfiguration professor turned to both Harry and Draco, who stood next to each other without a word. She sighed as she shook her head. "Detention, after last period" She informed before walking away, waving her hands, attempting to make room for her to walk away gracefully, followed by Severus Snape from behind like a lost dog.
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed him backward. They resumed their Wattpad's tongue fighting dominance shit. Draco helped Harry up on the table as the two continued to ruin the fuck out of each other. Weirdly, the wet noises of lip slapping weren't bothering Voldemort at all. He actually finds it rather soothing. Even the moans of Harry and Draco didn't seem to bother him—but it did stop them when he heard the sound of the doorknob trying to be pushed open.
The next morning he woke early and dressed himself in the protective leathers most Hit-Wizards wore, before applying a light glamour to alter the appearance of his hair and clothes. The magic was easier to maintain long-term if he kept the disguise simple, and people rarely recognized him when he wasn’t blond. He fingered his fringe, which was run through with gray. Well,
“…Alright?”
“Mother, the cabinet is finished.”
“It’s fine.” It wasn’t, but neither did he blame his godfather in particular.
“Malfoy, stop it! She’s trying to help you!”
“So when the wards were tripped, you didn’t think much of it?”
“Bollocks,” Draco said irritably. “I don’t suppose we’d be lucky enough for it to wear off?”
Before Weasley could interject again, there was a loud crash from down the corridor. He and Potter glanced at each other. Montague. Damn it. If they had returned, then so had he. They started towards the noise at once, both with wands drawn and ready to fire. Although he and Potter were clearly suffering from the lingering effects of their accidental temporal excursion, which largely resembled drunkenness, they were no less intent on seeing their case through for it. Besides, who was better equipped on a train full of children to deal with a mad criminal than them?
was undeniably the cause of the friction between them. His rages were legendary, not only in the Auror Department but also within his own family.
There was silence.
Tied down like an animal. Perhaps that was because it was true. His face flushed in humiliation at the thought, and a film of salt pricked at his eyes. He had never felt so alone. Here he was, in a purgatory of his own making. Draco had no one to blame save for himself.
Draco could feel the wolf rearing its head within him, and the loss of his shields left him uncomfortably close to the unruly tangle of his thoughts. Severus clearly wanted to interject, but seemingly refrained for his sake.
Already tiring of his game, Draco struck first. He slashed his wand in a brutal arc that had Montague reacting before he even realized what he’d done. The hostage was left unprotected in the interim. This opening allowed Potter to retrieve her, and he summoned her towards him. One of the surrounding students latched onto her immediately and pulled the girl into the crowd. Now Montague was not only fielding spells from Draco but also from Potter, and the two were quickly closing the distance between them. He was going to lose, and this time there was no accomplice to intercede on his behalf.
“I didn’t hurt anyone, did I?” He asked, thinking of those that had been present when Potter had dragged him in.
and all.”
“Good enough.”
Draco sagged back into the bed. “Why are you even here?” He asked, not looking at him.
Harry went rigid. “Please, let’s not talk about that,” he said. A fissure appeared in one of the trees. His hands clenched.
after its initial appearance in the Cup earlier that summer. They’d talked at length about its specs over dinner the night before, comparing the relative merits of base speed versus acceleration when Al had opened it. They were a Quidditch family by trade, and even little Lily liked to play Chaser for their pick-up games in the garden. Teddy played Keeper for Hufflepuff, and James—who was a Gryffindor if there ever was one—would play Beater once he attended Hogwarts. Al alternated between Seeker, like himself, and Chaser.
“I owe you nothing, Potter, least of all an explanation!” Severus said, in lieu of providing any kind of an actual answer. “As for the latter, ask the headmaster himself.”
Montague lunged for the back table, where he’d presumably been working prior to their assault. Cogs, gears, and gilt wire were swept to the floor, sacrificed in search of one of the partly dissembled time-turners scattered about. Potter was already firing off another deluge of curses, but Montague was adept enough to deflect or shield himself from them. Even if he managed to duel Potter to a stalemate, which was unlikely, Montague still could not fend off the both of them. It was only a matter of time until they subdued or killed him. But perhaps that was not his intention at all.
“You aren’t a prisoner.”
“You could always put me out of my misery.”
“Of course not.”
The term
“Potentially. There shouldn’t be a
Well, “bloke” being the operative term, of course. These days the only shags he had were with his fellow dark creatures, who couldn’t catch what it was he carried. He’d off himself before ever passing the curse on to a child of his. Vampires, fae, and certain corporeal spirits were safe options because there was no chance of cross-species reproduction. Now witches and other werewolves, however… No sense in risking it, that was certain. The last thing he needed was to knock up some poor bird with the spawn of a beast.
The body of Greyback was located in the parlor, along with that of Narcissa Malfoy’s, who had been savaged almost beyond recognition. What appeared to have killed Greyback was a silver cutlery set that had been transfigured into imposing spikes. There was blood splashed across the walls and furniture, most of which had also been torn apart. If any figures had resided in the portraits before, they did not now. How the Malfoys could still live in the place where they, essentially, had been imprisoned and so many others had been tortured or murdered was unfathomable to Harry. His skin was crawling already. He could not forget Hermione’s screams, Bellatrix’s mad laughter, and the look of horror upon Malfoy’s young, blood-streaked face. Harry grimaced.
“I’m what? A bastard? A blood purist? A vile, filthy little half-breed? I won’t deny those accusations. I’m fully aware of what, exactly, I am. You don’t have to tell me.”
Potter’s eyes flashed. “You heartless bastard, don’t you care about them? They were your parents!”
. You don’t know what it’s like. You don’t know what it does to someone. That—that fear. Waiting for it to happen again.”
“Terribly is the word I would use. Disastrously works, too.”
“The only people who’ll want to shag you like this are nonces and their ilk, so get ready for a
Two days later, a letter came in the post for him. Draco did not often get letters, aside from the occasional notice of an impending liaison with Pansy, or a verbose and appallingly vain summary of Blaise’s latest world travels. The latter’s most recent report had listed the twenty-seven different types of French wine he’d purportedly tried while vacationing in Cannes. This information had only served to make Draco wonder how he’d made it seven years without attempting to throttle Blaise at least once. But
“I told you, it was a wraith! And like you’re one to talk, you sket.”
After that day, he served his sentence with little complaint and dug himself out of the gutter once he was released. He was trying, for his father and mother—but most of all, for himself. Yet Draco could not help but think of how his life might have turned out otherwise. If he still had the Malfoy fortune, none of this would be a problem. He’d have freed his mother and father before their deaths. He’d have never been bitten. But it was gone. After the war, those most affected by the Death Eaters and their puppet ministry had demanded restitution—which, of course, had come from them. Now he was stuck paying obscene amounts of reparations in recompense for his supposed evil deeds for the rest of his bloody life. It hadn’t ended with the vaults, properties, and holdings; what was left over ate up nearly seventy percent of his salary, which was a less than stable source of income. He would die with nothing and no one.
That wasn’t the reaction I was expecting, quite the opposite actually.
I ran down the hallways and almost knocked over Professor McGonagall. “Mr. Potter! Where do you think you’re going in such a hurry?” She asked and looked at me with her familiar stern look. I nervously looked over my shoulder before answering. “I’m sorry Professor, it’s just- I-“ The tears came back and I broke down crying in front of Professor McGonagall. “What’s the matter Potter? Are you hurt?” She asked and I could tell her expression had softened up one she saw my tears. I didn’t know where to even start. I wanted to tell her everything, but at the same time I didn’t want anyone to know. Ron already knew that Draco had bitten me, but that was it. I didn’t want more people to know if I could avoid it. I shook my head and hid my bloody shoulder with my robe. There was a long silence before I finally spoke. “Professor, what is an Alpha and an Omega?” I asked and watched as all the color drained from her face. She cleared her throat and pulled me aside. “Those are special terms we use the describe our behaviors. It’s a special old kind of magic we inherited from our ancestors. It’s very powerful and can overrule the laws of physics. Why do you ask Potter?”  My cheeks flushed a bright pink color as I fiddled nervously with my hands. “Well- It’s just that I’ve been seeing this person for a while now, and they’ve turned out to be an Alpha about to start their first Rut- And they think I have somehow triggered it by being an Omega about to go into my first heat-“ I mumbled and looked at the floor, too embarrassed to look at McGonagall. I could tell by the way the atmosphere around us changed that she was surprised by the news. She cleared her throat once more before speaking. “Well, if that is the case Potter, we better get you somewhere safe. Alphas can be very brutal when they’re in Rut and if word gets out there is an Omega in heat running around freely, there is no guarantee that you will make it till the end of your heat. Omegas produce a very sweet scent when they’re in heat to attract Alphas to mate with. That scent has an intoxicating effect on the Alphas and they become unable to think straight. If you combine that with an Alpha in Rut- That could end catastrophic.” McGonagall said quietly and sent me a worried smile. “But Professor- I’ve never heard of this before- Is there nothing I can do to stop this from happening to me?” I asked quietly and looked up at her, eyes wet and puffy from the tears. She shook her head and sent me a sad smile. “I’m afraid not Potter. We don’t get a say in whether we want to be Alphas, Betas or Omegas.” I looked confused at her and raised an eyebrow. “What’s a Beta?” Professor McGonagall had to restrain herself from rolling her eyes at me before she answered. “For goodness sake Potter- Sometimes I forget how little you know about our world.” She muttered softly and gave my shoulder a soft squeeze. “Promise me you will come straight to me if you start to feel any changes in your body.” She said and left me there in the hallway. She seemed to have been very busy when I bumped into her. I shrugged it off and started walking again. I still didn’t know where I should go, but the common room was not an option for me, neither were the dungeons, not right now at least.
“On second thought, maybe I’ll take you with me—Chosen One or not!” Draco snarled, snapping his teeth. He thrashed against his restraints.
He felt the loss of his shields more keenly than ever in that moment, as Draco could not entirely suppress the tears that welled up then. After this came the shame. It had become an all too familiar feeling recently. He pulled his knees to his chest and leaned forward. His chest and back both protested at the movement. In the distance, he could hear the mournful howls of a wolf.
One night when Potter had been particularly pissed, he’d started to mutter about cupboards and locked doors and some disturbing sport called “Harry Hunting.” Draco had not mentioned the incident, but neither had he forgotten—nor had he looked at the other man the same since. Perhaps that’s why Potter had taken a liking to him. Similar inclinations towards danger, and similar tragedies. In his youth he’d measured himself against his father, his mother, and this man—who, he supposed, had been his childhood foil. Now Potter was one of the only people who would willingly be seen with him. That afforded him some measure of loyalty from Draco, who was surprised by how much he’d come to tolerate the other’s presence in his life.
Darkly amused, Draco could already imagine the
There were little employment opportunities for ex-convicts in Wizarding London, but Draco would have went and offed himself before ever seeking out muggle work. He wound up just faffing about the city for two years after his initial release from Azkaban, scraping by through odd jobs here and there, and would have continued in the same manner had he not stumbled across a recruitment advert in the
Harry sighed and set down the plate he’d been washing, which sported a fresh hairline fracture. He flicked his wand to mend it, then levitated the rest into the drying rack. The procession of dishes finished with a loud
The year passed in a haze. His time was divided between fulfilling the role of “Malfoy,” and working tirelessly on the cabinet. But opening the connection was only the beginning, if his grimoires were to be believed. First, the vanishing cabinet would need to be repaired, and only then could the he begin to ward it. The sigils were going to take the longest. Inscribed with an athame comprised of goblin-forged silver, and filled in with the blood of the caster, they would encompass the entirety of both the exterior and interior of the Hogwarts cabinet. The other needed nothing, save for someone to take that first step into the doorway. He suspected the process of fully warding it would take until spring.
Midna nodded and signed him with his name. She handed back the notebook, "Here you go, darling. Please don't try to sell this on wBay."
Harry took a deep breath, "Well, I've been seeing.. this guy.. for the past couple of months," He paused, looking up to see his friends waiting, paying close attention to him. "Again, please don't freak out. Because he's not very much... a friend. Meaning, you might not like him that much"
"I would like to personally say I'm sorry." Her sentence was cut short by the nameless bitch. Draco looked up as he watched the nameless bitch getting up from the leather couch. He turned to Draco before he continued. "to ever think you're worth being here, Malfoy! A disrespect to the house and Salazar himself. Embarrassing!" He spat in disgust.
Okay, back to Harry Potter being famous.
It was on Wednesday afternoon after their class was over. They were back fighting again over some stupid — well, honestly, over nothing — when the conversation somehow dragged into this.
"Draco. Can we talk?" Draco groaned instinctively but quickly regretted when he realized it was Pansy. Pansy has a special place in his heart, not gonna lie. She was one of his first friends other than Crabbe and Goyle. Every time he has a problem at home, she was the first one he would run to. He was there before Harry was, actually. And it kinda hurt him—both of them—when he decided not to tell Pansy, out of all others.
"He was totally eye-fucking you, Harry" Hermione pointed out in a serious tone as if she's pointing out a fact from her book, which made Harry furrow and blush while Ron held back a laugh. "So, did you go to the Astronomy Tower?" She asked, switching back to his story.
. Which is in a few minutes. Fuck.
you owe us something too" Ron chirped in. Draco stopped and turned around, furrowing at him. Folding his lips back and both hands in his pocket. "How about apologizing to us? For what you did in the last five years?" Saying it as if it's the most obvious thing in the world.
"There's a fresh batch of rock cakes there," Hagrid pointed to the tray of rock cakes he was talking about. Harry turned and nodded. "Are you sure you're okay being left alone? I won't be gone for too long"
The realization only hit him when being confronted by Ginny Weasley. Not purposefully, at least. She was ranting about how amazing she feels about Luna Lovegood and the slightest things she does that just makes her heart run faster than Kanye West running for president.
, waving with his free hand, letting his date hold his other.
Everyone gasped and turned. So did Malfoy. For a split second, he felt good, like that bitch deserved it. In which, he did. But it drastically changed the second he saw the nameless bitch's face covered in blood and laying somewhat lifeless on the floor. The door swung open as a few other students rushed towards the nameless bitch—okay, I probably should name him, let's call him Thanos.
He stopped chewing. Staring at her with eyes wide open. "............no" Before he can react any further, the girl snatched the wrapper out of his hands and read the brand on the wrapper. "It is!" She exclaimed and turned to Ron with a glare. Harry chuckled at her reaction, "What's wrong? It's just candy"
. Snape watching him. He bowed down,
"Hah! I won!" Dumbledore turned to Snape, pointing his index finger at him. "In your face, Severus!"
"What are you boys doing?" McGonagall asked, scaring the three professors, all quickly looking elsewhere but Draco and Harry. "N–Nothing" All three replied collectively.
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed himself away from the window. He looked around the dark unlit room and
"Sorry about that—" McGonagall told the boys who have no idea what the fuck is going on.
Ron stared again in horror. "Bloody hell! Again?!" Harry can't help but chuckle, "Over and over—"
a little to make it look wearable and less of a clown than he already is. "You look bad in anything, Ron" Harry
"I know. I'm better" Harry smirked. Draco rolled his eyes fondly. The latter giggled and added, "But so are you. Come on. I'll fight anyone who tries to say otherwise"
"At least I made an impact" Harry chuckled before he stopped his broom. He took and deep breath and sighed
? That's brilliant!" Harry said
"Hermoine. Hermoine Granger."
The two came at the exact time they promised. They were much aware of the small audience that's forming around them — mostly from within their friend group. "So, when will your date come around?" Harry asked.
"I'm glad to hear that" He smiled
Fuck. Act normal, Harry. Act fucking normal. "Me who?"
The audience clapped as Harry received his reward. He then whispered back to Harry, "It's supposed to be the time for you to dance"
"Uh... We really don't want—"
"Is there anything I can do to help?" Harry asked genuinely, hoping he's alright with all these... weird vibes. Draco shrugged,  "Uh, nothing? I mean, I can already feel the judgement from my table"
Harry nodded, "Weirdly, I did. Even though I thought he'd be there with his friends, but he didn't. He just sat there. Alone."
"Dragons?!" Harry's eyes shot wide open.
"You pulled me into a dark corner" He stopped with a halt. "
Hermione gaped him, smacking his arm with a throw pillow, "What the hell, Harry!" Harry laughed.
Snape lets go of their collar, pushing them a bit to the front. He closed the door behind him before turning his attention back to them. "Do you want me to tell them?"
But it still managed to enrage him. He got up, walked closer, and pointed his wand at the taller boy's beautiful neck. Draco didn't move as the boy walked closer to him, placing wand against his smooth neck. He glanced down at it with a fucking hot smirk. "What are you gonna do with that, Potter? Kill me?"
But it didn't stop them from their constant bickering and secret little rendezvous. They've been talking a lot with Voldemort about this, who surprisingly is very helpful. He even made sure to talk to Lucius if he ever were to be rude to Draco, in which Draco took gratefully.
"I need you to put a little trust on me, Granger Weasel." Draco spotted, "I'm letting you two interrupt my date with Harry—"
"Midna!" The bartender greeted, hands clasped against each other. Midna turned around with a small grin, "Yes, dear?" Before she noticed the group behind the bartender and grew a small smile. "Why, hello," She said in a fake(?) posh accent.
Draco took a step forward and strutted like Britain's Next Top Model across the long hall. He felt every eye staring at him. But he didn't mind. He continued walking like the god he is.
"I... heard about you and Harry" Lucius finally said. Draco looked down, "I figured" Mumbling and hoping the train downhill isn't as scary as he imagines it to be.
"Okay, now here comes the blackmailing part. You either come with me on a Hogsmeade date or I'll tell Hermione you have a crush on her"
They are Harry Potter's friends.
"Especially to us"
"She's probably on her period" Ron shrugged before Hermione shot him a glare. "What?"
"Honestly, Severus. We do it all the time. It's you who just figured that out" Dumbledore cackled, putting down his tall glass of butterbeer. He gaped him, "Well that's rude..." which made the room fall into another round of laughter.
Blaise? She was the one who introduced Malfoy to Blaise. He is also very nice. He's the little calm in the storm of this duo. You know, like the countless times they sneer at idiot students passing through them in the hallway. Blaise was the one who had to drag them away so they won't get detention. You need that type of friend, I'm telling you.
"Yeah, I guess I am that." He shrugged with a smile, "Honestly, it doesn't change who I am. I have always been, you know, bisexual. I just needed time to realize it for myself. I will always be the kid you met on the train — even if I shave my head bald, or lose a scar, or date a guy. I'm still... me. I've always been."
"What are you? A yelp review?"
The Slytherin laughed. "It's not flirting. It's the truth" He said before dragging Harry to his bed. He closed the curtains with a simple spell and draped Harry's invisibility over them. "Lumos," He whispered. A little light appeared on the tip of his wand, making it easier to see each other in the dark. They sat criss-cross each other, foreheads almost touching, smiles never left their faces. Draco rested his hand on Harry's leg and smiled softly. "So, tell me about your day"
Snape looked down, trying to hold back a smile but instead chuckled with them. Snape might have that stiff and odd persona, but once you get to know him better, he is a very fun and easy-going guy. He is also very good with other professors, that is why it's okay for these people to make fun of him, knowing he wouldn't bother. "Okay, why are you all insulting me?" He looked at them, backing away pretending to be offended. "What have I done to your depressed ass?"
"Poor Harry, he must
With the number of times he stares at Draco, he had concluded that he was indeed infatuated by Draco
After weeks and months of it, Dumbledore and the others trusted him to keep the magic off from his room. The magic that's holding him back from doing magic or shit like that. He was able to style his room based on his preference which is much more comforting. He also invited the professors to a weekly game night at his place. That is why McGonagall was a bit confused when Voldemort mentioned that they had to go through detention tonight.
She giggled, "I'm still going with you, Ron. But since Harry's the winner and he's going to be the one to start the ceremony, it would be more embarrassing for him if he doesn't have a date for his own ball"
"They're actually the ones who thought of this idea," Harry said carefully. Draco's face turned visibly annoyed with his eyebrows pulled down together and his lips growing thinner by each stare. He thought it was just gonna be him and Harry. Fucking hell.
The four chuckled and ran out as Snape shooed them like a flock of birds in his backyard. "Really, though." Draco started, turning to Hermione and Ron. "How did you get Snape to let us out? Did you spell him or something?" His voice sounding genuinely curious.
Draco chuckled. "Off-topic, I called my mom earlier tonight," Draco told him, turning his boy's head towards him. "
"Better than I expected. She was very supportive of it. But I told her not to tell father yet, you know, until I'm ready—I
"Yeah, that's pretty weird. But he is kinda hot though" The redhead spoke easily. Hermione furrowed. He shrugged, "People can be a jerk and still be hot as well, Hermione"
So it took both Harry and Draco a surprise when Harry found the blond on his broom outside his bedroom window. "You are insane"
"Yeah?
"What's that thing Snape gave him?" Ron couldn't help but wonder. Harry knew what it was since he was quite involved in the masterminding process of this specific potion. No, not really. But he was sitting there when it all happened. "It's a monthly potion they gave Voldemort to drink"
Not caring about the table separating them, Harry cut their distance as he pulled Draco into a kiss—which made Draco smiled and kissed him back hungrily like a fucking monstrous prick.
McGonagall furrowed, "Tonight?"
"We're not—" She stammered.
Back to the supposed conversation. "I'm just really want to show you off, you know" Harry smiled as Draco rolled his eyes playfully. "Be like those seventh years who snogged without shame in the hallway"
He walked up those magic stairs that leads to the Gryffindor common room and was surprised to see Harry already walking out of the painting—it's like he knew he was coming. "I did know you were coming," Harry said as they walked inside the empty common room. Everyone was already in their dorm rooms so it's just the two of them and the fire crackling in the fireplace.
Harry laughed, not bothering to raise his head off Draco's shoulder. "Don't worry. I don't have my wand with me"
"Don't worry, mate. I reacted the same way" Ron shrugged, while Harry just stiffened — trying to conceal his bisexuality like Elsa.
"Yeah."
"Well, first of all," Draco said, pulling himself up so he's sitting up straight. The only few straight things he can do. "I didn't tell you I was.. you know... gay, because I was scared you two would hate me. Well, kinda. But it's also like, with my father and you know, we're Slytherins and all. And stereotypically, we can be.. a bit.."
"Yeah? Wanna bet on it?" Harry smirked, eyebrow arched. He honestly has good eyebrows. I'm 99% sure that he 100% drew his eyebrows this morning.
"Who else would be the one to put your name in the goblet of fire if it isn't your one true soulmate bully!" Hermione sat down on Ron's supposed to sit. Ron doesn't have the energy to ask her to scoot so he just sighed and walked over next to Harry, plopping his butt next to his. Harry sighed, "I am well aware that you're 90% always right at times. But I think today would be the rest 20%"
Hermione took out her small notepad she kept inside her fur coat and handed it over to Pansy. "Oh, okay then," She said, a tad surprised. Pansy handed over Hermione's notebook and a quill she had kept in between the pages, ready to be used. "What's the name?" Midna asked, pulling the roll away from her lips. Pansy turned to Draco who quickly answered, "Severus Snape"
Harry got up from the couch and walked to the kitchen. "Do you want some tea?"
"What the hell was that?" Pansy asked as they walked up the tower. Draco shrugged with a smile, "I don't know. The wizarding world has an amazing sense of humor"
What? No! It can't be! Why am I thinking about him?
"Fair enough. Do we have a deal, Potter?" He extended his arm out and with a shake of his hand, the games begin. And the obliviousness continues.
, cheeks heating up with happiness. Snape rolled his eyes, "I may vomit"
Nah, jk. He said thank you.
stand here and be proud parents forever"
The table furrowed at the lovable idiot. "Who? Is it one of you guys?" He said, attempting not to look like he's shitting his pants. The Ravenclaw, Luna, giggled at the boy, "Oh, Harry. Of course not. It wouldn't be much of news if it's between a Gryffindor"
“Neither do I. Nor do I particularly care.”
“I need a door! Please, just give me a door!” Potter yelled, voice thin. “A way out of here!” The room constricted and shrunk around them, and a doorway materialized upon the rapidly approaching wall.
The first time he’d gotten well and truly mad at one of the children, James had smashed one of the toy soldiers Harry had rescued from his cupboard before attending Hogwarts for the first time. It had sat unused at the bottom of his school trunk for years, but when James turned five Harry thought it might be nice to impart one of the better relics of his childhood onto his son. It only took a few days for it to wind up broken, though, and intentionally at that. Al had wanted to play with it, too, and when Ginny told James to share, he’d stamped it underfoot in a childish fit.
Draco sighed.
“This is him, you daft loon!”
“Obviously. But I knew he was going to die anyways. Why bother offing him when it was going to happen regardless?”
They ended it once the sun had begun to disappear beyond the horizon. Al’s team had edged James’ out by fifty points, although no one had managed to catch the snitch. Harry had spotted it several times, but had not mentioned it in favor of extending the match. He felt refreshed by his time outside, and full up with happiness. Suddenly it felt like everything would be all right. That his worries were just that—worries.
Now faced with multiple wands pointed at him, and all by children no less, not to mention the various traumatized bystanders behind them, Draco reviewed his available options. The more morally reprehensible ones appeared the most viable at present. Well then. He was committing to being a criminal in both the past and the future, he supposed. His father would be so proud.
There was a sheepish expression on his face. When he ran a hand through his hair, it stuck up in dark clumps. How he managed to be so—so himself, even like this, amazed Draco.
There was a moment of silence.
“A cutting curse to the throat—swift, efficient. She bled out too quickly to feel any pain,” Potter said quietly.
Now with some cover in place, he hefted Weasley over his shoulder and blasted the window open. Potter tried to do the same, but his thin, stick-like arms and legs couldn’t quite manage Granger’s weight. Draco groaned and levitated the girl, leaving Potter room to reinforce the barrier behind them before they both took a running start and leapt out the hole in the train. Granger and Weasley began to scream bloody murder at this, and did not stop until Potter cushioned their impact with a well-timed spell, followed by a silencing charm. They bounced across the grass and down an embankment, coming to a stop beneath a large tree.
“It was a total cock-up all around, mate. Montague shouldn’t have been able to access the ministry in the first place,” Potter said, as though sensing the direction of his thoughts. In that moment, he looked unbearably kind.
“Or, what? You’ll hex me?” Montague said mockingly. “I doubt any of you will—” He cut himself off at the sight of Draco and Potter, becoming incandescent with rage. “You! Potter, Malfoy!” He shouted, digging the tip of his wand deeper into the temple of his hostage, which appeared to be a first-year girl.
How could the prophecy have chosen you, of all people, to save us? You don’t even know your own history!”
Bellatrix, Yaxley, and Dolohov were the most fervent in their worship during these meetings, euphoric in either torturing or being tortured by the Dark Lord, who was often content to simply preside over the chaos. After their… performance reviews were completed, the night would then climax in the mutilation and subsequent execution of a muggle, blood-traitor, or mudblood. Sometimes there would be more than one, and sometimes Greyback would eat the corpses raw after. The house-elves had become used to mopping blood off the floor.
“I know.”
They did not reappear anywhere near Grimmauld Place. Draco, Potter, Granger, and Weasley, did, however, materialize in a muggle garden somewhere in northern England, landing in an inelegant heap. Remus Lupin, who just so happened to have been enjoying a rather calm, if tepid, supper of crisps and canned beans in the shed of said garden, was startled by the noise. He had been squatting there for a little over a week, and had seen nothing that indicated the presence of either witches or wizards thus far, so the apparition came as a surprise. When he ran out, wand in one hand and crisp bag in the other, he was met by a tangle of limbs and groaning, swearing children—one of which he recognized at once.
echoed down the hallway, stopping both short. The sound came from the room at the end of the hall—a space barred only by an aged and molding door, which shuddered and grew still by turns. There was a strange, mechanical whirring that punctuated each bang, but that was not all he heard: a series of loud, increasingly frenetic mutters were interspersed throughout the racket, each word spoken with disquieting fervor.
“I’ll leave you to it then, Auror Potter,” Lindstrom said.
“Take all the time you need, Potter. It’s not as though the Aurors will be after us for kidnapping soon or anything.”
Draco turned his attention back to the girl before them. He recalled how self-serious Farley had been in the two years he’d been housemates with her. He then, with a sinking feeling, also recalled how completely and utterly obsessed with Percy Weasley she had been. Draco’s eyes drifted back towards the struggling boy in his arms.
“That’s fine, Healer Lindstrom. I can have one of the child specialists from the department come by tomorrow. I’m actually rather surprised Mr. Malfoy is lucid. I was prepared to wait for some time yet.”
“There are worse things in this world than death,” Draco said, thinking of Greyback, his Aunt Bellatrix, and now himself. “I’m sure Longbottom would tell you something similar.”
“You are going to live, Draco. I will make sure of it.”
At least now, they would be free.
“And fugitives.”
“Well, what’s something only I would know?”
“—dog collar and latex get-up. Yeah, that was humiliating. I don’t think I need to verify your identity now, you rotten prat. The only one who knew about that was you.”
“So, we’re eleven,” Draco said, after he’d caught his breath.
“Potter, how—
Draco awoke in slow gradations. He felt vaguely hung-over, and still a bit pissed if he was being quite honest with himself. He staggered to his feet, swaying unsteadily as he did so. The world around him appeared indistinct and hazy at the edges. People were saying his name, but their voices were distorted, as though having passed through water. Perhaps, he reckoned, it was less that he was drunk and more that he’d been bludgeoned over the head. And more than once, at that. He didn’t know where he was, and neither could he seem to recall the past several hours. All he remembered was the vague promise of meeting up with Potter to investigate a potential hideout of Montague’s. Potter. Of course this had something to do with him. Draco still didn’t know what had happened, but throttling that bastard senseless seemed like a good place to start.
“I’d never do anything of the sort, and neither would she,” Potter shot back, green eyes glinting mischievously. “Now keep out of trouble, you hear? I need someone to insult me regularly, else my head’ll swell,” he said, not bothering to refute the “sket” accusation.
“I wanted to take your statement myself. There have been nearly two decades of premeditated attacks on you and your family at this point, and I am one of the few who’ve been with the department for that long.”
Inordinately furious, Draco stepped over the mangled remnants of the compartment door to find two startled-looking children inside. One was a gangly ginger brat and the other was a vaguely concussed-looking child with a mop of dark hair. He was sprawled across the floor.
“Doubtful.”
The first visit passed without incident, but the second went awry almost immediately. He and Dudley were quietly sitting together while the children played at a local park, situated side-by-side on one of the surrounding benches, when Dudley had broached the topic of their childhood.
headline:
“I mean, we did just kidnap two children.”
Potter grinned. “I might need to end our chat early, mate,” he said, loosening the collar of his robes. Draco rolled his eyes.
After a moment, there was the sound of uncertain footsteps. He felt someone touch him, almost gently, and then the abrupt loss of Greyback’s weight. His breath rattled wetly in his chest. Draco was ready to die.
“Good.” He had carefully not flinched at the mention of “your wolf,” but it had been close.
Harry paused. “This is perhaps an… unusual offer, but if you ever find yourself in need of advice on raising a child with lycanthropy, you can owl me. Not as Head Auror— but rather, simply speaking from one father to another.” It was unprofessional, but Harry couldn’t wrest back the need to help Malfoy then.
” Blood to blood. Magic to magic. Accept my offer.
“Speak plainly, sir.”
“We can’t leave them here, that much is apparent. Is there a good place to drop them off?”
on it yet, just some blood wards that I can make quick work of. It’s all rather dependent on whether I’m recognized as Lord Black or not in this body, since I already know where the house is.”
“Mr. Potter, what in Merlin’s name are you doing?” A female voice shrieked, followed by the rapid appearance of Madame Pomfrey.
He laughed meanly. “He hasn’t told you—Harry Potter, the Chosen One? His favored student and Child of the Prophecy?”
Draco ground his teeth. “I know one thing for certain, Potter.”
Having quickly regained his bearings, Montague spat out an unknown curse in retaliation, which manifested itself as a jet of sickly yellow light. Potter dropped to his knees and let the spell sail over him, while Draco dove off to the side. He crashed into one of the many low tables lining the walls, which buckled instantly under his weight. Thrown to the floor, he staggered unsteadily to his feet, steadying himself against the wall. Potter had closed the distance between himself and Montague, slowly backing the other man into a corner. There was a look of wild wrath upon his face, and Draco was suddenly reminded of why Potter was the most feared man in the Wizarding World. No longer was he an eccentric former schoolmate, and neither was he the brazen youth of his childhood memories. This was the man who had killed the Dark Lord.
A cold female voice interrupted their conversation. “I’d very much like an explanation for this,” a sixth-year he recognized as being Slytherin prefect Gemma Farley. She too was bloodied, but looked no less fierce for it. Her wand was aimed at his heart.
Malfoy wavered briefly, the pale column of his throat working around an unsteady breath. “Greyback was crouched over Astoria. There was blood everywhere. Scorpius wasn’t moving. My first instinct wasn’t to run for the silver, but to make him suffer; my mother felt similarly. But she was still weak from Rookwood’s curse, so when she hexed him he just shook it off and picked her up in his jaws like—like she was a doll. I shot off every curse I could think of at him. Nothing worked, and he didn’t let her go until she was dead. Then he turned on me.”
Once outside the door, Draco positioned himself off to the right, while Potter crouched down on the side opposite. Turning to him, Potter nodded to indicate her readiness. Draco kicked down the door, which crumpled easily under his enhanced strength, wand held aloft. Potter leapt into the fray, firing off spell after spell at their target. Having been caught unawares, Montague barely managed to dodge the hail of spell-fire, rolling gracelessly across the carpet.
“If you insist on thinking of it that way, yes.”
would love to congratulate you on your efforts.”
“It’s up to you, then, isn’t it?”
“Like a Horcrux?” Potter finished.
Harry received the call about Malfoy the night Al turned eight. At first, he had almost felt relieved for the chance to leave. The birthday party had been a tiring, frantic affair from the start, and he and Ginny had been rowing furiously since breakfast. About what, exactly, he was still uncertain. Their home had become increasingly hot inside as the day wore on, not to mention claustrophobic—it was all the children, he thought, who filled up the rooms and spilled out into the back garden. It made the house seem smaller than it was. Like the walls were closing in on him. He had never been comfortable with small spaces.
Potter let go like he’d been scalded. “Sorry! We were just—” He had the gall to actually sound apologetic, and stared at his hands like wasn’t quite sure what had come over him.
Draco said nothing, and when it became clear that he was not going to speak again, Severus let out a low exhale and rose to his feet. He did not say anything before he left, but there was something heavy about the silence that made Draco think he wanted to.
“Alright, then. Have it your way,” Potter said snidely, and removed the silencing charm on Granger.
Severus sighed. “The Dark Lord is looking for you. Malfoy Manor is infested with Death Eaters. You have no home or parents to return to. Due to the events of last night, rumors about your… health have already begun to spread amongst the students.”
Potter flushed angrily. “Why, you—”
hadn’t. I was doing what should have been done all along. This… was a way to free us, and to revenge our deaths in the process.”
Potter quickly retreated, but not after shooting him another one of those searching, wild-eyed looks. The lingering scent of mint punctuated his departure. Pomfrey glanced between them, then sat several odious-looking potions atop his bedside table before taking her leave, too.
, Gin,” Harry said, pressing his face into her neck. “I-I can’t do that to the children. You have to stop me. Promise me. Please,” he begged her.
“It was still dead, so what does it matter!”
As the train sped off, a dark head peeked out of the destroyed compartment. It was Farley again, damn her. “Percy!” Farley cried in the distance, “I will not rest until I save you!”
“Infuriating! That’s what you are! As if I’d say either of those—
Harry was thirty-three, yet his childhood had not left him.
“Yes. Not to mention unexpected.”
“Auror Potter,” Malfoy acknowledged stiffly.
“Good,” she said softly, voice run through with a trill of weariness. “I will come through to… inspect your work.”
“This is completely and totally illegal! I can’t believe you’re breaking the rules, not to mention being so vulgar! You’re—despicable! I’ll never tell you where my parents live! I—” Her shrill tirade was cut off when Potter hastily replaced the charm.
“The Headmaster and I disposed of the bodies. The cabinet has likewise been destroyed. All that now remains is you. Moreover, as Potter has seen fit to inform you of the Dark Lord’s weakness, we can hardly let you leave unsupervised.”
At this, something inside him fractured on impact, something important, and Draco felt the corridors of his mind collapse as the wolf began to prowl freely. He was quickly losing any semblance of control he’d once possessed, and it was becoming more difficult to articulate his thoughts.
may be mad but he’s hardly a fool. Imagine the destruction if he’d been let loose here—even with Dumbledore present!”
” he chanted, arms raised heavenward. “
There was more that he needed to interview Malfoy about: the condition of the wards around Malfoy Manor; the spells used on Yaxley, Rookwood, and Greyback; and a record of any unusual activity that occurred in the days leading up to the attack. But he couldn’t bring himself to subject Malfoy to further scrutiny at the hands of what in his mind was likely an old enemy, and in that moment wanted nothing more than to see his family again. To reassure himself that they were alright, and to have Ginny in his arms. His subordinates would take care of the rest for now, and Harry would go home to his family. Now faced with such unimaginable tragedy, his own troubles seemed to pale in comparison. Everything would be fine. It always was.
But then there was a growl, not outwardly audible but originating from deep within the labyrinth he’d constructed for himself. It growled again, and
Immediately, the he could smell old rot, causing bile to churn within Draco’s gut. Potter’s face twitched violently in response, eyes narrowing. Over in the corner lay the corpse of Agatha Cogg, splayed face-down across the very countertop where she’d once sold her goods. She’d clearly been dead for several days, body now well into decomposition and crawling with insects. One emerged from her left socket and scuttled across the counter. Foul couldn’t even begin to describe the scene. Draco’s grip tightened around his wand.
That made a great deal of sense, actually. Only a wizard as mad as the Dark Lord would ever attempt to make one. Soul magic tended to be… difficult. Everything Draco had read about them came from the oldest of his grimoires: the Sixth Book of Black Occult Philosophy, which detailed the process and its consequences at length.
Harry shook his head, "No—"
"Shh! Let him talk" Snape quiet her down. Harry, being visibly embarrassed at the question, turned to Draco. "Uh, do you wanna.." He could feel Draco was feeling the same way and his head shake sealed the deal. "Okay, uh... It's our first time?"
"Yeah, I know. It's me again." He said tiredly. "Boo!" He turned to a group and chuckled when one of them jumped back in fright. "I can take care of it from here," he said to McGonagall, patting her shoulder. She nods, "Yes, of course" and stepped back.
Seeing she was in a comfortable storytime manner, Harry started. "Well, it happened around last year. Let's just say he got... hot?" He shrugged with a smile.
As if it's normal, he walked in and rested his wet damp hair on Draco's lap as the latter continues to read his book. Something Harry's particularly very fond of — not that he would ever admit it.
Draco nodded slowly at every word before catching Harry's stare and joining him in laughter. There is always something peculiar about this boy. Draco realized that as he laughed fondly. "And bad for my health, that's for certain" He added. Harry laughed, "Is that why you keep eating apples? Not that I'm complaining, honestly."
Harry snapped his head up and furrowed. "A boy?!"
"Let's just jump to what I know you're gonna want me to explain. Listen, I didn't know. I promise you, I didn't know they were gonna do that."
"Yeah, thanks" Draco added with a smile.
. Harry
"I honestly couldn't care less," Harry said, breaking a piece of chocolate from Ron's hand. "I fought that noseless dark creature, for crying out loud! A school bully shouldn't be that hard to get through"
"I know," She smiled like the teenager she's supposed to be, "I wonder who he is"
"You can just admit you thought of it" Draco smiled assuringly. Harry shook his head, "If so then it'd be a lie."
. "And his fluffy hair, adorable cheeks, pretty eyes, gorgeous smile..."
"You might need to smell like me. At least if you wanna get a girl" Draco joked.
Carefully and quietly, Blaise opened the full-length window, the temperature in the room turning slightly colder. They quietly crept inside, leaving behind snow prints from their boots. Hermione looked down and cleared them off with a simple incantation.
Harry pushed him carelessly, not even thinking where they were or if they'll get caught. "Someone excited," Draco chuckled before he moaned into Harry's open-mouth kisses on his neck.
"Why?" Snape asked as he peered from behind McGonagall, making some poor students jump in surprise. McGonagall nodded. "Yes, you're right." She turned to Snape with a glare. "Because that's how schools work, Severus"
Harry chuckled and left their gaze, looking down at his untied shoelaces. Maybe Ginny can help him with it. "I've been meaning to tell you guys about this for a while, but I'm just... too scared, I guess. To admit it"
Draco furrowed in anger. "What?!"
"Shit" The nameless bitch cursed before frantically running away with most of the group. Some who knew him smiled politely before too, running away.
"She's also the lady who we promised an autograph from," Hermione told them.
Blaise furrowed, "Who?"
The Hogsmeade date will be in three weeks, which means three weeks for both Draco and Harry to come up with a plan to ask their crush out. In this case, each other.
"I never knew you had a sense of style. Where did you get it?" Hermione asked.
"What? You're gonna suck my—" He watched as Harry flew right past him and his beautiful face. Harry grinned and stuck his tongue out as if he's trying to taste the bitterness of the air around him. "Hey!"
He asked if they too snuck out like they did. In which reminded Hermione of the deal they made with Snape. "Then let's go" She pulled Ron away, eyes travelling inside every store and restaurants. Harry invited Pansy and Blaise who eventually agreed to join whatever they were up to—and that is ducking under a pub window.
Idiot.
"You're an idiot" He giggled as he pulled Draco to the middle of the great hall.
The boy came blasting through the doors and saw Malfoy sitting quietly with his damn book again.
"Oh yeah, right." Dumbledore nodded and walked closer, hands behind his back. "Well first of all, why did you interrupt them?" Snape furrowed. "Second of all," He moved closer, bending down to their height and whispered. "You two were snogging?!"
As they suspected, the pair walked in to see the four whore—Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, and Voldemort—conversing over Hagrid's freshly cooked stew and butterbeer. Not only them, but the other professors were there too. "Potter! Malfoy! Come on in! Have a seat" Dumbledore smiled widely when he saw them enter the room.
"Chocolates aren't candies!"
The latter blushed after a short moment of surprise. She nodded and muttered a soft yes before a few students started cheering, leaving a smile on Pansy's face and a terrified look on Draco's. He rolled his eyes once the room went back to normal and he was left standing there with his rival partner, Harry Potter. "Staying true to your green house traits, I see" Harry's smug look forming back. "Are you that desperate to win by asking your gayest friend to go out with you? You amaze me every time, Malfoy"
"You guys never seem to stop, do you?" Voldemort looked at Draco and Harry. "It seems as if you're asking for detention." He shook his head and sighed like a god he is. "My tower, tonight!" He informed before walking away.
Draco laughed before pulling him to a short sweet kiss, pulling him closer and wrapping his arm around him. "Come on. Let's buy some chocolate balls! My treat." He said with a smile. Pansy smiled widely, "Really?" With Ron equally as excited. "That's the best thing to come out of your mouth, Draco," He said, standing up and walking with the rest of the three to Honeydukes.
What Harry does best when he's in a tight spot is to go and consult with Hermione, his smartest and wisest friend he has. One of the only friends he has. "It must be Pansy's idea, isn't it?" Hermione made her assumption. He shrugged, "Possibly. But Ginny was the one to talk"
Hm, yes. Fascinating for you to say since you're
"Ugh, I hate you."
After being able to stay alive and kill The Dark Lord: Voldemort in his fourth year of highschool, he was pretty much the talk of the century. Well, we can't really say he's dead. Voldemort. His bad-side is dead. He's now just an ordinary and legendary wizard who is great
That was the moment he knew, they fucked up. Literally as well. Calm your bloody tits, Harry. Say something heterosexual. "W-Wha—" Were the only
Gliding against the white floor and swaying with the music, Draco chuckled. "Darling, I look good on anything. Even on you"
"Hah! Yes, I won!" Everyone turned as McGonagall got up from her seat and excitedly squealed in delight. Snape gasped and snaped at her, "Betrayal!"
"This gotta be a prank"
"I'm so sorry" Draco apologized, "I had to go to the bathroom. To check my hair. Does it look good?" He asked, bowing
"Hypocrite much?" She turned to him before trying to cancel out Draco's whining.
"Now you're the desperate one" Draco rolled his eyes before receiving another peck on his cheeks — and coo from the audience. He bit back a smile. "I don't know. What would I get in return?"
Pansy smiled softly. "Can we sit down?" She pursed her lips. Draco nodded and smiled tightly at them. "Yeah"
Ron was the only one to question what she meant.
The class watched as the door swung open dramatically. Also equally as dramatic, their new DADA teacher walking in with pride, and a wide smile smeared across his face. He stood in front of the class, arms wide open. "Miss me?"
, what are the purpose of your eyes if it isn't to stare at Harry and Draco.
And the fact that Harry also knows that he knows made it a lot more—yeah, I think you can finish that sentence yourself. "You're a fucking git" He gritted his teeth and pulled his collar, before attacking his lips with his. In which I just found out it's actually called kissing.
Draco realized this and blushed, rubbing his neck as if he can just wipe it off with the sweat of his palms. "Answer in honesty, boys" Dumbledore stated, this time in a more Sirius tone.
He feels like a cat. Or a ferret.
turned ground. It was the promise of life in the darkness, a sense of warmth springing from the cold. "Flying around late at night. Watching the stars"
Harry furrowed and looked up from his bowl, "Okay! Can I ask? Which Lily are you always referring to? I can't help but notice Professor Snape's quite... fond of her?"
"And it's not really common around here to have someone who's attracted to the same gender." Hermione said, "I was just scared and wanted to do my best supporting and being a good friend"
"Desktopig" Ron flicked his wand. Hermione snapped her neck like Thanos. "What did you say?!"
Harry chuckled, "But none of them are Draco Malfoy"
"Are you two fighting again?" Voldemort looked up from his book, noticing they're on the floor now. Both cheeks turned pink as Harry chuckled nervously. "Sorry"
Harry couldn't explain the fuzzy feeling in the pit of his stomach. For years of knowing Draco, he always thought that it meant he was hungry or irritated. But now that it appeared back when he wasn't hungry or irritated, he was sure it was something else. Something better, something right. "I love you too." He muttered
, eyes still twinkling as he spoke. "That's how we're gonna communicate once I'm buried in my grave" Draco joked.
Harry turned and smiled back widely. "Hi" She took her seat beside the red-haired Weasley, Ronald. "Where have you been?" The boy asked, with a tone I'm pretty sure you can hear through the screen.
"Sneaking out at night," Draco continued making the boy smile, "Pretending we hate each other"
He turned to him, "How did you know my mother's name?"
"At least I have a purpose in the world. What would your meaningless life bring to the table?"
"I don't know" He whispered back. Voldemort sighed. "Come on, Severus. We're helping a kid out today" He snapped his fingers and pointed outside.
Draco and Harry looked at each other, both in panic mode. "B—But professor. What are we supposed to tell the house?"
slow and offered his hand, looking up with a smile. "I may not be Lily..."
"I'm being crazy, right? This is just my dream" He looked down at the floor, eyes still wide open, hands on his forehead like he's having a migraine in a WikiHow illustration.
Harry's now with his best mates in their Gryffindor house common room, talking like normal teenagers should do, not roaming around the castle and attacking big snakes and three-headed dogs. They laughed and all that shit. Then it went silent. Which then sort of pushed Ron and Hermione to say this.
That realization only happened once he woke up the next day and acknowledging that he just vented all his anger and frustration that he has for this girl over to his so-called rival. Yet, never once did he uttered a single word about that night. When confronted he'd say, "I don't know what you're talking about"
spell—or any spell in that matter—and use it against your peers. Even if he deserves it."
"O–Of course" Draco nodded. He turned his head around, smiling tightly at Harry. As if he was asking for a wish of luck that everything will turn out fine—or a safe passage to get the fuck out of there. Same thing.
"Fuck off" He chuckled, making Harry laugh. "Can we
"Do.. you have a date to the Yule Ball? It's in 3 days" Harry said carefully. The last time they talked about the ball was in Hagrid's Hut, which happened way before Harry competed in the Triwizard Tournament.
"Of course not! I thought you did!"
They were so caught up with their jabbering that they didn't realize the hush plotting behind their backs. "How about this?" Ginny came strutting towards them after a talk with Pansy and Blaise. "Let's make a challenge. The first one to ask their crush out on a date to Hogsmeade wins"
"You finally look decent, mate!" Ron
"Is she always this mad at everything?" Draco turned to Ron, who just kept quiet the whole walk round. Draco was the one who led the group to the back. Standing close by him were Ron and Hermione. While Harry was talking with Blaise and Pansy—which seems to me has better improvement than Draco with his friends. Possibly because Harry doesn't really have a history with Pansy and Blaise before Draco, while as his boyfy over her does. He was punched in the face by Hermione for fuck sake.
"Oh," Draco smirked, "Already backing out now, Potter?"
like to make fun of the main characters in general.
Draco nodded and chuckled, "Yeah, it is kinda embarrassing"
"So... are you two gonna continue snogging or...?" The couple looked back at Voldemort who was still sitting on his chair, a book in one hand, and a glass of butterbeer in the other. Both mirrored each other, looking down sheepishly. "I better get going" Harry finally said. He turned around to Draco, smiled, and kissed his cheek softly. "See you around?"
Harry sighed, moving away from the books he's been flipping through. "Not a damn thing" He groaned, "What type of fucking game is this?"
"No! Gosh, darn it, Ron!" Hermione looked up, quill still dangling in between her fingers. Harry laughed quietly, trying not to wake up unwanted students. "To make you feel better, Ron. Gay men would love to go out with you"
"Oh my god! Harry! Why do you have to do that, you dramatic arsehole!" Hermione slapped his knees, making him laugh louder.
Draco waved, sitting
Just as she expected, the desk Ron was working on transfigured into a pig. Everyone shrieked and laughed as the pig continues to push the objects around it. Hermione gaped the Weasley as he laughed uncontrollably, "It's not funny! It's not even close to our spell!"
He could feel his breath getting heavier every second and it hurts him even more—it hurts
"Sorry for being such a sap. I just didn't want to think that we're disrespecting you in any way." She said, "I haven't really had a gay friend,"
"It's the legs" He lied
"But it's the truth!" Voldy exclaimed.
"This." Harry looked back at the stars that filled the sky like pale corn into
speechless by his beauty. I know I am.
But shit ain't gonna work in this universe, baby.
"Don't mention it. But next time, I suggest you use a Silencio spell. Okay?" He smirked and walked away back to his room in the castle, leaving both the boys flushed in embarrassment.
"I actually find it rather cheeky sneaking around like this" Draco replied with a smirk. Harry chuckled, "I'm being serious."
Harry furrowed in surprised, "Not much? That's an insane amount of awards"
a lazy way to write a plot.
He cleared his throat and looked back to the room.
Harry continued to laugh. "Sorry, sorry! But yeah, that's possibly it. We haven't actually — officially label us as anything but with the number of times we've been secretly seeing each other, it felt like we were together. We try not to... snog that often,"
dressed up for nothing" Eyeing his gorgeous suit. Draco smirked, "It's a surprise," He said as he snatched Pansy's glass and gulped it down. He grimaced. "What the fuck was that?"
They woke up knowing damn well this won't be another usual day of Harry and Draco's hetero adventures. People are still shocked after the events of yesterday. There's just a lot to process. Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter are gay. They think they hate each other but instead takes each other as a date for the ball. Was there a secret dare Draco pushed Harry to do or vice versa? Were they actually friends this whole time? Are they just
"Focus, Harry!" Hermione snapped him back to reality. Harry blinked and nodded frantically, "Yeah, yeah"
"Graphic" Draco laughed, "Sure. But if I die, I want you to carve '
"It's very hard to brew but the effects are beyond astonishing. Just look at this maniac" She pointed at Voldemort who has continued the lesson by making notes on the blackboard using his wand. "He's acting as if the class wasn't made to prepare students for his attack. Ironic, innit?"
. He squinted his eyes, scanning through the students of glamourous outfits.
It's true. I'm not saying the Slytherins might feel a bit of a gay vibe between their Slytherin Prince and The Chosen One, but they kinda felt a gay vibe between their Slytherin Prince and The Chosen One. "I'm sorry again for my friends."
The latter furrowed, "Are you breaking up with me?"
A peal of burst laughter was heard from behind, which made Draco jolted up, almost dropping his wand. "Lovebitus deletus?" He sneakered. Draco turned around and furrowed, walking up to him and whispered, "Potter?" Eyes roaming around the room to see if he's there.
am. I wasn't—"
"Too late" Ron glared. Harry—who's been noticing their shitty remarks—walked up to them, in his glamourous attempt to stop them. "Can we all not?"
"That time he openly checked you out?!" Hermione asked, moving her seat closer to Harry as she speaks. Harry furrowed, "What?"
"Mate, you know you can tell us anything right? Even if it's a hard pill to swallow, we'd still be friends no matter what" Ron told him, sitting down next to him on the carpeted floor.
He laughed, looking around the room, encouraging others to laugh with him. No one did. "He's turned you soft, that weak loser—"
Not being able to finish his sentence, Draco pulled him away from the wall and pointed his wand at him—the spell he cast shoved the nameless bitch across the room, causing him to hit the hard dungeon wall and was soon left unconscious.
Hermione rolled her eyes, "Here we go again"
Harry couldn't go to sleep that night. He was too nervous about tomorrow. Fucking Yule Ball. Dancing in front of a crowd — and with his mortal enemy would be the talk of the century. He was dramatizing on that part but it still would be big news. Yet, his night might turn around.
tone, Ron let out a loud hiccup, startling the group in the compartment. "That doesn't sound good—" He hiccuped once more before his head grew bigger than my teacher's ego and redder than my score. His eyes watered like a reservoir before Harry and Hermione laughed, pinching the bridge of their nose as a ghastly smell filled their space and then finally turning back to normal.
Harry tucked his hands inside the pocket of his coat before realized he had something stuffed at the bottom. He looked up, "Do you want some?" Harry asked. Possibly an attempt to make thing less awkward. They have never gone out publicly like this before, and with strangers chasing subtle glances at them, it's bound to get awkward at some point. Draco furrowed. "And what are you offering, exactly?"
this scene in the movie is so boring so we're gonna spruce it up with some Drarry. Which we all deserve.
He turned to see Draco in the entrance of the great hall. He looked dashing.
He never knew Hermione's lungs were capable of doing that. Harry quickly ran up to them, to Ron who's holding Hermione back before she punches another Slytherin in their pretty face. That went from zero to a hundred real quick. "What is going on?"
B: "It's the unicorn blood, I tell you. I heard they can make people who drink it gay"
Draco tidied himself up and walked to the bar with confidence. The others stayed, hiding behind a wall as they watched Draco talking to the bartender. Soon they saw a smiling Draco waving at them to follow him. They did and was escorted to a room where Midna Thistlethorps was enjoying a drink with her friends, preparing for her show that night.
"Actually he does" Harry smiled teasingly.
Disappointed but not surprised, she shrugged. "Yes, Professor"
"Not him, you Buffon!" She smacked his arm lightly. "I was talking to you! What are you standing here for? Go, stop them!"
And zero inches away when Harry pulled Draco into a kiss.
Harry can't help but laugh, cheeks reddening slightly as he looked down at his feet to stop it from ruining their show. Draco also pulled back a smile. "I don't have time for your incompetent DADA skills, Malfoy"
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Was it something we said that made you choose him over us?"
Harry chuckled softly, "Yes, it's okay. I thought I'd be angrier once I knew who the person—or people—who put my name in the goblet. Instead, I'm actually okay with it"
"Now?" Draco furrowed at him.
Harry laughed lightly, "Oh, come on! I have nobody to take to the dance. Every time they asked me who, I just directly think about you"
He smirked. "Yup. I know about your little dirty secret. No wonder you agreed to hang out with the Gryffindors. You like one of them"
"Shhh" Harry and Ron shushed Hermione, who continues to glares at Draco dead in the eye. Draco
But there was really nothing the teachers could do. He would get detention, sure, but that's that. Mostly because of his father, Lucius Malfoy. He is basically that PTA Karen at school who would complain every goddamn day about useless things that cannot be fixed.
"First of all, they hate you, not me," Harry said.
"It's not an obsession, Mione. It's merely an observation" Ron tried to defend himself.
"Not really, mate." Ron admitted, "You might have to be more clearer than that"
Draco can't help but smile. "It's just... a bit weird that they didn't tell me anything. Usually Pansy would keep me updated with this pranking shit—and I would've told you. BUt they didn't"
"Shut up, you nameless bitch. Your life's
Draco sighed softly, eyes still stuck at the blue waters. Again, well aware of who it was. "I've had better days" He responded with his usual reply.
Harry was walking alone back to his dorm room when he heard someone calling him. He turned and saw Malfoy hiding behind one of the pillars. His face was shackled in worry. Harry looked around before walking towards him. "How are you feeling? Are you okay? Do you need anything?" Draco quickly asked, holding him by the shoulders.
Draco and Harry saw Voldemort and Severus at the door and danced their way to them. "Hi, professors! Come on! Dance with us" He said with a wide smile, extending his arm to grab. He looked down at the hand, "......no" He said in his iconic way of saying things.
"Well, the debate has already started" Hermione glared at Harry, "It only makes sense."
, standing beside Krum's date in the middle of the room. "Cedric Diggory of Hogwarts," Dumbledore continued before the hall roared in cheers. He smiled
Draco snorted as if it's the most ridiculous bullshit he's ever heard. "You would lock yourself in your room and cry yourself to sleep"
Now Draco is sure this man is supposed to be in Slytherin.
"No, no. We don't need tickets" Pansy quickly said. "We just wanted an autograph."
, he's as big of a nerd as Hermione Granger.
"Me. Obviously" Harry shrugged and smiled when he heard laughter from afar. Draco couldn't help but laugh. "Hm. Okay... And a butterbeer as well?"
It's their fifth year and man do they all look fireeee. Let's see what they're up to this time.
"Did this all start from that time he publicly flirts with you but we all shrugged it off, thinking he's just joking and there's no way he'll be gay for you?"
"Are you admitting that I'm not a dick now? Well that's the best compliment you have ever given me so far"
"No worries, go on," Voldemort said calmly before sinking back into his book.
"There's no way they can look gayer than that" Snape pointed out, watching as Draco tilted his head to the side, walking closer to Harry. McGonagall agreed. "Yeah, I'm gonna disperse them before they start to kiss each other in the middle of the field,"
"What?" He mumbled as he popped that something into his mouth. Draco grimaced. "They're chocolate balls, obviously. Don't tell me you haven't tried them"
"Oh! The special something they meant was a special someone!" Ron just realized, as if it's not already bloody obvious. Hermione, Ron, and his other friends all watched in hopes that Harry can arrive safely. "I hope he's not dead" Neville muttered, which low-key speaks for all of them.
"That's the whole reason why we're here. Get my mind off tomorrow. Steal you one last time before everyone else does." He sighed and smiled
Draco kissed back for a mere second before pushing Harry away. "Sorry, babe. For boyfriend only" He teased once again. But yeah, that ain't gonna happen. "Fuck off"
"You're making me look bad in this" Ron said, pointing at his suit. He had a nice classic hand-me-down robe he got sent from his mother. Which
Seamus laughed and nodded in agreement, "Honestly, you're right" Realizing the many times Draco says the word Potter, almost every day — and night.
Harry furrowed at that. Draco stopped and pointed up. "Up there. See that crooked window?"
"I was going to my dorm. I honestly have no idea where else to go."
Now, he's making him blush. "I love you, Harry. I never said this to you but I guess the stars can make us admit things we never thought of saying out loud"
"Bloody hell's a yelp?"
"How did she take it?" Harry asked.
Harry turned around, just now realizing that Voldemort's standing right behind him. Voldemort hadn't seen his face, but from the way his back muscles just tightened must indicate something, right? "I was the one who let him meet with Draco," Voldemort told the boy.
said to Draco after Hermione glared at
"Not fair. Our pick then. We'll do whatever the others told us to do"
It's when he noticed he felt the same way too, only this time for Malfoy. How? All they ever do was fight and argue, right?
"Oh, right. The ball" Harry forgot about the ball. He was so busy with preparing for the real competition that the ball just easily slipped out of his mind. "How about Cho?" Ron suggested, taking a big bite on his sausage. Well.
Harry chuckled, watching as Ron bludged himself into the sample and Hermione playfully glaring at him and telling him to stop. Without looking back at Draco, he teased, "You know what else you look hot eating?"
"Because you didn't tell me to?!" Ron said. The rest can't help but laugh—including Hermione. "Why do I have to tell you to do the simplest things? If I ask you to jump off a cliff, would you do it?"
Draco is tired of this bullshit, Donald. He rolled his eyes in annoyance. "Stop it, you're making me blush" His sarcastic tone hitting perfectly with the rest of the Slytherins.
, man. All the girls
"I'm just— Why didn't you tell us, Draco?" Pansy asked softly. Draco sighed, "Because—Because I figured you would react the way that you did."
Harry laughed. "Then enjoy it while you can"
friends with the professors of Hogwarts. What's he doing now? He owns a farmer's market in Scotland and is now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher there. I know, ironic yet iconic.
Dumbledore smirked, "Not like it's your first time isn't it, Severus? With Lily"
"Look!" Ron pointed inside. The rest joined in, looking through the cold blurry windows. Draco squinted in his attempt to see clearer, "Who? I can't see shit"
"Merlin, stop! It's in my head!" Ron complained, burying his head into his palms.
Like the dramatic bitch he is and flew straight
"You wouldn't be here if it weren't for my big mouth" Harry commented
"Don't. For the sake of both our dignities."
"Then stop being a fucking flirt," he mumbled as his hands traveled around the latter's clothed back. Draco moaned as Harry left another dark mark on his neck—but it's not shaped like a snake cause that'd be weird.
He nodded. "And which insomniac night did you think to say that?"
"Why is Harry Potter saving his enemy from the lake?"
"Bloody hell, mate!"
The latter groaned, "Ugh. Fine!" He would then stomp away towards Draco's room and change into one of his shirts.
Harry nodded, preparing to take a leap of faith like Miles Morales. "You got the potion?" Hermione asked to make sure. Ron feels like he's still back home with his mother. Harry nodded, "Yes."
He sighed before taking his bag, slinging it over his shoulder. He bent down and kissed Harry gently on his lips before messing up his boyfriend's hair like a boy petting their pet dog. "Good luck tomorrow. I know you can do it" He winked before walking to Voldemort and out the door.
They held their breaths as they could see the shadow walking towards them. That is until they heard another voice coming from downstairs. "Ronald! Get down here this instant!"
"Don't tell me you're actually jealous of my mother" Draco laughed, earning a grin from Harry as he did. "I also told her about us" Draco continued.
irrelevant that even the author didn't bother to think of a name for you!" Draco gritted. The Slytherin group all of a sudden turned silent the second they saw someone standing behind Draco.
But what Neville said afterward calmed him down, just a tad bit. "Honestly, there's just no way that's true." Longbottom finally chimed in. "It's very much a well-known fact that they hate each other's guts."
"Potter!" Voldemort called, who also noticed Harry's focus. "What did I say about staring at attractive people?"
"She's not even in our class — You're just saying that to annoy me, didn't you?" Ron turned to her. Harry laughed softly. "I guess her plan worked"
Harry smiled smugly. "Honestly, Malfoy. I'd love to ruin that white pale face of yours," Draco almost dropped with a smile, but stopped once Harry moved closer, eyes darkening and voice deeper. "But I have better things in mind that I'm sure would make you fall into your knees"
Harry laughed at the offended Ron, "Well that's rude..."
Draco rolled his eyes. "Oh, save it, Weasley. Might as well question the moral grounds of all of Slytherin. Trust me, you won't like them"
Draco nodded, "Yeah! Why not buy him chocolate or something?"
"Yes, they are! They're both sweet and not good for you"
"Go on! Show him what you can do" Blaise added. Both Blaise and Pansy looked at each other knowingly. Finally getting his shit back together, he chuckled and looked back at him. "Of course Harry Potter would want a fight. Isn't that what you are? A man only born to fight a war?"
Weasley's face lit up and whispered to Hermione's ear, "It's the secret guy he's been fancying, huh?"
Draco turned over his shoulder to see Ron and Hermione walking behind the boy of his
"But what? Your father? He won't be at the dance. And I'll make sure that none of this is informed to your father. I'll also tell Voldemort and Dumbledore to help. Or what, your friends? They're rubbish if they stop being friends with you just because you're into blokes. Okay if they hate me, but no if they hate that you're gay. You deserve better, Draco. You deserve all the love in the world. You deserve happiness," he kissed him, "You deserve to be in love," and again, "You deserve to be loved," and again, "You deserve better," one last time, "You deserve having friends and family who support you — whoever you want to be. It's a goddamn privilege for someone to be in your life. So if they did not use that goddamn privilege well, fuck them off like how I fuck you every night."
Snaped sighed, "It's not—"
The green-eyed boy bent over, attempting to get closer. But that was a dumb thing to do which then caused them to go off balance and fell with Draco at the bottom.
"It is! What is he doing here?"
He smiled softly. "I'm okay. You're not.. mad?"
, "If I ever say no to that, I want you to Kedavra me this instant." Harry can't help but laugh as he takes his hand out to the dance floor. Music started and everyone
"What the fuck?!"
He took off his invisibility cloak and showed himself to the handsome young blond in front of him. "Hi," He said softly, trying not to wake up his roommates. "What are you doing here?" Draco asked. "You're not supposed to be here!"
"What is wrong with you and periods?" Hermione looked at him, arms crossed. Roon shook his head, "Nothing. It's weird. It's science. I love science" He said before continue eating.
"He's asking you to fight," Pansy told him from behind. She knew that's not what he meant, but she's just testing a theory.
asked. Sorry, Harry. He
Harry rested his hand on the couch's neck behind Draco's head. He chuckled when he realized what he meant. "Maybe you should ask him, I'm sure he'd say yes," He said, sipping his tea.
Nerd jock at it's finest.
She shrugged. "It's cuter that way. His name triggers people"
Unlike you, I am very likeable
"Uh, sort of," Pansy said. "She won like 793 Wrammys and 129 Wizards Choice Awards, which is not bad for a long-time witch singer like herself"
"He's not always... polite with him," Harry said, still watching his man walking away. They walk so slow.
. Harry and Draco joked as they
"What the—"
"We were literally on top—"
"Yeah, we weren't
"Ow, shit!" Blaise cursed after accidentally bumping his head on the top shelf. The rest chuckled before Hermione silence them when she heard footsteps arriving on top of the stairs. "Hey, Nana. Are you okay?" The voice mumbling through the closed doors of the closet. Everyone listened intently. They heard footsteps after mumbles before Hermione glares at Ron and Harry for being too loud. Pansy peaked through the little gap between the closet doors and cursed, "Shit, they're walking closer"
Hermione smiled before noticing Harry's focused on something else—or in his case someone, but they still don't know that. "Harry?"
"We were pretending?" Harry teased with a smile. Draco rolled his eyes, "Shut up. Your eyes are proving otherwise." Of course, he noticed the details in his eyes. "I've never seen you this happy before," Draco decided to point out the obvious.
"But haven't you checked there already?" Hermione furrowed with a book in her hand. Harry shrugged, "There are a lot of books, Hermione," he said before walking to the back of the library. The corridor gets darker the further he walked, but he seems determined to find what he needs.
The Slytherin stayed quiet for a bit. "Haven't talked to them. I just... hope they're not too... judgy" He sighed and stopped, burying his face in his palms. Harry turned to look at him with genuine worry. He didn't reply. Instead, he held him close, kissing his temple gently. Letting his embrace and the slightly cold air help Draco find comfort.
Harry couldn't help but shake his head with a chuckle. "You're an idiot"
Why did that sound like Gordon Ramsay inside my head?
"You know I'm okay with it, right?"
"Even if he's a homophobic piece of shit who deserves nothing but torcher and death," Snape answered. "Come on now, Draco. You've got some explaining to do"
"Honestly, people. I have no time for this. I am stressed out and my fucking assistant," She hissed at her elf, "didn't even think of bringing my goddamn fag,"
"Fine," Draco said with a smirk. The blond looked behind him to see Voldemort still enjoying his book and a tall glass of Butterbeer he stole from the teacher's lounge prior to coming here. Draco looked back to meet the latter's green eMeRaLd eyes. He leaned over and whispered something that made the boy shiver like he was in fucking Narnia. "You like that, Potter?" he whispered in his ear, knowing damn well what he just did.
This, unfortunately, added more hatred from Ron and Hermione towards Draco.
Harry smiled softly, pulling Draco's head closer. "Yes, of course. He's not the only coward in the relationship" Harry smiled when he heard Draco giggle. Shit, can somebody please make a studio album out of that? He moved closer and pulled him into a soft kiss. "Are we gonna always be like this? Sneaking around..."
Even if he expected this question coming, he still didn't want it. But he answered anyway. Because he's a kind Gryffindor with great social skills. "What?"
Draco shrugged. "Definitely a better choice"
towards Draco.
"Then let them," Harry said, intertwining his fingers with Malfoy's. "I'm proud to have you with me as a partner. Are you?"
"Wow. You must be a wizard"
Harry laughed. "Don't worry, I ruined mine years ago" The hero smiled at Draco's light giggle. They eventually decided to just skip breakfast and spend the morning outside. It was the weekend anyway. Most of the students would be in the dining hall or their rooms, so the outdoors felt like it was made just for them.
So, the initial idea was that the winner will walk in with his/her date.
Hermione couldn't stop but compliment the suit, which is very good she must add. "I love your look" The suit, not him.
The latter rolled his eyes fondly, smiling softly that the boy across him. "I'm not your boyfriend"
"You're going to
"Thank you," The golden boy said, "Now if you'll excuse me, I have homowork to do — I mean homework. Not — Not homowork. Because that's dumb. And I'm not gay. Like at all. Obviously. No. Straight. Yes gay. I mean, no! Not! Fuck!"
Tired of this goddamn conversation, Ron rolled his eyes and tugged Hermione's arm. "Come on, Mione. I can't stand being near this git" He snarled, turning away to face Harry. "Good luck, mate"
may love and peace surrounds them at all times.
"Huh, yes. Granger.  Well, dear Granger. Just in case you haven't noticed, we're in my class now. So, if I want to teach page 394," he paused dramatically, "then I will teach page 394!" He shouted obnoxiously loud. The class went quieter than silent. Realizing what he just did, Voldemort adjusted his cloak and cleared his throat before speaking a lot softer this time. "Am I clear, Ms. Granger?"
took out the broom he never got time to store
Honesty, love. You should've known. He owns these walls. So don't you even thinking of fucking with him. Harry's an exception.
He huffed and sat down next to him, giving no more than zero words as Draco continues reading and Harry staring at the fireplace. His jaw clenched and his eyes burning as much as the one he's staring at. "So, wanna talk about it, plonker?" He asked in a rather hushed tone.
The latter laughed and nodded. "Right. Into a cookie dough"
The topic became a bit personal when it came to love and shit like that. Which was sort of like a cue for Voldemort and Snape to walk out. Narcissa never actually had a chance to talk and meet with Draco's past girlfriends—or whatever he wants to call it. Beards?
Harry laughed lightly. At least that was able to calm him down a bit. "Well, just promise you won't freak out"
Hermione furrowed at the boy. "I second that, but carry on."
Draco chuckled lightly, realizing what he might look like from their perspective. He shrugged, "Pretty much. Wanna join, Zabini?" He asked smirking, opening up his quilt to give room. Both laughed as he shook his head, "Nah. I wouldn't want to smell like you when I wake up tomorrow"
Well.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Scared, Potter?" He can't help but smile as he let Potter drag him to the entrance hall and was surprised to see Hermione and Ron waiting for them. He groaned, "What are you two doing here?"
"Hello..." He stretched his word. Draco turned and glared at them—mostly at Hermione. "You guys really suck at planning"
Hermione sighed in defeat. Snape told them about Midna being in Hogsmeade, but they didn't know she'd be in a pub. "We can't." Harry said, "None of us is legal of age to get in."
button on and instinctively stepped forward.
“Point taken,” Draco said, then, “Is Grimmauld Place an option?”
“That… did not go well,” Potter said after a moment.
There was a sharp intake of breath. “Come on, Malfoy. We’re almost to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey, she—she’ll fix you right up. It’ll only be a little while yet.”
“WHAT IS GOING ON?” The ginger—a young Ron Weasley, presumably—shouted. He looked even more confused than usual.
It seemed to him like he’d traded in one prison for another. Only this one was bereft of his parents, and left him with even less options than before. He was more alone than ever. What could he do—just obey? He couldn’t kill himself now, not without doing the same to Severus in the process. Something dark and primal within him rebuked the thought. But what was left for him, then? The prowling inside his head increased. The wolf hated feeling trapped. That was one thing they could agree on.
“You know already?”
Draco awoke with a shuddering gasp, the last vestiges of his dream fading away until he could recall any of it at all. After the initial shock of displacement subsided, the world seemed to right itself and his surroundings became evident. There was the familiar vaulted ceiling of the Hogwarts infirmary above him, and the taste of antiseptic sat heavily upon his tongue. It took him a moment to realize, exactly, why he was there. The events of the night prior seemed suddenly very far away, almost like they had happened to someone else entirely.
As soon as the train pulled up and came to a stop at King’s Cross I hurried out of the train and went to pick up my luggage. I heard Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle calling out to me to wait for them, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to go home so I wouldn’t have to worry about bumping into Harry at the platform. Unfortunately, that was exactly what happened when I hurried out of the station to find my parents so we could return to the manor. I’m not sure who was at fault, but I guess neither of us were looking at where we were going in our hurry t get out of there. Our trolleys were knocked over and our luggage fell to the ground with a loud crash. “Hey! Watch where the hell you’re going-“ I blurted out before I could think of anything else to say. “Sorry-“ Harry mumbled back and quickly picked his luggage up and hurried in the direction he had been heading before we collided. I just about noticed the tears in Harry’s eyes as he walked past me. I spun around and stared after him, I wanted to grab his arm and pull him back and hug him, but he was gone before I could do anything. Flashbacks from our fight appeared in my head and just like that I was alone again. I took a deep breath and started walking out to the parking lot to find my parents.
As the fourth year went by Draco and I kept meeting different places around the castle in secret. And step by step we took a little bit further every time we met. We basically spend most of the year messing around and testing each other’s limits. I guess you could say that we were just trying to distract ourselves from the inevitable, the summer break. Neither one of us were looking forward to spending two months not being able to see each other. I think Draco had started to soften up whenever he was around me. His usual spiteful self, kind of disappeared over the past few months. I tried to talk to him about taking the next step and start dating, but every time I tried to open that conversation he shut me down saying he wasn’t ready to make us an official thing yet and that we still had to figure out a bunch of stuff before we should tell anyone about us. I would be lying if I said that it didn’t hurt, but I knew that nothing good would come out of pushing him.
Fucking hell. This is not how Draco expects this conversation to turn around. He honestly should just cut to the chase. Just kill him, honestly. Rather than suffering another round of this bullshit. Like a wise Harry Styles once said, comfortable silence is so overrated.
Draco nodded slowly. "So, nothing can be controlled?"
They chuckled lightly. "We won't" The rest of the group thanked them once more deciding to run back upstairs and go out the way they came from. But remember, shit's never gonna turn out like that if Harry Potter is around.
"The poster!" Hermione pointed, wiping off the mist on the window. "It's Midna Thistlethorps"
And just in time too. Voldemort came strutting in, letting his extensive cloak cover the tracks behind him. His face was visibly tired after teaching children the whole day. He was too tired to debate when Dumbledore asked if Voldemort could be in charge of detention but the second he saw the room, he sighed in relief. "Oh, it's you two. Thank goodness" He said, plopping himself onto a chair.
