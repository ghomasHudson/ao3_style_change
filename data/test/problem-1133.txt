"Hey, you dropped this." Harry gave Blaise a bright smile, showing off his slightly crooked teeth. Dressed in his regular school clothing, he looked like he did every other day. Dark charcoal colored hair fell over his scar and the tan skin of his forehead, which Blaise thought could have used a bit of fixing. With his big smile and slightly ruffled clothing, Blaise thought Harry was actually pretty attractive.
"Harry, you better go quickly. The Dark Lord has Draco," said a beautiful redhead. Her cherry red hair was pulled back into a neat braid, trailing to the middle of her back. Dressed in a flowing black cape with the usual Hogwarts uniform, it was easy to identify that she was a fellow Gryffindor. "He said he'll let him go if you give yourself-"
She would send presents, she would make sure they had money, but her love would always be from a distance.
Unbidden, Narcissa thought of her cousins. Sirius and Regulus. They’d both been competent and Regulus had been a levelheaded cool young man. But then, there
want to be here. She’d never meant to come back, she’d meant to either die out on missions or fake her death if the recurring suspicions proved correct and live the rest of her life alone as a hermit or put herself on the Draught of Living Death to avoid it all. Cygnus touched her face but Corvus refused to let his death-grip go and tried to press himself closer. She suspected if he tried to open his mouth he would openly sob.
, capoeira was more along the lines of martial arts to be honest, Irish step dancing, I suppose I was even alright with quadrille when the partners are fun, same with the German waltz…Tinikling, oh now there was something interesting. Oh and
He would talk sometimes about what ‘they’ or ‘we’ did or said. Never who they were, never how many of them there were; undoubtedly other escaped Death Eaters. She turned her attention onto the cat instead. She could see why they’d call him that- his fur certainly did the name credit in color.
“What's her problem?” Fred mumbled, his twin helping him back up from where he'd landed after her escape. George frowned. Ginny frowned too.
“Didn’t think I was a Potter.” she said easily. “I don’t exactly look like you and nobody ever talked about a Potter girl.”
That didn’t help at all with the rushing confusion because if she wasn’t being tortured or killed, what was she here for? It’d been made plenty clear since she was first introduced to the magical side that the Dark Lord wanted her dead. Was she…A prisoner? Kidnapped of course so obviously she was a prisoner but why? As a blow to the other side? To keep her out of the way? To gloat about how easily she’d been snatched from under their noses?
She stared down at her arm emptily, green eyes hard. Her grim gaze moved to the scars caressing her wheatish skin. The thin ones from where kelpie had wrapped their fingers around her in the lake when she'd been shoved in during First Year. The small crescent one curving the edge of her jaw from when she was tripped and one from a Gryffindor's hex, another wrapped around her ankle. Yet another two from her own Housemates, all Second Year. From Third Year, the scar on her knee from being shoved down the moving staircases and managing to hit something sharp. The huge jagged claw marks on her shoulder from some beast out in the Forbidden Forest when she'd been chased there and forced to spend the night before the centaurs had found her- mostly Firenze. She'd had to go to St. Mungos for a little over two weeks for that. Fourth Year saw a small burn scar on the side of her thigh just under the crease of her arse, curse-purpled skin that refused to lighten. And her Fifth Year had her own small writing printed as a scar on her right hand, 'I must not tell lies.' from the detentions she was ordered to.
. For your first…Allow me to enlighten you, young Poppy Potter.” he smiled a little wider, leaning closer. She was already against the backboard of the bed but squished herself as far back as she was able. She felt more than saw his arm move, settling in next to her hip and trapping her there as he shifted closer. “You are mine.” he told her.
a fourth of the population here? I believe transparency is the best tactic in this situation and there’s no policy against me saying any of this from the Confederation.”
She wondered if they’d even thought Mimoza would need it, even if it did go as they thought. She would have been kidnapped and attacked by a Basilisk and wouldn’t that need counseling surely? She was glad she didn’t need it, who knows what they’d find in her head after all but
because of the long held cultural preference of having what constitutes as ‘pure’ blood. I really do urge you to look into it, especially ones that come from different states and governments as the ones here tend to be snuffed out by Pureblood zealots. If, however, you
“Perhaps that was not specific enough. No need to fret, young Poppy Potter.” he assured her and really, it wasn’t reassuring at all. “You will come to no harm here.”
“The spell could make us impervious to most magics and injuries.” Ron said thoughtfully, “But would cut our lives a bit short doing it, giving us only fifteen years after it's cast.”
like my own.” she threw a thick letter on the bed. “There’s the deed to the new house. Since I won’t be needing it anymore.”
Aside, of course, from wincing concern that a fourteen year old would be forced to compete in a tournament meant for of age magic folk and that people have died in previously. He looked at her again.
“Would you prefer I was perhaps a doormat or pushover? Were I that, nothing would get done and I most certainly wouldn’t have gotten hired into the Confederation. Quite a lousy employee I would be then, wouldn’t I?”
“She’ll give Ron a run for his money,” Dean said, nose scrunched up a little. Well, at least now Jasper wouldn’t have to deal with those two trying to flirt with his sister.
getting to that.” Edsel sighed. “Boys, this is Helle Heath. She’s a local muggleborn we’re helping. She’s Theodore’s age.”
“Hm? I suppose so. We have ample reason to believe that he had used horcruxes. For those of you who don’t know, since Dark Arts are not so much as hinted about besides how to fight against it without knowing even the basic magical theories about it…Ahem, right. Horcruxes are when a wixen splits their own soul in half and imparts it into an object or, occasionally, a living thing such as a familiar.”
“Do you know what happens when you use an Unforgivable Tom? It warps the magical core a little bit. Balanced, it would be fine. But the Unforgivables are habit-forming. Especially the Cruciatus Curse. The Killing Curse will sever your soul because you just tore someone else’s soul out entirely. The Imperius is habit forming only because of the rush people will feel having total control over another person, total domination. It can be overpowered, but it’s the least offensive and considering it turns the victim into little more than a puppet, stripping away free will and conscious thought that is saying something. But the Cruciatus…” she trailed off and he was hauled upright, her small hand managing to pick him up and prop him up with ease. “That drives people insane. It is the death of that person in that their personality, who they were, is all gone. It destroys someone’s entire
her. He made small talk, chatted about this happening or that, little things that really told her nothing. He didn’t speak about his family either. Or where they were, or what he was doing when he wasn’t in this room with her.
Pearl came back down, swatting her long dark hair behind her shoulder. He smiled at his wonderful wife hopelessly. “You can put it up.”
But when she had initially woken alone in the small room it wasn’t that long before Malfoy had entered, already pulling his outer robe off to neatly hang up on a hook on the door. He had not looked at her right away, instead taking care of taking off his boots, socks, gloves and taking the ribbon from his hair. Only for a moment, only for him to brush through it with his fingers absently before tying it back again. He just looked like a man going about his daily routine and it had greatly unnerved her. When he’d finally turned to her in his plain white shirt and crisp black trousers, he’d examined her for a quiet moment before greeting her quietly.
“M-M-Ms. Sinistra! Escorting a s-s-s-student?” he greeted nervously, fiddling with his thin gloves. Leather perhaps Poppy thought, in a pale creamy color. Nice looking at least. “O-Only one this time?”
He was quick to make his way to his sister’s room, ignoring anyone he was passing by and only pausing when he was in the right corridor to make sure no one was around. They didn’t need to know where she stayed or how to get in. He took a few deep breaths before swiftly gaining entrance and hurrying up the stairs, wishing they were like the ones to Dumbledore’s office that moved by themselves.
“And all for what? For the majority of them to go into journalism without a formal education or government without knowing political theory, or work in shops or restaurants and the like! Maybe one might be skilled enough in a field to join a Guild or Association if they’re lucky enough. Learning on the job is one thing, being grossly unprepared and uneducated for it is another! And critical thinking skills, or problem solving? None! Nearly none! Apparently it’s not
“In peculiar cases like this one.” Ludo Bagman shrugged easily. “It has happened before. Which is to say, she can earn points all she wants but in the end only one of the enrolled students can actually win the title. Nevertheless, if her points somehow exceeds her opponents then she’ll be getting half as many galleons as the actual winner.”
what you just said because I don’t like it’. The Confederation is becoming impatient and if nothing changes or another war starts up, we
“Were not based on blood. Familial connection, perhaps, but you could have just as easily gone to any distant cousin from the Pureblood side of your family and done the same. Likely would have been better,” he mused absentmindedly, “To have had a magical barrier that could feed from the magics of a magic rich household.” he peered at her. “While I had many Blacks and others from those circles in my service, I did not have all of them and you are most closely related to them through your grandmother. Several of them had made a small ruckus of it even. Your grandmother Dorea was a beloved family member after all. Unfortunately, their reputation as a whole had taken quite a blow from followers like Bellatrix and extreme purists and they were dismissed entirely when Dumbledore had proclaimed you to be in a safe place. Any others closely related to you were rejected in much the same fashion after the Ministry had set their own wards around that awful muggle neighborhood.”
“Waking up Ms. Potter?” came the gentle query and she grumbled to herself before turning and snuggling down. “Now that won’t do. Wouldn’t you finally like to get up out of that cot?” the coaxing, pleasant voice asked her and she considered it before turning slightly and trying to lift herself. “Easy now, careful.” cool hands helped her up. She turned her gaze to the man and he smiled at her. Now Mimosa was never one who was good at guessing ages, and even worse when it came to magic folk since they all seemed to age a little differently but he looked probably a few fair years younger than, say, her aunt and uncle. His hair was dark brown and he looked like he hadn’t been outside in years he was so pale but his eyes were practically luminous.
Stunned, Narcissa stared at the woman. Surely, they couldn’t do that? The only thing wrong with the Ministry was their bowing to Muggleborn families and banning Dark Arts! And there was nothing wrong with their education!
“Oh, it’s beautiful. It’ll go right above the fireplace.” Hattie took it delicately. The cloth it was embroidered into was a faint periwinkle, the blooms a mix of black, blues and purples. The stitching for her name and the date beneath it were in fine navy.
“And those bath oils were bloody fantastic.” Ron sighed happily. “If anything feels so nice as that, and makes my skin so soft and all then I’m all for it and we have mostly been focusing on our general education.”
She stepped clumsily, scowling at the gentle way Lucius led her along after helping her balance herself. She was temporarily made blind as he led her somewhere and she was tense. Were they finally going to do what she had been kidnapped for? But then she was feeling something she hadn’t in a long while- a breeze. The spell against her vision lifted and she had to blink rapidly to try and adjust a little easier to the sudden light. She was still in cuffs, her arms tautly pulled behind her back and she was still a captive but there was a sudden surge of such gratitude that it almost crushed her chest. They were in a meadow, standing just outside of a doorway and it was beautiful. The greens and then the sky was an intense, deep blue with pretty picturesque clouds and far from them was the edges of what she felt might be a forest and she ached at how beautiful it was.
Things like horcuxes. She was going to get the one in her removed by the Goblins soon. Her health had been deteriorating lately and Dumbledore was absolutely positive it was because the Veil was trying to collect the rest of Voldemort’s soul. She would be more than happy to hand it over, but it required an extremely delicate process.
Veronica watched her friend dart away, unable to walk among her classmates. She hated them, hated them all for that, hated that she couldn't talk to one of her friends without fearing the backlash. Nev and her could talk like normal students, could walk together and be seen together but not Harry. Her eyes dimmed a little. It wasn't like Ron herself could do anything. She stood in her older brothers shadows, even the one her fierce little sister had. They all had something, talents and skills and
“Policy. Regardless of his crimes, we are to treat the convicted humanely, including what is here considered to be Beings and Creatures. Since, however, he has virtually what amounts to no soul we need not abide. Our interrogators, I’m sure, will be pleased as it is easier to get out answers and information without having to worry about the rights of whomever they have in custody.” she shrugged lightly, a pleasant smile on her face.
She still hated this, hated it all and was bitterer than she would ever admit. Just as she would never admit that she was getting a little antsy. Her purpose there still hadn’t been explained and they went about their days. She locked on the bed besides using the loo or shower or the occasion where Lucius would deem her docile enough for the time to let her use a muggle elliptical. He’d said something about trophies or something and weakening muscles. She’d wanted to point out- shout really- that she wouldn’t be weakening her muscles if she weren’t chained to the goddamn bed. There would be no point.
Her eyes were pale and unnervingly intense. That was his first impression of the girl they said was his sister. He glanced at his parents where they stood awkwardly, hands clutching the other’s arms as if to keep themselves from convening on the girl. His mum’s eyes were green- a deep bottle green, not like the icy green of this girl in front of them and she didn’t much look like the woman either. She was tan for one thing but not the healthy golden he and his dad sported; she was dusky colored which only served to make her eyes more noticeable. That mess of black hair didn’t help in that regard. It looked even more disheveled than his had ever been and was cut rather short with just enough of bangs to dip into her eyes. Again, only serving to bring attention to them. Besides that, she was small. Actually, that didn’t do justice to it. She was dainty sized small but scrappy looking. Looked like she could pounce on someone and take them down, small size or no.
Edsel and his wife shared a glance. “Has there been any, er, noticeable effects?” Pearl asked hesitantly.
“I’d rather think you belong to me, Tom. Are you so attached to me that you’d rather kill me then let me go?”
“She might eat enough for a legion but she’s always been tiny. Mayhap she might be trying to build up a bit?” that curly pale haired Malfoy boy speculated and at this he saw Evans look up at him, pausing in her meal.
She woke slowly, blearily looking about. Lucius glanced at her from where he sat on the ground beside her. They’d made their way all the way to the trees and had been lounging in the afternoon sun before she had apparently fallen asleep. She wiped a line of drool as she pushed herself up then set to rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. He closed his book, setting it down to turn to her properly.
“Hullo,” she spoke softly, looking around at them with her head cocked to the side. “Why is Gryffindor red?” she asked suddenly.
“Another thing of note! The Pantherine class, more known as the big cats, have a peculiar shape to their jaws that allows them to roar so despite the myths, not all wild cat Felids can roar. That being said, the snow leopard while being classed in the Pantherine class cannot roar.”
“Just a bit of a scuffle.” she said and he narrowed his eyes, his wand quickly putting the three boys into unconsciousness if they weren’t already.
“If not for some of his grades, one might think ol’ Jasp here was a ‘claw.” Finnegan grinned. He rolled his eyes and pushed her plate closer to her. She eyed it curiously before obediently beginning to eat. Pleased with her compliance, he turned his attention into doing his own plate. Mostly of meats.
He was distracting himself. He knew he was doing it but he was going to stress about it either way and if he isn’t careful he’ll start gnawing on his lip.
There was a lovely woman and very clearly of good English descent when he had come to see Cornelius. This being said, she also resembled another family in facial features. While she had the high cheekbones and admittedly delicate arch of the brow alongside absolutely pitch black hair color that he knew to be common features in the Black family, she had another family’s signature features. The Potter jawline, Potter lips and crooked smile both and even neatly tamed in a loose bun at the back of her head it was clear her hair was an unruly mess. And of course, more south Asian features common in the past two decades present from the Potters habit of adding in more culturally diverse marriages every few generations. Her eyes were another matter altogether; both the somewhat cat-like tilt and the pale green coloring. These were what Lucius Malfoy first and foremost recognized upon seeing the woman.
“Ah,” Jasper grinned, “If you want, when I have a free block I can take you around too. After lunch I’ll be free.” he offered.
moved, only teaches outdated, faulty information on the Goblin Wars! Those who can’t afford tutors or are too busy with their other classes and studies will fail! Not that it matters since quite a good lot of those children go on to become Ministry workers! The pitiful career choices are a part of the limited scope that creates an equally pitiful education! There’s no push from indoctrinated witches and wizards to progress! They’ve turned magic into a stagnant state of being! Where is the diversity?! Certainly it must be hiding somewhere, but certainly not at Hogwarts let me tell you! Traditional is one thing, forcing students to narrow all their studies on magic and absolutely nothing else makes for a poor education! And even worse, not a diverse set of magic! Oh sure, the core subjects like Transfiguration, Potions, Charms…But the D.A.D.A. has been so wildly unpredictable that the students don’t even get a stable education in that!
knowledge to rummage through someone else’s head decides to take a peek in! There are rules and laws against such things but
. Just like he was at the orphanage. He’d looked everywhere for his father’s name; he couldn’t be a nasty mudblood, not when he was so obviously gifted. But there was nothing of him and it was apparently his weak
“Houses,” he corrected absently as he fixed her a plate- she wasn’t making one up herself. “Gryffindor is fire, Hufflepuff is earth, Ravenclaw is air and Slytherin is water.”
“Because foreign magic is covering a curse-scar.” he offered absently, still looking around worriedly. His baby cousins would be staying. For an entire week. In this mostly muggle area. Regardless that he and his wife have a bit of land, either Beryl or Etta were all too happy to barge onto their property to invite them to a cuppa or for a chat, or for one of them to unload excess goods onto them. Maureen to a lesser extent. When he tried to beg off, grandfather gave him a stern stare over the floo call and he crumpled. With his twin uncles attending a few hearings and their mothers wandering off to some expensive resort while their respective husbands were gone, his cousins would normally go to Edsel’s father’s or grandfather’s. Unfortunately, his father was in St. Mungo’s and grandfather was busy out of the country.
“Then why not have something about the charity on display or something to remember it by? As it stands, I’m not even going to remember it was for a charity. If someone asks all I’ll be able to say is ‘well the band was good and the wine was alright I suppose’.”
And frankly it looked like she’d already sized up everyone in the room and dismissed them which was worrying. He wondered where she had been all these years. They were already fourteen after all. In fact, if the goblet hadn’t spit out her name they might not have found her at
Hermione sighed and finally turned off the wizarding wireless. It would only be popular songs and infomercials from then on. She had only really been listening with half an ear, working on a few more projects and essays for the year; it was only the first week out of school so far but better to get it all done as soon as possible while lessons were still fairly fresh in her head. She might just read up on those Felidae later though, they sounded rather interesting. From his spot napping Crookshanks stretched adorably, his paws flexing and as she usually was affected, Hermione melted a little at how cute he was. Alright, she might also be a bit of a cat person and the Felidae were
Simply atrocious! Polyjuice is not something that the Ministry has wards or spells against, the use of mind controlling magics don’t have alarms or alerts to easily identify and certainly almost none of the security staff or front desk employees, after a quick verbal test, know how to identify if someone is under an influence.
“And about that, what kind of lady would desecrate herself throwing herself into a men’s game like that?” Desdemona Rosier went on. “I mean, those horrible Gryffindors have girls on their team and they’re nothing but uncultured slags!”
with the killing curse outside of that strange rebound that happened that destroyed Voldemort’s body that Halloween. And Dumbledore knew that he would target her, regardless of the other ways he might have chosen to kill her, he would undoubtedly use the killing curse again.
She herself was dressed in one of her prettier dresses- purple and dainty and she tugged her trunk along on a cart behind her, Hesperia's cage set atop it as she moved through the bustle of people. Her wild mane of thick black hair was separated into two low bushy pigtails as usual and her bright red earrings were the same color as the train she was delighted to notice. Seeing as she didn't actually know anyone, she made her way right onto the train and immediately found an empty compartment near the middle of the train but closer to the end. Getting her trunk up and stowed away after pulling her carry bag from it and letting Hesperia out of her cage (she perched by the open window, glaring out at the sea of people) she cracked open one of her books.
Wild he thought to himself suddenly and he nodded internally. That was a good way to put it. She felt, and looked, wild.
“There are still bills to pay and food to buy. How much do you think these things would cost in the long run, even while I’m gone for a good portion of the year Tom? And supplies for schooling?”
with it and getting eaten.” he shuddered slightly. “Why couldn’t he have wanted a dog or a cat? Maybe a rabbit, those are harmless right?”
He was not showcasing what she thought someone who kidnapped their slain master’s killer should be. Instead, she felt awkward about seeing this apparently intimate life of the runaway Lucius Malfoy. It had to have been a few weeks since then, that first time.
was alone when it’d come near her. They seemed drawn to her though so she made sure she was always alone so that no one could see her weakness. It didn’t do her very much good; she lost a good deal of her appetite and she didn’t eat in the Hall. Thankfully, she was easy to overlook and always had been a bit distant from her fellow Housemates. She was unable to shake off one particular boy though. He was called Loony by most of their Housemates but aside from his dazed demeanor, he didn’t bother her. Besides he’d found her after a Dementor got too close this year and had simply stayed with her until she woke and gave her chocolate frogs. Well, he stayed with her when she was awake and twitchy too but still. He talked about odd things sometimes but he edged her onto his father’s paper, and she
“Dragons? Do you mean…The first task?” Ron spoke up slowly and Jasper’s eyes focused a little and rested on him.
“You seem quite open about yourself, Ms. Mulberry.” Narcissa noted with glinting eyes. The woman laughed at her.
“The beginning of Sixth Year?” Nev asked, looking at her two only and best friends. Life without them for that brief period was the worst in her life. Home was a lonely place with her strict grandmother, and visiting her parents was always…Either way, though she was given plenty of thoughtful gifts and well wishes from her Housemates, her home was cold and lonely and everything just felt like it was a platitude, an obligatory thing. Having them and then being separated was something she never wanted to experience again.
At dinner and after watching the Sorting (it never got old, seeing all of the eleven year-olds who would be split into four houses), Harry felt a spike of frantic panic in her chest when she learned that Snape would be acting as DADA professor that year. She calmed down a little about Slughorn though- everyone in Slytherin knew about Slughorn and that meant she would be safe the upcoming year in Potions. She glanced over at Ron, then Nev. Ron looked as horrified as many other Gryffindors at the prospect of Snape being DADA professor. Nev was white as a sheet. Her lips pursed a little but she resolutely went back to her meal. The elves were usually kind enough to put something specific together for her but she always checked her food just in case. After dinner she slipped away unnoticed to the disused girl's bathroom and down to her sanctuary. While she waited she flitted about, checking the corpse of the Basilisk where she'd hidden it away and out of sight under some heavy preservation charms. She'd been harvesting its venom, scales and the like to sell. It was worth a heavy amount for just a few drops and
“Trust me when I say this, I’m the only one who died here.” and then she snorted. “That’d just be too hilarious wouldn’t it though? Start-up Dark Lord, killed because he passed out and cracked his head open.”
She had a few of those of course but London was different. Pleasantly so, she decided, unlike her usual differentness. She used her strangeness and her (supposedly) creepy stare to ward off the worst of his tormentors. London’s only comment on her eyes, conversely, had been cryptic and she thought he might have referenced a Beetle and the Bard story but who knows with him.
“I think it’ll be fine,” Ginny said, looking back again at the girl, pleased that she was no longer the shortest girl in the group. “You figure she always eats like that?”
“Well…I mean that we’re all stationed where we’re supposed to be. Us workers, I mean.” he pointed at the map on the wall. Each worker had a carefully charmed badge they could not remove whilst in the facility that showed up on it, and everyone was accounted for. There was no little light in Ms. Potter’s room. “So someone either had to have snuck in beforehand or…”
She could be bitter later that it was this mad bastard that took the time and the energy, even if it was just some terrible emotional trap, to tell her that it wasn’t her fault. He crooned to her, kind things and reassurances and she hated that it was him just as much that she hated that it rang around her head, validating her feelings and that she felt
“Your jealousy is showing, sister.” the Rosier boy in their year sang. “I think her small size would be useful for holding. One can sit her in their lap very comfortably I’m sure.” he said decidedly and he watched from the corner of his eye as Evans’s green eyes flicked to the boy.
At this point, a sob broke loose and she wasn’t able to stop it, or the next or the one after that. She knew this man was evil, knew he had murdered so many innocents and knew he was likely bringing this all up to manipulate her but
“Ms. Mulberry,” Lucius greeted warmly which garnered attention given that Lucius Malfoy, while charming and suave, absolutely was not
He turned her around by the shoulders and she stared. Out by their coop the wheatish girl was crouched, cooing at the lavender cockerel as he ate from her small hand, using her free hand to pet him.
“If that’s all Bourke?” she turned from him to check on a few of the vertical planters. He sighed behind her.
She wasn't sure how long she had sat reading while Hesperia shifted to start preening through her pigtails, but her door slid open. She looked up, as did Hesperia.
“What, so we’re…We’re subpar or something? Why are you so happy about that?” Ron frowned. Her friend’s green eyes glittered in the light. It was tinged green, the lights. Harry had told them before it was like the light in the Slytherin common room, which was partially under the lake.
. One of his small pale hands (not unhealthy but certainly not her olive coloring that had only grown richer in her time away and under the sun) reached up towards her face, entranced and still so sniffly and teary.
A sudden, pleasant chime like tinkle sounded and she paused, pulling a stylish mirror compact from her small clutch to open. “Mimosa Mulberry speaking.”
“Yes. That is exactly what we mean.” Edsel frowned. “There are certain circles who believe that the father did something- a blood ritual learned from his mother’s books that expelled the Dark Lord but it’s not the type of thing to be spoken about with just anyone.”
Scarlet eyes. Scarlet eyes, but perfectly styled dark brown hair and a handsome, charming face. He was older now than the shade had been, a few lines of age that even long magical lifespans couldn’t quite slow down but-
“Animals are definitely healthier, stronger and sturdier. Better meat even, I’d say. Think we’re all a bit healthier for it.”
“Did you really think I wouldn’t be keeping tabs on you?” she asked, cocking her head to the side and remaining where she was in the corner. She looked harmless there, small with wide pale eyes on a dainty face. Her petite feminine frame in a faded yellow summer dress. Absolutely harmless, like she herself were something that
“But us three, we'll be going for our first- will you be as well?” Hermione asked though her nose scrunched up a little as she noticed the dirt on his face.
“No, Castelobruxo is within the top ten and Hogwarts is…Well, the twenty-third out of twenty-eight.” she shrugged.
“Like a muggle university, yes, but who cares about that? We’re already learning far beyond this year or next year anyways, why not add these? Never know when you might need them.”
Hattie off. We’ve had Helle a handful of years now, and she’s settled quite nicely all considered.” she leaned back in her chair to once more watch her pseudo niece. “Right, now that we’ve got Helle covered…Hattie might take a while to warm up to you- not because of anything you’ve done, just that the land you just bought…It more or less belonged to the group mum. Still a little of a sore spot I imagine but I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Just don’t let your coop get to her plants and it’ll be fine.
“Are you daft? What if another girl had waltzed in? What would you do then? Kill her? Torture her? And then what would you do with me Tom, had you managed that little spell there. What would you have done after cursing me to unimaginable pain, pain that would have me screaming and convulsing? Pain that would leave aftershocks in my body for days, pain that could have driven me insane if kept under for longer than a mere fifteen seconds? Do you even know the consequences, the
“But it is accurate.” Pearl frowned. When Hattie so easily said ‘if she lets you’, she knew exactly what she was doing. The girl was very quiet and when she wasn’t attached to Hattie or one of her small circle of friends, she was impossibly hard to pin down. Whether she’s sneaking in shrubbery, up in trees, hiding amongst the rabbits or sneaking into very hard to reach places. Talking to her without one of the other women she clung to meant she hid behind their legs, watching them with those wide pale green eyes. Her face was very…Neutral. In that she wasn’t very expressive in her expressions and the saying the eyes are the window to the soul had no place in relation to her. It was almost eerie to see a young girl who is so quiet but also so seemingly removed, with such striking but empty eyes.
It wasn’t half bad, all things considered and Harry liked the way she could feel physical strength in her body. She’d always been scrawny and speedy, but now she was flexible and scrappy too. She certainly wouldn’t be going head to head with her cousin any time soon but if his string bean friend Piers tried to harass her she could break his nose or something. Well, Dudley had been pretty alright the past summer. Had apologized to her awkwardly and sort of been an ally, getting her extra bits of food and sometimes asking about her school. Not that there was much to tell. Much good anyways and she didn’t feel like remembering all the terrible things. She shook her head and scurried to the kitchens, peering at her map to make sure she was avoiding anyone. Her two only friends were waiting in the Chamber and she was fetching their food on this run. The elves seemed especially fond of her and all.
And then that muffled feeling went away and horror flooded him. He threw himself down by her crumpled body, not daring to touch her and flailing uselessly for a few quiet moments.
She shook those thoughts away and set to milking the glands of venom- she already had the fang carefully preserved and covered so the venom wouldn’t hurt her again. The fang that broke off in her arm, she-
“Yes…Well…” Petunia stammered. Dudley threw himself forward but still managed to be very delicate when he hugged her with a red face and watery eyes.
“Really? Why don’t we talk about it at the common room?” he asked and she stared at him and he was given the distinct impression that as always, she knew it was fake. She still nodded.
“The moon. The lunar cycles shouldn’t affect you any more than other animals, but for me…Well, it should be fine.”
“We’ve tried to keep everything- pictures when they first walked, when they first spoke, their birthdays, holidays, everything.” the thin man beside her cot practically whimpered and how
Andromeda Tonks stared at the paper somewhat incredulously. Her cousin, Sirius Black, was on the front page- and even more, claimed innocent! She tapped her nails against the table in agitation as she read; not giving any sort of trial had been a hushed Ministry practice immediately after the war was ended but most of those it happened to were either die-hard followers or particularly active sympathizers who readily admitted to their guilt. The increasingly wild story The Prophet spun made her stomach churn and she wondered how much of it was true. Quickly after shaking that thought, she quickly moved to the fireplace; Sirius, despite what an utter brat he’d always been, had been her favorite cousin if only for the fact that most of their shared family seemed to loathe him and how he was perfectly happy to turn his back to them.
"Of course people are hungry for a good snack," said Pansy, shoving Draco's shoulder playfully. "It's just that you haven't meet the right one yet. Not everyone likes their snacks to be males. Take me for example."
Hermione sighed, pinching her nose. This was the last conversation she had in mind when Harry said he needed to talk to her, especially considering she didn't really know what to do. He was her best friend, and he deserved to be loved by someone. But yet, he'd fallen head-over-heels for Ginny, which resulted with him distrusting people. Sure, it was only one relationship, but the damage was there. She stepped all over him, absolutely crushing him. Harry already had self-esteem issues, and the whole relationship between Harry and Ginny only brought out more issues than what it was worth- more self-esteem issues, more anxiety, self-doubt, lack of faith in people, and a phobia of trusting people.
"Perhaps the best way to get to her is to get her girlfriend in trouble," suggested Draco reasonably.
"But don't you want to raise them individually and love them dearly? Hold their hand as they walk for the first time and hear their first words?" Draco looked at Pansy with wide eyes.
Again, Malfoy rolled his eyes, a gesture he seemed to favour at least once per minute. He stalked over to Harry and handed him the hair tie.
“If you’d seriously expected that old bat to show up here to paint your wall, you’re more of a dimwit than I already knew you were.”
“It must’ve been you, I don’t even know fancy charms like these”, Harry smiled as he investigated one of the popcorn roses.
“It's starting, you might want to look at the game instead of gawking at me”, the blonde mumbled between pursed lips.
“You look like a dog coming out of the rain when you do that.” The amused glint in the blonde’s eyes made clear it wasn’t an insult. He climbed down from the ladder and put his tools down before he started to dig in his pocket.
Malfoy was surveying him, looking down on him. Literally, he was standing a metre or so higher thanks to the stepladder.
Laughing, Harry pressed a kiss onto the collarbone he’d attacked earlier. They were cuddling on the sofa, admiring the finished artwork. Draco’s hands had wandered underneath Harry’s sweater, stealing warmth. In turn Harry had buried his head into the crook of Draco’s neck, nuzzling at him and basking in the scent of his expensive perfume. “I’m glad you added yourself after all”, he sighed.
“Thank you. Give Parvati a hug from me. Remember to use sunscreen and-” Malfoy stalked into the room, Kreacher had probably opened the door for him. “Love you lots, bye!”, Harry hurriedly slammed down the receiver and rolled down from the bed, pulling his wrinkly shirt down.
“What kind of scene should I depict? Do you want a real family tree image, or some kind of story scene?”
With impressive speed he gulped down his still piping-hot tea and grabbed another biscuit before bolting out of the door. Harry and Draco listened to his thundering footsteps on the stairs, and then the sound of the door opening and closing.
“Huh, what did he say?”, he rolled over onto his stomach. Hermione was one of the only friends he still called with a muggle phone instead of using the Floo system, but he quite enjoyed the feel of the receiver and the charm of an occasional hum on the telephone line.
The exact opposite of Harry’s new free mindset was Malfoy’s closed-off one. Once, Harry had made a joke about giving Draco a suppository for his emotional constipation, which had earned him an angry look and scoff. But Harry persevered.
At the very end Harry had managed to persuade the painter to add a little version of himself as well, resulting in a painted, usually grumpy little Malfoy leaning against one of the trees, reading a book. Mini-mural-Harry loved doing cartwheels around him.
As the days turned into a week, everybody at Grimmauld Place seemed quite content with the current arrangement. Harry had someone to talk to. Kreacher had an excuse to try out every biscuit recipe he knew, and Malfoy… well he was getting paid. Harry shrugged. The blonde hadn’t shown the same stiff uneasiness from that first day anymore, so he assumed Malfoy had started feeling a bit more comfortable.
Thus started the courting of Malfoy and Potter. The most unlikely duo to get together after Hogwarts, yet fate proved otherwise. The painting was finished, but that didn’t stop Harry from inviting Draco over. At first, he needed excuses to lure the wizard to Grimmauld Place;
Harry grinned. That stupid grin that he knew Malfoy wouldn’t be able to resist. And it worked, he got a small tight-lipped smile in return.
“You’re being very straight-forward today. ‘Saucy’. ‘Ass’. Never thought I’d hear that from you”, Harry grinned.
When they parted, Harry hiccuped and started laughing. Draco furrowed his brow and blushed. The popcorn left in the bucket had been transfigured into little pink roses, some of them unfinished with popcorn petals instead of flower ones. One of the wizards had used magic accidentally, as if they were 12 again and unable to control their emotions.
“Of course I can”, Malfoy flicked his chin upwards. “I made the new mural in the Great Hall, depicting the Battle of Hogwarts.”
“It turned out that I had a talent, and I really enjoyed painting. It’s something you can focus on with your hands without having to think about anything else except for the very next step in your process. I liked that-”, Malfoy was taking out a pencil to continue sketching over the primer, “-and I’ve liked painting and dyeing stuff since I was young. I always helped mother paint her bangs white.”
Draco laughed, turned back to the now eggshell-plastered wall and started drawing intricate shapes and profiles Harry couldn’t distinguish just yet. The ideas Malfoy held for this wall were still a secret to the owner of Grimmauld Place.
Draco nodded and licked a crumb away from his thumb. “Well… Let’s see.”, he pondered as he put down his tea and started unpacking his materials. Brushes, paints, mixing sticks and more. “After the Fiendfyre and the Battle, Goyle was having some trouble processing all of it and his mother sent him to a therapy painting class, I accompanied him.”
Draco Potter smiled softly at Harry's antics, clearly pleased. Draco loved him, with all of his nerdy theories about Doctor Who- "he's in love with him you know. Also, I think he's going to die in the next episode." Some were way more complex, to the point Draco zoned out, staring at the beautiful man that he was lucky to call his. He was so kind, and that was one of the few things that Draco loved about him. Harry treated Draco like he was a celebrity, and while Draco pretended not to enjoy it, he surely did. "Thank you Harbear."
"Y'know, calling Ginny and congratulating her on her engagement, making sure that our kitten Snowball didn't break anything, and stop by the store. And possibly, if you're willing, you." Harry's arm snaked around Draco's waist, pulling him closer. "Come along dear, I called a limo."
"Yup. Great job," said Pansy flatly. She could have cared less, and her face showed such. She continued to finger a lock of her hair, trying her hardest not to frown. "But, you need to get those pesky Gryffindor runts in trouble. Big deal, you caught a Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw making out! We need to get that pesky Lavender girl, she called me a bitch earlier this week. And I don't know why!"
Draco wouldn't consider the stories he told Harry as lies, but rather what happened in his mind, where everything was perfect. "Of course I went to Pansy's house. We shared a bottle of wine, talked about our days at Hogwarts Academy, had a splendid dinner over another bottle of wine, and sat on her patio. And then, I left."
"You too Malfoy. I can't stay for too long, but I thought I'd tell you before I left. I can't have what happened in the restaurant happen again. Once was bad enough," proclaimed Harry.
Draco lazily fingered her skirt, toying with the short emerald green fabric. Out of pure boredom, she stood up and grabbed her suitcase off of the luggage rack. She searched her bag until she found her mirror, which she immediately grabbed before sipping her bag.
"No, this isn't right," said Harry breathlessly. He couldn't- didn't want- to believe this was possible. Everything felt so off, this simply wasn't possible. He must have been dreaming, because this wasn't possible. It wasn't, right?
Outside, the streets were filled with cabs and other cars speeding by. Sidewalks were filled with pedestrians walking about, headed to and from different compartment stores. Above head, the sky filled with dark clouds, so dark that they almost looked more black than grey, that promised to downpour on London later in the day. Billboards were filled with bright words and colorful photos, each carefully modified to attract certain types of buyers.
It was almost like a Romeo and Juliet situation, but it was so much more complicated. At least Juliet knew Romeo existed.
And that's okay. I have plenty of time to figure this all out- who I am, what my sexuality is (I have my theories, but I want to be sure), and all that jazz. Besides, I've heard that Harriet and Ginny are no longer together, as Ginny's dating Luna apparently, so I have a small chance of possibly being a compatible partner for Harriet.
"He gave me a detention because he caught me kissing Luna in the hallway! The overgrown dungeon bat needs to get a damn social life or a romantic partner," said Ginny irritably. "Do you know if they have a column in the newspaper to advertise single people?"
"And you're a horny bastard," murmured Draco loudly enough that Blaise heard her. Draco took a seat on the pure white couch, sighing as she did such.
Draco Malfoy wasn't the exception. He no longer lived with his parents, who had thrown grand parties at least once a month, but he still loved the party life. He'd become addicted to that life, to the life of partying. He couldn't get enough of the partying. He just couldn't stop.
It turned that Harry's flaw was loving Draco. And for that, Harry's downfall was born. But so wasn't Draco's downfall.
"See, we both have valid point," said Blaise, nudging Draco's side playfully. "And I know you haven't got laid since your breakup with Pansy. I got a little something so you could have a bit of fun." Blaise winked at her.
"He does seemed like the type to be a serial killer. Perhaps I should include that too! He also could be a serial killer and or has a serial killer kink. Thanks Harry!" Ginny smiled and stood up. "Maybe Luna will publish it in the Quibbler. Well, her father, but whatever."
This wasn't possible, it just didn't make sense. Draco would never do any of this, he just would. Why would he? He had no family that would support him, and even if he did, he'd never go back to them after the stuff they did.
But Voldemort knew Harry didn't love Ron Weasley in a romantic way. That would not stop Harry from sacrificing himself for the said redhead, but Lord Voldemort decided early on that it would be much easier to get Harry to sacrifice himself for his romantic partner. There was always a chance that Ron could get a romantic partner that was willing to sacrifice themselves for him.
Draco thought long and hard for a few seconds. Lucy wasn't such a terrible fiend, maybe the other dogs wouldn't be either. There wasn't hair all over the place, despite what Draco had originally believed there was going to be- he was glad for that, he didn't want to get dog hair on his rather expensive clothes. And seeing Harry smile brightly while talking about the little beasts made the idea of living with the little monsters tolerable.
Draco, meanwhile, continued to daydream of a life where it was his choice if and when he got married. In these daydreams, his father was supportive of the fact that Draco didn't want to get married, and Narcissa continued to teach him about gardening. Reality was a slap in the face, considering that his parents wouldn't support their son remaining single, much less a gardening habit.
"We're dating now Father," said Draco Malfoy. He looked rather pissy, as if he'd rather be anywhere but where he was. His voice was strained, as if every word that tumbled out pained him greatly.
And then, they get tossed aside like trash from a fast moving vehicle on the interstate. Once they gain a visible stretch mark or some other sort of visible flaw, they're immediately discarded, replaced by a younger, new person. If they don't fade away from the attention of the media, they're fat-shamed, with the most cruel and vile nicknames to accompany that. So many negative articles come out that one feels as though they shouldn't pay any attention to the old model, but rather to the heavily breasted new girl who has the most beautiful smile or the even more muscled man with better hair. In a couple months, the new model will begin to fade, their beauty tainted in some way.
"Hmm... a root beer with a Scrandy's Special Salad," said Harry, not bothering to look up from his menu. The glossy pages, filled with bright pictures of food that never came out that way and unique fonts meant to catch the eye, was a good place for Harry to stare as to avoid dealing with a waitress that would likely hit on him upon seeing his face. "Thanks."
"No problem," said Cho, her voice holding a tone of disappointment. She was a simple waitress lady, in a restaurant in the middle of the mall. It figured that the one relatively attractive man that came to the place sorted her into the boring category before she even got to make an actual impression. Chances were that he was a psychopath anyways, considering the fact that he was eating alone- it was strange, no thirty year old in this town partook in dinner alone.
Hiya everyone. This is the author (wow, that feels weird to say) of this odd assortment of one-shots based on cool, pretty words I found. I just wanted to thank everyone for reading this, especially those of you who voted and commented. I hope you all enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing this.
Voldemort didn't trust the Parkinson spawn not to screw up. She was much too arrogant and self-centered for someone like Harry Potter to love. The man doubted that Harry wanted to hear gossip about his other best friends- Hermione, Neville, Luna, and Ginny- that was truly hateful. He also doubted that Potter wanted to hear about skirts, makeup, the latest fashion trends, who was marrying who, and the other things that Pansy was obsessed with. It wasn't that Pansy was particularly terrible, but she would be terrible for Harry.
Huge mansions, owned by rich businessmen and political figures, were home to some of the largest parties. No one knew of the scandalous parties, the ones where the underage kids drank until they collapsed. No party guest could remember the name of the person they had shared an intimate night with, nor could they remember the amount of drinks they had. And in the end, they did it again.
In a similar sense, everyone is flawed. People just seem to be unable to help it, unable to find a way to not be flawed. There are liars, of course, that look you in the eyes and say, without wavering, that they are flawless. This is untrue, of course. Some flaws are more drastic than others, but that doesn't necessarily make a person evil or unworthy of gentle, soft hugs filled with love. No persons' flaws are exactly the same- they can be very similar, but not exactly the same. And people usually have multiple flaws, flaws that they don't even realize that they have.
"I suggest that you pick up your... toy." Harry chuckled. "After all, we wouldn't want people to get the wrong idea about what you do with that."
Although he was physically attractive, he had a rather attractive personality as well. When Draco had first met him, he thought Harry an ordinary businessman that only cared about money, his girlfriend, and sex. On the contrary, he seemed to care more about his relationships with others than anything else, even more so than his paycheck. It'd been Harry's quiet, serene characteristics that had first lured Draco in. And Draco couldn't get out of his mind that Harry was everything he desired in a partner. Draco was nearly positive that Harry was his soulmate, and he wouldn't be sure unless he answered the beautiful man.
The feelings was so powerful that it swept Harry off his feet. It caused the Savior of the Wizarding World to question what he thought was love, to question the treatment of the muggles that raised him. The feeling was so powerful, so deeply amazing that it seemed to rewrite his soul.
"Potter, are you crying?" The voice that asked the question was very nasally and bitter sounding, as though the person who was asking had a terrible cold and was rather pissy about that fact. Unfortunately for Harry, it was just the perfect little prefect, Draco Malfoy, who looked way too smug to be ill.
"Fine," said Blaise, opening her penthouse door and pulling it closed behind him. He lived just across the hall from her, so he'd probably be back over tomorrow, knowing that horny man. He dropped by at the most random, inconvenient times ever, although Draco guess it was a part of knowing each other for since they were learning to talk.
"Mmm, I'm not surprised," said Harry nonchalantly. "I tend to do that to people. Perhaps I should work on my people skills."
Eating alone was almost like wearing a shiny badge that said, 'I'm the psychopath that murdered both of your parents'. It simply wasn't normal, at least not in the tiny town where everyone knew each other's darkest secrets. It was frowned upon, simply because it was abnormal.
"I want to get rid of him!" Ginny exclaimed. "I hate him. He's such a boring troll, I can't even stand him!"
Every dull moment of the boy's life was filled with daydreams, filled with things that couldn't never- should never- happen. While his father tried to teach him the importance of lordships and his duty as a future lord, he just daydreamed of a world where he could simply run freely through sunflower fields and smell the flowers. He even daydreamed that his father would take him into a muggle town and let him pick cherries, something he'd heard Blaise talk about when their parents were having balls and the children were forced to attend. Simple things like that filled Draco with a sense of longing, longing that he never got to participate in such mundane activities.
"Oh honey," crooned Ginny sweetly, "I can't believe you. You really thought that Harry would be into you? Why would he downgrade from me to you?"
Draco didn't know what to expect, nor was he sure that he wanted to know. The flat was likely overrun by dogs, considering that Harry was the sort of person that would say "no, bad dog". And the worse part was the inevitable amount of dog fur, which was likely to cover all of the surfaces. It was be gross and disgusting, to the point that Draco would have to leave and breakup with the man- he wasn't dealing with all of the fur.
Filipino Noun- a man who is desperately in love with a woman, but cannot admit his feelings or approach her.
"Y'know, maybe you should pull that stick out of your damn arse and just chill for five seconds. I'll leave you and your precious hair gel alone on your date," said Harry in a snappy.
"A gift," said Blaise in an innocent tone. Dark coffee colored eyes stared intensely at Draco, as if he'd be able to read her reaction like one reads a book. His tone was rather prideful, as if he knew that she was going to like the gift he'd gotten her.
"You're very stupid, Potter," spat the Dark Lord, pacing. His ruby red eyes glared at the boy- no, man- in front of him, wishing to murder the man instantly. But first, he wanted to see how Potter reacted to betrayal. He wanted to see the spark drain out of his bright emerald green eyes.
It just doesn't work like that. Instead, I'm stuck on an awful, piss poor train that smells like sweat and old food, headed to Hogwarts for my eighth year- that's what the high-ups are calling the redo of the previous year. The seat as scratchy as hell. And I'm all alone, although I don't exactly mind- the people were too loud. To clarify, everything stinks, and everyone absolutely sucks.
"Ugh, not everything's about you," said Pansy in a fake whiny tone. "You won't even let me have my diva moments. You're a terrible friend!"
His boyfriend, Harry, disapproved of partying in general. He simply disagreed with the whole notions of parties altogether. It was also worth mentioning that Harry refused to so much as drink the tiniest bit of alcohol- he just found no purpose in drinking any. Harry said that partying was just a bad coping mechanism that only led to worse things.
It confused the hell out of her. She just didn't know who she really was, what she was supposed to do with herself, or even how she was supposed to feel. It almost felt that the girl- no, young woman- in the mirror wasn't her but a different woman entirely.
He loved the partying, the way the alcohol burned the back of his throat. He loved waking up in another person's bed, regardless of whether it was that of a male or female- he never remembered waking up in the bed of someone who identified as neither. He loved the loud thrum of the music played by the DJ, given that he was sober- loud noises hurt when he was hungover. He was simply addicted to the party life.
And Lord Voldemort knew it, if only because Lucius Malfoy constantly ran his mouth about how unnaturally close Harry and Ron were. The man didn't know what love felt like, nor did he want to, but he did understand the theory of love. He understood the basics of loving another person- the willingness to die for love, the unwavering loyalty, the passionate kisses shared in the rain, and the constant confessions of love.
“You are clearly not…Able to care for them.” his father said briskly and Draco couldn’t find it in him to be upset. It was always supposed to be Rosie and he as a team,
“Just…Telling you about it and, maybe…Teaching the little miss a bit about the wizarding world? She’ll be getting a letter to a magical school come her eleventh summer and it’s better to have half a foot in, so to speak.”
who’d been magic. He had briefly despaired and decided that instead of that filthy muggle name, he would be Lord Voldemort.
“Yes. You know I had thought about getting my girl one but she tends to be…Well it wouldn’t work out I think. She needs something more…Interactive but something small enough that she could sneak around. I was actually thinking of getting her a lemur when she’s a bit older and more prepared to handle taking care of a small living thing.”
“Jasper?” she asked, standing and for a few moments, he just stared at her, trying to regain his breath.
“They want Helaine’s land. They’re gonna tear down her building-” something pinched hard in her chest, “To build up their own home.” they stood silent for a while and Hattie hated how heavy it felt.
There was no way she’d be able to tell them she could die in this ritual. Or the horrible pain she’ll go through during it. She was already weak from the Veil’s pull and her chances, while not horrible were still…
“It’s an amphisbaena. The man was an adventurer from the seventeenth century.” she said. Her voice had a pleasant rasp to it and he eyed her curiously as she examined the entry it had shown.
“…How do you know about that?” he spat, low and dark, keeping his eyes on her. He’d not had to watch her as though she were a danger before and it rankled something in him to acknowledge that she might pose a threat.
“When sunbathing, it’s best to go bare. Oh! I said that aloud.” she smiled sheepishly. Well Narcissa had her answer then. “You’ll have to pardon me, I’ve just come from another function and I’m afraid I may have had a few glasses.”
word about them is that they are mostly solitary creatures as most feline species are though they can form clowders just the same as Felids of both the mundane and mystic variety. But they are far more vicious than their all feline counterparts. Much like werewolves, they transform during certain times of the lunar cycle, though not on the full moon. As cats are natural predators, they are considered more dangerous than wolves and the like, and have augmented from their states of being. There is no wolf bane equivalent for them at the moment. Though reportedly, a large enough amount of nepeta cataria, more commonly known as catmint or catnip, can lull them into calmer, more relaxed states. If not that, silver vine, valerian root or taterian honeysuckle wood should work.
“When do they stop giving food?” she asked and he snorted. Jasper glanced at the involuntary noise, shooting him a dimpled grin before his attention was once more wholly focused on the girl.
“Ma’am, I’ve been to the Dueling Competitions around here, and I’ve already had such people try to attack me before. I most certainly am not afraid of a few bumbling thugs who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty. Because I don’t mind getting a little dirty myself when occasion calls. And I will not be holding back. They will either be apprehended for assaulting a Confederation Ambassador or I will either kill them or send them to insanity or coma.
“Christmas or Yule, whichever is preferred.” she shrugged. Tom recalled reading about Yule. Now it wasn’t as much of a big deal and in most capacities it was the same as muggle Christmas, mostly presents and an excuse for gluttony and merrymaking. Most Purebloods he’d learned didn’t take to any religious or spiritual beliefs because muggles follow them. Religion he could understand but the traditions of their ancestors he was still confused about. He didn’t question it, lest he seem ignorant to his dormmates who had finally begun to accept his presence. He would ease them into complacency and then, when they were docile, he could begin. He turned his gaze to his partner more or less. She hadn’t strayed from him yet and had allowed him into her current home so he felt confident for now that she was within his power. Or at the very least, not inclined to part. She was also apparently planning to give him a present so that meant she was attached right?
Draco cleared his throat, his Adam's Apple bobbing. His gaze wandered over to where Harry was holding his hand before returning to his father's face. "No Father, I'm not joking."
"Get away from me," spat Draco. "I want nothing to do with any of that. I refuse to be part of that. If you want to participate in the high Pureblood values and morals, I suggest you go to the school in Asia! They are the only remaining school where people would agree! I'm sure all the guys would be drooling over you."
"Uhm... I'm very busy." Harry continued going about organizing the files, ignoring the paper cut that he just received. His tan cheeks were filled with a rosy color, making him look so much more ethereal. With beautiful emerald green eyes,  the ebony black hair, almost as dark as the night sky, was all he needed to make himself even more attractive. With dark, long eyelashes that nearly touched his cheek, he was what many individuals that desired men would want. In a white dress shirt that was fairly tight fitting, with a pair of black trousers that hugged his body properly, it was a wonder how Harry continued to remain single.
He knew her parents had been very strict about Pureblood ethnics, but this was a bit too much. Her statement was absolutely terrifying, and Draco pitied any of her future children. And her husband. With how emotionally distant she was, all of them would live a miserable life.
He hurried along, before flooing to his parents' manor. He held Esmeralda, while Harry flooed to his parents with Rosetta- he was only allowed to after he mastered the Floo network.
Draco flushed, before growling at Harry. "Tell anyone about it Potter, and you'll never get to call me your husband."
Smiling is considered a sign of joy and happiness by many people. A smile is a sign that one is in a good mood or that something really amazing has happened to a person. A smile could also be friendly or welcoming, like one would give a person they've never met before. Smiling people are seemingly deemed as much prettier than those that don't smile— it seemed society had a thing for smiling people.
"Very good," said Narcissa Malfoy, the dance teacher- she was also Draco's mother. Underneath of her expensive dress, which was silver in color, was a corset- she was a noblewoman after all. Her face was extremely beautiful, the thin bit of makeup that coated her face helping to hide the fact that she was slowly starting to age. Her snowy blonde hair was pulled into a neat bun, making her look even more noble. Her  lips, coated in a raspberry red color, were pressed in a thin line. "Run along, Miss Potter."
Magazines issued from sex industries are no different. They glamour up their workers, putting them in overly sexualized outfits and lingerie. Those workers are ordered to pose in a variety of sexual poses, all to keep the industry's fan base now. The props used are too glamours, too ridiculous, but it's all for the same exact reason- to feed the sexual desire and want of their customers. Some industries even made videos or allowed the rich customers to have intimate cessions with their most fresh, pinned after individuals.
Draco was strongly ignoring his urges to run over to her and confess the fact that he was simply in love with her. Nevertheless, he simply couldn't do such a thing, something so... ridiculous. Something so mundane would earn him heaps of trouble, especially when considering Potter's rather... questionable reputation. Rumors, though most were simply the work of dramatic people, were enough to earn one the hatred of Lucius Malfoy.
His left arm was filled with different tattoos. The most beautiful phoenix flew around on his arm, looking as free as a bird tattoo could be. There was a large black dog and a werewolf, situated next to each other, both of which could also moved slightly. Above his wrist was another tattoo, although it wasn't a picture. It was a name, written in cursive: Teddy Lupin.
Harry had never tried to hide what he thought of those who committed adultery.Harry knew that it was more than just kissing, simply because he'd been standing there long enough to have heard majority of their conversation. Harry was going to leave, for good. He thought that adulterers were the worst, considering that Harry's first ex was also a cheater. He thought that they were dirty and vile, never thinking about those that they hurt.  It stood against everything that Harry stood for.
"Don't fret darling, I'll get the door for you." Harry Potter was quick to get the door for his soulmate, ignoring the strange looks that he received. With his messy raven colored hair in a ponytail, he looked like what some would consider 'a troublesome punk'. The leather jacket and ripped black skinny jeans surely didn't help, although half of the mall shoppers were just bitchy Karens- they really didn't count.
I've heard of bisexuality, and that sounds about right. It's not like I could ask about it at a Death Eater meeting. "Oi my Lord, can we talk about my sexuality? I think I might like the Girl-Who-Lived!"
Number Two: The best way to start dating your future husband is to have your best friend proclaim your unending love for him after you get rid of someone they don't like by suggesting they attend schooling in China.
Harry had already run away from her, headed towards where he believed the Dark Lord would be. He nearly tripped on his own feet and somebody's body- this war wasn't going that superb, despite the useless encouragement that the teachers yelled.
After the war was done, he up and left. No one knew where, nor were they sure why he left. Before he did up and disappear, he broke up with Ginny Weasley. Of course, there was an uproar after he left, most fearing that he'd turn dark or that he'd been forced into leaving. And Draco, despite his seemingly careless exterior, was slightly worried about the Gryffindor.
"Just fantastic," spat Draco bitterly, before giving Pansy a smile. He could not be rude to her because his life was falling apart, that wasn't her fault. "Uhm... I'm still single."
Harry's flat was nothing like Draco imagined, which was strange considering how many scenarios Draco created. A beautiful garden, full of flowers of all color varieties,  bloomed perfectly without so much as a single spot. The red shutters, which had been freshly painted last week, matched the grey siding of the house. His shiny black car sat in the small driveway, glimmering under the slowly setting sun.
"Thanks Potty." Pansy gave Harry a pouty look, her eyes holding a hateful glare. Her lips them curled in a hateful snarl, making her face look more pug-like than usual. "Next time, I can get it for my little Blaise baby. We don't want your filthy germs on anything! Go pick up something else, like your mother's dead corpse or some ugly roses to place on the mudblood's grave."
"How are you?" Draco asked her finally. He didn't know what to ask her, considering it'd been so long since they last talked.
"Dray, I just hate those filthy Gryffindor lions. They're just so whiny and needy and bitchy. Why do we have to deal with them? Hogwarts should only allow good Purebloods, like you and I. That way, the breeding pool becomes so much less complicated." Pansy smiled at the idea. "Oh, that'd be brilliant. I could meet all of the different suitors that are interested in me! My parents would love that!
"Are you just realizing this or...?" Harry was seated across from her, a thick book on Astronomy settled on his lap.
As a child, he hadn't really experienced any form of love, not even an ounce of it. To the Dursleys, he was like flea, a parasite that would be better off dead. The detached way they spoke to him said enough, much less the way they could hit him without guilt. No demon needed to tempt them into mistreating Harry, for they thought up the idea of ruining the boy's life back when he arrived on the doorstep- or maybe the morning when Vernon went to get the milk and discovered the boy swaddled in blankets, but that's not what's important.
It was scandalous enough that Harriet Potter was raised by two men, two men who were married to each other- it didn't matter that they were in love or anything like that. Although, that simply wasn't the most scandalous part. It was believed that Harriet's father, James Potter, had a criminal record, although no one knew what he did.
"Of course. Our family is ready to collide with yours." Harry smiled at him, before walking over to the side of the bed. He kissed Draco's cheek, before turning and walking to exit the room. "Come along darling. Our family is waiting."
Draco nearly forgot how to breath. He'd imagined himself in this situation so many times in his head, he'd memorized what he was doing to do and say. He planned on professing his undying love for her, to tell her that she was more beautiful than his mother's rose bushes. Everything was going to go together perfectly, without even so much as a hitch. She'd understand and tell him that she felt the same. They'd kiss, and everything would work itself into place.
Harry only ever heard the first version of the story, of course. If Draco were to tell him what really happened, Harry would be gone in an instant. So Draco made sure to carefully conceal his party clothes and hickeys left by someone equally as drunk as Draco had been at the party, as to never let Harry know what really happened.
"Hedwig is a rescue dog. She came with her name, so I never found a reason to change it. As for Dobby, I asked my friend Ron for some names. I thought he said 'Dobby' rather than 'Bobby', and I just chose to roll with it. I was watching Doctor Who, and there was a character called Lucy Saxon. I thought about naming her River Song, but she seemed like a Lucy." Harry smiled amusedly up at Draco.
"How dare you assume I've went feral?" snarled Lucius, breathing heavily. He reached out again, trying once again to scratch Harry's face.
It was then that Voldemort realized that he should look through the Death Eater's children. After all, many of them had children or grandchildren that could be a compatible love interest for Harry. And if those children knew what was good for them, they'd play along in loving Harry- even if they detested him greatly. Voldemort made a list and checked off reasons they weren't compatible or why they were.
And Draco knew it was wrong, but she pictured the woman completely naked, which wasn't exactly hard considering how little clothing she did have on. Draco imagined unclasping Harriet's bra, letting it hit the floor. She imagined Harriet's thongs hitting the floor.
His eyes, which were bright with curiosity, moved towards the sky. It was so beautiful that he also didn't know what to do. Glowing a beautiful, pure white were some of the most brightest stars in the sky. The crescent moon glowed bright in the darkness of the galaxy, almost as if beckoning Harry towards the sky. The darkness, the space between where the stars danced and glimmered, almost seemed to spark. It was overly beautiful, Harry realized.
"I did a brilliant job Pansy. I caught Lynn and Emily getting a little to comfortable in the hallway nearest the kitchen." Draco puffed out his chest, smiling at Pansy. He fluttered his long snowy eyelashes at her, his bright silver eyes glimmering with pride. He wiped off his Prefects badge proudly, despite there being no reason for him to need to do such.
"This is exactly why dad left you," said a girl that appeared to be her daughter. "And why I live with him."
"I'm sure," commented Draco calmly. He didn't know what to say after that, so he chose to remain silent.
"Hey," said Draco awkwardly, scratching the back of his neck. So that wasn't in the speech Draco's mind created.
Astronomy was something Harry was starting to find interesting. It wasn't something he'd ever pursue a career in, but he did find the Greek mythological stories about the stars beautiful. They were tragically beautiful, each story seemingly sadder than the last. The stars were so beautiful, each glowing brightly in the sky- Harry would sneak up to the Astronomy tower late at night to see them sometimes- more specifically every Friday at one in the morning.
Lucius began to laugh again, harder than he planned on laughing. "This is so ridiculous that it's funny. Not really, but it definitely is, considering that I know this is a terrible joke."
Anyways, I was talking about how special you were to me. I couldn't ever talk to anyone else about this, because they'd judge me. I really don't want to be judged any harsher than I am right now. And I fear that I'll wither and grow old, and you'll still be my only companion. Oh, that'd be terribly dreadful, even if I do hate majority of humanity. But I deserve the loneliness, if only for being a hateful bitch that sided with some terribly awful people.
"Hey Harriet, I need your help!" A lanky redhead stood next to Harriet, looking at Draco as though he were a diseased rodent. Dressed in baggy, loose fitting clothing, it was obvious he was poor. "Come along, Fred is just dying to dance with you- a pleasure some will never have."
And Draco saw the famous Harry Potter, one of the most beautiful people he'd ever seen, curled up against the sink, crying. He had his knees pulled to his chest, and his arms were pulled to around his legs, as if he were afraid of being ripped apart.
"Any last words, Boy-Who-Wouldn't- Die?" crooned Voldemort, staring at Harry with his hollow eyes. He continued with his pacing, seeming not to care that it irritated Draco greatly- that was exactly why he was doing it.
"Ugh. Snape sucks," said Ginny, throwing herself across a chair in the Gryffindor common room. Her dark red hair was neatly braided, likely with help from Lavender. Her freckled face was pale, her warm eyes filled with a bitter malice.
"Hey Draco. How'd flirting with Harry go?" Ginny's lips, which were coated in cheap scarlet lipstick, were pulled into a hateful smirk. Her eyes, a chocolate brown color, held the most smug, hateful look that Draco had ever seen. The ruby red shirt that she was wearing was simply scandalous, low enough to look like clothing Draco had seen at the strip club once- long story short, it had simply been Blaise's fault. A black skirt rose up every time she moved, which Draco didn't even notice.
"No," answered Ginny quickly, ducking a spell sent her way. Quickly, she sent back a spell of her own and heard the person on the receiving end yowling. "I haven't seen him. Sorry."
Draco found Harry most attractive when he smiled, although he wasn't ever unattractive. With the jet black hair and big emerald green eyes, he looked much like what Draco subconsciously wished for in a partner. His tan skin bore a few harsh scars, obviously from a while back, but he simply never mentioned them, pretending as if they never existed. While he was rather skinny, he had a moderate amount of muscle- not too much though, he didn't look like on of those beefed up men on the front of a magazine. He was simply attractive, utterly alluring.
From the time one is a child, one sees people on display. On the front of magazines sold nearly everywhere, one can see beautiful individuals dressed in the most luxurious clothing, posed in the most seductive poses just for the buyer. One can see heavy breasted women in tight fitting clothing, bending forward so that more of her bosom is visible. Men stand without their shirts on, posed with their muscles flexed, the most mischievous smile playing on their handsome faces. They're there to act as a simple charm, to make one convinced to buy the magazine in hopes of seeing more attractive, gorgeous people in an array of position, all of which are meant to please the audience.
Draco wasn't a flawless, stunning woman. She was the disgraceful Pureblood daughter of a Death Eater. She ruined her own reputation and the reputation of her mother, simply by running around with a Dark Mark on her arm- although, Draco wasn't responsible for that cursed tattoo being there. Draco was a flawed, cold woman that only gained respect because people feared her father and his rather large fortune- one word in his ear from his daughter was enough to ruin anyone's reputation. Draco wasn't really strong, considering that she wanted to run and snuggle with someone during a thunderstorm because she was scared.
The party life was often one of the most disapproved lifestyles. There were several reasons as to why, most of them revolving around of the idea of wasting away life, drinking way too much, having sex with people you wouldn't remember, and leading yourself down a path where just partying wasn't enough.
"I... I thought about it. Maybe I was a jerk- okay, I was. If you're still interested in me, which I'm not sure why you would be, uhm... I'd go out with you, on a date." Harry averted his eyes after he said such, almost like he was afraid of what Draco would say or do.
"I know the description I'd put," Ginny said, smiling proudly. She'd clearly been thinking about it for a while, if the smile on her lips was anything to go by.
He knew where he'd go: the girl lavatory. Why? It was simply because it was the only place that one could be truly alone- save for Myrtle.
"Yes, my dragon, I have never been more ready to go," said Harry in a gentle tone, before shooting Lucius a dark, withering look. "By the way, we might want to call the mental hospital."
Upon closer inspection, Draco realized that Harry's arms were filled with the most beautiful tattoos. The tan skin of his arms was nearly completely hidden by the sleeves of tattoos. A beautiful red lily was the first tattoo that Draco noticed, every line and fine detail implanting itself into Draco's mind. A wispy blue stag moved slightly on his arm, likely because it was a wizard's tattoo- muggles saw the same tattoo, except it wasn't moving. A bubblegum pink and sky blue butterfly was placed right above his wrist, on the veins that could determine the life or death of a person.
He then briefly pondered the fact that they might not even like him. Just because they were his parents didn't mean that they had to love him, nor did he want them to fake loving him out of some sort of parental duty. His parents might not be supportive of him being bisexual, nor his crush on a snowy-haired Slytherin. Both of his parents might not approve of Harry's personality, considering that he didn't have the best personality- not compared to the Weasley twins or Bill Weasley.
Draco gave him one of her sweetest smiles, telling him exactly where he could shove his manners. None of these things were exactly appropriate for a Pureblood, especially a female, to say, but Draco vaguely said something along the lines of, "Screw that. I'll do whatever I please." Besides, it wasn't like any man would be turned off because off her swearing, considering that no man was interested in her. It seemed that the Dark Mark was a very effective method of keeping men away, no matter how faded it got.
Harry was a very intricate, beautiful person. Harry wasn't a possession to be owned, he'd made that clear upon Lucius's comment about being Draco's consort. He was very intelligent, but at the same time, he was also incredibly stupid- for example, he knew all about the solar system, but he couldn't tell when Draco was flirting with him. At times, he could come across as rather flirty, but he only did such when in private with Draco. He was just interesting, so much more than anyone his parents had tried to set him up with.
The first time Draco ever really noticed Potter's physical form was at the end of sixth year, despite how frequently Draco was... preoccupied with other things. Draco could remember the moment perfectly, the exact minute that Potter walked into the Great Hall on a seemingly normal Saturday. For Draco, it turned into something that wasn't normal, even under the strangest circumstances that Draco daydreamed about.
"Sorry 'bout that. Wrong cabin," said a boy, closing the door with a gentle click. Draco watched the chocolate haired boy skip away, realizing that she'd once again zoned out- that shouldn't have surprised her as much as it did. She really needed to stop zoning out, considering that she couldn't afford to let her grades slip.
"The hell?" Draco looked distastefully at the ball of fur, unable to help the sneer that worked itself on his face. He shook his leg, seeing the beastly creature run to Harry instead.
Harry wanted to paint it out, so that he'd never forget. It was so beautiful, simply breathtaking, to be forgotten just because. Water paints would do alright, but he almost thought that he'd prefer acrylic paint, if only so that he had slightly more control with how the painting turned out. He thought that would be wonderfully stress relieving, as soon as he tuned out the voice that screamed out that he was doing it all wrong.
"Of course not," said Draco disgustedly. "I'm bitchaphobic, which means that I dislike bitches. Remind me to give Lavender an award later, would you? I don't hate anyone because of their sexual preference, you useless stack of parchment! I know you do, but I don't!"
Harry smirked, which was one of the first times he did such. It felt foreign on his face, instead of the usual smile that he forced on his face. "You wish darling."
Draco came by and collected the the book. He returned ten minutes later, smiling and wishing for him to come back.
"I mean, the guy dressed up extra special just in hopes of impressing you, like you did with Ginny. Interestingly, many bird species try to impress their future mate by brightening up their appearance. Anyways, it seems that he simply wanted to impress you.
Rosetta was one of the cutest children Draco had ever seen, which was rather strange, considering that he didn't like children. They'd adopted her when she was around two years old, which had only been a year ago. With big chocolate eyes and curly brown hair, she was able to pout, and she even got Lucius to give into her antics- a man of no emotions.
"Pansy," said Draco with wide eyes, "that's horrifying. I mean, really? Why would you want that? Wouldn't you want to live a little first, before you have kids and get married?"
"Pansy, shut the hell up," said Draco with a sneer. "I'm leaving. Go act like that with someone else."
"Hello," said Hermione politely. "Have either of you seen Harry? He said he was going to get a new jacket, but you know how he is."
Harry James Potter wasn't an exception to those rules, despite the fact that he was able to defy so many other rules. He had emotions and loved others, which is exactly where his flaw was born.
Harry had never realized how many strange, odd looks he received when he went to dinner alone. Perhaps maybe it was because it'd been, well, years since he'd ever been on a dinner date alone. The last time he'd went to a restaurant alone had been when Ginny went out of town for a meeting- somewhere in Brazil, she'd simply left it at that.
Ahh, she's attractive. Y'know, she's the first female I ever found attractive. My whole life was full of pretty women, but I didn't really find them... attractive. I never wanted to kiss one of them or tug down their skirt in my private quarters (or the other way around in both situations).
"Such as?" Draco looked curiously up at his husband, standing up on his tiptoes to kiss Harry's cheek- why did Harry have to be so tall?
"ENOUGH!" snapped Lucius, sneering at his son. "I'm arranging you a marriage contract with one of the Greengrass ladies."
"I think they've lost one of their patients," said Harry, wrapping his arms around Draco's waist as they left.
Draco bit back the bitter remark that was on his tongue- I'd do the same thing if you took a great fall of a building, you useless pug. The bitter, vile words were scalding his tongue, like tea, and he wanted nothing more than to repeat those hateful words to her. It took all of his self-restraint not to scream at her; his entire body itching out to push her somewhere and keep moving, almost like what serial killers did to their victims.
Voldemort studied the list long and hard. There were limited possibilities, especially considering that there were around three compatible teenagers. He wasn't surprised, considering how young Pureblood children were forced into an arranged marriage. There was also the fact that many Pureblood families married their own cousins in hopes of keeping the line pure and free of tainting, which worked out terribly considering that the children turned out to be insane or a squib.
"I... I am," said Harry in a dumbfounded voice. He didn't even care that he had just given Malfoy blackmail information, it just felt good to be a little truthful about something. Maybe he didn't know why he was crying, but that didn't matter to him.
Millicent stood next to Draco, giving him a gruff smile. "Good job Draco. Pansy's finally asked to be moved to a Wizarding boarding school in China. I can finally have my boyfriend over with her gawking at him and threatening to tell my parents."
Draco knew better than to argue, knowing what would happen if he did. Besides, he could live a fairly successful life with one of the Greengrass ladies, considering that she could be poisoned if she got too annoying. Besides, Draco couldn't really have that sort of life with Potter, considering that he was his rival and enemy. Draco could live with the happy daydream of them together though, in world that never existed. He realized that just maybe, maybe, he could have that life someday, the day his father died. Until then, it was simply a daydream that brought Draco great joy.
Draco had known that Harry loved dogs, he knew this before their first date. It was very easy to tell, considering that Harry frequently mentioned his love for dogs, it wasn't a dark, hidden secret of his. Although, Draco would feel a lot more at ease if a love for dogs was his dark secret, rather than whatever secrets he did manage to hide.
"Good job Draco. You did very good," said the Dark Lord blankly. It was rather obvious that he could have cared less, but Draco didn't seem to notice.
"Oh honey~" purred Draco, turning around in a spinning chair that Voldemort had bought for the event. "You couldn't possibly believe that I'd love you. I wouldn't ever be that desperate, and even if I was, I think I'd go without. But thank you for teaching me to be a good kisser, I'm sure the woman will be all over me."
"Hmm... you're right!" Harry gave Lucius a smile that off threw Lucius greatly. "Trying to scratch out a person's eyes or their face is one hundred percent normal. Just another reminder of how perfectly ordinary you are, Mister."
Lucius got more irritable every time Draco failed to meet a girl that interested him. It was his son's job to produce at least one heir with a Pureblood lady, which was the least he could do, considering that everything was going to Draco. He was beginning to suspect that his son loved someone else, which would explain his son's odd behavior. Lucius could only hope that it wasn't the dumb Mudblood Granger or another useless Mudblood. All Lucius needed was for Draco to marry a useless Mudblood tramp, to disgrace the Malfoy name so greatly.
Their lips collided, their arms moving to pull each other closer in a desperate attempt for more friction between the two. Their tongues continued to collide, crashing against each other like the waves. It was a frantic, desperate kiss that was filled with need and longing, perhaps for each other or a loving, romantic partner.
He had none of the supplies to do that, as he was only allowed so much money. Art supplies weren't necessary for school, and Harry was much to shy to give a list of gifts he wanted to anyone. The Dursley's never even gave him gifts, so he had to appreciate the few gifts that kind individuals that pitied he gifted him. But he'd love some nice oil paints with a some unused canvas, but he simply had none.
"Shut up halfbreed," snarled Lucius, throwing himself into the bars of his prison cell. He reached his arm out, his dirty nails nearly scratching Harry's face.
"Overgrown bat who likes to hide in the dungeon. He enjoys tormenting students that attend his class, save for the Slytherins. He's the Head if Slytherin house and a potions teacher at Hogwarts. From the state of his hair, one could infer that he takes showers once a year, if that. He likes to dress in all black and sneer at people. It's completely possible that he has a vampire kink. Preferred gender is unknown. If interested, please contact any student that isn't a Slytherin, and they'll be more than pleased to help him pack his bags. Any inquires can be sent directly to Ginny Weasley." Ginny smiled proudly.
"Yes, you filthy halfbreed creature," said Pansy in a rude tone. She continued to give him the most withering look, as if she kept looking at him like that for long enough that he'd drop on the floor.
Black wrought iron gates, spiraling high above the limo, was the first sign that they were at the Malfoys' Manor. Moments later, servants were opening the gates, smiling at the group inside the limo.
"Hullo. What can I get for you?" A fair skin woman stood at the side of Harry's table, smiling at him. Charcoal black hair was pulled into a neat bun, which helped to show off her oddly childish face. Her golden plaque read Cho, likely because her name was Cho. What else would it stand for, Cho Chow Soup? Cho, despite her childishly youthful face, looked older than Harry- it also might have helped that her eyes didn't look quite so young.
"Hello Pansy," said Draco in a rather warm tone. His lips quirked into a happy smile, which felt foreign- it'd been so long since he'd smiled. Dressed in a rather gloomy looking black suit, he looked as though he belonged at a funeral rather than a shopping mall. His snowy blond hair was neatly slicked back, although a few strands were out of place- things had greatly changed. With his naturally pale complexion and sharp facial features, he looked more similar to a corpse than he did an actual living, breathing person.
Draco sighed, realizing that he simply wasn't designed to be a part of Harry's life. That was rather apparently, considering that he had an evil ex, and he wasn't interested in Draco. Instead of showing how disappointed he was, he instead allowed his work to swallow him whole again.
"No foolish. Our parents taught us better than that. We are meant to carry on our bloodline, it's as simple as that." Pansy nodded proudly. "We should have as many kids as we can provide for."
"Oh... err, okay," said Draco. He slowly walked down to his desk and put his head in his hands. Strands of his perfectly styled snowy blond colored hair fell into his face, which he didn't bother moving. His molten silver eyes stared aimlessly around the office, seeing Pansy and Ginny walking. No longer did it matter that he dressed extra perfect for the day, with a nice green and grey tie, with a pressed new white shirt and tan trousers, for it had not worked to persuade the beauteous Harry Potter to even give him more than two minutes of his precious time.
To be rather honest, he was surprised that Harry was still into him. Draco was open with his distaste for animals, it wasn't something he tried to lie about. He simply found them messy and loud, much like he did children. Maybe it had something to do with his parents hatred for animals, but Draco just couldn't envision himself loving one of the flea bags.
Smiling has somehow become associated with innocence. And for that, humanity tricked itself greatly.
"What?" cried Draco. "I've served you loyally for all this time! I still serve you, my Lord. Please, I'm still your servant."
"Don't get an inflated ego," said Draco sweetly. "I know marrying me can do that to a bloke, but at least try to control yourself. You're simply scandalous."
The first night that he truly realized how truly beautiful the galaxy had been a Friday night. Early in the week, he'd grown extremely aggravated with both Hermione and Ron. They were lying to him, and it appeared that they had been doing such for quite some time. And that particular Friday, Ron gained enough nerve to call Harry a 'poor excuse of a friend'.
"I love you Draco. I love you so much. I always loved you, and I always will," said Harry finally. And those were, truly, Harry's last words.
"You deserve someone that loves you, regardless of who they are. I don't care if you marry a plumber, a singer, a mechanic, an actor, an office worker, a doctor, or any other sort of profession. I just want to see you be happy, to see you smile again. It's been so long since I've seen you smile.
In a matter of moments, both Draco and Harry were in the backseat of the limo. The windows, tinted incredibly dark, helped to keep out the sun's bright rays, which Draco was grateful for- he'd forgotten his sunglasses. Rich fabrics and countless hours of needlework, created the luxurious seats, which his father had handmade to please his every desire. The velvet material had but a stain, which wasn't a shock, considering that only the Malfoys were allowed to use the vehicle- exceptions included Draco Potter and the drivers that they Malfoys generously paid. Harry may have called a limo, but Lucius simply refused to have his son riding to a formal dance in a 'commoners' limo.
Harry sauntered over, as if he had but a care in the world. Dressed in a pair of black skinny jeans and a tight fitting black shirt, he looked awfully attractive- at least Draco thought so. Bright emerald green eyes seemed to twinkle brighter upon seeing Draco, as if he were the light of Harry's life. Perhaps Harry was excited to put their old rivalry to sleep and start something new. It wasn't as if Draco knew for sure, not truly.
Everyone, in some way, shape, or form, has a weak spot. For some people, it is their family, the thought of losing their entire family enough to get them to back down. For others, it was losing their identity, to not know who they really are. Some individuals' weak spots are having a powerful, dark secret revealed, which could cause their world to spiral downwards. Of course, those are just a couple of the more generic, basic weak spots. But no matter how hard you try, you'll always have an Achilles's heel.
Draco was glad that he was out of the train compartment before he could hear the new, impressive string of curse words that she managed to put together. She hadn't even been on the train for a hour yet, and somehow, Harriet Potter was already being praised.
The perfect middle class family's underage son threw a party while his parents were away, inviting over all of his underage buddies. Alcohol was passed around like a collection bucket was at church. Teenagers gave into the desires of their lust, ignoring the morals that their parents tried to instill in them. Time passed in blurs, everything overlapping. By the morning, not a soul could remember what happened the night previous. It wasn't only the middle class family's son that threw parties, any teenager could throw a party when their parents went out of town.
Draco turned, pulling himself off of Pansy. He let go out her waist, ignoring her confused looks. He'd known one day the truth would prevail, but he'd planned on making it so that the truth would be good. So that the truth didn't destroy both of them.
Pets were just something else to take care of, another bill to add to the pile, and another mouth to feed. It wasn't as though they could have a cup of tea with one at three in the morning when one felt down, they simply weren't that classy. They couldn't comfort one after a terrible nightmare, if they even noticed that one was having a nightmare in the first place- Draco wasn't sure if pets had the mental compatibility to do such human things. Pets chewed things because they were bored, whether it was one of their toys or a piece of furniture. It was simple, pets just weren't humans, and Draco rather disliked them.

“I was homeschooled.” she answered after hastily devouring everything on her plate with a ferocity that impressed Ron. Jasper barely noticed how beastly it was (used to Ron’s eating habits and all) and filled her plate again between bites of his own. “And I’ll be doing self-study while your ilk will be in classes.”
“Should we cut it again?” he mused. “What do you think?” his fingers twirled a black lock around his hand and he tugged gently. She frowned a little, reaching up to pull a piece straight to evaluate the length. Then plucked Lucius’ ribbon straight from his hair to tie hers up, though strands still escaped, unruly even if they were tamer than they’d ever been. His chuckle was deep and only slightly stifled as he pushed his hair back behind his ear. She did not often initiate touches but it always seemed to make his eyes sparkle.
be kind and he was happiest when hard at work. Which was interesting because his father was a total prick.
She supposed she couldn’t say that she was terribly surprised that it would end this way. She leaned back and stared up at the dark clouds barely distinguishable from the night sky, watching the flashes of lightning dance. He’d strung along Parkinson for years, chased after both Greengrass sisters, flirted with girls older in school. But the war had changed everyone and he’d been so solemn and serious and devoted.
“Oliver, I don’t think I need to tell you that Morven can only go at night and to please, not let him eat too many of Beryl’s rabbits. And if you could kindly advise him not to harass Pearl’s owl Ferny. Osmond…Well frankly, I doubt Remington is actually active enough to bother the chickens. Or even leave the house, honestly, so I don’t think I need to worry about him breeding with the local farm cats.”
There was nothing she could say to that, what with her voice gone. She could still scowl at him hatefully, as she always did when he brought that up. He didn’t sound arrogant when he said they wouldn’t find her, never did. Stated it like one might say that Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald; like it was an irrefutable fact. She wished for the sharp, ruthless man she’d been sure Lucius Malfoy was. It would be better than this totally calm, almost serene man. She knew he wasn’t the only one in on her heist, but he was the only one she saw, the only one to interact with her. He
“She won’t be bony either, being on the Quidditch team.” Malfoy threw in and Tom wondered if these were observations the two boys made beforehand or not. How irksome.
“Perhaps we should set up a hammock over here. You looked like a particularly content cat, napping out here.” he smiled and she hated that it made her want to smile in return. He pushed her hair behind her ear, hand lingering on her cheek. “It looks about ready to cut again. As pretty as it is long.” he added. He had been growing more comfortable in touching her like that and making comments like that. Harry didn’t mind. Lucius was the only person she’d been around in a year and a half and she had always liked physical affection, despite that she didn’t trust most with that privilege. She didn’t trust Lucius, not one bit.
“That’s right. Bluebell Evans.” she answered him before pausing at a section of wall. “This is the entrance.” she said and he stared at it for a moment before remembering the way into the Leaky Cauldron. “All we have to do is go through it.”
“Oh, Helle’s had that since Hattie adopted her. No clue how she got it, she says she can’t remember. I’ll bet it was that awful family she lived with before…It looks like a lightning flower, you know, a Lichtenberg figure, but that’s not it.” Beryl made a tsking sound as they watched the little girl gleefully but very quietly playing with the rabbits. “Right, suppose I should get all this out of the way- Hattie’s not really a talker type.” Beryl started with, “So I suppose it’s up to me as Helle’s best and favorite aunty. I’ll be blunt- we don’t know the name she was born with, or when she was born, or who she was born to. Hattie found her one day in the middle of winter huddled down in a park when she was off buying bits and pieces to upcycle for the community. Local bobbies didn’t know anything about her so Hattie decided to watch her for a few days until we found out who lost their kid. I mean, of course they’d be looking right? Well, Helle knew enough to sort of try to tell where she lived and Hattie eventually found the place but…They slammed the door in her face saying they didn’t want ‘the freak’. That’s what they called her.
The return to Hogwarts was just as bland as the first trip but now there was more to learn and this year they got to watch the first years being sorted. He watched when Evans paused in front of the carriages, staring at thin air and then waving her hand about a little in a strange way. When asked what she was doing, she looked to him and shrugged. He didn’t bother questioning her eccentricities.
Rather than being alarmed at this, she was too sleepy to really read much into his words and simply nodded.
“To come back so injured, bloodied and still clinging to the boy’s body because you couldn’t bear to leave him there, almost stolen away by Crouch Jr. when you should have been safe at last and then blamed, slandered as you tried to warn people of what you knew to be true, of Voldemort’s return. To be turned on once more by a
He was gaunt. Paler than she’d ever seen him. Thinner, more fragile. His robes looked rumpled and perhaps unwashed, his hair long and lank around his face. He almost had a beard.
her smile had a cruel gleam and it was unnerving seeing so much raw emotion being displayed from a face compared before to stone on a regular basis. He’d thought she just had a face that didn’t really convey emotion. How wrong he apparently was. “It’s all I’ve ever been. Titles don’t mean anything when there’s no one to remember them.” a dark look passed over her face.
Grumbling, then a thump as feet hit the floor, the sound of rustling as she put slippers on and grabbed a thick robe to ward off the chills she would feel once they left the common room. Quiet shuffling after he grabbed her arm to lead her urgently through the dorm, through the common room and then to the second floor.
“He’s been coming around since you arrived, sitting out here by the door.” Lucius told her, contemplating the cat in his arms. “He’s not a magical breed, even though he seems like he would be. We’ve taken to calling him Rusty.”
it splashed as hatred in the papers Skeeter wrote and how she had to attend a trial over a Dementor someone sent after her,
,” she pointed now across the way opposite. “You’ll be the ones taking over this area between us right?”
The train ride was spent in a compartment that she charmed and spelled to the teeth, only letting Ron and Nev in as they lounged together.
“We can discuss this another time. For now, I think it’s best we let the Potters get reacquainted with young Jasmine. You’ll be allowed a separate set of quarters here in the castle.” he said to the girl. She nodded easily, delicately setting her feet down as they slipped into her trainers.
She was crying now because talking about it had never really been an option. Having it laid out with his sympathetic voice, who said that it shouldn’t have been up to her and her friends…The adults around her brushed it off but Hermione was worried about things like trauma and what it must be doing to them, to all the students of Hogwarts when these terrible things happen each year. Pain of death corridor with dead unicorns to worry about, second year with petrifications abound, third year with the ‘crazed traitor’ Sirius Black haunting the school-

“Indeed, Ms. Evans.” and he could hear the old man’s smile. If there was one thing he absolutely hated about Evans, it was the way she and Dumbledore got along. “Mr. Riddle here was just asking about staying during that turbulent time.”
Who the buggering fuck has been trying to kill you?!” he was one part hysterical but two parts absolutely fucking
Love would not solve this for her. She could not forget seeing him like that, with someone else. She could not forgive it either.
That would be embarrassing. Then he cringed again because that sounded kind of insensitive. They just found a daughter that they’d thought they’d never see again and here he was thinking that their feelings were embarrassing. Honestly, he didn’t know what to really think. He didn’t know her, she was a complete stranger. He didn’t want to say he didn’t care because…Well, this was his twin and all but he didn’t really know what to feel.
“Well there’s speculation but the widely accepted tale is that little Heather Potter vanquished the Dark Lord.”
for something we have no control over. We share mistreatment from our time in Hogwarts, much as it is a beloved home, those who looked at us, saw us battered and too thin coming back and ignored. Lied to,
The press, the Ministry, none of them knew that she was suffering at all and Merlin forbid that she had Voldemort’s soul in her.
in any legal files in the Ministry because of her ‘mudblood’ halfblood husband. Which brings attention to the awful problem of ‘blasting’ or erasure of entire existences at the flick of a Head of House’s wand and while many might consider that as a ‘family’ issue, it also creates a legal issue in that the person they erased has all their files erased as well and are essentially, nonexistent on paper. Not all cases are as extreme of course, some simply are stripped the family name or taken out of family wills, but there are always zealots more than willing to completely destroy their own blood because of perceived ‘dirty blood’. I am not, thusly, associated with the Blacks of Britain.”
“Please be careful about crowding Mrs. Malfoy.” the mediwizard said smoothly and she kept her head down and eyes shut. Five people. “She was very recently in combat heavy areas and we need to do another psych check before the rest of aftercare can be decided.”
Then, as Lucius smiled and shared more little anecdotes about his son, decided that really, the marriage wasn’t that strong anyways if a little flirty behavior was enough to ruin it.
“Just those general locations.” she demurred slightly before straightening up. “But say, don't you think it's just amazing? I've been reading about some of the charms and spells and even
“No.” his father said sharply. His parents knew what he had done. Knew because he had gone to them first, hysterical when he had read that note and she left her ring. They…Had appreciated, and even grown to like his sweet Rosie. And they had thought better of him, and knew that she deserved better than him. Or at least, better than what he had done to her. His throat still clogged and his chest still wanted to cave in on itself when he thought of it.
Carefully explaining that there was a wizarding world, and that her charge was a member of it (and haltingly explaining just how famous of one) was a slow and awful experience. Almost entirely because of the stone faced look the woman gave them as she sat in her rocking chair, carving wood into figurines. He sat ramrod straight and held Pearl’s hand closely in his own as they waited for the reaction. There…Really wasn’t much to go on from this woman. Sturdy, and well under Edsel’s own impressive height of two metres, Henrietta Heath had wavy mocha hair spilling from a half done bun at the back of her head. The crow’s feet and blatant frown marks dug into her almond brown skin like a warning to others not to get on her bad side, even if they were the biggest markers to what her age actually was. Her eyes were slanted slightly, and very dark brown and unerringly focused on the two of them.
“She's just an unrefined leader is all- some polishing and perfecting and I'm sure she'll have her own mass of followers.”
to move on as a society. If that doesn’t happen in a reasonable amount of time, then that’s the end of the line. I am, quite frankly, the
“A majority of Confederation members live in specialized luxury housing units and have been taught or already knew self-reliance. For those who have children or young wards, or are frequently out of the Sectors such as myself, people like Mr. Bodhi are matched with us as needed. There is no real need for us to have House Elves. Also, Mr. Bodhi is a pishacha not a human.”
“The Ministry is also full of corrupt fools.” he waved off easily. “Who would eagerly blame someone else than admit that they aren’t in total control of the Dementors, or that they indeed
“Animal trouble eh? My girl luckily hasn’t been attacked by any but you know what she tried to bring home about a year ago? A raccoon. A wild, found-it-in-a-park
She would explain that she wouldn’t spill details, or even really say they were getting a divorce. Would tell him that she was being sent out (which is true when she would finally give in and take the new position) and maybe after a few months the strain of her absence would give him an excuse to actually divorce without ruining either of their reputations. She wouldn’t bother telling him about the child; she might not end up keeping it after all, it was early. Not like she could really keep it even if she decided not to get rid of it. If it looked anything like Draco, and it certainly would. She didn’t want to take her feelings out on an innocent babe that, in any other circumstance, she would have been overcome with joy at having. She’d always wanted a family of her own. She supposed if she really wanted it, she wouldn’t be getting it with Draco. She wasn’t sure if she would try again. Not…Not when it could turn out like this all over again.
“Another function?” Narcissa inquired politely. This Ministry happening was the only large gathering of the month, others clearing time for it.
“Well you can never stop learning,” Eddie smiled. “Say, what House did you want to be in? I think I know there are some Weasleys in Gryffindor...”
The day had started normally enough; though it was Dudley’s birthday which meant she was woken up a bit earlier for her to start cooking his birthday breakfast. While Dudley had been slightly more tolerable and more mellow since the entire…Almost-had-his-soul-sucked-out, her aunt and uncle had not. Which she supposed was understandable from their limited point of view. Their son almost died by magical creature because he had been near her after all. After she had made breakfast (and took a few pieces while she was cooking and Aunt Petunia busy organizing her precious Dudders’ presents) she was kicked out to the garden. It had been a nice enough day, so she couldn’t say she really minded. She was called back in for lunch; that is, to make lunch. Took some food for herself to hide under her baggy thrift store/Dudley’s cast-off clothes and was sent off before Dudley could get home with his friends in tow. Dudley might be better now, but his parents still weren’t and she doubted his ickle little friends were either. So she had gone to go to her room to sullenly think about how her friends had been more or less banned to write to her. And silently fume that they fucking
“Recent investigations have pinpointed several clues to his continued existence. We have not yet received clearance from your Ministry to pursue those leads.”
“I’ll walk you to class.” she told them. Neville didn’t think it was a request or even an offer. She would and there would be no denying her but he thought he was the only one to realize it. Jasper smiled and nodded, standing and patting her head a little bit. She blinked up at him curiously before getting up, their friends doing the same. Ron complained a little, even as he continued to stubbornly eat, grabbing rolls to take along the way to class. Jasmine seemed to notice and her hands struck out with alarming speed to grab a few rolls as well and she dipped one in gravy as they were heading down the table, Ron following that example.
More than willing to take advantage of Evans’s unusually talkative mood, Tom followed her in. It was not what he expected of a home (maybe being in the orphanage gave him some grand illusions) but still seemed perfectly like Evans. It was sparse and the colors were dull and seemed like continuous shades of gray. It was also rather chilly and there were long shadows cast by dim lit lights.
“Of course, Madam Mulberry. She had since attempted other variances of breakfast and high sugar, high-calorie treat items.”
They spent most of their time together and Tom was quickly becoming a class favorite with his smiles and natural good looks, politeness and academic initiative. Evans was also one of the top of classes but she wasn’t as sociable or approachable as Tom. Most of the time, she actually seemed bored or maybe even a little exasperated with the material. Tom could somewhat understand; he’d been reading ahead for quite sometime as well. People were beginning to approach him a bit more easily by the winter hols but as far as Tom knew, Evans was mostly unapproachable.
Frustration built in her, a common feeling the past few years as she silently railed. Nobody listened to her, no adults she was supposed to trust would help her when it counted, and when she went behind their backs she was scolded for putting herself in danger when they’d already proven to her that they can’t be trusted or that they just dismiss any and all of her concerns.
“I was hoping for Gryffindor.” she said as she tore her eyes from the book she was reading from. Poppy didn't mind sharing her books so long as they didn't get damaged.
“I don’t much care about all that.” she said bluntly. “You want to prep her for going out into a world that thinks she’s some sort of idol? If she lets you, have at it.” she signed off pretty easily. “Not like I can teach her whatever magic things people do in a magic school.”
Blacks you know? They’d branched out and while connections may seem thin by now, they have the common history in them. Some branches have only left within the past century or two even. Of course, here it seems that families that have branched aren’t considered ‘true’ family members of the blood and that those who had branched from foreign families no matter how far back, are looked down upon. If not them, the families they came from instead. It’s very convoluted and just a headache in all.” she gave a dubious frown. “I don’t understand how one can be upset about diversity? But well, with a people as rigidly reactionary as the ones here, I suppose it’s not all that surprising. The gene pools alone here are frankly fraught with imperfections that create things like squibs. The
“Do you like creatures then?” James asked her, eager for any scrap of information about her. She glanced at him for a moment before stepping into passageway. They were quick on her heels and Jasper went in after them, watching as the entry was covered again. There was quite a pretty painting covering what was the opening though, and the creatures in it looking at them curiously before playing about in their exotic looking backdrop.
She wasn’t sure why he was telling her all of this- she had no interest in it whatsoever outside of how she could possibly get rid of the one in
Anger flared low in her belly, rising to a fever pitch but she closed that down quickly. She would save her anger for later, when she and her friends were hidden away and practicing DADA since the pink toad was so useless. But one day...One day Ron would show them all and no one would whisper about the 'worthless Weasley'.
At some point a man came in, she supposed it was her ‘nurse’ since he was usually the one coming in and checking on her, putting potions in her and the like when that other bustle weren’t around. He sat this time after finishing his duties and then told her, “I’m going to remove these now.”
“That won’t be happening, poppet.” he said, not quite chiding. “The sliver of soul in you has long blended into your own over the years. It’s really pure chance that it held onto enough of me to form a connection at all. Which, I suppose, is why the Basilisk fang had pierced your arm,” his hand slid up to where the small starburst scar was. It was on both sides and while the Phoenix tears had healed her, it didn’t stop the near death from leaving a little reminder. “And you are still a horcrux. Basilisk venom is one of the few things that can destroy a vessel so drenched in Dark protective magics as I had put my horcruxes under to free the soul inside of it. Had I not had other horcruxes in place, it would have entirely destroyed it. Thankfully, the other pieces of my soul were enough to keep it on this plane.” his thumb pressed slightly on the scar that sat on the inside of her arm then smiled slowly. His face was handsome- and it was all a cover for what he really was, one he used to charm and trick. “And because it had grown into your soul, and still shares a connection to my own, you are also kept on this plane. I’m still not entirely sure how you had managed to survive that night. There are whispers of a ritual your father had gotten from his mother, the notorious Blood Ritualist Dorea Black, but I had been there that night. And I had scoured it afterwards. There had been no ritual. And even the absurd theory of your
“A charity.” Lucius waved off easily. Narcissa wondered if he knew anything besides that. They’d been to so many Ministry functions, their purposes tended to all blur together.
“Do you have any funds?” she asked in return. “I’d think not. The only purpose of this golem is to keep adults and bobbies away, and sign for anything I can’t.”
He was harsher with his followers. Angry at Evans, furious at her. But he didn’t know what she was capable of, and he didn’t know what kind of ‘action’ she would take if he finally got rid of some of the damnable mudbloods here. He would not risk going to Azkaban. The Knights of Walpurgis was getting larger as a group and he was getting more renown among his fellow students.
“Yeah and I heard you haven't been in bed lately. Got a boyfriend?” Ginny teased and Ron felt like she was being cornered. What did they even
“You can’t be! I- I cast the- you should be dead! I saw it hit you, you stopped breathing, your heart-!”
“A fax machine. They transfer papers fairly instantly. It was adapted from the muggle construct of the same name.” she waved off easily. Narcissa felt her face screw up, just a little bit, before she could stop it. “Ah. Right. The vicious aversion to any sort of progressive technology that,
(If they could do something more definitive about that scar though, because it was most definitely a curse-scar and it didn’t seem like it was actually treated or diagnosed as such…)
“She will be quite sensitive and weak as her body gets used to not having what amounts to a parasitic entity stealing her life energy. She will likely have fits of uncontrollable magic and will thus be kept in a discrete facility until her body adjusts.” Dumbledore spared nothing and the horrified look on her aunt and cousin’s faces and the constipated look (it might have been worry) on Vernon’s made her feel a little more like they might actually care more than they’ve even recently let on. She supposed learning these things was different than her just coming home after magic school. She wondered how they would react to everything she’d gone through while in that magical world, but that was neither here nor there. “If you should so allow it, letters may be sent to and fro if you want to keep updated. Through your post system of course, I’ve heard you’re rather sensitive about our usual avian methods.” he smiled cheerily.
When they would divorce, she would be insisting that he keep it. She wanted nothing to do with it already. Everything in there was…Was tainted now. She would take her most precious things; photo albums, excepting the smaller one that she had been growing with Draco. The reconstructed Firebolt hung up in their kitchen. Her old school trunk usually held all her other important precious things.
“I very well could, Ms. Skeeter, but I daresay a publication founded and currently at least partially owned the Ministry would instead paint me as a holier-than-thou Confederation ambassador who thought of the British Ministry and those under its authority to be uneducated simpletons rather than bothering to fill in the context and raise points about the severe faults the Ministry and Hogwarts suffer from. Should you attempt to post or publish anything of the sort outside of an expressly factual interview that must be scheduled and approved by the Confederation, and certainly not heralded by any run of the mill journalist who works under the Ministry’s payroll, you will be terminated and blacklisted from any journalistic careers. We at the Confederation do not play around with gossip and falsities and certainly not with sensationalist gossip rags.” she said shortly. “That includes ‘anonymous’ tippers.
Helle blinked, tilting her head to the side. The cat blinked back at her before yawning and stretching widely, showing off needle sharp teeth and very sharp looking claws. He was a very big cat, she noticed as he lazily dropped from the trunk he’d been resting on to the floor to lazily putter over to her, sitting and giving her an imperious stare. She graciously obliged and scratched at his ears, which he immediately responded to by nearly falling to his side and purring very loudly. Helle felt accomplished somehow.
core classes outside of magic! You know, were it to go to any other major continent, it would be shut down? It wouldn’t pass the board of education in other countries. You know they don’t know the muggle side of their own countries? Because they aren’t taught squat about it! Not the magical side either, since that ghost who has
And regardless if he wasn’t the same, there was still the matter of his Death Eaters and followers and what they did and stood for. Not to say she’ll forget that it was Voldemort who really catapulted them into what they were and how he ruined everything but still.
Mimosa was a child of whom he’d had a large part in the life she’d lived and someone he’d come to respect in her own right, as little as she thought of herself. Few times were there that he could spend time with any of the children he took into the school. Soon enough a folded paper crane fluttered over to him and he was quick to unfold it. It might seem juvenile but when the children were away, they were quite cute ways to communicate, though Severus didn’t participate and tended to set fire to them whenever anyone sent him one. As soon as he saw the confirmation he was throwing floo powder and stepping through with a bellow borne of fear.
“Dark Lords that pop up spouting genocide and racism and race superiority are also a huge part of the vicious cycle. Those who have been taught all their lives that Dark Arts are bad are only getting that image harshly reinforced by radical extremes who use Dark Arts to further their own violent causes.” she sighed. “Getting stubborn, hardheaded Ministry officials to listen to that of course gets the reaction one might expect out of a bratty child. ‘No, you’re wrong and I’m going to
“Dragons.” he said numbly. “There’s going to be dragons. She’s going to go face to face with a dragon.” he mumbled to himself continuously. His friends winced. When he’d gone out with Hagrid to the forests and come back in a quiet, stricken daze, his friends were quick to pull him aside.
“Wow Professor Hemmer, that is simply incredible. Honestly I myself had only ever heard of the Felidae in passing and I’m sure many of our listeners under the English Ministry may not have
Maybe she should get a haircut? She could decide over hols. It would be the second time besides disastrous second year that she stayed and she’d already told her parents. She shook her head and got dressed properly before grabbing the Cloak and sneaking out and away, down to first collect Nev and then over to the Chamber.
“Hm. Well this is quite…Extraordinary.” Dumbledore murmured, examining the letter she’d brought him, and then eyeing the vial of memories curiously. “I daresay I can indeed get you into schooling my dear. But are you sure that’s what you wish to do? De-aging doesn’t turn back the years of your life, only that of your appearance and it’s quite a powerful spell that you’ll be using. One that has before caused severe and dangerous depletion.” he asked the young woman. When he had first heard that he had a guest wanting to see him, he wasn’t all that surprised. Many people wanted to see Albus Dumbledore and usually they’d be politely turned away. Since such was the case yet she was still allowed in he’d opted to indeed meet the girl. She had a sort of hard face, the kind that had seen suffering and strain; it was not uncommon these days. With Gellert waging a war and manipulating muggles into it as well, many of the people he’s seen have been less comfortable, less happy, less innocent. It was only the children at the school that drove Albus forward some days. The worst of the war was in the muggle world and his heart ached every time he’d get the news that a Muggleborn or
Draco swore under his breath. Damn it, he was hot, and the flashy bastard knew it. With the swagger and smile to turn Draco into a lovesick school boy, Harry definitely knew the power he held over those attracted to males- especially Draco.
People piss me the hell off. They're loud, irritating, hateful- and worse, usually breathing. All I want is to be left alone, but they come over and bother you with stupidness. And then, they had the audacity to get all pissy when you tell them to go screw themselves. Like, if you don't want to be told off, you shouldn't bother me. People are also so damn fake that you can't tell what's real and fake with them.
The people at the party were rich, wild and unpredictable. A lady in a frilly dress leaned against the hallway outside the hallway, while a man in a shiny mask continued to rake his hands farther up his thighs. A businessman in a black suit had fallen over in the middle of the dance floor, while his wife continued to drink her champagne. A lady dressed in a beautiful tan dress continued to dance with her wife, who was dressed in a beautiful crimson cocktail dress. The politician's husband performed some rather devious things with two of the party guests in the back of his husband's limo, while his said husband ate a couple snacks and continued to search for his husband in the crowd of people. A woman and her husbands chatted in the corner of the room, judging people silently. Everyone was every different, especially in the party scene.
Harry was standing there, a tear falling down his tan face. He had the most troubled look, almost as if he'd known but didn't want to believe it. His hands were trembling, causing him to almost drop the box of chocolates he was holding. Dressed in a beautiful black suit, he looked devilishly handsome, even if he was beginning to cry.
Instead, it was expected of him to continue the Malfoy lineage once he turned of age- underage pregnancies were simply scandalous, even in the Wizarding World. Instead of picking cherries and smelling the flowers, he was instead expected to pick out a wife, or at least narrow down his options. Instead of running through flower fields, he was expected to take on the role of a stuck-up young Lord, one whom would one day have enough power to flip around the way the Ministry was run.
Some people consider skin blemishes a flaw, although it's more a physical flaw than one that leaves a mark upon the soul. Scarring, some people say, is another physical flaw- that doesn't make you good or bad, the scarring is just there, reminding you that you're not perfect. All the little imperfections that litters one's skin could be considered a flaw, but that doesn't hinder one's beauty, nor their ability to love another.
"Blaise, what the hell is that?" Draco sneered at the simple black magazine with the words 𝙷𝚊𝚛𝚛𝚒𝚎𝚝 𝙿𝚘𝚝𝚝𝚎𝚛 written on it in a bold shade of pink.
"I'd know the men that deserved the right to screw me into next week and impregnate me. We could get the preparations ready for me to become pregnant, and perhaps during the final year we could finally participate in intercourse. That way, I could have more little Purebloods to carry on my bloodline. After graduating, I could be a mother, and my husband would work. He'd come home, and we'd do it all over again! Isn't that brilliant?"
"Why do we need a limo?" Draco sighed. Harry always treated him like a celebrity, but this was a bit far, even for Harry. Although Draco shouldn't underestimate Harry, considering that Harry had went out and bought a red carpet for him once- his mother had some questions, to say the least.
"Your father's went feral," said Harry softly, looking at Draco with reassuring eyes. His eyes said something along the lines of, I'm sorry this is happening to you darling. Later, we can go home and cuddle. If you need to, you can cry in my chest while I hold you close to me and whisper comforting words in your ear.
His knuckles were unusually pale, gripping the railing ridiculously tight. He also realized that his body was trembling, his breathing was shaky at best- he was no where near being at a point one would consider 'best'. He didn't remember how exactly he'd ended up where he was standing. Was this his subconscious once again giving him the message that he shouldn't be alive?
Draco stared at the doorway, unable to help the tears that ran down his face. He ignored the lady and her husbands whispering in the corner. He ignored the ladies that stopped dancing on the dance floor, heading out for the night to never return to Draco's mansion. He even ignored Pansy, who was looking as if the angel Gabriel had come down and told her she was pregnant with the next Savior. Draco just continued to stare numbly at the door, unable to believe it.
And suddenly, once again, Draco was stunned by Harry's beauty. Lucious, pale pink lips were practically begging for Draco's kiss, which Draco would gladly do if Harry gave him permission. He gently bit his lip, which was apparently one of his nervous ticks, seemingly not noticing the fact that he was doing it. The rosy color that filled his cheeks reminded Draco of one of his mother's most beautiful porcelain dolls with a blush painted on their childish face- Harry was clearly the more beautiful of the two.
Harry opened the small, black leather bound book that Draco handed him. He scanned the receipt, cocking an eyebrow when he reads the price: £12.26. Although, he couldn't complain, considering that his taxes and drink were included. He pulled out his Hogwarts credit card, slipping it in the tab meant for checks.
But as a preteen, he met a friend who loved him deeply. He'd introduced himself Ronald Weasley, a poor redhead with too many siblings to count. Ron changed the way Harry's heart work, imprinting himself upon Harry's heart permanently. It was truly overwhelming for Harry at first, all of the sweet gestures that Ron did to show Harry how much he loved him. It was almost like their souls had been designed for each other, to become each other's best friends. It was a permanent friendship, one that would run deeper than anyone thought it would.
"Oh, I forgot to introduce you. That's Lucy. Hedwig is in the living room, she's a poodle. And then Dobby's in the living room too!" Harry smiled proudly at Lucy, picking her up and kissing her head.
Draco Malfoy looked beautiful. Dressed in a grey suit with a silver and green tie, he looked similar to how he did back at the Academy. Platinum blond hair was jelled back, not so much as a strand out of the way. The lighting only seemed to make his cheekbones more sharp than usual, which very well could have been partially due to the fact he was wearing highlighter. His normally pale face was flushed, likely because of how drunk he was- the fact that Pansy wasn't trying to hide the fact that she wanted to have sex with him truly wasn't helping. Topped off with a beautiful golden watch that Harry had bought him, Draco looked rather ravishing. Standing in the middle of the ballroom floor, he seemed to fit in perfectly.
"Oh honey," cooed Draco in a  gentle tone. "This is absolutely perfect. I couldn't wait for this day to come. I got so sick of hearing about how your family treated you, you pathetic little baby. Maybe you should go running to your mummy for protection- oh wait!"
"Of course I would darling. Will dinner tonight at The Three Broomsticks at around five o'clock work?" Draco was pleasantly surprised to see Harry's blush deepen.
"What is it?" Draco questioned in a snotty tone, cocking one of her perfectly waxed blonde eyebrows. "What the hell did you buy me?"
I think you're attractive too. If you'd like, perhaps we could go to dinner some night? I'll leave you my number.
"...is amazing." Pansy continued to babble, giving Draco a wink multiple times. Her voice was one of the most annoying sounds that Draco had ever heard, even more so than the sound of the Weasley's constant breathing. "And that Potter, never even showing up for potions. What a prude!"
Harry just smiled at her. "Don't worry. I bought one today when I found out I was coming here." Harry opened the trunk, pulling out a red carpet.
Narcissa Malfoy smiled at the moment the doors opened to reveal her son and his husband. Her hair, a snowy blonde color with dyed black roots, was perfectly curled, likely done by her hairdresser just merely a couple of hours ago. A raspberry colored dress flowed behind her when she walked, long enough to almost touch the pristine lawn.
Harry Potter was the 'Impossible Boy,' sort of. He should be dead, but he just didn't die- at least not permanently. He seemed to be able to do things that he definitely shouldn't be able to, such as being seventeen and defeating a Dark Lord that had tormented hundreds of adults. He was also ridiculously attractive, so there was that. Honestly, it wouldn't surprise Draco to learn that Potter managed to bless the rains of Africa from a mall in the United Kingdom. Harry was strange in many ways, almost to the point of being eccentric.
Ginny laughed, twirling a strand of her strawberry colored hair. "We simply had the most amazing, passionate, sensual relationship. We had the most blissful, pleasuring sex. Why the hell we he stoop to your level? You think you could ever give him what I could?"
His father just wanted everything to be normal- well, as normal as they could be. He wanted his family to fit this perfect image that he created, and he tried his hardest to mold his family into that image. He didn't care that he hurt his family in doing such, only caring that the public saw him smiling with the perfectly pure family. It didn't matter that Narcissa almost died giving birth to Draco, it only mattered that she wouldn't be able to have another child- Lucius always imagined having at least two children, preferably one girl and one boy. It didn't matter that Draco wanted to learn how to play the violin, it only mattered that his son could fly and perform spells at a young age. His family didn't matter.
"Of course," said Voldemort darkly. "After all, a few more dead bodies are always nice. Would you like to buried with Potty or no?"
"Right. I remember what happened between the two of you now!" Draco smiled at her, which made her lose the smile. "You hurt him. Of course, I know! You had the most scandalous affair with best friend's boyfriend."
"Hello sweetie," said another familiar voice. Dressed in a tan tee-shirt with a pair of black shorts, stood a smiling woman. Tuffs of brown hair stood in every direction, looking like a q-tip that had been in the wind. Around her neck was a silver necklace, with a beautiful blue elephant on it. She'd changed a little bit, but not enough that she wasn't unrecognizable.
"All of the time," said Millicent. "So please, take him and kiss him into the oblivion after potion's class."
Even once Draco grew closer to the age where he was expecting to be married off, he still felt nothing for any of the females his parents introduced him to. All of them were boring and seemed to possess no personality whatsoever. All of them were stuck-up twits that were only interested in Draco for the Malfoy fortune or for the idea of the gaining more leverage and power. Simply none of them possessed a bone in their body that actually cared the slightest hint about him,   except for potentially in a sexual aspect.
Harriet Potter simply infuriated Draco Malfoy to no end. Although, sometimes, frustrate was the more proper word, and it didn't always mean in an annoying sense. Draco found herself rather... flustered by the girl, more so than she'd like to admit. It confused and irritated Draco beyond belief, almost driving her insane at times. Draco realized that Potter very well could have been her breaking point.
"Your meal, sir," said a man with a long drawl. He wasn't exactly very tall, although he wasn't the shortest man that Harry had ever seen. With a sharp jawline and a pointed nose, he looked like a rich aristocrat. Snowy blond hair was neatly slicked back, the smell of his expensive gel wafting into Harry's direction. He was frowning disappointedly at Harry, as if he had somehow offended him. Dressed in a black shirt and a pair of trousers, he looked oddly beautiful. His golden name tag read Draco.
Everything was just so... wrong, and it wasn't helping that all of her thoughts eventually bounced back to a certain emerald eyed woman. None of this seemed right. Absolutely none of it.
The entire situation felt wrong, as if his brain were twisting the situation to some sort of nightmarish reality. Harry had always suffered- well, more like since he turned thirteen- with vivid hallucinations. That must have been what was going on currently, he decided. None of this was real, he chose, but rather a twisted hallucination.
It was December twenty-third, and Draco was having a party at his mansion. Large chandeliers hung from the ceiling, the champagne of the guests sparkling under the lighting. The previously well scrubbed floors, which almost seemed to shine under the lights, were now filled with footprints and spilled champagne. The ballroom walls, painted a gentle lilac color, were now hidden behind several individuals who were leaning against the wall.
As to avoid a marriage to a man she disliked, Juliet faked her own death. The priest was unable to get word to Romeo, and after hearing Juliet was dead through his messenger, Romeo returned to Verona. He went to Juliet's grave, killed Paris, and upon seeing Juliet's dead body, committed suicide.
Ever been interested in dating a man who doesn't bathe regularly, might be a vampire or a serial killer, hates every house except for Slytherin, teaches potions, has a potential vampire kink, dressed in all black, enjoys sneering at people, and hides in the dungeon like an overgrown bat? Well, you just might be in luck. Please meet the newest eligible bachelor, Mister Severus Snape of Hogwarts! All inquiries may be sent to students other than those in Slytherin.
"Oi! Mind having some manners?" His voice was unusually thick, almost like he had an accent that wasn't one hundred percent 'the standard English accent'. It was very likely that he was Scottish, considering that he hadn't pulled out a Bible like the Irish were said to do.
"Get the hell out of my home," said Draco, nearly kicking Blaise as he got off the couch. "You disgusting, horny bastard."
They'd been dating for a three years, after Draco chose to rebel against his family. He'd changed so much that Harry couldn't help but fall head over heals in love, it was impossible to avoid. After all, Harry wasn't able to help his attraction to other seekers- he had a type.
Harry hummed. "Then be glad you're not me. My breathing annoys him. I think that if he could, he'd strangle me and hang me by my toes."
Perhaps maybe Draco could overlook the dog thing. Maybe they weren't such terrible creatures after all.
"Mr.Potter, I thought we settled everything last Friday," said Draco, his tone neutral. Despite wanting to move on and pretend that Harry didn't cause his pupils to dilate or his pulse to quicken, Draco simply couldn't do it. His fairly muscled chest was hidden by a royal purple color shirt, with white buttons that looked ready to be unbuttoned. The black trousers he wore gently hugged his lean legs, and Draco was trying not to let his eyes wander too far. Harry Potter was beautiful, and he was going to be the death of Draco if he kept it up.
Those people would move on- get married, have a couple kids, almost get a divorce, and die in the war before they could do anything else. It wasn't a life Harry wanted, but it was still more promising than the life he was currently leading. They might even survive the said war and have a couple more kids. They could live and see their children go to Hogwarts and cry while reading their child's first letter home. Maybe that fate wasn't so terrible, having kids and settling down somewhere warm with someone you love.
"You're my best friend, and I love you. I love you, Harry James Potter. I want you to be happy. You deserve to be happy. I know that love doesn't exactly make everyone happy, but I think you just might be happy. I can't say I'm an expert on this sort of stuff, but don't waste your life away because of one bad thing that happened." Hermione hugged her best friend after she finished her speech. She really hoped she was right.
Narcissa smiled at her son-in-law. "Come on in. I'm sorry to tell you Harry, but I don't have a red carpet you can roll out for Draco."
Raven black hair stuck up messily in every direction, which wasn't anywhere's near a cute messy. With thin rimmed black glasses, which looked well in need of replacement, she looked kind of nerdy- still not in an attractive manner. Her tan skin was a bit tanner, likely from the amount of Quidditch practice she'd fit in her schedule. A thin layer of black eyeliner framed her emerald green eyes, which made her eyes stand out- even with the glasses. Her frame was usually hidden by baggy clothing that looked like third generation hand-me-downs, which very well could have been the reason Draco hadn't really noticed her.
"I mean, he's so extra. Like, really?" Pansy rolled her eyes. "He's a damn brat, that's all. He could fall down the stairs, and literally no one would care. I'd probably laugh and throw a party."
And that had been enough for Harry to up and leave the dormitory. He ignored Hermione's frantic whispering about dangers lurking in the dark, choosing that her words would be encouragement to pick up his pace. He'd walked far away from them, as though they carried the plague. He'd just wandered slightly off course, and when he looked around, he was shocked to see he was standing in the Astronomy tower.
What this story failed to mention was practically everything that happened that wasn't perfect. It was a well crafted lie, leaving everything negative that happened out. "Of course I went to Pansy's house, she was having a party! We shared a bottle of beer while playing strip poker, talked about the sexually scandalous stuff we got up to in Hogwarts Academy, had more beer while we nibbled on snacks, and we went to her bedroom to finish what we started back in the Academy. And then, I passed out in her bed, naked next to her."
Romeo, out of what he believed was love, killed Tybalt, Juliet's uncle. Before Tybalt went down, he stabbed Romeo's best friend, Mercutio, who bleed to death while dramatically making jokes. For murdering Tybalt, Romeo was banished, as both the Montagues and the Capulets received warnings about fighting with each other.
Harry stared into Lucius's eyes, his hard gaze never wavering. His emerald green eyes were so dark that they almost looked black- that would have been very bad for several reasons. Harry's light pink lips were pursed into a thin, disapproving frown. It was obvious what Harry thought of the entire situation, and it was clear that he didn't care if everyone knew how he felt. He was hardly blinking at all, as if he were afraid that he wouldn't catch on of Lucius's sly movements.
Upon waking from her slumber, Juliet saw Romeo's dead body. And she took her own life with a dagger. That was how they were found.
There would a large funeral, which a variety of uniquely colored flowers for his grave. A speech composed of many fancy words would be read by either an overly emotional person or a person with no emotion whatsoever. People would mourn him and cry for their dead savior, whether they knew him or not, as they had to face a war without their main soldier who would willingly do anything to protect those said people. They would then take his corpse and bury him in the Earth's surface, alongside his mother and father.
Harry looked up from where he'd been staring, she was already gone. She didn't give him time to thank her, but it might have been because she was on edge with him. He supposed it was reasonable, considering that he was eating alone, and he did look fairly intimidating.
It was once he turned seventeen that he received the best daydream ever. It was simply blissful, and it filled his soul with joy.
"Hey love. I made you a cuppa tea." Raven black hair stood in every direction, revealing a scar that looked like a lighting bolt on his forehead. His tan skin seemed to gleam under the light, making him look almost ethereal, like what Draco imagined an angel to look like. The heavenly white shirt he wore was tight enough to show all of his muscle, which made Draco stiffen a bit. Otherwise, he only wore a pair of flannel boxer shorts, which only added to the problem Draco had to face. Harry Potter was beautifully handsome, and he knew it.
"And it's your choice Harry. It's entirely up to you, whether you give him a chance or whether you think he's not worth your time. And I know that you won't trust him right off, and I understand that. But you need to know that not every person is out to screw you over. Not everyone wants to hurt you.
It was then that Lucy chose that she would make an appearance. She was fifteen pounds, although she believed herself to be an enormous guard dog. Lucy looked like a big puff ball, which may or may not have had something to do with the fact that she was half Pomerania- it was believed she may have been part Poodle as well. She jumped on Draco's leg, yapping excitedly.
Harry thought that he looked bland and generic, compared to many of the other individuals he'd seen before. With ebony black hair that was fairly long for a male, he looked like an younger version of his father- not that he knew that. Big emerald green eyes, framed by long eyelashes, always seemed filled with guilt and sadness, was a feature that he was proud of. A broken pair of glass, which should have been replaced years ago, rested on the tan skin of nose, surely didn't help his pathetic case.
Harry's smile only grew. "You know Miss Parkinson, I think that's a brilliant idea. I'll buy roses." Harry turned to walk away. "Oh, and Miss Parkinson?"
Pansy Parkinson, Astoria Greengrass, Daphne Greengrass,  and Janet Parkinson (a cousin of Pansy's) were just a few of the many people his people introduced as potential spouses. And yet, none of them held any appeal to Draco. All of them were beautiful, but they just weren't for him. No matter what they said or did, he just wasn't attracted.
"As if I'm the one with the over inflated ego," cooed Harry. That statement was simply hilarious, considering that the Malfoy lineage was known for being cocky, arrogant, snobby, and having over inflated egos. Although Draco had become less arrogant and snobby (considering he married a tattoo artist that his parents weren't fond of- at first), he still had the over inflated ego problem. In Draco's eyes, he was simply the most stunning bloke that God ever made, with Harry coming in second place- Harry agreed with that statement.
Draco stretched out on the bed, hearing the bed creak underneath him. He threw the crimson duvet off of him, before slowly draping his pale legs over the side of the bed. Immediately, his pale chest filled with goosebumps, which made him realize that he was without a shirt. His bare feet touched the color wood floor, making him feel even more cold. Without further thought, he got back into bed, covering himself back up with the crimson duvet.
Woman were extremely beautiful, even Draco had enough sense to notice that. But Draco, despite seeing their beauty, just didn't feel anything more than friendship with any of them. Even the most beautiful woman, Draco still felt nothing. He could admire their aesthetic, but he simply didn't feel the urge to do anything physically intimate with them- something he didn't dare mention to his father. As if he needed to give his miserable, stuck-up father another reason to scold him and threaten to disown him.
Harry gave Luna a dark look, his nose scrunching. "That's mean. I loved Draco, I'm going to marry him."
"Thanks sweetie." Draco smiled at him, accepting the warm cup of tea offered to him. Cautiously, he wrapped his fingers around the blue tea cup. He took a sip, wincing when the burning hot liquid began to slid down his throat. "Are Rosetta and Esmeralda ready to go to their grandparents' house?"
About a half an hour later, Draco returned to the table, carrying the man's check and offering him a to-go drink and dessert. Harry politely declined both offers, saying how full he was, along with praising the cook's work.
She had such smooth looking tan skin, almost as smooth as a babies- given, it could have been photoshop, but still. Draco could only imagine how- no, it was time to stop write there.
"I know you wouldn't," said Millicent earnestly. "You come to me for dating advice, because you're awful at flirting. 'Oh Saint Potter, please notice me and kiss me. Oh Potter, come over here and tell me I'm pretty'."
Inside, everything looked rich, almost to the point that it felt foreign and wrong to so much as graze it. Everything was dust free, courtesy of Draco's maids- Pansy, Millicent, Daphne, and Astoria. Golden chandeliers, each costing anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars, illuminated the clean furniture. The fine furniture was dark in color, without so much as a dent or scratch upon the surface. But most importantly, there was no room for a dog or any other sort of pet upon the expensive leather couch.
"I'm thinking, and I think saying Draco Malfoy is my boyfriend sounds nice." Harry smiled at Draco. "I like the way your name rolls off my tongue."
Twenty five years ago, James Potter, was driving home with Lily and their one year old son- Harry James Potter. Darkness enveloped them, fought off only by the bright headlights of James's car. The narrow road that led to the smaller groups of backroads, which eventually led the Potter Cottage was always dangerous to drive on- especially during the night. A shrill scream from Lily came too late, too late for James to pull out of the way of a drunk driver. Both Lily and James died, while their son Harry survived only with a lightening shaped scar.
"Blaise, you're a horny pervert, just encase you didn't know," said Draco, rolling her eyes as she began to lay down on the couch. Her baby blue silk dress slid up her legs, showing off more of her pale skin. She crossed her legs, a habit that she'd formed when she was younger.
"Please make yourself at home," said Harry, gesturing around with his arm. The smile he gave Draco was bright and adoring, laced with love.
"Perhaps you should, sir." Draco gave him a small nod, his Adam's Apple bobbing slightly. "Do you need anything else, sir?"
Lucius Malfoy maintained his rather distant, cold look, his eyes conveying his emotions instead. While his lips continued to remain in a frown, his eyes held a warmth that was unusual for him- a look that was used more frequently with his wife and son (well, occasionally with his son's husband). Dressed in a white tuxedo, his eyes scanned over his son and his son's husband, immediately tutting over Harry's clothing choices. "Pity. Here I was, thinking that perhaps you finally got a fashion sense."
"Of course you are," growled Lucius in a threatening manner. His eyes took on a warning look. "Moral corruption doesn't exist in the Malfoys."
Draco sighed, realizing that he was pathetically desperate. He couldn't even bring himself to talk to her, much less confess his undying love to her. He'd seen her so many times, all of which he used to gawk and stare as though she were going to disappear right in front of him.
"They can't be brothers, unless the mother cheated. Can't you tell, one's white and the other's tan?" A woman stalked by, her hair cut into a bob. Dressed in a red polka dot shirt and shorts, she looked to be around roughly forty years old. The meanest scowl was resting on her face, which didn't make her look very attractive.
Daydreams, each and every one of them, varied from person to person. Some daydreams oozed with happiness, while others were just random, funny things that weren't even possible. Daydreams weren't confined to a single space, they could occur anywhere, at any time. They were truly strange, a phenomenon that Draco couldn't truly pinpoint.
"No kidding," said Draco, a disgusted look on his face. He looked as though he'd bitten into a lemon- with his nose scrunched up and his eyes holding a harsh look, it was hard to say that's not what he looked like.
