When Draco stood up, he wiped tears away from damp cheeks. “Come on Potter, get dressed. As appealing as you are without a shirt on, I can’t have you walking around bare-chested, you might start a riot.”
Hari could never hope to achieve that level of attractiveness that came from confidence. Or did the confidence come from the knowledge that he was attractive. Oh, Draco certainly was conceited enough to think that way.
Hari’s mouth popped open like a guppy. The white hot rage he had felt in the confined space of the parlor drained away to unexpected shyness. Flushing red, Hari hid his face in Draco’s welcoming chest. A giddy smile threatened to spread across his face as he remembered the secret confession he heard between mother and son. Struggling with his emotions, his eyes glanced up shyly to search Draco’s eyes. He desperately wanted the words to be true and for someone to love him, as Draco claims to do. Strangely enough, Hari began to believe him.
"Emmet, I told you not to do that." Alice hissed. "What are you doing here? I thought you didn't work tonight and usually you are at the bar."
Oh, he tried! To be good. To do as he was told and not asked questions. But his heart and soul was battered and bruised, like his body should have been, except it wasn't. The bruises disappeared, save the memories of the phantom pain.
"Now, now Mr. Potter, don't get upset, a title is just a title. Did you know that while the name Potter is in fact a very common English name, it was corrupted from one of your ancestors hobbies?" With a nod of confirmation the chieftess went on. "Yes your ancestor full name was Linfred of Stinchcombe in the twelfth century, he was quite good with herbology and potion making, and because friends and family would often see him pottering around the garden, they called him the Potterer."
Hari joined in, and Draco was surprised when Hari pitched his voice higher. He sounded more like a chipmunk. “Hi Draco, my name is Teddy. Nice to meet you.”
The feeling wasn’t enough, Hari wanted to see. Using what felt like the rest of his depleting strength, Hari forced himself onto his elbows and heaved up onto his forearms.
, roused him from a fitful sleep beneath the stoop of a shop called, Nik's Bake n' Take Bakery. Then he heard the click of a lock and a bell jingle. It was the toe of someone's boot and a man's raspy voice that jolted Harry into full wakefulness with a racing heart. "Kid! Hey, Kid. Wake up."
"Don't know!" Draco answered, he hadn't been paying attention to any of the other members of the group except Hari and the surrounding club.
Kreacher's big ears drooped as he hung his head. "Kreacher thought Master Harry Potter would be happy to have a family here. It's just the master, and old Kreacher in this big townhouse. Kreacher has nothing to do once Master Harry Potter goes back to schools." Kreacher appeared to be shrinking in on himself as he spoke, shoulders hunched, ears drooping, and head bowed.
Draco was crying, tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. He gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry Potter staring at him over his shoulder.
When he had gotten back to his bed, he had another problem; what to do with the soiled garments. He thought about stuffing them in a pillowcase, but then they’d get moldy. He remembered contemplating just counting his losses and tossing the pair away. But he hadn’t many pairs at the time and so he cleared a spot on the wardrobe floor and left them to, hopefully, dry.
"It's a basic guide...oh you can't read it...here!" Draco fumbled for his wand and tapped the cover much like he'd tap the Marauder's Map. "sponsum et stirpis" He muttered the words in Latin.
“It is a simple spell, really Corbeau. Stops your body’s bowel and urinary tract , nothing to worry about, I know the counter-curse as does Draco.” Narcissa explained hurriedly.
The song opened up with a ballad on piano. When the chorus struck, Arlys enthusiastically bounced around the stage, the long heavy velvet cape not hindering her movements at all as she sang.
, and sprint across it running over drinks right and left to jump down in front of Hari first and pump his hand and chattered wildly at him.
Lucius Malfoy once more had the Voice Muting Jinx removed. His head was thrown back and his voice echoed in the chamber, “DEATH!” The jinx was immediately put back on him, with only that one word testimony, clearly it was going to spill into another rant.
Hari reached out his trembling hand to grasp the pale willow wand, two delicately strands twined around each other in an intimate dance. Hari felt the wood vibrate between his fingertips, and his magic hummed just beneath the surface of his skin.  “Spectacular!” Hari mumbled, giving the wand a quick flick sending whimsical bubbles in a rainbow of colors from its tips.
"Well that's all going to change soon. I wrote that letter to Kingsley. I hope he owls soon. I was never very good at speeches or letters before, will you read over my draft I prepared for testimony? I don't think I can make it in person."
"You left...left a...a window open. hahaha!" Draco began to laugh and fell back against the couch cushion. For the average wizard, the item summoned had to be within sight of the summoner for the charm to work. Hari Potter was not an average wizard after all. Only Hari Potter would shrug off his accomplishments so easily. Salazar, Draco loved this extraordinary boy. Hari sniffed and didn't bother dignifying that with a response as he heard a clicking sound as the phial of dittany zipped into his hands.
"I'm counting it." Draco sing-songed. "We camped under the stars, too." Draco hummed in satisfaction when Hari only growled.
"Severus! Severus!" Minerva shouted as she rushed through the Dungeons. His office was tucked back far from the classroom, but close to the Slytherin's common room. Even so, after decades of teaching, she rarely visited the maze that made up the Dungeons. There were few markers to guide her and countless students, save the scuff of the stones and rub warn corners from student's hands as they made their turns.
Hari watched transfixed as Draco swallowed him deeper and hollowed his cheeks providing suction. When Draco’s hand moved lower to fondle his balls, supernovas exploded beneath his lids.
"Harry." Nik smiled and pushed over the plate of steaming breakfast Harry had in days that wasn't stolen from a side-car vendur, swiped off someones discarded plate, or from the trash.
An alpha command. Something that if Draco was mature enough he could have fought, but wisely he backed down. Perhaps soon his own alpha would be stronger, but not today. He listened to his mother and with chair scraping on the hardwood floor, slamming the dining room door on his way out, and stomped up four flights of stairs.
This was a frightening thought, especially to the ex-Auror, Alastor Moody, whose token phrase was, "Constant vigilance". Too many people knew the location of Headquarters and having too many loose tongues could get you and your loved ones killed.
Draco was hidden beneath the invisibility cloak, seething with a jealous rage. He was currently busy trying to keep his alpha dragon from roasting the man enthusiastically pumping Hari’s hand. He felt aggravated and itchy under his skin; the crowed was growing, a mob appearing. He had to do something, he couldn’t get trapped. He had to get these people away from Hari.
Draco only hovered over the chimneys of the row of townhouses. From this angle they could see the line shimmering mirage between the disillumination charm that separated them from the Muggle homes. The truly magnificent restoration of the Black townhouse; five stories, lavish garden, and a gleaming white glassed owlery atop the roof.
Some of you voiced concerns for my health. I am doing fine. As well as could be expected, in this pandemic.
Glancing past the lodes of cars on the pavement, he saw the pale figure of his boyfriend next to an equally tall but dark figure of Blaise Zambini. They were both laughing and leaning into each other, their mouths moving a mile a minute.
Mrs. Malfoy became desperate and determined to do whatever it took to save her son. She went to the only person able to help her son while at school, Professor Snape. She performed the Unbreakable Vow with Bellatrix Lestrange as Conductor. Professor Snape was to do everything in his power to aid her son in his task set to him by Voldemort, or finish the task himself. She understood that with her husbands failure, Voldemort would never hold the Malfoy name in high esteem again, they no longer were members of his inner circle, the laughing stock of the Death Eaters, and he made it very clear as he lived in the Malfoy Manor, that he held their entire lives in his hands. It wasn't until the Final Battle at Hogwarts, when Voldemort had cast the Killing Curse once more, and had Mrs. Malfoy check to see if I was still alive that she saw her chance. She put her hand on my heart, felt my heartbeat, asked if her son was still alive, and when I confirmed that he was, she looked Voldemort straight in the eyes and told him I was dead.
The witch with big yellow hair and abnormally large white nails saw Hari and dug said nails into the other witches arm, causing her to yelp. When Horrid red hair saw him in turn, they squawked and squealed over each other, and no doubt would have clambered over the counter if it wasn’t for Hari’s quick lifting of a halting hand.
"Blasted house-elf! Something to numb!" Draco could barely concentrate his thoughts through the pain. "Star Grass Salve...get the..." CRACK. Dot had left. Presumably to do what he ordered.
Hari smiled not really understanding what they were laughing about, but happy that the two sisters were getting on well enough to be laughing together out in the open air in the back garden of Grimmauld Place. Hari knew that Narcissa called her son Dragon so he knew that they were laughing at Draco's expense, but he didn't realizing that the corbeau,
Hari sighed as they approached the Lord and Lady Mausoleum on the vast Malfoy estate. Upon arrival at Malfoy Manor, Hari was shocked to see the burnt out husk that remained of the once elegant and resplendent Manor.
“Err…yeah.” Hari was getting a sinking sensation in his stomach that coming to Draco for help was a bad idea.  Draco sat up.
Hari suddenly realized that other than his family, no one would show up and Hari felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness at the thought of no one coming to your funeral. To be hated, mistrusted, or too afraid to come.
The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black are distant descendants of the Antipodean Opaleye. The how is speculated on, but the results are the same. Opaleye's are remarkably peace-loving dragons with pearl like scales and glittering pupiless, multi-colored eyes, and firey-red breath.
“And where is here, exactly?” Draco asked as he looked across the way to where Hari pointed. He felt his jaw drop in wonderment.  Towering over head was the sight of two majestic metal wings sweeping out as if in flight.
He would often listen to the telly while gardening, because he wasn't allowed to watch television with his family or at all. In one of Dudley's favorite shows the hero would often wait ten seconds even after the coast was clear, just in case. It sounded like sound advise.  So, Harry waited the extra seconds, counting slowly to ten.
All around them, Muggles glanced at the pair and whispered. Some happy for the open couple, others concerned at the show of tears, and more so with reproachful eyes. Draco paid no mind to the small minded Muggles and focused his comfort in Hari who cried into his shoulder.
Draco leaned over Hari, close enough that his silver blonde hair brushed Hari's cheek. Hari blinked opened his eyes to stare into Draco's inhibited gray eyes. Draco said,"Don't worry these aren't the only scars I own."
Pulling off the tarp, dust shooting up into the air from the year of sitting idle, Hari hoped it was running alright. He really wanted to see Draco’s face when he got on and jump started it. He got rid of the sidecar and Draco would have to ride behind him on the seat. Rolling it out of the shed, Draco was just walking up to the shed, having taken his sweet time walking the path.
"Very well, now that you have delivered the eviction notice, just this morning, I might add, we have thirty days to evacuate the premises. If you wish to forcefully remove us from my aunts home, you best have a warrant or my lawyers will be in touch with the London Police department. Now I shall personally, have my solicitar ring the bank to handle the past due amount on the mortgage. They'll call you, don't call on us again. Good day, gentlemen" And with that Harry Potter, with no familial relations to Andromeda Tonks at all, slammed the door on the banksman, the locksmith and two police officers.
“Upon my sons sixteenth birthday, he was forced to take the Dark Mark, with an assignment to finish his initiation into the ranks. He was given two tasks to complete before he finished the school year. The first was to repair a Vanishing Cabinet somewhere in the school, to link it with its pair in a shop in Nocturne Ally; from there Death Eaters could then enter Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The second task was to kill the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. I was aware of both tasks.” Narcissa continued in a rush to implore the Wizengamot. “But my son is not evil, he is not a murderer. He couldn’t do it. I did everything in my power to make sure that Draco wouldn’t have to live with the stain of blood on his hands. I went to Severus Snape, Draco’s godfather.”
" Hari gasped in his arms, looking up at Draco as if seeing him for the first time. "Father never denied me anything, so naturally I expected to get the book." Draco paused. "He told me no. For the first time in my life, I remember feeling anger. I threw a tantrum right there in the bookstore." Draco paused. Hari could see his eyes were far away.
Hari had only one answer to give. “ Yes, gods, yes.” Draco was already smothering the acceptance with heated kisses.
Aryls was there next to Hari pulling him away towards the stage. Draco blinked. He was alone in a room full of unfamiliar scents and bodies, and noise. Hari was not longer with him. Draco watched Hari shrink through the crowd, the further he got away the more panic started to sink into Draco's bones. Then he saw Hari move up the steps to the stage. He could see him visibly shaken.  Arlys must be in this round, because she never left Hari's side.
“Oh, oh wait. I got this, run into certain death and survive? Or—ow!” Hari hit his arm none too gently.
"Whew! Thanks, Mrs. Tonks. Sorry for the intrusion. I don't have much privacy these days, can't be too careful." He flicked the hood off his head, untied the string at his throat and swung the Invisibility Cloak off his shoulders. "May I hold 'em?" Harry asked holding out his arms to the swaddled and still wailing baby.
Currently retching into a bucket, Harry couldn’t make out Kreacher muttering soothing nonsense, like “there-there, ‘ol Kreacher’s got Master Harry. All’s all right. Let all that poison leave your body. Kreacher’s going to make you better now.”
It was a bloody disaster. First the tight leather skirt restricted his movement, unlike Hogwarts lady's skirt uniform, he had to now unzip and try without the skirt on. Then he discovered that he couldn't stand and get the bloody things on. So sitting in lacy black nickers on a overturned crate, he rolled up the toe, slipped it on and pulled up mid thigh. Not daring to sigh in relief, he's heard Pans curse up a storm for tearing her stockings before, he proceeded to do the same with the other leg. Standing gingerly he tried to pull it higher but had to stop mid thigh. Once again he had to stop and think, before closing his eyes and accepting his fate. Grasping them around the waist, he tugged, and pulled, and stretched, even bleeding hopped to get the stockings up to his navel and snapped it in place. He was ashamed to realize he was out of breath and worried the others would hear him from outside. Panting slightly, he once more zipped up the skirt.
Just like that Hari’s frustration was over. Malfoy was still Malfoy; he wasn’t lost to deeply in his guilt as Hari was not too long ago. The world seemed to straighten itself out. Hari laughed light heartened.
Hari froze, he didn’t think he was ready for that. Draco rose over Hari, engulfing him with his body’s heat. The weight of him actually comforted Hari’s nerves and his worries melted away. He relaxed into Draco’s touch.
But then he turned back around and looked up to see Bill’s scarred face. With eyes full of sympathy and not pity, he addressed Bill’s final point. “Greyback is to blame for your scars. He’s dead. It’s in the past. You don’t have to forget, and most likely never will. But let’s move on.” He said imploringly. That did it for Draco; he couldn’t possibly be more in love with Hari Potter than he was right now. If Bill didn’t give into Hari’s demands, he might just let his dragon rip into the red headed Weasley for intruding on his and Hari’s sanctuary.
“The third time, Lucius was to lead a group of Death Eaters, undetected into the Department of Mysteries to set up an ambush, while Voldemort used our connection to lure me out of the Castle. He realized our minds were linked together through this scar when I informed the Order members that Voldemort was after something in the Department of Mysteries. Dumbledore sent Order members to guard what I believed at the time was a weapon. I was later able to use this same connection to save Mr. Weasley’s life when he was attacked protecting the weapon.” Bill’s eyes widened in realization at this information, while Dumbledore never told them everything, Bill was finally getting some unanswered questions. This was the changing point in the war. Draco on the other hand, was hearing all this for the first time from Hari’s lips paying close attention to the words that sealed his fate.
He didn't think he said that out loud, but Narcissa leaned over, nevertheless, and placed her palm on Hari's knee. Narcissa spoke softly.
Next Draco traced the jagged knife wound on Hari's arm. Its position mirrored the placement of the Dark Mark that marred Draco's own skin. Hari knew this mark. The origin of this scar haunted his dreams still. The final task, the towering hedges, the Cup that was a portkey, Cedric's death, being chained to a tombstone, helpless, hopeless. The cold of the metal and then the sering pain as the knife carved his blood out of his skin, so that Peter Pettigrew could use his blood to resurrect the body of Lord Voldemort.
a spell that will protect Grimmauld Place as a whole instead of just the windows. Harry’s eyesight wavered, and he became dizzy. Something was wrong, he’s never cast a protection spell over one area so large before, perhaps Grimmauld place was larger than once believed. He had to continue otherwise they’d just return with a vengeance.
"Cho-cho, there you are. I got us the tickets for the theatre." Dudley said, uncomfortably looking at Hari as if he'd say something outrageous. Hari looked between he and Cho in confusion. Cho looked wearily back and forth between the too.
Once in he discovered the skirt rode high on his waist and covered his navel, and it was quite short.
“My favorite colour is green, not because it is one of Slytherin’s House colours, but because they are the shade of your eyes. Emerald green to be exact but they change depending on light, sometimes from a jade to a deep forest.” Draco said staring into his eyes. “But…” Draco said with a smirk, noting Hari sudden flush to his cheeks, “I may reconsider that colour.”
Draco raised his eyebrow at Blaise's childlike behavior. "Yes, Blaise, our relationship is too new. I can't risk it. Especially since his inheritance is right around the corner.
"I've never had to question my blood status." Draco said sharply sitting up, resting one ankle beneath the knee of the other on his side. Hari sat up cross legged a look of frustration on his face. "Half-breeds are different than a creatures inheritance. They cannot glamour or hide or suppress their creatures appearance at all. While, I and others like my family, can." Draco let out a long breath through his nose to stop his rising ire. He rubbed a frustrated hand through his hair.
And C'iemone was right. Aryls couldn't sing particularly well. She did; however, look like she was having fun and as the words of the song said, having a good time.
Hari easily caught up Teddy in his arms and rocked and soothed him to soft gurgles with gentle shushing sounds. Draco eagerly moved closer to coo at the near three month old. He didn’t laugh, he wouldn’t be able to yet, but he stared fixity up at Draco content to be cradled by Hari. Then miraculously Teddy smiled and his hair melted away. No, his tuft of hair lightened in colour, to a pale white. Blonde to match Draco’s own.
Harry's messy head of black hair and thick rimmed glasses peeked over the edge. It was a new person.
"I'm not some young maiden you could spill sweet words to to make the damage you've done irreversible. I'll go..."
Queen Beryl stepped forward in a long mermaid style purple dress and violent red hair just as the musical arrangement began to play. The sound of a Saxophone, trumpets, guitar, and a rhythmic drum beat could be heard before the keys of a piano and Queen Beryl began singing about demanding respect from her man when he got home. It was lively and everyone went wild.
If man were really meant to be killers, so many of the young men and women wouldn't have so much trouble coping with the after effects of war.
Harry Smiled, "KREACHER!" he shouted as he slowly sat up, but not getting up off the ground. When his own house-elf appeared, he continued, "This is Dot and Kocoa. Please show them where to put Mal...ah...Draco's and Mrs. Malfoy's trunks. Also show them to the attic where they will be staying." For once Kreacher didn't respond just did as told. Harry waited for the other two to come from around the shed, when they didn't appear right away he frowned contemplating going out to great them, worried that perhaps they were ambushed. But he held back a moment, his wards would have told him if more than just the Malfoy's tried to enter the back alley.
The first rotation they asked for acceptance, with the second rotation they asked to be protected, and for the third they asked to be cleansed.
Scoffing, Draco nudged Hari and said, "At least I never lost to a Hufflepuff in Quidditch, aye Potter?"
He couldn’t go back to the Weasley’s; it was too depressing with the death of Fred looming over everyone’s head. He didn't want to go with Hermione to Australia looking for her parents after she Obliviated them in order to protect them from the fallout of the war.
Taking that as the end of the argument, she jotted down the order and lumbered away gracefully on stiletto heels. Draco wasn’t disturbed by the patrons; he was simply baffled by how open these people were about their sexuality. The wizarding world was far too conservative and he would never have dared frequent this type of establishment on his own, homosexual or not. Draco heard whispers, of course, from some of the Dark Lord’s followers, of private Halls deep within Knockturn Alley, where the affluent could sate their darker sexual desires in relevant secrecy. It was a darker secret that even Draco didn’t want to know or seek ‘pleasure’ from.
With a grunt, Winston hauled Justin out of the room and likely the club, but first calling the boys parents.
Aunt Petunia did not move a step forward, her fullward march frozen mid-step, face stuck in that awful position. Was she even breathing? Yes, he saw the slight rise and fall of her chest.
Draco looked intently at Hari wanting to know the answer to his question asked in jest, “so, what did you dream?”
He invited me to call him by his first name. Blaise is my first friend I made on my own at Hogwarts. It feels nice to have one that wasn't spying on my every actions. Father obviously doesn't believe I am ruthless enough, so I must step up my game.
She loved the fire. I then took an iron bristle brush to scrub off the residue between her scales. Honestly. I'll have to do this every other day.
Bill stepped back, but didn’t step down. You didn’t need to physically be stronger than the other alpha to win in dominance. He changed his strategy instead. “You’re in love with Hari, or at least attracted enough to him that
Collapsed on his knees, head spinning, and stomach churning, Harry fought not to heave. Getting his feet under him, Harry stood and looked around.  “Kreacher?”
“What are you doing here, Death Eater scum?” One hostile witch snarled. She had a rather horrid red hair, perhaps a botched  hair color charm done on her, and rather unlike Hermione Granger before fourth year, didn’t bother getting her teeth magically shrunk. Draco sniffed, beta, he thought with a sneer in return.
His face was so erotic in that moment. His cheeks were flushed gloriously red. His pillowy soft lips were plump from kissing and awaited another kiss, his breath wafting quick puffs of hot air against Draco’s face. His eyes opened with a flutter of dark lashes to reveal a slim ring of emerald around dark pupils blown wide. Draco thought his heart would race out of his own chest.
The announcement was met with gasps around the room. Hari rushed over to encircle Draco’s neck with a hug from behind. “I’m sorry.” Hari spoke softly into the nape of Draco’s neck.
"No. As if I'd give you another one of my journals. Once was enough. Thank you very much." He sniffed with his pompous head in the air.
Overcoming the awkwardness of sharing a broom with Draco, the weight and heat of Draco’s front on his back is a stark contrast to the weightlessness and coolness of the open air around them. The feeling was so familiar that it took him a moment to place.
"Okay Kreacher, take me to the Floo network." With another crack, this one expected, Harry and Kreacher disappeared away. Andromeda was left in the study surrounded by the Potter's personal artifacts and thought, 'Darn, I wanted to be there when the Minister gave Harry exactly what he wanted.'
Although it's a journal from Draco's point of view I tried to stay within cannon for events. For events that didn't have concrete dates, I made up. Do you guys know how much re-reading I had to do to try to stay on cannon with the timeline? My brain hurts! So many time jumps!!!!!
While his mother was doing everything in her power to save her only son, Malfoy was learning that life as a Death Eater was not as glamorous as he once idiotically bragged about to his friends during the start of term. No one believed me when I told the them that Malfoy was a Death Eater and was plotting something; not my friends, not my professors, and not the Headmaster, whom was the one being targeted. At the time I didn't know the details of the task, only that Draco had to finish it before the end of term. I followed him nearly all of Sixth term and watched as he became more withdrawn, and more reckless in his attempts to kill Professor Dumbledore.
He didn't know whose the baby was, and as long as it wasn't Potter's secret love child with Weaslette Draco would even admit that the baby was adorable, too. Even if Potter was practicing hair color treatments on it. Then he blinked long and hard when the baby's hair sudden changed from bright turquoise to soft lavender. '
"It's big... magnificent. " Draco says remembering the castle in its glory. "It's peaceful. It overlooks a lake. When the water is calm the surface is so smooth it looks like black glass. There's a boathouse. The area's surrounding is heavily forested, but students are forbidden from going inside. There is a small Scottish village about 5 kilometers out we can visit with our guardians permission after second year."
had flooded the lawn in areas, causing puddles of standing muddy water, and it was no good for the grass or the roots of the plants. Some planters were tipped over, and soil spilt out in areas, and the grass was pulled up in some areas from the tussle. Magic garden or no, Hari had a bit of manual labor to add to the garden to make it right again. He didn’t mind, the mess, the extra work, nor getting dirty.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
"No, no, he's participating in a Duel Championships and besides, he needs to finish his lesson plans. I'll send Hagrid, I can grant him temporarily use of magic while looking for the dear lost boy; after all, I am Supreme Mugwump and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot."
The snowy-white marble of Gringotts Wizarding Bank stood towering imposingly over the other shopfronts of the intersection between Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley. The multistoried building is just a front for the miles of underground rails and high security vaults located beneath the streets of London. The grander the wealth, the larger the vaults, and deeper beneath the ground the vaults go, the higher the security there is. The bank is run by goblins, extremely greedy creatures that would protect their wealth by any means, and have a code that forbids them to speak the secrets of the treasures and protection within. The motto for the bank is
"You!" The door swung open to reveal a purple faced man with a walrus sized mustache. The color drained away and the man was left with his mouth sputtering.
was a spell placed on all underaged witches and wizards that prevented pedifolia, succesfully preventing underage marriages and adults in authority preying on children, like educators or medical professionals. It also protected minors from juvenile alphas like himself, who couldn't yet control their alpha gene from preying on minors during rut season. Harry Potter would be safe from his unwanted advances, at least until he turned eighteen.
Do you think the animal portrayed on each of the Founders house crest represents a Patronus or an animagus?
"Constant vigilance," added yet another ward to the townhouse; a spectral dust-form of Dumbledore guards the entrance to Grimmauld Place and would not allow entrance until a variation of the key words, kill or murder, were spoken.
A hand on Draco's jaw drew his gaze down to stare into Hari's emerald eyes, though glass stained with splatters of dried tears. "May I see them? Your scars?"
Harry broke down crying, tiny Teddy in his arms. He clutched the tiny life to his chest as if his own heart would stop beating if Teddy was taken from him. Teddy began to whimper but didn't cry.
Potter moaned once and Draco mirrored the sound as his cock began to harden at the sight and sound of him lying helpless and unconscious at his feet. It wasn’t every day Draco had Potter right where he wanted him. Potter moaned again as he slowly stirred to consciousness, spurring Draco into quick action. Draco smirked mercilessly as he advanced on the unconscious boy of his fantasies, slowly loosening the Slytherin silver and emerald tie from around his neck. Kicking Potter’s wand further out of reach, Draco got on his knees, straddling Potter’s hips.
"Draco...Dragon" Harry mussed. "Mon petit...mon petit Dragon," he struggled to understand the french, knowing the answer was right there, but unable to grasp it.
Andromeda smiled mischievously. “If Draco can gather the correct HERBS!” Andromeda called out loudly, “then we can set them on the altar and cast the circle. After that it is a matter for ceremony, giving thanks, presenting our gifts as an offering to grant our manifestation. We’ll then burn the candles and keep them lit all day until the next ritual at noon, then dusk, and finally to the zenith moon. It is during the final ritual, the zenith moon, that the Black family will formally acknowledge you as master and head of the House of Black.”
Hari listened more intently than ever, his pulse racing. Hari felt momentarily affronted when Draco called him, loud, stubborn, foul mouthed, and sarcastic. The sting of the way he dressed already lessoned.
"Oh, we'll be here. Is Connor on the floor?" Sheryl winked as she made her way to the middle of the sectional. Alice jumped with joy and took her place next to her lover. C'iemone and Aryls took the left side, that left Hari and Draco on the right. Draco took the outside edge so Hari could sit by Sheryl.
“Circe, Hari…I didn’t mean that…I am not embarrassed to be seen in public with you.  No…It would be shameful for me, because it means I cannot provide adequately for you as a suitor. So…so…wear something of mine for now, let’s go shopping and you let me pick out your clothes.  I can’t afford extravagant things right now, so…it’s the least I can do.”
… Hari really wanted to feel connected to his mother; in any way he could other than having his mother’s eyes. But he was frightened to be rejected by something he so desperately desired, would be too much.
As the music began to play, Queen Daenerys slowly rose from her perch along with the lyrics. The crowd was defining.
“Honestly, I would love whatever you were willing to make for me.” Hari says peering down at the curious baby, peering around with a dummy in his mouth.
"Aw my dear, Minnie what can I do for you this evening?" Headmaster Dumbledore says calmly, his vocal cords strained with old age.
He was quickly but neatly shoveling small bites into his mouth, teeth barely flashing against the silver of the fork, before he glanced up at Draco. Covering his mouth with fork still in hand, he said, "Hurry up Dray, we have a busy day ahead of us." With a small nod of acknowledgment Draco dug into his own breakfast, with more gusto than he was brought up to consider etiquette. Not knowing if the meal was more enjoyable, because he hadn't had a proper meal in days, or if it was because it was made by Hari who ate with him.
Draco scoffed looking arrogant as always. “If I have to dress like a Muggle, be seen as a Muggle, I better be the best looking one, and not like some popper street urchin, hadn’t I?” Of course Draco had Muggle clothes it was required to blend in with Muggles when leaving the secluded wizarding villages and shopping centers. That answer irritated Hari, taking it as a personal insult to his own Muggle clothes he wore.
It must be magical, Harry concluded; otherwise how could such a large and vibrant garden be hidden away in such a dark and rundown townhouse as Grimmauld place was. The small terrace patio just left of the double glass patio doors hosted a small sitting area with glass table and five chairs. The terrace overlooked the garden with a curtain of scarlet bougainvilleas that fell to the garden floor below. The large half moon green lawn sparkled with morning dew, birdsong rang out from an abundant of trees providing a canopy of shade along the west wall, and a variety of colorful flowers, blossomed along the crescent moon gravel pathways. A smaller shaded patio area was set aside beneath the canopy, and half hidden in the southeast corner appeared to be a shed.
Front and center, Hari looked like a winter breeze could knock him over. Draco frowned. Where was his Gryffindor confidence?  He vaguely heard the voices of his group as he focused on Hari.
Alice lowered her voice and whispered in Draco's ear. "Sheryl's told me about your designs on our Hari. Hari's a bit shy and oblivious to most advances. He's either ignored or never noticed anyone coming on to him when he visits Sheryl. A bit innocent, but I bet he is really wild in the bed, though. When he is ready for a sexual relationship with you, "
“How old and what size you looking for?” The man gestured to the rack of baby blue teddy bear onesies they had been standing by.
I never want to go into the Dark Forest ever again. It is terrifying. At least I had Harry with me. We were looking for a Unicorn that had been separated from its herd. It was attacked and there was blood everywhere. Why did we have to seperate from the larger group, anyway?
The Head Clerk stopped counting a giant pile of Rubies, leaned over the top of his ledger, peering menacingly down at Harry from black beady-eyes.  "Mr. Potter, we goblins have been wondering when you would show your thieving neck here again." Jumping down from behind the counter, and rushing around the desk, the Head Clerk only stood at hip level, looking up at Harry and motioning him to silently follow him, he hurried away.
"Obliviate your mind, make you forget about seeing Hari and I here tonight. All you are going to remember is drinking while underage, getting hit on by some trashy drunk Queen and then thrown out by Winston, the Bouncer. And as for your camera. I'm going to keep it. When I get that owl afterwards, I will say that I obliviated a Muggle who caught me performing some trivial spell that my wand would have recoded prior to this. You shouldn't have tried to pull one over on a Malfoy, Finch-Fletchley."
to be Andromeda to cement the ceremony. As a Black by birth, the ceremony could only be conducted by either his aunt or his mother. When the topic was discussed, Draco remembered the creeping sensation he felt over his skin. As much as pure-bloods were accused of incestuous relationships, the idea of Hari as a sibling made him nauseous. Thus it was Andromeda, his aunt, and not his mother, claiming Hari as blood.
"Scarier than the Horntail; than facing Voldemort?" Draco asked. Hari looked up deeply into Draco's eyes.
With minimal effort the hammock began to rock. Draco looked down to see Hari’s emerald eyes trained intently on his face, a soft smile on his lips and faint rosy blush on his cheeks. Answering the smile with one of his own, he rested his head atop Hari’s messy black mop.
Harry taking on his haughtiest imperciation of his rival sneered back, "For your information for generations members of my family have been named after the constellations, you know...constellations, right? The Stars!" He drawled out in the most insulting manner imaginable.
‘I’m Dowager Malfoy now’ Narcissa was only a little shocked at being addressed as Dowager, 43 and already a widow. Her son is now head of the household and held all the power and control, something he lacked all his childhood. First with a domineering father like Lucius and later after the Dark Lord returned and shattered the illusion his father presented. Really, if only Draco had known Lucius was only a Beta. Narcissa could live with being a widow, losing her standing in the household; after all she got what she most wanted; her son safe, and her husband somewhere where he could not touch them anymore.
Draco rested his sweaty brow against the cool windowsill and just breathes in the scent of cool predawn air. The garden looked eerie beautiful in the dark, shadows cast from all directions, the only source of light coming from the faint light of the stars. He looked up into the dark sky smiling ryling. The constellation he was named after was just visible in the northwest. His mother told him that when he was born on the fifth of June at one o'clock in the morning, his father as per his mother's insistence, had looked up into the night sky and picked out the constellation dead center of the sky.
"Well my Dad was an unregistered animagus. His animal form was a red stag. He got the name Prongs from the antlers, I guess...you know two prongs, three prongs and such." He said as he attempted to organize a pile of clean?...clothes, and failed.
"Eighteen--of age--I'm nineteen--only for underage witches and wizards." Draco, Blaise, Cho, and Hari tried to explain over each other. There was a pause and then the three wizards and one witch began to laugh.
"Never! If anything, it would be omegas. Omegas are rare, perfect, fertile creatures that any alpha would love to have as a mate. Alphas are just very proud to begin with." Draco defended. "Betas are the only one of the three that do not have a creatures manifestation, though you could be classified as beta and not have any creatures blood at all."
"Shit, Draco are you alright?" Hari said kneeling over Draco to touch his arm. It was cold to the touch. Hari hadn't thought it was that cold in the study, but apparently Draco was freezing.
Andromeda reached out her hand to Hari’s own with the blood tear drops dripping to the grass. Together they unfurrowed Teddy’s fingers as he clenched them upon the unwelcome prick to his palm. His palm was painted bloody. Hari winced. He knew Teddy wasn’t in any pain, but he hoped to never see Teddy bleed again. They then placed their own bloody fingertips to Teddy’s palm. Their blood mixed.
Draco jumped caught off guard, but Andromeda replied calmly. “I was just suggesting to Draco that perhaps Hari would like to host a housewarming party once the rest of the ground floor was cleaned. Draco disagreed with the idea.”
“Well, for the most part it takes our libido out of commission. Like an Icey-shower, or so cold to the touch it burns. The area that touches the minor turns blue. You can even get frostbite.” Draco said.

his aunt had joked. But Draco was relieved nonetheless. He wanted Hari as a mate, damn it, not a brother.
Going red in the face, Hari kept quiet. A press of a hand on his shoulder had him looking up as Draco leaned over to peck his lips. Hari caught off guard only froze as his tea was stolen and a laughing Draco took a sip as he settled beside him at the table.
with a moving photograph of himself in a white straitjacket. ‘There you go again, Harry. Your Muggle roots are showing. Wizardkind would just use a Full Body Bind curse.
Andromeda’s smile was wide, and her eyes were warm and kind. “Aren’t you proud of all the work we’ve put into restoring this place? The Order member’s would be impressed with this place, having seen the disaster it was before. And wouldn’t you like to see your friends?” Although Hari didn’t know the calming effects of betas, he certainly seemed to take to the gentle persuasion. Or perhaps he just missed his friends after a month without them.
"Now for both your hair. C'iemone had a lot to work with Hari.' Arlys was explaining to Sheryl. "The poor boy only had one hair product. I'll be sending him home with shampoos and conditioners, along with a pamphlet on how to treat curly hair like his. Now that we got the tangles and cut away the dead ends we can style it."
Draco knew all to well why his mother was stopping him. He didn't trust himself and his new instincts anymore than she. His highly arousing and disturbing dream from the night before was any indication of how far his alpha will go to satisfy its base desires scared him.
They went back up to their booth for drinks and to cool off, but Hari was soon jumping up and dragging Draco back down to the mesh of flesh. There was a pleasant blush to his cheeks.
Carefully moving his eyes about the room without moving his head too much, Harry took notice of the two doorways; both door frames were made of cherry wood, the polish glowed red against the faint morning light coming in from the east. The east facing double glass doors was carved into four half circles; two of which mirrored each other, coming together at the doors center divide to create one whole circle, while the other two half circles were inverted to face the hinges. With one horizontal carved wood created the impression of a cross at the center of the doors. The fogged glass added privacy from anyone looking in or out of the study. The second set of doors, nearly took up the whole west wall of the study, rectangular with two large windows that bookended the double glass doors, optimizing the most out of any natural light that may come in from the west. Harry could just make out an iron fence, brick and green tree branches swaying in a summer breeze outside.
minus the lyrics 11,543 words. And for those of you who didn't know, over 8,000 of these words were originally part of chapter 15.
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “whatcha got, good?” He said as he sudley hid his now white bandaged hand from view.
“You’ve always been a pretty prat, Draco Malfoy.” Hari says with a look of awe of his face. His expression melted away. "Are you uh...I mean am I allowed to ask? Are you an alpha or omega, then?" Hari asked hesitantly.
Draco looked over the counter at Hari; laughing and scrubbing dishes. Draco couldn’t help but have a sudden feeling of apprehension. Of all Draco's bravado, it was a very real possibility that Hari would reject him. All he could think of was how he hoped Hari would give him a chance to prove that they could be good together. Because, Draco knew that by himself, he was no good.
Narcissa had to close her eyes in embarrassment for her son. "See love, you make great decisions, lets go to bed, am I sleeping in your bed or are you sleeping in mine?" Hari hissed, and Draco yelped.
"Would you like to look more like your mother, tonight?" Alice had the sudden insight to ask. "I will not force you if you truly don't wish to go drag tonight."
"You are looking good, Dudley. Good for you." And Hari found he felt genuinely happy for his cousin. He suddenly remembered that his cousin had made the effort at the end.
"Yes, he wasn't a Muggle sympathizer and he believed that having a wife who had a creature inheritance an embarrassment."
"You broke my board. You're going to pay for that!" He snarled centimeters from his face. The hand not currently wrinkling his shirt, raised in a face. If Draco could go any paler, he would.
“Where did you get off to?” Connor asked Oliver, snagging Mary from his grasp. In public Connor was Mary’s father and Oliver was her uncle who lived with them. It wasn’t something that any of them liked to pretend, but Mary was teased relentlessly at school, and the board of governors called in at one time. It was easier.
First, scent is used to identify self; who you are, what your secondary gender is, and what creatures’ blood you inherited. Each individual has their own unique scent, and although scents can be similar, usually familial, they are never the same. One can tell an individual’s secondary gender by scent, in general an omegas scent is reported to be sweater than alphas more savory scent. One might even be able to recognize what type of creature blood a wizarding family possesses by their elemental scent; earth, fire, wind, and water. Since, his inheritance Draco has come to realize that a dragon inheritance has a base smell of wind and fire.
"Asclepius's two daughters, Hygieia and Panacea. Hygieia is the snake that is carved into the tapestry in the Parlor. And Panacea is the snake carved into my bedroom door. There is also Ashur, on the entrance. But don't worry, they won't attack you...well...er...Ashur will if you enter the house uninvited, but don't worry, he won't attack you because you are invited into the home." Hari rushed to reassure Draco, who was still really pale from his earlier scare.
"Uh, I'm wearing contact lenses in my eyes." Hari explained with a vague wave of his hand near his face.
"Hari! HARI!?" Draco shouted. "Are all these songs about sex. I swear this song, sounds to me like a woman offering to give out blow jobs."
The dews at his feet glistened as the sun shone down through gentle clouds. He could taste the saturation in the air, as before a downpour, water began to gurgle in the fountain, but he didn’t let that distract him. “Grant us the truth of our hearts and insight into our wildest dreams. Show us in your currents, the  lives we touch, touch others as you flow through our fingers glance in time. For the dawn of tomorrow.” Hari says, his chest unclenching as he realized he spoke too fast for breath.
Draco shook his head at his mother, “That’s a moot point, she was a known Death Eater, had numerous acts of treason and murder against her. Her vaults would have been seized, if they were not already being transferred to the Dark Lord's vaults. Also she died in a Wizards duel. Her possessions would go to the victor, that’s Molly Weasley.
Closing his eyes once more, Harry decided to shift his thoughts. Perhaps his thoughts were not specific enough. Instead of thinking,
them? If she preserved their memories in a pensive first, she might be able to simply put them back in their heads.”
“It’s not that, I…” Hari tried. Draco took a breath through his nose and let it out his mouth. He tried to gentle his touch as he grabbed Hari’s arm to guide him to sit down in an armchair. He kneeled at Hari’s feet and pulled up his sleeve to show Hari his arm. Freshly healed, with the old scars crisscrossing the Dark Mark. “I wasn’t trying to kill myself, earlier. I know how you feel about death. Certain feelings just swim to the surface sometimes and it’s something I do to stop the itch… I was thinking…” He let out a humorless laugh.
"Marge, I have to go. I have a freak to deal with." She didn't wait for a reply just hung up and advanced towards that door. Each time the door swung back around to reveal her closer and closer with a mocking squeak of the door.
He didn't have to worry after all. He finished the crisps and tried a bright red, twisting rubbery candy that smelled faintly of strawberries.
"Ted was Andromeda's husband's name. We call him Teddy in memory. I...er...call him Teddy Bear, because I...um...like the endearment, and I like to snuggle him, I suppose." Hari admitted with a faint blush on his cheeks.
Caressing Draco’s collarbone, Hari kissed the top of his head before resting his chin utop Draco’s blonde head. “I’m sorry, Dray.” Hari said again.
The first to walk through surprisingly were two house-elves toeing a series of trunks via levitation charms.
Draco didn't realize he was that obvious in his staring. Fighting a blush, he took a deep breath, familiarizing himself with the scent of the house. He smelled his mother's sharp and spicy cinnamon scent. His Aunt Andromeda's breezy and lavender scent. He even smelled the scent of formula milk and clean linen from his tiny cousin, Teddy, but the scent he wanted was frustratingly absent and yet everywhere at the same time. He clenched his teeth trying to prevent a snarl. It was like every scent clunge to Hari; scents from the garden, the smell of freshly turned soil, and the smell of sunlight on his skin radiated throughout the house, with the underlying smell of fresh clean snow.
They didn't even believe in birthday wishes or Christmas miracles. Santa Claus and the tooth-fairy, dragons and unicorns, or elves and fairies, were all simply children's fantasies, pretend, and make believe.
Tired of sitting, Narcissa was pacing the small and cramped room. The cot was currently occupied by her son, in much need of sleep after another round of intense questioning by the Aurors. The questioning was ruthless, the Aurors digging for every detail portraying to Death Eaters waiting to be tried, or possible locations for those in hiding. The first thing Draco did was relay information for spies in the Ministry of Magic; he didn’t want his mother and he assassinated in their sleep, thank you very much. Then he gave access to Malfoy’s Manor, with himself tagging along, of course; to take out all dark artifacts. It had been a grueling ordeal, any discomforts ignored in the whirlwind of information gathering.
Dudley looked awkwardly between them. He didn't think the kiss was too risqué, he's seen couples snogging on the streets all the time. That little chaste kiss was nothing. A chaste kiss that was between two boys.  "You're together, together?" Dudley asked pointing a finger between Draco and Hari.
If Hari had clothes made of material like this, he’d never go back to rough denim, scratchy shirts, or threadbare clothes ever again.
“It’s time to go, Petit Dragon.” Narcissa said as she gently led her son to the two graves, picking up first one handful of dirt and then another, she loosened her fingers over each grave. Draco, following his mother’s lead, grabbed his own handfuls and watched as the last particles of dirt fluttered to the ground, soundlessly putting the boys he once knew to rest. And thought, ‘It was my job to make sure you two finished school, and now because you loyally followed me, neither one of you would ever finish. I’m sorry. Goodbye.’
“I have nothing to say to defend myself,” Narcissa began, “I am the wife of a Death Eater, this very man before you now. I lived in his house, Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire. I did everything I could to please him, trying to be a perfect wife. I gave birth to his heir, my only child, also here before you. I hosted elaborate parties and joined my husband, as is my duty, in all his social gatherings and yes, those included Death Eater meetings. After my husband’s arrest when he broke into the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic, he left me and my son defenseless in our own home, because the Dark Lord made the Manor headquarters. We no longer felt safe in our own home and were being held hostage there.” Narcissa paused there, to add dramatics to her story or to clear the lump in her throat, Draco had no idea. But then she spoke again, and Draco was sure he couldn’t speak even if given the chance. His mother was using her testimony to defend him.
Hari was not yet aware of his audience as he relieved his bladder first thing in the morning. He didn't bother with his glasses first thing, and was still a bit drowsy and disoriented perhaps because of it and a bit sleepy yet. It wasn't until he was washing his hands that he opened his eyes after letting out an enormous yawn, that he saw his blurry reflection through fogged up mirror and noticed the warmth from steamy air.  His eyes went wide. Reflected in the foggy mirror behind him, over a waist high divide that separated the bathing area from the toilet and sink, was the blurry outline of tense muscular shoulders and platinum blond hair of Draco Malfoy. Startled he cursed, apologizing profoundly and hastily turned off the water, using the hand towel next to him to dry wet and still slightly soapy hands.
Draco rested his pointy chin over Hari’s head, and mused quietly to the boy in his arms. “Huh, the killing curse...but you know love, you can’t
Was he imagining it, or did his pillow smell like Draco as well. It was soothing. Eyes heavy with the events of the day, a smile graced his lips in sleep
His mother was the one who gave him this journal, over ten years ago. He was seven and he wanted to purchase a book, about every child's hero,
"I uh...er...Yes," Snapping out of his stupor, "you are correct. If Andromeda wasn't disowned when she married a muggle-born, she would have been entitled to her inheritance. I would like to give what is due to her back, as the grandmother of my godson, she must be taken care of financially. I'd like to assume her debts and pay them off in full, if I am able to...Chieftess." He tacked on at the end, not wanting to sound insufferable. "And awe..Teddy Bear here, I would like to make my heir, if that is possible. I mean Sirius was able to do so with me, and Teddy is my godson, can't I do the same?"
Stepping up off the street, Harry watched as magically 11 and 13 Grimmauld Place were shoved out of the way and a five story townhouse, with soot covered brick walls, and moth eaten curtains appeared out of thin air.
Harry needed to run, survive, and outlast the snatchers, Death Eaters, and Ministry of Magic under Death Eater Regime, so that they could finish the task Dumbledore left them, find and destroy the Horcruxes. Sometimes, Harry resented Dumbledore, he didn’t tell him so many things, lied to him about his parents death, the prophecy, that he was the last Horcrux. All of Harry’s life was a lie. Harry never felt like a hero or a savior that they made him out to be. He felt like a fraud but people worshiped and fawned over him.
reigned in his desire, before he could do anything more than touch. It is a very good thing that Hari was not yet of age. Who knows what he would have done otherwise...That was a lie. Of course he knew what he would have done. He was fantasizing about it moments ago. Angry and disgusted with himself, he paced the length of the room. He couldn't let his dragon, his alpha instincts win. He didn't want to lose Hari again.
He usually had a level headed Hermione to try and talk sense into him, or Ron to have his back when he did make utterly ridiculous decisions. Regardless of what actions he took, Hermione still came along for the ride, if only to say 'I told you so' when things went to hell.
Potter was only wearing half his uniform; gray trousers, white button down shirt, and Gryffindor scarlet and yellow tie sans gray blazer with school emblem and robes. His shirt had already ridden up his slender waist and Draco noted he missed a loop three buttons down. Deciding to remedy the situation, Draco nimbly undid the rest of his buttons. He then slowly glided his hands up Potter's torso, opening Potter’s shirt from narrow hips and slender waist, all the way up his ribcage, over the smooth skin of his chest, brushing his thumbs over brown nipples on the ascend, to rest at the loosely knotted tie at his throat. Deciding to leave Potter’s tie where it was for now, he pulling his own tie over his head, and grasped first one slender wrist, then the other and swiftly secured his tie around Potter’s wrists. With Draco straddling his hips and hands tied above his head, Draco believed he had Potter adequately pinned beneath him.
Draco cast another wordless jinx that caused the trash bin behind Potter to explode. Potter retaliated with his own wordless hex which ricocheting off the wall behind Draco’s head, narrowly missing his ear, and caused the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle to explode. Water sprayed everywhere, instantaneously soaking the two duelists, and poured onto the tiled floor. Potter went to cast yet another curse “SECTUM…” and slipped on the slick tiles.
bins. "Your wrong about not deserving help. Severus Snape was a great man, a brave man, and he loved so deeply, he betrayed his beliefs, killed and in the end died to protect it. If I ever have a son, I'd honor his memory in him." Hari said with absolute conviction.
They were ever too pleased to find another Brit in Sydney on an extended holiday. It is rather all bitter-sweet getting to know Mrs. and Mr. Wendell Wilkens. I couldn’t give them my real name. So I gave them the name Emma.

There is no vaccine. It is not an issue of finding the code and plugging it into the strands of flu we have vaccines for. We were able to do this with the Swine flu ten years ago, it wont be the case for the coronavirus, it is a different micro-monster than that.
"Harry, it is you!" Cho said. "It is so good to see you." She leaned over and hugged him. That snapped him out of his daze.
the excess water, but he then manually worked with his hands in the soil and roots of the plants. Draco was amused to note that Hari simply plopped upturned grass right-side-up in the hole they had made during their skirmish. The moon had risen to clear the tree tops of their secret garden in the middle of the city. When Hari finally went inside, Draco assumed to clean up and get ready for bed, he stayed in the windowsill.
Hari blinked out of the trance he was in, magic still singing in his blood. He looked down at Draco, brain trying to put two and two together in his head. Draco smirked up in satisfaction from his half reclined position. One elbow held his torso off the bed and the other kept Hari at a distance. Hari sat back sheepishly. He hadn’t realized he was crowding Draco.
Hari didn't know what to say at first. He took a slower sip of his own drink, brooding. "I also was beaten by my relatives." Hari revealed. It was something that only a few close people of his new about, but never did anything about it.
, which prevents Wizardkind from discussing or revealing their physical manifestation of their creatures’ inheritance to Muggles or outside the family bloodline or legal guardianship rights. If his aunt was on the Sanctioned Muggle list, his aunt could have informed him. But if she never told Hari that he was a wizard then it was highly unlikely she also told him he may not be entirely wizard either. This left it to his Godfather, Sirius Black, to inform him of that fact before his eighteenth birthday.
“Blood of my life.” Hari croaked out. Misty red vines floated around his hand and up his arm, where Hari touched Teddy, they wrapped around his tiny body. For a moment he was afraid they would harm Teddy as they constricted off and on his own arms. But Teddy showed no signs of discomfort.
Draco's eyes widened in panic, before he slipped off the couch beside Hari and cupped his tear streaked cheeks. "Wha...why...shhh, shhh, no love." He shushed as his thumbs tried desperately to wipe away tears from eyes as they poured out. He didn't register the endearment and neither did Hari.
“Fine” Sherryl mumbled under her breath. When Hari said, ‘sorry, I didn’t catch that,’ she waved the boy over to her side. “I said, how about this. My place has a meal challenge. If you can eat the whole lot of it, no wasting food at my place, it’s free. If you can’t finish, you take it home for leftovers, and you as a special offer get to work off the price of the meal instead of paying, by working three hours in the back, sound like a deal?” She finished with that very tempting offer.
Minerva McGonagall, professor of Transfiguration for the past 35 years, Head of Gryffindor House, and current Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was livid. The focus of her ire, none other than Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the blithering imbecile, and current Headmaster of her school. The reason, the Hogwarts Book of Students Past, Present, and Yet To Come has just finished updating this years student attendees.
Officer Paul Sanderson opened the door and stepped into the heat of the bakery, just in time to see a black messy head streak through the archway in the backroom and a slamming of a heavy door in the distance.  He looked curiously at the baker, Nik.
Draco wasn’t delusional to place all his hopes and dreams on a one percent chance that Hari would present as omega, or that he would choose Draco as a mate, or even if the Wizarding World would allow him to even court The Hari Potter. Draco resigned himself to the fact that he would be the last of the Malfoy line, and thus it didn’t matter what Hari presented as, he would still put his whole heart into courting Hari. First he needed to get into his good gracious which meant putting up with Hari’s every whim. If that meant putting on Muggle clothes and going out into the Muggle world then so be it. He, as the Muggles put it, was truly on his way to becoming whipped.
Bill’s eyes were twinkling in humor. “Is there anything else you would like to add?” Bill asked, completely taken in by these two.
Yet, Harry hesitated taking the last steps across the street. At the moment Grimmauld Place meant sanctuary but It also was the house Sirius Black loathed.
And because, thinking rational for once, he wouldn't want that, and he really did want to spend more time with Hari outside his rut-infested mind, that is.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
Mrs. Malfoy went to Professor Snape in what she believed was a dire hour in her life. In June of 1995, after the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Lucius Malfoy was captured and sent to Azkaban. In ire, Voldemort summoned what remained of his Death Eaters and conducted an initiation. Some of this information comes from the connection between our minds and the rest came from memories bestowed to me by Professor Snape. Draco Malfoy was given the Dark Mark and told to in order to finish his initiation he would have to kill Professor Albus Dumbledore before the end of term at all costs. It was presented to Draco Malfoy as a great honor, but Mrs. Malfoy saw the initiation for what it was, a punishment for his father’s failure, a death sentence.
Hari heard the softly muttered words, but chose to ignore them as he raised the kickstand. He then instructed Draco where to keep his feet and hands while in motion. Draco wobbled a little and clutched tight to Hari’s shirt when Hari suddenly jumped up to kick-start the engine with a mighty roar. Draco didn’t know he was praying to every god he could think of, when the engine started and they wobbly started around the side of shed. As they exited through the brick wall that shimmered like going through a smoke screen Hari flicked down the visor that just fit over his glasses. Draco held on tighter as they maneuvered slowly down the back alley, the width little more than a one car lane dipped in the center to allow drainage.
