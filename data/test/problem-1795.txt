“She is already waiting for you, down the hallway, second door to the left,” she replied before going back to her work not giving them another glance.
Well that was it for now. Hope you liked it, let me know.
“You and Severus will also be going to the ministry by the end of the week to look into your home situation and to see if your relatives are fit to keep custody over you.” Said Serena. “If you have no more questions, you can go and start on your holiday homework. After lunch, Severus will start your first lessons.”
“You will also be expected to behave according to someone of your status, which means no more pity insults and stupid school rivalries. You will be respectful towards everyone, there will be no shouting and you will have to control your anger. I am also aware that your school grades in most of your classes are average at best. This will need to be improved, this is your OWL year and if you don’t score well enough at the end of the year a lot of courses will no longer be available to you next year. If you have any trouble with any coursework you let us know and we will make sure it is no longer a problem.”
Feeling the sad mood that Harry was going to Ryan quickly tried to change the subject, “So what do you think Uncle Lucius will have bought me this year?” he questioned looking at Ethan.
As usual, the Great Hall was nicely lit and people could see the stars through the roof. Harry and his friends quickly seated themselves at the Gryffindor table.
“When I came home from Hogwarts they were afraid I was going to use magic on them so they left me alone. But halfway through they found out that I cannot use magic outside Hogwarts. After that my uncle put up bars in front of my window and locks on my door. My aunt would give me a soup can a day through the flap door and let me out to use the bathroom once a day.”
Ron was about to say something when the doors of their compartment slid open. It was Malfoy standing at the door. Surprisingly, Crabbe and Goyle were not behind him for a change.
“Well, uh, um, Luna and uh, um…” “Ryan how come you haven’t made any friends? Are you concerned about something?” asked Snape, really concerned now.
“My guardians are muggles and I have never received any owls” Harry stated depressed. Well, this was excluding the owls he got from the Weasleys, Hermione, and Dumbledore. Oh, and he did receive a notification about underage magic once. Now thinking about it, Harry did wonder why he had never received any fan mail while growing up. He was after all the boy-who-lived and even though he hated it many people kissed the ground he walked on.
“Well, they are … Wait you have no idea what I am talking about?” Neville exclaimed. Could Harry really have no idea what he was talking about? But, but, that was illegal. How could someone do this?
“Ryan, come here” said Snape, taking Ryan into his arms and putting him on his lap hugging him closely.
Professor McGonagall went to stand in the front and before she opened her scroll she said: “Please make him feel welcome.”
Chapter 4: Dinner
At the end of the hallway, a lady was sitting doing a huge amount of paperwork with one of the magical quills. She was medium build with blue eyes and dirty blond hair that curled over her back. She was probably somewhere in her twenties and Harry assumed she was trying to work her way up by starting in the front office.
Reading the letter a few times, Harry was glad that Sirius was still on his side. Opening his present he was happy to see that it was a communication mirror. He assumed that Sirius mus have the other one. Deciding to call tomorrow after the ball, he put away the present and letter. He was a little worried about why he had not received any letters while at Hogwarts but decided to ask Severus later.
"No thank you."
“Ryan, look at me. Tell me the truth?” asked Snape really concerned.
"See you on September first." dismissed Albus, twinkle now gone.
“Sure, why not,” said Harry taking a seat next to them.
“Wait but I am not related to Sirius,” Harry said, suddenly realizing that fact. “How did I then receive the Black lordship?”
“I understand, so if I need to find the information I need to look in the correct section. Is there a specific order to the files in each section,” Harry wondered.
But even after this Harry still had quite a pile of presents and letters left. Deciding just to go for it, Harry saw that the next present had a letter attached, so decided to start with that.
“Of course Mr. Potter, that is absolutely no problem,” she said before conjuring some vials and handing them to Severus.
Sorry for the long wait, but college life was really busy these past weeks.
With a ‘pop’ both Harry and professor Snape arrived at the outskirts of a huge manor. Without saying anything professor Snape started walking towards the entrance of the manor. With no other choice, Harry followed a few steps behind.
“OK, bye guys! See you tomorrow.” said Ethan following his dad inside.
“You have to understand it was a dangerous and confusing time. I am sure it was just a small oversight.” Said Dumbledore, completely dismissing what happened.
“Hey Harry, you want to join us?” Ryan said.
‘So that’s how it feels to have a father’ thought Harry.
But the best present was surprisingly from Draco. Harry did not really expect a huge present from him, so was not surprised to receive a small box. Opening it, Harry saw how amazing it was. It was the snitch used at the World Cup last year, signed by both seekers. Harry honestly could not believe Draco would give it to him as a present and not keep it himself. But not looking a gift horse in the face, Harry just thanked him.
“Well, that does not surprise me knowing Lord Black is your godfather. According to my mother, he was almost more excited when you were born than the late Lord Potter.” Draco agreed, easily. To outsiders, it would seem like both were having quite a nice conversation.
Seeing Harry’s inner debate Severus stated “I understand that you and Draco have your issues, but I will be expecting the utmost behavior from both of you. Draco will have also been made aware that your childish rivalry will not be tolerated.”
"All private business of my professors concerns me" Albus said, getting angrier that no one was telling him what he wanted to know.
Severus had told him that child abuse was almost non-existent in the wizarding world. Since having many children was often hard due to magic restraints children were very precious. As the parents share magic with the child during pregnancy, the more children the fewer magic available for the next children. That’s why the oldest is preferably male, as they normally have the strongest magic and are the heir.
Seeing Harry had done what he was told, Severus started to lay Harry back down so he could leave when he felt a hand reach out to him. Looking at Harry, Harry mumbled, “Please don’t leave”
“This unicorn is the only female in the group. She is also the mother of the 2 little ones.” Said Professor Moonlight pointing to the unicorn closes to the smaller ones.
For the most time, the Dursleys rarely touched him. Yes, they took away food and he was locked inside his room a lot, but that was only for the summer months. While he definitely did not want to go back, he was not expecting such a severe reaction to what had happened to him.
Turning to the last contract in the file Harry exclaimed shocked, “Marriage contract!?”
Just like every year, during the summer, Severus Snape was walking towards the staff meeting. ‘The big oaf is late again’ he thought while sitting down next to Minerva McGonagall. ‘I hope this meeting does not take forever’
“Ok, Harry I will be calling a house-elf so don’t panic.” Said Severus before calling “Twinkle”
“Can we do that? I just want to make sure that there is no way I will be forced to marry her.”
“Are you telling me that someone left a one-year-old on a doorstep?” exclaimed Mdm. Hawks. “This will be added to your file and we will be investigating who did this.”
“Look, mister Potter, Mdm. Longbottom is not qualified to have the guardianship over you. She is not a lord herself and has no direct relation to you. Mister Black is still a wanted criminal and even if cleared will need to undergo possible years of mental treatment before he even comes close to being cleared to gain guardianship over anyone. Mister Lupin is not allowed because of his status as werewolf and Mrs. and Mr. Longbottom are currently in St. Mungo's. Since Lord Prince-Snape is the next person in line in your parent's will, he receives preference. He is the current Lord Prince and as such has the ability and qualifications to guide you in your future duties as a lord yourself.” Ripclaw interfered trying to explain to mister Potter that this was the best solution.
Taking out the next file “This is quite an important file Harry as this concerns any and all contracts made by the Potter family. It is important for us to go through them one by one, so we know if you have any contractual obligations.”
“I have no idea Harry. But don’t worry after everything is cleared up today we will be sending all of this to Ministry so they can start an investigation in everything that is going on” Mdm. Longbottom said reassuringly. It was illegal to ignore a parent’s will. She is so glad now that she is still alive to give Neville the life he deserved. Just imagining someone ignoring Franks and Alice’s will is a horrifying thought. And it turned out that Peter Pettigrew was the secret keeper and not Sirius Black? This would mean that an innocent man spend 14 years in Azkaban, the horror! She would make sure a trial was organized as soon as possible to clear this all up.
“Enter,” called Severus when someone knocked on the door of his office.
Feeling the uncomfortable silence that had fallen in the room, Draco decided it was time to change the subject. “So I heard that uncle Sev might adopt you?”
“We really enjoyed dinner professor Moonlight.” said Luna.
Rewrite as of 2020. The original story was of 2015.
In case you only have one male child this child, just like you will inherit all three lordships. If for a period of 7 years lordships stay together the lord will then have the possibility to merge the lordships.”
Laughing at the letter from the twins, Harry decided to quickly hide the products they had sent them before Severus or Serena decided to take them. A sudden thought popped in his head that it would be quite fun to use some tonight but luckily his etiquette lessons payed off and Harry decided against it.
Opening one of the doors professor Snape explained “This will be your room for the remainder of your stay here. As you can see at the moment the room has not been decorated yet, Serena will probably take you shopping sometime during the next few weeks to get whatever you need. Through that door you will also find your own bathroom,” said Professor Snape while pointing at the door on the left side of the room.
“Thank you for letting me stay here,” he quietly said in the direction of Serena and Severus.
“Mr. Potter I have heard that you and your friend, Miss. Lovegood, are friends with my son Ethan. Because of that my husband and I would like to invite you two to have dinner with us next week Saturday. Would you want to come?” asked Professor Moonlight.
After Ethan, it was Harry’s turn to receive his presents. He got a wand holster and new Quidditch gear from Ethan and Ryan. Narcissa and Lucius gave him beautiful wizarding robes and a book “Light, dark, or just magic?”. Severus and Serena had given him a 2-month subscription to see his favorite Quidditch team play the whole summer.
“Yeah, just extremely confused. Malfoy mentioned something about me being a lord and something about not showing up this summer. Any idea what he is talking about?” Harry asked nervously. During his walk-up it went through Harry’s thoughts that maybe Malfoy had made the whole thing up, just to confuse him more. But then again, thinking about the way Malfoy said it, it sounded too real. For one minute he thought about just asking Ron, but he could already imagine his reaction. He would probably go on a tirade about how awful Malfoy is and never get an answer. Plus Neville is a pureblood even though Harry often forgets this.
“I still want to break this contract immediately if this is about me,” stated Harry stubbornly, looking back down to read through the contract.
The morning of the 24th of December found a very nervous Harry at the breakfast table. After reading the paper the day before, he was surprised that he had yet to receive any mail from the Order. He had suspected the Weasleys and Dumbledore to at least send him an owl asking where he was. On the other hand, maybe they suspected that Harry was staying with Neville for the holidays. One thing Harry was sure of, is that he would probably be called to Dumbledore’s office when he arrived back at Hogwarts.
“Boris, David.”
” suddenly appeared. Looking up he saw Ripclaw smiling.
“Have you met Malfoy?” exclaimed Harry.
“Watch were you are going” exclaimed Draco Malfoy. Studying full time for his OWLs and his heir training had taken a lot out of him. And now Potter could not look were he was walking. He almost caused all of his homework to fly around, imagine having to start all over again.
"We have a problem." said Albus Dumbledore, without twinkle in his eyes and with a sad tone. “After many complaints the past year the Ministry has decided to investigate the full staff. This has sadly let to me having to let Hagrid go from his position as teacher of Care of Magical Creatures. Since Hagrid never graduated from Hogwarts, he was deemed unqualified for teaching our students.
Severus did not answer this time.
There will be another section on properties, in Britain and abroad. For each property, it will also state what the current state of the property is. This includes how many house-elves, the state of the wards, magical creatures that can be found, the size and state of the property, and so on.
“Does that mean I can take a holiday in one of these places this summer?” asked Harry excited. He had never been on holiday, let alone been outside the country.
When Hermione and Ron started talking again, Harry quickly dismissed the thought. The rest of the train ride went without a hitch.
I know it has been some time, but life gets sometimes in the way. I will be continuing, but the time between updates can sometimes be long. Sorry for this! I am graduating university and starting my first actual job in a couple of weeks, so it has difficult finding the time to write.
Seeing he could speak again Ripclaw stated “It is stated here that Albus Dumbledore is your magical guardian after the will reading of your parents.”
“No worries, let’s go to the Ministry, and then we can see how the Christmas holidays go.”
Chapter 3: first classes
Taking the offered hand, Harry corrected with a small smile on his face, “Well technically it is Heir Potter-Black”.
“Since we are limited in time, we will only be going through the Potter accounts today. Tomorrow you can test how much you understand, by going through the Black accounts by yourself. You should have enough knowledge after today to at least understand the majority of the information. I will be expecting a report tomorrow night of the Black accounts so I can review how much you understand and what areas we will need to go over again,” said Severus.
“Since you are too old to perform a blood adoption, neither yours or Ethan and Ryan’s inheritances will change. But Harry, why are you trying to come up with reasons why we should not do this?” said Severus, seeing what Harry was trying to do, “We would love you to be part of this family and that is not going to change no matter what you say. But, it is still your choice if you accept our offer or not. If not, other arrangements can be made, don’t worry, you will not be returning to the Dursleys if you say no.”
Not wanting to raise to the bait, Harry noticed that it was just him and Draco still standing in the receiving room. The others had probably already made their way to the informal sitting room. Turning around he quickly made his way there as well. Entering the sitting room everyone was already seated and looked up when they entered.
Just then Ron burst through the door, Hermione not far behind.
Reminding himself to look at this contract in the Black accounts, Harry looked at the next document and was happy to see it. It was the godfather contract between Sirius Black and himself. Reading it over Harry quickly noticed that it was quite standard. It mentioned that Sirius had to protect Harry at all costs, that in case something happened to his parents Sirius would take guardianship over him, and that in case Sirius did not provide a Black heir, Harry would take over the title and House. The contract also mentioned some specifics regarding Harry’s education and the time he should spend with Sirius.
After hearing this the only thing Harry could think of is that he will be spending 2 full days with the Malfoys. While he has never met Malfoy’s mother, he could only think she was the same as her family. He had been so lucky that he had been able to avoid Malfoy on those dinners in Hogwarts. Well, what was probably worse is that he would have to thank Malfoy. Without him, he would have never found out about what was going on. Oh, this is so frustrating!
Time flew by and on Saturday evening Harry made his way from the Gryffindor common room towards the Snape quarters. As you could probably guess, they were in the dungeons.
I am looking for a beta-writer. Not to actually do spelling and so, but to help me with some decisions and dialogues. Sometimes I can get stuck (as I was here), as to how everything should go.
“Harry, I am not asking you to be best friends with her or to have a do-over. Once you have sent your apology and miss Patil has responded, there is nothing tying you to each other,” explained Serena.
One hour later found Harry anxiously entering the dining room. While he did have several meals with the Snape family at Hogwarts this was a completely different situation. First of all, he didn’t have other students or Luna by his side and secondly, he was now also living with the Snape’s for the next three weeks.
“While you are not able to permanently live in these places till you reach your majority, you can visit them or take a holiday there with parental permission,” Severus continued.
The whole interview lasted several hours. Harry was asked lots of different questions regarding his home life. While they were talking Harry could see that both Severus and Mdm. Hawks were angry with some of the things he was telling them. He honestly did not see what was so bad, it could have been a lot worse. It wasn’t like he was hit all the time or that he was touched in places he shouldn’t be.
“What are we waiting for?” asked a Hufflepuff.
“Yes, Dad is Draco’s godfather and Uncle Lucius is mine. Dad always tells us that they are brothers in anything but blood.” Said Ethan. “Why would them coming over be a problem?”
“All seems to be in order. Since you currently don’t have your keys and you don’t know who has them we would propose you to make use of our key renewal service. This means that for a small fee all your previous Gringotts keys will no longer be valid and new keys will be created, if you would be agreeable.” Without letting Harry answer, Mdm. Longbottom quickly replied “Yes, that would be preferred. Since mister Potter currently is not the owner of his keys, someone else has access to his vaults and that is unacceptable.”
“My name is Gornuk, what do you need of us today?” said the goblin entering the room after a few minutes.
"When did that happen?"
“No, I don’t know. And you should have received monthly bank statements from Gringotts” Neville stated, this was getting more horrifying every minute. How could Harry not have received his Gringotts statements? He knew for a fact that the Potters owned quite a few shared in many companies. While the bank statements are sent to the guardian (magical person) of a minor, once someone turns 14 they receive copies of the bank statements. His grandmother said that this was done as preparation for the summer classes before 5th year. It would ensure that everyone already had an idea of their funds and how official documents looked like so they could do more work with the real documents instead of some made-up ones.
Ethan was dressed in silver dress robes with a black trimming, which was the opposite of the dress robes that Severus was wearing for tonight. On his left chest side, Harry recognized the Prince emblem, showing that he was the Prince heir. The same emblem could be found on Severus’ dress robes, but then on the right side.
“Wait,” exclaimed Harry, pointing towards one of the investments, “I own 35% of the Daily Prophet?”
“You mean to say that someone besides you has your key? Wait here for a moment, I will be getting the Potter account manager who will be able to verify who you are.” Gornuk stated before leaving the room. Looking up at Mdm. Longbottom Harry could already see that she was getting worried.
Looking at the list there were at least 20 properties listed:
Opening the folder named “Potter-Peverell”, Severus started, “As you can see each bank statement will start with changes that have been made since the previous statement. The following documents will then be the unchanged parts. The unchanged parts are always divided in the same way, but for each account, the order might be different. This means that the same information will be found in both the Potter accounts and the Black accounts, but not necessarily in the same order.
“But what if she is just as bad as Snape?” said Ron.
Immediately shooting out of bed Severus made his way to the hallway. Running while following the screaming he was led to the room that Harry was sleeping in. Throwing open the door he could see that Harry was having an awful nightmare. Deciding that the only thing to do was to wake Harry up, Severus slowly made his way towards Harry’s bed.
“Thank you for the advice,” replied Harry. The offer that Severus had made before they left for the Ministry was still playing in his head.
Or do you not have a preference.
“Good to know you have come to your senses. Now, are you not supposed to direct me somewhere?” Trying to remind Harry of the proper protocol.
“Ok, then you can call me Luna.” She said standing to leave together with Ryan. Ethan was already gone, after saying goodbye to his parents.
“Magical guardian? I have never heard of one. Do you know who it is? And I have not received any owls besides some birthday presents from my friends.” Harry exclaimed. How is it possible that no one ever told him who his guardian was? Could this mean that he did not have to go back to the Dursleys? He really hoped so. But while some hope started to rise in Harry the feeling of betrayal also increased. It was impossible that Neville is the only one that knew about it. Ron and Hermione definitely also knew about this and never mentioned it. Maybe they just thought he already knew? He did not know, what he did know is that he would get to the bottom of this and everyone that hid this from him would pay.
“Harry don’t worry we will sort all of this out.” Neville stated. Harry was actually very surprised how confident and strong Neville sounded. Normally it was him that had to give courage to Neville, but it looked like this time it was he who needed the support offered. Seeing Neville’s owl fly away he just hoped that they would get their answers very soon.
“Heir Malfoy,” Harry said respectfully and quite nervously wringing his hand. If Serena had seen she would have given him a lecture about proper etiquette. Trying to make a good impression, Harry quickly remembered the sentences Serena had drilled into his head earlier today, “I wish to welcome you to our home”.
“As you might now there are two balls that you will be attending with us during the holidays.” Seeing the worried look starting to appear on Harry’s face Serena quickly added, “no worries, we will make sure you are fully prepared for them. The truth is that since you missed most balls during the summer you can’t afford to not attend. And normally the Longbottoms also attend if that makes you feel more comfortable.”
The next step happens when they reach the age of 15. They all are assigned a current lord or proxy to their house. In most cases this is a parent or grandparent. In case no one in the immediate family is available their magical guardian steps in. This also means that future lords have to have a lord as their magical guardian. During their training they are invited to observe the Wizengamot meetings whenever possible. More crucial are the 5 mandatory group sessions during the summer. These meetings will provide the standard knowledge about being a lord. More importantly this provides the perfect opportunity for youngsters to create business connections with each other away from the prejudices of Hogwarts. These meetings are also open to anyone who is to become lord of a British house, which means attendance of students not attending Hogwarts. These meetings are spread across a total of 3 years. While the ‘classes’ are separate, the interactions are not, allowing students to make acquaintances with 5 different age categories (including their own).
“But if they are considered extinct, why do we have to learn about them?” asked Dean.
“Fine, I will write it before dinner,” stated Harry feeling reprimanded by Serena.
“Can we open the presents now?” Ryan said trying to use some puppy eyes on Severus but due to his excitement that did not work.
“No, that will be all”
"Seeing as she is a high elf, and has studied magical creatures for half her life, yes"
When Harry showed up for breakfast the next morning, he was glad that no one mentioned what had happened that night. He did not think that he would have lived it down if Severus of Serena mentioned his moment of weakness. Today instead of doing homework in the morning it was decided that he would immediately start his etiquette lessons with Serena. He had a lot to catch up to and she thought it would take the entire day.
"Yes, here are all the relevant documents."
“NO!”, Harry said in a panic.
This let Harry to wonder about the adoption proposal he had received from Severus and Serena. He loved staying at the Snape’s and he got along quite well with both Ryan and Ethan. The difficult relationship between Severus and Harry had also almost completely disappeared. Severus had been a huge help on several different aspects. Harry had been receiving extra lessons to help him with potions. Who knew that he was doing the cutting, slicing, dicing, and so on wrong? Apparently, muggle raised students should have received an introductory book on wizarding basics, which should have explained this. It would have also mentioned some basic potions and the main interactions between herbs and potion ingredients. It was only after one hour of trying to teach Harry that Severus found out that Harry never received anything. This resulted in a mix of emotions, Severus was mad at Dumbledore for not providing this material to Harry, but also at himself for never realizing. Once Severus sat down with him to explain everything he should have known, his potion skills improved drastically. One thing was for sure; he would be able to get at least a decent score on his OWLs.
“Excuse me Ripclaw, but that must be wrong. I have only been aware of the wizarding world for the past 5 years. I know for a fact that I never entered my vault before that.” Harry exclaimed getting angry.
After replying to Neville’s letter Harry made his way to Ethan rooms. Entering the room, he saw both him and Ryan sitting together playing a game of Exploding-Snap.
"Why do we not know anything about that?"
Making sure she had everyone’s attention Serena announced, “I expect all of you to be ready and in the receiving room by five-thirty, tonight.” Seeing that all three boys had understood, both she and Severus stood up, leaving the boys behind at the breakfast table.
“That seems like a good idea. Do you think professor McGonagall is going to allow me to leave for the holidays on such short notice?” Harry asked getting worried that their plan would not be possible. He really wanted answers and currently Neville and his grandmother were the only ones that had them.
Looking at the schedule, “We have potions, DADA and spells with Slytherin.” whined Ron.
“Were you able to read through some of your bank statements?” asked Severus, while grabbing the original bank statements and laying them in front of him.
“Yes, that would be no problem,” confirmed Severus after reading the marriage contract again to make sure he did not miss anything. “If you want, we can send a request off to the goblins immediately to break the marriage contract. After they have approved our request, they will inform the Ministry department to finalize everything and to make sure any other possible marriage contracts between you and Ginny are broken.”
Opening the next letter he was glad to note it was from the twins.
“That is unusual,” stated Ripclaw while going through the documents. “I have here the confirmation that shortly after the elder Potters past away Albus Dumbledore read the wills. But, for some reason, I cannot find any documents stating that the wills were publically read. Since it is almost impossible we would have misplaced it, it seems we need to conclude that it was really never read” Ripclaw stated in shock. How could no one have noticed this before?
Further Mdm. Longbottom told me she would deliver your trunk when she arrived home, so it should be here any minute. During your stay here you can also address my wife and me as Serena and Severus. Make yourself comfortable and I will see you in an hour for dinner.” said Severus before leaving the room.
Taking it Harry said, “Nice to meet you too.”
You could see professor Snape struggling with answering that one, but he still said: “Even then, because I know you Ryan and I know who you are and your house is not going to change that.”
“It is quite simple, you need to place one drop of your blood on this paper and then tap it once with your wand,” Ripclaw explained handing over the paper. Taking it Harry did what was asked. This time it took almost 5 minutes before something started to appear on the paper.
Rushing in Harry made his way towards the living room.
Both Severus and Harry handed over their wands before getting it back less than a minute later.
Do you prefer male pregnancy (only for creatures) or do you prefer a surrogate. This means that the ‘genetics and magic’ of both males are combined. The first 4 months baby develops in a ‘lab’, after it is transferred in a surrogate for the final ‘5 months’. This is from both sides unanimous and thus is as no link between the two (not even paper trail). PS: the surrogate is a voluntary job and only allowed for 2 pregnancies.
"Do you have any proof of your qualifications for the subject?"
“This is all mine?” he asked perplexed.
“Well, you are a lord. And this summer there were the heir classes. I honestly was surprised not to see you there.” Neville told him sounding a bit unsure. Why would Harry ask him about this now? They had been in school for almost have the year and Harry never mentioned anything about it. But then the way he asked it almost sounded like he heard it for the first time. No, that is impossible. Every minor with a lord of heir title awaiting them was contacted by the Ministry concerning the summer meetings. Furthermore, his legal guardian should have informed him since he was 12 years old about his future. And just to be sure Gringotts has to inform every 13-year old, as they need to claim their heir rings.
He was glad that Luna and professor Moonlight would be there. That would probably ease some of the tension. Still, every time the words “dinner with Snape” went through his head, he wanted to run back to the Gryffindor common room.
She was an aged lady probably somewhere in her seventies. Her hair was in a grey bun, quite similar to professor McGonagall. Actually she reminded Harry of professor McGonagall. She had the same strict expression, but also the softness in her eyes, which gave Harry a calm feeling.
“No Ryan is second in line and as such can only inherit the Prince lordship except if Ethan, and his children, fall away. It works like this. The oldest child gets the lordship from his father in case the father has one. If the father has multiple lordships it depends on how they are qualified. Taking you for example. The Peverell and the Potter Lordship have been merged at one point in history and you will also receive the Black lordship. In case that you have 2 male children, the oldest one will get the Potter Lordship, which includes the Peverell lordship, and the second child will receive the Black lordship.”
Severus took hold of Harry’s shoulder before guiding him to the appropriate room. They both received a quick “enter” after Severus knocked on the door once.
“There is the Greengrass’ Yule ball and the Malfoy’s New Year ball. You will be seeing the Malfoys as well for Christmas as we always spend it together. To make it easier on you, they will be coming here this year.”
“Why has nobody ever heard of them before now?”
“That does make sense. So everything is done so that cases like me, inheriting 3 lordships of which one is merged, does not happen often.” Stated Harry.
“Serena, this is my letter,” Harry said, handing over his letter.
"I am not here today to answer personal questions."
Turning around Severus Snape approach Harry, “We are leaving now” he stated while turning around and walking towards the apparition point. “Please hold on to my arm and don’t let go. I will be apparating us home” Harry did as he was told and with a “pop” they were both gone.
“What the hell is your problem?” Harry exclaimed. He really wanted to know why Malfoy could not act normal. Why did he always feel the need to insult Harry’s friends? Well to tell you the truth he had not heard any insult towards Hermione these past years, so that’s that. Did no one realize that he is not the golden boy everyone thinks? He hated his fame and would give it all away if it would mean he got his parents back.
“Stop whining and just go, classes are about to start.” said Hermione.
Turning around Severus stated: “You are free to use most books in the library for your personal studies. But at the moment you are not yet allowed to touch any of the books in that section” stated Severus pointing at the last 6 shelves on the left side of the library. “There is an alarm spell placed on those books, so we will be notified if you try to take them.”
“Do not speak to me and keep your mouth shut about things that do not concern you, blood traitor. And Potter, keep this up and you will not know what hit you when you leave Hogwarts. Your ‘Boy Who Lived’ fame won’t last forever.” said Malfoy.
Overhearing the conversation that what going on between Harry and Ethan, Severus decided to interrupt, “Ethan I am sorry, but Harry will probably not have time to teach you much Quidditch these holidays.”
“It’s going great, I like the classes and the material is not too hard.” Said Ethan.
“If you want me to be like you bigoted Purebloods, that’s never going to happen. I am not like you.” said Harry.
Opening the file Harry only saw a total of six different contracts. The first three were general house alliance contracts. Recalling his readings Harry recalled that this meant that the alliance was valid for every member of the Potter house. Looking at the three files Harry could see that a similar structure was used.
Looking directly at Harry, Severus reminded him, “don’t forget that as you are a minor you can sue them when they write damaging and untrue things about you.”
“I will see how it goes if it is nothing I can just drop it next year.” said Harry standing to go to his next class.
Seeing as Ryan and Ethan had already started opening their presents with excitement, Harry started opening his presents that he had gotten from the Snapes. Opening several packages, Harry received some additional books on his heirships, a new wandholdster, several beautiful dress robes, some candy and quidditch tickets for this summer.
With a tap of her wand, a file appeared in front of her, that she opened before looking into it.
“You left him with muggles! Did you ever even check up on him?”
“That is true” Mdm. Longbottom said thinking about a possible solution. If no one appropriate was assigned, they would need to go to the Ministry. The ministry would then be allowed to appoint anyone that they found would qualify.
“This is really not normal Harry. If you have not been to the bank, how did you get money out for your school supplies?” Neville said trying to understand what was going on. He already dreaded the answer, he hoped it was not what he thought it was.
“I have no idea. I don’t see him anywhere, do you think maybe Malfoy was right and Hagrid was fired?” said Ron, also looking to the staff table.
The third reason is that they want to avoid the idea that a married couple has 2 lordships at the same time with 2 different people. This would bring opposing interests together and can create extra pressures on the marriage. It sometimes happens of course with male-couples, which is why in those cases it is advice to appoint one partner as a proxy to the others lordship.”
“What about your cousin? Was it only your aunt and uncle who hit you or did your cousin participate?”
This was the first time someone had ever held him after a nightmare. In Hogwarts he usually had silence spells up so the others barely noticed that he was having nightmares. And at the Dursleys, he would have been locked up without food and extra chores if he dared to wake them up during the night. This was the safest and loved he had felt in a very long time.
"Silence!" exclaimed Albus with a bang of his wand.
“And what was your aunt’s and or uncle’s reaction to what your cousin did?”
“With your permission mister Potter, we can do a preliminary hearing of the will. After this is all completed all receiving parties will then be invited for the official reading later this week” said Ripclaw looking expectantly at Harry.
If Harry was really honest with himself, he never gave sexuality a real thought. Besides the Cho and the Triwizard ball last year he never had the time to think about these things. He was always so busy with Voldemort and all the trouble that seemed to find him. And now thinking about it, Harry was not sure if he liked girls that much. Even last year with Cho, it felt more like an obligation or an expectation of him than something he really wanted to do.
Finally, the sorting ceremony ended and the food appeared on the table. Everyone immediately began to speculate about the two new people sitting on the staff table and who they were, but the topic that gained the most attention were the two Snapes who were just sorted.
“You mentioned that you had to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Can you tell me at what age this started? Was someone helping you?”
“So who wants to go first?” said Severus amused already knowing the answer.
“How is it, living with Snape being your father?” and so on.
Opening the file Harry could see that the Potter’s had been investing in a multitude of things over the years. Looking over the list he thought that the Quidditch related investments were probably done by his father in the short time he was the Potter Lord.
“Even if I was sorted in Gryffindor?” said Ryan smiling again.
Saying his goodbyes, Harry went to sleep with a better feeling than expected.
Not only was he worried about making good impressions, but he was also nervous about the presents he had gotten everyone. To be honest, he barely knew them, and due to safety reasons, he was only allowed to owl order them. This would be the first time he would get presents on Christmas Eve, as usually the presents are delivered on Christmas Day at Hogwarts. Harry had already sent off his presents for his friends, or what was left of them, by an owl.
Well that made it perfectly clear how Ron thought about him. Harry was still hurt by that fact that the letter did not ask him how he was at any point. It just went on and on about Harry needing to do what he said and contacting Dumbledore. One thing Harry knew for sure was that he was never turning to Dumbledore again and he was never going back to the Dursleys. Seeing that the present attached was candy, Harry decided to throw them away, not trusting Ron to not have spiked them with anything.
Sighing Severus said, “You are correct, your grandfather will not be joining us this year.”
“There’s another Snape? Does Snape have two children? I feel bad for them.” said Ron.
After hearing the will Harry was in shock. He was never supposed to go to the Dursleys? He could have had a good home where he would have been loved? He really wanted to know who had placed him with the Dursleys.
“Why are they only now going to Hogwarts?”
“Hufflepuff.”
Before they knew it, the adults had returned to the sitting room to start opening presents.
“What? I am sad it’s only the letters I can burn,” Harry stated neutrally before going to pick up his presents and going to his room. Dropping his presents on his bed Harry realised he forgot breakfast and decided to make his way back down.
“She is not allowed to deny you. As long as you are staying with an adult during the holidays the school has no say over you. No worries, if she for some reason does deny your request I am sure my grandmother will take it up with the school board.” Neville stated assured. There was no way that they could legally deny Harry to go spend the holidays at his place. One thing they knew for sure is that these holidays were going to get very interesting.
“One more announcement before we start class. Normally in your fifth year, the third year of this class, there are no theoretical classes, but I have read what you have done these past two years and you are behind. Because of this you have the possibility to either learn this on your own or come to the extra review class once a week. In there you will see what you should have seen these past 2 years at a rapid speed. Sign up sheets are posted in your common rooms.”
The rest of the evening went smoothly. One hour before curfew the Snapes decided to send the kids back to their common rooms.
It was three days later that found Harry going through a huge pile of paper. The previous day an owl had delivered his heir bank statements. He and Severus were planning on going through them in detail in an hour, but Severus had asked him to already go through them if he had some time. This would allow them to test his knowledge and focus on the areas he didn’t understand.
“Well, we thought because Harry is here and his occlumency is not good enough grandfather won’t be able to join us for Christmas Eve this year.”
"Yes, such a sweet girl. Was she not a year above you Severus?" asked McGonagall.
“So have you made a lot of friends already?” asked professor Moonlight.
“Sure”
Looking up Harry saw that indeed Hagrid was not sitting at the staff table. More surprising Snape was talking to the new person sitting next to him.
“Could that be Snape’s son?” asked Harry.
By now Harry had blocked out the sorting ceremony, until suddenly professor McGonagall called: “Snape, Ryan”
“Of course mister Potter, now based on what you have told me for some reason you have not been receiving our owls. We would propose to have an enchantment test done to see if someone or something is blocking your mail.” Ripclaw proposed.
“Uhm, no…” Harry sighed, sitting down. He was feeling really depressed now. After almost 5 years in the wizarding world, he had hoped that he knew most general things. But here again, he was feeling like the small eleven year old that heard about magic for the first time.
But then the impossible happened. While he was talking Snape actually smiled! Snape had just smiled at someone.
“So how is it living with professor Snape?” asked Harry, after a moment of silence.
“Now to continue, while you were being seen to, I looked through your account records and as you probably know the monthly money transfer to your guardians is still going on, you have yearly taken money out of your vault for the past 8 years and again at the beginning of each school year.” Ripclaw continued.
“I will definitely do that,” stated Harry, before standing up and gathering all the files that were spread across Severus’ desk. “Thank you for helping me, I will see you at dinner?”
Getting the go ahead both Ryan and Ethan jumped up and headed towards the family room at a fast paste, lords and heirs do not run of course. Deciding that presents looked more interesting Harry decided to follow and grab some breakfast afterwards.
“Harry, there is nothing wrong in asking someone just because you have to. It happens quite often that people ask dates just because it is required. The problem is how you went about it and how you then treated her,” started Serena, trying to get Harry to understand what he did wrong.
"Then what about my other son who is a third year?"
And before Harry knew it was time to go to bed, too tired to care much about what tomorrow would bring.
Nothing seemed to happen.
“Um, yeah some.” mumbled Ryan, like he was not so sure.
“Before we leave for the Ministry there were some things that I wanted to discuss with you. As you know, today the Ministry will look into your current guardians and they will then decide if they are unfit for you to stay with or if you need to go back.”
“And please call me Draco, after all, uncle Sev is my godfather.” Turning his head slightly, taking a small peek at Severus standing on the other side of the hallway.
Before Harry made his way back towards the castle, Professor Moonlight stopped him.
This made everyone think. They did like Care of Magical Creatures when it was not dangerous.
While awaiting the answer of his grandmother, Neville had taken it upon himself to introduce Harry to some basic ‘pureblood’ knowledge. One thing that had really surprised Harry was when Neville mentioned that most purebloods actually have some creature blood in them. This apparently results in many purebloods receiving a creature inheritance when they reach the age of 16. This would mean that everyone of their year, who has enough creature blood, would receive their inheritance this year. Neville told him that next semester many students would receive some extra days off around their birthday to accommodate this. Annoyingly Neville could not tell Harry if he would be receiving anything, as most families did not share this information with just anyone.
'Hagrid fired?' went through everyone’s mind. Well, it is not like we were not expecting this. There had been so many complaints and never had so many students ended up in the hospital. Plus there were no students continuing in the subject for the NEWT's, which is very unusual.
“Why didn’t you tell me about this?” asked Snape.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I wanted to keep them out of the war, but I do not think that will work any longer, seeing todays situation."
“This is very concerning” stated Ripclaw looking very worried. “Let's start from the beginning and make our way through everything as much as we can today. I hope you have no other appointments today as this will take some time.” Seeing no objections Ripclaw continued. “First of all mister Potter. Since you have no key on you, we will need to confirm who you are. Please place a drop of your blood on this paper.”
“I know I was rude, but I didn’t know I was. He just reminded me of my cousin and I reacted.”
"Now that we are all here we can start." Albus Dumbledore said standing up.
Having not expected that answer, Harry mumbled out, “Oh, ok,” a bit embarrassed and with a slight blush forming on his cheeks.
“It’s not like I wanted to go to the ball in the first place we were forced to go and I had to ask someone,” stated Harry trying to explain how he acted.
Walking down the hallway Harry remembered the dinners with the Snapes. There had been two more after the first one. In the beginning it was pretty awkward, but seeing as Professor Snape had not made any degrading comments it was not that bad. He also got to meet the youngest Snape boy, Ryan, who was shy. It took him and Luna talking to the Ravenclaws, for them to finally give him a chance. As a result, he now had some friends.
Seeing how nervous Harry was at the breakfast table, Serena decided to take his mind off things. “Harry, your dress robes for the next few days have been delivered this morning,” Serena declared, making Harry jump out of his thoughts.
“To allow the will to be read, you need to place a drop of your blood on it mister Potter” stated Ripclaw handing Harry a thick piece of paper. Placing a drop of his blood on the will, it opened up and an image of James and Lily Potter was projected.
“We shall see. I hope you have learned which wizarding families are better than others,” Repeating the statement he made in their first year.
‘When did she get an inheritance?’ went through his mind.
Anyone interested, let me know in the comments. (or contact me through PM on fanfiction.net (twinia1))
“Yes!” Ethan exclaimed, “We can play Quidditch when we have free in the afternoon and then you can show me those great moves you have. You are after all the youngest seeker in a century”
(See the end of the chapter for
"And how would you know her?" asked McGonagall.
Narcissa received some expensive dresses and Harry had gotten Lucius some expensive Fire Whiskey.
“Do you mind if we sat down?” asked Luna.
Opening the next section labeled “properties” Harry was shocked.
“That’s because Draco had dinner with us at a different time. Mom and dad don’t like it when there are to many children over at the same time,” explained Ethan, “and didn’t dad tell you that you need to stop your rivalry?”
"Are you certain she is qualified?" asked Minerva McGonagall.
This morning he was sitting at breakfast, eating Mrs. Weasley’s food that was by no means up to the standard he was used to as a child. But Sirius decided not to complain as an angry Mrs. Weasley would ruin his day and it was an improvement of the Azkaban dining. Hearing a ticking on the window Sirius stood up to pay the owl that had been delivering him the Daily Prophet every day. The Daily Prophet was his only connection to the outside world even if it sometimes slandered his godson. Seeing the front page, Sirius started reading while drinking the last of his coffee.
“I am a bit nervous about it. As you know veelas only have one mate to choose from. Even if it is someone that lies often closest to our tastes, you still never know.”
“Your welcome and outside of class you can call me Serena, Miss Lovegood. The same for you Mr. Potter.”
Harry looked up with terrified and sad eyes and murmured “a dreamless sleep, please”
“Yes, thank you for coming and I wish you all the best in life, Mr. Potter. Happy holidays,” Mdm Hawks replied before both Harry and Severus stood up and left.
Looking up to Mdm. Longbottom, Ripclaw was getting angrier the longer Harry talked.
“Why do people keep asking that?” said Ethan almost to himself. “He is like any other dad. I mean, he plays games with us, takes us flying, helps if we have any problems.”
Opening the file they both skipped the new changes section, as this information will also be in the specific sections. It would not be productive to go over things twice in the short amount of time they have. Both opened the first section labeled “vault statements”.
There are of course several cases of child abuse, but those were often in families were one of the parents were muggles. Not all muggles are bad of course, but many don’t understand the magic and don’t know how to deal with a child who has it. This often leads to cases of neglect and sometimes to severe abuse, where parents try to beat the magic out of them.
Sooner then Harry wanted he was standing right before the door of the Snape quarters. Taking a deep, deep breath he knocked on the door. Before Harry could run, the door was opened and standing there was professor Snape.
“Since it has been a busy and probably overwhelming day for you I will leave everything that will happen during the holidays for tomorrow. The only thing you need to be aware of now is that dinner will be served at 7 and breakfast at 8. In case you need any help you can call for Twinkle and she will assist you with anything you need.
“Harry, I know you mustn’t fully comprehend what you saw this evening. But sometimes who we truly are, is not who people think we are. That must probably be too complicated for you to fully understand.” said Severus closing the door.
"Do you have any idea what these conditions could be?" asked Albus.
Another section will be on contracts. This includes personal and house contracts. This can go from alliances, both personal and the entire house, to marriage contracts. This is also the section were the wills will end up, in case one is written.
“Stop calling them that!” replied Harry in anger. What was Malfoy's problem? Why did he feel the need to insult the Weasleys every time he mentioned them? Harry thought back on how nice Mrs. Weasley had been to take him in during the holiday. Even though they had little she always gave him presents and food. It was true that she often overwhelmed him and she wanted to control every aspect of his life, but it got him away from the Dursleys.
“It was fun, I learned a lot. I was even able to turn my teapot into a tortoise by the end of class.” said Ethan very exited.
“Mr. Potter, Miss Lovegood.” greeted Snape.
“Well thank you for dinner Serena, and you can also call me Harry. Goodnight professor Snape.”
I will be rewriting all the chapters. The main storyline stays the same, so no worries.
When they approached, she looked up, “name and purpose please.”
Arriving at Diagon Alley, Harry, Neville, and Mdm. Longbottom quickly made their way towards Gringotts. Mdm. Longbottom had made an appointment ahead of time, so they were directly led to one of the meeting rooms.
“So what would you eat on a normal day”
“Please bring me one of the dreamless sleep potions”
“Why are you not taking the class?”
Seeing they were done Severus Snape said. “I would also like a card to be made for Mister Potter” turning to Harry he explained, “This card is tied to your specific magical signature. It allows you to pay in both the muggle and wizarding world without always having to come here to withdraw money”. “Here is your card mister Potter,” Ripclaw said handing Harry a black and gold card. “It was a pleasure doing business with you, May your gold increase” greeted Ripclaw before another goblin escorted them to the entrance hall.
“Shhh, it's ok, you don’t have to talk about it. Calm down”
That night Harry went to bed after reading the first few chapters of his books and doing some meditation. The one thing he knew for sure is that clearing his mind was not his thing.
“Mr.” “Thomas”
Hoping the next letter and present were better Harry opened them.
“Won’t Harry’s parents have stated possible guardians in their will?” Neville suddenly said, thinking he might have found a solution.
Both the Weasleys and Dumbledore were at Grimmauld Place when the Daily Prophet was delivered at breakfast. The Weasley family, Hermione, and several Order members were staying at Grimmauld Place for the holidays. Let’s just say that Sirius was not happy when he found out that Harry would not be joining them. When asked why, Dumbledore told him that Harry was invited, but had preferred to stay the holidays with the Longbottoms. While Sirius knew Harry was friends with the Longbottom heir, he did wonder why Harry had not sent him an owl himself.
“Severus, Serena, so good to see you both. How have you been?” asked Mr. Malfoy happily, greeting both Severus and Serena.
“Did they finally realize how pathetic you are?” added Ron.
Looking back at her file Mdm. Hawks started her questioning, “Am I correct that you currently reside with a Mrs. and Mr. Dursley?”
Arriving at the dining table it was clear that Severus and Serena would have preferred to sleep another hour of two. Seeing Harry enter the dining room, Ryan jumped from his chair, almost knocking over his glass of orange juice in his excitement.
At the end of the questioning, Harry was also asked if he was willing to give them some memories since it would build a stronger case.
Seeing only encouraging looks from Neville and his grandmother, Harry decided to trust them. Cutting his finger with the knife offered he placed one drop of blood on the paper. Without warning the name “
“At least we only have Snape on Fridays.” said Harry.
“It is planned for tomorrow, I want you to be on your best behavior,” replied Severus, “We will first look into your guardian situation. Once that is handled we will have to check if no contracts have been made in your name that you need to honor.”
“In case you have 3 male children you as Lord will have the option to divide up the Peverell and Potter Lordship again and create two separate houses. The monetary details in case of a divide are already documented at Gringotts. In that case, the Peverell Lordship will be the most important one and go to your oldest. The Black will be the second most powerful and go to the second child and the Potter lordship will go to the third child. Of course, depending on how they have been managed over the years this order can change.
“Yeah, why not?” said Harry.
“I’m fine. I even made a new friend. Harry, I want to introduce you to my friend Ethan Snape. Ethan this is Harry Potter.” said Luna.
When Harry, Neville, and Mdm. Longbottom arrived back at the meeting room Severus Snape was already there. He was in a deep conversation with Ripclaw. Harry was hoping Ripclaw was explaining everything, as he really did not want to go through it all again.
Sorry for the delay, but I have been working so I did not have as much time as before.
PS: Let me know if you have some ideas for wizarding presents as my inspiration is currently lacking and I still have some birthdays and Christmases coming up. Also presents for the Snapes, Malfoys, or Harry’s friends welcome.
“Making food, mowing the lawn, gardening, painting the fence, cleaning the house”
“Yeah, I have known him my whole life. I personally think that after you apologize and act like you are supposed to he will at least be civil with you. He told me about your rejection in first year, and Harry, that was extremely rude. No wonder he doesn’t like you.”
“Well that was to be expected.” said Hermione.
“I, I will explain it to you inside. Now come on your mum wants to see you.” said Snape.
“Without your goons Malfoy?” said Harry, defending Ron.
You will find a section on vault statements. This is everything that can be found in each vault, this goes from the actual gold to items. These items can be almost anything, heirlooms, furniture, portraits, clothes, and so on.
The funny thing was that both Ethan and Ryan loved the Malfoys. They had known them their entire life. To make things worse Mr. Malfoy was Ethan’s godfather. The stories they had told him over the past week drew an entirely different picture of the Malfoy family. Harry hoped he would make a good impression since, according to Ethan, Malfoy had a lot of influence over his other peers. In other words, if he could gain the acceptance of Malfoy, there was a big chance the other heirs, and through them, their parents might accept them.
“But what about Ryan, will he not inherit anything?” Harry asked, shocked.
“Yes,” replied Severus before taking out some work he still needed to complete. Seeing he was no longer needed, Harry left the room, closing the door behind him. Doing a quick tempus Harry saw that it had taken them 3 hours to go through all the bank statements. Since it would be dinner in an hour, Harry decided to go put everything away and go find Ethan and Ryan to pass the time before dinner.
“I uh,…” mumbled Ryan again looking at his feet. It was clear that Ryan wasn’t going to answer the question.
Casting tempus, Harry reorganized his papers before standing up and going to Severus’ office. After knocking, he entered and sat down, laying out his papers in front of him.
After reading the letter Harry looked up, turning towards Severus.
“Mister Potter, we have received your file from Gringotts and let me be the first to apologize for what happened. The placing of orphaned children is the duty and the obligation of this department and sadly enough we failed you in that aspect,” Mdm Hawks said.
When Luna came in she joined in and they continued to play Exploding Snap for a while.
“You will learn about the golden unicorns the next 3 weeks.” said Professor Moonlight.
“Wands please,” was immediately called to the people standing after them in line.
“Ok if that’s true who are they?” asked Snape.
“I just want to say one more thing before you can all go off to your common rooms, to prevent speculation. Professor Moonlight and Professor Snape are married. For your convenience it was decided to call Professor Moonlight by her maiden name to prevent confusion.” said Professor McGonagall.
Seeing as Serena was not going to answer Albus and he really needed a replacement, he decided to get on with the interview. Maybe he could get more information when she was working in Hogwarts. As the saying goes: keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.
“Severus Snape-Prince, here for an appointment with Mdm. Hawks.”
“Thank you for coming Harry,” said Severus after they both took a seat.
Severus' first decision was to not touch Harry, as that would most likely scare him, but to call out to him. After calling Harry’s name multiple times and getting no result Severus had no other choice than to grab Harry to try and wake him up. Shaking Harry a few times did the trick and Harry woke up gasping for air.
“No clue, the Weasleys bought my school stuff this year” Harry shrugged, what was wrong with that. The first three times they just gave him the money so he could buy his things. And because of security reasons they bought all his things this year. It’s not like there is anything wrong with that is there?
“Aly, Margaux.”
“Serena Moonlight will be replacing him as your Care of Magical Creatures professor. For the rest, the same rules will apply as last year. The forbidden forest stays forbidden and please look at the list put up by Mr. Filch with all forbidden items.” said professor Dumbledore before sitting back down.
