Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.
They walked down the hall by this point, and Hades was staring at Persephone. She met his eye, “Yes?”
“There’s no proof, no evidence—no case,” Persephone told her. "Let's go."
“Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Death’s gifts.
Eyes turned to Persephone. She giggled, “I definitely have a crush on Suzie!” She nudged her and Susan giggled.
“Why does it kill you inside not knowing everything about a person?” He mused. She waited, staring at him. He finally met her eye. “What house do you think I’m in?”
No one knew if they were to take her seriously or not until she said, “Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up."
She didn’t sleep the first time she felt it—a distant noise outside her window in her dorm made her jerk awake. She felt her eyes sting like they did when she opened her eyes in chlorine water and for a moment a darkness infiltrated her vision. She was half-asleep so she didn’t panic and when her vision came back, she barely noticed it had been absent.
“Alright you may take your blindfolds off!” Sinistra called out and she did so and then her mouth dropped open in horror. This wasn’t happening! No! “Pansy, you and your partner will be third understudies after Cedric and Daphne. Congratulations to our duet partners! Everyone give a round!”
“The match…it’s made of wood and wood is a natural resource, and…and I’m trying to turn into a needle, a metal. So…so I’m turning a living material into a dead material…so I have to…to really want to change it?” She tried her best, smiling sheepishly at her poor wording.
They bought Persephone’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid had to just about drag her away from most of them but she ended up buying two books that looked like fictional stories, and few more (
Then she had a terrible thought that turned her stomach—Hades spent time at the Malfoy’s over the summer. And knowing the Malfoys, they probably only had pureblooded friends—the Greengrass family was most definitely pure-blooded. How much time had Hades and Daphne spent together over the summer? It was clear that Daphne knew Hades and Hades wasn’t at any point confused as to who Daphne was…
Who was she crying for? Her parents, the ones who wanted nothing to do with her? Of all the stupid things she could—she glared down at the letter and frowned. Did this make her a—what? Witch? A magician? How mediocre—she would much rather be doted to be a demigod.
“Hades, the deer is gone.”
“How do you know that?” She asked, feeling her sanity undoing.
Unable to push the feeling that she was leading her best friends into a trap that could result in them paying with their lives, she pushed the door open.
“We’re underground, Lily,” Ron told her slowly.
They made their way down under the invisibility cloak, trying not to trip over it. Despite Hermione being slightly taller than Persephone, the cloak still had a lot of unused parts, a whole train behind them. This proved to be a struggle when they came across Peeves, who was bouncing against the walls in the entrance hall. By the time they had gotten out of the castle and down to Hagrid’s hut, Hagrid had Norbert ready to go in a large crate.
She ignored him through the duration of the rehearsal, which mainly was running through lines and placements. Her only troubles were with one stupid line that she simply couldn’t get right—it wasn’t even a hard line! It was just one word she messed up over and over again!
“PROBABLY!?” She screeched. He winced, staring at her in annoyance. “That’s—”
Persephone’s shifted from despair to confusion.
“The Nutcracker, Dudley,” She grumbled at him.
She took a step forward, something that was characteristically stupid, and found that they did not move away. If anything, it leaned forward.
First, however slyly the poison tries to hide
"A witch, o' course, magicians don’t exist an’ I wouldn’ go around callin’ our folk magicians," Hagrid warned, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh respond to yer letter."
“How long have you been alone in what this is?” She asked quietly before immediately realizing that that was rude to ask. “Sorry.”
The stage director, Ryn, was slowly going mad. Persephone never saw him outside of the rehearsal room and when she did see him inside the rehearsal room, he looked more disheveled than the last time she’d seen him. She tried to remember he was more stressed than anyone but it was hard to do so when he kept snapping at her for being in the wrong place on stage. She hated and loved him.
She had higher hopes for this new school—no one knew her past of being a troublemaker and the wrong sort of girl. All they knew was that she had good grades. She was smart and she picked up things fast and didn’t need much help. Maybe this could help her move up a grade—or seven. Maybe she could graduate early. Then she would be able to go away to college and work until she could buy the Durlseys’ house and become their land lord and turn off their electronics randomly during the day. Or forbid any sort of flowers but aunt Petunia’s most hated flower, lilies. That sounded pretty good.
She was able to sit before she could faint and the ghost she sat opposite to patted her arm, and finally made her take a big breath at the sudden, horrible feeling she'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
"But—seeker!?" he cried. Persephone threw her hands up, gesturing for him to keep his voice down. “But—but first years never—you must be the youngest house player—”
“So….red for Gryffindor?” She said awkwardly.
“Er…” Persephone laughed nervously. Ben was standing next to Mr. Johnson, watching.
“If I don’t touch it,” She told her. She admired Hermione’s concern but if Hermione paid her any more attention, she could figure out her fishy problem and that wasn’t something she wanted.
!” She threw a chocolate frog at him. He caught it in his mouth and chewed the whole thing in his mouth. She groaned in disgust. He tried saying something but was muffled with the chocolate in his mouth.
On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Persephone. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Persephone was forced to stay in the house all day and in the living room under strict supervision from Uncle Vernon. When in the kitchen, under aunt Petunia’s supervision.
Dobby!” the elf choked. “Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a witch—like an equal—and to be asked by the great Persephone Potter…!”
you!”
McGonagall awarded her a rare smile, “Nonsense. You performed brilliant magic.”
And then, she became aware of her nerves, and the voice in her head continued, ‘
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be."
“Shut it, Potter!” He sneered but she shrugged.
“But that spell is several years too complicated for a first year.” Percy noted.
“Ready?” Persephone asked the two.
“How far!?” She gasped, nearly jogging after him.
She decided that would be another last resort, only because its stare killed.
He was hesitating, stepping forward, and surveying her extended hand. “I don’t—” She grabbed his hesitating hand and pulled him to her and he stumbled against the broom, inhaling sharply before stumbling backwards, “Meet you there?”
She rushed back to Potions class, swiftly telling Snape she was wet from sweat from the hot cauldrons, which he replied to, in great disinterest, “At least that means you are doing something correctly,” (As if she hadn’t been doing something correctly this entire time.)
“What is it?” She reached her hand out towards the mother. Benjamin had gone towards the baby and tossed it something—food?
. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something."
Grinning, she said, “I adore it.”
As soon as she was out of the water, she snapped into reality. She immediately started shivering and she snapped down to pick her robes up and throw them over her. She tossed her hair over the robes as for it not to touch her—and, “Woah! My hair!”
Hagrid looked at Persephone with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Persephone, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there was a feeling of guilt and shame in her chest. A witch, just like her mum and dad? How could her aunt Petunia make her believe that her parents were horrible? That they’d abandoned her? Why would she make her hate them, when all they were—when they were murdered? And someone had left her a letter explaining, too.
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door—and it was locked.
Diana was recounting tales on her sisters as they unfolded and re-folded. “…and despite the fact that I literally don’t know her, she acts like I killed that stupid, yapping dog of hers—which, I have thought about, being as it’s the most annoying thing,
"It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget things—this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red—oh..." His face fell, because his Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, "You've forgotten something..."
The white queen turned her blank face toward him.
She went to her room and after taking off her dress, heels makeup and jewelry, she placed the letters all down on the bed. She opened the letters first and found Hermione had written to her four times, Ron twelve (which was also how many times he asked her to come over and stay), Fred three times, George five times, Susan four, Cedric Diggory twice, Daphne twice, Diana three times (She was in France for the rest of the summer).
“Third year? He’s older?
“And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.”
"Very good," said Wood.
"How long does it take for you to read a book that small?” Persephone questioned—sure it looked big, but a few weeks to read it? Pathetic.
"Alas, I cannot answer either. Not today. Not now. You will know one day, I tell you this, but I advise you to put it from your mind for now, Persephone. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know."
Persephone spent time in the library with Susan and Daphne, each girl writing out test questions that could be on their exams at the end of the semester. They tested each other and made flash cards that they picked out at random from Persephone’s bag. Persephone had started writing up her review notes. She mostly needed to review for History of Magic and Herbology. She was sure she would do very, very well in her Charms, Transfiguration and Potions but she did more than the bare minimum, ignoring her ego.
Persephone sat up on the desk, which made her feet not touch the ground, with Madame Pomfrey standing by her, “Now, normally, there should be a little kick, alright? Just relax for me, dear.” Persephone did just that and Madame Pomfrey made a light hit just below her knee and, without meaning to, as Persephone had no control of her movements, her leg bounced forward, kicking the chair hard into the wall, breaking the wooden chair into its pieces.
She entered the greenhouse and almost immediately caused a whole ton of chaos. Something crashed to the floor at her feet and down went a boy as well, who cursed a very dirty curse. She cried out as soon as all this happened, not expecting this much chaos in the morning.
"Fred says the sorting hurts a lot,” Ron whispered to Persephone. “I think he was joking but I’m not sure.”
Percy (Not Jackson) the Prefect got up and shook her hand vigorously, while Fred yelled, "We got Potter! We got Potter!" By his side was George Weasley, clapping as well, clad in the same uniform.
He clapped his hands and immediately, instead of green and silver, the hangings became scarlet and gold—much better colors, if you ask Persephone. The giant Slytherin serpent crest vanished and its place was the towering Gryffindor lion crest. Snape was shaking hands with Professor McGonagall's hand, a horrible, forced smile evident on his face. He caught Persephone’s eyes only to look away quickly.
“No one would see—this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed—that’d get us up in the air—then we fly above the clouds. We’d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser—”
"Use the girl...Use the girl..."
“A…creature from…my world.”
"Oh, no, sir," Hagrid said quickly. Persephone noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. She entertained a theory of perhaps he’d done something different other than
He was still freaking out, though, basically ignoring Daphne to stare at Persephone, “I don’t even know what you’re supposed to wear! Tights!? SWEATS!? I DON’T FUCKING KNOW!?”
She would have, had someone not just said, “So—back again, Persephone?"
"I'm warning you, Malfoy—one more word—”
Bear with me, this one is a long one.
“I’m not grabbing you!” Hermione had finally leapt and struggled toward a damp wall, leaving Persephone to be tangled by…the plant?
“I don’t understand…” She was so tired. She checked her watch. It was well after midnight now. “I have to go…how do I get out of here, do you know?”
Ron’s ears went pink.
The stone wasn’t gone, however. If it either Snape or Quirrell, they both had yet to make a move. The latter, however, seem to be getting paler and thinner. It seemed almost like he had a disease that was sucking the life out of him—this made her suspicious. She started looking into vampires.
“Good evening, founders of Hogwarts,” She breathed as the paintings came alive. “I found your heir.” She told Slytherin.
"Then kill her, fool, and be done!" screeched Voldemort.
"Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleepily.
"You can kip under that," he said. "Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets."
She waited and presented the note to her once again. She narrowed her eyes over the paper, as if she hadn’t already analyzed it thoroughly. Finally, lifting her eyes to meet Persephone’s, she grinned almost evilly and held a bony finger up, indicating for her to wait.
The late afternoon was warming the city once more but nothing too spectacular—not after the day she’d just had. All through the short journey from Diagon Alley through the wall, back through the now empty Leaky Cauldron, she’d been unable to string her thoughts together, something very uncommon in her mind. Her usual observant eyes barely noticed the people gawking at them on the Underground, staring after them with their funny-shaped packages and the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Persephone’s lap, the cat meowing from her cage. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Persephone only registered where they were when Hagrid tapped her on the shoulder.
"I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape—look."
He pursed his lips, “Instincts—you can’t keep still because in the water, keeping still will end with you drowning.”
“I’m glad we have not had much contact,” Draco sighed. “He does not seem the Slytherin type. Pureblooded, yes, but worthy of Salazar Slytherin’s acceptance into his house? Absolutely not.”
"Oh please,” He sneered. “I'd take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. "But I won’t fight a little girl.”
she thought as she sighed, lying down in front of the passage, arms first. Her arms found something study, and she pulled herself in, sliding easily. My god, she was skinny. Standing up in the dark, she brushed herself off, coughing with the dust, before placing the book back in place. As she did that, sudden torches on the walls lurched to life, and warm light abused her eyes. She blinked heavily, her eyes adjusting to the sudden light and then found herself standing at the top of a staircase, torches lighting the path all the way down.
not a saying!” Fred pointed at her.
She knew who she was talking about—the boy with the cat that hated him. She couldn’t remember his name for the life of her.
She huffed and waited and then finally, someone’s fingers hooked under the blindfold and it was jetted of her head, no doubt making her hair a mess.
to disappoint the people with expectations. I hate disappointing people, or letting people down. I want to be good enough, as selfish as it sounds.”
The boy she’s spent a portion of her summer with, the boy who had been an outcast at Hogwarts—was a Malfoy? Or a Black? Or simply related to Draco Malfoy? What in the ever loving hell?
"I can't see anything." They all said in unison. “There’s only you,” George explained.
She looked up to see one of the red-haired twins approaching her, smiling goofily in greeting.
“Professor, I’ve got something to ask you,” She started, looking at him.
Persephone maintained her composure as Renee introduced all the girls to Persephone and then Persephone realized they were all pure-blooded girls. She saw the way the older girls, including Renee’s older sister, sized Persephone up.
"You'd like a
“That’s what you said for being
He glanced between the letter and her. “And you haven’t opened it? You’re a dance nut, open it!”
Somewhere to her right, a bird screeching, making Persephone nearly jump out of the tree. Ben reached out and caught her by the arm and she situated herself better. She caught only the last bit of Snape’s next sentence, "—your little bit of hocus-pocus. I'm waiting."
She was right—it was not just
“Holy shit,” Ben suddenly said, snapping his head to Diana. “Give me your phone!”
“The amount of times they did what?” Ron asked blank faced.
Thank you for reading!
"About once every ten years," said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.
Another long one... :/
She’d given Gryffindor a good start but it quickly went downhill when Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.
“Oh no,” Ron moaned, rolling his eyes.
“Er….Flitwick…?”
They passed into the entrance hall, where Persephone saw through a large doorway between the big staircases that people, funeral guests, had arrived beforehand and were mingling quietly with each other. Hades, however, led them away quickly, up the stairs.
The tension turned awkward after that and no one looked Persephone in the eye. She pulled her robes on, and waited while George and Fred finished and they walked out together, feeling relatively better.
"Welcome back, Mrs. Potter, welcome back."
“Sure, yeah,” She nodded and it was silent and she looked awkward around, still nodding her head before he said,
The decision, however, was over-ruled by the person who took pleasure in Persephone’s frustration—Draco Malfoy was walking down the narrow, dark street outside the shop.
“The oppression of women and girls is a tough sea to navigate but I’m sure we can find some books on feminism in Hogwarts to fight the internalized misogyny I have no doubt I probably have.” She pursed her lips. “And Hermione? Could you please not refer to traditionally feminine practices as ‘girly’. It makes it sound like it’s only for girls.”
"Yes, Uncle Vernon.” She said, still lost in her dream like train of thought—maybe she could put the mail slot in the back of the home, so the mailman would need to walk around aunt Petunia’s most cherished garden and destroy it in a week’s time.
Ron, wary, nodded.
When they came into view of the house, she saw three tall boys out throwing what looked like a Quidditch ball.
“She arrived this morning,” Mrs. Weasley cut him off, “When your sons flew that car to her house all the way to Surrey and back.”
‘Wow…that’s…wow.’
In her hands, she scooped up air, willing for the oxygen to fuel her magic up and a flame popped up in her hand. She raised a brow and inched closer to his portrait, “It’s a simple yes or no question and I find you are more than motivated to answer it, no?”
"Oh, very well," she said. "But five minutes
Persephone looked at him in surprise, “Because anxiety is caused by a sense of fear and when your body believes it is eating, it believes it is safe enough to eat and there is no danger, thus no fear, and lesser anxiety, yes, how did you know that?” She asked quickly.
They showed Persephone and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Persephone and Hermione thanked them profusely. Diana hung back towards Persephone and Persephone still was in shock, “So….you know Charlie then?”
“Duck!” Persephone screamed as Fred was too distracted by giving her a look of betrayal. He ducked just in time and George popped up,
Hogwarts for Persephone was incredibly unlike any school she’d ever gone to.
She pursed her lips. On the one hand, this was a literal stranger she was asking for help from, and owing a favor to. She did not trust him but…but he worked at Ollivanders and was the one to suggest the wand making thing. He must know what to do, right?
He shrugged, “We both die?”
Persephone smiled, “Well then I’m sure your grandfather will be pleased for your participation in celebrating the past and being so interested with your heritage.” She cocked her head to the side. “I do adore the vintage aesthetic of it. Oh wait—unless you’re…oh, what’s the word for it?” She snapped her fingers in a dramatic attempt to show she was thinking for the word.
"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. "My old house, you know."
Over her head came Dorothy’s main costume—a white blouse underneath an old fashioned plaid dress. The dress fil her perfectly though the blouse was too puffy.
Persephone bit her lip and Susan gasped, “Is it from a secret admirer? You must tell me!”
“Um, nowhere?”
“I could…break in?” She suggested. “I have bobby pins and this car is pretty old, so it would be easy.”
Persephone waited with impatience, debating on whether or not to just take the last drop of the smallest bottle and pitch herself into the fire to prove a point.
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.
As cold as it was this morning, she still wandered around. The grounds surrounding Hogwarts were very beautiful, especially in the morning. Today she started for the Black Lake. She knew Ben was supposed to get a siren hair as a core and that could only mean that Ben had to pay a visit to the lake. Perhaps, she mused on the unlikely possibility, she might run into him there.
“Birthday girl chooses who goes first,” Renee exclaimed, “Persephone?”
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that
As she kept staring at herself, she saw her image zone in and out, from a ballerina outfit, holding flowers, to her being Quidditch captain of the Slytherin team, winning the house cup. It always flickered back to her showing off her house colors in pride.
He walked and walked and walked and walked, until finally, she was set down on some cushion. Still with her arms crossed, she asked, “Can I take off my blindfold now?”
She pulled her hair up into a high ponytail and took her little pot of wand seeds. She was planning on heading down to the Herbology greenhouse—there was a pretty garden of color changing roses that she wanted a closer look at. And perhaps she could run into Professor Spout and ask her if she’d ever heard of wand seed growing.
Fred took just a pinch of the powder with his index finger and thumb and chucked the powder into the flames, and Persephone watched in amazement as the fire grew to be higher than Fred, an emerald green flame now. She briefly recalled the campfire in Percy Jackson before she gasped as Fred walked right into the green flames and shouted, “Diagon Alley!” and vanished.
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up in blue theme uniforms to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. Ravenclaw is blue—blue for intelligence and wisdom, no doubt.
"See you, girl!"
She thought for a moment, “Alright, let me ask you this. What house would you like to be in?” This said a lot about a person.
“Sirens can drown?”
Slowly, Dobby shook his head.
“Yea!”
“Of—of
“Ow, ow, ow, ow,” She whined, “Okay, yes, fine,”
She took a break from opening presents to deliver hers to her kitten. She poured him some food and tapped her wand on the other bowl for water. As he ate greedily, purring even louder, she placed a little bed by her own bed. She’d enchanted it to remain warm for a whole day—she’d just need to remember to re-enchant it every day. Salem would find it comfortable.
Ron caught on immediately, “Not surprising.”
She took a step back and almost bumped into another gargoyle. Her heart in her throat, she went around it, and didn’t take her eyes off either one until she was at the end of the aisle. Then she took off at a run.
"Bye-bye, Norbert!" Hagrid sobbed, as Persephone and Hermione made sure the invisibility cloak covered the entire crate and themselves. Good thing it was so big and long. "Mommy will never forget you!"
Seamus Finnigan in the front row let out a laugh. Lockhart took it for a scream of terror.
Rowena Ravenclaw gasped and Helga Hufflepuff sputtered while Godric Gryffindor roared, “Are you mad?”
“I got lost—the Floo powder—”
"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!" barked Percy.
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.
“No because you kicked Pansy Parkinson last year when you kicked your leg up.”
“Ah yes…” He read quietly the paper, which look rater unofficial, and glanced up at Persephone, who was trying to read the paper upside down. “A rather rare method of wand making but has always worked out…hmm…follow me, if you would, please.”
Soon enough, she was able to retrace her steps from the library, since they were so fresh in her memory, and finally, she recognized the narrow hallway. “Aha!” She whispered.
The second she put the thing to her chest, over her heart, the other circular thing on the desk started blinking, fast, with added vibration. A fast and slushy sound came out of it, filling the silence. Madame Pomfrey seemed panicked at this and looked at Persephone, “Are you alright dear? Are you feeling any pain in this arm, here?” When Persephone shook her head, Madame Pomfrey checked her eyes to make sure they weren’t ‘blown’ and then proceeded to made her regulate her breathing. When the heart pace didn’t change she tried it out on herself, only to find it working properly.
“No-maj?” She questioned.
He thought for a moment and then grinned a strange smile, “Way ahead of you.”
Harry makes a noise into the fabric of Draco’s sweater.
“And you, Harry? Any kids of your own?” She continues, part curiosity, part courtesy.
“We won’t let that happen.” Draco steps closer and in the light of the fireplace reflecting on his face, he looks like home.
“I only told you some, dear.” Dudley says with a hand on her forearm as if to stop her excitement.
McGonagall nods. “Very well.” She waves a hand and a letter from her desk flies up and through the window. “Their notice has been sent, you are to meet them this Saturday, at noon sharp. I’d advise apparating there to avoid commotion through the floo network.”
They stay like that, staring, for several seconds before Dudley breaks from his shock.
year he just grew even more bitter and resentful. He forbade us from even mentioning you or what had happened. He couldn’t even stand magic shows on the telly. In the end all that hate… It consumed him. And you were a victim of that.”
Harry gives the class a minute to settle, then stands behind his podium.
“No need to worry, miss Dursley, I just have a quick question for my forms here.” Harry points at the completely made up document in front of him. “I seem to miss your parents’ names? Headmistress McGonagall has failed to put them in.”
Draco doesn’t look at him as he keeps on comparing things and checking more stuff off the list. “Almost done, come in.”
“The one who used to live with you?”
Dudley gives a watery chuckle and Harry follows it.
The children all look at McGonagall as she brings in the very stool Harry had once sat on and hushed whispers pass through the line as she conjures up the list of names. Harry claps for every kid sorted into their respective house. Some get welcomed in by people they know, others shyly join their table under the applause of friends not yet made. Over ten years as a teacher, Harry is still filled with the same thrill every time during the opening ceremony.
------
“I’m going to need more than that, love.”
Maria disappears behind a corner and leaves Harry and Dudley alone again.
“Are you really Rose’s uncle?”
“Yes, so technically, yes. I am.”
Harry doesn’t miss their youth. Their youth is full of pain and loss and bad choices made for them. He likes them now, he likes how they’ve grown and learned better. He likes the crinkles around Draco’s eyes when he smiles and the calluses on his hands. They’re both beautiful as they are. And yet the sight sparks a flame of joy in Harry’s stomach all the same. Because it means Draco still has it in himself to feel that young nonetheless.
Draco bolts up from the bench he’d been sitting on the moment Harry appears five feet in front of him. Harry wastes no time walking into Draco’s arms and going boneless.
The street Harry lands on doesn’t look like Privet Drive. Which makes sense because of course he wasn’t going to Privet Drive, or in fact anywhere near Little Winging. And yet a part of him expected Dudley to live in a home that mirrored the house Harry spent the first 17 years of his life in. This street however is not full of uniform square houses with immaculate front lawns with grass mowed to precision. The street Harry finds himself on hosts a mismatched set of small, cosy looking houses, snuggled behind front gardens blooming with flowers and bushes. Doorsteps bathed in cool shade provided by big trees and windows alive with colourful curtains. It looks pleasant to live in. It reminds Harry of the house he and Draco own, small and bright yellow with a garden that blooms beautifully in the summer when they actually get to go back there.
Harry can’t begin to fathom what the things Dudley could have said about him are.
“No. I’m good.”
“Oh.” Holly almost looks surprised to have been addressed. “My name is Holly Dursley. And, um, I like… Superheroes?”
Harry wants to laugh. “Of course, professor. I won’t hex my cousin, if that’s what you’re worried about. My goal isn’t revenge, just Holly’s safety.”
“That is a great goal, Robert! I wish you luck. Next?”
She relaxes at that. “Maria and Dudley Dursley, sir.”
Harry swallows hard. “I can’t imagine they are dealing with the news well.”
“I’m making a list of the students who need new supplies. Wakeley’s cauldron is almost four years old, and one of the Hufflepuff kids’ sets was obviously put together by her parents. One leaf of a wrong plant in there could cause so much damage.” Draco rubs his temples. He’s a good teacher. He has seen the errors of his predecessors and is trying to be better. Harry is proud of him. He’s proud of both of them.
The class responds with a not-quite-cheerful but not bored either ‘good’. Good enough.
-------
Looking at the line of first year students slowly file into the Great Hall, eyes wide and full of wonder, amazement, and nervousness always makes Harry remember his first year. The world of magic opening up in front of him as the charmed ceiling’s candles flickered merrily above his head. He can almost always guess the muggleborn children in line, their eyes are always wider, their stance always more guarded. As he sits at the Teacher’s table he tries to make himself as welcoming as possible, smiling warmly at every pair of eyes that catch his. He smiles wider when he catches Rose’s eyes and she waves at him excitedly. He gives her a nod and manages not to wave back. She repeats the gesture several more times at the other teachers she knows and Hagrid almost knocks his drink over in his haste to return it.
And there it is. The question has lost some of its novelty, it doesn’t get asked as often as it first did when he took up the position, but there are still curious kids. Usually the ones who are still affected by the aftermath.
“Ah, no. My partner and I aren’t planning for children.” He ducks his head a little. “Plenty to look after at the school for both of us.”
wrong.” The unspoken ‘I don’t want her to end up like me’ hangs in the air between them.
“What I’m here for,” Harry begins because he still isn’t sure he can do this. “Is to see how you’re dealing with the change in your life, and to give any guidance you might need, as well as answer questions you might have.” It’s a mechanical speech, one he’s been taught to recite as a part of his government job training.
“Mr. Potter, you and I both know this is a highly unusual request, and not at all a practice we implement at our school.” McGonagall is looking up at him from behind her glasses with a firm gaze just like she used to when she was his teacher. Sometimes Harry feels like the world could collapse in on itself and it still wouldn’t be enough to change her.
“But they allowed you!”
“Maria, do you remember my cousin I told you about?” He asks before she can talk.
“Wait, us?”
Harry thinks the idea over. Hermione had fought hard to implement stricter child abuse laws in the wizarding world from the moment she’d stepped into office. And she’d managed to pass laws that could change children’s lives for the better. One of those laws includes kids being able to spend the summer at Hogwarts if their parents put them in danger, until a suitable foster or adoptive home can be located. In Harry’s eleven years as a teacher there had only been one instance of a child spending the summer over, and it had been because the child’s mother had to spend her summer hospitalised and had no other family. Harry would stay over every summer for Holly if he has to.
They ask after what dark arts eleven year olds need defence from, if there are resources they can read to better understand Holly when she gets back, and accommodate her new magical needs, they ask after Hogwarts and the things Holly has managed to share in the week she’s spent there. Are the moving stairs dangerous? Will she be learning how to fly? Why is the Forbidden Forest forbidden, and subsequently what the bloody hell? They ask after teachers, and students, and the houses, and quidditch,and Harry spends so much time talking he feels like he’s in class, and not talking to his cousin.
Somehow he makes himself move forward. He doesn’t want to start looking suspicious just standing there. He has muggle clothes on, just a sweater and some jeans, and he’s carrying a briefcase that holds no actual items of importance. The doorbell rings through the house and through Harry’s head.
The sorting continues and Harry still claps for every child, but his eyes keep drifting to Holly Dursley who has gotten her footing enough to engage in conversation with a couple of the kids sitting around her. She has a light dusting of freckles on her nose and her eyes are big and hazel. She looks nothing like him. She can’t be his. Dursley isn’t a unique surname. It has to be just a coincidence. And yet he can’t stop looking at her.
“You really surprised us all with it.” Harry laughs “I’m sure you will do your house proud.”
The woman’s eyes go wide. “Oh! I am so pleased to meet you Harry! Dudley here has told me so much about you.”
Harry finds Draco in his office by the dungeons before the other can head for lunch. Draco’s upper robe is off, neatly placed over his armchair, leaving him in a dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up. He’s checking items off a list while a second piece of parchment hovers in front of him.
“Oh hello!” She greets with a big smile. “You must be Holly’s teacher! Come in, come in, please. You’re right on time.” She pushes Dudley out of the way to allow Harry to follow her in and to the living room. “I’m Maria, Holly’s mother and this is my husband Dudley. Would you like some tea?”
Harry exhales and a moment later the world folds in around him.
Dudley’s face looks sombre. “You’re here to make sure I’m not my parents.” It’s not a question.
What are the names of Lisa’s pygmy puffs, what are superhero comics, what are the best muggle sweets, Robert’s favourite quidditch team, is Rose’s mom really the Minister of Magic.
“A pair of owls and a cat.”
“Not by blood.”
Harry would almost be tempted to believe he’s misheard, except McGonagall’s pose goes stiffer and Hagrid chokes a little on his drink.
Maria returns to the room with a tray of tea and biscuits before Harry has the time to answer.
They continue their banter until the exhaustion lifts from Harry’s shoulders enough for them to make their way back to the school.
“Bad time?” Harry asks, stopping at the door.
The Dursley house is a sandy colour, with the window frames painted green. Harry isn’t sure he remembers how to breathe. He’s prepared for the worst. He used to be an Auror; he remembers how to deal with dangerous situations, but right then he feels like he’s eleven again.
It’s Harry’s turn to put his head in his hand. “I had a class with Holly today.” Draco hums affirmative and lets him keep talking. “I was going to talk to McGonagall but I couldn’t find her and so… I spoke to Holly herself. It’s her. She’s his. Dudley’s.”
“That’s what you have me for.” Draco grins and it makes him look like he is twenty again.
Harry smiles and gives her a small bow. “Thank you, professor.”
“I used to quite enjoy some comics, too, Holly.” Harry says softly and she relaxes even more in her chair, her smile small but genuine.
The class goes quiet. Maybe they have expected him to boast. Many do. Then one by one they nod. Harry sees Holly lean in and ask Rose something. Rose responds ‘I’ll explain later’ and the questions continue.
Harry gives her his best reassuring smile. “They’re just in case I need to contact them, send over forms, and other formalities. You have done nothing wrong.”
Draco chuckles. “I’d say that’s good. Your niece is growing in a nice family.”
Harry does and sits on the armchair on the other side of Draco’s desk. It’s already covered in various papers and jars of ingredients and potions. They are four periods in and one wouldn’t guess the desk had been clean in the morning. It’s endearing.
Harry doesn’t answer verbally, but gives a nod and leaves. He appreciates the offer but it’s something he needs to do on his own. Some demons need to be faced alone.
The Dursleys do have questions. A lot of them.
“And that could have gone very wrong, very fast.” Harry sighs. “Believe me, waiting is a good thing.”
“Dad passed away eight years ago.”
Harry takes a breath. “So you noticed, too.”
“I hadn’t thought about that. It could work.” He says in the end.
“I might have told them about you.”
-------
Rose, of course, takes it in stride as she skips over to her table and takes her seat next to Holly Dursley whom she seems to have formed a friendship with. Good, Harry thinks, he can ask her about it later.
As was usual, even ten years of being here had not been enough for them to remember her birthday, which was today. She was twelve years old, officially, today, and how had she started her day? Miserably. She missed Hogwarts—she missed her friends. Why hadn’t they written? She couldn’t write to them, as Uncle Vernon had locked her owl in her cage, something that greatly irritated Hedwig, and bars went up on her window.
Persephone raise a brow, “Are you…a mermaid too?”
Persephone felt bad for the harassed looking wizard standing, almost guard, at the door, trying to make his voice heard over the commotion, “Calmly, please, ladies…Don’t push, there…mind the books, now…”
"The truth." Dumbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie."
“Good guess, Persephone,” He stared down at her. “But no. Not that. She died a long time ago.”
It was a confusing branch of magic that she did not nearly get lost in a library to learn about. The branch of magic that she did almost get lost in a library to learn about was…intricate. It was very complex and very hard to understand but she was sure of was that the books talked about dark magic simply being magic that was frowned upon because of its uses to harm others. People were scared of this magic like they were scared of the Dark Lord’s name.
. Probably from the kitchens passageway!
(See the end of the chapter for
Daphne bid them goodbye, smiling at them before joining her best friend. How she put up with that girl, Persephone would never understand.
He stared at her for a long moment, “Sorry what?”
“Has anyone got any water?” She spoke up suddenly. She was beginning to ache in the throat.
"Three Chaser," Persephone repeated as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.
“Oh, I do not think so,” Mrs. Weasley snapped. “It’s no one’s fault but your own that you’ve been up all night. You lot are going to de-gnome the garden for me; they’re getting completely out of hand again—”
Will always find their kind;
Persephone looked to Hermione and the girls exchanged a glance. Ron was still grimacing with an open mouth at this, probably thinking his brother Charlie was mad for working with dragons when they looked like this.
On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. The letters—or the owls???—found more creative ways to get the letters inside the house. Aunt Petunia accidently brought at least thirty letters home through the grocery shopping—they were inside the bread, in each of the two dozen eggs, in the cereal—all of which were addressed to
As she went in deeper, keeping in mind the books she was looking for, the library seemed to darken considerably. The main, widest aisle seemed to break off like a spider web, and become more complex, with thin passages to the next aisle. It was very dark. She couldn’t see a foot in front of her.
And there it was—the difference between the two. His lashes were thicker than Fred’s. Hm.
makeup set, with the tag of,
His eyes widened, “Hey, great! Good for you!”
"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said Snape silkily. "Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you."
She propped the book open and started reading.
“Then why did no one else react like that?” Hermione questioned, a scowl on her face.
She glanced between the three boys, raising her brow. For a moment, she thought they would hold her down—and she didn’t exactly have much room in the compartment to climb up a tree away from them.
The Slytherins were already there, and so were the broomsticks they were to hopefully fly on, lying in neat lines on the ground. Persephone had heard George and Fred Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
“It’s not the right time—and besides, I’m already doing something, as you can see.” He gestured to the mess on the floor. “So if that’s the only thing—”
Ron came up, “What was
The party was in full swing before eight. Someone had magically expanded the common room and the twins had a fully stocked snack bar and drinks were passed around. Someone had gotten some bottles of elf-made wine and suggested they play a few rounds of games of Secrets and Sins, Truth or Dare, and even spin the bottle. The first years were allowed to play too and even Neville was pulled in.
He seemed embarrassed, “Oliver Wood is really enthusiastic about Quidditch, huh? With all this, er, summer training.” He commented.
Fred picked out a book from the pile and whistled, “Who even reads about gardening anymore?”
"Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Persephone tried to speak. "Got the lot here—this young man is being fitted up just now, in fact."
Mr. Ollivander fixed Persephone with his pale stare.
Persephone and Ron held back fits of laughter as Malfoy, almost the color of his new hair, apologized to Persephone. “Well, then, I hope you’ll leave these two alone from now on, Mr. Malfoy. Off you go.” Flitwick turned to smile at Persephone and Ron. “Do let me know if they bother you again, Ms. Potter, no student shall be intimidated in my classroom.”
“Yeah—finally. He’s got Hermione’s letter!” He said. “I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.” He met his mother’s eye and took to opening the letter in mild embarrassment.
“Unless you can name some that walk around with legs, then yes,” He told her in a dulled voice. “But that can wait until after you do me a favor.”
Quirrell shivered suddenly. "He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me...decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me..."
The cheers Fred and George let out were louder than any one of the other Gryffindors. Gary, flushing a deep red, took a seat next to Percy. After him, there were only three girls and a boy left and then Dumbledore stood and made his speech, “Another year is upon us! It is a cause for celebration, for the beginnings of new friendships and experiences that you will all remember for as long as you live! But there are times when words must be spoken and others when they are not needed—so, tuck in!”
"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow," said Hagrid loudly. "Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that."
And he opened the cage.
Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.
Persephone felt herself freeze in horror—wherever he had come from, he was near. Filch, of course, knew the shortcuts in the castle and of course could appear anywhere—and very quickly too, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to add to this horrifying moment, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them."
The Restricted Section was much larger than she’d given it credit for. Her footsteps echoed in a way that showcased how far the section stretched for. As she cut a corner, the passage was suddenly blocked by a shifting bookshelf. She kicked herself for being surprised—why wouldn’t it shift around like the staircases in the school? It was a labyrinth!
“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,” Malfoy retorted. “I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.”
"Oi, you there! Is this here your toad?" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.
“Well we don’t know its Snape—”
Professor McGonagall looked speechless as she came close, her glasses fogged (in shock?) and her mouth trembling, “—how dare you—might have broken your neck—”
“Well, as all the greats that have come before us have proven—” George started.
“H—hi! I’m—I’m Colin Creevey,” he said breathlessly, taking another step forward. “And you’re Persephone Potter, aren’t you?
They got to work. The private office wasn’t large but it was expansive, with shelves and paintings, a fireplace and desk with one large window. She went through the book carefully, as to check if one would give an unexpected reaction. When she finished the shelf, she turned around and froze, confused.
“Cedric Diggory.”
A whistle sounded.
Meanwhile, Hagrid didn’t seem to be able to be reasoned with. The mere suggestion of setting him free made Hagrid sentimental. “I can’t do that!” He said. “He’s too little. He’d die without his mommy!”
The inside was just as…questionable. It was very dirty with sawdust all about. The windows were nearly opaque and the floor was all but invisible with dirt. There was a strong smell of what might have been described as goats. The bar was very small and probably violating some health codes with how dirty it was—even the rags behind the bar were filthy. No wonder this wasn’t a good place to be.
She couldn’t hide her smile, “I think Nico Di Angelo would suit you better--you're both pale, dark-haired introverts who pop n and out of places, controlling the shadows, princes of hell--"
"I get that all the time.
Her mind was swirling with images of Ben's eyes at the thought of werewolves.
“Bold of you to assume she’d get into a fight,” Persephone said, snorting.
Hermione and Ron were looking at her from then on, as if afraid she would go catatonic again as they walked out of the dungeons. She couldn’t pay them much attention with her sudden disability. She made it out of the dungeon use pure memory and decided to find her way to her dorm to grab her glasses. She would suffer through Pansy’s taunts to be able to see. She refused their help and went off on her own.
“Oh, good, Ron!” Hermione said, looking at her eyes.
Something not so easily covered up was the thin lightning-shaped scar on her forehead. The scar was only there, sketched into her skin abnormally by one of the most dangerous wizards that ever lived who’d failed to murder her and was the reason that she was found by her Aunt Petunia on the doorstep.
The more and more students that were sorted, the more Persephone noticed a sort of pattern—the hat never took its time for
“I managed to be rather fluent in wand making—that was a goal of mine,” he said. She snorted.
His lips curved into a sneering smirk, “I don’t think anyone bothers teaching girls hexes—all girls—” She cut him off with a straight fist to the nose, hoping she would cut his lip open over her knuckles. For a moment, he swayed back, surprised and shocked, for the first time speechless. She heard a chorus of ‘ooooh’s around her but at the moment she could only hear the buzz in her ears.
"Shut up," said Ron again. He was nearly as tall as the twin, George—from her angle, George looked just slightly taller, was it his hair?—already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.
“You said borrow,” She said, raising her brows.
“Well, of course they won’t be, and neither will you,” She smiled almost knowingly. “Persephone, darling, are you aware of a weekly to monthly allowance your aunt and uncle receive for taking…care of you throughout your life?” Persephone shook her head. “Well, they receive a certain amount of money each week to be able to foster you. The day you left for Hogwarts, I made it a point to remind them that they will not be fostering you for nine months of the year and…convinced them to allow me to set up a bank account for you to put the money they receive for you.”
Every year, the hat was placed upon the heads of new students on September 1
, you two should be on the train.”
"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly. "Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands...well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do…”
"Nicolas Flamel?” Persephone asked. “Who’s Nicolas Flamel?”
“So…being the youngest of five brothers must be tough, huh?” She said, trying to start a conversation.
“Yea, sure,” He grinned. “You have an owl?”
She tightened her fist into a hole, feeling the air solidify around his ankle, making him wobble and then she pulled back and pushed as hard as she could—Malfoy went
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Persephone informed them both of the news of Snape’s sudden desire to be the Quidditch referee.
Okay so, the diadem on her head, made her mind clear. It sorted her thoughts out and eased her confusion by giving her the answers she already had. It was her better mind?
“So only by choice.” He told her.
Percy rolled his eyes, “It’s written backwards, obviously!”
She said nothing as she continued to sprint towards the forest. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.
"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train—Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there." Fred said, leaning in.
How would one be able to notify that the diadem is needed?
you’re in Gryffindor, right? Like me? I thought you were, with the red tie—and you’re a Slytherin!” He said, looking at Daphne.
She indicated at Persephone and he finally turned, only his head, to look down upon her. “This student has presented me with a note she claims was written by you. As I know you do not write notes for first years, I thought it appropriate to bring it to your attention that a student is forging your signature.”
Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.
"Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?"
“You’ve got something in your hair,” A dreamy voice said. She had just realized she was resting not on the dirt ground but on a rock and that’s what was so uncomfortable. The rock was on the edge of the shore and she was trying hard to open her eyes. They stung in the air when she did open them and when she finally registered the voice was not a voice she recognized, she had opened her eyes.
She spun, picking the book up and staring at it in wonder—it was right in front of her! “I know who Flamel is!” She spun, running past Neville and up the girl’s dorm stairs. She heard Hermione tell Ron to wait a moment, and then Ron’s, “I can’t follow there, you know!” before she heard Hermione following up the stairs.
“A date?” She flushed. “Right, no.”
Hermione pursed her lips, looking at her pleadingly, “Malfoy wouldn’t keep the letter on him…no, he would keep it in the Slytherin common room.”
"Why are you going to London?" Persephone asked, frowning.
She smiled a slow smile, “Perfect,” She drawled.
“Thrrr…ruined….” She frowned.
“…and everyone thinks she’s so smart, with her stupid wand tricks and her scar and her broomstick—”
“We’re a little way outside the village,” said George. “Ottery St. Catchpole.”
“They’re in a grade above you—I’m not sure you’re not a Gryffindor—they’re popular and fun and loud and funny and you’re…” She cut herself off, knowing whatever came next would slightly insult him.
With everyone staring at her, she decided to put inhibitians away. She twisted the cap and found it was already open—that was weird. She allowed the drink to touch her tongue and found it was much to sweet for her. When she lowered the drink without having drunk any of it, the girls cheered.
the cute twin!” Fred argued, his voice growing louder. Persephone stared up at them as they now turned their stares at each other.
He cleared his throat, “A month, actually.”
“Okay, sorry—but are we talking about the ones with tails? The ones that are rumored to live in the Black Lake?”
Both of them were heterochromia iridis, which meant two colors in one eye, also going by hazel. They each had a little bit of the other in each, so the green had specks of blue, while the blue had specks of green. You’d only see them if you paid close attention, though. She knew the terms only from one of Diana’s textbooks on human biology. She was pretty good at that too.
“Eat slugs, Malfoy!” Ron yelled from across the courtyard as he and Hermione caught the conversation. Most of the courtyard was listening now.
She jumped up and handled the spotlight with comfort instead of discomfort—she knew how to handle audition spotlight. She’d grown up doing it. Ballet was worse than singing.
This was no birthday greeting.
“LILY!” George cried. He was in the middle of the hall, standing right under an arch of red roses. “Pick me over Fred!”
"Weasley, I know what I'm talking about," she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine."
He cast some spell that Persephone didn’t catch and she found herself unable to move away from the tree. She stared at him as he caught Malfoy by the arm and whispered an incantation. Malfoy stilled and then blinked and he sent him running. Then he turned back to Persephone. Fang barked and Ben looked at him and then the dog whined, looking down.
“Who else? Oh, I don’t know—of the thirteen friends you have of your year and the addition of the older students, I wouldn’t be so sure.” He smirked. “Haven’t you noticed your popularity?”
Enjoy!
"You!" Ron said furiously. "Go back to bed!"
Persephone changed the subject, “And Pansy doesn’t mind that I’m coming? She and Malfoy sort of hate me, Daph.”
“Of course,” She rolled her eyes. “I hope you fall out of this tree and break your back.”
“For your information, I
Hermione was interrupted one breakfast time by a note from Hagrid that read:
When Persephone knocked, there was a frantic scrabbling that sounded suspiciously like an animal running. Then there were several booming barks—Ron and Persephone exchanged a look. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang—back."
“Lucky!” She pouted. “But you didn’t pick Gryffindor!?” She gasped, “Why?”
“That’s not surprising,” Persephone said, flipping through one of the books. “Hagrid loves dragons. He said he wanted one when we first met.”
She looked into the mirror once more—and then met an older looking version of herself. Persephone was sure this woman was older than Persephone. She was not skinny like Persephone, but curved, and taller, and immensely beautiful. Her hair was the same shade, if not a red shade darker. Her nose was the same, but longer to accommodate the mature face. The contour of her cheeks were sharpened, but soft, still round somehow. Her perfectly round, plump lips were turned into a smile and she realized her older version was crying—crying out of…green eyes…
She pursed her lips, not knowing how to tread with this subject, “I don’t know if it matters whether or not you’re in your parent’s house. I mean, you’re not your parents, right? And besides, every house seems good on its own.”
"Oh for the love of—what, Malfoy? Feeling braver being on the ground? Or is your two idiot friends that boost your confidence up to an unbearably annoying amount?” She breathed out, exasperated.
“Er…nothing,” She re-folded her legs and smiled up at them. “Hey Susan.”
She frowned, “Do you want—”
“Yeah, hyperactive thyroid gland, electrolyte imbalance, serotonin syndrome and Reye syndrome, severe brain trauma, spinal cord injury—do you think that’s because of your scar?” He asked, staring at her forehead, making a play to poke it.
She thought about whether or not she could trust him and he seemed to catch her train of thought, “Is it a secret?”
After a while, when everyone had finished eating, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding, grapes, cut oranges, apple slices…
Draco didn’t mind being alone, he actually preferred it. Wet drops of salt started to run down his cheeks, though it took him a moment to realize he was actually crying.
'You should know. You should
'Is that what this place is called?' Harry asked and Tonks nodded. He took another look around the room, noticing it's decay. It seemed as if no-one had lived in the house for centuries and that now there were inhabitants, it seemed to protest against every gesture of improvement.
?' A vague memory of a small, blond child holding hands with a tall, blond man. A woman with black curls next to him, opening the door to showcase a collection of potential toys — at least, that was what Draco had thought at the time.
Not wanting the waste any more time, Draco took off the beret he had been wearing all day and tossed it somewhere next to his clothes. Untying his bun of silver hair, he kept his eyes locked in those of Harry. He could see the white reflect in the boy's round spectacles when his hair fell down on and over his shoulders. Harry's eyes grew large again at the sight of Draco's long locks and Draco had to suppress his cheeks from blushing. It was true that he had never shown his hair to anyone else beside from the twins and the girls; he just didn't like everyone to know about it. Of course, if you looked at him closely, you could see that underneath one of his hats his hair wasn't short but going upward in a tied-up way. But nobody who didn't know had ever mentioned it, which had led to him never having to explain or show it unwillingly before. The rare occasions that Draco wore his hair down were during the night, during bathing and on lazy days at home.
, I think my nightly adventure isn’t over yet.’
'Taking you to Hogwarts, of course,' he answered, still with a bright smile. 'Come one — the others will be out of their minds!'
Let me sleep a little longer,' Draco whispered to him as he buried his face in Harry's jumper again.
As he reaches out to a book he's read already a few times before; he hears the soft hooting of an owl outside his window. The round face of Potter's Barn owl appears in sight; staring through his window with shiny black eyes.
Draco's heart skipped a beat at Harry's genuine words. Hearing that the boy loved him was enough to slowly melt him away into nothingness, become one with the floor of his small compartment room.
. 'On my sign!'
at the Ministry. I can't even find that stupid new department.'
‘Well, there’s always one of the simpler spells mentioned here that would prevent it from spreading. At least we could try that?’ Potter says with a sigh after going through the entire book.
As another silence stretches out, Harry gives himself the time to think a bit more how
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
'I have no idea what you're talking about,' he obviously lied.
Taking in his strong facial features and posture, he found his heart skip for a third time that very day. It wasn't the same as when he had seen the boy's green eyes, though. Those eyes were mesmerizing compared to Krum's dull browns.
. He immediately missed not having a cup of tea to wash away the foul taste. 'You don't like it, do you?' Harry asked him with a grin and Draco nodded in all honesty.
'Take a seat, take a seat,' Dumbledore said, pointing at two comfortable looking chairs that were set just far enough apart for them to accept the offer. Draco didn't dare to look at Harry and kept his eyes on the old Headmaster, whom held the slightest grin on his face. Why the man was smiling, Draco had no idea. 'You two caused quite the fuss in the Great Hall, didn't you?'
Uncertain of what to do, Harry looked at Draco's face. He still held the same peaceful expression upon his handsome face and it reassured Harry somehow that everything would be fine; something the boy had said to him so often. He then caught the movement of something dark in the corner of his left eye and shortly after saw a human body with the head of a shark appear; Krum. His failed transfiguration was quite gruesome to look at but at least he had reached the village; ready to save Hermione. He freed her in a matter of seconds and raced away through the water as if it was all he ever did.
Draco nods. It was the first thing he did after receiving it from Potter’s barn owl. ‘It’s really interesting, and also has a lot of curses, spells and potions described that could’ve caused my condition.’
Fleur let out a mocking laugh. 'You're kidding, right?
With a soft thud he landed just outside of the Manor's gates; their iron dooming up above him and making it feel like a cage. Draco's hands were sweating — his palms warm instead of their usual coldness as he waited for his parents to notice his presence and for them to open the gates. It seemed to take them longer than usual and Draco's nervosity only increased as he stood there and waited to be greeted in any way possible. Would he be hugged as all the years before? Or would a hand greet him with a slap in the face? Perhaps a curse would hit him before he would see either of his parents appear — putting him out of his misery for good or turning him into a statue of stone to decorate their entryway.
, a voice in his head told him. He shook it off as he had more important things to say and do. ‘You’ll have to fight a dragon. I saw them with my own two eyes! They’re hiding them deep inside the Forbidden Forest; spitting fire against trees and under control of a dozen of spells.’
'Well, you look like one to me,' Harry told him.
Draco bit his teeth as he shuffled into the drawing room, still holding on to his mother and trying to avoid eye-contact with Voldemort's red eyes. Instead, his eyes wandered off towards the floating figure of a middle-aged woman — her mouth opened wide and her eyes set as if cursed. He had to blink a few times to concentrate himself without freaking out, panicking that there could be a similar destiny awaiting him. A snake passed by his feet, a large creature that made him startle from the inside. The grip around his mother's arm tightened, and he could feel how she squeezed back in an assuring way. Narcissa guided him towards the chair next to a woman Draco knew as Bellatrix Lestrange. The same woman whom had murdered Harry's god-father Sirius Black and had nearly destroyed the Burrow. Anger rose to Draco's head, like a potion brewing fervently, but was quickly suppressed by his fear — the fear of her dark eyes staring at him in a mocking way. As he sat down, Draco couldn't help but notice that Castor Idel, whom he knew as a Death Eater as well, wasn't there; the blond Slytherin nowhere to be seen and no vacant spot left for him at the table.
'Hermione did. I- I didn't find

A soft kiss got pressed against his forehead followed by deep sigh, as if Harry wasn't just tired from the day but tired by life in general. Perhaps he also was, now that he had so many things to worry about. Add Umbridge to that and his life was the perfect melange of negativity. Draco felt sorry for him; wished he could do something to make his life a little more easy — to take his responsibilities as the Boy-Who-Lived away if only for a few hours. The only thing he could do, though, was surround him with his love and make him feel loved — make him feel like he wasn't alone. Draco pulled him a bit closer to radiate that feeling and heard a content sigh escape from the boy's mouth in return. 'You know, Umbridge has made this rule that forbids one to be within six inches of each other,' Harry told him, his face so close that his breath could be felt upon Draco's pearl cheeks.
. A breath inhaled so silent, it's almost unnoticeable. It is still early in the morning, yet the warm light of an upcoming sun isn't there. Cool, grey light is filtering through the window instead, shining upon Draco's face and waking him. He slowly opens his eyes to replace the darkness of his dreams with the darkness of reality. A wish to make the sun come out, but the Malfoy Manor remains veiled underneath a dark, velvet blanket.
'N-no,' Harry stammered.
left Voldemort's lips in a snake-like hissing, and it didn't resume its pace as the exact resemblance of Draco's face doomed up behind the man's mask. It could have been Draco but the age lines on the man's face betrayed him for being older, leaving only one conclusion; it had to be Draco's father,
'Well,
Giving the man a confused glance over his shoulder, Harry decided the man was going mad; talking things that weren't making any sense. Quickly hurrying himself down the stairs, he was about to leave the tower when he heard more footsteps approach. Hiding himself behind another pillar, he heard how those same footsteps entered the room and started to go up the steps he had just descended. Harry peered from behind the pillar, but only got the seam of one's black robes. Who was meeting professor Dumbledore at an hour this late?
Another week later the Malfoy-personalized tea cup he made for whatever reason are sent off together with the book Hermione found for him at the Hogwart's library. Harry used his Barn owl for the job; the owl that he found hooting at his forest house's window a few weeks after moving in. Not really wanting to create a replacement for Hedwig, he decided to just call the owl 'Owl' and get it over with. The owl came whenever he called and delivered messages perfectly; yet he still didn't want to build a relationship with it. Too afraid he'll loose such a beautiful creature once again.
As he waited by the Prefect's bathroom door, he wondered why exactly he hadn't just told him the password and made the boy figure the message out by himself.
Fleur nodded. 'He already drew its design when he was in his third year — I never knew why but I'm glad he did.
Now Draco was the one to laugh. 'Well, he has been known to be a Death Eater as well — together with
'Well, you seemed quite mad at me because I didn't tell you that I saw the dragons before you told me that you saw the dragons and that I should have seen them but that I already saw them and-'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Putting on big eyes, Draco immediately shook his head. What was Harry thinking? How could he face something again that had given him so much pain — that had nearly taken away something that he loved most in the world. '
But Harry was still worried, not so sure if it was that intelligent of a plan. 'What if he'll check if you're there?'
Tree tops dipped in orange paint; mornings always seem like a masterpiece to Harry. The smell of wet grass, a gust of cold wind flying through his window. He tried to live at 12 Grimmauld Place for a year after the War, but the house just didn't want him in it. Of course he could've hired a curse-breaker or ask Hermione for help but at the same time he knew he didn't want to live there. The house had a dark past and every room held a memory of Sirius; the only true family member he ever knew in his life. Kreacher still lived in the house, though; all alone like he had for many years prior. The house-elf didn't mind; he grew quite fond of being alone. Besides, he always had Walburga's portrait to shout at him must he ever feel lonely.
Waking up with sweat dripping down his face, he had awoken Harry many times as well. The boy had comforted him, like he always did, and listened to Draco cry softly into the night, trying to let his nightmares fade away. It tired the both of them; not to mention Draco often still had to help bloody Castor with his bloody Vanishing Cabinet. Couldn't the sodding idiot just handle
The tall woman sighed, cupping Draco's cheek in the large palm of her hand. '
. I hope he and Madame keep in touch. I think she could use a taller friend, now and then.’
Harry was silent and seemed to think about Draco’s words; probably picturing the accident in his head as well. A small smile appeared on his face as he looked at Draco again. ‘It’s a beautiful scar, though,’ he told the blond.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Slightly surprised by this new information, Harry gave Draco a strange look. “You don’t sleep either?” Another shake of his head. “Then what do you do the entire night?”
'It came too late, though; you still have to go to the Ministry,' he whispered back.
Placing a hand on the boy's shoulder and giving him a kiss on the cheek, Draco threw him a smile and gestured for him to follow. 'We should go before we're late.'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Harry suddenly felt like a very,
‘It’s my dearest possession,
name;
'Well, is that still — still the same for you?'

Draco clenched his jaw. So his mother decided to go anyway, even without her son? An irritated sigh can be heard as he imagines his mother, hooded under a dark cloak, making her way through the bustling streets of Magical London — trying not to get cursed by anyone who knows her face.
Everything was getting too confused for Draco, and he had to close his eyes for a second to let everything fall into place. 'Castor Idel?' The name of that boy seemed even more distant than any other memories Draco had lost. 'Why would you think that?'
Harry let out a deep sigh and dropped the brooms, took Draco's face in his hands. Harry's hands felt soft yet rough at the same time; soft fingertips but with rough spots from all the flying the boy did. 'Yes, you
Harry glanced over at Draco before answering them. 'Well, we went flying and Draco fell so I—‘
Another gust of wind passed by, and they were gone.
The Unspeakable crossed his arms and let out a sigh of his own. His eyes dared to give the deformed body another look before staring at the Healer again. 'Kingsley told me to give you another week. If you haven't found anything by next week we'll be back to get rid of the body.'
Memories flashed in front of his eyes as he searched his mental library; searched for the glimpse of a sapphire he could vaguely recall.

for any longer than a few seconds. "Don't," he heard Draco say, casting his eyes to the floor.

. Cursing himself and Harry on the inside; he saw the china statue fall to pieces onto the floor. Castor was out of his chair in seconds, drew his wand and suspiciously looked around. 'What was that?' he asked Draco and the objects around him.
'I feel great!' Harry answered, a smile suddenly appearing on his face as he got up to his feet.
It had been easy for Draco to ignore that voice the first week, maybe the first two weeks — but it was becoming harder and harder by the day. As he looked at himself in the mirror a few weeks later, he almost didn't recognize himself anymore. Circles darker than he had ever seen, as dark as clouds in a star-less sky, were painted around his eyes and seemed to darken the veins in his cheeks as well. His dull grey eyes seemed way more vivid and alive; shining a weird gleam which made him look possessed and psychopathic. They were a darker grey; mimicking the inside of his new soul. He also didn't feel like eating anything at all; only ate a little in the evening when his mother forced him to — the locket slowly eating him from the inside out. The scars on his chest, stomach and back were still healing as well, the wounds fresh and burning from time the time. When he took baths he often swore he could see the red flesh move as if a dark curse was still very much alive underneath them.
Raising her chin as if Dumbledore had just offended her greatly, Minerva shook her head. 'Of course not. I admire mister Malfoy for wanting to continue his education even if that means going to a different school; we shall welcome him with open arms,' she said.
…' Draco answered, biting his bottom lop.
‘Well, aren't we talking right now?’
reason and was avoiding him because of it. The way Hermione and Ron seemed to avoid him as well made it even more suspicious. But Draco eventually got ahold of the pair leaving the Great Hall after dinner, a dinner they hadn't attended the nights before. Draco himself hadn't had any meal in the Great Hall himself either, spent all his time searching for Harry instead. He stopped the curly girl and ginger boy in their pace, catching glimpses of surprise in their eyes. 'Where's Harry?' Draco asked straight away.
Dumbledore nodded his head.
Dark robes he once had worn to a funeral were hung to his wardrobe; his mother had probably placed them there for him to wear. Exchanging his pajamas of silk for the darkness of the robes, Draco felt even more like just giving up all together. Knowing that his hair was probably the most chaotic mess it had ever been, he still didn't even glance into the mirror to fix it; he was simple too tired and couldn't care any less. His mother was waiting just outside his door, dressed in black robes herself and her hair partly tied to keep the strands out of her face. Draco could hear his father saunter through the hallway as well, further down and looking like a complete mess himself. His once
'Well, it was nice to meet the three of you — but I have to go now. Keep the girls away from the beasts and such,' he told them, chin held up high and hands put behind his back.
Harry swallowed once again. The immense hunger he had felt before slowly left his stomach. Why was everyone questioning him all of the sudden? 'Well, I—,’ he started, but got interrupted by Draco who had appeared on the other side of the table.
'Terrible,' he answered. 'I kept feeling his eyes staring at me — felt how he was still awake and waiting for me to fall asleep. I don't know why I had that feeling, but it kept me up all night.'
The boy had put on a weird smile before lowering his sleeve again. 'You can put away your own wand now as well; we're not enemies.'
But Harry only felt mad, felt abandoned and left out of something. How could they ask how he was when he had been worried all summer, had waited for his letters to be answered when they were here, together, chilling on a bed and talking about — about
But Harry didn't give up. ‘Just fine or like a
They entered the Great Hall, and were greeted with a mix of hesitant smiles and the sound of weeping. He could see a few of the Weasleys hunched over two bodies; lifeless like the body of the small boy. As he neared, his heart almost stopped beating. Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks had peaceful expressions on their faces —
Draco thought to himself,
As Draco was about to leave the courtyard, he suddenly heard Harry's voice call his name. The green-eyed boy had spotted him and with his Gryffindor bravery sparking up inside, he wouldn't let Draco just leave like that.
Harry rolled his eyes. 'That Umbridge — who else? It's one of her punishments at detention, and let's say that I was the perfect candidate for it.'
Draco's parents hadn't reacted as sweetly as the twins had; they had despised it from the moment their eyes had seen it. Draco hadn't told Harry about it; as he didn't want to give the boy another reason to feel responsible and sorry for it all. His father had raised his hand; almost as an automatic gesture programmed into his mind to hit his son must he ever do such thing. The man had told him how different he looked; how he didn't resemble a true Malfoy anymore. How could one be so angry about something as futile as hair, Draco had wondered. He had felt small and worthless as his father had finally lowered his hand, straightened his robes and left the room without another word. His mother had dropped her tea cup upon seeing it and hadn't commented on it at all; but the look of worry in her eyes had been enough for Draco to know she wasn't sure wether it had been the right decision to make such a bold statement towards his father, and his beloved Pureblood-line.
With eyebrows frown, Harry took a step closer. 'Is that why you want me to become friendly with him, sir?'
Draco let out a deep sigh and read Harry's letter again; at least Dumbledore had managed to escape. His prediction had come true though; the Ministry was now officially after the Headmaster with a reason — with the evidence they needed.
He made his way through what seemed to be streets with the hill-houses on either side and stumbled upon something that humans would call a square. A circle of green and blue, light shining down like a spotlight. Pointy tridents and weapons; pointed at the boy by the square's guardians. And in the middle; four sleeping figures bound to stone statues of mermaids. Only one of them caught Harry's attention; a pale boy, taller than the other three, hulled in blue robes and his long hair floating around his head.
Dumbledore placed a hand atop of Draco's shoulder, whispered something to him that clearly made the muscles in his face relax. 'I already expected to find you here, Tom. Especially tonight,' Dumbledore said, turning himself to Voldemort. Draco slowly took a step aside but tightened the grip around his golden wand. 'The Aurors are on their way.'
Walking to the door, hand in hand, Draco threw one last look over his shoulder. Time had resumed itself, and everyone had bursted into tears — sobs for a wonderful little girl that would most definitely be missed.
Harry shook his head and opened the bag he had been dragging along with him ever since they had left. A cloak of pure silk appeared, decorated with tiny stars and moons; his father's infamous invisibility cloak. Flashbacks to when Draco had bumped into Harry, had despised him for being such a clumsy and ignorant student roaming the ground of Hogwarts in the dark flashed in front of Draco's eyes. It made him smile, remembering times where they we nothing more than acquaintances. With their arms locked, the invisibility cloak easily covered the two of them and they continued their chase in knowing what Umbridge was up to.
'You can call me Harry, sir,' he had replied the man — making him smile a little.
'That's too bad,' Draco told him. 'I would have loved to meet a werewolf. Very interesting creatures,

She sighed deeply as she placed a hand on his shoulder. 'You are here because I trust you, because I know you will look after

wrong. Draco had known it from the moment Harry had appeared in front of them, the Triwizard cup deserted next to him and arms wrapped around Cedric's body. It hadn't been normal, the way Cedric's body hung in Harry's arms like a puppet. The music and the cheering had been loud but still Draco had heard Harry crying, spotted his tears from afar. And he had jumped off his seat, gathered all the energy he had left inside his body. '
Had he ever been dead, then? Words that would have normally caused him to panic now made him exhausted; the few things he had taken in too much for him to handle. He had to close his eyes again, had to sleep and forget about everything that had happened.
Draco thinks.
‘That
?' he told them. They all nodded their heads and Draco jumped out of the carriage, the girls following in his steps.
perhaps.
. The memory faded away in smoke before Draco could hear any more of their conversation or see them for a second longer; his figure being pulled out of the pensieve's liquid by another person. A bit startled and confused of what he had seen, it took Draco a moment to realize where he was again; in Dumbledore's own office. And as he turned around, he looked at the aged and old version of the Dumbledore he had seen only a second ago. 'How alike you are to Harry sometimes, Draco. So curious,' the headmaster said to him before seating himself behind his desk.
They're sitting back down on the uncomfortable chairs, Draco making his third cup of tea and wiping in his itching red eyes every few seconds. Fully dressed again, he suddenly realizes that the warmth of Potter's body close to his own can't compare to the warmth of clothes. The hugging collar around his neck can't reassure him the same way as Potter's hand could while going through his hair. It makes him dizzy, thinking all these things. He shouldn't be thinking those things; he should think about surviving and leaving Potter out of all this mess as much as possible.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Are you looking forward to dinner, Harry? Will you come sit next to me, Harry? More potatoes, Harry? Shall I refill your glass, Harry?"
'Another plan you've made up to let Wizards rule over Muggles?' Young Dumbledore asked with a roll of his eyes. 'Are you sure we're that superior to them? I mean — they can be quite inventive as well.' He wiped the sleep from his eyes and yawned before sitting down on the edge of his bed.
Draco nods. He could believe that; the Weasel girl had always been very good at playing Quidditch. There was not a single thing wrong with her technique and growing up with so many brothers probably made her a tough woman. And yes, Draco had also always known Potter would end up being an Auror; it was only natural for him to do so, saving the world until he would collapse under its weight. Yet Potter would've made a very good teacher at Hogwarts as well if he must believe all the stories from that Dumbledore Army back in fifth year.
Ron keeps the frown on his face while Hermione nods slowly. 'I can believe that,' she replies.
Harry's hand trembled as he suddenly heard the voice resound through the atrium, filling it with that undertone of snake only Voldemort possessed. He turned his back to Bellatrix, faced the very monster again after a year of terrible nightmares and visions about him. His snake-like face, gleaming red eyes and robes of black silk sent shivers down Harry's spine and he automatically took a few step backwards.
,' Draco answered. The sleep was slowly drifting away from the blond's eyes and he started to look more alert, more like himself again.
, I do bathe together with the girls. It’s really not as awkward as you may think, Harry. The girls are used to seeing me naked by now and I am totally fine with it.’
'Are you sure about this?'
Letting out a sigh and suspiciously glancing at the twins talking to the others, Draco quickly knocked and hoped he could escape into Madame's office before the twins wanted to join them as well — it would become quite the fiasco with having the duo by his side while trying to explain something serious. 'Are you coming with me?' Draco then asked. He might not need the extravagant support of his best friends; Harry's support was always welcome.
'I'll do it,' she said, placing the cup on the tree trunk and picking up the sword again. 'It doesn't seem as evil as the locket.'
A marble table dominated the room with above it a floating body. At least, if it could be called a body. Dolohov's body was unrecognizable as it was black as coal, his face a shade alike. His eyes weren't there, or maybe they were but were too black to be seen. The man's mouth was opened slightly; exposing black pointy teeth and drawn up into a grimace. Harry immediately understood why Davis was so shocked; Dolohov didn't look human anymore, he indeed looked like a Dementor.
hit you and you fell on your head or something…"
Yet he couldn't see besides the dark circles that grew around his grey eyes and the way his blond locks just didn't want to stay the way they once did. Malfoy seemed desperate to make it look like he was completely fine even though he was totally not. Something Harry himself never bothered to do; and it probably showed.
. Do you want me to read all of these?' Harry's eyes grew wide with those words, a finger pointed at the small pile.
'And who are you,
'May I know what you will be using it for?'
This question seemed to confuse the boy for a second, and he blinked with his pale grey eyes. "I actually don't know… nobody's ever asked me so directly before…" He seemed to think about it for another while, then returned to his calm and ethereal state. "I'd say it has it's good and it's bad sides, Harry."
Curious to know who it was, Harry sneaked up the stairs again and waiting only a few away from the top of the tower. He couldn't hear the Wizard's voice properly; his whispering too soft to be carried to the staircase. Blond, dressed in black and clearly threatening Dumbledore with a wand.
Hermione gave her friend an irritated look. '
'Not — not without my friends,' Harry stammered as a response, looking around to see where his friends were actually. He then saw glimpses of them appear in his sight, a warm feeling filling his chest at knowing they were save.
'Interfered? I had to stop him from murdering professor Dumbledore!' he said, and then suddenly realized something. 'And you? You were here, so why didn't you save him?'
Draco shook his head, a little smile gracing his porcelain face. “An angel does not drink nor eat — nor breathe nor sleep.”
Harry's hand had found its way upon Draco's arm, a firm grip that Draco knew wouldn't let him go so easily. He shook his head and buried his face in his hands. 'I can't, Harry,' he said to the boy.
Harry looked up into Draco's grey eyes to then drop them to the book again. '
Hiding behind trees with every step the pair took, he couldn't help but feel a little like a spy — and he wasn't even a good one as Hagrid noticed the sound of cracking branches and footsteps upon leafs. Fortunately Madame shook them off with asking personal questions about the tall man himself; Draco got to know all the details about his dog, Fang, and how much he loved working as Hogwarts' gamekeeper. Madame Maxime hung to every word the man seemed to say, something Draco was surprised about. He had never seen Madame be so gentle to another man, let alone have a decent conversation with one for longer than a few minutes. Perhaps it was the fact that they were both taller than average and a little…
insisted on finding out where Dobby went — what exactly had happened. Of course he hadn't been very pleased when finding out he had been set free, and was working at the Hogwarts' kitchen like a true employee!'
Harry laughed a little at Draco's comment, and Draco's lips curled upwards once more as well. "How did you know I was wondering just that?" he asked, a little

Did he, Harry Potter himself, miss Malfoy?
With Ron now bolting up from his chair, ready to kick the elf in the gut — for calling Hermione such a terrible word — Kreacher already took a few steps backwards while protecting his tiny body with his thin arms. 'Don't call her that,' Harry added to it in a strict way. He knew Sirius had given Grimmauld Place to him, which meant he was Kreacher's master now and therefore the house-elf had to obey his words. Kreacher seemed to understand that fact as well, as he bowed his head slightly. 'Do you know where the real locket is? This one is a fake,' Hrry explained to him, and Kreacher looked up again.

One green eye opened up, stared in Draco's direction. Harry nodded his head, then closed his eye again and sighed deeply. 'We have the sword — and a horcrux,' Ron stated out of nowhere. The ginger-haired boy was staring at the lake in front of him, a blank look on his face.
what Draco was going to do without him telling the boy? Hoping and praying in his head that that wouldn't happen, Draco tightened his embrace around Harry’s figure. 'There is one thing I might be able to tell you though,' Draco told him in whispers. His voice sounded off because of the tears, but his mind needed to get it out — needed to at least give Harry somewhat of a warning.
'I'm sorry about what I did,' Potter says to him.
Perhaps ten years ago those words would've driven Harry mad, would've made him protest — but he'd been banned from the table already too many times to complain about it. "Oh
the right one.
'We are not dating, Ron. Viktor is just a good friend of mine; one with a brain, at least.' With those words said she stormed away, chin held up high like Draco knew he would do in a similar situation as well. He admired her for handling arguments so perfectly, with the right words said before elegantly storming off. She was a fierce girl that would've definitely been an amazing Beauxbatons student.
. How are you today?' he asked him, grey eyes focused on his greens.
'And that's why you're unbelievable. There is no other student that I know of that would hide someone away from the wizarding world without being caught — or would go into battle and save so many lives,' Harry said to him, taking ahold of Draco's cold hands and heating them up with his warm palms. 'It makes you an unbelievable person, Draco.'
The ginger-haired boy waved his hands. ‘You know what — don’t even answer! I’ve had enough of this ball. I’m going to bed,' he declared as he turned on his heel and stomped off to Gryffindor Tower.
The weird moment got disturbed by a loud sound, filling the cellar and announcing the appartion of someone. Harry quickly turned around, curious to see whom it was. His eyes found Dobby, standing amongst his friends with the brightest smile. 'I am here to take the friends of Harry Potter away,' he explained. 'Harry Potter's friends are Dobby's friends.' With his long fingers clenched around the pillowcase he still wore for clothes, combined with Hermione's colorful socks from what seemed like ages ago — Harry couldn't have been more glad to see the little elf again.
'He does,' Hermione replied to it, gesturing towards Harry with her head. 'And he will forever blame himself, no matter what you will tell him.'
way.'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
The tunnel seemed to go on for at least a mile, and Draco's back started to hurt as he was too tall to walk through the darkness comfortably. It was uncomfortable for anyone, he then realized, looking at the others in front of them and hearing their sighing. An angel sang in his ears as a light appeared in front of his eyes; another portrait got swung aside. A buzz of voices followed, caught his ears and drew his attention.
Harry squeezed his hand, hadn't let go of it ever since he had taken it in his and gave Draco the weakest of smiles. 'I'm very proud of you for sharing that story with me. It must've been difficult for you growing up around a man that idolized such a monster.'
A wave of panic wraps around Draco's heart for just a second, before he remembers his concealment charm and once again replaces his fear with anger. “You want to see my Dark Mark?” he spats once again, agitated.
The table of the yellow house, of which Draco still didn't know the name, burst out in applause as the boy with the yellow scarf from before stood up amongst them. Seen from a closer view, he was actually quite handsome, Draco realized. A strong jawline but soft eyes, determination visible on his face. Dumbledore gave him a handshake as well, followed by a hug and a bright smile. Of course he was the happiest with the Champion from his own school, it was only normal.
Hermione was seated next to him, now the one to be rather smug than the ginger-head. She still wasn't very pleased with her best friend spending so much time —
at least that's what he thought
that you were going to the library, but you weren't there. They looked everywhere for you, Draco!
All pieces fell into place and Draco felt mad at himself for not understanding earlier; Harry's words were always just so… so
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
'But not this one, not one that would do… would do
“The house-elf, Pibbly, spoke of a Master Malfoy so I guess he's still alive. Unless Lucius has returned to the Manor as a ghost, of course,” he says to Ron, imagining the long haired ghost of Lucius Malfoy, haunting the Manor with glares of death.
Draco gave him a glare before lifting a single finger, and sending his father flying through the room — hitting a wall and falling down in a heap of misery. '
Draco blinked a few times with his eyes, but didn’t seem quite surprised by those words at all. And Harry on his part wasn’t surprised by that — if this boy had spent over sixteen years observing his life, he should know how things went on by now. “I’ll handle it,” Draco then said, not waiting for a reply and opening the hatch, pushing down the ladder.
The melody comes to an end; no more notes left on the sheet. Draco lowers his violin, both hands clenched around the violin and it's bow. Eyes still focused on the music he just played, his head still caught up in its melody, he doesn't even notice tears runnings down his cheeks; making his face sticky and wet. He had never let music move him so much, but he guesses the situation for it to move him so deeply was never there.
Draco nodded. 'I knew I wouldn't be welcomed by many members, but seeing Harry again was worth the risk for me.' A side-glance of loving eyes was enough for Harry to float away on the spot, but he kept his feet steady on the ground as he listened to Tonks following words.
, Draco thought to himself.
But Harry had checked Draco's arm for the mark; and his perfect pearl skin had been unharmed. Yet, Harry couldn't help but think there was something else going on besides the fact that Draco missed being at Beauxbatons so much. The boy, for example, didn't receive any letters from home at all nor from his friends anymore. And at night, he often caught Draco sneaking out of the dormitory to then disappear out of the Gryffindor Tower all together.
Neither of those words had ever left Dudley's lips in his entire life, and it had shocked both Harry as Dudley's parents so greatly that neither of them had been able to even eat half of their plates. Dudley on the other hand had eaten like a pig — a decent one for once though, which once more had shocked the Dudleys. Harry hadn't been surprised either when Vernon'd decided to call a doctor straight after he'd left the table, and the trio had driven off a few moments later.
It wasn't until the first of June when they finally found out where this secret department could be found. Paying another visit to St. Mungo's to check on Davis' condition, they overheard a duo of Unspeakables chatting in the man's hospital room. Harry and Ron hadn't mean to overhear their conversation but as they had approached Davis' room; their curiosity at the sound of voices took over. The men first talked about casual things like the weather and their families, nothing special or interesting there. They also assured Davis that his cat was being taken care of, something that make Ron almost choke on holding in a laugh. The sight of Davis with a cat was apparently too amusing to his best mate.
to take it. That very day when he was called to the drawing room, seated upon one of the chairs. Father entered the room only minutes later, placing a hand atop his son's shoulder.
But Draco's day wasn't over yet. As he entered the carriage, he immediately noticed something was off. There were no girls lounging on the sofas and the fireplace was extinguished. Only a long, slender figure was seated upon her usual purple sofa, her hands folded together. 'Draco,' she said. Her expression was blank but Draco could read the fury in her eyes; she was mad about something. She was mad at
Madame gave him a weak smile and focused her green eyes on Harry again. 'Are you going to hide in
would be up for many dangerous challenges once chosen. If something went wrong; she would be partly to blame.
But he hadn't, and a bright smile now spread across his face.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
‘Draco,’ a voice then said. His muscles relaxed. A vague feeling of composure overcame him. He lifted his head, lifted his eyes, but the calm feeling turned into fury as he saw whom it was that had called his name. His father stood on the other side of scene, behind Voldemort with his arms opened wide — ready to have his son returned to him and welcome back with a smile. 'Come, Draco.' A gesture, meant to be inviting and loving but turning into a triggering factor. His mother standing beside him, a look of worry on her face.
The words were meant to seduce him, he know. To perhaps trigger the side of him that had once been brought forward by the locket. Voldemort wanted Draco on his side again, but Draco would never let him be convinced of anything greater than what he already had. Being treated in Voldemort's ears meant being evil, murder, a ruler everyone feared. Draco didn't want to be feared; he wanted to be loved. He wanted to tell Voldemort this, he wanted to shout those words at him but his mind failed, his mouth unable to form words.
'Yes, Hermione — we're sure.' Harry hiked up the sandy hill with great difficulty. He was tired, Draco noticed, but they all were.
Draco dragged his friends off the sofa by pulling their sleeves. 'What makes you think he's defeated? Maybe Dumbledore has lost or
father is a Death Eater,' he shouted.
Harry wasn't sure wether Hermione's charm would hold up, but he had to have faith in his best friend's skills. He didn't know what he looked like, but it apparently worked well enough as the Snatchers didn't recognize him as Harry Potter anymore — or at least, not
Confused, Draco pulls his hand out of Potter's and stands up. Pushing an imaginary strand of hair out of his face he tries to focus on something else that is not Potter's face. 'I-I think it's time for you to go.'
Draco asked and she nodded with a little smile.
The woman then was the one to sigh. As she cradled her baby a little in her arms, she gave Draco a firm nod. ‘
The way Potter stands there, as if he
'I'm going to the Ministry anyway, Hermione. And you either go with me or stay here,' he declared.
'And, what do you think?' Harry asked him as he followed Draco's eyes. He chuckled at the sight of his own moving photograph but didn't mention it.
It was already after midnight when the last Gryffindors wandered off to bed, leaving a drunk on Butterbeer Dean and Ron behind upon one of the sofas. They were still chatting about Quidditch and that they missed it so much this year. Harry had joined their conversation at first but as Hermione had drooped away to bed as well, he had preferred Draco's company over that of his friends. They were laying on the rug in front of the fireplace, talking about nothing in particular. 'Do you know what you want to be after seventh-year?' Harry suddenly asked.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Draco was enough to make him go green.
The boy shrugged and picked up his broom again. 'Want to try?' Harry swung his leg over the wood as if it was the most normal thing in the world and reached out his hand. Draco hesitantly took it and stood behind Harry. 'Hold on tight!' The boy said to him and before Draco could even react or tell him to wait, Harry took off with great speed.
. Seventy-three years graced the old woman's face as she scowled at the twins for running down hallways, hexing first years and not wearing their uniforms properly. A few girls that Draco was befriended with apparently also missed him terribly; their hair hadn't looked worse in years! Draco grinned at the thought of them, hair a mess like Harry's always was. The thought of Harry had made him feel nauseous and with a sigh he had pushed the letter away.
, Draco.' Madame's voice contained a hint of rage and Draco knew he had to watch his words; she could turn into her furious self any second now.
. That was how he felt. As if he was drowning in complete darkness with people cheering above his head; encouraging to suffocate for a few seconds longer. But then he suddenly could breathe again and warmth started to flow through his veins. He looked at his fingers and noticed webbing had grown between each of the five. Same went for his toes and when he lifted a hand to his neck, he felt the texture of gills and small scales.
,' Malfoy says to him, this time a little louder than a whisper. The use of his given name makes Harry's heart jump again and his palms sweat; he's sure Malfoy will notice it too.
'Didn't I just tell you not to be sorry?'
Silence almost immediately fell upon them like a heavy blanket, and Harry took it as his cue to close his eyes and try to drift off into sleep. Yet his mind wouldn't let him rest; all too curious wether Draco would sit there and watch him all night long like he said he would — or wether he would do something else, go away or whatever it was that angels did during the night.
eyes,' was his reply, but the twins still weren't convinced his mother's eyes were any better.
‘Fleur,’ he whispered again. Her eyes then opened slowly, blinking a few times before taking in Draco’s face.
'I wasn't done with it yet!' Draco sneered at her, picking up the comb but handing it to Fleur anyway.
'While we were at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament,' she explained. 'It was maybe a few weeks after we arrived. I had taken my camera with me to show the other students back at Beauxbatons what Hogwarts was like — and one day I spotted Draco in his little outfit and thought he looked really
It had slipped off Draco's tongue and hearing it out of the boy's mouth suddenly made him realize he had actually said it. ‘Er — I — shall we just go? I'm really cold,' he said, avoiding the subject.
'Evil?' Harry replied. 'He just gave me his wand!'
,' he whispered and a bright light appeared at the end of his wand. 'Who— Who's there?'
. I know you wanted to visited
Harry remained silent as he seated himself around the small table as well. Golden laid in the palm of his hand again as he stared at Draco's timepiece, taken out of his trouser's pocket. 'Do you think—,' Hermione started, but by the look on Harry's face she didn't even need to finish the sentence to know what he was thinking.
'Tomorrow is September first, maman,' Draco stated, looking away from his mother's tormented eyes. 'I must go into town and gather supplies for the new school year. Has my letter arrived yet?'
After a few minutes and taking secret passageways he'd found during all his walks to- and from school, Harry finally managed to lose Dudley and his friends. Slowing down his pace, he turned around and walked a little backwards to see if they really were gone. A cold wind blew in his face, his figure shivering and missing the warmth of his jacket. As he turned around again, Harry's clumsy feet slipped over an icy part on the road. Falling onto his bum he cursed out loud before quickly crawling up again. His mind was set on going back home, continuing his walk, but his feet stayed on the ground as if glued. Harry found himself unable move after he'd seen that car —
The wards warned Draco that someone had set foot on the Malfoy property; it was just something he, as the Malfoy heir, could feel. Ancient magic twinkling within his soul. Of course it had to be Potter, who else would visit the Manor at an hour that late.
As the silence grew to its peak and Draco decided it may have been a mistake to follow Harry to Hogsmeade in the first place, Harry finally opened his mouth. 'I do, you know,' the boy said. It came out only a little louder than a whisper.
Wearing Molly's jumper with pride, Draco flew back to the forest surrounding the Manor. His lips still tingled with Harry's last kiss and he wished he could feel the slight bruising for more days to come. Landing without a sound he took a look around and heard the wind whisper in his ears, blow by and never return again. With his broom shrunken, he started his search of finding the rotten apple that would once again serve as his Portkey; that would take him back to Beauxbatons. He knew Madame Maxime always sent it to the forest; even when he actually
Harry shook his head.

Disclaimer: I don't own anything Harry Potter. Also this is my first ever Drarry/Magical fic and my Mother language also isn't English so please excuse any mistakes I made.
'I'm just so happy to see you again,' the boy said, kissing Draco's lips, neck and every other visible part of skin before getting interrupted by the couching of a ginger-haired woman.
Next up was Krum who took out a dragon with fine gold spikes around its face, blowing a bit of fire into the air. 'A Chinese Fireball,' Crouch declared and gave him the same wide-eyed look he had given Fleur. Krum only clenched his jaw and stared at Karakov whom didn't seem to react to the dragons at all. Diggory got a Swedish Short-Snout and seemed to be the only one surprised by the dragons; perhaps nobody had told him the first task had any involved. But hadn't he heard the boy's father whisper about dragons to him earlier? Perhaps the sudden look of one had just frightened the boy.
'You won't say,' he replied with a smirk. If there was one thing he knew Harry was known for beside from being
, in Fleur’s room?
‘Er —
It would be the third time for Draco to visit the Headmaster's office; the first time had been unwillingly, the second one out of desperation and now he was finally invited properly. And yet he was still amazed by how interesting the room was compared to the other rooms he had seen at Hogwarts. It's circular shape, the many portraits of previous Headmasters and the funny little sounds you could hear if you listened carefully; as if little creatures were hiding beneath every piece of furniture.
As they entered the hallway of the seventh floor, Draco already started looking around to catch a glimpse of blond or green somewhere; searching for Castor whom usually showed up out of an alcove or came striding from around a corner. He liked to surprise Draco and scare him; make the French jump a little as he walked over to him in a sneaky way. Today was no different as the git suddenly appeared from one of the darker parts of the hallway; a smirk gracing his face as he gestured towards the blank wall which slowly exposed a grand door.
He had also written long letters to Sirius, explaining everything that had happened the past year, but every response he got had been short, only a few sentences long and very prompt. It was as if everyone who mattered to him, beside from Draco, were avoiding him.
A weird smile appeared on Hermione's face as she tried to convince herself that everything would be alright. Ron seemed to be fine with it all, was already focussing his mind on something else — Quidditch probably, if Harry could guess, as he was the only Wizard to think about such futilities amidst the serious. Hunger no longer occupied his mind, so Harry's feet dragged himself back into the hallway — back up the stairs and into the empty room to be alone again. As he sat down, it suddenly hit him that they were going to Draco's home the day after — and that there was a chance the blond boy would be there as well.
; he's calling for his help quite desperately. And
Not really being able to deny that fact, Harry sighed. 'Alright then — we'll go tomorrow. You have the location of a forest nearby, right?'
' Draco laid his eyes on the raven-haired boy again; his long eyelashes closed against his cheeks. Suddenly, he saw how much his lover had changed compared to the time they had met; his jawline was more prominent, his cheekbones as well. His skin seemed a bit more rough, his hands stronger. Had his own self changed? He didn't know. His eyes glanced at Hermione, lost in her own thoughts again. She didn't look like the cute girl from fourth-year anymore either. They had all aged without realizing — because although they were still children somehow, they had never had the chance to truly be one. Let alone become adults.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
'Well,' Dumbledore started. 'Unfortunately Voldemort escaped. The Minister and his Aurors finally showed up during our final duel and seemed to scare him away — even though I don't believe '
To his horror, it wasn't Castor that was standing there — the caster of the Death Curse.
With that said, Draco hurries himself back upstairs, through hallways, around corridors until he reaches his room and slams the door shut with a loud
Draco answered them all after getting pulled onto one of the sofas as well, surrounded by each and every girl including Fleur. Fleur even seemed to be the most curious and Draco wasn't really sure if she was trying to get some information she could use for the final task at the same time. But he didn't care; Harry was an open book anyway. When they were finally satisfied with their six-hundred-and-one love-related questions answered, Draco changed into a pair of fitted trousers and tied up his hair again. The girls waved him off with the cheekiest of smiles and in the twilight he wandered back to the castle, a grin wider than the Cheshire's cat upon his face.
'Here you go,' the boy said to him with a nervous smile.
'But that's impossible! I can't breathe underwater! No-one can! How am I supposed to do that?'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
him. How much more weird can the world get?
With that said, the woman with her wild curls stands up and leaves the room; probably on her way to the library in their house with Rose still in her arms. Ron stares at the spot where Hermione sat for another few seconds before facing his best friend again.
This first sign of the curse had been revealed to Draco during his trial,
To his surprise, the
"Thought humans weren't able to see angels? So how would you know when you've never communicated with one."
'He's evil?'
. Another rose breaks her stem.
Many theories went through Harry's mind as he blankly stared at a piece of parchment in front of him, placed on a wooden desk where he was seated to make his O.W.L.s exam. He had dozed off again, he realized, and stared at the parchment where he had only answered the first three questions — still had one-hundredth-forty-five to go. A loud sigh escaped his mouth, followed by the quick hushing of Umbridge's voice. He glanced up to see her eyes look in his direction; her puffy figure dressed in elaborate pink and the bow on her head larger than usual — perhaps she was celebrating the downfall of the fifth-years their exam points already before even correcting them.
Harry can't help but swallow with the subject of his thoughts only at an arm length away. He shakes his head again and wants to look away, yet he finds himself incapable of doing so. Grey eyes are locked in his with more determination than ever. 'You would laugh,' he whispers. Dearly he hopes Malfoy didn't hear it but by the deepening of the blond's frown, he probably did.
'You look awful,' was the first thing he said to Draco.
Swallowing at her words, Harry couldn't help but agree— but Draco was in danger and wether it was real or not, he wouldn't take the risk of having him die. He loved him too much for that. He hadn't spent enough time with him yet. They were supposed to remain together until the end of time — until they would become as old as Nicolas Flamel. Until—
Draco took a deep breath. 'Look, it doesn't matter what happened or who you're friends with or
, Harry took away the wand of Narcissa Malfoy. He threw it in Hermione's direction, who in her place retrieved the wand of Lucius Malfoy with a single flick. That one was thrown at Ron, and their last opponent was looking at them with a horrified look upon her face, but Bellatrix still seemed confident — ready to blast a curse that would hit all three of them at the same time.
One thing was sure; Draco had to find out more about that boy. Of course he knew who it was;
Today however, as he left the gates and turned to his right, someone snatched him by the collar of his jacket. Breath caught as he got dragged backwards a little, pushed against a wall. "Where you think you're going, Potty?" Dudley stood in front of him; tall and bulbous, a smirk upon his chubby face. A few of his friends lingered around too, all wearing the same kind of smiles.
Growing up at your aunt's house, together with her husband and son, perhaps didn't sound so bad — that was, unless your aunt's name was Petunia Dursley. From the moment Harry'd been brought into her house at Private Drive number four, he'd been despised by the slender, surly woman. She'd given him
? What does that have to do with anything?' The boy asked, eyebrows frown and a hint of desperation visible in his eyes again.
Draco searches for the lie in Potter's eyes but can't seem to find it. Should he be disappointed by Potter's honesty or rather disgusted? Does he even
, it's not a good idea,' he said to the boy. 'Can't we do something else?' He took a step closer and placed his hands on Harry's chest. A cheeky look into the boy's eyes and Draco was convinced he could make Harry forget all about Quidditch; but he was wrong.
'Shall we go upstairs?' he asks Potter after a minute of silence. A nod follows and together they walk up the stairs, Potter remembering the way perfectly. Is it an Auror thing? Who knows.
, a little voice told him and Draco couldn't agree more. They were dressed in blue as well — as all boys and girls at the school — and were radiating a certain allure that was very distinct for a Beauxbatons' student. 'Someone helped me escape; and then I helped them escape as well,' Draco answered the twins.
"Heaven, of course."

; he had ideas he could only dream of having.
Harry sighed. 'I know — but that doesn't mean he can't hear me out. He did ask, however, how I knew about this attack. I told him the truth about the nature of my nightmares — and before I knew it I was getting dragged down to the dungeons by professor Snape.'
had another guardian angel — simply because he could've called out to his brother, asked for help. It wasn't reality, however, and Draco had to manage on his own.
Draco let out a deep sigh and shook his head. '
Draco smirked at her words. 'Someone had to help Harry when his friends had abandoned him.'
With that said, he starts his way up the stairs, not even looking if Harry's following or not. But of course Harry does follow him; he's way too curious for that. He also follows Malfoy through many hallways and around corridors, wondering just where he’s taking him. The blond's feet come to a halt in front of a large black door, engraved with the depiction of a dragon entangled with a snake. Harry doesn’t even need to ask what lays behind, as it’s obviously Malfoy’s chambers.
Krum was the second one to leave; looking less nervous than Diggory but also not quite confidence himself. Karkarov gave him a pat on his back as he stared into the boy's eyes. They seemed to radiate a certain

'I-I wanted to tell you about the first task. Got some information about it… That is, if you are interested of course,' he replied.
Harry's confusion only seemed to grow. 'About the first task?'
'He's related to me, isn't he?'
Another set of doors opened before Aaron could answer Draco, followed by the light footsteps of another angel Draco knew all too well. "God wants to speak to you, Draco." Gabriel's gaze was kind and understanding, his hands folded together. An ethereal glow always seemed to radiate from the archangels, and even though Draco was an immortal, Godly creature himself, he still remained fascinated and perhaps oddly mesmerized by their presence, no matter how many times he'd met them.
Fleur nudged him in his side and gave him a glare. Obviously she had noticed he was staring and behaving weirdly, something she couldn't have. Fleur had the habit of wanting to know everything that was going on, especially when it came to Draco. 'Why do you keep staring at
Snape drew back again and Harry felt his heart race; drops of sweat run down his forehead as he tried to figure out what was reality and what wasn't. 'That's — that's private!' he managed to get out, looking up into Snape's eyes.
. And Draco couldn't help but feel that it was because of him.
As they had neared Courtroom Ten, Harry had spotted a familiar man already from afar; Lucius Malfoy, talking to a man in great suspicion. He had followed Harry with his eyes as if he had been a prey; ready to attack at any moment. Worried, the man had looked but extremely wary as well. And Harry hadn't been able to stop thinking that his son was hiding amongst his enemies without him knowing. The humor.
Robert Nicholas’ first question is toward Shawn, asking him to explain how a pilot flies a plane without magic. The second is, “Professor, is it true that you joined the quidditch team in your first year?”
“You’re pacing.” Draco points out.
“I can come with you.” It’s the third time Draco has said it since they left Hogwarts for Hogsmeade in the morning. Harry is almost tempted to say yes.
When class is done and the children start leaving the classroom Harry calls for Holly to stay behind. She gives Rose a nervous glance but Rose quickly promises to wait outside and leaves her alone.
Harry’s heart races still, but now for a new and much more pleasant person. He wants to say that he loves Draco. What comes out instead is, “I’ve never slept with Snape.”
Most of their time is up by the time the questions are done with and Harry uses it to go over the titles of their first few lessons and the requirements he has for them.
“She’s eleven, of course she doesn’t bother me. It’s just...” He sighs. Draco is done with his sleeves and just holding his wrist now, a thumb softly stroking the soft skin there. “I don’t know what to make of it. She’s here so obviously, if she’s Dudley’s kid, he didn’t manage to hide her away and try to lock her magic out. But I don’t know what her home life is like. I don’t want to stand by and do nothing if something
“She is fine. She’s a bright kid and I’m told she has a knack for potions already.” Harry smiles. “And she made fast friends with my best friends’ daughter, Rose. And I can guarantee Rose is a wonderful girl.”
Draco rubs circles on his back and guides him to sit down. “You aren’t fuming so I’m taking that as a good sign.”
---------
Once the introductions conclude and it’s question time the class has become more lively. It works like a charm every time, giving the children a safe space to settle into their new environment and get a feel for both him as a teacher and each other as a class.
She pours everyone a cup and sits down next to Dudley on the couch.
Dudley stops her with a hand on her leg and a laugh. “Easy, dear, let him breathe. We would love to have you over, though.” He adds to Harry. “If you would be interested some day.”
“Any reason we’re not heading to lunch yet?”
The trance is broken when McGonagall calls Rose’s name and the Gryffindor table starts cheering even before she’s at the stool. She doesn’t seem very nervous as she sits down though Harry sees her inhale deeply after several seconds. A few more and the hat bellows a loud ‘Ravenclaw!’ and for a moment the Hall is silent, then the Ravenclaw table booms with cheer and applause, while the Gryffindors are left looking baffled. The first Weasley in known history to not be sorted in Gryffindor. A small part of Harry is quite satisfied with that development. Rose has always been too curious and clever for her own good, her thirst for understanding of the world will bloom in Ravenclaw.
“Do I look daft to you?” The quip is undermined by the softness in the curve of Draco’s mouth. It’s been years since the words between them held any real bite. “Does she bother you?”
“Huh?”
Harry gives him a hopeful look. “Is that a possibility?”
“Yes. Well, meet my cousin Harry.” Dudley gestures at Harry who offers a smile in return.
“It’s about that girl, isn’t it?” Draco hums quietly and takes his other wrist, eyes staying on Harry’s hands. “Dursley.”
“She’s a teacher too? How delightful!”
“Oh. I’m sorry.” He’s not.
“You look tense.” Harry glances over his shoulder to see Draco standing at the door, then continues fiddling with his cufflinks. Why did he even buy a robe that requires cufflinks?
Draco pushes some parchment aside and reaches his hand over the desk. Harry takes it gratefully and relishes in the feeling of Draco’s thumb caressing his knuckles.
“I like superheroes too!” A boy from the next row over pipes up, and both of them seem relieved at it. Both muggleborn then.
Harry nods. “One of them, yes. I teach Defence Against The Dark Arts.”
“I said it went well.” Harry pulls away just a little. “They are… They are actually good people. Dudley, he has changed into a person I don’t recognize. His wife gave me sweets to bring home.”
Dudley’s smile doesn’t reach his eyes. “She is… Complicated.”
And then Dudley asks about him. He asks if Harry had played quidditch, what house he’d been in and if he’d become a prefect or a head boy. Both of their faces pale when Harry tells them he didn’t get to go to his seventh year because of the war. They ashen when Harry explains more about the war. Dudley had known something big had happened but it isn’t until Harry is talking about the destruction that he really seems to understand. He apologises again after that, and Harry thanks him for it.
“Talk to McGonagall to arrange a meeting.” Draco offers.
They decided to have breakfast together at the village and then Harry would apparate for the Dursley’s place.
“I’m aware, professor, but you also know this isn’t a regular situation.” Harry insists. “Had I known of her arrival earlier I would have done this before the school started at all.”
Dinner progresses once the last child is sorted and Harry manages to put Holly more or less out of his mind when the food appears on his plate. Merlin, he’s missed the food. Neville engages him in a conversation about teaching plans while both of them shovel chicken and potatoes in their mouths, and by the end of the night Holly is a name lost in the crowd for him.
The silence that follows rings in Harry’s ears. Dudley is holding tight onto Maria’s hand and Harry finds himself wishing he had one to hold as well.
The other muggleborn kid is named Shawn Monroe and he used to want to become a pilot.
Maria’s smile doesn’t waver for a second. “You two should come over for dinner some time!”
She seems to understand what that means because there’s sadness in her eyes when she says ‘Oh’.
” Harry hides his face again and breathes in his partner’s scent. It’s all herbs and potions now. Home. “They want us to go over for dinner some time.”
Rose giggles at the cat part but says nothing. It’s Draco’s cat, Dipper, and she hated him for a solid year after Draco rescued her. Rose is well aware of that fact. Dipper adores Rose, and the entire Weasley family she’s been in contact with.
“Do I?” He asks, growing impatient with the bloody things, his movements almost growing frantic before Draco steps in and bats his hand away. He takes Harry’s wrist in one hand and uses the other to neatly undo the cufflink.
“No.” He says and he means it. “I didn’t save everyone. I fought in the war like everyone else and I helped win it. But I wouldn’t have been able to do what I did without everyone who fought. Without professor Longbottom, or professor Hagrid, Rose’s parents and family, professor Malfoy. We all did what we had to do. And we all lost people and things dear to us. We didn’t fight or win to be heroes, and I don’t want you to see me as such, okay?”
She bows her head and quickly skips out of the room.
-------

“You were a massive arse.” He says in the end. “But you were a kid. We were kids. I’m glad to see we’ve both changed.”
Harry feels like she’s afraid she’ll offend him. “No.” He smiles at her. “But I grew up in a muggle family.”
“Um, yes. He is.”
“Some day.” Harry echoes and it seems good enough for his cousin.
“Are the stories true? Did you really… Save everyone during the war?”
“You don’t have to be.” Maria takes Dudley’s hand. “He was a bitter man, angry at the world for not being uniform to him. After… After

“Hello. My name is professor Harry Potter, some of you may have heard about me already, and I will be teaching Defence Against The Dark Arts this, and hopefully, the following years, too.” He begins his usual speech. “In my class there are no bad students, and everyone will be valued to the extent of their abilities. As such I would appreciate it if everyone gave their personal best with me, and didn’t worry about, or compare themselves to others. We’re here to learn, not to compete.” The children share a few glances but otherwise remain silent. “Now, as it is our first day I would like us to get to know each other a little. Here’s how it’s going to go. Starting from you,” he points at the round-faced boy by the door, “you will say your name and a little something about you. Once everyone is introduced we will go again but this time you get to ask me and classmate one question each. How does it sound?”
Dudley is as big as Harry remembers him, and at the same time he’s not. He doesn’t look like an overgrown baby anymore, the years shaping him into a big man instead. It suits him. He looks better. He also looks utterly shocked, once Harry’s eyes reach his face.
“Dursley, Holly.”
“What? They could accept magic but frown upon queer relationships, I had to cover all my bases.” He pulls away again in order to look Draco in the eye. “And don’t tell me you wouldn’t like to show off a little.”
She takes a breath through her nose and cocks her head to one side. “Unfortunately I left this year's student list to be handled solely by my Deputy, the blame for which falls on me. Had I known earlier, I would have informed you.” She pulls her lips in a thin line. “I am more than aware of your concerns and I do share them. However, before I authorise this meeting I do have to warn you that you are under no circumstance to take matters into your own hands should you not like the result of your visit.”
“Hello. I’m uh… I’m here for the parent-teacher meeting.”
Harry stops pacing. “I’m not.”
“Not happy you chose to send Holly to school?”
A short dark-skinned boy is sorted into Hufflepuff and Harry’s eyes follow him to the table, almost missing the next name McGonagall calls.
“She didn’t try to stop me or anything. But she’s heavy set on pretending Holly is attending a Christian all-girl boarding school. Even in private.” He heaves a sigh. “It’s okay. She lives on the other end of the country anyway.”
Robert doesn’t seem convinced of the danger but accepts his answer well enough. The questions fly after that.
A small, dirty blond girl emerges from behind Rose who gives her a pat on the shoulder and a thumbs up as she shakily sits on the stool. Her back is to Harry but her shoulders are so high up that he can tell she’s squeezing her eyes shut. The hat ponders it for several long moments before proclaiming a loud ‘Ravenclaw!’, making the Ravenclaw table erupt in loud cheers. With her shoulders still tense but a wide smile on her lips she shuffles over to the table and sits down next to the last kid sorted in.
“My name is Robert Nicholas,” the first boy starts. “And I want to be a captain of the quidditch team one day.” He looks a little hesitant but Harry gives him a big smile.
She chuckles. “Dad might disown me.”
Maria’s first priority is to ask after her daughter’s well being. “Is she okay there? I know what she says in her letters, but she doesn’t like complaining and I know she wouldn’t want to worry us.”
