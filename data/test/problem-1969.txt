Potter shrugged on past him without another word, his fingers now gripping the back of Draco’s sweatshirt and pulling them inside the building.  They made their way quickly up to their floor and once there Draco tried to head back to his room.  Potter wouldn’t have that though, and tugged him along to his own room, kicking open the door with his foot.  Draco could barely see with the blood covering his face, but he felt Potter’s hands shift to his shoulders and pushed him down to sit on a soft surface.  A bed.  Potter’s bed.  Oh Merlin, he hoped it was Potter’s bed.
“Still,” he started as he opened the door to his room.  “I should have asked.  I’ve been so busy with Potter, I’ve forgotten.”
“Right,” Ginny grinned knowingly, looking between both men.  “Well, that makes me feel a little bit better about all of this then.  Just didn’t want to get too involved with this one if he was just going to leave me for his friend.  Been there, done that.  Not bitter about the Dean thing not working out, just don’t want to get too invested if you know what I mean.”
was almost too much.  But Harry helped him with gentle hands, guiding him to the bed and settling him amongst the pillows.  Draco was the one watching now, as Harry slowly removed his pajamas.  Draco stopped breathing entirely when Harry’s hard cock sprang free, red and flushed and leaking.  Harry pressed his hand against himself, biting his lower lip.  “You just...look really good.  In my bed...”
“Maybe he was just in shock or something,” she shrugged, finishing off her coffee.  “Has he done anything else since you moved in there?”
“You’re not the brightest spell in the book, are you?”  She pulled out the jumper and placed it on the bed next to him.  “He wants to take you somewhere fancy because he knows
“A dance?  Here?”  Draco raised an eyebrow, questioningly.  Still, he couldn’t help but slip his hand into Harry’s, their fingers tangling.
When Draco opened his eyes, Pansy had already left him on the couch and had joined the boys in the kitchen.  She was reaching for a lemon bar.  “Pansy!” he wailed.
Harry reached across the table for his hand.  His hand was warm and slightly sweaty, and Draco admired his golden skin against Draco’s very pale complexion.  “Draco, if it was a one-time thing, I wouldn’t have kissed you in front of our friends.  I had to take some time, to think about what all this means.  I’ve been gone because I had to confide in Hermione in all of this.  We’re trying to work together on how best to reveal it all to Ron.”
Whining, one of Draco’s hands at Harry’s back slipped to his arse.  He gripped tight at the clenched muscle, which seemed to spur Harry on even more.  They were shifting together now, each trying to get that much closer, push that much further in.  Draco, already so close to begin with, felt a sharp spike of pleasure and screamed.  Harry panted, biting softly at Draco’s jaw and stroking him in time to their faster pace.  He could tell Draco was close, feeling him throbbing under his fingers.
?  He knew it was going to end someday, knew it was all coming to a point.  He dreaded thinking of the next time his Mark would flare—he wasn’t ready to go.  He was never ready for that.  If his Mark burned and Draco left, what would he find at the end of that summon?
“Pfft,” Harry dismissed that idea quickly.  “Now you just know how it feels anytime someone walks in on you guys.  We’ll behave, won’t we, Draco?”
“Hey,” he called, his arms lifted as he was draping the garland around the top section of the tree.  Draco looked over, and Merlin help him, Potter’s sweater had ridden up revealing a stripe of golden skin.  “Mind making me a cup?” he asked, completely oblivious to the crisis Draco was now in.
Sliding his fingers out, Harry nodded, his mouth and throat suddenly dry and the words unable to form.  He hissed, rubbing the lube along himself, not really realizing his own arousal and how close he was himself.  He was so lost, just on Draco alone.  Lining himself up, his eyes locked with Draco’s.  The look they shared just about did him in, and Harry couldn’t help his name falling from his lips as he finally, finally, pushed inside.
Rose watched them walk past her and continue on towards the banquet hall.  They certainly made quite a striking pair, and most of their guests turned to get a good look at the couple.  A murmur started to rise up throughout the crowd as they passed, Blaise basking in the extra attention; Ginny not phased at all.  Perhaps, being involved with Potter and playing for an international team allowed her to cope with the attention.  She carried herself well, confident in her strides along with Blaise.
Pausing, his eyes lifted to Draco’s face.  He was panting, fair hair in a tangled mess along the cushions.  His skin illuminated from the fireplace and surrounding candles of the Christmas tree.  “Yes, Draco?”  Harry asked, swallowing.  His fingers had unhooked the last button and now they rested hesitantly at Draco’s waistband.
Ginny tilted her head inquisitively.  “Just what exactly did she give you?  I don’t think she’s given us anything yet this holiday season...”
Laughing, Harry came over and helped him up off the couch.  He pulled him close, Harry wrapping his arm around Draco’s waist.  “I was sort of thinking...of just a quiet night at home.  If that’s all right with you...”
Potter’s face broke out into a grin, the lights from the Christmas tree making him practically sparkle in the glow.  It wasn’t fair, really—how he could look like
It wasn’t till the flames had died back to their original color before the room erupted into noise once more.
“No, he just died and came back.  Just a simple trick like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, really,” her eyes shined as she looked over at Draco.  He rolled his eyes right back at her and was about to respond when Blaise finally reappeared.
Harry’s throat was dry, his palms sweating, and he just knew his pajamas were doing nothing to conceal his current state.  It was his sheer willpower that kept him seated.  He wanted very much to leap onto Draco and strip him out of his posh clothes, but he needed to remain somewhat calm.  He had to give Draco a choice, he didn’t need to rush this.  But somehow the frantic and eager thoughts of his brain spilled out of his lips and before he knew it, he was asking, “Tonight?”  When his words rang back, Harry clenched his eyes shut and winced.  Merlin, Draco would probably think he was an overeager pervert.  But perhaps, to some extent, he was.  He couldn’t stop thinking about Draco and his virginity and Harry getting the chance to—
Under that gaze, Draco couldn’t possibly look away even if he tried.  “Oh...um, yes.  It was quite lovely.”  They were talking about the cd, weren’t they?
“Oh, Draco,” she smirked.  She stood up and embraced him for a moment before leaning in to kiss his cheek.  “He’s smitten, darling.  Absolutely smitten.”
Pansy laughed, pulling Draco along with her.  “Can you believe it?” she asked him as they traveled the last stretch to her flat.  “Christmastime already?”
Harry ran his fingers along Draco’s hand, his smile warming.  “I told him I’m seeing this new guy, that I’m absolutely mad over.  That I think what we have could be something serious.  That I’d really
serious,” Draco’s eyes widened, staring at them.  He drank the remaining champagne in his flute and handed it off to a passing waiter.
“No,” Draco responded, his voice firm.  As much as he wanted to be Potter’s friend (and who was he kidding, that was something he
Malfoy snorted, as he bent down to slip into his Auror boots.  “Bringing him in, what else would I do Potter?  Don’t want him killing any more people.  That’d be bad, don’t you think?”
She snorted, pulling away from their hug and dragging him by the hand.  “Please, how would he even be able to do his job with the whole world fawning at his feet?  Any time he’d be out in the field, I can just see the general public catching a glimpse of him and blowing his cover.  It’s not practical at all, honestly.”
“Of course,” he answered, trying his best to smile.  Her gaze saw right through that, and Draco tried his hardest not to slink back.  Another moment and she’d closed her door.  He took a deep breath, then looked around to make sure no one was watching before he apparated.
he liked Potter as much as he did.  It was just something that sort of just happened.  Yes, he very much liked him for saving everyone (and particularly for Draco concerning the Room of Hidden Things).  But that certainly wasn’t the only reason Draco liked Harry.  There were countless reasons, but Draco figured it might be too early to express this.  He didn’t want to scare the other man away.  It was merely their first date, after all.
She waved her hand, trying to abate the situation.  “Oh, do calm down.  We all know, we’ve known since second year.  It’s kind of an unspoken truth throughout Gryffindor and Slytherin.  Watch Harry Potter obsess over Malfoy.  Watch Malfoy act oblivious to the whole thing, while secretly he loves all the attention! Harry Potter has had a fixation on you, always has to come in and save the day.  Saving you from fiendfyre, saving you from Azkaban.  Then there’s you, and Draco you think you’re discrete but it’s so fucking obvious.”
.  Draco’s head darted to the Christmas tree, and all of the lights lit up brilliantly.  Bright red ornaments appeared out of nowhere, a strand of matching garland draped itself over the mantelpiece, and a wreath settled above the fireplace.
.  Instead of outright answering him, Draco attempted to redirect the conversation.  “And just what exactly is your type Potter?”
“Merlin, we have Gryffindors,” Draco muttered, taking a large gulp out of his own glass.  “What has happened to us?”
He turned back around, despite everything.  He knew this wasn’t a good idea, but what the hell.  The alcohol running through his veins made him care even less.  “What?” he asked, arms crossing over his chest.
“Oh,” Draco gripped the banister.  He was still standing on the staircase looking down to Harry.  He made to walk the last step, only to stop when he saw Harry close in their distance.
“It’s ok, Draco,” Dean reached for his hand and gave it a friendly squeeze.  “Just be honest with him.  He’s used to people lying to him all the time, trying to get his attention.  Just be yourself around him, let him know how you’re feeling.  I can guarantee he’d like you even more for that.”
Joining Draco on the bed at last, Harry wrapped his body around him.  And Draco was lost, so very lost in the feel of Harry everywhere.
“All right, I guess,” he agreed reluctantly.  He really didn’t want to have this talk with Harry, but with how quick things have heated up, he knew he might need to tell him sooner or later.
Chuckling, Harry leaned in and kissed at the sensitive spot behind his ear.  Trust Potter to zero in right at his weakness and go for the kill.  Draco was a shuddering mess under him when Harry finally replied, “I’d do it right here or anywhere else you want.  I don’t care.  I just very much want to suck your cock.  Right now.”
“Harry, please,” Draco pleaded, his eyes clenching shut.  He could feel a hot rushing feeling forming at the base of his spine, and he knew he was too close.  He needed Harry inside him, and soon.
Because of course Dean Thomas had to burst open the door to Potter’s room at just that moment.  Draco’s face felt on fire and automatically he stood up from the bed and ran.
“Just make sure he takes his time preparing you.  Just use lots of lube,” Seamus grinned cheekily, but faltered at the look Draco gave him across the table.  “Er, or you take time preparing him?  I didn’t mean to assume you were the bottom!  I have no idea, sorry for bringing it up!”
“Ugh, this feels just like fourth year all over again, except entirely worse because I’m actually going to ask him this time...”  Draco’s eyes widened in shock as soon as the words left his mouth and he paled.  Seamus dropped his cup in shock, thankfully Dean was right there to grab it before it spilled all over.  Draco let out a small manic laugh, cursing himself silently as he felt his whole face burn.
Harry laughed, pulling Draco back down with him.  Draco allowed himself to be kissed lazily, but then drew back and looked at him curiously.  “Oh fine,” pouted Harry.  “I like Christmas.  I’ve accumulated a lot of decorations since the War, people giving me ornaments and the like.  I couldn’t possibly throw it all away...”
“Oh, um, there’s a story to all that.”  He laughed nervously, then reached over and pulled out a stray twig of holly from her bob.
“Have you seen it?” Pansy leaned over, whispering.  Or rather, she tried to whisper.  Pansy was never quiet nor subtle about anything.
He ran a hand through his hair, smoothing it in place.  “Perhaps.  It’s sort of complicated though.  With her on the road and travelling so much, she doesn’t have a place of her own.  When she’s in town she Floo’s here from the Burrow and that’s all right, I guess.  I just wanted to give her the option, really.  I wanted to let her know when she’s in London she can just come home, to me.  I want her to be here.  I want her to feel like she can always be here.  If that makes any sense...”
Then the pace quickened, and Draco started to pant.  There was no way he could hide what this was doing to him anymore.  At last, he slipped his fingers inside Harry’s mess of hair and tugged tight.  “Fuck,” he exhaled shakily.  His thighs were trembling, and Harry’s fingers were gripping him so hard, they were sure to leave bruises.  He knew if Harry wasn’t holding him down though, there’d be no way Draco would have stayed still.  “I’m going to,” he mumbled, feeling so close already.
Draco felt his lips tug at the corners, and he gave Harry a hesitant smile.  “I want you too,” he said simply.
“Right,” he smiled once more.  Why was Blaise Zabini so fucking attractive?  Draco tried to not stare too closely at his perfectly refined jawline, or those tempting lips.  They’d briefly had a thing at Hogwarts, but it was purely physical.  He had too many love interests, and Draco was a jealous person.  It never would have worked out.
“Harry!”  Draco shrieked, feeling himself shoot all over Harry’s fingers in a hot rush.  Harry watched Draco’s release, his neck pulled back and veins along his neck popping.  His channel gripped Harry’s cock, the pressure taking a hold of him and pulling out his own orgasm.  He fucked him through his release, Draco screaming and scratching lines along his back.  It wasn’t till Draco was completely filled that Harry slowly started to pull out.
This seemed to spur Harry into action because he slipped an arm around Draco’s waist and held him in place.  “You’re such a fucking prat,” moaned Harry, his lips parting to finally seal around the tip.  Immediately, Draco wanted to press forward and he whined when Harry’s fingers dug into his waist and held him firmly in place.  He pulled off on a loud pop, the noise so obscene in the living room.  “I’ll let you fuck my face another time, but for now I’m setting the pace.  Buckle up, Malfoy, you’re at my mercy.”  He grinned slyly, licking along Draco’s entire length.  Draco had never seen anything so fucking hot in his whole life.
“Because you’re shagging Potter now?” she asked, hopeful.  He shook his head furiously, blushing.  She groaned, “Really?  After everything I said the other night?  Why won’t you tell him?”
He felt Potter’s hand grip his upper arm, pulling him around.  Draco’s breath left him in a whoosh as he stumbled into the other man’s chest.  Potter wrapped his arm firmly around Draco’s waist, keeping him there.  He had no intention of letting go.  “Malfoy,” he whispered, his breath ruffling Draco’s hair.  “I know you love running, but you don’t need to run from me.  I’m not going to hurt you...”
Kitten slides down from the ottoman like liquid and puts his head in Harry's lap, his teacup forgotten. Seems like he
Harry has to take a second to take all of that in. So Sirius knows Draco’s family… They’re in fact the same family.
Hogwarts elves were uncomfortably subservient, which already weirded him out back then. That’s why he rarely bothered them in the kitchens. But this is next level.
"You don't have to talk about it," Harry says in the reassuring tone he uses in play. "But if something went badly during the ceremony, it would be best that I know about it. So I can help you to the best of my ability."
Harry claps a hand on his mouth. Shit! He was so expecting Draco to force moans out of him he forgot talking also counts! He's so stupid! He walked right into Draco's trap. He wants to throw insults at him, but that would make sounds. He throws the finger at him instead, but Draco makes no indication he even saw it. Asshole.
"This was a wonderful evening as always, but if I don't feed the 'griffs soon Buckbeak might take a bite out of me in retaliation."
: I'm realizing now that it was a tautological question to ask, since you always leave your instant owl parchment at home. Please ignore these messages when you come around to seeing them.
"Tis a strange question, Lord Harry Potter sir. We house elves don't talk much with our masters. Tisn't proper. So they can't be or not be nice."
"Politics are dreadfully tiring. Be thankful you only have to deal with it for a short time," Draco says.
"I just want. One moment.” He lifts his pointer finger. “One peaceful moment with you, not spent arguing and worrying about the wards or Draco or any of that shite. If this is too much to ask, then I'd rather you go, so I can catch some sleep."
"Maybe I could have." He shrugs. "But magical animals tend to like me, and I like them better than most Quidditch players," he explains with a half-smile.
But now's not the time to get noisy about that. Rather, he has to get into Kitten's state of mind, know what he wants, what he needs tonight.
A few days later Harry finds another owl waiting for him, with a letter sporting the royal seal.  It's an audience again, with someone whose name doesn't ring any bell. Lady Zabini? This must be related to the ceremony one way or another. One of those priests Draco mentioned perhaps. Harry gives the owl a big treat to reward her speed. He’s covered in mud and scratches, as usual, but this time he has enough time to make himself presentable before apparating to the Palace.
He knows him very intimately, he doesn't add, because even hinting about your sex life in front of your almost-parents is weird. But the point is, he really, really knows Kitten. No, he knows
The word stirs something inside Harry, even if he's too spaced out to understand exactly what it means. Instead of explaining more, Draco elegantly sits on the armrest and whispers a spell.
The Prince does the final step and brings his lips against his. Finally, something familiar in this strange world he's suddenly thrown in.
Sirius grabs Remus's arm, interrupting him. They share a look, one of those looks between long-time lovers that holds an entire conversation. (Harry wishes he could do that with Draco.)
The only problem is that now is a terrible time to put a strain on their relationship. Draco needs to be able to put his utmost trust into Harry. He shouldn’t have to question his motivations or feelings. Not now.
: Honestly! He’s a public figure, and so are you now! If you don't protect your home, you'll have journalists knocking at your door at all hours of the day, along with nonprofits asking for endorsement or money, lobbyists wanting to swing your vote, and many more.
family, he changed the subject with the subtlety of a ten-foot bludger. And from Remus I got the same answer as you. If I wait for Sirius to talk about it, I'll wait forever."
Harry stays silent, thinking. Because the other thing is Sirius being so convinced that Draco is doing some sort of scheme to take advantage of him. And it's ridiculous, but... what if? Draco would never do that, not the Draco he knows.
Ultimately, there's little in the books regarding the proceedings of the ceremony itself. The Prince said they would come to that later. But they learn quite a few things about the history of the protections placed on Great Britain by Merlin and subsequently maintained and altered by the generations. They learn how the magic from the land itself, as well as its inhabitants, is harvested through the ancient rituals and directed to protect all against harm. In the end, Harry is left with the impression that he knows less than when they started.
Draco simply shook his head, standing up tall and stretching his arms over his head.  “No need, I’m about to leave.”  He finished the rest of his post run stretches then gestured to the whole room, “It’s all yours.”
But Draco laughed and indulged his friends during the party.  Now in the light of the next day, he realized just how stupid it all was.  Potter didn’t like spontaneous nudity.  He liked—well, Draco had no idea, but he was pretty sure it wasn’t that.
“Like a slob?” he asked sadly, his eyes looking down at his trainers.  At least he’d convinced Pansy to allow him to buy new shoes rather than using his running trainers.
Harry looked at him in shock, his whole body frozen in place.  Draco’s irritation started to rise and he was so close to just turning around and walking out of there.  But his need to know held him back.  He wanted Potter to say it.  Acknowledge that this thing between them wasn’t some made up fantasy.
“All right,” Harry grinned, clapping his hands.  “Let’s go downstairs.  I have the absolute best movie to show you.”
Before Draco could even open his mouth to argue, Dean grinned, “Do you like it?  We saw it the other day in Diagon.  Call it an early Christmas present if you want.”  Then they both continued to giggle.
When Draco comes back to his workstation, jars of ingredients in hand, he spares a brief look toward Harry.
Should he try to become the next King Consort? He has zero interest in politics. He loves his current job. He can't see himself smiling and waving in front of crowds who expect from him perfect propriety.
The next day, after feeding the animals in his charge and dodging Buckbeak's beak, Harry apparates to the Palace. He’s led by a servant through labyrinths of corridors until they end up in some sort of dungeon. He didn't even know there were dungeons below the Palace. When Harry is certain he is truly lost, the servant knocks politely on a metal door, bows, and leaves him alone.
Kitten makes a gesture and his wand slowly levitates out of his robe's pocket. He grabs it, then reverses the position of the wand in his hand and offers the handle to Harry. Harry's fingers close around the wand and he can feel the magic immediately responding to him with trust and familiarity. It's a powerful feeling, this wand who shouldn't be his own submitting to him easily, Kitten's magic responding to him as if it was his to hold. With this wand at his disposal he can feel Kitten's silvery magic much clearer.
Harry bites his lip, organising his thoughts. Draco seemed really insecure about this topic yesterday, so he needs to be careful choosing his words. Thankfully, Draco leaves him all the time he needs.
"... Is it really about Slytherin?" Harry asks, though he doubts that's the answer. He turns toward Remus. "What aren't you telling me?"
happening around all of that. I have several different sets of robes that you will need to put on and off me, blessed wine to drink, baths to take, priests to recite prayers to, and more. But that's details." Draco makes a dismissive gesture. "You'll have ample time to learn about those. Later. Because now..."
That’s surprising. The only people who regularly drop by without asking first are his dads, but they never knock. Who could it be?
“Apology accepted,” Draco says in an amused tone. Then he sighs again. "If it takes you this long to consider us together, this is probably too soon to ask about children."
"Please, take a seat. I've taken the liberty of ordering blackpowder tea. I hope it is to your liking."
Sirius falls down against the bookcase, hugging his knees. Remus sits down next to him and embraces him tightly.
Slowly, Harry's hand creeps from the belly to the hollow of a hip bone. Then to the seam of a thigh. Kitten hums encouragingly. Harry grips the skin with his hand and the magic with his mind.
: Sorry, I'm very busy getting everything set up here before I leave for the ceremony. I'm not really in the mood to play.
In response, Kitten rolls over on his back to strike a more appealing picture. His hair flows all over Harry's lap.
"So, what do you have in mind for today?" Harry asks when Kitten is sufficiently relaxed, not stopping his scratching and petting.
There is a beat of silence, when the Queen and the man—from their similar hair Harry realises it must be the Prince—study him. Harry shuffles in place, not knowing what to do. Thankfully, after a moment, the Queen puts down her teacup and speaks.
They spend the whole afternoon perusing the books and making notes of anything related to the wards renewal ceremony. When Harry's stomach reminds him loudly that he missed lunch, Ron uses the excuse of fixing them dinner to escape.
"Harry!" Draco raises his voice, visibly fed up. The thestrals prudently back away. "We've frequented each other for two years. I've introduced you to my mother. We've seen each other at work. I just walked through mud to stay with you! Mud!“ He points dramatically to his dirty shoes. “Tell me. In this bizarre universe residing in your head, what exactly is missing from our relationship to be a "real" relationship already?"
Immediate silence answers him. Perfect. He'll master the 'raise a hand and they all shut up' spell in no time.
"At the risk of being blunt, Lord Potter, I don't believe Draco is ready for this. Not yet. The last time he attempted to perform the ceremony, fourteen years ago, it was, frankly, a disaster."
Harry racks his brain. He has so many different creatures, it’s hard to find someone who knows how to care for all of them. Buckbeak vaguely tolerates Charlie, but then who will take care of Charlie's dragons? There's Hagrid, who's always happy to be bitten by angry creatures. But he has a job too, at Hogwarts. He can't think of anyone else who'd be able to cover for him on such short notice.
"I would have preferred you used that particular nickname earlier. Did you have to call me Kitten in front of my mother?" he laments, dramatically flopping over the couch and closing his eyes in a tired expression.
So Harry starts chatting about his day, all the while scratching and petting his partner's hair and neck. Kitten sighs and slowly relaxes.
“Goodie for you, Potter.” The blonde rolls his eyes, but there’s a smile strung through his sentence. Cushioning his hard consonants, lifting up on Harry’s name. Harry understands what a balloon feels like, suddenly: filled with nothing, yet drifting higher still.
he’s no longer pretending to dislike the Weasleys. A Malfoy who is hostile to the do-gooders that took him in makes sense. A Malfoy who is allied with said do-gooders … has a lot of questions to answer.
“I LOVE YOU!” Ron spares a sideways glance at her, lovesick even through puffy features. “I LOVE YOU IF WE DIE.”
Fred spirals out of the way of the spell and into another’s path. His Cleansweep bucks. Draco angles toward him, leans forward, but George gets there before he does. George says something — Draco’s too far away to hear what — and Fred slaps him on the head as he climbs onto his brother’s broom.
“It’s a matter of odds. Narcissa’s smart, but she doesn’t have the power Voldemort does. We’ve got better odds of taking her out then we do him. Why else would we have encouraged her coup? Next matter!”
Diagon Alley’s freshly opened farmer’s market is the next tour stop. Six or seven vendors lining the road between Ollivander’s and Madam Malkin’s selling vegetables, honey, bread, and several varieties of vibrant, weirdly round wizarding fruits. Harry spots a flash of blue curls beside a
As soon as Draco’s within reach, Harry grabs for him, pulling his body close and angling his face toward those pink lips. Draco pulls away. “Not yet. There's something you need to know. This lipstick is laced with polyjuice.”
Nobody says anything, then Luna: “I don’t think any of us really benefit from that information,” and they’re all laughing, even — especially — George. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco sees Harry talking to Molly and Ginny; Fred half-arguing, half-laughing with Hermione; Arthur crying and hugging Ron, who is somehow crying more than Arthur is. Everyone’s safe. Everyone’s happy. Everyone’s here.
Ron hands him a fistful of droopy pink tulips Draco’s pretty sure he saw in a vase at the entrance to the Portkey Office. “These are your favorite flowers, right? Pink tulips. Harry said they were your favorite flowers. Oh my god Malfoy, I know so much about you.”
Harry doesn’t think in words the way Draco does. He thinks in symbols and feelings, images and flashes of insight too large for language. More punctuation than vocabulary.
“I have no idea what you mean,” Draco says, even though he does. It’s not a coincidence that he fixed his cyberfloo problem on the day the twins were taken.
“Oh good, you’re all here,” Granger says. Thank god. Draco didn’t want to listen to Harry stumble to define their … whatever it is they’re doing. Calling each other by their first names.
Draco kisses him deeply, hungry, one last kiss to stave off the not-knowing. His hands wrap around Potter’s naked back. The muscles there relax at his touch. Potter moans again, this time straight into Draco’s mouth. He leans his neck to the left, a clear invitation. Draco kisses him there, and kisses him there, and kisses him there.
He’s told Pan and Ginny and Harry and Ron and Granger some version of the Greta Catchlove story before, but apparently it didn’t translate well. They still don't understand her power. They hadn’t seen how excited Greta looked when Narcissa asked her to ruin her own life. They’d never felt Narcissa’s tug or had the overwhelming desire to claw out their own eyes so she would spare them a second glance.
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Lupin says. He offers Draco an unwrapped chocolate bar. Draco’s sitting in a comfy red chair Lupin emptied of books when Draco first got to his office. Lupin’s leaning against his desk, one khaki leg crossed over the other. Draco’s starting to suspect the DADA teacher is incapable of standing up straight.
“You’re supposed to be on my side,” Draco says. “Did you forget they’re the reason Bill has scars on his face?”
“I, ah, think it’s in everyone’s best interest if we figure out how to coexist without punching each other.”
Draco reaches out, grabs Potter’s shirt and pulls him closer. Breathes in the scent of his own body wash and punches Potter in the face. Potter shoves back, but Draco doesn’t let go. Potter shoves harder, hits him again, eventually manages to untangle himself from Draco.
Harry opens his mouth — to say what, he’s honestly not sure — but Draco cuts him off, suddenly close enough that he doesn’t need to yell. “Of course it’s not.” He presses them shoulder to shoulder, the length of his arm against Harry’s thigh. “I don’t think you actually care,” Draco whispers and licks his earlobe. Harry swears he can feel the snake on Draco’s arm move, though actually it might just be his body’s reaction to the hand stroking his leg. Oh god.
. Let me just—” He points the key in the air the way they used to point wands, when they still used those.
Desire’s dangerous. Powerful, like Ollivander said. Wanting to be someone new, wanting the world to be new — sometimes that’s the only thing that gives you the courage to scorched-earth your past.
“Right. Yes. But.” Granger says into Ron’s chest. He releases her so that she can talk freely, but keeps ahold of her wrist, his thumb gently stroking her palm. Her free hand nervously tugs the draw string of her hoodie until the aglet catches the hole at the top and the cord stops being tug-able, hangs loose and lopsided around her neck. Then, with an intensity that matches her boyfriend’s, she looks straight at Ron. “I want to rescue Fred and George, but we still have to deal with the horcruxes. I don’t know what might happen if they’re in the same place for much longer.”
because I saved them. And now whenever anything happens, and I’m in the middle of it, I’m worried if I don’t save everyone that the whole society will kick me out, and I’ll have to go back and —
“I know you are.” Harry says and pulls Draco close to him. Draco rests his head against Harry’s chest. “It’s ok. We’ll be together.”
“I think we should plan to destroy the horcruxes as soon as possible then,” Hermione says. Draco nods. If he can somehow combine magical lust power — god, he hates thinking those words in that order — with electrical power, he should be able to generate enough power to cast Fiendfyre. He could probably create a feedback loop …
Dumbledore makes a speech about dark times and turning lights on and how there are going to be Dementors patrolling the castle, looking for Sirius Black. Draco’s positive the decision is meant to target him specifically. Dumbledore hates Draco. Sirius Black is Draco’s cousin — probably Sirius Black hates Draco too, for betraying the family and getting Narcissa arrested, or something.
on repeat in the Manor garden. Some June 5ths he shows up in the morning and spends the whole day with Draco; others he takes lunch with Luna and dinner with Hermione and doesn’t see Draco until 9 p.m. Draco’s always a knot of surprise and confusion when Harry arrives; now that Narcissa’s gone, Draco hadn’t expected anyone to remember his birthday. The slightest tug, and he unravels into a small, private smile.
“Everything’s fine,” Draco says. He’s different suddenly, straight-backed and eyes turned down, apparently cowed by an adult who used to let Harry color in his tattoos with muggle markers.
Molly wasn’t told about any of this. Arthur’s been giddy with their shared secret since Draco gave him his prototype. She definitely knows something is up, but it’s almost Christmas. Draco’s pretty sure she suspects Arthur has something planned for the holiday. What Arthur actually has planned is a bit of experimentation that verges on being both dangerous and illegal, but technically isn’t either.
“I — don’t want to,” Draco says, the words stilted and odd. Sirius studies him, then gives an understanding nod. “You can still keep the tips for tonight.
“So … Did you get the floo to work?” Granger says, and the rest of the people in the main atrium come suddenly into focus. Ron, he realizes, is sniffling.
Potter makes eye contact with Draco over the PDA, smirks. Draco rolls his eyes. Romantic nonsense, all of it.
Lightning again. This time, Draco catches a glimpse of his father, sitting shirtless on the edge of the bed, his long blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail.
His thought process moves laterally from there, settling finally on a horrible, awful, sacrosanct idea. A horrible, awful, sacrosanct idea that — if he can generate enough power — will probably work.
“Don’t look so surprised. This has only ever been a hobby for me. You’ve really taken it to the next level. Wow. Wow wow wow. I’m excited to see what I — and the rest of wizarding society — can learn from you.”
; the consciousness are the same and also distinct. Like an egg yolk and an egg; like how light is both a particle and a wave; like the trinity: father, son, holy ghost. You understand.”
Pan smiles. “When were you born? And where? The astro-orb can show the way the sky looked at the exact time of your birth. I could read it for you.”
Halfway through, Harry starts laughing. “I’m sorry. It’s just — ” He hands Draco a mirror and a reflection he doesn’t recognize: his hair shorn close to his head, a couple of blonde tuffs sticking out.
“If you would just stop and think for a moment, you would realize that Pan has more than made up for what they did to you. They saved your life, and the twins, and sixth year was a long fucking time ago.” Ginny says. She punctuates each word of
“Have you ever been homeless?” Harry says, suddenly sharp. Draco wants to turn over and look at him. He suspects he’ll see that spark he enjoys so much, the heartbeat of their antagonism. But moving feels a lot like showing Harry he cares, which feels a lot like losing this particular argument.
“What, Potter doesn’t have voyeuristic tendencies?” Pan says. Harry squawks. Draco opens his mouth to say something devastating and pointed, but Pan’s already turning around and heading back out of the kitchen door. “Save your breath, Draco. I’m going.”
spell, a happy moment when you cast a patronus. You’re asking me to join two things together. So. What’s the strongest type of joining? What’s a joining strong enough to create entire magical beings, new life?
The weather’s good, the waves are gentle, and they had a remarkably civil conversation with Narcissa before she let them take the sailboat out. It’s the perfect time for Harry to say all the right words, lean over and finally,
Potter blushes and mutters, “We’re not flirting,” as Granger flicks her wand at Draco and all the blood rushes to his face, the cartilage resetting itself.
Draco hadn’t meant to ask for reciprocity, but it’s not as though he’s about to turn it down. His pants are … extremely tight right now.
All of the years come at once. 29; 39; 49. His back hurts; his legs ache; he feels comfortable in his body in a way his youth never allowed. 59; 69; 79, on. Two old men, falling into inevitability. Reaching together for what’s next.
“Hang on—” Draco turns around to open the driver side door, but the position is weird and he ends up half-falling out of the car in the process. He steps out completely in order to right himself. His back hurts; he reaches all the way up to stretch it. The bottom of his t-shirt rides up along his stomach, and then there are hands there, exploring the exposed skin.
Fred’s been meaning to fix the shop wards since they opened. Not that the ward quality made a difference in their apartment.
“Just accio the bag!” Draco pushes the sleeve of Potter’s shirt up and brings the knife down on his dark mark. “ACCIO THE FUCKING BAG!”Potter waves his wand and the noise stops. The screaming, silenced; the sack, pulled from his hand. Draco collapses in a chair, throws the knife on the floor.
Draco steps closer and takes his hand. Studies it. Turns it over in his own hand, gentle, focused. Harry swallows.
Draco twists around to catch Potter’s lip with his own. He pushes Potter back against the Ford, which
Look, he already had the dynamite, a leftover part of a Valentine’s Day surprise he had planned for Blaise back when they were dating.
“Your …” He pointedly looks down and then back up into Potter’s eyes. Potter swallows and continues on with the game.
Draco’s eyes keep finding Harry’s. Sometimes he’s close by, sometimes he’s at the other end of the party, but every time Draco looks for Harry, Harry’s there, looking back.
“Who was that?” Harry asks as he walks over and starts looking at the 11 varieties of apples on display. “Also which of these is best for pie?”
“Of course you don’t. The class is at Midnight. No one pays attention. We have so many spells that mimic the night sky! There’s no reason not to teach it during the day! I hate Hogwarts.” Pan crosses their arms and settles against the seat’s red cushioning. “It’s like this. Magic is affected by all sorts of factors, right? I can’t cast a
He shrugs. Arthur claps him on the back. “You should be dancing up and down The Burrow. I’m so, so proud of you. You’ve outmatched me in this department, I think.”
Isn’t that interesting. A new layer of Harry for Draco to unwrap, more surface area for him to touch.
Which is true — Narcissa is almost as paranoid as she is smart — but also he doesn’t care. “You’ve been spying for her this entire time. Feeding her information on Voldemort
When he opens them again, Granger’s hand is around Ron’s waist, apparating them to a destination Draco doesn’t quite hear the name of.
“FLY FORWARD. JUST FLY FORWARD.” Potter brackets Draco with strong arms and pushes ahead. Fire falls from Draco’s wand in thick ropes. His childhood home burns.
Harry wants to kiss the blonde bastard, who one time told him he didn’t much care for romance, except — “Draco, I never wrote you a letter.”
“We can’t waste time waiting for the Order. Voldemort’ll kill the twins if we don’t get them out soon.” Ron says. Draco’s almost impressed by his ability to confidently communicate the bleak reality of the situation. Draco definitely couldn’t. He’s to sullen to do anything other than sink further and further into the massive maroon chair he’s sitting in.
“The Death Eaters think they know how to make magic bombs … yeah. They’re definitely, errr, taken and it’s definitely not a joke.”
“No, you don’t understand. Attaching a wand core and a wand body … it’s not something one person can do alone.”
destroy the horcruxes. Do you really think the Death Eaters would keep following someone who took a leave of absence every few months? Merlin, you’re supposed to be the savior of the wizarding world and you can’t even strategize your way out of a hole.”
Harry’s yelling by the end. Draco turns over, remembering a similar wild fury proceeding angry red marks, and tugs on the back of Harry’s plaid shirt.
“This isn’t any of your business!” He says and exits into the living room, the porch, the garden. A path to the barn he’s walked a million times before. Better to think about the Ford’s engine trouble than Pan, or the war, or anything at all.
The shock that Draco Malfoy’s a vet does a lot to mitigate the shock of Luna’s kitten suddenly growing a second head. At least Draco’s surprised too; Harry feels a little comforted by the naked confusion on the blonde’s face when he tumbles through the fireplace at Grimmauld Place and sees exactly
There’s a long pause. “Fred and George were pretty low on my list of people to be concerned about,” she says finally.
“I’ve been talking to Dumbledore,” Snape breaks in. “About other options. I want you to come with me. I—” Snape averts his eyes and stares at the corner of the wall. “Feel strongly for you.”
The dark mark looms large over the last time Draco was here, too. Only then, it had been abstract and far-off; an attack on people he didn’t know. Something he cared about intellectually because
“You and your friends have worn through my patience, Draco,” Narcissa says, her voice magicked louder with a
“No. Flowers are for the alcohol cravings. Stars are for —” Harry lets out a deep breath. “Bloody bond is impossible. Stars are for whenever I felt the tug toward you.”
“Look who it is, my favorite little nephew!” Bellatrix sing songs, fire spurting from the end of her wand as she waves it around her head. There’s no sign of the twins.
“Seems we need to renew the registration on the Ford,” Arthur reads off a yellow sheet of paper. “I’ll clear my schedule and go tomorrow afternoon.”
“I certainly want to know more about this. It’s the first I’m hearing on such matters,” Lupin says. He leans on one hand and drums an anxious pattern on the table with the other.
“I would never do what you did,” Draco says. “I would have thought of something else. I would have used my brain. What you did was stupid, and wrong, and you’re never going to make up for it.”
“Sorry, I know you asked me to warn you, but I’m drunk, and it’s my mother’s funeral. I’m allowed to forget things.” Draco sighs. “I like that you come back. That we come back. Because if you can come back, then that means that she can come back, wherever she is. It means the matter preserves itself. It means —”
“Ditto what Potter said.” Draco barely even stops at the microphone, essentially circling from his seat to the stage back to his seat again. Pansy glares at him, and Potter blushes, and his best friend’s wedding isn’t a game, but Draco has won.
He goes for the throat. “No one wants your apologies, Potter. We’d rather you get your shit together and stop this fucking war.”
“Oh my god, when did this happen?” Ginny asks. “Was it just now? Was it last night? I thought you two were being all weird last night. Oh my god this is great. I’ve wanted this for so long. I’m so happy for you.
Everything about Order Headquarters screams Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, including the portrait of Walburga Black that screams
“I don’t know where he is.” The first true thing he’s said to Ron all evening. He remembers Draco’s crooked mouth saying,
“Granger, he didn’t know.” Draco says. “Ron almost had an aneurism when I asked him to help me because it meant he would have to go behind your back. Did you get that? He didn’t jump at the opportunity to help rescue his brothers because he
“Don’t look so —” He gestures to Potter. “I want you. You didn’t misunderstand things so don’t lose your head over it. It’s just— it’s just— it’s just—”
“Oh my god, Draco, be reasonable,” Ginny says. She tries to block his path out of the kitchen, but he pushes past her.
“I saved your life, and I’ve been spying for the Order for almost an entire calendar year. I’ve more than earned your forgiveness.
Long dissonant tones worm their way through Draco’s thoughts, talking. The screech of a griffin diving after its pray in conversation with a tritone chord played on a piano meant for funeral marches. He needs to close the pouch, but his fingers won’t cooperate and his left arm burns.
Molly’s kitchen is full of things. Overstuffed with antique china dishes; handmade potholders; three rows of copper pots suspended from the ceiling; a coffee maker charmed to always smell like freshly ground coffee beans; a microwave Arthur had gotten her she reluctantly admits is more effective than a reheating charm.
"Quite convinced. Believe me, if this potion wasn't so time sensitive I would be ripping off your clothes right now."
Harry feels like scratching his head. Mendy seems okay. But she also spontaneously harmed herself because of a turn of phrase.
"It would be amiss of me to not have at least greeted each of the current Lords, wouldn't it? The Wizengamot has missed you, Lord Potter." Her face and tone are so amiable Harry wonders if he imagined the pause before that.
The whole ordeal leaves Harry tired and cranky, and all of his creatures even more so. Through all of this, he still has to study and train for the ceremony, and do all the usual work for his creatures, leaving him with barely enough time to sleep.
"But it has, already," Sirius says in a somber tone. "They've made us fight. They forced me to drag the past into the open."
"Send me an instant owl if you want to hang out later," Draco says with a small smile, and disapparates.
: If it makes you feel any better, I'm comparatively busy and stressed. At least it's only for a short time. After the ceremony, things should be much more relaxed.
The yells get distorted as Sirius pours the memory into the pensieve, rendering them impossible to understand. But the intent is clear. Remus's hand clamps on Harry's arm, no longer a gentle reassuring touch, but a cling for dear life.
Harry groans and looks toward Remus to share in the embarrassment. But instead of an amusingly mortified Remus digging his elbow in Sirius's ribs, Harry finds Remus with his mouth slightly hanging, like he's seen a ghost. Confused, Harry looks back toward Draco. The awkwardness seems to have spread to him, and he looks at his toes while tapping his fingers against his arm.
Should he stay a side-lover, in the shadows, making compromises with whoever will be Draco's spouse? Open relationships are one thing, but he can't see himself being the secret second man for life.
Because they were not boyfriends yet, right? Harry doesn't see himself explaining to his dads how this relationship started out as just sex and blurrily progressed to today's point. From this perspective, it's not so strange that they didn't meet that often. They were just friends having sex.
"Sadly, yes. And if there is no way to convince her to take on the wards one more cycle, then my duty to this country is to mitigate the deleterious effects of this mistake. Hence your presence here."
Kitten understands the keyword and moans in anticipation. They didn’t discuss doing this particular activity tonight, but it’s something they’ve done a lot and Kitten always likes it, so it shouldn’t be a problem.
They're still in a palace, and it shows in the high ceilings and polished hardwood floor. But there's no golden frames nor tapestries hanging on the walls. The furniture is modern and sleek, and the decoration sparse. Everything is neat and tidy, to the point that it looks like no one actually lives here; that it's just a photoshoot set for a furniture magazine. It may be the house elves being over-zealous, Harry reasons. He spots framed photographs on the bookshelves showing Draco's family, just about the only thing that makes the place lived-in.
"But it is a strong possibility nevertheless. As long as you don't trust him blindly... Well, I'll trust that you know him as well as you do."
: You're welcome to come over. I'm working right now but if you don't mind me not paying much attention to you, you can just hang around I suppose.
"Just because she's particularly unpleasant doesn't make her a villain, Mister Gryffindor brain.” Draco looks slightly annoyed… by Harry’s comment, or Lady Zabini’s behaviour?  “Be reassured, she's very loyal to the crown. She wouldn't sabotage the wards. But I will take a look, if that reassures you."
Harry hums happily as he gets ready for the day. Today he has all day for himself and his creatures. It's good to be home in peace, but he sort of misses Draco already. They’ve seen each other a lot this whole week, with all the work they have to do together for the ceremony. Studying Draco’s clothes, then the spells, and after that Harry got introduced to the priests, then Lady Zabini wasted almost one whole day criticizing Draco’s way of pronouncing the spells… They’ve been busy. Even if it was mostly work, he had a lot of fun just spending time with Draco.
"No, we're finishing," she says, gently petting the hair of her partner. Said partner turns glassy eyes toward them and gives a little wave, but she seems still pretty under it.
"Journalists, I guess. They go away when the wards warn them they've been detected and will get a fine."
Harry is left scratching his head. He didn't learn much from the encounter. Know people by how they treat their inferiors... Ignoring them doesn't seem like the best treatment. And the spontaneous self-harm is quite alarming. But he doesn't have any frame of reference here. He has never had a servant. None of his friends have any as far as he knows. He didn't interact much with the Hogwarts elves... which is exactly the situation Mendy described, now that he thinks about it. No interaction.
Harry hears the flap of their wings, first. He ignores them. They're shy. They're always more comfortable if he's not looking their way.
Harry closes his eyes to try to ignore their audience. It was hot just a second ago, to be watched by all of these eyes. But now he feels like he's making them lose their time. No, this is not a productive line of thinking. He just needs to breathe for a minute, until he's 100% present for his partner.
Our two boys are so happy right now... It would be a shame if something happened in the next chapter...
He gets a few more pinches. He can't even see Draco's hands move to cast the spell, so he has no way of seeing it coming. The plug's vibrations also increase slowly, no surprise here.
"It's strange. Not off-putting," Harry corrects as his hand goes from the Prince's shoulder to his throat to his chin, caressing the pale skin. "It's a change, of course. Your face, now this. But, if anything, it makes you even more beautiful."
“It’s not gloating if it’s true,” Draco says very seriously. ”And I’m quite good at Quidditch. We really should have a Seeker duel some time."
"Make sure I'm okay. The ceremony is very... heavy, magic-wise. You're here to monitor my magic, make sure that I'm not overwhelmed by the spells... that sort of thing,” Draco concludes with a shrug.
"I'm convinced, no problem on that front," Harry agrees, his gaze wandering on the elaborate mouldings of the ceiling. No doubt about that. Kitten
The whole thing costs a fortune, most of it for nothing, all paid by the Crown, which incurs an article in the
"Okay, I got it!" Past-Sirius whispers, a small potion bottle in his victorious hand. "Let's get out of here."
Not a half second later an elf apparates right in front of him, bowing so low her nose is pressed flat against the carpet.
With a sharp twist of the wrist, he makes Kitten's clothes disappear. His pale skin glows like a halo against the shiny black vinyl, the contrast mesmerising. Harry's eyes follow the long lines of his legs, the pale shadow cast by a hipbone, the little patch of pearly hair between his legs.
: I’ll give you the contact of a good ward mistress. But don’t get your hopes up, it’s never perfect. There's no escaping the media.
Does he want children? Maybe. He sees that as something somewhat distant, something to daydream about. Not something to decide right now. Does he want children now? Isn't twenty a bit young to have children? He still wants a few more years of childless freedom. What if he continues to want a few more years forever, and never ends up wanting the kids?
"Harry, I agree with you that it's very much relevant now," Remus says in a soothing voice, like he's afraid to startle anyone. "But don't be too hard on us for not sharing this part of our past with you before. Those are not memories we are happy to be reminded of."
The mustached man however seems very offended by his answer, and his dictaquill scribbles furiously.
"I'm talking about the ceremonial bath, naturally," she adds, though Harry has no doubt the double-entendre was entirely intentional.
The palace guard who is guiding him through the corridors is probably judging him too. When Harry presented himself at the entrance with the royal letter in hand, the guard seemed very sceptical. Well, Harry is sceptical too. He's so out of place on velvet carpet and between marble walls. Why him?
After having seen Sirius's mother shooting two AKs at Remus, Harry understands better their anxiety.
Out of small talk, Harry falls silent, his hands around the warm mug. He doesn't know what to say. He doesn't want to disturb this peace. This normality. If he asks about the Blacks, there's no going back. He can't, or rather he doesn't want to pretend Sirius has no past that he knows of.
Harry stops walking at that moment, and closes his arm around Draco. Draco stumbles, surprised by the sudden gesture.
With his activities for the day decided, he scourgifies his coffee cup and starts to prepare sandwiches, when a knock echoes on his door.
"Harry," Remus starts in a gentle voice, "I'm trying to understand your situation. To summarise: The Prince approached you, flirted with you, while he was hiding his identity. He knew who you were from the start, while you didn't, which is a very unbalanced situation. You spent two years in a relationship with somebody who hid his identity to you, who let you become attached to him while hiding very important facts about himself. And now, he needs you, you specifically, to complete a ritual that we know nothing about. Do you understand why we are worried?"
"Yes. For the very last time," Present-Sirius says, a trembling hand on Harry's shoulder searching for Remus's fingers.
Harry gently parts Kitten's hair, uncovering the elegant column of his throat. He caresses the skin, then brings the heavy leather collar around it. He clasps it shut and feels his partner's skin shivering under his fingers.
"I know you will," Draco answers in an almost bored tone. "I wouldn't have revealed my identity to you otherwise."
"I'm helping! I'm figuring out what I'm going to do to these clowns to convince them to leave Harry alone!"
Harry nods frenetically. Ten minutes. He can do ten minutes. He doesn't know what Draco will throw at him to make it difficult, but he's certain he can make it!
It’s the end of their evening. Harry summons the clothes he disapparated off Kitten’s back earlier. Kitten gets dressed, then takes off his collar and puts it in Harry’s hands. Harry accepts the gift, and gives the cat ear a last scritch.
"And she didn't manage to scare you off?" Draco examines his fingernails, his tone falsely nonchalant.
"It should be alright," Draco answers, though Harry can feel uncertainty in his voice. "Muggles manage to survive quite a while without magic, do they not? Unless a herd of Dark Lords attack the chamber at this precise moment and somehow overpower every single guard and Auror on site... I should be fine."
Seeing Neville like this, all fidgety and ashamed, Harry can't hold it against him. He was so shy and awkward for most of their school years. Harry can definitely imagine him laying awake at night, trying to decide if he should breach the subject or not, and trying to gather the courage to talk.
The very first thing Harry hears is the loud crack of an apparition. Then, the scene materialises around him.
"This is a very good house, Lord Potter Sir, a very good house indeed. Very noble. A lot of good work. Mendy is very proud to be part of the estate, Sir."
"Yes, well, you have the whole backstory. Last cycle, seven years ago, I didn't complain when Mother suggested I let her take care of it. But this year, I want to try again."
Harry blinks tears out of his eyes. The words take a second to make their way to his buzzed brain. Is the torture done, really? Or is it a trap?
Draco plops down on the couch the Queen just left, visibly more relaxed as well, and drops a biscuit into his mouth.
Monitor his magic...? Harry's eyes widen in understanding. This sounds a bit like what they do in bed, right? Magic play. Is this why the Prince thought of him for this job?
"Yeah well now that I'm hanging out with Draco, the Queen and all that, it's not so much in the past, is it?"
, even though you already accepted to do it. Some dumb regulation on Ministry jobs. I received a dozen applications or so. So if I just needed a body to sacrifice to the Dark Gods I wouldn't need to spend two years roping someone into it. I just need to offer a little bit of money," Draco completes with an eyeroll.
Remus, at least, seems to sense that they are going nowhere. He shares one of those looks again with Sirius.
"It's... it's weird," Harry tries to explain after a moment of silence. "I know your magic so well... or at least, I thought I did. I may not have known your name or even your face, but knowing someone's magic, it's more than that. And now that the runes aren't concealed, your magic is so different. And I'm still trying to get used to your real face. Everything feels so... different."
She twirls her wand toward the destroyed furniture. It disappears, piece by piece, leaving only empty, clean space behind.
"I would be happier if we could never talk about this again," Sirius grumbles. "But since your prince babbled already, I'd rather you heard our version."
"Okay, fine!" Harry lets himself fall flat on his back. "I know I should talk to him but I'm avoiding him because I'm scared of the confrontation. Or worse, that he'll pretend to suddenly be deaf if I bring it up. Or worse, that he'll continue ranting about... urg..."
"Child raising books..." Remus continues, lost in memories. "I was so terrified of hurting you." He strokes Harry's back abstently. "The books warned about reproducing your parent's harmful behaviour on your children, even if you want nothing less."
"Wonderful!" The moustached wizard exclaims. "Are the wards in such bad shape that it is necessary to renew them so often?"
If it turns out they can't be together not even 24 hours after they started being together, Harry is going to be pissed.
Since he knows Draco used to play Quidditch, Harry isn't afraid to kick the ground and fly high. Besides, he must prove that his Firebolt is the superior broom. The loch zooms out, a splatter of grey in the middle of the dark green forest, surrounded by brown mountains.
He thought they were at the strange in-between stage where they're becoming a bit more than sex partners but don't quite know what they want to become. And Draco is at the children stage already?
And he feels it, Kitten's pleasure pumping through his nerves. The endorphins and dopamine that shoot through his veins at his command. The particular taste of his pleased magic. He can feel it shake, trying to escape his ministrations, but Harry grabs it and keeps it
Harry drowns his thoughts in coffee. At least he has plenty of work today: He should make a complete tour of his animals and the grounds before going into the ceremony, to be sure no potential emergency is hiding from him. He should at least check if Annabelle is recovering well from giving birth, and if her foal is healthy. With how shy that unicorn is, finding her should take the better part of the day. That should keep him busy enough to stop worrying about everything.
Draco laughs at Harry’s confused look. He gets close against Harry’s back, softly takes his fingers out of the delicate silk cloth and smooths out the wrinkles.
She approaches, her heels clacking loudly against the floor, and present-Sirius reflexively takes a step back next to Harry.
That doesn't seem to be quite the correct thing to say, since the Prince still looks away at nothing, his stance closed and guarded.
Once they see the food, It doesn’t take long for the thestrals to gather around Harry and completely ignore Draco. Harry laughs at the goofers who try to put their heads in the bag; growls at the rude ones who try to steal from their friend’s mouth; whispers at the shy ones who wait for everyone else to have eaten before approaching.
"I'll never say no to that. Maybe we should free the bed though." He nods his head toward the couple making out nearby. "Since you're dressed we could go cuddle on a couch in the teashop?"
The Prince turns around, revealing his back. It’s the first time Harry can truly see it, free from the usual concealment charm. It's covered in red scars. A blade has traced runes of blood arranged in two rows on each side of his spine, circled by the outline of a shield.
Harry gives him a pointed look, but Draco volunteers nothing more. Harry turns back toward the foal, mulling over the strange words.
The Prince's magic is touching his. Harry recoils in reflex, but the magic follows him, and... he knows this magic. He knows this magic
Draco finishes his thirty-eight stirs in silence, then turns over his cauldron so that the rose engraved on its side faces the point where the moon rises over the horizon.
They walk through the decorated halls of the Palace, politely greeting the occasional passerby. Harry earns some curious looks, which he ignores completely, his mind elsewhere.
It's probably a clerical error or something, Harry muses as his coffee finally arrives in his hand. He takes a sip and pursues his reading.
He wonders what's being so stressful at work. Kitten never told him exactly what his job is. Only that he can't talk about it and that there's a lot of pressure on him. Harry is pretty sure he's an Unspeakable, which would explain all the secrecy. Kitten never revealed his name either, hence the nickname. And Harry knows he's hiding his face under a glamour.
"You don't need to understand everything," the Prince says as he drops book after book in a holding bag. "Like I said, I'm in charge of completing the ritual. But it's best if you know the general outline of the process."
"It's. It's a lot," Harry says with a tremor in his voice. His hand is grasping the Prince's shoulder, though he doesn't remember putting it here.
"Can you guys actually explain what's going on?" Ron asks. "I have no idea what you're fighting about. Neville knows some sort of secret about Sirius?"
Kitten has always been beautiful. But here, in the low light of the laboratory, with his long hair braided back and this new, pointed face, he's even more breathtakingly beautiful than usual.
Naturally, a money scandal involving the Crown is vastly more interesting than the routine renewal of the country's wards, and it seems everyone and their neighbours has read the article. Suddenly, people Harry has not talked to since Hogwarts owl him to ask for details, phrasing it as generously providing him with a chance to tell his side of the story before judging him.
"The actual crazy thing is how well she managed to cover the story!" Hermione points out. "All the history books affirm that Walburga had only one child, Regulus. I have trouble believing they were all manipulated. Unless... Unless there's a spell."
Harry takes a moment to take in her appearance. He doesn't have a lot to compare to, besides Hogwarts elves. And he has rarely interacted with them at Hogwarts. The elf in front of him is not dissimilar. Like Hogwarts’ elves, she's wearing what looks like a napkin draped around her, and nothing else. Can't the Crown afford to clothe their staff?
Draco leads him to his bedroom, and the atmosphere feels less asepticised than the main room, though it still looks unnaturally clean. The bedroom contains one large bed covered with a white comforter, an opened wardrobe filled with neatly folded clothes, a full-length mirror covering the better part of one wall, and two mannequins displaying Draco's ceremonial robes.
Sirius's spell flies right toward the Queen, but she flicks it away with a move of her wrist. A wardrobe catches the spell and explodes in splinters.
"Okay... but what you're saying is that some people from Draco's family are douchebags. But you don't actually know him."
Before he can ask ‘Excuse-me, what the fuck?’, the dozen or so journalists start asking questions all at the same time.
"You've never mentioned him to us," Remus remarks with polite curiosity. Then his eyes light up with understanding. "Oh, the one you don't know if you are dating or not?"
They fall into a companionable silence after that, drinking tea and lacing fingers. Then they chat quietly. Harry vents about his latest trouble with his hippogriffs. Kitten complains about a particularly inept coworker he had to suffer. They feed each other scones and all is well in the world.
Just as Harry settles down on the couch, grumpy to have been had like a child, something suddenly pinches his nipple. He gasps, not expecting it at all.
“Hello, pretty. You’re in luck. Look what I have here…” Harry plunges his hand in the bag and presents a whole bloody goat heart. “Your favourite!” Nyx whickers excitedly. Draco gags.
"Harry, did we tell you that Mrs Finnigan across the street just had a surprise litter of kneazles? She's not sure what she's going to do with them."
The thought gives him an idea. Someone has to do the Reparos and the sweeping. You know people by how they treat their inferiors, right? That's the saying? So maybe what he should do is interrogate the house elves. That could give him a better idea of who Draco and his family really are.
Harry turns his attention back to Kitten, who's still breathing heavily, gently coming down from his high. Harry vanishes his cum and spoons him. They rest on the bed for a little while longer, Kitten's breath slowly going back to a normal rhythm. Harry never ceases to caress his hair, his back, his ears.
I know the ruling family, Harry," Sirius says, sombre. "They're rotten, the whole lot of them. The only thing they care about is power, money and their reputation in court. Anyone who comes across them gets used, then crushed and thrown away. I've escaped that shite a fuck-long time ago and I've ever been happier since." Remus gently squeezes his shoulder at that, and Sirius laces their fingers together. "You don't want to get involved with this trash, pup."
They talk about the minutiae of the ceremony for hours. Lady Zabini seems pleasantly surprised when Harry displays his knowledge about how to handle someone else's magic. She probes him for how he learned with such intensity that Harry almost blurts out the whole truth. He ends up vaguely saying that it has something to do with "personal activities". Something in her eyes makes him think that she knows
"My parents. Overheard. Made me swear to never tell. I thought it would be rude and insensitive to remind you..."
During her litany Sirius grabs Remus and there's a crack of apparition, but their silhouette only wobbles, without disappearing.
How is it not like that? Harry doesn't really have the words for it. But thankfully he doesn't have to elaborate because Remus starts talking.
"Nothing catastrophic happened,” Draco finally opens with. "It was my first time handling the wards, my first ceremony of the sort. They stripped me of my magic, then carved the runes on my back and proceeded to the rest of the ceremony as you know it."
Sirius and Remus are on the doorstep, exchanging awkward stares with Draco who's still sprawled on the couch, his hand closing off his bathrobe. The next instant Draco's wand jumps to his hand and his bathrobe transfigures into proper robes. Before Harry even has the time to think of how to introduce him —his (gasp!) boyfriend? the Prince of Great Britain?— Draco rises elegantly to his feet.
"Yeah, they do. Except for me. They’re sweet, but it’s an issue when fire crabs try to give me a hug."
Kitten blinks, disoriented for a second. His hands search purchase into the air before he gets the presence of mind to turn over. He gets on all fours, his cat ears standing at attention.
The room is shrouded in darkness. It's night, and the only light comes from the moon, pouring from the open window and revealing the two figures who just apparated. Harry is forced to take a step forward to be able to clearly look at them.
"I stand my ground: Draco is really a wuss!" Sirius is still growling when Harry bothers paying attention again. "He should be able to protect Harry. What kind of boyfriend is he if he can't do that?"
"I... don't remember us saying anything about us being together," Harry points out. He half expects Draco to answer ‘What do you mean, we had this conversation two weeks ago’ which would confirm the parallel universe theory.
Harry scratches the white belly offered to him. Harry's seen this body many, many times, but it's still as breathtaking as the first time. The pearly white skin, the lithe, svelte silhouette. It's a wet dream come true. One would think that a little glamour or two are at play here but Harry knows it's not the case. Not on anywhere but his face. Kitten is beautiful and pliant under his fingers, ready to be turned into a whimpering mess.
Harry gets up from the couch. He moulds himself against Draco's back, puts a gentle hand through his hair and kisses his temple.
"It will not be." The Prince makes a final stir. Then he turns toward Harry. "Not if you're with me."
Draco sighs. He shakes his head and Harry can see the tension seeping out of eyes, replaced by a sort of exasperated fondness.
Sirius slams the cork back into place and grabs another one. The yell of a child is the only thing that has the time to escape before Sirius forcefully closes it and pushes it to the back of the shelves.
The room is on the smaller side, compared to the grandiose of the royal palace. In its center stands a glass coffee table where tea and scones are served. Seated in an upholstered chair, a teacup delicately held in her long fingers, her long white hair braided in complicated patterns, is her Royal Majesty the Queen of Great Britain: Narcissa Malfoy.
"You could say this is my way of testing the waters," Draco answers, an unsure smile half forming on his lips.
"One of those days you'll come in and I'll be naked," Harry comments as he lowers the heat of the stove before turning around.
"Yes, Sir. We're eleven elves all working together, tis very fun. Tis more lively than managing an estate all on your own."
This is supposed to be about love, not politics! Harry wants to shout. But how can he say that while looking at Remus in the eyes? You can’t say politics don’t matter when they affect the lives of your loved-ones. You can’t ignore that.
"Don't you see? Your parents, and all the magical parents of our peers know, obviously!" Hermione says. "They were alive when this happened. Unless memory spells were involved, they have to know."
"If you want to play, you'll have to prepare yourself. I'm too busy to deal with you right now." he says in a bored tone.
"Would you have believed me? If during cuddles after sex I suddenly dropped 'Hey, by the way, I'm the Crown Prince of Great Britain'? Bet you wouldn't have recognised my real face, you hermit."
"You've worked hard since yesterday, didn't you? You think you've earned a reward?" Draco whispers into the hollow of Harry's throat.
: FINALLY. I've been telling you for YEARS that it's a basic security feature that every magical home should have!
"Precisely. It was my first time feeling such magic in me and... It was overwhelming." Draco's voice goes very small. "I panicked, which made the magic of the wards even more unstable, creating a negative feedback loop. It took a while for me to calm down."
She waited till he flew even more away from the snitch and made her move. She shot towards the snitch, Gryffindors screamed at their seeker. He took after her, still quite a distance from her. She followed the snitch sharply and always kept her eye on the snitch.
"You're welcome Harriet, it was no problem. I've known all of that since I was like 4 years old," Draco shrugged but smiled regardless.
"But seriously if you feel like you are going to have a panic attack or get sick, tell me okay. I have an excuse already planned so we won't have to fly today," Merry whispered to her.
"We aren't scared of the name," Harriet looked up at Merry to make eye-contact, "We are scared of what he did and what he did to many that we loved. He basically transformed most of the Purebloods into his killing slaves because he fed off of their fear for their families. Now the thoughts and actions he did, transferred onto the older generation of Purebloods which causes our generation to be seriously harmed. He tore apart the Wizarding world and created a large divide between wizards. That's why we are scared, Harriet," Merry's eyes were wet again. Harriet hated to see her cry, she didn't know how to fix her worries, maybe time will heal them and create new strengths.
"Mr. Feose said he could come and spend Christmas with us," She fixed her skirt that was riding up. Harriet never realized but Mr. Feose has never talked about his own family before, he may not have any. Maybe that's why he always treated her like his child. She wants to ask him about it, but that seems rude. Maybe one day it will come up.
"Harriet, have you seen any good looking guys?" Pansy turned to her. Harriet looked around, not knowing what to say.
She sneered at her shaking niece, "Freak." She slammed the door of the cupboard in her face, that day she was the first day she didn't eat at all. All she could do was cry softly in her shirt and play with the little spiders who seemed confused by her presence. She still would squeal when one brushed up against her leg. The dark scared her so much, but after a while, she got used to it. She found it comforting, she found the unknown exciting, thrilling. The dark hid her, protected her from harm while the light only
"Would you like to get her supplies?" The sales woman laughed. The three of them walked to the back to get a bed, food, and toys.
"Harriet! Stop," Merry raised her voice a bit, Harriet dug her nails into her arms in fear of the loud voice yelling at her. Draco touched her shoulder when he saw her flinch at Merry. Harriet looked down, she messed up, she is going to lose her friends and be a terrible witch. She should just leave Hogwarts, she has no courage nor bravery in her. That can start to mess up her ambitions, making her a terrible Slytherin. "Harriet, I didn't mean to scare you." Merry walked over to her, kneeling in front of her. "I'm sorry sweetie, it's just that we grew up never mentioning Who-Shall-Be-Not-Named so we get scared when we hear the name. I'm sorry."
"May I take some coins?" The goblin frowned in confusion but nodded anyway. He twirled his hand around and a small coin pouch appeared in his hand. After he asked for 2 galleons, he handed her the pouch. He quickly explained how Wizarding Currency worked but Harry already knew all about it because she read a few books about it. She grabbed a like 9 small stacks of galleons and 12 small stacks of knuts. She would have to get a whole new wardrobe plus all of the school supplies.
Once everyone left and Draco was taking forever in the bathroom, Harriet asked Merry, "Who was that?"
"Really?" Harriet was surprised, she knew some places in the Muggle world were having trouble accepting the idea.
"Oh yeah?" She held up the spoon again, preparing to fling it. The other first year Slytherins watched with amusement.
"I promise," Harriet rubbed Merry's hands comfortingly. They both started to giggle, "Should we go now?"
"Especially Malfoy," Merry snickered. Harriet doesn't really understand what is exactly happening, the girls mention Malfoy and her in one sentence then giggle. Is it some kind of inside joke? Her stomach fell, were they making fun of her behind her back?
"Good morning Freak," Her Uncle replied grumbling. Dudley came down a few minutes later, grumbling about how little sleep he got because he stayed up late playing video games. This week was the last week of school and Dudley was turning 11 in a few days. Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon have been showering him with praise and gifts non-stop. She always was never given any gifts or allowed to be out when the holidays were around. After awhile she stopped caring and realized that they will never like her. Both Uncle Vernon and Dudley were done with breakfast so she finished cleaning and got ready for school. Everyone hated her, they bullied her and teased her about everything she did. It was all because of Dudley and his group. Piers always teases her about her wearing bras and frilly panties even though she doesn't. She didn't wear bras because she had a very flat chest and she wore boxers too big for her. Her Aunt would only buy them when she went shopping for Dudley. Harriet put on a baggy, light blue sweatshirt and gray, baggy jeans and ratty, old tennis shoes. She never even tried with her hair but she covered up her scar with makeup. She grabbed her school bag filled with books. She always completed all of her homework months ahead and had perfect grades. Harriet loved to learn because it was something she could do by herself and for herself. She quickly jogged to school, avoiding Dudley and his gang. When she got to school, she went immediately to the library to return books.
"No, thank you, Mistress Harriet," He squeaked out. She pouted a bit, she wanted to tell him that he didn't have to call her Mistress. She doesn't need to be above him, she just wants to be his friend.
"Yeah, of course, read any book you want," He chuckled which made her smile brightly. They sat on the couch, Harriet curled up with the book on potions with her fluffy blanket. Merry sat in an armchair, playing with her hair.
Harry frowned at this, she never knew her parents. Her Aunt said they died in a car accident because they were drunk and high. Her dad was a raging alcoholic who was addicted to drugs while her mom was a prostitute who slept with every man she saw. But Harry knew what really happened that night, Voldemort killed her parents and tried to kill her. The reason why it didn't work was because she is magic itself. It has been written since the beginning of time, she is the creator and destroyer of magic. The reason she knew it was of Mr. Feose. Mr. Feose works by her house as a potion maker. They met when she was 4, he was quite scared when an unsupervised toddler walked into his shop with almost no clothes on. He fed her, gave her clothes, and read her stories. Over the years, he let her work for him and she made a few galleons each week. She is so advanced at potions, he fears that the professors at Hogwarts will be scared of an 11 year old having the knowledge of a 40 year old. He was the one who told her about the wizarding world, her parents, and the prophecy. Harry was very thankful for him teaching her and being like a father to her.
"Hang on," Merry texted 'are you awake?' to Harriet. An almost instant response, 'No'. Smart ass response as usual. 'Herbology was canceled, want to watch a movie?'. The response took longer, 'What movie?'. Merry smirked, 'Beetlejuice,' Harriet's favorite movie and in good timing for Halloween. 'Yasssss,' was Harriet's response 'Bring fooddd'
"Well Malfoy I don't care if they think I'm weak or not. Plus this is none of your business and you can't do anything about it so-" Harriet cut off by Merry.
"Transfiguration is more of a hands-on class, so you may like it better," Harriet nodded to herself. They sat in front of the class off to the side because Hermione was sitting right in front of the desk... which had a cat on it.
"Ah, Harriet Potter and Merry Baxter... I remember your parents' wands, I remember every wand I have ever sold and made," He leaned over the counter making both of the girls step back.
"I believe so, I have a lot of books. Didn't help we completely trashed your room basically as soon as we got here," Harriet giggled mischievously.
"Come here," His voice softer but still a bit harsh. She stepped forward and he led her out of storage room into the dead silent class who were all waiting to see what happened. Merry and Pansy grimaced at her arm while Millicent grabbed a towel to help get the goop off. Daphne ran towards her and checked her for any injuries while Tracey whispered comforting words to her.
"Someone released a troll in the dungeons," The young ones gasped in fear except Harriet, "And we wanted to make sure everyone was safe and here because we had to guide the students back to their common rooms."
"Sure," Oh crap, "Well like I said Abbott, MacMillan, Flint, Malfoy, again of course, Parkinson, Greengrass, Bulstrode, Carrow, Nott, Longbottom, Weasley, and Fawley. There is also Burke," Harriet knows there is a portrait of a Burke that encourages Slytherins to call muggleborns Mudbloods, she avoids that painting at all costs. "Avery which the youngest is a friend of Snape, Black which almost every single Pureblood family has at least one Black in it, my mother even was a Black before she married my father. There is Crouch, which really isn't talked about by any prideful Pureblood. Also Rowle, Selwyn, Shafig, Travers, Yaxley are all again in political power or in Azkaban for being a death eater. Shacklebolt is high in political power, very high but only tends to work on the light side of the Wizarding world. The one no one talks about is Gaunt, Gaunt ended technically after Riddle died, Tom Riddle," Draco's voice squeaked a bit when saying his name, "But Gaunt is in other families so it continues to live on. The same thing happened with Prewett, all true members died but it was continued on due to being included in other families."
"No!" Merry shouted which gained the attention of others. She apologized and why everyone got back to what they were doing, she turned to her friends and leaned in.
"Put this on your bruise and we will put ice on it after," He explained. She quickly put most of the vial on and rubbed it into her cheekbone. She knows how to put it on, you use 2 fingers and do 3 clockwise rubs than 5 counterclockwise. The most potion that they make is this one, she gets a lot of bruises.
"That's good," Harriet picked up Beetlejuice. He has been having trouble shedding his skin lately. He seems to be growing more since being out of the small cupboard. "I will miss Hogwarts."
Harriet was confused when she opened up the door and looked down the hallways. No one was around and it was deadly quiet, no one running around or stomping. No screaming or shouting, no pans being smacked against the walls. She aimlessly walked down the halls in her pajamas, she assumed she was heading in the right direction when she saw the large staircase, the same staircase that they were running on the previous night. Harriet really liked it here at the Malfoy's, it was so calm and nice. Draco and Merry were nice to her like always but it was super fun so far since they were bonding as friends. Draco isn't as annoying as Blaise teases him for, he actually is quite caring.
"I promise to train extra hard," He chuckled deeply at her excitement and determination. He only seemed to grunt, growl, or shrug for most of his answers.
"Yep!" Merry giggled while Harriet smiled into her blanket. Cara unlatched the fireplace so they could use the floo, Merry and Harriet went first. Harriet held onto her blanket tightly and Beetlejuice tightly squeezed her torso, he really hates the Floo so they try to use it as little as possible. Harriet closed her eyes while Merry grips her arm so make sure they aren't separated.
"Harriet," She whispered, Harriet groaned and tightened her arm around her waist. "I need to go to the bathroom." Harriet groaned and untangled herself. Merry got up and 'accidentally' kicked Draco awake as she went to the bathroom. Harriet yawned and cuddled against Draco's side. She didn't realize he was awake and jumped a bit when he put his arm around her. She cuddled more into him and laid her head in the crook of his neck while falling asleep. He chuckled and soon fell asleep with her. Merry came back laughing into her hand. She laid down and curled up by herself this time and quickly fell asleep.
"You wasted food! I am not eating here tonight!" Her Aunt came up to her and slapped her on her bruise from Dudley as hard as she could.
"That's amazing! I wish I could have known more in detail of the Wizarding world," She sighed lightly, "I just learned from books so it was really confusing."
"Yep, but that doesn't mean everyone likes the idea. But for the most part, I think people are okay with gays."
"Shit!" She let go of the broom and checked her hand, her palm was bright red and definitely would bruise later.
'Don't worry kitten, this human named Merry will take you home," Harry explained to the cat. Merry looked at her confused.
"Thank god the Professor isn't here yet," The British redhead sighed. The two boys behind him sighed and nodded in agreement. Harriet cringed, as well most of the class did, knowing the Professor was here. The cat jumped off the desk and transformed into their professor mid-jump. All of the boys' faces dropped immediately.
"Alright, amazing job students!" Professor Hooch clapped her hands together. They got off the brooms and put them back in the shed. As Harriet walked back to the castle she could see someone watching her from a window on the 4th floor, Flint.
"She doesn't feel good," Merry nodded sadly. The guys all cooed and groaned in pity and sadness. The older students overheard and started to ask questions.
"You are so selfish! You know that? Can't you think of anyone else for a change!" Her Aunt stomped off, to go finish the dishes. Harriet was left crying in her own cupboard for the rest of the night. She wondered a lot of things that night, why was she treated so differently from Dudley? They were family. Isn't family supposed to love each other? Harriet was rapidly realizing that wasn't true for all families.
"They were excellent people, brilliant also. Your father was an Auror which is like a magical police officer. He loved pranks and jokes. He was loyal and brave to the very core. Your mother was an Auror also and she was the most brilliant witch of her age. She aced every course throughout her 7 years of schooling. She had a temper when it came to your father," He started to chuckle at this. "She always would tell him off if he needed it. She was brave also like your father." He sighed and shifted in his chair. "They- they were so young when they passed. Younger than me even." He rubbed his temples and gulped. "Are you sure you want to know how they died?"
"You think it is right for them to kill the troll!" Harriet whispered harshly while putting on pants and a jacket.
"No, it's alright. You grew up with these people and they mean a lot to you, I understand. It's okay to cry," Harriet calmed Merry down, wiping her tears away.
"When will everyone get-" Harriet started off but saw a pair of twins enter behind Draco. They were scary identical and they were quite willowly with long black hair and a tall frame.
"Coming!" She yelled through the door. She opened the door to see Harriet, who she absolutely loved, held what seemed to see Professor McGonagall in cat form with a slightly amused look and seemed to be in trouble. She stared at the Profesor with a blank look on her face.
"Wait," One ordered. Harry snapped her head up to look into his eyes. There were four Slytherin boys, all towering over her and Merry.
She knocked on her Aunt's door, her face still sore from the last time Dudley pushed her to the ground. She knocked again louder, when Dudley had a nightmare or even cried, Petunia and Vernon always seemed to run to him so they could hold him. The door opened harshly, her Aunt glared at her shivering body.
"Cedric," Harriet grabbed onto his cloak which made him melt, "We need you help, I really don't want the troll to die. Do you?" She pouted. There it is, the Slytherin in her doing something for her advantage. Well its more to the trolls advantage to living but still.
"Wake up, Freak!" Her Aunt shrieked. Harriet simply got up without complaining and went into the kitchen to start breakfast. Her scar has been bubbling with pain lately for some reason. Her scar is like multiple lighting bolts shooting down from the sky and they are pure silver. Harriet's Aunt always complains about how freakish her scar looks. So after a year of searching for makeup products to cover up her scar, they finally found the right product to cover it up. For some unknown reason, the makeup always would work everywhere but her scar. She shutters at the memory of what her Uncle did after she said it was like magic. But she knew she had magic, she knew. Weird things always happen around her like stuff setting on fire and blowing up. She was bleeding for weeks after the incident. Aunt Petunia was screaming about something in the background about uneven curtains which made Harriet's eyes roll. Her Aunt always liked things in perfect order, no matter what it was, it had to be perfect in every way. Harriet really never cared about things being neat like her Aunt because she never had things of her own to keep neat. Harriet was just about to finish breakfast when her Uncle came down, that fat cow. She rushed over to put food on his plate.
"Harriet?" She turned towards Merry confused. "I just want to warn you a bit before the party, so-" Merry patted next to her, Harriet slowly walked over and sat tensely. "You know how Slytherin's tend to be self-preserved. Well, that's mostly because people have betrayed them or hurt them, and they begin to value themselves over people because they know no one else will help them. This causes most Slytherin to become isolated, which can cause bitterness and steer them in the wrong way. A lot of the families, all most all of them, are these type of people. People have hurt them and they turned the wrong way in life. And they tend to spread their negativity to their future generations, so a lot of the people you will meet have very different opinions than you. Their opinions are less," Merry struggled for the right words, to her this was her family she was talking about, "humane and civil. The people that you will meet, to them it's their only happy event in their year. They come from very bad homes and Christmas will others that know their pain, it's very special to them. Slytherin's stick close to those who are similar." Merry had tears dripping down her face, Harriet wiped them away as soon as they fell.
"I know how your parents really died and who they really are," Mr. Feose whispered like he was afraid to even speak about this. Harry couldn't say anything because she was speechless. Someone was going to tell her the truth for once in her life. She continued to stare at him with tears in her eyes until he cleared his throat and started to talk.
"Climb in," He said while climbing in a metal cart. She did while making sure not to slip and fall because it seemed like something she would do. As soon as she sat on a seat, the cart shot of like a rocket which made Harry scream a little bit. The cart went through a series of turns and ups and downs. Harry closed her eyes, not wanting to vomit on the goblin. The cart finally stopped which made Harry sigh in relieve. The goblin looked unfazed by the ride, probably from doing it so much. He got up to the vault and asked for the key. She got up out of the cart, swaying a bit and handed him her key. Griphook opened the vault which was her parents. Harry gasped when she saw the vault filled to the brim with coins. She slowly walked in, she couldn't believe she has so much money! To be honest, it kind of disgusted her to see she had this much money. Other people are poor and homeless while she is the richest person in the Wizarding World and doing nothing with her money. She was afraid before this that she would not have enough for her school supplies and couldn't go to Hogwarts because she would not have the supplies. Harry got frustrated and angry when she remembered all of the times she was in her cupboard starving and wished for death to greet her just to get out of that place. She could have had a normal childhood where she was loved and not hungry but no she had to be with the Dursleys'. She kicked a few coins on the floor and turned to the goblin.
"Everyone pick their favorite tune," Dumbledore said while twinkles in his eyes, "And here we go!" There were the words of the song in the air so the first years could know what to sing.
"'M Ron Weasley," The redhead smiled at her. She swore she could hear Draco scoff in the background.
"Mom, Dad, this is Harriet," Harriet finally paid attention to the older adults in the room. Both were very clean and elegant, their robes fit very nicely like they were tailored. Both were blond like Draco, and both wore black like Draco did. Draco's mother seemed nicer than his father who seemed to study her a bit. She looked down at her shoes, she looked so odd compared to them, they were so fancy and stunningly perfect while she is wearing baggy, messy clothes and her hair a mess, she probably had some dirt on her face too. She just wanted to shrink away from embarrassment, she never belonged to even set foot in this palace.
"Thank you, Mrs. Baxter," Harry said while lightly touching the broom. She had always wanted to fly.
"Well you are just excited to see the cute Quidditch players," Harry teased back. Snape grimaced while Riley chuckled.
"Wait!" Harry shouted and held up her hands. The cat stared at her still mid step but then went back into her sitting position. Harriet stumbled into the kitchen and grabbed a few biscuits that she made and a bowl full of milk. The cat was still sitting patiently waiting, flicking her tail every once and awhile. Harry sat down on the steps and placed the plate and bowl next to her. The cat walked over towards her and sat down in front of her. Harriet awkwardly picked the cat up and laid her down on her lap. She pet her softly, knowing how to pet cats from being babysat from Ms. Figgs. The cat stretched and purred from her gentle pets. She fed the cat ripped off pieces of biscuits and let her drink the milk on her own.
"Yeah I remember that some older girls helped us find our classes on our first day so I thought we could help you guys," She smiled.
"Have fun Harry, write to me soon to tell me what house you are in. You will do perfectly fine, if you have any questions just ask," Mr. Feose hugged her.
"You can sit you know," Millicent gestured to the seat across from her. Merry and Harry sat down. Harry eyed Millicent's cat wondering what the cat would think of Beetlejuice.
~No, I don't know if they are edible~ Harriet hissed back quietly. Beetlejuice grumbled, as much as a snake can grumble, and hid back in her blouse. Harriet quickly puts 3 more eyes in as Merry tried not to throw up.
"I'm Riley Woods." Harry gasped softly, not loud enough to gain any attention. This was the other man who had her keys and was very close to her parents. He knew her parents, he grew up with them.
"Have a nice Holidays Professor," She smiled fakely, just like him. As she walked out of the room, the exciting little toys seemed to lose their excitement and appeal. The lemon drop in her mouth became sour. Her eyes became warm and itchy as she ran back to the common room. It was still early so no one was out, it was the last day before break so no classes and everyone wanted to sleep in. She sat down on the couch in the middle of the common room and wiped her eyes. This was going to be her first holidays, her first holidays ever really, with people who actually care about her and she doesn't even get to have it.
"A bit excited are we?" Severus raised an eyebrow at Draco but hugged him none the less. Riley patted his head and looked up to see Harriet hiding near the corner.
"I'm Harriet Potter but everyone calls me Harry," Harry blushed and covered her scar more with her hair. The three Hufflepuffs gasped but said nothing.
"They seem so lonely down here," Merry whispered almost in tears. Harry nodded wiping away some already fallen tears, she knew best what it was like to be alone. Harry promised that they would come down here to talk to them every single day. Most of the paintings cried out in joy, some left the frame because they were so emotional. One of the paintings was a young girl in yellow robes who looked a bit off. She was Merry's favorite, she had a lisp and was the most excited to see them. Apparently, she was sorted a Hufflepuff but was later sorted into Slytherin because she lost her mind. When she lost her mind, she gained Slytherin qualities and values. There were multiple famous Slytherin witches and wizards, each told them their stories and why they were famous. One witch was famous for killing her husband who was abusive and became at the time the smartest witch of the century. Another witch was famous for saving Merlin from death. A wizard was famous for creating the first wand that would replace the staff. Another wizard was famous for assassinating the Minister who was trying to mind control the wizarding world. Every single painting was of famous Slytherins, there had to be around 3 dozen or more paintings. For some reason this filled Harry with determination, if they could make something of themselves, she could too. Harry's favorite painting was an old wizard with a huge anaconda who speaks Parseltongue like her. He immediately took interest in her along with his snake, Apep. Apep is the meaning of the personification of evil. Apep was abandoned as a young hatchling because he was the last one born and was too weak to carry on. Yvain Bolequaid, the old wizard, took Apep in when he saw him in his own backyard. They apparently were inseparable since that day. Yvain passed away when he was murdered by his father. Yvain was in love with a muggle, a muggle boy. His father was enraged and used the killing curse on him but only after using the cruciatus curse for over an hour. The wizard said that the muggle who he was in love with died a year later. Yvain thinks he took his own life. The way Yvain spoke about his lover in a way that made Harry's heart sink but yet sore in ways she never thought possible. She only could wish that she could have a love so deep like theirs despite the tragic ending. They promised to see them the next day and talk more. Beetlejuice really liked Apep, they quickly became close friends. Much like Harry became really close to Merry. Merry wiped away some tears while Harry rubbed her nose.
Sorry for the long wait, stuff got in the way. Don't worry I will update tomorrow or Friday with a longer chapter XP
"Oh yes, thank you so much," She giggled and followed him out of the Great Hall after waving goodbye to her friends. They talked about quidditch and Christmas plans on the way there.
"Why do you even want to do this?" Merry asked while tightening her cloak around herself. It didn't seem as cold earlier but the temperature must drop significantly after hours.
"Well done, 5 points to Slytherin for actually caring to open up a book before class," He nodded and began to start the lesson. Harriet feel the pride run through her veins.
"Yes I am fine," She hissed back while she ran her fingers across his scales. He was a Black Strangler, every kid was warned about how poisonous this snake was. It was the most poisonous snake known. When bitten the venom would make you feel like you were getting strangled. Beetlejuice only bites on command plus Harry always carries around an antidote just in case. He was pitch black on top that slowly faded into bright red on the bottom. He also had a red tongue and black eyes. Beetlejuice was as long as her arm and as thick as her wrist.
Harriet opened the door, realizing she still didn't have pants on. It was Gemma, the Head girl, "Hello Harriet, are all the first year girls in there?" She asked rushed.
"She will shop with me and my mother, do you have a problem with that Terri?" Merry snapped back and put her hand on her hip. The lady just hung her head which made Merry smirk.
"Harriet Potter," She liked the fact that he didn't look at her scar or say 'I know that'. She liked this weird Irish wizard.
"No, I really don't ask things about my heritage to her," Merry shifted uncomfortably. Harriet backed off seeing how Merry reacted.
"100 galleons will be added to the pouch each month," Griphook explained. She nodded and took a big breath because of the emotions running through her. Relief, happiness, and something else she could not explain. She started to walk back to the cart and mentally prepare herself. The ride was the same on the way back except Harry almost did throw up. She was still gagging when they stopped. She got out of the cart and thanked the goblin for taking her to her vault. The goblin looked very shocked but smiled at her after his shock wore off. She skipped out of Gringotts while humming a tune. She could finally get away from the Dursleys', she can finally have a normal, nice life.
"Up," She whispered quietly with her arm out. The broom immediately slammed into her hand with a loud audible smack. Merry burst out laughing at the face Harriet made at the loud smack.
"You will get one soon," He teased back. She went to the Dursleys' house later and saw no one home. She didn't have anywhere to put her trunk so she kept it in her pocket. She put on some old clothes so they wouldn't find out where she was. She texted Merry that she was home and that she was going to bed. She took a quick shower and quickly fell asleep smiling for the first time instead of crying.
Merry walked the halls alone, feeling a bit lost without Harriet. They had become very close in only a few months, they just got along so good. They helped each other with everything from homework to more personal things. Merry knows about Harriet's constant nightmares and she knows about Merry's personal problems like self-image and confidence.
"You are very welcome, I hope you use the knowledge from the books usefully," He drawled out as he looked at her calculatingly.
Pansy smirked over her own tea, taking a small sip and placing the cup on its saucer delicately.  “Have you shagged him?”  She repeated, her grin turning feral.
“Mate, you’re over thinking this.”  Dean binned the containers for his dinner and leaned over Seamus and swiped some stray rice from his lip.  “Just knock on his door tomorrow after Ron’s left.  You have nothing to worry about.  He’s going to say yes.”
“Perfect,” grinned Blaise.  “Tell them we’ll be down shortly.”  The elf nodded and without another word disapparated with a loud snap.  Draco stood from the settee and extended his arm for Pansy.  She slipped her arm through his without a word, placing her palm on his forearm.  Blaise looked at them with an amused smirk.  “You two ready?”
“Why are you telling me all this?”  Draco asked, his head starting to feel lightheaded.  Perhaps the champagne was catching up with him after all.
“Don’t listen to anything out of those two.  They are horrible liars and I’m still absolutely atrocious,” Draco huffed, crossing his arms.  Ok, so maybe he still hadn’t gotten over the fact that they took advantage of his drunken state and got him to admit that Potter was sweet.  Ugh, gross.  Draco didn’t think any such thing.
Whatever the reason, Draco was truly helpless in this situation.  He’d just finished a grueling week of training, avoiding the general public at all costs, and hiding away in his dormitory.  But now here he was, drinking a gin and tonic in a dark corner of some hole in the wall place that’d Draco had never heard of, while Pansy came sauntering over, carrying her own glass of wine.
made Draco sick to his stomach more often than not.  He managed to find one wing of the manor untouched from Voldemort’s filth—his old nursery.  He’d transfigured his old crib into a suitable bed, and wore his school wardrobe more than anything.  He didn’t even want to step foot in his old bedroom, he was afraid of what shadows lurked there.
Looking down at Draco with eyes blown wide, Harry searched his face intently.  “What would you like?” He asked, his voice cracking.
“And he lives here with you?” Draco asked, somewhat confused.  Why would Granger’s cat be here and not with her?
if it’s something embarrassing.  But Draco, that’s not even that bad as you are making it out to be.  Listen, you’ll be fine.  Just go to him and tell him the truth.  There’s no way he’d even react in a negative way to it.  But if on the off chance he does, Seamus and I will break down his door and beat the ever-loving crap out of him.”
“Yeah....”  He responded, as if in a trance.  Harry had pulled out the peppermint stick and was nibbling on the tip and Draco had lost all rational thought.
He slid his hand from Malfoy’s waist to finally grip the other man’s cock.  It was hot to the touch, and so very swollen.  At any other time, Harry would have marveled at the size as well, but his mind was decidedly blank and only focused on the feel of Malfoy’s arse clenching around him completely.  He wasn’t going to last much longer.  He needed to feel all of him...and now.
“I don’t need a Puddlemere United player either, but it’s something I want.”  She winked, finishing off her drink.  She started to stand, and Draco quickly rushed to finish his drink as well and begin to put his coat on.  “Let’s go dear, I’ll tell you about it on the way home.”
“Fucking hell,” Draco moaned, his cock throbbing in Harry’s strong grip.  Then Harry bent down again and took him deep, his eyes never leaving Draco’s.  He held Draco for one more agonizing slide, and then released his grip.  Draco shouted, feeling his climax immediately, and watched as Harry greedily swallowed it all.  The image of Harry’s eyes smoldering as Draco came will be forever burned in Draco’s mind.
“Right,” Harry smiled knowingly.  “Well I guess if you don’t want to try being friends, we can try to go back to being stupid rivals.  It’s kind of not the same without separate houses, different Quidditch teams, and threatening to get the other into detention though...”
Draco eyed Potter carefully, all the while the music continued to surround them, jingle bells this time.  The other man was dressed in one of those atrocious sweaters once more, garland wrapped around him like a shawl, and a red Santa hat covered most of his ridiculous mess of hair.  “Yeah you’re festive all right,” he attempted to tease, but the tone had no bite and for some reason he was having a hard time keeping a straight face.
It seemed like an evening like any other.  Draco had finished studying on the common abbreviations used in Auror reports and he was in need of tea if he was going to finish through the whole assignment.  He peeked into the common area, was relieved to see it empty, and made his way to the kettle around the corner.  Standing there, he rubbed at his eyes while he waited for the pot to boil.
“Right, well,” Draco looked pointedly at Dean.  “I’ll need some alone time with him.  Do you think you can manage to not walk in on us this time around?”
Perhaps, since he was already dressed, he could go visit the gym downstairs and finish what remained of his daily workout.  He typically preferred running outside, avoiding people at all costs.  But he figured it’d be early enough that maybe no one would be there.  And that seemed to be the case, when he pushed open the door and stepped inside.  He let out a breath of relief, pulling one leg up to stretch, followed by the next.  Then he started to run the track surrounding the perimeter of the room.  His mind wonderfully blank for once.
Hours later and they were stumbling through the Floo back into the dorm.  Draco had fallen gracelessly over Harry and they were giggling, trying to make their way to the couch.  “Merlin, I can’t believe Blaise actually asked her to move in,” Harry laughed, shaking his head.
The wet rag inched slowly to his nose and mouth, where the pain was most intense.  Draco winced as Potter made contact with his nose.  “Sssh,” soothed the other man.  “I have to clean you up first, before I can apply the potion.  There’s so much blood...”  Draco simply tilted his head, giving a small nod and leaning closer to allow Potter better access.
"There still are more," Draco cleared his throat, he twitched at the interbreeding part, "Ollivander-"
"His name is Fawkes," Harriet squeaked at the sudden voice but Flint just stared at the new voice's owner.
"He said about a month," She rocked back and forth, she had a lot to do so she wouldn't seem like an amateur.
"Are you going to Hogwarts too?" She asked while twirling a little in place. The girl had an amber, messy look to her hair and purple eyes. She had a really nice smile and perfectly straight teeth. The girl was more... developed than Harry which caused Harry to blush from even looking. She was wearing a really pretty, short purple dress that matched her eyes really nicely. She also was wearing quite a bit of makeup.
As the weeks went on, Harriet was introduced to more classes like Astronomy and Herbology. Out of all of her classes, both of them used muggle technology the most. Both classes had a webpage where they put each lesson on it so the students could explore the study more. Astronomy seemed a bit boring to Harriet in the beginning but as the weeks went on she started to enjoy it. Astronomy was a night but she was a night owl anyway so she didn't mind. Although Merry was always ready to fall asleep on her at any moment during the class. At first, she didn't really understand why they had to take the class but she found out the importance of the class like how learning the where the stars are can help navigate you. Herbology was the same thing for her, the class seemed a bit bored in the beginning but she soon figured out the importance of the class. It was useful to identify all of the different plants so in her professor's words 'They didn't die in a slow and painful death'. Harriet was acing all of her classes and was impressing her professors and peers with her advance knowledge. Apparently, the professors thought she was going to be like her father who was quite bad at the courses. But Mr. Feose told her, after she mentioned it to him in a text, that her father just simply didn't do the work but he was quite clever.
"I brought something!" Merry sang as she cracked open the door to see Harriet still curled up in bed with one eye open.
"I am Gemma Farley, Head Girl, and this is Jason Zang, Head Boy," The boy just seemed to growl at the first years. The girl seemed nice enough to Harry. "We will be showing you to your dorms and home for the next 7 years." With that the prefects and Slytherin first years left to go to the dungeons.
"Harriet the truth is that even if you fail to catch the snitch, the whole team fails individually. It's not the seeker's fault for the lost," Mark explained, also trying to calm her down.
"What I bet this boat was never clean?" Merry whined. They had to wait a bit to make sure all of the first years were in the boats. When they were ready to go the large man got into a bigger boat and they all took off. Harry let her fingertips touch the water gliding along the surface of the water. Merry elbowed her in the ribs gasping.
"Well that's why I'm here to make sure it's not serious and how I can help you feel better," He smiled at her. He tapped her forehead with his elegant wand.
"You are talking in English but it sounds different for some reason like a purring noise on top of it," Merry tried to explain. Harry nodded her head. A sales person came by them to ask if they wanted the cat.
"Really? That's quite impressive, Draco is thinking about trying out next year for chaser. He has been practicing almost non stop all break," Narcissa compliments her while also being proud of her own son.
"Oh bullshit, I'll deck him!" Harriet has just a bit of a temper, just a bit which usually ends in her punching someone.
"But I'm not scared of him, he took away everything from me, everything," Merry and Draco said nothing, "But that's why I'm not afraid, I have nothing."
"Let's go," Harry sniffed and rubbed her nose. They walked to History of Magic together while talking about how boring this class was supposed to be.
"No, I was going to go up after eating with some food to see how she was," Merry explained while popping in a strawberry.
"Thank you," She said honestly, she was so stunned that Merry paid attention to how she always looked at the other girls who did some type of makeup so fascinated in wonder. They tore into more presents, Harriet still undoing the wrapping paper gently. Narcissa still taking pictures while the kids tore into their gifts. Draco got mostly books and clothes, Merry got mostly jewelry and sweets. Harriet got some books from Cara, most of them about conspiracies and dragons, and some nice robes from the Malfoys which made her almost tear up, she didn't expect such thoughtful gifts. Draco got her some fancy chocolates which she thanked him for greatly, she loves chocolate sweets the most. She opened up the last present which was from Riley and Severus, she stared at it in wonder. There were a few books about advanced potions, all of them she has never seen before.
After eating, the group left for the house tent so Flint could give a speech. His speech was a bit boring but she could admit that she could see the passion in his dark eyes and deep voice. She smiled at his passion for this sport, it seemed to be dripping off him and filling the tent. She felt his pride and passion surround her and make her skin feel alive and buzz. After he was finished, she could still feel the excitement. It calmed her for some reason. Her legs and arms shook as they walked to the gates, Flint ruffled her hair again before the gates opened. Flint climbed on his broom first and flew out, then her, then the other chasers, then the beaters, then the keeper. She looked around to see the whole school, cheering and the place shook with excitement. They got into positions, the Gryffindors glared at the Slytherins and vice versa. Harriet smiled at the Gryffindor beaters who smiled back.
“So, let me get this straight.  You ran away with your tail between your legs all because Harry fucking Potter
” Shouted Draco, Edward’s wand flying toward him.  He caught it, then leaped from the couch, running from Edward and trying to keep his distance.  Harry wasted no more time and pointed at Edward, a silent
“No, Merlin,” then Harry’s face began to darken, as he took a shaky breath.  Draco’s eyes lifted curiously.  “You look...fuck, you look
“Going to use some other wandless trick?” Draco mumbled.  He had his arm draped over his face, eyes shut and completely spent.
He snorted, flipping over the pages once more.  The Prophet hadn’t the faintest idea, had they?  Draco let his eyes wander listlessly over the advertisements on the following page.  So many businesses urging people to purchase their products for Christmas.  He really needed to take the time to do his own shopping.  His mind was trying to come up with various gifts to give Pansy, when the Floo flared and Harry stumbled out of the fireplace.
, his brain added unhelpfully.  “And you’re right.  These jeans were a recent purchase, with the help of Pansy.”
Draco glared daggers at him.  But before he could tell him off, Dean placed the mug with snitches in front of Seamus.  “Here you go babe.”  Then in the next moment, another mug was set in front of Draco.  It wasn’t his typical plain white mug.
The next morning, the sunlight filtered through the drapes of the window which created a reddish orange glow throughout the bedroom.  Draco and Harry were tangled up together underneath the covers, and they wouldn’t have it any other way.  When the light hit Draco’s face, he blinked open his eyes and finally took the time to notice the room.
“I’m a mess,” groaned Draco, looking at his stomach that was covered in his release.  He needed his wand to clean himself.  His wand that was in his pocket—his trousers too far away.  It was too much of an effort and Draco didn’t trust himself to stand right at this moment.
This snapped Harry out of it and he stood up abruptly.  No way was that tosser going to come just yet, Harry hadn’t even fucked him!  He wrapped an arm around his waist, effectively pulling the other man up even more, so his arse was perched at the perfect angle.  Not waiting another moment more, Harry gripped his leaking cock and drove on home.
“Guys,” Blaise cut in.  Both Draco and Pansy turned to him.  “Thank you for being here tonight.  This is a big night for me.  The reason I’ve spent so long picking out an outfit...”
He took a few deep breaths, attempting to relax.  His erection had subsided somewhat, and he couldn’t really focus on much of anything at all but the tight pressure of Harry inside of him.  “Give me a moment,” he urged.
“Not going to happen,” he shuddered.  Harry had reached his belt and was unbuckling it.  His breath left him in a rush when Harry reached inside his pants to stroke him.  “Harry,” Draco whined, already feeling himself reacting much too quickly.
“Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Parkinson.  I’m Ginevra Weasley and the youngest and only daughter of Molly and Arthur Weasley,” she smiled warmly.  “I must admit, attending this party is very unlike anything I’ve done before.  However, Blaise seems to get me to think and do things I wouldn’t normally consider.  Thank you for the invitation.  It’s a beautiful party.”
“Now enough about that, let me tell you about Neville.  Have you seen him lately, Draco?  The man has grown to be super fit!”
“Are you sure we’re talking about the same Longbottom here?” he asked in disbelief.  He finished his own drink and then reached for one of the shot glasses.
“All right, fine,” she crossed her arms in irritation.  “Let me just help you, I have this handy potion that’ll make it easier for you to sleep.  It’ll help with those dark circles too.”  Uncrossing her arms, she started to rifle through her over sized leather bag.  Apparently, it was made by some fancy Muggle designer Draco had never heard of, but then again, he still had a lot to learn concerning Muggles.
They walked side by side, Pansy’s London flat was several blocks away.  The air around them was getting colder, and Draco cast a quick discrete warming charm over them.  When they were comfortable, Pansy began once more, “I just am ready for something new, Draco.  There’s only so much shopping and fashion shows and galas a girl can do.  I’m ready for a change.  I want to do something meaningful.”
Harry grinned, kissing the corner of Draco’s lips.  “Ok,” he giggled, grabbing Draco’s hand.  They skipped out of the living room, practically giddy with what just happened and what was about to happen in Draco’s bedroom.
“That’s different,” he groaned, rubbing at his temples.  “You didn’t see how they all acted when I stepped foot in that dorm.  It was chaos, Pansy, utter chaos.  Weasel was as red as his hair and up in my face.  If Thomas weren’t there to hold him back, I would have been beaten to a pulp.”
Draco was on his second glass of champagne, leaning against the grand piano of the hall.  He was alone, because Pansy had decided to be a hag this evening.  He told her she’d looked fine when she walked down the stairs an hour ago.  She was not pleased and turned around and vanished up to her room once more.  He didn’t understand why she was upset or why she needed to bother any longer on her appearance.  Draco was her date after all.  It was not like it was really a date—it's just something they’ve done for years to keep up appearances.
He heard the murmur of the crowd rise, and spotted them a second later.  His eyes widened in alarm, and before he could really process what he was looking at, Blaise caught his eyes and broke out into a beaming smile.  He pulled Ginny along with him, and Draco tried to school his features.
“I am happy,” he lied, looking down at his Auror issued boots.  The dragonhide leather was still impeccable, haven’t even broken into.  Boots he rarely even had to use just yet.
“Oh...what the hell,” Harry chuckled, then he was leaning over Draco.  Harry wrapped a hand around his neck and pulled him close, pressing his lips against Draco’s.  This kiss was soft and sweet, and ended very quickly.  But Draco could vaguely hear Dean and Seamus cheering them on, which did nothing to help Draco’s blush.
Once it was all over, Draco still kept running.  He served his house arrest, running more often than he ever had before.  He hated staying inside his house, the residual magic from
“Are you all right?” he asked, his face leaning in and closer than he really needed to be.  That certainly wasn’t helping Draco breathe any easier right now.
He avoided all of them, kept to his room.  Occasionally, yes, he had to run out into the communal living room and kitchen to make a meal now and then.  But he always waited till it seemed quiet, or late at night when everyone else had turned in.
Draco snorts and finishes off a second bottle of wine. “I keep on thinking about all the things he hated about me and how I’ve doubled down on them. Like animals, he hated animals and I have a crup, a dog
“Remember when our fathers went sailing together, and they were gone for 14 hours and we thought they died? Remember how formative that was, Draco?”
“See this?” Draco grabs a pair of tweezers and picks a glowing stringy object off of his desk. “This is a dragon heartstring. It’s worth almost as much as this building. If Death Eaters had come through, they wouldn’t have left it.”
Draco spends most of winter break intent on proving Lupin wrong. So what if he can’t quite cast a patronus the traditional way? That’s never stopped him before.
“Ignore her!” Potter says. “She’s trying to distract us. We just need to fly through the wards and then we can apparate away. We’re almost there.”
Pan continues. “By mass the universe is mostly celestial bodies. So Astrology is studying the way the factors that affect your magic affect you. Paying attention.”
into letting them stay in her beach house. Catchlove spat on Narcissa when they first arrived, but by the end of their two-week stay, her cheese was charmed. She willingly gave the aurors details of her own crime — a very high-profile insider trading case — to distract them from their search for the Malfoys. Catchlove had happily gone to jail for five months because Narcissa asked her to.
“More or less,” Harry says. “We never got to the bargaining part because the horcruxes, ah … called the Death Eaters to us when Draco touched them.”
In theory, yes. He’s keyed into the wards; as long as they all join hands, the four of them can leave. But that means — leaving behind those he came here to rescue, giving up his only chance of getting the twins out. Narcissa will change the wards as soon as she realizes he'd escaped. If he leaves, he can’t come back.
In the center, an old wooden table Draco has eaten many, many breakfasts at currently inhabited by Ron, crying into a ham sandwich.
Dawlish, Crabbe, Dolohov, Yaxley. Harry hit with a spell, falling in the snow. Draco in a body-bind. Ron and Hermione dragged from the tent. Crucio. Crucio. Crucio.
“Everyone always stares at me when we go out, and it’s not because I’m hot. You’d think people would realize that I’m there to dance the same way they’re there to dance. They should leave me alone.”
says Harry), the rows and rows of Crups you assemble for yourself and then bring to life with IKEA’s trademarked
“Yes. That’s snake tongue. Never speak it. If you do, people will realize that you’re not exactly what you say you are, that
“You’re being dramatic,” Pan says when he brings the point up to them. “It’s a barbaric idea, of course, proof Dumbledore is completely uninterested in the schooling function of Hogwarts. But the Dementors aren’t allowed on school grounds, and I see no benefit in worrying about them being on school grounds until they’re on school grounds.”
He bangs his fist on the table, but Draco doesn’t want to move on. No matter could be quite as important as this one. “What do you mean
Potter runs a large knife under water. Takes out a towel and starts to dry it off, rubbing up and down its length. Draco follows the motion, transfixed.
“Oh Draco,” Lupin sighs. “You remind me so much of someone I used to know. You’re stubborn in exactly the way he was.”
Black pants tucked into black combat boots. A black button-down with a gold dragon skeleton flittering across the front, open almost to their navel. Black nail polish on each thumbnail. A shaved head with a constellation etched into each side. Across the right side: Leo, their star sign. Beside their left ear: Pisces, their brother Paxton’s.
“Are you trying to make sure you don’t forget something?” Hermione asks, a mirror of an image she no longer remembers. She asked the same question on that first first Sunday in June.
There’s another long pause. “I can get you into the Manor. It won’t be through Crabbe, but I can get you into the Manor and that’s all the information I can give you and you’re going to have to be fine with that. Tonight? How’s tonight? Wait, no, not tonight. Let me think. Monday morning at dawn. I’ll make Monday morning at dawn work.”
Right. Because they had almost done real damage to each other yesterday. Draco likes Working Potter Up for Sport, but now that he’s slept and the grief is less raw, he can admit that he may have pushed things too far. “I didn’t mean what I said in the shop. It wasn’t about you.”
Harry groans, kisses him again and again. He’s always found polyjuice to be clarifying. His body drops away; he shrinks to his very essence, to the parts of himself that are most necessary. Like kissing Draco.
His question gives Draco enough time to slam the door, hopefully sending a clear message to the crowd inside:
Draco leans down and kisses his hand. Harry feels the burn pass from Draco to him, feels the fire inside him dim. He gets older by two year, three.
For the second time in an hour, the room disappears. The night sky is swallowed up by the type of darkness people mean when they say they’re afraid of the dark. Draco shivers and falls into it.
Potter’s hand untangles from his hair and settles onto his leg. It arches into a claw and starts to dig into denim.
Draco hadn’t been too far off in his mental comparison of Ollivander to a mob boss, though the details are
“I have a source; that’s all I’m going to tell you. I’ll owl you directions on where and how to meet them, but otherwise this is like, Super Top Secret Order Stuff, and I can’t tell you anything more. Especially because … well, it just wouldn’t be good. Also, it’s now been seven minutes and I really really do not want to get caught so Draco, Ron, I love you. Harry and Hermione, it was excellent learning that you’re still alive. Ohhhh I really wish I didn’t have to hang up. Bye.”
“You can’t. Nobody can. Nobody understands. I knew what darkness looked like before I knew how to talk. Don’t you think that kind of knowledge does something to you? Understanding is an active verb. It’s where I live.”
