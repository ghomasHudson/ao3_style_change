“H-Harry-” stutters Justin, red in the face and flustered. His white shirt is crumbled and Harry realises that he must have been clinging onto it.
Malfoy is sitting more or less in the same spot as yesterday. He is wearing thick winter robes today, likely because of the overnight drop in temperature. Draping over him in a blatantly expensive fashion, they are thick enough that they don’t budge under the force of the wind. Though, it is far less gusty than it was at their previous rendezvous. As a result, his snowy hair has not been as chaotically whipped around. Harry finds that he wishes it was.
Malfoy side-eyes him then, his face painted in minute bemusement. “Wouldn’t that be a miracle.” Something flashes in his silver gaze.
Malfoy.
He laughs, “I won’t be.”
“What are you up to?” he accuses, “You’ve been skulking around for weeks. Don’t deny it.”
As he watches the smile lines of Ron’s colossal grin melt his frown away, his annoyance fades. He vows to himself that he would take a thousand soppy glitter bombs if it were to make Ron forget about his own misgivings for even a moment. The bubbles glide above the two of them, ostentatiously pink and twinkling, and he lets his frustration fly away with them.
“It’s okay, Malfoy, someone is coming. You’ll be fine,” he mutters. It is so quiet that Malfoy probably wouldn’t even be able to hear it were he to be listening, but it is more for Harry’s sake than anything.
Malfoy breathes again, which is more than can be said for Harry.
“It’s nothing,” replies Harry and he means it. “I enjoyed it. Honestly, let me know if you need any more help.”
When they find Ron outside Zonkos, they are greeted with quite the spectacle. They can tell that something is wrong from the get-go, because his best mate seems to be whimpering. Upon realisation, Hermione slaps her hand over her mouth, and it only takes Harry a couple of beats to follow. A picture of total despair, Ron is slouched on the bench with his head in his hand. All around him lies locks of ginger.
“No, no. Thank god,” he says with a profound sigh, “I might have, had my mum not found me an alternative. This. It’s called Asmandrius, and it acts similarly but the effects aren’t as drastic. It basically just dulls your senses once you are asleep, rather than actually sending you to sleep itself. It also meant that Elliot could wake me up if need be unlike Dreamless, which completely knocks you out. Might’ve freaked him out, y’know- to find his boyfriend practically like a corpse in the night.”
He straightens out the toy, ignoring the fact that it really is quite sweet, and that he would not mind one himself. Malfoy has a plush
That seems too precarious, too unstable to be an ingredient. Of course, it is also possible that it could be linked to whatever spell Malfoy seems to be routinely practising. Whilst not a Patronus Charm, the silver bursts of light indicate that it could be perhaps within the same realm.
“Well, no, but you would think that since we just finished, y’know, fighting an evil wizard, they might’ve cut us a bit of bloody slack. I thought Mcgonagall was going to bite my head off when I didn’t have my Transfiguration textbook. Not like it really matters now, if we’re being honest.”
Returning it, Harry tries not to wince at the mention of Fred. It turns out biology doesn’t matter so much when it comes to grief; any illusions about it not hurting were shattered the moment he walked into the service for the funeral. He sees Fred’s laugh in the way the sun grins down at them now, just a little.
too.” Justin gives him a look that makes his insides squirm. “If he was the guy of your dreams, he would deal with it.”
Malfoy has left already, despite it being only around seven AM on a Saturday. Harry wonders whether he is a morning person, or whether he had just made it his business to be gone by the time Harry awoke. The latter would not shock him after their awkward interaction the night before. He had concluded at some point in his fits of fear that it would be simpler to return to their disdain for each other, than any model of civility.
Malfoy creeps away into the dead of night, a thin figure drowned by the shadows, and Harry stares at the empty space left behind until the Siren’s song of his bed cannot be resisted any longer, and he trudges off too, hoping that he doesn’t run into Malfoy in their dorm room.
“No, don’t,” Hermione interjects from beside him. The ginormous ink blot has snuck onto her cheeks now, marring her dark skin, and Harry distantly thinks about how they should probably tell her. He won’t. Secretly he adores her most like this, a little frazzled, a little messy, and oh so full of ideas.
Today, Harry stands with nothing
“It’s considered an abuse of power when done from teacher to student. I’m actually not sure about between students, though,” Hermione admits, looking extremely disappointed to not know something. She scratches her nose like she does when she is in deep thought. The ink on her finger smudges onto her nose and the silliness of it takes away from her seriousness. Ron snorts but she doesn’t take any notice, doing it again and spreading the black splodge onto her cupid’s bow.
“Going to hurt me, Potter?” Malfoy says with his chin in the air, and he stares at Harry with the question written on his face. He is shaking.
“Really? Hmm,” says Malfoy, “Perhaps you’re going mad, Potter,” and he raises an arched eyebrow. Whether this is an invitation for a challenge, Harry isn’t sure, but he takes it as one anyway.
Any moment Malfoy will call for Madam Pomfrey, and Harry will have to take the hit to his ego and leave peacefully. Or he can run out here now; maybe it would let him keep some of his dignity to do it of his own accord. There would be heavy chagrin at having to be marched out by the school nurse at the age of eighteen.
Harry nods stiltedly, not really hearing what Dean is saying, and stumbles out of the room  just as the pair break into giggles. It is in the nick of time, if the gasps and continued ruffles of clothing ringing down the corridor are any indication.
“Also, I
He rifles through the books in the discounted pile, immediately understanding why the prices have been knocked down. All of them are torn and damaged in some way, many so drastically that Harry can’t even fathom how it could have happened. One has a suspicious yellow stain spread all across the cover, and he warily avoids touching it. Disturbingly, another seems to be splattered in blood and he starts backing away in a mix of disgust and panic. Whatever alcohol-infused warmth was inside of him runs cold and he feels more sober than ever. The red blots trigger memories; at the forefront, he sees Fred’s bleeding body, and he counts his fingers in an attempt to calm his breathing.
“Come on, Harry,” Hermione whispers under her breath, “We have to move on now or somebody will wonder what is up.”
She laughs, loud even with the phone as a buffer, and Harry is thrown back into the memory of that summers day in the bustling grass of Hyde park.
The takeaways- Merlin, he admits freely that he would trade a Hogwarts meal for just one portion of Chow Mein Singapore Noodles in an instant, greasy as they may have been. There was something special about their tradition of watching Ron fumble with the TV remote whilst they spooned bucketfuls of fried vegetables into their ravenous mouths.
“I‘ll tell you the same thing I told Mcgonagall and every other fucking teacher who has come to interrogate me today: I don’t know. One moment I was taking a walk, the next thing I know I’m on the floor,” snaps Malfoy, hostile.

(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy doesn’t respond for a moment. Harry thinks he sees something akin to humiliation flicker in his eyes, but it disappears and he distorts his face into a scowl. It all seems a little practised to Harry. A bit too robotic. Putting his book down on the duvet, Malfoy narrows his eyes dramatically. He seems to assess the situation, and then answers in a manner so calm it completely shocks Harry.
The paper taunts him, hanging slightly out of the pocket as Malfoy leaves the room without any farewell. When Justin turns to ask Harry a question, he is met with Harry’s stare following the vision of the sheet, even after it is long gone.
Sorry, Hagrid. Harry appreciates the input, and any sane person would run with it, but it doesn’t seem likely that he is going to be able to just switch his mind off like that. Even if he wanted to make nice, Malfoy clearly doesn’t.
Then, slowly but surely, his adrenaline fades. His heartbeat comes back down from the heights to which it skyrocketed. Clarity creeps in.
to the hair, he seems to wake up with it twice the length it had been before the chop. It’s clearly living with its own trauma, which he can understand at least.
The smell inside the store is musty, however not necessarily in a negative way. It is the type of scent that indicates an astonishingly old age, perhaps one that has been built up over a millenia. Not Harry’s favourite fragrance, he will admit, but it does make him think of Grimmauld Place. Whether that is a gratifying reminder or not, he isn’t sure.
“Calm down, Potter. No need to look like a kicked puppy,” continues Malfoy, surprising Harry. He had begun to wonder whether that would be their parting words. “I’m sorry that I don’t fancy being another one of your projects. I just mean to say that sometimes it would be nice to not feel like I owe you.”
So very weird.
is what he wants to scream in his face. He would, if he weren’t such a humongous coward.
“Do you have any alternative choices in mind?” she asks after a while.
Harry trudges to the toilet to relieve himself and catches himself with displeasure in the mirror as he does so. Annoyed, he wiggles his eyebrows just to check that the figure staring back at him is not an impostor. He has gotten skinnier over the summer and his skin has an unattractive pale sheen to it, as if he is unwell. At least that would easily explain away to any questioning eyes why, in these past months, he has barely seen the outside of his room.
After the blur of people, deafening and relentless, at Platform 9 and 3/4, Harry is breathing heavily and alone in the first empty compartment that he had found. He’s not sure where Hermione and Ron are; he thinks he might have lost them in the crowd in his rush to get on the train.
At first, he is concerned that Malfoy has gotten himself into some sort of trouble again. Since the time outside Harry’s Defence lesson, there haven’t been any more public attacks on him, but Harry has frequently been worried that they may have turned private. Even more disturbing, is the fact that Malfoy is legally bound not to defend himself on the grounds of his probation. He is a free punching bag. And though everyone else seems to have forgotten this fact, the knowledge that the boys were never identified concerns Harry greatly. His gut says they are a real danger, that maybe this is linked to whatever Malfoy is up to.
“Bye Harry,” Neville waves and turns to walk down the corridor, which runs in the other direction. He only gets approximately halfway though, before sprinting back. “Wait!” Just thought I’d let you know that I think Malfoy is awake. I heard Pomfrey talking about it earlier when I swung by for something.”
They take a detour on their way back from the grounds to visit Hermione, who is so busy in the library that she doesn’t even take any notice of Harry’s current state. Her hair is pulled back into a low bun, but strands are flinging free by the second. He believes the whole style is dangerously close to imploding into a mass of curls any minute now, and so he stands a few steps back. Poor Ron is on the front-line, hugging her from behind.
He waits for Hermione to reply, in hope that he can keep any of this temporary interest at bay. Maybe it's just a case of being out of sight, out of mind. Or out of speech, out of mind. Whatever.
“Hey, Harry,” smiles Justin from beside him, rubbing his eyes, “Sleep well?”
This causes the boy to retreat into himself a little, taken aback by his own boldness. Harry should rescind his comment, but wouldn’t even if he could. It’s electric- not having to think about his reputation, or about sugar-coating his thoughts for others.
Ron frowns pensively before saying, “I dunno actually. Maybe I should ask Seamus, he’s the one I heard it all from.”
This isn’t what happens.
“Oh stop it, you,” she elbows his side, “You should really listen some time, both of you. It’s awfully fascinating and it could do you both some good to enrich yourselves with knowledge outside of schoolwork. If only you knew how to pick up a book.”
LONG BOY!! almost 10k i think?? harry is extra depressed plus some spicy arguments. all fun things, clearly x
“So,” Harry says, unable to hold it in any longer. He ignores Malfoy’s glare, not giving a fuck whether he has interrupted a good part in the book, or whatever, “You’re the owner of a toy dragon? I didn’t think of you as the ‘pet’ type, you know.”
“Yeah,” Justin grins, “And then I made him fall on his arse. Unfortunately, I made a bit of a misjudgement. Do you want to see where he landed on me? I have a fucking bruise!” and he lifts his robe to show the three of them.
Ron shoots them the finger. He doesn’t blame him. Poor Ron. They run after him amusedly, kicking the newly laid ginger path as they go.
He observes, disgusted yet intrigued, as her wand draws a substance, black and gloopy, out of Malfoy’s mouth. It seems to never cease, and Harry pales, imagining how it would feel to have that inside him. Sticky, like tar, and teeming with a dark aura that even him in all his blindness could spot from a mile away. Eventually, the last is trickling out, clutching the edge of Malfoy’s lips like he is the antidote. Mcgonagall swishes her wand and the goop gathers into a ball. She swiftly transfigures a nearby stone into a glass vial to contain it.
“I know this is a bit of a stupid one but I’ve been meaning to get round to practising making a Asmandrius Potion. Want to help?” says Justin, “And then we can do something for you if you would like.”
“Justin. He sucks, and please ignore anything he says.”
“Oh yes, but I’m sure they won’t mind me shooting my shot whilst we’re here,” says Erin, “Anyways, I’m at home right now. Here’s my flatmates. Say hi, guys!” A clash of greetings boom from the speaker, a dozen voices all at once, and the volume makes Harry cringe. They sound friendly, and Harry wonders what it would be like to live normally like that: renting a flat with your mates, having a day job, doing the dishes together in the evening. Mundane things, but a merry life.
“No, Potter. Not quite,” he says. He nibbles his lip again, leaving an indent where it has been continuously repeated. Harry never noticed that was a habit until now. If Malfoy bites even one more time, he could make it bleed.
you, Malfoy,” says Harry, narrowing his eyes and sitting down on the end of the bed. He meant it as a sort of display of power, to show his firmness and stability, but the close proximity between them instead makes him shrink back, unsettled. His stomach is both sinking and inflating with some kind of unnamed emotion. “I was just- uh- checking whether you had decided to die in your sleep. I didn’t save your life again for you to just get off that easy.”
Ron seems to decide that this reasoning is solid enough and downs half of his drink in one gulp. He shivers and scrunches his face at the taste. “Anything to forget the pain of losing Quidditch. Going bald is worth it.”
Justin just smirks a fraction, his thin lips curling at the corners and his eyes twinkling in amusement- but it isn't malicious, so Harry lets it go. “Look at us, eh, Harry? Can't handle a bit of sleep.”
“Projects, yes. Because I know that you’re a good little pet Gryffindor who likes to save the day and take mercy on us bad guys. And I don’t want to owe you for anything more than I already do. It’s a burden I don’t care to carry.”
Justin turns to face him then, plump lips smiling sadly. His features are no longer screwed up in enraged pain, but with anguish. It’s different, but it is a mighty pain nonetheless. There is something sparkling in his brown eyes, but this time it isn’t pity. “You think so?”
Still, his hands are clammy and his heart is hammering, and he doesn’t understand the strength of his reaction. Harry supposes that Malfoy is just another reminder of what he is trying so hard to forget. Despite this, he’s a little too perturbed at Malfoy’s figure, now hunched over in perhaps an attempt to make himself invisible. He would have expected the twat to make a conscious effort to rebuild his image. Prior to the trials, he envisaged, whenever the thought popped into his head, a boot-licking Malfoy throwing money around in order to try and erase the reputation that surrounded them like a black cloud. Instead, Lucius Malfoy got sentenced to life in prison, rightfully so. Narcissa Malfoy had broken down into all-consuming tears at the news, and Harry had had to make a hasty exit, feeling agonised by the sight of her body crumpled on the floor, for some reason. Malfoy Junior, however, had simply remained in his seat, stony and cold, whilst his father had been condemned. He had been pardoned, but there was no sense of pleasure in his face. Staring straight ahead at seemingly nothing in particular, he looked as if he wasn’t present in the room. Lifeless, even. His grey eyes, usually quick and cutting, were sunken and like an empty chasm. The hair, which had become so widely recognised during the press release of the trials, had dirtied itself into matted clumps that drooped onto his face, obscuring his sharp features.
He reads it again and again, and savours every word.
“Projects?” He asks, dumbfounded, “Wait- owe me?”
The gaps -the things that are missing- are more noticeable to Harry. They stand out in stark contrast to what he remembers from Diagon Alley during the war. On the wall of an alleyway leading away from the main street, he sees remnants of the Wanted posters that had firstly been up for the Death Eaters, and then for him. Gringotts, now standing tall and proud once more, crumbles before him again in his mind’s eye, as it had done on that fateful day of the Battle. He can almost hear the alarms blaring and the goblins crying out to each other as the Dragon shattered the building into ruin- at least, that is what he had assumed. At the time, it had felt like he would never get past the terror, the running, the fight. He had presumed that the destruction left behind would be the same.
Scrap that- the question hangs for
Malfoy is dead. Harry’s freaking out.
It’s a light and lofty corridor, and up ahead, there is a small archway which he assumes leads to their new rooms. Next to it, a sheet of paper floating with a suspended torch will dictate, he presumes, the rooming arrangements for their dorms. Whatever the outcome, he crosses his fingers in the hope that he and Ron will at least be bunked together. He digs his nails into his palms so deeply that it draws scant beads of blood. The intensity of anticipation treads on his chest, flattening the sense of calm he has managed to maintain for the majority of the evening. Fortuitously, as of yet he has coped with any invading flashbacks and memories quite well, but he is dreading the thought of going through the ordeal without his best friend, his rock, beside him. He gets the impression that he might permanently drift away into insanity if Ron isn’t there to ground him with his solid presence.
He spies a few of the looks he is getting from fellow classmates and acknowledges Hermione’s previous point- he has to keep moving. It would not do to have others suspect something is wrong, and it also might cause his muscles to freeze up. To distract himself, he grasps her in a quick hug and breathes in her scent, which flushes away the remnants of the bloody smelling man who had stalked past him. Inches from his body. A shiver rolls down his spine and he breathes in once more the earl-grey of her perfume.
It replays like a broken record, and not even one that Harry would have chosen- not one of the ones that he would have snuck onto the vinyl player on the rare occasions that the Dursley’s would take family days out, and Mrs Figg couldn’t take him. He had adored those- danced till the very roots of his bones were aching, in fact, no matter how much the recordings crackled.
And yet there is something about it that makes him decide assuredly that it matters.
“I think he’s harmless at the moment. He seems very subdued. It’s curious.” adds Hermione thoughtfully and they all chance a fleeting glance in Malfoy’s direction.
He treks across their dorm to the bathroom. The light inside flickers and again, he is thrown back to his conversation with Malfoy, whose pale face was illuminated by the blinking lamps of the library. Just as vivid as it were at the time, Harry finds the reminder of his humiliation and failure too much.
“Stop,” says Malfoy with finality. His jaw is set like stone and Harry doesn’t know how to reverse this major fuck up of his.
Paralysed in his spot, it takes him a few fatigued seconds of recognition, but when it comes to him, he thinks that maybe it isn’t so surprising after all.
“Course. What do you wanna do?” asks Harry.
Harry is not quite sure how to react to the information. In many ways, he is prepared to leave behind the confinements and restrictive boundaries of a house. He has long felt that the segregation of students into only interacting with like-minded people enforces a culture which promotes cliquey attitudes. It is unsurprising that students don’t understand each other- they are forced apart. However, Gryffindor has also long been a key part of his identity. Ever since he was just a scrawny eleven year old wearing a Sorting Hat which threatened to fall down his face it was so large, his house has represented an immense portion of who he is. Without that, he feels even more lost in this castle of broken pieces, readily growing more foreign to him. He is, not to mention, disturbed at becoming one with the Slytherins- with Malfoy. Ugh. He makes a noise of distaste.
A thousand different scenarios, each as horrific as the last, are streaming through his mind, slicing through the fog and leaving his head split into two cracked halves. In one image, Malfoy is sobbing, lifting his arm to a flame whilst he bites on his jumper to stop himself from crying out in agony. In another, he has somebody else hold him down whilst his body thrashes back and forth. The gravy on his robes suddenly looks more like blood. “It actually makes me feel a bit sick,” he says, seeing colorful spots in his vision.
It is a testament to the intensity of his dreamlike state that he has been thinking as long as Malfoy has been in there. The twat’s routine is longer than anybody he knows, even Luna, who likes to spend a solid half an hour twisting her hair into complicated styles, as he has heard. He wonders how that compares to Ginny’s quick and clean morning showers, followed only by a brief scrape of the ponytail and scour of the designated clothing chair. Their dynamic must be interesting. She has never been one to fuss about, and maybe she and Harry are too similar in that way. It has occurred to him before that maybe he needs someone to make him care about the acute fine things in life. Growing up with nothing in the Dursley’s household, and then battling just for pure survival, Harry has never had the time, nor cared to. It just didn’t seem important.
“I might have to pull you up on that. Everything I’m doing for this entry is starting to make me age faster than Filch. Did you know he’s only forty-three?’ says Neville. They put away their trays and start to head out of the door.
Mcgonagall sighs into her tea; the Phoenixes scatter in opposite directions as her breath hits the surface. She huffs with amusement and strokes one with her fingertip, coaxing it out from the underside. As it moves, Harry spots an inscription in a loopy, flamboyant font which had escaped his notice until now.
“Hey.” He says, like a clown, in a moment of panic. May as well be civil. It is better than the alternative, and maybe Mcgonagall will be pleased enough to let him switch dorms.
Having had enough of the self-deprecation, Harry places his hand on the taller boy’s arm and squeezes firmly, hoping it will make him listen. “I..uh..understand. It sucks for them, but it sucks for
Justin sighs, clearly relieved at Harry’s acceptance, and he feels guilty at his initial reaction. It is the cherry on top of the cake that the rock in his stomach plummets a little harder at Justin’s admittedly attractive smile.
. He refuses to remember the instances in which a flash of broad pecs, or an angular jawline, would creep into his fantasies as well.
“As I see it,” says Ron with a mouth full of lemon chicken, “It doesn’t really matter. As long as I’m still in the same house with you lousy lot, I don’t really care who else shares it.” and with those wise words he tucks into a plate of macaroni cheese which appear miraculously before him.
“God, Justin,” mutters Harry, for a lack of better things to say.
After Justin leaves, Harry keeps his eyes firmly shut in case the other boy is still lurking around. He doesn’t want to talk about what Justin just told him. If he does, he imagines that he would probably have to reveal that the knowledge that Malfoy is demanding to switch dorms indeed disturbs him. Consequently, Justin would require an explanation. Harry doesn’t have one, other than it pisses him off that Malfoy doesn’t want him around at all, not even to antagonise- and that is a rather shit and illogical excuse considering they are well known rivals.
Just once, but it is enough for Harry. Enough to kick his brain back into rusty action. He waves his wand and shouts, “Expecto Patronum!” His stag takes off into the woods, a trail of silver, hopefully on it’s way to bring help.
“Maybe he likes it, gives him more attention,” offers Harry halfheartedly, not really believing his own words as he reflects on Malfoy’s despondent, bizarre attitude.
He looks odd in his pyjamas. Harry has almost been expecting him to wear his robes to bed, with the stuffy manner he has been exuding all day. As anticipated, the nightshirt and trousers are silken and matching, very unlike Harry’s own handmade, lumpy jumper and tartan pyjama bottoms. What an idiot. Both of them. His prominent collarbones are distinct in the blue light of the moon, as are his cheekbones. It’s eerie, Harry thinks, how similar he looks to the Malfoy of the war, sickly and skinny, yet simultaneously so different, with his childlike bedclothes and bony feet sticking out of the duvet.
“What?” he whispers, “I’m trying to sleep.”
Searching along the banks of the Black Lake, he spots a sturdy oak tree and braces himself for the run towards it. His boots get muddy and he trips a little, but the speed of the wind catching his robes is an experience near enough to flying that it makes him grin. Probably looking like Hogwarts resident madman, Harry stretches his arms out in the fashion of an eagle, the same way he sat on Buckbeak all those years ago.
ostentatious home, that the family spend their spare time sitting around on plump cushions, dressed head to toe in their pyjamas, swapping fairy tales. The mounted elf heads had really helped him envisage the image. He cheers slightly at the image of Lucius Malfoy being forced to endure the Tales of Beedle the Bard.
“It’s lovely, isn’t it?” says Justin, noticing Harry’s eyeline, and detaching the ring from his hair “Elliot got it for me for my birthday earlier this year. Called it a promise ring, said that we would replace it with ‘the real thing’ in a couple of years.”
Harry takes his time preparing for bed. He shuffles around in the bathroom after shrugging on his newest jumper from Molly. The wool is somewhat itchy but he likes the way it warms his skin. Even agitation and the rash he feels forming are preferable to the detached state that had plagued him earlier that day, causing his body to lock and freeze. It reminds him of the lonesome months in Grimmauld place which he is trying so desperately hard to move on from, where he was incapable of understanding the needs of his mind and body. Letting himself decay.
Then again, his new wand appeared to be functioning well on that night in the common room, when Malfoy seemed to be setting practically the whole castle alight with silver light beams. He thinks he’ll keep it, for a bit longer, if Malfoy doesn’t need it.
He thinks of the note, reading ‘
One would think that with the deathly silence coming from the bed, Malfoy would perhaps just have gotten up already. Then when noticing his curtains glued tight together, with no chance of being pried open, one might presume that he is probably still sleeping. Harry, however, knows that he is neither of these things,
Harry begins to think that Mcgonagall’s proposal of inter-house unity might be a load of shit. You cannot raise sheep on sole interaction with each other, and then lock them in a cage with the bulls. It is blind optimism to think they will remain unscathed at the other end. Perhaps had they been reared together, it would be different.
Except, it is- since most nights he can’t sleep thanks to Malfoy’s quiet, yet ear-splitting, huffs- so strangely vulnerable, so human.
Or perhaps he just doesn’t want to allow anybody to have the opportunity to speak to him. Both are equally likely. His vanity, or his reluctance to let anyone say two words to him? Harry can see how it could be both. Somehow he must use the bed as some sort of dressing room because he always emerges before running to the bathroom in full attire. The image of Malfoy struggling to shove his trousers on and toppling about in the cramped space amuses Harry endlessly.
has blotched the nib of a quill, and a splodge of ink prevents him from being able to decipher the last name. Harry rubs at it and the black begins to fade under the heat of his thumb.
Upon hearing this, Harry feels a little taken aback and in him, arises an unwanted need to squirm away that he doesn’t quite understand. Not from Justin, however. But from- well...to be honest, he isn’t quite sure…the memories it lays bare?
Really, he has no fucking clue. He sighs, pining after a world where he doesn’t care about Malfoys and their suspicious behaviours, but knowing such a thing is impossible.
“Does he know that you’re a wizard?” Harry asks.
“You do have great cheekbones,” says Hermione teasingly.
As Mcgonagall pours herself another tea and helps herself to a buttery shortbread, Harry racks his brain for something he could offer up which would give her some bloody faith in him. Unfortunately, during school he didn’t have many opportunities to develop any hobbies and interests, unlike most of his peers-  another thing he can blame Voldemort for. Who knows? Had he been given the time and space, perhaps he could have become a dragon-trainer like Charlie, mysterious and rogue, or an astute curse-breaker like Bill. Merlin, he could have even gone wild and passionately launched himself into the field of toad-breeding. Hagrid would have been overjoyed, but he will never know.
“There’s nobody like that. I thought we covered this, Erin. I was in London just for the summer, and I am genuinely just asking how you are!” he says, leaving out details about Grimmauld Place. It is probably best that she misunderstands him and the situation, in thinking that he was only there on holiday.
As they are arriving, they meet him in the hallway. His dark gaze is intimidating, his panther smile even more so. He says nothing, just observes the two of them for a moment and lingers on a hostile Malfoy, who bristles under the scrutiny, before taking off speedily down the corridor. What is it with Slytherins and fast walking?
Arriving at the door, he pulls back. Inside the room, he can hear some clinking of the bottles. He stays like that for a moment, in case some further indication comes to light by sound alone- but nothing happens. Because of this, and because he thinks if he doesn’t go to bed soon, his body might fail on him, he peers round the corner, chancing being seen.
“Fine,” he sighs, unreluctant to let this path of conversation carry on any further. He lets it die, feeling it float away, though it will probably drift back later. “Anyway if you’re not going to tell Mcgonagall what really happened, you might want to at least assure her this wasn’t some kind of suicidal mission. I think she might start taping up the windows soon, just to make sure you don’t jump out.”
, rather than
Eventually, after Harry had left and come back, Malfoy glanced, just once, and very, very fleetingly, in his direction. Their eye contact was short but it had made him lose his appetite for three days. Ginny hadn’t understood at all. And to be honest, neither had he.
The contrast between the Malfoy in his mind’s eye, and the one he sees in real life is jarring. It’s almost nauseating when Harry catches glimpses of his ungrudgingly blank face in class, or the dorm, or the common room- he is fucking
Since then, things have been peculiar, to say the least. Because, for once in Harry’s entire existence, there seems to be a genuine sort of civility between them- not the fake kind, not the unspoken words and cold shoulders of the first few weeks. No, this time it feels real, of substance.
At the entrance, there is a tall basket of books, right by the door, with a note attached. It reads: ‘half-price’. He heads towards them, judging that cheap is probably better anyway, but Hermione grabs his arm gently. “Harry, shall we go down there?” she points to the shelves by the man with the now humongous book, eyes bright with her intellect.
Malfoy blinks twice. “Right.”
“Yeah, yeah, stop moaning. I’m doing it” says Justin as he slams open his drawer. He reaches in and pulls out something rectangular.
It all changed in sixth year. Harry no longer had any grip on Malfoy. Even when he did, his firmness of mind was skewed astray by the opinions of others, like Ron and Hermione, yes, but also Remus and Mcgonagall. It is like that now, except his own mind and Malfoy’s bizarre fluctuating behaviour are now suddenly the saboteurs to him understanding the other boy. Still, his instincts do tell him that Malfoy isn’t set out to end the world singlehandedly in a fit of revenge for Voldemort and the ruined reputation of his family. Unfortunately for Malfoy, his instincts also tell him that it is essential he reads that parchment, and so that is what he shall do.
“Are you quite sure? You have always had an aptitude for the sport, though I’m sure you don’t need me to tell you this. Madam Hooch will be gravely disappointed, I think she has been holding out hope that you could be her next big star,” she says and Harry thinks,
“Thanks!” She looks up at him happily and he catches her green-eyed gaze.
Harry admits to not really knowing Anthony Goldstein and he and Justin converse easily and agreeably, snug in their billowing dens of linen. He had not expected it, remembering the snobby, upper-class boy of their youth. Now, it’s pleasant. It lights a glimmer of hope for the year he had thought would be filled with secluded nights, surrounded by people he doesn’t know, and doesn’t care to. Maybe he has found a companion here. He and Justin have spoken before, but only briefly, save that whole Parseltongue fiasco from second year. Harry notes absently that Justin is quite attractive when he smiles, all auburn curls and pearly teeth.
harry confronts draco.... but messily... because he is chaotic
Goldstein flits in and out the dorm, cordial enough but not appearing to care for chatter. Sometimes Harry forgets that he even shares the room with him, as awful as that may seem, but the boy-
He has heard the tales of bloody victims, violent criminals and deafening screams which leave you with a ringing in your ears for weeks afterwards.
Once he’s home, he nods his greetings to Kreacher and goes to the bathroom to rid his hands of the mud he has accumulated. In the mirror afterwards, he watches as a little daisy petal cascades down his face and into his sink. It’s fair to say he looks ridiculous with the crown around his head, but the memory makes him smile. All he can think as he winds down for the evening is that he wishes he could spend every day in the cooling shadow of an oak tree, with beautiful girls who laugh too much, instead of being shipped off to schools which double as battlegrounds.
As soon as lessons are over, Harry trudges back to the common room in as quick a hurry as his body permits. His whole being hurts, from the sole of his numb feet, to the top of his finger-scrunched hair. The lessons were gruelling, painful, and too many times he had zoned out in disassociation, only to freak out as someone's clothes brushed against him, or as a sudden noise shook him. Ron has headed out to play a game of Quidditch and Harry has never run to escape an invitation so speedily in his life. The engulfing fire which had eaten the posts and stalls like a raving beast flash in and out of his mind whenever he sees the pitch from a window. Up close, it would be even worse, he knows.
As he creeps out of the room, on the lookout from any stray School Nurses, he decides to take a moment to rest against the wall. She hugs him from behind.
Shit times two. Harry has also apparently forgotten a second thing- this being Erin’s freakish and unprecedented comments about his love life. He thinks back to when they were squatted together underneath that tree, the leaves tumbling into their laps in smooth flurries, as she questioned him about his soulmate. Then, he had considered that she perhaps had Seer blood in her; his mind had been whirling with a tornado, blustering images of Ginny and their relationship gone wrong. Suddenly, he realises that he hasn’t really thought about her in the last few days.
, to quote their latest report.
attacking me, are we, Potter?” Malfoy sneers automatically, straightening out his robes, which Harry must have mussed up. There is a strand of hair sticking up at the back of his head. “Should I contact your good friends the Aurors now, or later?”
And watch, he does.
“And what’s that?”
if he’s going to let it slip from his grasp before he is ready for it to. It is inevitable that the feeling will eventually fade, he knows, but Harry just prays and crosses his fingers that he can revel in it for long enough before it does.
, Malfoy sweeps out of the door, snapping up his paper and marching away. The abruptness of it all has Harry feeling like he has whiplash. Good luck meeting Seamus and Dean, he almost calls after him.
“Not particularly, Professor,” says Harry, hoping she won’t ask more. Of course, this time she does.
to the forefront of his mind. They look up and face him in shock, and Harry is mortified to see that the lack of coverage over Seamus’ genitals only becomes more obvious when Dean moves his head. He stammers an incomprehensible apology, wasting no time before running away at the sound of their embarrassed laughter.
“In bed, thinking of you, darling,” she says flirtatiously, and despite the fact that it is an obvious overkill- a joke if he has ever seen one- Justin whoops in celebration and Anthony cackles, a casual, loosened side to him unseen up until now. Harry whips round, miming putting his finger to his lips in an attempt to get them to shut up. Clearly now too familiar with Harry- maybe he should’ve kept him at arms-length after all- Justin mouths something along the lines of, “Knew you two were fucking.”
Must be.
“OK, OK, damn, give a man a second,” Justin responds, “Basically, my parents have disowned me because they found out that I’m, uh, gay.”
She just raises an eyebrow in an all-knowing manner, turns to Luna, taking her hand... and then that’s that. Harry frowns, slurps his now-frosty soup and turns to no-one.
Harry gasps, chokes on air and falls to the ground next to him. No longer does he care about where they are. Nothing has ever mattered less.
“Hey, guys,” he says flatly, wishing he had more to contribute to the group other than his sombre demeanour. He hopes that if he is fated to woe, he is at least giving off a brooding and mysterious aura-
Harry realises he should probably move, and just about manages to force his joints into action to dive around the corner before Malfoy is tip-toeing out of the room. If he were a teacher, he would think that Malfoy certainly looks suspicious- flustered, a bag which is bulging to the brim and clinks with every step, and smelling like the chemicals of the potions lab- so it makes sense that Malfoy seems a bit nervous. His eyes dart back and forth throughout the corridor, somehow missing Harry’s slim body.
“Malfoy?” he says frantically, praying, hoping. He shakes the boy, noticing with alarm how cold he is. His chest is silent and still, and Harry realises he is crying again.  “Can you hear me?”
“Can I help you?” he demands, maybe a bit aggressively, but he feels paranoid. And it’s rude of her to ruin his extremely uncommon bout of peace like this.
“As if,” snorts Ron, “We’ve been playing this for years, mate, and you’re still yet to win in a game. I think that’s a sign of shitness. In fact, ‘m pretty sure the only person you’ve beat is Neville- and he’s not the biggest competition out there.”
Harry snorts, though without much humour. “Dunno. Feel free to keep trying. Why do you want me to go so badly?” he challenges, unrelenting.
Cringing, he folds it up. It’s not perfect by any standard but it will have to do.
It reads,
It has now been a few days since the incident in the common room. Harry cannot stop thinking about it for the life of him.The more he remembers about it, the more confused he becomes. What was Malfoy practising? Why was he so happy when he managed it? Why was he doing it in the middle of the night? Logically, if it had been something for class or study, he wouldn’t have waited till the shades of the night to do it. Also, logically, he wouldn’t have looked so fucking pleased. Nobody can look that delighted doing homework. Unless you’re Hermione, and even in her case, Harry thinks that it’s not so much for amusement, but rather an intense determination.
sooo.... how we feeling? honestly these chapters could be total shit and i wouldn't know because after a while i have no clue what i'm writing anymore. i hope not tho. basically things are really gonna kick off in the next chapter and im excited about it because i have so much plot planned which has been set out since like chapter three and setting it up has taken so longggggg. but i love slow burns with more detail so hopefully you guys do too (im sure you do, otherwise you probably would have quit this story by now)!!! also im sorry about the justin/harry moment.... i know you guys are here for drarry. but i wanted harry to have a bit of a gay realisation before anything happened because its realistic and gritty and the truth is that one day you just realise hey i think my friend is hot oh shit im bisexual....that is what is happening in a nutshell ahahahahaha!! because this story is so harry centric i didn't want his sexuality issues and internalised homophobia to JUST be all about draco- he has his own lil mind too <3
“I should find it surprising that you’re here. Funnily enough, I don’t,” Malfoy’s voice drones from across the room. He certainly doesn’t sound as aggravated as Harry had assumed he would be. Despite the ants crawling over Harry, an itch of shame and humiliation, there is another layer of emotion which flashes over him upon hearing him speak. Relief.
“And did you?”
“At least it didn’t land on anyone,” comments Harry, weak and drained. The iron is digging into his chest and his lungs feel constricted.
One of the changes this year is that all students are required to take a Muggle Studies class, regardless of their OWL and NEWT choices- including Eight Year. Especially, even, as Harry had gathered from the way Mcgonagall had sent a brisk look at the Slytherins in his year upon announcing it. It seems that even Mcgonagall, with all her talk of house unity and forgiveness, can’t shake some prejudice. That is what the war did. It took everything you believed in, everything you thought you stood for, and turned it all on its head, until you’re not sure what the point is, other than plain survival, other than avoiding joining the pile of dead. Other than protecting the people around you.
He is jerked back into reality as Malfoy leaves the room. As quiet as he is, he is easily identifiable from the clacking of his boots, probably Dragonhide, and probably preposterously expensive, the twat. Goldstein must follow, because somebody else’s footsteps echo after him.
and Mcgonagall appears, a few metres from them both.
“So, Mr. Potter, I gather it is still your intention to enter Auror training after this academic year?” She asks with a sip of her tea. Her emerald green robes fall with authority as she lifts her arm, china cup in hand.
Mcgonagall chuckles, condescending in the way that older people inevitably are when someone young dares to feign maturity. Harry isn’t offended. He feels the same when, for example, he sees a third year boy trying to impress a girl with whatever prepubescent muscle he can find. It’s second hand embarrassment, mixed with a tinge of superiority- not that anybody would admit that out loud.
Harry joins him, and together they form a sizeable dip in the cushion where their combined weight is squashing it. Eyeing up the seating arrangement with her watchful gaze, Hermione seems to deem it suitable and jumps in next to Harry. The three of them are very cosily jam-packed, but Harry hasn’t felt this comforted in a while. First, Hagrid’s all-encompassing, choking hugs, and now, Ron and Hermione on either side. It is his lucky evening, apparently.
Harry picks it up cautiously, checking subtly for any dodgy markings. However, he is clearly not as conspicuous as he thought because Jenna snorts humorously. “Don’t worry, this one is clean. If you want, I can show you some other round th-”
. He’d rather take Zabini, with his smug arrogance and his twelve dozen mirrors, one hundred times over, than share his sleeping space with Malfoy. The boy might have been pardoned but his role in the death and destruction constantly rings in Harry's mind, no matter how much of a liking Witch Weekly takes to his
“Not in the slightest, mate.”
“Kind of. I get nightmares sometimes, but it became too hard to explain why I was screaming to Elliot back when he didn’t know that I was a wizard, so I considered taking Dreamless Sleep. But it would need to be every night,” says Justin, a hint of sadness in his voice. This is the most fragile and honest Harry has ever seen him, and he is unexpectedly finding it comforting rather than overwhelming. Maybe there is some truth in it being beneficial to air your feelings after all.
When he ultimately doesn’t show up for breakfast, Ron comes to the dorm to get him, with a levitated plate of food trailing behind him. It smells delectable, a true Hogwarts breakfast, but the scent makes Harry feel queasy.
“Hey!” he pretends to be offended and shoves playfully at Justin’s side, “Speak for yourself. I’m a strong guy.”
They turn a corner together, and soon ascend a staircase. He considers that Malfoy could be leading him to his own murder, could open the door to a room with Harry’s coffin already nailed in place. What would Ron think about him following after Malfoy like this? Harry shakes the shame and pursues the more pressing issue.
bloody sane.
Frankly, Harry feels immensely uncomfortable. How does one react to seeing their former enemy, whom you and your friends on many occasions were almost murdered by, who bullied you for years, was on the opposing side of the war, yet, at the same time, was someone you couldn’t bear to see dead? It’s a complex and loaded question. Let alone one to tackle in such an intimate situation, as they are currently. Harry never wished to know what kind of pyjamas Malfoy prefers to sleep in. Maybe Ron can obliviate him in the morning.
Before he can process it, Malfoy drags his curtains around his bed and disappears from sight. A clear sign. Well.
“Shut up, Malfoy.” Harry can’t help but say, through gritted teeth. He feels weirdly embarrassed, like he has been caught doing something he shouldn’t be.
The singular thing in his mind now, other than bed, is Malfoy. Surprise surprise. He wants to know all the the comments left unsaid, all the emotions being hidden, so badly it alarms him a little.
“Malfoy, why don’t you talk to me?” he says and immediately wants to cry and cower in a corner somewhere at how pathetic he sounds. Harry opens his mouth, just about to lead on from this absolute humiliation with an over-explanation about how he doesn’t even
Justin directs his lean body towards Harry and takes a deep breath. It seems to be too much too soon though, and he almost chokes. His hands are balled up in fists and they claw at his black cotton trousers nervously. On his part, Harry feels like he is frozen in place by the force of Justin’s emotions. He is bound by the magnitude of the other boy's dejection to stay put, stiffly perched on his unclean bed sheets.
So now his fatigue levels are rapidly increasing, but knowing that it probably comes from the fact that he has been constructive- and social- is a satisfying thought. There is little worse than being tired with everything for no reason other than life being exhausting.
In a desperate and admittedly deplorable last shot, he throws himself in front of Malfoy, stopping him in his tracks. Malfoy halts and merely looks a bit peeved at Harry’s presence. Harry on the other hand, feels wildly unstable, like he could say anything.
“Good evening, all.” She begins, inspiring total quiet from the sea of students.
Malfoy sniffed, irritated. “I was there to feed the Thestrals.”
Also, and more importantly, he thinks that if he spends more than ten seconds asking himself why he truly cares, he might implode with anxiety and unwanted self-realisations. Right now, he doesn’t want to ponder any longer on the reasonings behind his behaviour. He just wants to get through the day and if that measly piece of parchment happens to float his way, who is he hurting by giving it a read?
“Erin, I’m sorry but you’re mistaken,” he grumbles, “And possibly clinically insane. Go check yourself in right now.” At that, she barks a laugh which sounds like a peal of bells, and he cannot help but break his glower and join in. It’s contagious. He wonders what Ron and Hermione would think of him now and he decides that they’d be both proud and incredibly disturbed.
harry has a some tense encounters with draco and visits a friend.
“C’mon, just admit defeat already.”
“Not your hair, love! The crowds, I swear.” proclaims Ron, his voice cracking mid-sentence.
It’s a modestly sized common room, much less grand than the glorious reds and sweeping tapestries of the Gryffindor counterpart, no matter how cosy it is. Harry presumes that this is due to the fact that, despite it now being law for all Hogwarts students to attend until the age of eighteen, many eighth years are absent, clearly not turning up. Unless they have decided to have a crack at beating Harry and Ron’s withstanding record for ‘latest pupils to the first night of school’.
, she says. It's a fair point but Harry chooses not to listen.
Unfortunately, the Fates seem to be working against him today and he seems to struggle to get one of the boots on. His skinny fingers yank at the back of the shoe, but to no avail. The red of his face spreads to his ears, and even they are pointed, like an elf, Harry thinks distractedly- what is in the Malfoy genes? His white shock of hair, worn longer than he used to, Harry notes, keeps falling in his face; as the minutes progress Malfoy pushes it back with ever increasing agitation.
He had left, albeit reluctantly, and found the walk back to the castle to be one of the most challenging tasks he had ever encountered. Numerous times he almost caved in to the sweet promises of the floor, calling him down. At Hagrid’s, the itch to knock at the door and seek a cup of tea was almost unbearable. But, when he caught a glimpse of Hagrid’s hairy head through the window, smiling broadly as Fang licked his face, he couldn’t imagine anything worse than inflicting his gloom on such a happy moment.
During their adolescence, Malfoy had always been sort of predictable in that schoolboy bully manner of his. Before each fight, Harry could pretty much preempt how it would play out if he were lucky enough to not be blinded by the rage that Malfoy invoked in him.
“As a matter of fact,” Malfoy starts to say, and Harry can’t believe there is more coming, “I would like to modify my previous statement. Any poison. I am not fussy at this stage.” He finishes the sentence with an offensive glower, as if to impress how frustrated he is with Harry for simply not being dull enough to ignore.
“I’m a witch, remember?” says Erin with a muffled laugh. He hears some dishes clink, and a voice in the background.
Without thinking about it, Harry locks the paper in the trunk at the foot of his bed with double enchantments, and gets into bed. He wandlessly casts quick cleaning charms over his body, and climbs into bed, not caring for menial tasks tonight. Those are for when he is numb, craving routine- not nights fuelled by stupidity and exhaustion. Justin may or may not come in soon and wonder why the fuck Harry is going to bed when it is not even nine yet, but he doesn’t much care.
A little panicked, for reasons he doesn’t care to dwell on, but realising his silence is deafening after Justin’s admission, Harry speaks up. He furiously thinks of Uncle Vernon’s prejudice, and curses himself for entertaining the hateful comments that had tainted his mind like a paralysing disease as a child. “That’s horrible, I’m so sorry. Is Elliot your boyfriend then?” and the word
Harry reads it over, and over, and over, until it becomes meaningless. Whole words turn into staggered letters. Letters turn into code. On it goes, reducing all the while, until all he is looking at are lines, lines which swoop continuously across the page. Malfoy’s handwriting apparently only turns more elaborate the more messily he writes. Harry rolls his eyes at that. It is just like the git to be so controversial.
Turning back to Malfoy, he ploughs forward.
“I know!” he says, proud of himself for being able to remember the right spell to use- even if it is a third year charm- considering his mind feels like it has been skinned, chopped and skewed. He points his wand at his face, trying to ignore how menacing that feels. “Scourgify!” he exclaims with confidence.
Harry peers around and tries to remember what everything looked like when he was eight inches shorter, with even more knobbly knees than he has now. Certainly Madame Malkins appeared much more intimidating than the short and greying witch she has become. He thinks of Malfoy, baby faced yet still so angular (how is that possible?), and almost feels nostalgic.
“What?” Harry says indignantly, stumped at the accusation, “Of course not. I-I found him like this.”
“Game later?” Harry asks.
“Hey, guys. You, uh, having fun?” And he flinches at how awkward he sounds. Couldn’t he have just left them alone without saying anything? They seemed to be content enough to ignore his being- would have never known he was here. Stupid Harry.
to feel intrigued.
“Professor, I-I think, well,” he begins, but finds that he has to restart. Swallowing his nerves, his next words fall out as one. “I think he was almost dead.”
He cannot even be surprised that she already knows his name. If Malfoy was telling the truth and the whole Wizarding World is talking about how he has lost his mind, then his reaction just now would have confirmed it for her. An embarrassed blush on his cheeks, he mumbles, “No harm done. Thank you, Miss Lockwood.”
“I’ll buy it,” he says, perhaps a little too excitedly. Silky leather strokes his hand when he grabs it; maybe it is his imagination, but the book seems to shudder upon touching it.
“Well, perhaps if you had been using your eyes, you would have noticed that I was, in fact, not the one lurking at all,” says Malfoy, all hostile and bristled at the small insinuation behind Harry’s words. Harry waits for the jab at his shit eyesight. It never comes; he wishes it would.
One moment they are heaving breaths of laughter together, and the next she is shoving the handmade daisy crown onto his dishevelled and dark hair.
he reprimends himself, though the absurdity and drama of the statement nearly makes him laugh.
“OK,” Harry takes this on board, grinning a little, “But what about the Pensieve?”
He hopes for the sake of his sanity that he can, but with each passing day, his hand inches closer to ripping that curtain open.
Hermione had solemnly told him once that his smiling at the 60 year old waitress in his local greasy spoon had earned him the spot on the front of the paper. His ugly mug spread out in black and white with the headline ‘Saviour needs saving from Cougar?” Since then, he hasn’t returned to the cafe out of pure humiliation for both himself and the older woman- who is, in reality, a loving mother of three, working a minimum wage job to support her family. It was shameful and he had felt nauseous at the influx of mail that had flooded his agent, all offering their aid in ‘getting rid of her’. She still smiles kindly at him every time he walks past, unbeknown to the abuse she still receives from complete strangers. He had her secretly placed under Auror surveillance.
,” Justin splutters on the last word, but continues on, flinching every now and then. “Because he said it made him feel dirty, keeping the secret from everyone he knows. Because he isn’t sure whether he can live with his family looking at him with disgust, no matter how hard they try to hide it.”
hi thanks so much for reading please leave comments and kudos because this takes a long time to write and it gives me more motivation when i know people are enjoying it :) xxx would mean a lot
He blinks away what had fallen into his eye, and luckily it seems willing to go. As he opens them again with caution, he notices that Ron is grinning at him from the floor.
harry texts erin and we get some more harry and draco interaction
He finally breaks through Harry’s bodily barrier, only to spin around with his finger pointed in the air.
Or a house elf, like Dobby, a timid and unwelcome voice in his head whispers sadly.
. Rapidly, things get even worse. Had he known that were possible, he would have run, but he has no chance before he spots something else. Upon the floor, just by the trunk of a particularly huge tree, is the foreboding sight of a wand. He knows it, not well, but it’s
Mcgonagall takes another patient sip and Harry feels embarrassed at his slowness. A cuckoo clock, which must be a new addition for he has never noticed it before, alerts the hour. In the silence of the room, every chime feels like a hammer in the icy fabric that has settled over him. He really wants to throw an object, preferably heavy, at the damn wooden bird, just to get it to stop laughing at him.
“Nostalgia? Really, Potter?” he says disbelievingly, shaking his head the tiniest amount,“You think that’s funny?”
“You’re joining me then?” says Malfoy with an arched eyebrow, distaste written all over him. He ignores the stumble, which simultaneously vexes Harry and leaves him pleasantly surprised. Idly, he wonders if he would ever get so desperate as to pay Malfoy to bully him.
“Yeah! Is this Erin?”
He takes Malfoy’s stiffness as an indication that he was, indeed, being a slimy git in some shape or form, and is trying to get Harry off his back with feeble insults. Well, he won’t stand for that.
To Harry’s confusion, Malfoy hasn’t scampered off to God-knows-where this morning. Instead he has joined Harry, Justin and Anthony, the latter having made a great effort to integrate himself since Monday, in an early morning game of Exploding Snap. Well, he hasn’t so much
He is slumped, clearly exhausted yet, undeniably, awake in his bed. Harry feels a weight lifted from his shoulders at the sight of him alive, and releases a sigh he didn’t know he had been holding in. Dressed in the light blue Hospital gown and only a fraction less pale than he had been yesterday, Malfoy looks minutes from death. Not quite the peace of mind that Harry was searching for. He aches to reach out and check, placing his hand over the boy's frail chest like he had before, that he is in fact still breathing.
. When did it all get so backwards? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? He doesn’t know anymore, but he thinks that maybe Malfoy is supposed to be working a little harder for forgiveness.
Anthony stumbles in a bit later, and his hefty plods are a bit staggered. He could be drunk. Hermione would be appalled, considering that it is a Sunday night, but eighth year apparently does not seem to be bothered by such mundane structures any more. Almost every night, he hears Seamus and Dean go out to Hogsmeade as they stir up great noise in the common room; Merlin knows who else joins them. They tumble back into the room at ungodly hours, usually waking Harry from whatever pitiful excuse for sleep he is in. A lot of clinking of bottles, stifled giggles and a singing Seamus. Probably some snogging in between if it is just the two of them. Harry really is becoming less cool by the day. Premature ageing here we come, he thinks woefully.
FIRST OF ALL: PLEASE read the beginning of the end notes if u have any triggers and for content warning <3 stay safe
For several tedious beats, Harry has to just stand there in anticipation as Malfoy basks in his joy. It must only be a few seconds but it creeps by painfully slowly. He is dressed in a thick winter cloak that looks incredibly warm and expensive, very on brand for a boy so spoiled, and Harry has to stop himself from using
“Professor?” he questions.
They all enter Madame Malkin’s together, shoving each other to get through the door like rowdy third years. You can avoid a new cauldron, and even your new books if you are cheeky enough to just borrow them all year long, but one of the many flaws of adolescence is the perpetual growth that comes with it.
Still, he holds the dream in the back of his mind, wondering whether perhaps Erin could stand to accompany him, if he ever manages to see her again. Under no circumstances would he wish for Hermione and Ron to join him- they would be a nightmare, he knows, with their sickeningly googly eyes and roaming hands. He had never wanted to know less about their sex life than he did when Ron had drunkenly informed him, in excruciating detail, of their first time together. It had been so dreadful that Harry had almost managed to forget every other terrifying thing that had ever happened to him, in light of the horror he felt in the face of Ron’s enthusiastic story. He had told Ron sternly that he never wanted to hear of Hermione’s genitals ever again in his life. Death would be too soon, in his opinion. It was positively mortifying for them both, as Ron had proven in the way his cheeks blazed bright red the next morning.
He wonders why it is so sweltering hot at this time of the evening, until he realises that Malfoy is brewing a potion. The cauldron is small, and so black it is almost invisible in the shadowy room, but definitely there.
“What?” Harry interrupts, alive, “Hurt me? Punch me? No you won’t. You don’t do anything anymore, apart from mope around.”
