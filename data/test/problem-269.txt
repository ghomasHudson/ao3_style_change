Harry watched as a clearly still fuming Malfoy deposited the coins on the till before swiping his bags and securing them within his robes. He turned to glare at the other customers, one of them shrugged nonchalantly at him, “war criminal,” she stated, smirking as Malfoy turned a deeper shade of red.
It had been nearly a fortnight now that the investigation had been ongoing. Two weeks without Lilac Close, home cooking, wine evenings with Magalie, or Lisette calmly reassuring Malfoy that his hair was looking thicker already after he applied his homebrewed potions. For one mad moment Harry wondered if he could go visit the other man, maybe take him one of the marbles, before he realised that that was completely against regulations. Harry was actively investigating a ‘suspect’ and Malfoy probably didn’t even have a clue about who the nameless auror digging through his memories was.
“You’re so needy,” Draco sighed sufferingly, but he nudged into Harry’s side with an affectionate smile. “If that’s the rule then I expect the same courtesy from you. I don’t want to see any case files containing grisly murders whilst we’re there – and no firecalling Ronald to discuss them either!”
“Also, Potter, Weasley, I’d like to see you in my office.”
“Cake, swimwear and foreign languages, it’s a wonder Witch Weekly haven’t cracked the code sooner,” Draco huffed, “they’re always running articles on how to win a man’s heart.”
Harry grimaced, maybe he did need to take a vacation after all.
it to cast a spell in here and yet right now, he had all the magical prowess of Filch.
Draco paused to side eye Harry. “Okay, well I wish you the best of luck in that endeavour. I’ve heard Fortescue’s have brought in some new flavours recently.”
“Pensieve Probes can be very draining,” Hermione cleared her throat as she settled her wine on a nearby coffee table. Harry stared at one of Hugo discarded toys on the floor, it was a charmed Romanian Longhorn plush that flapped its wings every so often. He remembered Charlie had brought it as a Christening present years ago.
“I’m alright thanks,” Harry shook his head before taking a deep breath and submerging his face in cool, jelly like water. Going into someone else’s memories was never a pleasant experience but it didn’t seem to have the same nauseating effect on Harry that it did on some of the other aurors like Ron. Harry half wondered if it was due to having grown up with Uncle Vernon’s driving, the car lurching side to side along with the road rage induced jerks of his head.
Harry trotted after Malfoy until they were in the lift. For some inexplicable reason each of the Ministry lifts had completely different décor. One of them was dented aluminum walls like the kind you’d find in a multi storey car park, another was all plush red carpet and marble sides like a Park Avenue hotel. This one sported a rather faded floral carpet and lemon linoleum walls. It reminded Harry of the elevator in the Milanese apartment block he had done stake out with Ron in.
“I’d never do anything you didn’t want,” Harry reassured him, leaning in to kiss Draco again.
to say that, it was literally in her charms when he stopped short and remembered Odette wasn’t Magalie, or Lisette, or Philippe. Odette was real, and if she had decided Draco wasn’t worth three knuts then there would have been nothing he could do about it, no resetting spells or legilimency to get her to say exactly what he needed to hear.
“Yes,” Draco sighed happily, “took you long enough to notice.”
“Yeah, but let me tell you how we broke it,” Bill grinned, leaning forwards and diving into an exciting account of the investigation. Draco was on the edge of his seat for most of it, desperately jealous that he hadn’t been there to see it all happen. For some reason, Harry was still grinning like an inane idiot in the background but Draco tried to pay him no heed.
“Yes, well” Pewterfoot looked uncomfortable for a moment, “Draco Malfoy claims he is innocent.”
Harry rolled his eyes as Malfoy walked into yet
“Milk?” Draco asked, “I’m afraid I’ve only got almond.”
“Oh goodness no,” Hermione shook her head, “truly Harry, it’s only me and Ron that have noticed as we spend so much time with you. We just thought you’d maybe been feeling a little lonely recently.”
“Chocolate hobnob?” Andromeda asked as she shuffled back into the parlour with an overburdened tea tray.
“Yes, well,” the other man sniffed, “I think we’ve established that is the typical Gryffindor way by now.”
“Neither, thank you,” Draco waved her away, “wait! Bugger it, the rocky road.”
“Perhaps,” Magalie bit her lip in a smile, “or perhaps it won’t be as bad as you think and you may even impress this Harry Potter with your wealth of wizarding knowledge on the pub quiz.”
“Does he?” Luna laughed delightedly, shoveling up a large spoonful of dripping butterscotch. “I suppose he was always very concerned with what you thought of him.”
Draco felt relieved that he hadn’t had to disappoint anyone with the reality of who he really was.
“Fishcake went down the wrong way,” Draco croaked. “Is there a reason why you’re de-robing in the middle of the living room?”
is it?”
“Ronald Weasley - what on
Malfoy continued to walk away, straightening out his clothes with a sigh.
“Annoyed?” Draco asked, raising his eyebrows.
Harry tasted like orange and mint, probably from the Pimms he had been drinking earlier and his mouth was hot and wet. Draco moaned as he felt the other man’s tongue rub against his, Harry’s fingers were now tangled up in Draco’s hair, caressing the back of his scalp. Draco felt boneless, pretty sure that Harry was keeping them both upright as he tipped his head back and Harry separated their lips only to press damp breathed open mouthed kisses against Draco’s neck.
“Swear that merperson’s enchanted or something,” Ron muttered as he had his customary glare off with a rather vicious looking statue in the middle of a modest lily pond. “Wherever I’m standing in this place it always seems to be shooting daggers at me.”
“This is ridiculous,” Draco huffed, he shifted on his seat looking embarrassed, “I’m just going to end the charm.”
Draco still couldn’t remember her. He had felt uncomfortably nervous at first, wondering if she might recognize him from the Carrow’s reign of terror but Meredith, or Meri as she preferred, had simply commiserated with him on having had Binns as a history professor.
“They fixed the machine?” Ron asked eagerly.
“You know Harry Potter personally?” Nick asked, refilling everybody’s wine glasses, lord knows how they were going to get any work done that afternoon. Although, Draco figured it might make dealing with reports a little more tolerable.
“Well it’s a slippery slope until your forties now,” Draco announced, licking his finger before turning over a page.
,” Ron pleaded, desperate not to let the evening turn into another ethics debate that could end up with him sleeping on the sofa.
“Blast it,” Malfoy muttered, staring intently at his fingertips. “I’ve become a prune.”
“Just pray that Pewterfoot doesn’t give him the Datchet case,” Harry grumbled as the department head finally made an entrance.
“Potentially,” Harry chuckled, “but I thought you might find this place interesting. I mean your mother’s family lived here right?”
~**~**~
Draco laughed before he could help himself, “Oh? One of my friends works for Comet if you need me to get you a sample half sized version fit for the occasion?”
“What,” Draco began, summoning all his reserve courage.  “What is it you want from me Harry? Do you want my forgiveness? Do you want me to fix up your house? Do you want to just not feel guilty when you see me out and about, wondering if I’m still sat all alone at home taking to imaginary French people?”
~**~**~                       ~**~**~                       ~**~**~
“Curses?” Harry asked excitedly before calling out across the table. “Hey Bill, what do you know about occamy eggs?”
“Enter,” came the bellowed demand. Harry wondered for a split moment if they were in trouble before recalling that Pewterfoot rarely lowered his voice below ninety decibels. The Head Auror’s office was composed of a smaller study area and then a larger conference room where most of the staff briefings were held.
Draco hauled himself out of bed before traipsing groggily to the kitchen, making sure to accio a hangover potion on the way. The potion served to rid him of the painful percussion section that had taken up residence behind Draco’s eyeballs.
“He didn’t get the cauldron then?” Harry asked.
“They absolutely do not!” Hermione declared. “You only answered two questions last time Dean.”
“Mione, we
“Cheers,” Penny beamed, clinking her glass against Harry’s bottle. Harry smiled and took a sip, feeling himself start to relax in the sun. Penny really was rather nice, Harry thought to himself and she looked awfully good in her strappy floral sun dress.
Harry chewed on his lip whilst nodding. Ron was right in one respect, they had done this plenty of times and whilst the violating nature of the new memory laws were always being criticized in the papers they had also saved a lot of innocent people from being wrongly convicted. Harry wondered if Malfoy would be one of them.
Harry chanced looking up to see that Hermione was now sat very straight on the sofa, pursing her lips whilst Ron’s face had contorted somewhere between concern and horror.
This time it was Potter’s turn to splutter into his glass, the other man was still wheezing when Luna absently passed him a pink cocktail umbrella as if that would sort him out somehow.
“Goodness,” Philippe replied, “that does sound rather unfortunate.”
“Hey!” Harry beamed. The other man was wearing faded blue shorts and a salmon pink T-shirt that complimented his skin tone.
“I take it you finally checked your mail then,” Ron grinned ruefully. “Sorry mate but Ginny literally cast a spell on us to make sure we couldn’t let the cat out of the bag until people had seen their invitations. You know how I can’t keep my mouth shut half the time but I didn’t fancy being covered in giant green pustules for a week.”
“That’s not your fault ‘Mione,” Ron scrunched up his face, “he was bloody awful to you at school, the things he used to say.”
Harry stood stunned for a moment before darting forwards as if to try and help the other man up. Malfoy blinked in shock as he registered his new position on the tiles before letting out an undignified snort of laughter.
“Christ,” Malfoy mumbled, removing his arm and using his sleeve to mop at his brow. He looked exhausted Harry noticed, dark circles under his eyes from having stayed late at the office the previous night attempting to file a new mountain of reports.
Draco chewed worriedly on his lip, at least a Pensieve Probe couldn’t actually read the mind of the person being probed, if that had happened then Potter would also be aware that he heavily featured in Draco’s wanking fantasies.
“Draco,” Odette reached out and squeezed his shoulder sympathetically, “from what you’ve told me of Harry Potter he’s a decent person, I don’t think you need to torture yourself like this.”
“Bit more than snogging,” Ron snorted, evidently still listening in.
“Furthermore, I could plant roses and buy a pair of gloves like mother used to have. I always remember her in the rose garden, pruning the Maiden’s Blush. I hate being in this cooped up flat, not even a small outside space! Can you imagine if I had a garden? I could fix trellises to the walls and plant clematis and wailing wisteria, the latter is a great substitute in a pinch for Bitter Root you know?”
Draco ignored her in favour of biting into his swirl, the pastry was golden and flaky and just right.
Harry saw the moment Malfoy’s shoulders slumped in tired resignation. “I can assure you,” Malfoy sighed, “I have no romantic interest in Marlene, nor am I stalking you. In fact, I believe this is only the third time we have run into each other outside of work this year –“
“Why are you getting so many deliveries recently?” she huffed shooing away the most recent snowy feathered visitor. “It’s like a bloody owlery in here, one even scratched my arm the other day flying past.”
“Should I remember that for lunch today?” Potter asked, his green eyes twinkling.
“Yeah,” Ron grinned, “It’ll be great, the weather forecast says it’ll be sunny all day from ten and I figured I’d round up a good crowd of people and I’ve already put in an order for a shi-“ he stopped abruptly and put his hands over his son’s ears, lowering his voice, “a
, it’s got a chapter on Thestral bone wands by Crispin Thistlebarrow.”
“Black sand would stabilize the potion!” Draco retorted at the same time Hermione said, “That would balance it out!”
Draco tried to take Odette’s advice on board, he wasn’t exactly alone in the world for those things. It shouldn’t have come as a shock to Potter that even a Malfoy had basic bodily functions. No, the worst thing was obviously that Draco had used the Pop up Pals, that probably was quite unusual. God damn it why couldn’t Draco have been accused of potions smuggling
“If Mr. Malfoy surrendered his memories, and they, along with his statement on Veritaserum match up with his proclaimed innocence then it will be enough to stop the Bureau des Aurors sequestering him back to Paris.” Pewterfoot explained.
“I beg your pardon?” Draco asked, startled into finally talking.
“Since when does Grimmauld Place have a garden?” Ron asked. Harry guess it was a fair enough question. Harry had only discovered the large expanse himself after the war when he had gotten tired of searching for the back door key and simply blasted it open to find he had been transported to Jumanji, although there were a few more disgruntled hedgehogs than stampeding elephants.
“You’re burning the chicken,” Magalie noted absently.
The fact that some smug face aurors had been privy to Draco’s memories was bad enough. He tried to catalogue every potentially shameful or embarrassing thing he had done over the time period in question. He wondered how far the investigation confidentiality would actually stretch for an ex death eater dancing around the kitchen in his underpants whilst his imaginary friend belted out the lyrics to
Harry had watched patiently for an hour, the fast forward spell forgotten, as Malfoy charmed a needle and set to work repairing the rip in his waistcoat. Harry had also discovered that the variety of odd potions ingredients that Malfoy purchased were so the other man could brew his own skin and haircare remedies at home. Whilst there were more convenient ready bottled options available, it was clear that Malfoy had grown up accustomed to a certain level of quality that he could no longer afford.
“Ah, would this be something to do with why I didn’t hear from you for weeks after giving you my card?” she questioned, passing Draco her slices of boiled egg. “You know we can still sue the department right? For profiling you and discrimination.”
“Yes, I thought you might not be best pleased,” Pewterfoot huffed, “but I couldn’t get hold of you could I? Apparently you were sprinting all across the west country whilst I had Cerisier and Laurent breathing down my neck.”
“I see,” Malfoy replied tightly, his fingers finding his sleeve again. “Thank you.”
~**~**~
“Peachy,” Draco coughed, blinking water from his eyes and attempting to slick back the blond hair that had stuck to his face.
“You’ll never guess what you have to press to make the water come out –“ Ron began when Harry decided he really would rather never know and cleared his throat rather pointedly. Unfortunately, however, this had the effect of Ron stopping for a moment before his face took on an exaggerated sly grin. “Would you excuse me you two, I think my sausages are burning!”
there had to be a reason you suddenly wanted to see me after all these years,” Draco rasped, despising the way he couldn’t wrangle his voice into anything sounding solid or firm. “Are you all having a good time then?” he snapped, looking at Ron’s grim expression and Dean, Neville and Bill’s shocked ones. Luna looked somewhat sympathetic but somehow that was worse, it made Draco’s blood boil with anger.
of Harry’s here, I got a bit of an earful in the canteen the other day didn’t I Harry?”
“Couple of minutes,” Harry grinned, “although that’ll be enough time for Hermione to rip him a new one.”
“When I was fourteen we spent a fortnight in Japan, travelling around Kansai,” Malfoy continued, “but what was even more exciting the year after was the cruise that mother insisted we go on round Cape Horn. An al…” Malfoy appeared to be finding it difficult to finish his sentence, his face crumpled up in giggles, “An a-albatross shat on father’s head!”
“Oh fuck off Potter, maybe you can bugger off back home then,” Draco huffed. “See if I ever offer you cuddles ever again.”
“Thanks Mione,” Harry grinned, jumping up and pulling out his wand.
“You’re welcome,” Harry grinned, leaning back against the wall and realizing he had been sweating. God only knew why that bloody marble was so important right now.
Hermione sighed but her expression was fond. “No, Harry, I think Draco was probably just a little embarrassed. But you had to go and jump straight in didn’t you? I mean he only agreed to forgive you and be your friend
nemesis,” Draco amended as Odette still rolled her eyes, “suddenly had front row seats to every minutiae of your life.”
“Oh poor Draco!” Magalie exclaimed, laughing. “I suppose we shall have rhubarb crumble for dessert as well?”
“No!” Harry bellowed, even though he knew he was being ridiculous. “it’s not in the sodding kitchen, come on Malfoy, it was right after you finished brewing that vial of Pepper Up, you took one of the orange marbles and put it
He sighed as he wandered into his bedroom and began to change into pajamas. At any rate, if Harry had been watching Draco’s memories carefully it would have been made abundantly clear that Draco didn’t know what he was doing in that area. Perhaps it was wishful thinking anyway, Harry was probably this close and teasing with all his friends. Draco finally had Harry Potter’s attention and he didn’t want to cock it up by assuming things.
“Well you better get on that then,” he replied, trying to focus on the document in front of him from the Ministère des Affaires Magiques. “Seeing as I only deal with the French and Italian liason offices.”
Harry started in surprise, slipping on the wet floor and nearly braining himself on the sink.
“Mind out of the gutter please Harry,” Draco smirked, “I was simply referring to something other people don’t know about.”
“What did you expect?” Harry smiled with amusement at Ron’s familiar impatience, “For him to intermittently jump up on his desk and proclaim his undying hatred for all muggle borns?”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. The only thing worse for Malfoy than someone seeing him like this would be a
“For his
“Oh no, more recently than that,” Andromeda said, “must have been about four years ago, I ran into him at Potage’s on Diagon Alley. He was trying to pay for a new cauldron but the coupons had expired. I remember Witch Weekly had been running this promotion – you had to try and find these dancing cauldron icons hidden somewhere in the papers and if you cut enough of them out the idea was you could get a 40% discount on one of the pewter models.”
“Plus,” Malfoy clearly wasn’t finished and seemed to be on a gleeful roll as Lisette nodded dutifully along, “you’d think with all his money that Potty could at least afford a uniform that actually fit!”
“I know right?” Harry bounced up on his tiptoes, looking inexplicably pleased. Next, Harry led Draco through into a kitchen whose size made Draco’s look like a broom cupboard. Draco held his breath as he took in the expanse of work surfaces, fashioned from ancient English oak, the cabinets were clearly enchanted elm and Draco could hear their whispers as he passed by, begging him to fill them with goods.
“Had a nice old laugh at the pathetic little Death Eater who doesn’t have any friends so he has to conjure them?” Draco continued, willing himself to just shut the hell up and storm out of there. Thank god the muffling charm was still active on their table so at least the entire pub couldn’t witness this.
Harry brought his own hand up to hit himself on the head, what the
“I can assure you I will,” Winshaw scoffed, “I have much better things to be doing with my time.”
Harry blinked in surprise as he realised Ed Winshaw and Marlene were standing in front of them, laden down with shopping bags.
Potter could.
“Pssh,” Draco said dismissively, “do you really think that little peck could scare me off?”
know what all the strange runes etched into the chimney meant? Hermione had given it a go but said she couldn’t locate enough relevant historical texts. Would Malfoy have blustered and protested when Harry tore down the practically ancient Siberian Silk Spider curtains because he couldn’t figure out how to get the dust out of them? It irked Harry a little, he had worked hard for his life, lost loved ones and made terrible sacrifices to now have all these things that perhaps the man sitting in front of him might actually be able to appreciate in a way Harry couldn’t?
“Charmed albatrosses,” Luna replied, happily licking at her spoon.
“Exactly,” Harry nodded solemnly, trying not to smile. “Look, just take a breather, accio some of our late reports and get on with them whilst I go back in there.”
Harry gulped, his words caught in his throat as he was confronted with the reflection of Malfoy’s naked arse cheeks. They were small and pert, a ghostly white in colour and the left one jiggled as Malfoy poked and prodded it before summoning a healing lotion.
Harry shook his head, wondering whether he should be feeling insulted, exasperated or fond.
“Mione won’t give me any more nausea potions,” Ron coughed, taking a swig of the ginger ale and breathing deeply for a few moments until he looked a little less green. “She says you build up an immunity to them.”
~**~**~
Harry laughed, but it sounded fond. “And as for what I want, yeah I would bloody love for you to forgive me. No, I don’t expect you to fix my house for me, I just kind of wanted to show you it because I thought you might be able to appreciate it, I don’t know anything about pure blood donut magic,”
you juvenile dimwits!” Draco shrieked to be heard over the ruckus, he could feel his cheeks heating up.
Draco eyed the large fireplace enviously, there was an open bag of floo powder on the mantelpiece. Draco had looked into trying to find somewhere that would allow him to regularly firecall his mother and commute from home but availability had been scarce and out of his price range. He sighed, turning back to Harry before squawking in alarm.
“He did, did he?” Harry muttered as he looked around and realised that yes, he could spot quite a few fellow aurors, all looking remarkably relaxed and casual out of their usual red uniforms.
“I like the one with avocado and Tiger prawns,” Draco sniffed.
“Yes I knew that,” Hermione’s eyes had narrowed even further now, “I’m confused as to how
Draco cracked his back as soon as he walked through the door. It had been a rough day at work in some oft forgotten basement room at the Ministry of Magic. Piles of paperwork higher than Mount Everest seemed to be dumped on his desk with alarming regularity and it was all he could do to diligently work through them whilst keeping one eye on the clock.
The next day would be Sunday, the last one of the month which would normally mean a big roast at the Weasley’s. However, Molly and Arthur had decided to go away for a long weekend to a cottage in Cornwall before the schools broke up and it all got too crowded.
Harry sighed, all the enthusiasm for the barbeque dissipating as quickly as it had come. He glanced back down at the menus before shaking his head and dialing for a pizza instead.
“Um,” Draco replied, “thank you?”
“No – no,
“Draco,” the older man said kindly, “you look like you have news?”
anything.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, “It’s part of the Dark Ring case, but it’s honestly a dead end.”
given a high dose? How could his interrogation have happened already? It’s mine and Ron’s case.”
~**~**~
“Oh is that what that was?” Draco had a twinkle in his eye as he shucked off his gardening gloves. “I assumed Kreacher had brought another date home.”
“Blimey,” Harry repeated. “Well, good on you and Winshaw for figuring that one out.”
Draco gave him a withering look before reaching out his long fingers and pinching them around Harry’s bicep before pulling them both into the floo.
They had all had a little bit too much wine with their lunch but it had served to infuse Draco with a pleasant buzz as he snorted at a joke that Matthew was telling. Odette’s friends were an odd assortment of people that seemed to share the same sharp wit and distain of unnecessary paperwork. Matthew didn’t actually even work at the Ministry but had a job at Comet Brooms in the aerodynamic design department.
“I –“ Draco began, finding his throat painfully dry. “I’m so sorry, I –“
“Draco!” she cried exuberantly. “I think you’ve caught the sun, your nose is – oh!” she noticed Harry and blinked at him.
“Leave off him,” Ron chuckled, “we’re still in the middle of a Pensieve Probe and you know can’t drink and dive.”
“Oh mate,” Ron’s face turned somber, “please don’t tell me you’ll be inviting the ferret to the next barbeque.”
“Merlin,” Draco muttered, of course the ‘saviour’ would be blessed in every way. Harry smiled before reaching down to wrap his fingers around Draco’s own cock, causing the blond to let out a surprised shout. Harry’s grip was just on the right side of tight as he slid his hand down Draco’s throbbing prick, pulling his foreskin over the sensitive glans before swiping the purpled head with the pad of this thumb.
need better hobbies,” Harry scoffed as Ron grinned sheepishly.
“I’ll feed you in a moment Nautilus,” Pewterfoot muttered, waving his hand at the depressed looking cephalopod.
“What the fuck?!” Ron screeched as Draco felt around for a moment before his fingers landed on a small jar of dried herbs.
“I thought you might want yours before it went soggy,” Harry informed him. “Oh wow, it’s nice and cool in here isn’t it?”
“Oh!” Harry piped up, settling down on the coffee table. “You’ve lost your marbles?” He laughed before realizing that Malfoy had actually started shaking, his hands still firmly pressed against his face.
It had been Narcissa’s fault really. In his mid twenties Draco had fallen into a black cloud of depression. It was when the cat calling on the streets and the hate mail to his various ‘meant to be secret’ P.O. boxes had just seemed insurmountable. Narcissa had suggested Draco reconnecting with some of his old friends, in order to get a bit of a support circle going.
“At least the rest of you has somewhat grown into it,” Draco supplied before turning a little pink and busying himself with a napkin.
“Well,” Magalie began after flickering in and out of her reset, “what’s the worst that could happen?”
“That’s what you need,” Magalie sighed as she brought her sock clad feet up underneath her on the sofa.
“Listen here, you inbred cretin,” Malfoy began imperiously, drawing himself up to his full height, “I have every right to go shopping on a Saturday along with the rest of the bloody wizarding population. Now give me my book back before you damage it with those grease stained frankfurters you call fingers!”
“Yeah?” Harry asked, chuckling. “Would you like a winter ice cream Draco?”
Draco smiled smugly, feeling a little emboldened as he moved to catch the nipple between his lips, sucking lightly and eliciting another moan.
“Ah,” Bill’s eyes widened, “the Sorcha Curse.”
“Bugger,” Pewterfoot huffed, “there goes another angelfish.” He shook his head before redirecting his attention towards Harry and Ron. “Well, for one, the suspect’s mother currently resides in Paris.”
“Nothing,” Harry groaned, sinking lower in the water until his chin was submerged. “So are you getting in or do I have to get and out and grab you.”
“I agree with you Hermione,” Harry sighed. “You know I do, but it might be the only way to clear him of suspicion and he gave up the memories voluntarily.”
“No,” Draco sighed, “Potter is far too golden to debase himself like that.”
Harry’s eyes snapped up as Malfoy spoke for the first time. His voice, although still cold and posh, had lost its loud, imperious nature. The witch, Marlene, whose hair was big and curled, gave him a cursory grunt. Harry waited for Malfoy to snap at her, didn’t she
“Not exactly, I mean sort of,” Harry sighed, “it’s to do with work.”
“Draco,” Luna announced, “are you interested in bones?”
Draco turned around to see an outraged looking teenager with green hair and pierced ears, headphones hung around his neck, blasting some sort of loud music, the genre of which Draco wouldn’t be able to identify if you paid him.
Harry turned slowly round to see Malfoy grinning ruefully as the imaginary friend covered him in air kisses before turning her attention on the cupcake. “Plum?” she enquired happily.
Potter looked nice too, not that that was particularly surprising. The other man was wearing an obnoxiously red T-shirt with faded denims and what were once presumably white trainers. Only somehow the whole outfit just seemed to compliment Potter’s aesthetic, with his hairbrush allergic bird’s nest, unshaven facial hair and milk coffee coloured skin.
“I reckon it was payback, for that artifacts deal that went wrong last week,” Ron nodded. “Anyway, Pewterfoot wants to see us.”
Teddy paused before looking over at Draco, his hair fading from green to brown then back again. “We’re related aren’t we?” he asked bluntly.
,” he could feel pinpricks behind his eyes. “
“Excuse me?” Draco frowned.
“Too bad they can’t drag Galespawn out of retirement for the upcoming match against the Magpies,” Draco stage whispered to Harry, thoroughly enjoying himself, “I reckon if the Canons charmed his zimmerframe to fly they might actually stand a better chance than they do right now.”
“Right! Sorry,” Harry apologized, quickly grabbing the squeezy bottle and handing it over.
“I can’t believe I was ever jealous,” Draco sighed, digging into his soy fig, which was creamy and tangy in all the right places.
and do his job? A petite boy with sandy hair wandered out from a side office, half a pepperoni stick stuck in his mouth.
“We’re all a bit exhausted what with the Mudchute Troll Fights finally being closed down,” Penny smiled as she walked with Harry towards a gingham cloth covered table upon which sat bottles of beer and bowls of crisps.
“Actually he might be coming to the pub on Friday, you know, if you wanted to drop by. A few of us tend to turn up and there’s a quiz this week, our team always rakes it in because we’ve got Hermione and Luna’s still in the country so –“ Potter trailed off as Draco turned around slowly and fixed him with a pointed gaze. “Um, do they not have the book then?” Potter looked almost nervous, twiddling his wand between his fingers.
Draco took a sharp breath, so he had been right in his conclusions. Draco’s ‘play date’ had been Potter’s good deed for the week.
“I’m not even going to dignify that with a response,” Hermione replied.
Instead, Draco got to do data entry, the expensive green feathered quill he had especially treated himself to five Christmases ago went woefully underused. The most recent auror report that Draco had been made to translate into comprehensible English had been written by the golden boy himself – Harry Potter.
Despite the seizing of the family’s assets, Malfoy had seemingly managed to hang onto a few treasured heirlooms and antiques. These items he would bring out every so often to show to Philippe or Lisette and excitedly tell them of its provenance and the magic within. Harry thought of all the artifacts in Grimmauld Place that he had unceremoniously bundled into the attic before sealing the door.
“Huh,” Ron stated, squinting at Harry’s chin, “I think you’ve just made it more pointy to be brutally honest.”
“Oh fuck,” Harry hissed as his gaze fell on Malfoy. The other man had shucked his pajama bottoms off and unbuttoned his shirt, perhaps he had never even done it up in the first place. His pale skin was faintly illuminated by the candlelight and bathed in a sheen of sweat, suggesting he had been at this a while. Malfoy’s face was red and scrunched up, his lower lip caught between his teeth and his eyes pressed firmly closed. The curve of the other man’s spine was arched up off the duvet and his knees were spread apart, fallen open so wide that his thighs were quivering with the stretch.
can sign my school absence request form?”
by Cadmus Poenitet…” Malfoy paused for a moment as both he and Harry blinked at the books.
“Let’s hope it stays that way,” Penny grinned, her teeth white and shiny.
“I heard Bill talking about it at the Burrow, you know Ron’s brother – he’s a Gringott’s curse breaker,” Potter explained as Draco nodded. Typical of course, that a Weasley would hold Draco’s dream job, if this ‘Bill’ was anything like his younger brother Draco had little hope for the world at large.
He had come to a fourth conclusion.
,” Magalie blushed happily before aiming a pointed look at Draco. “is this
He stumbled about trying to undo his shoelaces whilst stretching across and snatching impatiently at the package. It smelled like lavender and marzipan as Draco finally snagged it with long, bony fingers and went to settle on the sofa. Draco emptied the contents onto the pale yellow couch cover and studied them.
“I see,” Draco narrowed his eyes, “why?”
“Oi,” Harry protested, Draco wasn’t pointy, he was refined and elegant looking. He realised he must have said the last part out loud as his friends burst into laughter again.
“I should hope not,” Draco sniffed, “I thought perhaps you’d developed a taste for it after the Great Lake episode during the Triwizard Cup.”
“I suppose I could come see your ridiculously neglected house,” Draco sighed wearily, if only to visit your bathroom and witness where the musical magic happens.”
“It’s quiz night,” Draco sighed, “at the Hairy Gooseberry – where is my bloody sock? Why am I trying to put on my shoe without my sock?!”
?” Malfoy gasped, sliding all the way down the way until he was crouched on the dirty street. Harry reached for his wand, the fast forward spell on the tip of his tongue but not before he caught Malfoy groan.
“No problem Sir,” Ron grinned, puffing out his chest, “I’ll get you a full kilo sack on your desk by tomorrow.”
“It’s like looking into the mind of a psychopath,” Ron whispered in horrified tones as Malfoy polished off the rest of the fruit before casting a cleaning charm on his fingers and unscrewing the top of a Thermos.
“I can’t find my flip flops,” Harry huffed.
~**~**~
“I mean take last week’s match against the Frankfurt Falken, Mila Muller was able to pull off that feint twice –
“Another dark wizard’s been decapitated!” Ron shouted in a tone of voice that probably shouldn’t ever be employed when announcing a beheading.
“Yes, I think he may have gathered that information from rather questionable sources,” Hermione sighed, “but my point is you’ve seemed a little down for a while now, I honestly think Ron was just trying to help. You know how he has to be proactive about these things.”
“Shit,” Harry bit out miserably, “look Draco –“
? “I reckon if you’re calling Hermione by her first name, you should probably do the same for me.”
By the time Draco got back to his office there was a Ministry pygmy owl sitting on his desk. Draco unrolled the parchment.
“He went flying,” Ron nodded gravely, “ended up in the fountain getting intimate with a koi fish.”
“Are you stalking us or something?”
He stopped the spell at around quarter past nine in the evening, which tended to be the time that Malfoy cast a relaxation charm and got into bed. Relaxation charms hadn’t been too uncommon at Hogwarts, they created a localized ambience such as birdsong or the sounds of rain. You could also have images or different coloured lights projected on the walls around you. Harry had once pulled back Dean Thomas’ curtain to find a mesmerising carousel of swooping birds.
“Obsessed,” Ron nodded as Harry pretended to busy himself with paperwork. “That’s what you are, bloody sixth year all over again.”
A team of janitorial staff were scurrying to and fro waving their wands and stationing cooling charms at certain pressure points. Draco found himself jostled and nudged in the crowds, slipping slightly so the fingers of his right hand grazed the surface of the fountain in the middle of the space. Draco sighed in slight relief as he found the water to be pleasantly cool. He half considered stripping naked and just diving in the bloody thing, it wasn’t like his reputation could fall any lower at this point.
book shop. They had already spent forty five minutes in Pearl’s Parchments and another twenty in the literature section of the Mungo’s charity shop. Harry crossed the entrance to Banbury Cheese, which seemed a rather odd name for a book store and was immediately greeted by a number of wizened, old, long haired cats, perched upon teetering piles of books.
“Oh, feeling fancy today are we?” Harry commented with a smile as Malfoy scooped two spoonfuls of the tea into a glazed brown ceramic teapot and drew a strainer out of the cutlery drawer.
Harry thought of Malfoy’s kitchen, it was probably an sixth of the size of Harry’s but for some reason it always felt warm. Charmed white wax candles gave it a homely glow whilst the fridge was covered in dragon themed magnets that held down grocery lists. Harry hadn’t been able to imagine Malfoy sitting down to write a shopping list until he had witnessed the other man hunched over with his quill and cross referencing a recipe book for the exact kind of mushrooms he required.
“Sup Harry?” Neville smiled cheerfully. After school, Neville had spent some time abroad penning a variety of well received research papers on South American aquatic Herbology before taking up the teaching position at Hogwarts when Sprout retired.
friends. It didn’t stop him spending a good chunk of his monthly earnings on them however.
Harry glanced up as Ron paled further and began to backtrack. “I mean it’s better than Azkaban! Don’t worry, I’ve seen the cells before – they’re quite comfy really, I mean not
“The cooking makes sense,” Hermione nodded.
“Well then,” the witch announced, “I suppose you either give me the galleons or you can take a quick trip to Macedonia and get some feathers yourself.”
“Okay,” Harry nodded, “I’ll see you in a bit.”
“Don’t I?” Draco muttered before seemingly relenting. “Fine, I’ll come with you for ice cream but if you do something ridiculous like order plain vanilla I’m leaving.”
“Cross could be an understatement,” Ron muttered under his breath.
exactly do you think had to pick up that slack whilst you took an unannounced holiday?” Marlene retorted indignantly.
“It’s just plain incompetence, that’s what it is!” Picklemarsh bellowed, a bobble head figurine of a quidditch player from the seventies started to nod voraciously in agreement on his desk.
“Reckon he’s being framed then?” Ron asked, squinting as the fish tank in the corner suddenly let out a burst of light. The squid had apparently inked itself and was also clearly a magical creature as the ink was bright pulsating neon.
“Made you look,” Bill winked.
“Whose favourite did you say Edith Piaf was?” Draco pressed. Suddenly the evening didn’t seem quite as warm, despite the back of his shirt sticking to Draco’s skin.
“Tell me about it!” Draco jumped as Ronald Weasley’s voice boomed across the table. The red headed auror was sitting across from Draco and Hermione wearing a bright orange Canons’ shirt which all things considered seemed rather thick faced after their performance this season. “Harry and I have been sweating our bollocks off in the office.”
“Maybe that’s your key to political change then?” Philippe suggested with an amused raise of a bushy eyebrow, “Reverse psychology.”
“Huh?” Harry jerked his head up to see Ron peering at him over the map he was holding.
“A curse breaker,” Malfoy finished quietly.
talked to him in years,” Hermione spoke carefully.
“It’s the morning,” Draco snapped.
“Brute,” Draco sniffed, trying not to smile, “I haven’t even had my Sunday morning croissant.”
Draco pursed his lips together in a smile, the salt had been a bit of a wild card but after reading an article on embedded curse layers he’d had a hunch it might work.
“Oh,” Malfoy’s eyes widened as he spotted the lone orange marble.
“Why don’t you send some suggestions in to your superiors?” Philippe asked, peering over his gold rimmed spectacles. He was holding a newspaper that flickered in and out of existence depending on his posture. Much like their outfits, Harry had deduced that the Pop Up Pals were also able to have certain identifying props with them. Magalie was mostly seen with a wine glass and Philippe with a newspaper. Harry hadn’t yet spotted Lisette holding anything. As far as he could work out, Malfoy had three of the charmed imaginary friends as indicated by the three different colours of marbles that he hoarded around the house.
“Will you be in your baggy underpants?” Draco asked with an innocently enquiring expression.
“Would really love it if you stopped insinuating I’m an alcoholic with the mental age of a five year old,” Harry grumbled.
“Fine, if you’re not going to shut up until I give myself a perfunctory dunk in the pool,” he huffed. “But I need to pop inside first.”
“I’m just saying!” Harry threw up his hands. “He’s got all these interesting ideas and knowledge and it just seems like a waste he has no one real to talk to. I mean he’s really into curse theory how it can relate to potions, I can imagine him having a great conversation with Bill.”
“Did it really? I suppose that doesn’t surprise me, they’re very intelligent birds. When did you see that happen? They don’t tend to show up in the British Isles.” Luna summoned a glass shaker of multi coloured sprinkles over to the table before depositing a sizeable pile atop of her ice cream.
Harry cast another tempus, it was 17:26, he was just about to give up and floo home when he caught a flash of white blond hair.
~**~**~
“Good morning Marlene,”
Besides, Harry had made sure to angle himself in such a way that he couldn’t see anything beneath the inch thick layer of bubbles Malfoy had whipped up with a steaming purple potion. All that was visible were the very tops of Malfoy’s shoulders and his knees which had turned a bright pink from the hot water.
There was a loud whoosh as the brick wall in front of them dissolved into large French patio doors, gleaming glass in white wood frames. The doors folded back as bright sunshine bathed the kitchen and a gust of sweet smelling fresh air swept in from the outside.
“Not this Friday,” Harry shook his head. It was true, everyone had agreed that they would save the drinking for the party the next day. Even so, Harry would have still chosen to hang out with Draco if the other man was giving him a chance.
“No,” Andromeda sighed, “he was arguing with the shopkeeper when he caught sight of me, must have recognized me from family photographs or something as he went white as a sheet and fled the shop like a basilisk was on his tail.”
“Mmnph,” Malfoy’s voice was breathless and slightly strangled. Harry, having scoured most of the bedroom floor by now had come to the devastating conclusion that the wand must have rolled
Draco scowled, "Draco gets an allowance for personal items and must not go over his monthly allowance."
"Uggggh."Draco said. Tears were leaking out of his eyes. "No. No I don't need it."
She lay her body across Harry's lap, her ass sticking up in the air. She had clearly had spankings already tonight, the poor beautiful cheeks were red with some bruising, and there were caning stripes down her legs. "What did you do to get time in the cage?" Harry asked.
Draco nodded, "Of course, sir. Whatever you say. I'll do my best to make you a proud dominant husband."
They have you stay on your knees on the floor, with your elbows resting on the couch. "You horrible little Sub. We allow you to fuck us in our homes and you repay us by coming without permission?" Draco asks as he lands the first blow to your backside.
The Masters put their clothes back on and you start realizing that you need the bathroom, but you aren't permitted to speak to ask permission to go. You are unsure what to do, so you bit your lip, hoping they'll notice. It takes a moment, but you squeezed your legs together bounce a little. "Do you need the toilet?" Harry asks.
"Yes," he said after you apologize profusely. "We are easing into it a bit. We are trying to find our way as well. Can you be patient with us?"
"Yes Master Harry." You scurry off to the kitchen. It takes you a moment to locate the tea service, but you boil the water on the stove and fill up two teacups, setting them on a servette with milk and sugar. You find a pack of biscuits and add them as well.
"Indeed," Hermione says. "But don't let it go to her head."
"Were you trying to get a punishment?"
"What if I want you to spank me for a change?" Harry asked, raising an eyebrow.
Things were quiet in the couple of weeks after that. Draco did have a more cheerful and servile spirit. There were only moments where Harry had to swat Draco's behind lightly as a disciplinary reminder. The sex they enjoyed was vigorous and pleasurable.
"Do you think you deserve that? Do you think you deserve to be in this cage?"
When you finish, you began a slow jog around the yard. Their backyard is big, and luckily remote enough that there are no neighbors who can witness your humiliation. "Listen Girl," Harry calls. "We want to see those tits bounce while you run!"
Harry reached down to stroke Ted's cock and it didn't take long until he was coming, hard and fast on the bed. As he came his already tight asshole quivered and it sent shocks of pleasure through Harry's cock and he spilled his own seed.
"Yes sir," Amy said. She turned and Harry watched her deep purple ass make its way back into the kitchen. He said Ted eyeing Draco's ass in the same way. Harry's cock was rock hard, something he couldn't help but notice about Ted as well.
"You all right babe?" Harry asked.
"That's all I ask."
"Try to get it off," Harry said.
Harry chuckled, "That's for sure," he agreed. "Still you need your punishment for this one, OK? This is a bad rule breaking."
"We are going to stop early on Sunday, but if it's too much for you, use your safeword." You nod.
Through it all, they never broke eye contact with their subs, and as they got closer and closer and the pounding became harder, Harry noticed Draco was positively shaking with need, and Amy was biting her lip so hard he was surprised she hadn't drawn blood.
"You OK making him watch as we fuck?"
"You have a safeword."
2-Harry will choose recipes in a cook book, and Draco must try a new one every day. On Harry's work days, Draco is responsible for dinner.
"You are going to sit in the dining room and write lines for us until lunch time," Master Harry says. "Master Draco is waiting for you."
They continued to talk a little about Draco's needs and Harry's needs. And finally after a long time, they had a list that looked like this:
"We should talk about spanking," Harry said.
"Of course."
You eat your own food standing up, your butt too sore to sit on one of the hard wooden kitchen chairs. You serve yourself only water, not sure if you are permitted to drink their wine. It looks expensive, after all, and you know that Subs are not worth that kind of expense.
“Why can’t they just
“Oh?” Draco questioned, “were you planning on showing me the rest of your wardrobe then?”
“Like, uncomfortable tight?” Harry frowned. “Because I’m sure they look fine.”
“I hoped the beard might even it out,” Harry chuckled, “although Ginny’s threatened that she wants it shaved for the wedding.”
“You know it’s rude to leave in the middle of a conversation,” Harry huffed, trailing after the other man. He knew Malfoy’s weekend morning routine pretty well by now but instead of going into the kitchen for breakfast first thing like usual, Malfoy headed straight to the living room window where he had installed a post collection box. Harry had one of the devices too, the inherent charms unlocked when owls approached and allowed them to deposit their mail whilst a treat was dispensed.
“Here,” Odette nudged Malfoy as the lift doors dinged open to the communal floo area. “This is my card, It’s got my office number on there, if you ever want to grab a quick work lunch just let me know. My girlfriend Meredith is in the Magical Creature office and she bloody
“Hmm,” Harry agreed thoughtfully.
“Right,” Harry squeaked, whipping out his wand before Malfoy could metaphorically do the same, and casting the fast forward spell.
Harry’s mouth hung open as he tried to remember what he was even doing in Draco Malfoy’s bedroom. Malfoy’s other hand, which had previously been pinching mercilessly at his left nipple, leaving it pert and pinked, now came sliding down the bed sheets.
“Oh dear,” Hermione frowned down at her lemonade, “that should all be behind us now.”
“Oh bugger you all,” Harry grumbled, slouching down in the chair.
just forget?”
Back home, carefully packed in Harry’s suitcase, was a ring, that although it wasn’t quite four carats, he was pretty sure Draco was going to say ‘yes’ anyway.
“I know it was you,” Harry snapped, glaring at Winshaw, “you’re the one that gave the witness report about Draco. You realise if I reported it to Pewterfoot it would go on your record that you wasted departmental time and resources, distracting attention from solving an important case?”
“Yeah?” Harry asked, bracing himself.
Draco whimpered as he could feel himself growing hard in his shorts and then utterly relieved when he realised the same thing was happening to Harry. Their crotches brushed against each other, causing Draco to stutter forwards in a broken moan, seeking that delicious friction again.
“Ron,” Harry greeted through gritted teeth. Penny was smiling as she gazed up at Harry. She was quite short, even with her woven wedge sandals. Her usually up hair was down in a sleek black mane and she was wearing a pretty, plum coloured lipstick.
Dean’s girlfriend Yasmin, who apparently had been designated the team’s scribe upon having the neatest handwriting, quickly wrote the answer down as Hermione cast a muffling charm over their table.
“You’d be fine with it would you?” Draco retorted. “If your childhood nemesis –“
“Hey guys, Draco, I mean, Malfoy came,” Potter announced nervously. Draco rolled his eyes before sitting down in a spare seat and turning to the witch beside him. “Good evening Granger,”
“So who says I’m charming?” Harry grinned slyly, swimming back towards Draco in a predatory fashion. It half made Draco want to employ his quickest backstroke and get the hell out of there but he stood his ground firmly, albeit suspended in the deep end of the pool.
“Good lord Potter be quiet,” Draco snapped feeling heat on his cheeks, the last bloody thing he needed right now was Harry publically showing concern for his bowel habits. “I would quite like to pretend for at least one day that you were not in my memories for a month and are blissfully ignorant of my toileting needs.”
“Stunning,” Draco nodded, looking pleased with the information he had acquired. “Now tell me an embarrassing habit you have, something you do when you think no one’s watching.”
“Please don’t do that Harry,” Hermione replied, “at least wait until he’s cooked the corn on the cob, you know it’s my favourite.”
For some reason it made Harry feel like a stone had settled in his stomach as he forced another gulp of now luke warm tea.
Harry snapped his eyes up at a strange sound. Draco was hunched over, wisps of blond hair covering his expression but his shoulders were shaking.
Draco pursed his lips as he pushed past Harry into the hallway. It had probably been a stupid idea, after all this Weasley – Longbottom fiesta was almost certainly going to have multiply birthday cakes, far more professional that Draco’s coffee and walnut creation he had whipped up at seven am that morning.
Especially Harry, the
Alexandre nodded in greeting to Draco before shrugging and speaking in thickly accented English, “I am not understanding why you would use this approach for a curse without, um, how to say? A core that is concrete?”
Draco tuned the boy out as he looked round in surprise. He supposed the time of day did somewhat explain the mass exodus from the offices. Draco turned to stalk back out of the offices, catching a murmured ‘rude’ from somewhere behind him as he left.
Draco groaned, embarrassed but horribly turned on as he threw his forearm across his face and tried to catch his breath. He was lying on his back now, completely exposed with his feet squashed up against the pillow. Draco’s chest was moving rapidly and he could feel his cock throbbing so hard it was almost painful, the wet tip stickily connecting with his abdomen.
“I took one for Hugo’s christening,” Harry frowned.
“Right, yeah, that’s probably for the best. Git’s right prickly at the best of times, reckon he’ll be a veritable hedgehog after this ordeal.”
There were three designs, one evidently meant for children as it depicted an animated cackling Babbity Rabbity who swiftly dissolved into the shape of a rabbit and hopped about the piece of card. The second bookmark showed a Georgian era gaggle of women, blushing and hiding behind their fans whilst a rather dashing looking man waved his wand about. Malfoy’s lips quirked a little at that one but he picked up the third design as his final choice.
“Oh bugger,” Malfoy snapped, his grey eyes narrowing down at the board, he looked eagerly up at Philippe, “rematch?”
, you brought me here so you and all your pals could laugh at me!”
“Why don’t you want me to see you?” Harry frowned, remembering who he was with.
Harry leaned closer into Hermione and lowered his voice as the others began to chat amongst themselves. “You don’t think I’ve messed it up do you?”
“Huh?” Harry turned to Hermione who let out a giggle before slapping her hand over her mouth.
“Harry,” Draco stopped, causing the other man to almost run into the back of him.
Draco moaned and squirmed, clutching at Harry’s arms as his eyes scrunched shut. Draco could feel his hips jerking towards Harry, urging him to go faster. There was another finger at his arse, rubbing its way into his crease before pressing at Draco’s hole.
“I doubt anybody would let you screw them in that outfit,” Draco smirked, looking Harry up and down. The other man had certainly kept his promise, although his baggy underwear wasn’t currently on display.
“Harry, mate! I think I gave you one of Luna’s bean burgers by mistake –“
“Okay,” Harry nodded, getting up to leave.
Harry watched as Malfoy carefully peeled back the lid of his pre filled glass so as not to spill any of the contents. There was a plate of sliced uncooked carrots on the coffee table along with a terracotta bowl of homemade hummus. Delicately torn fronds of parsley had been placed on the surface to quite a pleasing effect.
“What did you call them?” Meredith snorted.
~**~**~
“I’m sorry,” Harry interrupted bluntly. “What do you mean he
“He’s just sitting there,” Ron huffed about half an hour later.
“Hello Magalie,” Harry smiled, he could see Draco watching him out of the corner of his eye. “My name’s Harry. It’s a real pleasure to meet you at last.”
“Right, that’s it,” Ron huffed, lifting up his wand and casting the ‘fast forward’ spell.
For starters, in his daydreams Draco was always impeccably dressed whilst Potter would inevitably look a shambles. Draco tensed as Potter’s eyes raked over his appearance. Draco had quite forgotten to do his shirt and waistcoat back up and he knew he must look a complete mess with a flushed face and sweaty hair stuck up at all angles.
“I think I must put on a stone every time I come here,” Harry laughed affectionately. Andromeda always knew how to lay on a good afternoon spread. Harry had clocked off work early that day on account of wanting to be present for Teddy’s termly parent-teacher floo meetings. After hearing that whilst maintaining decent grades, Teddy had also managed to turn his Potions Professor’s hair into black and white badger stripes, Andromeda had suggested a strong cup of Earl Grey.
“I think I may have to reconsider my initial favourable impression of you,” Draco announced as Odette started giggling again and Matthew shook his head ruefully.
“The old Black House?” Draco asked. “I remember going there when I was a child, isn’t it four storeys?”
Draco was almost hopping with excitement as he spotted the thick, brown padded envelope waiting for him a little way from the mat, as if it had slid across the floor. Draco reminded himself he needed to move his owl delivery box to the more suitable window point when he had the time.
who she was talking to? Malfoy however, seemed strangely content with her response and instead walked over to a corner desk, partially hidden from view by a large, leaning filing cabinet.
“No,” Harry tried not to pull a face, “It was the one about using magical creature skeletons to create objects of power or act as curse vessels. I remember it had a chapter in it about those wizards who made wands out of thestral bones and only certain people could see them.”
Harry was about to comment on how Malfoy might even get Hermione for his healer when the other man stood up, shaking off the offending trousers. He hobbled over to the mirror before peeling down the back of his boxers so as to inspect the already purpling bruise.
“The charm is stuck,” Draco murmured, reaching out to hover his palm a few centimetres away from the bricks.
missing out on the first week back of school to go watch
“What kind of underwear?” Draco continued. “I just want to get the full picture of your undeniable sartorial elegance right in my mind.”
Marlene’s mouth dropped open as Draco sent her a chilling smile before he and Harry side stepped past the unhappy looking couple and continued down the street.
The weekend passed far too quickly with Draco staying inside his flat. The weather had turned positively chilly, only around twelve degrees and he steadfastly refused to acknowledge such lunacy at the beginning of July. British summers were always a total roulette and Draco cold only assume that the moment he stepped back into his dingy Ministry basement the sun would blast out from behind the clouds and the thermometers would rocket up to the high twenties.
“No,” Harry replied, “no, you, no, it’s good you’re showing your knees.”
Harry snorted, “I think you’re right in that there might actually be more chance of me befriending Draco Malfoy before Ginny finally settles down.” He trailed off however as he saw Luna’s frown of confusion.
“Yeah, course,” Ron nodded but still looked slightly uncomfortable. “I mean, I haven’t seen what you’ve seen, so my last recollections of Malfoy aren’t exactly favourable but I trust your judgment. If you say he’s alright now, then he’s alright.”
“Nah,” Ron shook his head confidently, “those beheadings are
“I,” Draco paused, he was indeed looking for Birdwhistle’s new tome on the role of isopsephy in curse creation. “How do you know about that? I would have thought the last book you read was at school.”
“Is Potter hurt?” Malfoy muttered, edging slightly further out of the corridor.
Picklemarsh, she had to work with him on a report once.”
“Wait a minute,” Odette frowned, “Harry Potter, star auror and general heartthrob hunk of the Ministry,”
“Thought you were being the sensible one advocating for time and space and all that?”
? Draco desperately tried to remember if he ever did anything particularly out of the ordinary.
“Sir,” Harry paused, “is Draco Malfoy continuing to work whilst under investigation?”
Harry grinned as he slid down the side of the bath to sit beside the other man.
“How often do I…” Harry trailed off looking confused, “like food? I mean, I never use the kitchen.”
“Better keep me inside all to yourself then,” Harry agreed readily, his tongue darting out to lave small kitten licks against the notches of the top of Draco’s spine.
“Oh,” Malfoy sniffed, before seeming to collect himself and shaking his head. “Don’t start again Mags.”
what even are these pajamas? Something from the Victorian era? How many bloody buttons are there?”
“You’re real,” Draco whispered quietly, unwrapping his dessert.
“Well maybe you should have packed your things last night instead of taking Hugo to the fireworks,” Draco hummed smugly, picking up his gardening basket and walking back into the house.
Movement out of the corner of his eye made Draco jerk his head up. Surely no one could punch through his reinforced wards, not even the almighty saviour? He relaxed as he realized it was a rent-an-owl depositing something in the letter box. The tawny messenger pressed its foot against the side of the box which promptly spat out a mouse flavored pellet.
“Oh stop,” Draco sighed, “that sounds like a line from Lilac Close, which having watched my memories, I’m sure you’re depressingly familiar with. The truth is we hadn’t talked since school before this and I wasn’t exactly pleasant to you then. You were assigned a case as an auror and you did your job. I was just...” Draco forced himself to look up at Harry. “I was horribly embarrassed. You have a history of witnessing me at inopportune moments, often during my lowest points.”
“It’s
eh? Maybe you should offer to go back to hers and take a closer look at her fern if you know what I mean.”
that really get into neo-alchemical theory.”
“Sorry,” Harry said sheepishly. “I just want to make sure you’re enjoying yourself.”
“For Circe’s sakes,” Malfoy hissed. “I
“Vain tosser,” Ron shook his head as Malfoy cast a mirror charm and fussed over his hair. Harry noticed the other man rearranging some of the strands at the front to cover the areas that were thinning. It felt like an awkward moment to witness. It was clear that Malfoy put great emphasis on how others viewed him and he would probably hate to be seen in moments of weakness like this.
“Not too much Mags,” Draco shrugged ruefully, “So I was thinking quick style cassoulet tonight? I’ve got all the ingredients.”
“Oh fuck,” Harry groaned, threading his fingers through Draco’s hair. “That feels nice.”
“Anything?” Draco raised a pale eyebrow in clear interest.
“Hilarious, you wanker,” Harry pulled a face, “if you must know it’s more of a Nimbus 3000 sort of deal.”
“This,” Harry felt himself flounder, “this sausage is not cooked,” he half shouted the last bit of information in Percy’s face, brandishing his hot dog as evidence before turning on his heels and stalking over to where Hermione was retying Rose’s unruly hair up with a scrunchie.
“I was on the opposite side to him in a war that happened,” Draco swallowed thickly, the wine suddenly feeling sticky.
Draco smiled, feeling very pleased with himself, a part of him was strangely smug that he got to keep Harry to himself for a bit longer.
“How thoughtful of you,” Draco bit out. He could feel his armpits growing damp and he was itching to cast a drying spell before the silk got stained but he did not want to do so in front of Marlene. God, how had Draco even ever considered her a semi friend? It was pathetic.
“Wait, Malfoy…” Harry whispered, stepping forwards as his heart fell in realisation.
As soon as Malfoy got home he disappeared into the bathroom, turning the silver knobs of his shower and pulling off his shirt. Harry quickly drew out his wand and went to fast forward before something stopped him. His heart caught in his chest as he watched Draco pull off his shirt, exposing a pale expanse of chest with criss-crossed pearled lines.
“You’re real and you like me,” Draco murmured, smiling to himself as he stuff his face full of chocolatey goodness.
“You could at least try to smarten yourself up a bit,” Winshaw hissed across at Malfoy, whose hands were rigidly gripping the sides of the desk. “Wash your shirt occasionally yeah?” Winshaw chuckled, pointing to a tomato stain that Malfoy had evidently missed on his left sleeve. Winshaw left a moment later to join his girlfriend as Malfoy let out a strangled exhale before scrambling to use his wand on the offending stain.
“That part isn’t important,” Draco snapped before shooting Odette an apologetic look.
“You know full well those shops won’t serve me,” Malfoy snarled angrily, a red flush had appeared on his cheeks. Behind him, a couple of other customers laughed under their breath.
“I suppose Potter could have just walked into any professional quidditch team he wanted,” Malfoy sighed as the bubbles began to melt and slid down the sharp line of his nose.
Malfoy drew out a small blue tube from his pocket, popping off the lid before bringing it up to mouth. Harry realised it was lip balm, which Malfoy slowly spread across his lips before rubbing them together until they were pink from the pressure.
Harry laughed as he followed Draco through the door, the shop’s bell jangling over head.
Harry gasped as he recollected a memory from Second Year. Hannah Abbot had brought her French horn to breakfast in order to show her friends that she had mastered Au claire de la lune. The performance had been a little wobbly but the assembled Hufflepuffs had clapped all the same. Harry remembered that Malfoy had sneered and said something about how useless playing an instrument was and couldn’t Hannah have devoted her time to attempting a passable grade in Potions? At the time, Harry had been fuming, trying to hold Neville back from slapping the condescending smirk off of the platinum blond’s face.
“Okay,” Magalie replied, moving over to sit down on the bed and fixing Draco with an enquiring look.
The pub was busy, as was expected for a Friday night in the summer and an extension charm had allowed the main seating area to spread out into a perfectly manicured beer garden. It was still bathed in the warm glow of the sun and there were multicoloured hanging baskets suspended in the air, attracting the attentions of plump bumblebees and the odd butterfly.
“But it’s Argentina versus Japan!” Teddy cried, dissolving into arguing again.
Harry crept closer to the desk so as to try and catch a glimpse of what was causing Malfoy to pull a face like he was sucking on a lemon. He leant carefully over a bony shoulder, watching distractedly as long pale fingers gripped a dark green quill.
“It’s tie dye and still has stains on from where Teddy threw up on me when he was a baby,” Harry replied, relishing how amused Draco looked.
“I bet,” Malfoy huffed, “Potter could have waltzed up to McGonagall aged eighteen and announced he wanted to become the new advanced potions professor and she would have rolled out the red carpet.”
“Absolutely not!” Draco protested. “I’ve already drafted my resignation letter for first thing Monday morning and have sent out feelers for a research position in Patagonia.”
birthday party? Although I shouldn’t be surprised that a selfless saviour like you would spend it worrying over other people.”
“Finally, a suspicious package,” Ron announced cheerfully as Malfoy rooted through his briefcase and extracted a Tupperware clearly containing a sandwich. Harry gently snorted a laugh before leaning back to look round the rest of the offices.
“Merlin save us,” Draco muttered, “Potter would need a two month spread alone for his –“
“Absolutely not!” Draco protested but the damage had been done and his new found friends were already giggling and elbowing each other.
?” she snapped her fingers as the rest of the table decided to go with her answer.
“Marlene,” Draco nodded coldly. Harry smiled as the blond threaded their fingers together and Marlene’s eyes followed the movement, widening when she realised the other hand belonged to Harry Potter.
“We don’t have to,” Harry shook his head, “I know it’s a bit weird, but I spent all this time with her but never got to actually say anything.”
shouldn’t be discussing a case with a civilian, especially as he knew Malfoy would probably die of embarrassment if Harry was spreading it around that he had been arrested.
“There you are!” Harry exclaimed as he made his way around a ceramic tub full of tickling Thyme.
“Edith Piaf,” Draco said smugly.
“Touché,” Harry sighed with a smile.
“Does Hermione know this is happening?” Harry asked with an amused eyebrow raise.
“Picklemarsh’s desk, four o’ clock,” Marlene sniffed. “Der frühe Vogel fängt den Wurm.”
“Oh that’s what my teenage nephew is always saying,” Odette snorted. “’
“No,” Ron replied carefully, “you should finish your section on the Streatham report so we can make the department meeting in time.”
“Tosser,” Harry grinned, “um to be honest, just baggy boxers, last night’s were grey with a hole in the left leg.”
Draco glared at Malene before taking another pointed bite of the pastry, licking the icing from his lip. Marlene pulled a disgusted face before turning to stride back over to her side of the office. On her way, however, a furious looking eagle owl sped past her ear, causing Marlene to let out an almighty screech and careen into the nearest filing cabinet.
“Good morning,” Draco replied softly, still slightly dazed that he had Harry Potter in his bed.
As was usual of Saturdays, Malfoy had taken a trip to the quieter northern end of Diagon. Whilst everyone knew the infamous alleyway that marked the start of wizarding London, there were in fact many other streets and squares branching off of it, along with a few, small but really rather pleasant parks.
“Yes, well they suggested you two could do that whilst they track down Mario Bianchi,” Pewterfoot rolled his eyes.
Harry wondered if that was because it was the only thing you could usually see from under the robes.
“Oh for heaven’s sakes Harry, bugger off and go find him,” Hermione snapped, causing everyone in the circle to stare at her wide eyed.
garden?
“Oh!” Hermione perked up. “There’s actually a name for that. You know how Stockholm Syndrome is when you start to sympathize with your captors. Well there’s something similar for people who spend a long time under a memory dive, they think they’re forging a connection with the person whose memories it is, oh what’s the damn name?” she clicked her fingers frustratedly.
“He’s,” Harry began before sighing, not quite sure how to sum up what he had seen over the last week. Malfoy was so achingly similar to the boy he had known at school in some ways and yet in others it was like a totally different person.
can buy her drinks then!” Seamus grinned before ambling over to the bar. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits that evening and much was being made of Olivia Sheerwickle’s recent transfer to Puddlemere United. Sadly, Ginny was absent so was unable to give her professional opinion.
Ron was right, any alcohol left in your system had been shown to have quite a nasty effect when combined with memory vials and there had been cases of wizards and witches drowning in their own pensieves whilst intoxicated.
“If I could have everybody’s attention?” an older witch was standing on a chair in the middle of the beer garden, a pile of clipboards levitating beside her. “It is time for the monthly quiz.”
Malfoy nibbled silently on his homemade focaccia, picking up a small bit of black olive that had fallen onto his desk and popping it in the waste bin. Harry was getting a little lonely without hearing Malfoy speak as much. The other man still muttered frequently to himself but full blown conversations had been rather lacking recently as a new shipment of charms hadn’t yet arrived from Paris.
“I’m glad it sounds more heroic than it was,” Harry laughed with a wince as he stood up and gingerly stretched out his muscles. He had probably been working out a little too much recently but one of the perks of working for the Ministry was access to a fully equipped, state of the art gym.
“Oh I see,” Luna pursed her lips thoughtfully before beginning to pick out each blue sprinkle individually and depositing it on Harry’s ice cream. “That makes sense, you always did listen to him very carefully.”
Draco sighed as he ran his fingertip across the messily scribed ink. He flinched a moment later as Marlene appeared from round the corner.
Instead, Draco distracted himself by rummaging through his drawers for the baby blue swim shorts he knew he had somewhere.
“Um,” Harry took another bite of ice cream to try and stall the blush on his cheeks.
“Get away you insatiable beast!” Draco smacked at Harry’s chest, but he was laughing. “I’m serious, if we’re late for the port key and I don’t get my nice tan before Ginevra’s wedding I’ll have your balls.”
Harry gasped as Draco’s thumb brushed a flat brown nipple. Draco supposed it was a sound of approval as he moved his hand even lower, tracing down abdominal muscles.
Ronald looks so sad watching it, but it looks like he is trying to maintain his pride.
Your Masters only glance your way, however as they continue their game. You sit with your back proudly straight and your legs spread for an hour and your behind starts to get sore. You don't know if you can ask to move, so you grit your teeth and bare it through card game after card game, all of which are interspersed with the type of conversation typical of those who'd been together a long time. You listen carefully, to get a better understanding of your Masters. It seems that Draco will be the harder of the two, and Harry will be a softie. The two are obviously very in love.
"Master Draco and Master Harry."
He was also using humiliating language, which is something Harry rarely did toward Draco, though he had heard Ted use it sometimes to Amy. "You are a sick little pansy boy, aren't you?" the Dom asked.
"It just seemed like fun," Draco said.
Harry grabbed the handle of the hairbrush harder and struck her several times in quick succession. Her pink ass began to almost glow with redness and she squealed. But Harry didn't stop as he used more brute force to create harder and harder smacks. Finally he heard her cry out and saw tears leaking out of her eyes. "STand up," he ordered. His eyes were on Draco, taking a wallop of his own from Ted. Carly stood on shaking legs and trying to get her tears under control.
"I do. But I prefer a belt or my hand."
"Master Draco, that is up to you," you say. "I'm here to submit to you and what you want and if it is too much, I will use my safeword."
Draco shrugged, unconcerned.
"What's that?"
Harry screamed as he came, ramming his cock as far down Blaise's throat as it would go, as Blaise swallowed down every last drop of come.
"I want you to bend over the arm of the couch," Harry said, patting the arms slightly.
"Master Harry, Master Draco, I am sure you two will be great. Those beautiful cocks look like they know just how to pleasure anyone--man or woman--perfectly."
"I can see that." Draco had come in with two bottles of wine, showed them silently to Harry and Blaise, who chose one, which Draco opened and poured into goblets for them. Once they were served, Draco put a smaller amount on his plate and with only a glass of water sat down to eat.
"Harry, that's up to you."
"Girl!" Draco calls. "Clean up time!"
Before you know it, Hermiones legs are clamped around your head, you can feel her pussy quivering, and she is rocking back and forth shouting, "Yes! Yes, Girl!" before slowing down and evening out her breathing.
You hate bathroom humiliation. When you and The Masters were discussing what you were willing to do, you'd mentioned that pee play was only to be used as punishment for a grave misdeed. Fucking Ronald was indeed a grave misdeed and you know you've earned your punishment of having your toileting controlled. Still you don't love to be watched pissing, so you duck behind a tree and squat down to release your piss and neither Master followed to watch.
"Harry," Draco wheedled. "You've said so yourself that my skin is soft. This is just as much for me as it is for you."
"Our Girl is waiting for you in the parlor."
"Yes Master Draco," you say.
WEEKEND ONE
You hesitate and stare as Ronald starts to stroke his cock. Your hand moves to your pussy automatically and you finger your clit a little bit. You bite your lip. You know you shouldn't do this, but my God he is magnificent and you can't stand the thought of his hand on his own cock, when you want it to be your hand. Finally you nod your head at him and he closes the space between the two of you and kisses you deeply.
The next morning when Harry awoke, Draco was dry humping the bed. His lack of orgasm had led him to sleep humping the mattress. He was moaning and murmuring in his sleep. "Draco," Harry shook him awake.
At the same time, Harry and Draco also answer "Yes."
They usher you into the house, happy to see you. You can see nervousness in their faces, and you are aware it's on your face as well. After all, you had years with your prior dom, and he knew just how rough you liked him to be (VERY rough), and you didn't really know what to expect from Harry and Draco. Of course, your meetings had covered it all, from your safeword ("Lemondrop") to your absolute no-no's (visible bruising anywhere but the buttocks, nothing that will make you bleed, and a few things that you prefer to wait until later to do when you know each other better, such as anal sex and piss play), to what it is you like (being ordered to do chores, forced nakedness, displaying, humiliating language....among many MANY other things).
Harry sighed. "Draco, I'm too tired to deal with this tonight. Go to sleep and we'll continue your punishment tomorrow."
Immediately the Dom stopped. "I don't have to pee on you."
"Come to the bed, Draco," Harry said.
"Very good," Master Draco says.
"Yes sirs," Draco nodded. He was already palming his dick anxiously.
"Yes sir," Draco said, looking mildly disappointing.
"Finally," Draco says. "We are going to use humiliation this weekend."
"Bitch, when we tell you to go in your diaper, we mean it." He turns the hose on you and cleans your private areas. The cold water is a shock, but it does feel rather nice on your badly bruised ass. "You've earned yourself more diaper time and we're going to make it count."
"I get that," Harry said. Whenever they got together with Ron and Hermione, he and Draco also had to pretend to be vanilla. Neither one would ever understand.
"I suppose."
Harry patted his cheek, "That's my good pet. You do something naughty and you must pay the price."
"You understand you will be spanked every time you do not use our full titles?"
"You're nothing and your Dom is everything!"
Draco lay on his back and Harry took his wand, touching it to the top of the chastity belt. It loosened, and Harry pulled it down swiftly. Within a second, Draco's cock went from flaccid to erect and dripping. Harry looked at it reverently.
Draco nodded, but he still looked anxious. Harry added, "Why don't you go whip up some breakfast, and we'll decide what to do today before we leave for Madame Kat's."
Draco was silent.
The rest of the day flies by in a blur, there is lunch and you are ordered to clean up afterward. Harry and Draco are sorting through boxes of things that an old Aunt of Draco's left him when she died a few weeks earlier. They use you to throw rubbish away and when you aren't doing that, they have you sitting on Harry's office chair, your legs spread wide and slung over the arms of the chair. Mostly they ignore you unless they need something.
It wasn't even your behavior, but you know full well there will be a day when you will act up. You've been on good behavior because you're still new to your Masters' house and their rules. But once you are comfortable, you know you will be a brat, and you will sometimes do it on purpose. You wonder if that's what Ronald was doing to Hermione this week.
"You've done a good job with him, Harry," Blaise said as Draco opened the boxes of Thai food and began serving them on plates. He did a quick warming spell on each plate before placing it in front of Harry and Blaise.
Ronald nods. "Perhaps tonight," he says. "Hermione is coming home tomorrow morning."
Draco got there as fast as he could.
"Yes Master Harry," you say.
"Yes Master," you say. "It was very intense, thank you for that."
After dinner the Masters bring two hard wooden chairs to the middle of the room, facing each other only a couple feel apart. Draco works on tying you to the chair, one ankle tied to each leg so that your legs are spread. Your hands are brought behind you and tied together and you are tied at the mid-section with the ropes making a criss-cross through your tits. It makes your already large breasts appear even bigger and you do your best to stick them out proudly. You love your G-cups and you don't care how slutty it makes you look to have them so prominently displayed. You are given a gag so you can't even talk. "Clear your throat if you need your safeword," Draco says.
Both Amy and Draco stood in front of their doms, arms behind their backs waiting for their punishment.
"You're in charge," Draco said. "I want you to really be in charge."
"Not when I agree to it."
"My Masters, Ma'am."
"Let's see," Master Draco drawls, "That's twice you've forgotten to say my name properly and once you didn't fold clothes properly. Do you think this is why we got a sub? So we could be disrespected and have our house a mess?"
"Are you sorry, or are you just upset you're getting spanked some more? Are you just upset that you aren't being allowed to come?"
Draco gasped, "You're going to leave it on me until tomorrow night?"
Harry looked at her, "It's Master Harry."
"First is that we have some tough punishments planned for you. Use your safeword if you need to." He pauses, "But! That is the only speaking you'll be allowed to do. You aren't allowed to talk. Understood?"
"God, you love giving head, you dirty Girl."
"But....hitting? Isn't that abuse?"
Draco lets your chin go and orders you, "Go to the kitchen and make dinner."
“You’re beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.” His voice echoes in the hallway, and Draco smiles at him, eyebrows flying up, cherry lipstick sticky and beautiful. She’s so disheveled, she’s probably a mess, and Harry is pretty sure he’s a mess too. He feels it, the sweat under his t-shirt; he probably stinks, but he’s tipsy and lightheaded, and there’s a specific kind of light in her eyes that says so much and so little at the same time, that Harry just knows. He knows he loves this woman, and he wants her. And maybe Draco wants him too.
He feels warm and loved. He knows it’s not real, but it fills him with such hope. He can’t see Harry. He can’t face him. Harry deserves nice things, sunny, warm things. And Draco has no idea how to offer him that.
It has always made Harry sigh.
“I will tell you what would be fun,” he tries and Draco smiles dirtily at him, all ears. “You will suck my cock and then I will fuck you against the countertop...” Harry counters hotly, feeling his whole body shake with the idea, a deep sensual need pooling between his legs, canting his hips against Draco’s, pulling the shirt off his arms.
He’s wearing one of Harry’s old Gryffindor t-shirts — it’s a bit big on him, falling off one slender shoulder.
“You sound
Has he blocked their private chat?
He tried though, not only avoiding it but—before that—pretending he didn’t feel it. Even though it had been nagging inside his rib cage like an agonising beast, huge like a whole unknown continent inside him.
to live, at least long enough to try.
The man shrugs and takes a sip of his tea.
“I’m not going anywhere, Harry.” Draco promises.
“Have you seen, Draco?” he asks Ginny.
“What?”
“I love you, Pads,” he says in a hurry. He needs the words out there in the open, while Sirius is still here to listen.
“Yeah... yeah, I’ll go to bed now,” he says, not moving.
“Shut up, Sirius.”
Later that day, he writes a long email to Draco, adding a photo of the showcase with the little dragons, telling him everything about the plot of the book and the characters.
Something in his chest inflates and deflates. Energy and frustration leaving his body.
But he doesn’t feel like messaging back right now. He’s in the middle of a thought, and the thought feels impossibly large, like being on the verge of something else, something beautiful, something huge. Maybe he will get to write it down...
The man from the back of the room stands and walks into the circle, sitting on one of the empty chairs. He looks old, old like Draco’s parents. He is all long limbs and woolen cardigan, like a character from an old novel. Draco can picture him sitting on an armchair, reading a book, sipping on a cup of tea with a tabby cat on his lap by the window.
so good
He feels suddenly sad about it. So he speaks up.
“Draco,” he calls, and it goes Draco, Draco, Draco. In the silence of his own room, in the darkness of his own house, in the emptiness of his own self. And he craves and whines and comes, comes, comes in his hand, with only Draco’s lovely face carved like a mirage on his closed eyelids.
Harry shrugs. Oh, if his auror mates could see how he acts around Draco when he’s unsure of himself... Nothing like badass Auror Potter and more like a little, insecure teenager.
“Fair enough,” there’s spite in Draco’s voice.
prompt: red bird
Draco’s art gallery is receiving all kinds of critiques. Good ones, bad ones. His mood is going up and down and he even started smoking again. Drumming his fingers anxiously over all flat surfaces, making Harry feel bad everytime Draco proposes something different in the sex department to get some steam off.
Remus watches him, looking pained.
“No. You only press the issue until I say yes, normally.”
“Oh, no.” With her thin lips, she looks conflicted. Her tailored light blue suit match her earrings, and her manicured hands take the tea cup with care. Swift moves, as they were thought once upon a time, in a lifetime Sirius feels so detached from.
“I thought, what if it was all but a dream?” Harry whispers, his voice secretive and small. “Sometimes,” he explains, bringing their chests together, skin on skin, warm and delicious and making them shiver as he rubs his lips against Draco’s jaw. “Sometimes I still think it’s all a dream, and that you will disappear if I close my eyes for too long,” Harry whispers, looking up at Draco, and Draco holds his hips, firm and real.
“You wanted to open the relationship.” Harry mentions, uncertain, taking a sip of beer. “I’m not sure how it will go, how much of it I will manage well or not, but we can try.”
Draco is the one who moves, because Harry is hypnotised, mesmerised, paralised. She moves like a belly dancer as always, caging Harry against the wall, long limbs against Harry’s body and it's hot, hot, hot and so hard to breathe.

He can feel Draco is also scared. It goes both ways. They are standing together in this boat with a deep hole in it. It might sink or it might not.
“Pansy told me you haven’t really left the house lately, so I thought we could have a walk in the park,” he says shrugging.
“Can we fix it?” Draco asks in a broken voice.
Draco is sharp and witty, his sarcastic humour is a blessing, he is quick on his feet and even quicker with his tongue.  He is the only one that actually makes Harry feel like he’s just that, just Harry.
Sirius's eyes go cold and steely: he is all of a sudden very still, and it’s rather scary to see him like this.
“Harry, is that you?” Sirius's voice invades the kitchen.
“Draco,” he says, voice deep and serious. “You are going to live, kid, and you will love and be loved. Hear this, pup: you will be happy and I’ll make sure to be there every step of the way. Be it with Harry or without, you are not going to be alone. Never in your life, until you are old and wrinkled. Because you have family and good friends. Mark my words, Draco.”
But his mind also supplied him with the extra charge of negativity: Draco has more sexual desire than you, Draco is self-confident and could have any guy he wanted, Draco is better looking and much more experienced, anyone would love being with Draco.
Draco sighed.
He holds his breath and reads:
“We already talked about it,” he says defeatedly.
“I will think about it. Thanks for today, Theo.”
Sirius is wearing his pyjama pants and a battered band t-shirt again, this time with the logo of X-Japan. The collar is worn and stretched, showing Sirius’s bony, white left clavicle. There’s a shock of colour against his pale skin, a bruise. No, a
“Yes, it was,” he concedes. He wants her to get to the point so he can leave. “Is this about my mother?”
“Have I changed so much that you are still searching for proof that I’m up to something?”
he moves his hips back, taking Draco further in, until there’s no more to take. “It burns so good, Draco,” he hisses and shakes under Draco’s hands and around his cock. “It feels
They share a moment of silence, just looking at each other. They’ve been through so much over the years. And in the pregnant silence of the kitchen, it feels real. The fear of the last few weeks, the reality of Moony in the ITU—the fear of losing him for good this time.
“And stop looking at me like that!” he adds, angrily.
He arrives home a bit earlier, looking forward to a long shower, a cuppa and maybe convincing Draco into getting take away from the Thai restaurant down the street and watching something stupid in the telly.
“Fuck, Narcissa.” He smiles brightly at her. “Sounds like we will need to get over our past, dear cousin.”
“Fuck, Harry!” and now Draco sounds mad. “We’re smoking jellyweed, is what we’re doing.”
Harry has no time to compose himself further because someone knocks on the door and opens it abruptly. Pansy Parkinson stares at him for a quick second and sighs, walking into the bathroom and closing the door after herself.
He feels stupid.
Much love your way, my darlings! x tai.
“Instead of telling the story, you’ve been a right twat to us all week long and acting like a hormonal teenager, so I am doing the adult thing here and telling Harry.”
Draco knows exactly how it feels. This man telling them his story could be Draco revisiting that first month.
Remus rushes inside the LGBT centre and sits in the back of the meeting room. He is running late, the session has already started and there’s a young blond man with high cheekbones speaking.
In the sorrowful hours of dusk, Draco was the one who stayed awake chatting with him while Remus was in the hospital and Sirius paced the house like an empty shell.
He can’t exactly explain how it started, it was maybe a year back. Draco wanted to explore a few fantasies, one or two kinks. Nothing too much. Harry rather liked it. If he thinks back, he can still see Draco with fishnet stockings on and high heels; Christ but wasn’t his husband sexy as fuck in a black thong? He always gets hot and bothered with the memory.
“You watch me a lot,” Draco says, putting on his coat.
”; it was all tumbling down. Then Draco would go on whining about how he really, really wanted to try it out. Or how Harry should give it a go, or how they should go pick up someone together because it was so fun to share other men with Harry.
“Shut up,” Harry snorts and shakes his head. “He is not, we sent pictures to one another... He’s quite dashing, actually.”
“Of course, Remus,” Rolf assures him.
“Go have a good night out with your friends, let yourself live a little. Not to sound like Padfoot, but what if this bloke never comes around? Will you forever be waiting? Don’t you want to get a wee bit drunk and snog someone for a change and give yourself a break?”
He opens his eyes and sees his husband avidly listening to him with a serious expression.
And after three fingers in, Draco rolls the condom on his hard, leaking cock and lines up, body moving forward to cover Harry's, his swollen lips against the nape of Harry’s neck, hotly, whispering sweet nonsense mixed with perverted fantasy. And slowly, he pushes in.
“That’s great news, love.”
“You look lovely,” Harry says softly, dropping a soft kiss on his cheek.
Warning: Pansy takes no bullshit.
So Harry watches, dumbfounded, by the kitchen door as Draco helps Molly with the roast chicken, and asks her about the right amount of spices. How he mumbles about house-elves never letting him help cook when he lived at the Manor, or how his mother doesn’t even know how to fix tea by herself.
He smiles, watching Sirius standing on the other side of the room, with a big grin on his face as he talks to someone Draco doesn’t know. He watches his second cousin with his messy man bun, his jaw shadowed by a fashionable stubble, wearing a stupid Christmas sweater that says
wishing you all a very fluffy christmas! <3
How long has it been? How many times has he thought he would never do this again with someone he loves? He licks and kisses Harry’s hole, the soft curls of dark hair against his tongue feels dreamlike, surreal. He licks and kisses and tongues at his entrance, not delving in, just teasing.
All the anger he’s been bottling up comes to the surface and he’s sure Draco can see it in his eyes.
It was way more than what he bargained for.
Her lips tremble again and a tear slides down her right cheek as she nods and dries it with the napkin.
He wouldn’t do this to him, would he?
It was not supposed to be like this, like every other week. It was supposed to be once in a while, but apparently Draco didn’t notice any of his signs, the way he kept excusing himself or asking if they could just tune it down a bit.
A shaky laugh escapes Harry’s mouth, and he is already giving into the desire he isn’t sure will visit again anytime soon. He turns in Draco’s arms and instinct kicks in. Grabbing Draco by the hair, crashing their mouths together, tasting his own sweat on Draco’s tongue, hips pushing and teasing in tandem. He trails a wet hand to Draco’s arse over thick fabric and moves him even closer, making him moan against his lips, fingers messing Harry’s hair, thrusting against each other in a delicious mess of sweat and saliva and heat.
I dedicate this fic to the ones long lost and the ones who survived. Mainly to Caio (
Draco takes a deep breath, body shivering with an arousal that makes him ache deep inside his bones, and heat that pools down his navel and makes him grow harder. He licks Harry’s cleft, needy and hungry and a kind of debauched joy burns him inside out.
“I think I will live,” he answers, and laughs a bit at it. “I think
“‘Morning, Harry,” Draco says, extending a hand to him, inviting him closer.
And Harry lets himself be calmed down. Lets the emotions wash through him and out of him like he used to do when he was a kid.
Remus keeps talking rushedly and Sirius is talking too, and Harry just wants it to stop hurting so much.
Remus continues with a tight smile, a pained one.
“What’s wrong with you?” the blond asked.
“How?”
He goes back to the party. He will let Draco know that he cannot deal with bringing someone home tonight. He hopes they will still be able to enjoy the rest of the celebration with their friends.
I grew very attached to this universe, to the feeling of community and support I tried to portray here. As I’m a huge fan of Wolfstar, I’m looking forward to writing a little bit more about Sirius and Remus’s back story. AND a bit more about other characters (as Rolf, Pansy, Mr. Dumbledore, Blaise and Theo), and more Drarry scenes. So I created
“I didn’t realise,” Draco says, dumbfounded.
And the truth is right there, in front of everyone’s eyes to see. In front of all these strangers that share the same condition.
It reads:
He is hard inside his pyjama trousers. He is not wearing pants and the slight friction of the soft fabric against his hot skin is making this so sensual.
There’s a moment of silence. And Harry feels his limbs tightening, just like before a fight or a duel, anticipation working on his muscles, his stomach going terribly cold.
Draco's secret. (or: in which we want to hug Draco)
Mr. Dumbledore touches his shoulder softly and Remus shoulders shakes with a sob, but now he is suddenly laughing, brightly and big, and Rolf is patting Remus’s thigh with a soft, knowing smile.
He wanted to control his own reactions and interactions and heartbeats.
With that, she clears her throat, presses a hand over her dress to compose herself and looks at him coldly.
And Harry suspects he will stay.
It’s crazy to see how much everything has changed, not only around him, but inside of him.
He shrugs his auror robes and hangs it on the back of a chair before walking into the living room to a very chatty Draco leaning animatedly over the floo.
Harry watches him—Sirius always talks about that in this rich, sarcastic way. Harry is pretty sure deep down it had been awful, terrifying even. Though the story leads to Sirius going to live with Harry’s dad and his parents at the tender age of 17.
He loves the way Draco thumps his fingers against any surface, anxious, ready, waiting.
They watch the telly in silence. Sirius pets him and fills his mug with tea, then later with hot chocolate. But at some point Harry starts feeling agitated, as if the numbness is gone and a restlessness is overtaking him.
And Harry was so bad at establishing limits. It was pretty bad, because he knew Draco would keep nagging him, and he would end up giving in.
So he decided to take up running again.
Both men turn to him, still laughing and then Draco smiles.
The computer pings; a chat bubble appears on the screen.
There’s a tin of biscuits on the small table by his bed, but he doesn’t feel hungry. He feels like he could smoke a cigarette, but he doesn’t want to face the rain outside and he really doesn't want to make the fire alarm go off like last week. It was such a bother...
“I am so sorry I hurt you so much.”
Right now, he just wants to make this all stop and bring Draco home alone. Debauch his posh pointy face, fuck his mouth, grabbing him by the hair.
At any point if he needed.
It feels like poison: it leaks from his mouth and looms over him in a dark cloud. But he cannot stop the floodgates once it starts and it feels like a tsunami of emotions is going to drown him in a sea of suffocating darkness.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s jaw works. He swallows and stares at his hands, looking terribly pained.
He honestly wants to run for the hills.
(See the end of the chapter for
Looking at him is painful,
But Harry knows his own case is not just a fever. Even when he is trying his best not to feel like this. He’s sure the feeling burns like fever and turns into ribbons of yearning intertwined so intricately around the arteries of his heart and the roots of his bowels in beautiful patterns, just like the ones he watched Draco braid in Luna’s hair.
So he watches, as Parkinson luxuriates under the sun in an old-fashioned polka dot bikini and huge sunglasses, resting her head on Ron’s chest, passing him a can of Muggle beer. And how Ron laughs as Ginny runs around and jumps on Dean, getting him all wet and cold. How Luna is lying on her belly, elbows propping her up while reading a thick book about whatever it is she is interested now.
The silence is no longer uncomfortable. It feels like it creates a tiny delicate bridge between them, a sliver of a possibility of reconnection.
Looking around, as if gathering his surroundings, Draco seems to realise what is going on and he starts shaking his head, trying to control his laughter.
Harry laughs weakly at that.
I can do for him. But it’s not for you.”
Draco turns, looking like a painting under the sunlight, with his hair forming a golden halo around his head, his eyes dancing with joy and a bright smile on his pink lips.
The email is from yesterday, though. 8pm. He was at Luna’s before going out.

is a cosy bookshop in a quiet street. The inside is crammed with bookshelves and old sofas and armchairs, and a small stage-like setting close to the big showcase window. They normally hold book launches here, as well as authors’ nights, talk shows, the weekend storytelling activities for children and teens, craft workshops every Thursday afternoon, the book club on Fridays and the
He’s sitting on top of a high branch on a tall tree. Harry doesn’t remember why he ended up there, but it’s summer and the heat is suffocating and Ron or Ginny dared him. So here he is, while everyone else is on the ground over the picnic blanket by the thin stream close to the Burrow.
He is delighted to see his friend being so supportive. She is quietly talking to Rolf by the food table and the way Rolf is smiling at her, honest and open, makes him question a few things—he will need to ask Pansy about that, about the way the man slid one solid finger very gently over the side of her thigh, over the bruises Draco knows are lying underneath her woollen trousers.
“I want to suck you off right here, Harry...”
And Remus laughs properly, openly, his voice vibrating through the room, and he motions at Draco to stand up.
The image in front of his eyes makes Harry feel warm all over, a strong wave of affection and tenderness unfolds inside his chest like a rainbow and washes him with boiling gentleness.
Taste the changes in life and the absurdity of feelings.
“Yes. So I took my rightful time to mull it over. I don’t know what she wants or what she needs, but I finally agreed.”
“And I know that once we finish this meeting, he will be waiting for me just outside, with his beautiful long hair and his stupid motorcycle and his battered leather jacket and a ridiculous innuendo on the tip of his tongue...” He smiles at Draco.

“I am Harry’s surprise?” Draco asks, feeling a bit lost, looking from one to the other, as the couple leads him to the car.
Harry couldn’t take it. He felt used, and small, and not good enough. He started retorting everything Draco was saying.
Draco is glorious, glorious, glorious.
And Draco, sweet, sensitive, gentle Draco, welcomed Harry’s shame, sheltered Harry’s fears with a barricade of understanding. He made Harry feel normal and accepted, like any other kid would have been dealing with such huge conflicts. He made Harry feel seen and embraced and cared.
Because, looking closely, they’re just sharing a smoke and laughing. But Harry... Well, Harry got this all wrong.
And he will never have what they do.
And then Cho talks.
But then, suddenly, he looks very serious, and makes Draco notice some traits that are very familiar because they are just so very
They feel warm and soft and Harry wants to discover all the small parts of Draco that he watched so intently, and all the other bits he couldn’t watch properly. He’s done watching. He wants to touch now, to explore with his fingers and hands and all the limbs of his body.
They laugh at something. Luna is now talking to someone else, he thinks it’s Ginny but he does not look to check.
“Though, you know,” Remus says, a naughty smirk forming on his lips. “He keeps nagging me about how much he dreams of tasting my cum and how it bloody saddens him that he will never know.”
And from then on she stays, stays, stays. And all is bright, bright, bright.
His friends are very supportive, but they don’t know what it is to be queer, or to have someone you love dealing with serious health issues every time their immune system gets weak.
You lick a long stripe from the vagina and up to the clitoris, letting your tongue circle it. Her sex tastes amazing - -it's been awhile since you've had another woman. Hermione makes little gasping noises as you move your tongue around, letting it dip as deep as possible into her wet center and pulling it out slowly and pressing it against her clit. She is thrusting on your face, her juices getting all around your mouth and nose, but you don't care. You are gobbling her up and making her moan and you love it. You wish someone was touching your pussy.
He grabbed Draco's hair and began fucking his face, thrusting his dick in and out of that pert little mouth of Draco's with the pouty pink lips. He wanted Draco to know that he was dominating him. "Just like that, you submissive little cocksucker," he said, wondering where that voice was coming from. "Keep sucking me."
You arrive at your Masters' house after leaving work on Friday evening. It was a long week at work, and you are looking forward to shedding your corporate boss persona and being used and abused at your Masters' hands. Every time you thought about the weekend whilst at work, you couldn't help but feel an anxious yearning between your legs.

"I don't know, " you answer, you're cringing now because the rice is really digging into your knees. "I will try harder in the future, Master Harry. For you too Master Draco, I promise I will never stop trying. I'm very sorry."
"Do whatever you want with her," Harry says.
Draco and Harry look at each other, shaking their heads a little bit. "This is going to be your issue, isn't it?" Harry asks. "You're here twenty minutes and you already get punished for two reasons? Coming without permission and forgetting to use your Master's full name?"
"I never thought I'd think Draco would do anything to deserve it, but maybe he does."
You stand, the tears still flowing from your eyes and traveling down your cheeks. It's been a long time since you've had a pain this bad from subbing, not since your final disappointment to your last Dom.
"I know it does, but I think it could really work!" Draco said. "I want to be a better person, but being selfish and spoiled is so ingrained in me, I don't know if I can change. And being soft and allowing people to walk all over you is so ingrained in you. It cold help us both!"
Harry nearly choked on the sip of brandy he'd just taken. "You're out of your mind, Draco. You aren't getting that much money to spend on face cream."
Draco had gone to jelly and could barely prop himself up on his elbows on the desk anymore, his legs shaking so bad. And still Harry continued to thrust, and he didn't stop until his own cock had gone completely soft. He pulled out of Draco and watched as his come seeped out of Draco's loosened and used asshole and ran down his leg. Draco was so relaxed, so flooded with oxytocin that he didn't even care as the wet slick come dripped down his leg and hit the floor.
"Draco," he said patiently. "Blaise coming to town is a special occasion. All you had to do was ask and I would have given you extra money to enjoy going out with him."
The smell of the bread baking awakens your Masters and they come down the stairs within ten minutes of you pissing yourself. Draco looks at you and beams, "Oh, it looks like our little slut couldn't help herself and pissed her diaper like a baby."
You wonder miserably what that diaper play could involve. You finish your breakfast and suck the cocks of your masters before they allow you to brush your teeth and your hair.
Draco gasped, "One!" he said.
"Gladly," Draco said and dropped to his knees before Harry. Harry's dick hadn't been touched yet, but it was already half hard, and with just a few cursory wanks from Draco, it was fully erect in no time at all. Draco looked like he was in heaven as he opened his mouth and took Harry's cock in his mouth. He used his tongue, working its way up and down Harry's shaft and swirling it around the head.
"He's got some things to confess," Blaise said.
Draco's legs shook as he struggled to keep his hips on the bed, all the while, Blaise straddled Draco's face and placed his already-hard cock in Draco's open and waiting mouth. "Mmmph," Draco said around the giant phallus of his best friend. Blaise thrust his hips, his dick sliding in and out of Draco's eager little mouth, his pink lips stretched around the girth.
With each confession, Harry brought his hand across her backside. Even after her confessions ended, he continued to spank. He was so horny now, and he knew the sub could feel his hard cock pressing into her belly. Her ass was softer than Draco, who was so skinny and lean. The palm of his hand hurt but he kept hitting and hitting. Between smacks he started running his finger between her legs. Her pussy was dripping wet.
Draco looked at their list of rules. "Read them out loud," Harry ordered.
Blaise had figured out the game. Everytime he'd say something dirty to Draco, Draco would instinctively start rutting at the air and Harry would bring the switch across Draco's thighs. It was a delicious little game, and Blaise didn't mind using his huskiest voice to say to Draco, "This is what you're best at, sucking my cock while your husband punishes you," or "You've been such a naughty little bitch, Draco. You deserve everything you've gotten," or "If you were my sub, I wouldn't go as easy on you has Harry. It'd be nothing but blowjobs for me while you would sit in your little chastity belt all day every day." Each time, Draco would let a whine in the back of his throat go and his hips would buck and Harry'd bring down the switch.
"And you deserve every inch of punishment."
"Draco," Harry said sternly. "You're going to suck Blaise off now, and if you move your hips, you'll get punished."
You do as she asks, and within seconds, Hermione is straddling your face and you are eating her pussy. You remember what the Masters said to you, that Hermione has a strong libido and comes several times daily. Not only that, but she is very easy to bring to orgasm.
Blaise conjured up his clothes and took his leave, promising to return the following night.
"We both have some work to do," Draco said. "We're going to set you up in our office while we finish."
It took him hours to fill out the entire length of parchment and by the time he was done, it was time for him to make and serve lunch. Harry hung the parchment on the wall of the living room, to serve as a reminder to Draco what happens when he goes out of line.
Starting with light little taps, the riding crop is used on your exposed pussy. The light taps aren't bad at all, in fact your clit rather likes the delicious little sting it takes every time the crop comes down on it. You hear Ronald moaning and you look past Draco and see that Harry is using a riding crop on Ronald's balls. It makes you cringe. "Focus on me," Draco says, bringing the riding crop down harder on your cunt, causing you to gasp deep in your throat. Draco continues to punish your aching pussy with increasingly stronger smacks from the riding crop and soon the tears runnign down your face are matched by Ronald's. Once you begin to cry, Draco turns the riding crop onto your breasts. And they are a big target. Even the harder whacks on the tits don't hurt as bad as the ones on the pussy did, but you realize whenever he hits the nipple, he's hitting just a bit harder and that hurts a lot.
"Come Ronald," Hermione says, as she throws his clothes to him.
"I don't think I can stop," Draco said, gasping.
"But not the rest of this weekend."
"Yes Sir," Draco said. He got out of the bed and made his way to the door. He was still wearing only the chastity device and Harry could see bruising on his backside from his punishments yesterday.
Blow after blow and you start to consider your safeword. Afterall, you'll need to sit in your office chair tomorrow. At that moment, whoever is paddling you must have the same realization, because the paddling is done.
Harry licked his lips. "I want you to watch Blaise suck me off."
Harry helped Draco sit on the couch.
"Is there anything else you'd like to say?"
"Draco," Blaise said. "Have you learned your lesson?"
"About fifteen minutes."
When Harry arrived home from work one night, Draco told him, "I got an owl from Blaise."
At your old Dom's house, he had a cage at the end of the bed. Actually, he had several cages because he had a string of Subs who came and went and often you had weekends that you shared with other Subs.
Draco was so good at this. When they had first gotten together Harry was impressed at how Draco could deep-throat like that. It was something he himself struggled with, though not for a lack of trying. Draco relaxed his jaw and went all the way down on Harry, until his nose was buried in Harry's dark pubic hair. Harry could feel the head of his cock making contact with the back of Draco's throat and when Draco moaned it sent a delicious vibration through Harry's cock and right into his balls and the rest of his body.
The remainder of this weekend will have to wait until next chapter!
He knew Draco really hated doing lines, so that was definitely on the table. As soon as they finished eating breakfast, Harry got a roll of parchment, which was four feet long, and ordered Draco to fill it with lines. He was to write out rules number five ("Draco gets a personal allowance for personal items and is not permitted to go over that monthly allowance) and number seven ("Draco is to respect Harry's ultimate authority in the household and willingly submit to any disciplinary acts that Harry deems necessary.)
It takes you a while. At one point Master Draco walks in and demands a drink of water. You get it for him, then he watches you get back to scrubbing the floor. "I love to see you from this angle," he says. You're on your hands and knees, your back to him with your ass in his direction. Your legs are a bit apart, and you know he can see a peek of your pussy from between your legs.
Harry pulled him into a hug. "Good boy. Now go to the bathroom. There's a salve you can use on your bottom to help with the welts, and then come back here and we'll decide together how to tackle the closet."
Harry let go with a smack across her butt. "What kind of attitude?" Another smack.
"Brilliant," Hermione says. "Now where is this sub I've heard so much about?"
"Do you deserve this?" the Doms would ask, after he told them about fucking Amy.
"Now," Draco said "Get in the Parlor. We have something set up for you."
"Did we learn our lessons?" Madame Kat asked.
"Good little subs don't have to wear diapers," Harry reminded you. You nod in understanding. "Go outside with Draco and he will hose you down."
"Yes Draco?"
You nod again. You understand that and you love being a dirty slut for your Masters. You love sucking their cocks and taking pain from the riding crop for them. Nothing gives you pleasure like being humiliated for them.
