Luckily Dumbledore started talking again, “Thank you Beauxbatons for that marvelous introduction. I trust that Madame Maxime has explained it to you?”
Ginny snuck into the astronomy tower and was met with something (and somebody) beautiful. There were lights hanging from the ceiling. Two chairs and a table were in the middle of the room. There was food and drinks on the table. In one of the chairs sat Luna.
Ginny held her breath and waited for an answer. She hoped with all she had her mum would agree to let her.
“I just wanted to tell you that there is someone else I like. I’m sorry. I just figured you’d want to know. I also think the letters you sent were beautiful, but I just can’t return the feelings,” Ginny tried to let the secret admirer down gently. She didn’t know if it had worked though.
Fleur Delacour, the part veela, also entered on the third day. Ginny felt the same veela pull she had felt days before when Fleur entered the room. When Fleur entered her name, the reaction was the opposite of Diggory’s. Almost all the boys started cheering and almost none of the girls did.
Ginny found an owl by her window when she got back to her dorm. It was one she’d seen only once before, the owl that had brought her the love letter. She’d nearly forgotten about it after everything that had happened. Sure enough, the owl was holding a letter. She opened the parchment and read the contents.
A whole bunch of girls were whispering about Fleur. Ginny barely noticed, as she was too busy staring at the veela. She was transfixed by the other girl’s beauty. Fleur’s movement’s were graceful and gorgeous. It wasn’t until Fleur had completely left the room that Ginny broke out of her trance. She glanced at Luna who also looked as though she had just woken up. No, it couldn’t be. Luna wasn’t… no. She wasn’t. I’d never be that lucky.
The next day during Potion’s Harry was late again. When he arrived Professor Whitlock gave him a detention and he sat down.
Ginny sat down in her seat. When the chocolate trolley came along she politely refused. It wasn’t that she didn’t like candy, she just didn’t have any spare money to buy it with.
“If you don’t take action about your crush you will drive yourself mad liking them until they reject you or date you. And you wouldn’t want to spend anymore depressing Valentine’s Days with me would you?” Pansy continued.
“That would be great! Umm I’m pretty sure it’s almost two so I should probably get going. Where should we meet? My brother’s have told me all about Hogsmead so I know my way around pretty well.”
“Don’t play dumb with me. I see the way you look at me in the halls, how you blush when I talk. Your sick! You have to be cured!”
Due to the fact Harry was a bit hopeless when it came to Potions and Draco had always been pretty great at potions, they’d been matched together.
“It’s ok, I’ve dropped my books loads of times, I’m sure one more drop won’t hurt,” Luna said calmly.
In her worries about trying out for Quidditch she had almost forgotten about the Quidditch World Cup. And they were bringing Harry! Ginny had long since gotten over her pathetic schoolgirl crush. Thinking back on it made her blush in embarrassing, but Harry was a nice person to talk to. She hoped they could be friends, and that maybe she could mean more to him than just
“Yeah.” Ginny agreed awkwardly. The entire conversation was becoming rather awkward and she supposed that agreeing would end it the quickest. Both girls turned their attention back to the Headmaster, who was preparing to announce the next contestant. The fire had already burst out and Professor Dumbledore had the piece of paper in his hand.
Ginny decided that she needed to talk to Harry Potter. She didn’t know why, but he seemed to be the only person she could talk to. She had a feeling that he’d either understand or have advice. She also felt that he probably wanted to talk somebody about the Triwizard Tournament. It had been a couple days since he’d been chosen and it was now common news that Ron -her own brother- had stopped talking to the golden boy himself. Nobody knew why, and rumors were spreading like wildfire. Ginny was ashamed of her brother, and felt bad for Harry. So she decided to talk to him.
“I doubt anyone will pay much attention to us. Personally, I don’t care who knows. I’m out to my dad and he doesn’t care. But I know that you aren’t out. As long as we don’t do anything really romantic nobody will notice.”
Hey! I’ve finished the first 12 chapters for this fic, and there should be around 30 in all. I’ll be posting the first five today, and if they get some attention I’ll post the rest very soon. If not, I’ll be posting one chapter every day until I’ve caught up with what I’ve written so far. Reviews and kudos are suuuper appreciated! Especially reviews like “when are you updating!?” Or “update already!” Since those are super motivational. Eventually I’ll start updating weekly, but for now, enjoy!
Despite being heavily exhausting, Ginny had a hard time falling asleep. Maybe it was everything she had realized or maybe she was worried, but either way Ginny had a hard and restless night.
“Good.” She stands up and walks right over to where I’m laying. “I’ve got to get going now but there’s one more thing I must do.”
“To some, Amortentia will smell like something you either love or reminds you of love. For instance, if your parents work as gardeners you may smell plants. For others it will smell like someone you love. Most of the time you won’t smell a simple crush, but you may smell the person you like if it’s a particularly strong crush. To be honest, I’m not sure exactly how it works. I’ve been rambling. Basically, it smells like something or someone you love. Today, you will be brewing Amortentia. You will have two days, today and tomorrow to brew this potion. Know that it is absolutely prohibited to pocket any of this potion and even more forbidden to use it on another student.”
It was very early when Ginny woke up. Well, she didn’t really wake up per-se, she just got tired of laying in bed and decided that 5 am was an appropriate time to get up. She hadn’t gotten much rest after the nightmare. She drifted in and out of sleep for hours before she decided to ditch the idea of sleep altogether. Her headache was still painful and she felt awful but she managed to get dressed and walk down to the great hall. It was a Sunday so she didn’t have classes. Thank goodness. She piled some eggs onto her plate and ate sleepily. There were only a few other students eating, since it was so early. There were two girls sitting at the Ravenclaw table. They looked to be first years and to be friends. There was one boy sitting alone at the Hufflepuff table. He looked older. Probably fifth or sixth. She surveyed the Slytherin table and to her surprise she saw Draco Malfoy. He wasn’t eating, just sitting there, looking anxious. She felt a but of pity before remembering all the times he had called her family blood traitors and she couldn’t forget how awful he was to Hermione. She quickly looked away. Ginny seemed to be the only one sitting at the Gryffindor table. Huh. Ginny sighed. She knew what she had to do. Confront Luna and apologize for the day before. Hopefully Luna wouldn’t be mad. That was the main concern. But the dream kept playing in her head. She could still head her mother’s voice.
Everyone cheered. A group of people went to calm the dragon while the minister ushered Harry to fly down. He was mostly unhurt, other than some scratches. Nonetheless, he was still taken to the medical tent while the other contestants fought their dragons. The next was Fleur, and then Cedric, and then Krum. At the end of the contest, Krum and Harry were tied for first, though Karkaroff had scored Harry pretty unfairly.
Luna woke up. She was sweating and her heart raced. She quietly walked to the bathroom and doused her face in cold water. She locked the door and looked at herself in the mirror. She could still hear the voices chanting in her head.
Ginny sighed. She wanted- needed -someone to talk to about all this. She wondered if maybe Harry could relate.
Okay, deep breaths, she told herself. She took a deep breath and let it out. In, and out. In, and out. It’ll be okay.
My bad for being MIA for a bit. My excuse is a terrible one: I was possessed by an idea for another story and devoted all my time to it to get it out of my system and only have a 50K-ish-word Nick Jr. fanfiction to show for it. BUT the story is out for judgement and out of my head, so I can get back to transferring and editing Teddy from of my Drive and onto AO3 :D
"Oh yes, it is," she said conversationally. "Were you unsure? It's been an awfully long time since I've seen you here. I suspect forgetting which table is which is to be expected."
Heat scorches his face, and Harry hugs Teddy closer. “We-well, yeah, he refuses to eat some, and...and he hides anytime he knows we’re going somewhere.”
Draco's face split into a huge smile, and Harry leaned forward to kiss him. Their lips were pulled too tight in their smiles to kiss properly, but it didn't matter. Nothing really mattered in that moment. It was surreal, Harry and Draco crouching in the midnight shadow of Mr. Weasley's shed outside of Ron and Hermione's wedding reception, sliding bands onto the other's finger. It may not have ever been what Harry had expected or imagined, but it was everything he could have ever wanted.
The bar Ron picks out is more modern, a tiny thing hidden away on the far east side of the city that one of the other trainees has mentioned more than once. Hermione lights up at the Salem theme, finds it fascinating.
It became a blur of twisting hands and thrusting hips, teeth clinking between distracted kisses as the heat grew between them, concentrating deep in Harry's groin as he felt his climax drawing closer.
"You ought to go back up to the castle and get some sleep," Aberforth told Harry when he finished the last of his glass and slammed it onto the bar. It was just him and Aberforth, the Three Broomsticks being a much more popular Friday night choice for drinks.
When Andromeda and Teddy first stepped through the manor’s doors with their unending luggage, they completely altered Malfoy Manor. Decades of layered stiffness and stillness shattered, replaced by the Tonks’ joy and life and bountiful hope. Without ever trying, Teddy transformed the manor, transformed Draco, and Draco craves that light to be back in his life for good.
But Harry could only shake his head as Draco removed his dress robes, pushing them to the floor and working next on his undershirt. Harry made to catch up, but he couldn't seem to find the clasps on Draco's front while concentrating on their kiss, only managing to get his fingers lost in the fabric.
Draco hasn’t replied, but his chewing can be heard in the evening hush. When several seconds pass, though, Harry looks over, fully expecting that condescending squint, smug insults on the top of his tongue, ready for deployment the moment he swallows.
Among the chaos of intoxicated guests, Harry led Draco by the hand through the crowd in search of Mrs. Weasley.
"I already have them." She pulled out a small vial filled with green. "It should only take a minute or two to do this properly."
Heat filled Harry's cheeks, though he wasn't sure if it was caused by Draco hearing that Harry had told Hermione about his feelings for him or if Harry was just thinking about the morning they had shared.
“The point I’m making, Harry,” Mr. Cook sighs, “is that you are only halfway through the extensive and strenuous program. You are more often at the Ministry than at home right now, and when you are home you are likely exhausted. This will only make caring for a child that much more challenging.”
Madam Pomfrey eyed him sadly. "Mr. Potter and his friends found you in the corridor adjacent your common room. You had been attacked by another group of students. But thankfully, Mr. Weasley contacted myself and the headmistress as fast as he did, and you were able to be tended to and those half-wits could be dealt with proper by McGonagall." She pursed her lips, suddenly looking severe. "Does this sort of encounter happen often, Mr. Malfoy?"
Draco turned and found himself being surrounded by Josh and his three friends, the scene all too familiar as Josh drew his wand.
Potter laughs, and the sound lacks much of its former malice. Since the remembrance ceremonies, it’s been undeniable that the tensions are...not waning, exactly, but changing. The initial week following their new resolve was a horrible ballet on eggshells. Draco still cringes when he thinks on the eerily high-pitched voices he and Potter used in their first attempts to be kind; even Teddy knew something was off, eyed them warily during each exchange.
Torn between not wanting to see more of Malfoy and curiosity over what could possibly be making such a sound, Harry hesitates at the door for far too many moments before finally wrapping his hand around the door knob and carefully cracking it open.
"Oh, Harry, it's really quite obvious if you know anything at all about love." Luna's smile brightened at Harry's silence, as though he had somehow given her the perfect response. She hooked her arm in his and began to drag him down the corridor. "Come, let's go to dinner. You shouldn't skip too many meals, you know."
“Malfoy?” Ms. Dribble asks sharply, popping just her head back into the living room. “What’s this about a Malfoy?”
Harry hadn't seen Draco the rest of the day. He hadn't been at lunch, dinner, the library, or anywhere else Harry could think to look for him, leaving Harry with nothing but haunting thoughts and a runaway imagination that kept making Harry lose Draco over and over again. The worst of it was when Harry sat picking at his dinner, eyes on the Slytherin table, when he realized that it had been roughly 24 hours since he and Draco had lost their virginities together.
"What?" Harry shook his head and began busying himself with his own vial. "No, he cleaned most of it up already."
Halloween had always been such an exciting time for Harry. This year felt different for more than one reason, namely the cost the previous year had on his general happiness, but this was also the first Halloween that Harry knew it was the anniversary of his parents' murders. Perhaps seventeen years of never knowing this fact had something to do with it, but Harry didn't feel particularly sad over it. As it had been his entire life, Halloween was just another day. In a way, he was grateful for it. It made it easier to think about them.
Merlin, why was Potter here, trying to relive one of Draco's most troubling memories with him? The anger from before simmered in his stomach, though all it managed to do was make him feel ill. He closed his eyes and cradled his head in his hands, elbows propped on the ledge. He rubbed his hands up and down his face several times, then into his hair as he straightened. He wasn't going to stand there and let Potter do this to him. Potter might be the poster boy for the wizarding world, but Draco didn't deserve this kind of polite reminiscence of war times. It was too close to something friends would do. He turned and made for the staircase, nearly making it to the first stair when Potter spoke.
As Draco approached Harry, slowing as he drew closer, he sensed rather than saw several different people or groups standing up in alarm. They likely thought he was about to attack Harry, especially when Draco grabbed him roughly by the shoulders and ripped him from his seat.
The quiet that filled the kitchen was palpable. Draco stood there, wet front growing cold, not knowing in the slightest what to say. There were no words he could find quickly to comfort his mother as she made a final attempt to reach out to him. Nothing she said was wrong. Nothing she said was something he could dispute. Yet Draco longed for her to know that he could never blame her.
Harry’s chest caves in minutely. There’s pressure pushing outward in the cavity of his ribcage, and the air feels thicker for how hard it suddenly is to take in. He shifts to sit up straighter.
Somewhat refreshed, Harry stands by the door with his back to Teddy for another few minutes, until the sounds of general upset are mostly faded and he can hear his name being tentatively whispered. Teddy’s face is pale but for around his eyes, dry and a little bloodshot, and Harry’s heart melts at the sight. But with so much happening, he hasn’t the time to snuggle Teddy as much as he needs. Instead, with a soft voice and gentle hand around Teddy’s, Harry leads the toddler back into the house to deliver a quick apology to Fleur, who then takes Teddy by the other hand to find a seat in the garden. With about fifteen minutes left, Harry jogs up the staircases back to Ron’s room.
As Kingsley makes his way through the opening speech, Harry tries his best to both keep an eye on Teddy at his feet and look incredibly solemn yet attentive toward the stage. Although there are no flashes, camera clicks litter the quiet of the audience, the light applause as Kingsley steps away to make room for the first speaker.
His mother could have caused a scene when Harry asked Draco to come along to the store; instead, she had remained quiet and given Draco a small but clear smile.
“Park!” Teddy squeals, jumping down to run a couple laps around his room. Harry lets the sight fill him up, smile only faltering when he turns, catches sight of Draco in the doorway, looking irritated.
Harry fights the urge to roll his eyes. Sure, the three-year Auror training program has proved to be far more difficult than he anticipated. He spends a third of his day in physical training alone, not to mention the bookwork and reading required. It’s overall felt like returning to Hogwarts in a never-ending state of pre-exam frenzy. When he makes it home a little after four o’clock each day, he does tend to collapse onto the couch and not move for hours.
"Or it might be that he was scared of committing to you and this was just a good excuse to pull away a bit," she said cautiously.
"Oh, no you don't!" Hermione cried, and Harry looked up to see Hermione, Neville, and Luna all had turned their wands on the sixth years, faces set. They were technically outnumbered, but the older students had a reputation that easily tipped the scales. Josh and his friends froze, eyeing the wands warily.
Harry laughed, allowing Draco to pull him by the arm onto his feet. "I bet I can get half our year to attest to the fact that you did, in fact, swagger."
He didn’t have to ask twice. Draco was on him in a heartbeat, their lips crashing together as they did in the garden earlier that night. Harry pushed the other boy back until he was lying on his back on the couch, Harry bracing his body over top. He bit Draco’s lip, his neck, his collarbone with bruising force.
“I have my own,” said Draco with a shrug. Harry could see the lines of tension in his body, though, and clearly Pansy could, too. She put a calming hand on his arm. Harry tried to ignore the flare of jealousy in his stomach as Draco leaned into her touch.
A pang went through him at the thought of Tonks – usually thoughts like these led to Lupin, which led to Sirius. He did his best to squash the feelings before they overwhelmed him.
Pomfrey insisted on giving Harry one finally check up, which he sat through with an air of annoyance. He really just wanted to leave the Hospital Wing, knew Draco and Blaise and Pansy were waiting for him.
“Nothing,” he said evenly, although privately he was shocked. Shocked, mostly, to think that he had spent seven years in classes with the group of people before him and had not an inkling of what any of them were interested in. “What about you, Zabini?”
I hope you understand me some more now, not that there is much to understand. Your ideas of me are quite likely accurate.
“Then what?” Harry asked. “I can’t see them wanting to speak to you, either way,” he said honestly. Draco reached out to tug on Harry’s arm, pulling him back down to the bed.
Harry tried not to think of his nightmare, but the more he tried the more it rose to the forefront of his mind. At this point in his life, he was used to nightmares; to waking up shaking and in terror. They had been especially terrible directly following the war and again his first couple nights at Hogwarts, but the previous nights’ had been his worst yet.
There was the combination of grumbles and explanations of glee around the table, which made Harry snort. Slytherins were a testy bunch, honestly.
“It looks like almost everyone is here,” said Professor Stone cheerfully after a moment. The chatter in the hallway quieted. “Before I let you in, I’d like to go over some ground rules.”
“But we know that doesn’t work!” Harry burst out. He felt anger rising, but tried to tamp it down. The last thing he needed was to explode again. “It’s happened time and time again through history – all suppression like that does is start more wars.”
Did you know there were Slytherins who fought in the battle? Of course you didn’t – but it should be obvious. Children fought against their own parents. And all I could do was hide like a coward.
“The look that tells me I should start insulting you before you get a big head,” Draco said. Harry could hear his grin through his words.
Harry couldn’t help it – he made a face. The thought of Binns teaching his first years, especially Mar, gave him a weird feeling. “Is that everything?” He asked, before the Headmistress could say anything about the face he made. She looked like she wanted to.
He stood close to Draco, their shoulders brushing, as their classmates stepped through the floo. Pansy Parkinson was on Draco’s other side, looking studiously grim and aggressively avoiding eye contact with Harry. Dean and Seamus and Neville had come through, had said their hellos to Harry, but were now standing on the opposite side of the room chatting with Ernie MacMillan and Justin Finch-Fletchy. According to Parkinson, Goyle had decided last minute to attend Durmstrang instead.
Harry let out a strangled groan as Draco removed his fingers and replaced them with something much larger. The rhythm was perfect, Draco pressed Harry hard against the wall of the shower with his body, his hand stroking Harry’s cock in time with his thrusts.
“There’s a team of people,” he responded, hoping that was all he needed to say, but she just raised an eyebrow at him to continue. Harry sighed. “Well there’s me, of course. Professor McGonagall, Professor Strickland, one squib who works in muggle liaison for the Ministry of Magic and one wizard who works in the muggle government’s wizard liaison office. And Draco.”
“Not everyone can afford a tutor,” Pansy said, looking at him levelly. “And some parents don’t have the time to teach from home themselves.”
“I felt left behind,” he said, finally. “When you and Ron went to Australia. I know I could have come-” he added, when she opened her mouth indignantly, “but I couldn’t have, really. Andy needed help with Teddy and I needed…to feel stable, I guess. I didn’t realize it was so hard for you. You always seemed to be having such a good time.”
“Okay,” a couple voices chorused back, and then there was silence – or mostly silence – as they all set quill to paper.
“Yes,” Blaise said almost immediately, his look dark. Harry locked eyes with him for a moment – he wasn’t sure when he had begun silently communicating with Blaise, but it was clear the other boy knew exactly what he was talking about. Both Pansy and Draco shook their heads, however.
The sorting passed quickly – there were fewer students this year than any other year. Blaise, who had actually been watching the sorting, pointed out that Gryffindor hadn’t even been given a single new student, while somehow Slytherin had half the incoming first years.
“Don’t you usually fish for fish?” Harry asked with a sigh. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know the answer.
“Want to deal with it yourself, do you?” he asked, as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “Ready to chase down a
Harry swung Teddy up and into his arms. “Let’s go, Teds. If we spend much more time out here Andy will throw a fit.”
“It looks like almost everyone is here,” said Professor Stone cheerfully after a moment. The chatter in the hallway quieted. “Before I let you in, I’d like to go over some ground rules.”
Blaise ushered Harry and Pansy out of the door, making them swear they would retell every moment when they were all at dinner. Pansy and Harry walked in silence, at first, which Harry didn’t mind. He imagined Pansy was working out what she would say, and he was always content to be left with his thoughts in the Days After.
She paused a moment, as if to consider. She was tapping her fingers rapidly against her leg as she thought, and it made Harry’s chest feel tight – as though he should be running or moving or doing
“Is this okay?” Draco asked gently. Harry nodded, not trusting his words, but trusting Draco. Knowing he could get his hands out if he really wanted to.
He did his best to change the topic. “I think Andromeda is bringing Teddy this weekend,” he said. “For the whole weekend.”
I grew up experiencing cognitive dissonance at Hogwarts. Not an excuse, no – I say this only to be able to describe when the cognitive dissonance stopped. It was not in my seventh year of Hogwarts because the only thing I understood then was that the Carrow’s tortured for the sake of pain. It had nothing to do with ideals or beliefs, so I could separate it from my beliefs. Muggles were lesser, but the Carrow’s didn’t care about that. They just wanted to cause harm, and that was undoubtedly evil.
around, who was there to bind the wounds of the first year Slytherins? You think the Carrows didn’t hurt us? They didn’t care about blood status, they cared about torturing children. The teachers stopped turning you lot in for breaking rules, but guess what? There was no one to stop the Carrows finding us doing wrong. Ours was the only Common Room they could get into, or had you forgotten?
The only eighth years who wouldn’t be there, as far as Harry knew, were Ron and Hermione. They had been given permission to arrive the 1
“I’ll be okay,” he said in response. It wasn’t really an answer, wasn’t what Draco was even asking, but it was the best he could give. Draco’s encouraging squeeze of his hand told him that he understood, too.
Both Weasley and Granger had gone quiet, Draco noted with some satisfaction. “That’s right – they don’t know. And they don’t care, either.”
“Sure,” she said. They both stood up, Pansy with a small smile on her lips. “But lets find the other two, first, make sure no one’s resorted to fist-fighting instead of wands.”
So I simply said no, although of course I recognized Harry. I would recognize him anywhere, even then.
“Alright,” Harry said, giving his friend a small smile. “Don’t see much of him, really. McGonagall is much more interesting.”
It took him a moment to locate her. She was the smallest of the bunch, tucked in near the back of the huddle. She looked less nervous than the others, though – more self-assured. She stood up from the bench, too, as he neared, and flipped long, black hair out of her face. In a way, she reminded him of a young Hermione.
Reluctantly, Harry flipped himself off of Draco’s waist and stood slowly. His whole body was burning to touch and be touched.
history, the Voldemorts and the Grindlewalds of the world, rather than the Goblin Rebellions of the tenth century, mistakes that were made in the past would not continue to occur.
“I’ve been thinking,” Draco said suddenly. Harry turned to look at him and raised an eyebrow sleepily. “You look a mess,” Draco said fondly.
“Like hell it didn’t,” Ron snarled angrily. “I’m sure he’s loving the benefits of fucking the Saviour of the Wizarding World – the sooner he does his time the sooner he can fuck off back to his life of luxury and muggle killing, right?”
Not that he minded, really. He struggled with the isolation. It wasn’t so bad now that the castle was full of people, although without Blaise, Pansy, and Potter it would have undoubtedly have been worse – but the summer had been horrible. Even with Potter visiting, the letters and floo calls exchanged with his friends, it had been horribly lonely.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He leaned back on the pillows and closed his eyes for a moment. “How has wizarding society existed for so long without solutions for problems like this?”
“I had to listen to her prattle on about it all the way here,” Blaise groaned, “And she wouldn’t even tell me what it was.”
“You can start being a good influence on Ron, then,” she said, putting her arm around his waist to guide him out. “Imagine the kind of marks you can get now that you’re applying yourself.”
“I’m okay,” Harry repeated again, helplessly. Angry Draco, he could deal with. Controlling Draco he could handle. Demanding and needy Draco was easy. But scared Draco was something he hadn’t encountered yet. A Draco that expressed his need for comfort through softness instead of angry quips and pushing him away was new and Harry wasn’t exactly sure how to handle it.
Harry snorted at that mental image. “Thanks,” he said after a moment of silence. Zabini took his cue, standing up and making his way over to his own bed.
“I think there are more than just us two who feel like this,” Harry said carefully. “We just have to find the rest.”
“Sometimes I am,” she said finally. “But no, not right now. Sometimes I think I never will be, you know?”
The fact was, Harry had found dozens of excuses to visit in the weeks following that night. Sorting library books for Madame Pince, calming Myrle while her bathroom was being repaired, permanently sealing the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. And of course, if he happened to bump into Draco Malfoy, who would complain, really? He couldn’t, however, find any good reasons to stay the night. In fact, it was expressley not allowed. The other problem was that he had time to visit the castle much less than hel iked, simply because Teddy was here and needed him.
When Madame Pomfrey gestured him towards the Floo in the foyer of Saint Mungos, he didn’t hesitate. Except it wasn’t Hogwarts he called for when he stepped in. He was only dimly aware of his words calling “Tonks Cottage” and Madame Pomfrey’s exasperated look before he spun away.
“I don’t stick my nose in other people’s business,” Harry responded mulishly. Minerva just raised an eyebrow at him as if he were a misbehaving first year. It almost made him feel like a misbehaving first year. “What kind of person would I be,” he said after a moment, “if I didn’t speak up for the people who needed it? I have a voice, I have to use it somehow.”
She turned kind eyes on him. “It’ll be alright, Harry. Teddy and I will visit.” She squeezed his shoulder as he moved through the kitchen towards his bedroom.
“I will not,” he sniffed. “Everyone in this room, including Pansy and Potter, has spent all summer trying to
“Here,” Draco whispered in response before dropping to his knees. “Take your tie off,” commanded Draco as he began working on the buttons to Harry’s trousers. Shaking with desire, Harry complied.
“Well, I think this year we’ll talk about some big wizarding history events that happened in the last fifty years. We’ll talk about Grindlewald and Voldemort,” some of the students shuddered at the name, but he chose to ignore it, “and how those wars affected us and the muggles. We’ll also talk about the founding of Hogwarts a little bit. Those are the big things. Some of you will know a lot about these things already,” he cast his gaze across the room, trying to make eye contact with all of his students. All except Mar. “Lots of you won’t. So if you know some stuff already, I want to see you helping the people who don’t, okay?”
“-can’t just walk him out with other people around,” she said as he came to. He felt around for his glasses, accidentally smacking Draco on the nose as he did so. The other boy, who was already awake, huffed out an exasperated “Potter!” before handing Harry his glasses.
Both Weasley and Granger had gone quiet, Draco noted with some satisfaction. “That’s right – they don’t know. And they don’t care, either.”
Hermione said something, maybe, Harry wasn’t sure. He was dimly aware of them getting up and leaving – or were they backing away from him? He couldn’t see anymore, couldn’t feel. The world had gone from grey to white, he was angry like he had never been, not even in the Days Before, not when he had hated the world. The newspaper crunched in his hand and then felt hot, as if it had burst into flames.
When Madame Pomfrey gestured him towards the Floo in the foyer of Saint Mungos, he didn’t hesitate. Except it wasn’t Hogwarts he called for when he stepped in. He was only dimly aware of his words calling “Tonks Cottage” and Madame Pomfrey’s exasperated look before he spun away.
“Awesome,” Jason breathed. They took off towards the exit to the common room, only Jessamine remembering to go tap some of the second years on the shoulders. After the roar of noise as they exited, the common room became strangely quiet. Harry felt more tired than he had been before.
do that, Professor. They all have it out for us, it doesn’t make sense anymore but they do. They didn’t help a single Slytherin last year, not even a first year. Some of them
He was broken from his reverie by a sharp elbow to his ribs, and he looked around wildly, breath coming in gasps. Draco on his other side was engrossed in a whispered conversation with Pansy and didn’t seem to notice his near-breakdown.
“Tell me about your nightmare,” Draco said, and Harry found himself complying as Draco’s hands moved again – across his chest, through his hair, under his chin.
It wasn’t gentle, but nothing between them ever had been. Harry’s teeth found his neck and he was biting and sucking, urged on by Draco’s murmurs and moans. He found Draco’s lips again, hands reluctantly detangling from his hair to unbutton his shirt and pull his robes down off his shoulders. They paused in unspoken agrement, Harry leaning back so Draco could pull his shirt off his head
They walked back as one, until Dracos legs hit Harry’s bed, when they paused. Harry’s fingers trailed across the waistband of Draco’s jeans for a moment and then Draco was dropping onto the bed, pulling Harry down with him and the night disappeared into bliss.
“It’s not a hard assignment,” Draco said, giving Blaise a look as he packed up his stuff. He paused to read from the piece of parchment in front of him. “
“It’s always alright,” she said warmly. A warm Minerva was something Harry was still getting used to. Not that she had ever been cold, per se – just removed, as teachers often were.
Harry ran an almost aggravated, definitely frustrated hand through his hair. “You’re the one who kissed me,” he grumbled.
“No,” she laughed. “It’s just-” She paused for a moment, looked him up and down, setting Harry’s nerves on edge. “You didn’t
“A thinly veiled threat, almost,” Blaise filled in for her. “Unless you all love each other very much,” he said in mimicry of the hat’s voice, “You will all die cold and alone.”
to become a parent to her grandson. And with Harry gone…he tried not to feel guilty, because of course he should have come back to Hogwarts, but he did. If only he could have delayed a couple years, waited until Teddy was older, and then come back; it would be easier on Andy to care for an older child. It could have been possible, too, if he were anyone other than, well, the
“Everything, really,” Harry said after a moment’s pause. “I’ve overseen two detentions so far. We’re updating curriculum-” he cut himself off. He wasn’t supposed to tell anyone this, really – except Draco, and by extension Pansy and Blaise. In fact, McGonagall had given him and Draco express permission to tell the other two, seeing as they were always together anyways.
Harry stood and stretched. Draco was due to arrive soon, and he had been trying to calm his nerves. Truthfully, nothing had happened since that night on the Astronomy Tower. Nothing but talking under the watchful eyes of professors, at any rate. They hadn’t spoken of that night, either. In the Days Before, Harry may have asked.
He still hadn’t told the three Slytherins about it. He was beginning to feel that they might be angry with him for hiding it from them. He wasn’t exactly sure why he hadn’t told them, either. There was no
“Abuse of your power so that we can study?” Pansy asked as Harry made his way back to the table. “I didn’t think you had it in you.”
“I did a lot of reading this summer, too. No one viewed Slytherin as an evil house, not until Voldemort, not really. I mean – Dumbledore was in Gryffindor and he almost helped Grindlewald take over the world, and maybe if he had gone through with that, people would act the same way about Gryffindor. Even the way people talk about Salazar Slytherin or the chamber of secrets, that’s changed in the last fifty or so years, since Voldemort. So maybe you all just became what we made you to be, you know?”
After a couple hours her parents yelled up to her room that they were leaving to get Harry and Hermione. Ginny yelled back goodbye and waited for them to return. After about an hour she heard the door open and she stumbled down the stairs.
“Draco,” Pansy began. “He likes you. He like-likes you. And he must like you a lot for your smell to be in his Amortentia potion.”
“Yeah. I wanted to talk to you, actually that’s why I came here in the first place,” Ginny said hesitantly. He looked so happy and she didn’t want to spoil the mood.
“Merlin, that’s twice in one day,” Draco groused as Zabini vanished the evidence with a flick of his wand.
Harry gave Draco a look. “Some of us can’t even do magic,” he griped. Draco just rolled his eyes back at Harry.
The students began to whisper as he approached them, with all the subtlety that eleven-year-olds possessed. He heard his name whispered and had to fight back a wince. They were children, he couldn’t blame them for the hero worship that he so desperately hated. Even if he
Maybe it was his hero complex – Andromeda had certainly encouraged him to get out of the house; to visit the Weasleys, go flying with Charlie, visit the joke shop, floo Ron and Hermione who were still in Australia. Most of this he did. Most of it, actually, he did with a smiling baby attached to his hip.
“How are you feeling?” Draco murmured in Harry’s ear. He didn’t have to specify, he knew what Draco meant. He could tell his nerves for the upcoming day were coming off him in waves. He was anxious – anxious about classes, trying to learn again as if everything were normal, helping Binns, tea with McGonagall that afternoon – just anxious.
“I’d like to open a school,” he said finally. Pansy raised her eyebrows, which he took as permission to continue. “My godfather left me his old house – I’d like to convert it into some sort of primary school that would take in purebloods, halfbloods, and muggleborns before Hogwarts. They’d learn core subjects from muggle schools, but they’d also learn magical basics – history and culture. That way they’re exposed to all ways of living, I suppose,” he finished, somewhat lamely.
He was sure he had wanted to say more, something about how Ron and Hermione were leaving, how Ginny would barely look at him, and how the quiet at Andromeda’s house could be oppressive. About how every time he looked at Teddy he was filled with love greater than anything he could have ever imagined and grief stronger than a tidal wave. About how he dreamed of having the luxury to have stayed dead. About how different the Days After Harry was than the Days before Harry. About how beautiful Draco looked in the moonlight.
Hermione sat up and scrubbed at her face. For a strange moment, Harry thought she was just going to get up and walk out of the kitchen - away from him. But instead she leaned into his side and let him wrap his arm around her. It reminded him startlingly of camping in the Forest of Dean, just the two of them against the world.
How had it happened that he had been taken under the wing of a group of Slytherins that everyone hated? Why was it that everyone hated them so much? Hating Draco, he understood, maybe. Harry hadn’t been at Hogwarts the previous year – hadn’t seen what had happened, although he had heard stories about Hogwarts under the Carrow’s rule. Students had been forced to hurt and punish other students – until eventually some had taken up residence in the Room of Requirement.
Harry slapped himself mentally for not realizing sooner – for not realizing last night, even. Draco was expressly forbidden from sharing sleeping quarters with other students; and while there was probably nothing technically wrong with him staying the night in Blaise and Harry’s room, there were also too many people itching to see him expelled.
He was going to say something cheeky about being the Chosen One or maybe about how Draco was really the one with the big head, or something embarrassing, like
Ginny gave him a small smile. “They’ve been through a lot, you know. Not that we all haven’t,” she added at his look. “But when they left for Australia so quickly it made me think that they weren’t able to confront their grief. They couldn’t stay here and handle it. So we,” she gestured broadly around the classroom, “Have been confronting our demons all summer. Trying to make sense of everything. They haven’t.”
Draco turned to look at him, grey eyes crinkling at the corners. “No,” he admitted, “but I can see your shadow.”
“Mr Zabini, you’ll be meeting with Professor Vector in an hour. Don’t be late.” At Blaise’s nod of understanding, she swept away from them.
After a beat of silence, Draco sighed. “They’ve been talking about it for ages,” he said gently to Harry. “It was bound to happen.”
“I’ll write a list of topics,” he said finally. “Everyone can pick one. But I’m not giving you answers or helping you do the research.”
“I am teaching it,” he said finally. “But try not to tell anyone, okay? It’s just after once, so you won’t have to keep it secret for long.”
“Must I always clean up your messes, Potter?” he sighed. There was no malice behind it, though, and Harry was able to roll his eyes back before turning around to see Mar grinning ear-to-ear at him. She was bouncing on the balls of her feet, too, but she wasn’t tapping her fingers today.
This chapter is a little short compared to normal i think - but it was either this or leave it excessively long, so i decided to chop it in two. That means next chapter we'll get to see the sorting feast and Pansy and Harry with the Slytherins, and this chapter is 99.9% angst. Yay!
Draco threw a towel at him. “Blaise and Pansy know where we are – they came looking for us last night. You didn’t even move when they came in. Pansy was convinced you were dead.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry asked. He tried not to sound angry, not to sound threatening. He was so tired, so exhausted already – the world was greying around the edges of his vision.
“Yes, it’s all very exciting,” McGonagall said with an almost-Draco-like drawl. It was Harry’s turn to laugh. “Moving along, the Defence position will be filled by Professor Cleomenes, who will also be acting as Head of Gryffindor house in my stead.”
Harry sighed inwardly. “We don’t have houses this year.” He was being deliberately stubborn. He knew what Neville meant, of course. Knew he didn’t mean it in bad faith, not exactly. They were all scared and scarred in their own ways.
“Dare I ask where you discovered this information?” she gave them each a piercing look, but Pansy merely shrugged.
Harry sighed. He could feel Hermione’s eyes boring through the back of his head, refused to turn back, to see the judgement of Mar he knew must be on their faces. He focused on Mar, who was hitting her leg now, with the bottom of her fist. Not hard enough to hurt, but he was worried, a bit.
Before Harry could say anything, he was engulfed in Andromeda’s arms. It felt like home, as it did every time, but the homesickness hit him this time like it hadn’t before – perhaps because of his nightmare the previous night, or because of how he had been feeling all day. He let himself cling on tightly for a moment before pulling away.
“Very well,” said the Healer, somehow making it sound as if speaking to Harry was the biggest inconvenience he could fathom. “There is nothing technically wrong with you,” he said to Harry directly. “It seems as though it is all in your mind.”
“I don’t sound like that,” Harry said, weakly. Hermione glared at him, but she had stopped crying through her angry tirade. “Does it help if I say sorry?” He asked meekly.
“You can,” came a voice from behind him – Pansy’s voice. Draco had come with her, and he pressed the back of his hand against the back of Harry’s hand when they approached.
“You should let Pansy style your hair,” Draco said suddenly. “She’s quite good with hair trimming spells.”
“There are solutions in a lot of other countries,” Pansy finally said. “Wizarding Britain is – I mean, very focussed on blood purity, of course, but classist too. The sacred twenty-eight has the resources and influence but they won’t use it to help half-bloods or poor pure-bloods. It’s something you’re taught not to question. Until you do question it, I suppose.”
He leaned in toward Draco, who shot him a small undecipherable look before putting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Blaise mimed gagging, but Pansy shushed him.
Draco’s hand came up to cup Harry’s cheek and he turned into it, kissing the other boy’s palm. Draco withdrew his hand, leaning down instead to press a slow kiss to Harry’s lips. “You don’t owe the world anything,” Draco said against his mouth. “You didn’t need to stay, you never had to. No one would have been angry if you had…gone on.”
around, who was there to bind the wounds of the first year Slytherins? You think the Carrows didn’t hurt us? They didn’t care about blood status, they cared about torturing children. The teachers stopped turning you lot in for breaking rules, but guess what? There was no one to stop the Carrows finding us doing wrong – or making things up, at any rate. Ours was the only Common Room they could get into, or had you forgotten?
“Yeah,” he said, dully. Harry didn’t particularly want to think about leaving, even if it would become reality tomorrow.
those two could somehow speak Latin. There was a great creaking and the crest split down the middle. It continued splitting to the floor as the wall moved horizontally out until a comfortably wide doorway was formed.
“Don’t you usually fish for fish?” Harry asked with a sigh. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know the answer.
“As much as I would love to hear about your summer,” the Weasel – Weasley, Draco corrected himself – began, his voice full of hostility, “we should just establish that I don’t like any of you and I don’t trust any of you.” Draco felt Weasley’s eyes rest on him. “You’re a Death Eater,” he spat out. Draco looked up in shock, but Weasley had already turned to Pansy. “You tried to give Harry to Voldemort,” and then to Blaise, “And you’re just a self-righteous pure-blooded twat.”
In the Days Before, Harry would have been furious and probably argumentative. His identity had been Gryffindor through and through, moreso because he had
With a frustrated groan, Harry wrapped his legs around Draco’s hips, pulling the other boy against him. Draco let out a keening noise. “So it’s like that, is it, Potter?” he asked breathlessly between kisses. Harry felt himself grow hard, angled his hips upward towards Draco, shuddered at the pressure.
Thankfully the year before had been pretty calm. Sure, Sirius black the killer had been on the loose but he hadn’t caused much harm. Plus, she had overheard Ron and Harry talking about Sirius Black during the summer and judging from the tone of voice they were using, Ron and Harry had gone after and even met the killer. If Ron could survive it, so could she.
Finally, after five days of anticipation and slacking off, the day was here. Today was the day that the winners would be announced, and the whole school was going to find out who had been chosen. Ginny personally hoped it was someone from gryffindor, because of house pride and all that, but honestly she just didn't want a Slytherin representing the school. That’s what she thought as she rose out of bed to go to her Herbology class. She was supposed to wait there until it was time to join the rest of the school to find out who the winners were.
Draco walked into class and surveyed the potions room. He didn’t see Harry anywhere, not that he was looking for him. No, he was just surveying the room for fun, not looking for Harry at all. It was just a coincidence he noticed Harry wasn’t at Potion’s class. He certainly didn’t care where Harry was, he certainly didn’t care about Harry in general and he definitely didn’t have a crush on him.
“Professor Flitwick told everyone today that today is the first day for Hogsmead! I’m pretty sure that the third years meet up with their head of house to go over the rules at... oh yeah, 2:00,” Luna said excitedly. “I’m a fourth year so I don’t have to do the permission stuff but we can meet up somewhere if you’d like.” Her silver eyes were shining.
It didn’t just smell like Harry, though. It also smelled like the Slytherin common room and just seemed comforting.
Ginny wasn’t totally sure what she was talking about, or why she wanted to know whether she had used the spell before. It didn't really matter though, so she dropped the matter.
Ok. I’ll be there. I’m going to wear a mask though, since I don’t want you to hate me. Just forget I ever sent the letters. It was stupid of me to do, anyway. Just forget them.
“Erm… yes. I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t tell anyone though. We’d rather keep it a secret for as long as possible.” Harry glanced at Malfoy nervously.
“Oh um… i don’t know why. Anyway, why did you want to see me in person?” the secret admirer asked, changing the subject.
“I guess I’m just used to everyone crowing me and asking if I’m ok. Yelling that I’m fine is just an instinct now.”
Ginny’s day felt like a blur. She spent the entire class either daydreaming about Luna, doodling, or just outright not paying attention. She scarcely understood what her professor’s were going on about. All she knew was she had gotten an E on her Herbology essay, an O on her astronomy paper, and As for everything else. She wasn’t surprised. She knew she wasn’t an amazing student, not bad, but she was certainly no Hermione Granger. She went to her common room and had barely walked through the door before Seamus came bounding through the picture frame yelling,
“He doesn’t look so happy, I hope he’s okay,” pointed out Luna. She’d just confirmed Ginny’s suspicions.
Ginny woke up and realized she was still in the hallway she had ran away too. She neck was cramped and her back hurt from falling asleep against the wall. She groaned as she remembered the events that had taken place the day before. She wasn’t sure what she was going to do. On one hand she felt very, very, awkward around Luna and also wasn’t sure if she could be around her without freaking out. On the other hand, she adored spending time with Luna and if she was being honest... it felt nice to have a friend. Luna was a great friend. She was great at listening and was just overall a nice person to spend time with. Ginny wasn’t sure if she was ready to lose that. She ended up walking to her dorm and laying under her bead. She thought over all of the details and things she felt for a long time before coming to a decision. She realized a few things.
“Yeah… he’s not as bad as everyone thinks though. He’s actually really great. He also feels really bad about everything he’s said to you guys. He also doesn’t believe in blood purism, by the way. It’s just his parents. He wants to make a formal apology to you and your family but we decided to wait until I came clean about the relationship. Oh and I guess this is my coming out to you as bi? I’ve been so worried about telling everybody about Draco, I guess I forgot to be worried about telling people I like guys along with girls.”
At lunch she worked on her Herbology essay. Then it was time for Care of Magical Creatures with Hagrid. She walked to his hut and pulled out her book. It was a nasty looking book. It was covered in matted fur and looked to have fangs clasping the side. She wondered how she was expected to open the darn thing. Hagrid was waiting by his hut for everyone to arrive.
“It’s ok. I figured as much. May I ask who it is? I won’t tell anyone or make fun of you, I’m just curious.”
Ginny got onto the Hogwarts express and waved goodbye to her mum. It was her third year and yet she still watched a few tears fall from her mum’s face. Every single year she had gone to Hogwarts her mum had cried. Every single year. Last year her mum had almost decided she couldn’t go to Hogwarts. That was fun, she thought bitterly.
Ginny stopped herself. She was rambling again. So much for not making a fool out of myself. Ugh, what was it about this girl? She makes me feel so nervous, but I love spending time with her. It’s like the nervous-y feeling aren’t pleasant but I’m willing to overlook them for... what? Luna? I’m willing to overlook bad feelings for a girl I’ve only known for a week? Ginny asked herself that but she already knew the answer. It was yes. She was always willing to drop everything for just seeing Luna. Maybe she couldn’t admit it to herself yet, but it was true. Whether she liked it or not.
“Of course. I’ve got tons at home.” Ginny didn’t have tons at home but she liked seeing her jacket on Luna. She also didn’t get cold easily. After more arguing, they parted ways and Ginny went back to her dorm. She walked to her room smiling dreamily.
Ginny ushered Harry to the Astronomy tower. It was the most private place she could think of, and it held good memories. It seemed like the best place to (a) talk to Harry about Malfoy and (b) come out to him and tell him about Luna.
“How about we visit the shrieking shack before we leave,” Ginny suggested. Luna agreed, and they set off to the shack.
“One of the curses is the killing curse. It… kills anybody who you cast the curse on,” she explained. The killing curse was probably the most well known curse of the three.
There was only one contestHe looked a lot happier than Crum had. Professor Dumbledore was just about to tell everyone off to bed when the ant left, and the Goblet had just spit out another name.
She crawled into her bed and pulled over the soft, breezy, blanket. It was enchanted to keep her cool in the summer and warm in the winter. All the blankets were.
Honestly, I don’t mind these letters too much. I would like to know who you are though. I won’t tell anyone who you are once I find out. Meet me at the top of the astronomy tower at 8:00. Don’t be more than fifteen minutes late. I’ll be waiting.
“Oh, erm... hi Luna.” Ginny’s cheeks flushed and her heart started pounding. She suddenly became very nervous. She was worried Luna would think she was weird, or creepy, or- bloody heck, has this been what my life has come too? Why am I obsessing over what she thinks of me?  As much as she wanted the nervousness to go away she couldn’t. Her stomach was fluttering and her head was spinning. She hoped that she didn’t look as much of a mess on the outside as she was on the inside. Please let me not make a fool of myself.
Ginny jumped out of the portrait hole and snuck out to the astronomy tower. It had been 7:40 when she’d left the common room. She waited for a little bit while trying to stay quiet. She didn’t want any teachers to catch her sneaking out past curfew.
“But Ginny, I have one condition. If you get a bad enough injury that I have to be owled you have to quit the team, if you even make the team,” lectured her mum.
It was the day of the first task and also the day Ginny would be coming out to Harry. They were both, to say the least, nervous.
Talking with Harry was nice. Ginny was relieved that she had finally done it. Having someone to talk to who also related to what you were experiencing was really nice and really helpful. Harry seemed to really understand it, and for that she was grateful.
The only good thing that came from the boy trying (but failing) to put his name in the goblet was that the rest of the students had found a newfound confidence, and a few more students entered.
The girl looked at her happily. “That sounds great!” The blond slid into the seat next to her. Well, she didn’t really slide. Her movement was more like she was gliding or floating above the air. The girl reminded her of water spirt. Like the kind she had seen in books.
“I agree, he doesn’t look so good. He’s a pro quidditch player though, so I thought he’d be used to the attention.”
Sure, Harry was still ridiculously perfect and annoying, but he wasn’t too bad. They’d sort of become… friends.
I haven’t gotten in any trouble. I don’t think that Ron or Harry has either. The quidditch tryout dates haven’t been announced yet but I will make sure to tell you when I find out! Your gift hasn’t came but I did receive a-
After she ate, Ginny went back to her dorm and worked on homework. She had three essays to finish and also a dream journal to fill out. It took her all of five hours to finish everything except an essay. By that time it was noon. She quickly looked over her essays and then decided to sought out Luna. Ginny first looked in the great hall but could not find Luna. She had no idea where the common room was so she couldn’t search there. She ended up wandering the castle for what seemed like hours.
The study date at the library had been a success! Luna didn’t seem to hate her and they had plans to got to hogsmead. This brought on another onslaught of worries. Not the fact that Luna didn’t hate her, the trip the hogsmead. Ginny had never been to hogsmead before since she was a third year and this was her first year being allowed to go. She had heard her brother’s talk about it before but... Fred and George had a tendency to stretch the truth a bit and Ginny doubted that half the things they said were true.
“A couple days ago you told me you had to go study with Hermione in the library but when i got back to the common room she said she hadn’t planned anything of the sort. Why did you lie?”
The once teeny tiny spiders that were crawling about were now huge. The screaming intensified and Ginny laughed when she saw Ron put his feet on the chair.
How her hair fell gracefully off her head, how her eyes seemed to sparkle when she smiled. Oh, and her smile. It was like sparkling diamonds, she looked so happy. It was an emotion Ginny didn’t see that much.
Ginny hopped through the fat lady’s portrait into the hall. She winced when her bag of books slammed against her leg. Normally she didn’t carry so many books but she was going on a study date with Luna and wasn’t sure what they were going to do exactly...
Alas, we are both destined to spend Valentine’s Day alone and single. It is the saddest of fates, something I never dreamed of, something that would bring shame to my family, something that-
“Good,” he replied, clearly grateful. “Now let’s play some quidditch.” Ginny accioed her broom and they started flying. It was fun, she felt free. Harry pulled out a snitch and let it loose. They spent hours trying to find it. Harry won when he grabbed the snitch and nearly fell off his broom.
“You don’t have to do that,” urged Luna. She was hugging the coat tight though and Ginny could see she needed it.
“N-no!” Ginny protested. She begged to stay at Hogwarts as her mum dragged her away. All of the students faces were blurring around her and a sea of voices chanted,
“Oh um, what were you saying? I’m sorry I wasn’t paying attention,” Ginny stuttered. Something about this girl made her stomach flutter and her head swim. It made it hard to pay attention. Ginny looked at her face and searched for some sort of emotion. She was expecting hurt or confusion, but instead she saw calm and understanding.
Ginny wished she could just fly away from her troubles. It must be so nice, to be an owl. At any moment, if things get to much for you or you just want to leave, you can fly away. It must be marvelous.
She clutched the sides of her head as though it would stop the voices. As soon as she realized what she was doing though, she dropped her hands from embarrassment. It was a good thing she was one of the only ones there, she didn’t want to cause a scene.
“No,” and strutted away. Along with Dariah, three other gryffindors, two hufflepuffs, one Ravenclaw, and a Slytherin all put their names in that day. There were also 15 students from the other schools.
Everyone followed him out of the tent and Ginny saw something in the sky that only made the terror she felt grow. A glowing green and white snake with a skull. The dark mark. The mark of death eaters, of you know who. They were here. She started running as fast as she could away from the murderous sign. She heard screams and saw fires start. She screamed when she saw one start only a couple feet away from her. She sprinted into the forest near the Quidditch site. She curled herself up into a ball under a tree and whimpered. Why do the bad things always happen when I’m happy? She waited for awhile before she heard leaves rustling. Ginny pulled out her wand and stood up. She didn’t know many offensive spells but there was always obscuro which would create a blindfold over her attackers eyes or expelliarmus which would cause the attackers wand to fly out of their hand. As soon as the stranger was in eyesight Ginny pulled out her wand.
“Okay… that’s true. What if instead of these huge public ask-outs we just ask the crush out without an audience? That way if said crush rejects you nobody will know. And the only person you will be out to is the crush. Come on, it’s a fool-proof plan!”
“Course not,” Ginny replied. She felt a faint blush reach her cheeks so she focused all her attention on the headmaster.
“In this class I will prepare you for the world. The first things we will learn about are the Unforgivable curses, otherwise known as the Unforgivables. Now, the Ministry says you shouldn’t know about them but I disagree. Does anyone here know what the Unforgivables are?”
“Hullo everyone! You all can call me Hagrid, ther’ll be no need for Professor in my class,” Hagrid said cheerily.
He made the spider crawl into the jar of water. The spider was pulled slightly down so it was barely under the water.
Pretty soon after that, a strange girl came to her seat. She said something but Ginny wasn’t paying attention to her words. Ginny was transfixed by her beauty. The girl had long blond hair and huge triangle shaped glasses covering her eyes. They were silver, with specks of grey and blue. Ginny was sure she had never seen prettier eyes.
During that detention they’d decided upon a truce. Originally it had been just that, a truce. But once the two had stopped constantly arguing with each other they found that they enjoyed the other’s company.
“Um, yes, I suppose. All the boys say so at least and you’ve got to agree that she’s at least a little attractive,” said Luna quickly.
“Thank you,” she said shyly. “Most people are scared of thestrals but I think they’re quite nice. Sometimes I find them in the forbidden forest, they always come up to me and I’ve never gotten attacked. I find them to be peaceful creatures.”
Im updating a little early, since I have school tomorrow and wouldn’t have time to post until later. Tell me what you think!
Thank you all for the kudos! I’ve started three Drarry works so if you ship it (like me) then check those out! Don’t worry, this is still my top priority but sometimes I need a break, ya know? Anyways, the next update will be on Monday. Enjoy!
“That is correct. Five points to Gryffindor. The puffapod has a rather particular way of blooming. Does anyone know how?” When nobody raised their hand Professor Sprout continued. “When the Puffapod comes in contact with a solid surface, it will immediately sprout. Now, as for you homework...”
“Ok... do you want to go do something? We could go hang out in the common room or somewhere else if you want,” Ginny suggested.
“Now, for the last demonstration. Avada Kedavra!” The spider quivered for a moment before completely falling limp. It was dead. “Class dismissed.”
Pansy sighs again, though this time it’s a bit less of a depressed sigh and more of a ‘I’m so done with this’ sigh.
“What’s hilarious?” Harry asked. Ginny didn’t even hear him, she was laughing so hard. “What’s hilarious?” He demanded again.
“Yes,” Luna said sadly. Noticing Ginny’s curiosity Luna explained further, “my mum dies when I was eight. She was a bit crazy and she loved to experiment with magic. One day her experimenting went wrong and,” Luna gestured with her hands. “I saw her die,” she said quietly.
The fire danced in its grate, sending shadows across the empty Slytherin common room. This was how Draco preferred it. Warm, quiet, and semi-dark. He hadn't gone to dinner with the rest of the school after lessons, choosing instead to enjoy the perfect conditions of solitude in the most comfortable armchair by the fire.
Draco knew that voice. He cringed as he looked up and saw Pansy standing over him, giving Karen a haughty look. Easily three times the first year's size, Pansy stepped around Draco's chair to stand in front of them both, arms crossed and legs locked. To Karen's credit, she didn't seem intimidated, only confused.
But Harry just laughed as he kissed Draco again, pressing his hips downward, sliding their erections together once more, and Draco was left with no other choice but to give into the sensations that were setting his body on fire.
He finishes setting their plates in a storm, grumbling about the oaf that is the Boy Who Lived. But he takes a deep breath to reset before calling Teddy and Harry to eat, reminds himself that on a typical day, he and Harry never collide and it’s glorious.
"Oh, Harry, Ron, come now, sit, sit!" Mrs. Weasley said in a falsely bright voice. "I suspect Ginny will be here soon, then we can tuck in!"
"Look," Ron slurred, sounding exasperated. "Mum's looking for you two. Thank Merlin I found you before she did...but just...ugh, just hurry it up and go find her, will you? I shouldn't be hunting you prats down at my own wedding."
“Congratulations, it only took you ten seconds to recognize a familiar face instead of thirty. Now where is he?”
Harry's heart hurt at the self-loathing in Draco's voice. He pulled back to look Draco in the eye, wanting to make sure he did this right. Tears still covered Draco's cheeks, and Harry brought his hands up to cup Draco's face, his thumbs swiping across the skin there to wipe away the tears.
Terror seized Harry, springing him into action. He lunged across the tower, crossing the surface in barely a second. His arms thrust forward and wrapped around Malfoy's chest. For one terrible moment, Harry thought his momentum would send them both tumbling over the ledge, but he was able to plant his feet and swing himself back, dragging Malfoy with him. In his desperation, Harry had thrown his entire body into the action and the force sent him crashing painfully into the stone floor, sliding him a few feet as Malfoy's body crashed on top of his with a surprised grunt.
"Well now that shirt's just ruined," Draco said, still breathless as Harry wadded the fabric into a tight ball and dropped it onto the floor.
"Yeah. It'll be rather full, I think, what with all the brothers that are usually abroad or elsewhere coming to stay at once."
Only having an audience keeps Draco from laughing aloud at the look on Potter’s face. There is no way they won’t end up killing each other one day. Hopefully the murdering comes about in such a way that the victor doesn’t cost them Teddy.
Draco saw a few droplets of blood from the scratch on his chest fall to the ground. The pain demanded he remain doubled over, but he forced himself to look back up at Josh to see all the hatred there.
“‘s’at supposed to mean som’in’ to me?” Draco asks, lifting his head. Tom, a little blurry, is frowning at him. “An’ I don’ need ‘ur pity.”
“There are three schools competing. Hogwarts is one of them, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang are competing as well. This year, Hogwarts will be hosting.”
Harry had just shrugged awkwardly and agreed. Nobody seemed to notice how uncomfortable Harry felt- everyone except Ginny. She went to bed that night thinking about Quidditch and friends. She dreamt about going to the Quidditch World Cup. She dreamt that one of the Quidditch players asked her to compete with them and that Ginny helped them to win the World Cup. It was a fabulous dream.
“This whole thing? Did you really think I had a crush on you? After all this time? I had a crush on you when I was like ten, I’m thirteen now. That crush is long gone. Also, was that your idea of a nice resection? ‘I don’t mean to hurt your feelings but I wouldn’t date you if my life depended on it.’ You should be pretty glad that I actually wanted to play quidditch with you today and I wasn’t asking you out,” Ginny explained. Harry looked at her for a few moments before realizing what she had just said.
She was getting ready to head back to the common room after waiting for her secret admirer to come when she heard footsteps. She darted into a corner and prayed nobody say her.
While Blaise still didn’t trust the Gryffindors, Pansy had joined Draco in becoming friends with them. Actually, Pansy and Weasley had unexpectedly become pretty good friends. And Draco seemed to get along fairly well with Granger.
Besides, she liked boys. That had to count for something... right? But Luna. She was so perfect, just absolutely beautiful. So kind, and understanding. Ginny would live her whole life without kissing another boy if it meant she could spend it with Luna. What do I do?
“Wow,” Ginny said in awe as she gazed at the shrieking shack. It was very tall and rickety and almost looked as though it would topple at any moment. There were many oddly shaped windows and one of them was cracked. It was a sight for sore eyes, if she was being honest. A howl came from the shack.
Draco worked on the potion himself, and when the professor asked where his partner had gone, he just said that, “Harry hadn’t been feeling too well and went to see Madame Pomphrey.”
After the First Task was over there was a small party in the Common Room. Harry opened the egg and it let out a blood curdling shriek. Needless to say Harry did not open it up again after that. Ron and Harry seemed to make up during the party, so everything seemed to be going well.
Morning came and Ginny was freaking out. All of her anxieties seemed to be dancing in the front of her brain.
My school is out for winter break so I’ll try to write more. Maybe 2 chapters a week again? I’ll try.
Ginny had gotten closer with Harry though. They’d played a few quidditch practice games together during the past couple of weeks. She’d found out that Harry was pretty enjoyable to be around. The second time they’d hung out together she asked him why he lied.
It was December, and that meant one thing: the Yule Ball. Teachers had announced it and it was the biggest thing happening at Hogwarts. It was right before Holiday Break so a lot of people were staying at Hogwarts for the holidays. Ginny wasn’t sure if she’d be staying or leaving yet but she was thinking about the Yule Ball. She wanted to go with Luna, but she wasn’t sure if Luna wanted to go or if going together was even possible. Would people notice the two of them? Would it out them? She wasn’t sure. Nonetheless Ginny was kind of excited. She’d always wanted to go to a ball.
Ginny woke up early the next morning- too early. She and the rest of the family met up with the Diggory’s. Mr. Diggory, Mrs. Diggory, and their son Cedric were waiting for them. Mr. Diggory was standing by something, it looked to be a smallish object protruding from the ground. Mr. Diggory kept talking about the Quidditch match that Harry had the lost the year before to Cedric. It was exhausting really, hearing him brag about his son’s Quidditch abilities. When Ginny glanced over at Cedric she saw his face was bright red, probably from embarrassment. She felt bad for him. Ginny listened as her dad explained that the object in the ground was a portkey. When they touched it, it would take them to the Quidditch World Cup. They were warned to not let go and also that the sensation of being transported was far from pleasant. Mum told everyone to form a circle around the portkey.
Reluctantly, Harry flipped himself off of Draco’s waist and stood slowly. His whole body was burning to touch and be touched.
“Alright,” Harry began once his last first year had trickled into the classroom, “Today we’re going to talk a little bit about some similarities in some well known evil Muggles and well known evil Wizards.” The class tittered excitedly, as if learning about evil was the best news they’d received all week. Harry laughed to himself as he turned toward the chalk board.
She stepped down from the podium as the bustle of hundreds of moving students filled the Hall. Harry sat up slowly, cradling Teddy to his chest. The boy had begun to stir and whimper quietly.
He headed into the sitting room, picking up Teddy, who was dozing, and depositing himself on the couch. Harry nuzzled the bottle between the boy’s lips until he latched, holding him close.
Draco sat up as Potter approached the group of three, not bothering to hide his smile as he left his friends behind him. “I’m going to pretened I never heard that,” he said with an amused glance at Pansy. She shrugged unabashedly, and Draco felt a strange surge of warmth for them both.
He couldn’t just leave Teddy. He couldn’t bear to have the small boy out of his sight. Andromeda had already promised up and down that she would attend as many Hogwarts meals with Teddy as possible, but Harry wasn’t entirely sure he’d make it to the hols without having his godson with him everywhere he went. Teddy had Andromeda, he knew, but she wouldn’t be able to take care of him forever. Better if Harry started sooner. Plus, the three of them in Andromeda’s small cottage had begun to feel like family, even moreso than the Weasleys had ever been. It was the first time he wondered how children like Ron and Ginny were ever excited at the prospect of going away to boarding school for the year.
“You’re not alright, Mr Potter, no,” Madame Pomfrey said from beside Professor McGonagall. “I’ve never seen such a large magical core depletion in all my time as a healer. It’s a wonder we didn’t have to send you to Saint Mungo’s – not to mention I’m shocked that you’re already awake.”
Really, this whole conversation was much above Harry’s non-existent paygrade. “Sometimes,” Harry settled on saying. “But it doesn’t bother us, because we know the things they say aren’t true.” He glanced back quickly at Ron and Hermione. Ron was looking tactfully down at his crossed legs. Hermione simply raised an eyebrow at him.
, Draco was quite confident he was a small step away from hyperventilating like a stupid twelve-year-old. But then Potter reached out and brushed Draco’s side again, and he could feel the tremor in his hands and – was it wrong that it made Draco feel a little bit better, to know Harry was just as worried?
Pansy relayed the plan quickly and efficiently – Harry’s only role was “Look friendly but don’t talk, for Merlin’s sake, or you’ll scare them away, Potter,” which he couldn’t really argue with. He spent the rest of the feast trying not to agonize about how the Slytherins would probably hate him and it would ruin his desire to open a school before he could even
I was resistant. McGonagall told me that she would not sign off on my parole unless I took tea with her daily. At first we took tea in the Headmistress’ office – the portraits are quite distracting, so then we took tea in the kitchens. It was a small start and I felt like I was held positively captive, more than I was physically, with the threat of my parole looming above my head. If I refused to speak, answer questions, be cooperative, she would remind me of her next meeting with my parole officer.
But at Hermione’s expectant look, he caved. “Muggle studies will be mandatory for everyone from first year to seventh year, starting next year. We’ve something planned for this year, too, but I’m not allowed to say yet.”
“I think I can decide that for myself, thanks,” Harry said, shocked at how clear his voice was. It was instinct again, that was driving him. Consciously, he mostly wanted to be sick. “I’m happy to room with Zabini for the year.”
“You’re actually daft,” Blaise said. Draco could hear the false amazement in his voice, the mocking tone. His friend’s face was hardened, looked almost impassive but Draco knew that for Blaise, that meant he was angry.
“Erm – hi,” Harry said. It was a strange moment, where he longed for the Days Before when he could talk to his friends without any awkwardness or shame. He was a product of the Days After now, hardly thought about the Days Before anymore.
“I- he- you-” Weasley blustered. Granger had her head in her hands. Draco strongly suspected she was crying, but couldn’t bring himself to care.
“Yes, it’s all very exciting,” McGonagall said with an almost-Draco-like drawl. It was Harry’s turn to laugh. “Moving along, the Defence position will be filled by Professor Cleomenes, who will also be acting as Head of Gryffindor house in my stead.”
“Must not be bad, being here this summer,” Harry said after some silence. “Better than,” he gestured broadly.
I am sure degradation was the point, with Bellatrix. That and the pain she must have caused you – the lasting scar. Have you ever thought about covering it up with a tattoo? I have, but I won’t. My mark is part of me, part of my past. I cannot erase it and I would not want to. Rather, I can only hope it will remind me to be better.
I’m sure you think of me as a monster. I think of myself as a monster, too, sometimes. I won’t be self-depreciating, but I will be honest. Perhaps by the end of the war I no longer wanted to be fighting. Not because I disagreed with all of their ideals, but because I wanted to
It was gentle, not like the kisses they had shared before in the living room, or the garden, or the Astronomy Tower. Draco’s lips were soft on his, his tongue adventurous in his mouth. Harry moved his hands to Draco’s chest, caressing his shoulders, his hips, wherever he could reach. He felt Draco’s hands stray to his waist, and willed himself to stay calm.
“What are you writing for your muggle studies assignment?” A sixth year girl asked. Harry was fairly confident her name was Amelia, but he didn’t know the older students as well as he knew the younger students. “I want to get it out of the way,” she said with a sigh.
“Why are you here?” Harry asked, once his words had returned. He hadn’t seen Malfoy since his trial in front of the Wizengamot. Harry and returned Malfoy his wand, then. Had spoken in his defence. But had not stuck around to see the results of the trial. Hermione had insisted he shouldn’t get too invested, that he couldn’t save everyone. She was right, of course. Eventually, days had faded into weeks, and he had stopped being curous about the outcome.
He headed into the sitting room, picking up Teddy, who was dozing, and depositing himself on the couch. Harry nuzzled the bottle between the boy’s lips until he latched, holding him close.
Across from where they were standing were two hallways. A crowd was clustered against the wall between the hallways. Harry assumed that was where the list of room assignments. He couldn’t find it in himself to care who he ended up with, particularly.
He looked up to find Draco and Blaise sitting at a small table, looking at him in astonishment. A house elf appeared beside the table, snapping into existence two more chairs and place settings, before bustling away as quickly as it had appeared.
“Breathe,” Draco said in his ear as they sat down at the table. Harry did his best to give Draco a smile, but was sure it came out looking wobbly. As usual, though, they were the only ones at their end of the eighth year table. Ron, Hermione, and Neville weren’t there yet, either, which helped calm his panic some.
“Gryffindor idiots,” Draco said before Harry could respond. Michael was back to looking amused at Draco’s response.
“We’re late for breakfast,” he said, by way of greeting. Harry sat up quickly at that, shock coursing through his system.
He stopped to kiss Teddy, who was now happily in his bouncer in the sitting room, before following Draco to the kitchen. Teddy’s high chair had been moved over to make a seat for Draco around the small kitchen table.
Harry only partially paid attention as Andromeda spoke with McGonagall about his magic. He floated through the conversation, eager to find Draco and see what he thought about everything, only coming back into himself long enough to give Teddy a kiss on the head and hand him back to Andromeda. He waited patiently, heeding McGonagall’s warning that he needed to check in with her every other day to discuss the progress of his magic before taking off out her office and down the hall.
Draco heaved a deep sigh when he was done. “No wonder she didn’t want to talk about it,” he said finally. “It’s funny, that year was so horrible, but perhaps if it hadn’t happened the way it had we would all still be as horrid as we were in sixth year.”
Last year, though, I watched people killed in front of me. I had Lovegood and Ollivander in my cellar. No, my dungeons. What kind of person grows up in a house with dungeons? I hadn’t known they were there, not until I came home and was given the task of bringing them food and water – when the Dark Lord felt like feeding the prisoners.
Thankfully, there were no forced partnerships for the rest of the day, and they didn’t have any more classes with the Gryffindors. Harry wasn’t able to eat at lunch, still feeling too sick from the morning’s events. Draco seemed to be feeling much the same. By the time evening came, both were exhausted, so Blaise offered to go to with Pansy to show Mar the library while Harry and Draco got some rest.
“Don’t tell me it’s different because you’ve sucked his dick,” she said between cackles. Draco buried his face in his hands. “I don’t think that will work with Granger, I’m not sure she has one, but you could always try with Weasley.”
Draco felt Harry’s hand grip him, perhaps reflexively, but he didn’t look over. He opened his mouth to say – well, he wasn’t sure
After a beat of silence, Draco sighed. “They’ve been talking about it for ages,” he said gently to Harry. “It was bound to happen.”
Harry just swatted at his hand. “Do any of you pay attention to the Daily Prophet?” he asked suddenly. The question had been burning since Ron and Hermione had confronted him on Saturday, but by the time he had gotten out of the hospital wing he had lost the nerve to bring it up.
“I’ll meet you at the Slytherin table,” Harry said quietly, shrugging with the baby in his hands. Pansy just nodded curtly and walked away, leaving Draco standing helplessly between them. Harry rolled his eyes. “C’mon,” he said to Draco.
Harry shrugged. “I thought that’s what I wanted,” he said. And it was, too. In the Days Before, that had been his goal. But now he had lived through a war, and more fighting was the last thing that he had wanted.
The minute they entered the common room Harry was accosted by the first year Slytherins, led by Mar, scampering around them and begging to know what happened. He refused to explain to them, but reassured them that yes he was alright and yes he would still be teaching History of Magic the next day. Eventually they left him alone, and the rest of the common room seemed confident that he was alright once he had answered all the rapid-fire first year questions and complimented Mar’s haircut, so they were left in relative silence, the four of them.
When he entered the kitchen, he mostly expected it to be empty. But it wasn’t - he noticed the telltale sniffs of someone crying, first, before his eyes even registered who it was.
Harry couldn’t help it – through the panic, he snorted. “Yes, and instead I went to him willingly,” he countered. “We were all doing our best to survive, we
Hermione said something, maybe, Harry wasn’t sure. He was dimly aware of them getting up and leaving – or were they backing away from him? He couldn’t see anymore, couldn’t feel. The world had gone from grey to white, he was angry like he had never been, not even in the Days Before, not when he had hated the world. The newspaper crunched in his hand and then felt hot, as if it had burst into flames.
Harry felt himself draw his wand and raise it. It wasn’t conscious, was completely instinct – something that remained from the Days Before, perhaps. He saw a flash in his peripheral vision – Zabini, also drawing his wand.
HAHA this was only supposed to ever be a one-shot, but I guess here's another chapter. I love this Harry and have a whole character and storyline fleshed out for him now. Should I keep going?? Focus on the fanfics I already have going?? help aaaaah
“And when are you planning on doing the rest of your work?” he asked. “Between old McGonagall today and meeting with Binns tomorrow it’s not as though you’ll have time.”
Draco pushed him up against the door impatiently as soon as they entered the room. “I was so scared,” he said between kisses. It was a small thing to say, but significant nonetheless for a man who rarely talked about his feelings.
Harry wasn’t really sure where to go from here. How did one start a possible insurrection in a week? There was only one good answer. Pansy Parkinson.
“Can I see him now?” Harry asked, sitting up straighter. “I’m feeling fine. How long have I been here, anyway?”
dilute magic blood. But that isn’t a reason to commit murder. With or without magic, we are all still humans and we can all adapt. I wish this was something I had understood all along. Magic was essential to me as breathing, until it wasn’t. Sometimes the sight of magic makes me sick after all the things I did and I am glad I can no longer use my wand for much.
“You want to study?” Hermione asked, gasping mockingly. “Who are you and what have you done with Harry?”
Harry accepted the offered change of subject. “Yeah,” he said simply. “I had trouble leaving Andromeda’s for Hogwarts, this year. Didn’t want to go. I think it will be nice to have them back. But I’m worried…” he trailed off.
,” McGonagall said in a clear voice. Draco stiffened beside him at her words and Zabini shifted on his other side. Harry had no idea what he meant, but
Draco’s breath was hot on his neck as he spoke and Harry felt himself get impossibly harder. “No exertion,” he said. “All you need to do is stand there and look pretty, love.”
Everyone was changed, but he knew what he thought it would be like – curtains pulled around their four-poster beds, silencing spells casted, grief dealt with quietly, screaming from nightmares hushed. When he looked at the three of them – which he didn’t often, hurt as he was by their behaviour – he imagined that his guesses weren’t far off. They often looked drawn and tired. Then again, they had more horrendous memories here than he ever had, really. Nothing he had experienced could amount to the seventh year they had spent here.
“He said she’s choosing eight eighth year students to be assigned two to each Hogwarts house. We’re supposed to make sure the younger ones feel safe, and that the older ones don’t kill anyone, I suppose,” she sighed theatrically.
Draco spun him around and kissed him soundly. Maybe it was partly the water or the way Draco was touching him but Harry felt like he was drowning in the best possible way. It was all he could do to lean against the cool tiles and kiss Draco back.
Harry filled him in quickly on what they had spoken of during the class. He even added, for good measure, how well their potion came out. He wasn’t sure when, but at some point while he was talking, he drifted into sleep.
It was clearly not the type of evening where any work was getting done, though. They curled up on the couch in front of the fire, Draco with his head in Harry’s lap and legs across Pansy and Blaise, the latter seated with his back to the armrest of the couch so he could face everyone, talking aimlessly amongst themselves.
“Sorry to disappoint,” he said, wryly, sitting down on the bed next to her. She wasn’t crying, now, but obviously had been. She was sitting on the bed against the headboard instead, holding a pillow to her chest.
“For Merlin’s sake,” groused Draco. Harry watched with satisfaction as he threw down his quill and spun in his chair. Draco’s face was flushed, and his eyes dark, but not, Harry noted, with anger. With something else.
Then, to my surprise, you lot appeared at the manor in the hands of Snatchers. I do not know what I was thinking when I refused to identify you. I don not know that I was thinking at all, except that if you were killed then all hope was lost and this madman would never leave my house. My life would never go back to normal. And I thought, perhaps, that they knew it was you anyway. That if I refused to identify you I would finally be killed. I wanted death so badly in those times – I couldn’t stoop so low, of course. Not really. If I had harmed myself, he would have killed my parents as punishment. There is no escape from being a Death Eater, you see. Not even in death. Not unless you die for the cause.
So he stood there and stroked Draco’s hair instead, clumsily kissing the side of his head until they other boy was able to straighten and look at him again.
It was such a comfortable bed. So soft and pillowy. It was a lot nicer of a bed than the one she had at home.
“Today is the day of the first task. Each of our contestants will have to retrieve a golden egg. It holds a clue to the second task. Each of our judges will score the other contestants. The first to complete the task is none other than Harry Potter!”
Voices clambered on top of each other, cheering for the plays they loved and complaining about the other team. It was great. Suddenly her dad came running in.
Ginny sat down at her desk in Defense Against the Dark Arts. She’d had a few classes the previous week, but even Professor Moody let them slack off during the entree period. This was the first official class. Once everyone was seated, the Professor started the lesson.
I sighed. “No, I haven’t. I want to, but I’m not sure how they’d react. They’ve never been homophobic but you never know. You’re the first person I’ve told other than Luna.”
“Your here! I mean, I knew you’d come but I was a little worried you’d bail,” Luna rambled, blushing slightly. Why the heck is she blushing? Ginny let out a small laugh.
Ginny knew that Levi was half blood. Levi often passed glares and was quick to blame Ginny of any problems. The other girl was friends with Levi. She knew the other was muggleborn and frankly, terrified of Ginny. She had been since the second year, after she had found out about the “incident”. Ginny couldn’t remember her name. Her roommates weren’t mean but they certainly weren’t nice. For the most part, they ignored her. This was good since Ginny often snuck out.
The owl simply flew away. She didn’t recognize the owl at all. Perhaps it’s the gift mum was talking about? She opened the letter.
Ginny hurried to the greenhouse, where Professor Sprout was getting ready to teach them about a pink plant with pink pods held in the leaves.
She just wanted the fluttery feeling in her stomach to disappear. She wished with all her heart she could just be... normal. No Tom Riddle or the diary. No fluttery feelings or unwanted attraction. She couldn’t be... gay.
Dumbledore paused until the cheers subsided, and then continued, “Now, you are all wondering how the student will be chosen, yes?”
“Hmm, it is? I can’t remember it ever being said, I suppose I’ll just have to wait and see if I get in trouble,” said Luna as she slid into the seat next to Ginny. “By the way, I’ll have to talk to some of the students from Durmstrang. Their heads are just full of wrackspurts, I’ll have to ask how they found them.”
“The Goblet of Fire will shoot out the name of whoever it has chosen. If you are chosen, you can not back out. Entering your name means you completely understand the dangers of these trials and that you are prepared to compete. If I call your name you will walk over to where I am standing. Your Headmaster will take you aside and explain everything to you. Now then, let’s begin.” The Goblet let out a sudden roar and a great burst of fire. A small slip of paper burst from the fire and fell idly into the headmaster’s hand. “Our first tribute is Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons Academy!”
Another person that everyone was expecting to enter was Viktor Crum. He was a professional quidditch player, and also a Durmstrang student. There was a large group of students- boys and girls alike- that followed Crum around like his own personal paparazzi. Ginny was also very intrigued by Crum, he was a successful quidditch player, and very good. And although he was a seeker, and Ginny’s dream was to be a chaser, she looked up to him in a strange way.
This isn't really a chapter and more of a scene. Sorry about how short it is! The next chapter will be longer, I promise.
“I didn’t steal, I paid for them while you were in the loo,” said Luna. “I wanted it to be a surprise,” she added quietly.
“Okay,” Harry agreed. “Could you give us a minute? We were kind of in the middle of something here.”
“We both have people we want to impress, right? Or at least we both have people we want to be our Valentine.” She sees my frown. “Oh don’t even try to deny it. I think the entire school is aware that you have a giant crush on somebody. Even bloody Potter probably knows.”
Throughout the week, classes were all but cancelled, as almost nobody could focus, and almost all the teachers gave up on teaching class. Even Professor McGonagall didn’t hold proper classes, and instead assigned everybody a short essay at the start of the week, and let students work on it as classwork.
“Bottoms up!” And the twins downed the potions. For a few moments, it looked as though nothing was going to happen. Then, Both twins had a shadow of stubble and a few aging lines.
“Calm down, I’m teasing. It would be terrific though if you could wear it. That lion head was awesome.”
Ginny screamed as Luna kicked her nose. She looked up to try and plead with Luna but saw her mum instead.
Ginny waited there, in the owlery, for a long time. She didn’t know what she was waiting for exactly, it just felt nice to be there, surrounded by things that wouldn’t, and couldn’t judge you.
“Announcement in the Great Hall! Announcement in the Great Hall! Come to the Great Hall quickly! McGonnagall said so and she’s pretty scary when she’s mad so you BETTER COME QUICK!”
She was having a hard time deciding whether she loved being with Luna or hated being with her. She always got so, so- so nervous around Luna but she was so beautiful and mysterious. She was so calm and kind, and seemed so understanding. Ginny longed to get to know her- to spend time with her. Luna made her feel a way nobody else did.
Valentine's Day is this Saturday. Oh well. Valentine’s Day has never been my favorite holiday. All it does is remind me that I have no partner and that the one person I’m in love with hates me. So that’s great.
“Yes,” Ginny muttered. After seeing the look on Luna's face she quickly continued talking. “I mean no, I mean, I’m not good at this sort of thing.”
“Arania exumai,” and the rest of the spiders were gone. Ginny saw Dumbledore let out a small chuckle and then talk once more.
So… I’m back! Surprise everyone! Guess who’s got the motivation to write? Me. Though it seems as soon as I have motivation to write I don’t have it to draw and vise verse… oh well. Anyway I’ve been on a sort of writing spree for the past few days, let’s hope it holds up. There’s like a 50/50 chance that I finish this fic, so… yeah.
When they got back to the castle Ginny parted ways with luna and sat down at the Gryffindor table while Luna sat at the Ravenclaw one. Dinner was a blur and all Ginny could think about was Luna.
Draco felt a blush creep up onto his neck and face. Now he knew that one of his biggest fears was true. He had a crush on Harry. And based on Professor Whitlock’s teachings, a rather strong one at that.
“Okay, thank you for the congratulations. Congrats to you as well. As for my questions: number one: how long have you guys been friends. Number two: how long have you been dating? Number three: are you planning on telling your friends and my family? If so, when? Number four: is Malfoy going to tell his family and if so, when? Number five: how can you be sure that he can be trusted?”
“Maybe, that howl was terrifying,” responded Ginny. Truth was, she knew exactly what went on in that shack. She had overheard her brother’s conversation with Harry once and they ended up explaining it to her. She knew all about Professor Lupin’s... condition and how he went to the shack to transform. She didn’t want to explain that to Luna though, since it wasn’t really their business. Luna shivered and Ginny handed Luna her coat.
Ginny’s summer had been two things: long and boring. She longed to go back to Hogwarts. She missed the long and winding halls, she missed the paintings that always seemed to have something to say. She missed everything about hogwarts! Even the thought of Peeves made her feel warm and comforted! Most of all she missed Quidditch. She hoped to make the team this year. The year before Mum hadn’t allowed her to try out. She had said it was far to dangerous and Ginny had decided to not push her luck. Maybe this year. Nothing to dangerous had happened the year before, hopefully she should try out this year! Ginny was a pretty good Quidditch player. She had been sneaking out to take her brother’s brooms and practice during the night. She may not have had the nicest broom, or the nicest set of Quidditch balls, (or even a complete set of Quidditch balls) but Ginny had perseverance. She had practiced long and hard for years. She was ready. She was going to ask about joining the Quidditch team.
“They’re really good.” Ginny took a sip and silently agreed. It was warm and delicious. It reminded her of home, but in a good way.
“Don’t be silly, I’m not cold anyway. Come on, let’s head back.” They walked back to hogwarts in a peaceful silence. Once they got back, Luna tried to give her the coat back.
Her own room at home was very bland. There was a bed in the corner. Next to the bed was a dresser with some pictures. She had a few Quidditch posters hanging on her wallls but not much.
“Really.” Ginny gazed into her eyes. She suddenly felt an urge to kiss her. A mental image flashed in her brain. Ginny... kissing a girl. But not just any girl... Luna. No. It can’t be! I’m not... I can’t... it’s not.. no! Nononono! Ginny hopped off the windowsill and backed away.
“Sure,” Ginny responded. Luna walked up to the counter and ordered the drinks. She came back holding two butterbeers.
“So, um, why are you here?” Ginny asked. Now that the initial embarrassment had worn of she was curious as to what the other girl was doing here.
“Erm, now that you’re here, what would y-you like to work on? We could do charms, or- or potions. Although I suck at potions. Maybe we could study, um transfiguration. Or um, maybe care of magical creatures?” Ginny sighed internally.
“Very well.” He stopped the spell but then cast another. “Imperio!” He forced the spider to stand up. He raised his wand and the spider was raised in the air. He made the spider float all the way to the girl and land on her head before crawling onto her face.
The two girls talked for the entire train ride. It seemed like the train ride lasted for days, but in a good way. Ginny couldn’t get enough of Luna. She seemed so mysterious and intriguing. Ginny couldn’t help but feel butterflies in her stomach whenever Luna opened her mouth.
“Here,” she said and handed Luna the mirror. “I know it’s not as fancy or advanced or as pretty as yours but do you like it?”
“The Unforgivables are a set of three curses. These three curses are technically illegal to use. Can anyone name an Unforgivable Curse?”
“That is also correct. Five points to Gryffindor for the first person who answered and five points to Ravenclaw for the second.” He paused. “Does anyone know the third Unforgivable Curse?”
Today she had Herbology with Hufflepuff, then Charms with Ravenclaw, then she had lunch. After lunch was Care of Magical creatures with Slytherin, and her last class was History of Magic with... Ravenclaw again.
Pansy and I are moping together in my room once again. Tomorrow is Saturday and the holiday I’ve been dreading.
“No, they are pulled by thestrals. You can only see the thestrals if you’ve witnessed a death though, so it’s not surprising you can’t see them,” Luna explained.
Ginny had thought her mum was being irrational. She still thought her mum had been being irrational. Frankly, she was worried her mum wouldn’t let them go back to Hogwarts after what happened at the Quidditch World Cup but thankfully it seemed that although what had happened was scary- it didn’t need to interfere with their education. Thank goodness, she thought.
Now he and Harry didn’t just spend time together during Potion’s. Sometimes they had mini Quidditch matches against each other. And sometimes he’d eat with Harry and his Golden Trio.
“That’s Fleur Delacure. She’s part Veela which means anyone who has attraction to girls won’t be able to take their eyes off her. I guess that means all the guys will be ogling her all year while us girls stay normal,” said a Gryffindor girl with a laugh.
Nobody said anything. The cruciatus and the killing curse were the most well known of the three curses.
“No… I came to see if you wanted to play a practice round with me or something,” Ginny said. Harry looked at her confused, then annoyed.
To Ginny’s delight, breakfast was, in fact, still happening. She loaded her plate with eggs and sausages and sat down. Pretty soon her owl came swooping in and dropped a letter, along with the Daily Prophet, onto her lap. The letter was from her mum.
“Not just any dragon, that’s a Hungarian Horntail. They’re supposed to be one of the most dangerous dragon species, if not the most dangerous. I hope Harry can manage it.”
On the second day, more students entered than before. First, was Dariah, a Gryffindor prefect. Most Gryffindor’s let out a cheer as she walked up to the goblet and put her name in. Expecting the fire, Dariah jumped back as soon as she dropped her parchment. Blue flames rose up, then back down, as she walked away confidently. The Great Hall cheered as Dariah smiled. One girl asked,
Two: she wasn’t straight, but she also wasn’t... gay. She didn’t think she was ready for a specific label yet but one couldn’t like girls and also be straight now, could they?
“Okay. I trust you, and I’ll try to trust Malfoy. Thanks for telling me. Now, I actually have something I need to tell you.”
Eventually, Professor Sprout led her students into the Great Hall. Professor Dumbledore was waiting in the Great hall and standing next to the Goblet of Fire. Almost all the students had arrived and the seats were packed. Ginny sat down at the Gryffindor Table. Luna plopped down in the seat beside her.
The room seemed to reek of him. It smelled like the quidditch pitch and broom polish. But it was mixed with a familiar… Harry-like scent. This was fairly odd, especially considering Harry wasn’t even in the same room as him.
Thestrals seem to be important to her, what if I’m being too personal? Will she get mad? Ugh, WHY AM I SO NERVOUS? Ginny screamed out her thoughts. Her stomach was doing that weird butterfly-fluttery thing again and her hands were cold and clammy. Thankfully Luna didn’t seem mad at all.
When Draco was finished with his classes he practically ran to the Slytherin common and told Pansy everything.
Ginny decided to drop it. Hopefully he’d tell her eventually. She wasn’t going to press for more details. Besides, she was busy with her own business. She had decided to tell Harry about her relationship with Luna.
Kudos + reviews are appreciated! So are comments that say “when is another chapter?” Or “my grandma can write chapters faster than you so upload already” because they give me motivation
At the beginning of the year Professor Whitlock (the new potion’s professor for eight year) assigned everyone seats. They’d matched partners according to skill level, pairing students that needed a bit more help with students that didn’t need as much help, so the more talented partner could help the one that needed it.
It turned out that Luna’s book was filled with lots of interesting magical creatures. It talked about unicorns and hippogriffs and so many other creatures. Eventually they got to the topic of thestrals.
“You mean the creatures that pull the carriages?” Ginny looked at her in confusion. Pulled the carriages?
“You’re probably right. But the point is you have a very obvious crush. And I have a slightly less obvious crush as well. And I don’t know about you but I’m tired of moping around in your room all day. We need to take action.”
Ginny left class. She wasn’t sure how she felt about Professor Moody- he had used illegal curses. She felt a little bad for the girl, too.
“Yes.” A figure came into view. The person was wearing a large lion’s  head on their face. “I came in costume, I don’t want you to know who I am.”
I hear Pansy sigh. She is also moping about. Apparently she’s been crushing on somebody in Hufflepuff, but nobody knows who.
“I’m glad she won,” said Luna. “Are you? There’s a whole group of girls who keep making fun of her behind her back, just because she’s pretty.”
“Hey, Harry? I just wanted to wish you good-,” Harry was standing in the tent kissing Draco Malfoy. “What is going on?” Harry awkwardly pushed Malfoy away.
It had been a couple weeks since Luna and Ginny became official. They hadn’t told anybody yet, mostly because they didn’t really know anybody. Luna was seen as a freak by most people and Ginny was mostly ignored.
Ginny smiled. She was glad her mum was supporting quidditch. She would have to find out when tryouts were soon so she could send an owl back to her mum. Suddenly another owl came swooping onto the table and dropped a letter in her lap.
She paid no attention to her roommates. The rooms were split into a room of three and a room of two. Ginny shared a room with two girls.
“I just wanted you to know that I’m not upset about what you said yesterday. If anything, I guess I’m happy.”
“I know you are all upset over the lack of quidditch this year but I believe this is for the best. Students from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons may leave, your headmasters will explain the rest. As for my students, you may go back to your dorms.” Ginny linked hands with Luna and they walked out of the Great Hall.
“What could you possibly know about my love life?” Pansy asks. She drapes herself across the bed across from me.
“About a year ago I remember seeing a girl wearing a giant paper mache lion’s head at a quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor. Was that you?”
After the dinner she made her way to her dorm and collapsed in bed. She feel asleep thinking of Luna.
“Hi Luna,” Ginny said hesitantly. She walked forwards and waved. She watched as Luna extended a hand. Ginny grabbed it, as if to shake hands but Luna thrust her towards the ground. Suddenly all the students were in the library watching them.
The girl looked around the train. “I would sit with you but I should try to sell, the rest of these quibblers,” she said with a sigh. God, even her sighs seem graceful, Ginny swooned.
Ginny remembered seeing it before. Had Ron said something about them? Oh... wasn’t it... that they made some creature sneeze? Trolls? Professor sprout called on a brown haired Hufflepuff student. She looked very kind, Ginny couldn’t remember hearing the girl tease her the year before.
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe, getting outed to the whole school and my family, my crush finding out I like him, said crush’s friends finding out I like him, becoming the laughing stalk of Hogwarts, and everyone hating me much more than they already do. It just seems to me that maybe this could be a big deal?”
“What are you talking about? What did I do?” Harry asked as he looked at her. He was obviously confused.
Draco wondered how his train of thought had managed to think about the topic of his absolutely nonexistent crush on Harry.
Nobody raised their hand. A few people looked frightened. Ginny did know what they were, since she’d overheard her father talk about them a few times. She also knew that they were very, very, dangerous and not something to joke about.
Luna thrust her lips onto Ginny’s and they kissed. It was awkward and weird and neither of them knew how to kiss, but it felt right. It just did. Ginny pulled away first.
Her Hogwarts room felt more like home than her other room did anyway. She went down to eat some sort of breakfast. She wasn’t sure if breakfast was still an option at 10:30 but... she was starving.
After lots of searching, they finally found the trio and everything was sorted out. Apparently they also started chasing after Ginny, but Hermione and Ron realized Harry was missing so they left to go look for him. They did find him but were unable to find everyone else so they ran out into the woods so they could get away from the fires. Ginny’s mum and dad said that it was okay and that they were just glad that everyone was safe but she could see the look of worry plastered across their face. They were scared.
The professors eyes twinkled and he looked over to Professor Flitwick, who was wheeling along a cart. There was a sheet on top of the cart and it looked to be covering something quite bulky. Dumbledore pulled off the sheet and revealed a golden trophy. It glittered and shined. It was a marvelous sight.
Viktor Crum finally entered his name on the fifth, and decidedly last, day. He walked soberly up to the goblet, barely clutching his paper, as though he almost wanted it to fall. He didn’t look at the audience, nor did he look happy. He looked as though he would like to be anywhere than where he was now. He dropped his paper in gingerly, ignoring the loud cheers from the audience behind him. Ginny cheered as well, as she looked up to Crum. He walked out of the Great hall afterwards, and acted as though nothing had happened.
“Yeah they are,” she said, after she saw Luna’s look of anticipation. She realized she had been silent for a while.
Just the sight of Luna made her head swim and her stomach flutter. What was it about this girl that makes me so nervous? Normally Ginny was headstrong and confident, she rarely backed down from a fight. Everyone knew that, but being around Luna made her trip over her words and butterflies fill her stomach. Nervous, but exited butterflies.
Ginny shuddered as she thought about the cruel nicknames that could follow her coming out. From a wide range of slurs to made up nicknames, the teasing would be unbearable. She sighed and crawled out from under her bed.
You have a sickness, you have a sickness. She screamed in her head for it to stop. The voices felt as though they were getting louder, though Ginny knew it was all in her head. She quickly threw open the toilet seat and vomited. She sat there, on the floor for a while. She felt a bit better and the voices were gone, but she had a raging headache. Eventually she crawled back to her bed and tried to fall asleep.
Draco noticed he was nervous too. He wasn’t shaking like Draco, but instead shifting his weight between each side, which Draco had noticed was something Harry often did while nervous.
He’d actually apologized to them a couple weeks ago, which was unexpected to everyone. For once, Draco had friends outside of his small Slytherin friend group.
By the end of the day, she was less worried and more excited. Many of her fears seemed silly in retrospect. Now she was just ready to get it over with. She also needed to get herself ready for the date.
“We have to pick Harry up from the Dursley’s today so you can’t practice but we are going to the Quidditch World Cup so I suppose you can watch the players and take notes.”
“This is the Goblet of Fire. Each student that is of age that wishes to participate will wright their name on a piece of paper. They will then drop their name into the fire. In exactly one week the goblet will spit out the contestant it deems worthy for the Tournament. Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be using the Goblet as well. And that brings me to my final announcement. Let us welcome Beauxbatons school of Magic!”
The doors to the Great Hall swung open and rows upon rows of teenage students come walking in. They were all wearing blue uniforms and looked very graceful and intelligent. There was one girl specifically, that Ginny couldn’t take her eyes off. She was tall and blond and had the most marvelous blue eyes. Ginny felt as though she could stare at her forever. Suddenly one of the students at the table started talking.
“I have flashbacks. Of being controlled by the diary. It happens when I come into close contact with another and sometimes gets triggered randomly. That’s what happened yesterday, that’s why I ran off. I’m really, really sorry,” Ginny lied.
“We’re not at Hogwarts Percy, or did you forget? You prefect badge and head boy status mean nothing here at the burrow!”
“But mum! That was, it was years ago! Plus Fred and George are in the team. I won’t get hurt, promise!” She argued.
“What is it? Did I do something? I’m sorry if I did.” No! It’s not your fault. I’ve got to get out of here.
They had argued for weeks before her Dad had finally stepped in and convinced her mum to allow her to go. Her mum hadn’t let her play Quidditch that year but Ginny figured it was better to just be happy she could return to Hogwarts.
Thanks for the people who left kudos on my story! I’ll be posting the next six chapters today, as promised.
“Yeah,” Luna agreed. “Time flies.” They packed up the rest of the sweets in Luna’s bag and stood up.
She first looked in the library, where she saw neville. She quickly scanned the room and then started to scurry off
“Erm, nothing. Nothing at all. Draco- I mean Malfoy was just, um, he was,” Harry stuttered. He fell silent and then sighed. “I guess the cat’s out of the bag now.”
“Thank you. Here’s what the thestrals look like.” Luna held up a piece of paper she had been drawing on.
“We’ve been friends for a couple months, we’ve been dating for about a month and a half, I’m planning on telling Ron and Hermione after our two month anniversary, I haven’t decided whether or not to tell your family yet, absolutely not. As for your last question; I just do. Obviously you can’t fully understand it because you weren’t there when he talked to me but I could just tell what he was saying was true. He’s not his family. He’s different. We have what, three years of childhood stupidity behind us? It’s not like he’s a death eater or anything. Sure, his dad might be but he’s not. And he doesn’t want to be. Like I said, he’s not a blood purist. He doesn’t support everything his family has done. I know this sounds so cliche but it’s true; he’s changed.”
Ginny woke up and scurried off to her classes. She and Luna didn’t have any together since, she had found out, Luna was a fourth year.
The next student to enter was a Slytherin girl by the name of Judy. Judy walked up nervously and then dropped her name in. A great flame of blue fire rose up into the air when the parchment was dropped. Judy sprang back and let out a shriek. The entire Great hall -Ginny included- joined in uproarious laughter as the now blushing Judy scampered away. Judy, Wayne, and three other students were the only ones to (try to) enter .
I miss you so much dear! I do hope that things at Hogwarts are going well. Have you gotten into any danger yet? I hope the answer is no. By the way, have you made any friends yet? If not, I’m sure that being on the quidditch team will help. When are tryouts? I’d like to know so I can owl you some sort of good luck present. I’ve got so many questions for you. Like, how are Ron and Harry? Are they staying out of trouble? Are you staying out trouble? I hope so. Be safe!
Ginny sprinted down the Hogwarts halls. Her heart was racing, her head was pounding. A few times prefects told her to stop but she ignored them. Finally she had to stop running. She looked down and started panting. She realized she was gasping for air. Ginny clutch her side and tried to breathe. As soon as the pain stopped and she could breathe again, Ginny collapsed on the ground. She made sure the passage was isolated before she burst into tears.
Luna started weaving her wand through Ginny’s hair and whispered various charms. They sat in a comfortable silence for a while as Luna worked her magic. It was very calming and sweet.
Ginny didn’t really have anywhere to be so she decided to go to her dorm. There wasn’t much else to do. When she entered the common room, Hermione immediately rushed up to her.
She was excited but nervous for the “exclusive party” happening the night after. She hoped that whatever it was, it was good. Ginny knew that probably nothing bad would happen, her main concern was whether or not she’d make a good impression. She was a lot more comfortable around Luna now, and didn’t worry as much about whether or not she was awkward or making a bad impression. But she still worried sometimes and she tended to get really anxious about things. This was one of those things.
“Anytime,” Ginny replied. They walked back up to the castle and parted ways. Harry rushed off and said he had to go to the library. When she asked why, he said something about studying with Hermione. He looked oddly eager to study, though.
The rest of the night went well. They ate and talked and laughed. It was the perfect evening. Once Ginny was back in her dorm, all of her worries felt ridiculous. She told herself she wouldn’t worry about those things anymore, they weren’t practical fears. But she knew that the next time something like this happened, she would worry. It was exhausting sometimes.
“Now that we have everyone here, I’d like to make an announcement. I’m sure some of you have heard of the Triwizard Tournament, but most of you have not.”
“Woah! Slow down!” Ginny said with a laugh. Luna ignored her and continued to run through the store until they tripped and knocked down a display case. Ginny was blushing furiously after landing right on top of Luna. She could smell her breath they were so close. Luckily their moment was interrupted by the lady working the store.
“Ok,” she whispered. She looked into Luna’s eyes. They were so beautiful. She looked at her face and tried to memorize every bit of it. She wanted luna’s face to be etched into her mind. First, her eyes. They were big and beautiful. Then, her lips. They were a light pink. They looked so soft. Her cheeks, they were light red. Ginny realized that Luna had been blushing and awkwardly took a few steps backward. She didn’t want to make Luna uncomfortable. Even if she had been the one to close the gap between them... She noticed that Luna was blushing an even deeper red.
What will my parents think? She didn’t know. They had never said much on matter, but whether that was a good thing or bad, she didn’t know. She hoped they would be supportive but there was always that chance... ugh she didn’t know. That seemed to be the answer to everything, I don’t know. She curled up and cried softly for awhile as she tried to think through her thoughts.
That was another thing, Draco had started to hang out with Weasley and Granger. He wasn’t nearly as comfortable around them as he was with Harry, but he didn’t feel too awkward spending time with them as long as Harry was there.
Ginny paused, should she tell her mum about the letter? Maybe her mum could ask her brothers? It probably couldn’t hurt. She crumbled up the letter and threw it away. She decided to start over.
Ginny wondered if Luna knew that the forbidden forest was, well, forbidden. Judging by the tone of voice she used when talking about it she either (a, didn’t care, or (b, didn’t know.
“Why are you here? Want to know why I put my name in the Goblet of Fire do you?” Harry asked. His words were laced with venom and came out with more sass than she’d expected.
“That’s not all though, there is also money that you will be rewarded if you win.” Dumbledore looked across the students.
“Listen, Gin, I like you. As a sister. Ron’s sister. And I don’t want to hurt your feelings or anything but I don’t want to date you, or be your boyfriend, or have a secret romance, or anything like that. Ok?”
“Oh.” The admirer's voice had that familiar tone again… what was it? Suddenly it hit her. Luna. It was Luna’s voice.
Harry stumbled into the dragon’s inclosure. Ginny couldn’t quite make out what he was doing, since he was so far away. Then, something came whizzing through the air and Harry was flying. It was his broom! He flew in circles, faster and faster until the dragon was dizzy. He quickly snatched the egg and flew up high enough that the dragon couldn’t reach him.
When Ginny arrived she saw Fred and George standing by the Goblet of fire, holding glass vials full of a liquid.
“Now that everyone is here, I will start teaching you about this plant. Does anyone know what it is?”
She shuddered, worried that her dream would become a reality. But when she looked into Luna’s eyes, she saw kindness and understanding. Ginny grabbed the other girls hand and they walked out of the pub.
In charms they learned the cheering charm. They weren’t allowed to practice it in class though. Charms homework was to write a page on how the cheering charm was invented.
So I searched the castle until I found Potter. It took longer than expected as I didn’t actually know where Potter was and I didn’t know where he typically spent his time. (He ended up being by the lake with Weasley and Granger).
Ginny didn’t necessarily mind the letters, but they were odd. The idea that Fred and George had written them seemed pretty dubious now that she’d received another. Maybe she could meet the secret admirer? She wanted to know who it was pretty badly and she also wanted to tell the admirer she had feelings for someone else.
“Wait, Ginny. You didn’t let me finish. I’d rather stay here, in the owlery... with you,” Luna said quietly.
“What if I helped you sell them during the dinner at Hogwarts?” Ginny asked. She didn’t want the girl going around selling them but if she was with her then maybe she could at least stop some of the bullies from teasing her.
Ginny walked through Hogsmead and marveled at all the stores. On her way to The Three Broomsticks she saw a number of cool shops. There was one called Honeydukes, which had glass windows in the front, showing off rows and rows of different candies. There were chocolate frogs, exploding pepper snaps, Bertie Botts every flavor beans, and lots of others. She also saw one called Zonko’s joke shop, which showed shelves full of pranks and other random stuff for mischief. Eventually, she came to The Three Broomsticks and opened the door. Luna was sitting at one of the tables, looking out the window. Ginny slid into the seat next to her and Luna gasped.
Ginny had been working on a few spells. One of them changed a few strands of her hair black and another made it silky and soft. Once her hair was done she changed into her outfit. It was a suit she’d borrowed from Harry. They’d worked together to use spells that tailored it to fit her better. She was ready.
The only one to hold class as usual was Professor Snape. The teacher was a disfavorite among most, other than the Slytherins he so greatly favorited and also, Luna Lovegood. It was during potions that the twins finally decided to make their debut. Someone's voice (probably Lee’s) cried out through the halls, announcing the news. Everyone rushed out of class to watch, and for once the teachers didn’t stop them.
A few girls laughed and one whispered, “Loony loony Lovegood.” This sent the kids sitting next to them into another burst of giggles.
“I’m trying out. I’ve always loved playing quidditch, and I’d like to be on the team. What about you?”
She found out that Luna was in the Ravenclaw house, she loved selling the quibbler, that there were lots of creatures that most people were afraid of but Luna loved, and that she had a strange friendship with most of the Hogwarts teachers.
She had started rambling. Rambling! Ginny Weasley didn’t ramble! Or stutter! Or feel like butterflies were flying in her stomach whenever she talked to people or start feeling nervous. Well, she guessed she’d established that Luna made her do lots of things she didn’t normally do. But despite all of the nerves and stuttering, all Ginny wanted to do was spend time with Luna. “Oh no, Luna... she probably thinks I’m crazy or stupid or both,” thought Ginny. She looked up at Luna, expecting to see that she was weirded out or maybe that she pitied Ginny. But instead she saw a smile.
Ugh. Ginny liked most of her classes but Professor Binns made everything so boring. Herbology with Professor Sprout wasn’t too bad though.
When Ginny woke up, she was surprised to realize she felt well rested. There had been absolutely no nightmares the night before and she felt sort of peaceful. She quickly realized that she had to get to her classes, so got ready and sprinted down to the breakfast hall. Once again she cursed the founders for building the Gryffindor room so far away from everything! By the time she got to the great hall, students were already scrambling about, trying to get to classes. She sighed, grabbed a piece of toast, and ran off to her first class.
