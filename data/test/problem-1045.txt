Lily loves tummy time as long as she can see someone. She gets bored if she’s left on her own. Boredom leads to crying, and on a bad day, actual tears. Harry’s making faces at her as she does her best attempt at swimming on the rug. James had loved tummy time too, but Albus had hated it, grumbling the second he’d been put down, even if someone was around. Lily lifts her little head to look up at Harry, gurgling something important to Harry, and he coos at her in response. Seemingly satisfied, she drops her body back to the ground, continuing to chatter away to herself.
“Guess it’s only right to let you finish what you started.” His voice is pitched up a tone, higher than it usually is, like it gets when Draco starts to get desperate. Harry lets the grin cross over his face. Draco’s not looking so he can’t get annoyed at it, and Harry figures he’s allowed as much for getting Draco here so fast, so easily.
"Fuck this," Draco mutters, and then he has his wand in his hand, muttering an
“I’m busy,” Draco says automatically. “I need to study.”
"Must you
The house-elf looks just as unfriendly as he remembers, back hunched over and arms hanging by his sides. Harry can’t tell if he’s unhappy to see him, unhappy in general, or if that’s just his resting expression.
It's been so long since he's had this. The last time he shared a bed with someone was with Hermione and Ron and it wasn't like this. It's not for lack of options, which always makes Harry feel a bit shit when he thinks it, but it's true. He's not felt comfortable with another human being like this for longer than he'd like, since Ginny maybe, and that's a thought that feels sad, so Harry buries his head in tighter against Draco's neck. His friends are always trying to set him up with someone, but it never seems right. Besides, dating as the Chosen One has never really come easily. It's hard when there's a whole section of his life they'll never understand, could never understand, and sometimes when they try to it only makes things worse.
His boyfriend instantly relaxed, prompting a small smile on Draco’s face.
Harry’s blood was boiling. The
“As if you would have let me drag you out!” Harry laughed, starting the car. “Do you want to get a late lunch or something?”
So the instant that Harry closed the trunk of the car, Draco dragged him into one of the car’s blindspots and wrapped his arms tightly around his boyfriend’s shoulders in a hug. He felt Harry’s arms come around his waist just as securely, steadying him so he didn’t have to reach up as high. Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck, trying to memorize the smell of him, the feel of his body against his own. Harry’s fingers dug into his back with how tight he was holding, and Draco couldn’t have cared less. He carded his fingers through his boyfriend’s soft, raven black hair and pulled back just far enough to plant a kiss on Harry’s mouth.
just for my body?” he teased, despite the pressure building behind his eyes at Harry’s words. The atmosphere had stopped feeling so tense. It was lighter somehow, now that both of them seemed to ease into the feeling that they were completely safe with each other—not that they hadn’t been previously, but it hit differently somehow. It was new territory, this conversation, and safety was beyond important.
They walked at a lazy pace in no particular direction, there was still plenty of time before curfew came along. Outside was dark and cloudy through the windows. The corridor they were walking in was empty, it felt as if they were the only two people in the whole school, though Draco knew that if they turned a corner they were sure to find other students and professors and staff.
“I hear you’ve been giving your dad some grey hairs, mister,” Harry teased, letting his fingers wander over Teddy’s sides to tickle him.
Draco opened his mouth to protest not being told, but then seemed to realize where they were. His mouth instead opened in a smile, his shoulders shaking with laughter. “You’re taking me to the department stores?” Harry looked over at him with an almost shy smile on his face before looking back at the road to pull into the parking garage.
Draco’s lips twitched at the sides, an attempt at a smile, and that seemed to be enough for Blaise. He turned and faced the front of the classroom where Professor Vector was beginning class. Draco paid her no mind as he pulled out his cell, hiding it under his desk so the professor wouldn’t see.
the one who told
“Draco Malfoy, are you actually scared of a little threat from Seamus?”
“Tell me what to do, Hermione.” Draco was again struck by Ronald’s closeness, but decided that shoving him away would probably lead to some unwanted consequences in the near future. “Tell me what’s going on.”
His eyes felt as though they were boring into Draco’s, and his somber tone returned, even as there was still a crooked smile on his lips. “What do you feel?” Harry asked. “About having sex with me?”
“What are you
valid, Draco, and you can
It was only when Draco got past the fact that he was seeing Harry with no shirt on that he saw the scars. They weren’t the kind of scars that were overly noticeable. No, they looked old. The scars rained down on Harry’s back in lines, most vertical, but there were an odd few that were diagonal or even horizontal across his skin. There weren’t enough that they completely covered his back, but there were only a blessed few patches where the scars did not reach. There were three that looked like the worst, they were paler, more raised, more ragged and painful looking.
The boy raised his hand to stop Draco from babbling his heart out and embarrassing himself further, with laughter in his eyes and a smile on his face. It was just then that Draco noticed the glasses perched on his nose, that somehow made his eyes stand out further.
“Harry, I—” Draco choked. Harry looked back up at him. His cheeks were streaked with tears. His eyes were tinged red. “I can’t even imagine… I—” He stopped. Draco crawled across the small space between them and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck. The way he touched Harry was so light and cautious—like Draco was afraid that he might shatter in his hands. It brought tears to Harry’s eyes because he was
“How are you?” the older boy asked, “How is everything?”
“I-I, yeah. Yeah, I would really like that, Harry.”
Harry was still laughing when he got enough air to say, “At least you didn’t ask me, ‘What are you?’.” He smiled at Draco when he stopped chuckling.
“To get my car keys,” Harry laughed. “We’re going out to lunch, and you’re coming with us.”
“Oh? So you
“Hermione, I
in love with you.” Tracing the lines of Harry’s face with his pale fingers, Draco drew him even closer. “I need you to know that when you don’t feel safe, when you feel out of control or afraid or
Harry smiled at the words that were whispered threateningly in his ear.
“Oh, you’re definitely getting that one.”
“Honestly?”
“It’s nightmares,” Harry muttered. His hands moved to wrap around Draco’s waist, drawing him closer. “They’ve been bad for the past few days. I just thought that if… If I just exhausted myself during the day, I wouldn’t have any dreams at all.” Harry’s fingers tightened on Draco’s light sweater. He shifted his head so his face was buried in the crook of Draco’s neck, his warm breath fanning over Draco’s skin.
“I am not!” he sputtered indignantly. He stood up and strode to Harry, who was standing at his open locker, that smug smile turning soft and adoring. Without really thinking about it, Draco twined his long, pale fingers with Harry’s, relishing the warmth that spread through his body from even the smallest bit of contact. He closed his eyes as Harry laid his forehead against his own.
Dear readers, this took me three days, twelve hours of sleep, and two breakdowns to write. So I hope it's not complete trash. Just as a heads up, I have a lot going on right now with my school's musical, it's kicking my trash and I'm just slightly sleep-deprived. So I might not be able to post chapters as regularly as I have been. I hope you like the chapter!
He saw Harry’s throat move with how hard he swallowed before he answered, “Yeah, yes, I really want that.”
be coming back for a while there.”
Harry knew he’d have to meet Draco’s parents eventually, just like he’d hoped that Draco would meet Sirius and the rest of his makeshift someday soon.
in his hair.
Draco’s heart twisted. His chest contracted, his stomach dropped.
He immediately curled into himself, his body stuttering with his quick and uneven breaths. The muscles that lay under Harry’s skin were still unbelievably taut. His hand clutched at his chest. And yet, Draco could feel that he was less panicked than he had been before, without the collective panicked energy from the common room.
He just didn’t know if Draco wanted it too.
Harry couldn’t resist the urge to roll his eyes. “Just shut up and kiss me, you ass.”
Draco was currently walking towards the Great Hall for lunch when he saw Harry. Pansy seemed to follow his line of sight from beside him and shoved him in Harry’s direction. He turned back to glare at her, but she just nodded her head in Harry’s direction as her eyes said
Anyway, I hope you liked the chapter!! I really hope it will satisfy you for the few weeks I won't be able to update. Comments are always amazing!!
If the racing of his heart and reluctance to let go was anything to go by, he very clearly was not.
he realized. Hermione leaned toward him from where she sat beside them, gripping his forearms and helping Harry sit up. The movement alone made Harry’s chest ache fiercely, biting back his wince.
The blond boy’s pale skin flushed pink as he replied, “Yeah. I mean, if you want to.”
As if in answer, Draco’s phone pinged.
“I just… I need this.”
Though he was sure he’d regret it later, Draco turned and snapped with quiet fire in his voice, “Well don’t just
He stayed like that until he heard the water shut off and Harry stepped out. He set his chin on his hands and watched his boyfriend—clad only in a towel slung low on his hips—walk toward him.
As she closed the door after she got in the car, Draco watched as Harry did as he was told. And at that moment, watching Harry’s muscles constrict with his movements, he realized that he wouldn’t be seeing his boyfriend for nearly a week. Of course, they’d gone days without being able to see each other before, what with Harry’s football games and practices, and Draco’s extensive homework, and the need for sleep.
Her shoulders were shaking with both laughter and tears. Harry smiled softly, as he hunched over a little to place his chin on her head.
Harry: I’ll be at your common room as soon as I can
“I love you, Harry.”
“Why do you only wear glasses on some days, and not on others?” Draco asked as he approached, and sat down in the chair across the table from him. “How do you see without them?”
to all of us for the past three months! Not just to me, either. Hermione, Draco, all of us. It’s not just about what you said to me anymore!” Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. “You got back together with Lavender, of all things! Do you not remember how
And yet, there was a part of Harry’s mind that retained the fact that he could get caught if he snuck out, he could get detention—or possibly suspended—if he was caught by the wrong professor. However, he knew the school like the back of his hand, had a schedule of the teachers’ night patrols and a map of the school from the Weasley twins, and it wouldn’t be the first time he’d snuck out of bed after curfew. He hadn’t been caught then, it wasn’t likely he’d be caught this time.
He looked hesitant. “Just… hit it?”
Draco isn’t the same person that he was, Ron, and you would know that if you’d bothered to take your head out of your ass. If you’d just listened to what Hermione was trying to tell you—” Harry cut himself off, trying to swallow past the lump in his throat. “We could have avoided all of this
“Harry,” Draco muttered, “promise me something.”
He practically felt the wheels in Hermione’s mind turning. With each passing second, the silence grew like thorns in Harry’s chest and over his entire body. Thorns that pricked at his skin and demanded that he pay penance.
“Oh, shut up and walk me back to my common room, you ass.” Draco chose to ignore the boisterous laughter that burst from Harry’s mouth, (the same mouth that had kissed him, the same mouth that had been on his, on his skin, his neck) and instead got off the bed and turned his back to Harry, searching for his shirt.
Though he knew Sirius was right, Harry couldn’t help but feel an intense sort of apprehension at even the thought. Not wanting to ruin his good mood, he instead focused on his surroundings, the warm atmosphere that had settled over the people he called family.
. Draco was slightly shocked at his own thinking, the possessiveness that curled around his thoughts. But, he realized that he
Harry didn’t even try to deny it. “Would you be okay if… If I
His mind eventually started drifting to what was waiting for him in that abandoned classroom. Draco hadn’t actually said what they were doing, but with the way he’d asked, Harry was sure he had an accurate idea. He just wasn’t sure he was exactly on board. Of course, he thought Draco was attractive, he was absolutely
That’s what made Draco stop and think.
“Oh. My.
Draco hesitated. “I mean... I don’t know. I guess.” His tongue darted out over his lips, his hands twitched where they lay on Harry’s thighs. “I just—don’t want to feel like I don’t know what I’m doing, or that I can’t—that you don’t want someone who doesn’t know how to—”
The sleepiness that had plagued both Harry’s mind and body immediately dissipated. “Dray, what’s wrong?”
“Harry!”
Ron stopped a few feet away from Harry, his hands shoved into his pockets, his blue eyes scanning the face of each person that had fanned out to stand on either side of Harry before settling on the man himself. Concentrating on taking deep, even breaths, Harry met his gaze. The contempt that Harry had grown familiar to seeing there was strangely absent, the scorn and condescension that had grown in place of their friendship appeared to have withered.
“What do you want, Ron?”
The worst part of dinner had been sitting between his father and his great aunt Iris.
skin. The nervousness and anxiety that had strangled Harry quickly dissipated, replaced by burning indignation that he felt deep in his bones. He found himself straightening his spine and lifting his chin, staring not at the father of his boyfriend, but at the man who had taught Draco those awful words. The man who had used those words like they were
“Don’t say it, please.” Harry stopped at the doorway to the locker room, gazing down into his boyfriend’s saddened grey eyes. “‘Sorry’ doesn’t change anything, baby. I appreciate the sentiment, though. Really.”
flowers. Since that night he’d told Draco about his parents, his past, his family, he’d been drawing lily flowers. He’d been painting them: Easter lilies, water lilies, daylilies, oriental lilies, calla lilies, trumpet lilies, even lily-of-the-valley. Draco had created pages and pages of lilies, every single one was different and more breathtaking than the last. They were all different colors, different vibrancies, and hues. Each was a different shape, with a different story held within its petals and leaves. When Harry had first seen them, his heart had skipped a beat. His smile had stretched so wide his cheeks ached and his eyes had pricked with tears, he was so unbelievably happy. He’d scooped Draco into his arms and peppered his face with kisses, bathing in the laughter that came from his boyfriend. He’d kissed his artist’s hands, his long, pale fingers. And since then, Draco hasn’t stopped drawing them)
“I…” Harry started, his voice rough and so low that only Draco could hear, “like… that one.”
Though he didn’t specify, Harry knew what Draco was thanking him for.
The fear that had plagued his mind had been successfully transformed into pure adrenaline, running through his veins and bouncing around in his stomach. Harry jumped up from the bench with a grin and reached out a hand to Theo.
“Are you only just now noticing?”
An abrupt pained groan escaped Harry’s lips. Every muscle lining his body tensed even farther, so taut that Draco was afraid they might rip apart. Immediately, Hermione leaned back into Harry so that her lips were practically pressed against his ear, whispering words under her breath to him in the darkness of the room.
Draco felt a giddy smile spreading his lips as he put his hands on Harry’s shoulders, sliding them up to link behind his neck.
So, spread-eagled across his bed, Draco stared at his phone, waiting for Harry to be done with football practice and answer the texts he’d sent.
Sorry I'm late on the update, guys. With Christmas and all my drama going on, it's been hard to find time to write. But, I did it, and better late than never. So, I hope this isn't complete trash, and that you guys enjoy it.
“Really? You’re asking me in the middle of class?”
Fondly shaking his head, Harry caught up to Draco and laced his fingers through his boyfriend’s free hand. The miffed pout on his pink lips could have easily been one of the most adorable things Harry had ever seen. Gently, he leaned down and pressed a soft, tender kiss to Draco’s mouth, smirking at how he chased for more.
All Ron knew was that Harry had slept with his sister, and never taken it any farther. Harry hadn’t bothered to tell him any of the rest of it, he knew Ron wouldn’t believe it coming from his mouth. It seemed that Ginny thought the same.
His thoughts drifted to Harry, and he walked faster in hopes of being able to return sooner.
“You’re shirt’s right there,” Harry laughed.
arousing
Harry’s previously shocked face turned into one of anger and resentment. “What’s my deal?” he started, his voice deathly quiet, “Are you telling me that you’re not completely racist? That you haven’t used awful words against people who don’t deserve it?” Harry’s voice had gradually gotten louder, and Draco’s already pale face had gone even more so. Harry took a few steps towards Draco, who stepped back until he was at the wall. Harry didn’t come much closer, as if he couldn’t stand to be in such small proximity to him.
“Everything is
Harry grinned as she gave a long-suffering sigh. “You’re lucky I love you, Harry Potter.” Draco felt a twinge in his chest, he knew it was stupid, she didn’t mean it like
Though he nodded in answer, Draco knew that there would be no stopping tonight. He bathed in the way that his boyfriend looked at him—like he was in awe, like he was in love, like there was nowhere else he would rather be. With his feet, Draco pulled down Harry’s briefs as far as he could, letting his boyfriend do the rest.
Harry took in all the vibrant colors and hues of the sunset. He could easily imagine them on a canvas that Draco had painted, stained on his long, pale fingers and the old, ragged t-shirt he’d stolen from Harry to paint in.
“I’ll damn well confess my undying love to you whenever and wherever I feel like it.” Closing the small distance between them, Draco caught Harry’s full bottom lip in his teeth, attempting to pull him in to kiss him—deeply and unrestrained. However, Harry only laughed and gave him a subdued peck.
have morning breath, you cretin!”
“I’ll see you around, Ron.”
If there was one time that Draco was grateful to be as thin and lean as he was, it was when the football stands were absolutely packed. He was able to easily weave through people to keep the best view of Harry, ignoring the disgruntled looks he received. The final championship game had drawn the biggest crowd Draco had seen—students from both Hogwarts and Castelobruxo, the other competing school, family members, staff, and people who Draco was sure had absolutely no connection to either school and simply wanted to watch a football game.
Harry sat down on his bed with his head in his hands. Draco’s heart was beating double-time, his fingers were fidgeting.
Sweat dripped down Harry’s body, soaking his t-shirt. His heartbeat was almost loud enough to his own ears to drown out Snape’s voice. The muscles in his arms, back, and abdomen were burning; not enough to be painful, it was more of a pleasant distraction from his thoughts. He loved the rush that exercise always provided him, loved how he almost always got a restful night afterward, loved knowing that he was making himself stronger.
“You just want to get into my sleep pants.”
Harry wants to ask if Draco has the same bad dreams.
There’s not much he can do to answer that. The added height of the bench makes Harry have to look up at him more than the usual couple of inches Draco has on him. It’s too much, Draco’s eyes focusing on him and seeing. Harry feels overwhelmed by it all, by the closeness, and the disaster that wasn’t still has his heart racing and his body ready for a fight that isn’t happening. Draco’s still looking at him, Harry still has his hands on Draco’s hips, Draco’s hands are still on his shoulders, and
“It’s not that,” Draco insists, because it’s not. He’s wanted Harry for as long as he can remember. It’s like one of those invisible truths, as soon as you realise there’s no denying it, and it’s almost impossible to remember a time when he
Draco groans, the sound rumbling through his chest, and then Harry feels the hot spurts against his stomach and chest. He lets his hand go loose, lets Draco guide the movements as he strokes himself through it, longer than Harry would for his own orgasms. He files that piece of information away for the future, and hopes he’ll get a chance to use it.
It all helps.
"That was not nice," Harry says, feeling a little indignant in the face of Draco’s laughter. Draco has placed his own glass back on the bench and is hunched forward, forearms braced against his knees. Harry thinks he can see a shine to his eyes. Harry's face is red now, but at least his erection has flagged a little in the wake of his blunder and Draco’s obvious entertainment.
with the house, when he doesn’t know if there really is. And maybe he’s getting a little caught up in this, maybe it’s not the house at all he’s thinking about when he insists that,
"I could, but then it wouldn't be the same item." Draco says, with a wave at the dismantled box in front of it. "If I were to do that, it's not really repairing, just wiping away the traces to make my own item."
"I think you’ll need to set some boundaries with him if you want to stay sane." Draco’s hand finds Harry’s back, rubbing the muscles there. Harry can’t help the moan that slips from his lips, doesn’t even try. Draco’s always been good at this, always knows just how to touch, his fingers working a special sort of magic. He wouldn’t mind feeling what else Draco could do with his hands.
for once, and holds Draco still as Harry closes the distance between them to kiss Draco again. It feels right like this, and as much as looking up at Draco had been nice, this feels better, lining up to meeting Draco in the middle. Draco can sit in his lap another time, and Harry groans at the thought, opening his lips. Draco flicks his tongue just a little and it's enough for Harry, to open his mouth wider and lick his way into Draco's mouth.
"What is this?" Harry asks, as Draco pulls the door closed and taps it with his wand. There's a work bench that looks exactly like the one Draco had been sitting at only a moment before.
seriously. Harry thinks if he’d been a Muggle he would have been the sort of person to check his star signs every morning, reading them in the back pages of the daily paper before moving onto all the boring things like stocks and exchanges.
Draco's a little bit taller, something Harry's known from working with him, but like this it's more obvious, the way Harry has to tip his head up to look at Draco's lips. It's not something he's had to do before, not in his limited experience, and there's something about it that makes Harry's blood run hot. He's not done this before, and he stalls, hands still at his sides, and he wants to put them on Draco, but isn't sure how, isn't sure of anything.
in front of someone that eases the way, and it might not be Harry’s favourite part of the job, but it brings him satisfaction to give a resolution to those affected. He knows better than most that it won’t bring back the dead—dead's dead, and not even justice will ever change that—but it helps those they leave behind.
“I wasn’t—”
Harry can feel Draco’s glare from beside him, he ignores it.
From his position in the doorway Harry can't see anyone, only the organised clutter of the shop. Every space as far as Harry can see is occupied with rows of cabinets filled with various items. There's everything from jewellery and plates to furniture, and an old grandfather clock stands along the far wall. There are lights hanging from the roof, and even what looks like wrought iron fencing leaning against a balustrade.
"They’re having fun," Harry agrees, watching as Draco stirs in the sugar for the tea. "Everyone seems to be having fun, don’t you think?" There’s a neediness in his voice, a need for confirmation that this is going well, that someone else thinks it’s going well too.
is what they could be doing instead. Harry spreads his legs wider to allow Draco to move closer, pressing their cocks together. It feels amazing, the hard pressure of it, and Draco has to break the kiss to gasp out when Harry thrusts again.
Draco bursts out a laugh.
Should he make his excuses and leave now? Should he ask what they're doing? What this is?
— even after years of the most expensive tutors his father could hire.
The shop looks wholly unassuming from the outside. Harry's not even sure what it is really. There's a sign that says
, not good, and definitely not excellent.
There's only one way to find out.
“I didn’t think so.” It’s almost a whisper, and it pulls Draco up short
Harry takes the moment to look at Draco now after six months of not seeing him. He's sitting at a desk, head bent down over his work, and even from here Harry can see the cup of tea by his left hand. It's familiar in a way that sends warmth through his stomach. That's where the familiarity ends though.
The moment he’s in bed it feels like it all catches up to him, and he’s suddenly exhausted. His eyes heavy and falling shut almost of their own accord, Harry can feel himself slipping off to sleep.
"Your artistry?" Harry asks, pointing to the book.
Harry moves to the wall by the doorframe and Draco follows, sliding in beside him. He waits there a moment, readying himself for what he might find. Despite what his fellow Aurors may think, Harry knows to wait before rushing in. He always waits for his partner to be ready, and when Draco taps at his forearm, that's all the sign he needs.
, people who can see him.
"Just because you don't understand it." Draco rolls his eyes. "Divination is an important area of magic. Prophecies are one of the strongest magics out there."
The shop is empty, or empty enough.
It's like the floodgates are open, and that should scare Harry—he's never been good at initiating things—but it doesn't feel like there's anything he has to do at this stage. He just has to let himself go along with it, and see what happens. Maybe that's naïve or delusional, but either way, Harry holds on to it, uses it to get himself through the dinner, with Draco looking like he does while Harry wants, wants, wants.
He tries to ignore the disappointment he can see on Harry’s face at that, and keeps his eyes focused on the curve of the letter instead, at how his hand is covering up most of the mark he knows rests there.
Draco doesn’t know when it became something more, when the tension changed, mostly because for him, it had always been there.
He drowns the thoughts out with action, shrugging the shirt from his shoulders and throwing it across the room, no longer caring about the damn
Draco starts walking, and Harry falls behind him. It's comfortable, even in the silence, and Harry just... lets himself enjoy it. The weather is nice, and he can see the moon, even if the streetlights are too much for him to see the stars. The sounds of the town, of people
"Add a little class to that joint?" Harry asks.
"You can dry up," Harry says, placing the first plate on the drying rack.
"What was that?" He places the glass down, staring at the glass with some resentment.
Harry does his best to push it down.
Harry winces at the memory, but Draco, who’s looking away, doesn’t catch it. He’s hopeful all the Boggarts have since vacated the premises, but if they still lurk in the corners, two Aurors are more than qualified to handle them.
"Regulus is with him," Draco mumbles. "We can take a moment."
He pulls at Draco’s hip, offering a “Turn over.” Draco is already moving, rolling underneath him, legs brushing against the inside of Harry’s thighs.
Draco’s hands come up to Harry’s hips as Draco steps towards Harry, crowding into him. This close, Harry can make out the freckles painted across Draco's cheekbones. His gaze moves from Draco’s cheeks to his eyes. They’re not actually grey, he notices, or not
Maybe he doesn't need to know the answers right this moment.
Moody will be turning in his grave.
is the word that comes to mind, although Harry would never admit it to Draco. Even if Draco doesn't run the miles anymore, he is still perfectly capable of taking Harry out.
. Some of the information said the houses had been around since Merlin's age. Nobody even knew how many there were; although technically the Ministry required that sentient houses be registered, it was suspected that many families kept their existence to themselves. The information Hermione found was more about instances when the houses had gone
Draco shakes his head, turning his attention back to his book, even as the words blur before him.
"What does that mean?" Harry asks, turning to Draco.
“Can we at least talk about it?” Harry asks, and he sounds tense, like a string stretched taught. “I think you owe me that?”
is holding Draco down, feeling the way Draco tries to push up underneath his hands, but can’t. With his other hand he takes Draco in hand, stroking him lightly, a barely-there pressure all the way from his base to his head and back down again. Holding Draco’s head firm, he ducks down to take Draco into his mouth.
feeling awkward now. He’d not really thought about what it would be like having Draco around his house. Weird apparently, but there’s not much he can do about that now.
"Of course."
Draco sets Lily down next to him, and a pillow on her other side so she doesn’t roll. She scrunches her face up and makes a little grumble, hands coming up beside her little head. Harry rolls onto his side, turning to face Lily, and he slides his hand up, putting a finger in her hand. She squeezes onto it immediately, tiny fingers gripping hold so tight.
"I didn’t ask you to clean this up."
"How kind of you," Harry says sardonically, holding the door open with one foot as he leans down to pick up the pot. It’s a very Draco pot, smooth and white, and it matches the colour of the flower. It looks like a pot that would belong in Draco’s flat, but it feels out of place in Harry’s house. He’s not sure where it should go, and he settles for placing it on the coffee table in the living room.
to do to Draco. He gives his cock a squeeze that is as much to relieve a bit of the pressure and try to tell it
He doesn’t know where his life’s going. He’s not got a five year plan to win the Quidditch World Cup like Ginny, or a goal of making Minister for Magic like Hermione, or aspirations of a family like Ron. He’s still working on that, or not working on that, as it might be. His lack of direction seems to be contagious, spreading from life and career goals to living situations, led him to going along with others, shacking up with Ginny to start with, and then living with Ron and Hermione when that hadn’t worked out. Staying with them was only ever meant to be temporary, a stopgap until Harry had his own place. It’s just that it never seemed to happen, and somehow Harry stayed there, right up until Ron had shown him the ring. That had been enough of a wakeup call for Harry, sent him packing his bags and throwing open the doors to Grimmauld Place again.
Even with the disclaimer it feels loaded, and Harry stands out the front of the shop and tries to work out if he does.
It’s easier instead to deepen the kiss, flicking his tongue out to lick at Harry’s lips, who for once actually takes the direction, opening his lips to allow him access. When Harry deepens the kiss he tastes like the pasties they were eating in the common room, Butterbeer, and something spicy that Draco can’t place. It’s a bit weird and it’s a bit delicious and Draco just wants more, wants everything from Harry now.
The bed is already warm, like the Heating Charms Draco favoured even though Harry’s never bothered. And even the sheets feel the same, the softness that speaks of high thread counts that Harry had never cared about, but Draco loved. If he closes his eyes, he can almost imagine it’s their bed, can almost smell the familiar scent of Draco on the sheets.
Harry moves, lightning quick like he is on the Quidditch pitch, trapping Draco with his own body. Draco feels like the Snitch, heart fluttering in his chest, as he quivers under Harry’s gaze, with Harry’s hands coming up to hold tight at his arms, capturing him and cutting off his exit ― not that Draco would ever want to. When Harry finally drops his head to bring their lips together Draco breathes a sigh of relief against his lips. He’s rapidly becoming addicted to Harry’s lips.
the older person here.
, but Ron and Hermione have their own lives to deal with, after all. Besides, Harry is an adult now, and really, he should be able to make decisions for himself.
Hermione interrupted his thoughts with a raised brow in his direction. “Well? I’m not going to stand around here wasting my time waiting for you to put two words together, Malfoy,” she hissed.
“Whenever I did something Vernon didn’t like, he would lock me in the cupboard under the stairs for a few hours. That was basically where I lived. He’d shout at me and hit me. But when he was really angry…” Harry paused, looking down at Draco’s fingers tangled with his own. He took a deep breath. “When he was really angry he’d make me take off my shirt, and he’d hit me with his belt.”
“Mr. Potter, it is no wonder that you have so few brain cells. If you cannot refrain from using your cell phone in class, I will take great pleasure in taking it and giving you detention.”
The flush in Draco’s face spread to his ears. “You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.”
After getting their luggage and successfully shoving it into the trunk of the taxi, Harry was finally allowed to admire Draco’s face once again.
“Hermione, have I ever told you how amazing you are?” Harry said in jest. Hermione snickered as she flipped her curly hair over her shoulder and replying, “No, I don’t believe you have. Now would be the perfect time to do so.” She made to walk out the door before Harry gasped and said in a rush, “Wait, wait, wait!”
Draco wasn’t looking him in the eye as he spoke, instead choosing to stare at the floor. Harry’s heart was in his throat as he watched his boyfriend walk away with Theo and Blaise trailing behind him. Theo looked over his shoulder at the Great Hall’s doorway, shooting Harry a glare that reminded Harry of when they’d talked before Harry took Draco on their first date. He looked downright
A woman abruptly appeared from behind a shelf of canvases, no older than twenty, her curly red hair messily tied back in a high ponytail, a paint-splattered apron wrapped around her slender hips. There were a few smears of paint on her grey t-shirt and on her thin, pretty face. The nametag on her shirt read
When he finally managed to disentangle himself from Harry and walk into class, Draco felt that familiar warmth that came from simply being near his boyfriend begin to fade, until all that remained was an ember at the bottom of his heart. However, he wasn’t able to stop smiling throughout the entire hour of boring lectures and homework assignments.
“And what,” Harry felt the vibration of Draco’s voice in his chest as he spoke, the sensation soothing and pleasant, “were you thinking of doing, exactly? Because if it’s not absolutely amazing, it’s not worth leaving this couch.”
“I was
Harry seemed to sense his train of thought. “He begged his mum for weeks to have his hair the same color as hers. The dye is designed to only last a few months, but it hasn’t washed out yet. He’s probably keeping it in with his own stubbornness,” he laughed. Harry swiped across the phone to a new picture, this one of him holding a baby wrapped in a purple blanket in a hospital room. “That’s Astrid, his little sister. Tonks and Remus only had her about nine months ago.”
in front of his boyfriend for the first time. His face was swept with a new wave of scarlet. He felt his fingers twitch. He knew for certain that he wasn’t bad-looking. But he wasn’t… Harry’s level of good-looking. (Harry was the type of handsome that was obvious. He was the kind of handsome that had you looking twice and then staring for as long as possible until he looked in your direction. Draco was sharper in his beauty, he was more fine-boned, thin and lean. He was the type of handsome that wasn’t obvious at first glance. He was the sort of handsome that had you analyzing his features, trying to figure out what it was about him that was appealing.)
Screw off, you
and tightened his fingers on his waist, tight enough to leave bruises, a new vigor in the way he was sucking on Draco’s skin. His tongue smoothed over every bite, his mouth was soft and hot.
“Oh please, you’ve hardly even touched your plate. You’ve been too busy texting Terry,” Draco quipped. Pansy’s mouth dropped open in protest, but her phone pinged. Her attention immediately shifted to her cell as she typed away. Theo laughed from Draco’s other side, Blaise sniggering from beside her.
Draco’s mouth had gone dry. His tongue had felt like sandpaper. Lucius had mentioned universities before, but he’d never said anything about already having chosen where Draco would supposedly attend. “Father, I was looking more at—”
He wanted more of Harry’s hands on him, more of his mouth, tongue, teeth, and skin. So, Draco pulled him down into a kiss by the back of his neck and crossed his ankles over the small of Harry’s back, drawing his body closer until every inch of them was pressed together. He soaked in the warmth that radiated from Harry. He ran his hands over every muscled plane of his body, drinking in the guttural noises that came from his boyfriend and gave his own in response.
“Hermione, Harry… Can we talk for a minute? Please?”
“What’s
“He walked you back here and you didn’t introduce us?” Theo asked in mock offense. Pansy had chuckled even harder at that, her face flushed a bright pink.
“Where are we going?” Theo asked, nearly shoving Pansy off his lap and into the window to get closer to them. Draco looked around his seat just in time to see her violently smack him upside the head. His hand went to his hair and he turned to her with wide eyes and his brows drawn together.
Hermione interrupted his thoughts with a raised brow in his direction. “Well? I’m not going to stand around here wasting my time waiting for you to put two words together, Malfoy,” she hissed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I promised I would, sweetheart.” The smaller boy wound his arms around the other and placed another kiss on his nose. Those green eyes were gazing intently at him, a light in them that hadn’t been there when Draco had left. He lifted his hand and traced the contours of his face. “Where’d Hermione go?”
Harry turned and grinned, “Probably.”
“Shut up, Blaise,” Draco grumbled, slowing to a stop at the front doors of Hogwarts.
The sun had set by the time Hooch had let the team go. Every muscle, joint, and bone in Harry’s body ached, even as Hermione sat behind him on the couch and rubbed at the muscles in his shoulders. Pansy sat in front of him on the floor with her head tilted back so he could braid her hair. Blaise and Theo were sprawled on the floor beside them, Theo’s head in Pansy’s lap. The northern common room was surprisingly quiet, only a few murmuring voices around them.
“I suppose I should just start at the beginning,” Harry said quietly, trying to prevent anyone from overhearing. “You know Ron, yeah?”
Harry had had a smile on his face throughout all his Monday morning classes. Dinner on Saturday evening had made everything just that much better. Draco had brought his friends to sit with him and Hermione, and everything had been perfect. Even when Harry had caught Ron glaring at all of them from down the table, Harry just intertwined his fingers with Draco’s under the table and watched him as he talked excitedly with his friends; he’d even talked to Hermione on more than one occasion. Draco’s hand was a little cold, but Harry didn’t mind.
look at either of them. The problem was that Ron
The deafening uproar from the stands gave Draco goosebumps as he cheered with them. A sense of unquenchable pride filled his lungs and then Draco was racing down to the field, his vision tunneled on Harry’s handsome, appalled face as he was being surrounded by his teammates, each of them shouting and slapping Harry on the shoulder, hugging him and grinning.
“I swear I will sit on you if you try to leave this bed without sleeping for at least a solid two hours.”
The water was hot on Harry’s skin as he rushed through his shower, attempting to get out of the locker rooms and to his dorm as fast as possible. He didn’t think he could handle the disappointed looks of his teammates on top of the lost game. It wasn’t their first loss with him as captain, but this was the game they’d spent hours upon hours training for. This was the game everyone had been looking forward to
to tell you all about it,” Harry laughed, “just for the sake of embarrassing both of us even more.”
“Do you want to tell me about what happened last night?” Harry whispered, pressing his lips to Draco’s temple. Carding his fingers through his blond hair, Harry gently kissed his way down Draco’s face to his jaw, craning his head to reach Draco’s neck, burying his face there. He felt Draco’s deep breath as his smaller chest moved against his own.
“When are you guys going out?” Pansy asked.
kitten?”
with him.
Breathing came easier. His heart slowed to its usual steady beat.
He swallowed thickly before answering lowly, “Got it.”
“No, lie to me.”
“Harry,” Pansy started again, “I know this is supposed to be some tender, peaceful moment. But I just think you should know that I think I almost broke my finger on your abs.”
So, walking as quickly as possible, Harry rushed out of the locker rooms through the back exit, into the school, through the halls, and into his common room.
Harry smirked, and he knew that talking back to the teacher was a bad idea, but- “If I have only half a brain, Professor, surely you, as the professor, would be much better suited to helping Neville? Or any other student who has already finished with the project?” Harry gestured to his own beakers in front of him, and the worksheet that he had already finished. He knew that he had improved in chemistry since he actually started studying with Hermione, and he knew that it bothered Snape to no end.
“No, seriously!” Pansy punctuated this by poking Harry’s stomach with her finger, making him laugh harder. The jabbing at his stomach was soon followed by prodding at his arms and shoulders. “It’s like he’s packing rocks in there!”
“How did you even know?” Draco’s entire being
Draco looked her square in the eyes. “I’m truly sorry for what I said to you, Hermione, and for the pain that I’ve caused you.”
“Theo, I hope you’re ready to work your ass off training because we have to get you in shape to go to the championship games. With Beauxbatons disqualified, we’re back in for the running.”
“You’re an asshole,” Draco growled. Moving around on his bed, Draco shifted so he was sitting upright against the wall, his blanket like a warm cocoon around him. The scowl on his face surely matched the bitter taste in his throat.
to feel those fingers against his face, his lips, to feel them brushing the skin on his waist, and-
“Alright.” Draco released Harry’s hands and stood from the table even as Harry released a relieved breath. “I’ll meet you at your common room half an hour after classes end.”
he could hear Harry breathing on the other end of the phone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Finally, Pansy took a deep breath and began, “Well…”
“Harry,” Sirius said, “you don’t have to. I’ll take care of everything. I’ll get in contact with Petunia, see if I can convince her to give me Lily’s things. I’ll do
Hermione knew full well how Harry had been raised. It wasn’t a pretty story, filled with baby pictures, pastel rainbows, birthday parties, and fond memories. She could still remember the day she’d met him, when they had both been eleven, on the first day of school. Harry had been small, concerningly skinny, and couldn’t make direct eye contact with anyone. He’d been so… reduced. Diminished.
Harry seemed to sense the stopping, as he started nervously rambling, “I know it’s pretty fast, really fast, actually, but I just thought that maybe it was something you wanted because Pansy told Hermione that you really liked me and she told me that I should stop fantasizing and just ask you and oh my hell this was such a bad idea.”
“...crossed so many lines, Ron. For how long we’ve been friends, you should’ve known better. You should’ve listened to some
Taking the phone from his ear, Draco hung up. His hand fell to his lap. He seemed… numb. Harry pushed himself up into a sitting position, reaching out for him but giving him plenty of time to pull away. Draco allowed himself to be pulled against Harry’s chest, halfway in his lap.
Releasing his hold on the smaller boy’s shirt, Harry kissed his forehead and whispered, “I’m fine. Go to sleep, baby, I’ll wake you up before curfew.” Seeing Draco’s soft, tired smile made Harry smile in return. With his eyes still closed, Draco leaned his face up to Harry’s, as if asking for a kiss. Harry gave a low chuckle before obliging his boyfriend with a delicate press of his lips on his, and another on his nose, and his forehead, drawing a hushed giggle from the blond boy’s mouth before he settled back into Harry’s body; he tightened his arms, settled one leg across Harry’s, wrapping his entire body around the other boy’s.
“Mr. Potter, care to explain what you’re doing out and about at this time of night?” came the telltale voice of someone who was most
Harry…”
There had been voices. Harry hadn’t been able to make out the words, or who they belonged to, but the voices had started to break through the darkness he’d been drowning in. The fear hadn’t left him, but Harry could feel its grip subsiding.
Harry wraps it tighter still, pulls Draco in as close as he can, and Draco makes a little sleepy groan and nuzzles in closer. It’s not something Harry would usually initiate, but he finds himself leaning into it, finding comfort in the feeling of someone else beside him. He's content just to lie with Draco, even if he can’t fall back asleep again.
Harry buries his head into Draco’s neck as he comes, stroking himself through the orgasm.
There's no Kneazle in sight, but there's also no point standing around in the door.
“A bit,” Draco admits. “Might take a nap later if she goes down. I forgot how horrible teething is.”
The door swings open and the breath Draco had been holding releases all at once when he sees the room. It’s still exactly as he remembers, the bookshelves in all the same places, and even though the air tastes musty and stale, Draco feels like it’s the first real breathe he’s taken since he saw the marks on Harry’s skin.
Draco hums a sound and takes another sip from his cup. "I am fairly sure," Draco says, arching an eyebrow, "that as the higher ranking officer, that’s exactly what I am."
Harry takes a deep breath, reaches out his hand—for the handle, a long one-piece thing, and there's still no sign of whether the shop is open or closed, but Harry pulls on it anyway.
"Move," Draco says again and steps forward, and this time Harry gets the point, walks his feet backwards along with Draco's.
Soft grey eyes turned to look at Harry. A feeling of calm and peace filled Harry’s chest, overwhelming each and every negative thought in his mind. Draco stepped closer and reached up to cup Harry’s face. The coolness of his boyfriend’s fingers tracing over the lines of his face made him feel even more at ease. Leaning into Draco’s hands, Harry wrapped his arms around the smaller boy, drawing him closer until their chests pressed together.
Harry could still hardly believe that the beautiful blond boy he’d met on a late-night plane had become his boyfriend. Although Draco still managed to use Harry’s shoulder as a pillow at breakfast, and whenever else they had the chance to sit down together, Harry felt that they had come a long way in such a short time. He knew that the progression of their relationship was fast, he
There was no way in hell he was going to classes tomorrow.
Shaking his head, Draco pulled his shirt over his head and tugged on his shoes. Harry opened the door to reveal a very tired and slightly ticked off Seamus Finnigan.
“Yeah. He’s like the best possible mix of a dad, roommate, and a best friend.”
Watching Harry on the field, watching him
The ball came racing towards him, and Harry let muscle memory take over. His mind went blank as he pivoted with the ball, feeling the seconds on the clock tick down in time with the beat of his hammering heart. He sensed each and every player behind him, he could feel them running after him. But he was already gone. Harry raced to the goal and without thinking he set up the shot—hoping,
“Very funny, Harry.”
“Oh,” Pansy interjected, “they were just fine until Draco made us late to first hour this morning.” Draco groaned, knowing what was coming next.
Draco’s heart would have stopped right there if his phone hadn’t started ringing next to his ear. Jerking it away from his face, he saw that it was Harry calling—only it was a video call, instead.
“Harry Potter. I love you, too.”
“And he
He felt Draco’s grip on his hands loosen, and his touch become soft and soothing rather than frantic.
Harry just hoped that it would be like that again.
Immediately, Draco straightened and untangled himself from his friends, confusion taking over.
had made the winning shot in those last few seconds that had won them the game.
Fingertips lightly skimmed over the bruised skin, bringing Draco back to the present. He could see the concern in his boyfriend’s green eyes, the unease, and sadness. Draco almost thought it was amusing, how Harry was more worried about it than he was. But instead of lingering on it, Draco watched Harry’s fingers drift down to the ties that kept the sweatpants on Draco’s hips.
He could feel his anger subsiding, his face softening, his muscles relaxing. It seemed like a plausible enough story, but Harry was still hesitant.
Draco shoved down the apprehension he felt before weaving his way through the murmuring crowd. With how little information Ronald had given him, his imagination had run wild. Images of blood and broken bones, perhaps a fight that had gone wrong, ran rampant through his mind.
in knowing, and yet Lucius seemed set on this idea that Draco would someday take over.
” Sirius shook his head with phony disappointment written across his face. “Really, Harry, it makes me feel old. You should know better.”
There was a pause on the other end of the phone, and Harry felt as though everything around him had frozen. He heard Draco sniff before he started talking again, his voice thicker than before. “I just…” Draco sounded like he was holding back tears, and Harry immediately jumped out of bed and scrambled to pull some clothes on. “I r-really need you, I n-need you to come get me, Harry,
The smile on Draco’s face was worth any risk of getting caught. Harry pecked his lips before turning to Blaise, who was looking at him with a knowing smirk and raised eyebrows.
“It’s okay,” Harry whispered back. “Just… take everyone else to your common room, I’ll meet you there.” He lowered his voice even further. “Keep an eye on Hermione for me, try to keep her talking, okay?”
Draco had basically grabbed Harry’s face and pulled him down to cover his mouth with his own. Harry seemed to freeze before he realized that Draco was kissing him. It took
Do I sense a new pet-name for Draco? I think I do. I hope you all liked it! Comments give me life, for real, so leave one! Like, seriously, I get all tingly and happy inside when I see that I have comments, so do it!
at his boyfriend. Taking in his gorgeous grey eyes—alight with the energy of the game, the sharp angles of his cheekbones, the defined lines of his jaw, the wide smile on his pink lips, the flush in his cheeks that crept up to his ears, the growing crinkle in his pert nose…
When he turned around, Harry took a deep breath, feeling the air wash through him, easing some of the tension his rigid body held.
Ron’s gaze immediately went to Harry’s bed, his entire body seemed to freeze. Harry clutched Draco closer to himself as Ron’s blue gaze turned cold, hard, nearly disgusted. The laptop was digging into his legs, the noise from the movie was the only sound. It was almost too loud for how tense the silence was.
Almost as if in response, Harry’s hand plunged into his own shirt, the feel of his fingers on his chest, his stomach, his waist, was intoxicating. Draco’s mind was swirling with the smell of Harry, with the taste of him. His boyfriend ran his hand up the curve of his spine, dragging his shirt with him and making him shudder.
He’d felt so disconnected from his body that when he felt his arms move, he hadn’t registered that someone was making him stand until they’d managed to get his feet on the ground. Feelings had slowly trickled in until the awareness of his body finally clicked and he was able to manage most of his own weight.
“Do you wanna stay tonight?” Harry whispered in his ear. It took Draco a moment to register the words. And promptly gasp at the first conclusion his addled mind jumped to.
Draco didn’t even have the chance to say the comforting words that had been on his tongue before Ronald stepped back into the room. Needless to say, his resentment toward the boy only grew.
“So what, just because Harry wants to get in this guy’s pants we’re supposed to forgive and forget?”
Hermione relaxed into him and said, “Yeah, yeah okay.”
Despite his facade of a complaint, Draco felt impossibly warm like this. His skin against Harry’s, the feel of him so close, with Harry’s arms wrapped around him and holding him to his chest, it all made him feel so
Harry was running on air, sprinting through the clouds. Not literally, of course. At the moment he was running off the football field, drenched in sweat and what he was sure was a stupid grin plastered on his face.
Both Draco and Harry’s heads whipped around to look at the source of the intruding voice—none other than Lucas Ferreira himself, walking towards them. Draco immediately felt his hackles rise. Up close, he could see that Ferreira was, unfortunately,
For the instant before Theo had to ball, Nicole darted in front of him and stole it, hurrying in the direction of Hogwarts’ goal which was guarded by Alicia. Harry’s stomach plummeted.
“Harry, no! Do you not remember how crushed Hermione was after what he said to her?”
Hopefully.
It was nearing midnight when Harry finally left his dorm room that night; he’d told Dean that he would be leaving, just in case. The easiest part was getting through the common room. The prefect on duty was always asleep by this time in his shift. So, Harry just walked past him.
Immediately, he was tugged toward them.
Harry could feel the stunned energy in the air. The tension that arose in Draco’s arms around him was more than enough to say how shocked he was. Hermione’s hand had stilled on his knee. Sirius had gone quiet over the phone.
Harry laughed and smirked as he said, “What, do I not look as ‘nice’ in the school uniform, Draco?”
A delicate, tender smile shone on Draco’s face. If he hadn’t been sopping wet—not to mention naked, though he wasn’t sure he minded that part very much—he might’ve wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and peppered kisses all over his face.
Pansy seemed to have caught on to his anxiousness when she jabbed him in the ribs in the middle of the lesson in English.
Rather, it was the feeling of hope that made Draco smile. No matter how many bad days lay in their future, they could always rise with the sun the next morning and make something better.
And then he saw the face he was looking for. Draco’s face. He was in the bottom row of the stands, closest to the field. Harry was sure that his grin widened as they made eye contact, and Draco started making his way down to the field. Harry didn’t even notice that Pansy and Blaise had been next to Draco.
Draco planted his hands on his hips, “Why haven’t you texted me back? Weren’t
that his aim wouldn’t fail him.
Harry got up on the bed, sitting on his heels, never taking his mouth off of Draco’s as he followed him. He could feel the bigger boy’s chest heaving with uneven breaths.
“Can I ask you something?”
The door abruptly opened, causing Harry to jump slightly. Draco didn’t even seem to notice. Harry looked over his boyfriend’s slumbering body, only to see Ron walking into the dormitory. Sharing a room with him had been incredibly tense ever since he’d blown up at Harry. They hadn’t said a word to each other, going out of their way to stay out of each other’s way, avoiding the other at all costs. Harry knew it was hard on the other boys in their room, Dean and Seamus, but he couldn’t bring himself to talk to Ron. About anything. He could barely get words to form in his head when he looked at Ron, let alone get them out of his mouth.
“Six,” he answered.
, that was amazing, I can’t believe-”
Anyway, I really hope that you guys enjoy this chapter, it's the longest one yet, hopefully that makes up for my absence.
Harry was crumpled on the floor, one hand clutching his chest while the other was fisted tightly in his hair. Hermione sat behind him, pressed to his back with her legs on either side of him, hugging him tightly and using her long sleeve to wipe away the sweat beading on Harry’s forehead while whispering in his ear.
When Harry’s lips reached the junction of his neck and shoulder, he tightened his fingers in the taller boy’s hair, tugging Harry’s head back to face him. His green eyes were dark and heavy-lidded, his brow furrowed. His boyfriend’s warm, peppermint breath fanned over his face, heavy and irregular in its rhythm. Warmth flowed and pooled low in Draco’s stomach at the sight of him like this, with his jaw dropped and his hair messier than usual from Draco’s own hands. He leaned forward, pressing his chest firmly against the bigger boy’s, and took Harry’s bottom lip between his teeth, brushing his tongue over the other boy’s and swallowing the husky groan that escaped his boyfriend.
Knowing that before the sun fell, Harry will have gone home for the weekend, Draco longed to spend every spare second with his boyfriend before their roles were reversed, and he would have to watch as Harry drove away. Only this time, Draco knew that Harry both wanted and needed the time spent at home with his family.
She stopped less than three feet away from them, but Draco didn’t seem to notice her. Regret was woven through her words as she spoke, “Take care of him, Harry.”
Draco stopped in his tracks, staring at Harry’s receding back. The other students pushed past him, some of them bumping his shoulders in an attempt to get him to walk again, but Draco seemed rooted to the ground. His fingers had gone slightly cold, as if missing the warmth they might have gained if Harry had stopped to touch his hand.
“Okay,” he started, mesmerized by those beautiful, enchanting grey eyes, “okay, I have to go, but I’ll text you, okay?”
“Remember what I said this morning?” Harry whispered to her. “You’ll be okay, I promise. I’ll be back on Monday, and you can call or text me anytime, okay? I’m here for you.”
“Harry, sweetheart, can you… Can I ask what your nightmare was about?”
“You alright, kitten?” Harry asked into his hair, rubbing his hand up and down his boyfriend’s arm. He waited, breathing in the smell of his lemon shampoo. When there was no response, he decided to go for an easier question. “What did your father call for?”
Basically, it sucked.
So just as some useful information, I've been trying so hard to stick to my updating-every-two-weeks schedule, but now with everything that's been happening in my life, updates might be a little more off-schedule. I'm going to try as hard as I can to keep on top of everything, but there's so much going on that it's harder than ever.
“Damn it, Sirius,
Draco, however, just walked towards Harry and out of the common room door with a wave to his friends and a casual “See you later” thrown over his shoulder. Harry followed after him. Harry could see Draco sneaking glances at him as they walked to the garage.
A gentle smile graced Draco’s lips, a hum resounded in the back of his throat as a response. Stretching his stiff limbs, he swiftly turned over himself to face the other boy. Harry’s raven hair was ruffled against his pillow, his green eyes heavy-lidded with the remnants of sleep, the corners of his lips were upturned in the beginnings of a tired smile. His fingers began tracing the lines of Draco’s ribs, caressing the divot of his spine, stroking up and down the skin on his chest and stomach. Every touch sent a burst of warmth through Draco, flowing through his veins.
Harry would not be using that phone number.
“Ninth year, Hermione Granger. Ring any bells for you?”
The increased pressure on his hand made Harry look down at Draco, who whispered, “You don’t have to, Harry. You can walk away right now, you don’t have to say a word, and none of us would blame you.” The blond boy lifted his other hand to brush through Harry’s black hair, bringing the smallest of smiles to his face. “It’s okay not to talk to him, for now.” Draco’s gaze was steady and determined, bolstering Harry’s own confidence. He could do this.
“Yes. Now answer the question.”
When they reached the door to Draco’s common room, in the southern dormitories, Draco paused outside the door. He looked up, just to see those sparkling green eyes looking right back at him, that smile still on his lips. Draco smiled back as he said, “Thanks for walking with me, Harry.”
The words slowly sunk in. Harry pressed Draco even closer to his body as if he could chase away his tears.
Pansy’s eyebrow raised and Harry let out a laugh, provoking her grin to widen.
“I just, I mean I saw you over here and I guess I just wanted to say hi.”
He just wanted to know what he was competing with.
But then he looked down at Draco, and those talons around his heart loosened. The smile on his blond boyfriend’s face had become somewhat more sincere, despite it being smaller.
It was while Remus recounted a wild tale of Teddy trying to help bake cookies that Harry noticed how late it had gotten—the sun was beginning to set. Time had seemingly run away from them. Not to mention that Draco had become rather drowsy; Harry had noticed his fight to keep his eyes open. A fight he was losing badly.
Harry was more than aware that leading Draco into the cafe could mean putting him through one of the biggest embarrassments of his life—but he trusted Sirius to take it easy on him. Especially since it would be the first time either of them met the other. And he trusted Remus to make Draco as comfortable as possible, and Harry hoped that he would help to at least reel his godfather in.
do it.”
And, true to Harry, he was slow, gentle, tender, and soft with Draco.
“Go to sleep, Harry,” Hermione whispered, lightly brushing away the hair on his forehead with a gentle smile. “Draco’s coming to help me pack for you. We’ll wake you up when Sirius is here.”
After a beat, Harry stood, bringing Draco with him. A crooked grin spread on the smaller boy’s face at the sight of his boyfriend’s smirk.
However, despite feeling
Harry could still feel Draco’s soft lips against his own, he had replayed the memory of the blond boy gripping his face to pull him down to kiss him throughout all his classes. Professor Snape had snapped at him more than once for being unattentive; Harry was sure he would fail the assignment he’d been given, he’d been too busy thinking about Draco to absorb any of the information. (Harry desperately wanted to feel those chilled hands in his hair, on his shoulders, everywhere. He wanted to kiss every inch of skin Draco would allow him to, he wanted to slide his hands under the other boy’s shirt, wanted to feel his breaths as they moved through his chest. He wanted, no, no he
“About?”
“What’s not to love?”
Detention was, to say the least, getting on Harry’s nerves. Snape had him doing the most menial tasks for hours on end: cleaning every nook and cranny of his classroom, sanitizing beakers, organizing the materials closets. That was only Monday. Tuesday had Harry scanning every classroom textbook and erasing any pencil marks students had left behind. Wednesday didn’t bother him as much, Snape had told him to assist Professor Sprout—the botany professor—with repotting the plants that had outgrown their pots. If it weren’t for the slightly irritating opera music Sprout insisted on listening to, he might’ve almost enjoyed himself.
they were.
And then another.
“No, Harry. You didn’t—I shouldn’t have yelled. I’m sorry,” Draco said softly. He didn’t know what to do with his hands, didn’t know what to say to make this better. He ran his hands through his hair, tugging at the strands. An uneasy, nearly painful smile was plastered on his face. It must have looked more like a grimace. “It was just… a very inconvenient way to meet and learn about your ex-boyfriend. I got jealous. I got angry. I didn’t deal with it very well.” Draco was drowning in the words he hadn’t yet said, the words that were strangling him. “I’m the one who’s sorry, Harry. You didn’t do anything wrong. I’m so sorry.”
(Even if he hadn’t been there for Harry’s first word, his first steps, or his first day of school, he’d been there for Harry the way no one else
Gazing deep into grey eyes, Harry said, “I missed you, you know.”
“That doesn’t matter. Who is this Harry person?”
Draco was dumbfounded. How did someone who came from that sort of background, one that was filled with so much loss and sadness, turn out like Harry?
He froze in the doorway, trying to reconcile his logic with what he was seeing in front of him. Harry was sleeping, his head on Hermione’s chest with his face in her neck and his arms around her small frame. But the part that bothered him the most was how Hermione’s hand was in his hair, her other arm wrapped around as much of his body as she could reach with her smaller arm span.
Memories flashed unbidden through his head—the paralyzing fear he’d felt when he first saw the letter from Petunia, the haunting nightmares that had been relentlessly plaguing him, the anxiety over both his future and his past, all of it. Harry’s heart squeezed and ached with the force of them, his head felt both light and heavy, the overwhelming emotions made him let out a choked breath.
“Can I ask you a completely off-topic question?”
“Yes.” Harry didn’t break stride as Draco caught up to him.
The taller boy looked confused. His brows drew together. “What are you on about, ‘Mione?” He raised his hand to press against her forehead like he was checking for a temperature. She swatted his hand away.
“You’ve got nothing to be jealous about, Draco.” Harry shifted Draco’s body until they were facing each other, Draco’s legs crossed behind Harry’s back and his hands slowly sliding up his broad shoulders. “I want
I hang out with him and Astoria so the kids can still play. Just because you’re having your issues doesn’t mean the boys should miss out.” Harry should have expected that, maybe. It hurts, like everything to do with Draco hurts now, his feelings all mixed up inside, and he can’t even feel happy for his own kids without that bleeding over.
He takes his glasses off, not even bothering to fold them before dropping them to the floor. Finding them again is a future Harry problem, one he really can’t be arsed caring about right now. Harry's last act is to
Harry can see Draco's working on something, a tool in his hand, and Harry can't tell what it is, but he can tell what it's not—a wand, and oh, that's interesting.
Harry’s not sure what happened before, but it's as if the moment in the kitchen broke something between them. Harry would think he was the only one affected if not for the way Draco is looking at
His fingers drift over the tattoo, skirting over the grey lines, feeling the bones beneath them, and Harry leans forward to place a kiss on Draco’s hip, just shy of the dragon.
The thought runs through him like a flash of lightning, straight to his cock. He gets so hard so fast he almost feels dizzy from it, head spinning as fast as his thoughts are. He bites the inside of his cheek, hard enough that he tastes the tang of copper, the shock of pain enough to slow his thoughts—even if it does nothing for the pressure building in his groin
He lets out a shuddering gasp. It sounds wrecked already, even to Harry’s ears, and if that and the building pressure in his groin are anything to go by then this is going to be a startlingly short affair. Harry forces his eyes open again. It’s a divine torture, watching Draco as he moves his mouth up and down on his cock. Draco’s good at this, his mouth, his lips, his hands, his fucking
"I would," he says, and drops his lips down for another kiss.
Draco doesn’t look to see if anyone sees them walk out of the party as they leave, Harry leading the way to his room Harry sits on the bed while Draco leans against the desk and tries not to look at Harry or the bed, tries not to wonder those are the same sheets as the night he was here. Whether Harry has changed them yet. Tries, and fails.
"Being nosy again, Potter?"
Harry's shirt goes first, pushed up and over his head and then thrown away, probably to join Draco's own, gone somewhere Draco doesn't care to think about. Draco's fingers touch at the waistband of his jeans next, and Harry gasps out another, “Yes!” Draco unbuttons Harry’s jeans, sliding them off and out of the way to leave Harry in only his pants, his cock tenting the material, making it clear just how turned on he is.
He’s scared of it, of this thing that maybe-probably is linking them together. Part of Draco wants it all be a mistake, that he’ll wake up tomorrow with clean skin and a lighter heart. There are people that go unmarked their whole lives, who never find their partner, and Draco hadn’t been hoping for it exactly, but he’d see the appeal. He probably would have outgrown it one day, but he needed
Regulus eyebrows furrow. "Who’s that?"
"No," Malfoy says, with a grimace. "No, you'd definitely know if the house was dead. It's just like it's… Not connected to you."
Harry bites down on the groan, threads the fingers of his empty hand into his trousers, pinching the material. Talking with Kreacher has always been an exercise in frustration.
When Draco's 15 he can't think of anything worse than finding his soulmate, of seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realise it's
Everyone seemed to have an opinion on how Harry should be putting himself out there and
"Like the band?"
. Draco guides him, pressing him backwards across the room, moving Harry sideways with an arm on his shoulder. Harry just lets himself be pushed, feels his stomach coiling tight in anticipation. He doesn't know where Draco's directing him until his legs bump into something, and Draco presses him against it until Harry's legs fold and he finds himself on the soft cushions of a sofa.
grey anyway, there are colours there, pale flecks of blue and green that dot his irises.
"But then couldn't you just recast the spells?" Harry asks.
"To be fair, I wouldn't have expected it of me either." Draco's hands are clasped by his sides, and Harry thinks he can see a slight tremor to them. Draco clears his throat, and his right hand comes up, runs through his hair only for it to fall down again, and he looks away from Harry at the shop around them. "I guess it… It puts me on edge." Draco shrugs, looks back to him, and there's something on his face, like a question unasked. "You've seen me at my worst."
“Are you going to take off your own trousers?” Harry asks, his voice a mix of wonder and
The noise comes again—there are definite footsteps and other noises too, things being moved, perhaps a door opening and closing.
“I forgot how small she was,” he confesses.
The words hurt, a stab at his tender heart, and Harry’s not prepared for them to hurt quite so much.
When his eyes drift down to Kreacher, who's looking up at the ghost with affection, an expression he’s seen on Kreacher’s face only a couple of times, and it all slips into place.
"Harry," Draco says, sounding almost frantic as his hands shake Harry’s shoulder. "Harry, it’s okay, the glass just cracked."
"I survived perfectly fine without you before you were my partner," Harry points out. “But I would miss you."
"That sounds a bit like Dark Magic."

when they realise Draco could never
“Just here to study,” Harry replies, “and maybe have a chat.”
Moving out of the question, he slides them sideways, laying them down on the sofa, Harry on his back with Draco on top of him. It’s almost too much effort to reach his wand on the coffee table, and only the thought of the come drying between them stops him from abandoning it completely. He’s not keen on waking up fused together. Either way it still takes all his willpower, and the wand might jump the last few inches into his fingertips, he really can't be sure. He casts the
Harry takes the moment. He can still feel Draco's lips on his, the faint taste of the wine they'd been drinking, the food they shared. There's a tingle, like the ghost of touch and Draco's still standing in front of him, a hand on his stomach while Harry's is resting on Draco's hip.
Draco dismisses his words. "I’m not helping Potter, you better not have it in your head that I’ll be doing any work. I’ll be
understand that Harry, but the house wouldn’t necessarily see it like that. You're not its blood, and maybe that wouldn't matter if you'd been living here, if you spent time here with Sirius—before everything. But you can't have been here more than a few weeks here, all told. You're practically a stranger.
Now, here, and all other times, too. But he’s not been allowed him for so long. So Harry takes advantage of it, pulling Draco tight into his chest for a hug, like he’s been starving for it. And maybe he is. Harry buries his head in Draco’s hair, inhaling the familiar scent of his shampoo. The overexaggerated dream state makes everything more acute, and Harry can pick out his shampoo, the smell of his hair, even the slightest hint of sweaty tang from how Draco always runs warm in the night. It’s everything he’s missed, and it hurts so good that Harry’s eyes start to prickle from it.
Draco turns, picking up the wine glass—Harry doesn’t even remember him placing it down—and passes it back to Harry.
, it makes sense now why Luna would send him here. "But you better not let the Kneazle out."
“What are you doing here?”
, Harry thinks, thoughts still swirling. His mind feels like the Ford Anglia, stalling out in mid-air and
. Nothing in the room feels dangerous—instead it feels… cared for.
Harry steps inside the shop, hand falling from the door and letting it fall shut behind him.
Harry nods, even though he's not sure if Draco can see him.
She looks so peaceful now, her hair sparse. And what hair she has is so light it’s barely visible unless it catches the light. There’s a hint of colour in it, a sign of the strawberry blonde that’s started to shine through looking less and less like Draco’s and more like the woman she’s been named after as she gets older.
"Well it’s not your house, I won’t leave it to you if that’s what you want." Regulus shrugs and looks at Draco, "I’d pass the house over to you if you wanted it. I guess you’re next in line."
They’ve been
Draco brings the wine to his lips, and Harry’s hands still on the cutting board as he turns his attention to Draco, even if does his best not to flat out stare.
It’s not too bad a view, really.
“Draco,” Harry gasps. He’s touching Draco everywhere it feels like, at their groins, their legs wrapped around each others, their lips bumping into each other. Harry’s hands on Draco are almost too much too handle, they never stop touching, never stop moving, running up Draco’s arms, over his shoulders, down his back.  They keep tracing a path on Draco’s body,and on every run, his hands dip a little lower. When his hands finally brush the band of his pants, Draco feels like he’s been waiting for it an age, but soon they’re drifting even lower, feeling the swell of his arse, and letting his hands rest there,
“Potter,” Draco gasps, when Harry’s fingers pinch his nipple again, the sensation shooting straight to his cock. Harry’s other hand is wrapped around his hip, almost obsessively. It’s hard to think with all the competing sensations, and Draco struggles to keep his train of thought. “At least —” His voice breaks as Harry moves his hips down to press their groins together. “At least take my shirt off you — you heathen, you’re ruining it.”
"But it could be mine," Harry says, and Draco looks at him. "Don’t I deserve the chance to at least try and make it my home?"
There was a time when he hadn’t been able to cook food in the kitchen. Every time he’d try he’d be overtaken by panic about it being
It doesn’t make Harry feel much better.
It’s one of those orgasms that feel all-consuming, so much better than his own hand late at night. He keeps his eyes open as long as he can, watches as he paints Draco’s skin with his come, but then it’s too much, and Harry falls back, eyes falling closed as he strokes himself through the rest of his orgasm.
Draco chuckles in front of him, and Harry thrusts against him in retaliation, only to force moans from the both of them.
