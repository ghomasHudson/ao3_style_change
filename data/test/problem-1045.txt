Draco stared at the pile beside him a moment, before reaching for the top one. Harry stood back, leaning against the chest of drawers against the wall opposite of the end of the bed.
Surprised but pleased that Draco liked his work and was asking questions, he went over to the window and found the chip that had a colour palette on it.  “I can’t decide between these three colours.” Draco walked up beside him as he continued.  “I like the darker one, but if I find furniture that is dark, too, then it will seem like a dungeon in here.  But if I go with the lighter, I’m afraid that it will look too white.”
Harry had just sighed in content when a rude cough startled them, causing to jump apart red faced and panting.
Severus removed his Notice Me Not Spell and started clapping excitedly. He was grinning from ear to ear which was scaring everyone but Tom. Tom hadn't seen his husband smile this blindingly for years. Once everyone saw Severus clapping some joined in.
Draco carries on speaking when Harry didn’t say anything. ‘I just want to protect you. Keep you safe. Heal you. Calm you. Make you smile, make you happy.’ Draco felt a tear roll down his own face. Well there goes keeping his emotions in check.
The last observations he made, was when he managed to push through the crowd into the burning building. Vernon's body lay mangled on the floor in the hallway. Well, Albus thought, that explains the blood. As he walked further into the house, he could smell burning flesh. As he turned left in the kitchen, he saw two bodies hung by the fire place burnt to a crisp in the middle of the raging inferno. The heat was most intense here and Albus thought he should probably go before his beautiful beard singed off. It took him 50 years to get it that long!
Also, I personally prefer Harry and Draco with their original names, even when they are in a female role. I think Harrietta or Dracophine sounds so stupid and so I will use their names like normal.
When he did finally see Draco, his heart shattered. It was when they stepped off the train, Draco stood there bags under his eyes, wide eyes alert, flinching when someone so much as looks at him. He was so skinny, underfed almost and was covered in scars. He no longer held his head up, it was down, chin into his chest almost, hair in his eyes yet he didn't move it away. It was almost like he was hiding behind it.
The whole school yelled and screamed in excitement before lifting the boys in question up onto shoulders until they met on the top of a table. Their schoolmates then started to chant:
Draco had a dorm to himself as none of his friends came back, and anyway, no one wanted to share a dorm with a Death Eater in case they were murdered in their sleep. It was a small room, with 2 beds. He used one for sleeping and the other as a chill type couch. He had a dark wood desk and a massive window looking out over the quidditch pitch. The Slytherin found it slightly strange being in a tower instead of being in the dungeons but he felt he was adjusting quite well.
"I love her, yet it doesn't hurt as much as it should. Should it hurt Draco? To break up with her? I still love her. And I don't know what to feel or even to do." Draco felt sorry for his new friend.
This problem stuck with Harry for weeks. Ginny was away for 4 months this time and so he was very lonely. Ginny forbade him to get a pet. He didnt understand why; it was for him when she wasn't there!
Harry completed the charms and started to wrap the flowers up. "Say, it's been ages since I last saw you... and although we arent friends... we did get along more in our eight year. So I was wondering... if you want to go get coffee sometime?" Draco asked hesitantly, shuffling his feet on the sodden mat. Harry was taken aback. He thought about it for a moment before replying. " 'Course! That sounds great. I open the shop at 0830 in the morning and close it for a 30 minute break for lunch at around 1230. I close up for the night at 1900, but that can always change. So whenever you're free around those times I'd be happy to go out for a drink with you." Harry smiled brightly at his customer.
"Aw that was so cute!!" I whipped around as fast as I could without falling over from exhaustion and Pansy squealed. "Hermione!!! We were just talking about you!!" Granger just laughed and pecked my best friend on the lips. "I know love. You two are so cute." I pouted. "I'm a Malfoy. Malfoy's are
A/N - This may be my fave chapter yet. Is this going too fast? I really need to remember all the things that I have mentioned otherwise I will forget the plot. Lord, no one told me writing stories this big was such hard work!
"I hope you understand that if I could, I would not put you with these muggles. However, it is for the greater good. I am truly sorry. I know of your... dislike shall we say, for your family, but they are family. Your only family left. Please do try get along with them; it is for your own good as well." He says with sorrow clouding his eyes. Harry scoffs internally. He wants to argue but if he does, he shows his hand too early. Instead, he nods his head once, sharply, before standing up swiftly. "Is that all?" he asks in a hard cold voice. Albus looks taken aback at his tone but merely smiles and waves goodbye. Harry turns on his heel and exits the room brooding over the audacity Albus has to leave him with those Muggles.
She shook her head. "Nope. Looks safe to me. I did use some detection charms on it but nothing has come up."
Harry just wants to get away from his abusing relatives. He has just watched someone die and then someone else come back to life and you would have thought he would have been allowed to stay at his best mate’s house right? Wrong. Dumbledore said he had to stay with his relatives, the Horse and two Whales. Said it was "for the greater good, my boy".
Harry chuckled and kissed him sweetly, holding him tightly in his arms. "I have you, and I am never letting you go. Okay?"
"I wonder what you like Draco. I will discover everything tonight so I won't be wondering much longer." And with that, Harry threw Draco onto his bed and if they forgot the silencing charms? No one cared, they were just glad that the two boys finally found each other.
No one answered and Harry was starting to get impatient. "IS THAT CLEAR?" he repeated, his anger showing. They all gulped and a chorus of 'yes Harry' emanated from them. He nodded his head, satisfied and walked off to his class.
"Call him that and misuse his pronouns again and I will hex you into next week." He said in a dangerously low voice, glaring at her heatedly. "Draco is a better person than you ever will be. He made mistakes and i think you will find he paid for them. He doesn't need to pay anymore. Don't call him a Death Eater. Now, get the hell out of my house. I will not have you spitting on people I love. Get out." He roared and lunged at her.
The rest of the school year went with Harry ignoring the Gryffindors and politely nodding to the Slytherins. The first time he nodded to Malfoy, the blond gaped at him until Harry smirked at him. He scowled and strolled off away from Harry.
Harry mustered up all his courage and closed his eyes placing his lips ever so gently onto Draco's. He held them there for three seconds, marvelling at how soft they were before pulling back and smiling softly. He turned around to leave and was tiptoeing out but froze when he felt two arms wrap around his waist. His breath hitched and his heart hammered in his chest even harder than before.
His parents died when he was young, and he doesn't remember them anyway. His childhood was filled with hateful comments and beatings 24/7 – no love there either. When he joined Hogwarts, he felt like he was finally, finally going to be loved.
Harry had blurted it out on the 3rd meet by accident. They were talking about relationships (somehow) and Harry had just said it. Draco was furious. Harry had to take him outside and calm him down before his magic went mental and they would have to obliviate any muggles.
It smelled of cinnamon and he wondered if Harry knew he smelled of cinnamon. He made a mental note to ask him later and instead found himself carding his fingers through Harry’s hair.
Harry deemed his letter informative enough yet kept it quite simple, just to peak Snape's interest so that he helps him. Harry snickers to himself, how very slytherin of you. He sent it off with Hedwig, telling her to be as inconspicuous as possible then got ready for bed.
"Knowing you, Professor, you are probably confused as to why I called my 'best friend' by his surname. I discovered something very interesting before the holidays. I am not sure if you are aware of where the Weasels and the Muggleborn's loyalties lie, but know for sure that they aren't with me. They never were. They lie with fame, money and Dumbledore. I know you are a spy, and I'm pretty sure it is for Riddle not Dumbledore. How on earth did you manage to convince the old coot you were on his side? I congratulate you; it must have been challenging." Severus grumbled, "That boy is way too observant" Lucius snickered.
I love you so very much. I can get lost in those beautiful green eyes. I hope you have a map to help me get out of them! ;)
He never spoke, this was an animagus. Whoever it is could probably spill his secrets if he told so he kept his mouth tightly shut.
Draco looked at me with a strange face. He looked fiercely protective but very possessive at the same time. And that’s when I promptly fainted.
in love and as much as I am glad that they wish to show others who they belong to, I do not want them copulating in the middle of a shop to show their devotion to one another just because a horny, slutty, whore of a shop owner can't keep his thoughts to himself and remain a
"I want to claim you." Draco said bluntly, eyes scanning Harry for his reaction. He could hear the adults spluttering over by the door but was entranced by the emotions passing across Harry's beautiful face. Harry had spaced out a little, blush still prominent, lips parted slightly, staring at Draco with an unknown emotion. Draco raised an eyebrow, the movement breaking Harry out of his trance with a jolt and he scrambled away from Draco, putting his head in his hands trying to calm his racing heart. Draco felt hurt but forced his mask up hiding his emotions not wanting to look stupid and heartbroken.
I cant believe Harry was looking at me! She is so cute. I think I may try find her a present today. It'll be for when I ask her out.
"That was very impressive how you dealt with Clopsy, Harry." Tom looked at Harry questionably. "How do you know how to calm an elf down?" Harry looked furious before spitting out – "The Weasley's. They own a poor, ancient house elf named Pokka but they called him Bastard. I was the only one to call him Pokka, and the Weasley's all tried to stop me but I did not. I was always furious with how they treated poor Pokka. I tricked Ron into freeing him, and the elf wanted to bond with me. I said I couldn't, and I'm sorry but he could go work at the Lovegood's. The needed another house elf. Pokka popped away and I see him every now and again when I talk to Luna."
"Harry." I started. "I have liked you since second year. We are fifteen now. I decided I should do something about it. I bought all these gifts for you because I can see you wearing them, they suit you, I could afford them, you deserve them and they all reminded me of you. I looked at each one and the first person who came to my mind was you, so I bought them." I looked down to the ground, necklace still in my hand. I took in a shuddering breath, to calm my nerves, before asking Harry the important question.
It was a short flimsy thing. Black and pleated, it barely covered her arse and many people were gawking at it. I rolled my eyes. In addition, she calls
Harry was working on his Charm's essay in the Gryffindor common room when a Second Year with pigtails came and handed him a note. She scurried away as quickly as she came. He rolled his eyes, and opened the note.
As he trudged up the stairs, he noticed there was a layer of dust, like ground stone on the stairs. He scuffed it as he walked up and could see worn stone underneath. He had never noticed the dust before. Why? He put these thoughts to the back of his mind when he reached the wooden door that stood in front of him proudly. The raven-haired boy did not bother knocking. Why should he respect the Headmasters privacy when he did not respect his?
The two boys kept looking at the door in fear and jumped high into the air when the doors burst open revealing a smug Potions Professor.
Potter had come up to him two days after school had started. Draco expected a fight, but was shocked to say the least when the Gryffindor pulled him into his arms. Draco considered squirming and fighting but he was too cold and Potter was warm. Fuck, he was hot – in both senses of the word.
?!" Pansy stared at me incredulously. "No! You idiot! I'm not replacing you! I could never replace you. You're too clingy anyways. But no, you are both equals to me. I will favour one over the other but then I will pay the same amount of attention and time to the other one I neglected for whatever reason later. You're not being cut out of my life Dray. You're too important to me."
They entered the shop and were immediately pounced upon by Mr Coalfield himself. He looked a bit pissed and was eyeing Harry suggestively.
I hope this doesn't deter any of you my lovely readers, but I thought I should probably give you a heads up.
This is my last week at online school and I spend my sports lessons writing this story as they are free periods. I write this on my laptop, and my laptop is strictly school only so I am doing this under my parents noses... This means that I will not be able to update weekly as I have attempted to. I will be writing on my phone from now on and that means I will get frustrated with my fat thumbs so updates will be much slower andddddddddddd the chapters may be shorter.... Sorry.
Malfoy smirks at me evilly with a dangerous gleam in his eye. A shiver racks my whole body. I have to tell myself the smirk is NOT hot. But fuck it is!
The Malfoys and Severus Snape were in the Amazon Rainforest helping Severus look for special potions ingredients when an unconscious Harry Potter appeared in front of them. As they rush over, they notice he is shirtless, beaten black and blue and is bleeding heavily. Severus and Narcissa immediately stop the bleeding and enervate him. Harry sees them and starts to cry silently. He suddenly rolls over and retches but as he has not been fed, nothing came out except for saliva. Draco runs over and tries to help him. He soothes him and calms him down stroking his hair lightly.
Harry laughs wetly. ‘No Draco,’ he whispered, ‘I’m okay. Really. It was a nightmare but you saved me. You pulled me out from the depths of pain and torture towards something better. You saved me from drowning in my own despair.’ Harry was full on sobbing now, so Draco stroked his hair and neck. ‘I love you. I always have and I felt like shit knowing I had hurt you in the past. I still kept on hurting you, hoping that it was just deep, ugly, vicious hate instead of love. It never worked. It made me hate myself. I mean, I had to be pretty fucked up if I was purposely hurting the one I love and have only ever loved. There was never anyone else. I tried. I tried to get you out of my head but it never worked.’
"That was such a Draco reaction. I am so disappointed in you Harry." Narcissa teased lightly. "Mum!" She just laughed.
"WAIT! Please, do not disturb them if they are having 'fun'? I want them to enjoy this bit of time to their selves" Clopsy nodded dutifully. "Of course Master Lucy." With a smile, Clopsy disappeared upstairs.
Harry wakes up slowly. Groggily, he tries to work out his surroundings, that is when he realises there is an arm over his hip, and his legs are tangled with someone else’s. He freezes. As Harry slowly twists, he realises that his body does not hurt that much anymore and is happy. However that happiness only increases when he realises who is cuddling him like a teddy bear.
October 31st, my parents were killed. I was orphaned and Dumbledore ensured I was placed with my muggle relatives – Petunia and Vernon Dursley. He left a letter with a large amount of money in to ensure my 'wellbeing'. My 'wellbeing' isn't what you would have expected from the 'Chosen one'. You would've thought it was meant to pamper me, give me the best luxuries money could buy. I didn't get that. I was treated worse than a house elf. I still am."
Pansy gasped, pointing a finger at me. "Your thigh highs...." she whispered. I gasped too. "My thigh highs!!! Oh that will be perfect!!" I squealed.
The dog barked once and smashed his snout into the wall. Draco peered at the name. "Colin Creevey." He looked at the dog. "Good name, you." He said, patting its head. The dogs tail wagged and it stood up, starting the walk. Draco sighed, imagining Colin Creevey's future if he were alive.
My lips were bruised and sore but I still didn't care. It was hot, wet, messy but perfect and amazing and I just wanted to drown in him. His scent infiltrated my nostrils as I mussed up his hair. He was so strong, which was surprising, but I really didn't care. Especially when he nipped my lips like that and unghhhhh. God, he was God. I swear. I am going to
I fell out with my friends and family. I haven't spoken to them since we graduated. That was 12 years ago.
Harry remembers his reaction when he saved him in the second task. He just sat there, staring at harry, gobsmacked, blushing furiously and silently seething (his hair was all dirty now. Bloody lake). He was obviously feeling so many feelings at once he didn’t know what to do about it.
news that her account was empty and that all the accounts sending in money were frozen... she lost it
Draco carries the smaller boy into the bathroom and strips him. He places him in the bath and fills it up with water. Slowly, as to not damage the wounds further, he washes the sleeping boy and cleans him from all the mud and blood. As Draco washed him, he found the scars left behind oh Harry’s skin making him want to cry. He also found scars on his wrists, suggesting Harry self-harms. He made a mental note to ask him about it when he was better. Once Harry was clean, Draco gently dries him with the fluffiest towel he can find and dresses harry in some boxers and one of Draco’s long shirts. As the boy is small, it works like a nightie and Draco thinks Harry looks adorable in it. He carefully picks the still sleeping boy up and places him on his bed. He gets in himself and curls around Harry, putting him in a protective and warm embrace and Draco slowly falls asleep with his face buried in Harry’s curls.
Fortunately, Severus was already there shoving potions down Harry's throat. Tom had entered the kitchen to find the other two muggles. Once Severus was satisfied that he had choked Harry with enough potions he moved onto Draco. Harry originally hadn't seen Draco as Severus was in the way but when he did, he howled in anger and threw himself onto Vernon who was laying on the floor in pain.
"Oh and Harry, if you don't come back after 15 minutes, I expect to see you and Malfoy snogging in the entrance to the Great Hall at breakfast. That means you are dating. I'll let the others know alright?" Neville grinned. Harry sighed, "Fine." "Good luck Golden Boy!!" Neville said and walked off.
It was silent for a moment and when I looked up at Harry, she flung her arms around my neck chanting "yes, yes, yes" in my ear. I grinned and wrapped my arms around her, nuzzling into her soft hair.
There was half a bottle left of Ogdens finest and two glasses lay next to it on the coffee table. Weird.
"Took your time cousin dear!" Sirius said, smiling brightly at Narcissa. "Sirius! Remus! How nice of you to join us. Can I get you a drink?" The hostess snapped her fingers and summoned an elf. Clopsy popped in to take her mistresses orders and soon left with a quiet crack.
"He was stuck! He was trying to put his shirt on but like the idiot he is got stuck and asked for help!" Harry defended.
Today however was one of the worst days. As Lupin was a professor this year, he had to make him the Wolfsbane potion but it went wrong this morning because his stasis charm wore off. Then he had Slytherin and Gryffindor to teach potions to first thing this morning and Malfoy and Potter were extra loud today. Honestly! Couldn't they just shag each other already?!?! Then Longbottom and Finnegan blew up their potion. BUMBLING IDIOTS.
I sighed. Merlin, all I want is a break from these lunatics I have somehow surrounded myself with. I am exhausted. Leave me alone!!
A low growl emanated from Draco’s throat. “Where do you think he disappears off to everyday then? We have been dating since 2nd year, so I am pretty sure I know him. Want proof?” he enquired with a raised eyebrow. Ron nodded.
Harry grinned at him before pulling Draco onto his lap and holding him close. "You idiot," he said. "Why didn't you bring your bloody coat? Or your hat, scarf and gloves?"
Neville is actually quite observant. He knows, I know he knows but he didn't tell me when I asked. Just gave me a smirk and said (quite mischievously!) "You wont be disappointed!" then winked and walked off leaving me more frustrated than before.
This morning I got a beautiful knuckle ring(A/N is that what it is called? Lol). This admirer of mine is going all out. They're obviously rich. Draco is rich... no it cant be. Why would she like me when she can have Blaise or Theo?
Ron glared at Harry and advanced towards him. He grabbed the smaller boy by the front of his robes and pulled him towards him with their faces right up close. “What was that Potter? Laughing at me were you?” he snarled.
One passerby hexed Mrs Weasley with a Stinging Jinx. She shrieked and jumped a mile high, much to the amusement of everyone around. She was fuming and stomped over to Gringotts with her ginger ducklings following behind.
Seeing Draco it bounced up and started to bark and jump in circles around Draco, wagging its tail enthusiastically. Draco chuckled a little making the dog get louder. "Stop! Sh!!! Someone will hear!!!"
things and they take even longer when dealing with these types of customers. The two husband's sniggered at the sight.
Draco had actually considered leaving the Manor and his parents. He could emancipate himself as he was old enough but he didn't want to leave his mother with his father. That was the only reason he became a Death Eater – to protect his mother. But no one knew that, and no one asked so he didn't tell. He had a feeling Potter knew a bit. He didn't know how though, but he always seemed to know what Draco was struggling with even if he didn't even know he was struggling.
Once the young soulmates were before the big glass windows of the required shop, Draco halted and grinned at Harry mischievously. With no warning, Draco wrapped his hand into the front of Harry's - no
Anyways, don't forget to let me know if you want a request written. I have some more to do (and I am so sorry this was so late) but I guess having things pile up motivates me lol.
Draco and Harry just looked at each other in fear, who was this imposter and where is their teacher?
A/N - Does not take part in 3rd year btw. Pretend Lupin came back to teach in 5th year instead of Umbitch. - HAPPY READING!
A cough pulled them out of their lust induced haze and they blushed heavily. "Hot but seriously. Leave that to the bedroom boys. Please. I don't really want to see my son ravishing his future husband in front of me." Begged Draco's father. Narcissa and Severus giggled and Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust. "Bleugh, father please don't call us making out hot." "If you wish," Lucius said smirking.
I lunged at him and wrapped my arms around his neck. He barely caught me and just supported my arse before claiming my lips in an explosive kiss.
Ron’s eyes widened and a snarl escaped his lips as he bashed Harry’s petit frame against the wall. His head took most of the impact and the result was a sickening thud. Draco gasped as Ron lifted him up to do it again.
"Nothing." Snarls Draco a thunderous expression on his face. "You did nothing wrong Harry, nothing. You hear me? It wasn't your fault."
From the front of the classroom Snape spoke, albeit slurringly. (XD That's not even a word. Deal with it)
Meanwhile, Ginny was injured in her last game. A bludger hit her arm, shattering the bone. She was sent home to rest. As the her bones were settling, she couldn't apparate or use a portkey, and flying was it of the question. Instead she had to walk 7 miles to the nearest overseas floo and floo home. It took her a day to get home and she was exhausted. When she got home, it was unnaturally quiet for a Sunday morning.
{Harry James Potter - thinking of changing her name to Harry James-Lily Potter or Harry James Potter-Lily.}
In the crowded corridors of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there is always one voice that drowns out all the rest.
Severus grabs pain relieving potions, blood replenishing potions and calming droughts and levitates them over to Draco who is comforting harry. Draco asks if Harry can drink these for him and Harry does. He starts to go sleepy, cuddles up more into Draco, and eventually falls asleep in his arms. Draco kisses his forehead and Narcissa coos. Draco sent her a glare and positioned Harry in his arms so he can hold him without dropping him. The four take him back to where they are staying; however, there are no spare beds so Draco suggests him and Harry share.
"Oi!!!" Draco shouted before grabbing Harry by his waist and hoisting him up onto his shoulders again. Harry shrieked as he dangled upside down once more. "Don't you dare slap my arse again Potter or suffer the consequences! They will be much more intense than last time." Draco said warningly as Pansy laughed.
Harry looked to the ground before replying. "I thought your family were against same sex relationships?" Next to Harry Draco sucked in a breath sharply, whether it was in anger at his comment or because of the word 'relationship' Harry didn't know.
Once everyone was served, they ate in silence. It wasn't awkward, it was a comforting silence. The silence was broken when Tom cleared his throat after taking a sip of his wine. "We should talk about what happened yesterday."
Severus and Tom stayed to the side to watch how this encounter was going to play out. Molly had marched straight up to the nearest goblin and demanded why she could not pay for anything. Goblins hate wizards and witches who just
"Draco?" I pushed a box to her. She carefully opened it and then gasped. "Draco it is beautiful! I love it!"
"'Having fun'? That was the best you could do?!" Sirius laughed at Lucius' choice of wording. Just then, the door to the living room creaked open and two faces appeared; cheeks red and mouths swollen. "Clopsy!! I told you to leave them be if they were having fun!!" The adults laughed at Lucius who was whining and pouting. His wife opened her arms with a wide smile and he settled into them.
He snarled in the fat man's face and grabbed his cheeks with red-hot hands. Harry's magic had gone haywire and had taken control of Harry's body. It was almost like the magic was punishing Vernon, making him have a taste of his own medicine. There were burn marks all over his face and neck from where Harry's hands had touched him. They had the weirdest shapes too. They weren't hand prints at all, almost like they were grill marks or frying pan shaped...
Oh yeah, Minerva thought I would be a great teacher. I guess I am, but the part I hate is all the questions. They're the same every year.
Not long after Severus started to clap everyone was clapping, whooping and hooting. They clapped the Weasleys out of Gringotts and down the street, everyone joining in no matter whether they knew what had happened. All they knew was that they wanted to Weasleys gone.
Harry's life is pretty good. Ginny plays beater for the Hollyhead Harpies and is often away for months at a time. Harry owns a flower shop, named Lily's after his mother. He keeps himself busy when his girlfriend is gone. But a few months ago, Harry got some news from one of the girls on Ginny's team that shook his world.
"Ah, Harry my boy. Good to see you. How have you been?" Harry was assaulted by Albus' voice as he stepped through the doorway. He did not reply immediately, instead taking time to survey the room around him with cold eyes. The desk was still in the middle of the room, and shelves lined the walls with an assortment of objects decorating them. Fawkes sat on his perch watching Harry with a warm gaze and Albus sat behind his desk, hands on the table fixing Harry with his twinkling eyes.
"Harry Potter – The Boy Who Gayed – Single Pringle." Draco breathed. "Have you read mine?" He asked Harry in a whisper. "No." Harry replied softly.
Draco glared at Ron and shifted Harry into a more comfortable position in his arms. “If you must know Weasel, it is none of those.”
"So, where's the bathroom?" Harry demanded. Draco snorted one last time before composing himself and leading Harry out of the room.
Ginny raced up the stairs to her and Harry's shared bedroom. The door was shut so she opened it quietly and poked her head around the corner. She was met with the sight of two bodies curled up around each other, closer than she and Harry used to cuddle. Ginny started to drift from Harry due to all of her one night stands she had. She felt guilty she was doing it but she couldn't stop. It was something she needed; it was addictive.
‘When you rejected me in first year, I felt angry. Angry that you dared refuse a Malfoy what he wants. I felt sad, knowing that you didn’t want to know me. I grew with hearing stories about you. My mum would read me the same story every night, the one where you, a baby, stood up to the most evil man in the world, and destroyed him. I also felt like crying. It was a horrible feeling. Nobody except my family have ever made me cry. And there you were. An 11-year-old boy, with baggy clothes, adorable glasses, messy raven hair and the most enchanting eyes I have ever seen and I realised in that moment, I wanted you to be mine. In any way possible. So, when you rejected me, I couldn’t be your best friend. Or even a friend. I wanted something unique to me and you. So I fought you. I became your ‘rival’. It was the only way I could stay in your attention and not hide in the background.’ Draco pulled harry closer and nuzzled into his hair.
Draco smiled and placed his head in Harry's neck, "I love you too Harry." He replied, lips moving against Harry's neck making the taller boy shudder. Draco smirked. "You like that Harry? I wonder what else you like," He purred seductively into Harry's ear.
“Whattimeisit?  Whatareyoudoinghere?”  He stretched his arms up towards the headboard, yawning loudly.  Draco could hear his bones popping.
Once dinner was done, and everyone had had their fill of pudding, Harry and Teddy took their leave with promises of seeing everyone soon.
Draco looked back down at the table as Harry moved to stand against the island in the middle of the room.
“Hello, everyone!  I’m so glad you all could come to this spur-of-the-moment party!  I’m so glad to be home, and wanted to see everyone and catch up!  But, that isn’t the only reason why we planned this party.”
He gripped Harry’s bicep as they continued down the little street.  They stepped into Ogden’s shop and purchased some alcohol for the party.  They went from shop to shop to shop, until finally, arms and pockets loaded with shrunken packages, they made their way back to the tree lot.
“Well, since everyone decided to play, we decided that we aren’t going to play Truth or Dare.” A loud groan emitted through the group, with Blaise beginning to stand.  Neville spoke loudly over the crowd, “I just thought it would be fun to actually get to know each other! We’ve been living together for over 3 months, and while I can't speak for everyone, I still don't know a lot about a lot of you.”
“Not as much,” Ginny responded.  “She was being a bit ridiculous.  She is fully aware that we are never going to be together, but she blew up when I told her about Neville.  She cannot get over the fact that I am now 17, a legal adult in the wizard world, and can do as I wish.  To her, I am still the 10-year-old little girl seeing her brothers off to Hogwarts.” Ginny rolled her eyes.
They lay like that for several more minutes, enjoying the silence and comfort of each other.  Finally, when Harry knew he couldn’t lay about any longer, he stood up and pulled Draco into the shower with him, the two cleaning each other and pausing for long bouts of snogging.
Harry grinned, flicking his wrist.  A small wrapped box flew out of the top drawer of Harry’s dresser.
“Apparently, we have a link; a bond.”  As he told Draco what Ollivander told him, Draco’s expression changed from interest to apprehension.
“Ah! There it is!”  Harry grinned at him.  “I appreciate the effort, though, no matter the reason.”  He kissed him quickly before turning to grab his cloak and a piece of parchment, quill, and ink.
“Why are we talking about this?  And why are you both so calm about it?  This is Malfoy we are talking about!”
Draco looked around the room, taking in his large, loud family, and smiled.  He felt Harry place his hand on his knee and squeeze and put his hand over his and squeezed back.  He loved his life and wouldn’t have it any other way.
He walked into his en suite, deciding to take a shower.  He quickly cleaned himself, completely waking up underneath the spray of the water.  Stepping out of the tub, he wrapped himself in his favourite fluffy towel.
They were right.  It was barely dawn when a gangly ten-year-old jumped into the middle of their bed.
year students had been getting on very well the past few weeks, thanks to the wonderful invention of Firewhiskey.  Seamus had somehow been able to smuggle in several bottles, and so they partook of the spirits on Thursday evenings.  This was because the only class the group had on Friday’s was Potions, and since that didn’t begin until after lunch, they had ample time to overcome their hangovers before facing a professor.
Harry chuckled as Draco swiftly swung the blanket back, quickly walking across the room to the en suite.  It wasn’t too long before he was walking back into the room.
Harry pulled back after several moments, grabbing the sides of Draco’s face, saying, “Gods, it’s good to see you.  I’ve missed you something terrible.”
Harry looked up from his place on the couch in front of the fireplace, biscuit half-way to his mouth.
Standing there, Harry quickly took in the man before him.  Draco had dark circles under his eyes.  He looked even paler than usual, and his eyes held no light in them.  He was wearing a white button-up shirt and the jeans that Harry had convinced him to purchase.  Harry wanted to hex himself when his insides began to squirm with desire.
Harry walked over to the table, pouring the tea out.  Turning to ask how he took his, Malfoy said, “Two sugars,” and then took the cup from Harry, sitting down.  “Thanks, Potter.”
“See? Make yourself at home; food and music is downstairs, muggle television across the hall, etcetera. I'll go get the door and be right back!”
“Well, let’s unpack first.  Start a load of laundry?  And then, start wrapping.  We have dinner at Ron and Hermione’s tonight, we go to the Manor tomorrow, and spend Christmas morning there, too, and then to the Burrow for Christmas supper and Boxing Day?  Right?”
Harry couldn’t seem to take his eyes off the man’s back.  Shaking himself, he moved his eyes away.  “I’m glad.  I think I might write a letter to Mr. Ollivander, though, and ask what all that could have meant.  He didn’t mention anything like that when we talked.”
“Well, mum knew that we were supposed to come help you, so she was adamant that we get here early,” Ron said, with a roll of his eyes and then a wide grin.
“HERMIONE!”  Harry screamed back up the stairs, causing the curtain on the portrait of Mrs Black to bang open, giving her time to throw out a few obscenities before Ron and Hermione were by his side.  Ron threw a spell at the portrait, shutting it up, and Hermione, finally seeing what Harry had yelled for, gasped loudly, covering her mouth with her hand.
He could see her usually pinched face relax, eyes widening slightly.  Harry swore he saw a small smile on her face as she said, “Thank you for the invitation, Harry.”  Harry grinned at the use of his given name.  “I'd be honoured.”
Draco had been staring at the empty space in the closet while Harry spoke his spiel.  He had always wanted to move in, but at the same time, he was afraid to.  As he told Harry, the place didn’t feel right without Harry there, and when he was gone on his missions, it was hard to stay there without him.  But, he wanted this to be his home.  To be
Harry opened the window, letting the bird inside.  They all received a blast of freezing cold air, and Harry noticed that it looked like it would start snowing again at any moment.
“Sandwiches it is.  Give me just a moment.”  He stepped out of the room for just a moment, and then came back in and took a seat.
Harry ripped the wrapping paper off of the small box, handing the paper to Draco, who banished it with a flick of his wrist.  Harry took the lid off the box to see two painted coffee mugs.  He pulled them out, handing the one that had a messy ‘D’ on it to Draco, keeping the one with the ‘H’.  “Ted, these are brilliant!  You made them?”
“Thanks.  Got him a couple of days ago.  Still getting used to the idea, if I’m being honest.”  He flicked his wand and a few owl treats came and landed on the table.  Harry put them in his hand, and the owl came over and nipped them from his palm.  Harry rubbed the birds head.
Neville snarled and lunged towards my mate. Faster than I ever thought possible, I stood up and grabbed Neville and flung him onto the nearest table. I felt the control on my magic slip due to my anger and I used it to pin him down on to the table.
"Nonsense!" Tom exclaimed. "Potter has written a letter to my husband, and I want to know what is in it. Mainly because I want a drink..." Severus sighed. "If you wanted a drink, you could just get a drink love." Tom just smiled sheepishly.
“Leave him alone weasel.” Draco said with a sneer. “Don’t tell me what to do snake. How about you leave him alone you slimy git!?” Ron retorted. “No, no don’t. Please love, do not let me go. I only want to be with you.” I shoved my face into his neck and he started gently stroking my hair again. Around us the Gryffindor’s gasped in horror. Cries of “you’ve poisoned harry!” and “the slimy slytherin has used his power to control harry!” were heard from the crowd.
Draco bit his lip thoughtfully. "I said, why is Potter writing to you?" He let Potters owl in, taking the letter and feeding her a treat.
He pushed his shirt back down and exited the bathroom, knocking lightly on what he thought was Draco's door. A muffled, "Come in!" was barely heard and Harry hesitantly pushed open the door. He saw the room had a green theme going on, not necessarily Slytherin green, but that was there. It had a massive painting of a forest on one wall, the trees moving in the breeze. Tigers could be seen prowling around, hunting for food. Harry gasped, it was beautiful!
"Alright! Fine. I'll help you." Gosh, Pansy is such a toad in the morning. So grumpy. So grouchy. She needs multiple mugs of coffee I reckon. "YES!" I yelled, punching the air with my fist. I watched as Pansy stumbled out of bed and plodded towards my wardrobe.
Draco had never felt so safe. Who would've thought that warmth, hot chocolate, blankets and another person would bring him that sense of safety? He loved it. When he finished his drink, he placed the empty mug on a nearby table before settling back into the hot body engulfing him and snuggling deep into it before drifting off to sleep with a small smile on his face.
his smirk. He trailed a line of hot, searing kisses along my jaw, teasing me into making short sharp gasps until he reached my mouth. He was a hairs-breadth away from my lips, breathing on my lips as his eyes bored into my wide eyes. I think I whimpered... but I'm not too sure. He looks quite smug so if I did, he definitely heard it.
"What took so long Freak? Who's at the door? More of your freaky friends?" The voice thundered before a slap was heard. Draco fumed, how dare he hit Harry! He burst through the door, wand held pointing at Vernon. "I was right." Vernon said. "It was one of your freaky friends. You cant do magic outside of school; didn't think I knew that did you!?" he snickered.
The former slytherin couldn't understand why Ginny did it. She had everything with Harry; money, probably fantastic sex, unconditional love and security. Why was she throwing it around for a few meaningless fucks? Draco couldn't wrap his head around it.
“I know what he looks like when he is happy or sad, angry or aroused. I know how to help him with his insecurities and his panic attacks. I know his favourite sweets, chocolates, places, people and smells. I know his dreams, his nightmares, where he wants to go in the world. Where he does and doesn’t feel safe – one place he does feel safe is in my arms and a place he doesn’t feel safe is his dorm. Just thought you might want to know.”
Draco's eyes couldn't look away, he was hypnotized. Only when the door had shut with a soft click did he realise he had been staring. He was so fucked.
"Move boy." Harry trudged over to the car and pulled his trunk into the boot. He slid into the passenger seat next to his fat whale of a cousin and stared out of the window until they reached the house. He sighed, this was going to be a long summer.
Just then Hermione walked into the dorm. "MIONE!! HELP!!" I screeched. "My courtier wants to meet in half an hour!!!"
As Harry slipped into unconscious, his last thoughts were about Snape and if he was going to save him.
October 31st, my parents were killed. I was orphaned and Dumbledore ensured I was placed with my muggle relatives – Petunia and Vernon Dursley. He left a letter with a large amount of money in to ensure my 'wellbeing'. My 'wellbeing' isn't what you would have expected from the 'Chosen one'. You would've thought it was meant to pamper me, give me the best luxuries money could buy. I didn't get that. I was treated worse than a house elf. I still am.
“Come along potty, you have a stain on your shirt; I will take you to the bathroom and help get it off.”
"You'll be screaming that at some point..." Harry said, wiggling his eyebrows, his voice dropping down a tone.
Harry whispered to Draco in awe but everyone still heard. "Your mum is badass." Draco whispered back, "I know."
Sirius hummed and then giggled. He turned to Remus with a smile on his face. "Remember when we were like that at age 15? Literally couldn't keep our hands off each other once we had sex." Remus flushed before punching his mate in the shoulder. Harry's face was pinched in a way that signified disgust. "Ew, Siri I did not need to know that." Draco snorted before steering Harry into the shop.
"Go on then Harry." Draco whispered in his ear, and nudged him slightly. Harry smiled at him shyly before picking a bit of everything. Draco did the same, both teens not realising how hungry they really were.
"Okay Pansy. So, my plain black skirt that goes half way down my thighs, skin coloured tights.... hmmm what shirt...." I started to mumble to myself. I am now starting to show signs of madness. Fuck.
Draco didn't mind his companion. He was pretty lonely, which was to be expected. He liked the company, but he was sad when it left five minutes before they returned to the castle. It would always run off and he wouldn't see it till the next day after school.
Then my world came crashing down and I gasped. I staggered backwards. I felt like a bucket of ice water just dumped itself on my head.
"Hmm. Its a Saturday so you can spend the weekend getting everything you need and then you can distribute it during the week. It should still be snowy next weekend so you can ask her out at the weekend." Pansy suggested. I contemplated it for a moment, eyes automatically flicking over to Harry who still has flakes of snow in her hair. "That sounds like a good idea Pans. What on earth would I do with out you two?"
"HARRY JAMES POTTER WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING!?" She screamed, waking the two men up from their peaceful slumber. Harry tightened his arms around the blond and pulled him close to his chest.
"That wasn't a proper kiss Potter. Kiss me properly." I pout at him, knowing he can't resist me when I'm like this. This has worked for 19 years. It damn well won't stop working now.
Harry just sat there in Draco's arms a dazed look on his face, still trying to process the information he had just been given. "We are soulmates?" He breathed. Draco nodded and Harry's face lit up. "Awesome!!" Was all Draco got before Harry smashed his lips onto Draco's. Draco's hands flew up to grab Harry's head and hold him in place as he kissed back. Harry tilted his head more to the side to allow Draco more room to get closer. To reward him, Draco swept his tongue across Harry's full, lower lip making the raven haired gasp. Draco swallowed the gasp and plundered his soulmates mouth, tasting every single inch of him.
A cough pulled them from their once-sweet-but-now-makeout-to-sex-session and the boys saw a smug Sirius and an amused Remus.
Remus noticed Draco's thunderous expression and smiled knowingly. "Hey, cub, might want to get back to your boyfriend..." Harry turned around to look at Draco who was trying and failing to paste an innocent look onto his face. Harry giggled before throwing himself into his soulmates arms. He kissed Draco hard on the mouth and discretely squeezed Draco's bulge making the blond want to take him right there and then.
All of a sudden, a warm, hairy body brushed against his legs making him shriek and drop his fork. Everyone turned to look at him, some snickering, some confused. Draco blushed. He was not going to be able to get people to forget about this.
Harry hummed and flashed a grin at Draco before disappearing into the bathroom. He sighed 'this is so weird'. The past few months have been a rollercoaster for Harry, discovering his cheating friends, being choked to death by potions, learning about his history with Grapclaw in Gringotts, scaring the shit out of the Headmaster and then him retaliating by forcing Harry to live with his abusive relatives. And then being rescued by the 'Dark Lord', his husband and his crush and crushes family. Plus, what was that light that had surrounded him and Draco?
Ginny scowls at Draco before turning to Harry with a flirtatious look on her face. "But Harry, you're not gay!"
Ginny catches Harry and Draco in their bed and Ginny calls Draco a Death Eater. Harry defends Draco and its bye-bye Ginny.
"Harry James Malfoy-Potter, will you please just kiss me already!? I haven't seen you for 4 months! I missed you!" I don't care that I'm whining.
"How was your shower boys?" Severus asked with a blank face, eyes twinkling with amusement. "I think you'll find there were two showers, thank you very much." Harry sniffed and turned his nose up. Lucius barked out another laugh, "You got so dirty you had to shower again?! Really boys!"
Remus and Sirius sat down on the empty sofa cuddling up close. Narcissa and Lucius were leaning on each other and Tom had Severus in between his legs dozing slightly.
"No." whispered Lucius shaken and angry. Draco looked between the adults. "Have I missed something?"
"Can I come over Harry?" When Harry nodded Draco stepped through the green flames into Harry's home. He wrapped his arms around the brunet who stiffened at first before finally relaxing. "When you found out... did it hurt?" Draco whispered.
I could care less about the fact I'm in the middle of the corridor with hundreds of eyes on us and I do care less, but I am feeling slightly conscious of the fact I
Narcissa stood up suddenly. "Where does he live?" she demanded. Tom turned over the envelope to find the sender address. "No. 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey" he responded. "I'm getting him now, before those filthy muggles touch him." An argument broke out between the adults who were trying to calm Narcissa down and make sure she doesn't kill anybody.
"Well..." Oh look, she is fingering the necklace. Nervous. "Before this whole courting thing, I had a crush on you. Like, so much I thought I was in love with you. And then I started to get these gifts and small notes and I slowly started to fall for the person behind them - even though I didn't know who it was. It scared me. You were my first crush and then someone else comes and sends me beautiful gifts that mean so much to me and I didn't know what to do. It was Thursday when I decided I should try get over you. I was hoping that whoever this person was may help me get over you. But I don't need to anymore!! Cos it's you!" she finished with wide eyes, sparkling from the reflections off the snow.
Anyways, I don't actually know what snogging is like. I have no desire to snog/kiss/make-out/whatever you want to call it. As an asexual hooman being, I personally cannot really handle physical contact but that's just me so I hope I write the kissing scenes correctly.
You could hear ‘Dray’ sigh. “I know love, I know. But think about it this way, it won’t be long before you can put those good for nothing Weasels in Azkaban.”
I hope you liked this @Hufflepuffpride13!! I loved writing this. I hope you didn't mind me putting the photos in, they helped describe the gifts from Draco to Harry.
Harry looked up at him, "Really?" he asked slightly breathless. Draco glowered at Lucius, wanting Harry's expression of delight and happiness aimed at him. Lucius saw his sons jealousy and smirked, making Draco glower harder. Harry noticed Draco's expression and snickered quietly. "Something wrong Draco?" Harry asked, innocently.
His love for the boy grounds him so he doesn’t go and kill whoever did this to Harry in a fit of rage. He has to be calm for Harry. He can’t scare him away or Harry will never recover.
She looked over to my bedside table. "What's that?" She asked, pointing at the red box from earlier.
"FENNY!!!!!" Harry yelled before launching himself at the werewolf. Fenrir soon found his arms full of Harry Potter in front of his Lord, his Lords husband and his most loyal family. Well, shit.
"Last night, when I went to the toilet I swore the floor was covered in rose petals... Jesus I have the weirdest dreams."
He pulled Draco flush to him, grabbing onto whatever he could find with curious hands - shoulders, waist, arms, face and at one point, his arse. Draco nipped his bottom lip every so often, making Harry weak in the knees and turning his wandering hands desperate.
“What do you want Malfoy.” Ginny says rising up to face him, falling into a defensive stance, wand out. “Oh nothing, just Harry here.” I raise my eyebrow at him. He raises one right back and smiles softly. Softly. Draco fucking Malfoy just softly smiled at me. What? Why?? He chuckled at my obvious confusion (quite fondly I’ll have you know). My heart is doing somersaults (not sure why. I admit it though; he is kinda cute and very handsome. Shhh!!) whereas my brain is thinking this is so suspicious. Ginny grabs my arm and pulls me towards her. Apparently, I had taken a step forward without realising. I snatched my arm back and glared at her. She snarled at me and so I growled back, telling her to back off. She grimaced and with her nose high in the air, she turned on her heel and stalked out the room.
Harry bolted up and turned around to face the voice. He recognised it, but wasnt sure why. Low, very deep and, it was quite similar to a growl. He took in the big, thick coat hanging off broad shoulders packed full of muscle, the tshirt stretched so thin over a muscular chest that the man should have not even bothered to put one on. Dark jeans wrapped around thick thighs and unlaced boots finished the outfit. Shaggy hair was pulled up into a bun on the back if the mans head which was covered in scars.
“You then need to do something to get his attention, something you usually wouldn’t do – for example… hmm, let me think… like… go and try tame an vicious chicken or even jump off a tree. “
Draco scoffed. "Psht, don't say such hurtful things Harry, or I shall be forced to kiss you again." He grinned even though Harry couldn't see it.
"PANSY! I have a problem!!! I dont know what to wear! Today is a hogsmeade weekend and I bet she will be there and I am freaking out cos I want to make a good impression on her and-"
"Can I put it in your hair for today?" Hermione asked after a few minutes of silence. I nodded eagerly making her chuckle. I turned around and she set to work weaving it into my hair. When she was finished, I admired myself in the mirror before gasping at the time. "Mione! Breakfast! We are going to be late!"
He smirks at me when he sees my reaction to him growling. His eyes were twinkling dangerously and he looked like he wanted to eat me.
Harry finished in the bathroom, chuckling at the expensive soap on the sink as he washed his hands. Once he had finished he stood there, staring into the mirror. His hair was greasy from not being able to shower and he felt so unclean. He couldn't wait for a lovely hot shower. He observed that he didn't hurt anymore, the scars were faded instead of being an angry red, pushing up on his skin and there were no bruises. Was this from the golden light thingy?
Albus Dumbledore was cleaning the mess his last victim made when the alarm connected to the Dursley's went off. It always went off; it was an alarm connected to Harry and it tracked the progress of the abuse the Dursley's had inflicted. This meant it measured the amount of pain they put Harry through but this time the alarm was whining so loud it suggested Harry was dying. Albus panicked. He couldn't die now! He had plans for the boy! He had a path to follow - his fate was written in the words of that prophecy! Harry will defeat Tom and he will make sure Harry gets into a tragic accident afterwards, in which he dies, and gain his fame. That's how it will work! Well, it wont if he doesn't get a wriggle on and go save the boy's life.
I untied the ribbons before sliding them off. Dropping them down onto my bed I slowly peeled off the lid to the box. Moving the tissue paper to the side I gasped when I saw what was inside.
Draco pushed a little more into the kiss and his hand moved to cup Harry's head, holding him in place as he shyly ran his tongue across Harry's bottom lip.
"Please do." was all Harry said before walking over to the bathroom swinging his hips flirtatiously.
He took in my shocked appearance and chuckled warmly. Potter walked forward a few steps so he was in front of me.
I need to write notes for her. And I need to ask Hermione if I can have the password for the Gryffindor dorms or if she can help me set this up...
"Boys, I need you to look at me. This is important." Tom demanded. Both boys turned their heads towards him curiously. "Now, what just happened and that golden light are connected, yes? That light only appears when a magical person is in unbelievable amounts of pain and their soulmate is in the same room." He stopped to let it sink in.
Another pointed cough made My Draco giggle into my mouth so I sighed against his lips and pulled away to glare at the person who dares to disturb my make out session.
"So you cheat on me with a filthy Death Eater. Just because you want a shag? Dont think I didnt see its surprise when you decided you were dating." She spat venomously. In a flash Harry was out of the bed, naked, with his wand in his hand pointing at the bitches throat.
A way to remember whom you love, to remember them in the worst of times, to know your love is absolute.
knows how much taste I have. She tastes me often you know." I wink at him before looking around the hall, feigning interest. At the other end of the table I can see Hermione staring at me with her mouth wide open. I don't acknowledge her.
Severus sighed wetly before saying, "It appears so. I haven't even looked at his punishment chart yet." "Punishment chart?" Tom asked aghast. Severus hummed and handed him the letter.
"You always were one for dramatic entrances weren't you?" Harry sighed exasperatedly before flashing a quick grin at Draco. Draco spluttered. He opened and closed his mouth a few times before snapping it shut and choosing to glower at Harry instead of insulting him. "Watcha need Malfoy?" Harry asked politely. "Um... do you have any dark coloured Dhalias and light coloured Daffodils?" Draco asked.
The break before 8th year had done Potter good. Although Draco himself was skinny and pale, Potter had grown, now to be taller than Draco. He must've been working out over the break as he was ripped which always made Draco's brain swirl into fantasies that could never happen. It didn't matter if they were friends now, Potter had the Weaslette. After the war, Potter got rid of his glasses and replaced them with muggle contacts. Now it meant that whenever they made eye contact, his green piercing eyes looked into Draco's soul. Draco found it scary but hot at the same time.
Then I saw Hermiones spare bags enchanted with an undetectable expansion charm. I grabbed one and started shoving petals into it. Hopefully she wont mind.
Lucius had bought all of Harry's books and was now in Gringotts making sure Harry's accounts and vaults were all secured. Whilst he was there, he did admin on his own vaults to protect them from old, manipulative, senile men. Once finished, he followed his Point Me Spell to his wife, child and his childs soulmate.
Harry giggled, "You would know all about being indecorous wouldn't you Draco. Don't think I didn't see you staring at my ass when I left to go to the bathroom!" Lucius practically howled before his wife who was biting back her own peals of laughter smacked him lightly. Draco buried his head in his hands. "Merlin I hate you all. Except Tom, Tom is nice to me."
“Well, you all are leaving in two days.  The rest of us leave in five,” Ginny said, as they stepped through into the hustle and bustle of the alley.
“Brilliant,” he said as he sank back into the plush sofa.  “Glad you’re back, mate. Mum will be thrilled to know you’re alive.  She constantly was checking the clock to make sure your hand didn’t switch over to ‘Mortal Peril.’  She has been worried sick about you.  Just makes my case that she likes you better than all of us even stronger, as mine, George’s, and Charlie’s are constantly moving to ‘Mortal Peril’ and she never fusses over us.”
“Thank you for your wonderful hospitality, Harry.  I hope that when you are finished with your renovations, I will be invited back to see your progress.”
They laughed as Hermione slapped them both in the back of the head as they made their way back down the stairs.  When they walked back into the kitchen, Louis, Bill and Fleur’s youngest, thrust a plate of gingerbread men cookies at them.
Pansy yawned. "Hmm, what about the green turtleneck, the skintight one?" Millicent suggested. "Ah Millicent! Welcome to the land of the living!" I teased lightly. "Fuck off Draco. Do you want my help or not?" I giggled. "Thanks Millie." "Oh, and do that half up half down hairstyle where the top half is in a plait." I beamed at Millicent and thanked her.
"Anyways! We need to have a serious chat, boys." Tom pulled everyone back on track. "Okay, so we know that you can only find your soulmate if one is in unbelievable amounts of pain and the other is in the same room right? The fact that you two have found each other, and so young I might add, is astounding yet sad. The amount of pain Harry was in makes me want to kill those muggles all over again. But, I am happy for both of you. Finding your soulmate is rare, finding them and living together is even rarer."
"Yes, Draco. They would." He still spoke in a hushed voice. I don't even remember what my question was. But he said yes, so... that's what I wanted right?
"CLOPSY!" The house elf squeaked before blushing and looking at the ground. Harry spoke softly. "It's okay Clopsy, we will pretend we don't know anything other than that there are photos involved, and you can keep doing your surprise yes?" The small elf nodded happily before snapping her fingers and hot chocolate in mugs filled a tray on the table. "Bye-bye Masters and Mistress!" She popped away.
Harry gasps and flings himself at Draco. Draco, not expecting this action falls backwards onto the floor with harry on top of him. He grabs the smaller boy and made sure he was ok. ‘Harry? Are you hurt? Are you okay? What’s wrong?’
"For those of you who do not understand what drarry is, it is my One True Pairing and the two boys are – drum roll please." The school started to drum roll on the tables in excitement.
She crept towards the bed, hidden in the shadows. One head had a mop of dark curly hair - Harry. The other head was platinum blond and cut short. It looked like a dudes head to be honest. Carefully, she peeled back the covers.
If you could not tell by now, I am trying to court you. At the end of the week I will send a note to you asking to meet up.
The two teens spluttered and blushed furiously. "NO!" They yelled in unison. "We had separate showers father, I will have you know. And please, get your heads out of the gutters, it is highly indecorous." Draco said, embarrassed about his misbehaving family.
In the end, I walked out in a pair of blue jeans, a type of soft leather boots which were lined in fur, a thick jumper with a soft and warm coat over the top. I wore simple grey coloured glove, hat and scarf. My hair was done half up half down with the second hair accessory i got. I felt like it was more wintery themed than the other. I wore my rings and the necklace too. I can't wait to see who my courtier is!
They got lost in a deep filthy kiss again, and when Harry was on the edge of losing his mind, Draco shifted, in a silent permission for Harry to start moving.
‘It’s a good thing,’ he whispered in his mind. ‘A good, happy thing, and you’re very happy about it even if it wasn’t planned and nobody is dying so no need to freak out.’
Harry move slowly, coming to lay on his back next to him, both their gazes lost on the ceiling. Harry raised his arm, dropping it so it covered his eyes, and Draco let out a little laugh.
But most importantly, Harry had promised Minerva he’d do everything he could so that nothing would happen to her new DADA teacher.
Harry was getting more and more hot and dizzy. The horniness coming back full force now that he was ‘safe’. As safe as one could be in a room with Draco Malfoy.
They couldn’t take the appointment in a week day because of Draco’s teaching hours. With the final exams coming, both fifth and seventh years were always asking for more hours and advices and the workload was heavier than ever.
It was a wet Wednesday and the storm had come a few days earlier than people suspected. Harry had to move all his flowers inside less they get destroyed by the wind and hail. He was watering the last of his flowers when the door slammed open with a gust of wind and a sopping wet person stepped through. They pushed down their hood. Harry gasped when he saw Draco. Tall, slim, muscular (he could tell because his shirt was stuck to his skin) and unfairly handsome. No one except Hermione and Harry knew of Harry's sexual orientation. He was Bisexual and right now his gay was definitely showing.
Harry looked to Draco and they had a silent conversation through their eyes. Eventually Draco nodded and Harry smiled before casting a Muffliato around the four. "We are soulmates! Over the summer, I asked Sev for help. The Dursleys were particularly abusive this holiday so I was forced to ask for help. I asked Severus, thinking he may have a soft spot for Lily still and he is good at healing. I was anticipating a portkey to Pomfrey. Instead I got this gorgeous blonde, an awesome second mother, a snarky second father and two amazing uncles. They took me in and I have been with them since." Harry smiled at Draco and snuggled into him.
"We can go there after you have peed. I need to change my clothes and as you don't have any, you can borrow some of mine." He smiled at Harry before returning to his instructions of how to get to the bathroom. "Anyways, before you interrupted me," a weak glare was thrown Harry's way and Harry smiled sheepishly. "You turn left, go down the hall and it is the first door on the right. My bedroom is right opposite it so if you need me, I'm there." He smiled at Harry again as they reached the bathroom. "Here you go, I'll be in my room just there alright?"
I grabbed his hand and pulled it off where it was stroking my hair and dropped it. It gravitated back to his body and hung limply beside him. Giving the best glare I could muster whilst feeling so embarrassed about having Potters hand in my hair and being so tired, I spoke. "Don't touch my hair Potter. Or I will hex you into next week." He sighed mockingly and replied with a "But you do that
Draco looked back up, "What are you doing in my room Potter?" Harry smiled sheepishly, "We were playing truth or dare in my dorm, and I was dared to co-"
Remus grinned and Sirius stood mouth agape. "Wow!" The dark haired man breathed. "That's amazing! It's so rare! Tell me the rest of the details later. I'm sure you're quite busy today."
"You do not know how long I have waited for you to say that." He said in a tone just as quiet before leaning in and showing Harry really just how long he had been waiting for.
The adults were in the living room, discussing Harry's safety for when he returned to Hogwarts. They were bouncing ideas back and forwards but could not find the perfect idea. They wanted to protect Harry and Draco's relationship from the Light side but at the same time, they wanted to exploit its uses. A chime from the floo brought the adults back into reality as their eyes registered a pair of men standing in the middle of the room; one smirking and confident, the other blushing and more awkward.
"DAD!" Draco yelled in mortification, hiding his face in his hands. Harry burst out laughing. "Dray, you practically asked for him to respond with that!" "Shut up Harry!"
"Harry, it's actually normal to feel like this..." Narcissa said into Harry's hair. "Really?" he asked, bright green doe eyes peeking up from under his hair. "Yes, Harry, it is." She reassured. "This actually is something we needed to talk about. It concerns the golden ball of light yesterday," "The one that made me hurt?" Narcissa flinched. "Yes Harry, the one that made you hurt."
It is so unfair how he will never want me as I want him – a boyfriend. I love his walk, the way he swaggers and keeps his head high and those gorgeous silver eyes…
It was a routine he liked. He liked to imagine what they would be doing with their lives if they were alive. Would they have pets? A family? What career did they want to chase? It made him sad, but he felt it was the least he could do for them. Who else was to remember them?
In unison two sets of eyes, one bright green the other dark grey, widened in disbelief and understanding looking at the other before looking away again. "So... what you're saying is that... we're soulmates?" Draco whispered shakily. Tom nodded. "Oh my god." Harry breathed before passing out in Draco's arms.
‘Harry’ he whispers softly. ‘Harry please look at me. I’m not gonna hurt you. Harry please.’ he feels like breaking down and crying but he has to be strong. He has to be strong for Harry. Harry slowly looks up and Draco’s stormy silver eyes meet Harry’s emerald eyes. He gives a small smile to Harry. ‘Can you come over here please love?’ He didn’t realise he had said the term of endearment until Harry stated to crawl over slightly. He gives an encouraging smile and holds his arms out slowly. ‘That’s a good boy, Harry. Aren’t you a good boy?’ He keeps talking to Harry softly as harry makes his way over to Draco.
“I don’t like it Dray. He just flings my name around like a boomerang; it cuts anyone down who doesn’t listen to him. I hate it.” One voice complained.
Why am I so nervous?!?! It's just Harry. You know, the girl of my dreams, my heart and I am pretty sure she is my soulmate. Okay maybe that soulmate part was a bit far fetched... And anyways, dumbass, that 'pep talk' was crap.
"Pansy!" I whined. "You can't replace me! I thought I was your only best friend!" She giggled a little before wrapping her right arm around my shoulders. I scowled at the chain of metal around her neck as she came closer. "You will
About a month after he found out about Ginny's whorish tendencies, Harry got a customer he would never have expected.
Neville, to my right gave me a sniff. “Yeah, Harry! You smell bloody gorgeous!!” He then reached out to me but was stopped when a hand came in between us. Immediately I felt safe but all the Gryffindor’s growled at my saviour. I frowned and turned to my saviour.
Lucius looked at his son, proud that he found his soulmate. He looked back down to the abusive muggle on the floor. He spat in his face.
Harry giggled again, "Well, to be honest I wouldn't mind it if you did kiss me again..." he said cheekily as Draco fake gasped.
Finally, he reaches Draco and he just sits there on the floor looking wretched. It tore Draco’s heart to see his love like this. He just gazed into Harry's emerald orbs trying to push his emotions like love, care and worry to the front. He didn’t want harry to see the anger, fury and rage he felt. That would not help Harry right now. Another time maybe. Harry had stopped crying by now; however, he still looked skittish so Draco moved slightly to gauge his reaction. Harry didn’t flinch which was good. Draco slowly reached out towards the cute boy and made sure harry could see his hands.
He does not want to know when students are doing the dirty. Ew ew ew ew ew ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Nope. Nope. Nope. Severus grimaced and shook his head trying to get the idea out of his head. Gah!
The door opened and Draco appeared, shirtless, obviously just having got out of a shower as water was still on his chest. He was wearing black joggers that rested low on his hips and his hair was mussed up in a sexy way. He was holding a shirt in his hand, pulling it on as Harry stared, mouth dry at his host. "I quite agree with you, I could really do with some new shelves." Draco said, voice muffled as he struggled with his shirt.
I heard two giggles from behind me where Pansy and Granger were. I ignored them and decided to reply to Potter with a witty comment.
The heat of the potions classroom was obviously getting to Harry and malfoys head. The fumes are making
Maybe, maybe this love was returned and Harry's chest filled with hope at the possibility of finally, being loved.
Harry giggled, "Well yeah, and anyways Malfoy I thought we were using first names. Or did our kiss mess with your memory?"
Harry whined. “But Drayyyyyyy. I don’t wanna,” he said whilst giving his boyfriend he best pout he could.
“Oh fuck!” I whispered. My eyes were wide and I was trembling so much I needed the table for support. My legs felt like a jelly jinx was used on them. I couldn’t stop shaking.
Anyways, I hope you like this chapter. Tell me your thoughts!! I look forward to reading your feedback and your comments. I love reading peoples comments. Makes me feel accomplished and proud.
It all started when Harry overheard his best friends arguing. Normally he would have ignored it had he not heard his name thrown around. They were arguing on how to spend some money so Harry was confused as to what he had to do with it. All was revealed when Ron said, "Mione, we're getting ahead of ourselves for a second. We need to kill him first before we can use his money." Harry gasped; they were planning to kill him? How dare they?! He trusted them! Well, not anymore.
"– what they are I do not know and do not ever wish to find out. For the first 10 years of my life, I didn't have a bedroom. I lived in the cupboard under the stairs – I kid you not. It was always dark and cold. There were spiders and the occasional cockroach. Being a lonely young boy, naturally I made friends with them. I haven't ever had friends when I was younger, so when I came to Hogwarts and Draco insulted Weasley I decided I didn't want to get to know him. I regret that now but I do not know how to bring it up with him. Do you have any suggestions? I just wish to mend bridges I should've crossed years ago." Tom looked over to Draco who was staring at the wall with a small smile across his face. The adults gave each other knowing looks.
Whilst Draco sorted everyone out with his or her drinks, Severus read the letter silently. His audience waited patiently for him to finish. When he finally looked up, they could see tears brimming his eyes, threatening to fall. He took in a shuddering breath. "Lucius, he-he has be-been through wha-what I-I have b-been through." He sobbed falling into his Tom's arms.
Draco cleared his throat and a faint blush washed across his cheeks before responding to the boy who he thought was really an angel in disguise. "Yes, I'm fine Harry," he smiled briefly, eyes darting around the table before lighting up when they saw a certain dish. "Would you like some treacle tart Harry?" He asked sweetly, making Lucius snort at Draco's attempt at regaining Harry's attention. He quickly glared at his father before looking at Harry finding adoration shining through his eyes towards Draco. Draco felt the jealousy in his chest subside for now. He grabbed a plate and then proceeded to plop 4 treacle tarts on the ceramic before passing it to Harry with a fork.
I take a chance and I mouth the next bit: please help me, I beg you. However, the cold hearted bastard just smirks at me.
Draco hummed lightly before frowning. "Speaking of relatives, why did they hurt you?" Harry sighed. "Ask the hard questions first why dont you?" Harry teased. "When I was orphaned, I was left with my muggle relatives. That was the first mistake. Petunia was jealous of my mother. She hated her sister and despised magic. It was a wonderful thing she could not weild. From the very start I was bound to be neglected by her. Dumbledore, however, anticipated this and ensured it would happen by paying them to abuse me. He wanted me broken, easy to manipulate and manage for his own uses and plans."
Harry just laughed. The Slytherin had stopped running and was now panting slightly, face red. Harry was not too sure if his face was red from exertion or the slap...
The next day around breakfast time, just outside the Great Hall a boy with messy raven hair and emerald eyes was walking to breakfast when a red headed male behind him shouted for his attention.
"Harry, I dare you to go into Malfoy's room and kiss him on the lips. I bet he is asleep by now, but if he wakes up, you must tell him how you feel." Neville said mischievously. Harry groaned, "Oh Neville! Must I?" He looked at him pleadingly. Neville snickered and nodded. "But you were meant to be on my side!!" Harry complained. "Eh, well off you go!!" Neville shooed Harry out into the hallway.
I drop my head into my hands. “I can’t believe 2 things Malfoy.” I mutter as Malfoy moves slightly closer.
“You’re brilliant.  I knew there was a reason I kept you around,” Draco teased, moving to straddle the bar.
He tugged his cloak closer around him, and then waited to be maneuvered wherever they were going.  Who he thought was Hermione took his hand, and he was tugged down what felt like a dirt road.  He felt a hand on his back, guiding him forward.  They walked what he imagined was a several hundred meters, and then was stopped.  He heard metal scraping and people whispering, but couldn’t make out who was talking, or what was said.  He was walked a little way more and then stopped again.
Draco snapped out of his reverie.  “Nothing, sorry.  Just admiring how great you are with him.  So, this is my cousin, I suppose?”
Molly was the first to stand, sending packages to all of the Weasley’s, Hermione, Angelina, Neville, and Harry.  Harry grinned wide as he quickly opened up his newest Weasley sweater, this one a royal blue, with a light grey H.  He looked around the see what colours everyone else received, noting that Neville had a shocked look on his face.  Harry caught his eye, smiling wide and giving the shocked man a wink of encouragement.
After spending several more hours shopping, eating lunch, and admiring more of the beautiful sights, they made their way back to their room.
They quickly descended the stairs.  Walking into the sitting room, Draco noticing McGonagall and Narcissa were sitting in the two chairs beside the fire, which just left the sofa for the two men to sit on.
It wasn’t long before a large group of parents and children came in from outside, and then suddenly, Harry had a lapful of his goddaughter.
“Why should you apologize?  You know you are welcome here, whenever you want.  Who did you argue with?  What was it about?”
Getting up, he went into the dorm and pulled out his bag, making sure he had everything he needed.  Going back out, he headed for the door.
Now carrying two more books, Harry chuckled to himself as he thought of the look on Hermione’s face when she saw him with all of the books.
Draco’s brows raised close to his hairline as he quickly sat up, blanket falling around his thighs as he gasped, “What?!”
“Er… yeah, of course.  That shouldn’t be a problem at all.   I will fix my wards to allow you in at 11:00?  Will that time be fine?”  Receiving a nod of agreement, Harry couldn't resist the question, “Why the Knight Bus?”
Down the table, it was Hermione and Pansy’s turn to get a round.  “Draco, do you want another…what did you call it, Harry?”
“Good morning, mother; Professor.  To what do we owe this honour?”  He moved to his seat at the head of the table, sitting down.  While his father was away, he was the man of the house, and so sat accordingly.
They walked back upstairs, hand in hand, and put on their boots and heavy coats.  They stepped onto the stoop, and Draco apparated them to the front entrance of the market.
They saw what looked like Ron and Hermione’s bags, as well as what they were guessing were Rose and Hugo’s things.  They made their way downstairs, greeted by most of the rest of the group, and found a place next to Charlie on the couch.
Speaking of, he had no more than gotten comfortable against his chest, than Harry breathed deep and tightened his grip around him.
Ollivander had given him specific instructions on how to do the transfer of powers, but also warned that because Harry had won the wand by force, it was possible that he would forever be able to use the wand in times of need.  Harry didn’t think anything of it, because really, why would he ever be close enough to Malfoy to need to use his wand?
“That I'm going to be stuck with you for the rest of my life?  That I'm going to be stuck with the Weasley’s as my in-laws?  That my mother is going to cause our eardrums to explode when we tell her we are engaged?  What?”
Harry stared at him for a few seconds before shrugging his shoulders and saying with a smile, “Eh, that’s a hell of a lot better than what I’ve been used for, previously.  I mean, I get pleasure out of it, too.”
Harry turned around and pulled Draco into his lap, clutching him hard around the waste.  He started sobbing.  “I’m so sorry!  I’m so sorry that I put you through all of this.  I didn’t know how… I didn’t know what to do.”  The last few words came out as a whisper.
They both emitted a loud moan, and then proceeded to mash their mouths together, so that they were connected from mouth to bulge.
“But, just think of how much fun you’ll have at Hogwarts,” Harry continued as he distributed their food.  “All the new friends you’ll make.”
“Draco, I am so glad that I was finally able to meet you.  I’m sorry I wasn’t a part of your life growing up.  I’d like to change that, going into the future.”  She pulled Teddy onto her hip.
“Well, I was going to bring you breakfast in bed, but I guess that is out the window,” he said with a wink, turning back to the pans on the fire.
It was such an odd feeling, and a tad uncomfortable, but it was worth it when things were moving quickly.
The lay like that for several minutes, as their hearts stopped racing and their breath became normal.
Draco grinned as he rolled his eyes and moved to stand behind Harry. “Okay, okay.” He conjured a blindfold, which he tied around Harry’s head.
“Yeah, sorry.”  He took a deep breath, letting it out slowly.  “The thing is, my childhood, well…I didn’t know it to be any different.”
Harry heard a noise in the room, so he took a moment to make sure all of his body parts were there and both his eyes were accounted for, then reached out of his hangings to grab his glasses.  Before he could reach them, though, a small vial was shoved into his hands.  Bringing his hand back in, he transferred the vial into his left hand, and again reached for his glasses.  Able to grab them this time, he shoved them onto his face, looked at the bottle and said aloud, “Oh, bless you, Malfoy.”
They had stayed up late the night before, talking and crying and listening to each other.  They hadn’t even eaten the dinner that Harry had made, instead asking Kreacher to put it away for later, and collapsing into bed in emotional exhaustion, well past midnight.
Draco opened his mouth, coaxing in Harry’s tongue.  He could taste a hint of treacle in Harry’s mouth.  What started out as a languid kiss soon became frenzied as Draco grabbed onto Harry’s hair with his good arm and started nipping on his bottom lip.
terms, so that he could reiterate over and over to Harry, and to himself, that he understood that it was
“Believe me, I wanted to.  So much.  But, like I said, I was embarrassed.  ‘The Great Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived’ is supposed to be the strong one.
“Well, lucky me.”  Draco started lightly massaging Harry’s socked feet.  “Don’t let me disturb your progress, though.  Let me see a teapot.”
“And then I went and did even more horrible things after coming out of that room alive.  I wish I could take it all back.  I wish—I wish…”  He broke down into more sobs.
Completely in his own head, Harry didn’t hear the first time someone tried to get his attention.  He finally snapped out of it when he felt a light kick on his shin and a “Earth to Potter” coming from across the table.  Looking up into the intense grey eyes of Draco Malfoy, Harry instantly knew he was a goner.
“That would be lovely, Kreacher.  Let’s put these up,” Draco said, gesturing to the box, “and then we will let you finish.”
“What do you think?” he asked quietly to Ron, Hermione, Draco, and George, who were the ones closest to him.
Harry, while keeping a straight face, tightened his grip on his own arms and stood up a bit straighter as Draco continued.
“Mr Malfoy, I’m sorry to barge into your home so early on a Saturday, but I just received information from the ministry.  The Aurors originally wanted to be the ones to speak to you, but as you are still at Hogwarts, you are still under by jurisdiction, and I felt I should be the one to come.  You will still probably receive an owl at some point this morning, though.”
“Harry? Do you mind if I use the floo?”  Hermione stood at the top of the landing, causing Harry to wave a confirmation as he continued descending.
Narcissa and Lucius walked up to them, and Minerva made her leave.  Draco hugger his mother, Harry shaking Lucius’s hand.
“Before dinner begins, I wanted to tell you that I am aware of what occurred in the common room.  Because of this, I want to make sure you understand: any wrong doings against a fellow student will result in a swift expulsion.  There will be a zero tolerance.  Do I make myself clear?”
Draco stared up at the white ceiling, trying to remember what had caused him to be in the state that he found himself.
“Nobody is asking you to make him a picnic and hold is hand around the park, mate.  Just not to say anything about what happened the last couple of years,” Harry sent a look at him.  “Think you can manage?”
“I told you.  Magic.”  He smiled up at Draco, who just shook his head at his boyfriend.  He joined Harry in looking down on the sleeping Teddy.
Draco just smiled and shook his head again.  “Anyway, yes, I did.  She didn’t give an answer, so I figure we can just getTeddy to convince her, tomorrow.”
Harry could only nod slightly as he took Draco’s hand back into his, pulling him out of the room, closing the door gently.  The yellow orb followed them up the stairs.
Draco did, and with a wave of Harry’s wand, the harness disappeared.  Harry took the baby from Draco’s arms.  “Are you ready for your nap?  Huh?”  At that moment, Teddy yawned.  “Thought so.  I’m going to go put him down.”
Kingsley sighed as Clarice gave him all the information she had.  Harry smiled as he waved to Kingsley, and quickly exited the office.  He had already heard rumours that people were hoping that he would one day be minister, but after spending just a little bit of time with Kingsley, he knew that that was not something he would be too keen to do.
A few minutes later, Narcissa and Lucius arrived, followed by Molly and Arthur, George and Angelina, Bill, and Victoire.  Pansy arrived a little bit later, Blaise and Greg in tow, and then Ginny, Seamus, Dean, Neville, and Hannah fell out of the floo one right after the other.
Harry took a deep breath and closed his eyes, before saying, “Because I realised something a couple of months ago.  When I started planning this party, I realised… I wanted to throw you this party, not because we’re friends, but because I… I…”  He lifted his head, opened his eyes, and got lost in the grey ones that were boring into his.
“There was one called a Fuzzy Naval, and another called a Hairy Naval.  Decided against those, for some reason.”
“Muggle law.  A person can sue another for money if they feel they have been wronged in one way or another.  Never mind.”
Narcissa loved the scarf that they had picked out for her on their trip, as well as the set of earrings that Harry had picked out.  Andromeda received a set of earrings, as well, along with a delicate shawl.
Draco hummed as Harry nipped his bottom lip. He thought he had completely ruined this. How could he have been so stupid? This was what he wanted—had wanted for years, if he was being honest with himself.
“Happy New Year, darling!” Pansy said, coming forward to kiss Harry’s cheek.  He didn't know if he'd ever get used to being this close with the woman, but he realized he didn't mind it.  “We figured we’d just apparate, as Theo’s floo isn't connected.  Is Greg here?  He’s not much a fan of apparition, so he floo’d from mine, while we went to Theo’s. ”
Draco and Harry smiled at each other as Narcissa got up and gave Molly a hug.  “Thank you.”  Molly just nodded her head and presented Andromeda her gift.
“You most certainly did.  I never in a million years expected this!  Best birthday present, ever.  This is even better than last year, when you got the Christmas lights out of the attic, wrapped them around your naked body, and sat in the middle of the sitting room, waiting for me to come home.  Oh, Godric, that night.  Remember that?  Merlin, that was hot, and I was convinced you would never be able to outdo yourself with the sexiness factor, but this?  This takes the cake.  Fuck, what did I do to deserve you?  Let’s see, what happens when I…”
“Fuck,” Harry whispered as he took in his fiancé.  He apparently spoke louder than he had thought, because Draco heard him and turned around with a large smile on his face.
They walked around to the back of the lodge to find a wizard brushing down a handsome caribou.  Harry walked over to him, letting him know that they had scheduled a ride.  He shook the man’s hand, and then gestured for Draco.
Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s torso, which gave Harry the space to reach around and sneak his hand between the man’s crack, rubbing his finger against the puckered hole.  This caused Draco to begin frotting in a frenzy.
“I’m sorry.  This is about you, and I’m making it all about me,” Draco said, pulling back and wiping his face.
Making sure Teddy was okay, Harry turned back.  Draco stood in the middle of the doorframe, hands in the pockets of his jeans, looking at Harry.  He stepped back, allowing Harry to follow him out onto the landing.
“So, what’s the special occasion?  We haven’t seen you since before your Birthday,” Andromeda asked whilst pouring the tea.
Draco sat next to Harry on the floor as everyone started piling food on their plates. He took another look around the table at these people, and smiled.
Draco gripped Harry’s bicep, and they walked toward the restaurant.  Harry opened the door for Draco as they stepped through, stomping the snow off of their shoes.
A murmur went through their classmates, as they all suddenly understood the way this game was going to go.
By the time the said their goodbye’s to Kinglsey, kissed Narcissa goodbye as she floo’d out of the Atrium, and they had made their way back up the visitor’s phone booth and apparated to Hogwarts, (all while still avoiding any lingering journalists and cameras, somehow) classes were letting out for the day.  They left McGonagall in the front hall, and made their way to their common room.
Harry released his arms from around Draco as he started shifting around.  He watched as Draco sat up against the headboard.  “Okay, I’m up,” he said, blinking at Harry.
Harry pulled open another box, and took out the paper and straw that were protecting the five glass bulbs that he had specially made a few years ago.  Draco sat his shoe-box sized box down on the coffee table, and stepped over to Harry, wrapping an arm around his middle.  Harry smiled at him as he picked up the first two.  He stared down at them, gently turning them in his hands.  One had the image of a stag, the other a doe.  They were simple ornaments to anyone that didn’t know what they represented, but if one did, they would see that they shone like Patronuses.
Returning for his eighth year, Draco did not expect to find himself curled up on the sofa in the eighth year common room in Harry bloody Potters arms.
It was dinner, and Draco was sitting at the end of the Slytherin table, closest to the door. He wasn't feeling very hungry and was playing with his food with his right hand. His left was holding his chin up as he looked around the hall.
He then opened the letter. Deciding to skim it instead of reading out loud, he got confused. He had to back track quite a bit before finally giving up and reading it aloud.
Harry just smiled sheepishly at him and the weirdest thing happened. Malfoy shook his head fondly and
When I managed to get up without dying, I saw a red package on my bedside table by my glasses. I grabbed my glasses and shoved them on my face, checking the time as I did so. 5:34 AM. Great, no one else is up yet. Maybe I can try move some of these petals so we can get out of the room...
He was very agitated throughout the rest of the day but it went smoother than the morning, thankfully. Now it was after curfew and he was patrolling the corridors looking for students who were out of bed.
"Alright boys, I am outing you to the school so be prepared for the jealous looks!" Snape said whilst looking Harry and Draco in their eyes, revelling in their horror stricken looks.
"You..." Harry whispered so quiet Draco almost didnt hear him. Draco grabbed his chin with soft fingers and pulled his face up to meet his own.
"I wish to discuss what I found in person, if that's okay. I have put too much in my letter and if someone were to intercept they would most likely go to Dumbledore. I have one more thing to tell you before I wrap up, though. Going back to my 'wellbeing' and my treatment worse than a house elf I wish to inform you of one more thing. If you couldn't tell by now, I am abused. They call me Freak and Boy. I don't know my real name till my Hogwarts letter. But it isn't just verbal. The physical abuse is serious. I will send a copy of my 'punishment chart' and the 'punishments' I have before I return. I don't think I will be able to get to Hogwarts in time and I suspect I will be unconscious for a day or two. Could you create a portkey for me? Please? It could just ditch me into the Infirmary at school so Poppy can treat me. If it is alright with you, of course, could you make it so that it activates itself after 2 days or something? It would be much appreciated if you can conform with my request.
So..... what do you think? I feel like my writing has progressed slightly over the course of this. The chapters are slowly getting longer lol. I have already gone through the earlier chapters and tried to make them longer but it didn't make much of a difference not gonna lie.
His eyes widened. Oh shit, no this means that he won't win the bet with Minerva! It was a girly moan, definitely, meaning Minerva will win. She says Draco will be shagging Granger in secret but Severus thinks it will be Potter. He sighed. Better get this over with.
The two boys in question flicked a glance at the other, not quite meeting the others eyes, blushing furiously as they nodded.
The werewolf turned back to his Master. "It was Harry but I didn't know that yet. He came up to me, recognising me from the wanted posters..."
As he walked past the memorial and chose a name, it had turned a corner and saw him. It had stuck by his side since. Whenever someone sneered at him, the dog would growl low in its throat, threatening them. Most people knew about Sirius Black and assumed this was him. They all knew he died though, maybe this was his ghost protecting fellow Azkabaners?
Fifth year, my Princess warned me, helped save me when I couldn't save myself and in return, I saved them from their nightmares.
Did this give anyone the wintery feel I was trying (and failing) to portray? My writing is shit sorry.
I have a plan. It involves expensive gifts, a lot of planning and cooperation from other people, notes and lots and lots of petals. But that might change.
Draco got no warning before he was picked up effortlessly by Harry and carried bridal style into Hogwarts. Harry navigated them through the empty castle to the eighth year common room brushing off anyone who tried to talk to him.
Harry and Draco just sighed and leant forward, kissing in front of the whole school, entwining on top of the table. When their lips touched, Hogwarts was almost screamed down by the students and teachers. The two lovebirds just grinned and laughed staring at each other. That was the photo that was on The Prophet the next day.
Severus Snape hated being a teacher. The only good things about it is that he can remove points for literally no reason and that there are always, and he means, always the good biscuits in the staff room at break time.
