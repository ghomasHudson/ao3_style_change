This time when a stricken Draco opens his mouth, it stays like that for a few moments, still no sound emitting.
—one of the copies that hadn’t been read to him earlier—and collapsing into an armchair, Harry has every intention of curling up and reading about The Weird Sisters’ new family of kneazles.
Instead, looking at the head of bushy hair across the table and with his life completely back to the way it had been for a year, Harry feels empty.
Harry smile is huge as he sits up and peers into Draco's face. Draco's so funny, acting like he doesn't know. "No, no, no. You
"You called your owl 'Esme,' Malfoy?" Harry asks, raising his eyebrows and feeling something akin to amusement for the first time in... too long. "You do know it's a boy, don't you?" Harry’s amusement grows when a light flush crawls up Malfoy’s neck, and he fails completely at covering it up.
Then he sprints. It’s exhilarating in a way, like when he and Hermione had first arrived in Godric’s Hollow during the war, and were completely unaware of what could happen. This time, Harry thinks there are slightly higher stakes.
Harry stands up as soon as he remembers to, still slightly surprised by the old lady's turn up and a little antsy about having to speak with another person.
"Stop that, it's weird!" Malfoy grimaces. Harry, finding that he rather likes the way emotions play out over Malfoy’s face, flashes him a huge grin and relishes in the surprised look.
Still, he feels not dissimilar to the way he did when he walked into the forest to die two years ago. Harry tries not to read too far into that; he knows that, if Draco thought the Gala wouldn't be safe, he wouldn't have made Harry go at all. And yet, Harry feels sick. He feels anxious and nervous and completely off-kilter; he hates the mix of emotions stirring in his stomach, and he hates that the first time he's leaving his safety zone is for a fucking Gala, and he hates that he can't even say no, he can't even turn back now. Because Harry can’t stand to see Draco, with his stupidly beautiful hair and face and personality, lose everything he’s worked so hard to build for himself since after the war.
They stumble and touch, and by the time they’ve reached the marble stairs, there’s so much skin on skin that Harry almost can’t breathe. His jacket and shirt have disappeared without him noticing, and Draco’s mouth on his feels like fire.
Harry mocks, pushing past him to get to the kitchen. "I'll give you the whole pot if you don't mention the word 'Gala' all day."
“Don’t give me that bullshit!” Harry rages, blood boiling as what Draco is saying sinks in. “Of course you had a choice. We always have choices.”
When he arrives at Grimmauld Place, Harry is too exhausted to bother with the Floo, and more than that, he's hoping a certain blond will put it to use again before the connection is closed. Moving slowly, he walks into his living room and sits on his favourite armchair. Replays the night's events. Thinks about what will happen tomorrow, when Draco doesn't have a reason to come back to Grimmauld Place, and Harry can finally get his old life back.
Harry rolls his eyes, kissing the closest part of Draco—his shoulder—in an attempt to shut him up. "I've had sex, Draco. But not with a man. And not with you. And not on a staircase."
"Well, in that case, I'm sure your neighbours will appreciate my singing instead.” Harry’s heart sinks. Malfoy is serious. “I thought I'd come a little earlier tomorrow morning... how does six o'clock grab you?"
"Not clever enough, then, apparently," Harry says, though he's slightly amused. "And anyway, I'm not really newsworthy unless I actually step outside and do something for them to report on."
"I'm not doing this for the good of my health, you know,” Malfoy scowls. “It's a necessity. In that it is necessary for you to attend this Gala, so that I might keep my position at the Trust, which is also... necessary." Evidently, even Malfoy can hear that fault in that argument; he frowns, looking slightly aggrieved.
Harry glares at him for a minute, then rolls his eyes and flashes a tiny smile. "You suspect correctly."
"Nothing much," Draco mutters, and then, after a pause, "You could probably slope off now if you wanted, by the way. The dancing's going to start soon, and I suspect you'd hate to not miss that."
"That's why you don't go outside," Malfoy murmurs, "This is your... what is it? A sanctuary? A hiding place? A waiting room?"
As if showing up here for the night hadn't been too much already. "Behave, Draco." He gestures to the land he's still looking at. "Look at that. I can't remember the last time I could see such a long way; it's incredible."
"That's not very nice," Draco says, as if they’re friends and this is amiable banter, rather than Harry very slowly climbing down from the Ladder of Homicide Contemplation. "And if you let me in, I'll tell you."
Then, just when Harry's decided on a way to politely interrupt Her Highness, say goodbye to Draco, and make a hasty exit without speaking to anyone else, he hears an aged voice behind him.
"I don't want him here. I never wanted him here in the first place, and now that fucking Gala is over I can have my life back the way it was. That's all I want."
Draco has a date? Apparently he does, and Harry knows that it isn't his place to care about that… but who had he asked, anyway? He's been at Grimmauld Place so much lately that Harry just assumed he didn't have time for anyone else. Maybe he's dating someone his parents picked out to help rebuild the Malfoy name's respect. It would make sense, Harry supposes, his mouth feeling increasingly dry.
"Probably," Draco mutters, fingers twisting nervously. No duck gloves today, Harry notices slightly hysterically.
"You may be right," Draco says after a long of a long silence. "Now, would you like to see Janice's visual aids or would you like to hear about Celestina Warbeck's tragic childhood?"
"He doesn't fucking live here, you know," Harry finally says, with more malice than intended. Hermione is only trying to help, he knows that.
In fact, non-snotty Malfoy is something Harry can add to the ‘pros’ side in the pros and cons list he has running in his head on whether or not he should have come back from King’s Cross.
"Oh, ha ha." Draco sneers, face twisting. "Doesn't the she-Weasel service your every need any more?"
"Oh." Harry withdraws his fingers from the Dark Mark and rolls onto his back, staring at his fake sky. He could go outside and look at the stars that way, he could lay in the street with Draco and they could see the real sky—
Shooting up rapidly and making his head throb, Harry looks around. Yes, he's in the Park, the last place he remembers being. And yes, there is Malfoy, the last person he remembers... being with. Harry cringes.
Malfoy just shrugs and says, "I think we've already established that I have no such thing, so what I thought I'd do is keep coming back here every day until you accept the invitation."
"Nothing bad happened, you lunatic," Draco mumbles, sloppily pouring a large amount into Harry's glass.
"No, Malfoy, are you deaf?" Harry rasps. He won’t have this conversation. Hermione is one thing, but Malfoy? There’s no way in hell. "Now, either drink that fucking coffee or give it back to me, because it's good stuff and you're not wasting it."
Harry had thought their time together meant more than what Draco pretended it did. Apparently, Harry had been the one pretending that it meant anything at all.
"—and I would like to know where my good owl is," Draco continues, as though without interruption, "Unless you've gone into professional owl-napping now that you're done with saving the world."
The sixth morning Malfoy shows up is a Saturday. Harry doesn’t hear the first several hundred knocks on his door, because he’s in his Park on the highest level of the house. At some point, though, he realizes that Malfoy should be here by now, and runs downstairs slightly panicked and hoping the singing hasn’t started up yet. He’s hears Malfoy, knocks growing more impatient by the second, and he thinks it’s a good job he’s made an extra cup of coffee, just in case.
After that, they don’t say anything for a while. Harry doesn’t trust himself to speak. Draco’s unexpected confession has taken all the anger out of him, and instead he feels guilty, thankful, and strangely comforted all at once. When they finally speak, it’s Draco who initiates it, and it’s to comment on an article from a magazine about Gladia the Gorgeous’ hideous new dress robes.
Sighing into the fabric, Harry closes his eyes and rests his head against the back of the chair, breathing in.
More obvious than anything, no straight man in his right mind would wear bright green duck gloves out in public.
Draco shakes his head slowly, and Harry’s heart sinks. If Draco doesn’t know how to handle this, either, there’s no way it will work out.
Getting anxious once again, and feeling a blush creep over his features, Harry quickly changes the subject. "Look, if you really must talk about your stupid Gala some more, go ahead, but I'm still not coming. If you want to waste your time, then I—”
Harry rolls his eyes at Draco's badmouthing of the cat, distracted by thoughts of more important things. Like how Draco will react to this. Not that Harry is entirely sure why that makes him so nervous, only that it does.
"I really am losing the fucking plot," Harry says to the empty room. Mrs. Norris slinks past him with a glare.
charm. Five-thirty in the morning. Harry gets out of bed and wipes at his eyes, although they're dry. He’s too tired to cry.
He says, raising his voice several pitches too high and putting on the most obnoxious tone he can manage so early in the morning.
Draco flushes, looking down at himself, as though he’s only just realised the state of the two of them. "I'm cold."
"Give me a minute, Potter. It's Gala time as soon as I've finished my coffee, and I know how much you enjoy that. Janice has made me some lovely visual aids today, too," Draco informs him, sipping at his drink. Slowly, he places the cup back on his palm.
Harry thinks of the first real conversation he ever had with him, back when those letters were the bane of his existence, and Draco was still Malfoy. “I was thinking I might show Draco. He said something to me once about going to the park. I didn’t tell him at the time that I already have one.”
If Harry’s hands weren’t already over his face, he’d have raised them to scrub at it. “I know that. I’ve seen it.”
“A lot more sex,” Harry says seriously, and Draco punches him in the arm. “Oi! Is this an abusive relationship?”
"You're fucked in the head," Harry corrects, heating oil in the frying pan and tossing in bacon. He sings, "Fucked, in the head," as he prods around bacon on the stove.
Hermione comes over the next day, and when they both hear the tell-tale knock on Harry’s door, she frowns and rises to see who it is before Harry has time to explain.
Kicking his chair back, Harry stands up, pacing the kitchen. So this was it, then, the moment he should have expected. The moment where Draco reminds Harry that, yes, he has been coming to his house every day for the
Not that he'll have to worry about going crazy anymore, after tonight. If Draco comes here after the Gala has ended, they'll have some coffee and talk and then Draco will leave and they'll both know it's for good. If he doesn't come back, the short conversation about the Malfoy Grounds will be the last one they ever had. Harry tries to make himself okay with that. He doesn’t even understand why it's such a big deal, Draco leaving. Yes, his company is enjoyed, and Harry has grown to have a soft spot for Draco, but...
"He never forgave himself, you know,” Harry says, changing the subject, his voice muffled as his head drops back into his arms. “I don't want to do that to anyone."
"I'm not very good at drinking," Harry admits. "Did you un-network me?" he adds, suddenly curious, and it's a mistake to look at Draco. His blond hair looks perfect under the Park's night sky above them, and Harry can't think of why it would be a bad idea for them to kiss. It seems like a great idea now, brilliant, even. But what if Draco doesn't like him? Harry wants Draco to like him.
"Do you know how annoying it is when you answer questions with questions?" Harry asks, scrubbing hands over his face. Of course he hasn’t seen himself; he doesn’t even want to.
Hermione looks up from the article, and Harry shifts around nervously. She’s giving him the look of someone who knows he’s not telling her something. Harry hopes she hasn’t become a Legillimens without informing him about it.
it, anyway,” Harry stumbles, slightly embarrassed at his own incoherency. “It was in my house, lying on my carpets and drinking my coffee and reading my—Ginny's magazines, and torturing my cat.” Harry takes a deep breath, tries not to mess this up like he has with everything else, watches a shell-shocked Draco, and needs him to understand: “And I... was a bit of an idiot."
"You can't guilt me into this, Draco. If you think I'm holding out on you just to punish you, then you're more self-centred than I thought. I can't do it, okay? I
Harry has always thought that it would be more fair for everyone if they didn’t have to share the weight of his truth. But here is Draco Malfoy, eager to know more, and Harry realises that maybe this would help take some weight off both of their shoulders.
"Is that a statement or a question?" Harry asks, for no good reason, and his resolve cracks. He steps close to Draco, though not nearly as close as he wants, and reaches for the robe on his belt. It’s a soft, expensive material, and Harry wants it on the floor.
“Hang on,” Harry says, slowly looking up. “That’s—I know that song you’re humming. I’ve heard it somewhere before.”
in a way that makes Harry tingle with discomfort, "While I'm glad you got that off your chest, I'm afraid I'm still going to need you at that Gala."
"Ron and Ginny are with their family—their brother died, remember? As for 'Mione... well, she does enough already. It's a lot of pressure to put on one person. You know all about that, don't you?" Harrys says, looking pointedly at Draco, whose grey eyes are unreadable. He adds something he’d discussed the other day with Hermione just to see how Malfoy would react. "That's why I don't use the Fidelius anymore. Hermione told me you asked about it."
"Your letters?" Harry says, finally turning around, head beginning to pound from lack of sleep and an abundance of Malfoy.
"Thanks, you too,” Harry mumbles, leaning closer. Then, because he needs to hear it: “No more waiting.”
He thinks about what he does need, and then he thinks of nothing, because he isn't sure what he needs, but he knows that what he
Harry rubs at his face. "It's just difficult to be nice, on a day like today. You wouldn't understand. You're a cupboard."
"About what I said..." Harry begins, suddenly at a loss for words in a conversation he's played over in his head countless times, "I didn't... it's just..."
Gripping his stomach—because the anxiety Harry’s feeling is very similar to like, and the butterflies fluttering around his stomach are creaky from disuse—Harry walks upstairs to sit below his sparkling park sky. Sitting on the carpet and watching the stars thoughtlessly seems a much better idea than thinking about any new developments in his acquaintanceship/ friendship/ whatever the fuck it is with Malfoy.
"In a minute, Malfoy," Harry murmurs, closing his eyes and resting his head against the cabinet behind him. On the one hand, he’s already told Malfoy about dying. He has made the leap and shared that fact, and now he might as well go into it further. It might even be gratifying; Hermione is always telling Harry there’s scientific proof that talking about things makes people feel better.
Malfoy says, getting agitated as if he has the right to. "You're such a drama queen. I know you don't like it... and I'm sorry. I don't like it either. But I... I suppose I thought we could work something out. I thought we were friends, and..."
"Who the hell wants you dead, Potter?" Malfoy snaps, and those few moments of him being ‘Draco’ fall away.
I'm not suicidal, all right? You can stop looking like you want to make a run for it, although you know I wouldn't stop you."
He thinks of Ron, his first real friend, the champion chess player that had saved him time and time again, always coming back, and always fighting Harry’s cause. He thinks of what Ron might be doing now. At the Weasleys’ with Hermione, Harry would guess, but he doesn't know; of course he doesn’t, because Ron never writes much in his letters.
"Fuck," Draco hisses, and when he pushes forwards, Harry almost comes apart. Gentle, needy fingers touch Harry through his clothes, and he can’t help the desperate noise that escapes him.
Craning his neck, Harry looks behind Her Highness to see a rather old woman with grey hair and red dress robes. His heart gives a leap, and a laugh of relief escapes him. "That'll be the infamous Janice?"
"Forgive me for being surprised that you'd re-plot an Unplottable location," Malfoy sighs, reaching for his coffee. "Especially now I know how paranoid you are. Anyway, what's pressure got to do with anything? I thought you loved all that.”
"S'not really about dying or not dying," Harry mumbles, shifting onto his side and touching Draco's forearm, the one with the stupid ugly Voldemort tattoo. It doesn't look so bad when it can't summon evil, but maybe that’s because Harry’s also drunk off his arse. "Did that hurt?"
"Can you not yell, 'Mione? I've got a splitting headache," Harry tells her, and the look on her face lets him know that she feels no pity.
Hermione returns with more packages later than she should have, and when he looks at her, she just shakes her head.
"Ron seems to be quite pleased, now that he's positive Ginny will end up with someone he can trust, after all." Hermione gives Harry a knowing look, "Even if it's not the person he always thought she would be with."
Harry cracks a smile for the first time all day, and it doesn't even feel fake. "I like the duck gloves," he says, and the smile grows a little at Malfoy's startled expression. "The
"I can't believe I'm even having this discussion with you, Malfoy. In my own kitchen, no less.” He rubs his face and hunches his shoulders to a near-impossible degree. "The thing is, I'm fully aware that we've both done our share of shitty things to each other over the years. I'm not keeping score, and I'm not saying that with everything I know, I'd have swapped my life for yours at any point."
A low yowel comes from a hallway near the kitchen, and Harry clenches his fist. Fucking Mrs. Norris. He doesn't need this right now.
"I guess it's a Black thing," Harry says, "Sirius left this house to me, so I'm its master, so to speak. You've got Black blood, so it must recognise that, too. Weird."
The wards come down, and Harry charges through the gates, hastily putting them back up after he gets onto the grounds.
“The Gala is one of the most important annual events of the War Orphans Trust...” Malfoy begins, and Harry stops listening.
Draco laughs, squeezing the life out of Harry's hand on the carpet. Harry finds he doesn't mind a bit.
"Oi, fuckface!" Harry finally shouts, desperate to get Draco's attention, to make sure he's not having a stroke. Harry had been feeding him a lot of bacon lately; those things were known to happen.
"Draco... fuck," Harry pants, because after all this time, he’s found his something—and now, more than anything, he needs to fucking
. "Come on," he urges, prodding Harry with his foot, "let's go down to the kitchen; you can make some decent coffee and I'll see if I can persuade Klinky that the danger has passed and he can come out of the pantry."
The blond however didn't seem to react to Harry's words, only held on to the locket with dear life — the veins on his hand showing. 'You have to leave,' Draco then said, his voice a hoarse whisper and his face remaining cold.
"You have for the past years though," Draco reasoned. A reasoning that sounded incredibly silly to Harry at that moment.
A silence fell as Harry stared at his feet, not knowing what to reply. He seemed to struggle, and wiped away a few upcoming tears with the back of his hand. Draco wanted to hold him, tell him it was all alright, but at the same time he wanted to have answers. Wanted to know why Harry was so afraid to face what he had done. 'Because
'It's only a theory; I'll explain it to you once I've figured it out.' The boy then sneaked a hand around Draco's waist and pulled him a bit closer, his head resting on Draco's shoulder before closing his eyes.
'More importantly is what she's up to — doesn't really look like she's shopping for Christmas sales,' Harry noted before leaving the alley again, pulling Draco along. 'Maybe we should hide.'
by the Snatchers, most likely. A Snatcher of his own pushed him down further into the grass as well, and a few branches of the wood's grounds stabbed him in the cheek.
They told him to rest and basically pushed him into his room, ignoring Raphael's questions, and promised to inform Madame Maxime as soon as she would return from her meeting with the other Headmasters. Draco had just nodded at their words, suddenly too tired to talk. Fleur had given him glances of pity, alternately with vile glares that were mentally meant for Harry, Draco knew. And as he stumbled upon his bed, seated on its edge like a sack of salt, he didn't dare to glance up; knowing that there was a mirror on the other side. But of course he did so in the end, sneaked a peek at a boy he had never seen before. Someone had stolen his face, so it seemed. His pointy features were the same, his eyes just a little tired but the fact that his hair was so short changed his entire face. It spiked in various directions and some strands hung down as straight as straight could be. Weird, it was, and terrifying. He looked much older, much more
Ron shrugs but continues with great eager. 'Davis was that Unspeakable and he immediately saw that the Death Eater was cursed. But it's not a curse that was cast within the walls of Azkaban, no, the curse is spread by the
… As if he suddenly ceased to exist. Nothing made sense no more, and he felt completely fine with it. Like drifting on a cloud — slowly away from reality and everything that defined the world he lived in.
During lunchtime he couldn't help but let his mind wander off again. Only this time, his eyes chose to wander off as well. They found Harry quite quickly; talking eagerly to his friends and making large gestures with his arms and hands. He smiled brightly while explaining something and Draco felt himself melt away at the sight of a passionate boy.
be alright,’ Draco answers. 'You can't just choose whenever you want to invade my house and ask annoying and irrelevant questions!”
For a second Draco was worried Harry would become upset or even hurt by his best friend's words, but he wasn't. His expression stayed the same; blank but with furious eyes. ‘And what’s wrong with that? If I want to go with Draco then that’s my decision, isn’t it? Dean and Seamus also went together.’ The mentioned pair of boys were dancing only a few feet away from them. Their foreheads rested against each other as they held the other in a tight embrace. If that wasn't love, Draco wasn't sure what the limits to a bromance were.
A bit in shock and lost for words, Harry’s eyes remain stuck staring at Malfoy’s arm. Last week he’d only seen around one forth of the curse’s damage, and the fact that it has overtaken such a large part of Malfoy’s body already, suddenly frightens him. Everything suddenly appears even more urgent than he’d thought it was.
'. Reading and controlling minds, movings things by pure will, healing, flying… And then each angel has a special power that others do not possess. Some have the same, but there are a few rare ones out there as well. I, for example, have a
'How many staircases can there be in this bloody castle?' Ron huffed, rolling his eyes and following Draco and the others into the room.
would want to be him!' Draco's voice was starting to tremble and he could feel the salt of his unshed tears sting behind his eyes.
, Potter,' he interrupts him, hand raised to stop his words. 'It had already been clear to me that the Ministry doesn't give a single fuck about what happens to me. It's just… Eye-opening to hear it like that, I suppose.'
Keeping his eyes fixed on them, he couldn't help but feel confused at the recognition of the boy. He had heard so many tales, so many rumors. Were they true? Maybe the boy just had a similar scar… And his
'Yeah. Heard him talk about this Ravenclaw girl earlier this week. Cho Chang, or what's her name? Think he's gone out to find her and ask her to the bloody Ball.'
'So? Doesn't mean he can't be friends with Harry or help him?' Hermione replied. It was as if she was talking to her book, her face not even glancing at Ron as she said those words.
Everyone agreed to Draco's words and followed him up the stairs again — Ron once again complaining about the unwanted physical activity he was being put through. As they stepped through the portrait hole, Harry's friends followed the golden footsteps in front of them that would lead them to their rooms — Draco and Harry staying behind for a bit longer. 'You're unbelievable, Draco,' the raven-haired boy suddenly told him.
I hope you haven't gotten tired of my beautiful Beauxbatons!Draco yet & thank you once again for all the loving comments! :) And we did it! We're officially over 100K words.
again, trying to find that one curse or cure that would solve this whole mess at once. Of course he couldn't help but feel Malfoy's eyes pointed at him the entire time; never leaving every inch of Harry's presence alone. What was it that intrigued the blond so much? Harry didn't have the guts to ask.
“I told him you don’t matter,” Harry whispered, voice carrying through the tense air.  “And you don’t.  Not anymore.  Nothing you say or do is ever going to matter to us again.”
They stood there, Harry trembling and breathing fast as Lest visibly struggled to control himself, his eyes swirling with a mixture of emotions.
The lamplight illuminated the parts of her quarters the dim moonlight couldn’t as Myn sat at her desk, correcting the latest practice O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s.  As the only professor unable to perform magic, it made her job more difficult to make sure the students were qualified enough to sit and pass the exams.
“We’re sorry,” Hermione said nervously, a small blush on her cheeks. “We were just going to find Harry - ” She cut off when the redhead gave her a non-too-subtle shove. The brunette looked at him in confusion and he shot her a warning look.
“Yeah,” Ron exhaled.  He looked back up and fought back his instinctual annoyance as he studied the blond.  “I saw you too.”
“- is a good war,” Jacob interrupted, rolling his green eyes at the older man.  “Yeah, yeah, we know the cliché, Pops.  But that’s just so damn depressing.  I mean, we’re alive, ain’t we? We managed to get through this hell without kicking the bucket, haven’t we?  I think we’ve deserved a little bit of a party.”
“We’re going to find him,” Ron whispered furiously back as the professors slowly guided the mass of students out of the Great Hall and began to separate them by House.  He watched as the vines finally engulfed the beast and pinned it the wall, where its smothered snarls had students flinching as they tried to stay away.
“Thank you, Mother,” Harry muttered as he picked up his fork and began to push around his food. She didn’t smile as she poured them pumpkin juice. He glared at the calmly eating Ron. “Thanks for the support.” Ron shrugged.
Hermione lowered her hand, shooting Harry an apologetic look - to which he gave a half-disgruntled, half-questioning look of his own - and looked at the teacher. "Professor, doesn't that make the duel uneven?" At Professor Opacre's inquisitive look, she continued. "He knows what we're capable of but taking away what you've taught us - which is hardly great in information of how vampires duel - we hardly know what to expect."
He didn’t notice the narrowing eyes in front of him or a foot nudging a broken piece of glass further under the bed.
Professor Opacre stopped Hermione and Ron on their way to Herbology, looking oddly strained and troubled.  Hermione barely managed to say that Harry was just catching up on some sorely needed sleep before Ron tugged her away, lips thin and body tense.
Taking another look to make sure no one was around, Qye surreptitiously made his way to one of the tall trees that lined the lake. Unlike some of the skeletal ones, this one was still thick with flourishing leaves and Qye couldn’t resist, jumping and grabbing a low branch, swinging himself up into the tree, quickly hoisting himself up until he found a perfect branch to sit on. Qye fidgeted until he found himself comfortable, one leg swinging, the other propped up, his back against the trunk. The boy smiled in satisfaction at the view.
He quickly got changed and glanced at the clock again.  Seeing that it was now the time he usually woke his best friend up, he walked over to the snoring redhead’s bed.  On his way to Ron’s bed, he passed the window and saw his reflection.
As she watched the train roll into the Hogsmeade Station, Marylin shivered and wrapped her cloak closer around herself.  She watched a few passengers get off, looking for a familiar scent.  She caught it near the end of the train and sighing, she walked towards it.  As soon as she reached the end, a tall figure stepped off, a duffel bag slung over their shoulder.  She stopped, the scent making itself clear.
with a blast of telekinesis and she joined him as he dashed forward towards Harry, instantly blocked by Dazain who appeared in front of him, a faint look of interest on his typically neutral face.
Ron’s hand eased on her shoulder and she dropped her eyes, blinking rapidly. Harry raised his eyes to the other boy’s solemn blue ones, once again taken aback by the exhaustion and relief he found in them.
Draco eyed him before sniffing.  “Yes, well, like I said, that didn’t go well at all.  I remember people having to separate us even then.”  He scowled briefly before shaking his head and continuing on.  “Still, my father wanted to exhaust all options.  My mother didn’t approve of it but my father kept saying it would help.  When I was ten, I went to the ceremony where Opacre was to pick the person he wanted.  Fortunately it wasn’t me.  But my father didn’t want to give up, not yet.  I found out about the vampire war early on because…”  His jaw clenched.  “Well, the Opacres didn’t want me.  But there were the others.”
“He barely survived, Sirius,” Remus sighed, dropping his hand from his shoulder and squeezing his hands again.  “If Opacre hadn’t included in the agreements to provide support from his own people, you know he’d be dead and he wouldn’t have had a chance to resign and name Kingsley as his replacement while awaiting new elections.  And tomorrow most likely would not have been possible.”
His cousin stood at the head of the table and sat down as silently as he came in and Jordan gave a start when he noticed the other person who had walked in behind his cousin.  He hadn’t thought his other cousin would make an appearance, as she usually wasn’t in the meetings.  His forehead furrowed as he wondered why she was here now.
“Draco and I kissed,” Harry blurted out.  Her eyes went wide and he dropped his gaze to the table, studying the Transfiguration book in front of her.  It looked to be a chapter on changing liquids, which he doubted would be on the O.W.L.s but he wouldn’t put it past Hermione to cover all her bases.  “We kissed and I would really rather not talk about it.”
As she began to give out the details of how the negotiations were going and information Dumbledore was giving, she absently wondered if she should tell Lest about this new development.  If Harry was Qye, him being a wizard would assist in vampire-wizard relations.  ‘
“Normal is being told you can’t do something because you’re too young and you’re just being difficult,” Qye said quietly.  “Normal is failing someone for not showing their work like everyone else because they figured out a different way.   Or telling a boy his clothes look dumb because his family only gives him hand me downs, looking the other way and minding your own business at the worst possible times.  It's everyone making up their minds about something they know nothing about.  Normal is bullshit.”
“So is this it?” Hermione asked as they slowly made their way back to the Three Broomsticks.  “The reason you’ve kept to yourself all year?”
A moment passed, then another, and as Hermione slowly lowered her wand, a frown on her face, Lest - miraculously - raised an eyebrow.
:: he asked, ignoring the question.  Maybe if ‘Qye’ told him something he didn’t know it would disprove what he feared.  Maybe.
Lightning flashed and the room was illuminated.  The blinding light made his cousin’s blond hair shine brightly and his reflection shimmered for a moment on the window.
Neville staggered as he was released from the telekinetic hold and Dean snapped out of it, rushing forward to grab his friend and pull him back.
The room was dark and the hour was a little past one.  She had stayed at the Three Broomsticks long enough to make sure every student made it back to Hogwarts and helped Madam Rosmerta clean up.  The owner had been more than happy with the business the dance had brought and had assured Marylin of her support on the Hogsmeade council.  By the time every chair was put up and every glass put away, Marylin was longingly thinking of her warm bed.  Of course that was the time she noticed Lest hadn’t been waiting around for her.
“There’s something you should probably know about Opacre’s brother, considering how cozy you two looked when I interrupted,” Draco drawled, slinging the bag over his shoulder, his pale eyes looking calmly at Harry.
“A wise move, Libby,” Dumbledore said serenely before anyone could begin to protest, rising from his own seat.  “I assume the original copy is secured?”
“If you the two of you would like to continue your pissing contest about who cares more because they’re feeling guilty, you can take it outside!” she cried at them, curling her hands into fists.  “The rest of us are actually going to listen to the people who have been taking care of Qye and Harry all week and speak tomorrow, rationally and calmly.  If you two can take your heads out of your asses long enough, you can join us, otherwise spare us all the headache and be silent!”
Malfoy growled in the back of his throat, his silver eyes flashing up at the vampire in annoyance.  As he opened his mouth, obviously to say something rude, Harry discretely kicked him in the shins under the table.  The Slytherin’s mouth closed with a snap and he turned indignant eyes onto the green-eyed boy, which Harry returned with a warning look.  The pale boy growled again but thankfully kept his mouth shut.  Harry sighed in relief, turning his eyes back to the amused Professor.
"Why don't you, Parkinson?" Ron snarled back in a low voice and Harry blinked when his friend grabbed his sleeve. "He's not going to do it."
“We will deal with it then,” Dumbledore said firmly as he guided the Minister out of the room.  “Until then, let’s leave our Healers to their work.”
Marylin took a step towards the Potions Master, dropping her arms, anger shifting to anxiety as she too gave Remus and Sirius a brief glance.  “Severus, please, wait - ”
Harry blushed and nodded. “I’ll try,” he said awkwardly, embarrassed by the display of affection from his teacher. Professor Opacre’s eyes twinkled and she turned to leave, Lest moving off from the wall to join her.
Hermione’s eyes widened briefly and she exchanged a cautious look with Ron over Harry’s head before carefully putting her hand on their friend’s shoulder.  “Harry?”
"Don't be ridiculous, Ron," Hermione sniffed, taking a sip of her pumpkin juice.  "Just because it's almost the holidays doesn't mean they have to loosen up on the work they're giving us.  And besides, O.W.L.s are coming closer and closer.  They don't want us slacking off during the break, that's all.  All the assignments they're giving us will help all of us stop from being lazy and procrastinating on studying for the exams.  I, for one, am personally flattered they're taking so much effort into helping us for the tests."
His summer, to say the least, very much sucked.  The only rays of light in his summer were the letters of his friends and of Sirius Black, his godfather.  Although Sirius couldn’t say where he was or visit him, they cheered him up when he read them, full of helpful advice and good humor.  His last one was the day before he reunited with his friends on Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters so he was in one of his better moods when he saw his best friends again.  Albeit, he was still depressed but lighter than usual.
“Snape and Dumbledore are missing too,” he muttered, turning to his friends again.  Hermione looked over at the Head Table but Ron looked even more ecstatic.
“You’ve been at Hogwarts for months now,” she said.  He’d been noticeably quieter and more withdrawn if possible ever since that night at the dance.  After his cryptic comments that night, no matter how much she hinted and probed and asked, he wouldn’t say anything more and spent most of his days in her office drafting statements but never sending them.  The correspondence he had in hand were only the latest in news from the council and he only had them because they had been addressed to her to pass along.
She spritzed one more time before lowering the bottle and finally meeting his gaze.  He felt a twinge as he saw the trace of melancholy in her blue eyes.
Remus folded himself down into a crouch next to his friend, firmly taking him by the shoulders and waiting until Sirius looked him in the eye.
She suddenly heard a sudden growl and turned to the forgotten boy who was looking around the area, frustration evident on his face.
“Not what we deal with every day,” Harry exhaled in exasperation as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes.  Merlin, he was over being so tired all the time.
Harry wordlessly shook his head, dropping Draco’s hand and moving away from the Slytherin.  He dropped down into the chair, avoiding the eyes of everyone, feeling the feeling of being isolated once again.
Harry frowned, looking up at the Headmaster while rubbing his blurry eyes.  What was he talking about?  He didn’t blame himself…did he?  He opened his mouth and then closed it again.  His throat was tight.  Maybe he was coming down with a cold, he thought faintly, sniffling slightly.  Hermione would be a hen if he were.
“Should we get McGonagall anyway?” whispered Neville nervously, glancing back and forth between Harry and his remains of his random frenzy.
Jonas fought the urge to sigh and patiently turned to face the men, lowering his wand so that he would not get distracted.  It was a delicate enough of a case, he did not need to chance anything.
This conversation was not right. Without reason, his panic started to lift slightly. Why were they talking about this? As if he didn’t have enough to worry about with Qye being silent and his hazy memory and now this. They had seemed fine with him before and now…
“That’s what you said about this one,” Harry said weakly as she tugged at the brown jacket she had pushed him into.  He batted her hands away and took a step back, yelping, as she reached for the gray slacks.  “No, no, we agreed I would do this!”  He vaguely thought he should be protesting more, surely there were provisions in the school rule for teachers treating their students like dress up dolls or something similar.
She stiffened and he knew her senses felt it too as he shot up from his chair, tumbling it over as he pulled his Gemmus from his neck swiftly.
As he left the DADA classroom, a sinking feeling in his stomach, all Harry could think amidst Qye’s continued amusement was,
Granger gave him a relieved smile and Weasley gave him a sympathetic look. He ignored both, seeing Myn smile at him, to which he smiled back at.
“I wasn’t asking about your future plans,” said Wainscott as he pulled one of the books out and flipped it over to read the back.  “But you do bring up an interesting point.  How old are you?”
She watched as those three begin to exit this class and suddenly, without thinking, she called out, “Harry?”
There were groans from the Gryffindor side of the room and Harry mentally sighed, the leaden feeling in his stomach growing even more.  ‘
Malfoy.  But the pale boy had become more civil.  Their spats seemed to have come to a permanent end and the only insults the Slytherin threw his way had been mild.  The other boy had avoided insulting him about anything connected with Voldemort or his relatives.  It was rather unnerving to say the least.
“Mr. Potter?” the Headmaster asked, his amused voice breaking the boy’s irritated train of thoughts.
The atmosphere in the classroom became even worse when the Slytherins came in. Harry could practically feel when Draco stepped in because the uncomfortable and confused silence of the classroom turned frigid and tense in such a way that Ron moved his chair closer to Harry and Hermione.
After she had made sure Harry was okay - a few bruises but nothing more than the others received - and hustled him back to the group, she was torn between letting another student try and ending class early. The others had been thrown into stunned disbelief as much as she had been when her mild student
He blinked, confused.  “Why?” he asked bewilderedly.  He blinked again when Malfoy reached over and grasped one of his hands.  He glanced down at their hands before looking back up again, worried by the seriousness in the other’s gray eyes.
“I just want to live my life,” Qye said, nails digging into the palms of his hands.  “Like anyone else.  Go through the motions of a day, choose what I want to do, talk to the people I want to and experience what everyone else gets to.  Why is that so much to ask?”
“Hair and bracelet,” he slowly agreed.  He narrowed his eyes.  “But I reserve the right to wear robes if the bracelet is too gaudy.”  He figured she would eventually find out that there wasn’t much she could do with his always messy hair and would give up quickly.  She certainly couldn’t make the mess even worse.
“Professor Lupin,” said the young Malfoy warily, glancing briefly at the dog and keeping a respectful distance.
He held out a hand and she dropped the letter in his hand, a touch of haughtiness coming back to cover up her uncertainty.  “Professor Snape said to open it as soon as you got it.  He said he’ll be in the teacher’s lounge if you need him.”
Growling in frustration, he fell back on the bed, glaring up at the ceiling. Somehow, he had switched places with Harry. Now, instead of him being the little voice inside someone’s head, it was Harry who was nestled in…well, his own mind while Qye had control over his body. The boy growled again, tugging his hair. So confusing…
Harry shook his head, rubbing his temples.  He really had to get this boy out of his head.  He’d probably go mad if he had to listen to him anymore.  As he walked back to Gryffindor Tower, Harry silently made a promise to get back at whoever or whatever caused this.
:: There was silence for a moment and Harry’s irritation faded. Sighing, he idly picked at the leftover frog nails and toes. ::
“Sunlight shield, asshole,” Draco said hoarsely, as he unevenly climbed to his feet.  He raised his wand again, meeting Lest’s glare with his own sneer.  “Let’s see how - ”
“Okay,” Draco said slowly, taking his own step back.  Harry glanced up and sighed as he saw his eyes start to close off into a cool expression.  “We should get back, I suppose.”  He looked towards that path that led back to the village, a deep frown on his face.
Qye dropped his eyes and turned away. “I’ll go back,” he said quietly, his eyes gazing at the lake. “But after dinner, alright? Kind of want to enjoy my freedom while I can.” He glanced back, a lopsided grin on his face.
Qye continued, voice shaking, while Harry stared at the others with steady eyes in a pallid face, “I don't want to be the bloody Boy Who Lived, the Gryffindor's star Seeker, I don't even want to be a wizard."  He jerked slightly, hands clenching.  "The magic, I....it's fascinating but I don't even care for that, not if it means coming with all it does, it's not enough.  I didn't have it before and as far as I'm concerned, it's never been a part of me.”
“You try seeing one of us face pain and potential death several times in less than a week and not get upset over it,” Ron muttered uncomfortably, shifting his gaze to the floor.
Qye said nothing else and never said anything when Draco and Harry worked in silence during their classwork, sharing their information and nothing else.  The group work finally started to finish off as the teachers worked on preparing them for the individual exams coming up.
Harry jolted, having forgotten about the other boy for a brief moment, and looked away with a blush on his cheeks.
“Hello, Severus,” he said wearily as he turned around to see the Potions Master striding towards them.  The man’s lips tightened but he surprisingly didn’t say anything else, merely glancing towards Draco.
:: Qye said irritably even though Harry could feel his confusion and slight fear.  He gave a small start as he realized the other boy had read his thoughts and he sighed inwardly.  He guessed there would be nothing he would be able to hide from him.
“My sister wanted to visit and I was bored. Is there a problem?” Lest asked nonchalantly. But his eyes dared Ron to say something. For once, the temperamental boy bit his lip and shook his head. Lest’s lips curled slightly.
He blocked another clawing attack with one arm, knocked the thing down with a sweep of a leg and blasted its mind to death before it fell to the floor.
“Oh no, please don’t,” she said and his eyebrows shot up as he heard a touch of a whine in her voice.  “It would be such a shame not to show off such a doll.”  She held up her hands and stood up from the desk.  “I promise it’ll be wonderful, you just sit tight and I’ll be done in just a moment.
"Resonation is how well vampires deal with their jewel." She gave them an apologetic look. "I'm sorry I can't explain better but it's something you really have to be born with to understand, to know the feel of your jewel. The better a vampire resonates with his or her jewel, the stronger they'll be. If they don't resonate well at all - perhaps due to the parents making a bad choice in stone at birth - then they are unlikely to perform well with their jewel. The same goes if they have high fluctuations in their resonation. Such wildly differing resonations from low to high and so forth will typically lead to an unstable relationship between a jewel and their vampire.
Snape gave her a cool look, his lip curled up slightly.  “I indulge nothing, Opacre.  What you see are merely the results of your own actions.”  There was a pause and Remus saw Snape’s eyes flicker towards him, flicker to Sirius still impatiently scratching at the floor.  “Or perhaps we should say your brother’s actions.”
He glanced away from the book and raised his eyebrows.  “Are you stupid or forgetful?” he questioned as he put back the book, uninterested in its contents of goblin wars at the moment.  He remembered Professor Binns droning on about them enough while Harry passed the time playing games with Weasley.  “Isn’t our birthday in that file you received?”
Professor Opacre must have noticed it and sighed, nodding. "Yes, well, I suppose you'll just have to take that on faith. Either way, you should expect something along those lines if you fight a vampire. They'll take any advantage they can get, especially forewarning of attacks. That's why it's best to not think or plan far ahead when dueling." She spread her hands apologetically. "I know it'll be hard so you should probably start training to not think as you send out your spells. Another reason my brother reacted so quickly to Hermione throwing that inkpot is that she must have thought about it before she did it, so he knew what she was going to do. Added to his Videte so that he knew where the inkpot was coming from, he didn't have to move much to avoid the attack.
Maybe Hermione had the right idea.  Ron really didn’t want to force Harry to tell them anything he didn’t want to but he didn’t think Harry should keep everything to himself.  It would get the smaller boy into trouble.  But Harry seemed to think like it was best, ignoring their attempts at trying to help.  Ron’s hand curled into a small fist and he inaudibly thumped it against the bedpost.  They were his best friends, damn it!  They just wanted to help.
“Which you shouldn’t have done,” Hermione frowned disapprovingly. “All that did was cost Gryffindor points and - ”
“No, but I remember seeing something in one of my review guides for past N.E.W.T.s,” Hermione said thoughtfully.
She heard Voldemort curse, watched him move behind his Death Eaters as the teachers unleashed a work of spells, fire and lights clashing with the dark wizards’ magic.  The Dazain vampires had straightened in attention and whirled around in time as Saira threw her knives before colliding with them, arms and legs swift, calculated to break and twist and kill while Leon unsheathed his sword and blocked the weapons concealed by the Dazain vampires.
He took a step back.  “You know, it’s actually getting really late, I should get going if I want to meet - ”
Snarling silently to himself, he shoved the damn part of himself away, holding himself back again.  He breathed in deep, trying to cool his natural heat…
The female vampire stopped and stared at him. The Slytherins around him shuffled nervously and some even edged away as they caught sight of the withering look in her eyes.
The hand and stalk were poised above the potion when the emerald eyes suddenly snapped to attention, a horrified and dismal look appearing in them quickly as the stalk began to fall.
Irritation took over once more, a headache building behind his eyes as Lest turned from the bookshelf, sitting in his chair, eyes blank, face still.
“I’m down to my last two vials,” Malfoy panted as he stepped in front of Ron, his wand held steady.  “I can’t believe I’m saying this but any bright ideas, Weasley?”
The Head of the Opacres and European vampires said nothing.  He merely raised his right hand to touch something around his neck.
“Yeah…” he said slowly, remembering Harvey.  “Is that what you call them?” Jordan asked in surprise.  Leon nodded and Jordan furrowed his eyebrow.  Leaning closer, he whispered, “Why is cousin Marylin upset?”
:: he said to the other boy, sighing as he rubbed his hands together for warmth.  He hoped Ron and Hermione came quickly; the Entrance Hall was becoming colder and colder by the minute.
“You know,” Ron interrupted suddenly, causing the two women to look at him but unable to draw the attention of the silent male. “Maybe he’s right. About Harry leaving before we got here. We should go, really. I mean, he’s sick and all and Pomfrey’s ready to blow a gasket and Mum will have my head if I didn’t make him take care of himself and we really should be going and – ”
Cornelius anxiously chewed on his lip as he jammed his bowler hat on his head, absently nodding to his escort as they left his offices and headed for the Floo chambers.  The pair of Aurors were silent as they vigilantly scanned the surroundings as they had every day since the attack on Hogwarts.  Dumbledore’s letter burned a hole in his robes as they followed the twists and turns of the Ministry in the late hours, taking the elevator while Cornelius miserably wondered what update was so urgent that Dumbledore wanted him immediately at the school.
“Oh no, it’s completely unnatural,” she assured him, patting him on the back.  “I’ll still be running those countercurses when we get back and grilling him every chance I get, don’t worry.  But,” she said brightly, straightening up, “might as well enjoy this peaceful night, right?  Who knows when we’ll get it again.”
“Do you suppose they’ll take this into consideration when grading O.W.L.s?” Justin Finch-Fletchley panted as he blasted the vampire in the back with a Blasting Charm and knocked it unconscious.  “I mean, this has to count for something, right?”
He heard the girl mutter something in a different language in front of him and gaped as the vampires warily took a step back, faces twisting in anger.
:: he asked confusedly as he carefully placed the chocolates and cards into his bag lying by the bed.
Harry didn’t say anything in reply and Qye blew out a breath, dropping his arms.  He eyed the wall between the beds and scowled as another piece of advice from the Healer crossed his mind.
Harry thought absently, glasses back on the bedside drawer and head resting on the pillow. He was curled up on his side, back facing the entrance to his room. ‘
"Of course," he said, unpleasantly smiling, "perhaps some of your memories are suitably embarrassing.  I wouldn't want to traumatize any of you.  Only one of you will take the potion at the end of the class.  The potion will take the entire period.  Well?  What are you waiting for?  Begin!"
“You haven’t talked about it since,” Hermione continued quietly.  “So I assume you’ve figured out what you needed to without it.”
Harry was midway through his potion when the knock came.  Blinking, he looked up with the rest of the students as Snape stalked over angrily to the closed door, an irritated expression on his face.
It was pleasant and quiet.  It made it all more jarring when Harry finally couldn’t hold it in any longer and abruptly asked, “What is this exactly?”
“I thought the Dazains were always proud of being a vampire,” Jordan said, blinking.  “Why would they join with wizards?”
"You did very well, Hermione," Professor Opacre smiled kindly at Hermione, who blinked. The vampire gently edged her and Hermione walked back to them, only pausing momentarily to look back uncertainly at Lest. Lest, however, seemed to have forgotten about her as her resumed his crossed-armed pose with a bored expression.
When he couldn’t push aside his need to breathe anymore he reluctantly pulled back, body shuddering as he blinked open his eyes and inhaled sharply at the sight of the reddened cheeks and lips.  Draco’s eyes were heavy lidded and burning as they looked at each other.
“Sorry, Pater,” she said sullenly but obviously put back in her place.  Jordan shook his head, mentally sighing.
“Are you picking something up?” Smethwyck asked carefully, meeting his eyes with a hint of curiosity.  Qye’s mouth twisted slightly.
His cousin’s ice-blue eyes looked over all of them emotionlessly and then he nodded.  “Let’s make this brief, shall we?” he said coldly.  “I know some of us want to do better things with this time than stay here.  Like celebrate.”
“Yesterday, your temperature was abnormally high when I last checked it, Mr. Potter,” she said slowly, looking at Qye thoughtfully. “I was sure you would be in here at least a week. But if my spell is correct, then your health is…well, your health is perfect. As if you have had no fever at all.”
A pale hand touched his jaw and Harry felt his pulse quicken as long slim fingers caressed his skin.
“Nice comeback, Potter,” Malfoy drawled coolly, the stormy gray eyes looking at him indifferently.  “Even after a year, it’s still good.”  Malfoy turned and began to walk away.  “You can have your wall back, I suppose,” he said over his shoulder.  “I’ll just go find my own.  And by the way, you should probably get your prescription checked again.  Granger and the Weasel just walked in.”
“I’ll be going then,” she said calmly.  She shot Harry an apologetic glance, to which he shrugged, and then glided out of the room with her light yellow robes swirling around her.
Harry wasn't going to say anything but his lips moved. "Just thinking about how far you're going to fall from your perch when I beat you."
He walked as fast as he could back to Hogwarts, dodging the rest of the students in the shadows, thankful no one could see his shaking body.
’ Harry thought wearily as he looked down at his half-done essay.  Two months had passed since the end of winter break and between Quidditch and schoolwork, they had finally managed to finish researching all the ingredients in the subconscious potion.
For those of you coming from "Qye", I ask that you look at the rating change and the tags.  If you couldn't tell by the end of this prologue, this story is going dark although I promise, I am not a believer in tragic endings.  There will be a light at the end of this and this story, their story, will finally be completed.
“Lest?” she asked again, carefully reaching a hand out to him.  She jerked as he unfolded himself suddenly from the chair and stood up, tall and strong and so very, very dangerous.
His fingers clawed into the bookshelf as he recalled the beatings, the black eyes, the blood-drenched old clothes.  “Yes, well.  He’s not missing out on anything.”
“I know better than to cross her when she’s in her mood,” the redhead said around a mouthful of kidney pie. He swallowed and continued at Hermione’s disgusted glare. “Besides, I agree with her.”
She felt a flicker of telepathic confusion and shock from the Head of the Hastai vampires as he found his own signal.
Harry took that as best as he could and broke his gaze to look at Draco, who stood watching him with his own icy expression.
“How unfortunate for you,” Harry muttered, picking up his quill from where he dropped it.  Turning his eyes back to the amused ones of the Slytherin, he frowned.  “Why did you do that anyway?”
“Stop being a brat, Qye,” Harry said and Sirius looked at him, standing up and casually flicking the other teenager on the shoulder to which Qye huffed and lightly bumped him back with his side.  Harry looked to them and Sirius watched the young man smile weakly, unsure yet encouraging.
He yanked open the door and snarled at the figure standing on his doorstep.  The figure had a black jacket and jeans on, the hood of his dark jacket pulled up so he couldn’t see the other’s face.  ‘
“I would like a few minutes alone with Qye and Harry before I have them go back to Healer Smethwyck for their daily check in,” Wainscott said, kind yet firm.
“I’m really okay, Ron,” Harry said quietly, his green eyes looking seriously at him.  “I’m just a little tired, alright?  It’s nothing to worry about.”
:: Harry scowled at Qye.  The younger boy said nothing but Harry could feel him smiling, still giving off the feeling of deep relief.
“No, please,” Harry choked out.  He stilled before suddenly going limp in their grasp, the Sneakoscope falling from his hand and landing with a solid thud on the floor.  Dean hovered uncertainly a few feet from his bed as the others looked warily at the suddenly still black-haired teenager.
He whirled around and collapsed onto his knees just in time to empty the contents of his stomach in the nearest stall.
The Gryffindors stayed silent in the corridor.  Ron was still fuming furiously but Hermione was murmuring calming words to him, slowly draining him of his anger.  The others moved around uncomfortably, some muttering darkly about the Slytherins. Harry continued to look down at the ground, feeling oddly calm though he knew he should have been feeling upset or embarrassed still.
He hoped by saying that, it would be able to cover any of his slips throughout the day and he inwardly grinned when he saw Granger take the line, immediately beginning to babble about getting checked up, hallucinations and whatnot.
Qye exhaled and Harry shivered as he felt that familiar brush against his mind.  He reached back and tentatively gave his own brush and closed his eyes as he felt the other clasp on, that familiar flicker of fear.
“ – that we can’t trust anyone but ourselves,” Harry interrupted, his voice softer than before and Qye gritted his teeth and averted his eyes.  “Yeah, I got that.”
Needless to say, Ron unfortunately found himself stuck by Malfoy’s side as they took on a few of the less telepathically inclined when the other vampires came, gritting his teeth as each one kept him from looking for Harry.  Judging from the more vicious spells Malfoy was casting – one leaving a vampire choking as a Cutting Curse tore through his throat – the Slytherin shared the redhead’s frustration.
.  You know, one of those creatures of the night that chomp on virgin’s necks whenever they get the chance and drain all the blood before turning you into one of - ”
Barely half a year ago, he would have never given any of his assignments over to the other boy and now here he was, taking advice from the Slytherin, trusting his word at least on this.  Looking at the blond, Harry mused about how much their rivalry seemed to have lessened since the beginning of the year.  Was Malfoy still his rival?
“Harry,” she said gently, “I know you said you needed time to think things through.  That you were still figuring things out.  But you have to know that Ron and I would never cast you aside, not for anything.”
The pale lips twitched again.  “Well,” the blue-eyed vampire drawled slightly, leaning further against the table, “you’ve been staring at me vacantly for a minute now.  And now that I think about it, there was an absent look in your eyes when you picked the stalk up.  Daydream much?”
"Now, does anyone care to share why exactly Hermione lost?" Professor Opacre asked finally, after the Gryffindors hurriedly finished their congratulations. There was a silent response, even from the Slytherins, as Hermione frowned in their midst. Professor Opacre chuckled and grinned at them. "Okay, I see your point."
From his lips automatically fell a Shield Charm but his eyes widened even further in shock when the leg continued on through it, dismay filling him in an instant as he saw that it would hit his hand and the duel would be lost -
Harry took in a deep breath and exhaled slowly as he shoved the note back in his pocket.  All week, they had barely spoken to each other during classes, focusing on their tasks.  And every time Harry finally got up the courage to ask about Draco’s sudden question, the blond had suddenly found something else to do and disappeared before Harry could corner him without the presence of their inquisitive classmates.
“His fever is still pretty high but it is lower than what it originally was.” She clicked her tongue irritably. “The boy should have been brought to me at the first symptom. I could have cured him sooner and he wouldn’t have had to go through this all. I imagine his fever worsened as the day wore on and it only added to the unpleasantness of his attack.”
Lest's burning eyes snapped up...and widened when they found themselves staring at the end of Harry's wand.
’ she thought sarcastically, her quill flashing quickly over the parchment and writing the vampiric symbols, ‘
“Fine,” he bit out, stalking back to his armchair and dropping down, once more toying with something at his neck.  “Be quick about it so we can get this over with.”
Qye heard a deep breath and it felt like he could finally breathe as well, opened his mouth to call out, almost to the doorway spilling light and sound and
“Thank you for that succinct explanation, Qye,” Wainscott said, a trace of amusement in her voice.  He shrugged as she made another note before glancing at Harry.  “Is there anything you would like to add to that, Harry?
“This is what I saw,” she said eagerly as Harry slowly pulled it closer to him, glancing down.  He immediately frowned when he saw that it was a potion but Hermione continued, unmindful of his sudden tension.  “It’s a potion that the mists in the pensieve were theoretically based on.  Unlike an actual pensieve, however, it works by extracting the full memory instead of a copy.”
She hesitated and stepped aside to let him pass.  “I don’t suppose it would help if I said I’ve never personally had an issue?  I actually rather like dogs?”
“Don’t insult them!” he snapped, his eyes snapping back up to Malfoy’s gray ones, and forgetting completely about the other boy’s warmth.  His green eyes met the Slytherin’s furiously and he continued without thinking.  “It’s funny who you’re calling a rodent here, Ferret,” he said sarcastically.
:: He stopped.  Qye had obviously lived there before him and since he had just said he was ten and was shocked by finding out that he was living there now…was this boy a ghost?
“You didn’t have to!” Lest snapped, his expression cracking, an edge of pleading entering it.  “You’re my Carus, my responsibility, mine to look out for!  That’s what I’m trying to do instead of letting you risk your life like this!”
:: the voice muttered to itself.  Harry shuddered, pressing his hands further against his eyes.  He could still feel the pain from opening his eyes but along with that, he could feel the other’s pain.  He could feel the lingering effects, adding to his own hurt and fear flooded him at this new development.
“We could help you,” Hermione interrupted eagerly, turning in his arm and giving him a hopeful look. Harry smiled slightly at her enthusiasm and hugged her again.
“Bloody hell!” Ron swore as the beast lashed out in its bindings, sending more students shouting and pushing him further away from the direction where Dumbledore and the others had gone.  He gritted his teeth and pushed back, his hand firmly holding Hermione’s as they made yet another attempt to slip past.
That voice whispering worriedly at him, fretting concern, the voice he had been talking to and bickering with all these months, thinking it was someone else, thinking he could help –
"I don’t want his life," Qye broke in harshly, loudly, finally looking up and dragging Lest’s eyes back to him.
“Yeah, well…I am sorry for how I’ve been acting,” Harry murmured, arm still around Hermione and taking comfort from the closeness of his best friends. “It’s just…been a rough year, that’s all.”
Before Ron could respond, he heard Hermione shouting from the other end of the corridor, where she had been setting up defensive charms for the unconscious teachers and proctors as well as the younger students.  Her blue flames burned brightly, deterring the beasts from straying too close when they got past the others.
“Lest,” her brother said shortly and Marylin’s smile evaporated as she blinked, surprised, at her brother.
bow to your vampire opponent, Hermione, as I hear you would do in a wizarding duel. That would be a foolish opportunity that even the weakest of vampires would take advantage of. You may use whatever spells, hexes and yes, even curses, to either immobilize my brother, knock him unconscious or, if this had been a real duel, kill him."
Dean and Seamus jumped, turning to look at Harry who looked just as surprised at having said anything.  He quickly snapped out of it and looked at his friends somberly.
Harry had looked at Ron but his friend had not met his eyes over the sea of inquisitive Housemates and merely continued talking to the twins and Ginny.

seemed to reach for him, wrapping him in silky but frightful tendrils of darkness. They clung to him, wrapped around all of him, pulling him into the other world where he knew without knowing that something terrible waited for him there.
,’ he thought again, except this time it was in instinctive recognition as he looked upon another body he knew so well because now he remembered, Qye remembered he had messy black hair Aunt Petunia tried to shave off and green eyes that needed glasses except he could see just fine now and knobbly knees and elbows from never being fed enough.
Qye replied distractedly and his left arm - again, it didn't feel like his action - moved to swipe away a few of the smaller trinkets.
Myn merely grinned at him and patted him on the head. Qye lowered his eyes, torn between glaring at her and slapping her hand away or leaning into the touch. He mentally sighed as she stopped and he looked back up, forcing a smile for her.
Shakily, he ladled some of his potion into a vial, careful not to drop any.  Glancing around, he saw the eager looks of the Slytherins, the sadistic gleam in Snape's eyes, the indifference of Malfoy - was that a flash of concern flash in those eyes? - and the worried air around the Gryffindors.
“What - ” he started hoarsely before he stopped, coughed and licked his dry lips. “Where am I?” he finished in a weak whisper.
“The Ministry felt that someone with my…affliction…wouldn’t be suited to care for an infant.  They were worried of the dangers I might have presented once a month, which I can understand.”
Rage unlike anything he had ever known roared up in him from an unknown source, overwhelming his serene composition and making his face twist unfamiliarly in fury.  Anger made his body quiver, made his usually bright green eyes darken, flashing dangerously.
“We’ll be here, after, alright then?” he called to them, making the two turn to him.  “Just…”  He struggled with his words, wishing he knew the right thing to say.  “We’ll talk when everything’s normal again, alright?"
Harry blinked at the blur and found Lest standing away from him, all traces of surprise and strangeness gone, replaced with something wrathful and dangerous.
,’ he thought, whimpering and curling into himself, curling into a ball, wanting to block everything out, wanting to push everything away, protect himself, get away, get away…
“You going to be okay there, Harry?” one of the twins asked, the easy grin on his face at contrast with the sharp look he was giving the blond.  “You just say the word…”
“They come here with good intentions, they say, but I see them talking with Dumbledore, studying us, learning about us.  Centuries of separation and it is no coincidence that they’ve come to us as soon as the Dazains ally with the Dark Lord,” Draco growled.  “The students see Professor Opacre teaching and I see her training us for a war.”
Harry threw his elbow into Wormtail’s chest, his face tight with anger and desperation, ducking and turning with all the quick skills he had as a Seeker.
When they checked in on Harry throughout the day – at lunch, after the last of classes, before dinner – they found him in the same spot they left him that morning, curled up under a blanket, staring dully at the top of his bed.
Marylin blinked, startled by the unfamiliar tone voice.  Lest frowned as Dumbledore took another step forward.
Ron snarled, taking a step forward with obvious intent of harm.  Harry grabbed his arm without looking up from the floor, his hair shadowing his eyes.
It took Remus a long moment to register what he was seeing, to let his mind acknowledge the two beds surrounded by monitoring globes and what lay in them.
“Don’t bother the students!” barked Snape, turning away from Professor Opacre and back to the students.  His eyes narrowed at them and he snapped, “What are you all gawking at?  You’re here to work, not to be the fools you are!  You should be approaching your last three ingredients by now!”  The students hastily resumed working as Snape stalked through the rows, growling at the Gryffindors.
The beginning of the summer was bad.  In the beginning, he had to suffer through the ridicule the press shot at him – obviously being led by the idiot Fudge, who had adamantly refused to believe that Voldemort was back – and the public was turned against him.  Howlers came for him daily, so many that he was shouted at for being so loud in his room by his Aunt and smacked by his Uncle.  The Daily Prophet again and again made fun of him and nobody believed his story.  Some Howlers said he killed Cedric.  Those hurt him the most and he retreated into himself, feeling like they were too close for comfort.  Ron and Hermione sent letters, saying that he shouldn’t listen to them and that it would all blow over but it still hurt.  The month of July was a dark, bleak month for him and it seemed like no one would ever believe him.  He gave up trying to reason with people who wouldn’t listen to him and inside himself, a dark part of himself, he bitterly hoped that they would get hurt for not listening.
“I know better than to trust anything you or your kind say,” Draco interjected icily and Remus watched the vampire woman flinch and drop her hand.  The teenager turned to Snape and gave him a stiff nod.  “I’ll see you afterwards, sir.”  Gray eyes glanced back at Remus, glanced down at the dog and then gave them a nod as well before walking away, heading down a path that Remus knew led to the dungeons.
The man from before stepped in between them and Qye narrowed his eyes as he helped Harry carefully sit down, trembling and holding onto the bedpost for support.
“It means Harry’s got all the magic instead of it being split between the two of us and he’s dealing with it,” Qye said shortly, glaring at Harry and refusing to turn around.
"I'm sorry but how's that cheek of yours?" she finally asked after a moment and Lest turned his scowl towards her.
Why else would you be messing up Harry’s trunk even more?” she sniffed and he looked ruefully at Harry’s scattered materials.
“I should have known,” Saira sneered, breaking the silence a few moments later.  “The Dazain bastards never had any honor,” she said contemptuously.
He had waited two days.  Two days and when Hermione had called and he couldn’t tell her anything – she had shakily told him she would call and that he best not scream in her ear and to call her sooner if he heard about Harry before, all as her hand gripped his tightly before they had reluctantly separated at King’s Cross – he’d broken down, snagged Pig and sent a roughly scrawled message to the pale haired git before he could think twice of it.  He hadn’t seen Malfoy since the attack and since there had been no casualties reported, he could only hope Malfoy knew something that he didn’t.
“As pathetic as a supposedly strong wizard afraid of an infant?” Harry suddenly said in a vicious voice.
“I don’t see them that way,” she stated clearly.  “And neither does Qye nor Harry.  My responsibility is the stability and well-being of the mind of my patients.  And right now, forcing an identity on either one of them – particularly one that neither is open to – would be more harmful than what is currently happening to them right now.”
’  No…he didn’t.  For some reason, it felt…right…being back here.  Being back under the cupboard.  He remembered being locked in here when he was younger, remembered it being the place he wanted to get out of.  But now that he thought about it, he didn’t hate it.
While waiting for Hagrid for Care of Magical Creatures, Draco had walked up to him and started talking to him about their Potions work.  It had taken him a few minutes into their conversation – which had shifted somehow into discussing upcoming Quidditch finals – to realize that there were several Slytherins around and, more significantly, Ron.
“Ron, what in the world are you talking about?” Hermione frowned, glancing at Marylin with confusion in her eyes. “Harry never - ” She stopped suddenly as she stared at Lest.
“I can’t believe all of you are being so biased,” she sniffed, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.  “That’s all a load of hogwash that Muggles come up who don’t know a single thing about magic and you’re all gobbling up their tales like candy.  And besides, what do you really know about vampires anyway?  And I mean facts, Seamus,” she added when she saw the Irish boy open his mouth.  “Not that fiction you read.  I mean things you find in textbooks and the like.”
Qye fell silent but kept his eyes on the Healer, unamused.  Smethwyck put his hands in his pockets as he leaned against a bedpost, glancing between Harry and Qye.  “I wanted to wait until I finished to say that we finally received the authorization from the Ministry for her to arrive.”  He looked at the floor, frowning as he idly rubbed at something with one of his shoes.
"The precious stones fell and fell and when they finally made it, as humans stood to accept the gift of Helene, the stones struck. Humans were injured and their blood spilled on the stones. The stones, having lost the strength of the Moon, instead took strength from the spilled blood.
“Okay, really,” Harry said, turning back to Draco, “what did you do to him to make him agree to this?”
“No,” he said quietly, taking in another deep breath and opening his eyes.  “No, I’m fine.  There’s no need to go running to Pomfrey.  I don’t want to start my hospital visits this early in the school year.”  He forced a smile, trying to reassure them he was all right even though he wasn’t sure if he was.  Ron sat back down but continued to look worriedly at him.  Harry forced his smile to look more real.  “Really, I’m fine.”
“All I know is one minute we’re keeping tradition alive and the next you’re telling everyone to back off unless they wanted to feel the wrath of the Weasley twins with Malfoy wealth backing,” Zabini shrugged.
Qye was silent and Harry felt his worry rise up.  Before he could say anything however, Qye whispered, ::
“I just realized something tonight,” he said, his voice low.  “There are just some things I can’t stand.  I won’t endure it.  Not even for him.”
Harry tuned out her chatter as he took off his current outfit and inspected the new clothes.  It wasn’t the burgundy suit with ruffles – outfit number three – or a blue coat with flowers embossed across it – outfit number eight – so it was already vastly superior.
“I can block them!” she shouted as she fought her way next to Lest, past the students and teachers, her blue eyes blazing as she kept her arm outstretched with her Gemmae clasped in her hand.  “I can block them, get the students back to their dorms!”
He looked up from where he was reading the latest correspondence from the rest of the council on one of her couches.
“Excuse me…” Harry’s dazed voice broke through and the other two turned to look at him. Ron and Hermione blinked at the baffled look on his face. “I grabbed Lest?”
“How was that funny?” Ron muttered, shaking his head and catching up with the shorter boy. Hermione blinked and walked up as well, apparently thrown aback by the odd moment from the typically serious boy.
“Well, we’re back for another year,” Snape said softly, his black eyes glinting.  “Hopefully, for some, this will be our last joyous year together - ” – at this he looked directly at Neville, who blushed and looked down at the table – “ – and for others, they will no longer have to deal with those less intelligent.”  At this, he looked pointedly at the Gryffindor side of the room.  The Slytherins laughed and Harry heard Ron crack his knuckles.
“I’m letting you go since there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with you,” Madam Pomfrey said, not noticing his silence.  “But if you feel any different, I want you to come straight to me.  And I want you to have lots of chocolate.  I think you have enough,” she said, motioning to the small pile at the end of his bed that he hadn’t noticed before.
“Draco, then,” the young man said and Remus couldn’t hide his surprise there.  Draco inclined his head.  “I remember the regard Harry had for you.”
Hermione sat on his trunk, already dressed, her pale face and the dark bags under her eyes mirroring Ron’s.
“He can help by kicking all the Slytherins out,” muttered Ron as he stuffed his schedule in his bag and glowered at his breakfast.  “Can’t believe he actually wants us to get along with the those sneaking, slimy scumbags.”  He shot a look full of loathing at the Slytherin table, where it was clear that the Slytherins didn’t like this new schedule anymore than him.
Taking a deep breath, she called out the first name on the list.  “Lavender Brown,” she said, lifting her head, idly playing with her quill.
:: Harry replied, watching his two best friends argue with each other with a faint smile on his lips.  ::
“Two hundred,” Blaise said straightforwardly.  She blinked, and then looked around the class questioningly.
“Ah…Professor Opacre,” Hermione began, looking slightly uncertain, “When you tell us to ask us questions…do you mean as you questions about DADA this year?  Or questions about you being a…a…”
He saw Malfoy’s jaw clench and when he spoke, his voice was tight but still controlled.  “I never said I did or wanted to.  I just thought that after our talk - ”
It flooded out of her and she coughed, holding onto her armchair as she stood, ready to call her son on the phone, to make sure the Pater Opacre knew.
"Resistance?" Seamus spoke, voice high-pitched. "I know I'm a Gryffindor but there's a difference between being brave and being
“This is the same one you had in your mind a few months ago, isn’t he?” Dazain said absently, his gaze searching Harry’s as the teenager uncomfortably shifted.  “The one who slipped me?”
Two figures suddenly came around the corner they were passing, both crashing into her brother. Lest stumbled into Marylin, causing her to yelp and stagger, barely managing to stop her fall. Lest’s war-trained reflexes kicked in immediately, shoving the two figures away with one hand, reaching for his Gemmus with the other, teeth bared. Marylin automatically took her stance next to him, her own hand flying to her Gemmae –
"You going to do better than your friends?" Lest asked and there was that amusement, that mockery, and it conjured visions of Hermione's ineffective spells, Zabini crashing to the floor, Dean mercilessly tied up, Greengrass yelping as projectiles aimed at her hand, Ron so close to winning if it hadn't been for that underhanded ploy and...
“Yes,” Harry said immediately and Qye turned his head from the others, his hand slipping down from his shoulder to grip Harry’s.
“You like that one, right?” smirked the vampire.  “Think he’s such a good boy, such a green thumb?”  Her eyes gleamed.  “Let’s see how deep that green goes.”
"Another factor is how well a vampire increases harmonization during Maturation. By harmonization, I mean increasing resonation so that a jewel is practically a part of the vampire. I can't explain the process very well, mostly due to limitations set by kind as to how much I can. All I can say is some vampires do it well and others...fail, through their own personal faults or perhaps outside forces. Whatever a pureblood comes out by the time they finish Maturation, however, will be the final result."
From the corner of his eye, Ron saw Malfoy slip something out of his pocket.  He caught his gaze, saw him flicker over to the vampire and instinctively started shifting closer.
“Brilliant, thrilled, having the time of life, wanting to know what’s going on here,” Seamus said immediately, still peering at him.  His eyes moved over to Ron and he raised an eyebrow.  “This wouldn’t have anything to do with Ron suddenly doing a complete one-eighty on his desire to rid the world of Slytherins, specifically pointy blond gits?”
“See?” the blond woman laughed.  Then she turned her eyes onto Harry, her twinkling eyes turning concerned.  “And how are you Harry?  I heard about your accident before I left for the break.  Are you alright now?”
:: the soft voice persisted but the black-haired boy merely made a sound of protest, burrowing deeper into the warm bed.
Distantly, he heard the screams and shouts of confusion from the students as they pressed back from the entrance, huddled in masses while the teachers tried to reach in front of them.  Another beast dashed forward and Lest caught it in his grasp, his arm wrapping around its body as it tried to struggle free.
“He’s speaking in the third person, Hermione,” Ron stage-whispered and Harry rolled his eyes. Clearly, his point was lost.
:: Harry finally shouted, green eyes burning. Qye's shock faltered the anger Harry had been receiving from him and he continued, angry and hurt and finally speaking his real problem with Qye's actions, more than the simple physical assumption of his body.
And just like that, understanding struck him and he couldn't stop the slow smile that spread on his face.
' he thought distantly, barely able to form a thought.  His head was on someone's chest, being held and he tried to cling to the physical, maybe it could anchor the mental.  '
“Weasley, Malfoy, stay there!” Sinistra called out as she and the Muggle Studies  professor aimed their wands at the vampires.  “We’ll - ”
Draco shrugged, lazily strolling over to them.  “You don’t have to take my word for it.  You can ask anyone who knows anything about the vampire war.”
His voice seemed to bring Hermione out of her daze because her face firmed up and she waved her wand again, hand deft and brown eyes further determined.
“That was the idea,” his cousin said, nodding.  Saira looked furious and even Leon looked disapproving.  His cousin turned his icy cold eyes on both of them.  “Unless both of you want another five years of fighting against wizards and Dazains?” he asked softly.
Both their gazes hardened and they nodded, Sirius taking his bag from Remus as they started walking towards the vampire.
Ron opened his mouth - probably to tell him it could - but he didn't wait. He pulled his sleeve away and dodged through his curious classmates to the front, wand sliding into his hand. Professor Opacre was beaming at him from the front of the room but he only spared her a glance before he took the spot everyone else had taken, hand tight on his wand. He raised his green eyes as the female vampire thanked him profusely, barely hearing her.
“The recommendation,” Lest said softly.  “Fine.”  He turned away from them, putting his hands on a bookshelf.  “Just…just make sure they’re safe.”
“Listen you,” he began, a vein throbbing on his head.  “I don’t care who the hell you are!” Vernon snapped, his dark eyes flashing.  “It’s a damn late hour to be calling at someone’s house like this and if you don’t get off my doorstep this second I’ll call the police on you!  And if that doesn’t damn well scare you, I’ll have you know I have a shotgun and we’ll see - ”
"During the nine months when pureblood vampires are in the womb, parents look through different precious stones, trying to see what best seems to resonate with the child. I can't go into specifics of how that is done but by the time of labor, the parents have at least four different stones picked out that seem to work best with the child.
Professor Opacre drummed her free hand on her desk, still smiling lightly at Harry.  “Okay…” she said.  “Okay, let’s compromise.  You let me do your hair, add some perfume and lip gloss, and I’ll let you walk out of here without the ribbons I was thinking about.”
The unnamed person stepped in through the doorway and silently closed the door behind them.  Vernon staggered to his feet, fear beginning to rise in him.  He could hear his son whimpering behind him and felt Petunia grasp at his arm fearfully.
"What the - " Harry began, an incredulous look on his face. Ron stabbed his finger and Harry raised his hands. "Alright, geez," he mumbled. The redhead resumed his trek to the middle of the room.
Harry nodded silently, stuffing his hands inside his jeans as he walked into the place where he had been raised.
Harry replied quietly.  Memories of Cho Chang and his lack of interest in anybody flashed through his head.
And with that, she dragged a confused Harry into the steadily growing crowd, leaving Ron alone with Malfoy.
“You do him no favors by indulging his childishness, Severus,” Marylin said lowly once the teenager was out of view, once again folding her arms across her chest.  This time her eyes blazed with anger instead of bright friendliness.
On the other side of the classroom, he heard sounds of relief from his classmates and he opened his eyes, beginning to straighten up.
Bringing up every ounce of his courage, Harry firmly met Professor Opacre’s eyes and said, “I was wondering if you could me choose an outfit for the dance you’ve set up.”
Harry’s eyebrows rose as he dropped the feather in, watching it sink and turn the potion a vibrant blue.
“Ron,” Hermione sighed, exasperated, as she poured herself some milk.  “Can you at least try not to pick any fights?  It won’t do Gryffindor any good if we lose points on the first day back.  Though,” she added, a bit gloomily, “we’re likely to do so seeing as we have Potions first thing today.”
“Are you alright, Harry?” Neville asked worriedly, the concern in his eyes matching Dean and Seamus’ as well.
AN: Opacre told the story of two boys meeting and growing before leaving. Qye showed their return. Carus will conclude the story of Lest and Qye, Draco and Harry, vampires and wizards.
“Oi!” Seamus interrupted, pushing himself to the front again.  Dean rolled his eyes and snagged him before he jostled the table.  “Still wondering here!”
She froze for a second.  “Lest?” she breathed, heart skipping beats.  He glanced at her, still with that look in his eyes before he swept past her to the room he occupied.  He paused at the doorway, his hand gripping the frame.
Ron turned to tell the people at the door way off but their dorm mates were already there, loudly complaining about wanting to get changed and started for the day, would everyone please leave, they weren’t stripping, didn’t they all have studying to do.  Dean gave Ron a thumbs up behind his back.
“Me agreeing to bond with you never meant becoming your damn property to do with as you wish, Lest!” Qye shouted, heaving, hating the way his eyes burned as he fought to maintain his glare, poured his rage right at Lest.  “To do what you say and what you want and how you want me to live!  And if you fucking think it did then you might as well kill me now because I’d rather be dead than live a life like that with you!”
“Hello, Frater,” Marylin said quietly, her blue eyes watching her brother look at her beneath his hood.  “It’s good to see you again.”
Qye snorted and looked back at the adults.  “So…not so much that you’re okay with it but there’s nothing else you can do so you have to accept it.”
“With what?  That he’s an idiot?  Kind of common knowledge,” Draco had smirked.  Harry had scowled, sure that the blond had done something, but before he had a chance to cut into the Slytherin, a familiar voice spoke.
“Why do you have guides for the N.E.W.T.s?” Ron asked incredulously, momentarily distracted.  “We’re barely taking the O.W.L.s!”
“All right,” he said slowly, dropping his piece of toast on his plate and packing up his notes.  Stuffing his notebook in his bag, he glanced over at his friends who were looking at him worriedly.  Pushing away his nervousness, he forced his most reassuring smile.  “I’m sure it’s nothing,” he said quietly as he stood up, slinging his bag over his shoulder.  They didn’t look convinced.  He made his smile bigger and said, “Really, he probably just wants to know how I’ve been doing.”  No change.  “Just save me a seat in Potions,” he grinned slightly, turning to follow their silent Head of House.  “Hopefully, I’ll miss the quiz.”  That did it.
“Harry took a potion he shouldn’t have because Snape hates our dad,” Qye said bluntly.  “It splintered our subconscious and made me.  We eventually figured out a fucking vampire messed with our memories, decided that we didn’t want to live each other’s lives and made another potion.  It didn’t work until Voldemort tried to break our soul.  That’s it.”
“Why you’re so tired,” Ron said irritably, crossing his arms across his chest.  “You went to bed at the same time I did, Hermione made sure of that.”  He narrowed his eyes suddenly.  “Unless you got up in the middle of the night.”
“Mr. Potter!” he heard the man shout behind him and Lest looked up, vicious threat in his eyes, and Qye’s anger grew, his hand trembling with the makeshift stake.  Lest raised a hand and Qye dodged quickly to the side, blinking and hitting the bedpost as another memory of dodging Uncle Vernon’s fist came back.
“Of course it was,” Ron muttered and Harry once again looked at him as his frown deepened and the redhead turned to stare at where the flyer must have been posted up.  Harry frowned as well.  ‘
“Do you ever think of anything else besides food?” Hermione asked, annoyed.  Harry noticed that she didn’t object to them going there though.
Setting a plate of eggs and bacon down in front of Malfoy, Harry sits back and watches his food being consumed as if by a starving man.
'You know I don't,' Draco reminded him, throwing him a meaningful look. Casting a drying charm on himself while following the others, he couldn't help but cast them dry as well. The magical warm wind made their cheeks flush, and Hermione threw Draco a small smile over her shoulder.
Whispers broke loose and smiles appeared all throughout the Great Hall. Draco himself even smiled, as he had always loved dressing up; especially for something as grand as a ball. Dumbledore explained a bit more about it and when it would take place. Hogwarts students from fourth year and up would be allowed to attend; younger students could go as well when asked by an older student.
Lupin had also been there, but left after dinner unfortunately. Harry hadn't really had much time to talk to him but had enjoyed his presence, had enjoyed watching Draco ask him a thousand-and-one questions about werewolves and other creatures Harry had never heard of before. He had still felt the stinging eyes of Arthur Weasley casted upon Draco with suspicion during every minute of dinner time; but he hadn't blamed him for it. It had just been weird, to see the man that way as he knew Arthur as a funny man whom liked to laugh a lot. Perhaps he had been acting that way to protect his beloved ones; afraid Draco would betray them and therefore betray his family.
Malfoy taps his fingers. “No. Potter, I’m going to explain this again, and again, and again until you finally agree to going.”
After a moment, Draco smirks. “Maybe I’ll teach you eloquence as well,” he says offhandedly, his flippant words contrasting with the smile blooming across his face. Kneeling on his bed and fiddling with the band on his pajama pants—his robe and Harry’s shirt and coat are still in the entrance hall—Draco’s smile grows. “Everything is good,” he murmurs softly, taking Harry by the back of his neck and pulling him closer. “I want you inside me, anyway.”
Draco's face falls so swiftly and so far down that Harry almost rethinks his words. But they are true, and they are effective. Apparently.
"Do whatever you'd normally do, then," Draco says, giving a pointed look that lets Harry know just how little concern he has for Harry's 'schedule.' "I'm intrigued to see the thrilling programme that is a day in the life of Harry Potter. Or do you think it might be too exciting for me?"
he wants to say, but as Malfoy’s left hand comes up to brush hair from his eyes, all that comes out is: “Are those
"Probably not, but it's certainly a start," Draco says, sparking hope in Harry because that means there will be
So he does, and when Draco lets out an indignant huff and fails to hit him back, but not for lack of trying, Harry doesn’t think about the fact that this will all be over, and soon.
"... we need you to attend this event, and as such, I shan't be taking no for an answer," Malfoy finishes, looking at Harry as though proud of his little speech.
“How are you feeling?” is the first thing she says, and Harry wonders if he looks like utter shite. Most likely.
"You're not helping, you know." Harry makes a face and walks steadily towards Draco, who is already standing in the middle of the lawn.
"So, this is your plan? If you practically move your snarky, infuriating arse into my house, then I'll want to go out all of a sudden? Is that your master-plan? Annoying me into socialising?" Harry glares harder, taking long chugs of burning coffee.
Unguided feet carry Harry into Sirius’ room, a place he refrains from going on every other day. It hurts. He studies the faces in pictures on the wall of Muggle women that Sirius put up to annoy his parents, and the smiles of Sirius, Remus, James, and Wormtail. Unconsciously, Harry pulls a sour-faced look of disgust at seeing the rat there, among people Harry loves.
Behind him, Harry hears footsteps coming into the room and stopping, undoubtedly at Malfoy’s usual chair near the table.
Hermione huffs out a breath, and the expression on her face is not unlike when she used to find him and Ron playing exploding snap instead of doing their Charms essays. "It is Draco, then. I knew it. I should always trust my instincts."
"I said I was waiting for something that day, and I said I'd know it when I... well, I wanted to tell you that I see it. And I know it. I
Harry chokes, mind already starting to slow with desire as blood rushes out of his brain and to his cock.
"Here." Harry says, sitting on the carpet in the middle of the floor and patting the spot next to him. "Sit the fuck down, Malfoy."
Hermione sighs, grabbing a shopping bag of her own and making towards the cabinets. "Have you seen the
The second thing he's aware of is that he isn't in his room. He isn't even in a bed, and yet there is a warm blanket covering his body.
"Funny," Malfoy replies, sinking down into the other armchair and picking up one of the trashy celebrity magazines that Harry flat-out refuses to admit to reading. From the look on his face, it’s obvious that he isn’t comfortable with being on a first-name basis, and that’s a large part of the reason that Harry dropped ‘Malfoy’ in the first place. "I don't need to be entertained.”
'Do you think another horcrux is at Hogwarts?' Draco speculated, seeing the same wonder in Hermione's eyes.
' he replied. With a frown Harry threw the invisibility cloak over himself again, disappearing in front of Draco's eyes. 'And don't make too much noise!'
About an hour after his arrival by the Lake, just at the moment when Draco thought he might freeze into an ice sculpture if he had to wait any longer, he saw footsteps appear in the muddy ground in front of him. An invisible person was making his way towards him, step by step. Draco smiled brightly as Harry appeared only a few seconds later, invisibility cloak clutched in his hands and himself wrapped in the thickest jacket Draco had ever seen. Apparently the boy from the tales wasn't made for cold weather either.
Harry thinks of Malfoy, and how he doesn't treat Harry like he's a war victim. Malfoy treats Harry like he's a person. An annoying person with crows-nest hair that won’t do something Malfoy considers to be simple, but then, that's a better opinion than Harry would have ever thought he'd get. Harry thinks that years ago, if someone had ever told him he would one day spend hours in Malfoy’s company without either of them throwing a hex, he’d have laughed in their face.
The speech is finally over after what might have been years. Harry nods, feeling awkward, and immediately searches Draco out in the room. President Cholmondely seems intent on bothering the hell out of him, however, and immerses him in conversation herself (though Harry thinks it must be pretty obvious from all the attention he has on Draco that she isn't the one he'd been wanting to sit with). Through the meal, Harry murmurs 'mmm's and 'of course's at Cholmondely, and he finds that, really, it's not so bad here.
He doesn’t know what the hell to do next. Harry can’t help feeling like going back to spending all his time bitter and reading would be some sort of… insult to Draco’s memory. Or something. Harry doesn’t know, exactly, but he’s surprised when, t the kitchen door, Draco hesitates.
Harry doesn't sleep that night, and although he's laughing as he slams the door behind Malfoy, the realization of what the next twenty four hours means is a bitter one.
Moving hair out of her eyes, Hermione says, “It’s difficult for him, with you kept up in the house all the time.” She sighs. “He had a lot of expectations for the three of us, and you’re the only one who isn’t fulfilling them.” Harry snorts and rolls his eyes. Hermione gives him a stern look. “You know that I don’t mean it in a bad way, Harry. I understand why you do this. Ron’s just having some trouble with it; I imagine that it isn’t easy for him to come by and see you now.”
"Didn't know you cared, Potter," Draco murmurs, and Harry turns back to see a smirk lifting his lips.
He almost wants to laugh at the look of terrified shock on Draco’s face, but instead he just makes his way to the kitchen.
When Draco’s mouth opens under his, Harry is eternally grateful that he isn’t drunk this time. He wants to remember the way Draco tastes forever. His cock takes notice under his denims, and can only hope Draco is having the same reaction. From the tiny gasps coming from under his mouth, Harry would guess that he is.
. “I'm late for work. Harry, I found Mrs. N, she's hiding in the downstairs bathroom. Just so you know.”
Malfoy snorts and steps closer. "You're rubbish at Silencing Charms. And you always forget them when you're angry!"
Draco shrugs, staring out the still-transparent door and biting his lip. When he looks back at Harry, grey eyes are clear and twinkling.
"I should think so," Draco says, tapping the cabinet twice and turning around to find Harry looking at him. Mrs. Norris scratches her claws deep into Harry's arm; he barely notices.
"Just saying," Harry mumbles, getting agitated. "Hermione's been trying for the past twelve months and she's a lot smarter and nicer and stubborner than you are."
They manage to get as far as the middle of the entrance hall when Harry decides that he really doesn’t feel like waiting any more. Dropping his hands to the belt on Draco’s robe—mouth watering at the nice-sized bulge that’s completely obvious through the thin material of Draco’s pants—Harry tears the belt away. Slowly, trembling with want, Harry pushes the robe off of Draco’s shoulders. Suddenly, there’s a canvas of pale, gorgeous skin in front of him, and Harry thinks he could stare forever. Lean muscles, slender hips, and peaked nipples all beg him to touch. He examines Draco’s entire upper body before settling his gaze on the erect cock that’s almost tearing through his pajama bottoms.
And he doesn’t want to tell Malfoy that he has his own park upstairs, one that took him weeks of magic and Hermione’s help to perfect. It’s just the ceiling—spelling the carpet to grass had ended badly—but to Harry, it’s perfect. It makes him think in equal parts of Hogwarts and an outside world where he can’t be disturbed, and actually, he loves his Park. But he doesn’t love Malfoy, so the git can find a different fucking park to go to.
Harry stays in the kitchen and fries up an egg and some bacon for himself, singing under his breath absentmindedly. When he finally catches what song he’s been singing, he’s not sure if he should laugh or punch a wall.
The paper crumples in his hands. Harry must have sent at least seven letters to Ron, and this is his reply—less than ten lines, including his name and Ron’s signature.
Shrewdly deciding that it’s best not to think of wanking while being talked at by Draco Malfoy, Harry forces his mind to change topics. Idly, he notices that Malfoy takes his coffee the same way he had in sixth year, and still holds it the way only he ever has: rested in the palm of his hand, cradled by fingers.
Draco pours him more alcohol. Harry looks into the other man's face, and decides that it is a much more beautiful view than the one above them.
Instead of an immediate spoken response, Harry feels fingertips brush his knuckles. He closes his eyes.
Malfoy mumbles something about being insane in the other room. Apparently, he's finally caught on. "Having a little epiphany there, Malfoy? 'Cause you know... I could've told you that years ago."
"But you know... even with all of that taken into consideration... I'm going to be totally honest with you, here, Malfoy. I don't like you. You're arrogant and rude. You have no idea about other people, and all you care about is yourself. And the funny thing is, now you're just like everyone else out there—you want a piece of me to make your life better, and I'm not interested. All right?" Harry turns to face Malfoy now, and the other man seems to be searching his face for something.
This is what Harry came back for, then. Friends that leave each other as soon as things get difficult.
That night is the first time that, when Harry is lying alone in his bed that night, he readily admits to himself that he really likes Draco.
“You don't look too hot yourself, Malfoy," Harry growles, more out of need for retort than anything. Although truthfully, Malfoy didn't look too well, either. 'Distressed' would be a good word to describe him this morning. And ‘malnourished,’ but that’s nothing new.
Harry inches closer, slowly because his mind is sluggish, not because he's thinking much about the situation.
"This is really weird, Draco," Harry mumbles, stepping down from the porch onto the ground. He reaches up with a red-gloved hand to rub his face. The other hand is clad in one of Draco’s duck gloves, and Harry hopes that he won’t get scolded for that. He’s come to love the damned things.
"I don't. Shut up. And I'm not coming to your Gala, so tell Janice I'm sorry she wasted her time," Harry says grumpily.
"You should be," Harry says, and, without thinking, inches closer. He catches a wave of the same, extraordinary smell of Draco that he'd experienced on the armchair all those days ago and closes his eyes, inhaling softly.
Hearing Malfoy say aloud what Harry has been trying to convince himself for the last year makes him uncomfortable. Shifting around on the floor, Harry sighs. "And there's the thing, Malfoy. I'm not sure that I did.”
Snorting and adjusting his position on the floor, Draco asks quietly, "Isn't your own backyard safe?"
They talk idly about Hermione for a long time after that, until Harry’s been through another cup of coffee and his stomach is grumbling unpleasantly. He kicks Malfoy out of the house so that he can make breakfast for himself—because like hell is he going to cook for that git—and when Malfoy leaves and Harry looks at the time, he’s surprised to see how long they’d gotten along for.
Harry, peeved from lack of sleep, points out, "You know, when you call me Potter, it makes me feel about thirteen.”
“Talking forever is better than being brutally murdered by my boss!” Malfoy informs him, composure cracking. Harry notes that Malfoy’s composure done that a lot today. He hopes it’s because Malfoy feels uncomfortable being here.
“’Course,” Ron says, as Harry and Draco file into his home. “Erm, he isn’t going to hex me or anything, right? Are you, Malfoy?”
Draco opens and closes his mouth several times, as if not sure how to safely answer. Harry finds himself smiling into his coffee cup.
Draco’s eyes go wide, and they stare at each other for a few silent moments until Harry shrugs and lends a half-smile. "I think it's only tasteless to joke about a death if it's... well, permanent."
He doesn’t have Gryffindor courage or Hufflepuff kindness (Harry suspects that if Draco ever did, they’d both go into shock), but he was brave enough to scold Harry into admitting the truth, and nice enough to listen to it with nothing more sinister than intrigue.
, but he doesn’t. Ginny hasn’t been by in a while, anyway, and he hasn’t had feelings for her in years. It scared Harry when, after the war, he wasn’t interested in her anymore; and not just her, but anyone. Now it no longer bothers him. He hasn’t even had a wank in what could be months.
“Have been, actually," Harry informs her, smiling a little. In fact, he’s been sleeping rather well. Probably because of the exhausting re-awakening of his libido.
panicked? Malfoy isn’t the one now expected to leave everything comfortable to him for a fucking charity ball. A charity ball where there would be speech-giving and expensive-food-eating and people looking at him like some sort of special race of alien that will do anything they ask.
Clearing his throat, Draco answers, "I bet we could Transfigure some proper grass. You know... if you really wanted to go all out with pretending you were in the park."
Draco watches him with a mix of amusement and sadness. Because he's leaving, Harry realises, and now he doesn't have a reason to come back. Even in his sadness, the thought that Draco doesn't want to leave makes Harry's stomach flutter pleasantly.
The most troubling part of all of that was how badly he had wanted to. When drunk, all of Harry's inhibitions had been down, and he had let every careful thought go in favour of kissing Draco Malfoy. Harry doesn't even know what to do now. When Malfoy comes downstairs later, things are going to be awkward as hell.
Throwing down a recognizable stack of letters and crossing his own arms in a gesture that puts Harry much more at ease because it’s so much more familiar, Malfoy says, in the same arrogant tone he appears to love using, “I want to know why you can't honour a simple request. I want to know why you failed to respond to a single one of my letters. I want to know why you think it's acceptable etiquette to return said letters without a simple 'Yes, Draco, I'd be delighted to attend your lovely charity gala' or even a 'Go and fuck yourself, Malfoy, I'd rather
When the first knock rings through Grimmauld Place the next day, Harry is honestly shocked. He knows that he shouldn’t be. He shouldn’t even be surprised. But he had been sure that Malfoy—and it definitely is Malfoy, anyone else who ever visited would have a key—wouldn’t come back, sure that he’d scared Malfoy off with the mention of his time in Malfoy Manor. Granted, he hadn’t meant to make the comment sting, it was only supposed to be a statement of fact. The way Malfoy had received it, however, made Harry think it had been taken that way.
Harry looks up to see Malfoy tracing little lightning bolts into his dusty kitchen floor, and snorts lightly. "I thought you wanted to know what happened."
"Helping: something you are not," Harry replies, nerves tingling at the thought."Which is strange, considering that you're the one who wants me to do outside stuff. I know there will be people. I know they'll probably be talking about me. I know."
Harry hadn’t been listening. Harry had been leaning against the counter drinking coffee and wondering why Malfoy had smiled like that.
, the cupboard puts in, and Harry hurries to shut it. He taps to it a clear message not to say anything, and the cupboard stays closed, although obviously unhappy.
"Read what?" Harry asks, as he’s drawn away from thoughts of followers, leaders, and both sides in a war that had no real winners and only losses.
His old life of sitting around all day, reading books with only Hermione, and rarely Ginny, for company. Harry sighs, and his thoughts go to Ron. He hasn't written back since Harry's last letter, a medium-length one that he wrote in reply to Ron’s five-line note, and the thought makes Harry want to cry—although that could just be the panic attack that is sure to come at some point, now that he's been outside of his house and surrounded by other people again.
finding out and hounding him about it was too severe. Since then, it seemed as though dropping a bomb like
"Probably. And after I was an idiot and it left—the something—I thought it was better, I thought I didn't need it, but... fuck, this is harder than I thought it would be," Harry inhales deeply, forces himself to make more sense. "I talked to Hermione—"
“Harry, mate,” He says, and then he’s launched himself forward and is tackling Harry in a hug that is actually rather Hermione-like. “You’re outside.”
Draco flashes him a smile, and Harry's heart soars. "I'm glad you came back," Harry says, grinning. "I wanted to show you something."
"True, Potter. True." Malfoy says, inhaling his coffee like it’s oxygen. "Where's your horrible cat?"
"Lie down?" Draco asks, voiced raised a few pitches in what must be terror at the thought of his expensive cashmere sweater touching the ground. "Lie down where, anyway?"
"I'm sick of seeing you hanging around my house looking half-starved,” Harry informs him, partly because it’s true and partly because he feels like he needs a reason now, other than
"You can't really?" Draco inquires, following him and sitting down at his now designated spot at Harry’s kitchen table.
"Plenty.” Harry responds immediately. “It's the difference between whether I'm saying no because I'm not interested in big, glitzy galas that cost almost as much as they make for their cause, or whether I'm saying no because I don't like you."
Harry nods, standing up to get more coffee. Ron doesn’t want anything to do with him, then. Well, fine. Great. Harry doesn’t need him, anyway.
Harry presumes he’s lacking more sleep than he thought, and snorts quietly. "Blanket ban on the 'Potter' while you're in my house,
When they arrive there, Harry takes a moment to look around: there’s a wide window pane on one side of the room, with a walk-out portico through it. An antique dresser sits in a corner near what can only be the entrance to a walk-in closet. The mirror on top lets Harry know that his hair is in a state.
forcing me," Malfoy says, "President Cholmondely is quite insistent that you attend this function, and as it's fallen to me to secure your attendance... You know, it's extremely rude to stand with your back to someone when they're talking to you, Potter. And do you know what else is rude? Failing to reply to—"
"Thank you, for last night." Draco says after a tense pause, "For the Gala, I mean. I really appreciate it."
Harry feels the beginnings of a smile melt off his face. "No, I haven't, and there's no way on this earth I'm getting into that with you. Forget I said anything about it. Seriously, or else you and your ducks can fuck off back where you came from right now, Gala or no Gala."
Harry’s chest fills with emotion at the words and their implications, and as he murmurs, "Sounds like a plan," and watches Draco smiling lazily, he feels like he could stay here forever. Well, if the marble underneath him weren’t so uncomfortable. "Did I really just have sex on your staircase?"
“I reserve the right to have Ginny knock you with her Bat Bogey Hex if you try to dodge us,” Ron added.  “Or, you know, owl Mum.”  He smirked at Harry’s slight shudder.
"I heard that, Theodore," Professor Opacre said, rolling her eyes. The scrawny Slytherin merely shrugged. She sighed and looked at the resigned group. "Really? No one wants to give it a shot?"
“Being blunt,” the Head of the European vampires said coldly, “is what I’ve been hearing true?  Is the Dazain rebellion truly put down?”
Qye’s brow furrowed. The blackout. One moment, Harry had been talking with Myn with Qye looking, the next, something had knocked Qye back into wherever he stayed in Harry’s body, making him lose vision. He shivered as he recalled coming back and panicking when Harry seemed disconnected from him. He had called out for the other boy and his confusion and fright and worry grew as he heard Harry screaming in pain. He had called for Harry and then he felt him coming back, the connection growing stronger. And then Harry seemed to be going away again, only this time, Qye had had felt Harry struggling to come back, felt his terror of something and he reached out, calling and…
"I feel very strange indeed," Harry admits, restraining from reaching up to mess his hair; he's gotten it relatively close to flat for the evening. It had taken him a full twenty minutes to find two matching socks, and the dress robes he’s in now haven’t been worn since Bill and Fleur’s wedding.
He’s a little more than surprised that he’s smiled at all today. Even with Hermione, smiles are rare; with Malfoy, they seem to be much more... existent. Possibly, it’s the second symptom that he’s losing his mind. The first, of course, would be all the talking to himself that he’s been doing lately.
Smiling brilliantly and making Harry blink twice, Draco continues on from his previous escapade, this time from behind Harry as he works over the stove. "I, for one, don't know how waking me up at five-thirty in the morning is supposed to help, and honestly, I'm quite sure mother rises hours earlier than usual just to ensure that her stupid owls come pecking upon my window before a humanly decent time..."
Closing his eyes and breathing deeply, Draco begins softly, "It's at my house. I can set up a direct, secure Floo connection, just for the night. Or we can Apparate right into the Manor grounds. You'd only have to step fifty feet out of your front door. As for the Gala itself, all you'd have to do is—"
Harry doesn't bother with a response as he walks up the stairs toward his bedroom. At this point, she only said it out of habit.
Cheeks flushed and hair all over the place, Harry thinks that Draco has never looked better. Even when he’s smiling.
Malfoy sighs, "I don't suppose it's as though you can tell anyone, is it? I have one mad old bint who thinks she's my mother, one incompetent house-elf, and... well, you."
The unhappiness in his tone throws Harry for a moment. Biting his lip hard and clenching his fists painfully, he finally swallows and says, "Yep."
“No need to be like that. There's a really nice picture of the two of you, that's all, and I was going to ask how it went—stop that!" Hermione shrieks, as Mrs. Norris attempts to snap an entire bag of chips from right out in front of her, and winds up scratching Hermione's hand in the process. Harry rubs his face, absently wondering where Mrs. N had been when he’d been in his room just now. Usually, she causes much more havoc when Harry leaves her and goes upstairs. "I was going to ask, but obviously someone there upset you."
“Yes,” Hermione says, not raising her head from the page she’s ostensibly reading, “But you never felt the need to honour that before.”
Harry smiles slightly, for the irony of Malfoy's understanding if nothing else. “Waiting is a good word."
"It's really beautiful," Harry says quietly, relishing the way Draco's face lights at the compliment. "I mean, it's probably cost a disgusting amount of money, but it looks really nice."
Draco seems to understand, because in a matter of seconds he’s yanked his waistband down. Their eye contact never breaks. Draco pulls at the both of them, sucking Harry’s cock with what Harry can only describe as perfection.
"That's better," Malfoy retorts, folding his arms across his chest. "I was worried you were far too mired in self-pity to get angry with me."
"Ducks. On your gloves," Harry repeats, sounding faint, shocked to the core for the second time today, and he can barely fight the smile attempting to work its way onto his face. "You're wearing gloves with ducks on them. Draco Malfoy is wearing duck gloves."
Draco goes about pouring his coffee, and Harry decidedly looks away. He knows that he must be a state, with his posture stiff and his arms folded and his undoubtedly hungover appearance, but finds that really, it doesn't matter anyway. He wishes Draco would just have his coffee and stop fucking with his head.
"You do realise that coming here every day is interrupting my own schedule?" Harry points out one day.
It’s an invitation to the newest W.O.T. event, a Quidditch picnic. Harry reads it twice before sending the owl away without a reply. He's not sure how he feels about seeing Draco, not after their drunken kissing session and awkward goodbye. He doubts he'll go, but he doesn't reject the invitation yet.
Harry raises an eyebrow—which, he notes with something akin to fear, is a quirk that he definitely picked up from Malfoy. "I'm not going to ask."
"All right, let's talk about something else," Malfoy says brightly, and Harry’s guard climbs up even higher. "We could go for a walk in the park. It's a lovely day... sunny with a chance of frostbite. You could borrow my duck gloves.” Malfoy’s smiling again, and Harry wishes that he’d stop that almost as much as he wishes Malfoy would stop talking about going outside. Although, the smile he wishes would stop because it’s fucking
"Oh, good," Harry retorts, rolling his eyes. "I'll look forward to that. And anyway, I see people. Hermione comes round every couple of days, Ginny and her mum if there's some special occasion. Ron... well, he's pretty busy with Auror training these days..."
Instead of concentrating on the ball room or the people there, Harry says his speech without thinking about it. He forces his mind to wander away to his Park, and while he's actually standing in front of a huge number of people, shaking slightly and palms sweaty, in his head he's sitting on a green carpet and staring at the sky.
Harry grimaces. Deciding to play oblivious, he examines the table in front of him and says, "I don't know. At home, probably."
Harry finishes, but instead of saying that he just leans over and grabs Draco's arms, hauling him closer. Draco stumbles over to him, and Harry presses them tightly together, as close as he's wanted to be all evening, and it's a kiss full of twisting fingers and alcoholic-breath and Draco Malfoy, and Harry is in heaven.
"I'll be there, all right? I said I'd be there, and I'll be there. I'm sure I don't want to at all, but I'm sure I'm going to do it anyway."
Suspecting that Draco doesn't believe him about the latter part, Harry quickly changes the topic. "Anyway, why not just get rid of the house-elf if it can't do anything right? It would earn you points in Hermione's book, if nothing else."
"Who do you think you are, my mother?" Malfoy snipes, “And anyway, you've no business telling me I need to eat, have you seen yourself?"
As Draco snorts and goes into another tirade, Harry finds himself watching pale arms gesture expressively, and long fingers settle around the bottom of a coffee cup held palm.
"Yeah," Draco finally replies, though he doesn’t sound half as impressed as Harry had. "It's clear tonight."
He glances at Draco lying next to him, and his breath catches in his throat. The smiling, closed-eye expression on Draco's face is one of relief, appreciation, and beauty. Harry wishes that look could last forever.
"Shut up," Harry says sternly, grabbing things from the cabinets as he decides on their next meal. "You're going to eat this and then leave, because I've a pounding headache and I need to sleep."
and the unsaid information that Ron doesn’t have time for Harry, not even an hour, but he can go away with Hermione for eight weeks with no problems.
Harry frowns. "Right." He Summons a small cage from across the room—wandlessly, because as he no longer has any concerns that Malfoy is here for nefarious reasons, his wand is put away—and gently pushes ‘Esme’ inside, handing Malfoy the cage. "Only, it seemed like it was about owls," Harry adds, stifling a yawn. He might not be suspicious of Malfoy’s purpose here anymore, but he still refuses to look weak in front of him. Force of habit, Harry supposed. Although Malfoy had looked pretty weak at his Azkaban trails, and Harry didn’t think any less of him for it; that being said, it wasn’t as if Harry thought any more of Malfoy, either.
He reaches out, and when his cold fingers touch Draco’s blushing face the shudder that goes through him makes Harry laugh. Grey eyes don’t even glare at that, they just get closer and closer until Harry can’t see them anymore, because his own eyes are closed and he’s kissing Draco with perfect slowness.
But Draco had sounded harsh just then, and Harry knows by now that's how Draco reacts to being hurt: he tries to hurt back.
“Actually, I can’t, thanks to Granger and her new laws against exactly that.” He sighs, but Harry notices that there’s no malice in his tone. Harry doesn’t think Draco minds this whole Reconsidering-What-Being-A-Malfoy-Is thing. “And what do you mean,
“Not yet, I haven’t,” Harry says slowly, furrowing his brow and staring at Hermione. “Is there something you know that I don’t? Only, you’ve got that look about you that says you’ve just figured something out.”
“I’m not lying!” Draco says, indignant. After a few moments, his face falls. “Nothing is wrong, per se.”
As long as Draco never finds out, everything will be fine. The Gala will happen, Harry won't attend, and then either Draco will be so furious about coming to Grimmauld Place every day for no gain that he’ll never come back, or he'll stop coming by, anyway, as soon as he doesn’t need Harry anymore.
Not for the first time, Harry wonders about Draco’s life as a Death Eater; for the first time, he finds that he cares.
Harry’s fist clench, and heat rises to his face. Is that what he’s worth? A reminder not to  get obsessed again because it would be
"So lovely to finally meet you, Mr Potter! I'm Janice Wrigglesworth, Draco's secretary." Janice takes his hand, and Harry bites back a startled and amused laugh. So this is Janice. Draco hadn't been exaggerating. "You know Draco, of course... I've heard
The next several days are some of the slowest since he’d first decided not to leave the house after the war. Harry wakes up on Thursday, the day after Hermione brought him food packages and Draco left for good, not knowing what to do with himself. Two months ago, he would have reached next to him and gotten his newest novel from the bedside table, or gotten up and worked on his wandless magic. Harry rejects both of those ideas, and tries to tell himself that it isn’t because he’d rather have snarky arguments with Draco than do either of those things.
Hermione purses her lips, though Harry suspects that the annoyance isn’t for him. “That isn’t a question.”
"You're late," Harry accuses one day, when Malfoy comes an hour or two later than usual. Harry would never admit it out loud, but he had been worried that Malfoy wouldn't show up at all; worried that he'd found a different way to get Harry to go to the Gala, one that didn't include seeing him every day. "Mrs. N and I had to eat your bacon."
Harry extends his magic to feel the wards; they certainly aren’t weak, but he reckons it will only take a minute or two to tear them down. He does so as quickly as possible, barely glancing around himself at all while he does. If something happens to him now, he deserves it after the way he treated Draco.
Harry thinks. How has he somehow forgotten that the only person oblivious to all his time spent watching Malfoy's every move was... Malfoy?
Then, before any other words between them can be exchanged, President Cholmondely is sweeping him away and saying something excitedly. Harry is distracted by the gentle squeeze Draco has just given his arm and the raging nerves in his system, and doesn't hear what she's telling him. He predicts that as long as he nods along, he'll be fine.
"Too many jinxes on this place for them to dare knocking at the door... at least, more than once," Harry murmurs, mentally thanking Hermione for her charm work. "It's clever magic."
Rain soaks through his shoes, his shirt, his skin. It’s cold water, but he barely spares it a thought as it pelts him.
"Draco?" Harry asks, concerned. Surely the hideous house couldn't be that taxing on a good mood? Perhaps whatever kept him this morning made him upset before he even got to Grimmauld Place.
Draco smirks. “Then the only other explanation for that look on your face is that you’re nervous. Which under any other circumstance would be expected, as we’re currently outside,” He gestures vaguely to their surroundings. “However,” He continues, “It’s been two weeks since you walked up the Manor drive, and actually you’ve gotten much less jumpy about these sorts of things. Or a little less jumpy, because we should take into consideration that incident with the cat last week.”
"Thanks," Draco murmurs, as Harry spots someone across the room that looks just enough like an old crone to be Draco's boss. His observation is confirmed when Draco elbows him in the ribs and says, "She looks like she's coming this way, which means it's time for your speech." Harry's stomach clenches painfully. "And I should probably get back to my date."
The other day, Harry had read to him from an old book on Muggle diseases, and Draco had been so thoroughly confused that Harry had to stop multiple times in fits of laughter.
"Diagon Alley was insane this morning, Harry! Don't suppose you feel like coming down here and helping me put all this stuff away?"
Harry continues putting food away while Hermione retrieves the other packages. She’s picked up his favourite coffee, which is a relief, but Harry finds himself less happy about it now that there’s no one to share it with.
He watches with lazy interest as an array of emotions pass over Malfoy’s face. "Look," Malfoy finally says, sounding strained, "I realise that I've done things in the past that are..." Harry turns his back to Malfoy, shaking his head and barely believing what he’s hearing. Malfoy sounds incensed when he huffs,
The minute it's out if his mouth, he regrets it. Now Draco will think he's some sort of desperate... call-girl-shagger. Or something. And yeah, who cares what Draco thinks, since he's the arse making Harry feel angry and guilty and helpless and terribly afraid... but at the same time. Well. Harry doesn't know
They buzz up to Ron’s room, stand outside the door, and wait for the wards to give in so that they can enter. After a few moments, the door opens.
Also when Malfoy comes downstairs later, it will be their last conversation. When he leaves it will be for good.
Slightly embarrassed, Harry nods. "Oh, yeah." He pauses, wondering if he should say anything else about it, and then deciding that it's either say something now or have Draco think he's shagging call-girls on a regular basis. "I was joking... about the call-girls, you know?"
Harry doesn’t realise how anxious the conversation is making him until Malfoy’s soft “Oh,” from where he’s sitting at the kitchen table causes him to sigh outright.
"Ah Potter! Fancy a game of chess? Cards?" He shot Harry a wink, "Drinking game? God knows Draco has enough fire whiskey in his trunk to last a lifetime."
Parkinson groaned and smacked him softly over the head. “Idiot. We’d better go before one of them gets transfigured into a teapot.” She’d begun to walk away before turning to Harry, her expression soft.
Before he could respond, Zabini strolled up to their table, wrapping an arm around Parkison. “Hello, Pans, consorting with Gryffindors are we?”
"You will be permitted to visit Hogsmead at any time, instead of being limited to certain weekends. On top of this, you will also be able to make floor calls on the weekend, on the condition that at least member of staff is aware of where you are."
