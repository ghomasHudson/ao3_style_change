"Indeed, it seems you did," said Dumbledore calmly. His bright blue eyes looked over the top of his half-moon spectacles and settled first on Harry, then on Iana. "I feared that they had perhaps become lost."
"I think we're going to need help, anyway," said Iana uncertainly. "How did Dumbledore say he destroyed the other Horcruxes?"
"We think the Dark Lord might have found it and done something to it," Iana offered.
"Aww come on, don't be like that," said Dean. "You should finish up. Seamus wants to sneak into the kitchens to see if they can make boxty for us to try. You want to come?"
"But how did Harry win?" she asked no one in particular. "He would be protected, of course, but that's not much help. There must have been something else at play—" She stopped speaking, and looked at Iana. "The wand," she said suddenly. "Severus said he gave you Dumbledore's wand?"
Harry was torn between bristling with indignation, and agreement. In the end he settled for sending a scowl at Snape. It was duly ignored.
"So, why are you looking for relics of the founders?"
So Harry recited the words which had left his ordinary, comfortable world a shattered mess:
Lucius made a whimpering noise, and tried to cower behind his daughter, but it was made difficult by the levitation charm which still caused him to float above the ground like he was some kind of bizarre kite.
A torrent of fire flooded from her wand, as smoke curled around her like the grasping arms of long-dead shades. The flames reared up suddenly, and the roaring sound that filled the room was more like that of a huge lion, or a dragon, than any fire Harry had ever known. A gigantic shape, constantly changing, and bright enough to blind him, grew inside the towering blaze, and leapt at the Diadem with furious abandon.
She shook her head slowly. Harry cocked his head to the side, and tried to work out what was going through her head.
"What about you two?" Neville asked in return. That prompted a self-satisfied grin from Effie as she turned to look at Harry.
"Hey!" said Neville around the slim slice of tart he'd managed to salvage. "I'll have you know, that I'd die before giving away a secret, Eff."
"Alas, I fear that many things are changing, recently," said Dumbledore. "I do not expect you to take my unfounded concerns on faith. All I ask is that you do not meet with Professor Rosier alone. You still have many friends within Slytherin. Perhaps even a few in other houses" — his eyes lingered for a moment on Harry — "All I suggest is that you keep one of two of those fine young witches and wizards on hand. I find caution seldom causes harm, and yet a lack of it may cause much."
"You don't have to do this," said James, meeting Harry's eye. "You're just a kid. My kid, and I still have one good arm left."
." He finished scrubbing the cauldron, and shoved it roughly into Malfoy's hands.
"What are you, twelve?" she snapped, but the smile that was tugging at the edge of her lips robbed it of any bite. "Finish telling me about the Merlin-be-damned Horcruxes!"
"Hey, did you hear that Furley might be moving to the Cannons?" Ron asked. As usual, he pounced any opportunity to talk about his beloved Cannons. "Heard it from George."
As Dumbledore's eyes landed on Rosier at last, Harry could almost feel a crackle in the air. The Headmaster was a tall man, but in that brief moment he seemed to grow at least a couple of feet. Rosier was clearly trying to match him, but it was barely even a competition. Finally, whatever unspoken battle the two had been waging came to its inevitable conclusion, and Rosier bowed his head.
your name."
Iana looked thoughtful as she sat down on the edge of the bed. After a few seconds, she shook her head, a frustrated look on her face. "Maybe. He never let me into his office. I remember I once was this kind of white bowl thing on his desk when he was leaving the room one day, though."
Harry frowned, and reached out to pick the orb up. Before he touched it, Dumbledore's words welled up once more in his mind. There were protections on the Prophecies which meant they could only be touched by those mentioned in them. He pulled his hand back, as if burned.
Harry nodded. "Crabbe."
The look which he got in return neatly communicated that she was not buying it for a minute. Fortunately, his non-answer was sufficient to remind Ron, Seamus, and Neville that Effie still didn't know about the prophecy, or the Horcruxes. And if Harry had his way, she never would.
"I guess not." What would an eleven year-old have done with that information? Harry had no idea.
Two of the Death Eaters who had been pursuing Harry and Iana rushed out into the room, their wands aimed unerringly at them. They were both breathing heavily, and the mask of one of them was blackened and cracked down one side, but their wands didn't falter.
Fawkes released an angry squawk as Harry shoved Dumbledore's limp body off his mother, but he didn't care. She was covered in blood, though he wasn't sure how much was hers and how much was Dumbledore's, but after a moment, Harry realised she was still breathing.
Potter carries him into the small infirmary. As the Janus Thickey Ward is dedicated to illnesses of the mind, there is only one small room that is equipped with regular medical supplies that would be found in every room in other wards. When they arrive there, he sits Draco down on the counter and starts rummaging through the cupboards. Draco doesn’t pay much attention to what he is doing until he stands before him with a little bottle and a cotton ball. He applies the liquid from the bottle, which Draco identifies as dittany, to the cotton ball and begins to treat his arms and legs. Even to a person who has grown up with magic it is wonderous to see how the wounds close within seconds and leave his arms in perfect condition, just as if nothing’s ever happened. When his arms and legs are seen to, Potter lifts his hands to his head and Draco violently flinches back until he realizes that he just wants to straighten his hair. He leans into the touch that feels so comforting to his touch-starved body.
“Oh, come off it,” Potter says, “I’m filthy, stinking rich, I can afford it. I maybe not as rich as you are, but I could be if I agreed to sit model for action figures, like people are constantly requesting of me.” He chuckles. “Anyway, if it really bothers you, you can pay me back, when you’re better. I’ll even save the receipt.”
As Draco munches on his sandwich he feels kind of light, like a burden has been lifted from his shoulders and he concludes that watching a movie can be kind of cathartic, because the hopelessness he has felt earlier in the evening when he looked at Potter’s photos is gone, although he suspects the effect to be temporary. Or maybe he is overinterpreting things. Whichever way, he decides that he loves movies. It also makes him doubt his former affiliations even more strongly, because who could ever want to kill of people capable of inventing movies?
Potter draws him to the walk-in closet and pulls Draco with him as he backs into it. He drags him all the way into the closet until his back hits the back wall and then he slides down, pulling Draco with him. Draco still struggles, when Potter grabs both of his wrists into one hand and pulls first one and then Draco’s second leg to his chest and grabs him in a vice-like grip. They sit like this, Potter’s back to the wall, arms around Draco’s body, crossed in front of his knees. Draco struggles to get free, but he cannot move his hands or legs and therefore, resorts to biting the Prat’s arms.
“I’m sorry, Potter,“ Draco whispers into the other boy’s ear. “You won’t be able to come without my knot.”
Draco’s contractions came and went. Most of the time it felt like he could do this, but sometimes it felt like he wasn’t going to survive. He alternated between restlessly walking around, starting all kinds of chores that he would then abandon minutes later, and lying on the bed moaning in pain.
“I couldn’t agree more. That is exactly what I always tell my wife. But I want to talk with you about Mr Malfoy.” Well, if this isn’t exactly what he was afraid of.
“Hello, baby,” he said softly and reached out one hand to gently trace along the lines of his face, his skin impossibly soft against Draco’s finger. Harry reached for one of the baby’s tiny hands.
“I mean, you had your mother. Harry told me all about what she did for you and by extension for Harry in the forest.” The frown melts off his face again. He looks at her and blushes because there isn’t really anything he could do right now to make her understand, that he is sorry, that he has changed long before the war had even ended.
“Are you kidding me?
He storms off towards his room and starts on the flower pots and with each pot that leaves his hands he prays to Merlin and all that is holy that it will stay intact, that it will float back to its designated spot on the windowsill and finally confirm that this isn’t happening. But each and every one of them explodes as they hit the walls. And when all the pots are gone, smashed into a million tiny pieces with earth and leaves flying everywhere, he starts on everything, anything he can get his hands on.
When the movie is over, he doesn’t let go of Potter’s hand when they go outside, jumping at every unexpected noise. He comes to the conclusion that scary movies are probably not for him. Potter doesn’t need to know that.
“Fuck you open with my tongue?” Harry enquires as if asking for the time and if possible, Malfoy blushes an even darker shade of red, before he whispers, “Yes, that.”
“Okay, second of all, when it comes, nothing will be over. That’s when it’s going to get, like, really crazy,” Draco continued.
He could hear Harry crying, a testament to the fact that he had not just pushed a baby out of his body, because Draco was definitely too exhausted to cry.
this,” he replied, eyes never leaving the sleeping bundle. Their son was tightly wrapped in a blanket, only his hair and his tiny perfect nose was visible from where they were lying. His hair was jet black, just like Harry’s, and his eyes were a pale blue that surely would turn into grey with time. He had Draco’s slightly pointy chin, but Harry’s eyebrows and full lips. Draco had no doubts that he would grow up into a handsome boy. He was the most beautiful child he had ever seen.
“Oh my god! Draco, you just spoke!” she exclaims and lunges herself forward and into his arms. She knocks the breath out of him. When she settles back into her own chair and looks at him, he shakes his head. No, he hasn’t spoken. Because if he had, it would have been to Harry. His first words are going to be addressed to Harry.
“I feel like I’m missing something here,” Harry said, stepping back from his husband and pulling him along towards their bedroom.
“No disrespect, Mr Potter, but I think the words you were looking for are ‘Thank you, Scorp.’” Draco takes an audible breath, appalled by Scorpius’s sass.
“Oh, I stink, do I?” he says and Draco smirks at him. He laughs again, the sound filling Draco’s chest with an emotion he cannot decipher through the haze of the Calming Draught.
“It probably is, yeah. Just picture him. He’s going to be perfect. He’ll have your eyes and your hair and people are going to fall in love with him left and right.”
Draco lets a few minutes pass before he starts wriggling his butt against Potter’s crotch. Just to taunt him a little, he thinks. His father has just died, he is entitled to a little mockery. Thick as he is it takes Potter some time to realize what Draco is doing.
“You know what, Draco,” Potter snaps, “If you have something to say to me, why don’t you just come out and say it?” He glares at Draco, who opens his mouth as if to say something but closes it after a few seconds with a resigned drop of his head.
He rolls the parchment up and takes it to Schmendrick who thankfully is quick on the uptake and allows him to use his personal owl. He even instructs him on how to send future letters without having to ask him every time.
“Yeah, sure. Why should you have to stay home all the time?” Harry answered as if it was nothing.
“I’m scared,” Harry said.
“I could try out for professional Quidditch. Or I could help George with the store. I could ask McGonagall if I could return to teach at Hogwarts. I could even become a mind healer and bother you every day.” Another smirk. “The possibilities are endless. Well nearly. Getting married to Ginny is off the table. She has hooked up with Theo Nott.” Draco’s eyes widen in surprise. Shit! Why exactly is the Prat getting under his skin, when nothing else has been able to penetrate his stupor for so long? And what is it with the smirk again?
“I’m taking you home,” Harry growls, glaring at the boy.
Things progressed quickly after Harry’s little bout of panic. Draco’s contractions came regularly, immensely painful, but still farther than five minutes apart.
“I’ve already spoken to her. She really wants to see you and said to come by anytime. So, I thought maybe we could apparate over there when we’re finished. Or we can wait a few more days if you want to,” he rambles. He shakes his head frantically, before he even realizes it and it surprises him that he apparently really wants to go to the Manor.
This. This moment is it. Pure and utter perfection. His cock buried to the hilt inside Potter’s body, Potter kissing him eagerly, sloppily, moaning into his mouth, while he thrusts into Draco’s fist, impaling himself on Draco’s cock with every backwards motion. Draco wants to stay like this forever, but of course his treacherous body has its own ideas.
“It seems I’m having your baby. And also, I need to pee something fierce,” Draco answered snidely.
“I know, it is hard, Draco. I know, how you must feel. That there is nothing out there for you. That the wizarding world is glad to be rid of you,” she says and gives him a sympathetic look. “I would like to say you’re wrong about that. But I would be lying. There are, of course, those who do want to get rid of you. But as a person who was directly affected by the war, who has seen you during that time and noticed what you went through, I want to tell you that I don’t feel that way.” His eyes sting. Why is she talking about this now?
“Now let’s go lie down. I want to cuddle with my husband in the last few hours that I have him to myself.” Harry pushed Draco out of the bathroom and away from the mess he had made there.
“Bought you scones. It seemed like you’re in desperate need of some proper food,” he says, “Want to go for a little walk?” Draco nods and they start walking.
He feels breathless, he is so aroused that he barely manages to get enough oxygen into his lungs. When he looks at Malfoy, it seems as though he is struggling with the same problem. He is flushed and panting, already far more gone than should be expected when all they have done so far is exchange a few orders. He begins to fear that maybe this might be over far more quickly than he has fantasized about. Surely it wouldn’t go down well, if he came within five minutes. It would most certainly reduce his chances of a rerun.
“So… er,” he says, “You’ve noticed that?” He gives Draco a shaky, sheepish smile. Draco narrows his eyes and shoves Potter sharply. He has no intention of listening to Potter’s bullshit.
Life could be worse though. He could have been prohibited from returning to finish his education. Hell, he could be rotting in Azkaban right this second. Together with his father. And he probably would, if it weren’t for Saint Potter, who has made out each and every last one of his screw-ups as evidence of his reformed character. According to Potter he hadn’t been a coward who was unable to kill an already half-dead old man, he was an errant boy unwilling to do the unspeakable even though he had never had the chance to develop anything comparing to a moral compass. According to Potter he wasn’t a gutless pushover when he first refused to give Potter up at the Manor and then practically handed his wand over to him on a silver platter, no, he was an upstanding young man, doing his share in ensuring the Side of the Light won the war. He had, of course, done no such thing and even though it makes him chuckle to pretend Potter had actually said those words, Potter had also said no such thing. But just the fact that he spoke up for him and his mother at their respective trials was enough for them to walk free of Azkaban.
Thank you!
“You spoke, Draco,” Harry sobs. “And you love me.” Having almost forgotten his aching stomach, Draco pulls Harry close again and holds him while he sobs into his chest, which is a change that he could get quite used to.
“Er,” says Schmendrick, embarrassed. He can hear him shuffling, probably swinging his arms back and forth in mortification. “Well, please come to my office as soon as you can, Mr Potter,” he says and storms off.
“Well, let’s hear it then,” she said, sitting down, looking at the two young men with interest.
“Do you want to get something for later?” he asks. Draco shakes his head quickly and steps out of the café and into the sun. Potter takes some time to get out, probably needing to use the loo or something. Draco doesn’t care, he just turns his face towards the sun and waits. When he finally steps outside and joins Draco on the sidewalk, he holds a small bag up in front of him.
“Earlier, I woke up having contractions.” He could feel Harry tense behind him, but almost instantly he felt him making an effort to relax again. When he spoke, his voice was almost calm.
“Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy,” Draco says sternly, even though he doesn’t quite succeed at looking the part because he is flushed and clearly embarrassed. “Explain yourself.”
“Well, Mr Malfoy has clearly manipulated you into it. It’s pretty obvious. He is getting better, he is at a stage of his recovery where he could make real progress. He knows this, of course, and he is scared of it. So, he tries to distract himself.” What a load of shit! He most certainly is not scared of recovering, thank you very much. Schmendrick the presuming, self-satisfied bastard. What a load of utter fucking shit! He is, in fact, so furious that he turns around and marches back into his room, where he shuts the door behind himself and climbs into his bed. He pulls the blanket over his head, rolls over, so that his back is turned to the door and crosses his arms in front of his chest.
“He’s your cousin, you know? You should meet him sometime.” And that is when realization hits Draco. Potter is talking about the wolf baby. Or his cousin’s and teacher’s son. He probably shouldn’t call him wolf baby, even in his own head. It is, however, how his father had talked about him. He remembers Voldemort taunting himself and his aunt Bellatrix when news of the new family member got out. He also remembers the look on his mother’s face later, when Voldemort wasn’t around, and his father ranted about what a disgrace her sister was. In a lot of ways Lucius Malfoy had always been a perceptive man, but he didn’t get emotions, and he didn’t catch the glassy-eyed look of unshed tears that his wife bore that day. Even though he loved his father dearly and he still does now, he knows that his mother deserved better then and does even more so now. She has always been too gentle for the family that she has been born into. Always putting family and her loved ones first, she went along with everything that was asked of her. And he followed right into her footsteps. Well, Voldemort’s threat to kill his parents helped a little, but he would probably have done everything his father asked of him anyway. It is hard to picture a future for himself, a time when he isn’t here, but he hopes that he will find some of his father’s resolution in himself and manage to use it to do better.
Potter doesn’t speak for a while until Draco raises one of his eyebrows in question. He figures, he has to accept the fact that Potter gets under his skin and this way he might even get some information out of him. Potter the Prat, thankfully, understands his need for information.
“A way to track Harry,” Hermione answered for them. They fell silent for a couple of minutes before Ron suddenly banged his flat hand on the table.
Urgh, he is tired. So fucking tired. He can feel his eyes drooping while he is walking through the corridors towards the library. All he wants is to crawl into his bed right now. He can feel the corners off his mouth curling upwards dreamily as he imagines how soft and warm his bed will be, curtesy of the Hogwarts house elves who put hot-water bottles underneath the covers when the castle becomes chilly. But he sighs when he remembers that he has too much work to do. He has two essays due this week and he hasn’t even started yet. How could he have anticipated that eighth year would be this fucking hard?
“I – no! That wasn’t what I was trying to do,” Harry insists. Also, who does Malfoy think he is? As if Harry’s whole world revolves around him. “I saw him chatting up some bloke, offering himself up and as soon as I realized who he was I hauled him out of there!” How many times does he have to repeat himself before Malfoy is going to believe him?
“Okay, I’m going to clean him up a little and Harry is going to put on his first nappy and then I’ll be out of your hair. I’ll be back tomorrow around seven. If there are any problems do not hesitate to send me a Patronus and I’ll be here in no time,” Luna declared.
“What is it with the hat?” Potter inquires. Draco shoots him a look somewhere between helpless and angry. “It’s going to itch like crazy, take it off,” Potter says. Draco shakes his head.
“Second, Ron and his brothers will get over it. And also, they all, and when I say all of them, I mean Harry as well, could use some fashion advice from you.” She winks at him and the atmosphere between them lifts.
“I’m here to visit Alice and Frank, together with Neville. They are getting way more responsive now that Neville’s grandmother doesn’t come along anymore. But these visits take a lot out of him, so I join whenever I can.”
“I’m going to fetch you some Calming Draught!” He is back within minutes and again Draco swallows the potion without question. The effects are immediate, the sobbing ceases instantly and a couple of minutes later the tears stop as well. After about ten minutes Draco no longer feels like he is dying and he snuggles into the sheets. Potter still shoots him worried glances every few seconds and when he cannot take it anymore he shoves him lightly to signal to him that it is okay to leave.
In hindsight he would later conclude that someone has probably left the paper on purpose. It lay right on his table, after all. And it is not like Draco hasn’t seen the glares that he sometimes receives, even at JTW.
“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you,” Potter says quietly and Draco’s hand tightens reflexively around Potter’s because how could he be upsetting him right now?
Draco has spent a couple of weeks doped up on Calming Draughts and even before Schmendrick suggests to slowly wean him off the highly addictive potion he knows it is going to be hell to get off it. Potions hadn’t been his best subject for nothing. He knew the risks of taking the potion the moment Potter had handed it to him. He doubted though that Potter had known and his suspicions are confirmed when Potter walks into the art room on the third day of Draco’s detox. He looks stricken and isn’t able to meet Draco’s eyes, obviously guilt ridden.
“Well, it’s tradition to stick to certain names in a family,” Draco answered haughtily and elbowed Harry in the stomach when he tried to interrupt him. “That’s why I thought we might name him James.”
“You’ve done so well, Harry.” Another shiver wrecks Harry’s body. “You’ve taken my cock beautifully.” Harry moans quietly. “You’re such a good omega with my knot in your tight gorgeous ass.” Harry’s moans become more pronounced as Draco keeps on praising him. Draco starts rocking into him lightly and Harry’s eyes drift shut in pleasure.
“Oh, sorry,” Ron said. “What do you need?”
“You want to fuck me, don’t you?” Scorpius slurs in a voice that is surely meant to be seductive but only displays his state of inebriation. The hair on Harry’s neck immediately stands on end. He has never wanted to hear these words come from Scorpius’s mouth. The smart, little, well-behaved boy that had spent so much time at their house visiting Al, back when he and Ginny had still been married. Also, he is far too drunk for this. A rush of protectiveness surges through him and before he even thinks it through he is beside Scorpius and pulls him away by the arm.
“Good. Like nothing I’ve ever felt,” Potter answers with a strained voice. Draco lets his eyes wander over Potter’s body, while he keeps working his fingers in and out. Potter isn’t the typical omega either. He has way more muscle than is typical, his shoulders are broader, his hips narrower. It is no question that he would pass as alpha if he wanted to. His skin is littered with scars from the war that he has just ended, making him just that much more beautiful. Draco groans at his own stupidity. Calling Potter by his first name and thinking of him as beautiful isn’t going to make it easier, when Potter’s heat is over and he doesn’t want anything to do with him anymore, when he decides to mate another alpha and bear his children. Irrational jealousy over something that was never his and that could have never been his surges through him and he starts pumping his fingers with more force.
“Shall we go to a hairdresser tomorrow?” he asks. Draco shakes his head frantically. Just the idea of a stranger touching his head is overwhelming. “One of the nurses then?” But Draco cannot imagine letting them touch his head either. Potter looks embarrassed when he speaks again. “I could try,” he says quietly. He blushes when their eyes lock again. Draco shrugs, thinks about it for a minute and then nods. He can trust Potter around his head.
“Oh, just wait a sec,” says Mrs Weasley, “I’m going to pack you some of the leftovers.” And she starts wrapping up enough food for a little army.
“Harry,” he called out, louder this time. He panted when another contraction made the pressure on his bladder almost unbearable. A long, pained moan escaped him and finally Harry reacted.
“What if something happens in the meantime?” Draco asked. Harry brushed a tear from Draco’s cheek with his thumb.
“I don’t care,” Harry simply states and that is that. “Now get that cock inside of me, I feel like I’ve been run over by a freight train.” Draco chuckles, before he leans in and kisses Harry again while simultaneously letting one hand wander towards Harry’s entrance.
“She is, isn’t she? That’s kind of what I wanted to talk about.”
He doesn’t know how long he will have to wait for a response from Potter. It is maddening. Although they have spent so much time together in the last months he barely knows anything about the other man. What does he do except visit Draco? Does he have a job? Does he meet his friends? What is his day to day life like? There is no way he could predict how long it is going to take Potter to answer and the uncertainty is making him anxiously pace in his room.
“Oh, Harry, you don’t really need me,” she had answered in a sing-song voice.
“Well, I probably should have told you about that, shouldn’t I?” he says, going for an apologetic smile. Draco’s glare doesn’t waver.
He presses the parchment against his chest, feeling his heartbeat through the layers of clothes and paper. Can he believe him? He has said that he wants Draco multiple times, but he has a hard time getting that into his head. Because why would he? It seems so implausible that the Saviour of the Wizarding World could want a half-insane Death Eater like himself, that his head jumped straight to the conclusion that Harry didn’t want him when he rejected him. His cock, however, stirs just at the thought of consenting to have sex with Potter again, to tell him to stop when he wants to switch positions or to exactly tell him what kind of filthy things he wants the Saviour to do to him. He is, of course, purposely avoiding the real meaning of Harry’s words. He cannot imagine Harry doing something that he doesn’t want as well and he is sure that it would have been entirely possible to stop Harry at any given time. Didn’t he ask like a hundred million times if Draco really wanted this?
"So the Diadem is still hidden in Albania?" Harry asked her.
?" Harry's voice rose once more, pain and hurt rippling through it. "How could you do that?"
"You're gonna have to fill us in here, Lily," said James, looking every bit as puzzled as everyone else.
Harry returned to his book, flicking it open once more at the last page he'd read and ignoring Dean's downcast look. Eventually, amid much shuffling and sighing Harry was left alone again. It wasn't for long, however.
Harry nodded his head rapidly.
Through that door was another long featureless corridor, and at the far end of this one the door was wide open. Light spilled into the corridor from the room beyond, but Harry couldn't see what it contained. He edged closer, straining every one of his senses to their limit in the hope that he'd get some warning if more Death Eaters were present.
She looked up from her desk for a second as Harry and his classmates entered. "Sit," she snapped. "Hurry up. Hurry up! Merlin, save me from laggards!"
"We've sent a message to the Order," said Lily, her wand never stopping in its motions. Soon,every item of furniture in the room was animated, and just waiting for the command to attack. "We'll need to hold out until then."
"But Madam—"
If his friends thought anything of his rather weak excuse of being tired and wanting to turn in early they didn't say anything at least. The look he got from Neville as he left them to their conversations, which mostly involved Seamus and Dean making futile efforts to convince Ron of the hopelessness of the Cannons, suggested it wasn't the last Harry had heard of it however.
As for the rest of his friends, well. If his mission, and he was definitely thinking of it as a mission, with Dumbledore was successful, he figured he was pretty much off the hook. If he removed the Prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, there was pretty much zero chance that Voldemort would learn about it. Harry would be scot-free.
"You don't have to
"Hey, Effie," said Harry gently, brushing her hair in an attempt to comfort her. She responded by trying to pull him to her even more tightly. "Can't breathe here, Eff."
"He's still not broken through, then?" she asked, seemingly all business once more.
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but Juliet was not done.
"Now, I said! Both of you!"
"After what happened to Snooks, they must have decided to do something about the mess at last," said Iana, though she gave Harry a suspicious look. "I don't suppose you had anything to do with it?"
At her enthusiastic prompting, they all reluctantly abandoned their chairs, watching sadly as they were quickly claimed by others, and traipsed out of the portrait hole. The Fat Lady was fast asleep as usual for that time of night, and Harry was gratified that she wouldn't be making a fuss about them being out in the corridors after curfew.
"I'm just saying, you seemed to be getting on okay with her at Christmas." Quite how Effie was able to switch gears so effortlessly, Harry would likely never understand.
With a final good-bye to Remus, Harry headed over in the direction of his mother. He stepped carefully around the busy medics, making sure not to get in their way as they rushed back and forth with arms full of potions, bandages, and magical devices Harry did not recognise.
"Yes, Harry, what
Iana breathed a couple of deep breaths, staring at him with an unreadable expression on her face. When she spoke, it was slow and thoughtful. "I think I should probably apologise to you too," she said. "You didn't deserve that, and— Merlin — you're right. I've not got the faintest clue what I'm looking for. That's why I need to visit yours this Easter."
Despite the illusion of normality, however, deep down Harry knew that it couldn't possibly stay that way. Perhaps that had something to do with what happened on one rainy Thursday in October.
"No."
So was Peter Pettigrew, and Harry had been the one to kill him.
"Okay…" said Harry, uncertain where Dumbledore might be going.
The sudden interruption caused Harry's head to snap up to where Stump was glaring right at him. Harry resisted the urge to swear. Being caught out not listening was a sure-fire way to draw Stump's ire.
," said Harry as he made a face. What would everyone think if he started palling around with Iana of all people? Not to mention, she was still an absolute bitch, even if a few of the edges had apparently been filed off over the summer. "What were you talking about, anyway? What's wrong with Rosier?"
"Yeah, but they don't count."
"This is where you've been hiding away!" said Dean in the voice of one who spent very little time in the Hogwarts Library. If he wasn't careful he'd bring Madam Pince running in no time.
"Well, no," Harry admitted, "but what else can I do? Look, we both have much bigger problems than each other right now, right?"
"It is over, Dumbledore," said Voldemort. His voice was sibilant, and though his words were quietly spoken, they echoed around the room. His gaze shifted to the two Death Eaters. "The Prophecy? Do you have it?"
"Alright, so, where were we?" said Dean. "Oh, yeah. Effie's definitely gotta be on the list. She's pretty good now, but if your mum is anything to go by… phew. They'll need to add some bigger numbers." He whistled appreciatively.
"You always were far too taken up in your own myth for your own good," said the Death Eater. He shook his head before lazily pointing his wand at Lucius. "
She wasn't having any of it. "Why?"
Effie's little giggle, Harry's little joke clearly catching her by surprise, had a snotty, bubbly quality to it that he was sure would usually leave her mortified, but this time he merely sniffed loudly and rubbed the tears from her eyes. "He won't know what hit him," she said, her voice still a little weak.
"It was fine," they both said simultaneously.
reading at all.
The smile that answered that statement was a little brighter than the first. She turned to look at Iana, who was still hovering a few feet away. "And how are you managing, Iana?"
of training," said Ron.
She was no longer in her bed, but instead was sitting beside James who still looked much the worse for wear. A lot of the damage done by the dark spells which had hit him had been reversed, but he was still very weak, and spent most of his time asleep. Sirius had been in bed too, last time Harry had checked, but now he was gone. With Voldemort attacking, probably nothing short of Merlin himself could have stopped him from running off to help.
Till next time!
"But it's destroyed now, right?" Harry asked as he peered at the ruined journal. Surely whatever had happened to it had broken Voldemort's spells? "He can die again?"
"Voldemort," said Iana through her teeth. "He's here."
"Buggered if I know," said Harry. "I don't think I asked, and Dumbledore hasn't said anything about it."
Iana's presence made it feel like the place had become haunted by a particularly surly ghost. Most of the time she stayed locked away in the guest bedroom, and the about only times she appeared were meal times. Even then, she restrained herself to the words 'fine', 'yes', 'no', and 'okay'. As a result, Harry hadn't been able to get anything more out of her about whatever it was that had happened at Christmas.
“No, you don’t.”
“But I trust Harry. So, maybe one day all this will lie behind us at least to a certain degree.” She smiles at him weakly and when he tries to smile back, the tears finally spill over and he desperately tries to brush them away as soon as they fall.
“I’m so sorry,” he says, voice heavy with guilt, “I never knew. I thought I was helping you.” A small smile spreads over his face because, of course, Potter would take the blame for all of it, even when Schmendrick had been the one to continue with the treatment. One dose does not an addict make, but apparently his breakdown was severe enough that Schmendrick rather had him suffer through withdrawal than through mourning his father on his own. Draco isn’t angry with either of them. Even though his head is throbbing and he is sweating and twitchy. The news of his father’s death hasn’t really sunken in yet and it still hurts like a motherfucker. All of it combined makes him somewhat short tempered.
He can feel the tears prickling behind his eyes, still holding Harry’s hand in an iron grip. He leans forward, takes the glass and gulps it down quickly, determined to get this over with as quickly as possible. He can feel the effect of the potion immediately. It is hard to describe, but as soon as the potion touches his tongue, he feels that his control over it is gone. He glances at Harry again with wide eyes and in the brief moment before they ask the first question he realizes that he has treated this without the due respect. When they start asking questions, his body answers on its own, without his permission and without hesitation. At first, his voice is rough and scratchy from disuse and one of his interrogators is nice enough to refill his glass with water. They give him some time to drink, to clear his throat a few times before they resume their questions.
?” He ends in a high pitch, imitating his mother’s nagging.
“Scared, Malfoy?” Harry challenged, and winced slightly when Luna glared at him.
His days at JTW quickly become routine. Get up at seven, have breakfast in the common room with the other nut jobs, group therapy session, some free time after that and then lunch, also in the common room with the other nut jobs. After lunch he sometimes reads Muggle romance novels, because he doesn’t feel ready to stomach the Wizarding World yet. Luckily the library is full of the cheesiest junk he has ever laid eyes on. Some of these novels are quite steamy as well, but he cannot really stomach these parts. The words
Then again, how exactly does one go about having a crisis? He has never had one. He had, of course, had his share of nightmares after the war, but all in all he handled the whole aftermath of the war pretty fucking reasonably. By rushing into marriage with Ginny, lots and lots and LOTS of fucking and even more firewhiskey. He is a reasonable guy like that. He had also thrown himself into his work and as the years went by the nightmares had eventually ceased and with them his passion for Ginny.
“Do you want to go shopping first?” Draco shrugs. He doesn’t have any money to pay for new clothes however much he might need them. Money is not an issue at JTW and he doesn’t even know if he still has any money in his vault and he has absolutely no idea if and how he can access it, should it still be there.
“Hi Draco,” she says cheerfully and sits down in an armchair next to him. There goes his relaxed day of reading and painting and probably also wanking. He looks at her uncertainly. What has Harry told her? Is she mad at him, too?
“Come on, Draco. Come for me, please,” Harry manages through gritted teeth and how could he not do what Harry asks of him? Two more thrusts and Draco comes hard, blackness threatening to creep in from the corners of his vision. Three more thrusts and Harry comes as well, sobbing out Draco’s name, holding him tightly and then kissing him possessively.
“You realize that we have actually no idea what we’re doing here, don’t you?” Harry had answered incredulously, but it barely registered with Luna.
“Yes, well, but that is not what I’m asking you, is it? I’m asking if you ever had a man kissing your arse before. Has anyone ever circled your hole with their tongue? Has anyone ever pushed inside and really tasted you?” Malfoy is still tense in his arms.
“I can’t believe you gave me this,” Draco said dreamily as he watched their son lying in his cot right next to their bed.
When they arrive at Draco’s room, Harry lets him down on his bed. Harry the fucking show-off is barely out of breath from carrying him all this way.
“I have fantasized about licking every inch of that pale skin of yours, finding all the hidden places that you would only touch in the dead of night, when you’re pleasuring yourself. I want to run my tongue there, circle it around the place that my cock yearns for. I want to dip it inside, taste you, fuck you open with my tongue.”
This is how he ends up crying in the Burrow kitchen together with Molly Weasley. It’s positively surreal. And suddenly he is laughing and Mrs Weasley takes one look at him and starts laughing with him. Like two nut jobs they laugh and cry at the same time. When they finally sober, Mrs Weasley says, “Don’t you want to go outside for some Quidditch?”
Instead of handing the baby back to Harry, Luna wrapped him up in a blanket and brought him over to Draco. He stretched his arms out towards his son before Luna was even near him. And when he finally held him against his chest, he greedily pulled the blanket to the side to look into his son’s face for the first time. Within a few seconds he stopped crying and gazed at Draco with huge eyes, pulling faces every once in a while.
“Draco Malfoy,” he murmured into his husband’s ear. “You are the strongest, most stubborn person I know. You have been through so much already and you have never let anyone or anything defeat you. You can do this. You are strong.”
“No,” Potter argues, “I’m supposed to be an alpha.” He looks at Draco desperately.
at least once this evening and you said I was beautiful,” Harry retorts indignantly as if they were still trying to one up each other on the Quidditch pitch. But he is also still chuckling which makes it so much better than anything they have done before.
It takes till the fifth day until he gets an answer to his question. He is lounging in the library with a book when the door opens and Hermione Granger walks into the room.
“No problem, I can do that,” she answered. “What else?”
“Mr Malfoy, you will be informed of the results of this questioning shortly,” says the Head of DMLE. They leave the room as quickly as they can, nodding at Potter, ignoring him.
The elf appears within seconds and tells them that his mother is awaiting them in the gardens. They have a choice of either walking around the house or through it, but when Potter tenses at the prospect of stepping foot over the threshold, Draco pulls him towards the little path that leads towards the back of the house.
“I hate cats,” Harry retorted.
“Harry,” he breathed.
“Only an alpha could have done that, couldn’t they?” Potter tries. Still looking at Draco pleadingly, his eyes wide, waiting for Draco to confirm what he wants to be true so badly.
From that day onwards, Potter the Prat comes regularly at least once a week. In some weeks he even comes twice. Now that he doesn’t come together with Longbottom anymore, he usually comes during Draco’s afternoon painting sessions.
“It hurts, Draco. It hurts, get it out,” Harry almost squeals. His eyes are getting moist again and Draco can see that he must be overwhelmed from a manifestation that he hasn’t anticipated an uncomfortable heat and needs that aren’t quite painless either.
“The best,” he answers, never breaking his rhythm of pulling out and thrusting back in slowly. It isn’t enough, he needs more, his body is overwhelmed with sensations that all leave him wanting to fuck into the other boy ruthlessly, but he holds back. He doesn’t know from where he takes the strength or why exactly he feels this way, but somehow Potter’s pleasure has become more important than his own.
They think he is a nut job, he thinks, as he flops onto the comfy bed in his new room and smiles a little to himself. They have thought him to be worse things than a nut job in the past. Nut job is just fine with him. He rolls onto his side and retreats to his happy place.
“More – harder,” Draco stammers and Harry’s movements begin to become erratic, losing all finesse in his desperation to bury himself inside Draco, to come inside him, to fill him with his seed. He can feel his balls drawing up when Draco tightens around him even more, the grip of his body on his cock like a vice, but oh so good. He is about to come, nearing the edge with lightning speed, but still dead set on making Draco go over first. So, he tightens his grip on the other man’s cock and increases the rhythm of his strokes, biting his lip in an attempt to hold out just a few seconds longer and then finally Draco arches beneath him.
"It was the sacrifice," she said, shaking her head. She got up and started pacing back and forth across the room. "But surely it would only work if you know you're giving your life… and Voldemort gave us the ultimatum. Iana for our lives. It all fits, but— Oh, that man."
So, full disclosure, one of the driving forces behind this story was the following question:
"What… just happened?" Ron asked, still staring at the empty patch of air which had previously been occupied by Slytherins. "Did she really just leave after being asked?"
"Actually—" Harry began before Ron cut him off.
He could well remember what Voldemort looked like from Halloween. Tall and almost skeletally thin, his skin was as pale as bone, and his face was more like that of a snake than a man. There wasn't even the slightest glimpse of humanity in his baleful red eyes. The thought of him
"Then it's our job to protect you," said James with an ironclad certainty that Harry hoped was not misplaced. "If you ever feel you
Harry, however, found that he wasn't feeling hungry at all. While he'd never had the same voracious appetite some of his house mates had —Ron and Dean came to mind immediately— he'd never sat through a feast and left his plate as untouched as it was that evening. While most of his friends were far too invested in the task of giving the House Elves' work its due appreciation, Neville had been watching Harry.
"The Headmaster also asked that I give her his wand," he said eventually.
He glanced around to make sure no one was listening in. There was no one nearby enough to hear, and while he could see Effie staring at him with a strange expression on her face from the other side of the room, no one else was paying them any undue heed. Despite that, he flicked out his wand and closed the curtains, charming them silent as he did so.
"Unless you want to," Dean added with a suggestive wink.
She didn't even slow, keeping pace with them both easily. "You try and stop me!" she shouted back.
It was, of course, Sirius who managed to get in the first word. "So, how long have you and Harry been…" He waggled his eyebrows.
"I don't know," Snape snapped back. "The Headmaster did not like sharing his secrets, in case that fact eluded you."
"You need to be precise when dealing with Elves," she said, and for some reason she seemed a little sad as she said it. "They're not stupid or malicious, not usually, anyway, but they just don't really think like humans."
"My mother. She sacrificed herself to save me, she gave me a protection that Voldemort could never hope to defeat," she said, staring into his eyes.
"What do you want now, Potter?" Iana hissed, her eyes flickering over his shoulder to where she clearly expected Pince to materialise like a heavily bespectacled avenging angel.
Effie stared at Iana. "You sent him to the kitchens to die?"
He didn't need to be told twice, or even once. He quickly dropped himself onto the seat, which was indeed very comfortable. It wasn't long before Iana shuffled in closer to him, and they just sat there for a while, both staring at the fire.
"Well in that case I shall use the time to make sure the poor girl isn't—"
him? She loved
"This one is out of the way," Harry returned. "I'll be quiet. I promise. You don't bother me, I won't bother you."
A couple of things went through his mind at that point. First, didn't she already
"Hurry up, Potter," she said impatiently. "It's like watching Weasley trying to work out which end of his wand is which."
"Well, that'll be quick," said Harry with a shrug. "I have no clue what happened. I just knew what the Prophecy said, and knew I couldn't let Iana down after what she'd sacrificed."
Much of the room had been reduced to rubble, however, and amongst the destruction stood two figures. The closest of the two was Dumbledore. His hair and beard had been singed, and acrid smoke curled out from beneath his torn robes, but he stood tall and unbent before his enemy.
Gently, unsure if he was about to set her off again, Harry said, "I still don't understand why the name is so important. Your father was dying, he clearly didn't know where he was or who he was talking to. Maybe he meant something else?"
Dumbledore's eyes went wide as they landed on Harry and Iana, but even before Harry could work out what it was they contained, they narrowed once more, and he sent a torrent of fire towards his foe.
"As I believe Sirius wishes to explain, Lucius was never, to my knowledge, working directly against Voldemort."
"Is she okay?" she asked uncertainly, her eyes flicking from Harry, to Iana, and back again rapidly.
"We believe there are two more Horcruxes remaining," said Dumbledore, leaning forward again. "The first, we believe to be a relic of Rowena Ravenclaw, though we do not know what it might be. The second, however, eludes us. It is possible that he has not yet had the chance to create his sixth."
"The Prophecy," she breathed. "So it was real, then? Not some kind of trick by Dumbledore?"
"Iana Malfoy." Seamus leaned back with the attitude of one who believed they had found the one true answer.
"Okay," said Harry with a quick nod of his head.
"Then he called me Narcissa, my
"Are you actually taking her side?" There was no way he could have stopped the incredulous look he gave her. "Malfoy?"
"It wasn't." She very nearly shook her head again, but wisely stopped herself. "I know exactly what it said."
"She has been dead less than an hour," said Dumbledore, his voice utterly serious. His blue eyes, usually so bright, were dulled to an almost slate grey. "I am going to see what has happened here. I need you to use the Floo to raise the alarm. I believe Peter is on watch this evening. Tell him that the Ministry has been attacked, and that we are in need of as many Order members as he can find. If that doesn't work, take the Whitehall exit and Apparate to Hogwarts. Minerva will be able to raise the alarm. Stay hidden, and do not follow me."
"Could have come from one of your dad's speeches," said Harry dryly.
Voldemort was walking across the Hogwarts lawn in the direction of the castle, backed by his Death Eaters. The Aurors and Law Enforcement Patrol Witches and Wizards parted to let them through. A few looked like they might try to intervene, but were quickly pulled away by their co-workers. The reason for their uncertainty was immediately obvious. Pitched over the shoulder of a huge man, like a sack of potatoes, was Iana. She hung limply, and her long hair blew about her in the wind.
Soon the cabin was filled with jokes, good natured ribbing and no small amount of laughter. It seemed no matter how intent Harry was on being miserable, his sister really wasn't going to have any of it.
Harry forestalled the almost automatic objection. "
"I told her nothing," said Snape, his eyes flashing. "I merely gave her access to an item which once belonged to the Headmaster."
help Mr. Potter with his task of cleaning the class supplies. Perhaps with your help he will be able to perform the task to a tolerable level."
It was at that moment that the door creaked open, and Effie poked her head in.
Iana herself had been no more forthcoming. Despite Harry's many efforts to catch her alone it was obvious that whatever had happened at the Ministry had caused her to take Dumbledore's earlier advice to heart. She went nowhere without some kind of escort.
When Harry had first seen Professor Stump, his first thought was that she was one of the creatures they were meant to be studying. She was squat, with a collection of warts that could have put a hag to shame. She had two lazy eyes, which made it incredibly uncomfortable when she was talking directly to him, as he felt distinctly like she was about to walk off in two different directions. Her frizzy brown hair was tied into a loose bun which became ever looser as the day wore on. Finally, she topped it off with a pointy hat which was two sizes too small, and pinned to her bun at what she probably thought was a jaunty angle.
"Good."
The look Neville gave him said, very clearly, that he wasn't buying it for a second. "Yeah, you did. The longest was, what, a dozen words long? Bet the only reason you sent anything at all was because Hedwig was probably bouncing off the walls with boredom."
It almost caused Harry to miss what Dumbledore had said. When his thoughts caught up with his ears, however, his head snapped up. "Concerning?" he said incredulously. As in more concerning than everything else going on?
"Shut it, Malfoy."
"So, what do you have planned for the holiday?" Dean asked in a game attempt to break the impasse. "You don't usually head home for Easter."
"I dunno, I happen to like that particular feature," said Dean with a grin. "More to grab onto. Susan, though? Now that's a figure."
After they'd been so close, he felt the loss of her presence all the more profoundly. He could still feel the whisper of her smooth skin under his searching fingers, the swell and curve of her body against his own. He could still feel it, like the last reluctant moments of a vivid dream, evaporating into the growing light of morning.
"You," she repeated. "Before I came to know you, I never would have imagined giving my life for anyone. Not the way my mother did. Now, I understand— I do. You helped me understand." She fixed him with an intense look. "I'm not sure. I'm not exactly good with this kind of thing. But I think I love you. I think that's what the prophecy meant.
"What's going to happen?" she asked as he looked up at him. Her voice was scratchy and her face was blotchy with tears. "Do you think they're going to die? Is that why you've been locked in here since then?"
Iana, however, was there almost as much as he was. She soon started spending more of her time researching Harry's problem than her own, and it quickly became apparent that he had to tell her a little bit more about why he was so interested in Ravenclaw's possessions.
"We're not meant to," said Harry simply. "If we find it, we tell the Headmaster and let him deal with it."
"We can't just go around asking everyone," said Seamus, beating Harry to the punch. "This is meant to be a secret, yeah?"
"Well, I'm sure he wouldn't have wasted any time," Harry had to admit. Compared to his other Horcruxes the Diadem would no doubt have been significantly more noteworthy. Really only the storied Sword of Gryffindor was more well known.
Harry couldn't help but grimace. Neville's Uncle Algie could be most kindly described as stark raving bonkers.
Still, she didn't let go, and Harry shot a helpless look at Effie who shrugged, neatly communicating her own cluelessness. Harry wasn't sure what prompted it, but he pulled Iana closer in, and wrapped his free arm around her in a hug. It was something which he'd sometimes found to work with Effie.
"Come." Snape didn't even look up as he spoke.
"We need to ask someone who knows more about this," Iana said, frustration leaking into her words.
It was far too much to hope for that she meant Voldemort. Harry doubted that Dumbledore would have looked so grave, or Iana would have been so devastated if she was talking about Voldemort.
"Sir, Professor Dumbledore asked to see me," he tried. "I should really get going."
Next he found Remus Lupin, who was sitting up in his bed, despite the deep gashes which cut across the entirety of his face. The moment Harry saw him, the first time in months apart from a few Floo calls, he ran to hug him. Remus groaned a little theatrically as Harry squeezed him, but as soon as Harry released him, worried that there was some other injury he'd missed, Remus chuckled. It was a strained sound.
"You been spending too much time with Loony, mate?" asked Dean as he reached over to slap Ron on the back.
"No!" Iana slammed the book down on the table hard enough that one of the other tomes, a similarly weighty one on the magical flora of the Saharan meadows, fell off and onto the floor. "It is
On the one hand, Harry wanted to stay with his family, but on the other he could already see his mother's eyelids drooping as she downed the potion. At the same time he found that he
"We'll take a look tomorrow," said Seamus. For a moment it looked like Ron wanted to object, but in the end he simply accepted the fact that he'd been volunteered to spend time in the library, something which he typically avoided with some tenacity.
"There's the other prefects," Harry pointed out.
"Right," she said with a narrow smile.
That snapped him out of the daze he'd been in, and he spun around and sprinted for the door. It was a good thing the corridors were so quiet, if anyone had been wandering along them, Harry probably would have flattened them in his frantic charge. He took two or three steps at a time as he descended the stairs, nearly tripping on more than one occasion, but he didn't care.
"I was a right little terror," said his dad, completely unrepentant. "Why, I remember when I—"
Harry's response was immediate. "Okay. Do we go now?"
"Do you know how to duel, boy?" Voldemort asked, his voice as smooth as silk over a blade. "Did the old fool at least give you that?"
"Though it may fall of deaf ears, I would caution you to be careful around some of your erstwhile allies," said Dumbledore to Iana. The content of his words belied the casual way in which he delivered them. "I have no doubt that Lucius has advised you of the importance of vigilance in these changeable times."
Iana Malfoy, and she'd even allowed him a few pictures. It hadn't taken long, however, for her to get bored. By the third week of term Goyle had 'accidentally' broken the camera, and it had never returned. The expression on her face, though, would have been worth the effort of repairing it.
"Actually," said Seamus, suddenly looking thoughtful. "What about the House Elves?"
That drew a grimace from Iana. "He was one of Father's people," she pointed out.
"Does a Prophecy ring any bells?" she returned. "I might not know what it said, but I know it at least exists. Besides, everyone in Slytherin knows what's coming any day now. Don't you want those idiots you call friends to at least have a fighting chance?"
"Urgh," Harry groaned as he pushed some errant strands of hair away from his face. "She's just a bitch. You can probably work out the rest."
"How much do you know about them?" Iana asked, sounding surprised.
"Bet he wants to catch a look at
"Okay," said Harry, his voice dull. All the anger had been sapped out of him, and he found he just felt tired. Hadn't he been having fun with his friends just minutes ago? Now he was being told that his parents were going to fight, and probably die, in a war that he was fated to finish. "I— I think I need time to think this over," he said finally. "I'm going to go to bed."
"What?" Harry jumped to his feet. "If they find it then—"
A single figure was walking across the narrow bridge that separated Hogwarts from the gathering attackers. Before when Harry had looked out, there had only been Voldemort and a few dozen Death Eaters, now he could see the crimson robes of aurors, while Voldemort himself was nowhere to be seen.
Harry was going to argue, but Iana locked eyes with him and shook her head. His mouth snapped shut with an audible clack. "What's this about?" he asked her.
do? Why not tell someone in the Order? Wouldn't they be better suited to help?"
"Peter's with him!" he yelped, loud enough to be heard from the top of the stairs. "What the hell?"
There was no way he was going to ruin their happiness by telling them everything he knew. He resolved to try to protect them any way he could.
Unlike Sirius, James had taken it more in his stride. It had only been a few minutes after he had been given the news that he made his first 'armless' joke. Despite how terrible it was, Harry had found himself laughing along with everyone else more out of relief than humour.
"Aww, Mum!" Effie moaned, abandoning all pretense. "Why can't I stay? Whatever this is about it clearly involves me too."
"You want to talk about it?" Effie asked, looking unapologetic when Harry gave her an irritated glance. If
"What was all that other stuff about?" Neville asked, breaking his silence. "What's the sign that was lost meant to mean?"
"Might as well have."
Ron leaned forwards a little unsteadily "Yeah, but that's the case for all the girls, isn't it? Look at Ginny."
I should thank anyone who's stuck with the story despite it not being to their tastes. I know some have fallen off, as I absolutely expected. Sadly, not every story I write can appeal to everyone. So if you gave this story a look in and decided it wasn't for you? Thank you (though you're probably not reading this). If you've given this story a look in and found yourself enjoying it despite yourself? Also thank you.
"Had you completed the task more promptly, that would not be an issue. As it stands, you have wasted both my time, and the Headmaster's. I suggest you do not waste any more."
"I don't know, okay?" Harry shouted back. He looked around, willing his memory to supply anything of use that might identify the door through which he had originally entered.
"Professor?" she said, prompting him to look up. "We're done."
"That excuse might work if you hadn't spent most of that year at school with her," said Neville. "She's not suddenly turned into a Veela or anything."
That was a strange notion. Trust Malfoy? Had anyone said that to him last year, or even just a few months ago, Harry would have laughed in their face. Now, though, he found himself doing just that.
"Exactly!" said Ron. "Much better than last year."
Harry winced. That was a fairly accurate estimation, really. "There wasn't much to say," he said with a shrug.
"Oh he did," said Iana bitterly. "He turned to look at me, as if he was
That, at least, was unlikely while Voldemort had no body. "If they can't listen to it, then why are they trying to get to it?"
"How do we get out?" she asked him desperately. Her shoulders were sagging, and she was breathing heavily. Her arm was still bleeding, but the wounds on her face no longer left blood dripping off her chin. "Quick, Potter! That won't hold them for long!"
"I do," she said. "Want to, I mean. It's just— I don't know how you'll take it."
"You know Remus can't afford to come back here, not so soon after the Ministry ran him out," said James sadly.
. What the hell happened at the Ministry? What's happening
"You think you can just apologise and it'll be all okay?" she asked, leaning forward. "That it just all goes away?"
Then Voldemort mirrored Harry's bow, and stood up to his full height. "Begin!"
revision. At least, that had always been the case for Harry. Lily was firmly of the opinion that he could never do too much revision, and made a point of checking up on his progress every day at dinner. During the run up to his OWLs she'd even taken to submitting him to a pop quiz on a random topic every day before they could eat.
"Does that help us?"
The ghost scowled, but she did not leave. "Have you any idea how many times I have been asked for the location of that Diadem?" she asked him as her sharp eyes flicked them both.
"Try me."
"Thought you might miss it this time," said Dean as he shifted over a bit to make some space. "Reckoned you'd end up stealing your dad's car and flying it to Hogwarts or something."
A derisive laugh came from Snape's direction, but was immediately silenced by a fierce look from Dumbledore.
Where was his dad?
It wasn't until much later that evening that Harry was eventually able to pry both himself and Iana away from his family and the other revellers. He wouldn't have been surprised to find out that the entire Wizarding World had been revealed by the celebrations supposedly going on around the country. Apparently the Weasley twins had turned the entirety of Diagon Alley into a huge party.
James glanced over at Lily, who had a strained look on her face, and sighed. "We know that Harry, but look at how you reacted to everything before. Are you really sure you want to know?"
"It's possible, though?"
"Harry!" cried Lily when he burst into the Hospital Wing, Effie close on his heels. "You're okay— What happened to you?"
Harry blinked in surprise. But his Prophecy said that
"She said I'd been strong. Stronger than her. Stronger than Father. She said she was so happy that I'd found what had eluded her."
Perhaps sobered was not the right word, but Seamus stopped laughing for long enough to reply. "I bring the booze."
"Takes one to know one."
"What? No I—"
A long finger tapped against the remains of the book. "Within the pages of this diary, Tom sequestered a small portion of his own soul, split off by an act of murder, and contained by dark magics of the most ancient kind. With this anchoring him to the world of the living, Lucius realised it would be impossible for Voldemort to ever truly be vanquished."
Raised hands forestalled any rising ire, as she said, "No, no, no! I'm not taking her side, but bitch or not, it was still a bit harsh, don't you think?"
"No, but real talk now. Who's the
"This is magic at its deepest and least understood," said Lily apologetically. "I wish I could tell you more. I wish I could make all this go away, but I am not Merlin. I'm not even Dumbledore, and even he was at a loss for years."
Chuckling, Dumbledore shook his head. "No, not this evening. I find myself sadly underdressed for such an event." His eyes sparkled with mirth. "In addition, I am also somewhat unwelcome within the halls of the Ministry, and I doubt my arrival would be able to pass unremarked."
That shut Harry up long enough for Effie to return with a glass of water which Iana accepted wordlessly. She gulped it all down in a few seconds, and put it down on the floor next to her.
"Yeah, yeah. Point made."
At that moment, Fawkes reappeared in another pillar of flame. His long tail feathers reached out to Harry, as he alighted on Dumbledore's ruined chest, and Harry grasped it tight in his hand. Before he could so much as breathe, fire consumed the world around them, then winked out. They'd rematerialised in the Hogwarts Hospital Wing, and it was already filled with the moans of the injured.
His mother was alive. Effie was alive. Iana was alive. Somehow they'd all survived.
Still, with Iana Malfoy in the house, maybe a visit to the Dursleys would have been less awkward. Harry had no love for Aunt Petunia's clucking, Uncle Vernon's mildly terrified glaring, or Dudley's clumsy attempts to strike up a conversation about boxing at every available opportunity, but at least two thirds of them made noises of some sort.
Harry did so, and turned to his parents for answers. He'd never before seen them looking so serious. Even Sirius wasn't cracking his usual bad jokes. There was not even the ghost of a smile. The unease he had felt when Effie had told him to come through twisted into fear in his gut. Just what was this about? Dumbledore cleared his throat.
"What's this about, Malfoy?"
"But they'll stop him… right?" Effie asked, pleading. "Even if they don't, he'll want to go after the Girl-Who-Lived, right?"
Effie held up a hand. "Ew. Just. Ew."
As he reached the door, he was able to hear the faint sound of voices. He couldn't make out words, they were more like human sounding echoes. He paused for a long moment, but it soon became clear that the voices were not growing any closer. Where was Dumbledore? Was he one of the speakers?
Harry opened his mouth to argue back, but was stopped in his tracks when Stump's wand appeared in her hand and a Langlock Jinx hit him in the face. His tongue attached itself firmly to the roof of his mouth.
When he reached the Entrance Hall, he found it filled with two dozen witches and wizards, all standing around in an eerie silence. Unwilling to stop, he started pushing his way through them, and nearly made it to the door when he was stopped dead by a strong pair of hands.
"Well, thank you," said Harry a little absentmindedly as he thought over what they'd learned.
James didn't waste time joining in with the swearing that followed. "Lily!" he shouted as he spelled the door locked, even as the frame around it started to charr and peel. "Get the kids and run for it. We'll hold him off."
Through the after shadows of the flash, Harry looked up to see Voldemort swaying, his red eyes spinning up into his skull. Then, like a tree with its trunk cut, he toppled over backwards.
A few seconds later, the walls slowed and came to a stop once more, and Harry immediately realised that he had no idea which of them had been the exit. He had no choice but to choose one at random, and hope for the best. One had seemingly been hit by some kind of spell which had left a charred mark on the wood. He decided that that was probably his best option.
"Well that's a relief," she replied, her voice still curiously level.
He'd looked up the other artefacts to try and get an idea for the kind of thing he was looking for, and it just didn't seem to fit, either. The cup was just a cup, it didn't have any enchantments on it to make it special. The locket of Slytherin was similar. Things like them turned up every now and then, and while very few of them were ever confirmed to have once belonged to the founder their owner claimed, they were inevitably fairly ordinary items.
It didn't last long. After a few seconds Harry got up to close the door, but was stopped when Dean and Neville popped up just outside.
"Yeah, yeah," Harry grumbled as he turned in the direction of his own bedroom.
She glanced up at him, eyes narrowing dangerously. "I'd just know, okay?"
"So, what do you reckon it is this time?" asked Neville as they waited for Stump to call the class in. "Veela stealing men? Centaurs stealing women? Merpeople stealing children?"
Harry had seen the curse in action before, of course. Weeks had been devoted to the Unforgivable Curses in Magical Self Defence class. Mostly it had been repeated exhortations by the grizzled old Auror teaching the class that year to not be hit by it, but he'd also demonstrated it on some animals.
That was something Harry had never heard before. "Voldemort wanted to be a teacher?" He didn't bother trying to hide his incredulity at the idea.
"But that's been lost for centuries at least." It had been the first thing Harry's own search had turned up, but the fact that it had disappeared around the time of Ravenclaw's death meant that it just seemed impossible that Voldemort might have found it.
Harry gritted his teeth. He wouldn't rise to the bait. "Remus didn't hurt anyone," he ground out.
"Eh?" said Ron.
"I'm sorry," he said honestly, his shoulder slumping. "I'm just… I guess I'll never really understand what it's been like."
Lily could only offer them an apologetic smile. "People have said the same for centuries. Millenia even, but that's the thing about love. When the time comes, you'll know what to do."
"What's wrong?" Harry asked, but before she could respond an echoing boom which shook the entire castle.
Harry frowned and looked up over the book he was reading, an incredibly dull treatise on the nature of subconscious magic that he wouldn't have bothered with at all if not for the fact that the foreword had claimed it to be a key to some of the most powerful magics known. So far, Harry hadn't seen any evidence of them. "Ssshh! You'll bring Pince down on me."
“Harry,” Draco repeated irritably. He knew Harry wasn’t a morning person and it bugged him on the best of days. This, however, wasn’t one of his better days.
“Yes, yes, yes. Draco, please,” Harry begs and Draco knows that when Harry starts begging that his former panic is overcome.
Harry had still been apprehensive, but it turned out that Luna had been right. He didn’t leave Draco’s side for more than a few minutes at a time after that, and just like Luna had said, it was intense and intimate. They whispered to each other, and Harry held Draco through his pain. It was too soon to tell, but it felt like they were growing closer the longer Draco’s labour went on.
“No, that isn’t how it happened,” he growls. He hasn’t done anything that he shouldn’t have. Why does he have to keep defending himself? “The moment I recognized him, I took him home!”
natural process. It’s practically programmed into every woman’s DNA. I don’t actually have to do much of anything.”
“Scorpius,” he snaps angrily. But Scorpius just shrugs him off.
“Everything will change.”
Draco jolted awake with a gasp. His eyes blinked open and he looked around for what had woken him up. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary, however.
“Don’t give me that crap. You said you would let me be mean to you, now suck it up and don’t make me feel like an asshole,” he snapped.
“That’s an oddly specific fear,” Draco replied, confused for a couple of moments, before the pieces fell into place.
“Do something, anything, please,” he begs, throwing one arm over his eyes in an embarrassed gesture.
“Pull yourself together, you great baby,” he tells his reflection in the mirror and then turns on the shower. He has a quick wank, just to take the edge off. It’s never good to go out to pull when you’re desperate for it. Let’s be honest here, Harry would probably still be able to pull if he let himself go completely. Not because he is especially good looking but because of that fucking scar. In a way, the wank ensures that he isn’t tempted to lift the glamour that he uses to hide it.
“You haven’t answered my question,” says Harry after a while.
Draco looks at him with big eyes. Of course, this isn’t going to continue now that Potter has obviously developed feelings for him. And if Draco has had any doubt before now, the way Potter stands before him, looking broken and dejected, just strengthens his belief that it is best to end things now before they get too close. It isn’t because he loathes the Prat but because he feels that it is only fair. After all that Potter has done for him and his mother and probably even for his father, it is the only decent option to break it off now.
“Don’t worry, Harry,” Luna had said, patting Harry’s shoulder. “Draco knows exactly what to do. He just has to listen to his body. It will tell him exactly what to do. Like I said, instinct. Send me a Patronus when his contractions are no farther than five minutes apart.”
Over the next few days he tries his best to bother Potter as much as possible. He picks up Yoga, or something resembling that. Basically, he just makes it a habit to greet Potter with his butt in the air. Once or twice he decides that he urgently has to exit the room just as Potter enters it and squeezes past him, brushing his hard cock against him. He knows that Potter is half mad, when he is barely able to finish his sentences one day. And it is this day that he senses his chance to finally make something happen.
The truth of what has happened dawns on him and violent sobs wreck his body. His father, whom he loves like none other, with whom he hasn’t had good times in years and years, is dead. Before they could have met again, before they could have had anything resembling a relationship again. He hasn’t heard his own voice in so long that it takes him a while to realize that it is his own voice that reverberates through the cramped confines of the closet. Even if he still knew his voice this definitely doesn’t sound like him. It sounds broken, like an animal gnawing its own foot of to escape a bear trap. And he would gladly do just that if it meant he didn’t have to feel like this.
“I hoped that with James as the first name you would grant me a traditional family name as the second name, something celestial maybe?”
“I want you, Draco, but not like this. This is not how I want my life to be. Or yours for that matter. I want to talk to you. I want to hear about your day, I want to laugh with you, I want to hear about your hopes and dreams and fears. And I want to bicker, I want to fight, I want you to tell me how stupid and uneducated I am and how my hair is appalling!” He rakes his hands through his hair as if to make a point and Draco’s smirk deepens. Potter is right, his hair is appalling. Yet it is also soft and warm and it smells intoxicatingly of Potter.
When Potter has made it into the bed and Draco has drawn all the blinds and added a couple off silencing charms just for good measure, they stare at each other awkwardly. Potter seems to be mulling something over, biting his lips in a way that makes Draco’s breath catch as wave upon powerful wave of arousal wash over him. It is pure torture to sit here, just looking at Potter when really, he wants to tear him apart. Finally, Potter speaks, “Am I going to end up pregnant?”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asks and pulls Harry back to himself, kissing him lazily. Harry sighs into his mouth contentedly.
“Good,” Potter groans, “So fucking good. Please move.” But Draco doesn’t, even when every cell in his body is screaming at him to get on with it. Instead he tightens the hold of his arms on Potter and kisses his shoulders and neck, running his tongue along the shell of his ear, drawing impatient moans from the other boy.
“I don’t want your stupid potions,” Draco had snapped, but instead of answering, Luna had just smiled at him.
“I’m close,” Draco whispers against Potter’s lips, “It’s my knot.” Suddenly Potter jerks away from him, scrambling to get some space between the two of them, but Draco reacts quickly, pulling him against his chest.
“Okay,” Draco answers, “That sounds reasonable. It’s a pleasure doing business with you.” They scoot closer again, Draco throwing an arm around Harry and just marvelling in the afterglow of what they have done.
“Something. Anything!” he repeats, but Harry isn’t giving in.
They quickly make their goodbyes and then they are off towards St. Mungo’s. As soon as they are out of sight, Draco leans heavily onto Harry for his stomach is really killing him.
“Turn around on your side, Harry,” he whispers.
“You’re not a guest, Potter. You’re a forty-seven-year-old pervert who I’ve just prevented from fucking my son,” Malfoy snaps in return.
Draco was lax in Harry’s arms. He had given his everything on the last contraction and now he was too exhausted to keep his own head up.
“Why would you do that?” Potter whispers.
“The sooner you get talking, the sooner we can—” He broke off, thrusting his hips against Draco again, making his point clearer. “—do other stuff.”
Harry gave an unconvinced chuckle.
The next day it is Longbottom who comes by. It is all Draco can do not to roll his eyes. Not because he has anything against Longbottom, but because Potter is such a fucking Gryffindor for still sending his friends to visit Draco when he himself is too pissed off to even consider it. He smiles at his knees at the thought. When he’s got his face under control once more he looks at Longbottom and nods in greeting. Longbottom takes a seat across from him and passes him a Styrofoam container. His mouth starts watering at the first whiff of what turns out to be fucking delicious. He moans at the first bite and sends Longbottom a grateful smile.
I might write an epilogue over the holidays, however.
Well, his mood has officially been ruined and for a second, he contemplates leaving the restrooms and looking for someone to take home and fuck through the headboard, but then he hears it.
Potter comes by the next day looking even more tired than on one of his dark days. He looks drawn and the circles under his eyes are of a deep violet color. He hasn’t shaved. Or he might have at some time, because the stubble on his chin is uneven. His clothes are rumpled and there are a few stains on his shirt. Draco looks up from his bed, where he has been sketching, still determined to make it clear to him that he doesn’t want to see him anymore.
“I’m afraid there are no refunds,” Harry joked quietly. Draco chuckled, pulling Harry’s arms tighter around himself.
“Do you want my fingers, Harry?” he murmurs and Potter nods eagerly.
“Oh, okay then,” Draco said, and beamed at Harry. He had been missing work for a while now, but he had also been reluctant to hire a nanny. Who would have thought that it would be this easy?
“That doesn’t make a lick of sense,” Potter says quietly. Draco chuckles, “I know. You just have to let it happen.”
“I do, Merlin knows, I do. I have wanted you before I even knew what I wanted. I have thought about what it would be like to have you, to taste you, to fuck you.” He pauses, taking in Malfoy’s dazed look, the way he shifts slightly on the sofa in an attempt to hide that his cock is beginning to tent his robe, gripping his knees at the same time so violently that his knuckles are turning white. Looking at Malfoy makes him bold.
The night after Granger’s visit he lies in bed awake at night, thinking about all that she has said about Potter. He has thought once or twice that he has never really tried to get to know Potter. But even now, that they see each other almost every day, he still doesn’t know him. And that is even though Potter has done little else than talk and talk and talk at him for weeks, or months even. Draco doesn’t know. He feels rotten for not trying harder. Especially now that Potter spends so much time with him, when he has been so ready to forgive Draco and when he has been trying his best to help him through his issues. He concludes that that has to end now. Granger implied that there was something more between them and as she hasn’t met Draco before today that could only be because she has seen it in Potter which in turn means that Potter has probably developed feelings for him. Granger said that he needed to look out for him and that is what he is going to do by ending whatever it is that is growing between them. Because even though it helps him to get out and have Potter’s company it is not fair to lead him on. Potter should focus on someone who reciprocates his feelings and Draco certainly isn’t that person. It is nice how Potter is looking after him, but it should have been clear for him from the beginning that Draco would never like him like that. If he lets this continue, Potter will get hurt, he might even get hurt now, but surely the longer it drags on the worse it is going to get.
“No shit,” Draco deadpanned. He shuffled to the side a little, making room for Harry to scoot in next to him. Immediately, Harry followed the unspoken demand to cuddle up to his husband. Almost all the towels were on the floor now, but neither man paid them any mind.
“I don’t know whether you’re referring to the baby having or the peeing, but that’s a yes to both,” Draco groaned.
“Have you thought about accompanying me to the Burrow some time?” he asks. He has asked him about it several times already, but up until now Draco has always declined. He shakes his head, because he really doesn’t want to go.
He tries on different outfits and all of them are nice, but even though Potter has offered to let him pay the money back, he is not going to take any of them. Malfoys don’t borrow money, is what his father had always said, and although he is trying not to live by his standards anymore, seeing where they have led him, he cannot shake all of them.
They had met up often in those few weeks. It was awkward and hard to spend time with Draco, but it was also thrilling and fun. They had both apologised while stupid drunk on the first evening they met up, and every time they had touched on the war during any of their following meetings Draco had ignored Harry for a couple of days afterwards. And when Harry had kissed Draco a few nights before he was due to leave the country again, he had shut Harry off completely. Harry had sent him heaps of owls, but Draco had refused to take the letters. Even contacting the few of Draco’s friends that still remained in the country hadn’t worked out. In the end, the only thing Harry could think of to do was flirt with the desk witch at the Portkey Office to weasel the exact time of Draco’s departure out of her.
“Please, Draco, please.” Draco leaves him hanging for a couple of moments more, before he says, “Answer me one question first and then you’ll get my cock.”
“The real deal?” he asked.
“Don’t you want to meet him though?” Harry asked, nosing along Draco’s ear down to his jaw. Draco nodded weakly. “Then you need to push.”
“Are you ready for another?” he asks, looking at Potter’s slack jawed face. His eyes fall open and lock with Draco’s. He looks unsure again, scared and Draco curls his finger up just the tiniest fraction, helping Potter with his decision.
It is only when the door has closed that he realizes that he has quite the problem himself. He hurries off towards his en-suite bathroom, rips down his pants unceremoniously and starts stroking himself. He doesn’t remember the last time he has had a hard-on and he only realizes how much he has missed wanking when his stiff, warm cock rests in his hands. For a second, he thinks about drawing it out, teasing himself for a moment, enjoying the delay of his orgasm, but if Potter finds him anywhere but in his room, he will know exactly what he has been doing. He certainly can’t have that.
“Hot water,” he called, and began his pacing again. “And towels. Hot water and towels. I need…” He made his way to the ensuite and Draco could hear him rummaging through the cupboards there. A minute later Harry emerged with his arms full of towels only to realize that he had nowhere to put them.
“He makes plans now. Most of them revolve around you and where he is going to take you next, but that’s a real improvement. A few days ago, he said that he’s thinking about applying for university. I’m really thankful for that. Thank you, Draco, for getting him there.” He blushes again. He hasn’t really done anything and it feels weird to be thanked for something he hasn’t done. Granger on the other hand laughs.
“You have no idea how beautiful you are like this,” Draco murmurs and kisses Potter’s shoulder, while taking hold of his cock and guiding it towards Potter’s entrance. He rubs the head of his cock over it a couple of times until Potter relaxes.
Potter scoops him off the counter and carries him back to his room where he puts him down on the bed. Once Draco safely sits, he turns around and fixes the room with a couple swishes of his wand. Soon the room, just like himself, looks like nothing’s ever happened to it. He walks to the closet and gets out Draco’s pajamas and helps him change, then lifts the blanket for Draco to scoot in and tucks him in tightly. His hand reaches for Draco’s head again, brushing his hair to the side, before he leans in and presses a gentle kiss to his forehead.
exactly? Is Potter the fucking Prat fucking kidding him? The wrath he is feeling is of biblical proportion. He knows that, even though he feels that organized religion is a sham and therefore wouldn’t indulge in religious imagery under normal circumstances. But this is different, just as it always is when it comes to Potter.
“You are all still so young and already you’ve been through so much. It’s frankly ridiculous that this entire war has depended so much on the participation of children. I have always tried to shield my children from it and in the end, they have all ended up involved. It wasn’t fair to any of you. You all had to take on responsibilities that no child should ever have to bear.” She daps her eyes with a white handkerchief that she produces out of her pocket.
But soon he jolted awake again as the next contraction hit. He tensed up, drawing his knees up and curling his hands around his hard stomach.
“Chair,” he murmured frantically. “Chair… chair…”
He had turned up two hours early that day, his speech memorized. He had talked to Hermione about it, because he had wanted to make sure that Draco knew that, yes, he was sorry if the kiss hadn’t been what Draco had wanted, but no, he wasn’t sorry it had happened, because it had been exactly what he had wanted and he still wanted it. He knew that it would be difficult, he knew that they would be at each other’s throats a lot of the time, but he still wanted to try.
Comments and kudos as always are highly encouraged and very much appreciated and loved (seriously there is nothing better than checking your e-mails in the morning and discovering that you have a new comment).
Draco nearly sobs with relief when he finally starts spurting thick white ropes of come across his own chest, tightening around Harry’s tongue to a degree that makes him wonder if it would have hurt having his cock instead of his tongue buried inside of Draco, but he aches to try it nevertheless.
A soft whimper comes from somewhere down the corridor and before he has even decided to, he is walking towards the sound his exhaustion and his tasks forgotten. Someone might be hurt? The castle isn’t safe off the highly frequented paths. His steps quicken, when he hears it again, only slightly wondering if he even is the kind of person who runs to help people in need. Maybe Potter was right, maybe he has changed, because right now he is very obviously hurrying towards a potential person in need of help. He tracks the whimpers down to a door on the right side of the corridor, just behind a corner. He presses his ear against the smooth surface of the door in an attempt to get a clearer picture of what is awaiting him beyond. Someone is sniffling and whimpering there, but he cannot detect movement. It’s probably safe to go in. His hand that has already been resting on the door knob twists slightly and the door swings free.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry has told me all about your problems with the St. Mungo’s food.” Another warm smile. “I still remember when Arthur was there, after that horrible snake bit him. The food in that place really is dreadful.” He manages a shaky smile as a means of agreement, remembering yet another way in which he has caused them pain, because he has supported that. He remembers his father being jubilant that Christmas break and he remembers being too much of a coward to disagree with him.
“It does, if you want it to,” Draco answers and despite not really admitting to anything he feels that Harry understands.
This, admittedly one-sided conversation, is too much for him and it helps when Schmendrick’s voice suddenly calls out, “Mr Potter, good to see you. Could I talk to you for a minute?”
Pulling Scorpius behind himself through the club is hard, to say the least. And embarrassing. Never in his life has he had any desire to pull his son’s best friend past a guy sucking another guy’s cock. Neither has he ever had any desire to listen to Scorpius’s interested outburst of “Oh, that looks fun.” He begins questioning his choice of club. Maybe he really is too old for this. Well, he must be when Scorpius and therefore his kids are old enough to be found here.
“No, stop that,” he says, “You know I want this. Hell, I’ve been running around with a fucking semi for the past two weeks because you keep torturing me.” Draco cannot help himself, he smirks at him. Potter huffs a small laugh.
“I think, it’s time to go,” she says and walks over to him, peering at his canvas.
Draco looks down at where their bodies connect and wishes he could see Harry’s cock disappearing into his body. His own cock is rock hard, the tip an angry red, leaking copiously. He makes to touch himself but Harry bats his hand away and for a second Draco thinks that he wants him to come untouched, when a warm strong hand wraps around his cock and starts wanking him in time with Harry’s thrusts.
“I am not!” Draco protested indignantly.
He crawls off the bed and gets on his knees in front of it. Pulling Malfoy closer by the backs of his knees and sets to kissing every inch of his legs that he can reach, running his hands up and down Malfoy’s sides. He has him trembling in his arms within minutes, emitting little whimpers every now and then, until he can’t take it anymore and he begs for it, just as Harry has predicted half an hour ago tops.
“What?” Harry bellows.
“A birth is an intense and intimate experience; you should savour every moment as a couple,” Luna had said dreamily, not taking in the recurrence of Harry’s slight panic at all.
“Okay,” Draco said, then turned around so that he lay facing Harry. “I thought… well… today was nice and all, speaking to the other parents, and the kids had fun…”
“Are you an omega, too?” Potter asks and even though he would probably have believed Draco if he lied now, even though he is sure that he is able to smell the difference, he shakes his head.
“Draco?” Harry interrupted him mid rant.
“Because this is you and me. And for all the shit we have put each other through, I just know that this is going to work,” he says. For some reason it works on Potter, even though Draco knows that he is spouting utter bullshit. The other boy leans in again and when their lips touch again. This time, Potter opens his mouth and lets his tongue run along the seam of Draco’s bottom lip. His answering groan is obscene and becomes even more so when he angles his hips downwards and grinds his throbbing erection against Potter’s own.
“This is not funny, asshole,” Draco snapped.
Harry waited outside. With his bladder emptied, Draco felt confident that he would manage the few steps to the washbasin and then to the door by himself.
in a mental institution. So, maybe he really is crazy.
“See?” Harry said. “It might be over even sooner than we thought it would be.” Draco snorted a quiet laugh.
The reintroduction of the art of wanking into Draco’s admittedly quite dull life changes everything. Well, a lot anyway. It is as if his body is making up for lost time. He is hard almost constantly. The memory of kissing Potter keeps flashing before his eyes at the most inconvenient of times, making his cock twitch in his pants during meals or worse during his silent therapy sessions. There is something good about it though. His sleeping pattern improves considerably. He is more rested than he has been since before the Dark Lord’s return to power. Being around Potter, however, is getting harder and harder. They seem to be touching accidentally all the time and he is painfully hard half of the time. Potter seems to have the same problem, as Draco can hear his strained breathing and see him fiddling with his pants. Once or twice Potter has taken a long bathroom break, doubtlessly putting in a quick wank.
“I didn’t plan on it, it just happened,” Potter continues.
“We could?” Harry asked quietly, eyes round. It was as if he was afraid he might scare Draco out of it if he spoke too loudly.
“I’m sorry you feel this way, Draco, but we can’t do this. It doesn’t change anything,” he says urgently. Draco hits his fist against Potter’s chest once, twice, until Potter pulls him close. He struggles against Potter’s grip and manages to bring a few inches between himself and the other man. They lock eyes, still for a moment, until Draco leans forward again and presses his lips against Harry’s again because he needs this. He needs to feel somethings other than this raw emptiness inside him. Potter knows everything about him now, he owes this to Draco. But the absolute bastard pulls away again.
He opens the fly and zipper on his trousers and lets them drop, before toeing off his shoes and stepping out of his trousers. He quickly makes to take off his socks too, because he still remembers that Ginny has always thought it to be the bedroom equivalent of an Unforgivable to leave them on, even though he never did get the fuss. Still, he doesn’t want to fuck this up.
In the end, it isn’t as bad as it could have been. Sure, he is too scared to even consider any of his popcorn and he ends up almost in Potter’s lap, but it really could have been worse. He is not entirely sure how exactly, but he is sure of it. Potter wraps his arm around Draco, that’s nice, so the situation has an upside to it.
“Come on,” Harry says, “You have met almost all of them. It’s going to be okay.” Draco shoots him a doubtful look.
Suddenly, Potter fumbles with Draco’s belt, opening it and then releasing the button of his trousers, sneaking one strong, warm hand in there, curling his fingers around Draco’s cock. He bucks his hips in response, searching for friction, for release, at the same time kissing Potter fiercely, grazing his teeth across his plump lower lip. Potter seems to have released his own cock, because he lets go of Draco and instead slides his hot length against him, making him cry out. Both of Potter’s hands are on his butt now, pulling him close while he rubs himself against him.
“Your father is okay, too, I guess,” he says and shakes Draco out of his musings. “The dementors have been pulled from Azkaban. It is still rough, though. We have been trying to improve the conditions, but progress is slow.” His hands clench into fists involuntarily, his knuckles turning white. He doesn’t want to think about his father in that place, although even he has a hard time pretending that he deserves anything else. At least the dementors aren’t there anymore to torture him.
“You will have to be more specific. What is it you want me to do, Draco?” he nearly purrs. He loves calling him Draco, because it’s affecting Malfoy as much as a physical caress would have, maybe even more so.
Harry walked towards the bed again and sat beside his husband. He slung his right arm around Draco and laid his left hand on Draco’s where he was stroking the baby’s back softly. Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s temple and murmured, “Come on, you did so good until now, you can do this as well.”
The weight of all the things he had chosen to ignore about Potter threatens to crush him sometimes. But then when he returns the next day, his dark day has passed and he is in a better mood and Draco sees that there is a way to work through such trauma or at least to live with it and that gives him hope.
“I don’t know how I feel about you sitting at the very same table that so many people, friends and family, have sat at who are now dead.” Suddenly the thought materializes in his head, that this is probably going to be the first of his many one-sided conversations that is not going to result in forgiveness and it makes him feel relieved. It makes him feel taken seriously. “I don’t blame you for their deaths. I know that you haven’t killed anyone. It’s just…” she breaks off unable to find the words. Draco looks up from his hands and locks eyes with her. He nods his head at her to let her know that he understands. He hasn’t killed anyone, but he hasn’t done anything to prevent it either.
“I know, babe,” Harry conceded.
He is forced out of his routine of ignoring everything and everyone eventually. And, of course, it is Potter the Prat that does it to him. He can probably be glad that it took the Prat and his Saving-People-Thing this long to start on him. Fucking Potter. Always trying to save someone.
Hot tears threaten to spill down his face as he hears truths leave his mouth that he hasn’t even been aware of himself. But he refuses to let them fall, he refuses to avert his gaze from his interrogator, he refuses to show any indication of any kind of emotion. Years and years of training under his father finally pay off. The only sign of weakness he allows himself is to hold Harry’s hand and to squeeze it from time to time, when the questions become especially hard to answer, and to pull comfort from Harry squeezing his hand back.
, Draco thinks. It doesn’t take long and he knows more than he ever wanted to know about her wedding plans, how they are going to hold it at the Burrow (whatever that is), who is going to come, and how sad she is that so many of their friends cannot come anymore. Draco bows his head in shame. Granger prattles on.
glad. But Harry wouldn’t be Harry, if he didn’t react with kindness. He pulls Draco into a hug and rubs soothing circles on his back. After a minute or so, he pulls back and holds Draco at arm’s length.
“It was what got me a divorce, a sizable dent in my vaults and parents that are oftentimes too embarrassed to look at me for I have disgraced the family name,” he goes on, voice bleak.
“Don’t touch me,” he snapped, and swatted at him like he would at an annoying fly. Harry jerked his hand away and took a step back from the bed, stung. Luna must have seen his hurt expression, for she said, “Okay, Draco. I know it’s hard and it hurts, but you’re doing good and it’s almost time to push. You’ve almost made it.”
When Harry takes his time to answer, Malfoy bites his lower lip again, maybe worrying if Harry might have changed his mind. But Harry is equally uncertain. Will Malfoy let him do whatever he wants? Or will he laugh at him and throw him out if he suggests something as soppy as kissing. But the more Malfoy worries the soft flesh with his teeth the more pronounced becomes his desire to take a turn himself.
“Merlin, yes,” he hisses and ups his pace, each time pulling almost all the way out of Potter’s tight, clinging heat and then pushing back inside. To be buried inside Potter is the most perfect sensation Draco has ever felt. It feels like coming home, like everything that has always been missing from his life. All the more does his heart constrict when the more rational part of his brain tells him that this is not that. This is not Draco coming home, this is not companionship or love or mating, this is born out of pure necessity. Potter needed someone to scratch an itch. Not more, not less. He pushes his dark thoughts away, concentrating on the task at hand, determined to get as much enjoyment out of this as he can. He can pine away later.
“Thank you, Harry dear,” she says and begins shovelling food onto it. Draco’s eyes go wide at the small mountain that is growing on his plate and when it is set before him again he isn’t sure whether it is possible for one human being to ingest that much food. But he doesn’t want to be impolite, so he nods his thanks and digs in.
“Or him,” Draco quipped.
“I don’t want to,” he persisted.
For a moment, he was tempted to wake Harry up, but even if reluctantly, he had paid enough attention during their classes to know that labour could take forever. Harry probably needed all the sleep he could get now. Knowing his husband, Draco expected him to rush into a panic at the news that he had just had his first contractions. Harry wouldn’t manage to fall back asleep and that meant that Draco probably wouldn’t get much rest either. Because Harry
“Please, Draco, please,” he begs and it is only when Potter starts to rock back against him, that he draws his hips back, so that only the tip of his cock remains engulfed inside Potter, and pushes back in in one long, slow thrust.
) and he would be falling all over himself with ideas on how to help Draco, thus ensuring Harry’s untimely death.
Malfoy might have mocked him earlier for suggesting something as soppy as kissing, when he could have asked for anything and probably would have had his wish granted, but now he is positively melting into the kiss whimpering into Harry’s mouth, leaning into his hand. Harry breaks the kiss then, determined to find out what other intoxicating noises he might discover when he ups his game.
“Come on, breathe with me, then it will get better,” Harry said.
“And you thought that my son would be a fitting conquest to
When summer draws nearer Potter comes with bad news. “Ron and Hermione are getting married soon,” he says and Draco raises an eyebrow at him, unsure what exactly Potter is trying to tell him.
“No,” Potter says, “You eat it. You’re the one who had to live on hospital food the last year and a half.” A year and a half? It is the first time he has heard how long he has actually been at JTW and for a second, he is on the brink of panic, but then he looks down and sees Potter’s cake in front of him and just eats it instead. When he is finished and they both have finished their beverages, Potter pays.
“What are you scared of, then?” Draco asked.
Potter also tells Draco about his upbringing and he wonders how he is supposed to leave the beliefs behind that have been pounded into him ever since he can remember and probably even before that, when Potter tells him these kinds of stories. The Dursleys or whatever their stupid name is sound atrocious. He finds himself balling his fist and breathing heavily with fury a few times when Potter talks about them. Potter is usually surprised by Draco’s outrage and it just fuels the rage that, although, he definitely knows that he was mistreated, he apparently has no grasp of the extent of it. The abuse had become so familiar to him that he doesn’t see how bad it really had been. A child might not necessarily need to be spoiled like he had been, but it needs to be loved and he cannot fathom how Potter has turned into anything resembling a functioning adult when he had never had that.
“There’s an armchair over there,” Draco said in a way as not to spook Harry, who was obviously going through something.
“God, you’re beautiful like this,” he murmurs into Draco’s ear, biting the lobe gently, before placing kisses just beneath that have him arching his back. Draco shakes his head. “No,” he whispers. “Don’t say that when you don’t mean it.” Harry pulls back and looks at him, all the while thrusting slowly and deeply into the impossibly tight heat. Draco is flushed and trying to avoid his gaze, looking away in embarrassment. Harry reaches out his right hand, turning his head so that he can no longer avoid his eyes. His blush deepens and it only makes him look even more beautiful. His chest constricts with the realisation that this is something he can picture himself doing for a long, long time. And not only this.
“Okay,” is all Potter says, heaving a resigned breath. Draco scrambles to his feet, firing the strongest locking charm he knows at the door and then casting several silencing charms, before he gets to work on the desk. They are left with a grand fourposter bed much like Draco’s bed in the Slytherin dorms, with curtains hanging on each side, which they proceed to draw shut while climbing into the bed. Potter is weak, just getting onto the bed seems like an almost impossible task for him and Draco is tempted to reach out and help him, but figures there is only so much help that Potter is willing to accept before he snaps and blows this whole thing off. And no matter how true his words have been, how much he really wants to do right by him, for whatever reason, his cock is also screaming at him not to screw this up.
“Okay, yes. Yes, I would love that,” Harry rasped, throat tight with emotion.
His head is full of images of Potter, pupils dilated making his eyes seem almost black, flushed skin, the feel of the hot, velvety skin of Potter’s cock against his palm, the moans that escaped him, the look of pure want in his eyes when he pulled away. Within mere moments the pressure starts building, his balls draw up and he comes in long white spurts all over the sink, all the while one word is reverberating through his brain.
“Yes,” Potter hisses in response to the brush against his prostate and barely a second later Draco pushes inside of him with two fingers.
“I asked no such thing,” Harry exclaims in outrage, probably a second or two too late, because of his malfunctioning mind.
Draco abandons his position between Potter’s legs and lies down next to him, propped up on his elbow. He pushes one of Potter’s legs up, exposing his entrance and trails his fingers through the dripping wet cleft, circling Potter’s hole with the tip of his index finger before starting to push against the ring of muscles. Potter really must have been in heat for quite some time now, because his finger meets next to no resistance on its way inside. He pushes his finger into the tight heat in one swift motion until it can go no further.
Another boom rocked the castle, and Harry reached out to steady Iana who quickly pulled her arm out of his grip.
It was obvious she wasn't going to leave him be and was likely spoiling for a fight, but he wasn't going to give her the satisfaction.
Despite that, he found himself unlocking the door with a flick of his wand. Effie peeked through it carefully.
The moment he opened the door, every one of his senses was assailed suddenly. It was a huge amphitheatre-like room, with tiers of seating descending down towards a strange rough-stone stage. On the stage was a simple archway with strips of ethereal fabric hanging over its opening.
"Do you think I cannot see through these pathetic attempts?" he asked. "Perhaps they would work on school children. Have you lost your edge, fading away in that crumbling ruin you call a school?"
"Fuck off, Potter," she said without any sign of ire. "I was wondering if we could use them against him somehow. Don't tell me you haven't thought about it."
fight Voldemort," Harry insisted. "I'm just a kid. I'm still in Hogwarts for Merlin's sake!"
"Maybe she's finally growing up?" Harry shrugged, trying to put her out of his mind. He really didn't need to be reminded just how fucked his life was surely about to become.
Indeed, in a big pile on one of the desks was a pile of dirty potions equipment which Snape had probably been saving up just for him. Cauldrons, vials, ladles and spurtles were piled up well over head-height.
"You had just started at Hogwarts," said Lily. "You were eleven. Are you really saying you'd rather have known then?"
"Harry, if you think we're just going to sit around now that we know that… You-Know-Who is back, you've got another thing coming," said Neville forcefully. He looked around at everyone else. "Right?"
"I don't think so," said Iana, looking unsure. "Something about it still feels… off."
Just what it was that Iana was thinking about, she didn't say. Harry tried asking more than once, but had gotten very little by way of explanation in return. She'd just explained that it was a family secret, and that he'd have to trust her.
. The Roman goddess Diana has long been associated with the Moon, and you were born on the fifth day of the eighth lunar month.
takes Wolfsbane every month!" Obvious bait or not, there was no way he was going to let this half-troll talk about Remus that way.
Without enough time to cast the spell to protect them both, Harry threw himself at Iana, tackling her out of the path of the thing, and saving him too into the bargain. It didn't help much. The two fragments coalesced back into one and reared back, adopting the shape of a gigantic snake as it did so. Its jaw opened wide, revealing the absolute darkness within.
He couldn't argue with that logic. "Can you cast it?" he asked.
Any further attempts to argue were quickly rebuffed by the obdurate librarian, and the end result was Harry and Iana traipsing out of the library almost at wand point. As they left, Harry couldn't shake the intense feeling of déjà vu. He'd definitely been in this position before.
Suddenly, all the wind went out of both their sails with the arrival of an incensed Madam Pince. "Enough, I say! This is a library, and no place for such foul language. Get out. Now!"
"Since you were born," Lily admitted. Harry could see the tears in her eyes, but the words drove any thought of trying to comfort her from his mind. "We couldn't bear to put something like that upon your shoulders."
"You didn't though," said Iana.
They were saved from the awkwardness by the clatter and smash of Effie's frantic return. She burst through the piles of detritus, now looking even more the worse for wear than before and stopped dead when she saw them.
She was beautiful, he realised.
Unfortunately, it refused to so much as hint at opening for him. He tried every unlocking spell he could think of and it stayed steadfastly shut.
"Well she is the bloody Girl-Who-Lived," Neville pointed out. "You don't think she isn't getting every kind of special training her dad can afford?"
Having had more than enough, Harry snatched up a slice of his toast and left them to their juvenile fantasies. As he left the Great Hall, and started towards the stairs towards the Gryffindor tower, someone grabbed him and yanked him into a partially hidden alcove behind one of the suits of armour.
In his compartment of the train, Dean and Seamus were attempting to one-up each other with tales of drunken excess from previous years while Neville sat quietly reading over some Herbology text. Ron was staying at Hogwarts as his parents were visiting Charlie for Christmas again. Apparently Mrs Weasley had given up on her mostly fruitless yearly attempts to lure all of her sons home.
The melodious laugh which followed was marred by the lack of humour colouring it. "It didn't take long for him to realise what he'd done," Helena said. "Not only had he killed me, whom he thought to love, but he had failed my mother and that, surely, was the greater part of his grief. He took his own life, there and then, and we have been cursed to this entwined existence ever since."
"Mum sent me to get you," she said. She was frowning as if that fact annoyed her, but Harry could tell she wasn't really. If she'd really been annoyed, she wouldn't have done it in the first place. "Professor Dumbledore is here, and wants to talk to you."
"Oh, she'll get there," said James with absolute confidence. "Now, who wants to take a trip down to the kitchens? It's been far too long since I last ate."
"Not that I don't think it couldn't work or anything, it's just it seems really strange, you know? If it's too personal or something, you don't need to say anything, but I was just wondering because there's lots of rumours and stuff. Sorry if—"
"So how'd you get away?" Harry asked. That had been the thing he'd really wanted to know. She'd managed to escape from right under Voldemort's nose.
"To tell the truth, I'm actually not sure," Justin admitted. "Professor Rosier was giving an introduction to the history of Prophecy. You know, how ancient societies thought of it as some kind of message from the Divine? Anyway, Malfoy took real issue with something he said, something about how some Prophecies would be better ignored or the like, and she accused him of supporting You-Know-Who. Right there in the middle of class!"
That sound was enough to draw the attention of the two battling wizards.
"Get on with it."
The Death Eaters didn't stop when they reached the bridge. Instead, they marched across it behind their master. A chill started seeping into Harry's bones, and he glanced up to see that the Dementors were starting to cluster around too. With every step Voldemort took closer to the castle, the more the feeling of hopelessness the Dementors carried with them settled over the crowd.
She smiled broadly. "I'm alive."
The long-suffering sigh Lily Potter breathed was belied by the hint of a smile that pulled at the corners of her mouth. In a vain effort to cover it, his mother shook her head. "Enough, I'm sure. Now do you want them or not?"
Harry swept up his bag and threw it over a shoulder before he stormed towards the exit. Pince could clear up the books he'd gotten out, the old bag. Behind him, he heard Iana trying to hold her ground.
that I have to fight the most powerful dark wizard in the world?" Harry snapped. "Maybe I can hit him with a Stupefy. Or maybe a Disarming Charm? I'm sure
"But if we don't understand it, how will we know what to do?" Harry asked.
of all things seemed utterly alien.
"But it's still Voldemort, right?" Harry asked. "He's still going to be out for me and my friends because of who we are."
"He's not doing his hair again, is he?" asked another voice. Harry easily recognised it as belonging to Seamus Finnegan, one of Harry's dorm-mates at Hogwarts. "How many is that so far today?"
The flames formed a close sphere, almost blindingly bright around Voldemort, but a moment later it exploded outwards, and the inferno was snuffed out in an instant.
"What do they look like?"
"An after dark dalliance?" he asked them, clearly enjoying himself even while those worryingly blank eyes looked right through them both. "Dear me, Miss Malfoy. Surely even you could do better than
"It probably doesn't mean your literal heart," said Harry.
"You know what, Potter?" Iana began. She looked tired out, but she stood her ground. "Why don't you just fuck off and play with your friends? I'll work this out for myself faster without you getting me chucked out of the library all the time."
Harry trailed behind as Iana and Dumbledore led the way. He knew roughly where the Slytherin common room was located, but he'd known better than to try and get in. His father had told him about the time he'd done so with his friends and it hadn't gone well for them, even if Sirius had looked inordinately proud of that particular adventure. Apparently, catching Snape out and turning his hair golden had been worth the curses.
"That was out of one of Lily's crackers and you know it."
"They must have had some kind of significance to him," Iana agreed. "Maybe that's what Dumbledore is doing, trying to find locations with some kind of special significance to the Dark Lord."
"Does it matter? He's dead now too."
Then, just as a serpent composed of shadow and smoke was about to descend upon them, there was another figure in the room, arriving in a column of brilliant fire which burned the serpent away.
"Can we
A great crash echoed through the hall as the falling shelves smashed into the next shelf along and it, too, started to teeter over.
were also some kind of dangerous alien, Professor Stump would have easily taken the coveted prize for Harry's least favourite teacher.
Effie withdrew the shoe which had probably left a reasonable indentation on Dean's shin. "It's Effie," she said with a menacing glare.
"You were explaining about Horcruxes."
"The Come and Go Room?" Harry asked.
the time. What if he'd hidden it somewhere that wasn't even reachable any more?
It took a moment for Harry to get his bearings as, for once, he really hadn't been paying attention to whatever it was she was doing. "What are you talking about, Malfoy?" he retorted, almost on instinct, really. "In case it slipped your notice, you're the one who dragged me in here."
Harry rubbed her back. Perhaps it should have been an empty gesture, how could he offer her any kind of comfort when he felt like he was so thoroughly without hope? Yet, as he did so, he started to feel a warmth where before he had only felt cold and numb. This was his sister. She might have been frustrating, infuriating even, at times, but she was Effie Potter, and as he held her he knew that he
"Mum," said Effie, waving her hand in an attempt to get her attention, but she was completely ignored.
Glowering, Iana said, with strained politeness, "It's okay, Professor. I can find my own way back."
"Hmm," said Lily, clearly distracted by the first question enough that she'd barely even registered the second. She blinked. "Not at all. It is an old, deep kind of magic. There are no spells or incantation; certainly no wand movements or potions, but it's still magic. No one really understands how it works, not in the same way we understand Charms, for example, but it is most certainly a strong enough magic to surprise Voldemort."
"You guys don't need to do anything," said Harry, looking from one worried face to the next. "But Dumbledore said I should tell you."
"I hate you all," said Neville.
"But it—" She paused, seeming to be at a loss for words. "It says that
Harry had never seen a human being explode before, and he would be quite content to never see it again. It was almost as if it happened in slow motion. Peter's eyes went wide when he realised not only that the curse was headed for him, but that it was too late for him to do anything to avoid it. Then he was gone in a rapidly expanding cloud of blood, bone and shredded flesh.
Even Peter, who was generally terrible at keeping secrets, hadn't given Harry anything to work with, though in his case that was because he supposedly had some kind of family emergency, and Harry had barely seen anything of him since Iana's arrival.
Seamus shrugged as if that was only a small concern. "But what a way to go, am I right?"
"Yeah, Happy Birthday!" said Ron. He clapped Harry on the back, which sent up a cloud of soot.
The answer had been "girls are mental" and the truth of that statement had only become more clear over time.
old relic that once belonged to one of the founders. It could be any of them."
Still, he might have been less useless than some of the other teachers who'd graced that classroom in Harry's time at Hogwarts.
The look she gave him then neatly communicated just how little she believed him. Despite that, she shrugged and returned to her own reading. It was some kind of treatise on the naming conventions in Ancient Rome.
"Yeah, yeah. Okay. Professor Dumbledore had some pretty bad news," he said vaguely. "But, look, it's ancient history. I'm really sorry I cut you guys out."
"Worth it." Harry could still remember the look of horror on her face when the first of the boils had burst and released three or four bees which had immediately started stinging her and her cronies.
"Exactly," said Justin. He nodded his head, seemingly oblivious to Harry's sudden panic. "Wasn't it her own father who got Professor Rosier's class started up in the first place? I heard they were old friends from when
supposed to mean?"
At that moment, Harry remembered that Effie had mentioned speaking to Neville about the strange things their parents had been up to on some evenings. He felt a flash of annoyance at the thought of her sharing his secrets, but it melted away almost as quickly as it came.
"The first I knew of anything was when we were kidnapped from the Ministry Halloween Ball." She scowled at the memory. "One minute I was enjoying myself, and the next I was in a graveyard somewhere. That was the first I even knew of the Dark Lord still being alive."
The next moment, Harry found himself in a shadowy corner of the atrium of the Ministry of Magic. Usually, it was thronging with witches and wizards of all stripes, but this time it was almost completely silent. The only sounds to be heard were the rustling of Dumbledore's long robes and the gentle watery burble of the Fountain of the Magical Hero. Most of the atrium was dark, but a shaft of light illuminated the fountain which showed a very dramatic interpretation of Voldemort's supposed final moments.
Then, there was a new sound. A tiny little tinkling noise, like the shattering of one of the small glass ornaments Harry's Aunt Petunia liked to collect. The shadow-thing screamed, and if the noise before had been loud, it was nothing compared to the hellish screeching which accompanied the Horcrux's death throes.
At that moment, Harry heard a deep rumble which vibrated through the house. He met Iana's startled gaze, and they both bounded out of the room. Effie materialised in the door to her own room.
As soon as she was gone, Effie turned to Iana. "Was that really necessary?"
"Whatever crap it was that got you into such a grump doesn't matter," said Seamus, his enthusiasm obviously buoyed by Harry's very partial thawing. "You're not even going to have to think about Malfoy until we're back to school."
The other witches and wizards had formed a loose ring around them by now, and though Snape continued to retreat, there was no escape.
"Sure you would," said Effie with a knowing smirk that had Harry making a mental note to investigate it more closely.
"But Madam Pince, I—"
Suddenly, the floor disappeared beneath his feet. It became a cloud of stinging splinters, which pierced his clothes and slashed his skin as it was blasted upwards to pepper the ceiling.
She stared at him humourlessly. "Wouldn't you like to know?"
Ron grinned, clearly liking that idea. "Blink once for yes."
She nodded, her surprise evident in the fact that it was simply a nod, not some kind of smart mouthed cutting remark.
It was Voldemort, returned from the dead.
Harry had spent a while considering the possibility that Slytherin's
"Harry! What was—"
"Prof—"
have bigger problems?"
Harry really didn't want to think about that as he had a creeping feeling she might be right. "Whatever."
"You are infuriating," said Iana as she glared at him.
She frowned for a moment, but it disappeared almost as quickly. "Voldemort has taken control of the Ministry," she said. "But it's still tenuous. Minister Mulciber was able to take the position because of Bones' death, and his history as a friend of Lucius Malfoy, but most of them still don't think Voldemort is back."
So it was a strange group in the rear-most cabin on the trip back to King's Cross. Effie had brought one of her friends, a very talkative girl in her year named Juliet, then where was Harry, Dean, and Iana.
"We shall come to that question a little later, if you would humour me for but a brief time," said Dumbledore. At Harry's reluctant nod, he continued, "Thank you. Prophecies are a tricky business, and I caution you not to ascribe inherent power to those words. However, the reason I believed it was necessary to tell you was that a young Death Eater also heard at least some of the Prophecy."
"Dad told me to go up to my room after I fetched you," she said, sounding disappointed. "He looked like he was being serious."
some incomprehensible mumbling, an angry squawk, or even a snapped "Yes!". Instead, the door was pulled open almost instantly.
"What's up with
The little Elf's ears seemed to wilt. "It is being all eaten!" he chirped sadly. "But we can be making more of it for yous."
"Because I didn't tell you," said Iana. "So your apology isn't needed."
"What do you mean?" Harry asked. They'd said something to that effect before, but it had never really occurred to him that they might already have been trying to fight the war he'd been dragged into, years before it even really started.
He knew Effie had been left completely in the dark over it all, but what had come as a surprise was that she didn't needle and prod. She'd been quiet, and given Harry as much space as he'd needed.
"Okay then," said Harry, feeling a little lost. "What do you want to do?"
Harry nodded tiredly, and pushed himself into a seated position on the bed. "That's what Dumbledore came around to say," he said. He decided to leave out any mention of the prophecy. "He's not really dead, and he's trying to return. Nearly managed it too."
"Seriously, Seamus, you had 'Lovegood' to work with and that's all you managed?" said Harry, shaking his head in disappointment.
It was as good an idea as Harry had heard, really. "Cheers, Ron. Let me know what they say, yeah?"
"Me?" Harry asked, surprised. "I figured it was you!"
He was cut off suddenly, and even when Harry pressed his ear up against the door, he could hear nothing.
"What's really going on, Iana?" Harry asked. He gripped her hand tightly, and she made no attempt to pull it free. "What's wrong? Whatever it is, I can help."
Then Voldemort's voice filled his mind.
"Well, murder maybe, but splitting your own soul? What does that do to a person?" She caught Harry's incredulous look. "I'm not saying I'd murder anyone, obviously. Honestly, you and your Gryffindor morals."
"You spoke to Iana before she did this," Harry snarled, pushing aside the witches and wizards who stood in his way. "What did you tell her?"
"Wait, was it the silvery thing in your hand?" he asked. He'd not really given it much thought at the time. He'd just assumed it was some kind of family heirloom she'd gotten off her father. A nod of her head confirmed it, so he asked, "What was it?"
A spell he'd seen a couple of times before came to mind. He'd even been the victim of it once. "
Harry sighed. "Have you told
It only took a minute or two to bring some level of order to his hair once more, and soon he was descending back down the stairs. He heard familiar voices coming from the living room.
Harry cut him off. "That's great." With everything that was going on snowball fights didn't seem like an especially pressing concern. "Thing is, I've got a lot of stuff to get caught up on here."
She may as well have asked for some kind of muggle scientific instrument for all the comprehension there was from the Elf. "A Die-dem?"
"Sure," said Ron easily. "I'll send them a letter tomorrow. Neville would have to give me what for if I broke curfew to send it now."
Harry turned to get a better look, and could immediately see what Ron was talking about. While she still looked as carefully groomed as always with her smooth, tailored robes, and striking pale features, the look on her face was an unusual one. She was scowling at something, and, even more uncharacteristically, didn't say anything when Stump ordered her to hurry up and find a seat. She had a face like thunder as she slipped into the nearest seat which was next to a Ravenclaw girl who looked far more pleased by the event than Malfoy did.
After that point, presumably, Iana complied, but Harry found he didn't care. Who was
Fire filled his view as he looked up. His hand scrambled desperately for his wand, but found only Iana's hand which was doing seemingly the same thing. He grasped it tight, and closed his eyes.
As she finished speaking, an explosion sounded on the other side of the transfigured wall. It held, but many of the bricks were left cracked or broken. Harry sent a repairing spell at it, but he knew there was no way it would stand up to a concerted attack. He chose a door at random and yanked it open.
At the very same moment, a pillar of flame materialised in the middle of the room, and a beautiful song filled the air. When the flames died down, they revealed Professors McGonagall and Flitwick, as well as both Sirius and Harry's own father.
Dean looked puzzled by Harry's dismissal. "What's not to like?"
want to run away when he found out?
"She tutors a bunch of the lower years," Neville pointed out.
"Please," said Harry. "Anything you know might be crucial to defeating Voldemort."
With a quelling glance at Iana, Harry silenced whatever it was she was about to say. It was clear that Helena had just about forgotten their presence, lost as she was in her reminiscence. It was not so dissimilar to watching Binns lecture on the Goblin Rebellions of 1412. An interruption might be ignored, or it might result in a complete change of topic. You never could tell with ghosts.
That drew a grimace from Iana. She was well aware of some of the lengths to which her father had gone to run the Charms Master from Hogwarts. The way Harry understood it, it was only Dumbledore's influence, and his decision to accept a few changes to the curriculum that had kept Flitwick in place.
Another tired nod from Remus confirmed he already knew it. "We always thought there was a spy in the Order," he admitted. "I think it's why Dumbledore" — He grimaced — "never really told us anything, but I never would have imagined it could be Peter."
"Is that all?" he asked, his mind spinning from everything he'd been told.
The days following Halloween passed like a whirlwind. Harry's promised conversation with Dumbledore left him only with more questions. Voldemort had returned, but just
"Like I said, I'm going to be heading to the library to try and work out what thing of Ravenclaw's might have been turned into a Horcrux, but you don't need to join me." Harry stood up, and brushed the dust off his robes. "If you have free time, though, I'd appreciate the help."
"Dad has been out all day almost every day, and they've been going out at night some times too," she continued. "Neville said that his parents were too. And you barely even leave your bedroom now. Mum won't tell me what's going on. What happened?"
Despite their efforts to stay quiet, Justin had clearly heard them. "She got into a real squabble with Professor Rosier in the last lesson," he whispered.
"Ah, the impatience of youth," he said. "No doubt you are thinking fondly of your bed after a long evening of detention."
As it was still fairly early, they found a cabin relatively quickly. With a flick of his wand, and a quick incantation, Harry levitated his chest into the overhead rack. He took a seat, and glanced up to see Effie looking torn, standing in the doorway of the compartment.
The irked expression on Effie's face quickly dissolved into one of worry. "It's Voldemort. He's here."
"Agents— you mean like Rosier?"
"No way," he replied. He walked up to stand shoulder to shoulder with her. "We're in this together."
"Yeah, well, sometimes we don't get what we want," Effie replied. Something about the way she said it made Harry think there was something she was itching to talk about.
They all fell towards the floor, and Harry didn't have time to do anything more than realise what had happened. He prepared himself for what would surely be a bone-rattling landing, but it never came. Instead, the floor flexed comfortably, before springing back. A cushioning charm.
If they stuck with him after they found out, Harry thought it would be a minor miracle.
"I'd rather I never have to speak to her again," he grumbled.
"Absolutely nothing." It was true, too. Iana herself had told him some of it, and Harry had his guesses, of course, but none of what he knew had come from Dumbledore.
"I'd really rather not have to work with
"All the way?" said Seamus. "The only place you're going is the same place as every year. Right to the bottom."
"Go kiss a Dementor," Iana hissed as she shoved him against the wall. "I gave you your answers. It's not my fault you're too dense to see the strategy. What did you expect him to do? March up to the Dark Lord and challenge him to an honour duel?"
"Pathetic," Voldemort spat. "
That was the signal for Harry and Effie to immediately try to follow their father, but Lily tried to block their way. "No," she told them. "It might not be safe, you should—"
Harry waited until he was out of the classroom before he let his thoughts be known.
"You told Voldemort where to find it?" he blurted.
"No more than I or the Bloody Baron did, I am sure," said Helena with a thoughtful shake of the head. "No, I believe it was the influence it would get him that he desired. He always was able to twist others to whatever purpose he might need, I dread to think what he could have inflicted upon the innocent minds of the children tutored here. It is well that the Headmaster always saw him for what he was, I think."
"I'm fine," he'd said.
Another booming sound rocked the castle, and this time there was something more to it, like a heavy weight was suddenly lifted from his shoulders.
"He's broken through," he said immediately, though he really needn't have. Lily had already leapt to her feet and sprinted over to one of the windows. Harry wasted no time in following.
It was a challenge presented to me by Seratin on DLP. I don't think he ever expected me to take it as far as I did, but here we are. I guess the answer to that driving question depends on how you define 'decent'. On the other hand, this might be the longest setup ever deployed for a one-liner lame joke, and of that I am actually rather proud.
Dean shrugged, unconcerned. "For that, we can instead talk about Neville's mum's
"What?" Iana gave Snape a look of utter incredulity, as if he was suggesting she muck out a dragon. "You can't—"
"It certainly wouldn't hurt," said James thoughtfully. "A letter to the Prophet, perhaps?"
Harry had been sent to Dumbledore's office only a couple of times in all his years at Hogwarts. More usually it was his head of house, Professor McGonagall, who dealt with his indiscretions.
Harry extended his hand to point at him. "You. You did this!"
"I think I might have an idea," Lily admitted. Her expression was halfway between a scowl and open wonder. "That impossible, pigheaded, arrogant, brilliant man."
"So is that why you're looking through all those books?" he asked. "You reckon your real name is something to do with one of your ancestors?"
"So how'd you get out?"
"Well, are they here yet?" she snapped as her eyes darted towards the top of the stairs just in case Harry was being followed.
Dumbledore halted, and stopped Harry with an extended arm.
"I might do," Iana admitted. "What about the Killing Curse?"
Without waiting any longer, Harry started sprinting back in the direction of the door. He really hoped Iana was following, because moments later he heard a thunderous roar of fire as the Death Eaters destroyed the few remaining birds, and reduced the shelves that had been acting as cover to ash.
"What about them?" asked Ron, looking every bit as confused as Harry felt.
"What the— What did you do?" she asked them as she took in the scene. Her eyes came to settle on the melted Diadem. "You destroyed it!"
Harry had forgotten that. She'd told him about how her Elf had died to save them both, but it just hadn't seemed that important at the time. The pang of guilt that followed that thought caused him to grimace.
"Did we do it?" Iana asked. She hadn't moved, still laying flat on her back staring unseeing at the ceiling
"I guess it could be," Harry said, feeling momentarily uncertain. "If it is, I'm not in on it."
After a moment of indecision, Lily nodded. "Thank you," she said as offered Harry a smile that didn't quite reach all the way to her eyes, which remained troubled. "She doesn't seem to be hurt, but she's clearly in shock so she might not be able to do it for herself. If so, just stay with her until I can get out of the meeting, okay?"
That wasn't strictly true. "I sent you owls."
"How well do you think that training is likely to avail her?" Dumbledore's expression made it clear just what he thought. Snape shut up again.
"The similarities are obvious," said Lily once Iana was done. "There is clearly a connection of some kind between them. I've never heard of two prophecies being connected like that, though." She thought for a bit. "No, maybe that's not true. Sometimes they do relate, but to use such similar wording… That's very unusual."
Out of the darkness, Professor Rosier materialised. He was a fairly average looking man. A little shorter than Harry, mousy brown hair, spare build, but the more noticeable features were his eyes. They were so dark as to be almost black, and Harry had never once seen an ounce of emotion in them.
"Enough!"
"Which means there's still two," said Iana. "Why are we only looking for one item?"
"Until I overheard your conversation, I would have assumed so," said Helena. Something about her came more into focus, as if collecting herself from her recollections made her seem more tangible. "I told only one of the Diadem's location before you. A young man named Tom Riddle."
The sound of a rushing wind, which seemed to fill the senses, even though the air was deathly still. The almost blinding flash of sickly green light which left all who saw it with a feeling of dread. And the almost complete lack of visible results. The Diadem was completely unharmed.
The suspicious look lingered for a while longer, but in the end her shoulders slumped again. "Yes. It was him and a couple of others. We didn't stand a chance."
"When Voldemort… killed me, I didn't just wake up," she said. "I'm not sure what it was, but it felt like I was back in Malfoy Manor. I was in this corridor that was decorated like the one in Mother's suites. Father never usually let me go there, but I snuck in a couple of times with Dobby's help."
The rare expression of confusion on Snape's face was answer enough, but he was never able to back it up through words. Before he could say anything, one of the Wizards nearest the door shouted.
Harry wanted to ask just how you could prepare yourself for stepping into a war with someone like Voldemort, but knew it was a stupid question. You couldn't prepare for something like that. Not in a million years, and certainly not in a few months. Besides, it wasn't like Dumbledore had told them either.
"Honestly, Mum," said Harry offering her a smile that was maybe still a little forced, but it wasn't the frightful grimace that had been his best offering for the weeks after his birthday. "I'm worried. But we came out of it alive, didn't we?"
He leaned in once more, and she met him halfway. As they lost themselves in their kiss, the sounds of battle around them melted away. None of that mattered either.
The pain was barely noticeable by now, and he reached out to Iana with his free hand to brush the tears away. Her own hand came up to meet his, and she stretched forward to meet his lips with a gentle kiss. The pain vanished completely. He looked up, and saw Voldemort standing over him, wand held out at him, a grimace of effort suffused with surprise upon his face. Harry succeeded in freeing his own wand.
"Still don't understand how he can stomach working for that slimeball Malfoy," Sirius muttered.
When she paused to gaze thoughtfully out of the window once more, Harry decided to prompt her to continue. "Where did you take it?"
"Doubt it," said Harry. Had Iana not been there, maybe he would have made a more biting remark, but he didn't want to spook her. "Is the bath ready?"
"I said I'd visit," he said as he ruffled Harry's hair. "Should have made an appointment though, looks like you were busy."
She leapt back up to recapture his mouth with hers. She paused for a brief moment. "Shut up and fuck me," she very nearly growled.
"Well, how about I see if I can help?" he said. It was really a bit of an empty gesture, as he didn't have the first idea of where to even start, but he was rewarded with a wan smile nonetheless.
Harry was more than a little confused, and it manifested in a lot of awkward silences between them during their study sessions. Silences between them were no unusual thing. They were in a library after all, and they certainly weren't there for the social aspect. But suddenly, with that single question, Iana had managed to transfigure those easy, comfortable silences into something altogether less pleasant.
"You okay?" Ron asked.
As he left the room, his mother called to him: "And see if your sister is up yet!"
"Have you seen Dad?" Harry asked him. Maybe it wasn't the most polite thing to ask, but Remus wasn't insulted.
Sirius was less sanguine. "When I find out who it was that dobbed him in, I'm gonna—"
"If Voldemort does return, and he wants to get to you," said Sirius. "He'll have to go through all of us first."
Harry groaned. It had only been a matter of time.
"Fucked up?" Seamus supplied. Dean nodded.
"Oi!" Harry called as he entered the room. "You're one to talk."
Seamus gave Harry a suspicious look. "If you could get her to fuck off just by asking, why'd you never try that before?"
idea," said Harry as he crossed his arms.
"We did," said Harry, nodding tiredly. "When the shaking started, we figured you'd have a hard time finding anyone to help."
"What?" Harry blurted. How was that connected to anything?
To sow further confusion, Harry cast a Banishing Charm at her, and the resulting flash of blue light sent her flying into one of the other Death Eaters. They then both collided with another of the shelves, setting a second domino effect in motion.
With Effie gone, Harry pulled the curtain closed once more and charmed it silent. He turned to Iana, and she answered his silent question with a shrug. He looked back at his mum.
"Come here," said Lily as she beckoned to Iana, not waiting for the Headmaster's reply. "We should get you patched up." She turned to Effie and nodded her head in the direction of the stairs. "Go and start running the bath. The poor girl looks like she needs it."
"And my heart," said Iana, seeming to be completely lost. "What does my heart have to do with it?"
"I'm okay," he'd lied.
Iana's eyes sharpened, the oceanic depths replaced with a piercing slate grey. "What did it say?"
That was as good a cover as any. "Look, Professor Dumbledore said I couldn't tell anyone what it was about, okay?" Hopefully he'd assume it did indeed have something to do with Malfoy.
"You should probably sit down," said Lily, her voice tight.
"I hid something at your house at Christmas," she explained. Understanding dawned.
She didn't argue, and bounded straight up the stairs, managing to take them three at a time despite actually being a little shorter than Harry. She grabbed Effie's hand and immediately dragged her down the upstairs corridor. "Follow me!" she shouted to Harry and Iana as she went.
Bile rose in Harry's throat. "How?" he managed to ask, his voice wavering. He wasn't sure if he was asking how Voldemort knew, or how Iana knew what Voldemort was doing. Both, maybe?
Iana had clearly not been overjoyed by the new additions to Harry's study group, but after Harry had reigned in a few of the more barbed remarks aimed in her direction by the others, the rate at which she released conspicuously loud sighs decreased back to normal levels.
Harry scrambled for his own wand and was able to disarm both the Death Eaters before they could find their feet. Then he turned to find Voldemort glaring venomously at Dumbledore and the new arrivals.
Supposedly, Dumbledore's one remaining avenue of investigation for possible hiding locations had been Hogwarts itself. It had made some sense after Snape explained it. Voldemort, as a young man, had regarded Hogwarts as more of a home than anywhere else he'd ever been. If there was a place in Britain which was significant to him, it must surely be Hogwarts itself.
"We're under attack!" one of the other Death Eaters shouted. He pointed in Harry's direction with his wand. "
my father," she snapped. Then, seemingly missing Harry's embrace, she wrapped her own arms around her waist. "But… Yes. He's dead." She slumped gracelessly to the floor, her legs bent awkwardly under her.
Remus stared at him for a long moment, before he reached out with one arm to draw Harry in for another hug. "I'm sure you did what you had to do," he said gently. He pointed over at where Lily and Effie were being seen to by a harried Pomfrey. "You all got out of there alive, and that's what's important. Don't second guess it."
