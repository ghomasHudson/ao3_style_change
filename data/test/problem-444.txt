Before he knew it (and despite his warnings), Harry was sitting down beside him in front of the fire and pulling him into his arms. He sobbed against Harry's chest, feeling mortified but unable to stop it -- the day's events and years worth of denial finally catching up to him. Soft lips pressed into his hair and then he felt Harry's voice vibrate as he spoke into the fire.
can't even apparate in or out. We set it up that way when we moved there after the war and Draco kept getting death threats."
, Hermione?" Ron screwed his face up in confusion as he obliviously took the seat between Harry and Draco. "What are you on about? And why are you all standing over there just staring?"
"G'day, Malfoy. I think it's time we had that meeting on mergers and acquisitions. Sorry, Benson couldn't be here but I'm sure he sends his regards," Sebastian smirked but there was heat behind his glare. Draco noticed, for the first time, that he was gripping a wooden bat firmly in his right hand. Draco eyed it sceptically.
"Well... When I told her that my main concern was of doing whatever I could not to hurt you, she kindly informed me that I...
"Spells that are particularly difficult and require a great bit of skill like the Patronus Charm, certain non verbal spells, and any wandless defensive spells are generally rewarded with substantially greater points," she recited.
"Yea." Potter looked out the window at the buildings and street signs as if trying to orient himself. "We're not that far from Soho which is London's biggest gay scene. Hey-- you want to go after we solve this case? I've never been myself, obviously," Draco watched as heat rose curiously to his cheeks and he rubbed at the back of his neck. "But maybe you will have fun."
"Please let him know that we're missing one of his signatures on the contract and it's paramount that he sign it in person to be eligible for any payouts. You'll be able to reach me here until morning."
Draco leaned in and kissed him quickly. "Suck cock?" he finished for him, searching his eyes. How did he
Harry toed off his shoes and then lied on his side facing Draco, smiling nervously as he stared back into smoky, grey eyes. Draco rolled them after a beat and laughed.
Harry waited an appropriately inconspicuous amount of time before he stood and made to follow, but he bumped, headfirst, into the bartender! Her tray of drinks jostled precariously and he reached out to help right her.
"We can wait at Heathrow to make sure you make it. We won't be able to go through the Ministry entrance, of course, but if we go in the muggle way and get to the closest gate, we should be able to see you two exit through customs."
She smirked, victoriously. He smiled back tersely, doubtful that he'd somehow walk away from this mess with enough celebrity intact to make good on it but, hey, if they pulled this off he'd pay for private concerts everyday for a year if he could.
Draco tried to contain the evil grin threatening to take over. "Thank you, ladies. Oh, and whatever you do: Don't mention me! At all!"
Draco shook his head. "I always thought I would because that's what was expected. But I'm so tired of living based off of other people's twisted expectations that have nothing to do with me."
She looked at him ruefully. "Harry, I'm so sorry. But I can't keep making decisions solely because I don't want to hurt you. That's why we're here right now and that's my fault for treating you like you can't take it when you haven't been that confused, broken boy from after the war in years."
"Shut it, Potter. --Thank you, Riply. Can you please make a trip to the potion stores in the east wing and bring me a supply of the basics for our travels? Also... Tell mother I said 'Thank you' for the breakfast," he added, sheepishly.
Borgin loosened his old bones and limbered his neck as the spell ended. "You two know how to play hardball," he grinned mischievously.
Harry nodded, fervently, before easing down the knickers and watching as Draco's plump cock sprung free from its confines. He shifted so that Draco's ankles, still bound by the frilly lace, rested on his shoulders as he took him into his mouth, fully, and eagerly slurped up and down his length, his cheeks hallowing as he cherished every sinful moan or cry he could pull from his love.
Harry obliged, proudly licking his swollen lips after. He smiled shyly and waited for Draco to nod his approval before he kissed his flushed and flustered fiancé, his own cock throbbing and waiting eagerly for further instruction.
"Well, I'd hold off on alerting Rita Skeeter just yet, but I think our new Head Auror might've officially just earned his keep."
aren't doing anything. You've too much to lose." He looked pointedly at Rose who had long fallen asleep on Ron's chest.
Oh-ho-ho! Well this is fascinating!" Jansen lit up with glee. Draco folded his arms and scowled in response. "So the rumors are true, Potter? You
Draco screwed up his face in disgust. "You mean that lazy sod who thought he was better than everyone even though he was subpar at best?"
"Gay? Wow... I guess I never really considered that Malfoy might be... Gay..." he said, dumbly, finding his mouth suddenly very dry and cheeks ablaze.
He kept an eye out for Filch and Mrs. Norris even though he was pretty sure that as an 8th year (and as Harry Potter) he probably wouldn't get into too much trouble. He didn't know why the idea of finding out what Draco was up to felt so exhilarating or why he was more excited for an excuse to talk to the boy than he was to try to bust him. They hadn't talked since that day in the library over a month ago and he was pretty sure Malfoy was actually avoiding him. Twice, he'd seen the three kids from the library following Malfoy around the grounds like little ducks, to Malfoy's apparent annoyance. It had made Harry smile to see even though he felt slighted that Malfoy didn't seem to want anything to do with him. He knew this meant he should probably stay away but old habits die hard and since it hadn't killed him yet...
He was surprised to find Harry's lips on his and his arms wrapped around his waist in what was, for the second time today, complete abandon -- the guards he had carefully kept in place thrown to the side as he kissed pale pink lips sweetly but assuredly.
time in three years, they weren't apt to cut him off completely, at the time. Instead, they seemed to be under the assumption that if they made him feel bad enough for being a bad son, then he'd eventually go back to being their pride and joy.
Blaise's eyes widened to the size of saucers. "Let me get this straight... On the very same day that Harry Potter supposedly got attacked, you - his supposed girlfriend - want to come out as dating a Slytherin??"
"Oh, come now! You're no fun!" He pretended to pout until he was no longer able to contain his excitement and said in a rush: "The Bulgarian Minister for Magic is interested in having Z&M International be the underwriters to fund the Quidditch World Cup!"
Harry fidgeted impatiently while he wait, his legs bouncing up in down with frenzied energy. The room he'd been locked in was empty except for the lone table and chair at which he was sat and four floating candelabra in each corner of the dimly lit space.
He reached down and intertwined his fingers with Harry's and tugged. Harry followed him over to the large beech tree whose branches lay bare because of the frost. Harry bent and brushed snow from a spot on the trunk to reveal the letters HP+DM carved into the bark and encased in a heart. He smiled, brilliantly.
Harry just blinked up at him stupidly with his mouth slightly ajar in shock as Draco finished up his Hermione-like speech, the glasses making him look all the nerdier. He didn't know what he had been expecting Draco to say, but that certainly had not been it! His mind, heart and... something else.... all seemed to be going haywire as he tried to make sense of this new information. He couldn't tell if it was getting to see this new side of the boy who had once been his enemy, the fact that he seemed so genuinely sincere in his desire to change his biases and help others, or he fact that he had decided to take a deep dive into understanding muggles but, whatever it was, it was suddenly the most heartwarming and, Merlin help him, sexiest thing in the world. Suddenly, something became glaringly hard to ignore.
"Until it came time for school, yeah, looks like. But this brings us to the point we already knew: Sebastian getting piss poor marks at Durmstrang, being a bit of a bully, dropping out and returning home to his ailing parents. It appears that he re-embraced the muggle life for quite a while: He went to university where he studied political science and business, apprenticed under a local politician, became well connected, and even started his first successful business making hand-crafted baseball bats. It seemed to be a pretty honorable affair until..."
They followed the thief through the wine cellar that Harry had come through and out onto the grounds.
he thought as the superpowered killing curses blindly richocheted off of Harry's shields with loud, thundering crashes that shook the room! Draco felt his chest rise and fall rapidly as he watched Harry be forced to be on the defensive.
"I saw you lower your wand. I know you didn't want to hurt him. And I also got to watch Snape's memories and see the plan he'd hatched with an already dying Dumbledore: a plan that was meant to protect
Draco made to point out the white feather stuck in her dark brown hair but thought better of it when she fixed him with a scolding look that would have made any man shrink. He reached for the note, instead, and was surprised to see that it was from Goyle.
pretending to hate them at the time -- be hurt in that way. I would feel so shitty to ever be in some way responsible for replicating that or making you feel how you did when they did that to you... But... Knowing how trauma works, I also recognize that there's a very real chance that I might -- even if inadvertently. You don't know what your triggers are yet and so everything will be trial and error for a while. You probably
hex you while I'm with you," he said matter-of-factly although Draco noticed the hint of a blush kiss his cheeks, belatedly, as he tried to bury his face in the potions book. Draco's mouth fell open and then he screwed up his face in confusion.
. He really wished they would just get mind healers already and figure it out! It required a lot more patience than he thought most Slytherins were blessed with to love people who couldn't quite figure out if they wanted to love you or hate you. And that's what Andromeda had taught him: To love them through the bullshite but keep his own boundaries and most of all, to live his fucking life!
He nodded, although somehow not completely reassured. He was glad that his friend was trying to understand and be open but, realistically, was that enough to withstand a lifetime together?
Harry clapped his hands, thrilled by the prospect of some real movement! "You think we might actually have him?"
Hermione grabbed his arm and curled into his side like a cat -- a position they'd grown accustomed to during nights where they found it hard to sleep on the run or at Grimmauld Place over the past few months. In spite of everything, Ron could still fall asleep at the drop of a bowler hat and sleep through a Hungarian horntail attack. It was Hermione and Harry who would stay up and keep each other company, sometimes talking for hours.
"Nothing! Really, Harry, it's nothing," she added when he looked sceptical. "It's just... I was thinking... What if I were to reach out to Malfoy for help?"
"Yes. We didn't know what would happen after the bonding ceremony or how I'd feel so we decided not to reach out and just try to heal. But this is bloody brilliant!" He lifted up the CD.
was the one who looked slightly deranged as he rattled off his list of offenses. "I'm not going anywhere!" he growled.
the family. I know that you aren't enthused about this union but we fought to keep this family together -- please, don't do anything to destroy it."
care! And he probably would have left well enough alone if he weren't suddenly so extremely fucking curious about which team Potter played for.
"Stevens, can I see you for a minute? Gains, Philips -- good job on breaking up that illegal kneazle breeding ring." The rookies, still sporting bandages wrapped around their faces, smiled and nodded ruefully as they headed out.
it was Draco's wand) that Harry almost missed it. The towering man looked stunned for the slightest of moments before he swayed and dropped to the floor like a sack of potatoes.
Harry scarfed down some breakfast (surprised to find that he not only had an appetite, but he was feeling ravenous) and then headed to class which was mercifully right down the corridor.
think he's turning over a new leaf, I would have let the prick get the axe." He shrugged, casually tossing and catching one of the counterfeit sneakoscopes that he'd confiscated during his own mission yesterday. "Where is he today, anyway?"
Green eyes finally met his and held his gaze. "You are going to be one of the best Aurors to ever do this, if only you don't let him make you fall apart."
They had agreed to let it go after that. There was going to be a traditional pureblood soul bonding ceremony which meant that there would be nothing left
"Draco, did you know that before anyone knew me as the manufacturer of quality racing brooms, I got my start making fine, handcrafted baseball bats? Made 'em from wood chopped right out behind my pops' sheep station! This was back during those...
"You know you're infuriatingly sexy whenever you pull off that 'auror extraordinaire' crap?" he asked, leaning in to nose at him, teasingly.
Draco rolled his eyes and smirked but held on tightly as he disapparated again, landing in a small clearing across the way. The luminescent peacock was still shining bright like a beacon when they looked back and it wasn't long before Sebastian fell for the decoy; A slew of green jets rained from a spot to their right to effortlessly
Harry's heart threatened to beat out of his chest as he searched every centimeter of the small room for clues. Ron was there. Voices were speaking to him. He couldn't hear them through the panic threatening to fold in on him but he continued searching because there had to be
"Draco, can't it wait? Third night this week you lot have keep me late and I've got tickets to see The Wierd Sisters!"
If Harry had expected his professors to take it easy on them or that there would be a gradual ease into NEWT revisions, then he had been sorely mistaken. With many long nights spent studying facts he was sure he'd never need and cobbling together essay after essay, the next few weeks had flewn by in a whirl and, before Harry knew it, it was the end of October.
Draco gasped and turned to Harry who'd stopped pacing. The raven-haired man wore a renewed look of determination, holding on to the new piece of information like a lifeline.
"Shite!" he said, picking up a final lone sock from the floor and tossing it into the hamper before he bolted out of the front door.
Draco didn't even have to turn to feel the concerned green eyes searching him. He smiled, wanly, and placed a reassuring hand on Harry's shoulder. Those were frightening times, but they were ok now.
In that moment, Harry couldn't explain why his heart hurt so much. It wasn't like he didn't know about all this wedding stuff or as if Draco hadn't warned him that it was all a bad idea. And it was his own bloody fault for barging in here with no regard at all for what Draco might have going on. Rationally, he knew all of this. So why, then, did he have the sudden, overwhelming urge to cry?
As for his parents... Well, Draco guessed he could count himself lucky that after the prospect of losing their son for the
He deserved death but Potter had kept him from it. He deserved Azkaban but Potter's testimony saw him free.
"Well, by the looks of those big, strong, muscles, I'd say you've clearly been working out... I'm sure you probably just overexerted yourself," he bullshited then shot Harry a wide-eyed, furtive glance and shrugged as the confused man smiled back toothily.
"Draco..." His heart skipped as he realized that he was still wearing the pajamas from last night though he had (sadly, Harry thought) found its matching long sleeve silk top. "Are you alright?"
"No, thank you, Benjamin. You've been great." Ginny smiled politely and he bowed his head before hastily walking away.
" he managed to choke out, mouth dry and cock suddenly very interested at the sight of his husband-to-be wearing nothing but an apron and a pair of light pink, lacy, thong knickers.
"While I'm glad to know where your loyalties lie, Stevens, unless you have any proof to the contrary then I expect you to follow orders no matter what you're comfortable with," Robards said as he walked commandingly to the front of the room. "Potter will face justice! Do I make myself clear?!"
be friends with Draco Malfoy. Of course, never in a million years did I think that the pointy git that I had grown to love-to-hate was going to step in and swoop my best mate off his feet, become a powerhouse for good in the wizarding world, and, in the process, become one of my favorite mates, too." He rolled his eyes. "To my best mate -- my brother -- Harry: You deserve all of the good things in the world and a lifetime of happiness and I'm so glad that you've found that in Draco. To my new brother-in-law, Draco, you still irritate my soul at times but I guess I'll let you share my best friend. I love you both. Cheers!" Draco smiled brilliantly and lifted his glass to Ron.
, at least, still does whatever it wants to," he said, pulling out his Hogwarts robes, feeling secretly very grateful for a uniform that allowed him to just be one of hundreds of other teenagers.
Draco couldn't resist and quietly rushed down the last of the steps, filling with panic at what he saw before him. There was no propositioning. Potter was, indeed, still frozen from the immobilization spell and he'd been bent across a plush looking armchair in the middle of the shopkeeper's potions room. His clothes had clearly been vanished as he was stark naked with his arse stuck in the air. Yaxley stood in front of him while Rowle braced himself behind, both men with their robes opened and trousers around their ankles. Draco felt a flush flame across cheeks and down his neck and chest.
"Either we watch Blaise and Ginny come through on that portkey come seven o'clock," He raised another finger. "Or they don't and we hop on one of these giant muggle death traps and we go and find them."
"Draco, you two are ridiculous!" he rolled his eyes. "I never thought I'd see the day: The Prince of Slytherin gone sugary sweet! He's made you soft, mate!"
He watched Lucius' wheels turn as he tried to figure out his next move before, eventually, sighing in defeat.
"Severus!" McGonagall scolded. Snape just shrugged. Harry suddenly understood that Snape probably was not the 'doting godfather,' afterall. He was more like Sirius: ornery but willing to do anything and risk everything to protect those who mattered to him. Harry wondered what it would've been like if Sirius was around during that time. He looked around at the people in the room and smiled realizing that they had all, with the exception of Penelope, played that role in his life at different points, each having selflessly put their lives on the line to keep him safe.
" Blue light shot out of Potter's wand and a compass, an amulet, and a carving knife were illuminated in various partially hidden spots throughout the room.
"We thought you might be able to make more sense of this. Maybe give us a better perspective on possible motives or next moves?"
Draco rested his forehead on Harry's and proceeded to wrap his arms around his waist, gently pulling them closer.
He took a calculated step to the right so that Harry was half behind him but, of course, Harry, the stubborn git, refused to back down and moved back into his previous position.
Theo was seething as he eyed both wands contemplatively for a long moment before he finally lowered his own, resigned.
"I wouldn't dare!" She feigned appalled and Draco rolled his eyes. He didn't really care. In truth, he was more worried about a situation where whatever Harry sent might cause his emotions to get the better of him. He'd survived the day by carefully packing away the fact that he was giving up the love of his life and this would surely force him to face that heartbreaking reality.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Well, he was starting from zero: his family was poor and hardly a significant presence in any wizarding community... He was successful in his craft but it was still inextricably tied to his former relationship, making his biggest claim to fame dating a now washed-up quidditch star..."
spewed yet he still came? Harry's heart was doing strange things that he willed to stop, at least while the man still looked liked that prat Jeffrey Jansen.
"Why else?" Harry captured his bottom lip and sucked, to the apparent delight of Draco's already half-hard cock. "Shall I count the ways?"
"My-my. Is it just me or is his head already getting bigger?" Stevens, a spry, brunette witch from his training class chided playfully.
Harry grimaced, unpleasantly. "Now we just have to floo Hermione and Pansy and have them spread the word."
"Is that why you're here this year? You were hoping for normalcy?" he asked and Harry nodded. "I know you got the Auror offer so you didn't really have to come back."
He watched as they made their way to the one long, rectangular table ahead of all of the smaller circular tables dispersed amongst the room. Andromeda and Teddy were already seated there. Teddy, all dressed up in junior dress robes and sporting purple hair tonight, spotted him and waved enthusiastically. Harry smiled warmly as he returned it. Minister Shacklebolt was there, as well, draped in royal red robes and sitting with his wife by his side. He raised a glass in Harry's direction and winked when he caught his eye. Robards' wife was sat next to them with a seat saved for the ornery old man now up on stage and saying things like
"Harry?" he asked tentatively as the room was plunged back into darkness. He didn't wait for the next flash of light, he apparated right to where he'd last seen Harry and dropped down to his knees.
Harry grinned as he stepped out of the floo and into a familiar, still grimey but slightly more friendly bar.
Draco frowned. He got that his friend was trying to help, but he didn't know Harry! He couldn't begin to comprehend how much the man had sacrificed, how much he was still willing to give... How much the world had taken from him... How much more he deserved! And the thought of Harry Potter, the man that, damnit, he still
Draco momentarily forgot that there was anyone else in the room as they gazed into each other's eyes until he heard someone in the crowd say:
Lee nodded. He swallowed thickly. "Until the very end." He raised his eggnog and they all cheersed to Fred.
He frowned down at the note cards she shoved into his hand and was about to protest when he was distracted by an annoyingly familiar, smooth, baritone voice that made him bristle.
Harry shook his head. "Seems flawed to me, too. My only guess at how two teenagers could have come to possess the thing..." He smiled wryly, making Draco become impatient with anticipation. "We were both prepared to die."
Harry pulled his knees to his chest, his own engorged cock flushed against his stomach, and braced himself as Draco cast another lubrication charm and lined his cock up with his hole. Harry gasped as he slowly began to ease himself in. Draco felt bigger than the fingers! Pain seared through him.
"Oh!" Harry jumped. "Yes! I hate to miss the feast but yea, I've got to get going!" He made a show of shouting over the crowd: "Ron! I've got to go, make sure to save me some pumpkin pasties!"
"So would we, mate! Harry, what in the bloody hell was that?" Ron frowned at Harry, Draco, and Hermione. "And why do I feel like you three are in on something and nobody's telling me? Why am I the only one who gets left out all the time?"
and, while he hated the pain Harry had known because of how he'd gotten that scar, Draco had never felt more grateful for it and what it represented: the fact that he was alive and here and had a shot at a real life full of love, happiness, and
"Well, it's not going to be easy but you've pulled off crazier things before than making a relationship work." He clapped him on the back. "Don't worry about getting other people on board, leave that to us. Hermione and I will work on getting support from the people you care about and I'm sure Periwinkle will worry about the rest. You just focus on you and..." He scrunched up his face in mock disgust. "--
"Well, then you've already lost me. Because it's either you accept that I am my own person, that you have raised me to be able to take care of myself and do what's best for me outside of your control,
Harry felt like death when he awoke: his body was stiff against the hard floor beneath him, his mouth felt like carpet, and his head pounded against his skull relentlessly. The empty bottle of alcohol lie next to him, mockingly.
But still... Harry knew he hated the UK and, somehow, it seemed like Draco was making all the concessions and he didn't know that he, alone, could make it worth it for him...
I duel with people all the time and I've been bested by people loads of times since then... Do you know how many Dark Wizards I've come up against? Who knows if any of them would have been deemed worthy enough..." He shook his head. "Granted,
Decadent smells of chocolate and buttercream filled the air as the house elves brought out an array of sweets that, on any other day, might have delighted Draco's sweet tooth. Instead, he couldn't help but feel queasy at the burgeoning bubble of panic threatening to burst from his chest.
Harry blinked back, dumbfounded. It took a moment before his eyes eventually lit up with something akin to hope. Finally, a tiny smirk curled his lips.
"Ok, move along then. -- To the side!" he insisted when Harry gawked at him, perplexed. He shooed Harry out of the line of sight for the floo and threw the green powder into the flames before kneeling onto the hearth.
"What's that big whirring thing?" He grabbed on to Harry's bicep with one hand and pointed with the other.
with Ginny had first started to become... dubitable. The London storm had matched the mood and Draco didn't think he would ever forget the torment on his usually stalwart friend's face.
As it were, long, manicured fingers felt cautiously around the rough bark until they finally came into contact with a knot in the base. He sighed with relief when the wild limbs actually shook and slowed to a halt.
She was being very rude. I don't like that, just because he's polite, people think they can speak to him any which way.
Ron raised a curious brow but answered the question. "Yea, to Astoria Greengrass. Technically, I'm invited to the wedding since I think Astoria is my second cousin twice removed or something like that but there's no way in hell my family's showing up to that elitist shite show."
Draco kept his head forward as he walked past a table where Theodore Nott and Milicent Bulstrode sat with a number of seventh year Slytherins. He felt their heads turn as he passed and, just as he was almost out of the door, he was stopped by Blaise who was on his way in.
Draco's raspy chuckle reverberated in his ear as he ducked his head to suck on Harry's earlobe and the sensitive skin beneath it. Harry really was ready to get this show on the road at this point. He writhed and moaned underneath Draco, arching up against his thigh, hoping for friction.
"Really? Did you really do that, Mr. Malfoy?" Willamina had walked up to him in awe. He stayed silent, shocked by the turn of the conversation.
She stood on tip toes to kiss him and stared up into his eyes as she asked: "You ready to go public, baby?"
The large hall was plunged into darkness but the Hand of Glory shone brightly, illuminating the scene for he and Draco, alone.
"Erhm..." Harry didn't know how exactly to describe the interaction he'd just had with Malfoy. "He was actually being... kind of... erhm.... Nice?"
They sped around a corner where a market place full of merchants and bargain hunting muggles was visible in a nearby square.
Malfoy cocked his head and raised an eyebrow as his eyes searched Harry critically for a few moments while he contemplated. Harry suddenly felt nervous as it occurred to him that Malfoy had absolutely no reason to let him in. He had made it clear that they weren't friends and they probably never would be and that realization hit him with an unexpected sadness. Just as he was bracing himself to head back to Gryffindor tower, Draco raised his wand and adjusted the wards to let Harry in. A bewildering mixture of joy, hope, and excitement lit up inside him as he stepped over the threshold.
He desperately needed to get closer. He had no idea what he was doing but he pushed a surprised Draco onto his back and rolled on top of him.
jet coming directly for him as he stood there wandless. He realized too late that Theo and the 7th year death eaters were amongst the crowd. Harry, who was dazed and confused just moments earlier, was suddenly snapped into a crystal clear clarity as he closed the distance between them, shielding Draco with his own back and knocking him off his feet. As they arched through air, he watched as Ronald Weasley moved with more swiftness and dexterity than he would've ever believed possible of the ginger as he lifted Ginny Weasley, who had been left frozen in shock on the spot, with one arm and placed her safely behind him and then turned to stand his ground; Hermione moved with a fury that was downright frightening, skidding to a crouched halt with her hair flying wildly as she too moved to stare down the jets; at the same time, Neville and Parvati leapt to join them swiftly and unquestioningly and, most surprising of all, Luna Lovegood had stopped dancing to leap into action, wearing a fierce expression he'd only ever seen her take on briefly in moments when people made fun of the Quibbler.
"Harry..." he swallowed, dryly. Harry's breath caught when he appeared to blink back unshed tears. "I'm sorry, I really don't know what will happen."
really want to question him then how about you go ahead and I can get a head start on those new leads."
Draco looked out over the wharf from where they sat on the patio of a posh little cafe. It was a nice, Australian summer day and they'd chosen to meet to discuss a possible new merger.
Presently, his life was filled with light. It shone bright through the large windows, warming the large, white, shag rug, illuminating the white and cream Parisian furniture and decor, and pooling across the white, chenille duvet pulled around him. It poured in from the skylight that let him gaze up at the blue, summer sky or catch glimpses of the passing white clouds. And, mostly, it came from the bright, shining sun that currently had him entrapped and suffused by heat and heavy limbs, as if he were holding on for dear life. He chuckled but then sobered at the thought when Harry's brow furrowed, fretfully. He'd been having fitful sleep lately, fraught with nightmares that, of course, Harry downplayed. Draco rolled his eyes at Harry's pigheadedness but squeezed him closer and planted a soft kiss on his temple, all the same. He felt quite accomplished when Harry's worried brow relaxed and a hint of a smile touch his lips.
"I don't know if it's the Christmas spirit or the smell of unrequited love in the air, but it's giving me the warm and fuzzies. Do you feel the love, mate?" he practically sung.
"Yes, teenager." He returned a wry smile. "I was wondering if you could track the floo usage from my residence on Monday morning? I'd just like to make sure that wherever he's been off to is safe, you see?"
... not because you need it... not because it excites you even, but simply because you fucking can. Look at you... won't even entertain a bloke unless he's the fucking
"Sorry about that, mate -- I hate being interrupted and, it's no thanks to this lug's bloody obtuseness," he pointed at the lump on the floor with his toes. "--that I'm in this situation in the first place! But you'd know all about that... The dominoes that you and your little boyfriend knocked over," he said bitterly as he started to circle around Draco's chair, rhythmically tapping the bat against his palm.
thing that messed with people's heads, really. In reality, Potter was just a bossy, know-it-all, git! Yea he was good, but, so was
The dull ting of a fork hitting a glass followed by the sound of murmurs and laughter stirred them from their reverie and they were reminded that they were surrounded by a tent-full of people in the garden at the Burrow. Harry laughed, too, when he turned toward the source of the commotion only to find that Ron had changed out of his dress robes into a frilly, mauve-colored dress!
Harry watched his eyes glint greedily through the slits and then rolled his own. He reached into his robe pocket and pulled out a small pouch that jangled when he shook it. Mundungus' grubby fingers reached for it but he pulled it just out of reach.
Draco looked absolutely stunning. His fitted, white and silver brocade dress robes were fashioned with crystals in the trim that made him sparkle magnificently in the sunlight. Harry couldn't help but think he looked like something straight out of a fairytale.
"Well I'm all for it! This is going to be the biggest scandal in Hogwarts history!" Blaise said gleefully.
" he said, putting down the half-eaten plate of pancakes and making to stand, trying to posture himself like the respectable wizard that he was. He cleared his throat and gestured lamely at the TV. "Teddy wanted to watch the urm..."
Harry spent the next half-hour working furiously, directing commands and making firecalls. Hermione had stayed by his side, sending out lightning-fast owl posts to anyone who might have some helpful information and letting the rest of the family know what happened. Ron had refused to sit-still and do nothing, instead, insisting on going with Jansen to Holyhead to question Ginny's team. Harry knew he shouldn't have let him go -- he had no idea how long
"Wow." He shook his head. "I had no idea! Malfoy, why on Earth would you be marrying a woman then??"
"Severus was my godfather," Malfoy began to explain after a moment. He lifted both feet up on the couch and crossed them underneath himself, angling his body to face Harry head on. Harry couldn't help but think that it was
in case. Oi, do you remember that prat Jansen from training? A class our junior?" he asked as he handed over the potion.
"Oooh!!!" Hermione squealed. "That's amazing, Draco. I could organize it and get membership and figure out how to break them up by year or topics and you can use all your psych knowledge and grounding to educate people and make it a safe space like you do for Harry and --"
So much for goodbyes. But he couldn't help but think that that was all a bunch of rubbish, anyways. Would saying goodbye in what otherwise felt like the most perfect relationship really make him feel better? He couldn't imagine it would.
He entered the sitting room and paused. Harry was curled up peacefully on the couch, the warm glow of the firelight making him look like a kid who'd fallen asleep waiting up too long for Father Christmas. Draco smiled. He lifted his copy of
"Yes, I'm going to start off in New York for the first year and see if I can get in good with MACUSA and then eventually might go to Melbourne or New Zealand, depending on how well we're doing." He actually seemed excited.
"Yes!" he said, scrambling to his feet. Draco searched his eyes. Ron just sat there, smirking coolly.
and who want to support me, if I only let them. And whatever happened today, I think it's pretty clear that I need help. It's not fair for me to not let the people who want to help know the hows and whys."
"Draco, I love you, but just because we had two passionate weeks together, who's to say that we won't be back to driving each other mad in two weeks? It would be different if you had been contemplating severing ties with your family beforehand, but to do it just because we ran out of time? I don't think it makes sense to risk losing everything just to see if maybe we could've won in overtime."
Harry stared back into burning grey eyes and took in the enormity of what was being offered. Draco thought he might lose his family and his inheritance and the respect that his name still brought him in plenty of high class circles -- all of which, had meant the entire world to Draco...
Draco's eyes widened, intrigued. He looked around, trying to imagine a young Harry Potter growing up in this place. It, somehow, didn't quite fit.
"Yes, I have them right here," Draco said, easily, forcing a smile as he pulled out a document from his bag.
Draco looked up to see him pointing at a tawny owl headed their way. He could just make out the British Ministry of Magic emblem wrapped around its neck. He quickly relieved the owl of its letter and was surprised when he saw the signature on the parchment. He read through the short message twice with narrowed eyes.
"It's good to see you, too, Kreacher. Look, I need you to find Mundungus Fletcher, again, and bring him to me."
"You little traitor," he accused her but she simply laughed and snuggled against Ron's chest. "Ok, Ferret, we'll listen. But first, why in Merlin's baggiest y-fronts would Ginny be flooing to work from you and Zabini's old flat?!" he said, jabbing his finger into the the floo report Draco had placed on the coffee table.
Harry wondered if Draco could somehow see the fissure forming in his heart because his ice melted to be replaced with something shy and remorseful.
The shattered mirror was satisfying for all of about 4 seconds before he looked down at his hand, bloodied, littered with shards of glass and already turning purple because he'd surely just broken something. And, as if the excruciating pain hadn't realized it was supposed to come until after he'd seen it:
He looked around at the loyal faces spread out throughout the dingy conference room. He really counted himself lucky to have such a good crew. He and most of the team had worked well together throughout the years and, out of the 30 or so of them, there were only a few people that he'd never really gotten along with (like that jealous prick, Jansen, whose beady, possum-like eyes were currently glaring daggers in his direction).
"Bingo. And get this: multiple players saw him receive a patronus message right before he disapparated abruptly."
"Tonight? Not Tuesday? Draco--" he said, warningly, mind finally coming out of its lust driven haze enough to catch on. "Out with it! What are you buttering me up for?"
They both had their wands pointed at each other's chest at this point and Draco was just on the verge of cursing him when the door flew open and the small room was flooded with light.
Harry blinked up at him. "Ok. I guess... I guess I can be ok with that." Draco thought he noticed him look a tiny bit relieved.
He pulled from his bag a small, crystal vial and quickly downed the purple liquid inside. Soon after, he drifted off into a dreamless sleep.
Draco smirked gratefully and pocketed the potion. Hermione handed him the coin but her hand lingered there.
Harry, if he's versed enough in the wandlore to actually believe this stupid thing exists and to go through all the trouble, then who's to say that he doesn't also believe in the lore around needing to kill to possess it? Sebastian seems the type to be very...
fucked up on so many levels, mate. And like Ginny said, to have had to deal with that while saving the fucking world." He shook his head and then looked back at him. "You do realize that what happened in the diner when we ran into Rowle and the ministry with Yaxley would have looked very different had I known, right?"
And, just like that, he was strapped back in for the ride! He wiped away the threatening tears, furiously, annoyed at himself and at this whole damned situation! He sat back down, all the same. He took a deep breath, inhaling the sweet floral scent heavy in the air around him.
?" Draco hissed as his training mates closed in around them. "Have I not passed every single one of those blasted character and aptitude tests, just like everyone else here?! Have I not chosen a path that, by its very nature, implies that I'd like to do some good in this godforsaken world, for once?! Yes, how 'bout I pledge to put my bloody life on the line every day trying to keep the world safe, just because I'm an evil bastard!"
hold your whiskey, mate. You're..." Draco thought for a moment. "On a movie set! Yea, that's it! And they really like to stay in character here." He nodded.
"Harry! Draco!" came Luna's airy voice. He gave her a one armed hug and she bounced over and gave Draco a squeeze.
being masochistic, my father thinks it's a stupid and banal occupation, my darling future in-laws are terrified that I won't be able to provide my betrothed with the life they expected on an Auror's salary --" For some reason, Potter's eyes widened and he blinked, gobsmacked, at this bit of information. "--and Robards has been determined to make this hell for me from the start. I stopped knowing whether or not this is what I truly want to do or just a pipe dream that I refuse to give up on almost a month or so in."
Green eyes stared deep into gray and Draco faltered. When he thought about it, he supposed if anyone deserved an answer to the "why" then it was probably the bloke who made it all possible to begin with.
Harry choked out a disbelieving laugh. "Oh, Draco's getting the best consultation payment he's ever seen..."
There was one minuscule little sigh before the bushy haired girl squeaked, dispiritedly: "Just a club soda for me, thanks..."
"Hermione, can't you let the poor bloke have one commitment free week?" Harry suddenly felt grateful for Ron. He figured that if he simply checked out of the conversation at this point then the two of them would bicker through it alone until they forgot all about whatever Flitwick wanted. Harry turned towards the head table to see the little wizard chatting merrily with Headmistress McGonagall. He was just about to turn back and see if Ron and Hermione had switched topics yet when he froze. Right in front of the head table, vivid as the light of day, were the bodies of Nymphadora Tonks, Remus Lupin, and Fred Weasley.
10 minutes passed with still no sign of Harry. Kamal came over and sat the basket of fish and chips in front of him.
"Malfoy! Wait up!" The two boys paused. Malfoy glanced around warily and then nodded to Zabini to go ahead.
He bit his lip when he pulled away, a useless question on his mind. He knew it was never helpful to let his thoughts go down
"The summer before 6th year, Yaxley and Rowle paralyzed, kidnapped, then raped me in Knockturn Alley," he said a little stronger. He felt Hermione's grip tighten and he unconsciously leaned onto Draco who hesitated a moment and then wrapped an arm around his shoulder.
"Draco!!!" he called out as he set off down the halls, wand clutched tightly and cursing the fact that this new house was so bloody big!
Harry's heart warmed and his breathing hitched as soft lips brushed against his. Lust quickly pooled in his groin as he leaned into the kiss and it turned into something firmer and more sure than what they'd shared last night.
discovered that the suspect did create a potential conflict to personal interest... If anything shows that someone has what it takes, it's that!" Harry blazed and Draco felt his heart warm.
The Bulgarian man nodded. "Vhen ve found her ve gave her dreamless sleep and brought her back here. He retrieved her."
He shook his head as he savored his darjeeling (the Aussies might know a thing or two about coffee but the Brits sure knew how to make the best cup of tea).
Teddy bounded over, excitedly, and Harry pulled him into a big hug. He stood and held his godson's hand as he faced the crowd.
Next update coming Wednesday. There are only 2 more chapters before it switches over to Harry's POV and since the chapters aren't that long, I think I might post them both at once. Stay tuned!
Draco laughed a beautiful, melodic note and smiled back at him. "Oh, Harry, you've never experienced a night out with the girls! Believe me when I say I've had practice holding my liquor under... unusual circumstances." He shrugged. "I figured that if you and Ollivander weren't just completely bunkers and I really did have some bizarre, miraculous claim to the Elder Wand, then it'd help to not make the bloke more powerful by giving him the chance to disarm me. Speaking of which--" Draco looked around frantically as if only now remembering the urgency of the situation. "Sebastian! Where is he?! We can't let him get away with that wand! Harry, if he could use a killing curse like that without even technically mastering the wand, then we've got a problem!"
Draco sighed as he summoned his caped cloak. He supposed he would wind up telling him sooner or later.
"But why would Gin do that? Why would she do that to Harry?" he asked, sad and confused. "Oh crap, did Harry know?!"
Draco stood and crossed the room to let the bird in, but it flew directly to Harry. The mood shifted quickly and Harry held his breath, realizing who it must be from. Suddenly, he felt terrified of what news it may bring...
The brunette grinned as the beady-eyed bloke power-walked off towards the public restroom, cheeks clinched tightly.
I've gone ahead and done the exact same thing!" he spat, frustrated. "But, right now, I couldn't give a fuck if she buggered all of Puddlemere United! JUST GET OUT THERE AND FUCKING FIND HER!" He pointed forcefully to the door.
Draco bowed his head to excuse himself, the little witch from the IMC frowning slightly as he sauntered off towards Harry.
"Ehrm..." Harry said, panicking as he realized he hadn't thought about how he'd explain that in the slightest. "Blaise told me? He's in Gryffindor tower!" he added to make it sound more authentic.
"You ok?" he asked as he planted a kiss in Harry's soft, black hair. He reached for his wand and Harry felt the stickiness between them disappear.
Ron shrugged. "I have no clue what you're talking about," he said, innocently, but George thought he distinctly heard his little brother whisper something suspiciously along the lines of "
Draco felt weak but when he looked back over at Potter, he noticed that his legs had started to twitch and his face had started to screw up in pain. He knew then that it was almost time to act. He walked over to the bookshelf and held his breath as he reached up on tip toes to grab the three wands, praying that the death eaters were too preoccupied to see either his shoes or the floating wands before he could secure them underneath the cloak.
"I can hear you, you know!" he paused his baby play to shout so that his least favorite Gryffindors could hear him in the other room.
Harry grinned widely, relieved that, at last, someone was treating him normally! "Oh, come now, Malfoy. You don't like it? I'm kind of proud that
Bill's mouth dropped in shock as he looked back at Harry and Draco as Draco was now trying to pry the cufflinks out of Harry's hands to take back his gift. "And it's been a whole week and they're not actually married yet?!"
"But those are the easy ones!" a third year Slytherin shouted. "When are you going to teach us how to conjure a patronus?"
Harry's eyes softened as he looked back at Draco, touched that he was willing to stick this out with him until the end, either way -- Even if it did involve muggle technology that he didn't understand and, thus, terrified him. Draco swallowed because he knew full well that they might have a very tough road ahead of them.
Draco joined him at his side and watched as the gold dust spiraled into the air to take the shape of Ginevra running off, gingerly, heading east. They walked over to the bigger ones and the dust formed into two familiar, hulking forms.
"It's ok. We can just two step!" he said, tugging a little harder and finally getting Harry up on his feet.
In almost every relationship and friendship he could think of, Draco was used to either being taken care of or solely concerning himself with making sure that he took care of himself. Now, he found himself wanting to do whatever he could to not hurt Harry, or -- at the very least -- take care of him when he inevitably did. He didn't think he could stay away... yet, seeing the disappointment in Harry's eyes after father's firecall made Draco think that he might try just about anything to avoid that look on Harry's face again.
Harry wrapped his hand around Draco's wand hand and didn't break eye contact as he guided Draco's hand to make the movement.
"Ok, class. Settle down, settle down!" called Professor Merrywhip. The sandy-haired wizard was relatively young, he couldn't have been more than 10 years out of Hogwarts himself. He knew the theory well enough but his posh navy blue robes and generally jubilant demeanor made it clear that hadn't been touched by either of the wars. Draco wondered how long he would last here, DADA curse broken or not.
"Merlin's beard!" she exclaimed groggily as she pulled down her nightie, still half waking out of her sleep. "What was
"What? I thought that much was obvious, Potter." He smirked. Harry flashed him a toothy grin then bowed his head towards the floor.
It was odd. Everyone seemed to expect him to have come out of it all as some brave wizarding warrior when he was still just an orphaned 18-year-old boy who'd been thrown into a world and told that, so long as he played this role, then he would be loved.
"You can take him back to where you found him and then return to Hogwarts. Thank you, Kreacher. Oh, and give Winky and Headmistress McGonagall my regards."
"All we know is that it's definitely a potion -- the lab confirmed. But still no leads on a common distributer."
I will be going hiking without my laptop this next week so I don't think I'll be able to post. That said, next update can be expected next Sunday, September 13th unless I figure something else out. Hope you're enjoying!
He shrugged. He looked like he wanted to say something but he worried his lip instead. Draco had a feeling that he was afraid to acknowledge the one thing that had happened between them that had so far been understood to be off limits.
Harry leaned against a display case and smiled brightly as he watched him move, rhythmically, eyes closed, and -- despite the fact that he was literally risking
"Muggles call it Dissociative Identity Disorder and it's a response to excessive trauma. When you're not feeling safe and feel like you have no control, it's a way that the mind and body take control and try to protect you by escaping intense emotions and literally convincing itself that you are a completely different person who's actually safe. Some people have multiple protective personalities but, as far as we know, Harry only seems to turn into Harold Pots: A student at Uni who studies psychology and plays rugby." Hermione gasped, probably connecting the same dots about Draco's interest in psychology as Harry had earlier.
Draco's jaw dropped in indignation. He grabbed Harry by the hand and hurriedly led him to his bedroom, closing the door shut right as the front door opened.
To his annoyance, Potter ventured from his side and began to explore the shop on his own, leaving him alone with the greasy git.
"Wanna Be" - Spice Girls (I didn't think through which Spice Girl they each picked but, c'mon, Draco had to be Scary Spice, right?)
"It's a large group of you so members of the DA are here to help assist. I assure you that most of the spells we learn might be easy to cast while stationary but are mighty difficult when there's an unforgivable headed towards you."
"I'll let you know about the party for Lavender and the cake. And if you ever want to join our study group, we'd be happy to have you."
Draco walked away from that tragic day with gratitude for his Auror training kicking in when he needed it, deep sadness for the lives they could not save, and a new found appreciation for his own life.
to epic proportions." He rolled his eyes, a teasing smile on his lips as he made air quotes. Draco made to protest but Harry stopped him. "No, I've enough wins under my belt to admit it: I've been shite at this case from the very beginning and that Sebastian bloke has played me like a fiddle every step of the way." He scrunched his face up in distaste at the admission.
"I find that it's easiest for me to be mindful and present when I'm either flying on a broomstick or floating in water," Draco called from the bath, bringing Harry back to the room. "Do you want to be mindful in the water with me? We really can just float and meditate if you want. You can even keep on your pants if it makes you more comfortable."
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
good) or when their overly eager waiter, Benjamin, kept popping by to ask if he could get them anything anytime there was a shift of the menu or their wine glasses decreased by more than two sips.
He shook his head. "Absolutely nothing," he said, handing the note to Ron and Hermione, who scoured over it, and he massaged his temples.
I was feeling nostalgic with the new decade change and thinking early 2000s when I made the title (you know, before emojis 😱? When people put <3s on everything? No? Haha cool 😅). Anyways, I realize it's probably not the easiest title to search so I'm going to switch it from "Draco <3s Spice Girls and Harry Potter" to "Draco Hearts Spice Girls and Harry Potter" before I post chapter 5, I just want to give anyone who's already reading a heads up before I do.
"Really, now, Garrick. Why would any of us steal from one another? These meetings have been going on for 2 centuries and our family ties have kept us all safe through witch hunts, goblin rebellions, and 3 wars--"
Harry dropped his head to the table. He'd never felt more helpless. Not only was he likely headed to Azkaban right alongside the hundreds of witches and wizards he'd helped send there over the years, but, worse: If everyone truly believed that he was responsible, then no one would be out looking for the real suspects. He
"Hawthorn wand, 10 inches, unicorn hair core, been in use 15 years, changed hands twice in that time?" The wizard at the security desk looked up at him questioningly over half-moon glasses as he registered his wand.
Draco decided on the spot, a defiant smile making its way across his face. "You know, I think we will."
Draco tucked a strand of raven hair behind his ear as he thought on that. "Harry... you do realize there are other configurations to that equation, right?"
He shook his head and then took out his wand to cast a disillusionment charm on himself before walking back out of the door.
" between them. Harry felt the now cold, dampness in his pants disappear and then Draco's hand was on his face, caressing as he searched his eyes. "You ok?"
He walked up the front steps and let himself in. This had been a second home to him since he was 6-years-old and he knew it well.
"Well, sometimes people can surprise you, mate." Sebastian shrugged. "Come on, put that down and let's go inside. You've had a shock, let's get you some more tea -- I know how you Brits like tea."
He heard running footsteps and the swing of the door. The last thing Draco remembered was sliding down onto the floor.
they shouted as Potter wordlessly cast. The thick ropes that left his wand bounced off the shield and fell to the floor.
"Bill did! Vic tried to kiss me and he told me I better stay away or else I'll get a bad case of doxy pox!" he regaled, energetically, already in full story-telling mode.
Draco looked thoughtful. "Because I'm really not very good at being the death eater everyone wants me to be. Apparently being friends with Harry Potter is the only
He pulled back to place the chain around Harry's neck and Harry looked overcome with emotions as he pressed the ring to his heart.
"There are simply more important things to think about right now." She was currently sorting through his mail from this morning's post. He had planned to simply ignore it all so he was all too glad to let her sort through it. "Kingsley Shacklebolt formally requests your --"
Draco muttered something about insufferable prats as he hurried to push himself out by his elbows, eager to be far away when the tree thought to come alive again. Hagrid's great boarhound howled from the nearby grounds keeper's inn and Draco paused (once he was out of whomping distance) to look around the grounds. The castle lights twinkled against the dark skyline and the flags from the distant quidditch pitch, waving gently in the early breeze, were just visible from this vantage point. Perhaps he would have basked in the nostalgia of it all were the moment not immediately broken by the magical bindings reacquainting themselves with his wrists.
Harry frowned down at the note and then at the owl still perched on his desk as if it were actually waiting for a response to that.
"It's looking like a wonderful night for tips!" she said with a wink as she marched off, cheerfully, to greet the strange, new patrons.
"Hey! It's a well known fact that Dumbledore was bent. I'm sure he could appreciate a little fellatio." He smirked but sat back up.
He roamed the empty rows of cubicles that made up the bullpen, pausing at the one that had been his for the past four and a half years. Gains, the rookie fresh out of training, had already started unloading his things and he scoffed at the Puddlemere United poster that now hung where his Cannons one had.
"Woah." Blaise's eyes had gone the size of saucers. "Draco, do you need backup? I'm done with meetings for the day, I can come with."
"For months I've been trying to take you to bed, now I finally get you there and you scurry away first chance you get?" He smirked and encased Draco in strong, muscular arms.
"Too late, challenge accepted!" He smiled lasciviously, lowering his forearms on either side of Harry's head and kissing him fervently.
Harry's cheeks turned a shade pinker. He raised his knees to his chest and hugged them. "....Yes. I mean...." He bowed his head and stared at his knees. "What happened 6th year didn't count. I'm not even... gay... I mean..." He gestured listlessly with his hands.
"Mr. Ollivander!" Harry said firmly, snapping the man out of his euphoric gaze. "We are not here to talk about wands. We are investigating a string of burglaries and we were hoping you could give us a bit more information."
"I'll go visit tomorrow. I'm still not quite sure of the point." His brow furrowed as he stared down at his cup. "Pansy swears that they complain to her folks all the time that I don't visit them enough but, when I do, mother barely looks at me and father gripes the whole time about what a disappointment I am."
YOU PLAY WITH HIS HEART?!! LIKE HE HASN'T HAD ENOUGH BLOODY PEOPLE TO COME INTO AND OUT OF HIS LIFE! WHEN HE BREAKS, ARE YOU GOING TO BE THERE TO PICK UP THE PIECES?!!"
In one, Zabini pretended to scowl while his mom, a gorgeous woman with long, thick, black hair showered him with kisses. Every now and then, portrait Zabini would smile wryly, clearly loving the attention.
Harry stared at him nonplussed for a long moment before it finally registered that Ron was just taking the piss! He punched him hard in the arm. "You tosser!" He laughed as relief washed over him.
"Don't worry about it! I'm just so happy that Harry is doing well and has friends who care about him. I was so glad when he was finally able to get away from those godawful relatives of his." He swallowed.
Seconds later, he was peering out into the quirky loft filled with random artifacts that Luna and Rolf had accumulated in their search for mythological creatures.
It certainly wasn't a place that held lots of fond memories. He had only even been back once in all these years and that had been...
"And he's probably the best flyer I've flown against." Draco was genuinely surprised  to hear Potter admit that. He felt something warm up inside him. "He's always pushed me to be better and if it weren't for that I probably never could've outflown that dragon in my fourth year. He also motivated me to learn how to duel in 2nd year which really helped me out later against Voldemort and the Death Eaters who actually
"Malfoy, no. There's no way I'm letting you go in there alone and wandless when we don't know if this thief is going to be there or whether or not they're dangerous."
She pulled away and stalked out of the room without another word. Draco's brow furrowed and his eyes began to sting as he stared after her. A comforting hand found its way onto his his shoulder and he turned to find concerned green eyes searching his.
"But what about --" she started, waving another piece of mail. Harry recognized the Daily Prophet's insignia and cut her short.
That being said, the second part of this chapter is all explicit smut with some dom/sub undertones (or overtones, depending on how you view it). It's also filthy because, with this being so plot heavy, there's been so little sex in it at all it's almost like I had to make up for it? Lol idk, anyways: Enjoy! Or, you know, feel free to skip if you need to cause lol um...
"Bugger. Well I do hope you feel better, mate. And sorry to hear you're batting for the other team, I was hoping I might have a chance if you needed a quick rebound." He winked and Harry's jaw dropped as the man walked off back into the club.
The house elf stood there bouncing, excitedly, a foot from where Harry lay in Draco's childhood bed. The bedroom, a time capsuled ode to the young boy that Harry had known, was filled to the brink with green and silver decor, pictures from Draco's time at Hogwarts, moving posters of fit, long-retired quidditch players that littered the walls, and a closet full of expensive, posh, preppy clothes. They both wore pairs of his old pajamas that he'd transfigured to fit them now, but they were the smooth, soft, fine silk kind and Harry couldn't help wonder what type of 16- year-old boy would even have these? He snorted, answering his own question as he gazed at the man next to him whose long, flowing hair and pouty lip made him look all the part of a spoiled prince. He zipped his mouth shut at the look Draco gave him.
Draco didn't have to look at the elegantly slanted writing to know who it was from. He was just debating incendio-ing it when he heard the crunch of footsteps on the crisp, fall grass. He didn't bother sitting up. There was only one person who knew to find him here and, thus, he wasn't surprised when Blaise Zabini came to a halt next to him and sat down beside him.
bit about me that I've been told is wrong and really not give a damn! In safe spaces, that is..." he added, somewhat shyly.
Ron gave him a nod and a salute. Draco looked at him, slightly nervously. Harry stuck his tongue out at him briefly and was rewarded with that toothy, carefree smile. He left and went to wait for Draco in Snape's quarters.
He sat up and pushed Draco so that he laid back, Harry crawling atop him so that he could get a better angle. He leaned in for another kiss, instinctively sliding his thigh between Draco's and worshipping the resulting little intake of air and Draco's cock growing against his thigh.
But then there was Potter... Despite all of his mental preparations to proactively avoid running into the man at all costs (including running through a list of all of his long forgotten evasive Auror maneuvers,
! You do realize that the longer you sit here, the greater my chances of being hexed?" He looked around again. Apparently last week's incident wasn't enough of a warning for Potter.
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
"But... Anyone would be better!" He took a deep breath and turned to face them. He knew this would be risky and stupid and guaranteed to fail but... It was the only shot he had! "Even Harry Potter would be better!"
The nightmarish eventualities at play in his head ranged the gamut from Draco being unimpressed by his tiny flat to them reverting back to full fledged, teenage fighting or, worse: Harry finding himself
. His eyes sought out the picture of Draco. He'd promised himself to have this wrapped up before the wedding because the last thing he wanted to do was to start a family with a potential threat still looming over it. Even his subconscious wanted him to wrap this up if the fact that the bloody wanker,
Harry barreled down the stairs and threw open the main door only to find Draco Malfoy, in full wizard's robes, standing in the middle of his bustling residential street surrounded by a gaggle of school-aged girls!
Shuffling footsteps headed their way and Harry made a bee line for the opposite room which he prayed was Draco's.
"Wouldn't you like to know? What I'm more curious about is what happens when the righteous, golden-chosen prat wanders into places that he doesn't belong because he feels entitled to other people's business?" he practically purred. "Huh. Looks like father's revenge might come much sooner than I'd ever hoped!"
"Don't worry, love, I'll get this guy. I promise." He smiled reassuringly but Draco didn't seem to take much comfort from his words.
"Right." He nodded invisibly and then cursed himself as he walked off towards the apothecary that the 3 had vanished into.
His wand illuminated familiar dark green walls and mahogany floors and he searched, room by room, for any signs of intruder or struggle. When he was confident that the place was clear, he finally turned on the lights and sighed as he sunk unto the rich, leather couch.
, Ron. How many times do I have to tell you, just because it happens on the screen does not mean it happened. It's just special fx."
There were laughs scattered throughout the room and Stevens, who used to partner up with Ron on occasion, rolled her eyes at the obvious Ronism.
"See, I like it when you're all confident and bossy and I trust you when you take the wheel." That part surprised Draco and it both warmed his heart and made him feel a sense of awe. How did he ever become deserving of that trust? From Harry Potter, of all people? "It's just that..."
friendly version he'd given Draco earlier was true, but only the tip of the iceberg. He still felt so guilty about all he'd put her through. Ginny had insisted that she could handle his baggage right after the war but, thinking back on it, what did they know? They were only 17 and 18 at the time with no way of knowing what exactly healing through the magnitude of that mess would entail. Being a public figure had meant that he always had to be buttoned up and put together for the rest of the wizarding world to see, to remain the strong, powerful hero that they expected him to be. Unfortunately, it also meant that, behind closed doors, that left Ginny to deal with all of his shite.
"They have us seated at the head table with you so we'll see you in a moment, Harry," she said, reaching out to tuck an errant strand of hair behind his ear.
Apparently, Sebastian had returned to the farm, drunk and irate, just as Blaise had managed to untie Ginny. According to Blaise, the man had been
"Oh, yes, nothing I can't handle, sir." He pointed his wand to his nose to stem the flow and licked at the blood. "You know, it's still awfully
Potter seemed to chew that over along with his chips, his brow furrowed in thought or worry -- he couldn't tell which. Draco pretended to turn his attention back to the case file when, really, he felt raw from the revelation.
"Wanna bet?" The man smiled devilishly, which was never a good sign. Draco cursed himself as he sat up, intrigued.
He made to reach for the floo powder again, done wallowing in the stupidity of it all with the literal reminder of all he'd lost standing right there, but Harry stopped him yet again. Draco gasped at the unexpected buzz of electricity as his hand wrapped around his wrist. Harry quickly dropped his hold and pulled away but the air remained heavy with the weight of all the things thus left unsaid.
At that moment, Ron, dressed in full, magenta Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes robes (that, ironically, clashed horribly with red hair) came marching furiously down the aisle toward them.
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
Draco sped up the pace and held him tighter. Now that they'd finally given in, it was like each clash of their tongues brought with it the thrill of flying -- no,
"Ron told you?" he asked as Ginny sat next to him on the couch and pulled out a tub of Harry's favorite ice cream from one of the bags and summoned two spoons from the kitchen.
The mark doesn't come off -- Believe me, I've tried." Potter's mouth fell open, as Draco gathered his things. "Look, Potter. You don't have to keep saving people, sometimes they have to save themselves. Why don't you take care of
"That's the spirit, mate! Do it for the people!" Ron exclaimed, holding Rose with outstretched arms so that Harry came face-to-face with that irresistible little face that now so resembled both of his best mates. His heart melted.
The door closed behind him with a clack and his mouth hit the floor as he took in the decadent gold and cream decor and crystal chandelier hanging over an ornate four poster. Ok. Definitely the right room, he thought. He was about to roll his eyes but then he glanced down and his heart clutched. Wide, smokey grey eyes were staring back at him, watching him carefully.
"Hmm? Oh yes, the whole arranged marriage, must produce an heir thing is another can of worms in and of itself." He shook his head, not wanting to think about his upcoming nuptials.
bloody wanker! "I just need to help give him a fighting chance -- a way to play to his strengths! But I could..." he paused and bit his lip, struggling to get the words out. "I could use some help."
I envision Teddy having always split time between Andromeda's and Harry's, spending most weekends at Harry's unless there's crazy Auror stuff going on. Since this whole story has mostly been about the "crazy Auror stuff" moments, I don't think that came across before now.
Draco smiled back at him, sweetly, and took a moment to gaze into Harry's eyes. His were dark with lust but Harry also saw something softer and warm reflected back at him in the pools of silver-grey.
Blaise looked around with Ginny at his side, making sure to touch anything that looked like he shouldn't touch it, just giddy to finally be let in. Meanwhile, the Greengrasses sat on the sofa next to Hermione, both looking thoroughly put off by all the Gryffindors.
Ginny finally fixed him with troubled blue eyes and she started to speak before she chickened out and returned her gaze to the flame.
"The point being that: Gin being the latest in a long line of Weasleys whose arse you've saved is reason enough to remind you that we love you and that we're happy for you, no matter what."
"Ooh, I do hope he can keep it together. It's not going to help to have a member of the DA spreading such rumors," Granger said anxiously.
Draco racked his brain. "I don't know... These families aren't particularly wealthy or well connected anymore... Now, of course, it's not surprising that a magical heirloom thief would be targeting pureblood families as we'd have the oldest magical artifacts to pass down. But it is a bit odd that none of the reported thefts belonged to any of the other 22 long lines of pureblood families that had a foot in the war, whether dark or light side..."
"For what?" he asked, voice horse and finally giving in and putting his hands cautiously on Draco's waist.
"I know, bonkers, right? Well it looks like the bloke had plenty of practice navigating the muggle world," she relayed, bemusedly, as she read from a report. "As you know, we've been baffled because, despite the fact that Thundelarra has a thriving wizarding community and he grew up there, no one seemed to know the bloke! There are some older folks who remember Krafft's grandfather as being a notable member of the community and even his father until he became a young man with a family of his own; but many of the townsfolk thought that the family had long left the area because they'd simply stopped interacting at some point... Aurors just canvased the muggle parts of town and, apparently, the muggle neighbors paint a very different picture of a quintessential family-next-door with a hard-working father, a respectable mother, and the charming young boy who excelled in his studies at the muggle school, played muggle sports, and participated in something muggle kids cult called the
"Oh, don't worry, he can't kill you in Azkaban." He gave her a falsely reassuring smile and then tugged at her chin so that her lips parted. He used the dropper to give her the recommended three drops -- and then one more, for good measure.
He was startled bolt upright when a loud banging came from the corridor outside Snape's office. He exchanged a silent look with his godfather, who simply looked annoyed, and Draco grabbed his wand.
. There was a duel, some singed hair, quite a few tears, and a well-overdue talk involved, but, in summary: we're working on it."
Ginny pushed the door open with her foot, arms full with two paper bags full of groceries, and still wearing her dark green and gold quidditch robes -- apparently fresh out of practice. She put the bags down on the threshold and stood with crossed arms and a crossed expression.
He shook his head. "I can only do that with you," he pouted, his voice small. He felt mortified that his eyes were starting to burn. Harry pulled him into an embrace and kissed his forehead.
"Thank you for giving me the choice, Draco." He reached out to take his hand and then looked out over the little town and shook his head. "I think that might just be one of the greatest gifts I've ever been given."
Draco looked around as he thought. Everyone seemed to be holding their breaths and wearing either looks of shock or suspicion. He caught sight of Flitwick and Merrywhip.
part of him as their tongues twined, sliding together hungrily. He spun on the spot and they fell into Harry's bed with a soft thud. Perhaps the first time ever that his apparition had been 100 percent spot on.
Potter looked like he was mentally trying to follow his line of thinking. "Wait, isn't today the second Tuesday of June?"
He wandlessly knocked them back (Statue of Secrecy be damned!) and jumped over the fallen bouncer in his race to find Draco. His pulse stopped when he threw open the door to the mens restroom only to find it empty with what looked suspiciously like blood on the floor.
Severus was right, of course. He had firecalled his mother that first day. At first, she insisted that he leave Hogwarts immediately and join her in  the South of France. When he refused, she reassured him that she did not expect him to take on Lucious' causes ever again and that anything that happened to him would be his fault, not Draco's.
--" He cleared his throat and made finger quotes. "'Sounded like a narcissistic prick for assuming that I alone can protect your feelings and there are already a shite load of people who have made life changing decisions on the behalf of Harry Potter without ever consulting Harry Potter and that
"So very curious... I wonder..." His black eyes peered intently into Draco's as if searching his very soul.
She and Bill rubbed noses and kissed while Ginny, who'd just come over with Luna, pretended to gag. She looked to George inquisitively.
Harry was reminded of all the tragic feelings of love and loss he had experienced when he'd first listened to this song and thought of Draco. He'd thought it'd aligned perfectly with the situation, at the time, and Harry's refusal to accept that a love that strong could ever die. He was so eternally grateful to find out that he had been right.
"What does it matter, Potter? It's too late." He shrugged, deftly walking backwards towards the brick wall.
"The thought to kiss a bloke has just never even popped into my mind! But that's cool, Draco. I bet it's easier for you because you and your boyfriends like to play with all the same toys and play the same make-believe games," he rationalized and Draco chuckled. Andromeda coughed into her cup. "Vic always wants to play girly stuff I don't want to play! I think about kissing Vic, you know... If I wouldn't get Doxy Pox, that is!" He added in a rush, scratching at his arm sheepishly and the blush creeping adorably to his cheeks.
Harry reached up and caressed his face with his hand, cherishing the feel of the soft, pale skin against his and the way Draco leaned into the touch.
"And bring them back to us, alive." Ron reached for his hand and then, at the last minute, pulled him in for a half hug, clapping him heavily on the back.
"What?!" he asked, baffled. But then it clicked. He turned wide eyes towards Harry who slowly donned a similar look of comprehension.
days at Hogwarts." His jaw dropped and she smirked. "He loves you, too, dear, and he's proud of you."
What's the point of a post day if there's not so much as one mention of Draco in the chapter? I simply can't have that ;-). Thus, you get two chapters today. I'll post the next chapter tonight after I'm done with work :-). Hope you're enjoying!
Grozdan suddenly looked a tinge green but the guard simply swallowed as Sebastian trained his wand on him in warning. Sebastian turned back to Draco and smiled cheerily.
to talk about it... Andromeda would probably curse him to Hades if he flooed in and woke Teddy at this hour.
! I think I've officially lost all pride at this point. What's a couple of grass stains?" he said wryly, popping another lemon drop and passing the bag to his friend. He felt eternally grateful that Blaise had decided to return, too, his only real friend from Slytherin to do so.
"I get it! I get it! I swear to Merlin, if one more person tells me how stupid or disgraceful or undeserving I am to be friends with Harry Fucking Potter today I'm going to lose it!" And he stomped off leaving Blaise gaping speechlessly behind him.
"I think... I think Ollivander freaked out and wanted me to see if I could still use your wand that day to see if we could both truly be possessors of the same wand..."
She was the one who was left to talk him down from his rage at the world or to pick him up off of the floor after his many alcoholic benders or to force him to go and see a mind healer when he started to give up hope. She stood by him when he had decided to open his center for children affected by the war and entertained his need to get the fuck out of the wizarding world every now and again.
His parents had nearly lost it. They worried half to death and desperately tried to get him to come home and stay there. But when the dust settled and he finally made it back to the UK a week later, it wasn't to their home that he went first.
"I haven't the foggiest, but I do know one thing..." she said, grabbing a handful of cocktail menus.
Harry rubbed at the back of his neck, sheepishly. "About that. Apparently I'm bisexual. According to Ron and Hermione, I have been for some time." He shrugged.
amount of time. Selling stolen goods, hindering an investigation, and who knows what other godawful and
"Miss Alexandra said that it has been arranged. Master Draco's associate has agreed to meet in one hour and Riply wrote down the address!"
"I saw, it looked like you were having a fit. Let's just take a breather for a minute." He stood directly in front of Harry and stared into his eyes. His pupils were too wide, making them look more black than green. "Let's just take a few deep breaths together. Do you know how to breathe with your diaphragm? You just inhale and exhale slowly with your stomach."
"I have no idea..." he said breathlessly, unable to take his eyes off of the gorgeous man before him.
secretly in love with Harry Potter, and there were a chance that he might be too, I'd say you've got one week before the ceremony..." She shrugged.
"What? I thought it was high fashion?" he said, examining the silk sleeve of his black and gold patterned shirt that simply felt marvelous on his skin! It was loose fitting in a way that accentuated his lithe lines and cut in a deep v that showed a hint of the fine blonde hair on his chest. He also wore black fitted jeans and suede loafers that he thought made him look very high class muggle.
We're almost done! I tried to bring some things back full circle, what did you think? There's only one full chapter left (unless I decide to break it up again, in which case I'd try to do what I did today and post both on the same day). I also haven't decided if I'm going to write an epilogue but, then again, when have I not written an epilogue on a long fic? Ok, there may very well be a short epilogue. If so, sorry in advance if the chapter count goes up again!
"For months I've been trying to take you to bed, now I finally get you there and you scurry away first chance you get?" Sebastian smirked and encased Draco in strong, muscular arms.
"Hmmm... That's good to know, buddy," he said as he summoned Teddy's things and headed to the front of the room where Andromeda was already waiting.
"Blaise, please tell me you're not seriously fantasizing about a lifetime of creepy ginger holidays and little Weasley babies." He cringed. "Anyways, isn't she dating Potter?"
Not for the first time was Draco regretting his drunken conversations with the man. He was usually pretty tight lipped but, somehow, conversation always went back to Harry Potter when he was pissed. He supposed it felt ok because, as an Australian-born wizard, Sebastian had no real idea who
"Ah." He smiled, sadly, thinking how unjust it felt that two teenage boys, at opposite sides of a war, had been put in positions where they'd so graciously accepted death and thus been deemed worthy of being its master. He was left with only one question: "So, what happened to the wand?"
"I think about what it would be like a lot... To have you inside me and it be different... Gentle." His dick jumped against Draco's and he heard Draco's soft intake of air. "But I think it's also what terrifies me the most in all of this."
Draco made haste to leave the potions room as soon as they were dismissed. He had a free period now and he was hoping to avoid the questions that were sure to come from his fellow Slytherins. But alas, he'd have no such luck.
Malfoy frowned. "Who cares what everyone else wants? You're finally free to live your life for you, why are you so afraid to do it?" Harry stared into his tea. He didn't know how to tell him that he'd lived a life where he was unloved and unwanted before and that he feared that loneliness more than anything.
He swallowed. He'd been on the verge of doing the obvious for days now but Hermione's warnings still rang loud in his mind. She nor Ron would approve and Draco... Well, he didn't want to worry Draco. And besides, he'd be doing it
"Yea." Ron looked up with red eyes and swallowed thickly. "I wonder how long it's been stuck there, you know? And, thank Merlin for that because it means she isn't..."
you'd be jealous of that trainwreck of a marriage." Not to mention the fact that his ex-wife had re-married to a Yank
"Shut it, Malfoy. Look..." He thought about it for a moment. "I'll tell you how I knew you were here if you let me in."
"No, your Great-Grandfather, Henry, was too outspokenly pro-muggle during his seat on the Wizengamot to be considered and there was some speculation about possible muggle ancestry." If he weren't mistaken, he was quite sure that Potter looked proud at this news. "The Sacred 28 is a list of the British families who were still considered
"Draco..." It sounded like a prayer on his lips and Draco needed to see him. He lifted his head and stormy grey eyes, dark with lust, sought green as he picked up a steady rhythm. He watched, transfixed, as Harry seemed to unravel beneath him. It was a magnificent sight -- beautiful, really -- to watch Harry dissolve into raw sensation and emotion, his head thrown back, his breathing hitched, mouth agape, but his eyes refusing to leave Draco's. He couldn't help but smile, lovingly, knowing that it was ok because he had the power to meticulously piece him back together, piece by piece.
-- he gets owled a letter, meant for him, laced with the same potion properties from the completely unrelated case when he has the cure right on hand?" He quirked an eyebrow, challengingly.
Harry followed his lead, his stomach visibly moving in and out slowly as he breathed in deeply. Draco watched as the pupils gradually retracted just enough that he could see the sadness and fear that Harry was running from. At that, his breathing hitched and his eyes started to dilate again.
Malfoy's eyes widened in surprise and then a sly smirk spread across his face. "I'm trying to turn over a new leaf, Potter. Besides," he said, glancing around vigilantly again. "I'm pretty sure there are rules about you consorting with death eaters."
"That's just it! We have absolutely nothing more than theories and speculations but not an ounce of proof! Yet, somehow, this case has been pushed through to the Wizengamot at a speed faster than I've ever seen! We all know Harry -- and Robards probably knows him even better than any of us! So why, then, isn't he fighting to make sure we cover every possible angle on this?" Stevens pressed.
Draco fell into a rhythm as he rocked his hips back and forth slowly, his breath hitching as he found his stride. Harry moaned as the burn started to dissipate and turn into pleasure, his cock twitching between them. He was just considering trying to see if Draco would let him reach for his cock yet when Draco switched the angle and he felt
"Well, that won't hold long! Come on!" he said, reaching out to grab Harry's hand with a hand that was too slender and pale to belong to Jansen.
"And then ask the stupid arse question that's going to light the spark and fan the flames," Lee added, matter-of-factly.
was a test of speed, skill, and instinct that had been known to throw even the most adept witch or wizard for a loop. It was a brilliant idea on Harry's part, really, seeing as how the simulation only ended once the suspect was apprehended which ensured that, even if they failed, miserably, then Sebastian would forever be trapped inside and unable to wreak havoc on the real world. And, technically, he and Harry
Harry didn't care what issues they might've had, he couldn't fathom the idea of Ginny being hurt or held hostage somewhere and, the thought of her not coming home to them... He shook his head in resolve.
He scanned the rest of the map. The Grey Lady and the Bloody Baron were having a rendezvous near the library. Filch seemed to be asleep but Mrs. Norris was on patrol in the third floor corridor. His eyes scanned down the map to the dungeons and he was surprised to see the moving dot of none other than Draco Malfoy. What was even more surprising was that he was in Snape's old quarters!
Draco rolled his eyes but gingerly placed his hand in Potter's, all the same. Potter examined the damage with a soft expression that Draco rarely saw. Hogwarts may have been long over but training had only amplified their competition in a different way. They were never quite as vile to each other anymore (he being a proper wizard who respected life-debts and Potter the annoying goody-two-shoes that he was) but, still, challenge always hung heavy in the air between them that was only fueled by the opposite and extreme expectations people had of them. As such, he was used to snarky, arrogant bastard Potter or smug, super Auror Potter. Now, the green-eyed man was being oddly gentle and it was... slightly unnerving...
He took a deep breath and strengthened his resolve as he let his feet carry him over to her. Her back stiffened visibly but she didn't turn around when she heard his approaching footsteps on the pebbled path.
The kids all gasped. He had everyone's attention, and Draco realized belatedly that he was holding his breath, too.
Harry felt the heat rush to his face and neck. Why people liked to underestimate his best mate always baffled him. Ron had the impeccable ability to cotton onto things quicker than anyone he knew (besides Hermione, of course) and it made him an excellent Auror. Granted, he had a habit of posing his theories in ways that sounded so ridiculous and nonchalant and easy to discount that even Ron didn't believe them, himself, half the time. But, as usual, this time he had been right on target.
Ron waved his wand and summoned a flask with a foul smelling, mudlike substance inside. "Not when you've had to use it to save your life in a pinch as many times as we've had. You learn to keep the stuff brewed and on hand
which subsequently made him want to roll his eyes at himself. "When things were getting really bad here last year, he adjusted the wards to only allow him and I access. He was in the headmaster's quarters and he knew I would be under scrutiny from both sides and wanted me to have a place to escape all the chaos." Harry raised an eyebrow. He had come to appreciate the complexity of Snape ever since viewing his memories but the idea of him being a doting, caring godfather just seemed unreal. At least it helped explain all the special treatment Malfoy got in potions over the years, he thought. "I'd come here to hide away or study."
to protect my customers and their privacy so I did not ask any questions with respect to her identity."
"The only problem was, Snape wasn't the true possessor of the wand because Dumbledore had been bested
Let's just say that Astoria was not pleased to find out that he'd fudged their sacred soul bonding vows on their wedding day and that Draco was about as sexually attracted to her as a three-legged goat. They tried to make the whole heir thing happen for their parents' sake but each attempt required copious amounts of alcohol, a certain Janet Jackson song, and a lot of imagination on Draco's part of a pair of green eyes and the ghost of a whispered
"I don't know, sir. Maybe when you're raised to impress unimpressible homicidal maniacs it's hard to think up a whole lot of joyful moments. But -- and again, I don't know -- did you ever think about the fact that Potter just died 5 months ago and watched a lot of other people do so and not come back to life? And, you know, that he might not be feeling all that happy at the moment, either?"
Draco focused on eating, mindfully savoring the taste and texture of each bite in an attempt to stay out of his worried mind.
As far as he knew, the attacks had stopped when he got arrested. Clearly, they had been a ploy in this guy Sebastian's set up plan, which was... just plain sick, quite frankly.
That was it. Harry clinched around him erratically as his cock pulsed and shot thick ropes of cum across his chest and abdomen.
Draco smiled -- not in the smug way that he usually did but it was toothy and unguarded. "I mostly came back because I know that if I get accepted I'm going to be a giant squid out of water in the muggle world and I figured I could use all the muggle studies I could get. Plus, I figure if I can get enough NEWTS, I can simultaneously do an internship at St. Mungos and maybe become a healer." He shrugged.
"Draco, didn't I already tell you that I don't need your hand, I just need your brain?" He smiled remembering the exchange from yesterday. Draco smiled wanly, too. "You lied to your father instead of going all rogue Gryffindor for the same reasons that you apparated instead of shooting in that simulation yesterday and the same reason you donated all that money to the center anonymously instead of publicly." Harry knew that Draco could've used the whole thing as a publicity stunt in search of public redemption. Who wouldn't in his position? But Harry respected that he'd avoided the controversy and media circus that would've distracted from truly helping the kids. It was
Mere moments felt like ages before the curse let up. Draco grimaced as he pushed himself onto his feet and spit out the blood drawn from biting his tongue. "I thought you preferred the muggle methods?"
only for it to turn out to be a seven bedroom, five bathroom, four sitting room home complete with a media room, an English garden, and a winding grand staircase. He'd tried to argue then about unnecessary extravagance but Draco, the consummate salesmen, had rattled on about needing space for Teddy and children of their own and plenty of outdoor space so that they could play seeker games and wanting a room far enough away from the floo and magic bits that it could have a tv like Harry's old muggle flat and... Needless to say, Harry had walked away from the conversation with a huge new home and Draco seeming to have done the impossible, as he did every day: Made him love him even more.
there's nothing you can say to make me come home." Draco laid back, kicked up his feet, and summoned the bottle of French wine that Pansy had just sent him from Paris.
"I did but I had to turn back around. Emergency." He shrugged in response to the questioning looks. "Hey, was Sebastian in the audience tonight?"
He summoned robes, shoes, and a quill mid dash as he ran back to the little owl, heart beating out of his chest.
"I think we both know there's more to the story than that or I don't think either of us would be sitting here right now."
"Oh, hello there!" called a tall Indian man that he had noticed behind the counter earlier. "You're a friend of Harry's, right?"
"It's the wand! I didn't win it!" He tried again before finally throwing the pointless thing across the room in frustration.
Mother's cold shoulder and father's condescending barbs about his divorce from Astoria were only part of the reason he avoided not-so-merry ol' England like the plague, however. The other, green-eyed reason was a little more complicated and had the potential to open up a much larger can of worms.
"Yea, it'll be fun!" Potter smirked. Draco sighed, resigned. "Well... we'd have to wait until the quidditch pitch has finished growing back out or Madam Hooch will have our heads! So maybe in the next month or 2? I'd also better run it by McGonagall first and make sure she's alright with it," he contemplated while the children bounced up and down in excitement
"Mr. Potter," came McGonagall's stern voice as they entered the office. "I was not expecting an audience for this meeting."
bent. He couldn't be... Sure, he had felt the magic flowing heavy and tense between them all day but... things were always intense between he and Malfoy! Besides, they were wizards which meant that surely there had to be some complex, magical, mythic explanation for it, right? That's how most things worked in his life!
Draco leaned in and kissed him, swallowing every moan as he continued to thrust until Harry had fully rode out his orgasm before he found his own release buried deep inside his fiancé.
"Oi, you ok, mate?" Ron asked as they left the Ministry in search of good curry come lunchtime. "You got stunned three times during a drill that you've literally done with your eyes shut before! What's got your knickers in a twist?"
His eyes narrowed. He was just about to ask what in the bloody hell that was with Zabini when a photographer interrupted.
"I wish it were funny at the time." Lee shook his head solemnly. "Fred and I just looked at each other for a long moment with our faces screwed up, wheels turning madly. I might've never even accepted that I was bent, would've just chalked the fantasies I had every day up to natural teenage curiosity if it weren't for the fact that he was a bloody twin and I couldn't think of a rational reason why I didn't also have the same thoughts about George -- no offense, mate!"
"Draco, shouldn't you be busy with wedding stuff? The ceremony is in what?" Harry did the math. "A little less than 18 hours?"
And that's when the tears came. And then the flat out drunken sobbing in the middle of a muggle gay bar in Soho, London.
Draco and Narcissa disapparated on the spot and Harry turned to face Andromeda who was watching him with a raised eyebrow.
Draco looked away as he felt his heart ache. That day now felt bittersweet when before it'd just been bitter. For Draco, it had always been the day that Harry had chosen Ron over him but, for Harry, it meant so much more. It was the first time he felt true connection and gained a real family.
"Do you know how beautiful a sight this is?" he said, finally reaching out and massaging Harry's bum. He let one finger slide teasingly down his crack before gently tickling Harry's balls. Harry took a deep, steadying breath, feeling incredibly aroused though extremely nervous.
Blaise grabbed his arm again. "You look fine. No one is worried about how you're dressed. Come on, I'm hungry!"
"Wait, let me just get some owl treats then you can distract me all you want," he said suggestively as he quickly relieved the owl of her post and turned to head back inside for treats. He stopped short, however, when he glanced down and caught sight of the moving picture on the front page.
Draco pushed him through the door and Harry's jaw hit the floor as he took in the large lounge complete with a plethora of comfortable looking lounge chairs and quaint little fireplaces, a fancy dining room and bar, and signs pointing to a spa. He sighed and then shook his head lovingly as the ridiculous man beside him smiled back at him, triumphantly.
"Wait a minute!" Harry shouted after him when he finally took stock of his surroundings. "Draco, did you apparate us to Kamal's?"
Ron screwed his face up in revulsion. "Do you know how bizarre that is? I mean, even I can admit he's not nearly as big of a prat this year but he's still Malfoy," he said through a mouth full of eggs.
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
Harry merely rolled his eyes and dragged Draco over to a vender cart where he'd spotted a baseball cap and a black wig.
"Aha! Your floo was used once that day from your flat in London to a stop in Holyhead but... Oh, this is peculiar... it immediately changed course and redirected to a muggle inn in Surrey." She scratched her head.
" Harry frowned at his side and stepped forward, fists balled in lieu of his wand. Lucius gripped his wand tighter and Draco put out an arm to stop Harry. Harry didn't understand his father's dance and his Gryffindor bravado might quickly turn the situation on its head.
Side note: Oh my goodness, I cannot believe it's been six months! Sorry for the wait! Seasonal depression is a bitch, but with springtime and sunshine comes new inspiration! Thank you to those who've left comments in my silence because your support is what finally got me to revisit this series so, again, thank you!!!
The muggles at gate C68 -- preparing to board their 7:15pm flight to Chicago with stops in Toronto and Montreal -- gave very little consideration to the two men sat staring straight ahead, un-movingly, at the blank stretch of wall half hidden by an old shoe shine booth. Nor did they pay any attention to the fact that, every now and again, that blank stretch of canvas produced a man or woman dressed in robes or a cloak who did their very best to inconspicuously join the throng of travelers. They
"Well the way he searches your eyes and pays attention to your body language is sort of like he looks at you like he's studying a potion, paying attention for signs that he needs to adjust the temperature or add or change an ingredient. It's clear he really cares about you. He's even willing to put everything on the line when it comes to making sure you're alright, and I can respect that."
"Yes, very," he said, breathlessly, resulting in that sweet smile on Draco's lips again. "Will you get on with it?" he teased, trying not to betray his nerves.
Draco was on his feet in seconds and ran right past the woman to shamelessly wrap his arms tightly around Potter's shoulders and bury his face into the crook of the man's neck. He didn't even care when tears began to roll down his face and land there.
Harry took his time and slowly followed the instructions, beads of sweat forming on his head as he concentrated. Everything was going fine up until step 7 when, instead of his potion turning red, it turned a swampy green! He sighed, realizing he still had 10 more steps to go.
Funnily enough, it was born out of trauma. Harry and I have both experienced things as teenagers that we never should have experienced -- that we should have been protected from as children but instead were thrust into because of the roles that people needed us to play. We had many parallel traumatic experiences, just from different sides of the war. And every time our different sides would clash in some big, horrible way, instead of doing each other in, we'd wind up saving each other's lives. Neither of us would have dared say it at the time, but I think we'd both recognized that what the other was going through was unfair and were secretly rooting for each other even though we weren't supposed to.
articles calling me insane?!" he asked, incredulously. "I think I can take it," he said, smugly, taking Draco's hand in his and watching the funny stares start to unfold already around them.
instead of just having sex. And he vividly remembered Draco Malfoy dancing to the gayest Madona song of all time in his little arse muggle apartment!
"What did that prick want?" Ron asked, struggling to push his and Hermione's trunks, topped by Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon, into the cart a moment later.
Harry, who looked a bit emotional himself, whispered something in her ear and he saw understanding flash in her eyes. She reached out to touch his arm one more time. "I'll see you inside in a moment. Harry tells me you like chocolate and I've got a chocolate cake going that's just about ready."
Harry smiled wryly when Draco held up a pinky finger. Harry wrapped his own around Draco's at the same time that their lips locked to the sound of more than a couple of wolf-whistles from his family.
He waved the door open with his wand and rolled his eyes as the owl flew away, its wings stirring the papers on his desk as it went. He rubbed at his temples and returned his attention to the two officials from the Australian MLE.
"I have to admit, I am conflicted. I've never seen anything like it! For you two to have wrapped this case up so thoroughly in less than eight hours..." Robards shook his head in disbelief. "It's unprecedented! But then to find out that the thief is your bride to be?! Do you know how that could have compromised the case and our department?!" he yelled, turning red in the face. "It's just further proof that you're a liability, Malfoy!"
He was left speechless, however, when Draco dropped down to one knee and, waiving his wand, summoned the chain from over Harry's head.
Draco frantically felt his face with hands too cold and clammy to be dignified, in a move intended just as much to make sure that all of his parts were back sorted as it was to confirm that he was, in fact, still alive! He placed a hand over his chest, hoping to still the heart now threatening to beat out of his rib cage and turned wide, grey eyes to the man standing beside him in the alley he'd apparated them to.
He frowned as he looked out around them at the state of mother's garden. It was usually his favorite place in his childhood home -- the one part of the manor that still felt untouched by all of the...
!" He was seething. But then he felt his eyes burn, bitterly. "Or why, when you lost the baby, I didn't know whether to rip my own heart out and bury it or just feel relieved to not have to guess."
Before Harry could protest, Draco had already made his way over and was confounding the unsuspecting hostess.
"Then I graciously accept your bribes of sex and food," he said, kissing him sweetly. "And besides, turns out I owe you for your brilliant consultation."
gotten over yourselves and got on with it, I must ask that you not be so brazen in my infirmary." He and Harry gaped at each other in astonishment and then Harry smiled the most breathtaking smile and he couldn't help but do the same. "Mr. Potter, if you would get out of my patient's bed, I have a few final checks to do before Mr. Malfoy is free to go."
Harry hovered nervously outside of the terraced home on the quaint little block on Elderberry Road. He'd taken the tube instead of apparating directly in the hopes that the nearly hour long ride from the ministry would give him time to think up
Harry looked fierce but focused as he took off following the gold forms and their shining footsteps.
"Me, too. I heard you were the youngest Slytherin seeker and I want to get on the team in my second year, too," said Willamina, haughtily.
"Well, I don't buy it!" Walden frowned angrily, his arms crossed in disagreement. "My family was on the run for a whole year because death eaters wanted to kill us! My mum's a muggleborn..." He looked down at the floor.
This is where Potter would usually interject with something rude about father but instead, he just stared back with patient green eyes.
"Congratulations, you two," Parvati whispered with a wink and then said louder for the onlookers: "Glad you're both ok then! Oh, and Lavender's party is this weekend. Harry, did Draco tell you that you two are going to be in charge of making the cake?"
"I'm sure hell is lovely this time of year, but, I think I'd rather go for some fish and chips instead, quite honestly."
"I don't even have casual sex with girls! And you want me to... to flip my whole world upside down and lay myself bare just so you can have one night of fun?!" He was fuming.
He had been worried that he might be restless sitting behind the desk instead of out in the field but piecing together possible leads for the Warbeck case and managing individual things that came up for his Aurors had left him too busy to even dwell on it. It wasn't until half past one when Anavi knocked on the open door of his office that he realized he'd been going nonstop for five hours.
"And Ron," he said, pushing his bewildered friend forward. "Just follow our lead and sing the chorus at the top of your lungs."
"Shhh!" Harry practiced noting his irritation and letting it float by like watching a wave from the sand. He cracked one eye to see Ron staring down at him warily from the couch before closing it again. "I'm meditating."
"Shit! You were right, Rowle!" The approaching footsteps stopped next to him and a bulking man with a brutal face appeared in front of him, eyes flying wide as he searched out the scar. "It really is Potter! Let's alert the Dark Lord! We shall be rewarded greatly for this!"
There were gasps all around the hill and Harry found himself breathless as he beheld the man fated to be his forever partner.
Harry dropped the tatty old shoe that had been his portkey and blinked back, in absolute astonishment, as he was met with a chorus of cheers from some of he and Draco's closest family and friends. The Weasley clan, his core team (minus Jansen, who, last Harry checked, was currently facing investigation surrounding a possible leak of classified information to the tabloids), Draco's friends from Australia, their closest friends from Hogwarts... They were all there! What surprised him most, however, was
Harry gripped onto Draco tightly, with both hands, feeling faint with anticipation. He needed to see that she was safe for himself, with his own eyes!
Harry fell forward and started to push himself up. Draco walked around the back of the chair so that he'd hopefully be slightly out of earshot but still close enough to cover Potter quickly. He silently prayed that there'd be no way to trace him while using a different wand and pointed Rowle's wand from underneath the folds of the cloak and aimed it at the corner of the room furthest from their exit.
"I just need to know what type of accent. You said there was a man and a woman, can you tell me what type of accents they each had?"
Draco did smirk at Harry's attempt to use his own words against him but it faded, turning rueful. Darkened grey eyes stared into green and Harry watched the intricate battle of heart and mind at war behind them. "Harry... Are you sure?"
"Ooooh! You know we've got you sweetheart! Don't worry, we won't let him leave our sight until he is thoroughly pissed and distracted."
Harry hung his head. He had no answer. He hadn't been just a crappy husband but a shitty friend, to boot.
you don't know every damned thing? What's the matter? Not so fucking brave outside of your bloody owl posts?!"
Potter licked his lips and looked around the room briefly before saying respectfully: "Thank you, professor, but I'd rather not."
Blaise stopped and pinned him against the wall. "You look fine, trust me," he said as he licked up his neck to the soft part under his ear.
Draco had every intention of refusing except Potter looked adorably excited and -- oh, good grief! When on Earth did he start thinking of Potter as
"Ok, I'll say it for you: 'I know how to follow directions, you bumbling twit!'" he said in his poshest voice.
A second year who reminded him an awful lot like a young Hermione bounced up and down on the balls of her feet as she raised her hand. Harry smiled warmly and briefly glanced at Hermione who did the same.
tears, and nodded, gingerly holding out his shaking, slightly calloused hand for Draco to slide the ring onto his ring finger.
, on he and Draco's stomach and chest. He felt his arse clench around Draco's cock and it was enough to send Draco over the edge, as well. He rested his sweat covered forehead on Harry's as he stilled and came inside of him.
"Watch it, Potter," he said through a terse smile. "Teddy, did you know there's cake? Why don't you lot go and find cake?"
The burn increased as the third finger made its way inside, the pressure making Harry feel incredibly full. Then Draco hooked his fingers as he began to move in and out and Harry cried out!
"Harry, you know I'm going against my every natural instinct to try to respect your wishes but..." He reached out and palmed Harry's chin in one hand, squeezing his cheeks so that his lips puckered and parted. "When you make sounds like that..."
"But he... he was waiting for me..." he breathed, eyes wide and pupils blown as he tried to connect the dots.
"Oh." He turned to look at Weasley but was taken aback to see the whole room, Snape included, watching them interact with mouths open in shock. He was fairly certain that they couldn't hear them speaking over in this corner so he looked to them with a raised eyebrow. "What?"
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and Draco's arms wrapped around him with his hands nestled at the small of his back. They stayed like that, forehead to forehead, for a long moment while both of their breathing calmed.
Ok. He had to admit he was feeling stupider by the second. He made a conscious note that if he were going to be an idiot in the future, then he at least needed to use the other hand so that he could heal himself.
"Uh-oh, Proudfoot, you'd better be careful." Jansen sneered and then yelped as he was hit with a carefully aimed hex.
Before he and Harry had even hit the floor, they were surrounded by a shield of Gryffindors (and Luna Lovegood) who all shouted in unison: "
!" he responded indignantly, puffing out his chest as he followed Potter across the threshold. "Course not..." he added a little weaker as his eyes raked cautiously down each row of shelving they passed in search of the little wandmaker.
"I wonder if they have Janet?" he said and Harry tried not to laugh as he gravitated towards the wall of CDs dedicated to pop divas while still dressed in the Metallica gear.
"Then I declare you..." The tufty-haired wizard paused to look at Draco. Harry blinked between the two of them, confused, when he realized that all eyes had fallen onto his groom, expectantly.
***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
connect with people. Really try to get to know them and see if you like them for real. Besides, these are Harry's friends. If you're really going to be a part of his life you should really try to be friends with his friends."
Draco nodded. "Excuse my language, but, I just can't keep being a part of something shitty anymore just because it's expected of me. It's not the life I want to live," he said solemnly. Harry heard Ron scoff from the other side of Hermione, clearly not convinced.
Draco sighed as he pulled out what appeared to be an impervioused document with the Ministry of Magic ledger, front and center, from an inside robe pocket. He placed it in front of Harry, who raked over it quickly.
If you didn't read DHSGAHP, then it should be noted that Harry understands what's happening to Draco because he had a very similar moment when he'd stepped in to protect Draco in part 1 (even if Draco was blackout drunk at the time and barely remembers it, himself). Ron jokingly told Harry that Dumbledore would've blamed it on "love magic" or something.
He probably would've given him a harder time, really, if Draco hadn't looked so great with his pouty, pink lips or had his own heart not started doing the tango at him actually being there.
"I don't know... Someone recently told me that I had nothing more to prove to anyone and that it was ok to live my life for me so, at the moment, I couldn't really give a damn what other people would think." He smirked up at Draco. "But do tell me how all that attachment stuff would make the sex different than what you're used to?" He quirked an eyebrow.
"Potter!" he breathed, mesmerized. His eyes landed on Andromeda a moment later and Harry saw a glimpse of panic that made him wonder if Draco had made the mistake of thinking he'd spotted a ghost like so many others did when they encountered the woman who looked so much like her psychopathic, late sister. She smiled her wide, kindly smile and he watched the fear abate. "An-Andromeda?" Draco finally managed to get out.
Blaise shook his head. "You all really like to dabble in social suicide, don't you? This is why we don't date Gryffindors, you guys have no sense of self-preservation." He threw up his hands in surrender as Ginny pointed her wand at his face. "Ok, ok I'll do it in the name of scandal. ....And in the hope that it gets me--"
He rolled his eyes. He simply couldn't bring himself to worry about something as trivial as house points.
"Yea, yea," Draco said as Harry helped him sit up. "You're just lucky you were right because if I would've died right before my wedding, I would've been so bloody pissed off."
Harry looked to Hermione. She and Ron were the only ones who could possibly understand. Harry had made up his mind before he'd even left his kitchen that morning that he could not let the Elder wand wind up in the hands of anyone dangerous enough to resort to kidnapping and extortion to obtain it. But should he let his team know? The entire purpose of burying it nearly ten years ago was so that no one would know its whereabouts or be tempted by its existence. Hermione made a minute little shake of her head from left to right.
"No, thank you," he said, politely, and made to walk around her. He raised a brow, however, when she blocked his way again.
"But you, Draco," he looked at him with pride and amazement that he couldn't possibly deserve. "Draco, it was you that did all the legwork. All the
Draco looked at him with wide eyes. Dumbledore: another topic that he didn't very well want to talk about.
"Oh dear, Gods..." Lucius' voice broke through the bickering as the man, apparently, found his bearings. "Draco... Please don't tell me this is you."
Harry simply kissed him on the cheek and pointed upwards to where the magical green timer flashed an impressive: 5 minutes and 52 seconds.
Draco shook his head and smiled a toothy incredulous smile. He gently shifted Harry off his chest and turned onto his side to face him head-on, instead. Harry followed suit, their faces mere inches away and Harry's eyes traveling down to soft pink lips as Draco spoke again, so softly that he could barely hear it.
"Ah," Blaise said simply, nodding as he followed Draco. He kept nodding as he said: "So about Harry Potter... What
Ron looked like he was having some sort of fit. Finally he turned to face Harry and placed both hands on his shoulders, all of which was starting to make Harry wonder if he was going round the bend.
Weasley cocked his head and looked at him thoughtfully, eyes still narrowed. "Malfoy, what really happened in those two weeks? You know, in that last year of training?"
"Then that might just be the most tragic thing I've ever heard, Harry." It was the first time it'd left his sober lips and his voice broke on the name, along with a tiny piece of Harry's heart. Draco looked away and cursed himself. Harry reached out to gently tilt the other boy's chin so that they were eye to eye again, their faces inches away.
"Yes, Teddy, I'll play all the fun games he wants me to." Harry laughed and discretely reached round to squeeze Draco's bum.
places to hide out as fugitives. Harry was already feeling antsy and impatient at the thought of airport kiosk shopping or duty free stores.
"Draco... I don't know how I could ever thank you, really..." His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard and glanced down at his soggy trainers. When he glanced back up at him, it was through long black lashes. Draco was so mesmerized by the sight that he almost missed the next bit. "--But, you've got to get out of here and I've got to go and find Ginny."
Draco rolled his eyes at him, always seemingly aware of his worries, and flashed a dazzling smile at Teddy
"I just need you to help me understand," he continued. "We're having a real hard time understanding just how you went almost two days without noticing that your wife was missing."
Mcgonagall stared at him for a long moment. She pulled out her wand and aimed it at the small couch against the curved wall opposite her desk, transfiguring it into a large circular sectional that angled itself around the strange instruments that were still littered about the room. "Have a seat," she said, waving to direct them to the plush green and red tartan cushions.
"I'm just trying to decide how big of a fuck you I'm willing to send my parents," he contemplated before reaching into his bag and pulling out a quill to scribble back his response. Sebastian twisted up his mouth wryly but didn't pry, probably tired of hearing him bitch about his parents by now. Draco had barely finished attaching the letter and giving the owl a piece of his buttered scone before another one landed as the first departed.
"Aww, you're too pretty to be crying over any bloke. Come with me, I'll help take your mind off of it."
"See, I told you there is art in subtly, Potter." Draco smiled, smugly, as he appreciated his handiwork.
Harry returned to an eerily empty Grimmauld Place late that night. He hadn't noticed it much the night before because he'd, blessedly, downed their last bottle of
If you read any of this before 3/27/21, Jansen's name had previously been Jensen when I wrote this the first go round. I'd just thought it was an interesting name, nothing more. But that was before I got into Supernatural as my pandemic show and realized that Jensen Ackles deserved way better for a namesake. Lol I can't even look at the name Jensen without making the association now and so it had the be changed!
"That's the thing." He shook his head again and stared back into guarded, gray eyes. "I don't think I want to..."
She approached at just the right moment to overhear the one fit bloke with glasses hiss, sourly, to the other fit blonde bloke:
Potter whistled. "Now that is some serious business, that is." He smiled as he pulled out a pouch and pointed his wand to direct the still floating heirlooms into it.
Harry sighed but nodded. "I just wanted this to be over, Draco. And all of this has been pointless--" he waved a hand absently at the truly chaotic mess of case files and notes. "I figured if I got the wand and drew him out..."
to recuse himself for being too close to this case -- and letting Ginny's non-ministry-official brother sit in on questioning, no doubt, crossed a line but, he couldn't afford not to have the best eyes on this and he didn't trust anyone more than his former partner.
and I've been glad to see that you've been auspiciously absent from it's movement. Is that why you found yourself on the end of a killing curse when you helped Mr. Potter this afternoon?"
"I think I'd better get me some lunch, too, Peter Piper," he said to the pink pygmy puff who was chowing down on a handful of Lucky Charms.
Harry stilled, his back towards Draco. He exhaled loudly and selected a silk pair of pajama pants from one of the drawers.
Harry nodded pensively. He kicked off his trainers and lay back towards the foot of the bed, letting his left leg hang off of the edge. He stared at the ceiling silently for a long moment.
"Now what are we going to do with this bloke?" Harry pointed a thumb in Hristofor's direction. "He'll probably just run straight to his friend or the other one when we let him go..."
He couldn't remember the last time he had slept more than two hours at a time since the war. Surely this was just a sign of sleep deprivation.
"I had just broken up with Blaise and Luna was over at the burrow trying to cheer me up with her theory about Blaise really being a vampire. I was playing along and we went down a rabbit hole of giggling and connecting weird dots to prove the theory and Ron walks in and snorts when he hears it. Then he goes:
There's one chapter and an epilogue left to go for part 1! I might try to post them both on the same day if I can make myself write the epilogue by Wednesday (It's the one bit I didn't write yet but decided this needed it if I'm going to make you wait a little bit for part 2).
"You don't sound too enthused." Draco shot him a scowl but Potter was not to be deterred. "Do you love this woman you're marrying?"
"I'm so sorry, Draco, that I made you think I didn't love you because of who you are or who you love. I've never stopped loving you. I just felt so betrayed and abandoned."
And Merrywhip wasn't the only one to treat him like some type of defense against the dark arts guru, either. Flitwick's dueling club was scheduled to start up on Halloween day and, as much as he wanted to back out, he couldn't! Not when everyone from Hagrid to McGonagall kept emphasizing how wonderful a thing it was for him to do for the younger students and what it would mean for them to be taught by Harry Potter...
he did," Angelina chimed in as she joined them at the kitchen island, a bowl of popcorn in hand, her purple Weasley jumper reflecting in her sparkling Christmas bulb earrings. She kissed George on the cheek and then turned to watch the show.
