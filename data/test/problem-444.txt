Harry followed Ron to a small room off to the side of the area that housed the prisoners.
Harry walked over to the Pensieve and uncorked the phial Draco had given him.
Draco nodded and pressed to his tiptoes, nuzzling against the stubbled underside of his dada’s jaw submissively. His dada gave a low, approving growl in response.
He folded himself over the small boy, curling an arm under Draco’s chest and yanking him up. With his chest to the boy’s back, he started snapping his hips against his rabbit, slamming his cock deep each time.
Harry returned his smile, the Alpha in him purring with pleasure. “I don’t mind at all and Scorpius is free to make as much of a mess as he wants. It won’t bother me in the slightest, Draco.”
He sighed, running his fingers through Scorpius’ soft blond hair. Scorpius looked up at him with beseeching emerald eyes.
Jealousy scalded him, hot and piercing. A feeling Harry was completely unfamiliar with. He couldn’t let this happen; he
“Um,” Draco rasped. “Yes. I was just about to go in.”
”Get on your hands and knees in front of me, sweetheart. Let Dada
“W-who are you?” Draco asked, letting out a sharp cry when Harry found his prostate.
for it.
He knelt, sliding a claw underneath the topmost blanket and flipping it back.
But he couldn’t deny it any longer. He was in love with his Omega, his captive, his
Harry nodded. “I’ll be back in the morning to see you to work. You can’t get rid of me that easily.”
He rolled the swollen nubs between his fingers, watching in rapt fascination as two small dribbles of milk leaked out from the pink tips.
Draco swallowed nervously, mulling over their words.
“Your father is good man, Draco. He just has…things that need to be taken care of and we can’t have you here while we’re taking care of those affairs. It will be safest to send you away. What I need from you right now is your faith and cooperation. You do believe in me, don’t you, Draco?”
After the first time he had barged in while drunk, he had started coming back each night. Draco had fought him at first, but he knew it wasn’t a good idea to try to overexert himself so early in his pregnancy. Each time, Harry would be cold and clinical as he fucked him. He always made sure that Draco was leaking slick and moaning for more before he would take him, but always ended up fucking him from behind. After Harry would finish, he would always be sure to transfer some of his magic to his jellybean, ensuring that Draco’s pup was being taken care of.
His body was preparing to take Harry’s cock.
Everything was falling into place.
”You should take a good look at this freak, Draco,” he whispered, his voice deadly calm. “Because
Harry glanced up, reading the shop sign that hung perpendicular to the dark stone building it was attached to.
“Heading inside?” Arlen finally asked, making Draco snap out of it.
Draco reluctantly lowered both of his arms, revealing his breast milk sodden pyjama top.
He didn’t even finish his sentence, lowering his head to lap at Draco’s wet nipple. The boy mewled, twining one of his arms around Harry’s neck as he licked.
Draco suppressed the urge to groan and took her hand, letting her help him to his feet.
They were only centimeters apart now, Draco’s Omega pheromones thick and heavy in the air surrounding them.
To become attached would put them both in danger and the thought of his sweetheart being punished because of him…
“You don’t look a day over twenty-one, Hermione.”
handsome.
Harry had been in close vicinity to Omegas in the past and he’d never felt this…
His breasts were smaller now, not as swollen with milk as they had been. Scorpius rarely nursed anymore, and Draco was embarrassed of his post-nursing breasts.
Harry snorted derisively and the sound went straight to Draco’s aching heart.
Harry’s eyes hardened. “Save your first kiss for whom, Draco? I’ve already told you there will be no one else. Stop thinking someone is going to swoop in and save you. I’m all you have, all you
. Draco had
Ginny had been mature about it. She had said she understood and let him know that she was ready whenever he wanted to talk about the future.
Harry released her arms and cupped her face between his hands, focusing on the dilated pupils of her blue eyes.
Harry roughly rubbed the heel of his hand against his erection, trying to get himself under control.
Potter was eerily still, sitting on the bale of hay with his legs lazily spread. The riding crop had fallen to the ground beside the bale of hay, forgotten.
Everything felt so
Draco had finally drawn up the courage one evening to finally remove the covering over the portrait. It hung above the fireplace in the room, layers of dust coating it. He had wondered why Kreacher didn’t clean up in the room. Every other room on that floor seemed spotless.
Draco felt two tears slide down the sides of his face, vacillating between begging for Harry to stop or just doing what he wanted.
Harry let out a low chuckle, pressing his lips against Draco’s warm ear. “I could smell you all day, Draco. It wasn’t your normal scent, no. Do you want to know how I knew you went into heat?” he whispered, letting his tongue briefly flick out to lick Draco’s earlobe.
Harry pulled back to look him the eyes, his hand stilling on the arm of Draco’s coat.
Omega,” Harry snarled. “My
Sex between an Alpha and Omega during an Omega’s heat was revered and considered sacred by most societal norms. It was looked upon as something only mates partook in, mainly because it was the only time an Omega was fertile.
that to me?” Harry asked, his voice taking on a lethal edge. “You
“No! No, Dada! No—
Draco could recognize the pity in Arlen’s eyes, and he didn’t like it.
before I give you what you want.” Harry let his thumb glide over Draco’s lower lip in a taunting caress. “Only I can give you what your body craves and your stomach will eventually swell with the child only
Theo glanced at the wrapped lunch Draco had set down on the hay and nodded.
Several moments later, Harry Potter stalked into their kitchen. His face was wiped of all emotion, his usual lambent green eyes, cold.
touch you!”
Draco?
Harry assured himself that it was just a normal biological reaction. He was an Alpha and Draco was an Omega. They were biologically compatible, and he was inherently predisposed to react to Omega pheromones in such a way. It was as natural as his circadian rhythms or his ruts each month. Purely chemical, nothing more.
of our love, Draco. There is only the truth, and that is that we are in love with each other. You are my mate and Scorpius is my son, and that’s never changing. Your father will just have to accept that.”
He sat down on one of the spindly iron benches that was in the area, adjusting Scorpius to lay over his lap.
He didn’t like it. It tasted bitter and it felt
Draco had to resist feeding Scorpius whenever he showed signs of wanting to suckle. His chest had become sensitive and swollen with excess milk in the past few weeks, but he was committed to weaning.
“Tell me the truth, or I won’t come to help you through your nightmares anymore. I’ll leave you to scream and beg for me at night. I’ll let you sleep alone at night after I fuck you. It doesn’t bother me in the slightest, Draco.”
Draco flushed even more, leaning more towards Harry, as if he were unconsciously doing it. “They do...I nursed Scorpius when I got up and my nipples weren’t as swollen as before.”
home!
,” Draco choked out. “Make love to me, Harry. I...
”Go on then. I won’t repeat myself. Touch yourself—
“Do they hurt?” Harry asked, painfully pinching one between his fingers.
He was
When Harry came with a low grunt, Draco’s lips parted against his, whimpering into his mouth as he felt himself being filled with Harry’s semen.
Draco glared up him, trying fruitlessly to tug his wrist from Harry’s punishing grasp.
It was dark out now and the boy was bounding from one end of Harry’s bedroom to other, giggling while he did. The baggy shirt he wore had slipped down, revealing one of his pale shoulders. His blond hair was unkempt and slightly oily around his ears, making Harry frown.
His mother looked to be around his age. Her blonde hair was long, curling softly around her shoulders. She was wearing her school uniform, a potted plant tucked under one of her arms. She was smiling up at…
He couldn’t turn away from what he was about to do. Despite all of the terrible things that had been done to him, he couldn’t turn his back on someone who was suffering.
He could feel his Alpha’s presence at his back, their newly made bond pulsing between them.
I’m having a really fun time writing this fic, but I’m going to take a break from it for a bit to update my other neglected fics. I hope you enjoy this chapter and Happy Holidays!
?” he croaked. “And why are you
”Does it feel good?” Potter asked, his tone light and teasing. Infuriating. Degrading.
That night, Harry had wanked off holding the pillowcase to his nose, inhaling Draco’s scent to push him towards climax.
Was Pansy in love with him?
with anyone, okay?”
When he was standing a few steps away from the chair the man was seated in, the man raised his hand and pointed to the spot beside him.
He cleared his throat and gave Harry a sheepish smile. “So, you have questions?”
“Not much better, but looking a tad more perky,” Draco murmured, gently rubbing one of the fern’s leaves between his thumb and forefinger.
His dada growled again and reached around his hips, tweaking his exposed tail in warning. “
Harry grimaced inwardly. “I just haven’t been feeling that social, Mione.”
”Why do you smell so...” Draco swallowed thickly and grabbed Harry’s hand, lifting it to his lips. He pressed his nose against the back of Harry’s hand, nuzzling it.
, Draco. Your body will be at my full disposal. Your womb will act as nothing but a vessel for my seed.”
. He wanted Draco to yield, but he also wanted him to
While Scorpius suckled happily, Draco studied him, smiling.
They both cried out in unison, the feeling of Draco’s tight channel gripping his aching length almost too good to be real.
Draco stared up at them, feeling an influx of conflicting emotions at the sight of them together.
He turned to walk away but ran face first into something solid. He lost his footing on the slick surface of the snow-covered cobblestone street, letting out a tiny gasp in surprise. Two firm arms snaked around his middle, pulling him close and preventing him from falling on his arse.
Seeing Narcissa on her knees, begging for the life of her child should have brought him immense satisfaction.
“Beautiful like his mummy,” Harry rasped softly, nudging his knee against Draco’s under the table, making his breath catch. He turned and looked up at Harry from under his lashes, flushing under his Alpha’s heavy-lidded gaze.
Harry shrugged. “Children are honest and open creatures. If you show them kindness, they’ll return it tenfold. Not like adults, so jaded and guarded. With children, I’ve always been comfortable because they’re completely honest with their emotions. Quite a rare thing that is for adults.”
Draco stormed off, leaving a bewildered Harry Potter alone in the garden.
“I’m just worried about you, mate,” Blaise said softly, adjusting the scarf around Draco’s neck with long, nimble fingers.
“Unbutton your shirt,” he rasped.
But maybe Draco had already found
A knock sounded on his office door, making him glance up.
Something more…
Draco was reluctant to admit that his jellybean moved the most at night, when he was in Harry’s arms. His baby reacted to his Alpha’s magic, kicking incessantly when Harry would transfer his magic to his pup.
He thought that he had been…trying to
Harry clicked his tongue. “Do you want me to see you, Draco? Do you want us to touch, skin to skin?”
Never in his life had he been aroused by breastfeeding, but when he had seen Draco’s dripping nipple, he had to inwardly fight his Alpha instincts that suddenly came roaring to the surface.
“Just looking at the embryo’s vitals. Nothing to be overly concerned about, but the fetal heart rate is a bit slow.”
. His aunt had forbidden him from traveling further than the perimeters of their property and she had always been the one to go into the nearby town to get supplies. His life before captivity had been peaceful but had been also blissfully ignorant.
Draco could feel his ire rising higher each minute he was forced to be in the presence of his arrogant boyhood nemesis. Harry Potter didn’t know the first thing about him or what he’d gone through.
“no no, potions were never my strong suit. I meant with this, we weren’t the students here with crabby homelives and Rose might not be the only one here now, sure they can stay here over christmas and other smaller breaks but summer holiday is two months long and  that’s two months you’re forced to spend in a home where you aren’t wanted. Maybe if we worked together or something, tried to find a solution and took it to McGonagall, maybe we could do something, help someone” After his not so small word vomit, he let out a breath. Malfoy’s eyes grew wide and his eyebrows were in his hairline.
“Malfoy! i-uh i’m- i was just” Harry stammered, red creeping up neck,
“Come in” Harry opened the door to McGonnagall’s office, it was weird being here and not seeing Dumbledore behind the desk, but McGonnagall wore it well, her expression was unamused as always, thin lips and round all knowing eyes that made him feel like he was back in his 3rd year being caught out bed past curfew.
“Ms Rose why don’t you come by my office sometime this wednesday?” Her eyes grew wide and she looked like she was about to cry, “nono you’re not in trouble, don’t worry, i’d just like to talk to you, is that ok” Harry asked, keeping his voice as sickeningly sweet and calm as possible, she stared at him, eyes still filled with horror as she nodded, she gathered her things and ran off, probably looking to get away from her weirdo professor as quickly as possible without drawing too much attention to herself.
“I mean sure? we’re grown ups now, we don’t have to continue the the dumb rivalry from when we were kids” Harry shrugged.
“I’m not trying to be a hero Malfoy I want to help you” Harry got up from where he was kneeling and stood in front of Malfoy, they stood eye to eye, Malfoy was maybe an inch taller than Harry.
“Oh right, uhh should we go in” Harry asked, motioning towards his office, Malfoy just nodded and started walking, Harry walking awkwardly behind him. Malfoy sat down in the chair across from Harry’s desk and Harry went to make some tea, in the usual teal and pink mugs. The room filled with the sweet smells of chamomile and sugar, this made Apollo pop his head out, Harry stood with his back to Malfoy when he heard a thud,  turned around to see Malfoy wide eyed and halfway out his chair, Apollo and thunked down on Harry’s desk from the sticks above it. Now Harry would usually think Malfoy had been shocked, even at Hogwarts it wasn’t often snakes dropped from the ceiling, but the far away look in Malfoy’s eyes and the way his chest was rising and falling rapidly told Harry this was something else entirely. Harry walked over quickly, careful placing his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder,
“Yes, Malfoy is the poisons teacher, he’s also head of slytherin… we umm we’re working on a way for students in at risk homes to be able to stay year round” Harry explained,
“i- yeah no” Malfoy took in another deep breath “yes i wouldn’t mind accompanying you back to Hogwarts”
Harry just stayed in his chair, a little shocked, it was the first time he’d seen her act all headmistery, sure they’d been in her office multiple times, just talking. McGonagall was going to great lengths to make sure he knew what to do and if he was ok. The prophet had had a field day when it got out he resigned Harry Potter the boy who’s gone mad?! it was understandable why, he left his job, broke up with his longtime girlfriend and moved out of their gorgeous london apartment and back into grimmauld place, it was actually a nice place, he’d spent the better part of the past two years tearing down walls and picking out throw pillows, it’d been a good distraction from everything else. Now he had a job again and another place to live, albeit this time he had no walls to knock down, but he still spent the first 2 weeks there remaking his chamber, albeit no permanent ones other than a few holes in the walls and ceiling for Apollos sticks,which could easily be fixed with a little household magic.
Wake up, feed Apollo, let Apollo out, shower, put on clothes and head to breakfast in the great hall. Harry didn’t know if he should savour the walk, might be the last time in many months he’d get a quiet morning to just appreciate the beauty of Hogwarts, so he does, he takes a longer route to the great hall just appreciating the semi silence and beautiful surroundings but of course since the universe is against him, a mess of white-blond and dark green runs into him, pushing him to the ground.
“Gardner, Pearce, Berkins, I trust you’ll hurry, your next class should be any second now” Malfoy greeted with a guarded expression. Oddly reminiscent of the way Snape used to hold himself, he turned to Harry, who was eyeing him amused, it wasn’t often he saw Malfoy interacting with students. They all hurried past him without actually looking at him.
“Sure Potter, after we meet my mother you can imagine anything you want” Malfoy sighed, but he smiled a little, it was nice.
“Ok so Apollo may have said that he didn’t wanna leave you because your smelled nice”  the longer harry talked the quieter he got, hoping Malfoy had missed the last part and that he didn’t care, obviously the universe was against Harry yet again because the Malfoy had heard every word and now a smirk (that Harry was not welcoming) was spreading on Malfoys lips.
“Haven’t you done that many times already? you haven’t talked to me much lately” Harry was officially the worst, terrible person.
Malfoy nodded, looking off into space like nothing in his life made sense anymore, he quickly shook out it, going back to his usual careful expression,
“I do not know their names but i’ve only seen them twice, the first time it was 2 people, a male who smelled of that fake stuff you use on fancy days, and a lady who smelled like roses. The next time they had another male with them, he smelled of old books” Apollo hissed, Harry had no idea what to do with this information, it’s not he spent his days at Hogwarts sniffing the slytherins. Ah crap harry didn’t have time to question Apollo about these mysterious guests anymore, not if he wanted breakfast that is. Harry fumbled to get a jumper and some jeans on, practically running down the halls to make breakfast, catching his breath just around the corner, he wasn’t feel to keen on having his own troll in the dungeon Quirrell style entrance, but still everyone eyed him as he walked to the staff stable, Harry sat down next to Neville, trying to enter his entire body into his maroon jumper, where he’d be away from prying eyes.
“I’m surprised we’re talking, or that you came to me, figured you would’ve asked McGonagall instead” Malfoy looked hurt, he crept lower into the chair and kept his eyes on Harry’s nameplate.
a few were sorted into hufflepuff and ravenclaw before a little boy with brown hair sat down on the stool and McGonagall placed the hat on him, It took a minute before the hat called out Gryffindor! and Harry felt himself puff up with pride a little, his first new student, well his first student ever but he’s head of gryffindor, and this is the first student to join. A few more were placed, whenever slytherin was called fewer people seemed to clap and cheer, Malfoy didn’t seem exactly cheerful either, he just nodded his head at the student and clapped politely.
Harry sat next to Neville and immediately looked to the gryffindor table, a lot of the weasleys had kids now, in 9 years or so this hall would be swimming in gingers dressed in scarlet. McGonagall got up, the sorting was about to begin. It went pretty much the same as all the times he’d seen Dumbledore do this at the start of each year, a short speech about Hogwarts and the coming year as well as some ground rules, she introduced Harry as the new Defence teacher and the students either started clapping or whispering. The hat was then brought out and sang his ever so lovely song and then it was time.
“what if, if we worked together” Harry's voice was barely above a whisper, regretting it as soon as he’d said it.
“That’s... I can’t, How do you know this?”
“You still spy on him” Harry asked shocked Harry, who had kinda forgotten about Apollo’s definitely creeping probably morally wrong hobby, it was only his office though at least Apollo wasn’t spying in his bedroom. Apollo definitely had slytherin traits, he was a curious little thing and even if Harry told him he wasn’t allowed to do something he still would, he’d just be careful not to get caught, the little shit.
Entering the great hall with Malfoy was an experience in itself, the only ones there were the other teachers so it was quiet, but however slight as the door opened Malfoys chin lifted and back straightened, Harry doubted it was intentional more likely it was instinct from the many, many times Harry had seen him enter at like that when they were at school. They walked towards the great table, not speaking and Malfoy swaying less. Neither of them spoke but stayed within arms reach, Neville shot Harry a curious look and Harry shot back one he hoped read I'll explain later, they got the table and Harry left Malfoy to his own devices as he sat down next to Neville.
“We’re learning about banshee’s today and they of course think screaming as loud as they can is the epitome of humor so here we are” Malfoy just nodded, he looked around awkwardly having completely forgotten the reason he was here, Harry cocked an eyebrow motioning towards the parchment Malfoy was reading when he walked in,
“My mother? Narcissa Malfoy, she knows a lot of important people, she also keeps up with the families of death eaters, helps the kids where either parents are incapasitaded somehow. It wasn’t her fault she was married off to my father, so now that he’s away and my mother is free she- I don’t know why i’m telling you any of this”
“So i have been told, but here, I’m professor Potter and i get it, it’s weird i’m in your history books and im a bedtime story but now i’m your teacher, so let’s get it over with any questions?” Harry stood in front of his desk, resting against it. Looking out over an ocean of eager faces and twitching hands waving for attention, Harry pointed to a girl with strawberry blonde hair in the front.
“Did you say you found a passage that led to Malfoys office?”  He turned around slowly, mouse in hand, like everything was slow motion he sat back down and fed him the mouse.
“Uhh yes please, milk no sugar” He refused to take his eyes off the snake, as if he wanted to be prepared if Apollo decided to jump him, Harry took note and picked him up reached to the stick above his desk “can we get some privacy please, Just go in the bedroom and yes you can grab a mouse” Apollo looking pleased with himself, slithered away on his sticks in the direction on the door, Malfoy already seeming more comfortable, Harry went to make tea, he grabbed his usual teal mug and a light pink mug with a geometric lion and some flowers on it for Malfoy, it had been a gift from George shortly after he and Ginny moved in together because apparently he needed to add a feminine touch to the apartment.
“So how is it being a teacher? and back at Hogwarts no less” asked Hermione, placing down two steaming mugs with tea on the old oak coffee table, they were all sat in the lounge, most of the furniture was mismatched but the walls were covered in bookshelves and picture frames, hadn’t changed much from when Harry had lived on their sofa, except there was no boxes and duffel bag to be seen and no pillow and duvet on the couch.
Harry sat down against the tree with a huff, looking over the lake, listening to the children laugh and talk just out of his line of sight, wondering if he’d just messed up his one shot at helping her and any other children at Hogwarts. Malfoy came over and sat down next to him,
“what? no i’m fine, i just need to get some food i’ll be fine” which was just a bold faced lie, the man could not stand still, he was swaying from side to side like a drunken sailor, but Harr was not in a position where his opinion would change Malfoys. The least he could do was to walk him to the great hall, he had to make sure the other didn’t faint on the stairs and crack open his skull, now that would be a horrible way to start the school year.
Class was nothing special, Harry was teaching the fourth year's counter curses. He’d Levitated the desks away and students were all standing waving their wands, Harry walked around them, coming next to the odd student and helping them perfect their movement, most commonly they’d move to big, like they were all the conductors of the worlds weirdest orchestra.
“You’re right,i haven’t and i’m sorry… so what have you been up too these past days, you’ve had the castle almost to yourself” Harry got up and picked Apollo off the stick and placed him on the desk
“The kind that would suggest she’s not being treated right at home” his back straightened, he was the teacher here to protect his student not some troublemaker so he was gonna take this seriously “the signs are there Minerva, I’m not saying her parents are hitting her but i wouldn’t be much of a teacher if i ignored this”
“What can i do for you guys?” Harry asked from behind his desk, smiling up at them, a splotch of yellow dangling from a stick out in his peripheral. Berkins stood forward, “Well sir, Those chapters you asked us to read for next Wednesday, we well, we on the hufflepuff team might have some trouble, we’re up in the first match this thursday and it’s our captains last year so he’s kinda gone mad with training, really wants to win the cup his last year here and such…” Berkins explained, the two behind her were fidgeting, waiting for her to finish. Pearce with his robe and Gardner with her hair.
“you know, life at the Dursleys was hell too, i get it. For eleven years i was a slave, i cooked for them but wasn’t allowed to eat any of it, they fed me scraps or whatever was burnt, i lived in a small cupboard under the stairs and my only clothes whatever clothes my cousin,who was 3 times my size by the way, had ruined. So that’s why i’m doing this, i don’t care what your reasons are, as long as you’re committed to it, and i know Ron was wrong”  Harry said, strangely enough, not feeling like shit, like he did whenever he shared his life before Hogwarts with any of his friends, but then again he and Malfoy weren’t friends.
“I mean, I’m the defence professor last I checked?” Harry asked confused, Malfoy let out a sigh that sounded like all he really wanted was to smack the back of Harry’s head, hopefully to knock some sense into him,
Harry was running frantically around the castle at 10 am switched between parseltongue and just yelling out his name “Apollo! come here boy, Apollooo- umff”  Harry at first thought he’d run to a wall (which wouldn’t have been the first time to be completely honest) that is until he heard a groan and someone moving beside him,
“I mean yes I guess I am, I'm also scared shitless. Last time I thought anything was like three years ago, i did a course on extraction, And before that it was the D.A, and now i’d of house and supposed to teach defense again, it’s scary as shit” he may have spoken a little too loudly, because McGonagall’s voice shot out
“You mean the scar?” Everyone's faces turned towards the young girl with long blonde hair in the back, some looked terrified, she said it others relieved she said what they were thinking.
Harry straightened his back and chuckled, shaking off the memories of a dark forest and his mother's smile, flash of green and so much white it put hospitals to shame.
Harry woke again just a little before the sun, He had a few hours till breakfast in the great hall, he  once again went over all his notes for his lessons for the day, honestly HArry was feeling a little paranoid or nervous or at least, he’d already gone over them multiple times.
“...I’m sorry, What?”
“Yes i’m fine Potter, honestly, what would be wrong, do you often go touching people without permission” Malfoy stumbled his words and eyes kept darting to his desk, sweat beads on his forehead.
“When i was a baby, Voldemort came to kill me. My parents both did everything to keep him from me, my father fought him wandlessy before he uhh.. before Voldemort got him, my mother later sacrificed herself for me, that love, that sacrifice saved my life, a sacrifice like that leaves a mark”  No matter how many times he told the almost truth, it never got easier, the first time Harry had sat down to tell the story, he had to leave four times. memories can seem so real, almost like you’re in it, living it over all again. But a small voice broke him out, or he might have been standing there for an eternity.
“Guys come on,he’s different now, he’s actually not bad -” Harry said as Ron interrupted him again, he really had to stop doing that.
“What’re you doing?” Apollo was hanging down from the stick above his desk once again.
And with that the day was started, the classes all went smoothly, that is until fourth period, it  was his first class with the second years, Harry almost didn’t notice her, she stood apart from the rest of the class, her face obstructed by brown frizz. She looked like any other shy student but as the class went on, Harry’s stomach dropped more and more, he knew the sign he showed the signs half his life. The social distancing, the pulling down sleeves, the flinching at every loud noise.  Harry had to step in.
“I’m so sorry, fuck Malfoy I’m sorry i kept inviting you back here and i didn’t even think why you seemed uncomfortable with Apollo i just figured it was like when people don’t snakes and i just thought that was funny cause you’re in slytherin oh fuck i am so so sorry” Harry rambled, he felt like the biggest asshole, oh fuck Apollo! Malfoy was terrified of Snakes Apollo had been fucking spying on him, Oh fuck fuck fuck-
“I was hoping if there was something i could do, talk to her or find out who her parents are, i don’t know what to do in this situation” Harry took a sip of his tea, no longer finding being alone with Malfoy as weird as he originally imagined it to be.
“Excellent Ms. Berkins, 5 points to Hufflepuff, now who can tell me exactly what the spell does?” Cindy Berkins looked pleased, if not gloatingly at her friend, one of the ravenclaws who’d tried with all their might, he was much taller than Berkins (which honestly didn’t take much) he had dark hair that went to his abnormally high cheekbones, all in all he looked oh so very posh. Berkins posh friend raised his hand at the question
“Minerva, right you can just call me Harry then” she gave him a court nod and then went back to her own breakfast.
“My mother!” Malfoy yelled out,
“What about Miss Rose?” Harry wasn’t sure if McGonagall was expecting him to badmouth the student, her expression had changed, almost as if she was warning him to tread lightly.
“Who the hell is Apollo? and yes i figured seeing as all my stuff is spread about” he motioned towards all the papers they still hadn’t gotten to yet. “Apollo my snake, he usually stays in my room, i’ve told him it's different here and he can't just wander about as he pleases but he’s still so young he just won’t listen and-” before Harry realized he’d begun rambling as he often did whenever Apollo was involved, he tried to hide the gleam he knew he got whenever Apollo was on his mind, he’d only had the snake for a month but he was already his favorite person to talk to, no matter how sad that sounded.
“Harry this is Malfoy we’re talking about, MALFOY, sure yeah the thing you’re doing is great and all but do you need to do it with him? what if he’s using you for something” Ron said, he was clearly frustrated, walking between the brown couch Harry and Hermione were sat and the nearest bookshelf,
“Was that Dugal and Adler? truly awful at potions those two, can barely follow the recipe, not that i'm surprised but why did you give them detention?” Malfoy said
“I umm, i think it’s a good idea but i wanna help her, i noticed, i prayed and prayed for eleven years that someone would notice and then Hagrid came and i thought i was free but the Dumbledore still made me go back there. I can’t pass it on, i can’t just send her off to you i, i need to be there, i want to help” He didn’t talk about the Dursleys much, never thought he’d talk to Malfoy about them but it seemed normal, well no but it wasn’t awful or even as bad as Ron or Hermione. Malfoy’s brows were furrowed; he kept opening and closing his mouth like a blabbing fish; Harry however did not share this as Malfoy probably wouldn’t appreciate the comparison.
“i- i didn’t think of it like that”  Harry replied sheepishly
“That’s why I'm here, I was hoping you’d let me, we have uhh similar backgrounds, her real name isn’t Sophia Rose, it’s Sophia Rookwood, maybe she’d feel more comfortable with someone who also had a death eater parent” Malfoy took a slow sip of his tea.The offer was a good one but Harry wanted to help, he needed to.
“So, are you excited to meet your house?” Neville asked, shoveling eggs in his mouth almost reminiscent of the way Ron used to look when they had breakfast at the gryffindor table.
“Fuck..I’m so sorry..bloody fuckin hell” Malfoy said under his breath, Harry wasn’t sure if the last part was for Harry or to himself, harry could praticaly see Malfoy’s walls slowly get rebuilt, he let go of Harry’s arm and raised his chin, scrubbed his face and let out a big sigh.
“Right yes, well i was there but then Ron started acting like a complete git and well Hermione too so i just-” Harry said, the red warmth taking over his whole face now “what are you doing out here, isn’t it almost time for supper?”
“I’ll ask Apollo to keep his distance” was all Harry could trust himself today, Malfoy just nodded in what Harry would guess was appreciation. They were both silent for a while, they had migrated to Harry’s bed, sitting side by side, if he leaned over just a little their shoulder would be touching, Harry quickly buried that thought, or why it made his chest tighten a little, other than that it felt oddly nice to just sit in each others precedence,
Walking on the stairs, passing chatting paintings and the sound of Filch muttering something about the coming students, it was almost like being back here, on his way back from supper after having listened to Hermione blabbing about something she’d read between classes or the homework they’d been assigned… Harry truly did miss them, it just wasn’t the same anymore not after they’d gotten married, Hermione was very involved with her job in the department of regulations and control of magical creatures and Ron was flourishing as an auror, and would probably soon start a family.
“Honestly Ron you’d think you’d be more grateful but noo...just to...maybe if you weren’t such a complete git-” Harry muttered
“Oh, sorry I can come back later” he was about to turn around and walk back out when Harry stood up,
“Yeah, that’s uhh a good idea but - wait Rookwood? wasn't he-”
The rest of the walk was in a comfortable silence, the kind where everyone involved is too scared to break it. It was weird being with Malfoy like this, Harry couldn’t help but let his mind wander, would they ever be friends? what would that be like, would they meet up in the morning before classes and have tea and talk about their students? would he know everything that made the other tick, would he know what to do or say if Malfoy had a bad day? images of them walking by the lake after a long day, them sitting next to each other  in the great hall sharing inside jokes, laughing, like him, Ron and Hermione used to do.
of this memory, away from the horrible man who he knew was
He ripped the glove from his mouth and pushed off Potter’s lap, falling unceremoniously to the dirty stable ground.
The cacophony of various animal squawks, chirps, and growls assaulted Harry’s sensitive ears. The entire left wall of the shop was filled with floor-to-ceiling cages. They were filled with an eclectic mix of magical creatures, some Harry couldn’t even put a name to.
They hadn’t yet made love and Harry was fine with taking things slow. He didn’t want to rush into sex and Draco was more important to him than physical satisfaction.
“You have done nothing, pet. You are the repentance of your horrid family. The offering. Your pain is my revenge. If you must know, your precious mother was a Death Eater, like your pathetic father.”
Most of his life had been spent with his aunt Bellatrix in the country and they had been barely able to afford furniture, let alone throw
Harry snorted, his smirk fading as he gazed down at him. He lifted his hand and cupped Draco’s cheek, lightly rubbing his thumb along his cheekbone.
Draco snorted delicately, taking a bite of bacon and chewing angrily before swallowing. “That would make more sense, yeah,” he mumbled before taking a bite of toast.
Draco kept his eyes lowered, the large swell of his stomach preventing him from seeing his own feet. He was eight months pregnant now and only getting bigger with each passing day.
”Mum,” he said, tugging at Draco’s jumper again.
He tried to blame his shameful feelings on their forced bond and his pregnancy, but it wasn’t just that anymore.
Draco went rigid.
It was already too much that his mother would  accost him with prying questions every time he picked up Juniper from her after work.
Harry’s bite upon his throat throbbed painfully, needing his Alpha’s healing tongue to ease it.
Draco looked up at him, eking out a small smile. “I know that, Harry. I’m just…worried. I don’t want anything to go wrong.”
Draco looked up, giving him a small smile. “I’m doing this for myself, Arlen. I need to see him. Even if it’s just a glimpse. I just…need to. Thank you for your concern, but I’m going to see him.”
Warmth suffused his chest at the thought, but guilt quickly followed.
,” he said softly, tears now continuously falling from his eyes.
Pansy’s face turned a deep shade of crimson.
In all the books he’d read, they had recommended letting your Alpha suckle out some of your leftover supply if your baby had begun tapering off your breast milk. An Alpha’s healing saliva could counteract any swelling or engorged nipples that may have befallen an Omega attempting to quit breastfeeding.
Draco could feel Harry’s gaze on him, like a brand. He glanced up at him.
Harry gently tweaked the soft tuft of the boy’s tail and grinned when the boy let out an indignant squeak.
Harry went completely still, his jaw hardening. Draco had seen Harry when he was mad, and this…this was something entirely different.
“I spoke with Ginny the other day. She’s also worried about you, Harry. She’s tried to write you, but you haven’t written back.”
“My cock has been unflinchingly
hadn’t been religiously checking the watch reports for Malfoy Manor and definitely had
“My mother named me,” he murmured, feeling his cheeks warm again under the man’s scrutiny. “And I’m not a
Harry licked down the boy’s sternum, heading for his genitals. He daubed his tongue into the boy’s bellybutton, smiling against his skin when his sweetheart let out a soft sigh.
Draco mewled, pressing his hard prick back to Potter’s lap. He let out a soft gasp when his own erection was met with Potter’s own hardness.
”Is it...the pup?” he asked gruffly.
!” Draco cried out; his eyes screwed closed. “I-I’m going to come if you keep doing
Definitely not.
The kiss was messily desperate, Draco’s hands fisting the front of Harry’s shirt, making him groan. They parted and Harry looked down him, sliding his hands to Draco’s lower back.
Waiting.
!” Scorpius begged, reaching for him.
Harry tugged Draco’s trousers and underwear off of him, tossing them to the side. Draco flushed when he felt slick ooze from his hole, his inner thighs tacky with it.
The left side of Harry’s face was…
The slowly swirling milk melding into his tea. The way his shirt collar brushed against his nape. Even the dust motes floating through the air in front of the window in Hermione’s home, illuminated by the waning sunshine bleeding through the gap in the drapes and spilling across the hardwood floor.
“You’ve unknowingly been rocking your hips for the past hour, pet. Would you like me to
Whatever was in the envelope wouldn’t change his mind.
Draco smiled wistfully. “I wish I could have gotten to experience going to Hogwarts. My mother was sort of protective.”
“Please tell me, Draco,” Harry whispered harshly. “I need to hear it. Did you miss me at all these past few months?”
With shaky fingers, he buttoned up the collar of his shirt underneath his jumper, effectively hiding his collar from view.
Harry’s face went unnervingly blank before he strode forward, closing the distance between them in moments. He bent down until they were eye-level and Draco felt his knees go weak at the sudden influx of alpha pheromones surrounding him.
”Come for Dada, baby, talk to me. Tell Dada,” Harry urged hoarsely, pleasure building at the base of his spine.
Hermione raised her brows and nodded. “Anything, Draco.”
Hatred.
Harry took a shuddering breath. “Draco, I’m—I’m sorry for how I reacted that day in your home. I shouldn’t have treated you that way. I let my anger take over. I could never hurt you...”
He wanted to be in control of
Draco’s fingers holding the photo began to tremble.
son? You must know how out of character that would seem to Ron and I.”
Draco bit his lower lip between his teeth and nodded shyly. “I liked it. It felt...
Harry chuckled softly. “Why are you smiling?”
Harry smiled against his jaw, his tongue flicking out to lick up the tear that had slid down Draco’s cheek. “Good.”
Draco’s heartbeat sped up, leaning into his Alpha’s touch. Harry’s natural scent wafted towards him, his pheromones calming Draco’s anxiety. It was so familiar to Draco now and it only made him wish for the closeness they had before his memory had revealed the truth.
Harry often gave him a goodbye kiss when they parted, the kisses usually turning desperate, messy. And the promises Harry would whisper to him while saying goodbye for the night…
The doors to the drawing room suddenly opened, revealing their Alpha.
“Yes, but you’re only four months along. This is a vital time for the development of your baby, and you shouldn’t push yourself. I still think you should take some time off from the hospital. Just until things are more…in order.”
?” she asked innocently.
Maybe it would always remain there, silently burning somewhere deep within his soul.
give myself to someone like you. You can hurt me, berate me, and rape me as many times as you want. It won’t change my perception of you.”
Harry’s fingers that were holding his cigarette froze half-way to his mouth.
There was a beat of silence on his mother’s end. She re-crossed her legs and smoothed down her already perfectly groomed white-blonde hair with her free hand, as if to compose herself before answering.
He trailed off, realizing who he was speaking to.
He needed his Alpha, his body ached for him as much as his heart did. They both would just feel better if Harry
Lucius grumbled something unintelligible before asking, “But why is
! You assume so much, when
He glanced around, looking for a weapon. There was a magnetic knife holder above the industrial looking stove. The knives stuck to the magnetic strip glinted under the soft light from above, seeming to taunt Draco with their proximity.
He would enjoy this unimpeded moment, for when the boy came back to his senses, he would hate Harry again.
”Do you forgive Dada?” Harry whispered, pressing kisses along the boy’s ear and then lower, to his neck.
you how sorry he is.”
The ensuing silence made Draco’s ears heat.
Draco sighed, straightening. “I’m pregnant, Pansy, not totally incapacitated. I can do things on my own.”
He wasn’t giving Draco his full self, just as Draco had done to him.
When Draco had awoken alone on the last day of his heat, Harry had already disappeared. The last burning vestiges of his heat had slowly dissipated as the day had gone on, and Draco was horrified to realize he couldn’t remember any of it.
Pansy arched a dark brow but didn’t question his lie.
After he had cleaned the bowl of oatmeal, he eyed Harry from under his lashes across the table. The food settling in his stomach seemed to give him a jolt of courage. “So, what do you do when you’re not forcing people to have sex with you?”
He had been staring at an unconscious Draco for the last hour.
He felt oversensitized, needing
The outline of Harry’s thick erection strained against the front of his dark trousers, his hands clenching into fists at his sides. “You need to leave right
Truthfully, he was glad he was naked right now. With the unforgiving heat suffusing every inch of skin, he felt unbearably hot.
He hadn’t felt like that in a long time.
Harry let go of the headboard and placed his hands on either side of Draco’s head, never ceasing his relentless thrusts into Draco’s wet hole. He lowered his head and pressed his lips against Draco’s ear, their sweat slicked chests touching.
Harry had hundreds of them at home, locked away in his desk.
Harry had one objective: fuck the boy once and get him pregnant.
”Az—“ Draco pressed the back of his trembling hand to his lips. “You must bring me to her. I need to see her!” he shouted.
They didn’t feel swollen with milk, nor were they leaking. His nipples also weren’t sore, and he didn’t feel a milk let-down like he usually did in the mornings before nursing Scorpius.
“I don’t see why we had to come here. Nothing has happened since the break-in and this all seems so unnecessary. Yes, it’s downright
He could feel Harry lips stretch into a smile against his skin.
If he allowed his baser instincts to take over, he would put the boy on his hands and knees, pounding into him until he was knotted and filled with cum.
“Let’s see…” Arlen said softly, moving his wand slowly down Draco’s stomach.
Draco’s vision was beginning to go fuzzy around the edges, his heat impairing all of his senses.
He released her and stepped back to look down at her.
“But our bond…” Draco whispered hoarsely, staring at his feet, “if we ignore each other, it will hurt us, Harry.”
Harry narrowed his eyes and reached down, wrapping his fingers around Draco’s upper arm and tugging. “Straddle me.”
They’d hit it off and had begun dating almost immediately.
There were so many questions that would remain unanswered for him.
’ I suppose I would become somewhat of a recluse as well. I’m sure Harry wants to move on with his life. The war was already sixteen years ago, yet people still whisper his name whenever they think he’s not looking. It must become tedious after some time.”
He wasn’t sure which was worse.
Hermione nodded. “Perhaps a family name? Maybe you could use Harry’s parents’ names. His mother’s name was so pretty.”
!” Draco shouted, trying to pull away from him. “I’d say anything to survive another
by him.
after all, Draco.”
Admittedly, it had taken him several attempts to pass the case file on. He’d sat in his office that morning, vacillating between keeping the file tucked safely away in his drawer or taking it to the Auror he’d meant to assign it to.
me that you’re sorry for what you’ve done.”
Harry slammed his finger into Draco, curling it slightly while never stopping the suction of his mouth.
From what he garnered over the past week, the mercurial man held no interests other than hunting and horseback riding. He only left the manor for business and was often gone for weeks at a time.
He tried to remain hopeful for his pup, but it was becoming increasingly difficult under Harry’s callous care.
Ever since they had gotten home from the dinner party, his rabbit emanated
Draco let out a startled shriek when Harry ripped open the buttons of his pyjama top, baring him.
After Hermione left, Draco went to the drawing room.
“Touch yourself, baby,” Harry grunted, his hands busy keeping Draco spread open and to give himself leverage while delivering punishing, precise jabs to Draco’s prostate.
Draco reached out and grabbed Harry’s upper arm. “I didn’t mean it, please just—”
”You should try to get some sleep,” he said. “You look...tired.”
“No,” Draco whispered. “It’s lovely, Hermione. I’ll treasure it always. Thank you.”
Hermione would keep him company and chat with him, sometimes even bringing small presents. She had knitted small mittens for his pup, yellow ones. The stitching was slightly off, but Draco loved them, nonetheless.
His daughter’s remembered words were like a knife to his heart. If only she knew who she was picking the flowers out for.
Harry hummed low in his throat, pressing his lips to the side of Draco’s throat. “
between them.
“What will you do with the boy?”
for his Alpha’s acceptance.
to see him?
The picture he had ripped from the Prophet after his arrest laid at the bottom of the drawer in his nightstand. He would look at it sometimes, but only when he knew his daughter was asleep.
Harry chuckled. “I’m afraid we made a mess making the pancakes. I lost my shirt and Scorpius lost his clothes to flyaway batter.”
Octavius had allowed him to take home a small cage and food. He set the cage up inside of his bedroom on his large writing desk.
Draco couldn’t meet his eyes, guilt weighing heavy in his heart. “I-I don’t know. I just wanted to be a good mother and I—”
Draco had seemed so vulnerable at dinner, blushing constantly and apologizing for nothing.
Harry stopped beside him on the bed and leaned down.
mind.
…” Harry raised one hand and smoothed it down the boy’s ears, stopping to gently scratch behind them with his claw.
. When I’m away from you two, all I do is worry. I should have respected your wish for me to stay away, but I couldn’t. For that, I’m sorry.” He smiled, his green gaze intense. “But I won’t apologize for how I feel about you. I realized last night that it’s not my instincts that are drawing me to you, it’s
The past month, Harry had become a constant presence in their lives. Draco would bring Scorpius to Harry’s home and let them spend time together. Harry would always make them dinner and play with Scorpius until it was time for them to leave. They still hadn’t told Draco’s parents the truth, but he knew Harry was waiting for Draco to do that himself.
“I thought I heard the Floo,” Harry said, walking in and shutting the doors behind him.
Harry grabbed his wrist and yanked him from the shower, pulling him up when he stumbled over the lip of the tub.
Harry stiffened beneath him. “You need to tell your parents, Draco. About us. About Scorpius.”
Draco then said softly, “Let’s go.”
“Why?!” Draco shouted, uncaring if he appeared hysterical. “Why are you shutting me out like this? I know you can
His heart clenched, uneasy with Draco and his pup leaving. He wouldn’t be able to protect them if they weren’t here, where he could keep an eye on them.
With restraint he didn’t know he possessed, he just barely stopped himself from pouncing on Draco.
With Scorpius being cared for by his mother until his heat passed, he knew he should have woken up to an engorged chest.
“No more sharp retorts?” Potter asked. “Then we continue.”
When Harry woke up, he would expect Draco to…
Draco wrapped a supportive arm around his stomach, clumsily slipping forward on his wet feet. Before he could hit the floor, Harry scooped him up into a bridal carry.
”I just wanted to say that I have to pick up Juni from my parents.”
“W-wait,” Draco pressed a hand against Harry’s chest. “Couldn’t you just…rub some of your saliva on them?”
Draco jerked his chin from his grasp. “I’d never beg for you! I’d rather be raped by a room full of faceless Alphas than willingly give my body or my child to
He felt terribly cruel, denying his pup milk.
Even in the darkest times of his captivity, when he felt like there was nothing left of himself and he was slowly drowning in his own despair, Hermione had pulled him back to the surface.
he felt without Harry around. He remembered seeing that column in Witch Weekly about Harry being single and how jealousy had seized him, gripping his heart painfully tight and unrelenting.
Draco straightened in Harry’s lap, pressing his chest out. “Okay…I’m ready, Harry.”
Harry tightened his hold on the boy’s wrist and rammed his fingers upwards, Draco’s wet hole eagerly sucking in more of his fingers.
Draco then steeled himself and looked back up at his mother. “I’m in love with Harry Potter.”
“We’re just friends,” Draco blurted.
Hermione shifted closer to him. “If it’s about Draco, you could talk to me about, you know? I’m your friend. If something happened between you two...”
The rabbit snuffled angrily, remaining on the far side of the bed.
“You’re lactating,” Harry said gruffly, smearing the warm liquid across his nipple with his thumb.
It had been three weeks since his heat, and he hadn’t seen Harry since.
“Really, Rose, you never grow tired of him doing that, do you?” Hermione asked, stepping from the flaring flames of the Floo behind them.
“Are you hungry? Come out from under there and Dada will get you some food.”
Draco frowned. “But when will I get to see you again?”
He gasped and yanked down his jumper with his free hand, flushing.
progress had been made, however. The rabbit had started to eat his kibble and had stopped trembling every time Harry approached his cage.
The plan wasn’t much, see if there was a way for students to stay summer break, the elves didn’t leave so there was still a way to get food and cleaning and the only real problem seemed to be with staffing because yes Harry could stay all year round if he wanted, Kreacher was taking care of Grimuald place but no one could stay if the headmaster wasn’t here so, would McGonagall be willing to stay year round? if no, then they were screwed, if yes? Harry and Malfoy would start figuring out how to staff the summers and just how it’d work, would it be summer camp like with activities (explaining to Malfoy what a summer camp was had been… interesting to say the least) or just let the students roam the castle and grounds as they pleased, within the curfew of course.
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle, his snake roaming secret passageways and snooping… was it possible for a snake to be so much like their human?
“So we just write to her asking if she knows anything about the Rookwoods?” Harry felt sceptical, but it was the only option they had so far so Harry went along with it
“Lucy Daniels, sir. I was just...umm wondering if, if you know all the stories were true?” she stuttered, and played with the hem of her sleeves, looking anywhere but Harry.
“I don’t know what to say” Malfoy sat down on a bench, elbows on his knees and his hands covering the bottom of his face, Harry couldn’t help but notice how elegant his hands looked, long slender and pale fingers “fuck ok, you met my dad, you knao what he’s like, i lived with him and his crushing exspectiations for 17 years, i also lived with the consequences of not meeting those expectations. It was hell, but I had my mother, she did her best to keep me safe so when the time came i-...sorry that’s, you don’t need to know that. Just I know what it feels like to not feel safe in your own home” Malfoy explained, Harry didn’t know what to do or say, what did you do when your old rival now almost friend confides in you?
“Harry i hate to say this but what if he’s right, do you really want to be doing this with Malfoy?” Hermione said kindly,
“Yes, the blonde man. He has many books and smells in his room, no sticks though… our room is better” Harry just chuckled at that, a direct passage from here to Malfoy, could’ve used that when he was in school.
“Malfoy, were you a dick back in school? yes. But i forgave you for that years ago, you’re a different person now, hell i’m a different person. I don’t hate you, i can’t and i won’t so can you stop that and just please me let me help you dammit” Harry explained, Malfoy just sighed.
Now let’s get ready to welcome them with open arms, and remember, Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus” with that she nodded and left the great hall.
“Oh he just wanted to ask if i had seen his hair lightening cream” Harry joked, and both boys seemed to find this amusing, accepting they weren’t gonna get a serious answer.
“Why do you always need to be the hero?” Malfoy asked but he didn’t sound mean or like he was making fun of Harry, more like he was tired.
“Well yes? he’s been cleared by McGonagall if that’s what you're wondering..” the awkwardness of the situation was starting to seep in, these two grown men hunched over picking up paper which were filled with perfect cursive and could only have been written by Malfoy. They almost looked teens in one of those cliche teen romance movies, if their hands touched picking up the same piece of paper Harry would lose it, as they picked up the last piece they both stood up and Harry handed over the pieces he’d gathered.
“I’m her teacher, i can say hello to a lone student without accusing her dad of child abuse”  Harry didn’t give Malfoy time to respond before he left, closer he got he noticed she wasn’t reading, she was drawing, Harry walked over fearfully, barely able to make out what she was drawing, other than some trees.
“Felicity Banks”
“What do you mean you prayed someone would notice?” Malfoy’s voice was small, like he was either scared of the question or the answer, he was looking down in his tea like the milky liquid held all his answers.
“Right..” Merlin this was awkward, how should one act in this situation? former rival now coworker, he was head of slytherin and harry of gryffindor so were they supposed to keep it up or be civil? friendly? surely McGonagall wasn't accepting them to be friends…right? the walk to the great hall was painfully awkward, neither saying anything other than ´are you ok?´ and ýes i’m fine´
“Harry, Ron isn’t trying be a insensitive” Ron shot Hermione a look that only a married couple would understand “-but you have to understand where he’s coming from, you spent the entire sixth year stalking him because you thought he was up to something nefarious and now you’re telling us that you meet up with him on purpose to help students which is noble and i can see why that would be important to you, but it’s still Malfoy” Hermione said, she had her teacher voice on, kind but firm, usually only reserved for when Harry, Ron or someone at work were being an idiot and she couldn’t say it outright.
“Hey, are you ok?” Harry asked softly, looking for any sign of recognition in his eyes, Malfoy looked up at Harry, first he looked at him like a soft, scared child, then he recognized Harry and all his softness turned into fear, he pulled away and his pale face grew beet red.
“No of course not, that would be way too predictable and you’d get bored of me” Harry said, knocking Malfoys shoulder with his own. which elicited a small laugh from the blonde, he mumbled something Harry couldn’t quite make out but part of it sounded oddly like “sodding gryffindors”
“Not that you idiot, like which professor you are, we had a lot of defence professors, do you wonder who you resemble? we only ever had snape or slughorn, out of those two i truly hope i’m Snape” Malfoy paused, seemingly trying to choose his next words carefully and Harry was clinging to every one of  them “Not that i try to be like Snape, He was brilliant at Potions, not the best with the students, so sometimes i worry, am i too much too much like him? what if i was some kids boggart” malfoy finally looked at Harry, with the same broken eyes as when he’d had his panic attack, Harry looked up to the ceiling, absentmindedly checking for a splotch of yellow, “i don’t think you’re like him, he was… he could seem so hateful, like he would rather be anywhere else, dealing with anyone else, well i haven’t seen you teach but i know you care about them and i don’t think that even you could hide that” Malfoy looked at him quizzingly, seeming lighter that before “What do you mean even me?” he asked, “Well i don’t think that even you, Malfoy Master of hiding his emotions, could hide affection” Malfoy just snorted in a way that was very unlike a malfoy, but then was there a way to snort elegantly? Harry supposed not, Malfoy looked at Harry in a way that almost read if only you knew, everything suddenly seemed all too close, Malfoy especially. Neither spoke again, Harry was sure Malfoy could feel Harry’s pounding heart and all Harry wished was to know why, none of today had made any sense,
“Could i get you some tea?” Harry was very unsure of what to do with himself, what was the proper etiquette for when your former rival now coworker showed up at your door at 7pm?
“I don’t… He was in love with my mum for a lot of years”
What he’d probably never get used to was seeing Draco sodding Malfoy everyday, he’d been hired two years after the war which meant he had 3 years on Harry as a teacher, which was just brilliant. For the past two weeks he’d done everything to avoid the other and aside from meals and passing the halls whilst getting ready for classes to start he’d succeeded, that is of course until Apollo decided to take a wander about the castle (don’t worry, he used the halls like a proper snake, not the pipes like uncivilized folk)
“You are just a hero aren’t you?” he let out a weak laugh but his face quickly fell but this time it was deeper than earlier, it was sadder, “would you actually want that? to work with me on this i mean?”
“Lawrence Taylor, uh sir. I wanted to know, How did you uhh… survive, you know the uhh curse?” He held his head up, showing that famous Gryffindor courage, It was a question he’d been asked many times before so he had a perfectly crafted cover, it wasn’t exactly a lie but telling the world that Harry himself had been a horcrux was not something he was keen on.
“Helping me with this whole thing, I just mean, I’m confused, you’ve changed obviously but it’s still weird seeing you working so hard with ulterior motives” Harry said, palms sweaty, scared he’d just ruined his one shot at befriending his old rival.
Of bloody course! Of all living things to run into, it had to be Malfoy, maybe he should just wander into the forbidden forest and see if he was lucky enough to get trampled by a wild stampede of centaurs.
And Harry had to pick up his jaw and remember to clap, he shot a look over to Malfoy to see his reaction, but it was a stone cold and emotionless as usual, he clapped politely, what Harry suspected was so because he had to rather than wanting to. No signs that he was as amused by the female Malfoy being sorted into Gryffindor as Harry was.
The next few days flew by, wake up and chat with Apollo about what parts of the castle he was planning to explore that day, get ready, breakfast and then classes, grading and preparations for the day to follow, supper and then meet with Malfoy. It was nice to have a routine again, and seeing Malfoy everyday wasn’t as weird anymore. Sure they weren’t friends and probably never would be but they were civil now, Harry had sort of expected Malfoy to tire of him and barge out, only to never talk again except for staff meetings but that hadn’t happened yet.
They bought it 2 years post hogwarts, saved like hell and ended up with a quaint cottage just outside hogsmeade, it wasn’t much but like the burrow the place was overflowing with warmth and the feel of home, like if the burrow and an old library had had a weird 2 story 3 bedroom stone cottage as a baby.
When they both walked back into the classroom and both Adler and Dugal’s head shot down into their respective books, clearly pretending they had been working and definitely not talking whilst the teachers were in the other room, they looked after Malfoy as he walked out and when the door had closed behind him they looked expectantly at Harry who’d sat down in the meantime.
“yeah sure we dan do that, was there anything else? because i’m scared those two will burn the classroom down if i leave them be for two long” to Harry's surprise Malfoy laughed, it wasn’t like a big cackle just a small laugh but it was real, Harry didn’t think he’d ever actually heard Malfoy before, unless it was at his expense and those always sounded laced with evil intent.
“Would you stop? this is hardly your fault i never told  you i didn’t like snakes so this is hardly your fault” Malfoy said, pulling Harry out of his shame spiral, Ok ok, Harry couldn’t have known so what now, Well first calm down, He’s no good to anyone  if he’s panicking too, ok calm, next, talk to Malfoy and figure out he needs and then have a stern talking to to Apollo that he is to stay away from Malfoy no matter how interesting he smells.
“You saved me from azkaban, Potter I don’t think there’s anything more you can do”
“you’re Harry Potter, The Harry Potter” a young boy with flat light brown hair and a hufflepuff tie called out. Harry was used to it,he had to be but i didn’t make it any less annoying.
“Why are you doing this Malfoy?” he said
“I’m going over my lessons plans for later today, school is starting you know” Harry leaned back to look up at Apollo,
“Good? good what” a small layer of amusement was hiding beneath his layer of indifference, his left eyebrow quirked up ever so slightly, trying hard not to show his amusement at Harry’s clear embarrassment, HArrywas fumbling with the hems of his navy jumper,
Thanks for reading this :) This is the first thing i've actually decided to write, anything else i've written has always been a one off, but this i keep coming back to so that's hopefully something.
“no, of course you didn't, no one does” anger still present in his voice, this time he however sounded much sadder or maybe just lost, Harry couldn’t tell.
“Yess yess, i know”  and with that Apollo slithered off to Harry’s private chambers. And with that, Harrywas left to lonesome with only a few lesson plans to get done, it was night time before he knew it and he scurried off to have supper. It was once again uneventful, no one paid him much attention, he mainly listened as Neville talked about repotting some mandrakes and his plans for the following day as well as McGonagall’s brief speech that they were about to enter yet another glorious year at hogwarts and that they should welcome the students the next morning with loving arms, and with that he headed back to his office.
and no one else.
Arlen stepped out, turning around to hold open the doors. “Whatever you’re going to say to him, Draco, he doesn’t deserve it. They say he’s lost his mind. Your words are wasted on the likes of him. He’s just some washed up wizard with a broken mind now. He’s a monster and he doesn’t deserve any kindness, especially from you.”
time!
Arlen conjured a gel-like substance from the tip of his wand, slowly coating Draco’s stomach in the viscous fluid as he let his wand hover back and forth over his stomach.
To think some hormones and a little slick between the thighs could
The heavy black drapes on the tall windows were slightly parted, letting him see that it was now dark out.
As he scanned the scribbled words on the page, they started to blur, his mind drifting back to Draco.
Draco pulled back; his thoughts momentarily cohesive when Harry’s words penetrated his haze of lust.
,” she lowered her voice, “
Jack stared at him, his eyes assessing.
, can you please help me to, to—I can’t—”
Draco wondered for the millionth time that night what the hell he was doing.
When Harry felt Draco’s cum spurt hotly on his abdomen, he let out a low snarl and began to desperately fuck into his rabbit. He wanted to shoot his cum deep into the boy’s womb, get him pregnant with his litter, needing to—
parents
He looked up finally, meeting Harry’s gaze. “P-please, just
Harry had instructed him to conceal the collar and not to mention it to the Healer who was visiting today.
She waved her hand in the air noncommittally. “All right, darling. I didn’t mean to sound pushy. If you ask me, I think you both need a nap. You look completely knackered, Draco.”
Harry stared down at his Omega, struck momentarily mute by Draco’s words.
Harry grabbed his chin with his fingers and tilted his head up. “You’ll beg for it, Draco. You will beg for me to fuck you and when you do, I’ll make sure to make you
, something within Harry had crumbled.
They both stood in front of Harry’s Floo, having just returned from Malfoy Manor. Harry was still holding their sleeping pup, Scorpius snuffling noisily against the scent gland on Harry’s neck as he snoozed.
He followed them into the drawing room and watched as Draco adjusted his pup in his arms, reaching out with one hand. “My bag, please.”
“I’ve got an idea, little one. Why don’t you
Harry didn’t know why he couldn’t fully commit to Ginny. She was beautiful, smart, and kind, but Harry still felt...reluctant.
Harry promptly leaned forward, pressing his opened mouth to the boy’s hole. He licked at the reddened rim, slick and the faint tang of the boy’s blood evident on his tongue as he lapped.
Just like Sirius’ portrait.
? I said to bring them the wine, not attract the attention of most skeevy Alpha in attendance!”
The first being that he was a bloody fool. He was a fool to think that Draco could love him back. The boy had done nothing but run away every time he thought they were making progress. It seemed the only thing Draco desired from him was his cock. The only use Draco had for Harry, was what he could do sexually for him.
Harry sat across from him at the table, eyeing Draco with detached interest. “I’m afraid it’s gone cold since Kreacher prepared it this morning. You were throwing one of your stubborn fits, refusing to eat.”
“I don’t care, fuck whoever you want—“ his voice caught, unable to finish his sentence.
He pressed closer to Harry, their bodies becoming flush. He grabbed the lapels of Harry’s jacket and shook his head.
Warm fingers brushed against the nape of his neck, making shivers break out over his over-heated skin.
Harry stood suddenly, walking around the table to stand in front of him. Draco had to crane his neck to look up at him, fighting the intense urge to fall into his arms.
He pulled back and clenched his jaw at the sight before him.
I'm back.
“Time for a nap, love,” he said softly, pressing a kiss to Scorpius’ forehead.
No one needed to know. Maybe one day Scorpius would ask, but he would cross that bridge when he came to it.
Draco had been clutching his pup to his chest, smiling warmly down at him as he suckled.
Harry shuddered, feeling undiluted pleasure at Draco’s words.
As a claimed Omega, he wouldn’t be able to injure his Alpha. His instincts wouldn’t allow it.
Harry promptly bent and picked him up, carrying the boy to the tub. He carefully stepped into the water, lowering them both down. Harry moved his tail to the side and sat, pulling the boy between his legs so that his back was pressed to his front.
The boy had eaten the kibble Harry had given him with no qualms. He felt bad that the boy had to have a meal fit for an animal, but it was all he had for the night.
Harry shook his head. “I wouldn’t do that to you while you’re in heat, Draco. I promise you; we didn’t have sex. When you finally fell asleep, I took you back to my home. I was just worried about leaving you alone. I couldn’t just…
“Want Mummy,” Scorpius whined, reaching for him between them.
With Harry’s earlier dejected expression and Narcissa’s seeking gaze burning a hole through his heart, he cleared his throat.
“Anything you want to talk about, Harry?”
Harry’s fingers tightened on Draco’s arm.
Roland stood by the entrance to the bathroom, surprise flickering over his handsome features.
it and not out of instinctual necessity.
baby…
Harry suddenly squeezed his breast, making Draco gasp. “I don’t want you to fucking mention him again. Especially when I’m touching you.”
Draco pressed the back of his hand against his mouth, screwing his eyes shut as Harry rubbed his saliva against his nipple, coating the hardened bud and his areola. Harry accidentally pressed too hard, a dribble of milk spurting from Draco’s nipple and wetting his fingers with the warm fluid.
“Toffee?” Draco asked bemusedly.
”Okay, darling, but please hurry. They’ll be here soon and I’m sure they’ll have a plethora of questions.”
“Yes. Your parents were Death Eaters. I know she never told you about her past or your father’s past, but I will tell you this: they were murderers. They were loyal to the man that killed my parents.”
Harry grimaced internally, feeling guilty for some unknown reason.
Harry wrapped his arms around the boy, pulling him closer. “Feel good, sweetheart?”
Draco blushed and closed his eyes, turning his head away. “S-stop it,
Harry strode across the room, quickly closing the distance between them. “You’re in pain…” he said softly, reaching up to gently tug one of Draco’s arms from his chest.
At the sound of Harry’s voice, Scorpius roused. He snuffled against Draco’s chest for a moment before realizing his nipple was no longer exposed.
good boy
”You’ll be back to stalk me in the morning?” Draco asked flatly.
Draco had never seen his mother so frazzled. She was usually kempt and refined, but her white-blonde hair was in disarray, tendrils of it hanging loose from her chignon and dangling limply around her wan face.
He felt the need to stay alert and to
Something had been irreparably damaged within him. Something he didn’t know he if he could ever be able to fix.
Draco stepped forward, wrapping his arms around Harry’s middle and looking up at him.
He let out a short, relieved sigh, casting a small smile in Harry’s direction before continuing. “That’s not all we wanted to talk to you about, Mum.”
“Well, if what Harry’s said is true, he’ll be released from St Mungo’s upon recovery and he’ll be free to do as he pleases. He’s now seventeen, legally an adult, so he needs no one to care for him. I thought that by releasing him into the care of Mr. Potter, he would be safe and cared for. It seems I might have been wrong about that,” Kingsley paused, his eyes hardening. “
Hermione raised a brow. “Unaware of? Ron, whatever this about, can it wait? Draco is at St Mungo’s and he needs us there. He needs
Draco came with a hoarse shout, his cum spurting from his slit and splattering on his swollen tits and hitting Harry on the jaw.
the way to having a mate.
He could have used the Floo, but wanted to check on his Aurors that were stationed outside the home.
,” he answered hollowly. “It wasn’t.”
boy,” Harry praised breathlessly.
Draco cast Harry a look of disbelief. “You’re mad! I-I can’t fit that inside of me!”
Harry took Draco’s hand closest to him and raised it to his lips, pressing a quick kiss to the back of his pale skin. “I’ll eat anything you make, sweetheart. Who is watching Scorpius?”
Draco spit on his face, resentment burning in the gray depths of his eyes. “I’d never
Narcissa cast him an apologetic look, her hands folded primly in her lap.
He stubbed it out in his ashtray, raising a brow when Kreacher appeared next to him.
