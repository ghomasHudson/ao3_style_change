That didn't stop him from staring at Malfoy, however. He was also finally convinced by his two best friends that he liked Malfoy, which was a fact that Harry tried with little effort to avoid. Harry couldn't help but always look towards the Slytherin table whenever he was in the Great Hall, his eyes falling over and over again on the blonde boy sitting further away from the rest of his housemates looking so pitiable.
Harry leaned against the railing, letting his eyes close when he heart soft padded footsteps very near him. The pair of silver eyes illuminating the dark was unmistakable.
Harry shrugged it off. "It's fine. Sirius once said the ones that love us never really leave us. I know they will always be with me, and I know that now my mom, dad, Sirius and Remus are all reunited and that makes me happy." Harry paused, then muttered quite inaudibly, "Although I would love if they could provide me with some advice on boys."
That somehow reminded Harry of how Sirius used to describe his time with Remus on the Astronomy tower, stargazing and just simply enjoying their time together. Harry looked at Draco, a small smile playing on his lips. He imagined Sirius and Remus looking down proudly at him. Harry turned his attention back at the Sirius star and he could have sworn that he never saw it glow brighter than at that very moment.
Harry remained quiet and still for a moment -- he was not sure why -- before saying, "I couldn't sleep. You?"
Malfoy rolled into his side so that he was facing Harry, his eyelashes fluttering open. Harry turned his back to Malfoy hurriedly but he knew that Malfoy had saw him staring, like many many many other times. Harry's face turned red as he heard a very soft and light chuckle from behind him. It could just be the most beautiful thing Harry had ever heard.
"Potter," the boy nodded his head slightly to acknowledge the presence of Harry. "What are you doing here?"
"Um hi," Harry said nervously and started to regret it. Oh, why in Salazar's name did he made the decision to talk to his nemesis?
"It reminds me of Sirius, and Remus. I have heard that when they were younger, they used to come here." Harry shrugged. "I can see his star as well."
Like many other times, Malfoy seemed to sense someone looking at him and he slowly brought his head up, locking eyes with the now familiar green eyes that kept looking at him. Harry snapped his head towards Ron and Hermione, pretending to be talking to them while moving his lips soundlessly, unknowingly mouthing the words: his eyes are fucking beautiful.
Harry let out a deep sigh and raised his head towards the night sky. The Sirius star was shining as brightly as ever. How Harry wished Sirius -- or Remus -- were alive so Harry could talk to them about Malfoy, seeing as his godfather and Remus were in love with each other.
Draco looked at him. "I still think you should choose someone better. What would everyone think if they saw you with a death eater like me?"
"I could ask you the same question," Harry stared at Malfoy, taking this chance to memorise every inch of that beautiful face.
Harry pushed himself off the ground. He had the impression it was longer than 'a while', which made him happy, but commented nothing on that. "So, Draco, would you be my boyfriend?"
Malfoy didn't say anything. He just hesitantly sat down a little away from Harry, which Harry took as that his presence did not affect the Slytherin. They were both quiet, enjoying the serenity the Astronomy Tower provides, before Malfoy broke the silence, startling Harry.
Harry's heart ached to see Malfoy in this manner, being treated like a nobody by many in the school, being drowned in a pool of loneliness, regret and guilt. Harry considered going over, but almost immediately deciding against it. He thought that going over would only bring Malfoy more humiliation as Harry had also helped to testify for Malfoy before.
"Shut up," Harry said, blushing, without a single malice in his voice. "You still haven't answered my question."
"Oh. 's no problem." Fuck his heart. It was beating so quickly. Harry slowly lowered himself so that he's lying on the floor and staring into the night sky. He softly hummed a tune before he turned to see that Malfoy had laid down as well. The boy had closed his eyes.
Harry found his eyes yet again drifting across the room to where a blonde sat, silently focusing on whatever the professor was saying. Harry knew that things had not be going to well for Malfoy and his family after the war and that knowledge saddened Harry a little.
"I've told you, I do not have a-" Harry stopped short when the professor glared at him and Ron both before continuing the lesson.
Harry stared at the beautiful blonde across the room. These few months he can't seem to get a certain boy out of his head. He was sure he never felt anything like that about him before the war ended. He recognized this feeling- it's similar to what he felt for Ginny before they broke up. But it can't be. Can it?
Ollie, I think it's funny though that you mentioned going back in time to tell yourself Draco would be singing love songs to the two of us while we danced and cried. Because I have always told myself I would love to go back in time and tell Little Harry in the Cupboard about how full of love his life would be someday. And Draco should go back and tell Scared Draco in the Closet that some day his home would be his own again, no more monsters allowed within the walls, every meter of the Manor full of love and laughter. So now you want to go back and tell .... Ollie in the Locker Room? That the scrawny messy haired kid on your team would some day take the blonde prat we just beat at quidditch and force you to fall in love with them both.
Anyway, that's tomorrow off your paperwork schedule. And Saturday won't be spent reviewing resumes either. That's the big April birthday celebration! Our April birthday list isn't quite as extensive as March (Holy Hell does our family like to get busy in June!) but we'll be celebrating six birthdays. Misha, Eri, Ori, Teddy, and Seph. And don't forget Kisa. Despite the fact that we mostly hold this party for the 'kid' birthdays, Kisa has told us in no uncertain terms that when it comes to celebrating her, she is Peter Pan-ing it with eternal youth.
Instead, I relied on very muggle methods such as life jackets. I even resisted the temptation to cast any sort of charms when I had Mr. Lott rent us a small sea plane so that he could continually take us up and let us sky dive over the island. The only time I had to cast a spell of any sort was when Zaire got knocked off his surf board by a rough wave and ended up getting water in his lungs. He managed to get back on his board just fine, just couldn't breathe, so I had to cast a spell to expel the water from his lungs and make sure that he was otherwise fine, which he was and was impatient to get back to surfing.
I am so sorry I didn't write you back last night. I know you have so many of our kids quarantined with you, and you're enjoying your anime, and you're not lonely per se. But I know that you are definitely missing your husbands. Your husbands who are missing you frantically but at least have each other during this time. I even promised you would have loving words from me for you to see before you went to sleep for the night.
Well, according to my brain, I could wake up at 7:00 A.M. while those loves are sleeping away, and get ready for the day. Thanks for that, you douchebag brain!
You continued with the most beautiful proposal I've ever heard, "Harry Malfoy, I thought I loved you, now I know I will love you the rest of my days. I hoped we could make this work, now I know it will work and I look forward to every day with you in my arms and my life. You are the Husband, Friend, Partner that I don't truly believe I deserve, but am selfish enough to keep anyway. Would you make those same vows to me again, stay married to me, choose me again a year later?"
We finally had to break down and sit on a loveseat rather than you in a chair and me on a cushion on the floor with my head in your lap. This way, we were still able to snuggle, but we were also able to hold our babies and Viona when she felt like sitting with us. She's taking full advantage of the fact that she has a big sister now by sitting on Elena and demanding to be fed as if Elena was a house elf meant to serve her, but Elena is a rather responsible big sister, not giving into the demands for biscuits and ice cream, offering melon and apple slices instead.
Since I am ALSO crocheting and zoning out to Netflix, I haven't really been thinking about much of anything else, simply basking in the joy of having my very own craft room for the first time in my life. That means that my habit of posting about an hour after I wake up has suffered since part of my wake up ritual these days is to make a cup of tea to sip on while I crochet and watch a docuseries (I've watched Secrets of British Castles and Warrior Women in the past three or four days, lol). Thus, by the time I am awake and would normally post, I'm so caught up in what I'm doing that I forget.
But even though I'm able to get back to a healthier frame of mind in just a few minutes, after the third one, I started to feel depressed in a whole other way. For our entire marriage so far, I'VE been the one that cherishes the babies. I love getting up with them at night and sleeping in with them during the morning. I love snuggling with them and knowing that there's still a good decade before I have to worry about the teen years.
I was thinking about a small version of a regular golf course, but if you'd prefer a mini golf course - I had to look that up and it does sound fun - then that's what we'll have. And by scandalizing the baby Peafowl, I meant by shagging all over the estate, but if you'd like to simply play naked, we can do that too. My mother will stay out of our way and turn a blind eye should she happen to accidentally witness anything. My father might vomit; I'm quite looking forward to winding him up about it.
I'm getting better with Persephone though. Now she's pretty much needy like a newborn as opposed to preemie levels of neediness. I think she's done much better since Lily and Caelum got here. They're pretty much always snuggled up together, either packed in side by side in one bassinet, lain together where Jaz and Zaire can poke at them, or cuddled into my and your arms. I think much of Seph's fussiness was needing the rest of her set! Also, I think she's just going to be a fussy one. She's all Malfoy. She may have my hair, but as her main personality trait is wanting exactly what she wants exactly when she wants it, I am going to say her soul is Malfoy all the way.
Oh. When he stood straighter and didn't walk away, I assumed this was going somewhere different. "That's completely fine mate, but if you're not going to join or watch, I really do have to ask that you let us get back to things. The idea of playing with someone I've crushed on since I was old enough to know what my dick was for has gotten me a bit desperate!"
I'm quite nervous to meet River's grandparents. How do you think they sounded in their responses? I know they're grieving their daughter, you don't think they'll try to take River do you? What if they don't want him anywhere near me? I tend to bring trouble everywhere I go!
After she came down a bit from the orgasm Blaise gave her, I couldn't help but want to give her another, so I used some of my impressive oral skills on her, making her whimper, whine, and beg before squealing so loudly that everyone in the club paused to look over to find out why.
I think we're going to watch Inside Out tonight. One of those good movies that is bright and silly enough for the little kids to enjoy but with actual emotions and a story-line that will keep the older people entertained as well.
Whew, need to get my mind off of all these emotions. I am going to have bright red eyes for our joint therapy session. I know I will cry while we are in there, I don't need to start off looking bloodshot and sniffling!
Corbin sighed. "I'm afraid he'll say he don't love me anymore, and worse, maybe he'll leave me for her."
And um, so, huh. Well, ok. So here's the thing. Those weeks where I barely saw you because you were out saving the world, I would get all of the kids to bed, and wait up hoping you would come home soon, and you didn't always come home particularly soon. So, I took to um, "researching" some things that we may want to try. Not that I don't think we have a very full and very satisfying and very extensive sex life. We definitely don't need to spice things up. But, I also know how much you love pushing my limits and introducing new ideas. So, there are some ideas I heard about that I would be willing to... discuss? Attempt?
So, when it came time for the drumming, when the five of us stood up and shed our Hogwarts robes, we *also* stripped off our uniforms and underwear. Most of the parents followed suit, and each child was told very very clearly that they had permission and thus *could* strip off, but did not *have* to if they didn't want to. There were large baskets set aside to hold the jumble of clothes so that they weren't just laying on the ground getting trod on, and house elves would be sorting through them so that they could be folded and magically available to their owners when they wanted to get dressed again. Of the students, most started off fully clothed but shed things as the night progressed and they felt more comfortable with the nudity. Or perhaps they were simply *uncomfortable* in their clothes at that point.
Harry initially planned to stay quiet, dismissing Malfoy's annoyingly accurate assumptions, but he suddenly blurted out, "Why not you?"
"Yeah. I don't see why not, considering I like you too." Harry leaned down and the two shared another kiss with Harry smiling against Draco's lips. When they pulled away, green eyes looked into silver ones and silver eyes looked into green ones, both pair of eyes twinkling with excitement and happiness. Harry honestly had never seen such joy in Draco before.
Harry shook his head, and before he knew it, started rambling to Luna about a Slytherin boy. Luna smiled and nodded her head, providing a listening ear for Harry while he talked. He liked Luna's presence and felt that he could share things with her. It reminded him of when he used to talk with Sirius.
Harry kept quiet, not correcting Malfoy's mistake of only a few weeks. He felt as if Malfoy could read him just by looking him in the eye and it made Harry-
Hogwarts at night was eerily quiet, Harry can't help but feel like something bad is going to happen even though Voldemort was already dead and most death eaters were already captured by Aurors. He made his way to the Astronomy tower where he felt comfort and solace.
"Okay, okay, I get it," Ron grumbled. "Just never thought it'd be the ferret boy who captured your heart."
Malfoy's sneer slowly disappeared, replaced by a look of faint disbelief. "Why do you even care?" Malfoy said quietly before stalking off, oblivious to the hurt on Harry's face.
As he walked through the busy corridor with Ron and Hermione towards Potions class, Harry no doubt caught sight of Malfoy looking lonely and friendless. A wave of sympathy and sadness washed over Harry as he walked towards the blonde boy, leaving Ron and Hermione raising their eyebrows.
Quite suddenly, Malfoy jerked his head up and his silver grey eyes fell upon Harry's green ones. Harry immediately turned away and pretended to write something the professor had said, his cheeks turning slightly pink. Yet he could see from the corner of his eye Malfoy looking at him suspiciously.
"Same reason as well." Malfoy stood awkwardly. He obviously did not expect that there would be someone else at the Astronomy tower.
There was another silence, but Harry somehow knew Malfoy was thinking about saying something, so he kept quiet. He wasn't wrong.
With James Potter's blood inside him, Harry automatically listed out all the things he loved liked about Malfoy, saying them carefully and slowly so that he was sure Malfoy absorbed in every word. After he said everything, he seemed to realise what he had just said and was glowing with embarrassment.
"You can sit, you know? You don't need to stand," Harry gestured to the many vacant spots. "Just pretend I'm not here. If my presence bothers you too much I can just go to the Black Lake." Harry said the last part a little more slowly.
” Every day, he was avoiding the journalists, desperate for a picture of him to the point they were coming into the Muggle’s world. Every day, the Ministry of Magic was trying to recruit him and every day he had to refuse. Every day he was recognized in the streets and every day he had to walk away. He was tired to the point he has no energy to even answer all the messages his friends left him on his phone. He felt trapped, trapped in his skin. Being who he was, even his name felt like it was not belonging to him. “
” He was appreciating this sonority in his mouth. He knew that he probably will never pronounce it again. Draco couldn’t help but look at him with a different look than what he used to. He was looking at each detail of his face, so different from the pictures, and so similar at the same time. He almost closed his eyes when he heard his old enemy call him by his name. He has felt so many emotions through his voice, and none of them was positive. But he still felt an irrational joy hearing him pronounce his name. Grabbing the hand that was given to him, he felt the warmth of Potter’s hand under his. He then felt the strong grip of the Gryffindor around his wrist, following the
Leaving his phone on the couch, he woke up and walked into the bathroom. Hermione’s message has cut him into his work, but he was struggling to focus anyways. Since he encountered Draco in the streets, he has started to look for any clue about the existence of other Death Eaters. But an ethical question kept bothering him. If he found other followers of Voldemort he would report them to the Ministry of Magic. But then, he probably should report Malfoy too. But he did not want to. He wanted the wizard to be at his mercy. He wanted to make him pay, to make him truly regret what he did. He wanted to turn his life into a nightmare. At least… It was what he tried to convince himself of. But all he wanted, truly, were answers. He would never be able to hurt him on purpose. He even saved his life during the battle. Would he like him to feel all that Harry felt himself? No. He could never wish that, even to his worse enemy. What Sirius told him popped in his mind. “
” He was staring at him, perfectly aware that he was being hurtful in purpose. But after all, Draco Malfoy was one of the reasons he suffered so much.
” It was a groan. Looking around him, at the mess he just created, the destruction, the pieces of glass, illustrating how he was feeling. He felt just like this vase. Teared up to pieces, not being able to collect feelings anymore, as this vase could never hold water again. And he did it to himself. With the way, he lived his life. The way he started it. The way he chose to cope with his trauma. “
He remembers the day like it was yesterday, sunny and bright, Draco grinning so wide as he jumped out of the car and kissed Harry's cheeks over and over.
Draco turned back to Wilson and continued. "The interns have been leaking the case information to the Aurors since we first opened it, which is why he would’ve gone after Robards instead of Sullivan. It’s further removed, attracts less suspicion. Now, what do we know about the case?" Draco flicked his hand and the Mortem case records crowded around him in a ring of legal papers.
Draco turned to look at Harry across the half of a pillow in between them. "You never said you wanted to quit the Aurors."
Draco leaned back in his seat and huffed. “Yes, well, I’ve had a fair amount of time to think about it.”
Harry tells them he’s Draco’s partner. They tell him in serious voices that they checked Draco over, and he might have a mild concussion, but he’s going to be okay. Harry nearly faints with relief.
He nodded to the woman behind the guest counter. Her hair looked nicer today. He kissed Harry on the cheek before they got off on their different floors on the elevator.
” He did not answer at first. His eyes spending a little second more than they should have on these lips, tempting him to touch them. And then, he looked into the deep green eyes. This was the color he searched all this time. All he tried to find, looking at paintings, flowers, all the beautiful things, it was here, in these eyes looking at him with animosity, but Draco couldn’t wish for anything more beautiful. He knew that if he didn’t turn his look away, he would never. Taking a fake disgusted look, he tore himself away from this contemplation, swiping the soft grip off his face. “
Clenching his jaw in response to the awful feeling of regret and remorse he was feeling. He drove his glare back to the gray paved floor.
And he did not understand why the brown-haired men frowned, seeming to disagree with him, his eyes so serious but his voice still amused. “
” He said it with a colder voice he intended to, but with his old enemy, there was no need to fake it. He dragged him into a smaller street, there, they could talk without being interrupted. His glare over the
Harry could not hear what Draco said, but he was able to see the trouble in his eyes. Noticing how close he was from his old enemy, he stepped back, without noticing the point of disappointment in Malfoy’s eyes. The distance felt safe. Clearing his throat, he shoved his hands in the pockets of his long brown coat. They were almost dressed the same, that could have been funny if it did not disturb Harry so much. He could feel the tension between them, the same that has always existed but slightly different now. Maybe it was because of Malfoy, maybe it was because of Harry. He couldn’t know, but he felt that something has changed. And it was making him prodigiously annoyed. Cutting the moment, he decided to move. He felt trapped in this little alley, he needed air, he needed to walk away and not to stay alone with his old enemy.
wherever he dragged him. But the familiar fear took him again. Where were they going? Was Potter bringing him to the Ministry of Magic? He was probably an Auror now.
The street Malfoy lived in was small, filled with humidity and dark. Harry thought immediately about a trap. After all, even if Malfoy seemed to regret what he did, maybe he was
” His voice seemed tired, different than what it sounded like a few minutes ago. But since they were both lost in their thoughts, Harry imagined that he must have been remembering some uneasy memories too. “
A few hours later, Harry heard someone knocking at his door. When he opened it, he felt a body jumping on him, so fast that he did not see who it was. “
And I created a twitter to vent about fanfictions and stuff so if you want to follow me it's @3am_magic !
Gryffindors. Now, here he was, avoiding the slightest eye contact with any of these muggles, terrified that one of them would be a sorcerer, recognizing his father trough him. His mother has asked him to go live on his own, far from her, since the name of Malfoy was now a disgrace. The cold streets of London were only reminding him of this loneliness, his only companion, ironically.
He was not moving the slightest bit, afraid of the answer. The confused look on Potter’s face did not help him to relax. “
” Harry raised an eyebrow, surprised by how Malfoy was thinking. It was funny to see how he was following the same path as his father. Faking a normal life, despite all he had done. How could Harry not hate such a person? It was just impossible.
” He was thinking about their first meeting, when he was still innocent, sort of. He was thinking about all the times they encountered, at Hogwarts, in Diagon Alley. About today. He fell to the ground, his legs becoming weak. All the memories he was trying to hold back every day were hitting him. All the loved ones he lost. All the friends who got hurt. All the wizards impacted by this story. He could not blame everything on Malfoy, of course, but he was feeling so much anger towards him. Because he had made all the wrong choices. Because if it would not have been for him, Dumbledore would have been there, helping Harry. But now, there were only memories. And Harry could only suffer, alone. He did not want to talk about this to his friends, why bother? It was irreparable.
Zaire pet her thoughtfully, smiling at her - which also shocked everyone who had been around him since he came in.
"I have an enthusiastic rookie named Henley performing a search of any database he can to see if our victim is in there somewhere," Bletchley informed me.
I absolutely loved your beautiful song/poem. You are amazing, you are being held in custody and choose to spend your time composing beautiful words for me. How on Earth did I get so lucky as to marry you?
And better yet, Miles and Sammy! They're due here any minute, NOT that we've let any of the kids know that. I completely agree with your thoughts on Lilo and Stitch. Our family may be big and impossibly mad, but it's still the best family in the world because it's ours and we made it with our hands and hearts.
"True," I admitted, sort of proud of myself that I hadn't thought to go that route first. I liked the idea of trying this on my own, for some reason. "Alright, my question is sort of complicated. My father recently found out that he had a child with a woman named Gina Mitchell - "
She shook her head. "In a family like this - in which we go out of our way to adopt kids because we have so much love to give - do you REALLY think I want to cast a spell to prevent the smallest POSSIBILITY of a baby?"
She can't have been hurt by her exposure so far seeing as her conception and incubation were one hundred percent magical in nature. She lived for nine months inside of a magical person and came out perfect. I want her to be happy and healthy. I don't want to settle for her being "fine" but it's good to know she's been exposed for her entire existence and she is most definitely completely fine.
He's saying: "Once upon a time, there was a man who wanted a baby more than anything, except no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't have one. So, instead, he decided that he could love little kids that needed him. He adopted two little ones and raised them with all of his heart.
Harry, I really think you wanted to distract me and stop me from singing any other such songs to you, because you tried very hard to remove my clothes and initiate a loving and intense round of shagging, but aside from letting you strip me off, I slipped out of your grasp with a shake of my head.
As for Viper, he was giving Tiger a look that was clearly PRAYING for the man to accidentally fall asleep or take a calming potion or something. I think he might have even been contemplating transporting an entire brick of weed directly into Tiger's stomach.
See now, VIONA is the perfect age to take the potion! She just turned 11, so she can go to Hogwarts, but will stay 11 and more interested in learning than in kissing until she graduates.
And last night it hit me. I was wondering how your muggle community center was coming along, and bam! What if we created a (smaller) version of Disneyworld's Epcot? Some sort of museum or cultural center in the magical community. Those with families who've documented and kept up their traditions, like the Patils having visited India and being well versed in their traditions. But, people like me who literally don't even know where the Potters originally came from. I mean, I'm olive toned but from the UK. I don't exactly have the traditional pale British complexion. Where are my people from?
And as much as Viona has so many qualities of her big sister that she adores, little Drake is so much like his big brother River. I'm honestly not surprised that River isn't particularly interested in going to Hogwarts. He wants to be surrounded by his family, and he wants the freedom to do what he wants during the day, and learn his lessons at his speed and with one on one teaching. He was the oldest child in our bed for the longest time, and he certainly wasn't the first one out! That was Viona who just decided one day she wanted her own room and her own space and "Daddy give it to me." But River and Drake want to be with us, spend time with their family, and talk everyone's ear off. I think you want to blame Pippa's influence on his incessant talking, but you and I both know he comes by it quite naturally.
Feeling full to bursting with love, I staggered my way to the stables, where Oliver was playing with the kids as they all cared for the animals. He took one look at me, smirked at the fact that my hair was apparently as wild as yours normally is, and then came over to claim a few kisses from me.
“Wait WHAT?!” Other Draco blurted out in alarm, not used to anyone flirting with him so heavily. Or even lightly, come to think of it.
The both of you had the foresight to go beforehand, and so, didn't feel the need to come with me. I had to stand in a bit of a line (in case you were wondering what took so long). After about five minutes of the line moving at a decent enough pace, a twink emerged from the loo that caught my eye, and only part of it was that he had his hair died my favorite shade of metallic blue. The rest of it was that he was bloody gorgeous.
Oh fuck. Maybe I'd rather have Viona yelling at me instead of these calm scary questions from your mum. "Mum, I love you, but you greatly exaggerate my ability to tell your son what to do. HE wanted to go undercover, HE wanted to try the damsel curse to help him come to terms with the undercover situation, and while I may have suggested the playtime, it was only because I didn't think my ridiculously gay self gave him what he needed the first time. When we found out about the pregnancies, I gave him my opinion and my preferences, but I started every conversation reminding him it was HIS body, HIS decision, and no choice he could make would change my love for him."
P.S. Before I forget again, I finally managed to arrange for Lena to get her punishment for drugging me up and having her way with me. I went to the prison she's being kept in and used a bit of subtle magic to persuade her jailers that she deserved a conjugal visit for Christmas from her husband (who's actually trying to decide if he should divorce her or give her another chance and has simply been too busy at work to truly think about it yet). The reason I did this was so that I could cast a syphilis curse on him so he'd pass it to her during the visit. The curse will ensure that she receives the disease from him (and I've used a bit of magic on him to ensure that he'll want to get intimate during said visit). I chose Syphilis because it's a disease that *could* potentially lead to a messy death if untreated, but has a treatment that can cure it. Thus, her fate will ultimately be determined by the system she's in and whether or not they catch and treat the disease. As for her poor husband, I'll send him an anonymous tip that he has the disease so that he can get it treated right away. No need for him to die for HER crime.
Well apparently, we never actually put up a muggle repelling charm, and so, the wards we have are all magical threat protection. As in, if a witch or wizard with ill intent tried to get on our island, they'd have a hell of a time. But a regular muggle? Apparently he can just take an old decrepit small boat that barely holds water and land here.
And then teach magical dueling to the teenagers that were interested in learning. One of the things I love about this Unity House, is that each child has a unique and slightly different way of using their magic. Most of them are actually taught wandless magic, but those that do use things like wands actually use a variety of tools. Such as staves. One girl has a war fan as her 'wand,' and one boy has a glove made from cloth that had been woven with strands of hair from every member of his family.
: Oh Merlin. You want to adopt her. I, I just, Dragon, I can’t. I’m not there. I don’t know if I’ll ever be there. I know deep in my gut that our family is complete. Maybe that will change in the future, but even if I wanted more children with you suffering from PPD and the fact that my depression has been running unchecked for the last year, I shouldn’t be taking on any more children. I wouldn’t let my unity Kids be adopted by someone as unstable as myself.
I think I have probably taken enough time writing this out that I might be welcome back with the group. I love you Draco.
Harry chuckled. “Probably not the best time for a FULL sexual history, but I will say that OTHER us and all our friends over there are Kinky as fuck! Hermione got a brilliant job opportunity requiring her, Ron, Blaise, and their kids to move to Russia, and Other us threw them a hardcore play party as a going away gift.”
Something that could take my mind off of any possessiveness is thinking about Severus harassing your father about his drag performance. I think it's amazing that they still have a friendship even with one of them existing as a portrait. I wish there was a portrait of my parents somewhere. I'd love to really get a chance to talk with them. I know I've spoken with them during a few rituals, but it's not the same. I mean, Sebastian has a full relationship with his biological father thanks to that painting. It's not the same as if he were alive, but it's something.
As lovely as she is, Luna did not turn me on at all, but watching YOU make her orgasm over and over again? I felt so much pride being married to someone so ... powerful. And as you didn't describe it, I have to assume you weren't aware of it, but every time she came you would make this high-pitched moaning/keening sound. It's actually the sound you make, on the occasions that you bottom, when I first slide into you. Like you can't quite believe how good it's all feeling.
Ollie! Sorry I shut my gob for that moment but I have to interrupt, IF Draco was talking with Grandmama, I can promise the only way he would be talking about you is if someone had hurt you and he was talking about the person who did so. Theoretically of course.
Oh, I just asked why he never brought me my cucumbers and apparently he doesn't even remember me asking for them. Is his mind going in his old age? What else could I have meant by calling him into the room and singing to him? Yikes.
But it was right about then that I had an urge to see you demonstrate your skill to the fullest. I wanted to make someone absolutely jealous of me and the fact that I have YOU for a husband. So, I found an amenable man, and best of all, he was dark and swarthy - which is as close to my type as anyone who isn't you can get. Climbing into the bed, I ordered you to rock his world, which you did.
Thank you for believing in me when I said something didn't feel right, and also, for siding with my father in this matter despite him clearly being at fault. I know you're our family and stuck with us now no matter what, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to defend Lucius Malfoy from legal repercussions for his actions during the war. It means so much that you are willing to at least give him the benefit of the doubt for the moment.
The consensus was they weren't quite sure WHEN I'd be conducting this undercover operation, but that it would be the MOMENT they could confirm the target. Which just so happened to be while we were at Hannah's party. I really did have to go to the loo, but mid-slash, I received an Insta-owl letting me know that everything was in place and I was needed that second. So I rushed to say my goodbyes to Hannah and let her know to let you know I had something important to do.
Don't worry, I immediately told him that wasn't the case. I even pointed out where you had directly told 'Mione that he knows you might only ever be up to the few and far between special occasion public foreplay where we go home to finish just the three of us. I told him that I can really only speak for myself and I am getting every single one of my needs met. I get to submit, I get to bottom often, I occasionally top. I get to do kinky non-vanilla things and soft sweet love-making.
Hermione's babies are two weeks old today, and I am over a week past my due date. New plan, we steal one of her babies. They're cute. There are two of them. The adults are so sleep deprived they probably won't even notice.
And at this stage in development, at ten months old, she technically should still be anxious to be removed from her main caregiver (you, obviously). For her to voluntarily remove herself from you, according to the parenting books I've read, it actually means that she is so secure in you, she trusts that you will be there when she needs you, so she feels safe to explore. She crawled AWAY from you BECAUSE of how wonderful of a Daddy you are to her.
But getting back to you on your hands and knees. Mmm... I had a point I was going to make. What was it again? You on your hands and knees? Mmm... ... ... You are bloody hot! I'm going to have to charm a toy to play with you all by itself while I stand back and watch. I want to see the look on your face as you get *so* close... and then I might cast an orgasm denial spell and see how long before you beg. At the same time, I can stand next to you and stroke my shaft because watching you is going to turn me on so bad!
Today - which is probably actually yesterday at this point - I had a busy enough day working with Vani at Unity. Guess what? Vani might be getting adopted! There's a couple that I don't know anything about yet that came in to start the process, and if nothing goes wrong - and if Tabitha thinks they're a good fit - little Vanessa will have a loving new family to cherish her and raise her right.
From there, Falcon kissed his way up Oliver's body until they were tentatively snogging. That evolved into more confident kisses. Little touches and caresses evolved into explorations, likely trying to determine what they had in common.
I took a deep breath as I thought over how best to answer this. "Hmm... well I suppose...It's... It's because I'm... a...I'm like a fragile shell of good over a tightly controlled monster. If I didn't have you two and all our kids to keep me motivated, I'd probably just say fuck it and go off on a never ending rampage."
It's sort of like when I kept the Adventure Park thing a secret. I did it because I was putting myself in mild danger simply to have a lark, and I didn't want you mad at me or making me feel guilty for wanting it. Plus, you know, in THAT instance, I really wasn't doing anything wrong and I am entitled to have a few harmless secrets.
So, I’m going to treat this the way I would any other raid that would take you away for us for a day .... you have my love and my blessing.
So, without trying, we were actually looking for muggleborns who had muggle job experience, but were also powerful. Or at least, a team of people that could cover all bases. You'll be happy to know that the foreman is a squib who actually has a LOT of construction experience.
- We need to know where you are, I won't come barging in and embarrassing you, but I need to be able to get to you in an emergency.
"I know we all agreed, but I think part of me was hoping you'd forget - just like you forgot to put on the condom - and just do it," he replied, almost muttering as if not actually wanting us to hear him.
You shook your head. "Not officially, although if you were determined enough, you probably could, BUT that's NOT Muggle Studies, and so, ***I*** can't help you out with it nor discuss the specifics in class."
And since you asked just how many children there are. Officially we have twenty-one ... and counting ... children. We gave birth to or adopted twenty-one beloved children. We currently have seven grandchildren with I think four more on the way. We have roughly six additional heart children. They are ours, we claim and love them, but we never officially adopted them. The blue haired boy Jules was one of them. And we also have two, almost three, children-in-laws who were brilliant enough to fall in love with our children.
Alright, on to more recent planning. Neville and Charlie want a double date this weekend. I think we should start somewhere fairly neutral. What do you think about taking them to the Shard? It was such a beautiful restaurant, and as a bonus, if the date gets friendly, we'll have the option of obtaining a room in the same building. But don't worry, I'm not assuming anything, just trying to plan for all possibilities.
Now I know why you're grumpy when you're woken up, you spend all night watching me sleep! Well, except that you're NOT grumpy when I wake you up ...
Anyway, Viona definitely still calls you Mumda and our babies didn't seem to forget us - at least, they still sort of smiled at me when they saw me, so I assume they remember me. And probably you.
She’s had a full work up by Dr Rowe and her hearing is fine. Her mouth, throat, and vocal chords are fine. So I wonder if it’s some sort of elective mutism. Possibly having to do with her trauma.
So now I think it's time to talk about the hippogriff in the room. You're "feeling unsettled". You want to move "if we have more kids". And now you want to compete with your parents about how many children to have?
And they didn't believe me. I was told that I am shorter than Harry Potter. That my scar was obviously a fake. "I mean, sure it's a fairly good imitation, but the real scar isn't quite so faded, you really need to get that touched up." So I argued with this crazy person for a solid ten minutes, to prove I was the person they were obsessed with. I probably would have kept going, because you know how much I hate to step down from a challenge, except Hannah must have realized I was entertaining a lunatic because she came and brought the check. Which she had written, "Stop it! This person is a crazed fan, don't convince them you're you, run away before they believe you!"
Or at least as long as Pippa is willing to let you sleep before you take off for today's meetings. You do have more meetings today right? I suppose I could go find Pippa and ask her, but that would require moving out of this cozy chair and out from under my Molly blanket, so I guess I will just have to wait for that information.
"My grandmother and grandfather live in Australia and I've never had Aunts or Uncles before. Or brothers or sisters. Are you sure they're really mine?" River asked curiously.
Wishing I could give you my full attention for the entire night, I forced myself to leave your side and watch as Rolf had one of his Poly Lovers secure him to the spanking bench. The moment I was certain they were doing it correctly, I walked over to find Astoria asking Hermione questions about the Sybian Saddle. Satisfied that our Ms. Know-It-All would be able to answer anything Astoria wanted to know, I moved on, circling the room and taking in everything. Answering questions when need be, and handing out various potions - such as the 4 hour stamina potion (as I really felt 12 hours might be a bit much for this party, heh heh).
Well, here's the bottom line; because Viona has no legal guardians, any adoption is at the discretion of the Department of Children's Services. They have already authorized me as being capable of running an entire orphanage, and they authorized your clearance as a caregiver. I added you when I did the staff's authorization checks because I knew there were going to be nights that we had to stay overnight. So the adoption would be going through the ministry, through a department that knows that we have financially and legally supported an orphanage, and has verified our ability to care for children.
Anyway, I did the thing where I totally annoyed Molly. I had really gotten out of the habit of trying to tell Molly how to care for the babies. I know she knows what she's doing. She may have had less kids than we do - and did you ever think you'd end up with more kids than the Weasley family? - but she most certainly knows her way around child care! But our Jasmine is special ya know? What if Molly is so distracted keeping Siri and Sir Draco Lucius Malfoy II out of mischief and she thinks Jaz is fine because she's not crying and Jaz ends up not getting something she needs because she isn't communicating? What if she's starving and Molly doesn't feed her …. okay, I hear it now, I sound like a lunatic. Yeah, I'm being a tit. Like there's a chance Molly will even put Jaz down let alone let her go hungry.
Sorry about the incoherence when talking about Luna, it's just that she's definitely a woman, with all the best womanly parts. I had a dream in which I had you naked and on a leash, and she was bound to the bondage X in our playroom, and I forced you to orally please her and, erm... service her... I know that you probably wouldn't be *able* to do it and I don't want to force you to *actually* do anything you're uncomfortable with. It's just that she's probably the closest I've ever come to feeling love before you - actually, I'm pretty sure I was already more than half in love with you by that point, so technically, she would have been *after* you, but before we got together. Anyway, the point is that I do often picture her - the things we've done, the things we talked about doing but never got a chance to do, her pegging me... I *also* picture you about a hundred times more often, and on occasion, the two of you are doing things in my head that would probably make you both blush if I merely *told* you about them.
There's probably a reason I can't let this little girl go for more than a few moments at a time, and it has nothing to do with any sort of obligation I might feel toward her father. I look into her eyes and I...
Phew, today was a very long day. We really should have put more thought into dragging Oliver back to our bed to delightfully devour him. We were up much too late for this old man to get a good start on what was a very long day.
Then I saw your face, now I'm a believer, not a trace, of doubt in my mind, I'm in love, I'm a believer, couldn't leave you if I tried,
Well, the neighbor on the other side of the bedroom wall noticed something odd. It seems Lana is normally a happy, cheery, and quiet baby, but suddenly last night, Lana started crying. Also normally, Darrin is an attentive father who makes sure that he fixes whatever is making Lana cry as soon as possible. But Lana just kept on crying for about an hour or so.
So as for today, I'm writing this because Pippa popped into our room to remind me of something important and I didn't get a chance to tell you before I got dressed and took off for the day. See, remember way back in, oh... November? You mentioned a brilliant idea to create a celebration of the various magical cultures living here in Britain.
In any case, I'm all dressed up in some of my finest clothes - not that you can see it with the babies strapped to me in their respective wraps - and I'm ready to cheer on my girls - not to mention all the models - as they do their best to show the world that they have what it takes to run their own fashion design company.
We all set out after you, but we didn't realize you had only gone into the exam room right next door to her office. By the time we found you, you had somehow accidentally knocked yourself out and were laying quite oddly on the exam table. We decided to let Rowe perform a full scan on you to check you hadn't injured yourself (nope, just a little bump to the noggin combined with being so tired) and once we knew you were just getting some well needed rest, she decided to check up on you and the little one you're carrying.
They gathered around and stared at my shirt apprehensively. I looked down to find that ONCE A-BLOODY-GAIN, you'd managed to change my shirt to a different one. This one said: Use of the word CAN'T will result in a 10 Burpee penalty.
Eri and Haz, as well as Siri and Zwei are probably the exception to the rule. Eri and Haz may as well be conjoined twins for all that they would be fine never leaving each other's sides. And I think Siri needs a bit more separate time but not much, so him being in the second-year dorm at Gryffindor compared to Zwei's first-year dorm and their separate classes is probably just enough time for his introverted self to regroup.
I'm really proud of you sweetheart, you didn't so much as make a face even though you were woken early and then covered in syrupy kisses. Some even got in your hair and you didn't so much as scowl.
"Good. You'll probably meet Antonio tomorrow, and he'll probably be happy to meet you once he realizes that he's got a new sparring partner," I said. "But for now, I'm going home with my husband so we can cuddle with our adorable children. You should probably go talk to Yesenia for a bit, or if you don't feel like talking, find Luna and ask her to tell you how many wrackspurts are around your head."
I think this is the longest we've ever gone without attending a movie night! I was sick for the night we did the Christmas Tree decorating. We were in Australia for the following Wednesday, and Amsterdam the week after that. Then last week I didn't go because I was hysterically panicking over my husband being held in Ministry custody. Yikes, it's been over a month since I've sat with my family in my arms surrounded by my Kids. And oh it was such a sweet movie too! The Secret Garden. We have a copy of the book at home and at Unity, but I hadn't seen the movie before. We do so many animated movies, it was nice to have a live action for a change. But we could have watched something absolutely terrible and I would have been happy as can be to spend an evening with some of my very favorite people.
I quit! I no longer want to be a parent! Our Darling Viona has just informed me that she has decided (inspired by River and Mahafsoun) to marry her favorite minion NEXT summer - so we have over a year to plan the wedding - but she expects it to be utterly fabulous and befitting a princess. I was at a loss for words and trying my best to be supportive, so I asked her his name. She paused for a long moment, and then said she didn't know and would have to ask him when she informed him of the happy news.
If you're not too tired when you get home tonight be prepared to be properly thanked, thoroughly debauched, taken apart, and put back together.
But the strangest part of all is that I have a bit of minor cramping (probably related to the flu or cold) and I'm craving chocolate like I'll die if I don't get some, and so, I feel like I'm channeling Pansy when she's having her time of the month. Maybe it's long distance sympathy pains and she's gone into labor?
But instead of a true sixty-nine, Blaise had his mouth doing double duty. He had his mouth on her, but he was alternating between her clit, Draco's bollocks, and licking at where his cock was gliding in and out of her. If it were me, I would have been focused on Blaise's monster cock, but it probably surprised no one that Draco was going to take full advantage of having a fanny to fuck. You had one hand clenched on her hip in a death grip, but the fingers of your other hand were rolling her nipple between them. Blaise was toying with the other.
BUT now that we've feed him up rather a lot, his constipation has not gotten better. I've dealt with this mainly by using gentle internal cleansing charms on him to vanish the waste whenever he follows me to the loo and watches as me and Jaz do our business. Today, I assumed that I'd have to pretend I needed to go to the loo so that I could subtly entice him to follow me, but the way he looked like he was in a lot of pain as he rubbed his tummy, I wondered if maybe there was something much worse going on.
Anyway, once Rowe was ready for us and we were securely ensconced in her exam room, she did a few basic diagnostic spells on me while we described the problem. All her scans came back normal. As far as she could tell, there'd been no change from our last appointment. Her preliminary diagnosis was one of the things you suspected: PICA.
So, in case you're wondering why I'm going to spend the upcoming months following River around like a lost puppy, this is why.
"Right!" You exclaimed happily. "Let me go make you some! Any kind in particular you want? Garlic? Blood?"
Once in front of the practice dummy, I cast a spell to very clearly show where its kidneys would be if it had some. "The kidneys are next to the last place that I'm going to teach you because they are one of those places that will not only hurt excruciatingly, but also, could actually kill your opponent if hit with enough force. Thus, obviously, while I will encourage you to practice on each other until you can reliably hit them when necessary, I DO NOT want you to put enough force into the hit to do any real damage.
Ernie brought me a preliminary list of orphan kids in the muggle system that have shown signs of magic, we’re going to schedule some interviews next week I think. Do you, Pansy, or Blaise have any idea how to start tracking down the kids “orphaned” to Azkaban? It’s looking like the house will be ready in three weeks!
The only person I can think of that HASN'T arrived yet is Mahafsoun. I'm excited to finally see her. When she originally moved to America, your ward but in the care of Portia, I thought that the most likely scenario was that she'd work on that vampire show of hers for a couple of months, and then it would end and she'd be back in no time. But then her show did brilliantly and she was asked to stay in America permanently.
And who says posh pureblooded Grampy Lulu wouldn't be able to teach anything to his muggleborn granddaughter?
Hazel started crying at that point, hugging Pearl and blubbering about loving her SO much too. I decided that I REALLY didn't need to be a part of this conversation at all, and so, silently shut their door before wandering off to ask our OTHER children. To my relief, Zaire, Jaz, Siri, and Zwei were all eager to dance with me, and so, if you need me, I'll be in the ballroom.
"I'll do whatever you tell me too, under one condition," she murmured calmly, looking to the floor as if she was a servant addressing a master. "Please remember that I am a lesbian and am not interested in you shoving your prick in me once I start flying."
When Oliver is done welcoming you home will you please let him know he can come visit me in my bedroom, I'd really like to talk to HIM.
And now I have sufficiently bummed myself out. I think I will go treat myself to some of the cake I made yesterday. And of course the frosting was cream cheese, what do you take me for? A heathen?
Wait, so you think that Mitchell might have something to do with the mass escape? Hmm... I have to go initiate a line of questioning that I myself will be unable to perform for a few reasons, but seems to be direly important. I'll pop by Unity House when I'm done.
P.S. I know Miles is still in rehearsals as we speak, but maybe he'll be performing by the time we get back. We should go see him. Shouldn't we? Do you think he'd WANT us to go see him???
I won't because you really have been acting all weird with your stomach aches. Maybe you feel off because you ate a ton of worms!! You ate worms Draco. Worms. I mean, I understand different cultures have different eating habits. And if I'd been raised in a place where that was common I probably wouldn't think anything of it. I can logically tell myself it's a protein and the idea that it's gross is all in my head.
You can skip this if you don't want to know anymore, but I had a chat with one of the Hogwarts elves when she was here for... breeding, and she told me that even though there are more than a hundred elves at the Castle, they actually are mostly related too. Previous Headmasters never truly thought about how or why they bred, only preferring to think about the fact that they maintained a controlled and mostly perfect population for the Castle. *Dumbledore* - on the other hand - took an active interest in their general health and wellbeing and actively asked around the families that owned elves every couple of years if they'd agree to breeding, and I suppose that on the whole, there was never really a good reason to refuse. Thus while the Hogwarts elves used to be rather closely related, they're now mostly first and second cousins. That said, they hadn't discussed the subject with McGonagall at all since she became Headmistress, and so, are somewhat grateful to me for bringing the subject up and giving them courage to ask her about it.
