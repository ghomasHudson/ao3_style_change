Would I be rude to ask Mr. Potter if he’s earned any medals?
“No worries. I have all the information I need,” he yelled, knowing it was a pitiful excuse.
Draco’s prick was even hotter to the touch without the clothing barrier. It was hot and hard, and yet soft and smooth, all at the same time. He began to stroke, the way he liked to be stroked himself, and watched for cues in Draco’s facial expressions to see if he was going it right.
Randolph waddled towards the Slytherin table. McGonagall has asked the students to move the tables to how they normally were and students were sitting with their houses, even if none wore the robes.
“Wouldn't happen to remember an address, would you?”
Harry continued to think about it as he ate his morning cereal, as he weeded the garden, as he walked through the park, as he played a quick pick-up game of Quidditch with Ron and his brothers, as he turned down Kingsley again for Auror Training, as he attempted to convince himself to sleep and as he attempted to convince himself to wake up.  This was becoming an obsession, much like sixth year. Except Harry wasn’t sure if Draco was up to something; rather Harry found himself growing concerned. Malfoy seemed embarrassed by the mark. The scarf had not been an artful fashion choice but rather a tool to cover it up. Was it medical? A spell? A potion gone wrong?
Draco gasped. Snape's hands shook, but the spell wrapped around Harry and Draco's hands in a gold band.
"I asked you here to end the chaos, not exacerbate it!"
“Well, he sees me and at first I don’t know what’s going on and just assume he’s changing. I’ve seen all the Weasleys change before in some from so I just walked right in and kept talking.”
flared on his desk. A mix between a Muggle phone and the wizarding fire-call system, the
"Hagrid was the first magical person I met, my first friend really, and he was kind enough to help me with my shopping for my school supplies before school began. One of the first places we visited was Madame Malkin's. When a small little boy began to talk to me while he was being fitted for his robe, I listened, thinking perhaps I had met my first friend my age. He began to speak of the houses and announced that he was going to be in Slytherin. He was proud to be in the house of his parents and grandparents. But he insulted Hagrid, and from that mistake I decided that I didn't like him."
The squid wiggled below them. ‘You know him? Is he all right? Somewhere safe? Is he eating enough?’
“I’m gay, Ron. I came out to Andromeda last week.”
“Kitchen?”
Luna hummed. 'Well, there was one ancient myth about a black cauldron, but in the myth the cauldron was destroyed. If Draco is looking for that cauldron, then he's too late.'
"And, while Alex was nice, he never would do the things I wanted him to do. He wanted someone who was dominant on the outside but submissive on the inside, like Hermione. He likes the fact that Hermione challenges him all the time in public, but from what I know of Hermione and what I've heard from Alex, it's his show in the bedroom."
Draco growled, but allowed Harry to pull him back into the bedroom. “Just shut it, Potter.”
Instead, Dean put his arm around Harry and plastered a bright smile on his face. 'Lucky for you I was visiting Luna, and was with her when she received your post. If I hadn't, you might have been stuck with goldilocks over there.'
"I did nothing I swear! The Sorting Hat did it all on its own!"
I grip the doorjamb and open my mouth to spill everything to my dad, to warn him, when Mr Potter shuffles behind me, poking his head into the kitchen.
Without warning, the body moved and suddenly a large eye appeared before the crew, its black orb as tall as a centaur and as wide as a Hippogriff.
My father laughs and pulls the Cornflake container out from behind the toaster without missing a beat. How did he find it so quickly?
Harry went back to his bedroom. He thought about a shower, but was too tired to perform anything more than a Cleaning charm. The day had been exhausting and a little too much for Harry to process. He closed his eyes and went to sleep, dreaming of nothing.
Indeed the milk bottle is almost empty, so I pour out the last of it and shake it a little over my bowl until I get every last drop. I then place the bottle back in the fridge.
Harry stared at Draco seriously. “Ogre? Hmm.”
“We couldn’t find any prints, but we did find a small scratch in one of the walls. No tissue, but there a small red substance smeared. Our boys almost didn’t catch it. Our lab guy says it's nail polish.”
Draco watched his mother’s face. She was the one who taught him the power of keeping your feelings to yourself, but surely mention of her sister would rouse some kind of reaction, favorable or no. It did not.
Harry moaned, forgetting his mission entirely and falling into the intoxicating feel of Draco against him. Draco kittenishly licked Harry’s top lip, his chin, and his neck, while tugging on Harry’s shirt buttons. When the cool air of his flat reached his bare skin, the shock of the cold made Harry aware that he was not following his own plan. He pushed Draco away, only to have the man give a quick turn of the head, the bell ringing in that maddening way Draco knew drove him crazy.
And it was even better when Harry eventually took Draco's cock into his mouth. Draco’s blond curls tickled against his nose and his scent and taste were heavenly.
Harry impulsively reached into his pocket and pulled out the
Andromeda raised her eyebrow.
Harry felt Draco’s hair, his face, his chest, before taking Draco’s hand and nodding.
Lestrange strengthened his hold, shaking Finn around. Finn looked scared, his freckled face pale underneath Lestrange's arm. Lestrange had must have placed a Sticking Charm on his lips because he looked to be vainly trying to pry his lips open.
“Did you guys touch each other at all?”
“There is obviously something going on from the looks the two of you just shared.” She pointed to the back door. “What I’m trying to figure out is why you felt like you had to keep it hidden.”
“So, Potter, have any more questions about the glorious universe of the gays?”
“Harry, it's just the magic drumming through you. If you could escape from the Imperius curse, I'm sure you could escape from this. Once you turn me into a wand I'm sure you'll look back on your little puppy dog act as one of the more idiotic things you have done in your life. But since you insist on carrying out this nonsense, I have a proposal for you.”
may not be able to speak, but I have no doubt she has a soul. If I were you, I’d try to stay on her good side, lest she throw you overboard.'
“As nice as it is to chat, it’s early and I would like to go back to bed. Did you have a reason for this display of stupidity or did you just want to annoy me for a while?”
What did he want? He honestly had no idea. My god, the tree house was going to be a disaster! Poor Teddy! He’d screwed up another birthday gift!
“Say it ain't so, Billy,” Harry intoned, flicking his cigarette up and down.
Finn puffed out his stomach and stomped around the deck, until Sir Culhwich gave him the eye.

"My quarters are up the stairs and to the right. So the only way you can leave is if you wait  however long it takes me to grade and then attempt to figure out my locked door without triggering my alarm."
Harry turned off the water. 'I'm fine, hand me a towel, then the shower is all yours.'
Knowing Malfoy would most likely argue and disagree and throw a huge temper tantrum, while making his speech he had very slowly crept toward Malfoy and slowly eased his arm behind Malfoy’s back and pulled on his robe very subtly as to cut off Malfoy’s airways. To Andromeda, he hoped, it would just look like Harry was giving support to a friend.
Draco raised an eyebrow in question.
“Have you ever done anything with a bloke before Draco?”
Harry took the steps two at a time, grateful to his sexy boyfriend for anticipating his needs.
Andromeda flew in behind Harry with a damp washcloth.
Harry tentatively reached out and placed a single hand on Draco’s back. His skin was on fire and the touch seemed to ignite Draco even more.
empties the twigs of residual magic and
Draco scowled. “Just dandy. And you?”
“Oh, and my glasses. God, what did we do last night? Did we go out with George again? I told you he's the wildest Weasley of the bunch. Enjoys seeing me wicked drunk.”
'Find us
“Um, how did you know?”
Ron attempted to continue, but there was a knock on the door. Harry panicked, as he was not supposed to have personal Fire calls during working hours.
My father pauses, biting his lip. He opens his mouth and then closes it again.
There was a pause before Draco spoke again.
Lucius shivered underneath the heavy wool quilts. The movement prompted Narcissa to fuss, pulling the covers in tighter around her husband and brushing away lint that wasn't there. After a few moments, in which Narcissa's face threatened to burst into tears, Lucius began to speak again.
Well that was not going to stop an angry Harry Potter. Malfoy was not Binns and would definitely know if a student group was duplicating its newsletter in his classroom. Harry bet Malfoy was having a good old laugh at Harry's expense. Most likely the talk about Alex was just a smoke screen for Malfoy's evil plot. What exactly that plot was Harry hadn't figured out exactly, but Malfoy was always plotting and always doing evil so it was Harry's job to put a stop on it.
The two sat in silence for a while. Harry tried to look out the window again, but the trees had stopped being interesting. Draco, with his blue pin stripe suit and white blond hair was much more interesting.
“Finally, a proper title.”
“Really? You didn’t tell me. Anyone we know?”
But, to my surprise, I'm not the one most excited at the prospect of dessert. Growling loudly, Harry's stomach shows his appreciation by conducting a rock concert of rumbling noises. He shrugs and winks at me, his thick eyebrows attempting to wiggle, but not really working.
'Oh come off it, Potter. It wasn't that bad. Not the best place for a little snog, but where else are we going to get any privacy?'
It wasn’t that Harry didn’t find
Draco placed his hand delicately on top of Harry's where it rested on the ground. It felt foreign, but tender. Harry looped his pinky finger around Draco's.
Racing into the cottage, he barged into Snape's study. Without a word Harry pulled on Snape's arm and dragged him out into the field.
had done an exposé on Harry’s preferred sock brand which led to a large pile of purple glitter socks being delivered to him at lunch by an secret admirer, and the canteen had been out of his favorite peanut butter and celery sandwiches. Right now, he just wanted to come home, relax, and try to worm a back rub out of his boyfriend. If he could find him, that is.
“Good luck, Potter.” Snape then stepped forward, his lanky hair swinging in front of his face. “And if I come back to find that you have abandoned Draco, I will find you and chop you into potion ingredients.”
“Well yeah, I think it’s hot just listening to the story.”
Wait.
“Here you are again, helping me.”
Harry groaned as Draco winked at him.
Draco shook his head. “Potter, you don't understand magic very well, do you? Magic always finds a way, always. And if magic wants to turn me into a tree and have you cut me down, well then that's what magic will get.”
“We’ll talk again soon, Andy. And you must come over to see what Draco has built for us in the trees. It is just simply magnificent.”
Although the fucking was great.
It was swiftly going pear-shaped, until Narcissa quietly turned Teddy’s fork into a knight. It speared the broccoli and waved it around like a battle trophy.
Draco looked concerned but he held onto Harry's hand tightly. “I'm not so sure that’s going to work. Harry you might die if you can't fulfill the vow!”
I bite my lip before answering. “Um, cleaning out the dust bunnies?” I change the subject. “So, how long?”
“Draco, I wanted you to know that was fantastic. I probably should have told you, but I was a virgin. Thank you for making my first time so memorable.”
"You jump to conclusions so fast. The newsletter is a project one of my students came up with a few years back. We had the same exact assignment I just assigned this class. His idea for change was to have a newspaper compiled of student submissions about oppression. He felt he couldn't change the minds of adults or influence a change in laws, but he could change other students' minds about the world around them, and then when they graduated, they would carry those lessons into adulthood. I agreed and we have continued the newsletter ever since."
is up ahead, maybe a kilometre or two deeper into the island.'
"I don't really think those count. Just tell me where the Sorting Hat is and then we'll go back to shagging."
"Do you think you can? Maybe if you ram deep enough there might be a place no one else has touched."
… Baron Münchhausen
Harry was unsure what to say, until he remembered Ron was still on Firecall. 'Ron, can I call you back later? I seem to have a visitor.'
issue.
“God yeah.”
Harry figured he had worn Draco out. He was too tired to even speak properly.
My father shoos me into the dining room and forces me to sit down. He grabs two mugs, filling mine with orange juice and his with black coffee.
"Yes, the password is Exploding Treacle Tart."
There was hardly room to walk between the shelves of wands. Wand boxes were piled high on each shelf and precariously stacked on the floor. Harry tried to walk cautiously, but his foot or elbow caught on several boxes, sending them spilling onto the floor. And yet Ollivander continued his straight path ahead, leaving no time for Harry to stop and pick them up.
"Yeah, yeah," I mutter, adjusting the weight of the box to rest on my right arm rather than my left.
The mass rose, filling the cave entirely.
“What preference, dear?” Andromeda asked in all innocence. Malfoy was shaking his head and would have most likely reached over and covered Harry’s mouth, but he was too late, Harry was already speaking.
Harry ignored them and began to march into the woods, slashing the branches and leaves that stood in their way.
"Naw, because he's a nice guy. Most of the professors here, except Cousin Draco of course, don't really get us. They're all still back in the war, and Neville ... Neville's in the present. He dresses how he likes, he does what he likes, and he grows magical plants. Nothing really cooler than that."
“First, Teddy, don’t you have something to say to Draco?”
Finally, someone understands what I have been trying to say, and I'm quite surprised to hear it from Mr. Potter. Perhaps he was hiding a brain underneath that unruly mop of black hair atop his head.
“Teddy, you know that’s not true. I love you and would much rather spend my day with you.”
'Ron's not lying. Voldemort's body is really gone. My father thinks the Unspeakables stole the body to run tests on his skin. His body secreted a natural sun block, keeping his body free from melanoma.'
'First, how's Hermione? The twins giving her trouble?'
“Oh, fine. And you?”
Teddy’s fat tears seemed to dry up instantly at the sound of knights and beasts.
Draco's smile turned into a smirk, but it was teasing rather than condescending. “It's about spiritual love, the type of love that buries itself deep within you, hiding and growing without your knowledge. I believe Yeats was referring to the love that God has for His Muggles, but I think it could also mean a parent's love, born before the child is fully aware of what love is. Or a lover, who has fallen in love without recognition.”
“And you didn’t think she might notice mass construction going on in her backyard?”
And then, he climbed over the side of the cauldron and sank underneath the boiling water.
“I’m gay.”
is a historical artefact and therefore cannot leave the Ministry under any circumstances.'
Harry hated the boys down in Kent. They all chewed gum, their tongues smacking against the roofs of their mouths in a constant rhythm that made Harry want to yank their jaws off.
My father and I have been living in the Muggle world for five years.
"But this comes with consequences. We will be at open odds with many professors and parents. I want you to be prepared. I need you to stay strong; do not be quick to anger."
"Draco, Teddy's totally going to be Minister of Magic someday, isn't he?"
Harry turned to push Draco back outside, but Draco had already begun to walk into the living room, pulling his gloves off and shaking off his coat.
“But I’m not an adult to Teddy! I never was before! I…I don’t want to be an adult. I don’t know how!”
Harry looked down at Draco, trying to gauge Draco’s seriousness. Draco just smiled up at Harry, brushed away his hair from his face.
, but did it make you think? Could you apply it to anything that we had been talking about?"
Harry spied a pair sitting on the coffee table in front of him. “Are these them?”
My father looks wistfully into the dining room. I can't imagine what he thinks Harry is doing in there, but I'm sure he's stuck his bear paw into the middle of the pie and is stuffing the mounds of baked apples into his mouth.
Harry felt something squeeze his middle and suddenly he was outside Draco's cottage. Harry made several attempts to re-enter the building, but every time he came within a few feet of the walls something would bounce him right back. Well, Harry was nothing if not a determined man; he needed to go home and think. If there was a way to help Draco, Harry was going to find it, even if Draco didn’t particularly want him there.
Draco turned. Harry had a hard time reading the look on his face. 'I'm not trying to pick a fight here, Potter.'
Harry directed Malfoy to the back garden, a large open field that led to a large forest of trees in the background. On the left was a large crop of old trees that were sturdy and heady. A single swing had been tied years ago from a branch of a particularly old tree with branches that stretched out and gnarled outward, like an outstretched palm.
Malfoy stood up, taking the book away from Harry and jerking his wrist again, returned the item back into a business card. He handed the card back to Harry.
Smoke lifted from his fag like a snake, wrapping around him and his bike. Harry relished it. Had he not been on the phone he might have began to hiss, a strange habit he found himself doing late at night when his smoke thickened to this shape.
I'm dropped to the ground. My arm is still over my eyes, so I can't see anything. I can hear voices, but underneath the spell they seem hazy, their timbre obscured.
“It was in fifth year, with all the craziness with Umbridge and her detentions. After one particularly nasty one, I wanted to talk to the twins about enacting revenge. I was pretty pissed about the whole thing and I wanted to get her back. I walked into their room not noticing the tie on the door.”
“Yeah.”
This was Harry's morning routine. It was normal. It was typical. It was the same as any other witch or wizard lucky enough to figure out what made him or her truly happy. He captained the
“You damned fool. How did you get to be so lucky?”
“Do you feel it, Mister Potter? Do you feel the magic call to you now? The wand requires someone to harvest it, to make it live in the world again, and it has chosen you. Are you prepared, Mister Potter, to do so, when the time comes? Are you ready to pluck the life from the new Elder tree and fashion a wand from death itself?”
"I don't even know. I'm totally clueless."
"I had meant to put the note in my pocket, but I left it on the bottle. We’re both hopeless."
Harry followed Kingsley's arm as it pointed to the window leading toward the outside hall. There stood at least twenty of Harry's good friends: the Weasleys, Luna and Neville, Hagrid, Seamus and Dean, the Malfoys. Ron and Hermione both waved to Harry through the window, Hermione's eyes filling with tears. Harry made a mental note to send Hermione's mother a gift basket in apologies for his earlier impolite exit.
“Know where to find her?” Harry asked, knowing the lead most likely was a dead end.
McGonagall stared at the Hat and then at Harry.
Harry took a deep breath.
“Oh, what would you like to talk about?”
Harry had naively believed that instinct to be one only the most devilish of men and women possessed. But in his years of travel Harry had met many people, many so-called friends, that would not hesitate when presented with the opportunity to be in control.
Harry smiled, imagining a small Draco reciting this very same poem. “Did it help to understand the poem, memorizing it?”
My usually eloquent father seems to be at a loss for words. I fiddle with my spoon and wait for his answer. My father is very open with me, most of the time, but when we venture into his past or into anything magical, my father clams up faster than an actual clam. I remember the wizarding world and how it treated my father. I remember being called names and turned away from shops. My father has told me the basics of what happened, what he did, but I still don’t quite grasp it all and I know he’s left a lot of details out.
Harry had bigger things to worry about, like what Draco Malfoy was really up to and if Harry wanted any part of it.
‘There was once a wise druid I knew many years ago. He told me of the Magical Cauldron and where he had placed it.’ Harry held his breath. His heart began to beat loudly in his chest.
“I mean, I think we should do what you and Fred did, except to each other.”
“Understandable, Harry. It might take you a while just to receive all your guests.”
The island landscape continued to be astonishingly uninhabited. There was a relief to it, after living and working in crowded London, to be surrounded by untouched nature.
I trip over a side table, sending a kelp wreath flying to the floor. My cheeks feel hot and my eyes are suspiciously wet, so I'm having trouble seeing where I'm going. I hear my father shout my name, but I ignore it.
Draco pulled away, lifting his legs to his chest and resting his head on his knees.
Dora took her hand and squeezed. She then kissed Draco on the cheek and headed upstairs. Narcissa walked out the door, leaving Draco and Harry alone in the foyer.
'Later,' Harry replied, laying a firm wet kiss on Draco's lips, not caring that everyone was watching.
"Yes, Mr. Parkinson."
He leaves my father and I alone in the hallway. Without thinking, I start toeing my socks. My father pointedly stares at me until I reach down and yank the socks off my feet.
“Look, I don’t want to get into another fight. I came to apologize, beg for you to come back, and give you this.”
After a few moments, Draco finally responded, but with a more serious tone, 'I can't make any promises, Potter. I've never been on this island and I'm not a Seer.'
Suddenly where they were came sweeping back to Harry. He took a frantic look and saw Draco staring at him with concerned eyes.
Harry sighed and sat next to Teddy, peering over his should to take a closer look at his masterpiece. Teddy just moved away.
Harry began the arduous task of magically hauling the ship out of the cave and out into the ocean, roping it in tight beside the high dock and releasing the anchor. Once secure, Harry Transfigured a small coin from his pocket into a ramp and climbed aboard the main deck. He sent a myriad of cleaning spells throughout the boat, creating magical brushes to soap and soak the dirty oak beams and dancing dusters to clean the magically-enlarged cabins below deck, making sure each room was sea-worthy.
'I asked you a question.'
"Are you going to tell us or are you going to stare into space for a little bit longer. Neville and I would like to have sex and you're kind of in the way."
And in the middle of the broken cauldron was the lifeless, yet otherwise unharmed body of Draco Malfoy.
Draco turned towards the walls. 'My name is Draco Malfoy and I come in search of the Magical Cauldron. I am the last descendant of the Malfoy family line. It is my duty to find the Magical Cauldron, and I implore you to help me.'
Harry rubbed his scar again, shaken by what he just heard. 'And you think this is what Malfoy is looking for?'
Draco began to walk out of the room, his back towards Harry. “He will contact you when it is time to make a new wand. Goodbye, Potter. I'm keying the wards to keep you out. Don't bother coming back here.”
"I liked the Sorting Hat, made me laugh when I was sorted."
He took out the
“Yes, yes. All this talking is just delaying my shower, and I really want one now. I’ll be back in time for dinner, I promise.”
Well there was something new and exciting. He had come out to Andromeda and it didn’t seem really fair that she knew, and Malfoy knew, but Ron didn’t know. There never seemed to be a right time to tell him, but looking into his earnest face and the quiet around the house, he did the thing he had been doing for the last week: he opened his mouth and hoped for the best.
“Any luck?”
Draco was at the bottom of the entrance, looking very nice in the same jumper and jeans as he’d worn to the party, but for some reason at night it didn’t look ridiculous. The sweater was tight and a little long over Draco’s hands, making Draco look soft and vulnerable.
My father isn't even looking at me. I'm tempted to blurt out what I saw, but I keep my mouth shut. The document said "if" my father does any magic, and I know my father won't. I just have to keep an eye on Harry and make sure he doesn't do something fishy like framing my father.
"I know, Harry. But it's the only way. I'm the leader. The Headmistress will believe that the Green Rebellion dies with me, but it doesn't. It will live on, changing minds and promoting equality one person at a time."
My father smiles at me, his eyes clear and soft. I'd been creeping up ever so slowly to his height, but today I realize we're finally at the same eye level. He lifts his eyebrow, I lift my eyebrow, he pulls his hair behind his right ear, I pull my hair behind my left. But then my father surprises me by sticking out his tongue so I use my finger to lift up my nose.
Harry spied a street sign and began walking towards it. “Eversholt?”
“As you wish, your majesty,” he replies, lifting his wand, gripping the end in his fist, and places the tip against my father's wrists.
He's not exactly a "four-eyed git" like my father said. He does wear glasses, but the frames are thick, sleek and black, and Mr Potter wears them like a war mask. When my father had first mentioned the phrase I imagined Mr Potter to be some stuck-up nerd with taped up specs and a pocket protector to shield his shirt from leaking pens, but this man doesn't seem the type to care much about a stray stains or the ability to make a quick mathematical calculation.
Draco faced Harry, his eyes boring into him as he slowly removed the blanket from his legs. Harry could see no change in Draco. His trousers were loose and gray, well fitting. Harry continued to look down, trying to comprehend why Draco would want him to see his legs. It wasn't until Harry reached Draco's feet that the real reason why his legs were covered became apparent. Draco was without shoes or socks, but they were unnecessary. Draco's feet were unrecognizable. They were encased in bark, tiny, root-like growths sticking out every which-way. They looked heavy, and ill shaped.
"I think we should change the law on some of the magical creatures in the forbidden forest."
“But it’s more than a spot! It’s tree bark! There has to be something really wrong for you to be growing bark down your back. Have you seen anyone? Talked to anyone about it?”
Harry began to sputter out excuses, but all that came out was strangled vowels and consonants.
'Harry, what is going on?' Dean yelled, slowly limping up the main deck, his movement awkward and unsure. With each step Harry held his breath, mentally aware that the ship should hold, but still afraid that at any moment Dean would fall through the cloud never to be seen again.
In the second greatest idea Harry had ever had, beside the creation of the bell in the first place, Harry wandlessly (and to this day Harry has no idea how he was able to pull off this feat) cut off the leather strap from Draco's neck, shrunk it, and reattached it firmly around Draco's cock.
“Right.”
Harry's ears were ticklish and he was having trouble not laughing. “I have no idea where you live.”
Andromeda looked warily at Harry who smiled shyly back, before turning to Draco with a sure smile.
'Stay where you are!'
Draco sat up, but Harry kept his arm around his waist. He didn’t want to let go.
Harry grunts in response and walks toward the dining room, but before he leaves, he turns and comes back, giving a quick kiss on to my father's cheek.
'I'm not sure I'd be able to live that long by myself. My wrist would get mighty sore.'
Draco pressed his hands against Harry’s face.
There was a sudden knock on the door. Harry answered it.
Harry landed in the clearing first, followed shortly by the rest. Sir Culhwich was last, stumbling on the landing. Finn and Draco were there to help him off his broom. They all strapped the brooms to their backs and took a look around, unsure what to do next.
“Shit.”
"Fred must have noticed my confused face because he asked me if I had ever done anything like what he was doing. I said no. My face must have been beet red, but I couldn’t move. I felt like I was petrified. So, Fred told me exactly what he was doing and then told me to get on another bed and do the same.”
"Take a shower, Hayden."
The living room has a large fireplace that my father always keeps lit, even in the summer, which is just one of the wizarding habits he can’t break. There are a few of those, like keeping his wand with him at all times, even though he doesn’t use it. He used to keep it up his sleeve, but now he just jams it into his back pocket or behind his ear, and if we go out he shrinks it and wraps it around his wrist like a bracelet. He thought it looked girly, but I reminded him that real men can wear bracelets, real men can wear anything. My dad wore a black flowy dress for most of his formative years so it seemed silly to be concerned over a small wooden accessory.
Harry was still wearing pants and Draco made a show of removing them slowly, kissing down Harry’s chest, Draco’s burning lips searing into Harry’s skin. His wandering fingers brushed Harry’s lower stomach, making Harry gasp, and then the fingers moved lower, brushing against Harry’s hip bones, thighs, and the back of his knees, as Draco lowered the pants down his legs.
Draco sighed heavily, turning towards the window again and tapping his fingers in a slow beat on the armrest.
“Calm down, Potter, I can hear your thoughts from here!”
Draco began to make short little manic bursts of laughter. “I did, didn't I? I broke the Elder Wand. We don't have to worry. I did it. I saved the day!”
Harry wanted a normal life. Had running away back to London, away from the call of the sea and the thrill of exploring new places and people, truly given him the normal life he desired? What was this so-called normal life? Was it daily routines and morning toast? Or, was that the brand of normal his aunt and uncle had always tried to shove down his throat?
“No, Mother, I’m actually working on a new house.”
'Where's Finn?' Harry asked.
Teddy walked forward. The students moved to clear Teddy a path.
Neville stayed like that for a while. Not really wanting his friend to suffer, but unsure as to words of advice when he had no idea what was going on.
"Mister Potter! You've found the Sorting Hat!"
As the years ran by, the word became softer, said with a flippant air and a flick of the hair until both of us fell into giggles. It was such a funny word, and hard to say, notorious. It sounded like a foreign language, or perhaps something a fine lady would say while drinking tea in tiny china cups. I didn't learn the word’s definition until I was much older, and by then my father had stopped saying it altogether.
Draco massaged his shoulder and glared at Dean. 'Mind your own,' he replied petulantly.
If the boat could speak, Harry was sure her response would have been a long series of questions as to why she was hidden away and why she wasn’t in the open air as she was made to be.
Padma stormed up to King Ascon, resting her knee dangerously close to his privates, and pulled out the arrow holding back his collar. ‘Tell us how to release her.’
Padma grabbed Harry's arm. 'Where's Sir Culhwich?'
"Nothing. Absolutely nothing. All we did was allow your godson to talk to him. Seems they had a pretty lively discussion. The Hat agreed right away to your crazy scheme of telling McGonagall that he was on holiday, but then Teddy and the Hat branched into other topics. I had no idea the Hat was going to do that. Imagine that, an entire year  of Slytherins."

'If you're too scared, we can rush in and clear any danger before you touch your prissy foot on land, Captain,' Finn replied, his tiny fists up in readiness for a fight. Harry sighed silently in his mind. The boy's Gryffindor tendencies were out loud and proud, and that was always a dangerous characteristic in the face of the unknown.
“So, I’m assuming that’s the tree house under that giant sheet.” Ron pointed to the crop of trees that held the tree house. Draco had smartly covered the structure with a giant sheet, keeping in mind the Muggles that would be in attendance.
I run a list of possible visitors through my head and can’t come up with anyone who would want to spend Twelfth Night with us. My mother hasn’t written us for five years and my grandparents would never willingly come into a Muggle neighborhood.
Draco just pointed his finger towards the door. “Out, now, Potter. I don’t have time for this.”
With those words, all stopped their morbid fascination with the ensuing fight between Dean and Finn and turned to stare at Luna who was busy twirling her yellow-feathered earrings around her fingers.
Harry was fuming. Thoughts, doubts, and concerns were swirling in his head. Why had he agreed to come to this place? Why had he allowed himself to get swept up in the mission of others? Time and time again Harry and his friends were used as ammunition for other people's battles. And right now, Harry had no idea why he had agreed to put his friends in danger, once again, for Draco Malfoy, of all people.
Harry looked towards the sun. Its bright orange light was low in the sky.
Harry shifted on his broom looking to the crew for something to say in reply. Ever the eloquent speaker, Draco swept in beside Harry and began to work his magic. Harry’s only worry was the likely possibility that Draco had no idea what a submarine was.
"I don't hate her and everything I've said is true. She is so focused on her replacement and her legacy at this school that she has forgotten everything that was wonderful about herself as a teacher. Whoever named her Headmistress was a fool. She should have remained a beloved teacher and allowed someone else to deal with the bureaucracy. She's changed, mainly with the Ministry breathing down her neck every two seconds. Teachers have been dropping like flies and no one wants her position. I don't hate her, I pity her. There is a difference." Draco's voice became very quiet. "And if I ever hear the word Mudblood from you again you can leave this room and never come back."
Harry shrugged. “It was the best we could do at the time. It worked for your father. He had no idea who I was. Thanks for, you know, not calling me out then.”
"Last one."
“Wait! 100 Galleons? But, there wasn’t a consultation.You were barely here 5 minutes. You can’t just show up at my house, insult me, then demand I give you 100 Galleons. If I’m going to pay for a consultation then I should damn well get one!”
The two stopped immediately as soon as they noticed Harry in the room. Harry sat down and suddenly realized the cause for the hushed whispers. He also knew the culprits. Teddy’s laughter and Malfoy’s smug face gave it away. Malfoy had spelled the chair to fart with every movement Harry made. Great. Malfoy was going to turn Teddy into his clone.
Dean hobbled forward, extending his hand to each visitor. 'Welcome to the
Hermione and Ron were setting up the food tables – well Hermione was setting up while Ron was busy taste testing every platter. Bill and Fleur were over with their daughter, Victoire, trying desperately hard to convince her to stop poking Fleur’s pregnant belly with a stick. She was convinced that would make the baby come out faster.
Harry looked into his boyfriend’s eyes and bit his lip. Never before had Harry been attracted to a skirt. Never before had Harry imagined running his hands up a silky smooth tight covered leg. But he was now.
"Is that the Auror uniform? It's different from what I remember."
Harry sighed, “Yeah, tomorrow is going to be great. I have no idea what the tree house is going to look like, since you keep your super-secret tree house plans under lock and key, but I know its going to be great. Teddy’s going to love it, and we’re going to have so much fun exploring every nook.”
"Where’s the loo?"
Once the ship was secured, the crew mounted their brooms, Luna opting to travel in her bird form, and Fawkes insisting on staying on Draco's shoulder. Heading toward the dark cave, the sound of the waves crashing into the cliffs echoed around.
“You thought I was still going to give you half price after that lovely heart to heart? I don’t think so.”
Cindy took a quill from Neville's desk and started taking notes. She also threw a few spells at the paper, seemingly disappointed with the results.
Life is not a billboard; life is not an advertisement for Honeydukes chocolate. Let the chocolate melt and run all over your hands.
Harry ran, and ran. Finally he reached the clearing. Voldemort’s mangled body was lying in the corner, long ago forgotten.
. In the past, the ship was mostly crewed by lost Gryffindors and old friends looking for work for a few months. As the days, years, went by, they all left for more stable jobs. Ron went back home after only a week, missing the regular meals of the Burrow and Hermione's nagging voice. Lavender lasted six months until she procured her clerk position at the Ministry. Seamus was with them for a year, but left to get married to a girl five years younger. Dennis left after two, the frequent pleas from his mother to come home becoming too much for the young man. And after that, Harry would hire transient workers from wizarding shipping ports to work for a few months at a time.

“I don’t want to come that way. I brought lube, and I also know some spells. I thought maybe you would like to fuck me.”
Miss Jadeson looked meek, but after a nod from Draco, she answered softly.
“Why do you ask?”
“A little banged up, but nothing serious. Tergeo, Episkey, Reparo.”
“Harry, I believe your friends are here.”
Once dressed, Harry exited his quarters, enjoying the sights and sounds of his crew working together on the
Draco sat up, nipping Harry on the nose.
“He’s really good at what he does, Ron. And Draco’s serious about his tree houses. They aren’t flights of fancy to him.”
Harry looked down. He was ashamed of lying and now she knew what they were really doing. He thought she would be a lot more excited about the tree house, but maybe she didn’t like the idea. After all that work Andromeda was going to tell Harry to knock it down.
Harry nodded. 'Let's speak in our quarters.'
"Not all the time. There are days I want to be taken and days I just want to take. Some things, I really need someone to tell me what to do, open my eyes. But then in some things I want to know I'm right and have the other person listen to what I have to say."
“There were rumors?”
Mid-bite, Mr. Potter’s blissful silence ends. “You’re a fantastic cook.”
Parked inside the cold cement room was his sleek silver and black 1939 BSA  motorbike. He lifted the garage door, and then pulled out his bike, enjoying the cold metal against his hands. He climbed atop the seat, strapped on his helmet, and turned the sucker on, the warm vibration a familiar sensation.
Why, why, why! Because it's all logic and reason now. Science, progress, laws of hydraulics, laws of social dynamics, laws of this, that, and the other. No place for the three-legged Cyclops in the South Seas. No place for cucumber trees and oceans of wine. No place for me.
Teddy laughed and hugged Harry, whispering into his ear.
Harry stared at his wand, sure that he didn't say or think a spell that would Transfigure the
Malfoy stood up elegantly and held out a business card between his first and second finger.
My father kicks me in the shins and gives me a look that threatens to turn into a lecture if I don’t keep quiet. I sigh and stab a piece of carrot with my fork, imagining it to be Mr. Potter’s arm.
“You might want to think of a shower yourself. You have flour on your nose, and I’ve just added dirt to your chin.”
Snape, who had stormed back into the cottage, now towered over Harry. He bent down and pulled Harry up by his ear.
Draco raised his shoulders in resignation. “I have no idea why I did what I did. Actually I thought…no never mind. I’ve forgotten already! The image of your pufferfish face has erased everything else!”
Cindy hit Harry on the arm.
Draco crossed his legs.
“That’s, well, that’s more than we do. Usually we just post them on the fridge.”
"For a little while. I might even extend it. I believe I may be due."
“But I was a virgin too, you know. I wouldn’t have laughed at you. I had the same thing happen to me. Everyone assumes I slept with Ginny, but with all her brothers around I never dared touch her. You could have told me.”
"I'm a bit mad at you, so I think Neville."
Harry was stunned. All that waiting had been for nothing. He should have known better. Ron had been fiercely loyal to him after the war, and completely devoted to Hermione. He never questioned it, just thinking it to be a reaction from the war in general.
keeps them “safe”, basically sealing the twigs against future magic absorption. You basically did nothing. You sealed in the old magic, which cancelled out the second. We have wasted three days because you are too stupid to do things on your own.”
Harry sat, a little nervous. The last time they had one of these talks it was after Harry came home stinking drunk and had woken up Teddy in the middle of the night to tell him how much he loved him.
Mr. Potter reaches down and grabs my father's hand, linking his chubby, greasy fingers with my father's long and tapered ones.
“Really? Great. Um, what do you want me to do?”
.' Draco licked his lips. Harry unconsciously mirrored the action. 'So, my Captain,' Draco purred, 'I say we go here first.'
Padma grabbed a thin broom from Dean more harshly than intended, throwing the First Mate off balance. Harry was there to support him as he fell backwards, but Dean shied away from his hands, moving quickly away to mount his own broom. Harry looked up to see Draco watching him intently, a strange look in his eyes. Still annoyed after the morning shower intrusion, Harry mounted his brand new Firebolt X and headed to the front of the group.
The crew, Padma, Dean, Finn, and Sir Culhwich, were working together to secure the ship for the night. All had been firmly trained by Dean and Luna in their first hour on board on the basic functions and duties of a crewmember of the
That name. Harry knew that name.
This was Harry's morning routine. It was normal. It was typical. It was the same as any other witch or wizard of his station. He owned slippers. He ate toast. He carried a briefcase.
Harry patted the hull. 'It was better this way, old girl. But, I do have good news for you. We’ll be sailing again, you and me, and a few of the crew will be returning. But none of this action first, thought later business, okay? This time, we’ll make use of our heads before we get involved.'
Snape then turned and marched back into the house. The man no longer wore robes, preferring to wear dark trousers and dark button down shirts, but somehow the air still swished around him dramatically.
The goblin smiled a very wide and toothy smile. But then she frowned again, pulling on Draco's tunic harshly until he knelt on the ground so she could speak directly to his face. 'I know what you are planning, boy.'
“'Fraid not,” Harry replied, trying not to laugh at the man's erratic head waving as he tried to find the non-existent film crew, although, even funnier in Harry's mind, was the man's obvious uncaring attitude toward his own appearance. The thought of being broadcast across the nation still didn't frighten him enough to hide his striped pants.
“He was worried about me.”
'If you wish to find your Magical Cauldron, you'll learn to stop poking your nose in where it doesn't belong. We'll begin the search, but I claim the right to stop this mission at any time.'
“Fuck, that was good, Malfoy.”
A student in the front row raised his hand. Harry noticed that most of the students were in the front row, or close to it, and the handful of students in the back were leaning forward, as if they didn't want to miss anything because of the distance. Most likely they were all looking at Malfoy's hipbone that had stuck out when Draco shifted, his white soft skin tantalizing the audience.
Harry fell knees first onto the ground, his eyes wide. Time stopped and his heart and lungs refused to work. His brain got fuzzy and he couldn't move.
With that Draco turned and began to walk away. As he turned, Harry noticed something peculiar with the neck he had just scrutinized. There, behind the ear, was a large dark brown something atop the skin that extended down the back of the neck.
“Why do you not have anti-apparition wards?”
Malfoy began to get angry, not enough to pull his usual sneer but enough to stand up straight.
But through the pain, Harry knew he had to plead his case. So while still on the floor, Harry screamed. “Don’t turn the wards back on! Please! Or I’ll keep doing this, every day; morning, noon and night. You can’t stop me! I’ll find other ways!”
After a few minutes, I realize my father has yet to take a sip of his drink. Instead, he continues to run his hands over the warm sides and stares into the black substance as if it’s telling him something.
They never spoke.
Harry knew he had a goofy grin on his face and that his words were completely uncharacteristic, but seeing Malfoy in person was just as bad as seeing him through the window. The man looked as if nothing bothered him; his hair perfectly styled atop his head, the same dark blue scarf arranged artfully around his neck. It was a muggle bookshop and Malfoy looked like a regular muggle bloke, picking up a few books for university or a little light reading between dinner parties. Didn’t they all just live through a war? Didn’t Harry read that Malfoy’s parents had been banished to Europe? Why did Malfoy look so unruffled?
“Oh please, get your mind out of the gutter. We have a job to do.”
“Yeah, Oliver Wood.”
As Harry entered Teddy’s room, he found Teddy sitting in Draco’s lap, his eyes falling shut while Draco read his favorite story, “The Dragon and Me”. At the end of the story, Harry helped Draco put Teddy to bed. It was strange to see Draco so tender. It pulled something in Harry.
“Well stupid enough to believe that I would build something so dangerous. Every tree house I build, no matter how small or large, comes with an exorbitant amount of cushioning charms and safety measures. This is again why I said it takes a lot of magical energy and concentration. Look, Potter, let me at least finish the design, and then we’ll talk about time estimation. It really is a matter of quality or time? It’s up to you to decide which is more important.”
“Secrets? What secrets?” Harry’s face turned red.
It started small, with the outcasted people placed silently into jail cells. Those with no families to cause alarm, no one with any friends to cry for an inquiry. They were the ones who lived on the outskirts of towns in dilapidated homes who kept to themselves. They may have followed Voldemort, or they might not have, but they were dirtying the streets of the Wizarding world with their refusal to conform, their denial of the religion of the ministry.
“All right, all right. It’s actually over here.” Harry took his hand and led him over to the crop of trees. A piece of rope had been tied to a tree, high enough that the children couldn’t pull on it. Harry asked Teddy to step back and stand with Andromeda. He pulled the rope and the giant sheet fell to the ground unveiling a large, beautiful, natural looking tree house.
Considering Christmas was similar to what we were used to back in Wiltshire, we were quite surprised to find ourselves the only ones in our street with ribbons on our trees and grindylow-like scarecrows on our front lawn. But my father and I enjoy the celebration and it proves to be a great talking point with our neighbors, so it stuck.
After the war, Harry had a bit of a crush on Neville, who was not gay. He was very sweet and kind. Harry had helped him start his greenhouse and they had spent a fair amount of time alone, together.
Suddenly, there was a click and a cage to the left opened. A black raven-like creature with three legs emerged and flew to the ceiling.
Draco began to protest. “Why? I thought you liked this one!”
And to me, that distinction changed the world.
Then, a large cloud moved and suddenly the small blob Harry had seen far off in the distance bloomed into a large expansive land that loomed heavy in the sky. It was a mountainous island floating high in the air. The tree-covered green mountains were surrounded by a river of dark blue water that ended abruptly a few metres from its shore. And below the land was only air and clouds. It was an island suspended in the sky.
“Yeah. I know what you mean.”
Draco, of course, took that opportunity to shove his tongue down Harry's throat.
“Is he all right?”
Still not quite understanding the images floating through his mind, Harry took a step back. The man reached out.
Draco shoved Harry out of the door. Harry stumbled, but turned once he regained his balance, only to have Draco’s door slam closed in his face. He stood in shock for a few moments before moving away from the door and apparating home. Kreacher was waiting for him in the sitting room, holding a warm cup of tea. Harry sat heavily on his sofa and began to think.
“Well then, tell me what it means, Sir Poetry Master.”
had in fact been bequeathed to a certain bespectacled Potter, and not to the Ministry.'
“Can you believe that when they started to build the tree house Harry tried to convince me that he was building a love shack in which to practice being gay.”
. He showered with Draco. He had a goldfinch on his shoulder.
“I do like it, but this costume is going to be for personal use only.”
“Oh.” Harry felt Draco’s fingers brush a tear from his face.
"Really?"
'Hello, Draco. I apologise for biting you, but you wouldn't let me sit on your shoulder.' Luna turned her head and raised a finger. ‘And I don't think you should use your owl. Harry doesn't like them. But don't worry, I'm a much better carrier than an owl any day.'
Harry looked down into his lap. 'Then drop it.'
Harry nodded, rubbing his eyes underneath his glasses.
After the incident at Ollivander’s my mother wanted to send me off, like a broken toy, to an Orphanage for Squibs, and try again for a real son. My grandfather agreed with her, and my grandmother stood by her husband. It was only my father who disagreed. Against the wishes of his wife and his parents, my father moved me to the one place where I wouldn’t be a failure or a dud, and that was the Muggle world.
I drop the holly and mistletoe near the door and clamber up the steps once more, laughing at my father, who unknowingly sports spiderwebs in his hair.
'I don't think Padma wants to wait,' Draco retorted, still cheeky even while running.
“Well then, if you like it that much, then you wear it.”
Afterwards, neither of them had attempted to communicate with each other. Harry had assumed that what happened was a mistake never to be repeated again. He wasn't naïve enough to believe that this was the start of something beautiful, as Luna would say. That was a fuck, a hard and dirty fuck with a man he still hated. But, much to Harry’s chagrin, he began to crave that sound of the bell, needing to repeat the soft high-pitched noise in order to come.
Harry could see Draco’s cock straining against the knickers above him. He reached up to touch his prize, but Draco batted his hand away.
Harry answered Dean, 'No! There's something down here with us in the hole.' He turned to Draco. 'We are getting out of here now.'
the wonderful tari_sue
"Yeah, yeah," I mutter, adjusting the weight of the box to rest on my right arm rather than my left.
Seeing the location, Harry nodded his head and walked swiftly away from Draco, unsure what had just happened, but unwilling to dwell on it. Instead he headed directly out of the room and out onto the deck. Once behind his wheel Harry yelled out to the
At this point, Harry was the only person that would understand what Draco was going through. Perhaps, in part, it was why Draco had searched out for his help.
“I understand your initial reason for lying, but what I don’t understand is why you took the lie so far.”
"She won't find anything wrong with the Hat."
“Do you want to ability the spend the night, for there to be separate bedrooms?”
Harry flew back into formation, and signalled to Draco to take over the floor. Draco accepted with a nod.
Harry leaned over the railing for a better look and sure enough, the small fishing boat was closer.
Harry admired his handiwork, taking a moment to flick the tiny bell that now found its new home below Draco's cock and above his balls. “I think I just did.”
Harry spun around, looking for where the sound came from. It sounded like Draco, but his mouth was now fully covered. How could he still hear him?
Draco then fell on top of Harry, completely drained. Within moments his breathing became slower and his body heavier.
“One balcony? Several?”
Bingo.
Thank you to the lovely tari_sue and the wonderful Sevfan who made this all possible :) Thank you!
Harry growled. “I don't know what else to say at this point!”
"Told me the story of when I was four and I refused to let my Gran pull the weeds from the garden. Said if I could stand up to my Gran at four that I belonged in Gryffindor. I thought he was joking until I was ushered to the Gryffindor table."
They continued to work later into the afternoon. Andromeda had decided to take Teddy to visit one of her late husband’s relatives, so Harry had no urge to cook a huge meal. On days like this he usually ordered take away. He wondered if Draco was thinking of staying for dinner.
Harry laughed and smacked Draco on the arse.
“I’m not his father. I would make a terrible father. I have no idea what I’m doing! I’m still a kid myself. Andromeda’s the real parent here. She takes care of me as much as she takes care of Teddy.”
“Yeah, I’ve disarmed plenty of other people and their wands never worked for me. I’ve had a lot of time to think, and the best theory that I came up with is that you and I aren’t as different as I thought before. Actually, we’re quite similar. So it would only make sense that our magic would be similar too.”
There was something in man that drove him to control his surroundings. Harry had seen it before, the need to own and devour a piece of land for every last drop of its resource. Even Voldemort, in a way, was just trying to be the king of the anthill, wanting to control where and how the ants took over the unsuspecting grapes and pies atop the picnic blanket.
‘It is a fine motto; a fitting one for adventurers like ourselves.’
"Well, yes, but he has some time off. He seemed very intrigued by our Twelfth Night traditions."
It had started one drunken night at the new gay club in London. Harry had walked in, after having more than a few pints with Ron and Dean at the Leaky, and spotted a fit, sweaty man dancing in the center of the room, wearing only a pair of tight trousers and a thin black strap around his neck.
“He's more lucky to have you as his father.”
“But—!”
"Do you see me pushing pencils?"
Draco hesitated for a moment. "Most tree houses take anywhere from four to six weeks, depending.”
I made a mistake. I kept quiet while things I knew were wrong continued around me. I thought it didn't matter. I didn't know the witches and wizards being taken away. They were probably doing me a favor, keeping the streets safe and clean. It never touched my doorstep. I was too busy with life, with my celebrity and the trappings of youth. It felt good to abandon my responsibility, to focus on myself rather than the world at large.
Luna wrapped a large lock of her hair around her finger. 'If the Unspeakables stole the body, the Aurors wouldn't be looking for it.'
The table grows silent. I can practically hear my own sweat burst from my face. My father is frowning again, deep lines etching on his forehead and around his mouth. He throws his napkin onto the table, a dramatic gesture I’ve learned to fear quite a bit, and stands up, much more gracefully than me.
Harry dragged the soap over his torso. 'But you do know what the Magical Cauldron does, don't you. Can't you give me a hint as to its purpose?'
Harry bent forward, placing his elbows on his knees and resting his forehead on his palms. “I'm sorry for falling asleep on your floor. Thank you for moving me to the sofa and providing me with a blanket.”
My dad chokes as Mr Potter laughs. It's a big laugh, one that comes from his belly. I like it.
“I don’t care! I hate Draco! Tell him to go away.”
“Magic brought me back for a reason, you know.”
Harry could see his eyes roll into the back of his head. “Then don't get me mad.”
Draco was naked, in bed, with him, and it was glorious. His body above him was glowing in the candlelight. Harry was unsure where to start, and when Draco lowered himself onto Harry, Harry was unsure how to think.
Draco pulled a book from the side table and handed it to Harry. Someone had left a bookmark in the middle of the book, so Harry started there.
Above the white blanket were small flimsy clouds that danced across the sky and brushed past the ship. Draco reached out and grazed his fingertips along one.
“Anything, I'll do anything for you.”
seemed to know what it was doing, but she was a ship, not a person, and therefore might not have the safety of the crew in mind.
“Do you want to see the trees as a part of the structure, or not.”
“How could I, Harry? Not when I saw your face every time I closed my eyes, felt my arms circling your waist. I know nothing ever happened. I know I had no right to hope, but I did, especially after you testified for me. You were so kind to me during the rebuilding of Hogwarts. We had such long talks, just you and me and the stars. And remember that broom ride? The fight to the Snitch? I finally caught it, Harry. I finally caught it, and then you were gone.”
“I’m going to run up to Cambridge, then. You boys call me if you find anything else. Good luck trying to enter the house. The London boys are still working on ours.”
, biding Nott with a tight rope.
Harry heart began to start again, except now beating in an alarmingly fast rate. “I don’t understand what you are talking about.”
"Not for a few minutes. I was just suggesting to my son that perhaps he should wash off all that teenage smell."
Finn ran off, suspiciously wiping his eyes.
“So, will this continue past tomorrow, or was this just for the duration of the tree house building?”
Harry shook his head, hoping the early hour and his strange landing into someone’s lawn was causing the misunderstandings. “Muggle? Is that a word?”
“What was that?”
"No! Your prickness, your attitude, your stupidness."
As if suddenly realizing Draco's lack of attire, Dean turned quickly and threw his hands over his eyes. 'Would someone mind telling me what is going on?'
Snape was growing desperate. He was never at the cottage, always off in remote locations trying to find anything to help, or at least slow the process down. But nothing worked, and nothing was keeping the magic from consuming Draco.
“You remember me, Harry?”
Harry felt frozen. His body refused to move, refused to turn away from Draco as he approached his bed. Harry did nothing when Draco slowly lifted Harry’s sheets and he did nothing when Draco lay on top of him, his long hair blocking Harry’s peripheral vision so all he could see was Draco’s face.
Soon the rest of the crew was digging like mad using a variety of tools and spells.
Draco kissed his temple.
Draco brought his other elbow up, digging both of them into Harry's chest as he rested his chin on his hands. “Only because you were staring at that bell like it was a 24 karat diamond.”
"I hope so. Although someone has got to teach that boy how to dress. All that leather every day definitely can't be good for him."
"So, er, you're an Auror?"
Ron nodded and began eating his cupcake again. Hermione only nodded her head slightly, but Harry knew that look. She wasn’t promising anything and most likely was just waiting for Ron not to be within earshot to tell Harry what she thought.
"Did they teach you at Hogwarts how to see the future in the ripples of black coffee?"
At 11:59 a.m. there was a sharp knock on the door. Harry had baked a loaf of bread for his visitor, a favorite snack for guests. Bread always made the house smell warm and inviting and no matter what, guests always liked bread. He placed the fresh loaf, with a few slices cut, on the living room coffee table, and went to answer the door.
And for me, well I love bragging to my friends that my house is the best-looking one in the street, although, it really doesn’t get me very far.
Draco curled his toe against Harry’s.
The older man laughed. 'Sir Culhwich?'
Draco laughed, “No, just I want to finish this by myself. This way the tree house can be surprise to both you and Teddy. Trust me, this is the easiest part. The spells are already on the wood. Now, it's just telling them all where to go. Go inside. Make me the best dinner you’ve ever made. I deserve a reward for putting up with you.”
Downstairs is a large kitchen with a window box full of herbs over the sink and a variety of cereals in plastic containers on the counter. I’m a Cheerios man, but my father likes the Cornflakes, and on Sundays we both like the ones with raisins, so it’s imperative that all three are available for easy access.
and it took me a while to get over it, but I did; couldn't pine for you forever. It was then that I met Sam who, sorry to say this, Harry, is light years better for me than you. You're my Captain, Harry, not my lover. So please, don't worry so much about me. Okay?'
"What?"
The sweat was beginning to pool behind his knees. He looked toward Malfoy, but he was no help, smirking behind his large purple coffee cup. Oh no! He was bad at this. So Harry did what he did best, jumped in heard first and lied, horribly.
‘Thank you.’
Draco was not willing to listen. “I said get out!”
Malfoy looked at him, his hair obscuring part of his eyes and making Harry have a really hard time not reaching out to brush it back.
“What are you doing?”
Draco surged up in a feat of amazing strength and bit Harry hard on the ear. “It's a bloody eyesore, as are you. I much prefer doing this in the dark.”
Harry, finally at his destination, grabbed hold of Draco's hand, lifted it, and kissed tenderly Draco's knuckle. “Enough.”
“It’s not a prank. I’m just here to help Draco.”
Thank you to all who helped me with research and cheered me on, including cleo_jay, tari_sue, thesamanthahope, and winnett.
Harry basked in the slow, calm sensation of Draco’s lips on his hand.
Draco shook his head. “If you have difficulty coming up with anything intelligent to say, you can read to me. Severus was reading me Yeats.”
“I didn’t understand it. I’d never really liked a boy before, but that’s how I felt. I hadn’t thought much beyond that at the time. There was a lot on my plate, with rebuilding Hogwarts and trying to figure out my future. But it was nice, to have you around. I missed you, a lot. Maybe I’ve grown delusional and you’re a figment of my imagination.”
~ * ~
The goblin turned a sharp eye back to him as if he could read Harry's thoughts. 'I know a few tricks myself so you best not try to come below.'
Has given the waves their melody,
"Why is he staying with us?"
“Harry, I know you have a difficult time believing you are Teddy’s parent, but you are. And that means eventually Teddy is going to want to distance himself from you, become his own man. You have to let him do that. But he does need you. He needs you to be there for him when he does want you to join him in the tree house. He needs you to provide for him support and love him.”
Draco had not entered his bed nude, but he was now. Sleeping on his stomach with the sheet twisted around his right leg, Harry could see the sweat trickle from the top of his back, down his spine, and off to the side, right before reaching his perfectly-shaped arse.
Malfoy had only spent a few moments glancing at the books before walking away, none the wiser to Harry standing on the other side. Harry hadn't seen Malfoy since that last night at Hogwarts and seeing him, now, dressed in smart trousers and a light jacket with a dark blue scarf, shook Harry more than it should have. Malfoy looked so grown up, as if the few months since the war had aged him at least five years, but in a good way. Malfoy was an adult; he carried himself like an adult. But what was Harry? With his t-shirt and jeans, unwashed hair and scruffy stubble, Harry was eons away from adulthood.
“I do notice! I do!”
Sir Culhwich shrugged. 'I don't know. If it is, the dark magic is long gone. It would be just broken fragments. But then again, myths are stories told generation to generation. Details would be lost. Names changed. And sometimes, myths were stories designed to hide the truth.'
'My goldfinch. Where is my goldfinch? Do you have my goldfinch? My poor goldfinch. My one and only goldfinch.'
My father laughs. "So Twelfth Night this year will be extra special. We’ll celebrate both the end of Christmas and the end of my probation. Sound good?"
Harry signalled to his crew to continue their search in the woods without him. Harry had other plans. He was going to go back to the other side of the lake to stop Draco from using the Magical Cauldron.
“Do you mind if I pop back home to change? I feel disgusting.”
Taking a breath, Harry took a step back, throwing his wet hair out of his face, and tried to think about the situation at hand. This wasn't supposed to happen! He should have known. He should have listened to his instincts.
I shoot up, my ninja-like reflexes failing me as I knock into the table, banging my knees and shaking the gold china plates and the fancy gravy boat my grandmother sent us for Christmas. My mind explodes into worry and I blurt out the first thing that comes to me.
Draco finally stood, slowly. Harry noticed that it required some effort and that Draco was holding onto the sides of the chair tightly. “Harry, I need you to do something for me.”
“Happened with what?”
The ship shivered for a moment, forcing Draco and his crew to all reach for something to hold. It then paused, as if suspended on the top of the waves. Harry's stomach lifted in anticipation. And then, the
Draco walked out of the door completely, but turned back to Harry for a slight moment.
His skin was pale.
Harry followed Dean to the quarterdeck, following where Dean was pointing. Far, far, into the clouds was a small black spot.
Draco had told him to make the

Dean chimed in his support, 'Is this a fool's errand? Do you even know what you are doing, Malfoy?'
Padma continued, 'I asked, but as Draco stated before, he can't answer any of our questions due to the Unbreakable Vow. The black cauldron myth is the only thing that makes sense, although I have no idea what Draco would want with a broken cauldron.'
“Draco, I would like to repeat this over and over again for as long as possible. And I don’t mean just the sex. I mean the hand holding, and the stargazing, the letters and the meals. I want you to come over and help me build Teddy the biggest castle made out of building blocks. I want to go shopping together and buy furniture for this house. I want to learn what it feels like to run my tongue down the vein in your cock. Draco, I want everything. Is that okay?”
He arrived back at Draco's cottage in the afternoon, groggy and distracted. One of his trouser legs was caught inside his sock and his shirt was inside out.
"Mister Potter, you may go. I believe I have some things I need to take care of before this evening's Sorting. Please remember our agreement. You will support the Sorting Hat's decision and you will vouch for his validity." She began to raise her wand.
I turn over the picture quickly. I don't want to see Mr. Potter or my father like this. This is not who my father is anymore.
"It's not Professor Binns's classroom anymore. He retired. Malfoy teaches there now."
"I’ve invited someone to spend Twelfth Night with us. I hope you don’t mind."
“Um, I want to know everything.”
My stomach drops. I had thought much worse, thought perhaps my father had decided to take me back to the wizarding world. Having a guest over wasn’t so bad, except I don’t really feel comfortable with someone else in the house for our celebration.
“Most likely he didn’t think it was abnormal. He probably thought it was hot.”
There’s laughter and then a sigh. “Have you ever smelled a teenager's shoes after they've spent a day in them without socks?”
'Luna, you missed quite a day.'
‘No!’, the King finally yelled, choking and straining in his pinned clothing.
“Please, please, PLEASE!”
Finn yelled out, “
“I will tell you, only if you start arranging the sticks. Its not pointless work, there is a reason for all of this. It will make the tree house better using the natural wood from the area.”
I can't tell if the voice belongs to my father, as it currently sounds like a regretful house-elf begging to iron his ears with an added hiss of a bike tire running out of air. My brain throbs, my back aches.
This year, Harry was determined to buy the best gift for Teddy, on his own. He had started early and was going to scour each shop in Diagon Alley until he found the perfect gift. If Harry could defeat a six-foot lizard man set on his destruction he could purchase a birthday gift for his soon to be five–year-old godson.
But now, instead of a tall stately Elder tree, its branches out and full of leaves, there now stood a very strange sight.
The squid’s eye bored into Draco. The tentacles curled and uncurled, sliding along the wet walls.
Harry lifted his hands in surrender, but he was not leaving without some sort of reassurance that Draco was doing something about the bark. A year ago, would Harry have been as stubborn as he was now in regards to Draco’s well being? Perhaps not, but it felt right to be stubborn. Something inside him was telling him this was the right course.
Harry nodded his head and made his way out of the Chief’s office.
Harry rounded up the rest of crew, including a confused Luna and an overly protective Padma. They ran out of the castle and out into the rain, mounting their brooms as soon as they reached the dirt and flying towards the
“Oh.”
Draco turned and sneered down at the old and dirty trainers.
'Actually, you didn't. You filed the paperwork without the official Ministry seal, deeming the contract null and void. Funny, but I thought all contracts were magically checked for the seal by the Ministry clerks. A certain Lavender Brown, fellow Gryffindor and current Ministry clerk, wouldn't have anything to do with that, now would she?'
Harry brightened at the sound of his old friend’s voice.
And then, before my back connects with the next step, I'm floating. My mind, still anticipating the hit, shuts down completely when what was expected does not happen. I'm either saved or dead, and I'm placing my bets on dead. I throw an arm over my eyes, horribly embarrassed to have died falling down the stairs. Not much cachet in death by socks.
Bill’s three-year-old daughter, Victoire, talked a mile a minute, in a combination of English, French and strange baby talk that only Fleur could understand. Teddy thought she was crazy, but she was one of the few kids around his age and the two tended to get grouped together in family events.
“And me? Well I just went back the Manor.”
And right on cue Neville swept in. Most of the students waved hello and many cheered "Neville!"
“I, Harry James Potter, vow to never separate from Draco Malfoy. Where he goes, I go, even in death.”
The words had slipped out. Harry flushed, realizing it sounded very, well, flirty.
The cauldron was bubbling. Draco was standing next to it, naked, his wand at his side.
With a flick of his wrist, Draco pulled out a small leather pouch. He pulled out a piece of yellowed parchment and placed it on top of Harry's papers on his desk.
Draco advanced rapidly on Harry, his voice lowering to a harsh whisper. “Don’t talk about that here! This is a Muggle place!”
' and he could hear the others calling out spells, but it was too late. Suddenly, the crew, minus Luna, found themselves outside the castle, in the rain, a ward shimmering between them and the castle, keeping them out.
“Oh?”
Once removed, Draco returned, lying flat against Harry. For the first time in their exchange, Draco’s intense look changed. The edge of his lips began to rise. Harry’s lips on their own accord rose with them. Without thinking he reached out, kissing those tempting, smirking lips.
The sun began to dip lower. Harry wasn’t hungry yet, but he heard a deep rumble coming somewhere in the middle of Draco’s stomach.
I roll my eyes and put the orange juice back in the fridge. Sometimes I think my father uses his magic to figure out what I’m thinking.
“Trees, A Natural History. Interested in trees?”
Harry ran towards Ron, but he had already yelled out for his home and disappeared in the flames. Harry laughed and settled back into the coach. This issue of
“You are playing with magic you do not understand. This magic is old. Its rules are not our rules.”
Harry smiled. Usually that was code for
"The Ministry now is working so hard to distance itself from the mistakes it made during the war that they aren't seeing how each law they pass makes it closer than before. The fact that shops can ban anyone based on their familial ties to a convicted criminal is wrong, and the rule itself was made by one person. Everyone else just went along with it."
My father knew my mother for exactly three days before she became pregnant. It was a chance meeting between two previous socialites who had been shamed out of their social scene; my father because he allowed Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and my mother because her father was found guilty of funneling money to Voldemort. They were a distraction for each other, one that didn't last very long.
"Go back upstairs and take a shower. You’re sweating like a pig and you probably smell. I won't have a smelly teenager in front of company."
'How much longer, Harry?' Dean yelled from the back. Harry turned in response, walking backwards. Unfortunately, not looking in front of him, Harry failed to see the hole in the path and fell backwards into it. Draco attempted to catch him, but instead was pulled down into the hole as well. They fell for a second, before landing harshly on the hard ground.
“No, the part about me being gay and not really knowing anyone else to talk to about it.”
While riding, Harry felt a buzz on his hip. He pulled into an alley way and turned off his bike before reaching for the phone.
Harry greeted all he passed on his way to the sixth level with a firm nod and small friendly smile. He did not stop to chat, nor did he stay and listen to the morning gossip, preferring to purchase the latest
All disclaimers and thank yous on Part One :) Enjoy!
After that thrilling conversation, my mind starts to wander, and I wonder if Mr. Potter wears a badge like the cops do on television. I don't remember any badges on the Aurors when I was little, but that was a long time ago and perhaps times have changed.
“I'm apologizing in advance.”
I jump, not expecting my father to be downstairs so fast. He pokes me in the shoulder and lifts his eyebrow. I lift mine back to say, ‘I can do that too, you know.’
“I’m not seeing anyone! I just really don’t like dating.”
The two enjoyed the petting for awhile, Draco swaying underneath Harry’s ministrations.
The fire cracked and swelled as Ron scratched his head. 'The girls are fine; it’s the one in the oven that's driving her mental. The little bugger sleeps during the day and kicks all night. If it continues, Hermione's threatened to make me carry the baby. It's scary!'
Padma bristled. 'You are much too smart to believe in such tales.'
“All the wood in here is fireproofed. It’s a spell I did without you.”
“Well, why don’t I give you a tour and you can shower me with praise the whole way, okay?”
“Lord, Potter, do you ever just shut up? No, no one helps me. It is a delicate process that requires a lot of magical strength. I can’t just hire anybody from off the street! I can do a simpler design if you want it quicker, or I can be less careful about whether the beams are put in properly, which might mean the building could collapse at any minute. I’m sure your godson’s life is not nearly as valuable as having this done on time.”
Underneath a stack of large blue boxer shorts I hit the jackpot. I curl my lips, trying not to think of the state of Mr. Potter's pants, and peal back the shorts to reveal a manila folder with paperclips attached.
'Harry! Are you okay, mate?'
“Everything? Are you sure?”
Draco nodded, but continued to look out in front of him. The lack of response irritated Harry.
“Shit.”
Draco's eyes shot up. “You Apparated?”
“Harry, even though you were upset today, I bet you never let Teddy see that. Am I right?”
Suddenly there was a large sound from the other side of the lake. There was shouting and loud noises and then nothing.
Harry cried out, rushing towards the cauldron, but a blast of light sent him flying back.
They kissed, until Harry drew back, a thought coming to mind.
“Malfoy, I'm knackered. I'm going to bed. You should go, too.”
I run up the stairs, taking two at a time, determined to protect my father from the beefy idiot who has invaded our home.
“I promise I’ll come out for cake.”
“I’m making eggs benedict.”
A woman with short black hair and a pinched nose, wearing only a skimpy bathrobe and nothing else, leaned out of the front door, her blood red nails clashing sharply with the pale green frame.
"Well since you aren’t there, I might as well take all those striped boxers you begged me to buy you and hang them on the oak trees out front instead of the ribbons. I’m sure all the girls on the street would love to see your pants flying in the wind."
Harry pulled on Draco's hand before they reached the steps, bringing Draco's face close to his.
Harry could barely think over the buzzing in his ear and the throb from his erection.
It was one trunk; that was certain. It looked like a marbled mix of Elder wood and something else. Then the trunk split into two, but the two parts were wrapped around each other, like an embrace. The branches were curled inward. There was no part of the Elder wood that was not mixed with the other wood. The other tree was tougher, and the leaves were dark green and sharp. Snape took a step closer, touching the bark of the other wood. A leaf came out and struck his hand, making him bleed.
. Harry had spelled the map to follow their movements, spell work he learned while studying the Marauder's Map, and yet their shoe prints never came close to the location. Harry swore the destination was changing as they travelled.
Mr Potter drags off his robe and throws it on the bed. "I don't really like wearing the uniform," he replies, his voice muffled by the jumper that has ridden up over his chin.
Harry stood next to Draco scanning the map. 'Does it say anything else about what's ahead or the inhabitants?'
The cuddling is nice, for a while, until my father pushes me away and hits me upside the head, my brain knocking into my skull.
My father blushes, again, and tucks his hair behind his ear. “Thank you, Harry. Although I would have preferred you compliment me after you finished eating.”
Luna and Dean kept firm hands on his shoulders while Padma and Finn rushed toward Draco's body. They ran a wand over his body, but their disappointed looks were confirmation enough of what had happened.
"And before you ask I have no idea what the box in the left hand corner means."
Everything was going well. They were laughing and stealing kisses, and then Harry put his foot in his mouth.
Draco slapped his face. “Potter! Don't you dare come without taking this cock ring off of me!”
There's a sound I don't recognize. It's soft, and a bit wet. After it happens a few times I figure out it's the sound of kissing. Gods, why do they have to do that in front of me?
“You cook?”
“Potter, quit drooling all over the sticks and get over here. I need your brute strength and I need it now.”
"Anyone I know?"
It was worse when we visited my grandfather and grandmother. My grandfather would curl his lip until it reached his nose when my father said it, and my grandmother’s eyes would fill with tears. My father would grab my grandmother’s hand, squeezing it in sympathy, until my mother gave an annoyed sigh and he let go.
Hermione Flooed over in her excitement to present Harry with several reference books she just happened to pick up. The few things Hermione attempted to explain to him made his head hurt and the book Hermione left for him to look at,
Harry Transfigured his glasses to binoculars to take a closer look. There in the sky was a small flying fishing boat, but it was too far away to see any more details.
Mr. Potter smiles more broadly and takes out his wand in his giant hand. “You heard us, didn't you?”

"Well, you know I’ve been on probation since the war?"

Draco turned his head looking away from Harry. He spoke his words to the wall.
And then Draco was inside him, his hard cock filling Harry to the brim. Harry was so full of Draco, so full of his love and his body. Harry pulled Draco down for a kiss, wrapping his legs around Draco's back, pulling him in deeper. It hurt, and it was over very quickly, but it had been the best experience in Harry's life.
Nott sent a strong Severing Charm toward Luna, who deftly avoided the spell by transforming into a goldfinch. The tree behind her fell over as she transformed right back. She threw an
Snape stepped forward. “Good to see you, Draco. We have missed you greatly.”
“How bad?” Harry clipped back. He knew from the violent scene inside the Fletchley's home that something bad was bound to happen.
Harry looked up wiping tears from his eyes.
During his search for the Horcruxes, Harry dreamt of a world without Voldemort and the constant attacks against his mind. The dream usually placed him back at Hogwarts, returning to the normal minutiae of schoolwork and Quidditch games. And yet now, when Harry imagined himself racing to class and searching for a clean tie underneath his bed, it all felt wrong. But what did that leave for Harry to do? He had never considered the possibility of not wanting to return to Hogwarts.
'Listen to me, Harry,' Dean said firmly, his eye boring into Harry's. 'You may have made the decision, but if Luna or I didn't agree to it, we wouldn't have followed you. We all had the opportunity to leave you, and we didn't. We stayed on your ship, followed your missions, because we believed in you and what you fought for. We had no way of knowing Shiraq just wanted control of the country. We did what we thought was right.'
“What the fuck,” he uttered between heavy gulps of air.
“Hi, Andromeda, I made them for dinner tonight. I think there are a few left. There’s also some leftover dinner on the counter under a warming charm.”
“Permanent Sticking Charms are hard to get rid of, Potter. Planning on becoming part of my tree house?”
"Very good, Miss Jadeson. Class, I would like all of you to think of a law that you find you disagree with in the current Ministry. I would like you all to write 10 feet of parchment on the subject. Tell me about the law and give me both pros and cons. At the end, I want you to truly convince me that the law should change and how you, as average citizens, can do something to change it. I know it's a large assignment, but I'm giving you a week. The more research the better. At the end of the class I will pick the best essay and we, as a class, will carry out the suggestion to change the law. Class dismissed."
“Wait! You’re gay too?”
More than likely, the ship had originally come from the island, so Harry planned to keep an eye on it, but held off his concern until it posed an actual threat. At the moment, it was too far away to tell in what direction it was heading.
The voice stilled. Harry and Draco paced around the hole.
From joy the holy branches start,
‘Very well done, youngest Malfoy. You can find the Magical Cauldron at the bottom of Lake Bheith in the centre of the island.’
In our cottage there are three bedrooms upstairs, the largest room for my father and his big dressers that smell like cedar, the second-biggest for me, which I decorated myself with posters of all the best cyclists, including Eddie Merckx, and a guest room that is used mostly for storage.
“Harry! Mate! Are you home? Can I come over?”
“Teddy wrote you a letter.”
Harry laughed amazed that Draco would even be willing to attend a party filled with people he was obviously uncomfortable with. His only condition for coming was that he was allowed to bring his mother. Since she and Andromeda had started corresponding Harry didn’t really see a problem. He warned Hermione and Ron ahead of time of the Malfoys’ presence, and hopefully they had the good sense to warn everyone else. Ron wasn’t too happy about it, but Harry had received an owl earlier in the day asking him how he got Teddy to shut up about Draco. He then admitted that even he could see the affection Teddy had for “the git” and that if Draco got out of line he would turn him into a white ferret to entertain the kids. For Ron, it was a good sign.
Harry found his lighter, but after a few failed attempts of lighting his cigarette under the rain, he tucked the thing over his ear. “You're wearing your I.D. card.”
“We were lovers,” he stated without question.
Harry decided to test it out, just to see if things were still the same.
Harry’s eyes travelled the length of Draco’s body. First, he took in Draco’s face, which was surprisingly made up with make up, but the effect was subtle. He had added rouge to his cheeks, a slight shimmer to his lips, and his eyelashes were more pronounced. His hair was loose with a small blue headband pulling the strands back. His chest was covered with a light blue corset with a white ribbon down the front, tying him in. The corset was low cut, emphasizing Draco’s beautifully long neck and his lickable collarbone which Draco had accented with a simple silver chain with a drop pearl pendant. Then, there was the skirt, the beautifully short, ruffled blue skirt with a cute little white apron. The skirt had at least seven or eight layers, but it was short. So short, that when Draco twirled, Harry could see the frilly matching blue knickers underneath. Harry's eyes continued down, enjoying Draco’s impossibly long legs covered in beautifully silky white stockings that came up to his thighs. The tops of the tights were covered with a large block of lace that Harry itched to touch and a little cute bow with a blue heart button in the center.
Draco pointed straight up. “See. The window frames the constellation perfectly. Did you know that Draco is filled with binaries? According to Professor Sinistra it means that anyone born under its influence is destined to mate for life.”
Draco stepped up next to him and began to lightly graze his crotch again. His erection had begun to wane in his worry, but Draco’s touch brought it right back up to size. Draco bit his lip in concentration, watching Harry’s face as if Harry were a spooked wild animal.
Malfoy briskly walked out of the shop. Harry followed and began to walk towards the park, nervously looking around the streets to make sure there was no one he knew out, and looking back at Malfoy to make sure he didn’t disappear.
grabs it and shakes it, his grip crushing my poor delicate bones. I smile half-heartedly when he releases my hand, hiding it behind my back and shaking out the pain.
"I told you never to talk about Alex again in my presence!"
Draco grew serious, his smile fading into a small frown. “For a fleeting, and rather foolish moment, I thought you were there to rescue us. But we Malfoys, we don’t need rescuing, right? We just invited Voldemort into our home to threaten and torture us, right? But that’s why I didn’t say anything. I thought you had a plan and somehow I could help you. Silly thought, really.”
'He was the first one to chase after Lestrange,' Dean responded.
"You never asked nor cared if I was seeing anyone."
My father laughs and pours my mushy cereal down the drain.
Harry chuckled and ran inside to make the Floo call. Star’s Palace delivered within fifteen minutes via Floo and had the best naan.
Written for the 2008 hd_inspired fest. This story will be in two parts. The first part is very plot heavy. Draco, and the relationship, will be mostly featured in part two. Enjoy!
“Hold on! Just let me get used to it a little.”
"Afterward, you should get dressed. As I said, I want us to do the outside decorations first."
“Whose is this? It looks like your Manor.”
Draco squished closer and squeezed Harry’s hand.
Harry agreed with her. For all her strange antics, Luna was more logical than anyone else he knew – even Hermione, although he was sure never to tell her that.
Without a second guess, Harry immediately took him to his flat, tearing off Draco's impossibly tight trousers in the hallway towards his bedroom with a flick of his wand, splitting them down the seams. When Draco attempted to take off the leather strap from around his neck Harry slapped his hand away forcefully, enough to make Draco step back in apprehension. As reassurance and punishment for daring to remove Harry's new favorite toy, he Transfigured a nearby quill into a small silver bell and stuck it in the center of the collar.
Dean then smiled up at Harry. And for the first time, Harry didn't feel the weight of guilt on his heart. Perhaps something good had come from his day.
“To you, yes.”
'Harry!' Draco yelled, his hand still stroking Fawkes’s feathers. 'May I speak with you a moment?'
“I didn’t know what do to, okay. I wanted to keep the tree house a secret for both Teddy and Andromeda. I panicked!”
“Fine! It was..." Harry hesitated, and then took a big breath for courage. "It was Fred actually.”
Draco pulled their entwined hands to his face and kissed Harry’s knuckles.
Draco folded his arms and looked out the small porthole. 'It's not your fault, either. The King was mad, let's just leave it at that.'
, Draco thought. He kicked off the covers and headed to the front room, knowing in his bones, who it was. No one, other than Potter, would show up at his doorstep at eight in the morning and stick himself to a tree. Better to see what he wanted than leave him in the Malfoy trees. Somehow, Potter would end up fighting an epic battle with the squirrels and it would end up being his fault.
And all the trembling flowers they bear.”
Draco looked away, but entwined their fingers.
“I just did what you told me!”
Katie, bouncing on her heels, came rushing forward, giving Harry a bone crushing hug.
“I…” Harry stopped. Andromeda stood up and headed toward the kitchen.
Harry rubbed the smooth skin, rubbing up and down the side of Draco's stomach.
“So we left. Teddy is convinced that someone is going to take you away. I tried to reassure him, but he’s frightened.”
Harry wiped his hands on the towel and began to go upstairs, only to hear Teddy in his room. He poked his head in seeing Teddy with a smock, paint all over his fingers, and paint all over Draco’s easel.
Draco turned and beamed at Harry, holding onto his frilly skirt as it twirled.
Draco smartly took the lead as they lay in the bed. He gently and patiently prepared Harry, expressing his love with each swipe and press. Harry cried out when Draco touched something inside, making his toes curl.
"Come on, just tell me. It's a prank that's gone on too long and it needs to end. Tell me who it is and I can stop working on the case and spend the rest of my holiday in your bed."
Mrs Granger frowned. “I seem to have completely misplaced my glasses.”
“Kreacher brought me here!”
Harry shrugged. 'No one knows. The
Draco raised himself up a bit and bent down to kiss Harry. The kisses weren’t new, but the added benefit of being horizontal seemed to instantly take things to a higher intensity than before.
Draco stood at the end of the bed and smirked. He turned around and shimmied a bit before bending entirely over. Harry’s breath caught seeing the glorious arse that he loved so much on display in such a wanton way. Harry wanted to reach out and give it a nice good smack, but he held still, waiting to see what Draco had planned.
Draco turned Harry’s face towards him.
"No."
“Draco, I don’t understand why I’m on this train.”
Harry attempted to ignore the heated gaze between his assistant and Neville.
“Okay. I’m ready. But go slow okay? The spells will make it easier, but you still need to go slow.”
Draco looked out the window, sucking in a breath.
Harry scratched his wrist and bit his lip. Merlin, he was bad at small talk.
Harry had a sudden urge to talk to Malfoy; to reassure himself that time hadn't raced forward without Harry noticing. Maybe it had been a trick of the light, or the display window had warped glass.
“You dated that Weasley girl.”
For most things Harry could rely on his friends, but they too failed at finding appropriate gifts for someone so young. When Teddy was three, George had stuffed a few Canary Creams in Teddy's stocking. Harry hadn’t thought Teddy would appreciate being a giant bird but allowed the gift to remain, believing his friend to know better than he. Only after an hour of crying and promises to never give him sweets again did Teddy calm down. To this day, Teddy shied away from sweets, no matter how tasty.
The Tree House
'Before we rush into things, how do we know it's safe?' Harry interrupted, his face growing hard. 'I won't risk the lives of my crew.' Without forethought, Harry glanced over at Dean who instantly turned his face away from Harry's. Harry's stomach flipped realizing his mistake.
When Harry was silent, Draco pushed him out the door.
Harry took the opportunity to speak his mind. 'I'm not sure what game you are playing at, Malfoy, but I do not appreciate it. Personally, I think you have something to hide and all this poking and prodding is just a way to distract me. As I said from the beginning, the instant I see danger, this mission is over. And that includes if I think this Magical Cauldron of yours is dangerous. I'm keeping my eye on this island, and you.'
Draco shook his head. “No, it just keeps growing.”
Harry fell back into the grass, staying close enough to Draco to smell his woodsy scent.
“Yes. He and your son are gay together.”
Harry stood beside him, whispering out of the corner of his mouth, ‘How were you able to release that bird?’
“A little banged up, but nothing serious.
Neville began repeating the phrase.
Perhaps it was the flood of blood in his heart, or the moonlight, but Harry loved to watch the light return into Draco's eyes. And Draco, as he returned to full awareness, would stare back into Harry's green eyes, allowing Harry to see the life grow vibrantly into Draco's gray ones. The life would rise, like steam,  and Harry watched every precious and beautiful moment. Draco was beautiful. How had Harry failed to notice?
Ron waved his hands. 'Wait! But you have to hear this, it'll only take a second, and I promise it's all true. Lisa told Justin who told Ernie who told Hannah who told George who told me that Malfoy's gone completely mental and has now started to dress like a Druidic Warrior!'
Teddy hugged Harry hard, but his cries were softening. After a few moments Teddy fell asleep on his shoulder. He and Andromeda walked him into Teddy’s room. Harry placed him in the bed and tucked him in, planting a kiss on his forehead. He hugged Andromeda and then she fled to her room. She looked to be on the verge of crying herself.
Draco turned his head over, careful not to jerk Harry’s hand away from his petting.
Harry shrugged. “I don't know. You keep them.”
Suddenly, the bird flew off Draco's shoulder and quickly began to morph. Where a goldfinch once was, a small pale girl with blond hair and large wide blue eyes now stood.
The visits then increased to once every two weeks. Like an appetizer before a meal; the sex was just enough to wet the stomach, but not enough to fill it. Soon, Harry was hearing the bell once a week, on Friday nights at two in the morning. Harry could smell the scent of smoke and alcohol and know that Draco had been out dancing, but Harry didn’t care, so had he. And then the visits were every night. Harry thought it a perfectly natural that Draco would share his bed each night and leave in the morning. If Draco was anything like Harry, he needed a good orgasm to sleep and it was becoming more and more difficult to produce one without that damn bell sound and the feel of Draco’s arse around his cock. And humans needed their sleep. It was a scientific fact.
“Yeah, you mentioned it.”
Indeed, it sounded as if Andromeda and Narcissa were in the kitchen laughing.
He left the sitting room and headed to his office. He passed the wall of fame, as he was calling it, that was covered in drawings of stick figures, dragons, clouds and dinosaurs. He sat down in his office chair, lifting his large feathered quill. He had a letter to write, if it was going to reach the lawyer in time.
“Oh!” Mr. Potter exclaims, “Finite.”
“You didn’t?”
He would, eventually. Harry knew that was his fate, but not yet. He couldn't do it yet.
Harry reached out and grabbed hold of Draco’s sleeve.
Draco teased Harry's entrance with the wet fingers, circling in a maddeningly slow way. Harry arched into it, his movements begging Draco to go in deeper. Draco relented, probing first with one and then adding another after Harry whinged and wiggled for more.
There was something that nagged at the back of Harry’s brain. Ollivander had mentioned that the magic was calling out to him. Harry felt himself out, truly assessing his own feelings. There were no faint noises, no soft whispers urging him to find a tree or carve wood. Perhaps Ollivander was mistaken?
“Wait! At least let me give you my daughter’s address. I know she would love to see you.”
Fifteen minutes into his shower, Draco always invaded it, stealing Harry's soap straight from his hands, and pushing him out of the water spray so Draco could use it entirely. Harry would let him, mostly because while Draco was distracted with washing, Harry would take the opportunity to fondle all his favourite Draco bits.
“Harry!”
"Right. Well it seems as if this is done. It was a good couple of fucks, but I don't sleep with men who can't see past their own noses."
Harry looked deep into his teacup. Could he really do it? Cut down Draco and whittle him down into a stick he didn't even want.
Harry wished Draco was awake so that perhaps they could talk about tomorrow’s events. But Harry was unsure what he could really say.
Harry held his breath, unsure what the animal was going to do next.
“Harry, you should not have done what you did.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to hide his head in shame. Trust Malfoy to pull that emotion out of him.
Harry whistled. “This perp obviously is not too fond of children.”
“You heard the man,” my father states, puffing out his chest. “End my probation, Officer.”
“Shut up, so anyway he doesn’t respond to my questions so I look back on the bed and there he is, wanking, right in front of me, and staring right at me. He doesn’t stop.”
Neville stuffed a sausage in his mouth and shrugged his shoulders. The pair continued to eat, reading the newsletter over and over between them.
“Goodnight, Harry.”
Draco pulled Harry along to the bathroom, throwing the clothes into a pile in the corner. They instantly disappeared. Harry squawked.
“Your face, Potter, was so bloated! You looked like a fat pufferfish!”
Padma sneered, 'I am a trained tracker. I follow scientific clues, not fantasy conjecture. But I see you are still set on creating stories, rather than learning anything real.'
Harry walked over to Draco, maneuvering around the logs.
"It's okay, Harry. Let's sit down, yeah? Would you rather sit with me or with Neville?"
"Why not? The first years needs to be sorted. The kids need a house."
After a few minutes, Harry lay back down on the bed only to realize he wasn’t going to be able to sleep any more that night. Grunting, he gathered himself up and headed toward his closet. He threw on pants, trousers, a shirt that didn’t smell too awful, and his leather jacket and headed toward his garage.
Draco shook his head. 'It tells us nothing about who lives on the island. But considering the amount of tree growth and the lack of sound, I would say there aren't many, if any at all.'
“I am gay.”
Harry looked down. The words were blurry except the title,
'I sleep in the Captain's cabin, below the quarterdeck,' Harry replied, waving a wand to release the ropes that secured the ship to the dock.
They were in his room. They were in his room and Harry had no idea what to do. This seemed like a great idea when Draco had his hands on Harry’s crotch, but as soon as said hand left his crotch in order for them to go upstairs the thoughts began to seep in.
Teddy turned so as to shield Harry from the rest of the hall.
Draco slammed the door to his classroom and Harry was left standing outside, his stomach in his throat and his eyes suddenly burning.
"Morning, Neville."
Finally Ollivander reached a dark wooden door. He took out an old key from his vest and unlocked the door, the lock cranking as it turned. The door opened slowly, showing only darkness inside. Ollivander stepped aside and extended his arm for Harry to enter first.
The Tree House
The King began to struggle madly with the ropes.
Katie surprised him by placing a hand on his shoulder. “Listen, I know it’s not my place, but take care of yourself, okay? Go out, get drunk, get laid. Do something to get those black circles out from under your eyes. They’re hideous.”
Harry attempted to explain himself again. “You see…”
Draco flicked Harry's cheek. 'Again with the staring. You’d best be careful, or else your First Mate might get the wrong idea.' Draco and Harry both looked over at Dean who quickly turned his head back to the rope he was securing, obviously embarrassed at being caught staring. 'Oops, looks like he already has.'
Draco scrounged out the map from his pocket. A small squid-like creature appeared on the north side of the island.
“Kreacher, when you followed Malfoy in sixth year, did you notice any strange dark colouring on the back of his neck?”
“Yeah, so I walk in and Fred is lying on his bed with his pants around his ankles.”
Harry thought about apparating home, but he needed to discuss Draco’s back with him. Harry waited outside the bathroom for several minutes before realizing that perhaps Draco did not have a change of clothes inside the bathroom and would prefer Harry to not be around when he stepped out in only a towel.
Or worse.
"My uncle was killed in the war by a Death Eater that had been to Azkaban but had escaped.  Had there been some kind of a rehabilitation program, or something like this class, it might have opened the Death Eater's mind about his beliefs and values, then when he escaped he wouldn't have continued with his hate crimes. Maybe he wouldn't have escaped at all. The criminals, they don't feel remorse, they just hate the fact they are in a dark cell. Real remorse comes from guilt, and until they learn the truth they will never feel guilty."
"Did you say Exploding Treacle Tart? Oh my! Harry, I can see the words!"
Harry had a feeling he’d be pulled into the Chief’s office first thing in the morning. A fitful night’s sleep was always perfectly paired with an early morning lecture. Harry didn’t even bother removing his jacket.
“No! I’m a horrible father. I don‘t know how to be a father! I‘ve never had one. I wouldn‘t know what to do.”
My mouth waters. Currently sitting on the kitchen counter is a large, luscious, juicy, tasty, flaky, wonderful apple pie, which my father baked this morning. I've been craving it since I smelled the cinnamon and nutmeg wafting through the cottage, my father slapping my hand every time I tried to sneak a taste.
Harry had never known Luna to have interests beyond the opposite sex, but she looked happy, and seemed to thrive under the quite possessive nature of Padma.
My father’s probation stipulates that Aurors can come at any time to ransack through his home. They also have the right to haul my father off to the Ministry for questioning whenever there are suspicions of wrong-doing or, in other words, whenever the mood strikes. When my father moved us to the Muggle world the searches had stopped, but my father’s probation status felt like a constant reminder that while the Aurors had left us alone, for now, it didn’t mean they always would.
Harry gathered the edge of his sheet and bit into it. It wasn't fair. Enemies were not allowed to be naked and sweaty and fit and edible and within reach.
'We have a guest coming aboard,' Harry told the ship. 'He’s a nasty tosser, but I’m here to protect you.'
“I'm glad to have you back, Potter.”
“Does this look familiar to you?”
Had his father known what was required of his son? Had Lucius sent his only son to die for the greater good?
Harry stumbled back blindly, lost in Ollivander’s words and the swirl of Apparition.
In the midst of my father's laughter, he whispers in my ear. “My son.”
Harry turned around. Draco was standing right behind him, smiling. The shouting seemed to dim a little. Draco started moving quickly and Harry followed. They slipped through the side door and out into the anteroom, letting the other teachers deal with the uproar. The door closed and the cheering and yelling became soft murmurs through the door.
Within a split second Pansy went to casually leaning against Draco to charging at Harry full throttle. A stick was in her hand and she was screaming out words Harry had never heard before. There was a flash of light and it would have hit Harry had it not been for a giant shield that suddenly appeared before him.
"I demanded he tell me what was going on with the Green Rebellion. He told me some nonsense about trolls dancing ballet and a green pasture growing over it. I think he was trying to tell me that the Green Rebellion meets in the Room of Requirement."
Murmuring a wizard song for thee.”
Sir Culhwich, taking the largest broom, sighed before carefully mounting it. 'Been a while,' he said before swaying into the sky, his hands wrapped tight around the shaft.
"If you're looking for the professors they won't be here this morning. They have a staff meeting once a month."
He was going to mutually wank with Draco Malfoy, lover of all things evil and kicker of puppies. What did mutually wank mean really? Did that mean they wanked next to each other? Did that mean that they wanked on each other? Or, did it mean the impossible, that he would wank Draco and Draco would wank him? He was going to faint. It really didn’t matter that this was Draco Malfoy because someone was going to touch his cock, willingly.
The holy tree is growing there;
Harry leaned in. “Come on, I’ve heard from many a source that a single pout from me could soften even the meanest ogre.”
My father’s probation stipulates that Aurors can come at any time to ransack through his home. They also have the right to haul my father off to the Ministry for questioning whenever there are suspicions of wrong-doing or, in other words, whenever the mood strikes. When my father moved us to the Muggle world the searches had stopped, but my father’s probation status felt like a constant reminder that while the Aurors had left us alone, for now, it didn’t mean they always would.
Remy, Sarrington, Scarsdale, Taylor, Tottenham, Vercity, Walligton, and Washington, all Slytherin.
I pause, looking behind me again, before I lift the folder out of the suitcase. I bet this is a case file, full of criminal acts and bad guys. My hands itch to open it and I'm not very good at controlling my impulses.
Harry blinked. “You could be here alone. I’ve been here alone for a while.”
“Yes, Mother, it’s me.”
Luna huffed and returned to working on the fore sail. Having heard many a witch and wizard mock Luna with nary a change in her disposition, it was a shock to Harry to see Luna react to Padma's statement in such a way.
“My father's a good man, see? He knows I can't do magic, but he never makes me feel like I'm missing out. It's been so long since I've seen anything magical, even from him, that sometimes I forget it exists! He does everything the Muggle way, and even though he's never said, I know he does it on purpose, to make me feel comfortable. Do you know he rides a bicycle everywhere? And he purchases copies of my school books and reads them all before the start of the year so he can help me with my homework.”
He could just image Teddy falling asleep after a long day playing pretend and not having to carry him down to the house, instead tucking him in a bedroom made just for him, and then he himself crawling into a bed, a window over him so he could see the stars.
Neville and Cindy were already making out, ignorant of Harry's angry cloud forming above his head. Harry stormed out, slamming the door with the first moan from within.
“But…!”
“Draco, did you actually listen to his babbling? He wasn't upset about us, not really. In fact, I don't think he quite caught on until the very end. He was upset about that stupid letter in my suitcase, the one he found in your case file.”
A door slams and then I hear heavy shuffling in the hallway. I throw the folder back into Mr Potter's suitcase and flee downstairs, slipping on the hardwood floor again and banging into Mr Potter. He tries to help me up, but I can't face him.
“I see the rumors were false then.”
Malfoy was picking at the grass as he spoke. Harry had never heard so much from Draco before. Growing up he knew three things about Draco Malfoy: number one, Malfoy is a git, number two, Malfoy is a good Quidditch Player, and number three, Malfoy is always up to no good. But where did this fact fall into? When did Malfoy have hobbies? When did Draco become a person?
Harry didn’t believe that for a second. “No, I really want to know!”
It was only Dean and Luna who stayed until the end. Luna loved the open air and the exploration of new and exciting places. Because of her form, she often was able to fly back home at any time to pick up post or just say hello. So Harry understood why Luna felt no inclination to leave the pirate life.
I nod and jam a spoonful of Frosties in my mouth. I moan in appreciation.
Harry pulled his fingers through Draco’s hair as he spoke.
Parkinson! Harry remembered Neville saying he was a horrible boy, hated plants. Most likely he was Malfoy's favorite student, being a fan of mischief himself.
“What?! No!”
Harry tried to shake off the woman’s vice-like grip. “Excuse me, I’m not sure I know what you're talking about.”
“You do more than just play with him. I’ve seen you.”
Mrs Granger waved her hand while she dug through a pile of papers and files on her desk. “Pish posh. It’s my first holiday in ages from the office and to be honest I’ve no idea what to do with myself. I’m glad for the distraction. Is my daughter in any kind of trouble?”
Harry's eyes grew stern. 'If this Magical Cauldron has the power to revive people and it isn't broken, there is no way I would allow Malfoy to get his hands on it, no matter his reasons. Let's just hope we're wrong.'
, as the strong and sturdy oak beams turned and became as light and airy as white clouds.
Normal Does It
“You think I don't want to destroy it? I just don't know how! It’s the Elder Wand! It can't be bested!”
Mr. Potter grunts again and heads toward the loo. I watch him walk down the hallway, and I find his shuffled stomping distracting. His trainers are dirty and his wrinkled vest is sticking out in the back of his jumper.
My father isn't even looking at me. I'm tempted to blurt out what I saw, but I keep my mouth shut. The document said "if" my father does any magic, and I know my father won't. I just have to keep an eye on Harry and make sure he doesn't do something fishy like framing my father.
Once close, Luna reached out a hand to pet the body of the squid. Harry could see the damp moisture on the smooth rubbery skin and imagined what Luna was touching could not be pleasant.
“Who?”
“I really appreciated you helping rebuild Hogwarts. It took a lot for you to come back, especially when no one wanted you there.”
The two chests rubbed together and both Harry and Draco rubbed. Draco reached down and began to unzip Harry’s jeans. Harry reached down to help and together they lifted the jeans and the pants off. Harry was naked, but he really couldn’t think of anything other than
Harry bristled at the sound of Draco's voice. 'I trust this ship much more than a man who has lived alone on an island for 600 years.'
Harry grabbed Draco's tunic collar and lifted Draco to his feet. 'What was that goblin saying to you?'
My dad chokes as Mr. Potter laughs. It's a big laugh, one that comes from his belly. I like it.
Harry leaned down and kissed Cindy on the cheek.
The King dropped Luna's cage, switched his wand to the other hand and threw an unknown spell at Padma, blasting her into the wall behind her. He then swished his wand in a large upswing and suddenly all of the birdcages opened, releasing hundreds of birds into the hall.
“You're the bloody Boy-Who-Lived. Smash it with your foot.”
The light got bright, so bright that Harry had trouble seeing until a cloud passed over the sun, relieving some of the glare.
The human heart had a deeper dark side. That was why Harry had abandoned his silly childish dreams of running in and saving the day all around the world using this bloody ship and needlessly throwing his friends in danger.
If Harry felt he was hard before, it was nothing compared to the feeling of all the blood leaving his body and going straight to his cock.
“Potter, you really are nutty as a fruitcake, aren't you?”
I grip the door jam and open my mouth to spill everything to my dad, to warn him, when Mr. Potter shuffles behind me, poking his head into the kitchen.
“Hayden Draconis Malfoy, what in God’s name are you prattling on about? Are you making a scene on purpose?”
His partner, Katie, just laughed at Harry's actions. The woman always had a great sense of humour.
Harry took that time to stare at Finn, a plan forming in his mind. He hoped Finn understood what Harry wanted him to do, but at this point he had to do something.
Malfoy nodded, still looking at the bits of wood. “What should we do with the remains of the wand?”
“Harry, which spell did you do first on all the twigs?”
Harry scratched his chin. 'I just don't see Draco putting up such a fuss for a cauldron that makes food. In my gut, I feel like it does something else.'
Harry tried to hold his tongue, but it had other ideas. “I only promised to watch my thoughts, not my hands.”
Harry was growing tired of Malfoy’s snide comments. At first, he thought they were mildly funny, then somewhat amusing, and now they were downright irritating. They just never ended. No matter what Harry did or said Malfoy had something to say about it.
The Chief began to chuckle. “Do I look like I would know? They said something about the pressure levels and CO2. You know my mind turns off when they start rattling off scientific terms. Point is, the house is open and, as we feared, the residents were robbed. While the nerd folks investigate the reason for the pressure, I’d like you to see if you can find any other physical evidence. I’ve got Katie and Billy canvassing the neighbourhood for witnesses. I’ve told them to let you know if they find anything.”
While my speech certainly could have been better, Mr Potter is in for a real treat. When my father gets angry he's a scary sight to behold, and while I wandered a bit, the point was clearly stated. There is no way my father will allow Mr Potter to stay with us any longer.
“Yeah, Potter lived with his relatives, never really knew why. The kid wasn't the kind to share too much information 'bout himself.”
But they were both saved from conversation by the crash of the door downstairs and the rumble up the stairs. Teddy was home and sounded to be in a bad mood. He threw open the door and ran at Harry, demanding to be picked up. Teddy was getting a little big, so Harry struggled, but he could feel the little boy shaking. Andromeda came up fast on his heels.
“I thought I hid those textbooks pretty well. What were you doing underneath my bed?”
“Help each other out how?”
“He’s doing all right. They stabilized him at St Mungo's.”
Draco lifted the map. 'We landed here,' he pointed to the edge of the island, leaving a small black mark on the map, 'I marked it so we know how to get back to the ship tonight.
Roots half hidden under snows,
“Master Malfoy, what should I tell them, sir?”
"Even though I've been told I'm a good guy, that I'm courageous and brave, I am also ambitious and resourceful. I wanted to be a great wizard, and I was used to getting out of tight corners with just the skin of my teeth. I had both qualities. And the truth of the matter is, had I not argued with the Hat because of a petty childhood squabble, I would have been in Slytherin.
“Harry, it's okay. Let it out. I know today was hard.”
"Oh, so you can say it but I can't?"
‘To a pureblood, the family motto is a sacred phrase that only those born or married into the family are to know. To recite the motto to non-family members is considered taboo.’
Harry sobered. “But it didn’t save you in the end.”
Draco looked at Harry sternly.
"You wanted to find out if those feelings were for men or for Alex in particular."
Draco chuckled. “Well, that’s because I actually have an understanding of what I am saying.”
