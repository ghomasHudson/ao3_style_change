Oh, and he was also dating Pansy Parkinson.
It was quiet for a few moments until Draco groaned slightly in his sleep. Harry looked down back at Draco, seeing him move his head slightly on the pillow. Pansy stepped forward again, almost pushing Hermione away from the bedside, “Oh, see. He senses my presence. I’m here Dray, I’m here.” Draco mumbled something in his sleep that was almost impossible to hear. Harry sat down again and leaned forward, Pansy copying him. Draco mumbled some more until Harry could make out something that made his heart stop.
Harry walked behind Draco and picked up the other roll of wrapping paper which had small reindeers on it, and started wrapping James’ present. He had chosen the box of Every Flavoured Beans,
“Quick thinking on your part Harry. You must be very proud of your student Horace.” Dumbledore said, calm as ever.
The pair continued wrapping gifts, occasionally stopping for a quick snog once the other moved just a little too close to the other when grabbing something. Harry was always teasing Draco by moving behind him when placing his wrapped presents in the basket, touching Draco’s hips slightly with his fingertips and breathing softly on his neck. Draco would almost drop the present he was holding whenever Harry did that, it took all of his willpower to not turn around and grab his husband’s stupid face and kiss him until he was quivering and begging. Although, his parenting was coming first now and Harry was being downright annoying,
“M-my scars? Sure, if you really want to,” He said hesitantly. He felt like he was in a dream, was he really going to strip in front of Harry Potter and show him his ugly scars?
Draco’s face changed. The smile vanished and his mouth faded into a frown, “Snogging? Who are you talking about?”
“Potter. Are you seriously sleeping here? Because I would like my whole bed to sleep in tonight, I don’t want you hogging the space.”
This is loosely based off of the movie scene with Lavender coming into the hospital and Ron says Hermione’s name, but instead it’s Drarry :D Enjoy! Oh and Voldemort is around but Theodore Nott is taking Draco’s place, and I used a lot of the lines that are said in the movie, lolz don’t attack me for copyright.
That was weird.
They were white, almost like silver strands of thread that were sewn into his skin. He had grown to not feel ashamed of them, but they still bothered him whenever he took his shirt off.
The tension was fucking insane. Draco was honestly surprised at his self-control. If this was anyone else they would be getting snogged senseless right about now. Harry was different. Draco wanted to listen to what he had to say, rather than just get fucked and be done with him. His voice held a superior tone to it that made people listen, the way his eyes were staring straight into Draco’s made his heart stop. Even in the darkness he could see the green flashing.
Potter knelt down in front of her, touching her tiny shoulder, “How much spare food do you have?”
Potter’s hand faltered, “Really?”
“Hey, hey, I’m not going to hurt you. Actually,” He looked back up to Potter, giving him a look, “Um, Pot- Harry will tell you what we want,” He said quickly. Standing back up and avoiding the wide eyes of the house elf.
The moon had moved across the sky, the beam of light leaving the bed and hiding the actions of the room's occupants. Maybe Draco liked the moon, it brought sleepless nights, but it also gave him Harry, which seemed like a good compromise.
“I’m his boyfriend and I was just coming over here to get him, but obviously there is something wrong.” Draco glared at the woman, moving over to Harry.
“Yeah, alright then.” He stepped into the cold winter air, wrapping his arms around himself and pulling his scarf on tighter. Draco walked around the front of the car and greeted Harry, grabbing his hand and squeezing. They walked in, avoiding the ice that was on the ground and shaking themselves warm once inside the shop. Draco already went to grab a trolley but Harry made him stop,
The walls were bare on his side, he had no time for posters or creepy paintings. The one thing he wanted was a bookshelf, but the school wouldn’t allow it. He figured it could have been due to his ‘dark past’ as they called it. What did they think he was gonna do? Brew illegal potions in the middle of the night to poison everyone in school?
“Who are
Draco’s eyes widened, he was definitely not expecting that. If anything, the compliment caused a swarm of butterflies to come to life in his stomach. The second time that night. Harry was silent, staring at the way Draco’s eyes flitted all over the room, anywhere but his own.
“I just couldn’t.” Draco mocked. He too was sitting up in bed, legs crossed under the sheets. Potter was staring at his duvet, picking at the red fabric. Draco studied him. The way his shoulders curved forward with exhaustion, his calloused hands pulling on threads, his dark curly hair falling forward on his face.
“I know it’s not going anywhere but can we please be fast today, you know how every time we go to a supermarket things go wrong.” He finished with a roll of his eyes and a flourish of his hand.
Butterflies erupted in Draco’s stomach. He glanced down at his abdomen, wondering what the hell was happening. Why did he feel excited? Suely Potter winking at him wasn’t the cause, it was Potter! He shook his head and cleared his throat,
“No presents for you then. I guess the special one I had planned for tonight isn’t going to happen. Sorry love.” He shrugged, watching Harry’s face drop. He knew exactly what ‘present’ Draco was talking about.
Harry put his hand to his forehead, watching Draco stroll around the room aimlessly with his dopey smile back in place. He shook his head and picked up the cardboard box that Draco had gotten the chocolates out of. Next to the open box was a card from Ginny, a picture of her blowing heart shaped bubbles flew out and hit Harry in the face. He spluttered a bit before reading what was inside the card, in fancy scripture it read,
“We don’t need too much stuff today so a basket will do.” He indicated to the baskets and Draco quickly grabbed one, stuffing their bags inside it to free his hand. They held hands once again and walked through the first aisle.
They finally moved from their sitting position and fell onto Draco’s pillows, Draco landing underneath Harry. The kiss never broke between them. Harry’s fingers danced along Draco’s stomach, moving lower down to his crotch wanting desperately to remove the other boy's pants and really feel Draco.
“What in the bloody hell! What the fuck is that!” He screamed. Thank Merlin they had both cast silencing charms over the door or else the rest of the dormitory would have been woken by Draco’s yelling. That didn’t stop Aquila and James to be suddenly awoken by the noise, Aquila announcing it with one sharp yip.
It had fruit. That was it.
“Sorry ‘Quila, didn’t mean to wake you, it’s just Potter here decided to show off his talent for removing his lower limbs from his body!”
Nothing. Draco rolled his eyes and flopped back down onto his pillows, if Potter was going to be difficult then he’ll just deal with it.
“Look what I found!” He said triumphantly. Harry snorted and held the basket out for Draco to place his treasure in it.
The fingers stopped, “Why?”
“What? Is it a magical food dispensing cloak that brings you everything you need in a matter of seconds?”
Potter was in front, he stuck his head out and checked the hall both ways before grabbing Draco’s arm and pulling him out of the portrait hole. Draco frowned at the contact before feeling Potter drag him far too fast for 12 am down the hallway.
“What Potter?” He replied.
Potter tsked, before reaching forward, supposedly finding ‘the correct pear’ and giving it a scratch on the side of it. It did nothing for a while, Draco thought Potter was about to try another when a door appeared and opened right in front of them. Draco gaped, Potter laughed.
Returning his eyes to Pug Face she said, “Excuse me? I happen to be his girlfriend.”
“I’ll just enlarge it,” He shrugged again and pointed his wand at it.
Silence. Draco looked over at Potter and frowned. He couldn’t be asleep already.
Potter shrugged and took it off his shoulders, he held it out in front of him and pulled out his wand.
‘Draco! You need to close the fridge to keep things cold, you know?’
Draco put his head in his hands, “I know that, but seeing you here, in my bed, looking peaceful with me beside you, is strange. I needed to say something or else I wouldn’t be able to sleep. You shouldn’t have forgiven me,” he raised his head, “I’m a terrible person.”
“No Draco, I listened to your apology, you’re gonna listen to mine,” Draco froze, eyes moving from Harry’s hand to his eyes. He slowly sat back down on the bed folding his legs closely underneath him, “I didn’t know that spell did. I didn’t know that you would almost die, you have no idea how guilty I was after Snape sent me away. I thought you had died. Draco, I’m so sorry.”
“Pardon? I’ve never thought I’d hear you say that. Let alone anyone.”
‘You’ll catch your death of cold going out there like that! Put on a bloody coat first Potter’
The room in question was located high above school grounds, with a view encapsulating the Black Lake, Forbidden Forest, and if you squinted hard enough, you could see Hagrid’s hut sitting all alone with smoke rising from the chimney. His window had a cross hatching pattern, a corner of the glass cracking slightly due to old age. The room that they were in was actually not used until this year, it hadn’t been used for some time. Draco had taken the time to clean every surface when he first arrived, the dust was disgusting. A thick layer had coated everything so he had to do something about it, he was not going to live in an allergy inducing room.
“Draco, we’re gonna go find Ginny.” He grabbed onto his upper arm and pulled him up, watching Draco’s face change to one of ecstasy. Harry dragged him quickly through the common room, desperately trying to keep him from detaching himself from Harry and running off in search of Ginny. Thankfully, the pair didn’t need to walk too far as Professor Slughorn's office was in the dungeons. Harry dropped Draco’s arm and gave the heavy wooden door three sharp raps with his knuckles.
“I’m aware. I’m too tired to move to my bed.” Draco rolled his eyes but joined Potter on his bed, staying on the left side. Potter’s eyes were closed and his glasses were askew making Draco snort. The Boy-who-Lived looked exceptionally stupid.
“I’m in love with her! I can’t stop thinking about her, Harry.” He shouted, walking over to Harry’s bed and flopping down onto it. He was wearing his green silk pajama bottoms and an old quidditch shirt. Harry himself got a shock from the sudden movement and almost walked into the bedpost. This was definitely not what Harry expected, and he didn’t miss the way Draco had said ‘her’, so obviously he wasn’t going to confess his love.
“Draco! Draco can you hear me?!” He put his hand behind Draco’s head, trying to think of something. Draco hadn’t stopped seizing and Harry was becoming increasingly more worried. He racked his brain and suddenly remembered the bezoar that he had given Slughorn, standing up at lightning speed and rushing across the room, he scrambled around Slughorn’s stores and finally found the bezoar in a bottom draw. He ran back to Draco, once again dropping to his knees and opening up the blonds mouth. It was a struggle to actually get the bezoar into his mouth but once he got it in there, Draco stopped seizing as violently and his eyes slipped shut. Harry exhaled heavily,
Draco jumped and spun around, smiling dopily at Harry, “Harry! There you are! Listen I’m sorry about the chocolates but I just wanted to try one.” he said just as dopily as his smile. Harry’s eyes widened, he had never seen Draco act this way apart from the one time they had gotten drunk together. He stepped forward,
The pair walked holding hands, ignoring a look from an old woman, Harry squeezing Draco’s hand to stop him from yelling at her. They arrived at another aisle, where Harry let Draco walk down alone to grab some canned food, and animal food. They had a Siamese cat named Athena back home, and Draco only got the best food for her, which was fine since Harry loved seeing Draco look so pleased with himself when he found the best option for her. Harry himself walked down to the meat aisle, grabbing a few cuts of steak, and mince. He and Draco didn’t particularly enjoy meat, usually opting for pasta meals and salads but the occasional medium rare steak was a must in the house. He went down the tea and coffee aisle, which also had basic household stuff like dishwashing liquid and rubbish bags. He looked at the rows of tea boxes, he grabbed English Breakfast for himself and Earl Grey for Draco. They had coffee beans at home, Harry noted. He turned around and grabbed some bin bags and some more washing powder. He looked down the aisle a second time before leaving, going to the adjacent one. His basket was becoming full, maybe grabbing a trolley was a good idea.
Harry placed the snowglobes back down, “Yeah, very obvious.” he muttered. Draco scowled at him and snatched up one of the snowglobes, wrapping it expertly and safely to make sure the glass wouldn’t shatter. Harry wrapped James’ one and placed it next to Draco’s in the basket. Draco chanced a look into the basket and saw the tremendous difference in their two gifts, but he couldn’t change it now as it would only mean Harry was correct.
Draco was extraordinarily confused. The git pulling him along had said nothing of where they were going the whole time, and he still hadn’t let go of Draco’s wrist. He furrowed his brows, surely he would know if the kitchens were down here, he bloody well lived here for six years.
“Potter, don’t tell me you’re asleep. My levitation charms aren’t the strongest so you might land on the floor halfway to your bed.”
Harry almost jumped across the bed and tackled her, even Snape looked ready to murder, “He’s been poisoned you daft dimbo! Who do you think you are thinking you’re the only object of Draco’s attention?”
The house elf giggled, whispered something into Potter’s ear and scampered off. She disappeared behind an oven and returned with a floating tray of food, ranging from treacle tart (of course) to left over roast beef from dinner. For the second time that night, Draco’s jaw dropped as he watched Potter nod at her and the food disappeared with a snap of her fingers.
“Yeah, we should go save the cats she was talking about. I don’t want them to be around that bitch.” Harry laughed now, leaning forward and planting a soft kiss on Draco’s lips. Draco melted and grabbed Harry’s face softly, all thoughts forgotten.
Draco raised a delicate eyebrow, it sure didn’t look like nothing.
“Potter! Slow the fuck down,” He hissed. Potter dropped his arm and whipped around,
However, eighth years were allowed to bring pets to school as consolidation for any ‘losses’ two years earlier. Draco had opted for an owl, but instead he bought a small golden Crup. It had a bed, water and food bowl, and a litter of toys in the corner of his room. He had named her Aquila, after his Mother insisted on keeping the tradition of astrological names in the family. She was a well trained thing, fit to live in Hogwarts, and Draco loved her. She was sleeping peacefully in her bed, snoring slightly.
“Who cares what the old woman said, like you said, she’s close to death so the world will be rid of her soon enough.” He joked. Draco snickered, meeting Harry’s eyes,
“Thank god for that bezoar.” He whispered. He patted Draco’s chest once and dropped his head.
Ron and Hermione stood, allowing Harry to grab Draco’s pale hand tightly in his own. He could feel their amused gazes on him, “Oh shut up you two, don’t you have some snogging of your own to do?” He teased. Hermione gasped and turned red while Ron just ducked his head down.
Harry smiled and quickly snatched Draco’s hand and pulled him inside. He brought him into the centre of the room and focused Draco’s attention on the crackling fire. Slughorn was just closing the door when Harry turned around,
Green eyes opened, locking onto grey, “Yeah?”
Once outside, he knocked Draco’s shoulder, “What’s up? You’ve gone all quiet love.”
Nothing happened for a few moments but suddenly the mail slot opened quickly and Slughorn's large eyes were peering back at Harry, squinting at him in the dark, “Is that you Potter?” His voice echoed out.
Harry shook his head, “Don’t worry about it Draco, you can thank Professor Slughorn.”
“Draco? Are you alright?”
The room fell back into silence, Draco was sick of it.
Draco paused and looked off, “No, do you think Ron could get her attention for me?”
Harry was still silent, now picking at Draco’s sheets. Draco continued the silence until a burning question entered his brain,
“I’m sorry.”
“Would you two like something?” She-Draco figured- asked. She took notice of his complexion and she blanched when she realised who she was talking to, she whimpered a little before Draco knelt down,
Draco’s eyes widened and he shook his head frantically. He felt a small tug at his sleeve and he looked down to see a small looking house elf, wringing its hands together,
“What if it breaks the charms that make it invisible?”
“It was my Dad’s. I got it for Christmas in first year.” He said with a fond voice. Draco nodded. Aquila had made her way over to him, now fully awake, he bent down to give her snout a scratch.
Harry entered the Slytherin common room, flicking his eyes over the people inside. Draco wasn’t in there, there was barely anyone in there. Harry continued to the sixth year boys dorm and opened the door slowly. He found Draco sitting towards a window with a pillow on his stomach. There were wrappings all along the floor and an empty box of what looked like chocolates on Harry’s bed. Harry frowned, normally he would have noticed when Harry walked in the room,
Draco’s eyes had to adjust to the light but before long he could take in the room before him. It was packed with stoves, benches, pots, pans, utensils and all types of food Draco could imagine. It smelt strongly of cinnamon, bread and citrus. What surprised Draco was the amount of elves running around, there were probably at least 100 house elves tending to pots full of sugary substances, and ovens baking the famous treacle tart that Potter loved so much. It was magnificent.
“Don’t be silly young man, I have already forgiven you. . . and this antidote is almost ready. Just a few more stirs and it should be done.” Harry nodded. He watched for a few moments before hearing a loud bang from where Draco had been. Worried for what the hell Draco was doing he spun around with his wand out, only to see that the spot that had been occupied by his friend was empty, until he saw Draco’s blond hair bob up and down behind the couch. He blew out a breath, looked at Slughorn exasperated, and went over to help Draco up again, bringing him closer to Slughorn who had the antidote in his hands.
Harry chuckled, “Good, you’re you again.” He patted Draco’s shoulder, causing Draco’s frown to deepen,
There had been one issue, it didn’t seem like much of a problem when he first read it in the letter. But as he got closer to September 1st, he kept thinking about who his roommate would be. What unlucky sod would have to spend their nights in the same room as Ex-Death Eater Draco Malfoy.
They finally pulled into the carpark of the shop, Draco instantly removing his seatbelt and getting ready to move. Harry put his hand up, “Woah, woah slow down. The shop isn’t going anywhere.” He reached behind to grab their reusable bags but they were gone. He flipped back into his seat and saw Draco clutching the bags to his chest,
“Where
“I’m sure they’re asleep Draco, we tuckered them out with that Quidditch game,” He said earnestly. Noticing Draco’s anxious eyes stare through the kitchen door, he flicked his hand and the door closed and he cast a silencing charm on the door, “There, now they can’t even hear us so they won’t come down here if they do wake up.”
So, just his luck, Harry Potter was paired with him. The bloody saviour, the boy he had bullied and made fun of for seven years, was going to be sharing a room with him. There had been outrage once they both found out, the two glaring at each other from across the crowd. Potter complained to McGonagall the first chance he got, saying,
“Okay creep, we’ll go get food.”
“H-Harry. Thank you, but I don’t know how I’m supposed to take that any other way than the ‘the wrong way’ so what was the correct way to take that?”
“How are you feeling?”
“You spoke first dumbass.” He commented. Potter lifted his own head and glared. Draco could barely see his face in the dark, “Why are you awake anyway?”
“Malfoy?”
Draco laughed loud, tossing his head back. He couldn’t believe what had just happened. Him and Potter had eaten almost all of the food the house elf had given them. They had eaten on the floor on Draco’s rug, Draco making sure Potter spilled nothing on the fabric every ten minutes.
Draco rolled his eyes and dropped his hand holding his head up, “Merlin Harry, she said she didn’t want the cat food because I had contaminated it. Harry what do you think that means?”
Draco shrugged, “I don’t know. Just because you know I’m gay and you just said I was beautiful, I needed a bit of clarification.”
Dumbledore spoke first, “Oh to be young, and to feel love’s keen sting. Well, come away everybody, Mr Malfoy is well tended.” The Professors left, Snape sweeping away with one last look at Harry.
Harry nodded to her, “I’m alright thanks.” He said, unpacking the food. Draco put the cat food on the conveyor belt silently, picking at the magazines under the register. He packaged their groceries into their bags quickly but neatly. Harry watched him with a frown, helping him pack the last of them into the bag. He paid for the groceries and said goodbye to the cashier, grabbing Draco’s hand and the other bag.
Turning back into the canned food aisle, he saw Draco at the opposite end with cat food in his hands, clutching it to his chest and scowling evilly at the same old lady that had given them a look earlier. Harry rolled his eyes and walked to the pair, hearing their conversation clearly now.
“Harry. . .” Draco mumbled quietly, “Harry.” He said again. Pansy’s eyes widened and she glared evilly at Harry before running off trying to stifle her sobs. Harry watched her almost crash right into Snape and then disappear into the corridor. Ron chuckled slightly and even Hermione let out a laugh.
Draco snapped his mouth shut, mimicking zipping his lips closed. Potter rolled his eyes and grabbed his wrist again, pulling him down the multiple flights of stairs. They forgot to bring their wands so it was almost pitch black in the halls if it weren't for the moonlight. It was almost scary, walking down a dark hallway not knowing if you were about to run into Filch or a patrolling teacher.
Harry lifted his head, but his fingers continued the monotonous task of picking at his sheets, “No, I’m bisexual. Obviously, I dated Ginny, Malfoy.” He quipped. Draco glared at him halfheartedly,
Draco looked back at Harry and smiled, “I forget sometimes that you can do that so easily. It’s very attractive.” He said, a blush rising on his cheeks. Harry chuckled,
Draco paused and frowned at him, “I could never get tired of her, Harry. I love her.” he joined Harry on his bed, sitting extremely close with his dopey smile still glued on his face. Harry leant back, almost falling off his bed.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “What exactly are
Potter glared at him openly now, but he seemed to be concealing a smile. He remained silent until he sprung up from his bed and rummaged through his trunk. Draco watched with a cautious expression, was he searching for a weapon? What if he had pushed it too far and Potter was finally going to finish him off. What he wasn’t expecting was him to pull out a manky looking piece of cloth and hold it up in triumph.
“Yes it’s all very well and Potter’s actions were certainly heroic but the question is, why were these actions necessary?” Professor McGonagall said sharply. Dumbledore walked over to Professor Slughorn, taking the bottle out of his hands and sniffing it. Harry watched him, wondering if he could smell the same thing that Harry could smell earlier that night. He looked back at Draco, where Hermione was fixing his fringe. He walked back over to Draco and sat down in his earlier seat, once again picking up his hand.
Harry nodded slowly, “Well it looks like you ate more than one.” he gestured to the floor.
“Here Mr Malfoy, this should fix you right up.”
“Can I see you scars?”
“Harry. I forgive you.”
“I’m always pale you git.”
Harry despised her. The dark haired bimbo followed Draco around everywhere like a lost puppy. She kissed him whenever Harry was around, obviously noticing Harry’s hatred towards her. It also interrupted many of their meetings with Hermione and Ron as Draco was always dragged off to snog Pansy in a broom cupboard somewhere with Pansy shouting out the most irritating nickname in history, ‘Dray! There you are! C’mon Dray, there’s something I want to show you’. On top of that, Harry also had the feeling that Theodore Nott was a death eater, and his will to do the right thing was always on overdrive as he was getting nowhere with his progress. He was watching Nott on the Marauder's Map so much it made his eyes hurt, but no clear evidence was pointing to him being a death eater and it made Harry crazy. The stress of school, Pansy, Nott and bloody Professor Slughorn was enough to make Harry feel like he was drowning.
“Well I guess we’ll just have to be sneaky.” He said with a waggle of his eyebrows. Draco rolled his eyes and deposited Aquila on his bed, where the Crup waddled up to his pillows and snuggled down into them. He smiled fondly at her before turning back to Potter, who was staring at him with gleaming eyes,
“Um, alright. What is it?” His heart sped up. What if this was it? What if Draco had broken up with Pansy and was going to confess his love to him?
“Oh really?” He stood, forgetting his tea and met Draco on the opposite side of the island. He grabbed Draco’s hips and kissed him slowly, inhaling the scent of his lover. Draco savoured this until he pushed him away, giving Harry a stern look,
Draco rolled his eyes, “Yes, so they match our children. The one on the broomstick is for James, the hippogriff is for Lily and the two children having a snowball fight is for Scorpius. Honestly, Harry it’s pretty obvious.”
He had one arm under one of Draco’s pillows, supporting his head. Even his arm was beautiful, it had small freckles on it, creating a constellation down his arm.
He chanced a look at Harry, “Sorry,” sounding not remotely sorry, “It’s not my fault that I can’t work muggle technology.” There it is, the arrogance that arose whenever Draco was bested by an everyday object. Like the fridge back at home.
He held his breath when the slot slammed shut. Surely Slughorn would help his two best students, right? Harry was about to turn back around when the door opened fully, revealing Professor Slughorn and his office behind him, “Well come in then.” He grumbled.
Harry’s heart jolted, “I happen to be his. . . friend.” he choked on the last word. Ron had hit his arm to stop him from saying something stupid and he could tell that Hermione was desperately trying to get him to shut up.
Potter finally dropped his hand, Draco almost missed the warmth, “No, I’m not here to hex you. I thought we sorted that out months ago. The kitchens
Oh how Draco had laughed that day. Potter was muttering the whole way to their new common room, exchanging hopeless glances with Weasley and Granger. His face had turned red from anger and his hands were curled into fists the entire way.
Draco stretched to grab his wand, he cast a
Draco nodded. He definitely had scars. They were scattered across his chest, running down from his pectorals down to his torso. He had scars across his collarbones, circling the area where his heart lay. He had a thin one on his neck that ran across his Adam’s Apple and stopped just near his left shoulder. The scars were mostly on the left side of his body, that was where the spell had hit him. He had one scar running down his jaw and one short scar across his nose.
“I would be more careful if I were you, Potter,” he says, choosing his words carefully to match the pain Potter has just caused him. “Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.”
“Dobby, shh, I’m sorry,” he says quickly. “I didn’t mean to offend you or anything.”
"Yes. From what Harry's said, his detention was supposed to be eight o'clock tonight, scrubbing cauldrons. Well, from what I remember, about two weeks ago you had detention for no reason, with Snape, scrubbing cauldrons. So clearly, Harry traveled to the past and got in trouble, and he's already served his detention for it. It's just that he saw Snape two weeks ago instead of last night."
“It’s happened before, I just forgot about it,” Harry explains dismissively. “The Dursley’s never liked it when I traveled like that but that’s not entirely surprising given their opinion of magic in general.”
“We both know he’s not really old,” she said instead, deliberately casual.
Once the crowds have died down he decides to head up to his dormitory to write this all down in his journal before he heads to Herbology, where Ron and Hermione have hopefully taken his things. It was a pretty boring trip, but he thinks the professor or the student, Tom, are important somehow. Or what he did for the school. Does it have something to do with the Philosopher's Stone? Or a dark wizard?
“You said we were friends,” he says, and tries to keep his voice from cracking. “But we’re not, we’re
“Yes,” Harry says, pulling them into an empty classroom. “He said he made something called the Philosopher’s Stone, which is some kind of alchemy thing. It can change any metal into gold, and makes some sort of potion to give you eternal life.”
Harry cleared his throat. "Of course not. Well." He slapped his knees and stood up. He still stood up a bit like he had when he was old, as if his knees didn't want to bend. "I should be off to work then. See you for tea."
This makes Draco scared, although he tries not to show it.
“Do what?” Harry asks.
“Harry are you alright? What happened? Where have you been? Oh, I need to tell Ron-” Hermione starts to move towards the boys dormitories before turning back and giving Harry a tight hug. He's so surprised he barely manages to raise his arms before she's let go and started to pack up her things. "We need to have a private discussion upstairs, our homework can wait."
"Ever since then, the Ministry has banned time travel further than five hours in the past, and not at all in the future, obviously."
“What do you mean she won’t wake?” he asks when he finally parses Tom’s words. “She’s not--”
"Arthur, can you act like an adult? Actually, can all of you act like adults?"
Draco held out his hand, expecting for the average boy to take it-- he didn't. Instead he glared up at Draco, "I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," the average boy said coolly. Draco's smirk disappeared as he felt his face heat up.
There was a silence.
"Wiltshire."
Draco was lost in his thoughts as he fed both Estella and himself the banana. It was when the two were half-way through the fruit, that Draco heard it— another muggle monster contraption coming his way. Draco grabbed Estella and held her close to his chest as the creature slowed down to a stop in front of the pair.
"You mean you don't remember?" The dark-skinned girl guessed.
There was a loud crack. The fair-haired boy turned his head in the direction of the sound. A house-elf clad in filthy rags stood in place, looking over at Draco expectantly. "Mistress Narcissa wishes for you to change into nice robes and to come downstairs. You're going to Diagon Alley today, young Master Draco," the house-elf informed him. Draco nodded before waving his hand at the house-elf, dismissively.
"That's not what I-" Black stopped himself mid-sentence and took a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself down. "Let me rephrase the question for you, little snake.
Draco recognized the last name-- her family was part of the
"Just repeat after me. Breathe in... breathe out," Trelawney inhaled and exhaled loudly, watching as the young aristocrat struggled to keep up with her. After a few minutes, Draco's breathing finally evened out and Trelawney stepped away from the child.
LOL it has been a while LOLOLOL. To make all of you feel better though, I tried writing this chapter like five times but I kept on deleting everything I wrote because I'm annoyingly picky. I didn't forget about this story!!!! I promise ;)
“Obviously,” Black said. The Gryffindor then raised his eyebrows at the blond. “Are you going to stand in the hallway all day or are you going to enter?”
on his future resume). A few days after disclosing this information to his potions professor, Snape gave Draco a slip of paper with ink that was charmed to only be seen by the teen and him alone. The paper read "12 Grimmauld Place, Borough of Islington, London. Muggle area. Travel by muggle means. Don't use magic until you arrive— your wand will be tracked." When Draco looked up from the slip and opened his mouth to question it, Snape shushed him and simply told Draco to trust him. And trust him, Draco did. That very night, Draco hastily packed his and Estella's things and fled from the Manor, leaving a single note for his mother explaining why he left; including the perverted comments and excluding the person who helped him leave.
Draco's entire body was shaking now. Tears streamed down his face as he heard himself answer again against his will, "The Dark Lord desired me," Draco started, causing everyone at the table to visibly react with widened eyes and audible gasps. "Sexually. He-" Draco covered his mouth with his hands to stop himself from talking.
This had been the moment Draco had been waiting for for so long.
“Estella,” Malfoy groaned as more food spilled out of her mouth. “Keep your mouth closed when you eat!”
"They probably do now."
“But why would someone like Malfoy seek asylum?” Ginny asked.
"What is your name?"
"Albino?! Why does everyone keep saying I'm albino?"
The dark-skinned man placed his elbows on the table and leaned forward. "You must've gotten help or else you wouldn't have found this place, Malfoy. Who helped you?"
long time."
Harry shook his head. "No. I remember... It's just that-" Harry stopped himself mid-sentence and then started again, "Okay, for some reason, I dreamt of Malfoy's parents."
"This is the worst day of my life, Pansy."
"Don't call me that!"
The blond glanced out his window and eyed the scenery that passed by him before turning back to Pansy. The girl was beaming with excitement.
Leaving the Manor wasn't entirely Draco's idea, though. The blonde had been playing with the idea of escaping for the entirety of July, however, the plan didn't actually come to fruition until Professor Snape got involved. During one of Snape's many visits, Draco let it slip that the Dark Lord had debauched plans for the boy and would constantly make perverted remarks about him. Snape's reaction would've been hilarious if not for the context; Draco had never seen the greasy man's face move in such an expressive manner before ("He said
“HE'S STAYING HERE?!”
Malfoy gave the girl an incredulous look, “I most definitely am

"No," Draco said with a shake of his head.
"Molly, I'm so sorry," the purple haired Auror said, her voice shaking with poorly restrained laughter. "But
Draco thought as he peered down at the glass again.
"-another young man being fitted up just now, in fact."
“Oh dear,” Hermione muttered quietly as she avoided looking at Harry. “What have I done?”
McGonagall nodded before returning the slip back to the Auror, "This is Albus' doing."
what you're concerned about?”
"It's Dumbledore, isn't it?"
It has been a LONG time since I last updated RIP. I haven't looked at my ao3 account in YEARS and I'm so shocked by how many kudos this story got! 300+ kudos with only three chapters??? THANK YOU GUYS OMG
"What?"
Draco looked up at her with a frown, "Bulstrode?" (Bulstrode... as in Violetta Black née Bulstrode... as in...?)
"Can you imagine?" The male Weasley laughed, wiping tears from his eyes. His wife smacked him and gave her husband a frown.
“Exactly!” Harry bellowed. “Why would Dumbledore let
The aristocrat stared at the twins before letting out a loud laugh, startling everyone at the table, excluding the baby on his lap. The toddler smacked Malfoy's arm and babbled, causing Malfoy to return to his feeding duty. “Merlin's saggy tits,” Malfoy said in a breathy voice as he shoved another spoonful of food into the girl's mouth. “That's the funniest thing I've heard in a while.”
"But nothing!"
"Lemon drops?" The purple haired Auror joked, causing multiple people to chuckle in response.
The Secret Keeper?!
"About how I found you?" Draco stared at the frizzy haired woman again, but this time in concern.
"Would've made things a hell of a lot simpler if his croaking old arse was here," Black muttered in annoyance.
"You've heard my voice before," the mysterious woman stated simply. Draco, still shaken from his fit earlier, felt incapable of responding audibly. Instead, he nodded in response whilst glancing around the room in search of the voice's owner. There was no one there besides himself and the Divination's professor. "Sybill... bring him to the table. I want to see him."
Draco ignored the voices and continued questioning the other boy, "Play Quidditch at all?"
"We'd like a ride, if you'll have us!"
The boys all blinked as the strange woman began to walk away. "Wait, what?" Draco exclaimed in confusion. Trelawney ignored Draco and kept walking, leaving the four Ravenclaws staring at her back.
. Before the Slytherin could stop himself, he began to blurt out even more, "I don't know what I'm doing. I've just been copying what I've seen mother doing and I can't even do that right."
"HOW THE FUCK DID
for you!"
"...Houses! Yeah, houses. Um, no one really knows until they get there, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been-- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" Draco said, his face flushed in embarrassment. The average boy eyed him before gazing out towards the front window. A small smile formed on the average boy's face but Draco ignored it, too invested with the strange voices he heard and the people he saw. His thoughts were soon interrupted by the average boy's voice.
bigger than Draco. She had broad shoulders and would probably tower over Draco if he were to stand up. Draco's thoughts were interrupted by the shorter girl's whining, "Pansy, you are coming with us right now! We need to talk," Daphne grabbed Pansy's arm and pulled the raven-hair girl out of her seat. "I have so much gossip to tell you about-"
The woman, Abra, as Draco now knew, raised her eyebrows at his answer. "Those are quite unique names. Your mother a fan of the stars?"
"If I can't help you two in that regard," the woman said before taking one hand off the wheel, grabbing a water bottle from the cup holder next to her, and handing it to Draco. "At least let me offer you two some water. You must be parched from your journey!"
Harry woke up with a start. The olive skinned boy had sweat dripping down the sides of his face and his chest was heaving aggressively. Harry's eyebrows furrowed as his head began to throb in pain; he clutched his head with his two hands and sat up in the bed. Before Harry could calm down, the door to the room swung open revealing a dark-skinned girl with frizzy dark curls bouncing with her every move— Hermione Granger, one of Harry's best friends.
"Hermione! You shouldn't call yourself that!" Harry tried to chastise the girl but couldn't stop laughing at her snipe towards the bratty Slytherin.
“Ron didn't,” Ginny deadpanned. Ron whipped his head towards the red-headed girl and gave her a vicious glare.
"Harry Potter, huh?" Greg wondered. "Do you think he'll be in Slytherin?"
-->the next chapter will start off with Draco being sorted and go from there. The plot will really start moving next chapter y'all! also I'm really busy this week because I have an animation camp so expect the next chapter in about two weeks
The three boys walked down the halls of the train-- following Daphne's instructions of going to the end of the train. As they walked down the hall, Draco noticed a bushy haired girl and a boy exit a compartment near the end of the train and begin walking towards him, Crabbe, and Goyle. The bushy haired girl seemed to noticed the three boys as well because she began to drag the boy with her as she swiftly walked towards the three purebloods. "Have any of you seen a toad?" the girl asked in a bossy tone. "Neville lost his," she pointed back at the shy boy standing behind her who was presently staring at the floor.
They've almost reached the house when Harry lets go of the man's hair and hugs his neck.
"Hermione," Harry states anxiously, "I traveled a lot further back than five hours."
"Are you in love yet?"
Hermione stops talking to them for the rest of the week, only asking if either of them have found anything on Nicolas Flamel. Ever since Hagrid told them Nicolas Flamel's name, they've been searching for mentions of him in every book they can find, but they haven't had any luck so far.
"Language," Harry says through his laughter, and then, "I can't wait to tell you both about this when I get back. This is the best trip I've ever been on."
"Harry?
"I just like fixing things," Harry told him a month into his business, after Teddy asked if he ever got bored doing the same projects all the time.
Increasingly, Draco finds himself doing anything he can to get Potter’s attention. When Potter is looking at him, Draco can see hints of the man he will become, and he feels a bit more normal. Potter’s dead parents are a cheap shot, but guaranteed to get a reaction, and to keep him thinking about Draco. The only thing that he absolutely won’t mention is the time travel. It would only invite questions, and he wants to put that period behind him. Harry won't visit him any longer, and Draco won't give him any reason to. He's done with time travel, done with Potter.
"Oh I'm sorry, should someone have sent a half giant to your home to knock down the door and tell you you're a wizard?"
“Actually, Mum,” Ron says. “Harry and I wanted to talk to you.”
- confirms who he is, and Draco introduces Vince and Greg by their last names before using his own full name. Maybe it will trigger a memory; Harry had visited Draco when they were toddlers, there’s a chance he still remembers although it’s fuzzy for Draco now.
“Draco?” Harry is kneeling next to his bed now, looking concerned.
Harry huffs. “Well this is my first time visiting you in my timeline. I guess all the other me’s who visited you were older than me-me.”
He quickly writes out a 'thank you' to Tom and goes off to find Ron and Hermione to tell them what he's found out and see what they can do about it.
“Now, there was something you wished to discuss with me?”
“Well, yes, but if that was Snape, they just moved it closer to him if he wants to try again. Which he obviously does.”
"Right," Harry says, squaring his shoulders.
"Eight."
“Last time you were going to tell me what happened in the last World Cup in your time.”
"Yeah, I'm still here.” He takes off the cloak. “It’s not working. I think we have to go visit Hagrid and ask him how he called the creature last time.”
“Y-yes? I’m sorry, could you please tell me where I am?”
“Hermione thinks you bloody disappeared, mate.”
He knows he did not live up to his father's expectations last year. Granger took top marks in their year, Potter refused his friendship and made the quidditch team while Draco wasn't even allowed to try out. Draco did lead the Slytherins in his year, but that was hardly impressive; he's ruled over most of them since they were babies.
So all in all, it was going fine. Until The Incident.
"Which is why I think it's not just apparation, regardless of the fact that apparation takes a long time to master and you'd need to have a destination in mind before you did it. Now if you'll excuse me."
“Nothing,” he says quickly, trying to hide his broom behind his back.
"Well yeah I think that would've been preferable, yeah."
Also, I'm attempting a mixture of Harry and Draco POVs in this chapter. I've tried to make it obvious by the first phrase whose POV it is.
"What d'you suppose they meant by that?"
"Master Lucius is asking for Master Draco in his study," the elf tells him.
"You're not six."
Behind him, Pansy made a face at Teddy. Ever since Harry's curse had lifted, Draco had become a complete sap. Teddy had seen them kissing in the upstairs hallway when he'd come back from visiting home early one day, but they didn't know he knew, and were still careful not to be too lovey-dovey in front of him.
"Unless you'd like to tell us, and save us the trouble," Harry adds hopefully. We must've been through hundreds of books and we can't find him anywhere. Just give us a hint. I know I've read his name somewhere."
"I didn't have the invisibility cloak yet. Maybe it knew that Quirrell would be suspicious or Snape would have to take care of me instead of following Quirrell?"
had been the one to open the Chamber of Secrets, put under a trance by Tom. Harry realises that Tom had framed Hagrid all along, it hadn't just been a mistake. And Tom, he's no longer the charming boy who talked to the garden snake, nor the one who was -or pretended to be- humble in accepting praise in saving the school. No, this Tom has a chilling laugh, and calls Ginny stupid, and has manipulated all of them, except apparently Dumbledore.
He wasn’t sure how long he screamed, but when he came back to himself later, he was in the bathtub, with Teddy dumping water over him and scrubbing slime from his skin. He was so exhausted he didn't even think to ask where the slime had come from.
“Still here, granddad?”
"It's not? I thought...when Hagrid came to tell me about magic, he said funny things happening to me were natural, just signs I had magic. I figured..."
are his parents. They look just as they did in the Mirror of Erised; his mum has long red hair, now pulled back in a ponytail, and his dad has the same messy hair Harry has, and they're holding hands. His mum's hair shines against the black robes she wears, and Harry can see the top of a t-shirt under his dad's robes. They look happy, despite this apparently being a war meeting.
“Do you want any help cleaning up?” he asks.
"But-"
"Right," Teddy said, slapping his knees and standing up in a parody of Harry and Draco. "You definitely haven't been picking up old man habits from Harry."
“Are you a ghost?"
When he finished he went downstairs, sure that it was time for his meeting. Wizard Dumbledore could judge him all he wanted; he'd be there because he said he would, and that would have to be enough.
“Yes I could have!” Draco says, to be contrary.
“What wouldn’t he want with that?” Ron counters. “All the gold you want, and eternal life…”
Hermione glares at him.
Malfoy snickers in the background as Harry’s jaw drops open. “But why? I didn’t do anything!”
Dobby doesn't appear.
Harry’s eyebrows raise. “Uncle Severus?”
"Harry. Harry Potter." Harry's eyes dart between the men, certain his name will garner a reaction, but it doesn't. He must be sometime before Voldemort's first defeat, then.
Harry had to scrub Pansy’s bricks again before Teddy went to Godric’s Hollow to get some pots of glaze, and then again a week later to get more glaze. Teddy stayed a suspiciously long time for fetching some supplies from one pottery shop, but Draco wasn’t going to call him out on it right now. His sleep schedule was nonexistent now while he went out looking for the best ingredients day and night, and it made him feel a little less guilty for not having the time to teach his apprentice properly.
"Not very long, I'd imagine. She felt the effects immediately and-" she hesitates, "she died within a day. Harry, when did you travel to?"
Harry bursts out laughing.
"What?"
Pansy snorted out a shower of sparks, remembering, as she’s sure Draco was, when Teddy fell ill last year and had to be coaxed into even eating plain toast. It’s funny how he could clearly remember things like that, but still hadn’t gotten used to not having his father’s financial backing. A loaf of bread for two potions, whose ingredients alone outprice the bread, and they have three mouths to feed instead of the usual two. She sighed.
“Nope. Can you tell me about your party? Who came over? What did you do? Was there cake?”
While Ron does that, he sorts through his socks for the ones with the most circular holes and practices tying his belt in various configurations, checking each one in the mirror to see how circular it looks.
In the library, they each grab two tomes and lay them out on a table in the back. Harry feels himself nodding off with fifteen minutes until lunch starts, when his skin starts doing the weird tight-loose thing. He quickly makes sure his wand is in his hand and stands up. He's not dealing with another 'falling out of his seat' trip if he can help it. Ron looks up, a question written on his face, but Harry just wordlessly taps Hermione on the shoulders to get her attention.
"No I- I love- I'm very much in love. I was in love long before we got married."
"I'm a
Draco’s dorm-mates seem to have no trouble sleeping, but he is still lying awake, missing the comfort of home and wondering how Potter could have rejected him. They are supposed to be friends, best friends. It’s something he’s looked forward to as he grew up, the time he’d meet Harry and be practically guaranteed a friend. They know things about each other, they play well together, Harry said they’re friends, but he just doesn’t understand what went wrong!
“What do you expect to find from clothes? I reckon the clue is Harry himself,” Ron says from his position on the ground, staring up at the ceiling.
"Good, good. I'm sure Dumbledore knows best. But you should know that you can always talk to me about this, or anything else, alright? It won’t go any further than me, or Mr. Weasley if you'll permit it.”
“She won’t wake,” a voice says from a dark corner.
“FRED!” Mrs. Weasley bellowed while Sirius, Ginny, and George cackled and the rest grimaced with Malfoy looking especially green.
"I'm not an emo!"
"No."
Draco confidentially strutted towards the stool. He (grudgingly) picked up the hat, sat on the stool, and placed the hat on his head. "Hmmm," the hat said into Draco's ear, "a Malfoy... I should put you in Slytherin..." The blond smirked, "but there's so much more than that... I see it," Draco's smirk fell immediately after that statement. Draco frowned as the hat continued, "you possess a lot of knowledge... quite a lot of it actually. How interesting... your curiosity does not seem to cease itself, now does it? I see it now-- you must be... RAVENCLAW!"
"No, little one," the mysterious woman answered. "The crystal ball isn't charmed. Rather, only a select few can communicate like this through the medium of a crystal ball. Those being ones cursed with advanced sight."
"Oh yes, father, I know," Draco returned, morphing his face to display an innocent look. "I just wish to... browse. That's all."
I’m sorry about not updating! I was busy with university, jobs, etc. and of course I wasn't very motivated to write. However, because of this coronavirus situation, I have more time to write!
Weasley snapped out of her reverie and turned towards Draco with a small smile on her face. "You're only fifteen, dear. I would be surprised if you knew the ins and outs of child care!" The woman laughed. "Actually, I would be worried if you
Hermione gave Harry an apologetic look. Harry let out a loud groan, “Oh Gods, not this again!”
(See the end of the chapter for
"When did you two even get here?" - Ginny
Draco forgot about his hunger pains and stared in horror at the sleeping girl in his arms. The blond observed his surroundings and saw that the never ending road was still vacant besides him and his sister. He stopped walking, sat down on the grass next to the pavement, and put Estella down on the grass in front of him. "Estella," Draco said, gently poking her round cheeks. "Estella, wake up," the baby made a noise before slowly opening her eyes. Draco stared into the girl's silver eyes and internally prayed that she wouldn't throw a fit. Thankfully, the toddler remained calm and babbled a few words in baby talk while reaching her arms out to her older brother. "Ba ba ba to you too," Draco murmured with a small smile on his face. The Slytherin placed the dark green backpack in front of him and peered inside. The bag was packed in haste and the interior looked like it; baby clothes and diapers were littered across the bag with no sense of organization. The bag was mainly filled with supplies for Estella, meanwhile Draco only packed an extra pair of undergarments, his favorite potions book, and a dragon plushie from his childhood. The blonde had a feeling that he wasn't going to return home in a very long time and packed accordingly... which meant packing a stuffed animal. Draco would never admit this to anyone but his dragon plushie, Fafnir, meant too much to him and he didn't have it in him to abandon the orange creature in the darkness of the Manor.
“Sorry,” Malfoy said, not sounding sorry at all. “To answer your question, she's not
"This subject matter has been spoken of too many times, Lucius. He is going to Hogwarts," Narcissa concluded, frowning at her husband. "And that's final."
Whatever these 'jitters' were... Draco just hoped that they would go away quickly.
On the second day of school, Draco received a letter from his parents regarding his house. The letter wasn't too feisty but the content still hinted at disappointment, at least if "Draco, I expected you to flourish in Slytherin but I suppose you can perform okay enough in Ravenclaw" was enough to go by. The classes were interesting but the work load was obnoxious (Professor McGonagall had already assigned them a paper!) and the only classes Draco thought he would genuinely enjoy--Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts-- turned out to be jokes (Potions was only a joke because he shared the class with dimwitted Hufflepuffs. Defense Against the Dark Arts, on the other hand, was a completely different story). By the end of the first week, Draco was exhausted and already missed his stress-free life back at the Manor.
Draco hesitated before answering, "Professor Snape," this answer caused Black and the werewolf to exchange a meaningful look over the male Auror's head, though what the look meant, the teenage aristocrat couldn't tell. Draco gulped before continuing, "I confided in him about... things that were worrying me and he told me to trust him and then handed me a note with this address on it."
“No way,” Ginny exclaimed. “Malfoy is a virgin. I can smell it!”
The boy next to Draco, now known as Michael, scoffed, "You know, for a bloke who was really excited to be my friend on the train earlier, you were pretty quick to betray me for little albino over here."
also prepare for more Millicent and Draco friendship because I really enjoyed writing their interactions omg
"I'm Professor Trelawney, the professor of Divination," she responded in a dreamy voice. The boys nodded in greeting. Trelawney nodded back before looking at Draco again. The blond stared back uncomfortably. The other three boys stared at the two in confusion.
ALSO: Should I draw fanart for this fic? Would y'all like that? I'm considering using scenes from this fic to help me practice drawing anatomy LOL! What scenes do you want me to draw? I'm already considering the opening scene of Draco and Estella walking with Draco looking exhausted as fuck lol.
"Thank you..." Draco's thanks trailed off as he realized he never got the woman's name.
Pansy was right. Their class
"Was there supposed to be an Order meeting today?" Harry asked the others.
"I understand why you did it," Draco responded quietly. The blonde really
The woman seemed to realize the teen's issue and answered the boy's unasked question. "My name is Abra. And you and your sister?"
“Pansy Parkinson.”
Did this average boy just
Malfoy gave Sirius a withering glare, “I was tired.”
“Sorry, Mrs. Weasley!”
"But Mione! He has a baby!"
All of the voices were interrupted by a loud wail. Draco let out a shaky sigh as he held the frightened girl close to his chest and a rubbed a soothing hand down her back. Draco began shushing into the toddler's ear just like his mother did when Estella threw crying fits back at the Manor... but it didn't work. The blonde could feel the stares on him as he attempted to calm Estella down to no avail. She kept sobbing loudly and Draco didn't know what to do.
"Yeah, I can tell," the other boy agreed. Draco took a deep breathe, trying to remember what they were talking about earlier.
Ginny nodded, “He's at least bi. There's no way that boy is straight!”
Harry looked at the red-head with wide eyes, “
Draco awoke with a start. The fair-haired boy let out a breathe he seemed to be holding and sat up slowly. He blinked once-- he blinked a few times. He looked around. He was in his room... in the Malfoy Manor. Not the other room. What
Ron turned bright red and spluttered. Fred and George let out loud laughs, while Hermione looked at Ron in disappointment. “You walked into that one, baby brother,” Fred exclaimed. The tall redhead turn towards Hermione with a smug smile, “even Hermione thinks so!”
Draco gave the fugitive a look of pure bafflement. "You asked me how I found this building-"
Although Draco hadn't had one of his visions since the Summer, the young aristocrat couldn't stop thinking about them. Draco didn't know how, but he knew that the apparitions he saw were more than just vivid daydreams; Draco felt as though he was there with the people in his dreams... they felt too real. And Trelawney's statement about his eyes being like her's -- a
The Gryffindors all begrudgingly nodded just as Mrs. Weasley bust through the door with floating dishes surrounding her. As Mrs. Weasley set up the table, Sirius entered the dining room with Malfoy right behind him holding a babbling baby.
"Say that again," Weasley said, his face as red as his hair.
“Whoa,” Ginny looked at the little girl with a small smile, “No wonder she's so tiny!”
"I'll come back later," She said as Daphne and Millicent dragged her out of the compartment. Once they were gone, Gregory reached over and shut the door. The brunette sighed before glancing at Draco.
"Isn't that what you usually do?" Ginny asked, her tone that of feign innocence. Ron gave Ginny the middle finger with one of his hands and Ginny gave him two middle fingers back.
"My sweet summer child," the woman said with a sad smile on her face. "I wish I could lie to you and keep your talents hidden from you forever but I simply cannot," the wrinkled woman frowned. "My name is Cassandra Vablatsky. I have been waiting to meet you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, for a very
"How was your summer?" Draco asked Blaise. The black boy shrugged, his smirk still in place.
The towheaded boy searched the train; his eyes squinted and his lips pouted as he attempted to catch sight of his pureblood friends. His search was cut short when he heard a girl's voice screech behind him, "Draco!" the blond turned around to see a raven-haired girl clad in black robes. She was small-- a dainty girl. Her hair was up to her chin, bangs cut neatly, straight across her forehead. Her hazel eyes were wide in excitement. The girl wore a large grin on her face as she waved frantically at Draco. "Come over here, Draco!"
"Sorry," the girl, Millicent, said-- although she did not sound sorry at all. The big girl smirked at Draco who was still grimacing in embarrassment. "I'm Millicent Bulstrode."
Everyone turned towards Ginny with surprised looks on their faces. “What? Why?” Ron asked.
Vincent's face flushed in embarrassment. Before he could respond, the compartment door flew open revealing two young girls. The shorter girl let out a breath of relief, looking towards Pansy and ignoring the boys. "Pans! Millie and I have been searching
I didn't say who said what in the chapter because I wanted to make the scene seem super chaotic LOL! This is technically Draco's POV so he didn't really give a shit who was talking. He was just dreading Estella's fit :(
Draco shivered as he heard himself answer against his will, "Yes."
Once the Malfoy family arrived at one of the entrances to the Hogwarts Express, they stopped and looked at each other. Lucius grimaced the moment he laid his eyes on his smiling child. "Draco, wipe that smile off your face. You look like a simpering fool," Draco's smile disappeared immediately. He looked up at his father with a frown.
Time had gone by as the five boys continued talking. Presently, the boys were munching on the candy they had purchased from the food trolley. Draco silently ate his Cauldron Cake while the other boys talked about... well... Draco didn't actually know. The blond boy was too busy thinking about Harry Potter (and about the dreams he had even though he tried his hardest to not think of them) to listen to the other boys' conversation. After spending almost twenty minutes pondering Harry Potter's relation to the Harry in his dream, Draco had made a decision.
Draco studied the crystal ball in confusion. The woman in the crystal ball responded to Draco as though she could hear him. Draco had limited knowledge on divination but he did know a few things. One of which being that crystal balls were only used to see prophecies, not to communicate with others. "Is this charmed?" The first year asked, unsure of who his question was directed towards, Trelawney or the woman in the sphere. Trelawney, who was now sitting in the chair to the left of Draco, sat silently as she watched the exchange, awaiting the other woman to answer the boy's question.
Pansy gasped. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Is there any other reason that you haven't told us?"
That statement caught Draco's attention. "How? Aren't I being kicked out?"
?" Snape exclaimed, horrified. Draco timidly summarized the words the Dark Lord said to him during their last meeting— that the Dark Lord for all intents and purposes wanted to fuck him. Snape's usually grey-toned face morphed into a sickly green. His reaction was alarming, to say the least. But at least Draco knew that one male adult figure in his life had his head screwed on straight. When the teenager confided in his father about the same issue, his father was elated and said that this was a 'fantastic opportunity' for Draco.
"Oh my god," Michael grumbled, gaining the attention from the other boys. "What is this? Shakespeare?"
Draco hated the moon. Maybe not as much as Professor Lupin but enough to make him want to tear his hair out. The moon was a symbol of light and peace to some, to Draco it was a reminder that no matter how hard he tried, sleep would never come to him and it’s white light filled his eyes, laughing at his weakness. It told him that he would never be able to escape his past, the haunting moments that lived with him through every waking hour.
Harry looked at Draco, wishing that this human was his. He looked peaceful like this and Harry was resisting kissing him. He stayed that way for a few more minutes before he heard the large doors of the infirmary open and several pairs of feet enter the room. He lifted his head,
To which Professor McGonagall replied with,
Draco wished he had the ability to sleep like a Crup. Aquila could sleep anywhere she felt, no questions asked. Draco’s lap, in front of the common room fire, on his bed, anywhere she felt like it. Draco often made the comparison to Ron, that boy could fall asleep literally anywhere.
Harry paused. He had an idea but he really didn’t want it to be true, “Oh. Draco, I’m sorry love, I didn’t realise.” He reached across and took Draco’s hand. The blond had always been sensitive around people being homophobic especially after their dinner two years ago with Draco’s parents. Lucius had been reluctant to have the two over, not wanting to see his son be with another man, but Narcissa had insisted and they had come over on a Saturday night for a dinner at Malfoy Manor.
Draco hesitated. Potter’s hand urged him on and he grabbed it with a slap, a loud noise in the darkness. He was surprised Potter could even see, the sod couldn’t even see in daylight but apparently he had been here countless times before as he dragged Draco over to a corner of the wall with a painting.
Draco broke the silence, “Potter.”
He paused, “Well, brilliant. Good for you mate,” He stood up and sat down on Blaise’s bed. He tried to ignore the cracking of his heart but it was pretty bloody difficult.
Potter sat up properly, rubbing his face, “I just couldn’t. Why are you awake?”
Potter had brought his own pet, a small bowtruckle that crawled around his shoulders and on his deck. It was named James. Aquila and James actually got along surprisingly well, the small creature liked to sit on Aquila’s head while she slept, sometimes staying there when she walked around Hogwarts waving to everyone who walked by. Draco had to admit, seeing his Crup and Potter’s bowtruckle being so cute together made his heart melt.
“We only ate like four hours ago.”
“Draco? Were you meant to get three different versions of the same snowglobe?” Harry was holding two of them, in which one had a little wizard on a broomstick and the other had a small hippogriff trotting around a small witch.
Harry nodded mutely, his concentration on following the lines around Draco’s chest. He finished the scar’s pattern and dropped his hand. He looked upset, Draco noted. Without thinking, Draco picked up Harry’s limp hand, causing the other boy to stare at him,
Harry couldn’t have been more wrong.
“Will you stop that?! I can’t wrap presents with you being right behind me every three seconds.” He turned around and placed his hands on his hips, pinning Harry with a glare.
Harry frowned and stood up, letting Draco’s limp hand fall back on the bed.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Didn’t you hear what that woman said? Honestly Harry you need to stop being so oblivious, it’s gonna be the death of you.” He detached himself from Harry and opened the backseat of their car, placing the groceries carefully on the seat. He went back to the passenger seat and buckled himself in, leaning heavily on the car door.
Draco examined the man more closely. His skin was a beautiful rich colour, it complimented well with his freckles and unruly hair. The freckles were scattered across his nose and ran over his cheeks, occasionally Draco spotted one stray freckle down by his chin. His lips were full, fuller than Draco’s. They pouted out in sleep, making him look like a toddler.
Slughorn approached him, “Of course my boy, don’t worry about earlier, I see your friend needs help so would you just keep him seated while I prepare the antidote. It shouldn’t take too long.” He smiled at Harry and turned back around to his bench, already preparing the ingredients. Harry relaxed his shoulders and turned back to Draco, who had found another pillow and was cuddling it to his chest.
“No I couldn’t, a man gets hungry in the morning!” Ron replied haughtily.
“Well, then Pott-”
“How many times have you been in here?”
“Where the hell did you get this?” He asked in disbelief.
Pansy laughed in her high pitched way, “Oh Potter, just because you're his best friend it does not mean you are better than me. He chose me,” She said scathingly. Her eyes were constantly flicking to Draco, “I suppose you want to be close to him now that he’s vulnerable and away from me, the only chance you’ll get Potter.”
“Just change it Draco.” He pulled up to the intersection and waited for the light to turn green. Draco reached forward haughtily and fiddled with the knobs and buttons, doing nothing but increasing the volume to max and making the car vibrate. Draco twisted the volume all the way back down to zero, pulling his hand away slowly like it was a wild animal.

"Oooh! How scary!"
"Why is it so funny?" Gregory Goyle, the brunette, asked with a confused tone. Draco bit his bottom lip in an attempt to control his laughter. Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were never very smart. Ever since Draco had met them as a young child, the two boys proved themselves again and again to be half-witted fools. Although at times Draco found their senseless talk laughable, majority of the time the blond boy felt an extreme amount of pity for them (not that Draco would admit that out loud though).
"Yes, father," Draco responded with a nod. "Can we go to Broomstix afterwards?"
"I thought fancy purebloods were supposed to keep it in their pants before marriage, Forge!"
An idea came to Draco-- but if this was the answer, Draco wanted to AK himself. "Is the answer," Draco started, gaining the attention from all of the students around him. "a stick?"
know that their deaths weren't exactly natural, right?"
"Hermione! For the five hundredth time, I'm not obsessed with him! If anything, the pasty ferret is obsessed with me!"
Draco smiled sadly as he thought of his mother. "Yes, miss. She is."
After that statement, the woman continued talking about her children, filling the muggle monster contraption with stories of warmth and love. Draco tried to listen as she spoke but slowly found himself falling asleep to the woman's comforting voice. His last thought before dozing off was of his own mother and how if this muggle woman thought of her own children this much in their absence, then his mother must be having a nervous breakdown with him and Estella gone.
“You think Malfoy is bent?” Harry asked in shock.
hi friends! I'm so sorry for the hiatus! I have an explanation if y'all are interested!
"I'm done answering questions," Draco tried to sound firm but his voice came out pathetic and shaky.
"They left to discuss your situation," the redheaded woman replied.
Draco finished the entire glass in under a minute, disregarding any sense of decorum Draco still had in his exhausted state. When he placed the glass down onto the table, he glanced back up to see the two adults staring at him with astonished looks on their faces.
"Draco and Estella."
Harry thought,
"Funny?" Black questioned with a laugh. "Dora, that-"
This sent the first-years into a mini frenzy.
“Ron did it first,” Ginny said quickly, causing Ron to turn red once again.
The Great Hall was impressive-- to an extent. Although the other children gaped at the levitating candles and the 'open' night sky, Draco merely glanced at the hall and proceeded to examine his trimmed fingernails. Unfortunately for the designer of the Great Hall, the blond aristocrat had witnessed more magnificent sights in the Manor's guest coat closet.
"Isn't this her fourth husband?" a pale boy with dark hair, Theodore Nott, questioned. Blaise nodded at the boy, his smirk growing wider as he did.
I hope all of you are safe and healthy! I'll be keeping y'all in my prayers!
Diagon Alley was very busy that day. The blond boy had to refrain himself from clutching to his mother's hand, fearful of losing his parents in the crowd. There were too many people, causing Draco to develop a sense of claustrophobia. He cringed away from strangers and remained on both his mother's and father's sides. Narcissa glanced down at her son who was presently bumping into her to stay away from the wizards around them. She gave him a small smile before stopping in front of Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.
Draco pushed his way through the flood of students before he finally reached her. Before Draco could even utter a word, the girl pulled him into a crushing hug causing the boy's face to morph into that of pain as he felt all of the air leave his lungs. "Pansy... can't... breathe," he croaked, out of breath. The girl, Pansy, backed away immediately, her face flushed in embarrassment.
"He must not be worth it anyways-- Potter, I mean," Draco looked away from the window to glare at Blaise. "he's best friends with a Weasley, Draco. Celebrity or not-- it's pathetic."
"Once you all get broomsticks you can try it! I just wouldn't recommend it," Robert exclaimed as he walked up to the large brown door. The first-years followed behind him but at a slower pace, however, since they were still catching their breaths. "Ask an easy one, knocker," Robert said to the bronze eagle-shaped knocker. "These are newbies."
The blond gave the fugitive a suspicious look, “And why are you telling me this?”
unaware of the shockwave that went through the Gryffindor. “W-What did you say her name was?”
"But Mione! He has a baby!" - Fred & George together
It was him. The boy who killed You-Know-Who. The boy who survived the killing curse. It was... the average boy Draco had met in Madam Malkin's robe shop? Draco was shocked to say the least and it seemed that the average boy was too. The two stared at each other for a moment before Draco spoke. "Is it true?" Draco asked, trying to mask his confusion with faux confidence. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?"
well-- at least, not as well as he knew the other children in the compartment. The blond had met Blaise a few time when they were very young but then the black boy moved to Italy with his mother. After that, Draco only saw Blaise yearly-- when the young boy visited England with his mother. Although they hadn't interacted often, the two boys somehow managed to develop a camaraderie between themselves.
Draco was too busy trying to calm himself down to pay attention to the adults across the table as they all whispered among themselves and slowly left the room one by one. By the time Draco gathered his wits together, the room was completely vacant besides the Weasley matriarch sitting directly across from him. Her round face was marred with a look of guilt and concern. Draco sniffed and glanced around the empty dining room. "Where did they all go?"
"I think that's quite enough," McGonagall said. "The boy has gone through quite the ordeal and has told us enough."
"Are you excited?" his mother asked him with a smile. Her smile was gorgeous; took years off her, Draco thought. The blond boy was dressed in a casual robe, casual but expensive. He had his hair slicked back (thanks to his mother) and wore a faux bored look on his face.
Hermione had an inquisitive look on her face as she backed away from the sweaty boy and stood up straight. "A dream? Was it a nightmare?"
With that, the Weasley matriarch headed inside with Estella sobbing in her arms. Draco tore his eyes away from the woman and his sister and looked over at the fugitive who was staring at the blonde with an unreadable look on his face. "You heard the woman," Black said roughly, "come inside."
"This doesn't mean our conversation is over, boy. We have a lot to discuss."
The silence was brutal. Draco scratched his cheek awkwardly and stared back at his cousin before saying, "So-"
"Harry! Just tell me!"
"His kind of pureblood do the nasty with their own relatives, Gred. It must be his mother's-"
Draco heard of the surname Longbottom but...
As the redheaded woman spelled more water into the glass with a simple Aguamenti charm, Draco heard the sound of somebody being flooed in, then the sound of somebody arriving with a portkey, and then the sound of multiple people walking towards the dining room. One by one, multiple people piled into the dining room— some of which Draco did recognize, some of which he didn't. Draco watched carefully as the Weasley patriarch, professor McGonagall, two of his old DADA professors (the werewolf and unfortunately, Mad-Eye-Moody), and two people in Auror uniforms (one with purple hair who looked oddly familiar and a tall dark-skinned man who Draco had never seen before in his entire life) sat down at the table. None of them sat next to Draco and instead, stared at the teen with guarded looks from across the table.
Draco thought as the woman drove away.
Draco nodded slowly, "You're right, Blaise," the black boy beamed as Draco sighed softly. "I just cannot believe he rejected me! Me! That loser rejected me!"
, because sleeping with the lizard man would look
Black clutched his stomach as he continued to laugh uncontrollably.
“Fer- Ron! That's not even a real word!”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, this is Vincent Crabbe and this is Gregory Goyle," Draco carelessly said. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."
The name Estella is Latin for "star." I was considering naming her Lyra because I know there's a constellation called Lyra. I also considered Cordelia and Aurora because they're moons but I decided on Estella because I thought the name was super pretty!
Draco rolled his eyes at the question. "Draco Lucius Malfoy."
"Okay first-years, head up to your dormitories," Robert started. "Tomorrow, Professor Flitwick will hand you your schedule, okay?" All of the first-years nodded. "Goodnight then."
also the last line... lmao. ANYWAYS! The next chapters will probably be longer since he'll be at Hogwarts and I want the plot to move along. I am planning on rewriting the whole series so this story will be long but I planned some of it out and I'm very excited to write it!!!
"Who's emo?" the three boys turned to see another first-year with brown hair sitting next to Draco. "Oh," he started, "don't mind me. I'm just enjoying the conversation," he glanced over at the three other boys before his eyes landed on Michael. "Let me guess? He's the emo one, right?"
"MALFOY?!"
"-and the pain you must experience at the unknown! Do not fear, Draco, I am one with you!" The woman was preaching now, waving her arms in the air frantically while Draco, Terry, Michael, and Anthony backed away slowly. "Your eye is strong, young Draco, almost as strong as mine! But do not be ashamed, my inner eye has had sight since long before your two eyes have opened-"
“You sound awfully defensive, Ronnykins,” Fred pointed out.
“In good news, Ron,” Ginny started as she tossed an arm around Ron's shoulders, “you're not the only guy in this room who wants a nibble of Malfoy's magic wand! You aren't alone anymore!” The awkward energy clouding the room dispelled quickly after that statement. Both Harry and Ron became red in mortification as they stuttered in their defense, while the twins roared with laughter.
"It was," all of the kids looked over at Vincent.
"Where are you two traveling from?" The brown haired muggle woman inquired after Draco told her an edited version of his actual destination. When Draco tried telling the woman the address on the note, he found himself physically unable to do it. Instead, the blonde told the muggle that he wanted to go to 13 Grimmauld Place instead. Draco assumed the place must’ve been under the Fidelius Charm and that Snape must’ve been the Secret Keeper. This knowledge made the teen feel a lot more secure about the place he was heading to; at least now Draco knew that the Dark Lord wouldn’t be able to find him.
“Language!” Mrs. Weasley exclaimed, astonished. “There's a child in the room!”
“No, change the subject,” Remus said with his head buried in his paper.
“Rude?”
"But Mione! He has a baby!"
Ron shook his head in denial, "Nah. If there was, mum would've told me to fuck off and twiddle my thumbs for the day."
Before Draco could respond, Madam Malkin said, "That's it! You're done, my dear," the average boy hopped off of the footstool and walked towards the door. Before opening the door he turned around and waved at Draco. The pale boy waved back awkwardly and watched as the other boy strolled outside and grabbed his ice cream cone from Hagrid.
“Fine,” Fred said, “Then can you tell George?”
Draco shivered in horror before he looked over at the platter of overdone beef at the Ravenclaw table. Trelawney wasn't even right about the beef, so Draco doubted she was right about his 'inner eye'. The blonde glanced at the teacher's table where Trelawney was absent before repressing a sigh.
“Maybe his parents are mad that he has a daughter!” Ron suggested.
"I dunno, Ron. But I know who was thinking about them!" The redheaded girl teased. Ron's face turned a bright red as he started to splutter a response in defense of his honor. However, before he could, a loud clanging bell sound echoed throughout the ancient home. The four teens looked at each other in confusion.
Draco repressed a shiver as Black continued to speak, “What a perfect little Black he was… unlike me. He was a Slytherin, and he was a strong believer in all things blood purity. He supported the Death Eaters, Voldemort,” Draco couldn't repress a shiver after hearing the Dark Lord's name spoken aloud, “their cause,” Black paused and watched Draco carefully, “he eventually saw the light, though, and tried to back out.”
The first week was unfortunate for Draco, to put it bluntly.
Draco thought as he looked back up at the houses in front of him.
"Tired already?" a thin black boy asked with a smirk. Draco narrowed his eyes at the boy sitting across from him.
Draco felt a twinge of apprehension before squashing the feeling entirely. Draco turned to his roommates and in an attempt to look unalarmed, he casually (awkwardly) stated, "Lets go to the Great Hall... I'm hungry."
“Your baby! Who's the mother?” George asked instead with a sly smile on his face. “Who's the lucky lady?!”
The song went on for hours (or at least it felt that way). Draco and the other two children stood in boredom as the Sorting Hat described all of the houses in an annoyingly peppy tune. The whole entire hall burst into applause, indicating the song's end. The blond let out a sigh of relief, "Thank Merlin that's over," he muttered as Professor McGonagall stepped forward with a long roll of parchment.
"Who is the toddler you arrived with?"
“Okay, then can you tell Fred?”
"Professor... we're in your classroom."
him? The blond was mortified. Draco's hand shooting down to his side as he tried to control his facial expressions.  "I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraffs like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."
"Harassing?" Hermione questioned, immediately catching on to Harry's vague description. "In what way?"
"No, sir. This was my own doing."
Draco stomped away before he could hear any more.
(See the end of the chapter for
"HA!" Black gave a deep throaty laugh and then slowly, Lupin, the Weasley patriarch, and the purple haired girl began laughing too. Draco watched as half of the adults laughed and the other half gave each other looks of exasperation. "
By the way! If y'all are wondering about the point of views in the story, you can tell who's pov we are kinda looking at by looking at how people are named. It's all third person limited for the most part and depending on whose pov it is, that determines what information is known or what is being observed. So, for example, Draco refers to Sirius Black as Black meanwhile Harry refers to him as Sirius. I hope that makes sense!
Draco bristled in response, “I'm not a bloody Death Eater! You know that! I said so when you and your crazy gang interrogated me!”
As Draco fed his sister the banana, he thought back to the events leading up to his and his sister's escape. After the Dark Lord's resurrection, life had gone downhill for Draco. While the Dark Lord and his followers haven't officially moved into the Manor, they might as well have since they were visiting the mansion on an almost daily basis. The Death Eaters never dared to touch Draco due to his father's standing but that didn't stop them from making comments that made Draco very uncomfortable. Fenrir Greyback, while not a Death Eater, constantly made statements about how good Draco smelled and Amycus Carrow also made gross remarks about how he imagined running his hands through Draco's pale locks. However, nothing was worse than the Dark Lord's appraisals.
“Then why am I here?” Draco questioned with a panicked look in his eye. “If I was born a Death Eater, then why house me? Why even entertain me? Why didn't you take my sister and leave me on the sidewalk the second you saw me outside this house's door? After all,” Draco sneered, “I'm a Death Eater.”
Silence filled the room. The two stared at each other. Trelawney stared in what seemed to be an analytical gaze, meanwhile Draco stared back in discomfort. The blond licked his bottom lip anxiously before turning his gaze away from the teacher. "You said you wanted to meet me-"
Daphne scoffed, "Greengrass, Daphne," the girl said with pride. "and you?"
“Honestly,” Ginny said. “I don't think the kid is Malfoy's.”
"But Mione! He has a baby!" - Fred & George together
“We're floor mates,” Black answered before pointing towards the room on the right. “That's my room and that,” Sirius gestured to the room on the left, “is yours.”
Apparently, the muggle woman was also heading to London and knew where the neighborhood on the paper was. Draco sat with Estella in his lap and his backpack on his feet in the seat next the muggle woman. The muggle woman had her hands on the wheel and was constantly shifting her eyes off the road and onto the Malfoy siblings.
“Can all of you shut up and let me talk?” Hermione demanded. The Weasley siblings quieted down and turned towards Hermione. “Malfoy looked awful, as in he looked tired. He looked absolutely exhausted. If I didn't know any better, Malfoy must've stayed up all night.”
“Are we in the Twilight Zone?” Harry asked Hermione in horror as Malfoy successfully fed the babe in his arms.
Draco turned to his trunk and his owl's cage immediately. "No, I'll be fine," he replied. Draco looked up at the luggage rack above him, contemplating whether or not he should even attempt at placing his trunk there. After a moment, Draco decided to not even try (sure, Draco's father charmed his things to be lighter but Draco was still a pampered eleven year-old boy! He can barely drag his trunk around with him let alone lift it up onto a rack that's almost two feet taller than him!). The blond boy took his trunk and placed it underneath the seats while placing his owl in the corner of the compartment. The other children moved over, giving Draco the window seat on his left. The whistle of the train sounded as Draco sat down with a huff.
well for it not to be true.
Black rolled his eyes, "No shit, blondie. That's not what I'm asking."
The argument was interrupted by a light knock on the door. All the teens turned around to face the door just as it opened, revealing their former Defense Against the Dark Art's professor, Remus Lupin. The werewolf looked at the occupants of the room before settling his sights on Ginny. He let out a loud sigh, “Please don't discuss your classmate's genitalia,” Lupin started, “I think you've all spent too much time with Sirius.”
"When?" Blaise questioned.
Malfoy nodded slowly but did not respond. The inhabitants of the room stared at each other awkwardly, while Mrs. Weasley sat down in her seat and looked at all of them with a strained smile. Mrs. Weasley clapped loudly, causing everyone to jump, “Now, let's start eating! I'm famished!”
While Lucius Malfoy being part of the Dark Lord's inner circle had some perks, it mostly came with disadvantages. For one, being the sole son of a prominent figure in the Dark Lord's army meant that Draco received more attention from the Dark Lord than he was comfortable with. The Dark Lord had a perverted interest in Draco. Whenever the man was over, he would always call the blonde to the study for a 'talk'. These 'talks' consisted of the Dark Lord leering at the teenager while stroking the head of his pet snake Nagini. Contrary to the name of their meetings, not many words were spoken during these 'talks', but when words were spoken, they mirrored the perverted remarks Carrow and Greyback also gave Draco. However, unlike the other two men, the Dark Lord was flamboyantly vulgar and straight to the point ("I missed having a physical form, little dragon," the Dark Lord once said in a soft tone. "Now, I can appreciate beautiful creatures such as yourself... both visually and physically," Draco's face flushed in mortification at the statement. The Dark Lord smirked as he saw Draco's blush and misinterpreted it as a pleasured response to his perverted implication. "When you receive your dark mark, pretty dragon, I will also gift you with pleasure. A true testament to your evolution into adulthood," Draco didn't bother correcting the older man that he still wouldn't be of age at the time of his scheduled recruitment. Instead, Draco focused on pushing the bile that was quickly building up in his throat down).
"Yes, but dear," Narcissa started, "This is the beginning of your Hogwarts journey. You'll receive your books, your robes, your wand, your-"
"I-I don't know why my mind came up with this-"
"Let me rephrase the question. Did your parents help you disappear?"
While everyone placed food on their plates, Malfoy looked around the table with a frown on his face, “Mrs. Weasley,” the blond said, causing everyone in the room to look at him. “Is there any baby food for-”
Harry Potter?" Blaise inquired, his eyes wide in surprise. The other children's eyes were wide as well-- their's in surprise, Draco's in fear. For the last two months, Draco has tried forgetting the strange dreams he had the day he visited Diagon Alley; he almost did too. He almost forgot the dying old woman, the muscular teen who was angry with him (Harry... his name was Harry...), the old man accusing him of being a murderer, and even the fact that the older blond boy in all of those dreams were
Fred let out a loud sigh, “Fine! I'll just ask him when he comes downstairs. Which by the way,” Fred looked around the dining room where the Weasley siblings, Hermione, Harry, and Remus all sat waiting for supper while Mrs. Weasley prepared dinner in the kitchen. Ever since Remus sat them all down and explained the situation, the Gryffindors have been downstairs, avoiding the Slytherin as much as possible. And by 'explained the situation', Remus explained the bare minimum. Apparently, Malfoy was seeking asylum for him and the baby and was on a strict house arrest at Grimmuald's Place until school started. Remus gave no explanation for the baby or why exactly Malfoy decided to up and escape his home. “Where is the git? Is he not coming down?”
"Hey, Draco," a chubby boy greeted. "do you need help with your stuff?"
but because you care for your sister. Am I wrong?" Draco frowned at the woman's critical statements about his family but shook his head in response anyway. "That's what I thought," the redheaded mother then shook her head in exasperation. "You ran all this way knowing full well that you would have to care for a toddler alone and at your age no less. It's commendable, honestly. I can't imagine my boys or even my Ginny caring for a toddler. Maybe Charlie or Bill but the others..." Molly Weasley trailed off, lost in thought.
Next chapter will be out in early August!
teacher's -- explained his entire situation way
Draco had never felt more lost in his life. "Dumbledore?"
"WHY IS MALFOY HERE?!" - Harry
“Because he's here as a refugee,” Ron surmised. “He probably travelled all night to get here. The Manor isn't close to London, and he didn't come here with a broom. You can't exactly apparate, use a portkey, or ride the Knight Bus with a baby. So, he probably walked here.”
"Are you two okay?" The muggle woman in the metal appliance asked. "Do you two need a ride?"
“I agree with everything you all said, but that's not what I was going for,” Ginny said with a smile. “I mean gay!”
too cute to be Malfoy's offspring?”
This statement caused many of the adults to share looks with each other. The Auror kept his eyes on Draco and said, "that's all he did? He didn't tell you anything else?"
"Can someone tell me what an 'emo' is?" Before any of the boys could answer Draco's question, plates packed with a sundry of foods appeared on the table. All the children cheered as Draco sighed (at the moment, he was a bit too upset for food). Draco watched as the students surrounding him piled food onto their plates and he started to the same-- but to a lesser extent. He was picking at his vegetables for about ten minutes before anybody said anything.
“Who in their right mind would sleep with that ferret?”
But I digress... I decided to just write everything I wanted into my own little (lmao) fanfiction. Hopefully you will enjoy it! Also, the tags and ratings may change as the story progresses because I haven't exactly planned out where this story is going. I just have an idea of what's going to happen. Enjoy!
Draco thought, weighing the two options in his head.
that he was brooding when said low-born was the epitome of brooding. Draco shook his head in disgust, "well, frankly your
"I'm not yearning for anything!"
“Ferret-y?”
“Anyway,” Hermione said with a shudder. “How old is she?”
Malfoy nodded in response as the baby in his lap studied the bowl in his hand. Everyone in the room watched as Malfoy dug the spoon into the eggs and lifted the spoon to the baby's mouth. The girl sniffed the food and whined before turning her head away. Malfoy closed his eyes in frustration before opening them to gaze down at the baby. “For a one-year-old, you're really picky,” Malfoy mumbled. Malfoy sighed before putting a cheesy smile on his face and raising the pitch of his voice, “Wow! This food looks really good!” Malfoy said in a faux energetic tone. The Slytherin seemed to forget the other occupants of the dining room as he continued speaking to the toddler in an animated baby voice, “If you don't want it, then it's all mine!” Malfoy then put the spoon in his mouth and grimaced before placing a strained smile over it. “Mmm! So, good!” This seemed to have worked because the then disgusted girl was now reaching out to grab the bowl of food.
Both the average boy and the Weasley shot out of their seats.
“Harry, Malfoy is
There was another silence.
"I'm sorry but who are you?" Draco asked with a sneer. Daphne froze in place, her eyes moving slowly until she spotted Draco.
"I do-- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?" Draco gave him a small smile, hoping it would hide his distress. What were those voices? Why did they sound so familiar?
family reunions," Daphne drawled, "Millie, Pansy, and I must go. We have gossip to discuss!"
Thank you so much to everyone who read my first chapter! I honestly didn't expect this many people to read my fic so thanks lol. AS FOR BEING LATE!!!
child. She's my sister.”
“Why am I the President?!” Ron exclaimed. “Shouldn't I be the Prime Minister?”
"Shut it," Black demanded. Draco closed his mouth quickly, his teeth making an audible clacking sound as he did. Black leaned back in his chair and gave Draco an annoyed look. "Just don't talk until they come, all right? Save both of us a headache and just sit pretty while we wait." Draco grimaced at the word 'pretty', the word bringing back uncomfortable memories about a certain perverted Dark Lord.
"Right... I knew that..."
There was a moment of silence. Then another. And then another. And then-
cursed.
"Vince!" Draco exclaimed. The chubby boy shrugged as his cheeks flushed.
Harry cheeks flushed again as he looked down at a loose thread on the comforter. The teenaged boy picked at the thread before murmuring, "Like... sexually."
"Is this supposed to be a trick question?" A tan girl asked, her eyebrows furrowed.
The Weasley matriarch gave Draco a sharp smile that made the teenager shiver. "Don't worry, dear," she said in an overly cheery tone. "I'll make them listen!"
"I hope you are mindful of your own intuitions," the four boys all jumped in surprised at the abrupt voice. They all turned around to see a frazzled looking woman with brown frizzy hair and large green eyes that were oddly enhanced by her circular glasses. She was dressed in an olive green blouse and a dull orange skirt or in Draco's opinion, she was dressed in house-elf rags. The woman was staring at Draco, who grimaced at the sight of her. Once Draco noticed her staring, however, his grimace contorted into a look of confusion.
“Maltesers,” Harry says nervously to the gargoyle guarding Dumbledore’s office.
Harry goes to his chest and pulls out a ratty t-shirt and pair of jeans, throwing them to Ron. "We're going to try the circle thing Hermione was talking about. Can you draw a bunch of circles on these?"
"How long have you been married?"
“You’re beautiful too, darling.” He was, too. He had those stunning grey eyes and angles sharp as cut glass. She'd only seen his natural hair color once but even that 'dishwater' color was stunning. It wasn't the color of his father's white blond, and she suspected that was the main problem with it. Still was, going by the way he bleached his hair every fortnight. Add in the eyeliner, jewelry, and glittering embroidery and he was drop-dead gorgeous any day of the week.
His father’s eyes pierce his, and he attempts Occlumency as he was taught. “Yes, Father.” He feels a warm glow of pride when his father simply nods and turns back to his desk, dismissing him. If he'd failed he would have heard about it until they arrived at King's Cross, but now he can spend his evening relaxing instead.
“No you’re not.”
She grinned widely, redirecting steam from freshly heated water through a series of pipes and heard the satisfying whistle and even more satisfying thump of Draco falling off the bed.
“What?” he said as Pansy coughed out a shower of sparks. (“I just cleaned those bricks,” Harry tutted at her.) “I
"No idea. I think I'm going to use it when I time travel though, if I'm wearing it when I leave, hopefully it'll keep people from realizing I'm there, and I won't have to practice any of the disillusionment spells Dumbledore told me about."
"He's such an old man," Draco said fondly.
The man looks at him, confused. “I
“Right.” The cheery Harry of earlier was gone, and he and a subdued Teddy set the table and cut the bread.
A shiver runs down Harry's spine as Flamel casts another spell over him and he tries to think about how much to reveal.
"Why- why would you ask that?"
"But even though your clothes traveled with you, the chair didn't," Hermione points out, thankfully moving on. "A broom has some of the same functions as a chair, even more reason to think it wouldn't travel with you."
“It’s a huge belt too,” Hermione says, putting it around her own waist. “Chances are none of the belt holes fit you properly, is that right? You’ll just have to note how you’re wearing your belt from now on. As circular as possible, to start. We can take it from there. Nothing else here has any circles. Except maybe the socks. Harry, most of these have giant holes in them!”
. Oh, and owl treats for Lyra, of course. I know I’ve been to Diagon before but it’s just so exciting this time.”
“Oh yeah,” Harry said, at the same time a new voice said, “Of course.”
Harry rolls his eyes, and Draco’s secretly glad he doesn’t mention it again. The whole period of time around there made Draco cringe. He’d requested a few months beforehand that Harry call him Malfoy, and Draco would call Harry by his last name, but Harry had refused both requests.
Their eyes go wide when he tells them about younger Dumbledore who was already a Hogwarts Professor, and what 1920s Paris was like, not that he saw much of it before he was pulled back into the present.
Harry obediently drops the white rocks and instead grabs hold of the man's matching silver-white hair. Up close, the lines on his face stand out, and Harry traces them with his free hand, his bright green eyes focused on his task.
I'm alive! Sorry it's been like 7 months since I posted the last chapter. I have been working on it, it's just that a) I'm a perfectionist, b) I keep thinking of new things I want to include at this point of the story, and c) I'm trying to finish a degree while battling depression during a pandemic. I have no idea when the next chapter is going to be ready, but it's going to be A While.
Harry swallows, still tasting the tea and biscuits from his time with Flamel and Dumbledore. "1922."
"Well maybe Snape's just forgotten?" Ron chimes in. "Hey, let's tell Dumbledore Snape's forgetting things, maybe he'll sack him!"
"What kind of potions are you on? Of course you have magic!"
Harry nods again. "As long as Professor Dumbledore doesn't know I told you." He doesn't fancy angering the one person who could help him control his power.
"Oh, like you were much earlier," one of the others answers. He's dressed in black muggle clothes, his dark, curly hair almost to his shoulders. "We almost tripped into you when we came through. Bad manners, Jamesy! Wait til I tell mum!" he sing-songs.
It works. “What’s the important part?”
"A pleasure," the third wizard of the group says, shaking both of their hands. "Frank Longbottom."
Down the long stretch of watery tunnel, Harry can see a small body lying prone, red hair splayed out. He runs toward it, flinging his wand aside to check that Ginny is still alive.
"I want to," Harry said. None of them had even touched their soup, and Pansy just knew she was going to have to reheat it for them.
“So I suppose I did lie to you just now. I don’t know if I have changed the future by doing something in the past. Sometimes I have no choice. I find myself in the middle of a fight, and there’s nothing I can do but participate, and try to ensure I get back to my present still alive. Sometimes there is no danger, but is it wrong to talk to people or do things while in the other time and place, where anything you do, any breath you take could change the future to the point where you no longer exist?
"Headmaster Dippet would not have granted you the Award for Special Services to the School if he did not agree as well, and believe me, my boy, that will come in handy when job hunting!"
He definitely needs to introduce Greg and Vince to this game, they'll love it.
“I thought you were going back to bed?” she asked.
“So,” Harry says, trying to sound casual but not succeeding in the slightest. He has no idea what’s going on, something must have happened while he was gone for both of them to be acting weird.
"We are not doing that," Hermione says. "Because I know what Harry's condition is."
“You look all dressed up,” Harry says, a little disappointed. Sometimes he visits just when Draco is about to leave, and they don’t have as much time to hang out.
“What, now?”
A blue-haired teen about four years younger than Harry’s normal age answered the door, and Harry stumbled backwards despite himself. “W-wizard Malfoy,” he said, in his old croaky voice.
Harry just leaned towards Draco with a grin. "You love it."
“Hagrid said Hogwarts was the safest place besides Gringotts, and remember someone tried to break into that vault?”
He could hug them, and tell them he loves them, and thank them for everything they've done. He could change the future, the past, make it so that they wouldn't have to die. He could learn what they were really like, and the sheer possibility is extremely painful.
They round the corner and almost run directly into Professor McGonagall.
"It's a Colour-Change Potion!" Draco announces. "Dobby sets the fire levels for me and makes sure nothing blows up, but I do the rest." None of his friends have successfully brewed this potion, but he has. "I even juiced the flobberworm, see?"
Which is why when he hears the voice whispering murderously again and follows it to the first floor corridor, he's shocked into the reminder that his ability only allows him glimpses of things that might not even matter for years, if ever.
“Well. I was a- I played quidditch at Hogwarts and I know how to train pretty well without a broom. Do you have a snitch?”
"...but it wouldn't be fair. You're such a Gryffindor."
Harry looks around the room, trying to get more context. The room is covered in richly coloured flowery wallpaper, complete with bees buzzing from flower to flower against the dark backdrop. There's a fancy, marble fireplace on the wall near him, a low fire burning even though it's very warm in the room. And, there, in the corner, is that-? It looks like Dumbledore! He's talking to some other wizards and witches Harry doesn't recognize. They're all holding drinks, but again it doesn't seem to be a celebration. He remembers the wizards near him talking about "our side." Is this the war with Voldemort before he was born? Another one completely?
DISCLAIMER: I am and always will be a fan of the Harry Potter series... HOWEVER, I do not support JK Rowling and her disgusting remarks about trans women. Trans women are women. If you disagree, just stop reading. Any bigotry of any kind isn't accepted here. As a woman of color, I'm not going to tolerate that shit! So please leave if you are racist, transphobic, homophobic, islamaphobic, etc.
“Oh! Yes! Accio baby's food!” Mrs. Weasley incanted as a bowl of scrambled eggs, avocado, and steamed peas landed in her hand. She handed Malfoy the bowl as she spoke, “It has been a while since I made baby food. I'll send Kreacher tomorrow to fetch more ingredients!”
George cleared his throat and glanced at his twin brother, “Forge, I believe this is the sign for us to leave.”
him. He saw Blaise and Pansy talking while Theo chimed in occasionally. He saw Vincent and Gregory eating their hearts out while Daphne lectured them to slow down. He saw Millicent--
"Is that a
"-can see it. We know," the Auror interrupted, finishing the blonde's sentence. Draco let out a sigh before reaching into his pocket, pulling the paper out, and handing the paper over to the man questioning him. The man handed the paper over to McGonagall and the woman flicked her wand over the slip.
"MALFOY?!" - Fred, George, Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Ginny
Trelawney led Draco to the nearest wooden desk and sat him down on a chair. She then pointed towards the crystal ball in front of him and said, "Look and you shall see."
"I will ask you
"I don't know how to care for toddlers," Draco admitted with a look of embarrassment.
"My one-year-old sister, Estella." That answer caused many people's eyebrows to raise.
Black stood silently and seemed to contemplate the question for a moment before answering, “Regulus officially became a Death Eater when he was only sixteen,” it was as if someone had cast a lightning charm on Draco; the blond stared at Black with wide eyes.
All of the adults stared at Draco with mixed expressions on their faces. While the others looked a little annoyed and surprised, Moody looked downright homicidal.
Malfoy stared at Fred with a bewildered look on his pointy face. “Pardon?”
"Yes," said the average boy.
Terry smiled, "I know I'm right."
After this comment, both Michael and Anthony started to bicker over whether or not Michael was emo. Draco rolled his eyes and looked away, choosing to look around the Great Hall rather than at the two boys. Draco's eyes stopped abruptly. His eyes fell onto the Slytherin table and Draco watched as all of his friends ate and talked with each other--
“But it does, doesn't it?” Hermione interrupted. “Did you see how awful Malfoy looked?”
"Who rejected you?"
"You most certainly are
“What's this got to do with Dumbledore?” Harry questioned. Hermione rolled her eyes at the interruption.
“Gred,” Fred started with a sinister smile, “this is the sign for us to stay!”
Malfoy looked up at Harry with furrowed brows, “Estella…? I know you're as dense as a rock, but even you should understand this, Potter.”
There was nothing less than a smile on Draco's face; he felt an euphoric sense of excitement, showing his excitement to all of the wizards near him. His parents were at his side as Draco sauntered confidently through the train station. His parents' faces were impassive; only changing their expressions when another wizard either gawked or glowered at them to which the Malfoy elders responded with seething glares.
The second disadvantage was that the Dark Lord had been constantly pressuring Draco's father into allowing the fifteen-year-old to join his ranks. Draco managed to bully his father into asking the Dark Lord to push his recruitment date back; to Draco’s and Lucius’ surprise, the elder Malfoy somehow convinced the crazed man into giving Draco the dark mark next summer— the summer after his fifth year at Hogwarts. To say Draco was not excited would be an understatement. Draco did
"What was it about?"
The Ravenclaw Prefects led the way to the Ravenclaw Tower with the first-years close behind them. The way there was painful, rather, the way
Hermione hummed thoughtfully, “Maybe…”
"Can all of you shut it-" - Sirius
The werewolf let out a tired sigh. "Padfoot-"
"That you can."
7/19 UPDATE: because of Eid and a vacation I’m taking, I won’t be able to update before Monday like promised. Eid Mubarak everyone!
“Yeah, because the git hates my guts!”
“That's what I came here to explain. Now, all of you sit down and let me explain.”
Yes, Dumbledore! Who else-"
Thanks for reading!!
Pansy snickered, "That's rather unfortunate," Draco smirked as another girl was called up to the Sorting Hat... only to be sorted into Hufflepuff as well. Pansy shook her head in disbelief, "Our class is cursed... how embarrassing."
"How dramatic," Theo deadpanned. Draco's glare intensified.
The rest of the adults nodded in response while the male Auror next to Black sat up straight in his seat and looked straight at the blonde teenager. Draco stared back as he waited for the older man to start tossing questions his way.
"You just seemed... bothered, is all," his mother answered, eyeing her son carefully. Draco shrugged.
Draco audibly gulped, "...I can communicate using the ball."
“I don't like him! I hate him!” Ron cried.
Draco nodded slowly, "Yeah... I hope you're right."
Ron and Harry spluttered in their defense, while Remus pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. “Just,” Remus started weakly, “don't fight. Try not to, at least. For me. Can you all do that?”
Hermione's eyebrows shot up in shock. "Sexually?"
"So, you have this... 'advanced sight'?" Draco slowly asked, anxiety seeping into his voice.
Once they had finally reached the top of the staircase, all of the first-years were heaving. "Why. Can't. We. Just. Teleport!" Anthony huffed out before going into a coughing fit.
Molly Weasley frowned. "They are most likely going to let you stay, but in the off-chance that they don't, I will make sure you stay," the redhead said, her voice drenched in determination. "I'm not letting two children, especially one who has suffered as much as yourself, be thrown out into the wild. It's too dangerous!"
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"
find this place?" The man asked calmly, albeit strained calmness.
Abra smiled back before saying her farewells to the pair and wishing them a healthy life. Draco said goodbye back and thanked her for her generosity again before swinging his backpack over his shoulder and leaving the muggle invention.
The Slytherin jolted awake, shaking Estella and causing her to arouse with his abrupt movement. The toddler began to cry and both Draco and the muggle woman cooed at her. Draco held the blonde baby close to his chest as he whispered words to comfort into her ear. Once the baby finally calmed down, Draco looked up to see that the metallic creature had stopped moving. "How long was I asleep for?"
"I'm Michael Corner," the emo boy said with a frown. "And I'm not emo."
“That's not evidence of him being bent for me!” Harry said. “Hell, I know Malfoy's favorite fruit, and I'm not gay!”
At the thought of Millicent, Draco hesitantly looked up and glanced towards the Slytherin table... only to see Millicent staring right at him with a slimy smirk on her face. "Bloody hell!" Draco exclaimed as he hastily looked away from his third cousin.
"It was the truth," Vincent mumbled.
"Draco Malfoy, right?" the brunette next to Draco asked. Draco nodded. "I'm Terry Boot... and if it makes you feel better, both of my parents were Hufflepuffs."
Mrs. Weasley gave both twins a look of pure disappointment. “Just… will all of you keep the conversation appropriate? For the babe?” The twins apologized to their mother in tandem before turning back to their food.
"I'm fifteen and I'm going to be a fifth year at Hogwarts."
The Auror nodded before continuing, "Do your parents know of your disappearance?"
Draco almost gagged at the comment but still managed to shake the hand Terry held out for him. "That's... rather unfortunate," Draco said.
The girl frowned slightly. She eyed the three boys in front of her, "I'm Hermione Granger," she said. "and this is Neville Longbottom."
That made my day!" Black let out a happy sigh and looked over at the smiling werewolf a few seats away from him. "The day we let Snape be the Secret Keeper is the day Remus becomes the top in our relationship."
"-How grateful must I be to see another one like me?"
ALSO WHOA 400+ KUDOS ??!?! omg whatttt thank you y'all are awesome
"When did you two even get here?"
“No I didn't!”
Harry gave Hermione a mystified look. "That's the thing. I have no idea."
Draco nodded to himself as he came to a conclusion.
Before Robert even finished, all of the first-years dashed to the dormitories to claim their beds.
"A celebrity?" Pansy asked with a curious tone. Daphne nodded, her thick brown hair bouncing as she did.
"The question is too personal, miss," Draco interrupted as he held Estella closer to his chest. The toddler made a noise and cuddled closer to Draco, causing the teenager to smile softly. The muggle woman watched the exchange before turning her eyes back to the road.
"Malfoy, Draco," the blond said, straightening his back while he did. The boy behind Hermione, Neville, immediately shot his eyes up at Draco, his eyes wide. Draco smirked at Neville before glancing back at Vincent and Gregory. "Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle."
But Draco Lucius Malfoy? An oracle? Draco almost snorted out loud at the thought.
“Who cares about that?!” Harry angrily exclaimed. “What the
I think I should have the next chapter up by next week but we shall see! I also have another Draco-centric fanfic I'm currently working on (it's about Draco being a seer! Check it out!) and I need to figure out my writing schedule.
“Or,” Ginny said with a smirk. “He wants to rearrange your guts!”
"About an hour," the muggle answered. "We're at your destination," the woman said with a small smile. Draco's eyes widened as he looked out the window to see a row of houses in front of him. The blonde then turned to the muggle woman who helped him get there.
Malfoy silently nodded as he continued to feed his sister. Hermione observed them with a small smile of her own. “She's cute.”
“If we asked Malfoy what your favorite fruit was, he would know,” Hermione said with confidence.
Draco glanced over at Anthony with an incredulous look. "You
That shut Draco up. Draco felt his face heat up again as he looked away from the average boy and at his friends behind him. "Crabbe, Goyle, lets go back to our compartment. I don't want to spend any more time with these plebs," Draco drawled, trying to hide his embarrassment.
"Yeah, Draco," they both said in unison, getting up to leave the compartment with Draco.
The two sat in a mutual silence for a few minutes before the mother Weasley walked into the room without Estella in her arms and a glass of water in her hands. "Malfoy, dear," the woman started, grabbing both men's attention, "the babe is sleeping. I conjured a cot and put her in there," Draco nodded, a wave of relief splashing through him as he thought of his sister being calm again. The Weasley then walked closer to the blonde and placed the glass of water in front of him. Draco looked up at the woman, raising a single eyebrow in question. "You look exhausted, child. I don't know how long you've been traveling but I know you must be parched," she said, answering his unasked question. She then walked to the other side of the table and sat next to Black.
"Cissy, don't taunt the boy," Lucius said, folding his paper and placing it down on the table in front of him. "He has every right to be excited. After all, my boy is becoming a man today."
"But-"
tell us who's baby that is?”
“No.”
There was a moment of silence before one of the prefects muttered: "Oh bloody hell..."
meet," Trelawney corrected. The towheaded child struggled to keep a sneer off his face after the rude interruption. "I foresaw our encounter years ago. My visions told me that an albino child-"
"No, I got this," Anthony said with confidence. The first-years all looked at him expectantly while Anthony took a deep, dramatic breath before answering, "the answer is... a shit."
“Sorry for being late,” Sirius apologized as him and Malfoy took their seats next to Remus. “Malfoy slept so much, even the baby woke up before him.”
"I think it is, little sister! Ickle Malfoy is a teen dad!" - Fred
Blaise raised his eyebrows at this, "What? Are you trying to recruit him, Draco?"
CONTENT WARNING: talks of & references to sexual harassment/pedophilia. I know I made it a tag for the fanfic but its talked about a lot in this chapter and I felt like it deserved a warning.
"I'll miss you too, mother... father."
Harry slowly turned to look at Malfoy who was busy feeding the baby—
Draco lifted the knocker and slammed it down hard against the door. The blonde didn't even wait a minute before the front door swung open to reveal his fugitive cousin, Sirius Black, pointing a wand at him and his sister.
The ever stoic Shacklebolt even looked shaken as he audibly gulped and leaned towards the shaking teen. "Malfoy, did You-Know-Who touch you?"
"I am a Seer, yes."
raw dogging it!”
Remus gave the twins a glare that made even them shiver. Ron looked over at his brothers and shook his head, “I'm telling you. It's his daughter!”
"Want another glass?" The Weasley matriarch asked.
“And who's the baby?” Fred asked. After this, all the children began asking questions. Remus let out another sigh before putting his hand up as a signal for them to quiet down.
"Maybe," Lucius answered, "but why would you want go? First years are not allowed to have their own broomsticks, surely you know that?"
thanks for reading!!
The boys all turned to see Pansy in front of an open compartment door. Theo smirked at her, "Harry Potter told Draco to piss off when Draco attempted to make him his friend."
"Well, of course he's obsessed with you, Harry, but-"
"Sorry, Draco," she apologized. Draco nodded at her as he attempted to regain his composure. Pansy cleared her throat and looked over at the compartment to her right before looking back at Draco. "Theodore, Blaise, Greg, and Vincent are already inside."
“EW!” Fred exclaimed. “That means your parents are
“Can you
"Therefore... My sight..." Draco couldn't bring himself to finish the sentence. His greatest fears were coming true and he didn't want to face the reality of the situation. If he truly was a Seer then all of those awful visions were going to come true one day; Draco couldn't understand most of them but he understood enough to know that the situations in his apparitions weren't good ones.
Black gave Draco an unreadable look before replying, “You don't have to die a Death Eater,” Draco's breathe caught in his throat as Black turned back towards his own room, “Now, go take a nap. You look like you're about to die from exhaustion before anything else.”
"Must be the 'pre-Hogwarts jitters' you spoke of, mother."
"In about ten or fifteen minutes," Pansy answered. "you should all change into your school robes, by the way."
"...Are you okay?" Draco blinked and looked up to see the average boy staring at him. The blond boy nodded quickly before clearing his throat.
“Seriously?!” Both Ron and Harry exclaimed with wide eyes.
The name Abra is Hebrew for "mother of many." I thought the name would be suiting considering how motherly and caring she was towards Draco and Estella!!
"I wasn't aware the Malfoys had another child," the Auror said, curiosity gleaming in his eyes.
Draco gulped nervously. How can he even answer this? He can't say anything truthful without incriminating his parents and admitting he's gone traitor. And Draco would rather drop dead than discuss the Dark Lord's perverted interest in him. Maybe he could just lie-
“Don't involve me in this conversation,” Hermione said.
After Blaise's laughter died down, he smiled at the two confused boys sitting across from him, "You
"I'm fine, Mione," Harry said, grabbing the girl's wrist and gently moving her hand away from his face. Harry then grabbed his glasses from the bedside table and placed them on his damp face. "Just a dream, that's all."
Hermione shook her head in exasperation, “No, Harry. Nobody knows that!”
"Malfoy, Draco."
"I was given the location by the Secret Keeper," Draco answered in a soft tone, trying not to distress his baby sister more.
Lucius rolled his eyes before lifting the paper from the table and returning his attention to the article on the front page. "I know. I just wanted to remind you of the trash you are sending our Draco to, that's all," he quipped, his voice muffled from behind the paper. Draco kept quiet during this exchange, knowing that his opinion truly didn't matter nor affected the outcome of where he would receive his education. His mother responded to his father but Draco didn't listen for his thoughts were elsewhere; he thought about the old woman from his dream. Draco thought about how strikingly similar she was, although he had never seen or met her before in his life. He thought about how poignant the moment was although Draco had no idea why it affected him so. He thought about her smile. He thought about her thin hair. He thought about the reeking smell of death that exuded from her. He thought about what she said,
“Okay, okay sorry. I just wanted to know.”
“Potter? Don’t tell me you’re just bringing me down here to hex me, I’m fairly certain the kitchens aren’t down here.” He asked with a pointed look.
The rows of fresh produce and baked goods were lovely, along with the Christmas decorations hanging from the ceiling, it made everything feel a little like a cozy haven for people to buy their groceries. It always smelled amazing down this aisle, the bread created a warmth that made Draco smile. Harry walked slowly down the aisle, allowing Draco to pick at the bakery made food. He bent down to examine the fruit, eyes scanning over the green apples and grabbing a bag of them. He moved along, he had a list to follow that Draco prepared in his neat writing, prohibiting Harry to write it with his chicken scratch. Harry didn’t mind though as Draco always put the list in order of what aisles they went to first and it made Harry’s job extremely easy. He picked up some carrots, celery, lettuce, and oranges. He checked his list and he noticed that Draco had scratched out strawberries so he looked around for them and picked out a box and hid it behind the lettuce. Smiling, he turned back around to see Draco carrying a bag of iced buns with a grin,
Across from him in the dimly lit room was Potter’s bed, a four poster with red linings. His side of the room was decorated vastly different to Draco’s.
Harry groaned, “Ugh I don’t know, I was just making an observation alright? You aren’t such a pointy git anymore.”
Potter rolled his eyes, “To get food.” He said it like it was obvious.
Draco’s eyes flickered to Potter to the elf, “Whe- Where’s the food?” He asked, stunned. Potter patted the elf's head gently and she ran away, after bowing to both Draco and Potter.
“How is he?” Hermione asked, sitting on the chair on the other side of the bed.
Harry shook his head slightly, “N-nothing,”
Christmas was just as magical as it was back when Draco was 11. He couldn’t lie to himself when he thought of his childhood, he knew he was spoiled and loved tremendously well by his Mother and Father. But now that he had grown up and moved on from Christmas at the Manor and now celebrated with another family, it wasn't any different. He had three amazing children and one loving husband which he cherished with his life. James, Scorpius and Lily were all sleeping currently, or at least he hoped they were. Three young children on Christmas Eve weren’t known for sleeping.
After four years of dating, Harry still hadn’t managed to tame Draco when it came to going grocery shopping. The pureblood wizard inside him was just too prominent, and to say the weekly shop was a struggle would be an understatement.
“I have no idea. But I’m definitely not hungry anymore.”
Potter picked up James and placed him on his shoulder, “Well, we are going to go down to the kitchen and get food and then bring it back up here and eat it.” He said matter-of-factly. Draco’s forehead creased,
Potter shrugged, “Probably more than I can count. I used to come here all the time when I was younger. Dobby would always be here and he’d give me some extra treacle tart.” A soft look came over Potter’s features when he mentioned Dobby. Draco knew what had happened to the elf, his Aunt Bellatrix had murdered him two years ago after he had saved Potter and his friends.
Potter put his hands up in defence and waited for Draco to get ready. Soon enough the two followed the stairs down to the common room, stepping over the creaky stairs and staying out of the moonlight. They checked that the room was clear before crossing and going out the portrait to the East Hallway.
“Draco, I’m sorry about sixth year. About what happened in the bathroom.”
Potter frowned and sat up, “What for?”
Harry shrugged, “He’s fine, Madam Pomfrey said that he should wake up in a few hours.” Ron sat next to Harry, still eating his muffin. Harry looked at Hermione, “Why are they here?” He whispered, nodding his head to the teachers who were talking quietly amongst themselves, occasionally shooting Harry looks.
“None of that just yet, we have gifts to wrap darling.” He said cheerfully, spinning on his heel and bending over to pick up the wrapping paper, purposefully angling himself so Harry got full view of his arse. When he turned back around he could feel the lust radiating off of Harry but he ignored it, grabbing Lily’s first present which was a small plush pink Pygmy Puff.
Draco pulled away from the kiss, pupils blown and lips swollen, “I want you Harry.” He said breathlessly.
He had brought in a desk from the Manor, it was a dark mahogany colour with a matching chair that sat to the right of his bed, under the window. The bed itself was green, of course, it had two silk green pillows at the head with two softer ones behind them. He had a small throw blanket at the end of his bed that he pulled up when it got too cold. He had curtains running around his bed too, a standard Hogwarts bed.
Draco grabbed the cup and took a swig. Harry watched closely, still clutching Draco’s arm. He watched as the smile slowly faded from Draco’s face and his eyes seemed to come back into focus. Slughorn seemed pleased and grabbed the cup back from Draco, moving back over to his bench. Harry stood in front of Draco,
Harry pressed on the acceleration once again and turned the right corner, heading towards the city centre where the supermarket they always went to was situated, “It’s alright, just please don’t make that man’s whiny voice reverberate around my head again. It was already annoying enough when it was at a regular volume.” Draco snickered and leaned on the window, watching a woman with a large dog struggle across the street and a young child drop their ice cream to the ground.
Yes. He was.
“Your scars. Do you have any? Besides the ones on your face.”
“You were, I’ll admit that. But from living with you for five months I’ve noticed that you aren’t that bad. You have your moments but you are my friend now Draco.” The name slipped past his lips without realising. Draco was shocked, he savoured in the sound of his name on Potter’s lips, it sounded foreign but . . . nice.
Photos of people that had died. Fred, Sirius, Remus and Tonks, Cedric. A small photo of Hedwig was on the wall next to a yellowing photo of ‘The Order Of The Phoenix’. Potter had pointed out his parents, Longbottom’s parents, and Sirius and Remus when he first put it on the wall noticing Draco’s confused stare.
Draco lifted his head slightly, watching the outline of Potter move on the bed.
“So you can help me Professor?”
Madam Pomfrey came by one last time and shooed them away, Harry hearing the mumbled voice of Ron say, “About time don’t you think? Finally that bitch is gone.” He could’ve sworn he heard Hermione’s slap but he was too focused on the boy in front of him. He seemed to be peaceful once again, his eyelids closed and his face devoid of stress. Harry brushed his platinum hair back and leaned forward to peck his forehead. As soon as his lips made contact his whole body seemed to light up, the feeling of finally being able to do this to his boy was wonderful. He sat back in his chair, watching as Draco moved around a bit before settling. Harry smiled lovingly and raised Draco’s hand and gave it a short kiss, just enough to send sparks flying through his body.
Harry shook his head, “What is going on here?” He asked. Two heads flicked to him, Draco’s eyes filling with relief, while the woman's eyes filled with disgust.
Draco’s tidiness was contrasted to Potter’s constant mess. The minimalistic approach Draco had was overpowered by Potter’s side that was filled with posters of Quidditch teams, a bloody armchair for crying out loud, paintings and photos were stuck to the wall all reminders of his earlier Hogwarts years. A photo of Ginevra, a group of students in what looked like a hall, all smiling and holding their wands up. A Weasley family photo with Potter and Granger stuck on the sides, looking very out of place with their dark hair and skin.
“To you, Headmaster. . .” Slughorn said quietly, looking very guilty. Snape was staring down at Draco, now holding the mead bottle when Harry heard an irritating voice get louder. Harry knew exactly who it was,
Harry grinned crookedly, “For my devilish good looks obviously.”
“It’s just,” he continued, “The moon . . . you’re glowing.”
“It doesn’t matter. I’ve tried to forget that, so if you wouldn’t mind let’s move on from this topic of conversation.” He tried to move to get off the bed but Harry grabbed his hand,
“Ah, good morning Mr Potter, you’re here early,” Madam Pomfrey said cheerfully. Harry jumped slightly and nodded silently. The mediwitch went to Draco’s right side, casting a few diagnostic charms quickly, “Well, Mr Malfoy seems to be recovering well and he should be awake in a few hours at the most, you’re welcome to stay too.” She smiled at him again and left him alone.
Draco stared at Harry, his eyes held so much truth, the corners of his mouth were slightly turned up in a soft smile. Draco’s eyes flickered to his lips again, noticing the way Harry’s breath hitched.
The only positive thing he had was watching Draco when he was away from Pansy. He seemed peaceful and happy. Most of the time Harry would catch him reading in one of the leather armchairs in the Slytherin common room, his hair loose and his knees tucked into his chest. The pain of knowing that he couldn’t have him was unbearable, and he had to stop himself from punching Pansy whenever he saw her in the halls.
“No, no, no, it’s a compliment. Like, I’m not kidding Draco. You look . . .” He paused. Draco noticed he was struggling to come up with a good word, his face twisted, “Okay, I’m just going to say this but don’t take it the wrong way. You look beautiful.”
He fell silent, the only sound was of Harry picking his nails anxiously. Draco allowed this time to think, what did Harry want from that? He was making an observation? What kind of fucking excuse was that? Draco didn’t know how Harry flirted, how did Ginevra ever fall for him, he would never know.
Harry lifted his eyes and stared at his wall in disgust. He could never see Ginny like that, she was like a sister to him. And he had his eyes on someone else anyway. He dropped the card back on to his duvet, turned around and found Draco back in his spot next to the window staring out into the Black Lake. He sighed, he needed to fix this,
Harry sat down and looked at Draco, “Care to explain Draco?” He left the keys out of the ignition and turned around in his seat facing the man.
“I’m not sure but I wouldn’t try it if I were you.”
However, right now it was the middle of winter, and it was freezing. The sky was covered in clouds and the wind carried a bite that could chill you to the bone. Draco had made Harry wait at the door before leaving because he had insisted that Harry was going to keel over and freeze to death,
Harry stood, “I could ask you the same thing.” He said haughtily. He looked at Professor McGonagall and almost shrunk under her gaze.
Draco frowned down at him, “Where the hell are we? How did I get here?”
The silence stretched on. The occasional yawn from Draco or Potter breaking the quiet. Draco kept looking over at the other boy, watching him breathe slowly through his nose and the crease in his forehead slowly disappear.
“Yes, because your personality is atrocious.”
That day had been one to remember. The look on Potter’s face was priceless once he stepped back, it was one Draco called, ‘holy shit Malfoy, emotionless, cold-hearted Malfoy, is actually capable of looking after another creature’. It was something he never stopped reminding Potter of even to this day.
It was ridiculous. And
“Just go ask for more, it shouldn’t be too hard. I’m sure they’ll help out a dying woman, which by the looks of it you’re close to it.” Draco looked the woman up and down, stopping on her face.
To begin with, the room was bare. Maybe a book here and there, even a spider in the corner- which Draco quickly killed- but otherwise it was empty. Cold too. Now five months later, the room looked exactly how Draco wanted it to. He had a rug under his bed, a plush emerald green rug to be exact. It stuck out into the middle of the room enough for him to be able to sit on it comfortably and study.
A full moon was torture to some, but beauty to others.
His voice rang out in the silence, jolting Draco away from his thoughts.
“Is that supposed to be a compliment? Or are you just taking the mickey out of my pale skin?”
“Are you sure they’re asleep love? I don’t want them coming down here and ruining their own surprises.” He asked. His husband looked up from his tea, green eyes sparkling with amusement and black hair flopping forward,
“Draco, I-” he hesitantly lifted a hand, looking at Draco’s eyes for confirmation. Draco nodded and Harry placed his finger lightly on Draco’s biggest scar, the one that ran around his heart and followed his collarbone. Harry seemed to take his time, tracing the thin lines of skin with his index finger leaving goosebumps in his wake. He avoided the one on Draco’s neck and the one on his stomach.
"I went to that corridor where the three headed dog is, I think, and Snape came out of there and gave me detention for being out of bed."
“I’m surprised Harry didn’t come down when I used his contraption,” she remarked, deciding to take full advantage of the rare tête-à-tête to find out what Draco's thoughts regarding their newest member of the household.
There had been just the curl of a smile on Malfoy's face at that proclamation, and he assured Harry that not only did he take care of his important equipment, but he no longer 'stole' apprentices.
"Now that we're all present, I would like to thank each of you personally for being here. As I'm sure you're all aware, the Ministry alone is insufficient in defeating Voldemort. That is why we have come together, Purebloods, Halfbloods, Muggleborns, Squibs," Dumbledore nods at various people around the room, "to defeat him. Everyone should have already received their assignments, but if there are any questions, please let me know. Now, I believe Daedalus would like to take a group photo for posterity."
“Why don’t you have your cauldron over by the hearth?” Harry asked. “Doesn’t it have to go over the fire?”
His first thought is that this is a party -someone's birthday or wedding or some holiday- but as he listens to the witch and wizards nearest to him, he realises it's definitely not.
Harry pops into existence in the middle of what looks like a Potions class. He's not in any immediate danger so he takes stock of himself quickly: still under the invisibility cloak, which he's holding from the inside just in case, he's wearing both shoes, his belt is still on, he can still see clearly, and his wand is in his right hand. He takes a silent deep breath and grins. He's not sure what he's done differently this time but it's all gone as planned for the first time!
