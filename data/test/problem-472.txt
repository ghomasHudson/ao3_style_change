-Stepping back, Harry sees the small black velvet box in Draco's hand. Draco leads him to sit on the fountain wall and kneels in front of him. The box opens ... the music finishes.
He’d been roped into spending a few hours with Neville the other day, and although he liked the man, he could only process so much information regarding plants. Draco talked about things he could relate to: flying, being judged by the media, teaching now of course, and the effects of the war to some degree. Harry also enjoyed the teasing between them, yet they seemed to be able to hold mature conversation. They also had a history together that included saving each other’s lives, and Harry was sure that Draco needed a friend just as much as he wanted someone to talk to that wasn’t a child or over sixty. Yes, Neville was great, but he needed topics other than what Hellebore plants could do, or what Hannah was going though now she was pregnant. He needed more interesting or challenging topics, and Tau still hadn’t replied either.
Harry hand to drag himself away from his thoughts and focus on something else; he still found it hard to think of those lost in the wars that Voldemort had caused. He looked at the magical parchment instead, and was fairly surprised at his building anxious feelings - impatient for a reply from Tau. He wasn't a teenager with a stupid crush, so he shook his head and decided to continue grading the essays of his students - reminding himself that he was in fact, a thirty-year-old adult with a job.
“I hope you have better coffee for Saturday.” Draco shouted so he could hear him. “That last brand was mediocre. I suggest Odgen’s Olde fire whiskey.”
So, this obviously wasn’t the first time Poppy had informed him of his illness, but he didn’t remember that … in fact he didn’t even remember how he’d gotten to the hospital wing in the first place. Losing one’s memory, was never a comforting thought, but perhaps his brain fog would abate once he’d had time to wake up properly.
“It’s to be expected. Now drink this one as well, it will help with the pain.” Poppy said, shoving another vial into his hand. “It’s good to have you back.” She admitted. “Ah, Harry! Right on time. He’s free to go.”
Draco hadn’t expected Harry to give him anything, what with the huge number of people he already had to buy gifts for. He was immensely curious to what his ex-rival would have gotten an ex-death eater, teacher of Hogwarts like himself. He didn’t feel deserving of anything to be honest, not after he’d basically rejected Harry’s obvious interest in him, and then been slightly avoidant of the man’s company these last two days... and of course, the way he had behaved towards the golden boy during their school years. He wouldn’t deny that he had missed Harry’s company though, at least not to himself, not now they had developed a rather wonderful companionship. The gift was unexpected, but it meant something he hadn’t concluded on yet, and it made him feel light and fuzzy that Harry had brought something for him.
Harry chuckled. If he ever met this man, he was taking him to a chocolate factory. There was a magical one at Dartmoor national park that he had heard about, hidden from muggles.
“What’s going on?” Madam Pomfrey asked, not waiting for an answer when she saw the blood on Draco’s left arm. She instantly rushed away to fetch the healing salve and a bandage.
One of the house elves had left some honey and cinnamon while Poppy had been treating Draco’s arm. Harry used it to start up a conversation.
Draco hastily grabbed the now filled box, and he quickly proceeded to return it to the small box room where the students essays and homework was stored. “Yes, I’m fine Potter,” he called from the small room, “I’ll get some parchment and we can discuss those plans.”
“Did you… your gift Potter.” Fuck, he had stutter, Draco swore internally, but now that he’d realised that Harry hadn’t asked or said anything out his own gift, he worried that Harry hadn’t appreciated it. It had been a risky move on his part.
Draco was wrestling with his himself however. Avoidance, the best way to avoid pain, and yet… his desires were like the fog in a bathroom mirror – its existence was so frustrating, but how it incites him to wipe said mirror so that he may see clearly. The harbinger had come knocking, gifting him the basket of such perfect impossibility… the forbidden fruit that he now craved. Like Midas, his touch was a curse, he knew this, and yet, if he dared touch such divinity it would rot away to nothing… but the sweet siren’s call was harder to refuse when it was only a foot away from him.
-Draco allows Harry to hold him as his tears fall. Overwhelmed, he remembers a part of himself that he though long gone - his innocence, his soul.
Draco chuckled as he stood. “Live in fear or hand out homework?” Draco asked, but he had a feeling that Harry’s sudden desire to leave was because he’d chosen Padfoot. He was sure that Harry had been trying to allude that he had feelings for him, and if that was the case, he’d rejected the man.
When Draco emerged from the bathroom, Harry was standing there waiting for him. Draco had red tired eyes that he recognized - he'd had those eyes himself many times, along with the same expression Draco was trying to hide.
He sat back in the armchair, pulling it a little closer to bed, and watched as Draco finally drifted back off to sleep. Ill or not, the man was still handsome, perfect, and someone he desired fervently with his body, mind, and soul. Right now, however… Harry was just worried about him. He sighed - trust Draco to catch the Snowflu!
Harry leaves his therapy session - Tuesday the 1st December at 4pm, and gets intercepted by Draco on the way out.
As Harry washed his hands in the bathroom sink, he continued to think about the mess he had landed himself in. It had become so difficult writing to Tau as Padfoot, knowing that Draco had rejected him as Harry, but that he was grasping so tightly to his illusion of Padfoot… an illusion that he – Harry, was soon to destroy… and perhaps, along with their friendship too.
“I’m sure she’d have found a way to contact us had she needed to. Still, I think I’ll avoid her for a few days to be sure.” Draco said, brushing himself down.
“I’m okay now. Thank-you for your help Mr Potter.” Samuel nodded and went to get back onto his feet to leave, but Harry gestured for him to stop and to remain seated.
“I suggest…” Harry stared, trying not to blush with all the attention now on him. Quickly climbing up onto the nearest chair. “…That all the Slytherins move to that wall…” Harry pointed, and used a spell to send green sparks in the correct direction. “…That the Gryffindors move to that one…” Pointing again, but with red sparks this time. “…Ravenclaws to the wall where the teachers table would be normally be...” Pointing with blue sparks. “… And the Hufflepuffs will gather in the middle.” Harry finished, showering yellow sparks over the centre of the great Hall.
Draco nodded and looked to be contemplating his next question before he asked it. “Would you be comfortable sharing the trigger of your episode that day, with me? I don’t remember mentioning the war.”
When he looked back at Draco however, he smiled; Draco’s nose was exaggeratedly wrinkled in disgust, and he realised then, that it was avoidance for prides sake. Draco had agreed that they would have each other’s back, but he wouldn’t admit that out loud. The random attack on his dinning room décor, was Draco’s way of avoiding an otherwise awkward and sentimental conversation –- in fact, that was something Tau would do
Harry’s smile widened, wondering what Tau’s reaction to his choice of ‘making it up to him’ would be.
Draco: "Because I was scared Potter. I'm not anymore though. I want to be honest with you, I want you to give me chance."
“I’d like that. Will you be okay getting back? It a long way down to the dungeons.” Harry frowned slightly as Draco wobbled.
Blond haired twenty-nine-year-old man with blue eyes, half- blood, with a passion for family, friends, and fun. His life goal was similar to Harry's, but he also wanted to make a different to people that struggled financially. His quote was – 'Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.'
He would just have to keep denying his feelings though; he was no good for Harry fucking Potter, and he didn't know how to love anymore - maybe he never did. He was selfish, focused on self-preservation, and after so many people had shit on his trust - betrayed his loyalty to them, he just couldn't be relationship materiel.
Now he was thinking about time itself. What exactly was time? Who came up with the idea to label it? Was time even real?
He put his mug of half-finished hot chocolate down on his bed side table and sighed, before reaching into his draw for that familiar magical parchment and quill. He wouldn’t expect Tau to respond this late, but writing was much better than letting his guilt twist and fester – he needed the distraction; his mind was trying to dig up old guilt at the lives that had been lost because Voldemort wanted
Draco snorted. “You do realise that Dracula is muggle nonsense right. Vlad III Dracula - Prince of Wallachia in the 15
Harry fixed his bottle green bow tie into place, it matched the interior of his black robes. His white shirt fitted and tucked into black trouser. Ron was dressed identical, but he had chosen red as his colour of choice. Ron patted his shoulder before they left to get their partners.
Without looking up, Draco voiced his fears. “I can’t – I can’t face her. I can’t look at her and see the terror in her eyes or the – I just couldn’t-” Fear of crying, of showing his weakness, halted his words. Harry saw a single tear fall from Draco’s bowed head, and it landed with a plop into the coffee mug. “I though I could- I thought-” Draco got up from the table to leave the room, but Harry was faster.
Draco: "Please don't *Draco shuddered at the memory* I'll stick to Potter. If I feel so inclined to do so, am I to assume you wouldn't be opposed to Harry?"
“That’s no excuse!” Draco shouted, his eyes polling with unshed tears. “I should have- I should have-”
Harry: "You know what Malfoy? I tried. Ron and Hermione are right - You're not worth it. I don't know why I bothered! I'm done!''
, and he would be lying if said he wasn’t crushing over the illusion he was creating of this man. It
“Draco.” He greeted in mild surprise once he’d opened the door. His stomach seemed to squirm, but he firmly ignored it and gestured for the blond man to come inside. “Coffee?”
Draco took a moment to collect himself, and took a deep breath before re-emerging into the main room.
They both blinked when the music stopped, taking in the small rose coloured booth - against white wood paneling, in which they both sat opposite each other - Harry with a standard white tea in front of him. When reality came up and snapped Harry over the head, he quickly looked at his watch. He sighed in relief, and while he started talking to Draco again, he tinkered with it - winding it up so it wouldn't stop ticking.
Harry put down his glass, deciding anything would be better than sitting their staring, and went to the food table. He filled his plate with mini sausage rolls, chicken nuggets, and some stuffed vol-au-vents. He didn’t notice Draco behind him until the man spoke.
“You were forced to take that mark Draco! Tom placed it on people for two reasons; as a sign of their sick and twisted loyalty to him, or too remind them - through fear, that they belong to him. If I suddenly marked you, forced you through fear and threats to set fire to the school, it doesn’t make you an arsonist! You never wanted this, and it’s your choices that make you a Death Eater or not, not some fucked up tattoo. Don’t you understand that?”
Draco flicked his wand, casting a drying charm over Harry’s clothes before he developed hypothermia, and followed it up with a heating charm.
"It's okay Mr Potter!" Malaise assured him quickly, picking up on his uncertainty and slight panic. "I will write down that you do not mind blood status, but that you would like to avoid magical creature blood for now. You can change your mind at any time, and do not feel bad. I am heterosexual, so I wouldn't want to date a woman, but that doesn't mean I dislike woman or have anything against them. I still have many female friends and acquaintances. You understand?"
you do, do not take away the goodness that I know is in here.” Harry placed his palm on Draco’s chest.
“I can imagine!” Draco wrinkled his nose, glad that the Slytherins had more poise. He contained his humour though – it was slightly funny but Harry looked stressed enough.
Draco watched as Harry flipped through a catalogue, chose what he wanted, and went to the queue to pay. Draco couldn't contain his curiosity, he lingered by the catalogues and scanned through all the goods for sale with a bemused interested; Televisions, cameras, phones, headphones, microwaves, vacuum cleaners, fridge freezers, toasters, mixers, blenders, bedding, furniture, lighting, tableware… and then some. He knew what bedding and furniture and tableware was, but… a toilet seat that had multicoloured lights? Wonders never ceased!
“I think you should hold your tongue Elroy! Can I call you that? Elroy.” Harry didn’t give the Auror a chance to respond, patting the man’s chest twice before continuing. “I’m sure you didn’t mean to break code forty-six of the Aurors conduct. I’m sure there’s no need for me to contact Dale with some pensive memories now is there?”
Draco did follow Harry, but he should have left – should have disapparated back to Hogsmeade, but Harry was becoming a flame to which he was the moth. Harry had disclosed his sexuality to him, and that meant something. He sighed and followed the black-haired prat.
Draco followed Harry, the question regarding solar lightning forgotten, and he watched as Harry browsed the books. He wanted to ask Harry about the elevator, ask him why he didn't take the stairs and instead choose to put himself in an uncomfortable position, but he didn't feel right about asking him here – it wasn't the time or place.
“Sit down then Potter.” Draco nodded to the black leather, camel back sofa. Harry did, taking his coffee with a grateful smile.
Harry was in a foul mood already that morning: It would have been Professor Severus Snape's 39th birthday today, yet McGonagall refused to do anything to honor his bravery - she though that too many students didn't know the truth, and therefore, it would be a disaster. Then a sixth year Hufflepuff had used a hex to make Draco's hair turn into antlers, and Harry's turn white-blond. It might have been funny if they hadn't used the stinging jinx on Draco too, causing him severe pain and swelling.
Throwing himself backward on to the bed, he just heard that loud 'POP!' as the radio appeared. Saturday 19th December 1998.
“Are you not going to open the others?” Draco asked. He’d watched as Harry opened the letters, and only one of the Christmas gifts that turned out be a rather nice, knitted green jumper. Harry had slipped into the jumper immediately, abandoned the other presents, and asked it they should get going to the Great Hall then.
“You never cease to amaze me Potter. I must admit, I am curious now. How bad was this place? Surely it couldn’t have been that bad, having belonged to my mother’s family and all.”
Shaking his head in mock disgust, Draco felt a pang of longing for the man opposite him, a deep-rooted want, a strong desire to have… … Oh, that would not do! He blanched. How was this possible? He could
The three of them continued to walk to the library to study. It was the first week of school -currently their first Saturday, and they already had homework due for Monday.
of December, and she had been informed that, if Silas attempted to harm another person – be it a student or a teacher – he would be expelled and the Aurors
-Hands roaming, pulling, feeling until ... they search blindly, but urgently for each other's trouser button. Harry sucking Draco's neck, his collar bone - working his way down, down, down .... jackpot.
As Poppy handed him the vial, he recognised it as a mild pain reducing draught and assumed that it was to reduce the stinging that he was suffering in his extremities. He downed the potion quickly, relieved when his symptoms started to alleviate… but they didn’t go away completely.
“The journal,” Harry pointed to it, “it is made by muggles, but I managed to get an everlasting spell added… the pages will never run out. It’s also protected from damage: dirty, dust, wear and tear, water… even most potions. If you choose to do so, a single drop of your own blood on the clasp, will make it unopenable to anyone but you.” Harry gave a small, hopeful smile.
-One 6th year Ravenclaw lifts his wand, Harry disarms him - catching his wand, then freezes his friends with one spell.
That evening, Harry was situated on his bed like every evening; a cup of coffee on the bedside table, and the magical parchment in front of him. He wasn’t yet ready for bed, but he was winding down for the day.
“I was just so embarrassed Mr Potter. I didn’t know what they had done and I wondered how long I would be stuck that way. I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction either.” Samuel shook his head, disappointed in himself for falling for their prank.
Draco looked around the room before replying. “Mmm. Oh, sorry Potter. I was just wondering who decorated this hideous dining room!”
“Damn you Potter!” Draco complained, shaking his head as he quickly regained his ‘Malfoy’ composure. “How on earth do I remind you of him?”
“You could, yes… but you don’t. Your avoidance tells me that much.” Harry smirked. “Unless you’re embarrassed because you have sweet pen names like, Buba coo, Pumpkin, or Honey comb.”
“Calming draught.” Draco confirmed before rushing back to him. “It won’t be as affective with the whisky you know.”
Harry blinked and realised that yes, actually, now that she mentioned it, he did feel much better - much more himself. Malaise seem a little less eccentric and unlikely to jump him at any second now that they were away from the reception room. She was still in strange clothes, but she was not unpleasant to look at, and her dress did match the going theme. It was almost like he had been hyper-sensitive and aroused, but at least he could blame the flowers - apparently.
“Very well!” Minerva finally decided, much to Draco’s horror. “I’ll arrange for it to be done on the first Friday of the new term – Friday the seventh of January, after dinner, seven-thirty.” She turned to Draco. “Have Mr Silas Avery come with you to my office then.” She then turned back to Harry. “I do hope you know what you are doing Harry.”
Draco watched as Harry felt his own black hair in surprise, he watched as the raven-haired man smirked knowingly at him. Yes, he had used a wandless spell on Harry’s hair to clean and flatten it. It wasn’t perfect, Harry’s hair would never be perfect, but it looked less like a used bird’s nest and more like a newly created one – it was bloody good spell work if he didn’t say so himself.
Draco nodded that he was okay watching. Ron mumbled something totally incoherent, but it sounded like a compliant. Harry and Hermione laughed.
“Potter! Come on Harry, calm down. Let me help you to the couch at least.” Draco coaxed, but Harry was a dead weight. He wouldn’t move, and he was gasping for breath.
His mind decided then, that it wanted to paint and wander as he rested his tired eyes. It painted long, thick buttery-blond hair this time, framing a warm smiling face, and laying on the pillows next to him on the bed. Two dark, passionate grey eyes stared up into his own emerald green ones. They were filled with a tender kindness, yet there were murky shadows of the past that sat behind the plea to be seen – his soul bared open and raw, begging not to judged or held in a forever frozen trial of convictions.
“It’s fine Potter,” Draco said, but Harry instantly recognising the defensive tone. “I shouldn’t have been so bold. My mistake, I’ll just-”
Harry froze in his tracks, tears in his eyes that he held back, body stiff. He really didn't need Draco's moods swings in his life, or his abrupt personality changes if he wouldn't even talk to him about what was wrong. He had shit to deal with himself, let alone trying to help someone that was an arse and wouldn't be helped. He had hoped it would have worked out though, he had such strong feelings for the blond that hurt.
Harry noticed the foot returning to its normal colour as he slid the sock onto it, and after placing one onto the other foot, he added a heating charm to them before returning the blanket.
Draco froze, his steps halted, and he turned to gauge Harry’s words. He was looking at Harry curiously before his mask returned and he said, “I always said you were mad Potter –– Harry.” Then Draco continued to walk.
The students were mesmerised, excited, and they viewed this as a very rare and awesome treat. They were so glad that they had stayed for Christmas, and that they had opted to play outside this evening – no one would believe them when the other students returned, when they got to share the recount of events with their other friends.
Before Hermione or Ron could point out he still had twenty mins, he left the compartment. He was too desperate to see Draco agian, and he needed him to forget the images of death.
“Huh! I guess I never thought about it. So, you only agreed to get a drink with me because you had to visit Ceridwen’s?” Harry asked, a sense of feigned disappointment on his features.
Harry knocked on the door to Draco’s personal rooms, shifted on his feet nervously and tried to control his nerves as he rocked on the balls of his feet.
They made there was to the door, exited into the cold corridor, and made their way to the Great Hall together.
Draco suddenly fled the bed, curious and wanting to find out exactly what the golden trio were arguing about. Sure enough, the golden trio were in a semi heated discussion. It appeared they were trying to argue in whispers, but failing epically. Draco stayed hidden, his door open ajar as he peered into the common room to listen. Blaise tried to get in on the spying, but he failed when Draco elbowed him hard.
Harry snorted. “Is that so?” He asked, wondering why the book never mentioned the fluctuation of moods and the changes in behaviour: Draco went from tired, sleepy, and hazy, to scared, loud, and childish… and the childlike behaviour ranged in ages from young child to moody teenager.
The week flew by in a flurry of classes, grading, and normal day-to-day stuff. He corresponded with Tau as if nothing had changed, waiting for his chance to find that irrevocable and undeniable proof of his identity as Draco. Now that he’d already made the connection however, it was easy to see Tau and Draco as one person – when he wrote to Tau, he already saw Draco as the recipient.
Draco: "I haven't said anything yet! I certainly don't need some loony old woman telling me what I need or don't need. I'm perfectly sane thank-you very much."
Harry smiled, relieved that Draco hadn’t shouted at him, but where was Draco’s sense of self-admiration or sarcastic retorts? He’d agreed with Harry that he had likable qualities – or else he would have denied his comment, but was it about Draco’s opportunity to playfully insult him, or was it insecurity that prevented the blond from being arrogant and confident about his self-worth. Harry would have expected Draco to pick apart his ‘some’ and insist he had more them
Tau was the same age as him, so he would have been seventeen or eighteen during the battle of Hogwarts. Not old enough to really be a death eater, but his family could have been. A lot of pure-blood families were back then. He didn’t even know if Tau lived in Britain during the war, but it was also possible that his friends or family were in association with dark magic. It just seemed to much of a coincidence for Tau’s past to not have something to do with Voldemort, whether directly or indirectly. It affected everyone after all.
-Draco falls against a tree, falling down it until he is sitting in the snow. Red eyed and tired, with his head in is hands.
Harry blinked, he remembered to smile and nod politely, but he forgot how to use his voice. Either his ears were failing him or she sounded far away and airy. He was still shocked at her creepily cheery mannerism however, her strange appearance, wide dark-blue eyes that never blinked, and her big white teeth that beamed at him framed by her far too happy smile.
“Kreacher. I would appreciate it very much if you could get Mr Malfoy safely to his rooms. I fear we drank too much fire whiskey.” Harry explained. Kreacher bowed again, muttering nonsense, and then he walked over to take Draco’s wrist. Harry had fears of Draco falling down the stairs – moving stairs at that.
“I think we’re going to need another bottle of whiskey please.” Harry asked, smiling at Draco when Kreacher bowed again and left. “You still up for going shopping with me tomorrow?” Harry asked.
Draco ripped his arm away, sneering at Harry. Harry was surprised that he recognized the hurt in Draco's beautiful silver eyes. Then he was shocked at how he found himself caring about Draco's emotions.
Draco had been brought into the infirmary Sunday evening; it was now Tuesday morning. Harry had visited the man for hours yesterday, but Madam Pomfrey had given him a sleeping draught in the end because the man kept hallucinating and panicking – the calming draughts hadn’t helped either, and Draco kept getting out of bed. When he hadn’t been panicking, he had been complaining; Draco kept threatening to report them both to his father, and although Harry had chuckled, Madam Pomfrey was at the end of her tether – especially with the fluctuation of Draco’s acting age.
Harry nodded, taking the offered hand, and letting Draco pull him back up on to his frozen, numb feet. The warming charm would take a while to get his body temperature back up – he could probably do with a warm shower too. Their hands held for longer than necessary – a couple of seconds maybe, and before they moved away to get their respective students back to their dormitories, their eyes met… and for a moment they just stared at each other. Their breath clouded between them as they breathed, the fire so hot in its unspoken desire… but Draco just nodded and strolled away.
I'm very pleased you wrote actually; it was a pleasant surprise and one I was not expecting. I am using my time here at Hogwarts to go over everything we have learnt so far this year, trying to remember those hazier areas of memory I have - thanks to a certain musical problem we have been subjected to. I spoke with Professor McGonagall today and she has come up empty to our predicament, and I wonder if she even bothered to be honest.
Headmistress McGonagall: "Mr Finnigan! Lower your wand immediately, then escort yourself to my office. I will be with you shortly."
Draco couldn't help but smile as he watched Harry; the 'golden boy' rocked on the balls of his feet, smiling happily back at him before browsing the store with his glamoured brown eyes as they waited. His feelings … what were they? Festive contagions simply snaring him up into the wave of sentimentality? A growing fondness? Affection? Endearment? Salazar! He couldn't afford to fall for Potter! No, he could never be with the man that England loved and worshiped and he had Padfoot regardless. He would just have to be aware, deny and refuse to let his feeling grow deeper then that of friendship, and focus on his smitten feelings for Padfoot.
Flashes – lights – and then he was gone… sinking back through the veil behind him, his eyes widened in shock as he fell.
“For all he hated me, he wasn’t happy when he realised that I had to die. I don’t think he did hate me though - not really. He hated the fact that half of me came from James, yes, and he expected me to act like my father, but he couldn’t completely avoid the half that was my mother. I also think that a lot of it was a cover. He had to show me a great dislike because he knew that Snake-face would return at some point. If dear old Tom looked into Severus’s mind, well, it had to be believable.”
Harry went to stand and talk to Draco, but the blond man just shook his head. Harry remained seated, watching as the other students hurried to leave the classroom – only a few of them even said – “Good bye Mr Malfoy.” The anticipation of what Draco would do now was making him uncomfortable for some unknown reason, he felt out of place, but he was curious about the blonde’s student teacher relationship and how he would deal with Mr Silas Avery. It appeared that the students held apprehension in regards to their potions teacher, much like they had done when professor Snape had been their potions teacher in 1991. Harry never feared Severus Snape – he was used to being treated unfairly by the Dursleys, but the man was an arsehole … yes, that about summed it up – a great man, a hero, but an arsehole!
"…ry, Harry?" Draco knew that Harry was in one of his mind hazy episodes, but it worried him. What had trigger it this time? Was he just remembering having his leg sewed up? Could it be that 'stitches' were, despite what Harry said, just as horrible as he assumed?
“Yeah, that might be a good idea actually. I’ll talk to Neville tomorrow.” Harry agreed, thinking about Miss Payne’s behaviour so far.
It was true, Hogwarts had reached the lowest population of children until now. Too many families had lost loved ones, children, and friends. People didn't want to get pregnant while Voldemort was still a threat, and a lot of people had even fled the country.
Harry: "You never get used to them. I always wake up in some state or another, twenty minutes later, a tea in my hand, and I'm usually okay. Sometime it takes longer, it depends on the dream really, on how ... dark it is I suppose, or how realistic."
Draco gulped his tea down, holding it so tight like he thought it would be stolen from him if he didn't, like it was all he had - his hands shaking. Harry rose from his chair, cup clinked down on the table, and he hugged him. Draco sobbed, eventually putting down his cup and standing to hug Harry.
Harry: "Thank you for saving my eyes. *He batted his eyelashes* Wouldn't want to take away your favorite part of me now would we?
The train whistled loudly as a wand came speeding out of the storage carriage window, Draco couldn’t believe that it actually worked – wandlessly too, and more importantly, he couldn’t believe that Harry had actually done that. The train then started to leave the station, picking up speed until it was speeding its way towards London.
It was a mantra that he couldn’t shake as he waiting for Draco to open the door, but he had to remember that he was here for a reason. He was ready to uncover the irrefutable truth if he could.
Harry thought. He partially believed that, as interesting and anonymous as this was, it most likely wouldn't result in anything more than correspondence with a few creepy guys. They could literally write nothing but lies to him. Another part of himself however, was immensely curious.
Draco used the jinx to make the leaves on the evergreen tree attack Harry. Spells went back and forth, both young men angry and determined to prove they would not be beaten in a duel. Soon enough though, they were gathering a small crowd. It wasn't long before an angry McGonagall escorted them to the infirmary.
“Potty! You’s a wonder’ull man!” Draco slurred, a slight shiver to his strained voice. He sounded congested, and his literally ice-cold breath made Harry shiver as it blew against his cheek … it took Harry a moment however, to realise that Draco’s breath really was
Draco mumbled, he'd been doing that on and off - mumbling about his past before Hogwarts, before Voldemort. Harry let him, listening as best he could.
“You always go out with your buttons in the wrong holes.” Draco pulled at Harry’s shirt. “Your hair looks like a bird’s nest – a worse bird’s nest then it usually does anyway.” Draco wrinkled his nose at Harry’s hair before looking down at him again. “And your robe is a wrinkled mess. Not to mention that you have odd socks on and your tie is still untied.”
-Draco talking to Pansy and Blaise. Bows his head miserably, falling to sit on his bed looking crestfallen.
Harry muttered softly as he came up behind Draco in the bathroom - who had been holding onto the sink sobbing. All the food of Draco's body lifted gently like being sucked away into thin air. Andromeda taught him that spell over the summer - to clean spilt milk of Teddy's clothes. Draco jumped, embarrassed to be seen this way, and not expecting Harry.
“Take her to the hospital wing…” Said Harry - firmly, as he bent down beside Headmistress McGonagall. A lump of familiar guilt was twisting in his gut. “I’ll sort everything out here with Professor Flitwick and meet you there.”
A light shift of the broom and Harry looped, twisted, and suddenly he was flying back to Hogwarts. He’d had a peaceful, relaxing flight - the summer heat made blissful by the cool breeze that his speed created - and he now felt ready to tackle more of his tedious planning.
“Nope. Flying relaxes my mind actually. All the planning we had to do fried my brain. I needed the fresh air and a break. Besides, that’s not … what I mean by active mind is … when I’m casting spells for example. Watching the students battling keeps my mind active and sharp.” Harry explained.
“Okay,” Draco whispered breathlessly from inside the magical fort, “this is our last chance to gain team members for our side again. Are you sure you both know the spell?” Draco really didn’t want to lose to bloody Potter! He’d quickly helped the girls brush up on a spell they’d already learnt from home, and he was thankful that Potter had gotten so complacent and cocky in his winning streak that he’d left them be long enough to plan their next move.
Harry didn't leave at first, he gave Draco this weird look that made the blond gulp. Ginny huffed, and then tugged at Harry's arm until he started to walk away with her.
Harry: "Maybe I should've been more patient, but it's crazy Draco. I can't keep waiting for you to shut down on me, worrying if what I say will set you off again, or wondering if we really can work together as couple. I have my own issues too. I can't deal with all of this on and off, this were happy together and then we're arguing. I do want to be with you Draco, but not if you're going to shut down, take it out on me, and then storm off with an attitude every time something is wrong. Iv'e been fighting my whole life - I'm tired of fighting."
Draco nodded, taking an eager swig from his glass of whisky, but he looked a right mess. Despite the burning curiosity that now blazed in those coin-grey eyes of his, and the expectation that he – Harry, would now disclose deep dark secrets, Draco’s eyes were red; tear streaks marred his perfect pale skin where he refused to use his clothes to wipe his face, and loud sniffs broke the silence every few second.
“I just don’t have a big appetite, its not like I’m underweight or anything.” Harry chuckled rolling his eyes.
Tau-Draco had taken the bait, and Harry couldn’t stop laughing enough to form his reply. The question wasn’t as direct as outright asking if he was a squib, but Harry knew why Draco had asked the question and that was what had caused his mirth.
“I will inform My Avery of his new schedule when he arrives tomorrow evening.” Draco concluded their ‘meeting’, handing a copy of the plan to Harry as he stood up.
Draco had meant his remark as a tease, but there was truth to it that he would never admit. Unfortunately for them, It was then the radio in Draco's hand gave of an unusual golden energy, growing with every second. Draco dropped it with slight squeak, Harry chuckling despite his caution, and then ... the glow radiated out with a loud pop.
Harry wondered why Draco was following him back to his rooms, or escorting him back. Something had changed since their failed trip to the Three Broomsticks at the begging of the week, but Harry wasn’t complaining. Draco had started looking out for him during meal times, and he’d even turned up at his door with a plate of food when he’d missed dinner on Wednesday. Draco smiled at him when they passed each other in the hallways, and the man seemed happier to be in his company. Draco had almost become his shadow. The surprising thing about it though, was that it felt right. Draco Malfoy … by his side … felt right!
“I saw the journal in a muggle store. I knew you were named after the Draconis constellation, and the Dragon just… yeah.” Harry rubbed at the back of his neck.
Ron: "Come of it mate, we all know how much you've been staring at him for the past two weeks. It's sickening actually, and Ginny's still pissed at you."
“Swotty!” Madam Pomfrey called for one of the house elves that were familiar with her requirements. “Breakfast for Mr Malfoy please Swotty, no Lupine. A level two FGI should suffice.”
“Mathews?” Harry asked, knowing if any of his student were so reckless it would be Benjamin Matthews.
Harry huffed and threw it down, stuffing dry toast into his mouth, and gulping down his drink. He ignored everyone, even his two best friends. His blood was boiling, he didn't want to read a fucking news article that slated and accused Draco. They didn't fucking know Draco.
Harry nodded - just going along with what Malaise said, but he wondered if he was being unfair to wizards with creature blood. He would date a wizard with lycanthropy, or one that had Veela blood for example - if they were the right man for him of course, but he didn't know about the others. Part giants put him in mind of Hagrid, and he shivered at the thought. Part goblin made him think of Professor Filius Flitwick, and he honestly wasn't sure how he would feel about the height difference. There were many other magical creatures that he had addressed in his life, and he had nothing against them at all, they were just like everyone else but -
Chaos! That’s what Harry would call it. His Gryffindor students were a force to be reckoned with that late morning. Students missing, students forgetting things, students pranking others and more interesting in chatting then packing. It was a miracle that they all made it to Hogsmeade in time to board the bloody train.
spell wandlessly and not others. Does say a lot about your pompous dressing sense however.” Harry smirked.
The rest of their time at Diagon Alley Blossomed. Harry caught Draco gushing over a tiny Owl he could hold in the palm of his hand - Grey with almost marbled white and brown ruffled feathers, but Draco refused to admit he would ever gush. Harry didn't miss the sad longing that whipped through his silver eyes as they left the store with Harry's owl food, even the darn owl hooted sadly.
Harry knew that the next big story was a reporter’s means to put food on their table, and to provide for their family - it was a race to be the first in gaining such news worth information or risk losing their job, but Harry refused to allow this man to use Draco’s past as wages.
Harry then stomps away - leaving Draco behind him, and the radio decided to make another appearance. Saturday the 24th October 1998.
’ Harry though, coughing once as he looked away. People always said he had some shocking green ones, but he didn’t think his were anything special.
Eventually they left the vault, but Draco was extremely quiet the entire way back. He couldn't understand how Harry had so much money - so much stuff, and seeing it reminded him of his situation. It burnt Draco's ego and pride - threatened it, and suddenly he felt vulnerable. By the time they got outside, Harry wanted to know what wrong.
Harry waited for well over an hour for a reply, but non came. His eyes were growing heavy, and he knew that he would fall asleep shortly.
“You won’t get front row seats if you end up in the infirmary.” Said Harry, as he helped himself to the Halloween punch now that he’d finished his checks.
Harry stopped Draco leaving and hugged the man to his chest – to hell with masculine or pureblood expectations. “It’s okay.” Harry patted his back, holding him closer than was probably necessary. “Draco, whatever you say here, stays here alright. Besides, you have blackmail over me now you know.”
Draco thought about it, studying Harry's features for a moment - making Harry feel like he was being scrutinized ... he probably was.
“Come with me.” Harry gently ordered when the sobbing continued. “You don’t want to be seen like this; I know I wouldn’t.”
“I’m going! I just had a rough night.” Harry admitted, putting his empty mugs into the sink and disappearing into his bedroom.
"Draco!" Harry called to him, catching him in the door way and grabbing his wrist to turn him around. "Why don't you eat here, I'll get Kreacher to–"
Those metal doors opened of their own, making Draco jump. Harry walked inside the strange metal box… did he expect him to follow?
Harry sighed again, but he gave in realising that Draco was right. I would come across as ungrateful if he had to admit that he hadn’t bothered to open his gifts yet. Minerva had gifted him Scottish shortbread biscuits: Hagrid’s, was a book on magical creatures and how they assisted witches and wizards in their jobs or daily lives: Neville and his wife had sent along another bottle of Firewhiskey, one they Neville had used his herbology skills to adapt into their own brand: Filius, had sent along the usually charmed socks – they kept his feet rather toasty, and they had been a regular gift since Harry had complained, a few years ago, that his feet were always so bloody cold.
Harry thought about sixteen-year-old Draco Malfoy, and the fear on his face back then as he lowered his wand and refused to kill the headmaster - about to accept protection. He thought about the way Draco was now as a thirty-year-old adult.
of January – because changing one’s opinions didn’t happen overnight, and they had quite a bit to get through if they had any hope of getting through to the boy. They’d also agreed that Silas would receive detention every night, starting from the first day of term – Monday the 3
“Right… Draco are you okay?” Harry frowned, feeling Draco’s head once the man was lying down on the sofa. Even Draco’s pale face was freezing cold and ghost white – something was very wrong!
“No one was supposed to know anything about them, the ministry had destroyed all books on the subject. Tom learnt of them when he was at school, through Slughorn of all people.”
"Teddy never asks for anything," Harry elaborated, "he's a good kid, and he understands that Andromeda only has so much money." They approached the desk to join the queue – only one person in front of them, a blond-haired lady in a fur coat just concluding her sale with the cashier. They were lucky, the shop seemed to be rather full with shoppers.
Harry eventually picked up a book that he seemed to like – 'Medicine today', Draco read on the spine. "What's that?" He asked, deciding to forget about the elevator for now.
“Poppy won’t let you leave without an escort!” Harry explained. “If your foot freezes up, you could trip.”
The week past as normal, and Harry and Draco where absolutely in love; sneaking kisses where they could, hand holding, using their enchanted parchment during lessons, and always retreating to either ones bedroom for the night.
“The bathroom is just outside to the right.” Harry pointed. “The towels are clean. I’ll initiate the oath of silence and explain everything once you’ve fixed yourself up a bit.” When Draco went to argue, Harry held up his hand and added. “I refuse to talk to someone with snot all over their face!” His lips curled into a slight smirk.
“This is a medi chain potter, or as the French call it, collier de médecine d'urgence. It is common in France, for those suffering seizure, allergies, or other ailments that need a close supply of potion, to wear one of these containing said potion.”
“Are you ashamed of your secret chérie?” Harry asked, leaning in closer to meet Draco’s face in the middle. “Maybe this person is unintelligent and moronic… wait! Is your secret chérie a squib?” Harry threw the bait… Draco caught it!
‘Hey Harry - not that he knew Harry’s real name of course - I am pleasantly surprised and very appreciative of my chocolate gifts, they were most unexpected. I am curious about the chocolates you have sent me and would like to know more. They are not the standard chocolate, nor quality of chocolate that I usually enjoy, but I thank you very much for them. You’re not really to blame for my upset or stress the other day, however I am playing a game to see what you might do next - your actions fascinate me. I find your unpredictability charming and intriguing.’
He still had to flush out the truth – had to be sure that Draco and Tau were one and the same, but he wouldn’t ask outright. He would need time first – lots of time, before he could confront Draco with that truth. No, right now, he’d rather help Draco. If he could gather proof in the meantime, that would be great, but it could ultimately wait a day or two.
By now, Harry was so close that Draco could feel Harry’s breath against his face. He panicked - “It was a mistake!” Draco growled, hoping his expressed anger would mask how much those words hurt him to say. “I don’t want you here! Get OUT!”
Draco had taken a free catalogue from Argos, and he was still turning the pages in curiosity as they walked through London looking for a book store. Harry couldn't help but smile each time Draco asked another question.
I'm glad you're not suffocating under a tide of red hair; it would be a rather strange epitaph don't you think?
-Saturday 6th: Looking at Hermione and Ron studying while cuddled on the couch reading a charms book with Draco. He can't share his darkness with them, only Draco.
“I need to know what happened so that I can prevent it from happening to others.” Harry said, but then he reminded himself… he wasn’t talking to one of his Gryffindor’s. “What if I make you a deal? I won’t tell anyone except Mr Malfoy what happened, and I won’t take any action that you don’t approve of.”
Harry laughed, waved his hand, and their picnic packed up and vanished back home. “Shall we?” Harry offered to do the disapparation, with Draco as his side alone.
He retched into the toilet bowl. Whisky burnt fifty time hotter – like acid, when it was coming back up. He cursed himself for panicking that he was still a Horcrux. Tom, Voldemort… he was gone! No one was in his fucking head! No one!
Harry just hummed in feigned agreement. Watching the students: dancing to rather ominous Halloween music as the charmed lights flickered over them, sitting at round tables eating Halloween themed foods, or standing around chatting on a current sugar high.
-Tuesday 2nd February. Harry and Draco hold hands to enter the Great Hall, then - Hermione takes Draco's other hand, and Ron, Harry's other hand.
“P-Po -Potion.” Harry rasped, fighting to focus on Draco instead of his nightmares – listening to him list of the potions.
Perhaps it would be best just to break his promise to Padfoot, to return his parchment and quill, and remove his files from Le’Amortentia… but it hurt to imagine Padfoot’s pain if he should be so callous.
The written part of their charms N.E.W.T.s was over, the parchment in front of them flew magically to the desk up front , and they were dismissed. It was over, Harry and Draco had finished all their N.E.W.T.s. They were now free adult, about to embark on a journey called 'the rest of their lives'.
It was almost anticlimactic. The vibe of Hogwarts Halloween when he was once a student was ominous at best, and wasn’t Halloween supposed to be scary? Hogwarts made it feel friendly somehow, fun and animated, and it had been that way since the war – since he’d been a teacher here. Harry supposed that murdering parents, letting in real grown trolls, letting out a Basilisk, breaking out criminals to attack the school, allowing terrified students to compete in dangerous tournaments, and announcing that the most fearful dark lord is back and wants to murder you all – – well, Harry wasn’t going to complain about the change, that’s for sure.
“Well, I have some ideas for his detention assignments, and we need to go over the memories that would be the most effective to use as well.” Harry said, deciding to just get on with it. He could try and figure out what had changed with Draco later… hopefully. “I Have a list of memories that I have been considering…”
“Yes. Right!” Auror Graves seemed to remember himself again. He sat back down and started his line of questioning.
Draco grabbed Harry's arms to stop him from wearing a hole in the carpet, and suddenly he was facing desperate, pleading green eyes. Without the glamours … fuck! Why the fuck did Potter have such attractive eyes!
Harry thought as he poured himself a new coffee. He took his time figuring out his reply, and once he was ready, he starting writing.
Draco almost sighed in relief; his feelings for Harry were like weeds, ruthless and persistent, unwanted and difficult to eradicate, they would only strangle Harry: Harry deserved better, and he would remain loyal to Padfoot… Padfoot! Perhaps it would be wise to ask Padfoot to meet him… if his feelings for the mystery man could indeed be true for the real man behind the parchment, then … perhaps his relentless growing feelings for Harry would abate, cease. It would also stop whatever ridiculous feelings Harry had started to develop for him, because Merlin… Harry's reaction to revoking their friendship had been almost passionately decisive, fearful even.
Harry’s thoughts were interrupted however, when Draco’s steps halted in the doorway of the Three Broomstick pub, just as they were entering – Draco’s hand was still on the open door and Harry almost walked into the back of him.
He read Tau’s words once more, quite sure that he could imagine Blaise Zabini behind the words – ‘Fuck everything and run’, but that was exactly what he was doing wasn’t it? Running and hiding from the truth that he wanted it to be Draco. He had to remember.
“It’s obvious that your eating habits are not healthy Potter – – Harry. I’d like to know why that is… I won’t pressure you into telling me, but I am curios.” Draco admitted. He had his theories; Harry had said that his life with his muggle relatives wasn’t exactly splendid, and that made him wonder if they had been poor and unable to afford food, or if they had withheld food from Harry. Had Harry been abused while the world thought their saviour was pampered and loved?
Draco. It didn’t matter how much he thought he knew, it didn’t even matter that he was already sure of that fact … he was afraid of making a fool out himself. If that minuscule possibility that it was all just a big coincidence came to be, then he would feel like a total idiot. In fact, he would be devastated.
Harry laughed. Warmth filled his stomach and he shook his head at how Draco was so … well, so Draco!
– what I saw through his eyes, what he saw through mine, and having to feel that bastard’s emotions when he was angry or-” Harry shivered, and took a deep breath. “My visons, flashes, or whatever they are… they’re not real – they’re not
“Then why don’t you meet him?” Harry asked. It was the one thing he’d been waiting for – for Tau to ask if they could meet. It scared him though, oh how it terrified him that Draco would turn him away once he knew the truth.
-Draco punches the wall in his own room, then throws the old daily prophet article - with Harry photo on the front page, across the room.
Harry Potter was no longer falling…. He was soaring on the winds of love and he hoped that Draco felt the same about him. Right now, however, he had a Slytherin to beat in a friendly wand duel.
“I hate to say it Professor Flitwick,” Minerva shook her head in feigned sympathy, “but we may have just discovered an unintelligent eagle. It will surely be one for the history books! I dare say it is pointless arguing, but,” she turned to face the Ravenclaw student, “I can assure you Miss Adair, that if you end up in the hospital wing due to rodent-bite fever, I’ll award you a house point for every spot you can find when the rash eventually breaks out.”
Poppy and Neville both shared a look of confusion, and Briana Payne continued to sob into Neville’s robes as Poppy did the spell.
Harry had to remember that he could essentially be dealing with a sensitive child at the moment, and he had to be careful with what he said. “No! No. I was just thinking about something funny. Why don’t you close your eyes? You’ll feel better if you do.” Harry smiled, trying to placate and soothe the man that was obviously hallucinating … hallucinating about scary beast and in the mindset of a child. “You know … if you see something scary, it just wants to say hi. It won’t hurt you.”
Ron: "Are you mad Mione? Malfoy? You're telling me you'd be okay with our best friend buggering that freak?"
“That’s… thank you Harry. Really, thank you.” Draco blinked as if in a daze. The gift was so thoughtful, and he wondered if the Dragon was just a coincidence. As if Harry had read his mind…
Harry: "They had faith in me to save them. Everyone believed they would be safe following me because of all that ridiculous hype - that I was the fucking chosen one."
After a week of conversing with Tau in this similar fashion, he felt like he knew the hidden meanings behind his words. In this instance he’d translated Tau’s message to:
Harry held Draco’s eyes as he continued. “I don’t think bad of you for breaking down earlier either, I’ve done it enough times. I know how humiliating and weak it can make you feel, but… I have your back Draco. I hope that’s something you can accept because … I think I need someone to have mine too. You up for that?”
Harry drifted deeper, his mind lulling him into slumber against his conscious desire to do so, but it still painted the sweetest of images. A long body leaned over him; buttery-blond hair tickled his cheeks as the grey eyes got closer to his face. So close. He could also feel the gentle breaths against his lips, and he could feel the phantom pressure against his lap as the body lowered the last few inches to sit there. Harry licked his lips in his semi-slumber. The phantom pressure - pressing a chaste kiss against his own lips, drove him to pull at that thick buttery-blond hair … but his hand grabbed at nothing but air, and it smacked down into his left check and nose instead.
“Sorry to be bothering you Master Harry Potter sir, but Potions Master Draco Malfoy be requesting you. He is sending Cloval to tell you, that he is needed you urgently in the potions classroom.” Cloval explained.
Harry's and Ron's potion turn the wrong colour and starts emitting smoke. Harry and Ron's hair suddenly turn blue. Draco, Pansy, and Blaise laughing.
Harry: "Don't! Don't call me that! It's over Malfoy. You lock yourself away, you won't let me in. I don't expect you to tell me everything, but when I'm the one you suddenly take it out on I deserve to know what's wrong. I just can't do it any more."
“It’s true sir!” Miss Mercia Raines added. Harry wasn’t sure, but he could have sworn that she was dressed as Artemesia Lufkin – the first woman to become the Minister for Magic in 1798.
“I’ll be perfectly fine.” Draco tried to ensure him, but as he went to walk away, he nearly tripped.
“Afraid so. Your extremities will sufferer from ‘icy cold flashes’ sometimes. You should be fine to leave the hospital wing tomorrow, but the cold flashes might last about five more days.” Harry explained.
Samuel looked surprised for a second, that the head of Gryffindor believed him so easily perhaps, but he regained his composure very quickly. “I asked Monero to ‘please pass the steak and kidney pie’. After taking what I wanted they did look a bit suspicious, but I just thought they were being strange. I then noticed something a bit chewy in my pie, and it was then that Monero and Cray started laughing. I went to ask what was so funny and…”
Draco: "Then lets make a deal. I'll admit when something is wrong, tell you if i'm not ready to talk about it, and if need be - ill piss of alone for a walk. If I break the deal, remind me of it! Tell me I'm breaking our arrangement. It can work both ways if you like."
the meeting.” Alluded Minerva McGonagall, eyebrow raised at her ex-students. She’d obviously not been expecting anyone to stick around after the short staff-meeting they’d all just had - regarding Halloween, and especially not Malfoy and Potter - together.
The sounds of shoes clicking into the room turned his head, and a middle age woman wearing ... a purple and black medieval dress, walked into the room smiling joyfully. Harry suddenly felt like she wanted to play with him. Her crazy black curly hair - half clipped up, came down to her waist. She wore big purple love-heart reading glasses, and purple gem earrings.
Harry craved for that type of always, the always of a partner - a husband and a family that would always be there. He'd never had an always with his mum and dad, certainly not with the Dursley's. Sirius had been murdered, and other people he loved and cared for were lost to the war twelve years ago.
-Friday 10th December - Common room: Ginny is sitting in Harry's lap kissing him,  but Harry doesn't appear to be enjoying it anymore - his open eyes follow Draco.
It only took Harry about a minute to enter the Great Hall, notice that Draco wasn’t there, and return to the frightened boy before motioning Samuel to follow him down to the dungeons.
“I know! But I have to.” Harry nodded to assure himself that he could do this. He wasn’t looking forward to seeing his memories of the war, but if he could save a teenager from a life in prison… he had to try.
By dinner time, Harry had wracked his brains trying to figure out what the fuck had happened earlier. He really had no idea, and when he spoke to Ginny, she thought he was crazy. Ginny seemed to think that the only thing that happened down by the lake, was Malfoy being obnoxious. No song, no radio, and certainly no singing Draco, Blaise, or Pansy.  What worried him though, was that Ginny didn't seem as clingy. Maybe it was just his imagination, but he hadn't imagined Draco dancing and singing.
“Shut it Malfoy! They’ve been fucking terrible this morning.” Harry sighed. “Mr Monero transfigured all of Miss Tennison’s hair bands into bees. Bees! The Gryffindor common room was in utter chaos.” Harry explained. “I thought they were real bees at first, until I caught Monero laughing with Miss Hardy and Mr Matthews. Mr Dominicus Dodge, that poor first year, he was hyperventilating in the wardrobe because he’s severely allergic to bee stings. Took me over twenty minutes to convince him that it was just a prank, and that the bees were all gone.”
Harry sniffed. He was refused to cry, the anger fading but he was getting tired of fighting to make them work. Draco would show his funny, brilliant true self, make Harry's heart skip a beat, then Draco would snap, put his walls back up, and crush his hopes of a relationship together.
Harry returned to Hogwarts a week later. School would start in two weeks and the teachers needed to make lesson plans and retrieve their timetables.
“That’s good to hear. Sit Elroy, didn’t we have something of importance to discuss. Not that I don’t enjoy our little conversations, but I’m sure we all have important things to get back to. I would hate to keep you longer than necessary.” Harry pointed at the empty chair.
Harry turned to look in the direction of Hogwarts agian, and his face lit up with a big smile when he saw the tall, blond haired young man walking towards him in the deep snow - up the hill. Harry went to meet him half way.
“You’re going to be ill if you eat all that.” Harry warned him, feeling bloated just watching. How Draco wasn’t fat was a mystery if he ate that much all the time, as it was, Draco was rather skinny and pale. Now that he was paying more attention to the man, it also looked like he hadn’t been sleeping.
Harry flew across the great lake on his Volant 360 racing broom. The wind rapidly killed his drowsiness, and the thrill of the ride gave him a boost of energy. The volant 360 was made for stunts: better grip, flat top for wind surfing, charmed seating for excellent comfort, and over thirty built in safety charms. Harry would have tried out a few more daring stunts, but he wasn’t dressed in suitable clothing - he was in jeans and a t-shirt - and he didn’t need to burn off his renewed energy when he had more planning to return to.
Draco: "Just because it's become customary for every other idiot to fall at your knees and grovel for thanks, doesn't mean I will!  I don't want you to be nice to me. Your the fucking chosen one, the savior, you wouldn't understand."
“Mr Malfoy?” Minerva called to him across the table. He turned to look at her with a small warm smile. “Have you seen Mr Potter this morning?”
Harry’s teasing lasted all through November until Draco had stopped taking the bait. Draco still had no idea that Padfoot and Harry were the same person. They were currently in Draco’s private rooms, drinking whiskey in each other’s company as had become their routine, and It was well into the evening already.
-After lessons, they hide behind a statue to share a kiss they had craved all day, giggling at themselves.
Harry paused to collect his thoughts. He remembered Draco trying to break up him and Ginny, being a dick, and ... practically begging Harry to be with him instead.
-During a song, when it says images of something appear, they are like moving holographic - or projected memories. Like a movie I suppose, of their past playing out before or around them.
Harry: "Good, because I don't pity you! I just came to see if needed any help, guess not you ungrateful git!"
Harry still didn’t know exactly why the hat hadn’t insisted on sticking him in Slytherin, and he didn’t quite believe Dumbledore when he’d told Harry that his choice made him a true Gryffindor – or that Voldemort’s piece of soul within him at the time had been a factor of that. Harry believed that everyone had traits of all four houses, and when you balanced between two rather equally, your choice was simply taken into account. He would never know, and he didn’t care all that much to be honest – not anymore. He was who he was, and quite frankly, he didn’t like the division that came with being labelled a Gryffindor, a Slytherin, a Hufflepuff, or a Ravenclaw for someone’s entire life. Who you are at eleven, isn’t necessarily who you are at thirty? Not to mention that, people had warped views on the traits that set you apart in houses. Slytherin isn’t the house of evil, Gryffindor isn’t the house of the fearless, Hufflepuff isn’t the house of nit-wits, and Ravenclaw isn’t the house of masterminds.
Harry hoped that was the case – it wasn’t like Draco had scars like that anywhere else. No, Harry truly believed that Draco just wished he could remove the Dark mark from his arm… that he could remove such a glaring reminder of his past misdeeds. It was likely that the man had realised that it couldn’t be removed and had given up trying… perhaps, in more ways than one.
“That bloody book! I hate that damn thing, but the ministry bribed me to have it published - to settle down the wizarding population. Too many people wanted to know the story of the ‘boy who lived twice’, they were getting bombarded with owls and questions, and the newspapers were writing contradictory drivel. Owls wouldn’t leave me alone either, so I was forced to sit down with a publisher and spill the details of my bloody life. Mind you, it isn’t a complete record of my history, I may have conveniently forgotten to mention half of what actually happened and tweaked a few of the details here or there.”
Harry sighed and went to check in on Draco, finding him asleep, and then went back out to sit on the sofa. He was starving, he wondered what having a deprived childhood had to do with Draco catching the Snowflu, and he was still curious about the virus itself… and he was starving!
Draco: "Forcing us to take actions we wouldn't otherwise do isn't truth Potter, it's immoral. We might as well be under the imperious curse."
It was in his bed as he tried to get comfortable, that he realised, Draco was pushing him away for some reason… but it wasn’t because the man regretted their friendship and blooming emotions for each other. Harry berated himself for the fool he’d been.
A few minutes later – after a pep talk to himself in the bathroom mirror whilst washing his hands, Harry returned to the main room.
Harry’s head snapped up and he blinked as he took in his full and waiting class of second years. Every single student was sitting with their books, parchment and quills, and wands ready to go. He smiled, embarrassed, as he put down the purple quill in his hand and stood up. He hadn’t been having a mind haze episode this time, but he was certainly lost so deep in his thoughts that he hadn’t heard his class arriving.
“Why not send Mr Longbottom?” Draco asked, looking down the table at the herbology teacher and head of Hufflepuff House. Neville Longbottom looked up upon hearing his name, but Minerva answered Draco’s question before Neville could speak.
“Calm down Potter! I’m not your judge and jury. You’re right, it isn’t up to me and I’m sorry for my curiosity on a subject that obviously bothers you so much. Your job isn’t my concern unless it affects mine, and I’m not here to cause you problems.” Draco had remained seated, but he eyes held unblinking into Harry’s.
Harry’s mind had gone from Regulus to Sirius in an instant: the locket, Grimmauld Place… the department on mysteries…
“It’s Harry. How are you feeling?” Harry asked, but then he felt rather stupid; he remembered Poppy confirming that Draco had developed the symptoms of hallucinations and childlike behaviour – would the man even be in the right state of mind to sufficiently answer that question?
never intended to make. I lived with a piece of him in my head for sixteen years, and he even possessed me at the end of fifth year. That was
Draco: "Nothing *He admitted and sighed* Fine, I'm a dick Potter! It's all I know how to be. That bloody councilor - Madam Sornaya, said I should try being more honest, and honestly ... I, I can't stop thinking about you."
“Where the fuck have you taken me Potter?” Draco snapped, but the hoarse and croaked words lacked the normal bite that Draco would have imployed, had his emotions not been dug up so forcefully. He wiped his puffy red eyes on the back of his hand, angry and humiliated, and sniffled loudly.
“Times up!” Harry clapped his hands and the tests flew to Harry’s desk via wandless magic. Most of his student sighed in relief, a few grumbled that they hadn’t finished yet. “Sorry that I subjected you all to a test on your first Defence against the darks arts class of the year, but I need to know what you guys remember so we can focus on revising what you don’t.”
He reached the door to his own private chamber and went inside. It didn’t really matter either way, Draco was Draco… and he loved the man faults and all. They were both the way they were – both fucked up because of their families misguided beliefs and actions, and both of them had issues deeper that the bloody ocean.
“I think my respect for the man just tripled.” Draco breathed. “Do you know how hard that would actually be Potter -- Harry?” Draco lent forward with a frown; his food mostly eaten now.
He turned the page of the heavy book on wizard illnesses – rather fascinated and shocked by the variety of strange diseases and viruses that were out there – and eventually reached a page on Snowflu:
Harry had promised, which meant that – if Tau and Draco were one in the same, that he’d promised that to Draco. He still didn’t know for sure if Tau and Draco were one in the same, but there were so many similarities.
give you special rights to doss around in my hospital wing, well outside visiting hours I might add! I suggest warm milk and honey Mr Potter … … Well get out then!” She shooed him.
Harry quickly finished up in the bathroom and decided to see if Tau had written to him yet. Relaxing comfortably on his bed once more, he collected the parchment and quill from his bedside table. His smile was instantaneous when he saw Tau’s writing, just like it was each and every time new words appeared. It was easily the best part of his day now.
With that though, he quickly stashed the parchment and quill into his draw, then hurried from his private chambers.
Harry winced. “Nice of you to shit on my parade.” He muttered, suddenly making a mental note to research wizard history before choosing next year’s Halloween costume. It didn’t help that Halloween brought up bad memories for him, and he’d tried to make an effort every year for the sake of the students.
“Thank you, Draco.” Harry said, looking down at his shoes. He had no idea what had come over him, he was fucking embarrassed, but then he remembered his socks and was grateful for the escape. “I don’t think anyone will notice my socks.” Harry smiled. He then went to step around Draco to reach the door.
It was really tough, choosing just one, but he kept being drawn to number three. It was the way he had written his life goal. Harry read the words again:
“The hat considered putting me into Gryffindor, but it said I was slightly more resourceful and ambitious then I was brave and daring.” Samuel then quickly disappeared into the Great Hall.
“Miss Payne.” Harry spoke up before Neville could. “Your friends, Miss Munson and Mr Garland, they said that you were inconsolable. They had another student fetch Madam Pomfrey because they were very worried about you. You were having a very nasty panic attack, and your friends tell me that you were extremely afraid of something… or someone. Are you implying that Professor Malfoy scares you that much? Are you trying to say that Professor Malfoy has hurt you–”
Tau and Padfoot weren’t ready to met yet. He would come clean with Draco, eventually, but for now he had to know if Tau liked Padfoot enough to meet him, and he had to know if he stood a chance with Draco as himself … as Harry.
Pansy: "McGonagall put up a notice, there's to be a ball before Easter. She wants to celebrate inter-house peace. Something to do with that muggle belief of rebirth or renewal. You should know Harry, Hermione?"
"That they store power somehow?" Draco asked, not understanding how the muggles had managed to do that. He walked into the back of Harry as the man suddenly stopped in front of what looked like metal doors.
As he was about to shut the door to the bathroom behind him however, he bit his lip, peeked his head around the door and looked over at the bed.
“What I did for old master Regulus when he was five.” Kreacher said, and Harry’s head snapped to face him.
“As head of Slytherin house, I am in charge of the Slytherin’s education and well-being. As Mr Silas Avery is a Slytherin, I shall remain present at the meeting.” Draco insisted.
-Images of his father back handing Draco, 8-yrs, in the face for ripping his clothes whilst tree climbing.  Draco crying in his room, confused about the changes that were happening but unable to stop them.
Her work was good, an easy Exceeds Expectations grade, but it reminded him that the girl had remedial potion at this exact moment.
“A Horcrux is the name given to an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. Tom would – he would murder someone, use some sort of spell that even I don’t know – nor do I ever want to, and then a part of his soul would split off it into an object of his choice, becoming a Horcrux. He did this six times before his downfall. Well, five times -- the sixth time was an accident on his behalf.” Harry had to pause and use the slight burn of the whisky to distract his thoughts - if only for a few seconds, before continuing.
As much as Draco tried to avoid Harry Potter, it seemed that the fates had other plans – why they tormented him so was beyond him, hadn’t he suffered enough?
“Yeah, warm!” Harry insisted, not sure if he wanted to laugh, cry, or groan at the dazed look now on Draco’s face... it reminded him of Luna actually, but it had no business being on Draco’s face.
“Probably because there is.” Harry sighed. When Draco sat on the edge on of his desk – looking down at him, he stood up. “I refused to accept him for N.E.W.T level defence against the dark arts. I knew he had the potential, but I had to give him an ‘acceptable’ in his O.W.L.s. On top of that. I always had to remove him from class – every lesson he managed to send another student to the hospital wing, and his essays where always opinionated instead of based on facts. Not to mention, that some of them, were borderline dark in nature.”
“I need you to find miss Briana Payne. I’d go myself, but I can not leave Mr Avery.” Draco explained, forcing himself to remain focused on the student in question.
“I wish it wasn’t over.” Lilium said, a sadness to her voice. She was sitting next to her best friend Josephine, who nodded in agreement.
Professor McGonagall: "Right. Well, assuming what you are saying is true, there really is nothing I can do without the object of this curse - being the radio I assume. I'd send you both to Madam Pomfrey for tests ... but I feel they would be unhelpful in this instance. I can only keep my eyes open gentlemen, and I will look into it.
“Merlin forbid if I were, and you were to find out about it Miss Zabini. But no, unfortunately. Thank-you for alerting me to your arrival, and no, never boring Mr Anderson.” He smiled at his students as he walked around his desk. “I trust you all had a great summer vacation, it’s good to see you all back for your second year.”
He scanned over Tau's words one last time before he cleared them with the Othala rune, and then started writing his reply.
Damn It! Draco cursed. He just wished that Harry would leave; he needed time alone to think, and he couldn’t think straight in Harry’s presence.
Dumbledore had led him to the slaughter, and whether or not the old man knew he would live or not after Voldemort had AK’d him, he’d still kept secrets from him and expected him to sacrifice himself for the world. Harry hadn’t known any better back then, and why wouldn’t he trust the man that played the part of a caring grandfather? He’d simply felt as if he hadn’t really had a choice back then either; it was the life of a freak with no real family to leave behind, or the rest of the world.
-Harry and Draco stand watching their friends together, laughing, sharing stories, and deciding what to do next. Harry turns to face Draco, sharing as much love as they could force into one kiss.
Breathing heavily, Draco turned around and ran. Harry called after him but he didn't stop. That fucking radio! Why can't it just piss off already and stop interfering with his life. There is no fucking way he had actually fallen in love with Potter ... damn it!
Harry was looking at him with anticipation in them big green eyes of his. “Thank you, Harry, I will try this out later for certain.” He smiled, but he gratitude just didn’t seem enough – Harry had put a great deal of thought into this quill and journal. He honestly was fascinated by it, in awe, curios, and greatly appreciative … but how did he show that without turning into a Hufflepuff. Then he remembered the gift he had gotten for Harry.
Harry: "Shut up! You almost let pride and ego break us apart, don't let it stop your boyfriend buying you a cup of fucking tea, and anything else he should wish to. Besides, some of that money was the black inheritance-"
Harry only hesitated for a second, before taking out his own wand. “I Harry James Potter, son of James Fleamont Potter and Lilly May Potter nee Evens, call upon the oath of silence to protect the world from knowledge that may harm it and the natural order of life. Absie linguamea aeternum.”
“It’s a calming drought potter. I made it myself, so I know it’s safe and most certainly better than where you usually acquire it from.”
“How?” Draco whispered “He’s smart, he will have cast another spell so that you cannot reveal the last spell he cast, he will be hiding amongst the students, and the train is about to leave.”
Hermione: "You don't typically have a ball for Easter, and I obviously didn't know McGonagall was hosting one, but it makes sense. Houses have been mingling more and swapping tables at breakfast. Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, is a religious holiday commemorating the time Jesus Christ - god's begotten son, rose from the dead. He offered his life to redeem all mankind of their sins, all personal sins of these who repent. It symbolizes new birth, hope, and renewal ..."
“Draco, I’ll be right back okay. You just … stay there…” Harry frowned down at the crying man, bewildered and deeply concerned. He left the room in a hurry, intending to fetch Madam Pomfrey as quickly as possible.
Draco: "I still love you. I'm no expert, but judging by how needy you were for my delectable lips ... I'd say its reciprocated. Quite nicely in fact."
"If you'll help me check I have everyone's gifts except Kaison's," said Harry, "I'd really appreciate it. And … if you would pick up something for me tomorrow, I'd owe you one."
Harry: "My memories weren't fabrication! They are real. You're attack in the Great Hall was real, and that kiss ... whether we would have done it not under any other circumstance, was real! And i'm sure Ginny being pissed of at me is real too."
The mug thudded gently as Harry suddenly placed it onto the bedside table, and he took out the magical parchment and quill from the draw. He was determined to find out if his new revelation regarding Tau and Draco proved to be valid.
-There are time skips during the songs, in which days, weeks, or even months may pass during some of them.
“This isn’t something I share lightly Draco. Apart from Kingsley, only Ron and Hermione have this knowledge. It’s fucking difficult to share too – it’s a pivoting factor to my worst nightmares. I don’t talk about them, not even to Ron or Hermione.”
Draco closed his eyes, a futile attempt to stop the tears that fell there as he realised … he would never know what it was like to be in a relationship with someone that loved him.
coffee. Could you also bring me some toast? I don’t think I will be attending breakfast this morning.” He requested, wondering if he could even stomach toast right now.
If it wasn’t for the fact that Minerva and Poppy had been into see the man last night, and had assured him that the potions teacher was just fine, then he would have broken the bloody door down in fear of Draco being hurt or what not.
Harry: "Really, it was just a too many things at once. Waking up with the reminder of death, being jinxed or whatever, Seamus, people judging you - us, and that fucking news article. I don't know Dray, my temper scares even myself. I once blew up, well ... inflated my muggle Aunt with accidental magic - Summer before third year, she floated away and had to be rescued by the ministry. Her memories were removed."
“Harry!” Draco said, a beaming smiling overcame his face. Harry was so kind, wonderful, safe. Harry would get him Pancakes!
Draco opened his door a bit more, frowning slightly down at him. “You’re concern about my health Potter –– Harry?” He sounded surprised almost, like Harry checking to make sure he was alright was unbelievable.
His mind argued. Was he really so guilty of judging the book by its cover – of seeing what he expected to see when he looked at Draco? Then again, Tau was an illusion he’d created, he only knew what Tau wrote – his mind supplemented the blanks with fantasy.
Harry had been called up on the smile he was aiming at Draco, but he didn’t care and shrugged. Draco was obviously worried about him, and that was a nice feeling – to be worried about period. Oh, he had people that worried about him – far too much actually, but it was the type of the worry. Hermione worried far too invasively; dear Molly worried by over feeding you and fussing; Ron worried by running to Hermione, or thinking that a quick pat on the back and a pep talk solved everything; and Minerva worried from afar, or with biscuits and tea. Draco’s worry was different, welcoming, and definitely less invasive.
“We missed lunch.” Draco stated, after he assured Harry that he would see to it that the potions were ready for him in time. “I have no lesson to teach this afternoon. I assume you don’t either, or you wouldn’t still be here. Do you wish to join me for a bite in the kitchen?”
He put his parchment and quill in the draw of his bedside table, then snuggled under the covers to sleep. He still had a huge grin on his face, felling much better after his run in with Malfoy earlier. He kept trying to picture what Tau looked like: Blond hair - maybe a sunshine golden blond, or a honey blond. Grey eyes - dark grey like a storm, grey that was almost blue, or a light grey? He was taller than Harry, 5ft 9in if he remembered his profile correctly. Maybe he was lean and tall, with a handsome face and a kind smile.
-Both boys fall to sleep in their pajama trousers, facing each other as if they fell to sleep taking.
Draco sighed, wishing he could just retreat to his private rooms, but he sat down in the empty armchair instead so that he could do his duty as teacher. “The best moments always seemed to accelerate and slip beyond one's grasp just when you want to hold onto them for as long as possible.’ That was a quote from a muggle writer, E.A. Bucchianeri, who rather liked music and chocolate, but it is quite true. You can measure the moment by how fast time sees to move.”
If Harry had been his student, he would have feared for the rest of his school year, but Avery just sighed angrily.
He really had enjoyed Draco’s company, but now, as he looked into stunning grey eyes, he wondered what kissing him would feel like. But no more then a second later did he think of Tau again. He didn’t want to betray the trust he had started to gain with the mystery man: even if Tau would never know,
Harry wondered if Draco had ever been able to bare himself so openly to another before – or to allow himself to let go so emotionally, but he was glad that Draco was finally releasing some of that pent-up emotion. The masks Draco hid behind were preventing him from letting go of the past, and they were preventing him from forming relationship with other people – be that platonic or otherwise.
“Cold!” Draco groaned, his eyes opening as he reached out to grab at Harry’s arm, looking desperately for relief from the icy sensations cursing through his body.
Draco couldn’t help feeling extremely embarrassed though; chocolate was like a drug to him, a craving that he’d developed after figuring out that chocolate soothed his less than positive moods. Yes, chocolate had always been a weakness to him, but after the war it had become something he could rely on – something that would always been there to warm him when he fell into a depressive or stressed state of mind. Luckily, no one else had noticed his childish behaviour, and Salazar... he would have mortified if they had.
“Draco calm down! Breath…” Harry kept encouraging the man to mimic his breathing and calm down. It seemed to be working, Draco was responding to his voice at least… but Harry wanted to hold him and rub his back or something, take away his pain and discomfort, only, he didn’t want Draco to react badly … or worse.
“Good morning Master Potter Sir…” The old house elf bowed as he appeared with a ‘pop’. “How may Kreacher be a serving you this morning?”
“Kreacher?” Harry asked in confusion. His breathing was slightly increased from his mini panic, but he was calming himself down now.
Maybe Tau had no family, which would explain why he berates Elliot for leaving his. If Tau was alone, maybe death eaters forced him to do things he wouldn’t otherwise do. Maybe he had no choice yet still blames himself for being a ‘coward’, for not refusing. Maybe they killed his family, or held them hostage, or both, and then forced him into following them. Maybe-
Harry sipped at his milk as he waited. He couldn’t stop wondering about Tau’s past, his mistakes and regrets.
"Yeah," nodded Harry, "he wants to try out for the chaser position that will open up after the summer. Mylo Yarwood is a seventh year so he won't be here next year."
“Poppy! I need you to preform a spell that shows Miss Payne’s medical history for the last couple of years.”
Harry: *A small chuckle left his swollen lips.* "I'm okay. I just didn't sleep last night, dozed of on the train, woke up with-"
Something about seeing Draco – a grown man who was almost pouting, defeated by chocolate, was almost adorable – amusing and remarkably innocent.
Harry drew the Mannaz shaped rune on the bottom centre of the parchment and run the quill feather over it, watching as glimpses of a past memory surfaced as the words vanished. He shook his head, not wanting to think about a certain diary from his second year at Hogwarts.
Harry sighed and walked to the door as Draco opened it. He stopped in the door way before Draco could close the door.
Harry then heard Draco stirring awake, the quiet groans loud in the silent room. He quickly placed the book down on the floor to check the man was alright.
Image of a dead Fred lying in the Great Hall during the war, with Remus and Tonks's lifeless body beside them.
The pen hovered in Malaise's hand above the parchment she was writing on, and he suddenly realised he hadn't answered her yet.
Yes, Draco was gorgeous in his aristocratic, pompous, pure-blooded way … but he was, gorgeous that is. The sexual attraction was there, but he had so much history with the blond. The question was – would that history impede on any relationship that might start between them?
He wondered if he should stand by the door - - no! If he answered the door too quickly then Draco would know he’d been waiting for him. He sat on one of the old-but-comfortable dark-blue armchairs that he’d conjured instead, a small rectangle table between them - a small wooden thing that was rather dark, and tapped his fingers as he waited – fidgeting with his hands.
It took a while to convince Draco to side along with him - Draco didn't want to to be 'escorted like a child', but they eventually arrived in the more bustling Diagon Alley. The first thing Harry wanted to do was visit Gringotts Wizarding Bank, so he took Draco's hand and of  they went. Harry had some money on him, but not enough for the stuff he would likely buy in Homely Abode for his home - 12 Grimmauld place, or other things that might take his fancy.
“He was in love with my mother.” Said Harry - to his plate of food. His head shot up however, when he heard Draco chocking on his vol-au-vent. “You alright?” Harry asked with a wince.
Samuel truly smiled then, and chuckled under his breath. His features then turned into one of concern. “Is Mr Malfoy okay?”
Miss Camellia Nixon was quickly taken to St Mungo’s, and thankfully they received news that she would make a full recovery. However, Auror Justin Graves, wanted to examine the Great Hall in painful detail, and brutally pounded them all with questions. How they knew what Camellia had ingested? Why some of the staff had strong Wiggenweld Potions on hand? Why hadn’t they contacted the Auror’s before now – when the possibility of a threat was brought to light? And when they had handed him Mr Silas Avery’s school file – Why wasn’t this student reported to the Aurors beforehand?
Draco sat on his bed, trying to read over his school work from the past two months. He was trying to remember his past classes, and trying to make everything he had supposedly learnt - and done, all sink in now that he wasn't singing ... but he was too distracted.
Harry knocked on the potion classroom’s door. He didn’t have to wait long until Draco answered it with a frown before he realized who it was. Draco appeared to be slightly curious of his unannounced arrival, but he realized the man still had a class in session. Before Harry could apologise for interrupting, Draco spoke first.
most certainly would. He had no intentions of leading either man on either, It would only end badly. He was also well aware that he was drunk, and his desire to make out was most likely due to that – it was a flaw that had resulting in him waking up with a few unknown men from muggle bars before.
Harry read the message a few times, not bothering to restrain the ridiculous grin that lit up his face. Tau was so charming on paper and he really hoped the same held true in real life. He couldn't imagine what Tau could have done to warrant a lack of forgiveness, and it seemed that it was more then just a few people that wouldn't give him a chance.
He had been talking to Tau every day for the last seven days, and they had fallen into a habit of communicating at night, in the morning, and a few times during the day. Tau could make him laugh, and the mystery man seemed to have relaxed slightly - communicating more freely, and seemed less insecure. Harry had a grin on his face as he got comfortable and he read his new message - his bottom lip between his teeth.
Harry got up to leave but Draco grabbed his hand. He really did want Harry to stay, but relationships, being open and honest just weren't him. He had to try being honest like Madam Sornaya advised - even if just partly, but it was hard. He was struggling to be himself, not the person he was breed and trained to be.
Auror Graves stood from his seat and practically sneered at Draco, asserting his superiority as an Auror. “I asked nicely, won’t ask again.”
Harry: "Then let us show you. You won't know how until you try. Forget everything you have even known, and try something new. Will you do that, for me?"
He chuckled at the memory, and then suddenly felt the heat in his cheeks when the images of Draco luring him into the forest naked returned.
The door opened, and judging by Draco’s features, Harry must have been emanating the nervousness he certainly felt. He suddenly couldn’t remember what the fuck he had planned to say – it was like his brain had short-circuited.
“Nightmares?” Draco asked. Harry just nodded. “Oh, come here Potter!” Draco ordered; it burned his eyes just looking at Harry’s state of dress. He stepped closer to the raven-haired man.
“Alright, alright! That enough now, settle down!” Harry’s deep voice boomed across the room. His students hardly ever heard him use this tone, and it successfully silenced the room. “It’s a simple test recapping on what you remember from last year. It should be easy enough, and you don’t have worry about marks because I won’t be marking it. The idea, as you should be aware of by now, is to decided what first year material needs to be revised. I can forgo the test if you like, but then I will be forced to give you an immense load of homework covering the entire curriculum of first year. If you want the extra homework, and would like to see your current defense against the arts teacher run screaming from his private chambers in the middle of the night, barefooted and in his pajamas, because he went crazy with the work load, then perhaps that can be arranged?”
Harry was manipulating Draco’s incoming snow attack, planning to send the growing snowball straight towards the blond the moment that Draco let up with his current spell. He thought he had it all sussed out, but before he had a chance to enact his evil plan… Draco flicked his wand up, smoothly ending one spell and immediately casting another in such a quick succession, straight at the very massive snowball above his head.
-Tuesday the 8th December - Common room: Draco watching Harry - through the crack in his bedroom door, as Harry laughs with his friends during  game of exploding snap.
He heard a snort of amusement from his right, and he turned his head to see the blond helping himself to the double chocolate gateau.
-Scratches at the Death Eater mark aggressively, wanting it gone. His tears falling down his face as he breaks the skin - the blood running down his arm as it gathers, but it doesn't hurt physically.
Draco was telling himself that one more helping would be okay, it would be his last, and he just couldn’t resist one more bowl of that rich, irresistible, homemade, chocolate log. The moist treat was enough to melt his mind, to take him away from reality … and to temporarily remove Potter from his thoughts. He picked up the knife, and as soon as he went to cut off another slice… the yule log vanished.
Harry called for Kreacher, asking him politely for a glass of water. Kreacher complied to his masters wishes quickly, and Harry downed half the glass in one before placing what remained on his bed side table.
“My extremities are still cold.” He complained, feeling as if he should be treated like the Malfoy he was. He was rather surprised by his own rising superiority, but suddenly, it became
Harry put down the quill after sending off his message. His words stocked kindle to a lot of bad memories and emotions that he’d been avoiding, but he needed to give Tau a glimpse into his past. No one really knew about the Dursleys, and it wasn’t something he’d ever told the publisher about for that bloody book – expect that he had live there for eleven years and during the summer holidays. Only Ron and Hermione really knew that they treated him with the kindness one would treat an un-welcomed pest, and even then, they didn’t know the full details.
“Why?” Harry asked, moving closer to Draco. “The students won’t be returning until tomorrow evening, and you’ve been hiding in here for long enough that I’m sure you’ve already graded everything. If you really want me to leave, at least be honest with the why.”
“I think he just remembered that he had the dark mark.” Harry explained, not sure that was all it was.
Those words halted Draco, and he looked at Harry observingly. What did it matter if Harry Potter wasn’t straight, or as conventional and perfect as the wizarding world wanted him to be – assumed him to be? Why did it matter to him if Harry liked men? One thing was certain though – if Harry Potter’s sexual preference was men inclined, then Harry couldn’t mock the fact that he was gay without being a hypocrite. He suddenly felt safer with this knowledge; he was on even ground again. He had suspected that Harry wasn’t women inclined, but he didn’t have any solid proof… until now.
“Come on then.” Harry said, before Draco commented on his embarrassment. “I’ll get Kreacher to gather some food, we can go find a basket or something, and a ground blanket.”
-Harry and Draco put on smiles for the interviewer when he arrives, greeting him with firm  handshakes.
Harry heard as he entered the hospital wing Tuesday Morning, greeted with the scene of a furious Draco shouting at Madam Pomfrey… again.
“Mr Potter! What brings you to Hogsmeade today? Can you tell me about your current association to ex Death Eater Draco Malfoy?” The lanky brown-hair reporter looked at him expectedly.
“Something like that, yeah.” The memory of what his therapist had said nearly ten years ago, was still hard to hear, even as a memory. He quickly pulled himself together however, “thank you Draco. This is a really thoughtful gift.” Harry picked up the Lanyard, putting it over his head. He noticed that it felt weight less. He lifted the shrunken vial in his fingers, and then he remembered, “what potion is this?” He was pretty sure he already knew the answer thought, and as he expected…
“Oh, here it comes. I was wondering why you hadn’t mentioned it yet. You were trying to lead me into a false sense of security, but I won’t fall for it, Potter!” Draco crossed his arms, looking anywhere but at Harry.
Harry now knew that someone close to Tau - his parents most likely, had expected Tau to following in their footsteps or to grow to be like them at least. If he’d read this correctly, then Tau’s parents held views that he later saw as flawed and depraved. It sounded like he was no longer on good terms with whoever he’d trusted before, and that break of trust had left him alone and scarred.
Saturday morning found Harry in his kitchen of number twelve Grimmauld Place, making coffee in his grey short sleeved pyjamas. It had been a week since he had been to Le'Amortentia, and he hadn't heard anything back yet. Perhaps the blond man had declined his request.
"Volant brooms?" The young male shop assistant asked them when it was their turn to be served. He looked uneasy, and he'd obviously overheard Harry mentioning them.
“I’m sorry.” Harry apologised. “You’re right, it is something that I get defensive over. It’s a left-over symptom of the war, and a condition that cost me a job in the auror department…”
“Good morning Mr Malfoy, I have potions here for you.” Madam Pomfrey sauntered over, placing the potions down on the bedside cabinet.
He thought. There were plants in large vases – simple greenery really, and various dark green textiles here and there, but Harry noticed only one other door in the room – besides the main door that was.
There was a long silence that Harry welcomed, it meant Draco was analyzing the pros and cons of being totally open and honest - emotional wise. Something he'd recently started doing. Harry just patiently waited, leaving it in Draco's hands now.
Harry sighed on the other side, alone in the cold dungeon corridor. He wanted to bang his head against the wall, but instead, he forced his feet to start moving back to his own room.
Shaking her head as she returned to her office and private chamber, she thought back to the 1990’s – the fierce rivalry between Harry and Draco was almost iconic, but now look at them … who would have guessed it?
Ron: "Come off it mate. You haven't stopped going on about the tosser, and you've been trying to convince us he isn't a complete dick. Which I think is total bullshit by the way."
He’d bet his wand that Silas had done something to put the fear of Merlin into the girl. This was not good… not good at all.
Harry shook himself, making sure that the charms to keep the bedding warm were still working, and were still applied to his clothes and pillow as well.
Blaise laughed, Draco chuckled. Draco no longer felt right teasing Neville, the bloke had killed Nagini during the war, and stood up to the Dark Lord when fear was most rife. Neville had assisted - bravely, in
-Tuesday 27th October, Harry, Ron, and Hermione - see Draco outside knocking over a second year Hufflepuff as he walked passed him, laughing
Draco started to walk away, he couldn't let himself believe Harry's words. Harry was just angry,  just consumed by raw magic, and lacking sleep. Wasn't he?
-Wednesday 10th March, Draco on Harry's bed top-less. Harry removes his robes, jumper, and tie - snapping it out suggestively. He slowly advanced to the bed, climbing over Draco, and running his hand down to undo his lovers trousers.
Draco: "Nice of to laugh at my very serious predicament Potter. We can still leave you know. I don't know how you're so confident and cheerful about this."
Draco had returned to England because McGonagall had written to him and asked that he teach potions – that she was in urgent need of a potion’s professor. What had shocked Harry the most, was that McGonagall had kept in touch with Draco after the war – initially the first letter was regarding his return to Hogwarts for a re-do of seventh year, but he had declined. McGonagall had been rather persistent, but Draco even more so. Their correspondence just never stopped after that. Draco had mentioned a few times, in his letters to the headmistress, that he was studying under a French Potions master’s tutelage, and had told her a few years ago that he had finally acquired his own master in potion - and had become a potions master now himself. Draco had agreed to take the job as potions professor because the headmistress had been kind to him, and he’d wanted to used his new skills for something.
“The Snowflu is certainly sending you for a loop huh?” Harry asked, smiling sadly. This was a symptom they’d discovered that hadn’t been mentioned in the books – lapses in memory. Poppy suggested that the adult mind did so because it couldn’t cope with the fluctuations in his mental age, that the virus was temporarily affecting the brain. It made sense, was a good theory, but it wasn’t easy to watch.
It was nearly 5pm now, he really should go down to dinner in the Great Hall… but he wasn’t hungry. He really wanted to take a shower, climb into his pyjamas, and leave the homework marking for tomorrow. With any luck, he might have something more intelligent to respond to Tau with after his shower.
Ron spat, scowling at the entrance to the Great Hall. Harry turned to see Draco, right before a certain radio appeared on the table. Golden light erupted once again, and the music started.
Harry screamed in anger, about to use another spell on Draco, but Draco quickly used the shield charm.
At one point during the day, after their visit to Quality Quidditch - in which they nearly got thrown out for acting like ten-year olds, Draco insisted that Harry needed new robes. It was for that reason, that Harry found himself buying two new outfits of Draco's choice. If it wasn't for the fact that Harry was indeed 'the chosen one' and a paying customer, they would have been in tons of trouble when they accidentally pulled down the changing room curtain during a make-out session - both topless and witnessed by a rich woman looking for a dress. Once Harry paid - and extended that to the woman's dress as an apology, they left the shop drunk on love and laughing til it hurt.
Harry is the last one in the common room, so Draco approaches him. Harry shakes his head to reject him agian, but he bites his lip like he is thinking about it.
Draco and Harry are thirty-years-old in this story, they both still have some scars left over from the war and that, but otherwise it's about finding love through a magical connected parchment. I got the idea through a film called 'You've got mail', a film I also do not own in any way shape or form.
“I erm… I just…” Harry berated himself, taking a deep breath and relaxed – determined not to make a complete fool of himself. “I just wanted to make sure you were okay after yesterday.” Harry smiled up at Draco, more aware of the man’s features then he was before.
"You were saying?" Draco drawled, still bitter that their conversation had been rudely interrupted. Harry was so jubilant and joyous today despite the crowds, and even though the man hadn't stopped talking up a storm, he rather enjoyed listening to him; It was good to see Harry so frivolous, instead of over worked and stressed. "About Teddy, and that Hufflepuff have good players this year."
Draco turned and walked off. He didn't know where he was going, and would have apparated back to Hogsmeade if he had a licence. Harry followed him.
Could Draco have been deprived of the joys of snow when he was a child? Perhaps it was too frivolous and ‘silly’ an activity for a Malfoy child to play in the snow. Too loud, boisterous, and childish? Even Harry had been able to play in the snow on rare occasions – always on his own though… unless Dudley and his friends were using him as the target of course. Harry frowned as he thought deeper, remembering more of his therapist’s words…
Harry chuckled as he started his story. If he made it sound a bit more impressive by omission, then … oh well.
“For you to call me Harry would be a start.” Harry told him, folding his hands together on the table.
Harry sighed as realisation hit him. “Have you possibly eaten something of the joke variety Mr Bartlett?” Harry asked, thinking of the Weasley Wizard Wheezes ‘Amazing Animal Assortments.’ It was a product like ‘Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans’, but instead of flavours… you’d be forced to speak like a random animal for at least twenty minutes.
“…She went up to mother and asked if we stocked ‘Charming coitus charms, by Fanny Lotus.’” Draco laughed from his position on the floor, his face red with humour, and a fifth glass of fire whiskey in his hand.
He tucked Draco’s hand under the blanket before re-casting warming charms on the bedding – making sure they held up and were working efficiently. He just hoped Poppy would return soon with that potion; he was totally out of his element, and he worried that he would be useless if things deteriorated.
Hesitating at first before finally sitting down on the chair he'd bumped into, he sighed in resignation. Why did he let Ron and Hermione talk him into this? He supposed, he'd only accepted to come because it was rude to decline a birthday gift. Although ... he secretly felt that this was the worst gift he had ever received - It was an invasion of his life choices to be frank, and his friends never left well enough alone. Yes, he wanted to find love, but he wanted to find it like a normal human being and not through some strange magical dating service. Hermione, especially, invested far too much of her time worrying about him and his future, coming up with crazy idea to 'get him laid'. It was almost as mortifying as sitting here waiting to be set up with a date - surely this was for desperate, insane, unattractive people.
If Draco replied, it was drowned out by the cheering and shouting students. It was only then that they remembered where they were, and why they were outside to begin with… they were both suddenly feeling embarrassed.
Harry waved his hand and a bag of owl treats came flying into the kitchen. He handed the owl a few, watching it eat them happily before flying away. As soon as it had left, he un-shrunk the package with his wand and instantly noticed it was from Le'Amortentia.
Ron: "You trust him? What if it explodes? I bet he is just telling you that so he can watch it blow up in our face."
Draco scratched unconsciously at his arm where the Death mark is. The councilor picked up her quill and started writing, chuckling to herself.
Despite his worry regarding Draco’s health and wellbeing, the action of dressing Draco – even just his socks – made him think of undressing the man … and wasn’t that just fucked up! Even though it was a fleeting image, a secret desire he’d had for weeks, he felt betrayed by his mind that it would remind of that
“What’s wrong?” Asked Harry, frowning at the abnormal pale complexion Draco was suddenly sporting. He looked like he’d seen a ghost.
Harry had turned red, and zoned out as his friends bickered before him. Luckily the common room was empty except them, but he could have sworn someone was watching him. He turned to find the room empty.
Sitting at a one long Hogwarts table in the middle of the Great Hall, decorated spectacularly in a winter wonderland theme of silver and blue, were seven merry teachers, and twenty-seven joyful students. Everyone was tucking into their Christmas dinner and talking cheerfully between mouthfuls of turkey, stuffing, and roast potatoes, over the sounds of silverware on brilliant white plates.
-Thursday 21st: Great Hall. Harry watches Draco with Pansy and Blaise, then gets into another heated discussion at the Gryffindor table regarding Draco.
Before Draco could answer, the radio 'popped' onto the table. Harry tried to grab it, but it was too late. Not now, not right as the damn interviewer was due!
“Keep an eye on him.” Poppy said. Harry nodded, returning to Draco’s bedside once Poppy returned to her office.
Draco ran his hand through his hair. He was worried this was some type of dark magic, and that he'd be blamed. He didn't want to give anyone an excused to send him to Azkaban - and he knew they'd welcome one.
Yes, he may have grown to love Padfoot one day, but that love would never amount to what he felt for Harry bloody Potter.
Draco stopped walking to scowl at Harry, he seemed to be mulling over what he’d just said, but then Draco growled and stropped off again. Harry sighed and followed him.
Draco frowned. He seemed to be taken-back by that question. After a moment he said, “Not at all Potter, the offer of a free drink was simply too good to pass up.”
"Ah, you have a voucher! Perfect!" Malaise squealed at him, smacking him straight out of his rude staring and into embarrassment. "Just drop it into that cauldron and we'll get started!" Malaise pointed to the table in front on him, and he swore she battered her eyes at him – flirting.
Harry shook his head, not really knowing what to say. It wasn’t like he hadn’t done his own spying on the blond when they were students.
him. He was right there! How rude of them! However, before he could express his feelings on that, he felt a wave of safety wash over him… Harry was here!
"Nope. I was…" Harry hesitated, deciding a lie by omission couldn't hurt. "When I was eight, I fell over at school. I was outside, my leg scraped across the steps I was climbing up. The school had to call an ambulance to take me to hospital. I ended up needing four stitches in my left shin, just below my knee. The cut was really deep." Harry finished his story and images of what actually happened flashed into his mind…
He’d asked Draco how he was keeping, what had made him move to France and then come back to England? Draco had explained; the animosity and hatred both he and his mother had faced - after the war, was the most deciding factor in them leaving the country. Harry understood that, but then Draco had mentioned the night Albus dumbledore was murdered; whatever Draco had said after that fell upon deaf ears - Harry was lost thinking about that night.
"Draco?" Harry was standing in front of him … When had he stood up? "Draco, don't be an arse, I, fuck!"
-Flashes of their most recent battle play out around them like a hologram, but then good memories of the last four months do too.
things instead, and he simply loved his work. Once he was finished reading Jaylan's work, he marked the essay with an O for outstanding, and suggested he read - 'Unusual use of spell work by Flanius Handgal', if he hadn't already.
“Both!” Draco burst out laughing – his laughter was breathy and almost quiet though, his body rocking with mirth. His pale skin was washed with a warm glow, his eyes danced with merriment, and he had to put down his drink so that he could double over and laugh freely.
“That’s the Slytherin boy with the long black hair right –- really pale skin, quiet, hardworking?” Harry asked, confirming the face to the name.
The way Draco worded it was sincere, touching, and it really hit home what his death had actually achieve for the world. He’d never accepted that he’d done more then actually be a sacrifice, but now… now he could see all the things that might not have been if he hadn’t done his duty. He still grieved for those lost, but now he could see all the things his sacrifice
The look Harry was now giving Draco made the blond regret opening his mouth. Draco hurried away in the snow, Harry following him.
“Would you like a tour?” Harry suddenly suggested, hoping to avoid the topic of Horcruxes a little longer if he were honest. “I have drunk far too much coffee to stay seated.”
Their drinks suddenly appeared on the table in the common room, and Draco’s eyebrow raised when he realised there were five drinks and only four students… well, he certainly wouldn’t complain, Salazar only knew how much he needed something chocolatey right now to help settle his rampaging thoughts and feelings.
“You will report to me every night this week from 8pm until 10:30pm. You will also report to Mr Filch at 9am on Saturday morning, and you will work for him until 5pm, only being excused for one hour during lunch time. On top of that, you will report to me on Sunday at 9am. I will give you a detention slip when you return here tonight at 8pm. You are dismissed!” Draco was almost hissing at the boy, but he held calm and Harry had to commend him on his restraint – He himself, had yelled at the Silas a few times in the past because the boy had a way to make even his blood boil.
“No! No there’s nothing there Draco.” Harry tried to soothe him, but Draco went flying backwards out of his bed – taking the blanket with him – and he landed on the floor in a fear filled panic. “Draco!”
“Thank you, Harry, and Mother is doing well. She is most grateful that you are doing this for her.” Draco said.
Coffee made; Harry frowned as he sat down in the armchair opposite Draco, noticing that he seemed to be in deep thought and pondering something. “Everything okay?” He asked.
Harry knew he was being ludicrous, Padfoot and himself were the same fucking person, but … he couldn't lie to himself – he'd wanted Draco to choose him, the real him. What was worse, he knew Draco would kill him for not be honest sooner, fuck! What had he done? Draco was infatuated with Padfoot, and he'd rejected him – Harry.
“I’d say that you were insane. There is no way that-” Draco’s frown deepened. He suddenly caught Harry’s eyes and observed his facial expressions. “No way! Potter that’s … … Only you! I can’t believe this. Tell me everything!”
“It is mostly muggle made,” Harry spoke first, quietly and unsure, but it still made Draco jump, “but I managed to get some charms added.”
“I got you something too,” Harry admitted with a small smile. He went to his bedroom to collect the large book sized gift.
“But you don’t. You just confirmed that. It was a question if you remember, I never stated that you had two.” Draco smirked.
Draco was already there when he'd arrived, and they'd pulled each close. Their lips joining like they needed the others to breathe again. After a while of making out they sat on the dusty floor together - Harry's head on Draco's shoulder.
“Well don’t just stand there.” Draco said, taking a seat on one of his black leather, camel back sofas. He put down a wad of blank parchments, an ink pot, and a quill. “Sit down and tell me what you have in mind then.”
A healer from St Mungo’s had been called over, and Draco – who had still been in the hospital wing at the time, explained that it was their belief that a more potent version of the draught of living death could have been the culprit. This of course, posed the question of how he knew this – especially when a spell confirmed it to be true. More questions then followed when the Aurors arrived, and it was a giant mess.
"Well, if you're unsure, just ask the shop assistant for help. It might be a good idea to check that everything you pick up is suitable for a thirteen-month old baby regardless… just to be safe you know, and it will be fine if it's for an eighteen-month-old even, he can grow into it, but don't–"
Harry smiled bitter-sweetly as Draco left the room - with the whiskey still in his hand too. Whether or not Draco realised it, he’d managed to calm the blond down and get him to stay for a drink. It felt good – being able to help in some way, but Harry now had to share some of his own demons. Perhaps he should take advantage of his more Slytherin qualities…
“No.” Harry shook his head, putting the mug back down. “It usually only happens once or twice a month, if that. I don’t know what’s up with me lately.” Harry chuckled – trying to play it off as unimportant, but then he sighed and looked slightly troubled. His brow frowned and his eyes unfocused as he thought about the increase in his episodes. He tilted his head and scratched at his hairline.
They had shared an entire day in each other's company, and Salazar … their companionship had been easy, right, and radiant. Harry never judged him, never accused him, never reminded him of the errors of his past… they had just enjoyed each other's presence. Draco couldn't remember the last time he had felt so at peace in anyone's company, he'd almost forgotten who he was – Draco Malfoy, an ex-Death Eater!
Draco blushed instantly, but no one noticed his reddening cheeks over the choking, coughing, and the 'oi oi' comments and noises that rose from the Gryffindor table.
He suspected that he wouldn’t get much sleep tonight… he’d be far too worried about Draco, and the echoes of his past still whispered in the night air.
Draco countered the spell as the snow reached his waist, but he had no time to cast his attack – suddenly, a multitude of incoming snowballs where headed straight for him, and he had to doge them all by diving to the ground and rolling in the snow.
“I meant it you know.” Harry started. “You deserve to find someone and they would be lucky to have the real you in their life, but you need to be yourself Draco. No walls, no hiding behind defensive anger or becoming a jerk because you’re afraid. Find the courage to take the risk. I know that’s hard for you to do, but you’ll be stuck alone if you don’t.” Harry then smiled at him, a brilliant smile that gave Draco courage.
“For saving the world with your sacrifice. For being brave enough to die for people that may never know you. For saving me. For allowing us this opportunity to just gaze at the stars and breath. And, for dragging me to your… acceptable little abode, and being a friend when I needed one.”
He left his empty cup on the dining table, went to the small box room to gather a list, and then left his chambers. He had to go and speak to Draco about a few potions he would need in two weeks-time; It wasn’t quite lunchtime yet, so he would try the potions classroom first.
Harry's eyes met steel grey one and sneered. Trust Malfoy to be a class A prat about a simple accident. "Expect you to understand that accidents happen Malfoy. To accept my apology and let it go without being a prat about it!"
Chuckling lightly to himself, he went back to imagining what his Chérie might look like. Lost in thick honey-blond hair, passionate grey eyes, and tall, impossibly gorgeous men, he fell to sleep.
As soon as the door closed, a golden light erupted outwards. The light grew - passing a gulping Draco who recognized the magic, and it continued to spread like a wave until the entire school had been turned gold. Then the music started, taking over Harry and Draco like before.
A young man suddenly greeted him, so he politely nodded in response- with a smile, before he disappeared into the warmth of the pub leaving Harry outside alone once more. It was a quite morning in Hogsmeade, not many visitors today. The snow painted everything a brilliant white, and the shops had been repaired and re-opened after the war.
Harry got his great grey owl - Lilsiv, to deliver his letter to Malfoy. She was a smart owl, and she had managed to deliver letters to staff members in the dungeon before. Lilsiv was also feisty and stubborn, and he briefly wondered what Malfoy would make of her.
Hermione and Ron had their own lives – when they weren’t meddling in his, and they were growing distant. They would forever be his first and best friends, but they talked about their own lives – their families, their kids, and their job’s. Harry didn’t really have a ‘life’, and when he was in their company, he often just sat there nodding along with another drink they’d pushed his way, or picking at the snacks they’d set out.
Harry’s head flew up to face his bathroom door, hand pausing with the toothbrush, wondering who was knocking at…
Harry returned to bed with a mug of hot coffee that morning. He planned to lay in for just a while longer, or at least, enjoy his quiet morning until he had finished his coffee. He had a lot on his mind though; he was thinking about Silas, about Camellia, and about Draco vs Tau.
him he was sure. He was also sure that Harry had liked him for a while, and it was no secret to himself that Harry affected him in ways that no one else ever had. Harry Potter was something of an enigma; he was nothing like what others claimed him to be, nothing like what he thought Potter was, and the man was nothing like the boy … or maybe, he was
In the Slytherin common room, Draco was just waiting for the house elves to send up hot chocolate for his four students; the teachers had all agreed that they could have a mug each before bed to help them warm up and sleep tonight. The first year – Samuel Bartlett, and the two second years – Lilium Zabini and Josephine Prescott, had showered and were ready for bed. Colten Sayer – a seventh year who hadn’t joined in with the outside activities that evening, was also ready for bed and allowed a hot chocolate too.
What the fuck? Looking up and down the table in hopes it had just been moved, he soon caught Harry’s pointed look and folded arms. His disappointment turned to anger at the injustice.
Draco was still kneeling. Harry was staring at perhaps, the most beautiful ring in his life. It had a flat top like a lot of men's rings, silver, with a line of small diamonds deeply embedded into the metal, ending with a slightly bigger emerald and ruby.
Draco: "You're a dork Potter. A Huffally-puffally Gryffindor, with a hero complex that means you always find fault in your own actions but never blame others. We both have issues, we both get angry. Life isn't always going to be a bouquet of flowers, and when it isn't ... we have to help each other, forgive each other, and accept that perfect is simply a myth."
It was the last thing she said before she left them alone, taking their wands with her at McGonagall's orders.
Harry crashed into Draco so hard he feel bad onto the stone ground. Harry on top of him, kisses him fervently.
“We can’t be that boring sir!” Carlton Anderson stated, a Gryffindor with shoulder length brown hair pushed back from his face.
Draco turned then, shoving Harry’s chest and shouting, “You think you know everything Potter? Think you have it all figured out.” Draco ripped up his sleeve to reveal the fading Dark Mark still tainting his perfect skin. “You say I’m not a Death Eater, but this reminds me every fucking day that I am! Are you blind, or will you still insist that you know better!”
Merlin, there were a lot of maybes. He really should stop trying figure it out before he gave himself an aneurism. It could just be Tau’s belief and nothing more. Tau’s past could easily be something non related to Voldemort, and it was pointless trying to compare Tau to a bloody character in a book.
Harry instantly saw the accusing look McGonagall was directing at Draco, and it didn't sit right with him. Before Draco could dispute her accusation, Harry beat him to it.
Harry thought that he really did sound like Professor Severus Snape. Malfoy’s voice was cold, and the words drawled out angrily. Harry blinked, thinking about the man that once loved his mother – unrequitedly, and Malfoy’s angry words died on the wind unheard. Severus Snape was a link in a chain that resulted in his parent’s death, but was also a link in Voldemort’s down full, the cause of his own still beating heart today, and a brave man that lost his life after giving so much so much of it to aid in the war.
Then Kreacher disappeared, taking Draco with him. Harry shut and locked his door, and headed straight to bed. He would clean up tomorrow. He flopped down on the bed in his clothes, and was out like a light.
Harry saw the glint of grief in Draco’s coin-grey eyes as the blond looked down into his glass of amber liquid.
Hermione went on to explain Easter, and surprisingly her audience were very interested. Seamus, Dean, and Neville also turned to listen. When she finished Draco slipped away.
“That’s not good enough! I demand something better or my father will hear about this!” Draco threatened. He hissed as his right foot started smarting from the frosty sensation that was growing there.
“Of being turned down?” Harry asked. Draco just nodded. “If he’s smart then he won’t. If he does then he is a fool that doesn’t deserve you!”
dressed, if you could call it that, but it looked as if he’d been dressed by a three-year-old. In fact, no! He’d seen three-year-olds dress better. It also appeared that Harry hadn’t gotten much sleep, if the redness of his half-closed eyes were anything to go by.
Hermione: "Malfoy? Do you think you might love him? You're going to have to choose what you want, or more specifically ... who you want."
He felt like he was standing on the edge of cliff. One way led to a massive drop - where he may or may not hit the safety of the water, if he did hit the water, he could swim through the difficult currents towards a new island. The other way was dark and cold, filled with whispers of hate, and his father's lessons and beliefs echoing on and on ...
Pansy: "Don't mind him darling. Come, I want to talk to you before we leave – seeing as you won't stay with me over the holidays."
a squib Potter!” Draco nearly shouted as he sat back in his chair, but he caught himself just in time – they were in a muggle coffee shop after all.
“You invited me to get a drink, it is only customary for the one that makes the offer to pay the bill.” Draco smirked. “It is too late to revoke your offer now Potter, so I will see you at lunch.” With that, Draco nodded and closed his door.
have Pancakes and ice-cream when feeling under the weather!” Draco insisted. Sometimes his mother would even ask the house elves to spread a little chocolate onto his pancakes too. His father would complain that Mother spoiled him, but he let her do it regardless… his parents loved him.
It had been nearly two weeks since Harry punched that Ravenclaw student - luckily, Harry gotten in trouble nothing was even said. Suffice to say, not one Ravenclaw said anything to either of them since then.
“I think … I think that he is right. I think that once we were all on your team, we should have attacked instead of goaded Mr Malfoy. Or, we should have at least used that time to strengthen our shields and defences. Only a few us were needed to take down Mr Malfoy, Lilium and Josephine, the rest of us could have stayed behind barricades or shields and acted as back up.”
They laid there enjoying the colour changes of the sky, feeling the autumn breeze. It was as if a soothing blanket had been draped over him – something calm and grounding after the difficult topic of Horcruxes he’d just endured, and he suspected that it had something to do with man lying beside him now.
It had the desired effect Harry was hoping for, and he smirked when Draco shuddered at the thought. The blond didn’t look happy though, more petulantly resigned to the fact he wouldn’t be having more chocolate today, and he acted like a reprimanded child. Harry chuckle.
Harry had been so excited last night that he hadn't slept, therefore, he found himself dozing off on the train soon after boarding. Hermione and Ron did't wake him - they were in favor of making out on the seats opposite, however, Harry woke with a start from images of dead Hogwarts students - Hermione and Ron instantly in caring friend mode.
No! Any relationship with Potter would only be a doomed; the media, the accusations that would be thrown his way, the ruin it would cause to Potter’s reputation… not to mention the attention it would cause – attention that Potter hated so vehemently, and that he-himself really didn’t need right now either…
Harry looked back at Draco, having failed to see any writing materials left out, and realised Draco was giving him a very suspicious look. “I could have, yes. But… erm… it’s just…” He closed his mouth – he was ruining this! ‘
Harry muttered, as he and Draco walked towards the courtyard together. They were going back to their 8th year dormitory to try and find their friends. They had memories of them, and spending time with them, but it was a like a dream instead of reality.
“I know it won’t be easy Draco, but it’s the only way. Silas turns seventeen in January, January fourth, right?” Harry asked, Draco nodded. “He will be an adult then, but still a student. He can consent to viewing the memories, and if he doesn’t, we contact the Aurors then. Please just let me try to get through to him.”
Pissed and humiliated, Harry stormed from the hall - ignoring whoever was calling his name.  Draco followed him outside and grabbed his arm, trying to make him stop for a minute.
“That…” Another loud sniff from Draco before he continued. “That has nothing to do with carrying a part of his soul in your head, or being able to see through his eyes!”
Harry wanted to laugh – the cheeky bastard was practically lying by omission, and he was cleverly leading him to make false assumptions to protect his own dignity, but the realisation of who Tau was likely to be… well, it was overwhelmingly confusing and ringing in his mind like warning sirens.
Draco reverted he gaze from such temptation, to the seventh-year essays that were scattered upon his small dining table. He’d been working on the last one when Harry had come pounding on his door again with his demands, but it could wait until later.
He thought. Maybe he could do some research and- No! That was against the rules of Le'Amortentia. He'd signed to promise that he would not actively try and find information on his Chérie that could lead to the discovery of his identity or address. It still itched inside him to break the rules, but that would also be a betrayal of trust. Not to mention that, now he'd signed to say he would do no such thing, he'd be fined and charged with stalking and misuse of date.
Hopefully, it would be enough. He had no desire to be cold with the man, but he had been more reserved and careful with his words. It was the constant whisper of
Over the last three weeks, he had grown used to having someone to talk to that didn’t know him for the ‘boy-who-lived’. He thought they were developing a real connection between them, one that promised a possibility of a face to face meeting one day. The thought that it was all just suddenly over, hurt in ways he wouldn’t have expected at all; he felt lonely and disappointed - a sense of dejection twisted with perplexity shadowed over him, and it was as if he was grieving for man he had never met.
“Could you please get me a dinner Kreacher … and possibly a book that accurately explains what the Snowflu is and what Sonixies are?” He added, killing two bords with one stone, so to speak.
“Please.” Nodded Draco, sitting down on one of the dark blue armchairs that Harry had kept since their firewhisky night.
“I don’t wish to talk about them!” Harry cut him off sharply. He drunk from his glass and then smiled. “So, what about Padfoot? You at least have him to write sweet nothings too.”
Maybe Tau wanted to see if he would forgive Elliot, because if he did then that would mean he would forgive Tau. Again, maybe he was just reading into all this, trying to hard to compare Elliot with Tau, but he knew what he wanted to write back.
Tau had never pretended to be perfect, to have a shiny past or pretend to be an angel. Tau was scared that his past would ruin whatever they were to build between them - whether that be friendship or eventually lead to more. All Tau was asking for, was a promise that he didn’t forget that Tau’s present actions shouldn’t be distorted by the knowledge of his actions in the past. That Harry didn’t find out about what he had done and slam the door in his face. There was also the subtle hint that Tau would find sharing his past difficult, and would only do so if he had the courage.
He had been so close – they were due to meet each other soon, but Harry Potter had ruined his only chance at happiness. Yet, he was angry because he could not blame Potter. It was his past that had ruined it, and it was his own growing love for Harry that had opened his eyes to the lie that would become of any relationship with another… even someone as wonderful as Padfoot.
-Lessons begin, gossip travels of Draco with Harry, and then ... Potions lesson. Draco walks in smiling at him.
However, what Tau said also seemed to make sense – that it wasn’t time that reminded him of the past, it was in fact memories trigged by something or another. The summer heat - especially near gardens, always reminded him of the long hours he’d spent weeding his Aunt’s garden, the fact he’d had to return to them at all, and the remaindered that it was the summer holiday after his fifth year that he mourned for his Godfathers murder alone. Halloween in August, always reminded him of the day his parents died and he became an orphan. May day always reminded him of the battle of Hogwarts, and the day he lost many people to the war. Even though it was a particular time of year that reminded him of these things usually, it wasn’t time itself doing the reminding.
I were to like someone it is none of your business Potter! I demand you change the subject!” Draco hid his embarrassment behind the action of drinking his own coffee.
Harry had paused during the writing of the message he had just sent, remembering what he had written in his own profile – the one Tau would have read before accepting him as a secret chérie:
“My Gryffindors. Why am I not surprised?” Harry shook his head and sighed. “What did they do this time?”
“Auror Graves is speaking with Minerva, he requests your presence.” Draco cut to the chase before Harry could even greet him. “Immediately!”
Harry sent it off with a small, smug little smile, before resting his head back on his puffed-up pillows and leaving the parchment and quill on the right side of the bed next to him. He wondered if Tau liked puffed up pillows, or maybe he liked thinner ones.
Harry didn't say anything, he knew Draco was right. A single tear fell from his eye as he nestled close to the boy - the man that he loved, that kept the darkness from consuming him. He wasn't sure what
“It’s a symptom of the Snowflu.” Harry explained. “It will pass in a moment. Here!” Harry took the corner of the blanket, wrapped it around Draco’s right hand, and added the strongest warming charm he could.
“Of course, Master Potter.” Kreacher bowed and vanished, leaving Harry to re-read his message from Tau – from Draco?
“Mmm” Harry nodded. “I need to go and speak with Minerva this morning, but I wondered if you fancied getting a drink in the Three Broomsticks after lunch?”
“Wait here Mr Bartlett.” Harry instructed, using wandless magic to unlock Draco’s door. Samuel just nodded, but his eyes widened with slight concern.
century, was bitten by a vampire - Raynould Euanes to be exact. Vlad was a wizard that declared genocide against all vampires because one turned his brother. Vlad killed his brother, believe him to be dead already, but then Raynould turned Vlad as a punishment. Vlad went mad with rage; attacked the Ottoman empire – which was infiltrated by vampires, and Vlad got himself killed. He was a vampire for a few short weeks, and they found his decapitated remains scattered on the battlefield after the Ottomans cut up his corpse. The ministry at the time, failed to erase the memory of all the muggle witnesses: a few slipped away with their memories intact, and thus, Dracula stories were warped and pasted down as mere stories in the muggle world.”
“Come in Mr Potter.” Draco moved aside and gestured him in. It was obvious that Draco was referring to him in the formality because they had an audience of students.  “I was just dismissing the class.  You can wait at my desk.” Draco pointed to his chair behind the teacher’s desk.
He had to come clean, and soon! It wasn't fair on Draco to believe in a man that didn't exist, and it would be less painful for himself to know where he stood after the truth came out. If Draco didn't asked Padfoot to meet him over Christmas, he would ask him himself in the New Year.
-Ron - who is constantly hating on Draco, ends up with  a goblet of pumpkin juice in the face - courtesy of Harry.  Draco follows Harry as he storms out of the Great Hall.
Harry kissed Draco agian, a peck, a tease - then he continued walking. It took a full three seconds before Draco hurried after him. Before Draco could say something clever, Harry spoke first.
“Malfoy!” Harry beat him to salutations. He didn’t want any trouble, so he instantly chastised himself for his immediate defensive tone.
He repeated those words to himself over and over again – while his stomach repelled the last of his Christmas dinner, while he violently brushed his teeth and stared at his own reflection in the mirror, while he showered away the feeling of being violated, and while he marked homework and essays with a very strong mug of coffee.
Harry didn't look remorseful at all, but Draco was sure he didn't mean it - It still fucking hurt though.
Draco had stopped just ahead of Harry. He regretted his last words. He'd begged Harry for a chance and now he'd ruined it. He turned to see Harry, watched as he turned around and walked away from him. The look in Harry's face broke his heart, and his feet started following him automatically.
Harry literally chocked on his food, Ron quickly slapping his back ... harder than necessary, but it worked - the un-chewed potato flew across the table. Harry didn't know what was worse, Ginny's statement, or the fact she said it so matter-of-fact. Molly looked between her children and Harry, trying to decide if Ginny was joking or not.
“Why not. I need to make a stop at Ceridwen's Cauldrons anyway.” Draco agreed. “Miss Briana Payne has exploded more cauldron’s already then Longbottom did during his entire school, and Mrs Allaway promised to order in some potion ingredients for me.” Draco explained, and Harry wondered if he was using his need to visit Hogsmeade to avoid the truth – that yes, he would very much enjoy having a drink in Harry’s company.
She led Harry to another room - similar to the reception room in fact, but this one actually had two comfortable purple and black fleur-de-lis couches and an oval glass table between them. The windows were most certainly charmed in this room, seeing as they were against an inside wall yet still glowed as if the sun was passing through them.
Oh, yes – Draco’s fidgeting, that slight blush along his pale cheek bones, and the way his pure-blooded vocabulary failed him made this all worth it. It was rewarding watching Draco Malfoy lose that pure-blooded mask of his.
Harry turned the notebook over and waited for Draco to agree or disagree to the oath. But Draco took out his wand and nodded.
Despite his shock at everything he’d learnt, he blushed again when reading the obvious innuendo of anal intercourse outside in nature, and the accusation that he was ‘demure and humble’ because he preferred to keep his clothes on when outside. He also didn’t want to think about Tau’s – possibly Draco’s - ‘morning trek’, especially not when naked moonlight basking was their last topic of conversation – well, that and absorbing magic from nature while denude of all apparel.
Harry saint fucking Potter! That now he realized, wasn't all that whole and perfect. He was still shocked that the entire world were oblivious to Harry's upbringing, his difficulties, and the emotional scars he carried. He had assumed Harry had everything he needed growing up and more. Harry always looked so happy, and always put others first. Even he had missed the darkness to Harry's life -  that the boy had obviously hid so well from others.
“Bloody hell Draco!” Harry panicked for a moment before mentally slapping himself. He’d just have to bite his tongue and remove Draco’s top!
Fuck! His conflicting emotions were whirling. He was a little angry that Draco had just walked in… and hadn’t he locked his door last night? He wanted to shout at Draco to piss off, to express his vexation regarding Draco’s lack of common courtesy – you didn’t just let yourself into someone else’s private rooms when the door was locked! Yet, despite his embarrassment, the man he had come to love – even if it was unrequited, was comfortable enough to take such liberties – what did that mean? If only Draco was here for other reasons though… actually, why was he here? It
Merlin, who knew Draco could be such a sap? It was all rather confusing, and the mess he had landed himself… Well, not really knowing what to say, he quickly settled on sending a short message and Christmas greeting, before darting into his bathroom:
Yes, it was definitely 6pm that Draco intended on arriving. He had ten minutes until he showed up - to decided if he should prepare coffee or not as well, but Harry found himself frowning at Draco’s handwriting instead. It looked very familiar the way his O’s looked like small hair curls, or the way his M’s looped in the middle, but he couldn’t place why it looked so familiar. Maybe it was familiar to a student’s handwriting, that would probably be it.
mind creates in its pain, that gives me the strength to ‘wake up’ and deal with it the best I can. The calming draughts help - stop me from passing out at the very least, and they help me to focus on reality. I dunno. I’ve always been good at ignoring pain, fighting anything that wants to take control of me, but… I guess… well, you being here helps too.” He gave Draco a small smile.
Draco: "Especially because he is my father. I'd rather not talk about my useless parents Potter, tell me, where are you staying over Christmas?"
"Ah, right, yeah… erm … he's worried that he won't be good enough to get in. Andromeda only had enough to buy him a second-hand broom, so he only has his Nimbus 2000."
Harry looked back over to see that Draco look pale with nerves as he watched him holding the gift. The slight movements the blond man made, made Harry believe he was forcing himself not to fidget. Harry was very curious to what Draco could have gotten him from France, but the fact that Draco was so nervous… well, it made him slightly nervous too.
"Discourteous, uncouth prats!" Draco sneered as he was bumped into for the hundredth time. He would have been granted a wide berth had his appearance remained the one he had been born with, but it wasn't worth the verbal and physical abuse an ex-Death Eater would be subjected too. Yes, he would have been avoided by most, in fear and disgust, but those that felt justice had not met…
“Well, not much can be done about it, the boy turns seventeen sometime in January.” Harry shook his head and sighed, deciding to change the subject. “I came to see if you could brew a few potions I’ll need for my lessons in a few weeks.”
The snow was charmed red for Harry’s team, and green for Draco’s – a nice idea of one Professor Filius Flitwick. If you were hit, you joined the team you were last hit by, and so far, Harry’s team were winning. They had started with even teams: Harry’s team having Neville and nine students, Draco with Filius and nine students... but now Draco was left with only two Slytherin students, and they were hiding behind charmed snow.
Draco just followed Harry with tears streaming down his face, broken sobs rocking his chest, and the pain of over ten years’ suppressed emotions and every ounce of guilt he carried drowning him. Draco had giving up right now, and was at Harry’s mercy. They walked to just beyond Hogwarts gates, and then Harry pulled Draco to his chest and disapparated them both away.
Harry had shouted at Draco, and fled the bathroom. Draco followed him, grabbing him agian - but this time ... he kissed Harry.
“You certainly enjoyed it though.” Harry said, standing in the way of the door – preventing Draco from closing it.
Harry: "I don't believe that. I think this curse is ... making us reveal things we wouldn't otherwise admit, but it's not without some truth."
“Just making sure you know that I’m not judging you.” Harry said, then he realised they were attracting onlookers outside the coffee shop. “Walk with me! We’re attracting attention.” Harry then started to walk, hopeful that Draco would follow him.
“It looks to be in order. I’ll read it over later and start the copy. Is your mother doing okay?” Harry asked, being polite. A part of him kept whispering that Narcissa could become something of a mother in law to him if Draco didn’t kill him first for being Padfoot. Draco still hadn’t asked Padfoot to meet, and Harry was a nervous wreck every time he received a new message on the Le’Amortentia parchment.
Harry frowned, wondering what to say to that. He was just about to answer when he realised Draco was leaving the Great Hall. Harry quickly chased after him, muttering - “excuse me” to the teachers at the table. He ignored the student’s curious looks as he bolted from the Great Hal after their potions teacher, and caught up to Draco in the hallway.
