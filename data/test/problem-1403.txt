Before I could do anything else, the doors behind me flew open. Ron and Hermione came barging into the room, Ron's wand held in his hand. “I know you two are having relationship problems, but what did you do to him?!" He yelled, training his wand at me.
I closed the door and went around the car. I climbed into the car and started the car. Draco slumped in his seat as I pulled from the parking lot. He staring snoring at I drove down the street. I glanced at him from time to time, but otherwise I kept my gaze on the road as I drove back to Malfoy Manor.
“Goods morning, Master Harry. Will yous be joining the others fors breakfasts this morning?" He asked as he finished tucking the blanket under the pillows.
I flinched when I saw his eyes. They were red and puffy, as if he'd been crying. He noticed my stare and quickly looked away from me. “Just leave me alone, Malfoy."
“I brought an extra set of clothes with me. They were shrunk down in my pocket. If you hadn't made a move last night, I would have," I said, shamelessly letting my eyes travel over his naked chest.
“Well, I see that your drinks are empty, so I'll go get you some more," she said. With that she turned and walked back to the bar.
“What happened?" Ron asked. He looked at us for a moment, then said, “I just want to know how he got the bruise."
Without a word, the waitress turned around and practically ran to the kitchen. Ron's laughter broke through. Draco and I joined in with our own laughter. “Merlin, that was funny. How thick could she be? You two were holding hands on top of the bloody table."
Charlie ignored him and looked directly at me. “You need to tell my brother about your relationship. If you don't, I will, and I won't hesitate to tell the Prophet about you and Malfoy either!" He snapped.
“That's because the scars on Draco's chest are long since healed, he didn't see them when they were fresh. Draco, is it safe to assume that this is the first time he's seen your wrists since it happened?"
I went around the bed and crawled in behind him. He immediately rolled over and snuggled up against me, his arm draped over me and his head rested against my chest. I wrapped my arm around his shoulders and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “I love you," I whispered.
“So, does anyone want to play anymore games, or are we ready to go to our next phase?" I asked everyone.
“Alright Carlos, talk. Where is Harry hiding? I know you know," Hermione said, opening her eyes and pushing away from the wall.
I shook my head. “Like me, she'll understand. All Mother wants is for us to be happy, and if we have to slow down to get there, then she's going to support our decisions."
Draco began slowly, pulling his hips back before sliding forward again. He kept his hand gliding up and down my shaft. “Draco, more," I whimpered. He obeyed instantly, snapping his hips forward and burying himself to the hilt. He began thrusting faster and harder. He dropped his hand away from my dick and caught my hips in both hands, dragging me against him. I wrapped my own fingers around my shaft and jerked in rhythm to his thrusts.
“If it's my mother, I don't want to see her. I don't want another lecture about my stupid behavior. I get it; I was very stupid," I said and turned back to the window. I knew the image in the window was false; all the windows in St. Mungo's Hospital were enchanted to look like they were looking out over a massive lake.
“How can you say that? Don't you remember when you asked me about you dating other people? It pissed me off and I didn't answer you for almost ten minutes," he said. He looked down at the guitar next to him, before he looked back up at me.
“Yes. Draco has cut himself a few times over the years. Mainly because of Lucius telling him that he was worthless, and that he was a disgrace to the Malfoy name. Look, Harry, if you don't want to see my memories, you don't have to. I just thought I'd help you with Draco," Narcissa said.
The four of them began making their way towards us. “Smile Harry. Don't let Draco know what's really going on in your head," Hermione whispered.
“That reminds me, should I be worried about the gift he brought?" I asked looking over to the large pile of presents on the table near the windows.  George's gift was easy to spot; the hideous purple wrapping paper with the gold letters stuck out like a sore thumb.
“You have been taking tables in my section all day. I know you want to make money, but so do I. I don't want to report you again."
“Good evening Mr. Malfoy. Want your usual tonight?" Marko asked when I finally reached the end of the bar. He held out his beefy hand.
I placed my breakfast tray aside, removed the blanket from my lap, and stood up. Since I wasn't eating anyway, there was no point in delaying visiting Narcissa like she asked me to. I twisted on the spot and apparated outside the door of her study. I took a breath, before knocking on the door. “Come on in, Harry," I heard her call out.
I took a breath and slowly pulled my finger out. When just the tip of my finger was still inside him, I gently slid it back in. He groaned deep in his throat and began to thrust himself against my finger. Encouraged by his actions, I began to move my finger a little faster in his hole. Suddenly, it wasn't enough for me; I wanted more. I pulled my finger completely out of him and then shoved two fingers back in. Harry gasped and his legs spread out a little more, giving me more access to his hole.
I glanced over her shoulder to where Draco was still standing, still looking down at his feet. “Why did you bring him?" I asked, trying to keep the venom out of my voice. I rubbed a hand against my bare chest.
I thought to myself as I rubbed a towel against my hair. I glanced at the robes that were on my bed. I was preparing to head to St. Mungo's Hospital to visit Hermione and her newborn baby. I glanced at my watch. Ron would be arriving in about a half hour to take me to Hermione's room at St. Mungo's.
A small crackle of magic began to form around the room. I glanced at Harry and noticed his eyes had narrowed. “No, Lucius. You're the one who ruined your family's reputation. Just like you're the one who tore your family apart. You're just embarrassing yourself right now," he said in a dangerously low voice. Kingsley and the Aurors shifted uncomfortably as his magic crackled around us.
“Harry," I called excitedly as soon as I stepped out of Neville's fireplace and into his living room.
“Dean? Is there something that you're not saying about this?" I asked. He tensed slightly, before looking over at me.
Narcissa spends a day showing Harry some of her memories so that he better understands Draco. He learns just what life was like in Malfoy Manor.
“Alright you two. You don't need to embarrass my husband. Come on, I have dinner ready. I made spaghetti," Hermione said, appearing in the kitchen doorway.
“Harry, faster. Please," Draco moaned. He began thrusting his hips up into my hand. I did as he asked and I picked up the pace. I began sliding my hand up and down his shaft faster as I thrust myself faster into his body. I felt him beginning to tense as his orgasm approached.
“Not since last night. I looked for your glasses when I got up, but I couldn't find them. I honestly have no idea where they landed when I took them off your face."
“I'm a little nervous right now. No one has ever seen what's behind these doors. You will be the first person that's not family to ever see it."
He stared a moment longer, then stood up and pulled the trousers to his waist. He left them unfastened and reached for the light grey shirt. He pulled it on, and quickly buttoned it. As he tucked the shirt into his waistband, I noticed the perfect way the shirt fit him; snug against his chest and biceps, loose around his waist. A perfect fit for his body. He fastened his trousers and reached for his belt. He looked up and caught me staring at him. A smile appeared on his lips.
“Not at all, Harry dear. At least someone is thinking about her," Mrs. Weasley said. She raised her wand, and a tray appeared in the air next to me.
Harry chuckled. “Oh, before I forget, I have something for you," he said. He leaned across the car and opened his glove compartment. Without taking his eyes off the road, he reached into the glove compartment and pulled out a sealed scroll. He dropped the scroll into my lap and straightened up in his seat, placing his hand back on the steering wheel.
“And Draco's now the second one to puke. What a way to ruin the day," Pansy complained from somewhere behind me.
“Sometimes he was much worse, as you'll find out. Sometimes his abuse to Draco would be verbal, sometimes physical, sometimes both," Narcissa replied. As the new memory swirled around us, another thought came to my mind.
The fire flickered, the glow producing small shadows around us. The last of my boxes laid forgotten on the floor as Draco and I lost ourselves in each other.
I sighed as he pressed his lips to mine. I pulled away quickly. “Hang on Harry," I said and tightened my grip on his hand. I twisted and we disapparated again. We landed in front of a large set of double doors. The doors were nothing special; they were a deep grey and had serpents for door handles. I paused and turned to Harry.
“I know what I said, but he won't accept my apology now, not after I went on a date with Chase," I said, feeling bile in my throat at the admission.
Our tongues danced against each other, in a sensual battle of dominance, with Harry seeming to come out the victor. I slid my hand up from his hip and ran it across his back. I could feel the scars that crossed his skin. I pulled myself closer to him, and pushed my hips against his. My erection brushed against his. I moaned softly against his lips.
“Mr. Potter. Yes, he told me he was expecting you. Please, follow me," he said. He stepped out from behind the bar and headed up the flight of stairs to his left. I followed him, unsure of where he was going. We went up two flights of stairs and then he led me down a hall and stopped at the last door on the right hand side. He knocked on the door. “Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy is here," he called.
I didn't move until he reached up and pulled me down for another kiss. “You can move now. Your not hurting me," he whispered against my lips.
I thought about that for a moment. This was Narcissa Malfoy, wanting to bear her soul to me and show me things about her son that I couldn't possibly imagine. I really wanted to understand what Draco had been like before, but still I hesitated; I really wasn't too comfortable with viewing Narcissa's personal memories, even with her permission.
“I don't know. But right now, I can't be in the same room with you," he said. He stepped towards the door.
“Harry, you've told me before that your uncle referred to your magic as an abnormality. How is that abuse?"
Harry glanced around at the Muggles who were enjoying the park around us, then lowered his voice. “Now probably isn't the best time to explain what an arcade is. How about Hermione explains it to you when we're in the vehicles?" He asked me. I nodded in understanding.
I felt Draco stiffen slightly next to me. “Yeah, I got my things. We were there on Sunday," I said. I put down the chunk of sandwich I was holding, my appetite disappearing.
“How could you do this to Harry? Harry loves you! I'm gonna make sure that you can't hurt him!" He yelled, before spinning on his heel and running down the corridor.
“What the Hell was that about?" I asked, coming to a halt about ten feet from him. I folded my arms across my chest. Blaise didn't answer, or acknowledge my presence. He just continued staring out the open doors.
Draco glanced at me with one eyebrow arched. I shook my head and he turned back to the house elf. “Whatever you make for us will be perfect, Poppy," he said. She nodded again and disappeared with a small crack.
“You can count on it," he said. He walked over to me, bent down, and pressed his lips to my cheek. He straightened up and took a step back. He twisted on the spot and was gone.
“Fuck, Harry, stop teasing," I panted. I felt him grin around my shaft, then I gasped as he took me completely into his mouth. He began a slow rhythm; first dragging his mouth up my shaft until he almost completely removed me from his mouth, then sliding back down to my base, sucking gently the entire time. I moaned, and dropped back to the bed, my arms no longer supporting me.
“I got it, Krista," Harry's voice said. I glanced towards the sound of his voice and saw him walking around the end of the bar, his black hair now pulled back into a small ponytail. He moved quickly towards the end of the bar where I was sitting. He reached up and pulled down a glass tumbler. He filled it with ice. Krista stared at him as he dumped ice in a black metal shaker. He began grabbing different bottles of liquor and pouring various amounts from each bottle into the shaker. He put the lid on the shaker and began shaking it up. After a few seconds, he opened the shaker and poured it into the tumbler. He passed it to the man before Krista finally found her voice.
“Damn it, Draco! Stop talking like that! You say that no one can love you; well I do damn it!" Harry snapped at me.
We landed roughly, my feet sliding on the rug in front of the fireplace, and Draco stumbled out of my grasp. I caught him before he fell. We stared at each other for a moment, then I dropped my arms. I leaned down and pressed a quick kiss to his lips.
“Guilt Magic, as I said before, is a very rare form of magic. It only affects those with creature blood, when they have caused irreparable damage to someone they love." Here, Dean's eyes flickered to me, before he spoke again. “Guilt Magic causes them to relive the pain they caused someone by turning the pain back on them. His magic is basically turning against him."
I sighed and glanced at the clock on the wall. Charlie said ten minutes, so that's what I was going to do. I walked back into the kitchen and picked up our mugs off the table. I stepped over to the sink and turned on the tap. I let the water warm up before I stuck the mugs under the stream of water to rinse them out. I shut off the tap and turned the mugs upside down in the dish rack.
This chapter alternates between Harry's and Draco's view. It starts with Draco and goes to Harry after he leaves Draco's room.
“Well, it all started the day Rose was born. After I left the room, I was heading to the Apparation room. I wasn't looking where I was going, and I literally ran into Draco."
“I know I can heal it. However, it does require me to put my hands on you. For my Healer's magic to work, I literally have to touch the injured area. I won't help you unless I have your express permission."
I closed my eyes, picturing the streets of Diagon Alley. I twisted on the spot and disapparated with a small pop.
“And I forgave myself. But you asked if my dreams about you were nightmares. The only time it was a nightmare was when I remembered that day." His hand covered mine and squeezed it.
“Sir, can I ask how Patrick was doing? I know you went to check on him when Linda led us to the interrogation room," Harry said.
“Let's start with an order of chili queso dip, no pico," Harry said. Kyle walked away to place our order.
“But, can't he still make you get married to a pureblood witch? He is still the head of the Malfoy family," Harry said.
I smiled slightly and leaned into Harry's embrace as he began placing kisses along my jaw. He moved down my neck and nuzzled the chain of my necklace. “Oh, cut it out you two. We don't all need to see that," Ron said. He had crossed the floor and now stood near us.
Harry hesitated for a moment, then extended his hand towards me. As soon as I touched his skin, he breathed out a sigh. I felt his magic stabilize almost instantly. I studied his hand, noticing how much it had swollen. “Damn Harry. You hit him harder than you hit Charlie. Your palm is swollen," I said as I placed my palm over his.
“I can make one for around three thirty this afternoon. Floo directly into my office and I'll escort you there," he said. He stood up from the floor and sat back down in his chair.
“Draco got sick after getting off the ride. So, we're going to cut short our time here and go onto the next phase of our day," Harry said. He stood, before reaching out a hand and helping me to my feet.
“Be quiet, Charlie! If you won't answer me, then let him," I growled, raising my wand a little bit. He snapped his mouth shut. I turned back to Marcus. “Now tell me, what's going on here," I said to him.
Hermione suddenly raised her wand and pointed it towards Harry. “Stupefy," she said. Harry's body went limp with the stunning spell. I looked over at her. She just shrugged.
I nodded. Draco rubbed his hand briefly against my thigh once more, then he placed his hand back on the table, before he could get us in trouble. He reached for his glass of water. A lock of his blonde hair fell across his cheek. I reached over and brushed it behind his ear with my fingers.
I recoiled as if he had slapped me. “I would never do that. But you seem to be getting pretty defensive right now!" I yelled.
“Normally, I would use the visitor's room, but after what you just told me, I want Lucius in chains. Now, please take Mr. Potter and young Mr. Malfoy to the interrogation room. I'll catch up shortly."
“Can I ask why you don't work here all the time? I saw your skills when you healed my hip. Your an amazing healer."
“Look, this table is big enough to hold four people. It's not like you have to sit right next to me," Potter said, turning his head to look out the window.
His eyes traveled over to the mahogany desk on the other side of the room. Next to my desk, was a floor to ceiling bookcase, completely full. His eyes passed over where my violin stood in a glass case next to the full length windows. He paused for a moment. “You play?" He asked, indicating the violin with a nod of his head. I nodded. He went back to examining my room, and I noticed that he was looking anywhere else but at the king-sized bed that stood in the center of my room. My bed gave evidence of me being a former Slytherin; a large green canopy covered the top and deep green curtains hung around it.The comforter was a silver color and so were the silk sheets beneath it. There were even dark green pillows on the bed.
He looked into my eyes for a moment. “I want you to say what it is that you want. I need to hear it out loud."
“Yes. Once we leave Diagon Alley, no magic will be allowed. I've even agreed to let Hermione use a special spell that restricts the wandless magic I can do," Harry said.
I kissed my way up his leg, along his hipbone and across his stomach. I pulled back and placed a kiss to the head of his dick. He moaned. I planted open-mouth kisses along his length, occasionally letting my tongue slide around it. I brought myself back to the head. I wrapped the fingers of my right hand around the base of his dick and sealed my mouth around the head, sucking slightly.
“I do love you, Harry. Please, give me a chance. I promise this isn't what it looks like. I have no interest in Blaise like that," I said. I could feel the tears begin to fall from my eyes.
I poured the tea, adding sugar to my mug. I glanced up at him and he nodded. I added sugar to his and then added a splash of cream to both mugs. I tapped them both with my wand to stir the tea. I passed one mug to him. He plucked it off the table and took a sip.
“Yes, you do. Your shoes are over by the desk," I said. He moved over to the desk and sat in the chair. I pulled out my wand and waved it at the bed. Instantly, the sheets and comforter were completely cleaned and pressed, the comforter rising off the floor and sliding across the bed. I turned back to Harry and found that he had his shoes on. I let my eyes travel over him once more, discovering that I had correctly chosen clothes for him.
“I don't see why we can't just tell them. I mean, they knew you were gay. They now know I'm gay. If they can accept that, then surely they could accept us being together," I said, taking another sip of my tea.
I turned towards the voice to find Healer Shawnna Love standing in my doorway. Her white Healer's robes and long black hair made her pale skin look almost as pale as mine. She stared at me, her blue eyes bright and full of concern. She had become my favorite Healer, always making sure I was comfortable.
I heard Blaise behind me, but I didn't focus on that. I watched as Ron made it to the foyer and disappeared through the door. I put on a burst of speed, trying to reach him. When I entered the foyer, I saw that I was too late. On the other side of the room, Ron placed his hand on Harry's arm to get his attention. Harry looked at him and when Ron started whispering to him, Harry shook his head and glanced in my direction.
“No, I will not move. I still want to talk about what's going on right now," I said. He took a step towards me. I backed up closer to the door.
Harry didn't respond, but he began to pick up his pace, sliding in and out more quickly. I gasped when his hand slid between our bodies and his fingers wrapped around my dick. He began fisting my shaft, sliding up and down my length in perfect rhythm with each of his thrusts. I moaned loudly and thrust my hips upwards into his hand. He tightened his fingers on my shaft and moved his hand a little faster.
I glanced around the room. Charlie was at the stove stirring a large pot of oatmeal. Mr Weasley stood next to him mixing a big batch of scrambled eggs, occasionally flicking his wand to keep the bacon moving. Ron was toasting slices of bread with his wand. Ginny and George were busy setting the table. I didn't see Mrs. Weasley, Percy, or Hermione, but I could hear their voices from the other room.
“It's getting better. I was doing pretty good until everyone decided to floo here instead of apperating. Then all the ash and soot made me want to vomit," she said. She caught my hand and moved it to the left. Almost immediately, I felt a little nudging underneath my hand. I couldn't stop the smile that broke across my face.
After several tense moments, Harry's fireplace burst to life with green flames. Shawnna stepped through, and with a flick of her wand, her robes were completely cleaned. As she stepped closer to the bed, Harry's magic began to crackle around him, and within seconds, he was removed from the stunning spell Hermione had hit him with. He started thrashing harder, and he screamed again. Shawnna rushed forward flicking her wand several times. Chains appeared out of nowhere, working around Harry's body, holding him down.
“Harry, I think your boyfriend is getting tired," Steve's voice said to me as I was sweeping the floor.
Silence met his statement. I glanced around the room and saw that everyone was staring at me. When Ron saw me looking, he looked away. I couldn't take the hurt expression on his face. After another glance, I noticed that no one was able to meet my gaze. I fought back a sob.
“I'm assuming that in his mind, he actually felt the wounds cutting through his body. His magic made him believe the wounds were real, and I bet that if he had opened his eyes during that time, they would have become real. But that's just a guess on my part," Dean said, rubbing his hand through his hair. I noticed that he was biting his lip as though there was something else on his mind.
“That's because I parked it in the lawyer's parking lot across the street. It doesn't stand out over there," I answered as we made our way out the door. It was a beautiful sunny day, but still a little chilly for the beginning of April. It was actually colder than when Draco and I had had our first date.
We drove in silence for a while after that. I studied him carefully; his eyes never left the road, but every now and then his knuckles turned white when he tightened his grip on the steering wheel. It seemed like he was trying to stop himself from reaching out to me.
“Well, I'm not your mother, but I should lecture you about what you did. That is something stupid even in the Muggle world," said an entirely different voice.
Harry grinned at me, then he held out his hand to me. I stepped forward and took his hand. I brought my other hand up and gripped his elbow. He twisted on the spot and together, we disapparated.
He passed around a sugar bowl and a small pitcher of milk. Draco added the right amount of sugar and milk to my mug. I smiled up at him. He slipped his arm back around my shoulders.
“Not in the way your thinking, Malfoy. He went to leave and I stood in his way. He put his hands on my shoulders and pushed me out of his way. My hip hit the corner of a table. It's not a big deal," he explained.
“Harry, I think we need to take you to St. Mungo's today. This is the fifth day in a row that I've found you with your head on the edge of the toilet," he said when I finished puking.
“Harry, how long has it been since you had a cigarette?" Mother asked him, setting her knitting aside.
“Get Out!" I yelled. I took a step forward. I raised my hands and pushed him. He stumbled backwards. “Get Out and never come back! If you ever step inside Malfoy Manor again, I'll make sure the house elves lock you in the dungeons!"
“Well, what did you tell him?" Hermione asked, placing her hand on my right leg where it was placed over my left knee.
“Oh, things are the same. The Carrows are still threatening that one day, a new Dark Lord will rise and finish what Voldemort started. And then today, there was a slight issue between Auror Jensen and..." she paused as her eyes passed over to me, as though noticing me for the first time. Her cheeks darkened and she looked down at her desk.
I stared at the bruise. It was about the size of my hand. It was an ugly purplish black and in the center, there was a puncture wound as though someone had stabbed him.
“What did I tell you? You were never a true Death Eater, Draco. You didn't have the stomach for it," I said, exasperated. I reached out my hand and caught his left arm. I slipped my fingers under his sleeve and gently touched the raised skin of his Dark Mark.
“Did he tell you why we broke up?" I asked, straightening my shirt across my shoulders, and I began to button it.
I opened my eyes and slowly raised my head off the rim of the toilet. Another wave of nausea hit me and I lowered my face back to the toilet as my stomach heaved, emptying the contents from my late night snack. Neville was by my side, gently rubbing his hand across my shoulders.
“Well, when that guy got me from the bathroom, and we returned to the dinning area, why was the stuff on the table rattling around, and why did they stop when I put my arm around you?" I asked. He reached up and brushed my hair away from my face.
“Now, Harry. I'm ready," Draco panted. He pulled his fingers away and laid on his back. He parted his legs, and as I rose over him, I caught one of his legs and pulled it around my hip. I positioned myself at his entrance and thrust into him. His moan was like music to my ears.
I snickered as he stood up. With a wave of his wand, his jacket flew out of the wardrobe and into his hand. He slipped it over his shoulders and tucked his wand into his pocket. He picked up his wallet and car keys from his nightstand. I glanced over what he was wearing.
I stayed on the floor for a moment longer, then I grabbed the table and pulled myself to my feet. My hip was screaming in protest at my movement. I limped over to the closet. I pulled out a jacket. I was going to a bar. I knew I didn't want to be here when Charlie got back.
“Okay, I'm gonna need help from another healer," she said. She raised her wand and a small silvery turtle easily came from her wand. With a small flick of her wrist, the turtle Patronus disappeared. After a couple more moments, the fireplace came to life once again. A man stepped through, and he was someone we all knew. Dean Thomas flicked his wand like Shawnna had, his robes now spotless.
. I thought to it. I focused on Healer Shawnna Love, and the dragon disappeared, taking my message with it.
I walked over to my bed and picked up my trousers. I had just pulled them up to my waist and was fastening them, when a knock sounded on my door. “Mr. Potter, you have a visitor," called the voice of the innkeeper, Tom.
He was chuckling as he took the book from me. He cast a brief spell on it with his wand. “So we can find it later," he said as he tucked the book into the box at his feet. “But seriously, if your finding books that you haven't seen in, what eight months, I guess you don't look at this bookcase very often," he continued.
“For one, don't know where he went. Give me a reason why I should go after him anyway. He's the one who left."
He peaked at me over the top of his book. “Now it won't be a surprise if I tell you about it," he said. He disappeared behind his book again. I waited a moment before leaning over him. He glanced at me briefly and smirked, before turning back to his book.
“Okay. Now is this..." she started to ask, but I cut her off. “Just tell Mr. Hannigan to put it on my tab. Put Mr. Potter's bill on my tab as well."
I slowly made my way to the sink, keeping my eyes on the floor in front of me. I turned on the cold water and splashed it across my face. I shut off the water and grabbed the hand towel hanging on the end of the counter. I patted my face dry, before I finally raising my eyes to the mirror. My eyes were red from crying, my cheeks blotchy. My hair was messy and clung to my forehead.
Charlie stumbled out of the room as Draco placed the box on top of the other two. Draco pulled his wand quickly and aimed it at Charlie. “Stay away from him, Weasley!" He growled.
“No, go ahead and finish your sentence. What exactly happened with my father?" I asked, arching my eyebrow.
“Potter. It's been a while," Marcus Flint said. He didn't seem bothered that I was pointing my wand directly at his chest.
Sanders rose from her desk and led Harry and I through the door on the right. We followed her down the hallway and down a small flight of stairs. She turned left and led us into a small room. There was a small table and a few chairs in the room. A large mirror took up one wall; I knew it was a two-way, so that Kingsley could monitor the prisoners being interrogated. I had actually witnessed my mother's interrogation shortly after the war ended. On the floor, on either side of the table, large iron rings were fastened to the stone floor. The rings ensured that the criminals could be chained down so that they wouldn't be a danger to others in the room.
Joanna turned around and walked away. Harry waited a moment, then growled at the young man, “You didn't have to be mean about it! It probably would have been easier to just let her be our server."
“Well, I guess I can understand that. But, that doesn't exactly explain why I was able to do wandless magic during our first night together. You said I snapped my fingers and the bottle of lubricant flew into my hand."
He began slowly; first sliding himself out of me until just the head of his dick was still inside me, then he would thrust forward, burying himself completely in my body. His rhythm was slow and steady, as if he was afraid of hurting me. “More," I said. He didn't need to be told twice. He grabbed my hips and hauled me against him as he thrust forward. I reached my hand between our bodies and wrapped my fingers around my hardened dick. I began to pump my fist up and down my shaft, keeping perfect rhythm with his thrusts. Before long, we were both moaning, our bodies tightening as our orgasms approached.
“I'm fine, Dempsey," I called. As I heard him walk away, I felt my Healer's magic sliding beneath the surface of my skin. Both wrists were now healed, the cuts just pink lines on my skin. I watched as the lines faded away. I sat down on the floor and slit the left wrist open again. This cut wasn't as deep and healed a little quicker than the previous one.
I couldn't answer her, for at that moment, I was still heaving dryly over the rubbish bin. I straightened up slowly, still feeling like I was going to puke. Harry's cup, and I knew it was his because he was the only who still had liquid in his cup, was suddenly pushed into my hands. I glanced at him briefly, before taking a grateful sip of his lemonade.
“Draco? Draco, honey, are you alright?" Mother asked. Her gentle hands lifted my face from the floor.
I kept my hand moving up and down his shaft, keeping perfect rhythm with each of my thrusts. Harry was moaning beneath me, his muscles tightening around me as his orgasm approached. I felt a burning sensation in my groin as my own orgasm approached.
“No, last night wasn't a dream. At least, I don't think so; my body is pleasantly tender in certain spots. Does that mean you dream about me Harry?" I teased him. I couldn't stop the smile that spread across my cheeks.
“Listen, Harry. Mother showed you those memories, because we wanted you to forget about the guilt you feel. I forgave you a long time ago for the scars on my chest, and you are not responsible for what I did when you left," I said. Harry opened his mouth, but I raised my hand before he spoke. “No, Harry. You don't need to feel guilty about my wrists. Yes, I was hurt that you left me, but there were healthier ways of dealing with it. I resorted back to harming myself, but you aren't responsible for my actions."
Before Hermione could respond, I heard the sounds of feet heading in our direction. We both turned towards the kitchen and much to my disappointment, Jolene was standing there with her breakfast on a tray like mine.
I stepped up to the side of the bed, stiffening slightly as I passed Charlie. I sat down on the edge of the bed. Hermione pulled down the blanket and my heart expanded at the cute little girl I was looking at. Her cheeks were rosy, and she had a full head of bright red hair. Her little eyes were closed. Hermione leaned forward and I instantly made a cradle with my arms. Hermione placed the baby into my arms.
I looked down at the table. “Look, Harry, I know I crossed the line in the bathroom. For some reason, I've wanted to kiss you almost since I sat down. I know you said you're in a relationship, but I couldn't help it. I don't want to ruin your relationship with him. It shouldn't have happened."
Draco raised his eyes to look at me. There was such misery in his eyes, I felt like my heart would break open. I couldn't stop myself from leaning towards him and taking his lips in a gentle kiss. I wrapped my arm around his waist and pulled him off the arm of the chair and into my lap. He curled up against my chest and let his head rest on my shoulder.
I raised my head and shifted away from him to give him room as he rolled over to face me. He propped himself up on his elbow and looked at me. I dropped my gaze and looked at his scars. I whimpered in the back of my throat. Draco reached out and gently cupped my chin and tilted my head so I was looking into his eyes.
I stared at him, utterly confused. He reached up and pulled me down to him, kissing me deeply once again. I relaxed against him as he continued to kiss me. I heard the click of the bottle being opened, then Harry's hand reached between our bodies. I about jumped out of my skin when his fingers closed over my erection, rubbing lube up and down my shaft.
Once we were outside, Harry took a deep breath and seemed to calm down even more. We walked away from the restaurant in silence, his arm still around my shoulders and my arm still around his waist. He took the lead and led me to a park about a block away from the restaurant. He led me over to a bench and we sat down. I thought about what he had said in the restaurant.
I let out a frustrated groan and fell back against the pillows. I closed my eyes as my heart raced and I struggled to get control of my breathing. I heard the sound of fabric hitting the floor, so I assumed that Harry had stripped out of his pajamas and boxers. I felt the bed dip with his weight as he climbed back onto it. I heard the click of the bottle of lubricant as he squeezed more lube on his fingers.
Harry smiled at her. “Connie, can you take my boyfriend Draco inside? I need a cigarette before I get to work."
I awoke to Harry's lips pressing gentle kisses along one of the scars on my chest. I laid perfectly still, not even opening my eyes, as I enjoyed his kisses. His tongue slid across the scar in a slow, gentle caress. Harry shifted lower and let his lips travel over another scar. I fought back a moan, trying not to let him know that I was awake.
“Not sure. Maybe, before I would have said that it's because Mr. Potter is here. But no one's paid him any attention since he got here," Marko answered. His hand reached for the bottle of Firewhisky.
“I'll have a bacon cheese burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and a side of fries," Harry replied. Again, Kyle seemed to write it down.
Hermione tugged on the sleeve of my shirt. I turned around and followed her out the door. Sliding into her car, I felt like I was going to burst into tears. “So, now what?" I asked.
Harry's wand was in his hand and with a muttered spell, both of our bodies were cleaned from our love making.  He levitated his wand back to the nightstand before pulling me into his arms. I snuggled against him, the fingers from one of his hands buried in my hair, while his other hand rubbed up and down my arm.
After about a half hour, we reached the small, pale blue house. I followed Ron as he drove his car around the side of the house to the garage. Ron pulled his car into the garage and I parked in his driveway. When I turned off the engine, Draco suddenly tensed, his hands trembling as he reached for his seatbelt.
“But, how did his magic make the wounds appear, but not actually be there?" Shawnna asked, speaking for the first time since Dean's arrival.
“I'm glad that things have worked out," she said. She glanced at Draco for a moment, a sly smile on her face, then turned her attention back to me. “You know, my son used to fancy you. I swear, as much as he used to talk about you, I'm surprised you two aren't married yet."
“Harry, are you completely sure about this? Completely sure that this is really what you want?You could walk away right now you know. We can forget about it. It's not really worth throwing away your relationship just because you think that he's cheating on you."
He turned from where he was standing next to my fireplace, his robes swirling around his ankles. “Draco, do you not want me to come with you?" He asked. He sounded slightly hurt.
“Hi Hermione, Draco. What can I do for the two of you?" Seamus asked, jumping down from where he had been on a ladder. He looked between us before sitting down at his desk.
“Well, I'll leave you two alone. Harry if you want to start unpacking, feel free to do so," Mother said. She turned away, then turned back to face him. “Oh, this is for you, Harry," she said, pulling out a piece of parchment from her dress pocket.
He began to kiss his way down my body. He ghosted his lips against each scar that marked my chest from the curse he had used back in sixth year. He then shifted his attention and kissed his way down my left arm. I gasped as he pressed his lips against the Dark Mark on my forearm. I tried to pull my arm away, but he caught my wrist. Tears sprang to my eyes as he gently traced his tongue around the Dark Mark. I had never known such tenderness associated with it.
He nodded. “Oh, Harry," I said. I couldn't stop myself from leaning forward and pressing my lips against his cheek. We both froze at the contact, before I came to my senses and pulled away. My cheeks were burning as I turned my attention to picking at a lose thread on the bottom of my shirt. We sat there for several minutes in uncomfortable silence, until Harry started to chuckle.
Pansy and Blaise were gone when I reached the booth. I sat down quickly and pulled the last of my drink to me. I raised the glass to my lips and finished it in one swallow. Josie noticed me and hurried over. “Is everything alright Mr. Malfoy? Your friends left in quite a hurry and you and Mr. Potter have been gone awhile."
Before he could answer, Draco apparated into the apartment. He glanced at us for a moment, where I still knelt on the floor in front of Charlie, shrugged his shoulders, and started to gather more boxes into the fireplace. “Is this everything?" He asked as he grabbed the last box next to the couch.
“Draco, you were raised that you were better than anyone, and yet, you were never the top student in our year. Tell me, who was the one student who was better than you in everything, except potions?" He asked. My cheeks reddened and I refused to look over at Hermione. Harry grinned. “My point exactly. You, a pureblood wizard, were beaten in every class by a Muggle-born witch. That seems to me that your not superior to anyone; we're all equal."
After bowling almost a whole game of nothing but gutter balls, I turned around from my turn on the lane and froze. Draco was sitting on Chase's lap and Chase was pressing kisses against Draco's jaw. I felt like a balloon had burst inside my chest; I felt deflated. My heart ached and I felt tears prickle my eyes; Draco looked like he was enjoying himself. I glanced at the screen and discovered that there was only three frames left of the game. I picked up Hermione's bag, and quickly extracted my wand and phone, then I reached further into the bag and pulled out a Muggle notebook and pen. I glanced around quickly, but none of the others were paying attention to me; Hermione and Pansy had gone to get themselves more drinks, Theo had disappeared into the men's room, Ron was stepping up to take his turn, and Draco was preoccupied with Chase.
“Seriously, Charlie, just give them a chance to get to know each other. I'm sure they would have a beautiful life together," Percy said.
Draco made a growl deep in his throat, twisting his fingers before adding a third finger. I slid my hand up and down his shaft, spreading the lube around. He twisted his fingers again and hooked them, hitting my prostate. I cried out in pleasure and dropped my hand away from his shaft. He immediately slid his fingers from me and lined himself with my entrance. He slid in with one thrust, burying himself deeply. His one hand still around my shaft.
“I noticed last night and right now that you have a far away look in your eyes. Something on your mind?" I reached over and gently grabbed his hand. “You can tell me anything," I said.
He smiled. “Yeah, it's really me, Harry. Good to see you again." With that, he turned and walked away.
Before anyone could say anything else, a woman's voice was calling out to them. Harry, and the others turned. I watched as a young woman with curly dark hair crossed the parking lot towards us. “Connie, you're a customer. You don't have to park in the employee's parking lot every time you come here," Randy said.
“Now that you mention it, I remember that. However, this discussion can wait until later. Mother is waiting for us," I said. I waved my wand at the pile of clothes I had laid out for him when I had gotten up. The clothes flew over to him and landed next to him on the floor. He stared at me for a moment, then looked down at the clothes. He rolled his eyes but stood up with the clothes in his arms. He laid the clothes on the bed and sat down.
I sat there, kinda stunned. His eyes never left mine as he picked up a fry from his platter. He brought it to his mouth and slowly, and deliberately, licked the ketchup from it. I squirmed in my seat, before I slid from the booth and quickly sat down next to him. “Tease," I hissed under my breath.
Once again Narcissa's memory swirled away. I fought back the bile that was rising in my throat. “How could he do that to Draco? How could Lucius treat his own son like he was something disgusting that he had stepped in?" I asked.
The gates swung open. Harry drove through them, turning left onto the road. We drove in silence for a while, Harry easily turning the car onto different roads. “So, where are we going exactly?" I asked, the silence finally getting to me.
Soft lips pressing to the skin of my forehead caused me to wake up much earlier than I wanted to. I dragged my eyes open to find myself flat on my back and Harry on his side next to me. He was leaning over me, working his lips down the side of my face. He trailed his lips down my cheek and slid them down my chin, purposely missing my lips as he made his way down my neck.
“Draco is eight years old here. He accidentally broke the practice broomstick Lucius had bought him. He got a bad spanking from Lucius, thus the tears and his fidgeting," she answered.
“Potter! Have you lost your mind? There's no way I'm putting those on my feet," came the expected whispered hiss as I led the others away from the front counter of the bowling alley.
I raised my wand and cast a spell on the mirror that made my reflection come to life. The reflection began to move. I turned my back and began to undo the buttons on my shirt. “
“Actually, she's doing a lot better. Still not quite ready to go home just yet, but we're getting her there," the medi-wizard answered. He set a sheet of parchment and a quill in front of Draco. He picked up the quill and quickly signed his name on the parchment.
My stomach heaved when another memory showed Lucius once again using the Cruciatus Curse on Draco when he was sixteen because Draco had finally admitted to Lucius that he was gay. Along that same time, Narcissa had stopped him as he cut into his wrists again, babbling about never being good enough to please Lucius. When the memories turned to where Voldemort was living in the Manor, the hatred churned through my stomach when I watched Draco get tortured by Voldemort, and Lucius just stood by and watched without any emotion on his face. I couldn't take anymore of it. Narcissa pulled us both from the Pensieve when I admitted as much. Without a word, I turned and bolted from the room, running as fast as I could until I was out in the Manor grounds, running towards the Quidditch pitch.
She wrote that down as well, then turned her attention to me. She let her eyes slowly travel up and down my body, clearly not paying attention to the fact that I was still holding Draco's hand. “And what can I get for you, handsome?" She asked. I caught the double meaning behind her words.
I kept my eyes closed, taking several deep breaths. I slowly opened my eyes, blinking as the green flames disappeared from the fireplace. I turned my head to look towards the bed. Draco was sitting there with trays of food sitting on the end of the bed.
The sound of chains dragging along stone reached our ears. The three of us turned towards the door as it was thrown open. Robards and Briggs came through the door, my father in chains between them. I could only stare at him; a lot had changed with him in the last two years since I had last seen him. His pale blonde hair hung halfway down his back; it was tied at the base of his neck with a small strip of black cloth. His clothes were now slightly baggy on his thin frame. His Azkaban prison tattoo that had been burned into his skin was visible just above the collar of his shirt.
It felt as though my heart ripped apart as I choked back a sob. I dropped to my knees, as the tears fell. I allowed myself to fall forward, my face burying into the carpeting. I sobbed, letting out my pain.
“But what about having an heir to continue the Malfoy family?" Harry asked, still following the Tahoe.
As he pulled the shirt over his head, I again noticed the hickeys that marked his skin. “I could heal those for you," I said, pointing to his neck.
“Actually, Harry, why don't you go ahead and take him home? He looks ready to fall asleep as it is," Peter said from behind me.
“Actually, to tell you the truth, I never knew he played guitar. He knew I played violin, but I didn't know that he played."
I watched them for a moment, before turning back to face the Pensieve. Draco's memory was swirling around the Pensieve. I took a deep breath and plunged my face into the surface of his memory. It felt as though the floor tilted beneath my feet and I was falling into the Pensieve.
“Lately when I come home, I'm exhausted. It's getting harder and harder to handle the older dragons," he said. He kept his back towards me. I noticed his hands were trembling.
“Exactly what it looks like; I pulled a few strings and I got you an interview with all of the top Healers at St. Mungo's. You're a great Healer, Draco. Now, you'll have a chance to prove it."
She shook her head and looked at me with her soft brown eyes. I sighed and motioned her to sit down in the chair next to my bed. Once she was seated in the chair, I climbed onto my bed and sat cross-legged on the covers. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly before speaking. I told her everything; mine and Blaise's conversation in the entryway, him kissing me, Ron finding us like that and telling Harry, Harry leaving, and my eventual cutting of my wrists.
“You seemed lost in thought when I came out of the bathroom. Something on your mind?" He asked, before taking a sip of his tea
“I have a job Harry. I can't be responsible for what goes on with the dragons. Sometimes it takes several handlers to control a single dragon. When I take a shower right away, it's usually because I smell like smoke from the dragons trying to barbecue me and my team. I would never hurt you like that!" He practically yelled. He shoved his chair back with enough force that it toppled over. He stormed out of the room.
“Yes," I said. I slipped my wand into my pocket and stepped over by him. “I've arranged it with Tom to use the Floo in his office."
He didn't answer, he just picked up his glass and took a drink. I took a drink from my own glass. We sat there in an uncomfortable silence for a few moments. Suddenly, he looked up at me. “Tell me what you want from me, Draco."
“Father used to drive when Voldemort first lost power, but after he returned, Father got rid of his car," he answered me. I pulled the Lamborghini to a stop and killed the engine.
When I had him up against my chest, I twisted on the spot and apparated us into his bedroom. I laid him down on his bed and gently removed his shoes. With a wave of my hand, I had stripped him down to his boxers. I lifted him up and waved my hand to pull the sheets and comforter down. I placed him back on the bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin. I leaned down and gently pressed a kiss to his forehead.
“Yeah, my ex-boyfriend Jonas liked it. He said Muggle alcohol was more potent than wizard alcohol. I never had the courage to try it." The light turned green and Harry drove on.
My birthday party was in full swing. I glanced around the foyer of the Manor, taking in the unbelievable sight before me; my friends and Harry's friends, once former enemies, actually getting along with each other. I saw Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan laughing with Theodore Nott and Gregory Goyle in one corner of the room. Blaise and Pansy were talking to Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom not to far away from her.
We stood there in silence for a moment. Suddenly, I heard the sound of running water coming from the bathroom. “Is someone here?" I asked.
I picked up both mugs and moved over to the table just as Charlie emerged from the bedroom. I glanced at him, taking in the faded blue jeans that hugged his muscular legs and the black t-shirt that was stretched across his chest. I also noticed the dragon hide boots on his feet. Without a word, he walked over to the table and took his mug before sitting down across the small table.
I tried to force myself to my feet, but I barely managed to get to my knees before I toppled over. My vision swam and everything started turning black. “Dempsey, Poppy," I said. The last thing I was aware of was the sound of two loud cracks, followed by a scream, before I lost consciousness.
I maneuvered my way through the crowd, looking for familiar faces that I could join. Though I saw several people I recognized, none of them had any room for me to sit down. The throbbing in my hip was getting stronger as I made my way towards the wall; which meant I was getting closer to whomever was hurt. I broke through the crowd, and found myself three feet from where Potter sat.
“Glad you found that amusing, Harry," she said. She turned and made her way over to her desk. It was then that I noticed the shallow basin covered with ancient runes sitting on top of the desk. Narcissa noticed the direction of my gaze. “Harry, do you know what that is?" She asked, indicating the basin with a wave of her hand.
I looked back up at him. His eyes were still closed and his head was still against the wall. “How do you feel Harry?" I asked. He opened his eyes and looked down at me. His green eyes had darkened, and his breath was coming in short pants. It was then that I noticed he was a half a foot taller than me.
He held up his hand to stop what I was going to say next. “Now it's my turn to be honest. I don't want to be your friend Draco; I want more. I want what we had before your birthday. It breaks my heart to hear that you went out with that guy twice and it hurts that you think I should be okay with it. I will never be okay knowing that you want to date other people while we're trying to fix things between us. I love you more than I've ever loved any of my ex's, and it scares me because that gives you the ultimate power to break my heart. I'm sorry, Draco, but I can't sit here with you anymore; it hurts too much."
He spun his head around, eyes wide. “Really? You'll go with me to Azkaban?" He asked. He sounded hopeful.
Once my shoes were on, I stood up and made my way over to the computer in between the lanes. I began to program our names into the system. When I was finished, I looked around at the others to find that everyone had their bowling shoes on. “Now, we need to find the correct bowling ball. Hermione and I will help you with that; you have to find a ball that's not too heavy to pick up and that the holes aren't too tight or too loose around your fingers," I said. The four purebloods looked at me like I had lost my mind. I chuckled. “Come on. What I just said will make sense in a few moments."
“Brown," Ron said. He sat down on the other side of Hermione's bed and she leaned against him. I smiled at the pair of them, then turned my attention back to the little girl in my arms. I raised my hand and gently touched her little cheek with my finger. The skin was so soft.
“Draco, you never should have asked me if I'd be okay with you being with someone else. But I never should have told you that it was alright either. You know how I feel about you."
“No, Charlie said there was still some things I need to sort through," I answered as I rose to my feet. I grabbed an empty box and stepped towards the bookcase.
Harry was standing on the corner of the street, leaning against a tree. I moved towards him. He straightened up at my approach. I walked right up to him, wrapped my arms around his neck, and pulled him down, locking our lips together.
“Well, get used to it. You are my boyfriend now. I mean, we've slept together, I've taken you on a date and plan to take you out more."
I reached out my hands and I caught the bottom of his shirt and tugged it upwards. He raised his arms and let me pull his shirt completely off. I dropped it carelessly behind me. Now we were both shirtless and he pulled me back to his lips. This kiss was hungry, his mouth moving urgently against mine. I parted my lips and he slid his tongue in. I trailed my hands over his skin, sliding them down his chest and up across his back. I broke the kiss again, and pushed him backwards on my bed.
“Enjoy your queso dip. I'll be back as soon as your food's ready," Kyle said. He collected our menus and turned away. He swayed his hips back and forth as he walked. Harry made a point to look at me, and not let his eyes travel to Kyle's backside.
“Why have you been hiding? You have never blocked me like this," she said, moving closer so she could sit on the bed.
“It just wasn't the right path for me. Well, Kingsley, I think that it's about time for Draco and I to get back to the Manor. Thank you for doing this today."
He nodded. I stood and went over to the foot of the bed. I heard the bed shift as Harry stood up. I glanced over my shoulder and watched him walk over to the bathroom. The door closed. I pulled out my wand and made a table appear in front of my sofa. I levitated the trays and moved them to the table. I sat down on the sofa.
“Alright, I tried to warn you that you didn't want to hear this...Charlie and I have been sleeping together for almost three months. Every time you two would have a fight, he would come to me."
I opened my eyes, looking at Harry's sleeping face on the pillow beside me. We laid on our sides facing each other. He looked so peaceful in his sleep, his dark lashes making little smudges against his cheeks. He had one arm around me and the other was tucked under my pillow. I gently removed myself from his embrace, slipping out of the bed without waking him.
I sighed heavily and ran my fingers through my hair. “I'm not sure how long I can just be his friend. I want more from him. You know I was crushing on him for years," I said, the smile fading from my lips.
“This bag has an undetectable extension charm on the inside. We're going to a Muggle amusement park and I don't want anyone to lose their wands or cellphones, so I'm bringing this bag to put all that stuff in when we go on the rides."
I strolled down the the hallway towards Harry's room. I pushed open the doors and paused. All I could do was stare. Harry was in the process of changing his clothes; I stared and licked my lips as he pulled a dark pair of jeans up his legs.
As I watched my wrist waiting for it to close like it had several times before, I felt like something was wrong. My vision was starting to swim and I was seeing blackness along the edge of my vision. I blinked trying to clear my head, before I noticed that my wrist wasn't healing. I glanced down at the other wrist and noticed it was still bleeding. In the back of my mind, I began to panic that my Healer's magic hadn't closed the wounds.
“Oh don't pretend you didn't notice. You were the one to push your hips against mine," he said with a smirk.
“I don't know, Draco. But I promise that I'm gonna help you get back with Harry," she said. She leaned across the seat and hugged me gently. I returned the hug, wondering what I was going to do now.
He slowly raised his head to look at me. “What happened to me? I should be covered in blood right now. I should have marks like yours," he said. He raised his hand and gently rubbed his chest.
As soon as Jolene and I had finished the last of the food on our plates, the two trays rose into the air and drifted towards the kitchen. A moment later, the Weasley family began to emerge from the kitchen. I stood up so Ron could take my place next to Hermione.
When I next opened my eyes, I discovered that Draco and I had rolled over so that I was spooning him. His back was pressed against my chest, his arse against my groin. My right arm was under the pillow beneath his head and my left was wrapped around his waist. My face was buried against his neck. I breathed in, enjoying his scent as it tickled my nose. He sort of smelled like a forest after a rainstorm. I pressed my left hand to his stomach. I gently began tracing one of the scars that I had caused with the Sectumsempra curse ten years ago.
“Sorry, Alan, but I won't order a dessert. If I don't leave now, I'm liable to do something I'll regret later," Harry said. He slipped his arm around my shoulders and led me out the door. My arm was still around his waist.
“Are you living here?" I asked, glancing past him at the room beyond. There was a jacket draped over the back of a chair next to a desk. I could see the corner of the bed and I could tell that the bed wasn't made; I could see the comforter hanging off the bed, almost touching the floor.
Mother served the tea, adding sugar to each mug, and passing them around. I added a splash of cream to Harry's mug before I passed it to him. He smiled at me, and we began to eat. After a few minutes, I noticed that Harry was just picking at his food. “Is everything alright Harry? You haven't eaten much," I said. I placed my hand over his. He glanced up at me, his green eyes holding a vacant look.
Ron turned left and walked over to where he had parked his car. The grey Chevy Impala glinted in the sunlight. I took Draco's hand and led him across the street to the lawyer's parking lot. I had parked near the back of the lot, parking in the shade of a tree. My black Lamborghini Gallardo still shined, even in the shade.
“Thank you Harry. It's been hard without Fred. Your gift is special, not just to me, but to Molly as well," he said. He hugged me for a moment longer than let me go.
Last night had been incredible. Harry had taken me to dinner and then to a Muggle movie theater. I didn't remember anything about the movie; we hadn't really been watching it anyway. Harry had spent most of that time kissing me like he was going to lose me at any moment. When we had gotten back to the Leaky Cauldron, I had walked him to his room like I had done every time. When we shared our usual kiss outside his door, he had pushed open the door and all but dragged me inside.
We climbed out of the car, and followed Ron into the house. As he pushed open the door into his kitchen, all three of us covered our ears as a loud cry reached us. We shoved into the kitchen and once we were inside, the cry didn't seem so loud. “'Mione?" Ron called out.
“Hey Peter, can I ask why your brother has been telling me that I wasn't needed as a bartender lately?"
“Don't you ever do that again!!" I yelled. I could already feel my lips swelling. I grabbed the stuff from the bed and made my way past Draco. I ran down the hall and dumped my things unceremoniously into an empty box. Draco grabbed the two boxes of books and stacked them into the fireplace. He quickly grabbed the box of stuff I had brought out of the bedroom.
After a couple moments, in which the only sounds were Hermione's crying and Rose drinking from her bottle, Hermione pulled herself together and finally took a good look at Draco, as if seeing him for the first time. He was still holding Rose in his arms. “Well, since your the only other person here, and since I was told I would be meeting Harry's boyfriend, I'm guessing that's you," she said to him.
Before I could answer, a loud, painful scream ripped through the air. My cigarette fell from my fingers at the sound. “HARRY!!!" Ron bellowed.
“Well, he wanted to work here, and when I offered him a job, he never showed up. Look, I'd like to help you guys out, but I've not seen Harry since last Tuesday," Seamus said. He leaned back in his chair and propped his feet on the desk in front of him.
“Hello Auror Sanders. Tell me, what's going on with the prisoners today," Kingsley said as he stepped up to the desk.
Ron grabbed Harry to get his attention again. Harry turned back to Ron and looked into his eyes. He stumbled backwards and looked towards me again. The pain on his face was like a knife to my heart. I took a step forward just as Blaise entered the room behind me. Harry's eyes flickered to Blaise, and the pain on his face became more pronounced. Harry shook Ron's hand off his arm and disapparated with a loud crack.
“I don't like surprises. You could have told me." Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Ron's face getting redder. The waitress just stood there, staring.
“As tempting as that sounds, I'm gonna have to say no. You are in a relationship with someone, and I'm not going to come between you," he said.
I felt as though someone was staring at me. I looked up and found myself staring into Charlie's blue eyes. I quickly looked away. “Well, I don't want to hog Rose all to myself. There are some other things I need to do, like looking for a new apartment." I handed Rose back to Hermione and stood up. I stepped around Charlie and made my way to the door.
I followed the pathway around the Manor like he said. “Why is there a garage underneath the Manor?" I asked, as I followed the path directly into the underground garage.
I slid into the booth on the opposite side of him. He turned his head and smiled slightly when he noticed me sitting. A strange little shiver slid down my spine at his smile. I shook my head, and noticed for the first time the rose colored liquid in the glass in front of him.
“Okay, I'll tell you. Back during the summer between second and third year, my Aunt Marge came over and stayed with us for a week. My uncle had told me that if her visit went well, and if she knew nothing about my ´abnormalities', as he called my magic, then he would sign my slip to visit Hogsmead. Things had been going well, and I only had one night left. On the last night of her visit, she began to insult me. I was fine with it, until she turned her insults to my parents. I got angry at her, things around the room started to rattle and the next thing I knew, I had blown her up like a balloon."
“You're right. From the moment I entered the tavern, I could tell that someone was in pain. I felt a throbbing ache around my hip. The closer I got to you, the stronger I felt the pain. But also, every time you shifted, a fresh wave of pain pulsed through my own hip."
“Harry, just because I'm tired when I get home, it doesn't mean I don't love you. And I've slept in the guest room because by the time I was getting home, you were already in bed and I didn't want to wake you up," he said.
tells me that he doesn't need me tonight and that he'll check the schedule, I'll find a different bar to work at."
I stood there, staring after him, my hands balled into fists at my sides, until Hermione shoved me from behind. I blinked, then realized it was my turn to bowl. Without a word, I stepped up to the lane and grabbed my bowling ball. I took a breath, trying to control my emotions, before I bowled. The ball rolled straight into the gutter. Growling in the back of my throat, I waited until the ball came back, then tried again. The ball rolled straight into the gutter again.
“It's more fun to keep you in the dark until the other person gets here. That way, Hermione and I don't have to repeat ourselves," Harry said with a grin.
I looked down at the little girl in my arms, enjoying the feeling of her tiny weight. Staring down at her, I almost forgot about the other people in the room. “She's very adorable. What color are her eyes?" I asked. I shifted her weight a little bit, getting a better grip on her. I looked up at the room around me.
“Look at it this way...You've been like a son to my parents ever since the first day they met you. Ron has always thought of you as another brother. And let's not forget the age difference between you and me."
When our feet touched the ground, Harry broke the kiss and we looked around. I had apparated us outside of Malfoy Manor, the iron gates right in front of us. I turned back to Harry and found him looking down at me. Our arms were still around each other.
Hermione's face flushed a bright red. She glanced down at her left hand for a moment, then looked up at Ron. “I didn't even notice that it wasn't on my hand. It must have fallen into her crib when I changed her diaper." She choked back a sob.
. I'm putting it that Harry wrote it and Draco hears him playing it, giving him a clue how Harry really feels about him.
“Good night, Harry. I love you," I whispered. I felt my heart swell with pride as I said the words. I snuggled against him and let my eyes close as I finally drifted off to sleep.
A tingle of arousal slid down my spine at the feeling of his lips against my bare skin. I fought back a little moan as he pressed kiss after kiss against the scar, before he began traveling his lips up my arm towards my Dark Mark. “Harry, stop. This isn't helping us to just be friends," I said. Harry raised his head, his cheeks flushing a bright red.
Ron and Hermione made there way down the stairs when I offered to let them join Mother and I for dinner. I crossed the hall into my room. I crossed over to my bureau and pulled a vial of Dreamless Sleep Potion off the top of it. I went back to Harry's room and found him drifting off to sleep. I gently shook his shoulder to gain his attention.
“I want to show you these memories so you can see that if anyone deserves to feel guilty, its Lucius. He caused Draco more pain than you ever could have. Yes, you caused Draco physical scars, but I know he still suffers from the emotional scars that Lucius left him with. You have no real reason to feel guilty anymore; the wounds on his chest were healed long ago, and you were not responsible for the damage to his wrists."
Mother clapped her hands, and the house elves began scurrying around, bringing out different trays full of food. There were eggs, toast, bacon, hash browns, and several other dishes as well. The house elves had outdone themselves with the meal, producing much more food than they did for just Mother and me. Once all the dishes of food and the tea set were placed on the table, the house elves bowed and made their way out of the room.
“Are you kidding me?! Peter, you can't expect me to run the bar and train Alexis at the same time by myself. Thursdays are our busiest days and I can't do this alone!" Krista practically yelled.
“I'll take some toast, yogurt and fruit. I'm not very hungry this morning," I said to him. He bowed to me, then disappeared from sight with a pop.
Hermione has given birth to her daughter. Harry goes to St. Mungo's to pay a visit, and runs into Draco, who is visiting his mother.
“Everyone step closer to my desk," Kingsley said. We stepped forward, forming a circle around Kingsley's desk, Harry to my left and one of the Aurors to my right. Kingsley pulled out his pocket watch and looked down at it. “Alright everyone. We all need to touch the portkey, it's almost time for it to activate," he said.
“Harry, whatever made you or Charlie believe that you couldn't come clean to me?" Ron asked, finally looking at me.
He sighed and placed his guitar on the grass beside him. “I've been working on it all day, trying to put exactly what I feel into words."
“So, how long have you been together?" Ron asked. He glanced down at his menu, then flipped it over to properly read it.
“Are you ready to order, dearies?" Asked a voice. All three of us glanced up at the waitress who stood behind the chair next to Ron, popping bubbles with the wad of gum she was chewing.
“I don't think he's used to this. I'll take him out to the car so he can lay down, and then I'll come back in to help you finish cleaning," I said, leaning my broom against the wall.
Without a word, we began to eat. As I was helping myself to some tea, Draco reached over and brushed my hair away from my face. I turned my head to look at him. He gave me a big grin, then he leaned forward and pressed his lips to mine. He pulled away and turned back to his breakfast. I chuckled and went back to pouring my tea.
We stood there for a moment. I tightened my grip on his hand. “Well, let's show him what he's missing," I said. I dragged him over to the doors and walked inside.
“I usually glamour them. I didn't today because I'm tired of hiding them," I said, still staring at my wrists.
I stepped forward and took my own helping of floo powder. I threw it down on the hearth and called out, “Ministry of Magic, Minister's office." I stepped into the flames and disappeared with a swirl of color.
“Alright everyone, let's eat," Mr. Weasley said. And with a flick of his wand, the food began to serve itself.
“Malfoy! What are you doing sitting with POTTER!!!" I glanced at the end of the table. My old friends, Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini stood at the end of the table, Blaise looked confused and Pansy looked ready to destroy the place. I glanced at Harry.
in my bed, his legs draped over the side, feet planted on the floor. I couldn't believe this was really happening; but I had fantasized about it back when we were in Hogwarts. Now my fantasies could come true. I began placing kisses up his thigh.
“Well, she went to visit Father in Azkaban. She's visited him before, but something about this visit is haunting her. I was worried about her, so I brought her here. She's doing better, but I still worry about her."
“You can't use magic for everything. It's about time you stopped following your father's view of the world and make your own path. Besides, I can communicate faster with my phone than with floo or an owl."
“So what if I did? Why do you care?" He replied. His voice was steady and the slurring was gone. He sat up straighter in his seat.
I unlocked the doors and we slid in. As I stuck the key in the ignition, Draco rubbed his hand over the red leather seat. The engine purred to life as soon as I turned the key. I pulled out of the parking lot and smoothly slid in behind Ron's car as he pulled up to a stop sign. He continued forward, and after a brief stop, I followed him. I knew I would have to follow him to his house; the only way I knew how to get to his house was by apperating.
“Well, I hope things work out for you. I know you've always wanted to join that team," I said sitting back in my chair. She smiled before turning back to her breakfast.
Without another word, Harry and Krista began to pour and mix drinks. The younger girl Alexis was passing the drinks around the bar and setting drinks on the end of the bar where the servers were picking them up. I watched in fascination as Harry worked. He looked at home behind the bar, mixing and pouring drinks with ease. He glanced at me from time to time, but he never let it distract him from what he was doing. I started to get hungry, and Harry ended up ordering me a burger and fries.
I looked directly into his green eyes, knowing that's how Legilimency worked; as a Legilimens, Harry needed to look directly into someone's eyes to gain access to their mind. I took a breath and concentrated on the shields that protected my mind. Slowly, I let them drop. Immediately, I felt Harry in my mind, running through the last few moments. As soon as he pulled away mentally, my shields snapped back into place.
“Just a slight concussion from where his head hit the wall. Patrick insists he's fine though," she said.
When he pulled away, all I could do was stare up at him. A lot of emotions were swimming in his eyes, love being among them. “I don't blame you Harry. If anything, I blame Snape. It was his own curse that he wrote down in his old potions book. You explained all that to me after the war ended. I know you; if you had known what that spell did, you never would have used it, not even on me."
“I wanted to, but I never could bring it up. There were so many opportunities, I just could never say it."
Kingsley glanced at the Aurors, then looked at me, then rose to his feet. With a wave of his hand, he motioned me to follow. I glanced at Harry for a moment before rising to my feet and following the other three out of the room. Kingsley turned right down a small hallway and ushered us through another door. We were now in the small room behind the two-way mirror, watching and listening to the conversation between Harry and Father.
“I think that sounds fair enough. We can build that friendship that we should have had since day one."
At the mention of his godfather, Harry turned his head away, but not before I noticed the tears in his eyes. I reached up and brushed away the tear that had slipped from his eye and down his cheek. “I'm sorry about what happened to him," I whispered.
I spun around to face Blaise when he placed his hand on my shoulder. “Get! Out!" I growled through my teeth.
Harry and Hermione have planned a day among Muggles; including an amusement park, an arcade, and a bowling alley- things that Ron, Draco, Pansy, and Theodore Nott have never done before. Draco also flirts with a stranger.
“Hey, Peter," she called out. I turned my head and watched a man step towards the end of the bar where she was setting drinks for the servers to grab.
“Carlos Madole? Yeah, he's here. Do you want me to get him out here?" Steve asked. He glanced down at my wrists then looked back up at me. I shoved my hands into my pockets, hiding the scabs that were half healed on my wrists. “Draco, what happened?" He asked.
He looked at me for a moment, then gently pulled his arm away from me. He turned and made his way towards a small desk, the heals of his shoes clicking softly against the floor. I followed him. The young medi-wizard behind the desk looked up at us as we approached. “Ah, Mr. Malfoy. Been wondering if you would arrive today."
“So, have you been looking for a new apartment?" I asked. I reached for a chip and dipped it into the queso, right in the center of the chili. I brought it to my lips and bit into it. “Wow, that's good."
I was unaware of how long I sat there picking at my breakfast, when suddenly, a small silvery rabbit hopped through my door. It hopped towards me, barely skimming the floor. Narcissa's voice floated out of it when it paused in front of me. “Harry, I'd like to talk to you. After you have finished your breakfast, will you please join me in my study in the east wing?" The rabbit faded away.
“Look Hermione, I know you think I probably shouldn't have said that to him, but I didn't want to hurt him. After all, I honestly can't stop him if he wants to be with someone else. It just means he'll be happy while I'm miserable," I said, turning back to face Draco's and Pansy's still going on dance off. It looked like Draco was winning, but I was too far away to see the actual score.
“Surprisingly, I understand Harry. This is my fault and I know that. I never should have let it get this far. I'm so sorry that I've hurt you."
Draco suddenly chuckled and stood from his chair. He crossed over to me and sat down on the edge of the bed next to his mother. He looked right into my eyes.
“You can blame me for that. I was the one who started the kiss," Draco said. He followed Hermione into the kitchen. After grumbling for a moment, Ron disappeared into the kitchen behind them.
“Yeah, I haven't been in this area in a while," Harry replied. It was then that I noticed that one of the other girls was staring at me. She let her eyes slowly travel down my body and then slowly brought them back to my face. Harry caught the look. “Sorry, Pamela. He's mine," Harry said, grabbing my hand again.
He turned his head and glanced at where his suitcases and his trunk were stacked against the wall. He looked at me. “I see you already packed my stuff for me. I guess the only thing left for me to do, is to pay Tom," he said. He picked up his wand from the desk, and pointed it at his luggage. It all shrank down and then flew into his hand. He tucked his stuff into his pocket and grabbed his jacket.
A small smile appeared on his face. “That's nice of you to say, Harry. But they don't fully trust me here. No one can trust a former Death Eater."
He blushed, but didn't look away. “What's the big deal about it? Harry and I talked about this and he told me he was okay with it if I wanted to date someone else while we build our friendship."
I turned my head to look at her. She was smiling. “I guess I have you to thank for that Mother. I don't really think Harry and I would be together if it wasn't for you telling him about how I used to fancy him."
“Oh, please. Draco and I even smoke. We started that habit when Voldemort took over the Manor. That's actually why Lucius had this room built. He used to smoke when Draco was little," Mother said.
Hermione was still laying on the couch, just watching the flames dance in the fireplace. She turned her head at my approach.
“Thank you, sir. I know that this is putting you in a difficult position, but I also know that Draco will appreciate it," I said. Kingsley nodded his head before turning back to his paperwork. I closed my eyes and pulled my head from the fireplace.
Harry put his hands on the lions and pushed the doors open. His eyes widened at the sight before us. His room was set up like mine, but with subtle differences. The king-sized bed was surrounded with scarlet curtains, topped with a crimson canopy. The comforter was a rich gold color and the pillows were a nice shade of ruby red. There was a mahogany desk on one side with a floor to ceiling bookcase beside it. The view from his windows looked out over the large garden. Harry turned his attention to the fireplace and the black leather sofa that sat in front of it.
“Well, your mother told me about it when I stopped by the Manor on Sunday. I wanted to talk to you, but you were out. So, want to add anything? I mean if you want honesty from me, then I suggest you start being honest with me."
“Yeah it was in the Prophet. What would give them the idea to set you up with Harry?" Hermione asked.
With a little difficulty, I made my way to the bar. Marko Hannigan, the tavern owner, spotted me and waved me towards the end of the bar. As I made my way down to him, I felt a dull throbbing around my right hip. I knew I wasn't hurt, which ment that someone else in the tavern was hurt. That was the only thing I didn't like about my abilities; when someone was hurt, I could feel their pain. And it wouldn't go away until I helped them out.
Several cheers and whistles suddenly erupted around us. Harry broke the kiss. I blinked several times and looked around. Nearly everyone in the place was watching us. They were clapping. A blush spread across my cheeks.
“Charlie burned that bridge when he cheated on me with Flint. Sure I cheated, with Draco, but it was a one night stand and not a three month affair. I would rather go up against an angry hippogriff than date him again," Harry said vehemently.
“Do you think it will be hard for me to really learn?" He asked, timidly. I reached out and placed my hand on top of his, offering him a little comfort.
In answer, I thrust my hips forward, rubbing my hardening erection against his stomach. Harry swore colorfully and with a whispered spell, he banished our clothes, leaving us both completely naked where he had me pinned against the wall. His hands moved from my arse to my hips instead. I thrust forward again, eliciting a moan from Harry's throat.
“I've been an arse about this whole situation. Can we talk?" He asked, looking at me as though waiting for me to close the door in his face. I turned and walked back to the bed. He followed me. He sat down next to me on the bed, but he wouldn't meet my gaze.
With that, he finished his drink and slid out of the booth. He grabbed his jacket from the hook on the wall behind him. He pulled the jacket over his shoulders and headed for the door. He called out a goodbye to Marko and walked out the door.
“What's so funny?" I asked. I brought my cigarette to my lips and pulled out my lighter. I lit the cigarette and took a drag from it. I blew out smoke as I waited for his response.
Hermione smiled and turned to Pansy. “Sure Pansy. Harry and I came up with this idea to spend the day like Muggles," she began, but Pansy cut her off.
I felt my cheeks heat as a blush began to spread. As I continued to eat, I did my best not to think about the kiss that Charlie and I had shared this morning.
Silence fell around us as Charlie began to eat. I lost my appetite as the thought of him cheating bounced around in my head. I pushed the food around on my plate, trying hard not to say it...but out it came.
“That's okay Harry. I wasn't looking where I was going either," Draco said. He dropped his hand away from my arm and took a step back. He bent down and picked up the bouquet of flowers he had dropped.
Harry emerged from my bathroom, his face freshly washed. My robe hung on him loosely. He crossed over to me. As he approached me, I noticed all the hickeys that I had left on his skin, four of them forming a “D" on his collarbone.
“Just incompetent people that don't know how to do their jobs," she answered, raising her arms to embrace him in a hug. I hung back as he stepped up to the side of the bed, placed the flowers in a vase on the bedside table, and then bent down to give her the hug she wanted.
“You got a problem with that? I think you would be grateful to have the extra help, especially on a busy Thursday night."
Ron headed into the living room. Draco and I followed him. We entered the room and I paused in the doorway. Hermione was sitting on the couch, holding a crying baby in her arms. Ron knelt on the floor next to Hermione, his face full of worry.
“Sure. If I can get along with Weasel... I mean Ron and Hermione, then I can get along with the rest of them. Even if you want to invite the rest of Weasel's...Ron's family, I'll be okay with it," I said.
“Thanks Marko. Now I'm gonna go see if I can find a seat somewhere," I said, picking up the glass. I cast a No Spilling Spell over the glass, so I could weave my way through the crowd, and not spill my drink.
Harry walked into my room, his eyes wide. I stepped in behind him and pushed the doors shut. For good measure, I locked them. I turned around to watch Harry explore my bedroom. I watched him walk over to the black leather sofa that sat in front of the large fireplace that dominated the right side of my room. He ran his hand over it, glancing at the fireplace.
“Please Harry. Give me a chance to explain. I didn't kiss him. He kissed me. I actually tried to get away from him, but he used his body to pin me against the wall. I never wanted to hurt you," he whispered. Tears began sliding down his cheeks and he lowered his gaze towards the floor once again.
Ron laughed and pulled me into a hug. “You can't get rid of me that easily. You're family no matter what."
“I guess Harry and I should get going. You need to get some rest," Draco said. He stood up from the side of the bed and leaned over to give her a hug. Narcissa looked at me for a moment, then gestured me forward. I moved closer and bent down as her arms wrapped around me a little awkwardly. The hug was brief, but I appreciated it.
Relief flooded his face, then he leaned down and kissed me again. Harry pulled away from my lips and began kissing his way down my chest, dragging his tongue against each of the four scars before moving lower. His lips brushed along my erection and I jumped slightly. He chuckled softly before moving even lower, until his lips and tongue brushed my sack; I gasped.
“Someone has a dorky looking smile on his face," Hermione said, sitting down next to me. I glanced at her from the corner of my eye before turning my attention back to the scene in front of me, where two former Slytherins were still playing
Harry didn't release me until we stepped up next to his Lamborghini. He opened the door for me and I slid into the car. He closed the door and I watched him as he rounded the hood. He opened the door and slid behind the wheel. The engine purred to life as he turned the key. Harry pulled the car out from the underground garage and we drove along the pathway towards the gates.
I took a deep breath and slowly let it out. “Alright Narcissa, I would like to see your memories," I said.
Harry recoiled away from me as if I had slapped him. It took me a moment to realize what I had said and regret washed through me. “Harry, I didn't..."
Ron pulled out the chair across the table from me and sat down. He looked between me and Draco and back again. “Really, Harry? There wasn't any other guy that you wanted to be with? You had to pick
He came around the corner and froze, looking at the romantic setting of the room. “Oh, honey, I'm so sorry I'm late. There was a dragon hatching today. Seven eggs hatched and three of them were Hungarian Horntails. I'm sure you remember how dangerous the Horntails can be."
“You have a Lambo?" She asked turning to face him. He simply nodded. She turned back to me. “I want to ride with Harry. You know how I like Lambos and you've already ridden in it."
“Why are you acting like this? What is going on in your head? It's like your jealous of me right now," I said. His cheeks darkened as he blushed, and he quickly turned his back on me.
“Hey, give that back Draco," he cried, reaching for the glass. Unfortunately, his hand missed and the full glass of Firewhisky spilled all over Harry's shirt. “Oooops, sharry, Harry," The words were slurred coming from Blaise's mouth. He couldn't stop giggling like a little girl.
I turned my attention back to my book for a moment, then turned back to Harry. He was looking out the window, smiling as he enjoyed his cigarette. He flicked his ashes into a small, black ashtray that had appeared on the stand next to his chair.
I turned my attention to the two people still standing in the room. Hermione looked like she was ready to explode and knowing her temper, she probably was. “So, you found me," I said, settling back against my pillows.
“Yes I did. Considering that my car isn't big enough, there will be a vehicle for me to drive waiting next to your car."
“I don't mind, Harry. I've seen him once since he got locked up and I have no intention of repeating the experience."
“Yes he is," she said. She folded her arms across her chest and leaned against the brick wall. She let her eyes close and took a deep breath.
I apparated straight inside my kitchen. The room was the same as it had gotten left last night. The partly eaten meals on the table, Charlie's chair was still tipped over, the candles were nothing but dried wax on the table and the candlesticks.
“I can't really pinpoint an exact reason why I ever started sleeping with Marcus. But if you can forgive me, I will never do it again. Harry, please tell me if you can forgive me."
Draco smiled. Then he held Rose out to me. I took my goddaughter into my arms. I sat down in the recliner holding Rose gently. I rocked her in my arms as her eyes drifted closed. Draco perched on the arm of the chair and draped his right arm across my shoulders. We sat there and looked down at Rose sleeping in my arms. Ron had disappeared into the kitchen. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Hermione watching us. I leaned into Draco's embrace as Ron emerged from the kitchen, carrying a tray with mugs of tea. Draco gently took Rose from my arms, and laid her down in the playpen in the corner. He sat back down on the arm of the chair as Ron passed out the tea.
I suddenly thought to myself. I shook my head and brought my mind back to the conversation around the table.
“That's two questions, but I'll answer them. First, the stuff was rattling because of my temper. For some reason, my magic has always been hardwired to my emotions. The angrier I get, the more I lose control of my magic. As for the other question, when you put your arm around me, your touch actually began to calm me down."
I swore harshly under my breath and made my way back up to the table, ignoring the stares I was receiving. I threw myself down in my chair and raised my drink to my lips and took a small swallow. The alcohol burned down my throat.
