“And who’s this?” Harry asked. Draco glanced at his son before looking back at the dark-haired man.
“It’s Ron’s spell; actually, Neville,” Hermione explained. Neville beamed at him with his crooked smile and nodded his approval.
”Yeah, mate. Do you really think I’d be brave enough to risk Hermione’s wrath by cheating?” Weasley chuckled again before he spoke, “I think I’d be safer trying to perform a D’Orazio Dive than flirting with you anyway, Auror Zabini,”
“Why are you here?” Draco managed to croak out as he attempted to sit up.
He felt that uncomfortable stirring in his gut again. He knew that neither Malfoy nor Zabini was the children he’d been rivals with at school any more, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away. Memories of their sixth year came rushing back, and he felt he had to know how the blond had been spending the last fifteen years.
The birds chirped away high in the pine trees as Draco started his ascent to the main house. Maybe Harry was there eating breakfast.
Ron nodded. “Seemed to confund him pretty good, though. It was bizarre,”
“Thank you,” Blaise muttered, giving the mediwizard an appraising look before pulling Draco away from the desk.
“Mr Malfoy was my father,” Draco muttered. “I think I would prefer just Malfoy.”
Silence fell again before another voice filled the void.
“Attacked?” Hermione gasped as Harry’s stomach clenched in dread.
“You’re welcome, Malfoy, although I never expected your gratitude,” He replied finally, “I’m glad that you’ve been able to use the freedom. It looks like you’ve used it well.” Harry felt like the words were clumsy, but Malfoy smiled anyway.
“Bet the children and ridiculously clever,” Malfoy said. His brows furrowed. The Slytherin seemed to be giving out compliments freely. “Although, they’re probably still ginger.” Harry looked at the blond as he smirked. He tried to be offended on Ron’s behalf but found himself laughing too.
His right arm was suddenly yanked from under him, making him hit the floor once more, wrenching it at an agonising angle as the chains pinched onto his skin. It’s cold metal, leeching the dwindling heat from his already frozen hand. The other arm shot off in the opposite direction, dragging him to his knees. He kneeled, his jeans drawing the icy water up higher and higher as his shoulders screamed.
He slowly pulled on his clothes, settling for something a bit more muggle. He pulled his black jeans on and then reached for the top he’d packed. He’d complained to Harry when He’d purchased it, saying that no one wanted to walk around like a billboard for a band no one knew but secretly, it was his favourite shirt. It was a grey, mottled cotton t-shirt with ‘the cure” written in scratchy writing and the lead singer's silhouette and guitar. Draco had secretly fallen in love with the muggle band, something which Harry had found very endearing. Harry had even gone as far as buying himself a ‘Poison’ t-shirt that he only wore when they went out together. Harry found it hilarious when his t-shirt read ‘Poison’ and Draco’s read, ‘the Cure.’
“Thank you,” Draco offered weakly. He closed his eyes as he rubbed his face with his hands. Relief from the ever-present worry and panic would be heavenly. However, he knew that his conscience wouldn’t let him collect that treatment. He felt it was part of his penitence to suffer for what he had done.
“Isn’t Zabini going to notice you’ve been gone a while?” Harry asked, his curiosity piqued.
His heart hung heavy at the prospect of having to go through over a decade of accumulated and shared belongings. He knew that Ginny would currently be in the arms of her journalist lover. Orion Cooper, one of Seeker Weekly’s star columnists, had been the man who had filled the void Harry had left behind.
“Hello, We’re here to collect the prescription for Draco Malfoy, please,” Blaise announced confidently with a smile. The wizards stern look seemed to turn into a glare as he looked at his paperwork briskly.
“No, Ron, It’s green. Harry is wearing black,” Hermione explained. Three sets of eyes looked at him, waiting for an answer. He shrugged out of it reluctantly as he felt the warmth leave with it.
He had managed to arrange a couple of flat viewings for Monday evening but thought it best to view as many as possible. He was slightly disappointed that there wasn’t more available in the budget he had set himself; however, it was central London, so beggars couldn’t be choosers. The sooner he could get out of the Manor, the better. His back was starting to complain about the discomfort of the makeshift bed.
Once his bed was in place, he removed and folded his clothes and donned his freshly ironed pyjama shorts before sliding between the sheets. He touched the notepad, thinking of Harry before he closed his eyes and all the candles snuffed out.
Draco lifted the lid and found a small pile of presents inside, he tipped the box over and gently poured out the contents. After digging through, he found one that wasn’t much bigger than the original box had been. He looked at Harry, who nodded.
“I also brought something for us to drink” Harry grinned as he produced a bottle from behind his back. Draco recognised it instantly.
His racing heart pounded frantically in his chest as he tried to breath properly. Worryingly, the haze around his vision was becoming more solid. He knew he needed to breathe, but it’s like his lungs were frozen together, unable to expand. He gasped as he slid off the chair, hugging the seat cushion as he pressed his head into the warm material. He sobbed again and bit his fist, trying to quieten the ridiculous little hiccups that wracked his body. He sucked in the air hungrily as he pinched his eyes together to hold his mind together. Unsuccessfully. He didn’t usually cry anymore. Whether he was all cried out or whether he’d broken that part of himself too, he wasn’t sure.
“How come you never told me?”
“Shacklebolt?” Draco repeated. “Kingsley Shaklebolt?” Draco shook his head. “Minister for Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt?” Draco seemed unable to close his mouth. When Harry said that he’d pulled rank, he meant it. He had gone all the way to the top.
“Silly boy!” The voice uttered again before a slap rocked his head back. The sound of it reverberated around the walls. “You are here because we want you here,” Harry could taste blood as his dry tongue probed the new wounds at his lip.
He watched fitfully as the clock ticked by, each second passing torturously slowly. He tried to put the thoughts out of his head as he checked and rechecked his clothes before eventually collapsing into the armchair, reading through some of his case notes whilst idly doodling in his sketchbook.
“I wished you weren’t here so that I didn’t have to see you and your dumb hair. I mean, seriously, Potter? What were you thinking?” Malfoy smirked, but there was no venom in it. He sighed again before looking down at his feet, his hands now buried back in his pockets. “In all seriousness, though, Potter. You were the first person to do something nice for me without ever wanting anything in return. After the trials, I waited for the other shoe to drop. I was certain that you would write to me asking for something, whether it be compensation or blackmail, but nothing came. I saw the newspapers and saw all the great work you were doing, and I realised that you’d long forgotten all about me.” There was a long silence between them as a knot of guilt formed in his gut. It was true after he had given his testimonies, he had immersed himself in getting on with life and helping the orphans of the war. He hadn’t spared a thought for Malfoy until tonight. The Slytherin looked almost sad at the prospect of being forgotten. Harry felt confused.
Noomi and Patrik laughed before a comfortable silence descended around the table, each enjoying the feast presented.
“Come on, Draco, let’s go.” Draco nodded, opening his eyes in time to see Blaise throwing a few Galleons on the table. He wanted to argue, but the fight had left him. As he stood, he felt his legs turn to jelly. Blaise offered his arm as if knowing that walking was difficult. Draco took it as Blaise led him towards the door.
“I’m fine, thank you, Weasley.” He replied curtly as he pushed himself further into the corner.
“Fourth floor, However, if anyone tries to send you to the Centaur office, ignore them. It’s a trick.” Ron laughed. “No one ever uses it, so sometimes we tell newbies to go and ask for a long wait”, He snorted as though it was the funniest joke he’d heard. He slapped the table, laughing.
“But you’ll still be at Hogwarts.”
“I just told the truth about your actions, and it was so long ago,” Harry felt sick with nerves as Malfoy laughed and pinched the bridge of his nose. He shivered at the sound.
“I know who he is. I am also painfully aware of what he has or has not done. I believe that you both need to educate yourselves better and stop reading the Daily Prophet for your information.”
Draco’s eyes flew open as he sat upright, breathing hard. His heart thundered in his chest like a booming drum. He clutched at his skin as if trying to comfort it as he closed his eyes, willing the images away. It had been eighteen months since his encounter with the hybrid wyrm, yet he still woke up sweating and panting, fearing that he was still on fire. Usually, only Harry’s calming voice could coax him to bed every night, even knowing that the night terrors would return. He took a deep, shuddering breath as he pushed his hair away from his face. He sat still for a moment, waiting for his body to comply. It was then, and only then, he realised that he was alone in the cabin. His eyes darted around, looking for signs that Harry had been there, and it hadn’t just been a dream.
“Oh? And what were you expecting?” He asked, smiling despite himself.
“Can’t see.” He muttered as he rubbed at his eyes.
Harry’s brain whirred sluggishly as he tried to understand what was happening. Malfoy was shouting gratitude at him. He felt as though the world had turned upside down. He watched as he gradually gathered himself back together, collecting his composure as he ran his long, slender hands over his face, arms bulging against the material. Harry suddenly felt very hot despite the frigid air.
The wall of sound hit him as soon as the door opened, and it was clear that the band was back in full swing. He found Ron had long returned with the drinks, but Hermione was absent. Ron smiled kindly at him as he sat down.
Between grading, classes, exams and sleep, there seemed to be very little time for anything else. So in return for covering for Harry, Neville got the week off, and Harry was on hallway duty. He did have one advantage, though, and that was the Marauders map. So he could stay within his office and glance at the map between grading his papers, something which was very fortunate indeed.
“I’ll administer the counter curse, now if you’ll allow me?” Draco tried to follow, but the white pinpricks in his mind diverted his attention as they throbbed and pulsed. He felt the cool jet of magic like a jet of cool air which ruffled his hair. He waited, holding his breath as the pain in his temples slowly receded. He paused for a second before letting his muscles relax fraction by fraction. Finally, when he could breathe fully again, he attempted to open his eyes. He blinked at the dull room, trying to make sense of the world. Two figures crouched over him, their faces staring down intensely. He jumped and tried to crawl away. He didn’t want to be crucio’d again.
“Forgive my curiosity.” Patrik smiled awkwardly. “You are just not as I expected,”
“No, do you feel like you are going to throw up?” The mediwitch asked, concern creeping into the business-like tone in her voice.
Draco could only stare at the empty doorway as he waited for everything to make sense. Weasley knew about the jacket and seemed to know about his connection to Charlie and possibly more. He felt his heartbeat speed up before a hand landed on his knee, startling him out of his panic.
“I just think it’s worth considering, that’s all.”
“I was going to try somewhere muggle, but no one in the wizarding world would think that Draco Malfoy would wear muggle clothes, so I think we can get away with trying out ‘Tre e Viverna’”
The silence between them remained for a little while longer, but it was more companionable now.
Something about the way he said it made desire curl within Draco as he pulled the shorter man in for a kiss. Feeling his lips against his own was heavenly as his adrenaline spiked.
“You make it sound so trivial.” Draco looked almost forlorn now as he looked down at his hands. He was speechless for a moment as he processed it. Was he really thanking him? After all this time? It seemed preposterous. A Malfoy didn’t apologise or show gratitude for things. Not to Harry, and yet in this single conversation, he had done both.
They checked the map again before pushing out into the darkened hallway. As they reached the main stairs, Harry bid them goodnight as he rushed the other way.
We (Teddy Lupin & I) invited you to a small gathering we’re holding for New Year’s eve. Please let me know whether you can attend.
“I can stay and watch you open all of them, but open the smallest, I want to see your face.” Harry smiled.
“Did you like it?” Harry asked, and Draco nodded.
“Why? Does Mrs Weasley not like men who love men?” Luna asked sweetly.
He pressed his head and hands against the black doors as he took a deep breath, steeling himself against the ghosts within. He straightened his back and squared his shoulders, feeling a snap and crack as his spine protested. He took another jagged breath before releasing it as he pushed the door open.
“I know, I know!” He muttered awkwardly.
He frowned at the moving photo of the family looking back at him. The children were playfully poking and pushing each other as the witch, and her spouse smiled tiredly behind them. Draco tried to read into the body language but could see nothing to suggest an unhappy home. He sighed and frowned harder before pushing the file to one side. He scribbled a few more notes down before tapping the feather against his lip.
“Is this a complication?” Weasley asked from the door, a quick-notes quill floating in the air behind him. His face showed no sign of mockery or humour, which Draco was more than thankful for.
The years had been good to the Gryffindor, and Draco wondered whether he could say the same about himself. He pulled his stomach in and set his shoulders straighter as he stood back, letting the shorter man work. His salt and pepper hair had been cut short, making it look impeccable compared to the birdnest it had been during their school days. The neat beard at harry’s jaw did cruel things to him as he watched the shorter man move, his shirt and vest pulling against his slender frame. It was good to know that age hadn’t changed him.
“I’m talking about my freedom, Potter. Keep up.” Draco snorted before he carried on. “The reason I have the freedom to do anything I want is because of you,” He said as he rubbed the faded dark mark; The action catching his eye. “You stood up and testified for mother and me at the trials. Do you not recall?” Draco looked at him. His eyes darted over his face looking for deception or any hint of trickery. He sighed when whatever he saw confirmed that Harry didn’t remember. “Without your testimony, the Wizengamot would have sentenced us for sure. A life sentence in Azkaban.”
“Father? Are you alright?” Scorpius asked, his voice hushed.
“I was just going to ask whether you had a good evening last night at the reunion?”
“Stop laughing at me, Blaise. This situation is anything but amusing.”
Draco laughed as he ran his hands over his hair to play with his ponytail. “Are there any Ministers We’ve not spoken to yet?”
“Yes, you did, right before you ran off to find Potter.” Blaise grinned before he arched his eyebrow knowingly, plucking one of the bright green apples from the bowl.
“I am an Auror, Harry!” Ron scoffed again, “We tend to keep tabs on ex-death eaters and other Voldemort cronies.”
“Lavender and Michael Corner are snogging over by the punch bowl, and Peeves has just spotted them,”
Harry waved his own, summoning two cups from the cupboard. He watched as the spell filled the cups with coffee from the freshly heated kettle before floating them down onto the table between them. He still got a thrill being able to use magic. The novelty of it hadn’t worn off.
As you know I am rewriting this fic. Some parts and chapters may seem familiar, some will be completely different. Hopefully, you'll enjoy it as we go :)
“Yeah, I hate History!” complained Louis
Harry stared down at the blank piece of paper, his foot tapping against his chair as he racked his brains for inspiration. He glanced at the fire and rolled his eyes at the several screwed up piece of parchment sitting ready to burn. Why was this so difficult? He shook his head in despair. He knew the exact reason why. It was because he actually cared about what the blond git would think. He would notice if the punctuation were incorrect or mock the scruffy handwriting. Draco Malfoy would notice nothing, however, if he couldn’t get past writing his bloody name. Just ‘Malfoy’ alone sounded rude and blunt, whereas ‘Mr Malfoy’ sounded too formal and just wrong. And there was no way that he could start the letter ‘Draco’ as it was far too personal and intimate for this stage in their current tentative friendship.
Draco opened his mouth, desperate to know more. How could Weasley possibly understand what he’d been through and how hard he’d worked in the last decade. How much he had tried to change and improve. He let the sentence stop there, afraid of what he wanted to add. ’To be worthy of Him.’
Harry sat on the edge of his desk and smiled as he looked around the class.  These were like the old days of Dumbledore’s Army. Watching the children reminded him why he’d thought about becoming a teacher. The first years were split into pairs around the room, practising their knockback charms — pillows scattered around the room to prevent injury. Harry rubbed his chest in memory; it was an unpleasant feeling to be pushed away by magic, like a punch in the chest.
“You think they dated?” Asked Harry, his adrenaline had spiked at the thought. He tried to keep his face as passive as possible. If he showed too much interest, they would know too much.
“Head the investigation?” Draco shook his head as he felt the panic rise higher with each passing second. “But Sir. I have never been with a task force such as this. So to head it… I-I’m not sure that I am the best candidate for the job.”
Standing in the doorway of his room, he stared slack-jawed and overwhelmed. When Kreacher had disappeared, he hadn’t dreamed that the little fiend could be upstairs vandalising his bedroom with the tawdry decorations. It looked like a tinsel monster had decided to turn his bedroom into a nest. Blue and red rows of thick bushy tinsel dangled from his four-poster bed, while green and purple hung from the picture frames.
“So, what are you guys doing here?”
“That was atrocious!” Draco said finally, as he rose and sat in front of the fire. Harry grinned, and Draco warmed a bit more, he loved that smile. It was a cute mix of self-deprecation and charm. It made his heart beat a tiny bit faster, knowing it was all for at him.
As his heartbeat slowed and the images faded from behind his eyes lids, he rubbed his face and pushed back his hair, wondering why he was putting himself through the trauma. Why had he accepted the role knowing he would have to return to England? Had he been out of his wits? He should have stayed in Romania at the dragon sanctuary, even if it meant having to work side by side with Charlie each day.
“Indeed, it is,” Draco said smugly.
“Night mate,” Ron called as he turned to explain to Neville.
“My dad used to say that all the good people in the world wouldn’t be able to fill every cell in Azkaban.” Said Luna looking at Hermione. Hermione sighed heavily and nodded. “And Draco isn’t a bad person; he’s a sweetheart.”
“Don’t hurt your pretty little head about it,” Malfoy replied with a smile. “The Weasley-Grangers would never forgive me for breaking your brain.” He stood gracefully and dusted himself off. “Now, I shall take my leave before I could do anything else that they could blame me for.”
“How did he take it?” Blaise seemed to ask eagerly.
“Call him Ferret, and you may get some answers.” Blaise chuckled. Ron smirked at that and turned back to him.
He struggled to feel sorry for the absence, considering where it was. He sighed as he looked back at the open Daily Prophet sitting on the kitchen table where several columns had the distinctive tick mark, indicating that further attention was required.
“Sounds great,” Draco smiled, pleasantly surprised that it came easily. Blaise smiled back brightly as they both stepped towards the floo. Within a couple of flashes of green fire, they were off to lunch.
He handed Blaise a business card which he took in one of his now-empty hands.
Their panting breaths were the only thing that they could hear in the growing darkness. Draco felt boneless and sated as he ran his fingers leisurely through Harry’s hair. Harry groaned again before pushing himself up by his arms. He looked down at Draco, his eyes glinting in the darkness.
“Didn’t want to leave your drinks unattended, especially after that incident in Slughorn’s office. Romilda’s probably here somewhere.” Harry shuddered at the name. He didn’t think he and Romilda had shared a sentence, let alone the lust fuelled evening she boasted about in the prophet. However, she was still obsessed and as eager as ever. So much so that she claimed that he had fathered her child. The rumours of missed child support payments plaguing him despite having proven he was not the father.
“Oh?” Draco felt his eyebrows rise in surprise. Noomi nodded and smiled as she picked up her wand. Then, with a swish, another bowl of porridge floated to Draco before landing gently.
Harry gently bit at the bend in his neck and growled again.
“He’ll be Draco’s boss. They’ll be working on the same project at the Ministry.”
“When Draco awakes, I will send him to you,” She winked as they left, “You will probably need his help when the two of you are done messing!” She called as they left the kitchen. They both chuckled as they left the house.
The mediwizard muttered something under his breath as they moved away, and Draco felt Blaise freeze under his hand. He went to turn around, and Draco saw the murderous look in his eyes.
“What?” Asked Ron and Harry together.
“He said he did nothing.” Ron shrugged.
He had never quite perfected the art of travel by portkey. He would never be as graceful as Cedric. He shook his head quickly, forgetting the Hufflepuff they had lost so long ago. He sat up from the floor where he had landed, rubbing his elbow with a grimace. He found that he was right outside Hagrid’s old hut. It had been years now since he’d lived there. He’d moved to France with Olympe Maxime and was now a magical creatures professor at the Beauxbaton academy. He and Olympe had gotten married and were now the proud parents of two children. Harry was looking forward to seeing them all at the wedding; It had been far too long since he’s seen the man.
(See the end of the chapter for
Rolf had been very secretive in his letters when he had written and offered Draco the job. He’d never met Luna’s husband; however, he knew enough about him through Luna’s whimsical letters to see that he was a good and fair man. All Draco knew was an exciting opportunity that required keen observational skills, and precise record-keeping was now his. Rolf said that ‘with his meticulous record-keeping, logical mind and accurate sketches’, he’d be a shoo-in for the role. An owl visit later, before Draco had the opportunity to agree to the role, Luna had messaged him, wishing him congratulations for successfully obtaining the position.
“Mione! It’s not as if there any other Malfoys left!” Scoffed Ron
“Indeed, yes.” He nodded enthusiastically. Draco smiled as he reached for his bag and pulled out his sketchbook. Flicking through a few pages, he finally found the one he needed. He folded the pages back before handing the book to Rolf, who took it excitedly. His wide eyes flittered all over the picture, bringing the notepad closer to examine some of the mark-making. “This is…” He breathed before he paused. “And you said in your letter that no magic was used to create these images?”
The cold rush up his spine, and the shiver within his soul told him he hadn’t finished. He stayed at the sink and waited for his body to be done with him. He wanted to rest, to float away on sleep and perhaps never return. Another wave forced thoughts from his mind as the fire whiskey followed. He thought about finally walking the stairs to bed, but he couldn’t. The kitchen was the only space in the whole manor that he had never seen the other death eaters or the dark lord. A house-elf’s domain was below notice. Draco liked it down here.
“Deatheater scum.” One of the ladies hissed.
“Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, of course,” Ron and Hermione said in unison.
The knot inside his gut had started to ease, fraction by fraction as the day wore on. His co-workers didn’t seem hugely interested in him despite the occasional glances thrown his way. He’d completed all the forms for W.R in record time and discovered the efficiency of the inter-departmental memo system as the forms folded themselves into paper aeroplanes and zoomed off out the door.
“Over my dead body!” Draco exclaimed. Harry laughed
She rolled her eyes and smirked.
It was a completely absurd and ridiculous notion after everything they had been through. Their differences and history seemed insurmountable. He would understand if Malfoy could never think of him in that way, after what he’d done to him with that stupid curse. He sighed heavily as he pulled his thoughts away from that dark place.
He cursed Harry’s timing as he turned back to the room. Sighing as he rubbed his face again. Draco supposed that it would give him time to write a suitable reply whilst giving him time to mull over the possibility of attending the gathering.
Swallowing, he wasn’t sure what to say; they hadn’t discussed telling people yet.
“Even if I were as straight as an arrow, I don’t think I would ever consider it.” Draco sneered. If he was honest with himself, he had considered it, on many occasions but not in the same way as Blaise. He often wondered what Harry saw in her. What made Harry groan in the dark.
“Absolutely nothing, Between Hermione and myself, everything is under control!” Draco smiled.
Memories of the Triwizard tournament and his crush on Cho Chang fluttered in his memory. He shook his head, hoping to shake them loose as he sat at one of the large round tables in the new and ‘improved’ great hall at Hogwarts. He hadn’t seen it since the battle, but he didn’t like the changes. Some up-and-coming magical architect had come in with their new-fangled ideas of what would make a statement.
Noomi was almost as dark as Patrik was pale. Her skin still held that pale, flawless tan that was typical of the Nordic peoples; however, her hair was as black as pitch and shaved on one side. A mixture of plaits and dreadlocks graced her shoulders and jewellery seemed to pierce each spare millimetre on her right earlobe.
Draco realised that Rolf was darker than he’d imagined, his complexion close to the colour of milky coffee. With the last name of Scamander, he assumed that the grandson of the famous magizoologist would be as pale as the pictures of his ancestor. Rolf’s brown eyes looked him up and down as though Draco wasn’t what had been expected either. Still, he offered his hand with a genuine smile.
“It was lovely. It’s great having Rose back from school; however, she and Hugo are bickering like cats and dogs again already. Ron was working, so it was just the three of us.” She rolled her eyes as she glanced at her children, who were huddled suspiciously at the other end of the table with the others. Teddy had opted to stay with the adults as Fred, Roxanne, Rose, and Hugo huddled over a chessboard. Somehow while his mind had been elsewhere, the dynamics had shifted, leaving him at the adult end of the table.
“Then If you want to return to the manor, you may,” He made sure to phrase the reply as a suggestion, not an order. Binky nodded, and before he could say more, there was a loud crack, and she was gone.
“Trust in me. It is a surprise worth the risk,” He patted Draco’s shoulder as he passed him.
“You’re being ridiculous. So Weasley is not going to the newspapers, and so what if he tells Potter?” Blaise shrugged.
“Looks like he was confunded too.” Said Blaise.
“No, Madam, How dare you? Were you present at the trials of my friend here?” The hatted witch didn’t answer as she looked at Blaise as if he had grown a second head. “No? So you wouldn’t have heard the testimony which acquitted him? That’s interesting, so you probably didn’t know that Harry Potter was only able to defeat the dark lord because my good friend here threw him his wand.” The two witches looked appalled at this obvious lie. Why would a death eater aid Harry Potter? “That was fifteen years ago, Ladies. How dare you assume you know all the facts about him,” Blaise explained firmly, his lips forming a tight line.
“Fire call me tomorrow?” He asked quietly, as if afraid to ask for anything.
“Good lesson, everyone! I have a very good feeling about all of you for your exam next week. Now, remember, refresh your memories on all the creatures we’ve covered and also their corresponding jinx’s, If anyone feels like they need any more help,  my office is open all day Tuesday as the 7th years will be sitting their N.E.W.T’s.” He turned and moved behind his desk as he picked up his book with the homework in “Now, to help your revision, I have marked the homework you handed to me yesterday, please come to the front and collect your papers.” He held them out as he started to call out his students names.
“Draco? You mean ‘Uncle’ Draco?” Ted’s brown eyes widened in surprise, a biscuit halfway to his mouth.
“Stop!”
“What did he do to her?” Molly asked only to be admonished by Arthur as he passed through to get his cup of tea.
“We’ll all have to do something soon,” He promised vaguely.
“What-?” He started, squeezing the words around the heart in his throat. It occurred to him, belatedly, that he should reach for his wand.
“Please, Harry. This gives you another reason to contact him too. It’ll be great,” Ted smiled, his excitement almost contagious.
“What?”
“He is a sweetheart!” Luna insisted, “He’s written to me over the years about all the things he’s seen, and he always remembers my birthday” Luna smile sweetly. “Quite surprising really, we didn’t talk to each other before I was kidnapped.”
Harry looked at his glass and wondered whether he’d be pushing it if he downed this one too. He decided against it and sipped it instead, rolling the tumbler around in his hands as soon as it was back on the table. His mind wandered back to Charlie and Malfoy. They had potentially been a couple which, in turn, meant Malfoy could like guys. He felt a tingle of excitement run up his spine before he dismissed the thought.
“He must do. He looked dejected when I mentioned her, now that I come to think about it,” Draco reasoned as he rubbed his face. His interaction with Harry now made so much more sense. His behaviour and reticence screaming that there was something wrong. He’d watched him for almost the entirety of the Weird Sisters gig and wondered why his face looked so stony and saturnine. Even his interaction with Hermione had seemed particularly despondent as he’d knocked back his whiskey then staring longingly at the glass for another. Draco knew the signs. He still saw them in himself from time to time.
“I can already see your eyes rolling when you find that I haven’t addressed this letter, but truth be told, I didn’t know how to begin. Any title I could think of was either too insulting or too personal. As we’re not enemies anymore, I thought I’d play it safe.
Draco nodded before a violent shiver shook him. Harry pulled his wand from the back pocket of his nearby discarded jeans and cast a warming charm on them both. “So, my question again. Are you hungry?” He asked with a chuckle as he nuzzled his face against Draco’s cheek, peppering kissed along the sharp jawline. Draco nodded again, still not ready to speak. Harry pushed himself up with a groan as he cleaned them up with a wave of his wand. They redressed as they stole glances at each other’s bare flesh, wondering when they would see them naked again. A few minutes later found them cuddled up in the blanket and cushions surveying the feast before them.
“Mi, we’ve not seen him in fifteen years. So I don’t think we can say that we know his character anymore.” Draco closed his mouth as Weasley flashed him a slight smirk.
He looked at the file Rolf had left him and began to read, his muggle notepad next to him lying patiently, waiting for a note-worthy discovery. He started with the witch; Muggles disappeared all the time, but witches didn’t just vanish without a trace these days. Not unless she didn’t want to be found.
Draco felt his heart stutter at the mention.
“So you’ve not tried to kill any students off this term?” Draco smirked, raising his eyebrow.
“All the time!” Draco teased.
Draco answered Muggle without thinking. His mind rushed back to previous meals. Muggle establishments were more inconspicuous, and he was usually able to finish a meal in peace. In wizarding establishments, he rarely got to order his food. However, it had been years; maybe things were different now.
“We’re not teenagers anymore. I didn’t think you’d go to the effort of saving me, only to kill me fifteen years later.” He laughed softly, and Harry thought that the sound was endearing. “you’re not, are you?” he asked, arching one of his fine, white brows.
Something caught around his ankles, sending him careening forward towards the floor. His cheekbone took the brunt of the fall, sending a blinding flash of light behind his eyes. He groaned before he heard a snicker coming from the lifts.
“Sorry, Professor Potter,” They all intoned before laughing.
“Why are you wearing it? For all we know, it’s cursed,” Said Hermione. “Did you even think to check?” She asked sternly.
They turned a corner, and Draco felt his feet stop. His mouth went dry almost instantly as his heartbeat faltered. Harry stood, shirtless and shiny, as he scooped out the coals only to turn them over. Draco’s eyes followed every bend and curve, each swell and contour and licked his lips absently. It took him a few moments to notice Patrik removing and returning the eggs to the heating nests. He, too, was shirtless and slick with sweat. Noomi’s face also looked distracted and red. They looked at each other and chuckled heatedly.
He scrunched his nose up in disgust. The high ceiling was no long bewitched to reflect the weather outside. Apparently, that enchantment had been lost to the ages. Instead of the cloudy night threatening snow, the new ceiling now depicted scenes from Hogwarts’ battle. The centrepiece “the downfall of Voldemort” could rival the Sistine Chapel in Rome. Each Horcrux had a tableau of equally beautiful and awful imagery surrounding them as the images danced like a kaleidoscope. Riddles diary wrapped in sleek snake-like coils and copper red hair; Salazar Slytherin’s locket, shrouded with trees; Ron stood before it, holding the sword of Gryffindor. Each tableau reawakened an old nightmare as the pictures moved and danced together.
“Who’s for pudding?” She called and smiled when the table erupted in affirmative cries, putting an end to any bickering.
“Do you want to come for a walk with me? Or do you need some help up here?”
“And you wouldn’t have me any other way,” Harry whispered as he leaned in for a kiss. Their lips met softly as Draco’s arms dropped from his chest, one hand winding his fingers into Harry’s damp, unruly hair, the other stroking the soft, dark hair at his jaw. Harry’s hands found their way to his back, where he pulled the other man close.
“So, where’s Hermione?” Asked Harry changing the subject. Ron noticed and rolled his eyes with a smile before letting the subject switch.
He stepped into the green blaze, gripping his bag to his side as he felt whipped away through fireplace after fireplace, the air around him sucked away. Before long, he stepped out and into the atrium of the ministry amongst the other wizards and witches; The black and green tiles giving the hall a dark and oppressive feeling. His sense of the place may have been down to his apprehension. He tried to remember a muggle book he’d read when he was younger about an emerald city.
That chair there was where the dark lord sat when he used the cruciatus curse on your mother. The sideboard to the right was where Greyback smashed a decanter and then proceeded to use the broken glass on your flesh; Drawing your blood only to lick it off again and repeat. Over there was where Bellatrix held Harry captive, his strong features puffed and swollen beyond recognition.
‘you caught the snitch but captured my heart.’
“Seriously. It’s been fifteen years. Get over it!” Called Weasley to the glaring wizards and witches as the gates closed and they began their descent. Silence filled the lift, despite the groaning and clunking as the lift rocked and shuddered its slow way deeper into the earth. “Morning, Malfoy. How are you feeling? Better?” Weasley offered. Draco glanced up, surprised. He noted that Weasley’s freckled face was as serious and genuine as it had seemed at the hospital.
“Have you spoken to Charlie recently?”
Draco noticed a few notes towards the bottom. He was impressed at the thoughts the Auror had about the couple’s disappearance. They’d even included some suggestions of what may have caused it, including Trow’s. Draco nodded to himself in agreement; Trows could be just as malevolent as fairies if they chose to be. He glanced at the signature and rolled his eyes as he saw Ronald’s scrawl.
He sighed and folded it before he could change his mind. He Accio’d an envelope and put it in the basket next to Peppin’s perch. He stroked the soft, downy feathers of the birds head as the bright yellow eyes slowly opened up to gaze at him.
“Why am I here?” He asked, hoping that the voice would tell him something.
“Are you enjoying the party?” Malfoy asked again.
“I see you have received many gifts,” He said brightly pointing to the gifts and paper scattered over the floor. Draco followed his gaze and nodded, feeling very loved. His hand touched his chest and the pendant below.
It was most definitely a grumpy age; he attempted to convince himself as he sipped his almost forgotten drink. Running the cold glass between his hands as he rested his elbows on the table, he scanned the faces around him as if looking for someone specific. Some of them were familiar to him, but some had changed beyond all recognition. Every face was 15 years older, and some wore the years better than others. He wasn’t sure whether he’d weathered them any better. His once black hair was beginning to become peppered with grey and white, and while he complained about it, he secretly liked the change.
“You need to let the family know cause when it does hit the headlines, people will be annoyed that you didn’t warn them,” Harry could hear the word ‘Again’ hang in the air.
“Well, I’m sure you’ll find the evidence to prove that he did something,” Molly said with a determined nod before calling the children to attend. They all scrabbled for a plate, all except Harry, who stared at his hands as he thought about Draco lying hexed in a restaurant. A blind Draco. It chilled him enough he shivered.
“Has he ever told you how they left school?” Harry asked before checking the map again. Filch hadn’t moved.
“Sounds hazardous to my health, suddenly I feel like I should enter,”
Draco felt his mouth dry out, and his eyes water. He opened his mouth to say thank you when the snitch started to open. Draco watched it as he swallowed. Inside was a small golden heart with a garnet set in the centre. Draco tore his eyes away from it to Harry, who smiled indulgently. “Oh, Harry, It’s beautiful” He croaked, his voice betraying how touched he was.
“It was not the trouble; I saw you coming up from the chalet” She smiled as she struggled to lower herself into the chair opposite, Patrik rushed around to help her. His love for her obvious in the way he smiled at her.
Hope you are feeling better after the incident at the weekend.
“Thank you,” Draco replied as he stood from the floor.
“Hmm, maybe Charlie is right, maybe he has changed”, Said Hermione, impressed. “That would have been a good way to curse you. You’re too trusting, Harry!”
The cold air hit him, stealing his breath as he stepped out onto the steps, the large wooden door creaking as it closed. He cursed again as it dawned on him that in his panic, he’d left his coat back inside. No way was he going back in there for a while. He shook his head, hoping for his bearings to realign. He wasn’t sure what had happened there; maybe the whiskey had gone to his head. He paced as his thoughts ran riot in his mind. He didn’t know how to assemble the information that had fallen unceremoniously into his lap. He knew he liked men, and he knew that men pressed his buttons in a way that Ginny never did. But Malfoy? Why him?
“Dray, one of the old ladies, hit you with a curse. We need to go and get it checked out.”
“You brought Elderflower wine.” Draco kissed Harry’s face tenderly. “Harry, you didn’t need to do all this!”
Draco knew that his astonishment showed on his face. Of course, Luna had mentioned her father’s death in her letters, so that was no surprise; the invitation, however, rendered him speechless.
“You?” He asked. And felt relief when Blaise seemed to understand.
“I didn’t want to burden anyone with it, Ted. I’m embarrassed and gutted that we couldn’t make it work. I’m dreading the moment the Prophet get hold of the story. It’s all such a mess.” Harry leant forward as he ran his fingers through his hair, pulling it tightly.
“Sounds like a plan,” Fred grinned eagerly, reminding Harry of his uncle so acutely.
“Hey!” Draco protested.
“Love you,” Draco said quickly.
“Absolutely not. I find that, in the field, it’s easier to use magic; however, the effect is never the same nor as accurate. Also, I’ve had some instances where the magic can disturb the creature. The muggle way is a better way,”
“I don’t know about the always.” She paused “But we have done for many years. There is an ancient building down the lake which my Mormor would tell was Viking. We used it as the hatching place for centuries until it couldn’t be maintained any longer.”
“Could I have a ham and cheese sandwich, please?” Harry asked and noted how Kreacher seemed to soften more when he used his manners.
“You didn’t need to go to all this trouble for me!” He said as he motioned for her to sit down, worried that she might give birth at any second.
He heard the ancient grandfather clock in the drawing-room strike, and his blood ran cold. He was running late. He looked at the parchment and owl and shook his head.
Harry nodded as he followed their host towards the other houses.
“That’s what I thought. So I did some digging. I managed to track down the others in the restaurant when the hexing went down, y’know? Get a wider perspective. Well, I found some and even got Tassik, the owner, to donate his own. He didn’t want to be seen as not being helpful, apparently. It also turns out Bill eats there regularly; He usually orders the Tagliata steak-”
“Great to meet you, Scorpius,” Harry offered as he shook the younger boys hand. “You look so much like your dad when we were kids,”
“Why are you blushing, Harry? It makes you look very dashing,” Luna smiled kindly, tilting her head as she studied him.
~~~~~~~~~~
Draco sat, speechless in the suddenly quiet bed-chamber. His eyes couldn’t help gaze at the deep red garnet which shimmered with a wine-coloured fire. It was stunning. He pulled it out and, realising it was on a chain, undid the clasp. With shaking hands, he placed the pendant around his neck, feeling its comforting weight above his heart. The metal was surprisingly warm against his skin. He smiled as the sweet excitement rubbed against his insides. It was a superb gift. His attention returned to the now-closed snitch, the writing, now invisible once again. He pressed his back against the bed and took a deep breath. Harry had that effect on him.
“I know, right? I wonder if it’s because he’s rubbish in bed?”
He looked at the familiar yet strange wand in his hand before meeting Harry’s eyes. They shared a look of understanding before holding it out to him. The former-Gryffindor nodded and took it, weighing it and held it up to his ear before disappearing into the back room with it.
“This week, not all that much. Truth be told. Being so close to Christmas, the office shuts down. However, when the new year starts is when the real work begins. The role we’ve asked you to aid us with is a rather hush-hush affair.” He waved his wand, causing the door to close behind him. Draco turned and watched as several shadows crept away from the office. It looked like the rest of the staff also wanted to hear about the Wampus Cat or, more probably, the secret role.
“The food here is sublime,” Draco admitted as he admired the empty plate. Secretly wishing he had ordered double.
“Malfoy, wait.”
Harry/Potter/Scarhead/Whatever.”
“Binky? Is everything alright?”
“I see you’re asking the usual obvious questions still, Potter! Why else would we be in a wand shop?” The former-Gryffindor paused for a second before smiling at the remark. Draco swallowed as he tried to keep his emotions in check. He had never seen that smile directed at him. It unnerved him.
”I’m sure I could shock you with just how much I know, Malfoy.”
“And the rest!” Ron chuckled before taking another sip of his mead. He waggled his eyebrows so that Harry was in no doubt as to what he meant. “But whatever you do, don’t talk about it in front of Mum,”
“I will never live this down!” He muttered, loud enough for them all to hear before sitting straighter in his chair and looking at Harry. “I was only out of Durmstrang a year when my friends convinced me to join the annual broom race.” He paused as he rolled his eyes again and threw a knowing smile to Noomi. “My friends had convinced me that, should I win, I would be famous, and my future would be bright. I had very little money and no job so I decided to race. What choice did I have?” He asked with a shrug. Harry nodded in agreement. “So, I left Koppaberg and began flying, the first hour was alright, but after that, the cold became unbearable. I could bearly hold my broom, and a storm was rolling off the mountains.”
I also commented on the places that you’ve travelled to as I’ve seen the collection of postcards you sent to my Godson. I’m glad you’ve been able to see all these beautiful places. I have to know, though, what is Paris like? I’ve always wanted to visit.
”True, ” Weasley nodded with an answering smile as he straightened up. ”well, I’ve asked all the questions I need to, and I think I may have worn Malfoy out. So I’ll take my leave. If you remember anything else, drop me an owl.”
He knew the answer to every question, but it still seemed like the wrong decision. He could have stayed and remained inconsequential to the man with the eyes that were not quite green enough and hair the colour of copper in the sunlight. He could have carried on, wondering whether they could be anything more, but he knew he couldn’t be happy, not like that. There was only so much punishment he could take. He had to move on; he had to stop running.
He hated being in this house and how it made him feel. It was as though Voldemort had turned the whole manor into a giant Horcrux. As if the house could influence his thoughts and feelings, pushing him to the brink. Draco knew what a Horcrux was now after reading the notes from the trials and Harry’s testimonies.
“Capillus de canis!” Draco muttered to himself as he looked at the vial. “Genius! You must either get me the recipe or ship me a few crates.”
“So, Draco tells me you like to cook?” Noomi asked as she looked up from her loaded plate a few minutes later. Harry nodded, mouth full of potato.
“It’s not right,” Harry said firmly. They all shook their heads in disbelief. Molly huffed as she levitated the plate of rhubarb crumble onto the table between them all.
“Sounds wonderful” Draco replied as he gazed hungrily at the food. “What are you trying to do? Fatten me up?”
“I know. I heard. Congratulations on the children too; Charlie showed me photos,” Draco tried to smile.
“But not this morning,” Noomi smirked as she lifted her tea to her mouth, avoiding his eyes. She lowered her cup and went on “Not after last night” she blushed at this, and Harry understood. He chuckled bashfully as he took another spoon of porridge, feeling his blush spread up his face.
He took a swig of his tea again before he continued, but Noomi jumped in.
Draco closed the window then carefully untied the twine holding the small package to the owl’s foot. Once untied, he left a few treats on the side and returned to the fire. The parcel was only about an inch in every dimension. He looked at it with confusion before looking at Harry.
“Happy Birthday.” He beamed as his head disappeared and the fire extinguished with a whoosh.
They stayed like that a few moments as he watched Malfoy’s Adam’s apple bob as the taller man swallowed. The Slytherin’s eyes glanced up to his, and Harry watched as he carefully built up his mask again as he smirked.
“Please sit, Binky.” He offers as he sits at his desk “You must be tired, travelling all this way,” He saw the shock cross her face before she sat down on the floor.
“But why?” He snapped back. Anger had always been his fall back in situations like these.
Draco stood and rubbed his chin as his mind raced. He couldn’t for the life of him, think why there would be a charm which dissolved at thirty-five. Thirty-five was a rather random number. He shrugged and resolved to speak to Harry about it later and also to his mother upon his return home.
“No, Master. No strange owls have called, and Peppin returned without a reply.”
If there were two things he didn’t want on his first day, it was being on the receiving end of an angry wand or being reminded of his Skrewts lessons at school. He followed Rolf out into the main office, which had become somewhat fuller during their meeting. They wove their way through desks and chairs as Rolf pointed to a desk opposite the main office door. He was glad to note that he was also by one of the enchanted windows, uplifting his mood tenfold.
“Thought we could ask the elves for some ice cream, but they’ve all gone to bed.” Teddy shrugged. “So we were going to chat and stuff for a bit before going back to our common rooms.”
Harry practically fell into the sofa as the green afterglow faded from the fire, his eyes burning and sore from his day at the office. He pulled his glasses off and threw them onto the seat next to him as he rubbed at his tired face. Stubble was rough along his jaw and chin, and he knew that a shave was needed soon before it grew into a beard. Maybe he should just let it grow; He’d often thought about it, but Ginny hadn’t liked beards, so that had been the end of it.
“That’s no good; it would take us forever to draw him somewhere useful.” Harry shook his head.
He opened his eyes just as the large fire roared to life. The smaller and more conservative candles in the wall sconces blinking on, one after another. He felt a knot release faintly as he collapsed into the old, faded armchair before he accioed the hidden bottle of firewhisky to his waiting hand. He felt relieved when he noticed that Binky, the only remaining house-elf, was absent. He always felt her silent judgement in those large saucer-like eyes.
“Noomi should be through here,” he motioned as he walked off through a far door. Harry followed after him, his eyes everywhere.
Draco nodded but remained quiet, not exactly sure how to respond. Instead, he cast a surreptitious glance at the pair of them and wondered why they were acting so civil.
“Don’t you worry your world-saving socks. Patrik’s good looking, but he’s not my type!” Draco smirked, he did enjoy teasing the thin jealous streak Harry had.
The wooden door swung open as Patrik stepped in. He smiled, bright white teeth flashing between his lips.
There had been very few people invited to the wedding, and it coincided with the night he had discovered Ginny’s affair. Neither had been in the frame of mind to attend, nor had he seen the man since. He wondered whether Neville thought it was a reflection of his distaste for his new bride, and whilst Pansy Parkinson-now Longbottom was hardly his favourite person, he just hoped that he was happy after all.
“Good Afternoon, Mr Malfoy. My name is Joyce, and I’m the mediwitch in charge of your case during your stay with us.”
Draco pouted for a moment before shrugging and nodding.
So there were no links that he could see between them and no signs of foul play either. However, the file was missing almost all the information he needed. Where had Orla gone to paint? Where had she last been seen? Her husband reported that she had apparated at lunchtime with her paints but didn’t return. However, unlike Weasley, the investigating Auror hadn’t thought to put any notes with their suppositions in the file. Draco closed his eyes as he tried to organise the information in his mind.
“I haven’t read about it in the papers, so they must be keeping it to themselves. Maybe Potter doesn’t mind sharing?” Blaise smirked, winking at him. Draco couldn’t find it in himself to reply. His mind was still reeling.
Draco closed his eyes again, hoping that Weasley would get the message.
He felt a swell of sadness when he realised that the manor would be devoid of all the fanfare this year, and he couldn’t bear to enter most of the rooms, let alone decorate them. There would be no tree this year nor presents. He might be able to convince Binky to make something festive, but he would get no joy from eating it alone.
“Nothing. Just noticed that Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins turned up,” Harry muttered as his eyes followed the blond hair through the crowd. “I’m not sure I’d have been brave enough to show up here after everything.” He continued, slightly impressed by the boldness. He caught sight of Hermione shaking her head.
They all stopped, and silence descended on them with just the thud of the music beyond their bubble.
Whilst this was partly true, his mind seemed to be flitting between the loss he felt at Ginny’s absence and the unfinished letter sitting on his desk at home destined for a particular pointy blond. The greeting of his letter was both pathetic and stupid, and he knew that Malfoy would roll his eyes and sneer as soon as his eyes danced across the words. He wished he could write the perfect letter, addressing all the things he wanted to say. But, he had never been eloquent, and his handwriting, he knew, was atrocious. His main ambition was to open up communication between them, that and to return the jacket.
“Got a headache”, Harry mumbled, not ready to have that particular talk with his now ex-brother-in-law.
“Yeah, the crazy knight that’s always trying to pick a fight?” She nodded and pointed to the lonely corridor where the painting was located.
“Hello, Kreacher,” Harry offered, making the small elf jump.
“But how did you know where I was?”
“Hem Nisse” cried Patrik from behind him “Is she yours?” He asked.
The ward magic pressed against his skin, recognising him as master before the candles in the chandeliers erupted into life, washing the entrance hall in a warm yellow glow. There was nothing friendly or welcoming about the entrance hall. Still, Draco kept his eyes downcast as he followed his feet to the kitchen. He closed his eyes, navigating the way blind. He tried to silence his mind as it silently narrated his journey.
He smiled as the messy green and red hair appeared in the doorway. Teddy Lupin had forgone his favoured turquoise for something a bit more festive. Harry had to hold his breath as he gazed at the lanky youth who looked every inch his father’s son. It both warmed and broke his heart when he saw his godson looking so much like Remus. Teddy offered a dopey smile, which was all Tonks as he rubbed his tired and creased face.
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you!” He replied as he knocked back one of the whiskeys, emptying the glass completely
Someone converted to Muggles big time. Looking good, D!” He watched as Blaise’s gaze travelled down to his black boots and back up again and nodded his approval. He gave the barest smile as he grabbed his scarf.
“Now that wasn’t very nice. Why would you ruin a perfectly good meal for yourselves by harassing my friend here?”
“Of course. It was a few years ago now.” Draco started as he pushed further into the office. His nerves were slowly calming. Whether it was the fresh cool air or the excited glean in his new boss’s eye. He smiled slightly at the apparent interest in what he had to say. It felt like a lifetime since he’d had a virtual stranger look at him like that.
“Have you seen the Prophet recently?” Rolf asked, and Draco shook his head. He didn’t pay any attention to the tabloid unless a certain dark-haired wizard was featured on the cover.
“He didn’t say that,” Blaise answered, “Did you, Weasley?”
He’d also started on the case; He was determined to do a good job, ready for when his colleague rejoined him. At least if he could narrow down the details and create a few leads, he’d have a concrete foundation to start the case in earnest after the Christmas holidays. It might even ingratiate himself to Cosima. He felt content with the progress he’d made so far, despite the paperwork strewn across his desk.
“I wish I didn’t have to leave, but one more week and you’ll be home,” Harry smiled encouragingly as he gently kissed the blond again.
“Divorce?” Neville asked, his face pale with shock.
“I will. Goodnight.”
His heartbeat and breathing couldn’t hide the laughter, nor could it blot out the sloshing footsteps getting closer. Trembling involuntarily, his tired body tried to fight off the cold as he twisted his head around to try and listen. His life could depend on him knowing more.
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. He wasn’t sure that he was ready to have people over, but the look on teddy’s face told him that there was no getting out of it.
“Is Sir Cadogan’s portrait still on the seventh floor?” They all shook their head except Victoire.
“Draco,” The voice called again and Draco to flinch. The room began to turn as he twirled around. “Shit! Draco. Hold still, and I’ll let you go.”
Draco rested his face in his hands, wishing that the anxiety he felt gurgling away at his solar plexus would disperse but didn’t hold out hope. He let his hands fall into his lap as he closed his eyes. He wished that he had stayed home. He could have avoided the hex and also the catastrophe that was meeting Weasley.
There was a moment of silence around the table. Harry felt a wave of guilt at the mention of Neville and his new wife. It had been a surprise to them all when the unlikely pair had gotten married, and it was still unclear whether it was a pureblood marriage contract or a love match.
Why did his life revolve around a handshake? A handshake with a child? That was probably the thing that had thrown him the most. He knew that Harry was a genial and warm person, just never to him. He had expected surprise and suspicion; he had expected the conversation to be much shorter and less friendly. He’d also expected it to be less enjoyable, but catching the occasional snort and chuckle from Harry suggested that the exchange hadn’t been unpleasant for him.
When, on Thursday, he saw three Ravenclaws, five Gryffindors and a Hufflepuff out of bed together, he groaned, and he placed his quill down. He picked up his wand and map and went off in search of the misfits. It was no surprise the map led him to a portrait of a bowl of fruit. He rolled his eyes as he tickled the pear. As the picture swung open, there were hushed whispers from within.
“It was brilliant.” Harry nodded, remembering the fireworks. That had been the highlight of his third year. “It doesn’t look like Filch is shifting. We’re going to have to be Slytherin about this.”
The sight of him made Draco smile, and suddenly, the darkening kitchen didn’t seem quite so lonely. He pushed the doodle to one side as he considered his new job role.
“I’m serious, you lot! You lot make me reconsider teaching as a profession!” He perched on the bench next to Rose as he looked up the table. The only Weasleys not around the table were the two youngest still at home with their parents.
He would often find himself getting hot under the collar thinking about such things, and it was never her he thought about to quench his appetites. He blushed at this admission to himself as though the whole room could hear him. He’d often thought about the men in his life and had come to the realisation that he was at the very least Bi-sexual.
It was apparent now, looking back, that they were doomed to fail. Harry had withdrawn into himself, just plodding through life, where Ginny had embraced life, wanting to get out of it everything she could. To climb out from under his depressing shadow.
“You can shut it. Where are the students?” He asked. Mrs Norris sniffed around the corridor, sparing him a glance before turning her nose up and walking back to Filch.
He looked at the green jacket which hung from a hanger on the wall. He wanted to return it to stop looking at it and visualising the blond in it. But, the more he looked at it, the more he tried to decern the hidden machinations behind Malfoy’s actions. Surely, he couldn’t have done it for the reasons he’d said, could he? He pulled at his hair again before forcing his eyes away from the jacket.
“He’s got a good point,” Hermione shrugged apologetically.
“Come on you. You can’t seriously, be jealous? You have everything that most men want. A brilliant career, loads of money and a gorgeous blond on your arm. You have absolutely nothing to be worried about.” Draco paused as he watched the smile break through the mask. “And once we’re married, I’ll be all yours, magically, physically and legally!” Harry beamed for a moment before speaking again.
“Ronald Weasley, I know you have him,”
“I’m well aware of that, Granger. Unfortunately, you were not the only one who studied Latin at school.” He replied tersely before closing his eyes. He thought he was better than this.
“I’ll ask Rolf whether Draco has changed.” She smiled again, her eyes bright and wide.
“Great class, Uncle Harry,” Said Louis with a grin. His pale ginger hair, hanging around his shoulders in an ‘intentionally-dishevelled’ look. Harry knew it was down to Fleur’s Veela genes, but the kid always looked great and knew that the girls would love him as he grew. Roxanne’s dark hair was pulled back into a bushy ponytail at the nape of her neck, giving her a no-nonsense air.  Lucy reminded Harry so much of her dad, Percy Weasley, but thought that it was lucky that she seemed to take more after her mother. The other Weasley’s certainly were good influences on her and her sister.
“Merlin, No!” Ron gasped with a snort, a grin forming on his lips.
Luna nodded; the irony lost on her.
“And you really think Draco would want to come?”
“It appears that Mr Malfoy suffers from anxiety and panic attacks. Understandably, it appears that the incident earlier exacerbated his symptoms. Nothing to be concerned about, however worth noting in your report.” The mediwitch smiled kindly at Draco before talking again. “What I will do is arrange for a course of treatment aimed to reduce your anxiety. You’ll be able to collect it from the dispensary along with a follow-up decoction which will need to consumed when you get home.”
“Maybe. Shame Harry doesn’t play anymore; he was also a sight to behold. Utterly fearless; And always quite fetching in his Quidditch robes. Although I must admit, I always preferred the white trousers to the later grey ones.” Blaise reminisced with a playful glance towards Draco. He scowled, which caused Blaise to chuckle. “Draco, dear. That look hasn’t worked on me since second year. Also, you can’t tell me that you don’t agree.”
Draco paused before he nodded mutely. “Why did you lend Harry your jacket at the party?”
Draco nodded, he couldn’t imagine growing a human within himself, and the thought of living in that state for nine months was unthinkable. But, if he could get pregnant, he would stay in bed the whole time, just in case he did something that could hurt the baby. He had often thought about having children someday. But, even after everything that had happened in his youth, he still wanted someone that would pass on the Malfoy name. He just wasn’t sure that his life was open to that anymore.
His heartbeat stole from him any hint of where they could be taking him, stealing yet another sense- the obscuro curse still firmly in place. His parched throat caused his breath to come in short, shallow gasps. Needle-like pain shooting through him with every step. He was so tired. He had tried fighting, but now he struggled to lift one foot in front of the other. Only the fingers digging into his biceps kept him upright as they continued to descend. The only thing Harry was sure of was that they were doing down. The air grew increasingly cool and damp as only the air underground can. His nose grew colder as the air chilled his skin. At a guess, there were at least three people with him. One either side and another ahead guiding the way. His mind darted from thought to thought. How to escape? Where was his wand? Where was he?
Weasley shook his head, looking between them.
“Right, let’s take him to St Mungo’s. I need him sensible to answer my questions.”
“Don’t hex me” Chuckled a low voice as Draco’s hand jumped to his wand.
“We’re both adults, Ted. He can owl you if he wants to. In fact, I’d love to see some of those postcards.”
He sat surrounded in his presents and cards when a knock came at the door.
“Come on,” Blaise growled as he herded Draco towards the floos.
“Indeed, a veritable mine of information.” Draco agreed, his mind darting back briefly to Ginny’s supposed affair. “Were you able to find out any other dig up any more gems, or did the vein run dry?”
The young Gryffindors pulled a face before smirking. The old school rivalries were still there, but Slytherin was no longer the evil house. Now, the plan is to find Peeves. Get him to cause some ruckus within earshot of Filch and then stand back as he rushes to investigate.
“Excuse me; I am old enough to be your mother. How dare…”
“Good Morning,” She smiled, her dark brown eyes twinkled as she levitated a bowl down on the table and motioned for him to sit.
“Thanks,” Ted replied with a smirk. “I know you’re just getting me to shut up, but you are right. There is just too much homework to do before we go back. Are we still eating at the Burrow tonight?”
“Just ignore them, Draco,” Blaise said, covering his hand with his own. Draco nodded slowly as he tried to regain control of his heart, which threatened to burst through his chest.
“It’s just as well that I trust you both with my life, isn’t it?” Harry muttered with an eye roll and a smile.
“Nice to know you’re picking up the Quidditch lingo from Ron” Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Salazar! I brought her up in the conversation.” He covered his face.
As Draco sat in the Goblin-owned restaurant with his house-elf waitress, eating a delicious Caprese salad with spiced Hake, he found that he didn’t mind the changes to wizarding Britain in the slightest. As a child, blood purity had confused him, and as a teen and adult, it had brought him nothing but misery. So he welcomed the changes as he sipped his wine and smiled warmly at his lunch companion.
The following week flew by quicker than Harry could have anticipated. The day after had been lovely; he had spent time with Neville as they graded papers together, swapping stories about their pupils and their answers. But, by Monday, his visit to Sweden seemed a world away.
“Don’t worry, Scarhead, I’m not here to fight,” Malfoy said, his toned forearms crossed over the flat of his chest.
“I hope so” Harry nodded “As long as we are Mr and Mr Malfoy-Potter by the end of it, I don’t care” Harry smiled.
Draco frowned. He couldn’t understand how to interact with this version of Ron Weasley. If only he’s smirk or make a snide comment, then he’d be back on solid ground again.
He looked out into the snowy night and decided that the Slytherin wasn’t coming back, and if he waited much longer, he would look a fool if and when he did return. He shook his hair of the snow and re-entered the castle, pushing the large doors with a groan. How he’d not heard it when Malfoy had come out earlier, he didn’t know.
Harry pushed the food around his plate, his mind a world away. The forgotten lasagne steamed away as the Weasleys joked and teased loudly around him. Obviously, school was over for the year as the kids shouted and ran around the table; Molly, Angelina and Hermione calling their children to heel to no avail.
“Oh yeah,” Harry smiled weakly.
Harry took a deep breath as he ordered the words in his head. “I’m not quite sure what happened, to be honest. It was very odd.” He glanced at the jacket again, remembering its warmth. “I went outside for some air, and he appeared behind me.” Hermione squirmed in her seat as if ready to curse him again. “He said I looked cold and draped it around my shoulders.” He felt the heat in all of his face now, embarrassment keeping his teeth clenched.
He jumped at the use of his first name. His apology lost to the wind
“A good plan,” Rolf nodded. “Do you need any files from the archives? I’m just heading there myself.” Draco smiled and nodded eagerly.
“He what? How did you manage that?”
He heard the owl warble again before hopping down to him, his flat saucer-like face tilting to give him a questioning glance.
His mind wandered back to the party as he began to dissect every glance, every potential nuance in what he’d said and done. He’d found that his skills at Potter watching hadn’t diminished with age, and he was still as good at it as he ever was. It was during the lull in the music when Blaise had found him. Weasley and Granger appeared at the table with Harry soon after. Harry had tried to smile, but it hadn’t reached his eyes. He had tried to ignore Harry, giving his best friend all his attention. Blaise had told him about some recent exploit and a run-in with an angry husband when his laughter had stopped. Blaise knew about his crush and had done so since their first year.
Draco’s whole body trembled as he sat on the edge of the bed, gathering his thoughts. He’d slept fitfully, tossing and turning as the hours dragged by like seconds caught in quicksand. He’d even resorted to sipping one of his prescribed anxiety potions. It stilled the humming nerves long enough for him to drift off, only to jump awake again as nightmares resurfaced. So he sat, panting in a pool of sweat as he rubbed his tired face. The usual horrors of the war now included being hexed at the restaurant. He scrambled to find the picture of Harry in his notebook in a bid to calm down. Seeing his laughing face eased something inside. He knew it was ridiculous, but he clung to the drawing like a drowning man.
“Yes Master, She said that the letter was all you required,”
Harry felt his eyebrows raise high enough to touch his hairline. The thought that Charlie and Malfoy could be friends seemed so very unlikely.
“Why don’t you stay, uncle Harry?” Asked Victoire from Teddy’s side. The kids nodded before agreeing that they all wanted him to stay.
Harry paused for a moment before opening his mouth to speak.
“How come? Scared you’ll give something away?” Blaise chuckled with another raise of his eyebrow.
“Indeed, I am. Been fully-fledged now for about six years.”
Harry laughed quietly as his arm rushed around his waist.
“Happy Birthday to you…” Crooned from the fireplace swiftly after the woosh. Draco found himself smiling as he waited for Harry to finish, a warm blush rising in his cheeks. He turned from his desk to see Harry's head hovering in the fireplace and just seeing his face made his insides warm.
“Come on, Uncle! All I can hear is you huffing and grumbling next door to me. You never know, I might be able to help,”
“Hurry up and drink it. I don’t feel I can, in all good conscience, tease you until you are back too almost your normal, snarky self.” Draco could hear the smirk in his voice as Blaise hitched himself up to sit on the counter. As he eyed the vial, the liquid was a murky grey that reminded him of dishwater – unlike all the other bright red Pepperup’s he had ever tried. They reminded him of Christmas decorations at Hogwarts.
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Granger nodded finally, a grudging look of respect and curiosity in her eyes.
“I wanted to. I wanted to remind you of what you were signing on for when we get married.” He smiled as he rested his head against Draco’s nuzzled at his neck.
“I know, right? But Charlie said he’s really changed. Me, George and Bill think that they were more than friends, if you know what I mean?” Ron winked before offering a knowing look to Harry.
“We’ll have to get together sometime. If you’re coming to the Ministry, we could all get lunch?” Said Hermione, hopefully. “Ron and I are on the Second floor” She smiled as she looked at her still-chuckling husband. Harry shook his head.
“I suggested that as I’m only back in Britain for the weekend, we should get together. Your exact response was, and I quote. Yeah, definitely. You should come around for tea.”
“Yeah, it’s a great facility. Albeit very different from the Romanian one. It’s weird seeing all the blues. There aren’t many other breeds here. The conference coordinator, Patrik, is lovely too. He’s gone out of his way to accommodate me.”
He realised that his attention must have drifted as he looked back at Weasley. There was a strange look close to sympathy on his face. It made him feel strangely emotional. He opened his mouth to say something when a voice from the door interrupted.
“Liar,”  Draco huffed as he sipped his coffee.
The office was just as dim as he’d left it, the pile of books waiting for him to finish marking.  He was happy to say that the marked stack was larger than the unmarked, but he still had lots to do. He raised his hands, removed his glasses and rubbed at his eyes. Casting his mind over the next day’s events, he decided that he could probably get away with marking the books tomorrow. Being the last full week, He decided to call it a night.
“Fascinating.” Rolf breathed as he gazed back at the picture. “I believe this skill will be invaluable to you in your new role.”
She smiled, but there was a tightness around her eyes. She nodded and placed a hand on his arm.
“So, Weasley? How long you been an Auror?”
He shook his head as his hands drifted to Harry’s trousers and started to pop the buttons at his fly. Harry moved to his shoulder, scraping teeth across his skin. Draco shuddered as they both sank to the pillows that Harry had arranged. Their clothes were gone in seconds as Harry slowly worked him open, milking him for every filthy sound he could make as he cock grew rigid.
This couldn’t be happening! His blood seemed to sing as the shorter man shifted from one foot to the other.
Harry couldn’t hold back a snort of laughter. “Want your jacket back?” Malfoy seemed to roll his eyes and ignore him as he too, stared into the darkness of the school grounds.
He didn’t want to live the rest of his life in constant fear of his work following him home. After inheriting everything from Sirius and his parents, he had no need for money. He could drift from job to job in search of distractions. His whole life seemed to be in search of the perfect distraction from his nightmares and memories and now his failed marriage. But nothing distracted him for long.
Draco smiled politely, hoping to avoid answering as he followed the darker man through the now-open office door.
They all waved to Luna as she disappeared into the crowd. Taking Luna’s seat, Neville joined them.
He took a deep breath as he tried to extract himself from the memory. He studied the pale marble fireplace and realised that what it represented held more fear for him than staring down a Romanian Longhorn. With that thought, he took a deep breath and swallowed. Taking a handful of Floo powder, he threw it into the fire and called clearly
“Maybe my mother says more in her letter?” He asked, hopefully.
“Where did you have in mind?” Draco asked, rising out of his bed, gripping his blanket to his waist for modesty’s sake.
“I bet Charlie enjoyed that,” Harry said sarcastically.
“I’m sure that if you chose to do anything to me, I could stop you if I wanted to,” Harry replied, feeling a blush rise in his chilled cheeks. He hoped that the cold disguised the gesture. He watched as Malfoy hesitantly brought his hand up to meet his. As their skin touched, Harry was surprised at how rough his skin was and how firm the handshake felt. Malfoy’s skin was cold; his long thin fingers curled around his own gently as warmth built slowly between them.
“It is just up ahead. Not much further,” Patrik replied, pointing to a small gathering of trees ahead. “This is where I will leave you. It is something that you would be best to discover by yourself. Just keep walking until you reach the jetty,” The pale man smiled, as his sandy hair twitched in the wind.
“Utterly famished,” He whispered back into Harry’s mouth before their lips crashed together again.
“A few bits here and there. Apparently, Gwenog Jones is retiring as coach at the end of the season, and there’s going to be a shake-up of the team. According to Lucasta, Harris may be benched, and Larkin may become first Beater.”
“Well, No-”
He glanced around the room and sighed. He knew all hospital rooms looked the same, but he was pretty sure this was the same room he’s stayed in after the trials. The feeling of foreboding remained.
“That Italian where Fortesque’s used to be?” Angelina asked. Ron nodded in response.
“It was. A very illuminating morning. It is now Lunchtime.” She smiled as she placed the paper she had been reading down. She crossed her hands over her bulbous belly and smirked at him. “So, good evening?” she asked, her eyebrows rising curiously. Draco fought the blush as he smiled.
Harry sat down on one of the steps and immediately regretting the decision as the cold penetrated his trousers and leeched the heat from his legs and backside. Images of Malfoy flashed through his head, lean body, dishevelled hair and liquid silver eyes. He pressed his palms into his eyes until white dots graced his vision, hoping to purge his mind’s eye of the images. What was happening to him? It couldn’t be an attraction. It had to be something else. Maybe someone had spiked his whiskey?
“How – How long have you known?”
“No reply?” Harry repeated with a frown. He sat back down and ran his hand through his hair, pulling at it gently as he refused to acknowledge the sense of disappointment niggling away in his chest. Malfoy would’ve turned his nose up at the lack of greeting, but he thought that the promise of getting his jacket back would ensure a reply.
“The band was pretty good, and I have missed the food at Hogwarts. But it was a good night. I had fun.” He scratched his neck as he looked at the floor. “I was just thinking, actually, that it’s a shame that Harry isn’t working today. He could have returned your jacket.”
“WHAT VILLAINS? WHO TRESPASSES UPON MY LANDS? WHO DARES?” The knight spluttered as he tried to pick himself up from the floor, weighted down by his armour. “SCURVY ROGUES!” He shouted into the deserted corridor. Harry stifled a snigger as he heard Filch’s comical footsteps running down the hall.
“How would your husband be able to find that out?” Asked Harry.
“Then why-“
“Oh, Merlin! How I’ve missed you!” Harry cried out as if surprised at the pleasurable sensations building, higher and higher in intensity.
~~~~~
He had taken to jogging the last few months, trying to get fit and trim for the wedding and to get fitter in general. He had found that the previous few years had added a few pounds to his middle, which he had found particularly hard to shift. He grabbed his underwear and joggers from the bag that Patrik had secreted into the cabin last night. He pulled on his shirt, trying to be quiet as he moved around the room. When he was finally dressed, he grabbed his trainers and stepped out, blinking into the bright sunlight.
He sighed and closed his eyes, letting his head fall and rest on the back of the sofa. He tried to ignore the flashing lights of the muggle fairy lights, which Teddy had insisted on putting on the Christmas tree. He opened his eyes and looked at the tree. Unable to see anything but flashing, blurry red and green bubbles without his glasses, he could make out the outline of the tree.
“And you’re sure that my mother had nothing else to add to this letter?” He asked, his eyes narrowed.
“Sure, I’ll bring them down later.” He paused for a second before tilting his head. “Uncle Harry, can I ask you something?”
“Fine!” He repeated. “We are going to more than one place for our honeymoon, and before you say.” He held a hand up as Harry opened his mouth to protest “That’s cheating too, one of the places is in France.”
“Love you too!” Draco muttered, still stunned by the gift.
Harry stepped out of the shower, feeling refreshed after a long day of manual work. He caught sight of himself in the mirror and paused to look. His stomach looked slightly less soft than it had. However, there was definitely some muscle definition appearing on his arms on chest. He nodded in satisfaction; It was nice to know that the hard work was paying off; he just wished there were fewer scars. He sighed as he turned away from the mirror and the reminders of the war.
“I wonder who will take Larkin’s place as second Beater. It’s a risky move. Harris and Larkin had great chemistry in the air.”
“Her and Luna have gone to ‘powder their noses, ’ whatever that means?” Harry shrugged before pulling one of the other whiskeys towards him. He took a sip of his whisky and caught sight of what he could only be described as a walking, lime-green pompom. He choked on his whiskey, causing Ron to turn. How had he not noticed her in the hall sooner? There were more frills on her dress than Ron had on his old hand-me-down dress robes.
“Well, at least we’re onto more than two syllables now,” Draco could hear him smirk.
Another smaller plate appeared with boiled eggs, but they were bright pink and garnished with pink flowers.
“Did you not want to go and dance?” Harry shouted over the music. Ron shook his head and pointed to the three fire whiskeys sitting in a cluster.
“Absolutely not! I remember the fifteen-minute lecture you gave me about wanting to fit into your wedding suit. I wouldn’t dream of doing anything that would reign down your wrath upon me.” Harry said in mock innocence.
“Of course, I will.” Harry smiled as he kissed Draco’s hand. “Break a leg with your conferences this week.”
There were a few people dotted around the restaurant; A younger couple to their left and a pair of older ladies to their right who whispered and cackled conspiratorially. Neither group seemed to pay them any notice, something which Draco was infinitely thankful for.
“But genuinely, I had so many birthdays to make up for that I wanted this one to be special,” Harry said sheepishly. “You wouldn’t let me celebrate it last year because of my studying so…” He trailed off.
“I wasn’t looking directly at them, so I didn’t see them do anything out of the ordinary.”
“Well?” Malfoy asked finally.
“And?” He urged.
“Dad, that’s gross!” Rose complained, chuckling.
He nodded again, not able to argue. Instead, he felt a rush of fear at the idea of going to the hospital alone.
“I told you, I pulled rank,” Harry grinned.
“What makes you think I never did?” He quirked an eyebrow as the corner of his lip twitched perceptibly. “Goodnight, Harry Potter. Have a wonderful Christmas and a fortuitous new year.“
“Some of his victims have missed their fifteenth birthday and won’t see their children grow up. He deserves the kiss that one!” the hat lady shouted. Draco just wanted to go home. He silently pleaded with Blaise, who rolled his eyes and nodded. Draco felt the world narrow down as a flash of light filled his vision. Suddenly, he was unable to draw in enough breath. Pain overloaded his system, and for a frozen moment, he was back in the Manor being crucio’d before the world went painfully dark.
“Even here we are familiar with the legend of Harry Potter and well-” he paused looking at him and Harry found himself blushing.
“Harry?” Draco muttered, not sure how to react, his heart hammering in his chest.
“Better?” The mediwitch asked.  She smiled at him
“I didn’t think you had.” Draco watched his face, looking for any hint of a lie but saw no trace of duplicity. He lay back in the bed and closed his eyes. Even though his sight was clear, he could feel the strain on them aching in his temples.
Blaise rolled his eyes with a snort as Draco rooted through his bags for something to wear. He really needed to hang his clothes up soon before they became creased beyond repair. He finally decided on a pair of snug-fitting black muggle jeans and a black turtleneck. He’d discovered the joys of muggle shops on his travels and decided to try the jeans that everyone seemed to wear. He was converted and didn’t think robes would ever feel the same again. As he pulled on his fleece-lined leather jacket, he heard Blaise whistle.
“Wasn’t that when you both had bad food poisoning?” Hermione asked, and he nodded, throwing her a swift but thankful smile.
“What are you doing?” Harry found himself asking. He felt the smile fall from his face and wished he could take the words back. He watched as the other man’s smirk also faded back into his mask of vague indifference.
“I agree,”
“Makes me feel old,” Draco muttered, gazing at his now empty glass.
He turned and looked at the floor where he had been lying. The green apple sat in the centre from the night before, along with his sketchbook and pencils. He pulled his wand out and pointed, turning the crisp orb into a makeshift bed as he had done since his arrival a week previous. He peeled off his clothes, not bothering to fold them as he climbed into bed. He closed his eyes and wished for sleep.
“You too, Malfoy.” Harry replied, feeling emboldened added, “No doubt, I’ll see you around sometime.” Malfoy’s mouth opened in surprise before he smiled politely and nodded in agreement.
“What happened to the woman?”
The first two hours were free periods as he’d told the seventh years to enjoy the free time, their exams over and done with forever. Then, with that plan firm in his mind, he proceeded to undress and retire for the night.
They both turned around, an almost-matching look of confusion on their faces. Granger bit her lip and looked at him as she held her files close to her chest. She stared as if he was an equation or riddle she was trying to solve.
“Noomi?” He asked quietly. She turned her head, her moments lingering on Patrik for an extra moment before looking up at him. “Do you have any pots or plates ready for sale?” Noomi nodded and smiled.
“Mum, I spent almost all of Saturday ankle-deep in the office pensieve watching from every angle I could find. That thing is seriously unsanitary.” Ron grumbled with a shiver. “If he did anything, he wouldn’t have been able to imperious everyone before getting hexed.”
He cleared his throat again, bringing him back to the present. “Brightthistle, Knotgrass, Macmillan and of course, the three Weasley’s.”
The taller man opened his mouth to say something but shook his head. He closed his eyes and shook his head before turning back to the wizard and glaring. Draco saw the mediwizard pale and scuttle off behind one of the potion-laden shelves.
He looked at the map for a second and remembered something.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione muttered and smiled, her eyes softening as she gazed at him.
“No doubt.” He turned to leave when Harry said nothing more, their hands slipping reluctantly from each other. Harry watched him go as he walked across the snow-covered courtyard, his feet leaving a trail behind him. A rising desperation to call him back gripped him.
Harry smiled and shook his head.
“You idiot!” She shouted at him. He turned around, shocked.
“She’s,” He paused, suddenly intent on his thumbnail. “We’ve erm,”
“She’s not here tonight.” He replied, forcing the emotion out of his voice.
“Someone hexed him for nothing?” Harry asked. “That can’t be right?”
Such a long time, and so incredibly different. Draco found a spark of hope in his chest. Delicate and weak, he went to snuff it out but stopped. Maybe… Maybe times had changed them both just enough…
“He does? And he let you come alone?”
“His mother died?” Asked Harry
“Unbelievable,”
“What did she say?” He asked quietly, not sure he was ready to hear.
“A journalist apparently, One of the ‘Seeker Weekly’ or ‘Which Broom’ lot. Apparently, they’ve been leaving the training grounds together more often than not.” Draco covered his mouth in horror.
The Swede took it and gave it a quick but firm shake as he smiled back. Harry watched as his gaze passed behind him, looking for Draco. He smirked as his eyes drifted back to Harry.
“I miss you too! The conference should be over by this time next week, and then I’ll be home, and we can get married.” They both grinned.
“It sounded more than acceptable,” Draco opened his mouth and blushed violently.
He offered his hand into the space between them, causing Malfoy to look down. His face seemed to pale further as he stared at the offered hand. Harry realised the significance of the gesture as he held it firmly out to the blond.
“Good Morning,” Draco greeted with a smile, he looked around, but there was no sign of Harry at all.
“That’s rough. I’m sorry you missed it. It would’ve been great to have you there. I thought that… you know… You and Pansy haven’t always seen eye to eye…”
“Happy birthday, Draco,” he said in his heavily-accented voice
“Alone? Are you sure that’s wise?” Draco asked nervously. Never would they let people randomly walk around the reserve in Romania and certainly not at night. Patrik’s smile widened as he nodded.
“That was very reckless, another Gryffindor trait.” Came the voice from further away this time. “Good luck doing that again!” He heard the gate clang closed followed shortly after by the smell of smoke. “Don’t worry, Mr Potter. The fire won’t kill you; the smoke may make you feel a bit strange, though.” The sound of his laughter drifted away as Harry tried to lower his head, the smoke burning his nose and the back of his throat. Drugs, he thought as his head started to feel heavy and fuzzy. Even in the black of his vision, bright colours and shapes began to appear as his grasp on reality slipped. Even the screaming of his taut shoulders couldn’t bring back the hornets rendering any wandless magic useless. He was a captive within his mind as well as in the cell.
“We started out from a town called Cherokee in North Carolina and hiked through The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, ending at a place called Chimney tops. We didn’t see anything for the first few days. The hike would normally only take approximately ten hours. Still, we set up camp in several places along the way as we looked for evidence. It wasn’t until we got within a few miles of the Tennessee border that we started to see signs of them. The group leader believed a young female with a large litter was in the area due to droppings found and scratch marks in nearby trees. We following the trail they laid, but the female and her cubs remained allusive. We were there for about three months with almost no sign of the cats.” He paused, watching Rolf listen intently to his story, revelling in the innocent attention. “It wasn’t until I was trekking back to Cherokee with a few others that we stumbled upon a young male drinking at a stream. I managed to capture the image and draw it if you would care to see?”
“Sorry?” Draco questioned as he followed the man’s gaze.
“I’m sure it took almost Gryffindor levels of courage to come.” Hermione agreed. “It’s been years, though, Harry. Most of them are upstanding members of society now. I’m not sure what Malfoy and some of the others have been up to, but I heard that Zabini is some star Auror in Italy now.” Nodding with interest, he watched the pair leaning together against the far wall. Blaise said something, and the other Slytherin laughed in response.
Finally, the cold seeped from his bones, and a comforting wave of warm relief returned. His stomach still churned, but he thought that he was safe from being sick again. He gripped the work surface as he turned, his legs feeling like Gilderoy Lockhart had removed the bones. On a positive note, he thought, he could breathe again. So consumed with the need to be sick, his body had given up on his panic attack, focusing on the most pressing dilemma.
“Right by Gringotts. They do the best spicy baked eggs, and their antipasti platters are to die for.”
Movement from the doorway distracted them both. Weasley leant against the doorframe and nodded in encouragement. Draco gave him the once over and was surprised at the confidence which he exuded, so at odds with his younger self.
“I don’t normally,”
“As you wish, Just Malfoy, You can call me Just Weasel if it’ll make you feel better?” Weasley smirked, and Draco couldn’t help himself.
It wasn’t just the handshake; it was what the handshake represented; Acceptance and maybe forgiveness. He was sure that if Harry had taken his hand that first night at Hogwarts, then his life would have been ineffably different. His imagination painted pictures across his mind’s eyes of himself and the golden trio studying together in the library or wandering down to Hogsmeade to grab a butterbeer. Harry or Granger, holding his hand, and he told Dumbledore about the Death Eaters plans. If nothing else, maybe he could have saved his uncle. Maybe, just maybe, he wouldn’t have the unsightly scar on his forearm.
The world and the pain crept back in as he felt two hands on either side of his face, one tapping gently at the cheek. His head filled with pinpricks of white-hot pain, blinding and poking him. He cried out before he tried to curl in upon himself, hoping to escape the pain. Instead, he covered his head with his arms and gritted his teeth, grinding them against each other as he tried to shield himself from the agony.
