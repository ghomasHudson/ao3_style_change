“Sorry. It might be cold.” Harry dips his fingers into the potion and applies it to the bruise, trying to keep his touch as light as possible. Draco winces but doesn’t make a sound, clearly trying to keep his body still. His eyelashes flutter faintly, golden against his skin.
“You’re doing so good, pet, look at you.” Harry’s breath catches and he leans down to kiss my chest, slowly dragging his teeth over my nipple. I can barely even think between the praise and the feeling of his mouth hot on my skin. He teases my hole with three fingertips, and when  he raises his eyebrows I nod and reach out to cup his face in my hands.
Harry has moved closer in the time it’s taken for Draco’s brain to achieve higher functions beyond thinking about Harry’s curls and his biceps and his bright bright smile and his fucking huge hands and–
“I had another nightmare,” Harry whispers, and Draco slings his arm across Harry’s warm waist and sinks back into sleep.
Harry stands up abruptly, his eyes glued to the thin line of Draco’s mouth, the downturn of his gaze. “I’m gonna change the movie.”
“I want to get coffee with you, too,” Harry says softly. “You’re more than good enough for me, Draco. You have been for a long time.”
Unable to help it, Harry shivers; Malfoy says her first name like she’s handling it with kid gloves. Soft and round and gentle.
“Mhmm.” Hermione stops trying to hide her smile, white teeth bright against her skin. “What do you need help with, then?”
“I like when you beg,” he repeats, leaning down to nip at Draco’s shoulder. In retaliation Draco reaches down and strokes the length of Harry’s dick, basking in Harry's gasp as the magically-imbued sensitivity makes him feel the action as though Draco is touching
. No. I want…” Harry trails off as his fingers find Draco’s jawline, creeping up to gently trace the bow of Draco’s lips. “I want you all to myself.”
Draco jerks his head to the side. “The hexes, getting my stuff stolen, you know. I got physically beaten up once, which was new and exciting and felt rather like what we just did.”
Harry gathers Draco in his arms, squeezing him tight for a long moment before kissing Draco’s temple. “Alright. We’ll figure it out.”
He can’t answer, with his mouth around my cock doing things that make me see stars, but when I look down our eyes meet. His are glinting silver, heavy with want, and I don’t know how long I can last like this, when my cock is already aching from the friction of the strap-on and watching Draco fall apart underneath me.
I don’t know what I expected but that actually makes… a lot of sense. As disturbing as it is. I tighten my fingers around Harry’s shirt. “Can you turn the grav back on, then? If you want–”
“That’s the worst kind of dancing. You have to dance with your whole body,” I tell him, and push my foot against the edge of the couch, tumbling us both into open air. Draco gasps, his eyes scrunching closed, and I hold onto him tightly, hoping he feels safe under my hands.
“You wore a skirt that one time, I think you had borrowed Granger’s when something happened to your trousers? I don’t know, but it
In the weak light of the bedroom Draco cracks open his eyes, groaning a bit as he reaches for his wand and casts a sleep-rough Tempus. The numbers blink once, twice, 7:34, and he smushes his face into the pillow, rolling over onto Harry’s side of the bed before sitting up abruptly when his body meets no resistance.
,” Harry says, working Draco’s cock the way he knows they like it, a little too fast and a little too rough. Draco presses their eyes closed, then furrows their brow as they roll their shoulders, and even though Harry’s vision is whiting out around the edges he soothes a thumb over the hollow of Draco’s throat. “Are you uncomfortable? Do I–
“C’mere, love,” Harry says, reaching up to thread his fingers through Draco’s hair. They settle with their arse pressed flush to Harry’s hips, then lean forward. As Harry strokes their hair, pulling it up into a loose ponytail, Draco’s eyelids flutter closed and they exhale. Harry pulls the sparkly purple hair tie off his wrist and gently loops it around Draco’s hair, letting his hands fall to Draco’s shoulders. “There you go.”
“I already saw it,” Draco says, trying to keep frustration from coming through in his tone. “Please. I can’t– Harry. It hurts me to see you hurt.”
“This is your home too,” Harry continues, clenching his hands for a moment before relaxing. “This is your
Draco clicks his muggle biro, looking at Harry over the gold rim of his reading glasses. “Hey, yourself.”
“Ah. Are you going to be good?” Harry’s voice is light, but he pulls away to look Draco in the eyes, revealing the question for what it is: a way to ask what Draco wants tonight. “Do you want to do what I ask?”
“Hey,” Draco says softly, dragging his hands down from Harry’s curls to cradle the back of Harry’s neck. The heat between them settles into something gentler, a crackling hearth fire in place of a blazing house. “It’s okay, Harry.”
“Why?” Draco asks when Harry pulls back. Harry blinks, confused, so Draco elaborates. “Why were you holding–
The mountains take Harry’s breath away, jaggedly reaching for the sky. Draco keeps glancing across the car, but shakes his head with a small smile when Harry asks him if he wants to switch to the passenger seat.
By the time Draco comes, he’s blinking away tears. This doesn’t happen every time, but often enough that he knows how to hide it. Harry murmurs at him lazily, his cheek tacky against Draco’s shoulder, talking about his plans for the week and the kitten he adopted two weeks ago, like he’s trying to pull Draco into his life during these hazy moments of flimsy intimacy.
frustrated that you put yourself in danger, but I’m not frustrated about taking care of you.” Draco touches his own lips lightly, remembering the softness of Harry’s mouth. Harry glances down to Draco’s fingers, then up to Draco’s eyes.
,” I groan, pressing my hands over my eyes. This wasn’t part of the plan. The plan was to make the ten-day trip to Catchpole at an easy cruising speed and spend the holidays planet-bound with Ron and Hermione. The
, how much people love his work, and by the time people are meandering to the door Draco is half-convinced Harry is going to jump him right here in the middle of the gallery.
, for what you asked of him. You thought he would always come back, would always break through barriers for you.
“Looking for my Transfiguration book,” Draco snaps. The line of his back is hard under his pajamas, lit dimly by a soft-glowing Lumos hovering near the ceiling.
“Joshua, just…” Draco starts, holding his hands out into the suddenly tense air, placating, but Joshua shoves himself into Harry’s space with a pointed finger.
“Oh, do you want more than this?” Harry asks, teasing lilt back in his voice, and Draco rolls his eyes as he lets his hands travel down to Harry’s waist. Harry slides out and thrusts back in smoothly as Draco digs his fingers into soft skin, his gasp cracking neatly down the middle.
“You were so good, baby.” Another kiss, to Draco’s cheek this time. His head lolls a bit against Harry’s shoulder. “You
“The bond,” he says when they break apart. “I think it’s–” Before he can finish the thought Draco’s eyes go wide and he bolts out the passenger door, whooping under the wide blue sky as he stumbles through the grass alongside the road. He gets further and further from Harry, but there’s no pull on Harry’s wrist, no itching under his skin– only warmth in his chest. Draco’s uncharacteristically expressive joy is so bright, Harry can’t do anything but stand by the car and watch until Draco wheels around with his arms open wide. No longer a compulsion, but an invitation.
“A story?” Draco asks, pressing closer to Harry. She’s all silk and bare leg, and Harry can feel the slight swell of Draco’s breasts against her torso, but she resolutely ignores it, knowing that Draco is surely getting much more of that on her end and just politely not saying anything about it.
“Draco,” Harry whispers hoarsely, trying to remember anything but electricity in his veins. “Draco, Draco, did he–”
thrusting the dildo into Draco’s arse, even as he rolls his hips on Draco's cock. “Enjoying yourself?”
“Baby.” Harry’s hands are on Draco’s jaw as soon as they’re out of sight. He turns Draco’s face side to side, presumably looking for any hexes. “Did they do anything to you?”
“Do you get nightmares too?” Harry asks, staring into the fire instead of the cut of Malfoy’s cheekbones, but she’s aware of them. Harry’s always aware of Malfoy, in a way she’s given up fighting. “I get them, and then it’s too dark when I wake up.”
at him for what may be the first time this year. There are deep circles underneath his eyes, and his cheeks are hollow, painted with the red marks of Harry’s fingers. Draco is trembling, Harry realizes, fine tremors that shiver along his whole body.
“Gonna fuck you.” Harry’s skin is damp, sliding against Draco’s in a way that makes Draco writhe. Their scars are pressed together, the white arcs bisecting Draco’s torso rubbing across the curved pink-brown on Harry’s chest, terribly intimate. Draco wants simultaneously to hide and to kiss Harry so hard neither of them can think. He chooses the latter, burying his hands in Harry’s curls and wrapping his legs tightly around Harry’s waist. The fullness of Harry’s dick is maddening, sending a flush of heat through Draco’s body with every thrust.
“Okay.” Harry swallows, then wraps his arms around Draco’s neck gently, fearful of hurting him again. “I’m sorry. It’s too late to say it, but I am.” He tightens his hold just a bit; Draco’s breathing is loud in his ear. “I’ll leave you alone the rest of the year as well as I can, I just want– I need– this. Right now.”
“But you need to work on your jokes,” he says, softening his words with a wry smile. Draco cuffs him on the shoulder with a put-upon huff, yet when he kisses Harry it’s slow and deep– a promise.
The display is staticked out, so I can barely see the person who answers my distress comm. They’re just a flicker of dark curls and white shirt. Their voice—deep and rich—comes through loud and clear.
“People will just come because of my name,” Harry says, dropping his head down into his hands. Draco cranes his head around, and Harry startles into laughter when he blinks his eyes open and sees Draco’s convoluted position.
First first first. You need him. Or maybe you don’t, but no one else will listen to you, eyes sliding away from the riot of sentences exclamations explanations coughed up at their feet, but he always listened to you, held your words cupped in his hand like something fragile. You think you need him, the real him, the one that hides under painted layers of meekness, the one with sharp eyes and honey-sweet magic under his skin.
“I love when you’re all soft after sex,” Draco says. His fingers trail down Harry’s body, and it takes a moment for Harry to realize Draco is tracing the impressions left by the rope.
care about you. I could– I could fall for you if you gave me the chance.” Harry’s voice is rough. “I think I already am. Didn’t you feel it, in my magic? Hermione said she did.”
“Come here,” Harry murmurs, hooking a finger in the air. Draco steps forward without thinking, then stops. Harry tilts his head before smiling faintly. “I wasn’t asking.”
“Fuck you,” Harry snaps, because he’s not going to admit to wanting this. He pulls Draco’s pyjamas all the way down, where they pool on the floor. He shoves his hand down between Draco’s thighs, and Draco lets his legs fall open as he goes limp, held up almost solely by Harry’s hand under his chin. He looks… debauched. Desperate. His pyjama top is falling open, showing off a pale collarbone, and Harry gives into the urge to bite down on it right as his middle finger finds the furl of Draco’s hole. Draco keens, thrashing like he wants out from underneath Harry, and Harry wavers; he’s angry, and he wants to sink his teeth into every part of Draco, but not if Draco doesn’t actually want this.
“Have you ever known me to keep quiet when I don’t like something?” Draco asks wryly, and Harry laughs, tension easing out of his shoulders.
. When Draco has fully undone one length of rope, he stretches out Harry’s leg, rubbing hard circles into his muscles.
“Alright, love.” Draco sets the second length of rope to the side, then pets a hand down Harry’s shin.  “Stretch out your legs fully. Mhm, just like that.”
on Sundays,” Harry counters, and Draco narrows his eyes, staring at Harry. Harry blinks back, and eventually Draco exhales dramatically.
“Yes.” Draco is panting like he’s been working out, and I haven’t even touched his cock yet. “Please.”
,” Draco whimpers, turning his face to the side. Harry’s grip on his wrists tightens slightly and Draco bucks his hips up, gasping as Harry brushes over his prostate. “There, there, right there.” Harry keeps thrusting at that angle until Draco barely knows how to breathe; he struggles against Harry’s grip, panting
“Harry has an… unquantifiable amount of magic. Wild, deep magic. It gave him a lot of trouble right after the war, after killing– well, anyway, he went to a lot of magic specialists to deal with it and they hypothesized he’s using about ten percent of his magic when casting verbally with a wand.” Inhaling sharply, Draco turns to Harry as Hermione continues talking. “However, that continuous control helps him keep all that magic in check and avoid potentially dangerous accidental magic. But when he uses the extent of his power, it’s…” Hermione trails off and Harry casts his eyes down — shame burning in his cheeks — recalling the sound of every single one of Grimmauld Place’s windows shattering after an article about him and Ginny in the Prophet painted their amicable split as entirely her fault.
“That sounds good. Will we make it to Albuquerque by tonight?” Harry turns his eyes back to the road, keeping his hands steady on the steering wheel as the horizon shimmers with afternoon heat.
“In here!” Harry calls, peeking his head out of the kitchen just in time to see Draco throw himself face first into the couch. “You alright?” Draco makes a sound that might’ve been words if they weren’t said directly into the cushion, and waves a vague hand. “Well, I’m about to have the cheese toasties done. I also made a salad.” Heading back into the kitchen, Harry checks that everything is ready before plating the food.
“No– no.” Draco shakes himself, smiling tentatively at Harry. He sits down and tucks in, checking his watch. If he eats fast, he should be able to get to work on time, depending on if he can find his shoes, and his briefcase–
on the telly and a mug of tea in my hand, and you always hug me back even when I knock my elbows into your ribs, and–” Draco’s torrent of babbling is cut off as Harry presses his mouth to Draco’s, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist to pull him against Harry’s body. It’s all crashing down on Harry, the way he takes care of Draco, the way he
“Mhmm. I know you do.” Stroking a hand down Harry’s spine, Draco nudges him towards the bed, remembering to pull the covers back right before Harry tumbles face first onto his pillow. Smiling faintly, Draco tucks himself against Harry’s side and pulls the blanket over their shoulders. Harry’s face is already soft with sleep, his lips slightly parted and his glasses mashed into the pillow. Draco gently pulls them off Harry’s face, setting them down next to where he placed Harry’s wand on the bedside table. Pressing back against Harry’s side he kisses Harry’s forehead, then his nose, and Harry sighs softly in his sleep.
“I’ve been calling you Harry.” Malfoy’s fingers come up underneath Harry’s hair, ghosting along the nape of her neck.
Harry is glittering that night, smiling that bright smile that makes everyone fall over their feet for him. Draco remains quietly at his side the whole time, a close step behind, letting Harry talk about his work to the wealthy wixen who mill about. Their friends are in the crowd, getting wine drunk and being generally loud, but each of them comes up to Harry to congratulate him in turn. The general atmosphere is buzzing with appreciation, and when Harry starts to twitch his hands the way he does when he’s overwhelmed, Draco pulls him to the side and snaps his fingers under Harry’s nose until Harry’s darting gaze focuses on him.
“I know. I know. Hot and cold.” Harry kisses down Draco’s neck to his pulse point. “Have you thought about that? It’s a little bit symbolic, don’t you think?”
, Harry?” Draco inhales harshly as Harry tightens his hand around their neck briefly before dropping it down to Draco’s thigh. He fingers the thin fabric bunched there, but when he moves his hand towards the peeking head of Draco’s cock they jerk their head sharply to the side. A ripple of long silvery hair falls over their shoulder, distracting Harry from the shine of Draco’s precome.
“You’re funny,” Harry interrupts. “You’re so smart, I saw it that first week. You do your best to be kind to other people, even me, even when I drove you absolutely mad. You have such lovely hands,” Harry continues, brushing away Draco’s tears with his thumb. “I feel like I could watch you do anything and be absolutely content. I want to know what kind of movies you like. I want… I just want it all.”
Draco tsks, flipping their hair over their shoulder as it falls into their face. “You know just one won’t do it.”
“What?” Harry says, looming naked in the doorway above Draco. His hair is a mess, like he’s been running his hands through it, and he’s blinking hard behind his glasses. Draco struggles to breathe; he’s shaking harder than before, and he can’t figure out
Draco nods, still dazed, but when Harry disappears around the doorway panic spikes through Draco’s chest. He casts a half-hearted wandless cleaning spell, grimacing at the residue of his own come on his stomach. Despite the fact that his legs are frightfully wobbly he slides off the bed, grabbing his top. As he searches for his trousers, Harry comes back into the room with a flannel in his hand. When he sees Draco, he freezes.
“Harry,” he repeats. There’s a shuffling sound behind the door, but no response. “Come on. I– I don’t understand why you’re upset, but I would like to. I won’t come in there unless you ask me to, okay? I’ll just… be here.” Draco sinks to the floor, leaning back against the bathroom door. His body aches in a way that’s usually nice after sex, when Harry is there to hold him and press ticklish kisses down his arms, but in the chill air of the hallway it just makes him feel very alone.
Harry cuts off as Draco digs his hips further into the mattress and his mouth goes slack around Harry’s fingers. He cries out Harry’s name, his arse clenching almost painfully around Harry’s cock as he comes. Harry gives up all pretenses and thrusts fast and sloppy, panting
Draco flicks his gaze up Harry’s body, over dark jeans and an innocuous knit green sweater up to Harry’s messy curls, falling down around his ears. It’s Harry’s fierce expression, though, that takes Draco’s breath away. Harry glances across Draco’s bare chest, then wets his lips. He holds the belt  easily, and Draco bites down on his lip to keep from demanding that Harry bend him over immediately. He waits, holding himself still, until Harry gestures:
just to cut staffing corners, Harry. They don’t need you, they need properly trained wizards who will perform leyline repair safely.”
Draco cuts him a look but slides his fingers away from the waistband of his pants. “Why are you here if not for this?”
“He’s going to be alright,” Hermione replies softly. “Harry, you did it. He’s going to be alright. I need you to come with me now.”
Draco pushes his face into Harry’s neck and stays quiet for a long time. When he speaks, his voice is very small. “I just want someone to like me.”
,” he says, sounding more concerned than anything, and he kisses Draco hard. When Draco moves away, he struggles to catch his breath enough to speak.
Harry blinks, glancing over at Draco. For a moment his expression goes soft, then he turns back to the Ravenclaw. “If I see you again I’ll hex you.”
“Yes,” Draco replies breathlessly. “Okay. Yes. I thought– I’m not sure I’m quite good enough for you–”
“Hey,” Harry says one of these nights, turning on the couch to face Draco. “Are you going to Gay Brunch on Saturday? Pansy basically told me on threat of death to pull you away from work for it since you missed last month.”
“I don’t mind,” Harry says, trying to keep his voice from wavering. Everything he feels for Draco lies right underneath his skin, and he’s terrified. Of what, he doesn’t know.
“Where are you?” Draco mutters to himself as he pulls out his map, marking down a small dot at Harry’s current coordinates. Out in the middle of nowhere, then. Nothing new there.
“We should,” Draco says, stifling a yawn. Without looking over, Harry offers his hand palm-up over the center console.
all you want,” Pansy snaps her finger under Draco’s nose, and he startles, “you’re acting disgustingly smitten. It’s horrifying.”
“Good boy,” Draco says muzzily from where he’s loose-limbed across the sofa cushions. Harry climbs into his lap and comes with three pulls of Draco’s fingers.

When he opens his eyes again, Harry is looking at him, his big green eyes guileless. Draco is suddenly breathless at how beautiful he is– the curve of his dark brows, the lightning scar that arcs through his eye and down his cheek, the pink-brown softness of his lips.
“Hmm. Up.” Harry taps Draco’s hip until Draco moves off of him. They end up sitting on the floor facing each other, Harry’s back to the wall and Draco’s to the sink.
“Thank you,” he says politely, wiping his chin with the back of his hand, and I can't help it– I roll over until I’m half on top of his chest, kissing him like my life depends on it. From the back of his throat comes a surprised noise, but he melts into me, winding his fingers in my hair. When we break apart he’s grinning, even as I bite his chin playfully.
Draco’s boyfriend is beautiful, and clearly knows it; he’s turned his dimples and sparkling brown eyes on Harry no less than five times a minute since they sat down in the living room, Harry on the armchair and Draco next to Joshua on the blue tartan sofa. Harry has met Joshua before only in passing since Draco’s just been seeing him for a few weeks, and Harry’s already getting a bad feeling in his gut. There’s a movie playing, something with a lot of explosions that Joshua had wheedled Draco into putting on, even though Draco flinches every time there’s a loud sound. Joshua, sitting next to him, hasn’t noticed, choosing instead to give Harry a rundown of every article he’s ever written for The Prophet. Harry flicks his eyes over to Draco and watches him curl his fingers into the sleeves of his nicest knit jumper, and wonders why he’s been so quiet. Usually, Harry wouldn’t be able to get Draco to stop talking even if he tried.
“I’m terrified,” Draco says softly, pressing closer to Harry. “I don’t know how to be anything other than cruel when I’m terrified.”
“I– I.” Draco wants to roll away from Harry’s warmth, to tuck himself up into it and never leave; instead, he simply freezes. “What is this?”
He pushes aside his shirt as he undoes the line of buttons, ghosting a finger over his own nipple after asking permission. He bites back a soft moan, keeping his eyes on the ground as he slides his shirt off, nearly letting it fall to the ground before Harry’s sharp
,” Draco repeats, firmer this time, and Harry’s eyes glint as he leans closer to Draco on the sofa. “I’m not ticklish.”
“No,” Harry says, gently arranging Draco and sliding a pillow under his hips. “No, I took you home because you’re pretty.”
“Get my fingers wet,” Harry says, taking the hand currently buried in Draco’s hair and shoving them into Draco’s panting mouth. Draco immediately closes his lips and sucks on Harry’s fingers like he would a cock, and Harry’s thrusts turn frantic. “Oh
,” he whispers, and Draco raises his eyebrows, but before he can answer a well-dressed wizard pulls Harry’s attention away. For the rest of the night Draco keeps up a steady stream of murmured praise, reminding Harry how talented he is, how
“Do we wanna put something different on?” Harry asks, interrupting Joshua’s chatter as Draco flinches hard at a sound from the telly, meeting Harry’s eyes rather frantically. Joshua blinks at Harry, something tight flashing across his features.
.” Draco pulls at the cuffs a bit, trying to move his arms into a more comfortable position, and Harry lets him have a bit more leeway. “You– you– god, oh my
If Draco had the wherewithal to glare, he would. But as Harry bites down on Draco’s nipple through his mesh crop top then twists his finger in Draco almost viciously, all Draco manages is an unbecoming whine. Harry is still half dressed, his black shirt unbuttoned to reveal a toned, scarred chest and thin gold chain around his neck. His belt buckle is undone but his trousers are still on, much more than can be said for Draco’s, which had been tossed to the floor almost immediately.
” Draco shouts as the bed shifts violently. Before he even has a second to brace himself Harry sinks down onto his cock, warm and wet. The slick tip of Harry’s cock brushes against Draco’s skin, and Draco has the wild urge to taste him, to lick every bit of Harry’s arousal down his throat. “Christ, Harry, how are you so wet– fuck– fucking
. It feels so good. Harry shifts in Draco’s arms, getting comfortable, his skin warm and a bit sweaty where it presses against Draco’s. The blanket rustles as Harry presses his lips into the crook of Draco’s neck, softly, again and again.
“Green,” Draco replies. His pulse is quick in his throat, from arousal rather than anxiety, and he can’t look away from Harry’s blazing expression. “Fuck me, Harry.”
“Harry, you’re kind of freaking me out,” Draco can’t help but confess; Harry’s nervous energy is tightening the knot of anxiety that resides in Draco’s chest. Harry grimaces slightly then stands, offering a hand down to Draco, who takes it and let's Harry pull him to his feet.
“I’ve got you.” Harry curls his arms around Draco, pulling him even closer. “You’re alright. Shh, darling, darling.”
Harry sighs, and sits down on the other end of the sofa, leaving space between them; she isn’t sure what Malfoy is okay with, in this strange new lack of contention.
on Draco’s cock with Draco’s fingers still wrapped around his wrist, guiding him roughly. Harry twists his hand viciously around the head, and even with the mess of precome there he can tell it’s too dry, and Draco yells, a strangled sound that stops abruptly when he throws his head back.
are threaded through my vocabulary, applied to anyone and everyone, including Draco. But it feels different now, weightier, and when I can see Draco’s face again he’s flushed red, looking away from me. I
“Maybe I’ll have you sit here all night,” Harry says. “Just sit here while I get myself off to your pretty mouth, wrapped around that gag like it’s my cock.” Harry moves his thumb to Draco’s bottom lip, tracing the wet line of it. He shifts closer to Draco, nosing along the line of Draco’s shoulder, barely a breath away from kissing his bare skin. There’s nothing from Draco but a sharp inhale through his nose, even as Harry
“Malfoy,” Harry says, his mouth pressed to Draco’s collarbone, and Draco must hear the hesitance there because he grabs Harry’s wand from the top of the dresser and does a spell that immediately makes his hole wet and loose against Harry’s fingers. Harry doesn’t even have time to freak out about the intimacy of Draco using his wand before Draco swallows hard and coughs under Harry’s hand.
the chance to get you off. To show you how good I can be.” Harry’s casual demeanor melts away as he hums in pleasure and tilts his head, baring his neck for my kisses.
“I dreamt of you every night, since the day you told me. I couldn’t… I don’t know what it is about you, Draco, but I just…” Harry runs both of his hands through his hair in agitation. “Will it take you a while to fully recover?”
is good enough for Draco, in Harry’s opinion. The man cries over animal movies and knits socks and launches himself at Harry for a hug when he gets excited about something, and Harry is skeptical that anyone knows how to be gentle with Draco in the way he needs.
.” Draco is losing his handle on words as I stroke him lazily, dragging his pleasure out. As I move my hand away from him he whines, fisting a hand into my hair and tugging sharply. “Don’t
“Anything,” Draco gasps, because Harry’s slick fingers are pressing against his rim now, almost pushing in but not quite. “Anything, anything, just fucking
“Yeah, alright,” Harry says, finally blinking his eyes open, his long lashes sticking together in the corners. As he sits up Draco walks back into the bedroom, grabbing the oversized red jumper that Harry loves. Harry ambles in through the doorway, stumbling a bit and heading straight for the bed.
. Draco buries a hand into Harry’s curls, pulling away with a gasp. He fucked up, he knows this– he shouldn’t kiss coworkers that he’s bonded to in the middle of the night, even if said coworker smells like heaven and apologizes for things that aren't his fault– but he couldn’t stop himself, not after three days of Harry, nonstop and impossibly lovely.
people,” Draco continues. He tilts his head back, showing off the bob of his Adam’s apple as he swallows. “Little golden boy, with his dirty secret. Only wants to fuck damaged goods.”
The first time it happens, Draco had just brewed himself the perfect cup of tea and settled down in his favorite armchair to read, sighing softly at the persistent ache in his feet. He’s twenty-five, not
I shake my head a bit. I don’t know this man at all. I am the runaway heir to my family’s throne. I have bigger priorities than having Potter’s surprisingly large hands on me and around me and holding me down and–
“What do you think?” Draco snaps, his voice muffled where his face is pressed into the sheets. “It’s–
“I do want this,” Draco says, though he glances nervously at Harry through his lashes. “But if you think it’s too much– if I’m too much, we don’t have to–”
“Merlin help me,” Draco mutters. “Okay, then why didn’t you go to Hermione, who is certainly better equipped to welcome you to her home at nine in the evening, seeing as she is actually your
“There you go, there you go pet, you can take all of me, just like that. Just like that.” Harry keeps murmuring encouragement as he slides in torturously slow, never taking his eyes off mine. I try to hold his gaze but can’t help arching back into the bed and squeezing my eyes tight once he bottoms out, filling me completely. Scrabbling for purchase on his body, my hands end up wrapped around the harness where it presses into his hips, so I tug him impossibly closer, holding him against me.
. Those green eyes had been bright all the way up until the moment that Draco had pulled on his jumper and departed, leaving decisive words of
“You’re fucking starlight, baby,” I say as I stroke up Draco’s cock. I twist my hand around the head and his nails dig into my skin. “You’re so gorgeous, with your hair and your legs and that
“Maybe it’s the possibility of love, I’m not sure. But whatever it was you burned the curse right out of his veins. There isn’t a trace of it left. What were you thinking about, when you let go?”
“Draco.” Harry sounds terribly uncertain, and one of his hands comes up to cradle Draco’s cheek. “I get nightmares, too. It’s okay.”
“Okay,” Draco whispers, turning his face to the side as he feels his cheeks flush. He never gets used to it, the way Harry easily takes charge only to go soft like this during sex; he’s not afraid to compliment Draco outside of the bed, not at all, but it feels different when Draco is naked and splayed out underneath him.
“Oh, darling. We don’t have much longer. And…” Draco trails off as an idea hits. “And I know you can be
“Dance with me,” Harry says again, even though they’re already dancing in their pajamas with their hands clasped together tightly. Draco blows a wisp of hair off his face before pressing a kiss to Harry’s temple.
“Oh, fuck off,” Draco says, closing his eyes. He can feel Harry’s smile, bright against the crown of his head.
“That contestant’s answer was complete bollocks,” Draco says, forcibly looking at the telly. He can still feel Harry’s eyes on him, but eventually Harry sighs.
They never kiss, not on the mouth, not after the first time Harry tried and Draco pushed him away gently with something unreadable in his eyes. Now everything feels new, even the familiar sensation of Draco’s body wrapped around Harry, the pleasure sparking underneath Harry’s skin. For a moment Draco is stiff, unsure, but then he opens his mouth to Harry’s and kisses him
“I didn’t realize how grand of a gesture it was going to be,” Harry mutters, a bit sheepishly. “I got everything ready and set it up, but when it came time to show you I realized I had basically just bared my heart to you. But it was worth it, for you to have a place where you feel at home.”
“Baby,” Harry says, glancing over at his husband. Draco sighs, but doesn’t pull his eyes away from the spreadsheets scattered across the coffee table. His long fingers are buried in his hair, and when he drops his hands to the tabletop the blonde strands stick up, making him look like a very ruffled bird.
“Know what else we do with our bodies?” Draco asks. Harry moves closer in anticipation, and Draco’s lips quirk up. “This!” he yells, shuffling his feet again as he launches himself toward Harry, and Harry goes down with a yelp as he gets shocked by Draco’s mouth on his own. They hit the floor in a tangle of limbs, Draco giggling madly. “It works with kissing,” Draco exclaims in delight.
“Please just…” Harry starts, but instead of finishing his sentence he just sighs and opens Draco’s door before stepping back. Draco turns towards him to ask what the hell is going on, but he catches a glimpse of soft light through the doorway and–
There’s a crack of Appraition and Draco is tossed bodily onto their bed, gasping as he lands and realizes his husband just wandlessly Apparated them while
He shifts in his seat, trying desperately to listen to whatever Wizengamot member he’s speaking to. Draco offers to attend these events because he knows how anxious they make Harry, and he’d do nearly
“Rude.” Draco flexes his wrists, then snuggles into Harry’s side when he stretches out next to Draco again. “Was it good for you?”
Draco inhales deeply, trying to swallow down the sob that threatens to crawl up his throat, willing his body to ease down from the disappointment of
“Yeah,” I say incredulously, letting myself marvel at this man beside me, warm and real and wonderful. “We’ve got the whole universe.”
“No penetration,” Harry replies, staring down at me as though he’s considering whether I’m real or not. “But touching anywhere is fine.” His legs are already above my arms, so I reach up and press my palms flat against his thighs, urging him closer to my mouth. He’s everywhere, my whole vision blurring with his proximity and his heat and the musky smell of sex, and then his cock is right above my mouth, slick smearing across my chin. The moment I realize he’s holding himself up with his thigh muscles alone, my cock makes a valiant effort to get hard again, heat pooling in my stomach, but this is about Harry, now. This is about me being good for Harry.
There is ice moving through his veins, and Draco doubles over with a gasp, wrapping his arms around himself as his body is wracked with shivers. He hears Harry make a pained sound over the rushing in his ears, then there’s hands gripping the back of his neck and he can breathe again. Warmth seeps through his skin from each of Harry’s fingertips, and he exhales shakily.
Draco doesn’t even try to hide his overly dramatic gasp as he and Pansy point to each other. She snickers then looks around the room, her eyes going wide and falsely innocent. “It seems most people think it’s me. Or,” she says, drawing out the word as she leans back into Ginny’s lap. “Ginevra here.”
With a snap of his wand, Draco presses the white sheets to his bed– fresh linen, crisp at the corners.
,” Harry declares, and Draco falls into surprised giggles. With a snort Harry steps away, smoothing his hands down Draco’s sides. “C’mon, we gotta get to class.”
“There, darling,” Harry says once they’re situated. Draco blinks against the dim light, soaking in the sight of Harry, sweaty and nearly glowing. His curls are a wreck, fluffy around his ears. “Colour now?”
“I wanted to hurt you,” Harry murmurs, and the truth of the words cut deep. “Fuck, I wanted to hurt you so bad, but this doesn’t feel…” He trails off, unsure what’s even happening in his chest.
“I don’t wanna suck you off,” Harry says, reaching up for the waistband of Draco’s joggers. He’s wearing a red jumper of Harry’s that hangs loose on his slim frame, and Harry’s fingers creep under the hem. “Well, I mean, I kind of always want to suck you off. But not right now. Let me…” He tilts his head. They don’t really talk about this, they just
Harry stretches his toes out, shivering a little at the sweet ache underneath his skin. The rope around his wrist pulls slightly, keeping his arms above his head. Draco’s hands never stray from him, tracing out random patterns through Harry’s leg hair. For a moment, Harry feels rather enraptured with this. How lucky he must be, to have Draco stay with him.
“Of course.” Harry’s free hand is planted on the bed, and I take a hand off the harness to trace the shifting muscles in his arm. He grins at me, crooked and joyful, and I can’t help but return it. I shift my hips and exhale, tugging at the harness again.
he’s hidden his feelings during this– this fling. He knows, because he’s hidden them so well he’s nearly fooled himself.
“Here,” Harry says, intercepting Draco before he walks out the front door and pressing a thermos into his hands. “It’s tea, because I’m not sure how you take your coffee.”
Harry inhales shakily and steps backwards slightly. His eyes are fixed somewhere beyond Draco’s left ear, unsettling in their unfamiliar blankness. “I– yes. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have– yeah. Yeah. I’m just going to…” He steps backwards, feeling for the stair with his toe. “I’ll go.”
. All he does is sleep there. But looking around at the rest of their flat, Draco can see why Harry might be confused; he clearly makes an effort to make his space homey. Most of the furniture from Draco’s old flat didn’t come with him, because he didn’t care much either way, so Harry’s touch is everywhere, from the warm yellow walls to the antique coffee table and the countless frames holding pictures of family and friends. Draco focuses on a picture of himself, Harry, and Luna, sprawled out on a picnic blanket and sticking bunny ears behind each other's heads.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. Never fully comfortable with silence– another fact that Draco has learned, spending all this time with Harry. “Feelings aren’t always evenly matched. I know that. So I understand.”
“What do you need, love?” Harry asks, his eyes glinting in a way that means whatever Draco asks for will happen at Harry’s pace, no matter how much Draco begs. Draco shifts his hips again, watching Harry’s eyelashes flutter as the tip of his cock drags against Draco’s skin.
“I can do both.” The bruise on Draco’s face is fading with the potion, and Harry rubs a gentle thumb under it until Draco moves to stand up. “Come along,” he says, offering a hand down to Harry, a soft and genuine smile on his face. “I think I would like you to hold me.”
Draco hums noncommittally. Harry is worth any sharp words, any painful hexes. Always. But the backlash that Harry gets isn’t fair, if he would just forget about Draco he would be–
“Took too much over the summer,” Harry replies, staring up at the ceiling. “I don’t have to come into your bed if it bothers you.”
“Don’t care,” Harry grunts, sliding his fingers out of Draco to unbutton his jeans, not bothering to take them off as he pulls his aching cock out, giving himself a long stroke. Draco’s hair is still wrapped around his fingers but he loosens his grip just a bit. “Color?”
“Do you want to know what she meant by that?” Harry’s fingers slide away from Draco’s, and his meaning clicks. They shouldn’t– they definitely shouldn’t– but neither of them can resist pushing boundaries when it comes to their curiosity. Another reason they make a good team.
“Harry,” Draco snaps, and Harry startles, looking towards Draco’s face. Their mouth is twisted up, but as they gaze at Harry their face softens. “Oh, darling, you want me so badly, I know. I promise I’ll fuck you, but what do you say first?”
“Fucking fuck!” I yelp, startled as the scalding liquid splashes over my trousers, somehow missing my bare hands. “Hedwig, this is Arduian coffee, you know this shit is expensive. What’s up?”
“Hello,” Draco says, trying his best to wave in a sexy manner before realizing it’s hard to wave sexily when you have soot on your hands. “Uhm. Yes. Hello.”
“Good boy.” Harry reaches out to hold Draco’s hips, then his waist. “Turn around for me.” Draco does, keeping still as the belt in Harry’s hands jangles and warm leather is wrapped around Draco’s wrists. Harry softly murmurs to him the whole time, telling him this is just to keep his wrists together and not to pull, because it will chafe, and he knows that Draco can be good for him. He turns Draco back around with a gentle push to his hips. “Kneel. There you go, pet. Good. You look so pretty like this.”
“Baby, baby,” Harry pants, and then his body is heavy on mine, pressing us together, my cock trapped underneath his stomach. I let my legs go and wrap them around his waist instead, my heels digging into his arse to hold him tight to me. Heat blossoms under my skin as he presses hard kisses along the line of my neck and collarbone. “Fuck, you’re so loud,
, but Harry’s too quick. He’s got his hand around Draco’s throat in an instant, holding right underneath his jaw so there’s no actual pressure yet.
Whatever Draco might have said to that is lost to the depths of his mind as Harry settles on top of him and slides in, maddeningly slow. Draco shudders, trying to keep himself loose and open, but he flinches in surprise when Harry’s hand cups his jaw.
,” Draco spits, his chest heaving. Their faces are close enough that Draco’s pale, furious features blur in Harry’s vision. Harry has never laid his hands on Draco, not like this, and is momentarily shocked at how
“Draco...“ Harry says, clearly swayed by the sheer pleading in Draco’s voice. “I have to– I need to fix–”
Draco removes his trousers as slowly as he dares, keeping his eyes on Harry the whole time. Harry’s expression is sharp and tender all at once, and he tracks Draco’s hands as Draco slides off his shoes, then neatly folds his trousers and his pants and sets them on the side table. He doesn’t dare touch himself, even accidentally; right now he is entirely Harry’s, and he doesn't have permission.
When Draco falls into Harry’s bed without a second thought, tucking the covers around himself as Harry brushes his teeth in the bathroom, he wonders what they are. What this is. But then Harry’s there, tucking his face into Draco’s neck, and it almost doesn’t matter anymore.
Morning sun spills through the bent window shades, gold across Draco’s sleeping face. Harry gazes at him, then looks away, then back again. The curve of Draco’s eyelashes seems unreal, something out of a fairy tale.
“Comfort movie or something new?” Harry squeezes Draco’s hands back, thinking about how he should’ve known he liked Draco by the fact that he can list all of Draco’s comfort movies without a second thought. “I just got
Something I could wrap my hand around, if I wanted to. Something I could use to pull him on top of me.
” Draco yells, whacking Harry’s shoulder in excitement. Harry stops trying to fight his grin and Draco scrambles to wrap Harry in a hug, undeterred even when he painfully catches Harry’s elbow in his ribs. “Fuck, you got Spell Damage?”
Draco grins, making his whole countenance brighter, and my heart trips a little bit. “You decide. Now what’s grav?”
“Oh god,” Draco moans as Harry licks a stripe up the underside of his cock. They’re sprawled across Draco’s couch, too needy to even make it to the bedroom. “Do that again.”
Harry’s eyes are impossible to look at, but even more impossible to break away from. “What are you afraid of, Draco?”
“Nope,” I say brightly. “If you’re on my ship, you’re helping. Also, you’re a stranger, and as much as I want to trust you, I don’t at all, so. Cockpit or you’re out of here.”
The next night Harry stays in his own bed, a dark lump that Draco stares at stubbornly until he gives up with a hefty sigh.
“One nod to come on your face, two nods for your back. Shake your head if you need something else.” Draco nods just once, and Harry presses a soft kiss down to Draco’s forehead. Despite their dynamic when they play, he’s never cruel; he doesn’t want to be. He’s allowed to be gentle with his things.
Harry casts a silencing charm and yells into his hands until Draco grabs his wrists, tugging him toward the desk, dragging Harry back to almost-happiness over the takeout.
“I don’t think you know what dancing really is,” he murmurs, voice soft and his eyes wide. “You can’t do the proper steps if your feet aren’t on the floor.”
Draco murmurs something unintelligible in response, and soon Harry has them both clean and in pajamas, tucked under the covers. Draco isn’t shivering anymore, but he still burrows into Harry’s arms as though he belongs there. And he does, Harry thinks as he tumbles into the velvet of sleep. Draco does belong here, in Harry’s arms. Safe.
“Are you sure you don’t want to fuck?” Harry asks, because he knows Draco, and Draco just laughs before rolling back and pulling Harry above him. His enthusiastic response is lost in Harry’s mouth, in the slide of their skin, in the rippling heat of Harry pushing in slow with his hands wrapped around Draco’s wrists. Draco comes first with a whimper, panting Harry’s name until Harry also shudders and stills, holding Draco tight to his chest. After a moment Draco casts a cleaning charm and they slip under the covers, facing each other, holding hands tightly as though this is a different life, one where they don’t have a war behind them.
“Hedwig,” I bite out, “get us back up to half-warp, and on course to Catchpole.” This is not a quadrant where ships stop, not unless they want to be quickly and easily cleaned out by pirates. I’d rather avoid that today.
, Harry is unfairly attractive when he does wandless magic like it’s nothing. Harry’s jeans rasp against Draco’s skin and Draco pushes his hips up until Harry shoots him a warning look. “Stay still.”
s that eventually break off into gasps. Now, though, something too big to name prompts him to keep talking.
breaking up with you,” Draco says fiercely, and Harry sinks fully to the carpet in relief. Matching his movement, Draco crosses his long legs, still holding Harry’s face almost painfully. “I was going to ask if you wanted to move in together, but I should’ve had a single intelligent thought about opening that conversation like… that.
“I don’t have time for your moral quandary.” Draco moves until Harry’s hand falls away, wincing as he shifts on the ground. “Just tell yourself I deserved it, and you got it out of your system, or whatever. I need to go to sleep–”
, Harry had said during their scene negotiation, and meant it. Something about the sting grounds him. “I know you want me to touch you, shhh.”
shut up, call me pretty names or whatever just fuck–” Harry thrusts hard, and Draco chokes on air, “–
After Harry leaves, Draco strips the bed immediately, not letting himself linger in the scent of sex and Harry and his own wistful dreams. He’ll wash the sheets, the way he always does, spreading them back out with a scent so clean he can almost forget what he will never truly have.
“Don’t do the self righteous hero thing right now, please.” Draco’s tone is easy, but wavers on the last word. “I just don’t want to think about it.”
“You’re boring, is what you are. Unfortunately, no longer having access to generational wealth means that I do have to continue to pay rent before I shuffle off this mortal coil, so.”
“Oh,” Harry says softly, then tucks his nose into Draco’s armpit like he’s trying to hide. He talks haltingly about the art class he took at his therapist's recommendation, the way he learned magical painting techniques through books, the way it brings him calm. Harry’s so direct, so bold during sex that seeing this side of him– soft and modest, but clearly in love with painting– is strangely rewarding. Sated and warm, Draco listens to the rise and fall of Harry’s voice until he trails off. Something about the moment feels
Harry doesn’t drop it. He just stands, open mouthed, until Draco is close enough to see his individual wind-tossed curls, and then Harry throws up a hand as though on instinct. Draco slams into an invisible wall that gives slightly under his weight, then pushes him back.
“No,” Harry says softly. Malfoy’s wearing a full-length nightgown with soft lace at the sleeves and high neck, and she looks beautiful. She looks like a ghost.
“I want to be tied down and also spanked across your knees,” Draco says, barely catching himself from falling forward as the door is wrenched open.
It starts with a small potted rosemary plant that Draco brings home and presents to Harry, his cheeks bright red the entire time. “You mentioned you want to have a garden,” he says, his words tripping over each other. “I know we don’t have room for– for a whole garden, but we have a windowsill in the kitchen, and it’s pretty spacious, and I just thought–”
. I unfold my body gingerly, wincing as Harry’s dick slides out. He presses a kiss to my shoulder before slipping off the bed and I watch him go, still dazed. The harness straps cup his arse beautifully and I stare until he’s out of sight. After a few moments he comes back in, holding a cup of water and a flannel that he uses to wipe my stomach, then his own. His dick flops between his legs and I snort, wrapping my hand around it to pull him towards me.
“Touch yourself,” Harry says firmly, and Draco shudders, clumsily snaking a hand between his stomach and the mattress. “There’s a good boy.”
, what about my mouth?” Draco pants, his beautiful legs falling open in an invitation, and I thrust my hips shallowly, angling my dick downwards so it slides against Draco’s balls and perineum. He shouts, actually
“I’m– I’m.” Harry swallows, looking over Draco’s shoulder. “Everyone is saying nice things about my art?”
Draco tilts his head in pleasure. When they first started exploring this, Harry had struggled a bit,  too harsh and too exacting, until Draco told him
“What,” Harry says blankly, right after opening the book just to slam it closed in panic. Harry’s tie– sometimes Draco’s, too– had been all they messed around with at Hogwarts, a constant as they started calling each other
“You are.” There’s blossoming bruises along Draco’s ribs, shaped like Harry’s fingertips, and Harry presses down on them until Draco’s breath hitches. “You are
“Why?” Harry asks before he can think about it. Draco shrugs, then shimmies his pyjama pants up to his hips as best he can. There are bruises on his waist that Harry doesn’t remember leaving.
“I haven’t been alright,” he whispers, eyes darting everywhere but your face. “I missed you I tried to be what I was supposed to be I tried to do what you asked I don’t think it worked–”
know, Harry, because you keep coming here when you should be at St. Mungo’s getting professional help from a whole team of Healers! Or better yet, you could stop doing whatever it is you’re doing that is causing this to happen in the first place!”
“We’re not bigger than ourselves.” Harry presses his amused grin to Draco’s hair. “We’re just two people in love.”
It’s too much. Draco has to turn away now, internally admonishing himself for acting on impulse. It’s good, what they have. It’s good. He shouldn’t ask for more.
“No,” Harry replies, staring into Draco’s eyes as he grabs Draco’s wrist, guiding his hand down to the edge of his red jumper. “No, I’m not cold.”
“Are we going to stop pretending? They saw us at the gala, took photos, everything you wanted. And it’s been six months, now.”
Draco shrugs. “You don’t have to explain it. As long as it feels good for you, and we’re both okay with it, then that’s our business.”
“Uh.” Harry licks his lips, and Draco helps him into a sitting position against the arm of the couch before pressing the glass of water to Harry’s lips. Harry drinks it down in four big gulps, coughing a bit afterwards. “Oh, that’s better. Arms are cold? I guess that’s the potion. And it doesn’t really hurt anymore, I think.”
“You want me to get you off, angel?” Harry’s voice is low and warm, like they’re both in on a joke. It makes Draco feel strangely safe for a moment, until Harry crooks his finger and all Draco knows is white-hot pleasure. “You wanna come?”

After Draco has been thoroughly taken apart by Harry’s fingers and cock, after he nearly burned from the inside out at the things Harry said to him, after they’ve arranged themselves tangled in Harry’s sheets, he asks.
“You’re alright.” Harry holds himself still, waiting for Draco to adjust. This isn’t new either, the gentle murmurs, the soothing tone. Like Harry is apologizing with every word. “You’re alright.”
“I know, baby. You’ve been so patient. You’ve done good.” Draco squirms at the praise as Harry walks back around the bed and settles on the mattress. He murmurs something low and a length of black silk appears in his hand. With a rush of anticipation Draco realizes what it’s for, and he lets Harry cradle his head gently as he ties the silk over Draco’s eyes, double checking that it isn’t too tight. “Colour?” he asks right in Draco’s ear, sending a shiver skittering down Draco’s spine.
“Thank you,” Harry interrupts, mostly because Draco looks like he might pass out. The day after that is a basil plant, and then cilantro, and then oregano, at which point Harry gently suggests there may not be much room left in the kitchen windowsill. Draco waves his hands and abruptly changes the subject to what show they should watch after dinner. He’s rarely ever so flustered unless he’s nervous about something, but Harry figures this is just an extended thank you for the room. It’s crisp apples the next day, ten of them, picked up from a farmer’s market during Draco’s break at work, and he primly informs Harry he will be making a pie.
“You said I could. You said, ‘my clothes are your clothes, you fancy git’, when my robes kept catching on things.”
“I work out,” I manage to say, my breath stuttering as he trails his fingers further back, then continues to circle the head of my cock with now-slick fingers. “Don’t know what to say about my cock, though. That’s just how it is.”
“Alright,” Draco breathes, but Harry’s lips are still a surprise– a revelation. The kiss is soft and rather tentative, different from Draco’s panic-induced intensity before, but it’s better, somehow. It’s better with Harry’s palms resting in the back of Draco’s neck, with the blanket around them and warmth in the press of their chests.
“You’re so gorgeous,” Harry murmurs, his voice dripping with arousal. “So fucking good for me. You want my dick? You wanna be fucked, baby?” I open my eyes and he’s there above me, holding himself up on one forearm and slicking his free hand over his dick. “Do you think you’re ready?”
“Are you still going out with that witch from the International Travel department on Friday?” she asks.
“Sit,” he says, turning his face up to mine, and I drop to the bed immediately. At his gentle insistence I move backwards and rotate until my head is on his pillow, the sheets at my back. He straddles my hips and I try to remember how to breathe, because
, he’s gorgeous. Pale skin for days, the tip of his hard cock and the flush on his cheekbones a matching pink tint. He has wispy blonde curls nestled around the base of his cock and I ghost a fingertip through them, listening to his breath quicken. I trail my hand back up his body and cup his face, leaning down until our lips are a breath away from each other.
“Pansy,” Neville says, blinking rapidly as though it will clear his mind of whatever mental images that gave him. “I don’t want to know who’s into that.”
yellow car. “He needs someone who won’t treat him like glass, someone who won’t go running to the Prophet with information the minute he acts any way other than what people expect of him. Harry needs someone who isn’t afraid to key his exes car when he
“I Apparated to the first place I could think of.” Draco’s eyes are still closed, and his face is smooth, expressionless. “You make me feel safe.”
Six months, the Healer had said. Once a week for six months and then they could reevaluate, if they couldn’t break the curse first.
“You cut your hair.” Draco’s voice is neutral– flat. Exactly what he wants to sound like. But Harry makes a sound low in his throat, and Draco’s stomach clenches tightly.
Harry’s expression goes soft and he presses a kiss to Draco’s cheek. Automatically Draco brings his hands down to grab Harry’s curls, wanting to keep Harry close, and in a split second he’s splayed out, his wrists tied to opposite ends of the headboard. “Harry,” he gasps, but Harry just smirks.
Anyone’s features could hide yours allow you to slip slick through the streets when they want you alive but probably secretly not-so secretly dead. But you need him to remember that you know him well enough to slide into his skin, comfortable.
“How was your day at work?” Harry asks, then snorts as Draco immediately throws his head back and groans. “That bad?”
Harry opens his mouth to ask something, but all that comes out is a soft puff of air, and then he’s forgotten the question. Everything in his mind feels warm and slow. Sated.
Somehow, Harry manages to press a thermos of coffee and Draco’s briefcase into his hands every morning, even though Draco himself rarely remembers where he leaves things scattered across the flat. Evenings are comfortable, especially once they start watching trivia shows after dinner. Draco would be great at them if he knew anything about Muggles, and Harry yells his completely incorrect answers in a very confident manner. Sometimes, on these evenings, Draco can take a deep breath and forget politics, the Ministry, and whatever bullshit article he’s working on at his job. He can just exist, laughing harder when Harry’s hand pushes him off the couch after he makes a terrible joke.
“If I recall that night correctly, I mean. Which, seeing as I finally thought I had a chance at something
“That’s when I knew that we could make this weird situation work. I still wish it didn’t take away… full consent, I suppose. But I think we’re making it work.” Harry lets himself lean in towards Draco a bit, trying to swallow down the way his heart is pounding. He never talks this much before sex– Draco made it clear once they could be apart that he wanted to keep it rather impersonal, and Harry would give Draco anything at this point.
“For the strap, my dick,” I say, bringing my hand lower, lower down his stomach. “For myself, cock.”
“No, darling,” Harry says simply, and murmurs something that immediately makes it feel like there’s a band tight around the base of Draco’s cock. He yelps, trying to get away from the sensation, but he’s pinned by the cuffs and Harry fucking himself on Draco’s cock. In a disorienting moment Harry pushes the dildo deep into Draco and holds it there, stopping the thrust of his hips as well. “You’re going to tell me exactly what it was like to sit at a fancy gala with a plug up your arse. And
“What is this?” you ask. You should be scared. You’re flat. Your voice is flat, unused to speaking what you truly want to say.
“Get out of me,” he says tetchily, poking Harry in the shoulder. Harry just grunts, burrowing his face further into the crook of Draco’s neck until Draco pokes him hard. “Harry.”
be me’.” Draco huffs, somewhere between a breath and a laugh. “It startled me so much and I couldn’t stop laughing, you remember?”
“Maybe,” he replies, and I look over in time to catch a soft smile on his face, incongruous with the brightly confident grins he’s been throwing my way since we met. “Do you want to borrow some pajamas?”
“Speaking of which…” Harry says, a thread of uncertainty in his voice, and Draco turns towards him again, startled to find Harry wringing his hands like he was when Draco first came into the flat. Immediately, he’s worried; Harry never seems outwardly nervous, not like this.
, Harry thinks. His thoughts are solidifying quicker now, flashes of Draco’s pliant mouth around his cock, of long blonde hair brushing across his shoulder, of his own voice saying
“Hmm.” Draco’s smile widens, turning playful. “You may need to prove it to me.” Laughing, Harry leans forward, playfully brushing his lips against Draco’s before grabbing Draco’s waist and pulling him away from the counter, clicking the wireless on as he goes. Draco blinks for a moment, baffled, but then catches on as Harry shimmies, rolling his shoulders to the upbeat song.
, and I don’t want him to think I am. I’m just much better at navigating politics and abstract mathematics than keeping myself alive in space. Harry picks up a booted foot and rests it on the edge of the console in front of him, his trousers pulling tight around his solid thighs. He keeps his eyes on me as he answers.
for Harry, and he adores it. Draco blinks, then smirks faintly as they lean against Harry’s palms, putting their weight into Harry. “Hold me up.”
“Effects?” he asks, his voice smaller than he means it to be, and then he feels Harry’s shoulder press against his. It’s warm and familiar, like breaks spent in cozy coffee shops and grudging pub nights once they stopped screaming at each other, and Draco relaxes minutely. “What are the effects?”
, with his tousled hair and crooked smile and strange, inexplicable injuries that he shrugs off. He won’t tell anyone what his job is, and though Draco would never say it, he’s burning up with curiosity.
“If I don’t have your cock in my mouth in the next thirty seconds–” I start, and Harry starts laughing, his eyes crinkling shut.
“Please let me kiss you.” Harry’s voice is low and wrecked and Draco can’t stop trembling. It’s always been real for him. Always. Yet the possibility of
He immediately realizes he should’ve grabbed a coat; the late autumn wind pierces through his thin turtleneck straight to his skin, raising goosebumps. He stumbles a bit in the grass as he tries to find Harry. He had aimed for coordinates a little bit off of Harry’s so that he could find him without immediately being spotted, but all he can see are rolling hills and hedges and the heavy, grey sky. Dry grass crunches under his feet as he makes his way up the small hill he landed near, and–
“You want this?” Harry asks for probably the tenth time. He’s no stranger to Draco’s body, not anymore, but they’ve been surprisingly gentle with each other, warm hands and hushed breath. Draco is terrified of repercussions, so they don’t touch outside of their room or the occasional broom closet, but they’re– together. At least, Harry is pretty sure they are. He’s afraid to ask. But he does know they’re exclusive, and that kissing Draco feels like coming home.
Harry sighs, soft and sad. He doesn’t say anything for a while, long enough that Draco is about to open his mouth when Harry speaks again. “It’s been very lonely.”
, I want you to fuck me so deep there’s no chance you won’t put a baby in me, I want to keep your come in me until the next time you fuck me so I’m all wet, just for your cock, oh god please please–”
“Shut up,” Harry replies weakly, turning his head to nudge his nose into Draco’s hair. The tile is cold and uncomfortable on his back, but he doesn't dare move when Draco is so warm on top of his chest. “Is your bruise okay? Be careful, it’ll still be tender even with the potion if you press it too hard.”
Harry sputters, unable to find words with Draco’s hard cock pressed against his hip, too real through the thin barrier of Harry’s cotton boxers and Draco’s silk pajama trousers. His own cock is throbbing painfully. He knows Draco is just trying to rile him up, but fuck, it’s
“Maybe,” Harry laughs. “But only because you dropped into our living room and then said you’d kill me if I didn’t fuck you, and I was
“It was just you.” Harry realizes he’s trembling, but when he tries to take his hand back, Draco holds on tighter.
“So I can stay?” Harry asks, something hesitant hiding under his light tone, and Draco melts for him.
“What the hell do you do for work?” Draco had gasped out as Harry’s lips found the sensitive spot under his ear.
With a sigh, Harry rolls onto his back, trying to blink away whatever this is. Whatever their magic, tangled and invisible between them, is making him feel. The Healer at St. Mungo’s told them it was only their magic that’s bound together, not their minds or their wills. But there’s no other explanation for the emotions that threaten to cave Harry’s chest in every time he so much as glances at Draco out of the corner of his eye.
“Harry,” Draco whines, tugging my hair insistently until I’m looking up into his grey eyes, glinting bright with arousal. “Harry.”
“W-was it not cold for you?” Draco asks, his voice trembling as he shivers, the chill slowly moving back to his core before disappearing entirely. Harry’s hand stays on the back of his neck, grounding.
“Well we may have some time to cook together,” Harry says hopefully, pouring himself a mug of tea. “Do you have a travel mug?”
Stubbornly, I hold out for a moment, but curiosity wins in the end, and when I finally open my eyes I gasp. Out the expansive windows that line the room the stars blink brightly, throwing faint silvery light into the blue-dark room. Combined with the weightlessness of no gravity, it feels like we’re cradled by that vast infinity.
“What?” Draco asks bluntly, a knee jerk reaction. Warmth floods through his chest and he has to look towards the coffee table, unsure why he suddenly can’t meet Harry’s gaze. “It’s just– it’s not actually that big of a deal.”
Draco nods slowly, his eyes widening. “Yes. Yes, that would make sense. But how would we get objective feedback? Neither of us are in relationships, so we
“Please,” Draco chokes out, even though he didn’t mean to beg– he wanted to retain some semblance of dignity, but he’s quite sure he lost it the second Harry locked eyes with him across the bar. “Please, Potter, please, fuck me so hard I can’t
, Draco, right there, love when you fuck me I love your mouth jesus I love you oh oh Draco suck me off I need your mouth
Draco waves his hand at the cabinet distractedly, already shoving the last bite of breakfast into his mouth and fumbling with his shoes. As he returns to his room to retrieve his briefcase he hears Harry clattering about in the kitchen, and briefly wonders why Harry would need a travel mug.
“You don’t.” His flat flat voice and his flat flat eyes stare stare stare and you want to rip his soul right out from behind this face that isn’t his. Placing your hands flat in the air you pull, pull the glamour right off of him, and he’s himself again, except except except–
“No, you don’t,” Harry says sweetly before biting down onto Draco’s shoulder, hard enough that Draco’s entire body jerks. “I know you can come untouched for me.”
“Please let me stay,” I interrupt. I wish I could see his expression in the dark, but everything is shadows and starlight. “Please. In all the ways you mean. Yes.”
“Here, let me,” Harry murmurs, right behind Draco now. Draco drops his hands and lets Harry spin him around, his dark fingers stark against the white of Draco’s shirt as he finishes undoing the buttons. He efficiently strips Draco of his trousers and pants, then does the same for himself. They could do this partially clothed, Draco knows; the bond doesn’t care how they have sex, as long as they do. But Harry has proven to be a gentleman, insisting they take their time, always tender with Draco yet blind to the way he makes Draco’s heart come undone.
“I think we should decide who is the sexpert once and for all,” Harry says across the couch, and Draco blinks blearily at him.
Harry presses another kiss to Draco’s head, but they’re already pliant with sleep, so Harry mumbles soothing nonsense into Draco’s hair, hoping that they can feel his love even in their dreams.
Draco can’t get to Harry’s skin fast enough– he has Harry stripped to his boxers and flat on the couch as quickly as he can ask for consent. Harry laughs, fumbling with Draco’s fussy turtleneck until he manages to get it off. He simply raises his eyebrows at the curved scars under Draco’s nipples, paying much more attention to the long silvery ones that run diagonal on Draco’s chest, but Draco doesn’t have time for guilt; he presses his mouth down to Harry’s nipple, marveling at the moan the action elicits. Draco presses wet kisses lower, down the thick trail of hair under Harry’s navel, pausing to ask permission before pulling Harry’s boxers down. His throat goes dry at the sight of Harry, sprawled and golden and beautiful, so he takes his time with his mouth and his hands until Harry shakes hard, crying out Draco’s name. His fingers are buried in Draco’s hair, and he tugs up gently, kissing Draco hard even as come trails out of the corner of Draco’s mouth.
is to be between Harry's hands again, and again, and again. But they’re barely halfway to friendship, and Draco has never been brave, so he sulks at gatherings until Harry finds him again, three weeks after Pansy’s place. They’re in a club, this time, and the rest of their friends are lost to the dance floor. Harry crowds up against Draco at the bar, looking too fucking good with his hair pulled into a messy bun and his leather jacket hanging open over a thin white t-shirt.
“Do you want to put it on yourself?” Harry asks. Draco blinks up at him as though confused, then looks down.
“Yeah, I just– I have a surprise for you.” Harry’s eyes dart towards the hallway and back to Draco’s face. “I hope it’s– I hope it’s good? I hope you’ll like it.”
“Look at you,” Harry pants as he thrusts hard, the rough materials of his jeans rasping against Draco’s sensitive skin. “You’re gagging for it.”
After some shimmying and grumbling from Draco, his pyjama bottoms and pants are on the floor and he’s sitting close to the edge of the couch. Harry looks up through his lashes, taking in the flush of Draco’s cheeks, his ruffled hair, the flash of pale collarbone where the red jumper slides down. Harry leans his cheek against Draco’s thigh and inhales the sweet vanilla scent of his body wash and something deeper, muskier. Draco’s cock, soft and pink, lays in front of Harry’s lips, but Harry looks up one more time.
“Please,” Harry says, arching his back as Draco starts to ride him, the new angle making Harry’s toes curl. Every time Harry stops to gasp a breath, Draco stills, so eventually an endless stream of
“Please,” Harry gasps, desperate; then Draco is pale and naked and gorgeous, breathing hard under Harry’s kisses. The Dark Mark lays stark against Draco’s pale arm but when she pulls away Harry pins her wrist to the bed, not letting her hide. Draco tugs Harry’s pyjamas off; Harry forgets to be self-conscious under Draco’s hungry gaze. They’re gentle, just as Draco promised they could be, exploratory fingers and lips against skin. When Harry reaches between Draco’s legs it’s a revelation, and their gasps tangle up into one sound.
“Shh, just listen. She had a lot of daughters, her moonbeams, but there was one that was the brightest of all. This moonbeam was beautiful, and shone down to earth with such determination, that the moon decided to give this daughter a single wish.” Harry strokes her hands through Draco’s hair again, then traces the shell of her ear. “Do you want to know what she wished for?”
“Thank you,” Harry says quietly. He’s staring down at the ground, subdued. “Thank you for– caring. I’m sorry that I– I’m sorry, Draco. Really. I care about you too, you know.”
Draco, weren’t you on a date tonight?” He was, Harry remembered. Draco had been so excited all week to have been asked out by an acquaintance of a coworker. Harry even helped him pick out the outfit he’s wearing right now, slim cut trousers and a deep blue button down.
Hermione cuts her eyes to Harry and he stares back, tight lipped. She places her croissant back in the bag and sighs, turning to look at Draco.
Harry shrugs. “As much as I enjoyed that, no. But I really don’t mind. Coming isn’t always the finish line.”
“Just because you’ve convinced Harry that you’re reformed doesn’t mean anyone else believes you.” The Ravenclaw stalks closer and Draco’s breath catches in his throat; he used to know how to react quickly, before panic took up permanent residence in his ribs. “You’re barely the dirt under his shoe, Death–”
“I am. I am good, I’m good for you.” Harry says the words like a litany all his own, like he finally believes they’re true. “I know how to make you feel good because I
friends. It’s just that they’re also not quite close enough to truly deserve the label, either. They straddle the awkward line of acquaintanceship, since Draco has been working with Hermione Granger for years now and certainly considers her a friend. Harry, it seems, is a package deal, and Draco has exchanged vaguely uncomfortable small talk with the man at gatherings and pub nights more times than he can count. He’s just always
“Harry,” Draco murmurs, pressing his lips to the top of Harry’s head, and Harry sags against him, resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder, the harsh line of Draco’s body softened by his jumper. “You
“I did,” Harry says, oddly fierce, and Draco finally looks up to the doorway where Harry is standing, lit by the soft glow of the fairy lights, and time stops.
“Oh, she definitely would. I’ll owl her later.” Harry exhales, his bright eyes darting over Draco’s face. “I’m proud of you, you know.”
“You–” Harry starts, his voice tight. He kicks at a rock on the pavement, sending it skittering down the alley. “You’re hard to find.”
and a thump before Pepper comes pattering down the hall, disappearing into Harry’s room. Draco can hear Harry still shuffling around in the living room, probably tidying after the whirlwind that is Draco coming in from work. “It’s good for me to be up and moving anyways.”
“I don’t mind,” Draco says. Harry hums skeptically, and Draco continues, firmer. “No, Harry, I’m serious. I… I like you a
“Here.” Harry kneels down next to Malfoy, ignoring the way she stiffens. “You’re putting too much dirt in. You have to leave enough room to create a deep hole, for the tuber to be put into.” Harry dips her hands into the pot, putting some dirt back in the bag. She braces herself for a cutting remark, but Malfoy just sighs.
“I think you’re underestimating me,” Harry replies with a grin, kissing down the planes of Draco’s stomach until Draco is squirming underneath him.
Harry presses his hand over Draco’s mouth, smug as Draco’s eyes flash open to stare at him in surprise. “
Harry shifts slightly with a whimper, and Draco presses a hand to Harry’s forehead. His skin is burning, clammy.
Harry laughs low in his throat, tugging Draco towards him easily by the chain. Draco topples forward, landing on his hands, and Harry grabs his bare wrist and pulls Draco to his chest until he’s staring up at Harry, their faces inches apart. Draco’s lips are bitten pink and parted, and his tongue darts out to wet them, knowing full well how that drives Harry mad.
“Let me heal you,” Harry says, his voice cracking halfway through. Draco shakes his head, then curls into himself as Harry reaches out, letting his hand hang in the air between them. “Malfoy, please.”
Harry hums softly, unsure, so Draco drops it for now and rubs his hand in circles over Harry’s back until he falls asleep, snoring softly against Draco’s collarbone.
. I would like to be fucked now, please,” Draco says, his voice prim despite the undercurrent of humor, and I can’t help my own amused snort.
“Baby.” Harry kneels down in front of Draco, rubbing a thumb over Draco’s jaw. Draco is trembling slightly with the effort to keep still the way Harry told him to at the beginning of the scene. “How should I use you tonight?”
“Oh, babe, that’s dramatic.” I kick off the wall and turn a lazy somersault in the air towards him, the pet name rolling off my tongue before I can catch myself. It’s not new–
“I don’t trust you.” Draco shudders just once before holding frightfully still. “You’re just as bad as everyone else, except you have better access to my
when you saw the files the orders the kill dates his name written red like blood on the top page when no one will listen to you when they showed up at Grimmauld Place wands blazing afraid of what you know you’re not erratic you’re just–
“Please what?” Harry asks, his gaze never leaving Draco’s even as he takes his hand off of Draco’s cock and slides it further down. As his fingers trace a path down Draco’s perineum, Draco digs his own into Harry’s biceps.
“Hello,” Draco repeats, vapidly, like he doesn’t know any other words. He’s rather convinced they’ve all fled. “Thank you. For responding. To my letter. The one I sent. Here, to your house.”
“Easy, big boy,” Draco mutters when they break apart. “Jesus.” Harry hums a bit unhappily, then murmurs something that makes his finger freshly wet as he slides it back into Draco without warning. Draco yelps, twisting his face into Harry’s sweat-slick neck and then pressing sloppy kisses there.
as his orgasm rolls through him, unstoppable. He hears himself shout, the cuffs digging into his skin as sparks lick through his body. Above him Harry has his face turned to the ceiling again, baring the long line of his throat, and as Draco starts to come down Harry grinds onto him and
“Draco,” Harry starts, unsure what he’s trying to say. “Draco, I…” He trails off as Draco’s hand slides underneath his, delicately pulling it away from the steering wheel. Harry adjusts to drive one-handed, the clammy fingers of his free hand tangled up in Draco’s.
“Hey– oh,” Harry says, blinking at me. I look down, but I’m just wearing a set of silken sleep robes, nothing special. Before I can question his reaction he slides out of the bed, gesturing towards it. “I have to sleep closer to the door. Just a thing.”
“Good morning, Hermione. Sorry about…” He waves in the general direction of his face. “This. I usually apply glamours before seeing anyone, they wear off overnight.”
“Hedwig, prep for full warp speed to get us out of this quadrant. Then half-speed until, ehhhh, until we pass G6.”
You stare at the Dark Mark on your naked arm, pleased you got it right, slip your hand to your pocket to smooth down love-torn paper, a talisman
Draco should’ve known he would fall for Harry. It’s nearly laughable, the way it sneaks up on him, hitting all at once on an ordinary Saturday morning, when Harry yawns widely and rolls over before stretching his arm out across Draco’s chest.
like it’s as easy as breathing, like he’s never doubted it and never will. Draco never doubts his own love for Harry, but that’s why he keeps it close to his chest. It’s an honour, to hold Harry’s heart.
“Please,” Harry says softly, holding his hands out as though gentling a wild animal. Draco stops moving backwards but his chest is heaving, his eyes bright and wide. “Draco, please, I– I can’t fall asleep without you. Our house isn’t a
“I know what it’s like to run away,” I say softly. I can already see the weight of the choice in the line of Draco’s shoulders. He exhales harshly. “Granted, if you’ve got any units to throw my way for the trouble of harboring a fugitive crown prince, I would not refuse them.”
“Gravity!” Draco yells, loud in the close quarters of the cockpit, and I bark out a startled laugh. “Why do you have to have nicknames and acronyms for
.” Draco exhales roughly as Harry tugs on the plug infinitesimally, his other hand still wrapped around Draco’s cock. At his silence, Harry stops moving.
“Let’s just–” Draco stops, then starts to pull off his jumper. Harry takes his cue and undresses Draco the rest of the way, then sheds his own clothing quickly. By the time he gets back on the bed Draco is splayed out, pale and beautiful, his eyes already closed. Harry asks to touch, like he always does. Draco nods his consent, clearly trying to keep his expression blank but failing when Harry slides a finger in and brushes against his prostate.
Draco blinks up at Harry, dazed, and Harry smooths a hand over his sweaty hairline. Harry’s breath comes in harsh pants as he presses his lips to Draco’s shoulder, bringing Draco down from his trembling.
“Then prove it,” he says, rolling his hips up, and I barely bite back a groan. Holding up a finger to indicate
“It is, though,” Harry says, painfully sincere. “You deserve a life outside of work. You deserve to have down-time, and boundaries.”
Harry is warm beside him, their shoulders a respectable distance apart but their hands pressed together across the expanse of sheets. Draco hates sleeping on his back, he’s too aware of the sharpness of his body and the aches of each day low in his spine, but he can’t turn away from Harry without letting go, and he can’t turn toward Harry without possibly seeing his profile and doing something very unprofessional in a fit of reduced inhibition brought about by Harry’s gentle breath, by how rumpled he looked in plaid pajama bottoms as they slid under the covers earlier.
“You need to talk to him,” Draco says, his demanding words softened by familiarity. Hermione presses a hand to her forehead, then exhales.
,” Harry says resolutely. He presses a sweet kiss to Draco’s cheek, and in the warmth of his soft lips Draco feels the truth behind both of their words.
“Get out of my flat,” Harry says, low in his throat. Both Joshua and Draco freeze. Joshua simply gapes at Harry, and Draco– Draco is fighting an incredulous smile, and that alone tells Harry he did the right thing. Draco stands up, tangling his hands in the hem of his jumper and flicking his gaze between the two other men. He moves closer to Harry, knocking against his shoulder as Joshua stands too.
Finally, Draco presses fully against me, nuzzling his nose into the hollow of my throat. “I’m counting on that. Are you sure we have to get up?”
“I mean, I know it’s me,” Harry continues, taking a slow sip of coffee. “But I feel like you don’t quite believe that.”
“Yeah,” Harry agrees, nodding enthusiastically. “Whoever has the most points at the end is deemed the official sexpert, then. That makes perfect sense, and ‘cause we’re friends it won’t be weird, right?”
The carpet is soft on Draco’s knees. At his back, the belt isn’t too tight– both of them know it’s not suited for more than a simple reminder. Harry had never told Draco to stop looking, so he watches as Harry yanks off his jumper, then stands right above Draco to slide his jeans and pants off. They crumple to a heap on the floor and Harry kicks them away before sitting back down. Later, when Draco is clean and warm and held, he’ll complain about it, but now he turns his gaze to the confident spread of Harry’s legs. The firelight crackles warm across the curved scars on Harry’s chest, the soft hair on his stomach, and lower– lower.
He stills at that, his entire body shuddering as his glamours drop. It’s with his own big green eyes that he starts crying, struggling to breathe under your palm. Fuck. Take your hand away. Smooth down his hair. Shush him softly, tenderly.
“You know, years ago I wouldn’t have slept until I could figure out what’s wrong, but now I barely have the energy to take care of a one-year-old,” Hermione says, gazing unseeingly down at the ground. Her voice is very quiet. “I don’t know how to help Harry if he won’t
starting to recover from what you put me through. Why would you come here and– and set me back like this?"
to me– they’re withdrawing the verdicts from the trials– Marked Death Eaters– there was so many fucking–
Hours later, after a speed-run of research and delicate spellwork and panic, Harry blinks his bright eyes, strangely naked without his glasses. When he finally focuses on Draco’s face, he breaks out into a grin that shoots warmth right through Draco’s chest.
The moment Draco touches himself his entire body goes stiff, and Harry thrusts into him twice more before Draco yells, tightening around Harry and curling into himself. Harry follows into orgasm soon after, heat flooding his thighs as he presses himself down to Draco’s back, murmuring nonsense words into Draco’s sweat-slick skin. When he blinks his eyes open, Draco is trembling underneath him, so Harry slides out of him with a wet
“Oh, Harry,” you say gently, and your soul is flooding back into your limbs, filling you with warmth all the way to your fingertips. “Oh, Harry, Harry.”
“Hey, watch the water,” he exclaims, holding the cup away from his body, but he’s laughing. “Here you go, baby.”
“What do you want?” I ask, and he rests his hands on top of my thighs. “Tell me what you like doing, if you like leading or not.Anything. I wanna know.”
“But… but you deserve…” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand, gently so it won’t hurt. “Draco. You deserve someone who likes you but also
“Well?” Draco asks softly, not looking at Harry. His cheeks are flushed a deep pink and Harry isn’t much better off, heat coursing through him. Shifting on the bed, Draco wraps a hand around Harry’s hip. “Are you going to move?”
There’s a few moments of silence as Malfoy gathers Harry’s hair into a loose ponytail, then lets it drop. “Yes.”
“What do you want?” Draco asks, looking down at Harry through their pale lashes. The lacy strap of their sheer, ice blue nightie is slipping down their shoulder, but they can’t do anything about it, not with their wrists bound behind their back in the soft cuffs Harry bought for their third anniversary, so Harry reaches up and slides the strap back into place. He thumbs over the soft lace, then Draco’s skin– there’s a trail of deep red lovebites down Draco’s neck. Harry places a possessive hand around the base of Draco’s throat, their pulse fluttering under his fingers. They look like an angel like this, flushed pink and smiling as though they have a secret.
“Rothwell asked me to interview a Quidditch player over lunch this weekend and I just said no. I just said no!” Draco laughs, a bit breathless. “I said ‘Sorry I can’t, I’m not scheduled to work on the weekends, but I’ll certainly get you the article on the Werewolf Rights Commission by Friday afternoon.’ And do you know what she said?”
Draco hums around his toothbrush, meeting Harry’s eyes in the mirror before looking back at his own reflection. He needs a haircut, he thinks vaguely. Pale locks of hair are curling up under his ears, and that’s usually the indicator.
isn’t a relationship,” Draco spits, his calm cracking. There’s a sharp inhale and Harry steps back as though he’s been slapped.
“No. Listen to me, Harry Potter.” Your voice is wrecked. Is this being alive? Lie through your teeth. “You don’t get to come here wearing my face and saying things like that. You don’t. I have a life. I am alive. I don’t need you.”
“Okay.” Draco pulls her hand away entirely, shrinking into herself. “Sorry, I thought– I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to push you.”
“You think you’re so high and mighty? Just because you’re the Chosen One, you’re above everyone else?”
“So good,” Harry whispers against Draco’s skin as he slides his cock out with a wet sound. He immediately starts undoing the cuffs, keeping his hands on Draco as much as possible. “You were so good, baby. So good for me. I’m right here, okay? I just need to get these cuffs off, there you go.” Hands run down Draco’s side, gently rolling him onto his back, and then Harry is there, all of his warmth wrapped around Draco. The sheets are already miraculously clean, and Harry murmurs something that sets off the distant sound of the tap flowing into the bathtub. “We’ll get in the bath in a moment, alright? Do you need a glass of water?”
It takes a moment for Draco’s blissed out mind to understand what Harry’s asking, and he nuzzles into Harry’s neck as his cheeks heat up. “Ride my face,” he says into the warmth of Harry’s skin. “I want– you. I want you.”
“Hello!” Draco’s exclamation cuts through the air. “Would anyone care to tell me what you two are talking about?”
“I don’t think Draco’s enjoying it very much,” Harry says plainly, but Joshua just grins, jostling Draco with the arm slung over his shoulder.
“That’s what you’re supposed to do after a breakup. When someone leaves without warning,” Harry says. He hasn’t come any closer, but his low voice carries; Draco’s body gravitates toward it instinctively, even after all this time.
“Thank you,” Draco murmurs, an echo of their usual soft demeanor, the person they are outside the bedroom. This bossy, confident Draco– they’re
“It wasn’t planned,” he murmurs, his voice suddenly low and warm, and he sneaks a hand under my shirt, tracing light patterns across the skin of my waist. “You’re kinda irresistible.”
quite beautiful. Enough to catch the eyes of men who would keep their mouths shut about a prince’s preferences.
him. Before, Draco touched him like an apology; now it’s a statement, fingers digging into Harry’s skin. Draco cries out Harry’s name when he comes.
,” Harry growls, and the student scrambles away. The corridor is growing busier as classes end, so Draco follows as Harry heads down towards a tucked away alcove, never letting go of Harry’s hand.
“I–I can’t do that,” Harry stammers, heat rising to his cheeks at the tangle of anxiety and uncertainty and
“Are you angry at me?” Harry asks into Draco’s shirt, and Draco shakes his head sharply so that Harry can feel it.
Harry sees red. Before he knows what he’s doing, his hands are fisted in Draco’s silk pajama top so tightly that his knuckles ache. He shoves Draco against the dresser, and Draco throws his arms out, scrabbling for purchase on the wood.
The burns have turned a shiny pink, as though they’re a week old– the salve doesn’t heal completely, just speeds up the process. Draco traces a thumb down one swirling line for a moment before suddenly remembering his anger.
There’s a beat of silence before Draco laughs, sharp and disbelieving. “We can just go back to how we were before, you don’t have to keep pretending–”
“Because you’re happy, and I’m your friend?” Harry’s voice is more hesitant than he intends. “I wanted to be supportive.”
you. I’m not ticklish, you see, but my delicate constitution–” Harry rucks Draco’s t-shirt up in one swift movement and blows a raspberry on Draco’s belly button, and Draco promptly shoves him to the floor in a fit of self-preserving instinct. “I’m going to
“I’m washing up after meals.” Draco grabs the empty plates and heads to the sink, as though he’s going to make good on that statement immediately. “It’s fair.”
,” Harry says, because he knows how Draco likes to be reminded. “That’s why I fuck you, pet. To remind you that you, your cock, your wet
“Think we can get the rest in one trip, then?” Harry asks, shoving Pepper away from the fireplace with his foot. She lets out a pathetic
Harry shifts, biting back a moan as Draco clenches around his cock. He stills as Draco cuts him a look, their eyes narrowing.
. There’s a well in Draco’s heart, with Harry pressed between every brick, and Draco has yet to find the bottom.
“Merlin.” Harry pulls away panting and fists Draco’s formal robes in his hands. “You like the plug?”
“It doesn't.” Draco rolls onto his back to face the ceiling, too. He doesn’t mention that Harry’s warmth keeps his own nightmares away.
“A tie means we need a tiebreaker,” Draco says, his eyes flicking down to Harry’s soft cock before he blinks and pulls the comforter over himself, burrowing down into it. Harry taps the end of the biro against the notebook on his thigh with a frown. “We need another sex act to do.”
good for me,” Harry says, letting disappointment seep into his tone. “I have no choice but to tie you up now.”
Harry’s mouth drops open slightly at the lowered pitch of Draco’s tone. Draco smirks at him, and Harry shivers minutely.
“Harry.” Draco places a palm to the invisible barrier, sliding down to his knees. He feels– he’s too terrified to feel anything, really. Terrified for Harry. Terrified for himself, of what he’ll do if something happens to Harry.
,” Harry says as earnestly as he can, and that rings true also. He’s fine living with this feeling on his own as long as Draco knows how wonderful he is. “Really. You were just on a date, for Merlin’s sake. I understand why it wouldn’t be me. But you are
Harry acted like that. Sure, Draco likes girls, she’s not quiet about it but– but Harry is just Harry, and Draco looks like
Malfoy frowns, true hurt flashing across her expression, and Harry feels a twinge of guilt. Before coming back for eighth year, Malfoy cut her hair right at her chin, choppy and jagged. It’s wildly different than the waterfall of silvery blonde it’s always been, and Harry hates that she’s kind of in love with it.
Draco’s orgasm hits him out of nowhere, heat rushing up his thighs and leaving him gasping as Harry continues to move his hand through the come now smeared over Draco’s cock and Harry’s fingers. He shudders in the aftershocks and shifts away from Harry’s hand with a whimper. Immediately Harry is leaning over him, gently combing through Draco’s hair with his clean hand and pressing kisses to Draco’s cheek. “You’re so good for me,” he murmurs, his voice sweet against Draco’s skin. “Do you like being good for me, baby? Do you think I should give you what you asked for?”
“I know,” Harry pants, holding himself above Draco, running a slick hand over Draco’s flushed pink cock. “I know, I’m good at this, I know how to–”
.” The smooth expression on Harry’s face crumples, and Draco immediately wants to shove his words back down his throat.
Harry roughly pushes Draco down to the bed even as Draco thrashes, bodily pinning his flailing limbs. “No, get off me,
“Hi,” Harry says almost timidly. Draco tries to catch his breath as Harry shifts, sliding out of Draco, pressing a palm to Draco’s cheek when he winces. “You’re alright. Let me put the strap in the loo, alright? I’ll be right back to clean us up.”
“You want to stick your fucking golden cock in me,” Draco snarls, grabbing Harry’s wrist hard enough to bruise and shoving his hand down between their bodies. “Savior of the wizarding world, and you’d touch
“W-what– what?” Draco gasps, still racked with shivers. Harry’s hands are cupping the back of Draco’s neck, burning so hot it’s nearly painful.
“No, I need to touch you.” Draco closes his eyes, pressing his cock up against Harry’ stomach until Harry
Harry snorts, wriggling around until he’s peering blurrily at Draco. His face is flushed, from sex or happiness– Draco can’t tell. Perhaps both.
“We can share the bed, if you’re okay with that. It’s big enough. I’m just a bit headstrong, sometimes.”
“You make the rest of the flat lovely enough to make up for it,” Draco interrupts, and Harry flushes happily. Before Draco can think too hard about the fluttering in his stomach, he stands up suddenly. “Fuck, I gotta get to sleep. I have a meeting at seven tomorrow, because Rothwell is trying to murder me.”
“Good,” Harry says when he breaks away, unable to stop warm affection from spilling into his voice. Draco is just as still as before, looking up at Harry through his lashes. “You’ve been very good, baby. I think I’ll let you choose what we do this time, since you stayed so still and didn’t make any noise, just like I asked. I’m going to give you two options, and you can think about it while I undress. Nod to let me know you understand, or shake your head if you need something else.”
“Dance with me,” I say, threading my fingers through his. He lets me, extricating one hand to grab onto my upper arm.
“You’re not a bother,” he says, elbowing Harry towards the wall. He slides under the covers, immediately overwhelmed by the scent of
him, I want him to stay on my ship, I want to see the stars with him, and I wonder if he can read it on my face. In my body language. In my voice.
. Harry moves directly into Draco’s line of sight, and when he nods Draco returns his hand to the small of his back.
When I come back into the room, pajama clad and much sleepier than ten minutes ago, Harry is sitting upright in the bed, tapping away at a small handheld device. The bed itself is tucked into an alcove in the wall and larger than I expected for a ship this size, and the overall effect is coziness.
“Water’s fine.” Harry grabs his wand and levitates the plates over to the kitchen table. Draco sets down two glasses of water and they slide into their chairs at the same time, settling into the meal. Harry takes a moment to appreciate how easy this is– their friendship was hard-won through apologies and long talks about the war, but now they’re comfortable with each other. Comfortable enough to be roommates, at least, which Harry thinks is nearly a miracle considering who they are.
you,” Harry states, and Draco’s lips part slightly. “I like the way you make me laugh, and I like watching weird movies with you, and I like the way you push your hair out of your eyes when you get really excited about something, and I like– I like your hands.”
A strong desire to grab Draco and just shake him grips Harry, but he shrugs it off; it isn’t Draco’s fault that the wizards he dates are starstruck by Harry. On a more selfish level Harry already dislikes Joshua, even though they’ve only had a few interactions, because he surely isn’t good enough for Draco–
“Obviously,” they interrupt with a snort, and I cross my arms over my chest. “You need to get off that ship, kid. With the way those alarms are going, I don’t think you’re gonna be able to fix whatever’s wrong.”
“You want to fuck me,” Draco says, his eyes half-lidded but glinting with happiness, and Harry can’t hold back a groan because Draco never curses, rarely says anything during sex, but now–

She blinks her big blue eyes at him. She’s pretty, and he wants to tell her, except the words keep getting stuck behind something that aches a lot like the way looking at Draco in the morning makes Harry ache. No strings, they’d said. It just made sense, when Draco ended up shaking in Harry’s bed with nightmares anyways.
“No,” Draco says, his momentary shock quickly turning into an anger that matches Harry’s. He’s quivering like a trapped animal under Harry’s hand, but his gaze is sharp. “I won’t. You want to fuck me.”
“Give me a colour,” Harry says, and Draco’s shoulders twitch like he wants to move, but won’t. “Oh, yes. You can move your hands.”
. He seems to be holding himself back from something, and I do respect those boundaries, but every morning he has a shadow of stubble on the cut of his jaw and I have to remember how to breathe. The bed sheets smell like him, or he smells like them; it’s all a circle at this point.
Harry laughs, that warm rumbly thing that sends Draco’s nerves tingling all the way down to his toes, and that’s how he sinks into sleep– with the sound of Harry’s happiness, breaking up the darkness.
Harry shifts again, burrowing closer to Draco until he can press his face into Draco’s neck. His breath is warm, and Draco starts to rub circles in Harry’s back as he talks, slightly muffled by Draco’s turtleneck.
“I have a topical potion for bruises,” Harry says softly. “Let me go grab it, okay?” He starts to move away but Draco grabs his wrist, his eyes suddenly wild and panicked.
“You don’t need to touch yourself,” Harry says again, his rhythm stuttering. “I know you can be good for me. Do you want to be good, sweetheart?”
“You– you– oh.” Draco trembles again, bringing his hands up and grabbing Harry’s wrists almost desperately. “Are you– are you sure you do, that you feel– like that, towards
“No you’re not,” Harry says before whining long and high as Draco crooks his fingers. Draco presses his mouth to Harry’s collarbone, licking off the beads of sweat gathered there. “You’re not, I’m not gonna come, it’s just–"
Not at Harry– no– never at Harry. This is rage at the Ministry, and the people who think they can still use Harry, even now. This is rage at the fact that there are people who use Harry’s ever-giving heart for their own purposes.
The small rendering of the troubled ship taunts me, blinking red. I squint as something clicks into place.
“Come here often?” Malfoy says, throwing Harry an amused glance. They stumble upon each other more nights than not at this point, and Harry tucks herself onto the end of the couch as usual. Malfoy cocks her head, staring at the messy bun gathered on top of Harry’s head. “That’s bad for your curls, you know.”
Harry blinks. All of his intense energy has fallen away, and he simply looks soft and well shagged. Despite himself, Draco takes the chance to look at all of Harry at once– his powerful arms, his solid chest, the thick trail of hair leading down to the vee of his legs.
“Yeah.” Draco presses their foreheads together and Harry swallows, trying to smooth his voice out. “Yeah, that wasn’t your best move.”
“No,” I reply automatically, the shock of his impulse to apologize for that setting in slowly. “Don’t apologize. It’s– it’s your body, and we’ll go however slow you need to for this to be good.”
At the trials, he stood bright and shining. He spoke for you. He pulled you through Eighth year, his own charisma dragging yours to the surface, keeping the darkness down. His jumper held onto your tears.
“Sit,” she says gently, and he does, pressing against her side, dragging comfort from her warmth. “I know it’s upsetting. But he… I’m sure it’s so much harder on him. I wish…” She sighs, resting her head on top of Harry’s. “It makes sense why he doesn’t want to get close. So it’ll hurt him less too.”
“Do you remember the first week of the bond?” Harry asks, pitching his voice a bit lower, trying to sooth Draco. “When we had to be together all the time, and even though we had already made our peace with each other before, it was going terribly. But then you snapped something like, ‘at this point only one of us is making it out of this week alive and it
“Huh,” Harry says. “Do you feel anything?” Draco shakes his head, but even as he does something decidedly

“Bollocks,” Harry says immediately, trying to keep his face straight. “You’ve lived with me for over a year, you
through?” Harry asks incredulously, taking a step back from the threshold of the Manor. He stares at Draco’s pinched face, dim in the unlit entryway. “I’m not the one who fucking ran away.”
.” Harry drops his voice low, sing-song. “Do you wanna be my baby?” Draco shoves him half-heartedly, trying to hide the hot blush he can feel creep up his cheeks, but Harry presses forward with a grin. “Do you wanna be my darling, my sweetheart, my angel–”
“I’m sorry I didn’t know,” Harry says, suddenly aware of the fact that if Draco hadn’t gone on his date tonight he wouldn’t have gotten hurt. As though Draco can read Harry’s thoughts, he vehemently shakes his head.
“Draco,” Harry says quietly. When Draco turns around, Harry is standing in the doorway to the kitchen, his fingers worrying at the edge of Draco’s red jumper. His eyes are bright behind his glasses, and Draco realizes a moment too late that Harry is about to cry.
“Oh,” Draco says, immediately reaching to wrap his arms and the blanket around Harry, trying to keep his own heart from breaking. “It must have been. But you’re not alone, Harry. You have people who need you around–
“You fuck me so good, so perfectly, your cock was made for me,” Draco says, half out of his mind and handcuffed to his own headboard. Harry comes shouting Draco’s name.
“Draco,” Harry says. He doesn’t go far, just enough to look Draco in the eyes; his arms are still looped loosely around Draco’s waist and his gaze is intense, yet questioning.
“I feel lost, a lot of the time.” Harry swallows hard, staring straight ahead at the road. A light touch brushes his knee, and then Draco’s hand is there, warm and grounding. “But not when I’m with you.”
It’s discrete, a charm he crafted during the war with too much time on his hands and too much paranoia. He checks his wand on his work breaks for a week, writing down the coordinates in his small journal then placing dots on a map when he gets home. There’s no pattern to Harry’s movements, but they’re much more widespread than Draco expected– Harry moves all across England over the span of the week, in seemingly random locations, often nowhere near a town. At first, Draco feels guilty for tracking Harry like this– it’s an invasion of privacy that Draco is all too aware of. Yet he has no choice, really, since Harry still won’t tell him anything and he doesn’t want Harry to die in his flat one day.
He moves down to Draco’s balls, painfully slowly, and licks the entire flat of his tongue along them. Draco is panting and the bed creaks as he pulls at his restraints, every sensation heightened by the fact that he can’t see. Harry shifts on the bed again and his mouth is gone, replaced by light fingertips. He traces a path all the way down to tap a fingernail at the base of the plug with a metallic
.” The word comes out like a sob and Draco turns his face away sharply. “I don’t want to get married, there’s too much– expectation for me, the way I was raised, it feels– I just can’t. But I don’t know how to tell you that and still have you know that I would give you my entire
“That wasn’t a one time thing, was it?” Draco asks, her voice trembling slightly. Harry hugs her so tightly that Draco wheezes.
“What happened to begging?” Harry asks, sitting up and wandlessly Summoning his strap-on from the dresser drawer. Draco doesn’t even try to hide the shiver of heat that shoots down his spine at the sight. When Harry turns toward Draco, pulling the harness straps snug, his gaze is heavy with intention. “I like when you beg.”
“I’m starting to think you don’t really,” Harry replies dryly, and Draco shoves him to the ground and kisses him. It’s hard and deep and so mind-numbingly miraculous and– and–
The receptionist looks at them with more interest and Harry shifts uncomfortably on the balls of his feet. As soon as she hands them their room key, Harry grabs Draco’s arm and tugs him back out the doors and into the car. Draco stays quiet, the way he has been since Nashville. Quiet and watchful.
. Except that Draco feels like the other side of Harry, a coin flipped up to the light, and he doesn't know what it is but Draco dying will surely rend an unstitchable hole in the fabric of Harry’s existence.
“It’s from the fifties,” Harry responds, a touch of pride in his voice. “I painted it to match the bookshelf myself, though. I figured no matter how hard you try not to, you’ll always be bringing work home, so you should at least have a dedicated space.”
“Why didn’t you go home?” Harry asks softly. Draco lives with Pansy– she would’ve taken care of him.
“You motherfucker,” Draco gasps in awe, which sends warmth flooding through my chest, because he definitely picked that up from me. Living with him generates a rather constant flow of curses, and he’s delighted by every single one, which sometimes makes me sad about how sheltered he was. But being in close proximity to me is kind of a crash course on how to
Despite Draco’s claims, Harry is right; she fits around Draco’s back perfectly, slotting their knees together as Draco curls into herself. Harry presses soft kisses to the prominent bumps of Draco’s spine, eliciting a content hum.
Draco breaks away first this time, pressing his forehead to Harry’s as they move clumsily across the tiles, stepping on each other's bare feet, which sends Harry into a fit of giggles. Soon Draco is laughing too, wildly, as though he can’t help it. Harry’s joy is too big for his body, and Draco’s words resonate somewhere deep inside his chest.
“You’re–” Draco’s words stick in his throat, and he closes his eyes against the sight of Harry’s earnest face. “God, Harry. Merlin. God. I hate you.”
There’s a sudden buzz in his pocket and he pulls his mobile out frantically, ignoring the way his conversation partner’s eyes go comically wide at the Muggle device. There’s a short text from Harry on the screen:
“Stars.” He’s shell-shocked, staring at me, and I see the moment it clicks as his face contorts with fear and anger. “Well
,” Harry snaps, shocked that Draco would even suggest it. “No. Tell me what’s wrong.” Draco shakes his head, dragging warm tears across Harry’s skin. “Please.”
“Bed,” Draco gasps as Harry’s fingers fumble at the button of his trousers. “I want you to fuck me on the
With a huff, Draco slides his socked feet around on the carpet too, and they shuffle around in a strange little dance. The crisp winter air nearly crackles around Harry’s hair.
“I–I.” Draco grabs at Harry’s shoulder as Harry moves away from him. The absence of his warmth leaves Draco bereft and panicked because what the fuck is he even
There are so many things Harry knows, things he knew before the bond– Draco’s anxiety, how he takes his tea, that he’s a morning person, how he can’t stand bananas. He knows Draco didn’t mean to become a Cursebreaker, but can’t imagine any other occupation now. Harry knows how to tell when Draco is getting a migraine, knows when to hand Draco’s reading glasses to him before he starts squinting stubbornly.
“You mean I spent seven years in an unrequited rivalry? What a waste of energy.” There’s a strange lilt to Malfoy’s voice, and Harry realizes she’s
Harry’s grip on Draco’s bare upper arm falters, just a bit. Draco could live the rest of his life with Harry touching him– with his palms, with his calloused fingers, heavy with the pair of thick gold rings Draco gifted him recently. They lessen the effects of Dark curses– a finicky bit of old magic woven into them, delicate but strong. A gift that made sense to give a coworker in their line of work, Draco had reasoned with himself.
Draco manages a content hum, and burrows further under Harry’s arm. Warm air stirs through his hair, a sign of Harry’s breathless, happiest laugh.
Draco rolls his eyes, and Harry could kill Draco himself for being so nonchalant about his imminent mortality. “You’re not some avenging angel. Not for this. Drop it, Harry.”
“I didn’t bring you on board with a stunner held to your head. I haven’t tied you up and shoved you in my storage closet to deal with later. I haven’t handcuffed you to my dining table.”
“Uhm.” Harry takes a breath in and wipes his palms on his trousers, trying to ignore how sweaty they are. Him and Draco are
“Baby,” Harry says, and Draco’s lashes flutter. He’s kneeling on the floor, naked, perfectly poised the way Harry asked him to be: back straight, shoulders held proud. It’s a gift, this surrender, and they both know it. The black ribbon tie of the gag hangs in a large bow, trailing down the nape of Draco’s neck. Harry stands to the side, and at his soft endearment Draco straightens even more.
“We can talk about it,” Draco says softly, but Harry is already off the bed and slamming the door to the bathroom. Draco sinks down onto the sheets, wincing at the stickiness of his own come on his stomach and Harry’s between his legs. When it grows too uncomfortable to bear, he grabs his wand and casts a cleaning spell, then pads down the hall to the bathroom. He doesn’t try the doorknob, just asks, “Harry?”
“Harry?” Draco asks after a while, his voice tentative. Everything about Draco is tentative, these days. “Will you actually drive a bit longer?”
,” he laughs, and I scowl, because his humor is definitely at my expense. “Draco. You’ve really never been in space for long, have you?”
,” he says, his expression wondrous. Reaching out for him, I catch his hands as I shimmy down the bed, laying underneath him as he straddles my waist. “You’re so fucking hot. Are you sure?”
“Yeah?” He’s already breathless, and I smile against his skin. The barest scratch of stubble rubs against my lip and I kiss his jaw again. “You’re gonna be good for me, pet? What do you want to do?”
“It’s not that, just–” I sniff again, but the tears are already escaping the corners of my eye. “I’m just really– oh, I
, and I have things that turn me on that may not work for other people, but that doesn’t matter because it’s just
“Please,” Harry repeats, moving his other hand to Draco’s thigh, digging his tensed fingers in as Draco moves again. “Please, Draco, please baby, I want– I want– god, please.”
“I don’t know.” Draco sniffs, trying not to sound pitiful. “You left. You– you always hold me afterwards.”
“Okay,” Harry murmurs with a bright smile, which is how Draco ends up doubled over his takeout box-strewn coffee table laughing harder than he can remember, because he didn’t know Harry was this
“Please come for me,” Harry says, and Draco opens their eyes, meeting Harry’s gaze. The adoration on their face punches the air right out of Harry’s chest, and he hears a soft
“Save him,” Harry murmurs, letting his head fall back onto the hospital pillow. “I was just thinking
“This is more important,” Draco says plainly, like it’s the truth, and Harry rolls his eyes as he casts a wandless cleaning spell. Draco yelps, then sticks his tongue out at Harry, but he sounds pleased. “You’re supposed to let
Draco grabs the back of Harry’s neck and kisses him hard enough to push Harry down into the sofa cushions. When Draco pulls away, he’s bright pink and blinking hard.
“I know the bond wasn’t what either of us wanted.” Draco is talking in a rush, as though he’s been holding all these words right behind his teeth for weeks. “I know it isn’t easy, I know I’m not easy to be around, but I don’t have anything to go back to. You– you–” Draco laughs humorlessly, tilting his head back. “You’re impossible not to like, did you know?” At Harry’s silence, Draco keeps talking. “You said you would take care of me, and you did. You still are. I thought…”
“I know.” Harry pulls the sheets down and then back over Draco’s body before pulling Draco to him. “You just don’t say it that much, so it feels pretty special when you do.”
“Give me a colour,” Harry says firmly. Demanding it is a compromise– the single time Draco had complained about how asking for permission ruins the feeling of saying
The next day Draco Owls with a pointed request for Harry not to make dinner, refusing to explain why, which is how Harry ends up pleasantly wine drunk and crammed into a small booth at a cozy Italian restaurant, transfixed by Draco’s hands as he talks animatedly. It’s then that Harry connects the dots, remembering how methodical and single minded Draco is when he’s serious about something, and it crashes over him like a wave.
,” Harry snaps, then keeps his hand pressed there, as he fucks Draco so hard he nearly doesn’t feel the pleasure of it until Draco comes untouched with a muffled shout, tightening around Harry, and Harry’s orgasm hits out of nowhere. He bites so hard on Draco’s exposed shoulder that he tastes blood, and Draco
“I’m fucked up too,” Harry murmurs, echoing Draco’s own words. “I just want you.” He’s never said it so plainly before– Draco’s never let him– but he knows it all the way to his bones. He wants to hold onto Draco, through sex and nightmares and dawnbreak. He wants to keep Draco warm.
“Distress beacon? I told you to turn that receptor off. I’m not doing any more damsel in distress situations.”
“This is Potter on the Hedwig answering your distress beacon,” they say, in a clipped tone that makes me think that’s a standard message. For the thirtieth time today, I wish I could go back in time and kick myself, and maybe throw a starship manual at past-me’s proud head.
, he tells himself, surrounded by Harry and the blue walls of his own kitchen. Harry wants him. Harry is kissing him.
The sound Harry makes when Draco’s lips meet his is like nothing Draco has ever heard, and he tucks it right into his heart for later, when his world will come crashing down around him. Harry’s mouth is so much softer than Draco expected, and
“I was serious about the ways strangers usually spend their time on my ship. I thought I could turn you in, but you’re just a person. As soon as I knew you as a person I couldn’t do it. My moral compass doesn’t always point true north,” I say, slinging my most charming smile at him, and he relaxes slightly. “But I’m also not that callous. If it was a kidnapping, it’d be a different story. But if you left of your own volition–”
“No,” Harry says, suddenly soft. “I think you’re just very good at denying yourself things you want.”
“ Harry cries out as he goes boneless, his thighs shuddering around Draco’s ears, nearly tight enough to be uncomfortable. Draco works him through it until Harry pushes off with a groan, collapsing down next to Draco.
“No.” Draco somehow manages to sound sharp and tender at the same time. “No, no, you’re… may I touch you?”
“But…” Draco shakes his head a bit, finally remembering the Potions notes scattered around him. “I need to…” He gestures vaguely.
“Get your shit off my side of the room,” Draco snaps. A sock comes flying through the air, landing solidly on Harry’s face as he groggily blinks himself awake in the weak morning light.
Draco wills his hands not to shake as he reaches for the top button of his shirt. He’s still awestruck by Harry’s attention, particularly when they’re like this– Harry sprawled and confident, in charge, and Draco blissfully taken care of, waiting to be told what to do. Those green eyes are nearly burning through Draco’s skin as he reaches the second button and pushes open his collar slightly. Draco tilts his head, not daring to raise his gaze until he’s allowed. He slips the button out of the hole, then freezes at Harry’s low voice.
“Bet you can’t even fuck me right,” Draco pants, his gaze finally meeting Harry’s, steely and desperate. His entire face is blotchy pink, and Harry finally drops his hand from Draco’s neck, wrapping his arm around Draco’s back instead. There are dark marks left behind, a deep red that should probably worry Harry, but only makes him consider what Draco will look like bruised up. Will he hide the marks with a glamor? Will he look at his neck, and remember what Harry has done to him?
It’s a testament to how rattled Draco must be that she simply nods and climbs into the bed, not bothering to tell Harry that nightmares don’t come through doors. But Harry is out of her element, and she’s just doing the best she can. She slides in beside Draco, her heart hammering in her chest.
“She just said ‘you’re right, I’ll get Atkins on it.’ Then she waved me out of her office! Just like that!”
“The lights make you look like an angel,” Harry murmurs, and Draco melts against his side. Harry snorts, then grabs onto his wrist, pulling him out the door and all the way to the Apparition point.
“C’mon,” Harry says quietly, guiding Draco onto his back on the bed. At this point Draco lets his eyes fall shut, unable to keep looking at the radiance of Harry’s features: his beautiful mouth, his furrowed brow.
“I’m here.” With a flick of his fingers Harry turns down the lights entirely, throwing the room into darkness. Draco’s breath is damp on his collarbone and he presses a kiss to the soft strands of Draco’s hair. “Just… stay.”
“I want…” Harry starts, then clenches his fists, trying to find the words for how desperate he is to touch Draco. “My hands,” he says softly, and when he opens his eyes Draco is already there, leaning over Harry and biting down on his bottom lip in concentration as he unties Harry from the headboard. Harry looks down at Draco's body, still spattered with come; he always cleans Harry up immediately and forgets about himself. His cock hangs soft and pink between his legs, and it’s so intimate that Harry can’t look away until Draco presses a firm kiss to his forehead.
“Mhmm. If being used by you is what got your hands on me.” Draco shrugs, then starts to rub his hands in small circles on Harry’s back. “I know it’s rather… unhealthy.”
Draco hums, taking another drag. In his periphery, Harry is nearly crackling with energy, wearing that infernally attractive leather jacket and dark jeans. His curls are short, spilling right over his forehead, vastly different from the shoulder length ringlets Draco used to sink his fingers into.
, just like Draco asked him to, hard and unrelenting and all-encompassing. He thrusts into Draco in short, powerful motions, and Draco can’t do anything but dig his fingers in Harry’s shoulders and try to cling to some semblance of coherent thought. He hears someone whimper, then realizes it’s
Poured out underneath my thighs, Draco looks like starlight made human. His pink lips are parted, and his breathing is shallow as he looks up at me. Stars, I’m going to make this good for him.
anymore. But Harry is his friend, and his roommate of less than two days. He needs to try harder not to be so gruff.
“Answer the comm,” I tell Hedwig, my voice rough. One of my hands flies across the console, checking our fuel levels and steering us towards the Swan’s coordinates; the other hand grabs blindly for my thigh holster. If this bloke tries to hurt me, I’m throwing him right out into space, units be damned.
“Let me bask in the afterglow,” Harry protests, but he slides out of Draco slowly, smoothing a hand down Draco’s side. He slides off the bed and pads to the bathroom to wash the strap-on; Draco grabs blindly for his wand and cleans up the bed, forgoing the come smeared on his stomach because he knows Harry will be back soon.
A sharp, insistent rapping drags Harry from his doze. He blearily looks at the telly flickering across the room, then heaves himself off the sofa.
“Shut up.” Draco rolls onto his back again, searching the floor for any article of clothing. Harry sticks his tongue out but sits up, scrubbing a hand through his curls and making them even wilder than before. Draco throws him the red sweater and his boxers before finding his own pants and choosing to wrap the long-discarded blanket around his shoulder in lieu of a top. They end up sitting side by side, Harry peppering soft kisses to Draco’s exposed neck.
me to take you, to claim your pretty arse.” Draco kicks his feet as much as he can and lands a blow to Harry’s ribs that leaves Harry panting with the pain and frantically turned on. He slams two fingers into Draco and fists the other in Draco’s hair, flipping him onto his stomach. Draco sinks his teeth into Harry’s arm, making Harry crook his fingers painfully hard inside Draco.
“I don’t know! I don’t know where I’m going!” I exclaim, any semblance of calm shattered, because I. Don’t. Know. My plans ended with making it off Scorpius and into space in one piece. Obviously, I regret that now, but I was desperate. I
“Next time, serious conversations are happening before my cock is inside you,” Harry pants when they break apart, because now that his worry is gone he might simply go up in flames from how aroused he is. “Fuck, Draco.”
“Seems like you don’t need it,” Draco retorts, but his voice is distant, awestruck. “Stars, you’re attractive. How is your cock so pink? And how are your thighs so damn strong?”
He just looks so lost, sitting in the chair with his fingers twisting around themselves. It’s obvious that he usually keeps his guard up– it comes across on his sharp tongue– but his facade keeps splintering and his panic spills through.
“I don’t think I will.” Harry neatly strips his shirt off as Draco tugs at his restraints again and huffs in displeasure. He’s had a plug in his arse for hours. He wants to be
Something stricken flashes across Harry’s face and then his lips are an inch away from Draco’s, warm breath skating across Draco’s cheek. “Let me kiss you,” Harry says, his voice rough. “I thought we had time– I thought I had time to convince you to feel the same– god, I– just this once. Please. Let me kiss you.”
“It’s just, this hasn’t actually been that bad,” Harry continues, painfully sincere, and it cuts Draco right to the quick. It hasn’t been
“Shhh,” Harry says, even as he thrusts so sharply Draco sees stars. Harry takes one hand off of Draco’s hip and places it flat on the mattress above Draco’s shoulder, giving himself leverage.
“I bet you wank thinking of my Dark Mark. Do you touch yourself and think of me torturing people? Do you think of me with– with my bloody hands, and how you want to
“At least let me clean you up,” Harry says, holding up the flannel in his hand. Draco wavers, thinking of Harry’s gentle touch across his skin, and maybe– no.
“Draco,” I say, my tone dropping into sincerity. He stops laughing but a smile still plays around the edge of his lips, and I kiss his knuckles.
“I…” Harry swallows hard, the glowing leyline still held in his bare palm. This close, it’s almost impossible to look at directly; Draco’s eyes slide away every time he tries.
“Potter,” Draco says, and there’s a distant echo of humor in his tone. “I’ve wanted a lot of things in my life, but very rarely have I wanted for you to leave me alone.”
Harry searches Draco’s face for a long moment, then his eyes go softer. A bit sadder. “No, you don’t.”
Soft knit fabric slides through Harry’s hands as he shoves his hands underneath Draco’s jumper and pushes his boyfriend up against the entryway wall, pressing his lips to Draco’s fluttering pulse, marveling at the tiny, frantic sounds spilling from Draco’s mouth as though Draco can’t help it; beneath Harry, Draco bucks his hips up, grabbing onto Harry’s belt loops and pulling him impossibly closer, until their bodies are one line, one vivid creature, and then Draco’s hands are in Harry’s hair and–
Harry keeps his eyes on Draco as he kneels to the ground, letting the leyline shimmer across the grass before dissolving into nothing. He moves towards Draco, shaky on his feet but holding his gaze steady.
“So,” Draco says, but it comes out on a sob and he closes his mouth again. Moving very slowly, as though to not startle Draco, Harry lifts his hand and cradles Draco’s cheek, wiping away a tear with his thumb.
“You’re welcome,” Harry says into Draco’s hair. In that moment, Draco’s newfound understanding of his own feelings shifts into something that feels a lot like resolve. He doesn’t know if Harry feels this way too, if he could even feel that way about Draco, but Draco can’t simply sit idle with this feeling. Not when Harry is so important. Not when Harry deserves to have someone make caring gestures for him, too.
. This shouldn’t be so nerve-wracking. “I was wondering if you wanted– to come to the pub on Friday? With me and Hermione. Hermione and I.” Harry smiles sheepishly, but it falls away as Draco’s eyes widen.
“Are you gonna admit you’re ticklish?” Harry asks, his cheeks flushed with the force of his own smile, and Draco tries to grab his wandering hands unsuccessfully.
“Wait–” Draco starts, but Harry’s already sliding off his body and buckling the cuffs onto his feet, tying them down to the footboard until Draco is completely spread out, unable to move. He can see his own cock jutting at an obscene angle and dripping precome onto his stomach. Harry slides off the bed entirely, moving to stand at the foot and survey his work.
“You’re lucky you can get hard again so quickly.” Harry snorts. “Imagine if I could come like three times but you couldn’t. You’d feel so left out.”
” I jerk underneath him as he works three fingers in and hits my prostate, pleasure shooting down through my thighs, and I pant, trying to remember what I was asking. “With just the friction on your cock?”
Draco tips his head down to meet Harry’s gaze, his playful exasperation melting away to something more serious. For a moment he just worries his bottom lip between his teeth, and Harry nearly has to look away, the small motion making something unravel in his chest. “I have to prove that I can do something on my own, you know? I have to prove that the Malfoy name isn’t completely useless.” Draco scowls down at his salad, and Harry feels bad for asking.
it, but I can’t stop. There’s too much shoved down in my mind that’s spilling out now: my parent’s conditional love, my betrothal (surely broken now), the weight of wearing an emotional mask day in and day out. Harry is a warmth next to me, his hand soothing on my back, and embarrassment prickles under my skin.
, Draco had requested earlier, so now his eyes go wide and he licks his lips before seeming to remember he’s supposed to be putting up a fight. He thrashes, managing to send Harry careening to the side of the bed before he can get one of the cuffs around Draco’s wrist, holding tight to the length of chain attached.
, I don’t know. If you don’t feel the same, obviously I’ll respect that, we only have two days to reach Catchpole anyways and then you don’t need to have anything to do with me after–”
“I didn’t stop,” Harry murmurs, and Draco doesn’t understand, his entire mind consumed by desperate heat.
Immediately Harry is frozen, hot panic spilling through his chest. He’s been with Draco over a year and sure, things aren’t always perfect, but that’s normal; overall he feels like this is right and good and where he’s supposed to be, and if Draco breaks up with him now Harry won’t get to stick his cold toes underneath Draco’s thighs on the couch anymore and fuck he can’t
“How much time.” Harry doesn’t ask it like a question. Starting, Draco stares at the takeout containers on his desk, fragrant and steaming.
about you. Someone who– who loves that you love to talk, and knows that you don’t enjoy action movies, and wants to hug you back all the time. Who pays attention to you. You just deserve so much.”
“Uh-huh,” he pants, gazing up at me with bright eyes. I’m barely touching him, my fingers teasing under the band of his boxers, but he writhes between my thighs. I grind down against him, gasping at the hardness of his cock through the fabric of his pants. My pants, actually.
, so Draco presses himself up on his toes, matching Harry’s intensity. When they break away Draco slides his hands down to clutch the back of Harry’s neck, leaving dark soot streaks in the wake of his palms.
.” Harry moves across the room, taking Draco’s hand in his and kissing each of his fingers with a loud
“Darling?” Draco says, and his hands come up to Harry’s hips now. His voice has a new quality to it, and Harry closes his eyes again. “Darling,” Draco repeats. “You’re shaking. Shh. I’m right here. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Draco,” Harry interrupts, his voice low and amused. “Look at me. Do you think I’m not enjoying myself?” The insistent thrust of his fingers stops and he simply holds them inside me, giving me a chance to catch my breath and open my eyes to look up at him; I don’t remember closing them. My vision is consumed by Harry, his body eclipsing the lights and his smile impossibly bright. I loosen my fingers and run my hands through his wild hair, taking in the deep flush on his cheeks along with the way his chest moves as he breathes. I trail my fingertips along the scars on his chest and he shivers before pressing a kiss to my forehead, then my temple. “I know you can’t see it, but I’m so hard right now. Taking you apart turns me on, baby. I am absolutely enjoying myself.”
“I’m an evil Death Eater,” Draco says flatly. He seems to resign himself to this floor conversation, leaning back against the dresser with a wince. “I don’t think you actually care about my motives. I gave you an excuse to–” Draco waves vaguely at his neck, the purpling fingerprints there. “You’re welcome.”
“Excuse me?” He blinks, somehow looking surprised and offended simultaneously. “I think we both know I’m done trying to fly ships.”
“It’s just a glamour. Don’t you know me? I thought you would know me. Draco. I want you to know me.”
“Status, Hedwig?” I ask, listening to the sounds of Draco’s shuffling feet as he emerges from our sleeping quarters.
Harry slows the thrust of his finger, hesitant, and Draco looks up to find Harry gazing at him. “Oh, Potter, no, I didn’t mean–
“Alright, baby?” Harry asks. He threads his hands through Draco’s hair, sliding out the hair tie so that their scalp won’t get sore from the ponytail. Draco wiggles, rolling off to Harry’s side and stretching their legs out with a soft sound.
“Hmm.” Draco shifts as Harry gets back on the bed on all fours above Draco, like the first time. The deep blue length of his dick hangs heavy between his legs, thick and long–
It eats you up from your toes to your lungs. Letters unsent and ripped apart, glancing across a coffee shop and seeing vacant grey eyes in an unfamiliar face, following him home, hoping he’s okay, hoping he’s happy, without you, without you. You were only ever friends. He gave you his heart regardless, sun-soaked golden magic flooding your veins, you just didn’t know it for what it was.
“Yes, your blood slowly transforming into pure Dark Magic will do that to you.” Draco’s eyes are too big for his face, and Harry exhales when Draco closes them to savor the soup. “Mm, this is good.”
much praise and Harry shuts down, overwhelmed, so instead he eases into it. At least, whenever he’s still coherent, which generally is only a small window of time before Harry has his cock up Draco’s arse. By then, Draco has forgotten how to think.
, yeah, that’s it, I knew you were just waiting to use that slag mouth no matter how much you said no,
“I– I like you.” As soon as Harry states it, he knows it's true. Months of happiness and that fluttery feeling in his stomach suddenly make sense, clicking into focus. “
“I know. I know it’s– I know we still don’t know each other as well as we could, and maybe I’m wanting too much too fast, even though you kissed me back, and I don’t mind waiting for– for anything, but you
“Wait.” Draco grabs Harry’s hand, pressing a firm kiss to the back of it. “I love you too, Harry Potter.”
,” Harry growls, pressing Draco further into the mattress. He’s fully clothed and straddling Draco’s waist while Draco squirms, naked and belly-down, on the sheets.
“Your hands.” Harry laughs, a little manic, feeling as though there’s magic prickling right under his skin. “Your fucking hands. They’re never still when you talk, it’s incredible.”
“She wished to be human. She had spent so long looking down on them that she wanted to experience the things they did, love and– and loss, and joy. Because the moon loved her daughters, but it was an infinite love, one with no stakes, you know? So even though the moon didn’t want her daughter to go, she loved her, and agreed. She poured her moonbeam daughter into a human form, with pale skin and silver eyes and delicate hands, and she kissed her daughter on the forehead, ensuring her beauty would never fade.”
“Who the fuck did this to you?” he asks, low in his throat. Draco flinches back into the couch cushion, finally turning to Harry with wide eyes, and Harry forces himself to take a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I’m not mad at you. Draco, I just…” Harry reaches out to touch the skin of Draco’s cheek, right under the bruise. Draco makes a soft whining sound but doesn’t pull away. “Please.”
“Hey,” Harry murmurs, pulling away from me after what could’ve been seconds or hours. Our foreheads rest together, and I still can’t see Harry in the darkness, just stars, but I can feel every line of his body under my hands. “I’m–” He huffs a soft, small laugh, nearly incredulous. “Hi.”
“To sleep,” Harry says before immediately flushing hot with panic. “I– I just wanted to sleep next to you.”
“No.” Harry tries to back out of the circle of Draco's arms, but Draco holds fast. “What? No. I have to– they need me to do this.”
He also might be my first actual friend, which is a sweet concept, until I remember that I also want to climb him like a fucking tree. Eight days in space with the fittest man in the universe has made me
“Harry,” Draco says slowly, and Harry notices the end of the toaster cord clutched in his pale fingers. “I think the electricity bit me.”
Draco turns, meeting Harry’s eyes for what must be the first time since they left the house, if the way his chest goes tight is any indication. Harry looks like he always does– long, messy curls pulled up in a bun, the row of gold hoops up his ear glinting in the light, his eyes bright behind his glasses. He’s clean-shaven, but there’s a shadow along the dip of his jaw that Draco has to pull his eyes away from.
come back to, because you can’t have a discussion like an adult?” As he talks Harry strides closer and Draco scrambles back, the color draining from his face. There are dark smudges under his eyes, and all the fight drains out of Harry immediately.
“Okay,” Harry says soothingly. In the wake of Draco’s panic he’s feeling much calmer, knowing they’ve both been unsettled even though for different reasons. “Okay, okay. We’re not breaking up and we’re moving in together. Anything I missed?”
Later, after lurking in the background of the most uncomfortable break-up he’s ever witnessed, Harry holds Draco’s fingers gently in his own and rubs a healing potion across his split knuckles. They’re sitting on the couch, and Draco’s wearing his pajamas, looking pale and ruffled.
The dim Eighth Year common room comes into view as Draco rubs away the grittiness of his eyes. Harry’s right in front of him, blinking owlishly behind his glasses.

Draco, with every wretched stitch of his being, and this thing between them is so new and fragile that he’s terrified of shattering it, but he can’t
“You know how you have an extra room?” Hermione rolls her eyes, somehow managing to make the action fond, and Harry grins back at her. “And how you’re so good at shrinking charms? Well…”
Draco murmurs softly the whole time, too low for Harry to fully comprehend, snatches of words such as
“Yes.” Harry kisses Draco’s cheek tenderly once, and then again. “But we work for this. Every morning I wake up and I choose to be here in bed with you. I choose to make you tea and hold your hand and curl up in your lap at the end of the day.”
Being married to Harry Potter mostly goes like this: languid mornings in bed, wine-sweet kisses over dinner, tripping over boots in the hallway no matter how many times Draco insists Harry use the shoe rack,
“No, it was just words,” Draco whispers. He closes his eyes as Harry presses his thumbs against Draco’s bottom lip.
“You’re going to have to tell Hermione,” Draco says softly, and Harry goes stiff before slumping against Draco.
“Bonded like your magical cores are tied together.” The Mediwitch– Lila, her name badge says– doesn’t even look up at them, as though this is a commonplace problem, and Draco lets the tiniest flame of hope flicker in his chest. “We’ve never seen anything like this particular bond, so all we can do is mitigate the effects until our Bond Specialists can determine a way to undo it,” she continues, and Draco blanches.
“Bleh,” I cough, sticking my tongue out. Draco mumbles something incoherent and rolls closer to me, his nose pressing against my shoulder, but he doesn’t wake up. I’ve learned a lot about Draco in the time he’s been on my ship– coexisting in a small space does that. He hates coffee unless it’s from the Outer Colonies, but he’ll drink any kind of tea, even the weird shit Ron gives me every year that I don’t have the heart to refuse. Every morning Draco brushes his hair for at least twenty minutes, the long silvery strands rippling down his back like a ribbon, a sharp contrast to the tangled locks that somehow find their way to my face every morning. He hasn’t killed me yet, and I haven’t killed him, so I’m counting him as a friend. Even if he gets sharper the more comfortable he is: sharp wits, sharp smiles, sharp elbows he digs into my side when I make bad jokes.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, because what else is he supposed to say when he’s blinking back tears. “Fuck, Harry, you didn’t have to–”
, then, I’m not going back.” He springs into a standing position and I do too, in a more advantageous position with the doorway at my back. There’s a moment of silence as his eyes dart behind me and I hold my hands up in surrender.
, Harry. That’s fine.” Draco pulls his knees to his chest and wraps his arms around them. He started shivering at some point, but the thought of leaving the spot closest to Harry makes his chest feel horribly tight, so he stays. There’s shuffling behind the door, and then a soft
There’s Harry, a small figure standing in an open field with something painfully bright held in his hands. Draco moves closer, squinting a bit to make out what the light is. Even from this distance it pulses vaguely, and Draco moves closer since most of Harry’s back is to him. The light seems almost like a rope, lifted from the ground and cradled in Harry’s hand. As Draco watches, the light pulses brighter and something in the ground under Draco’s feet
“Shh,” Harry tells him, straddling Draco’s bare waist. “I’m just afraid of hurting you. I’m always afraid of hurting you.”
“Here, you get in first.” Harry turns down the covers more, watching Draco the whole time. “If I sleep closer to the door I can keep you safe.”
Harry smacks Draco’s arse, quick and light; Draco jerks and drops his face down onto the pillow. “Brat,” Harry tells him again, unreasonably fond, and Draco just laughs, so joyfully bright even muffled by the sheets.
“Stop,” Draco protests weakly; his fight nearly always starts to crack as soon as Harry’s cock is in him. “Harry, Harry.”
“Harry,” Draco murmurs softly, and Harry rolls over immediately, draping an arm over Draco’s waist, rucking up his shirt to reach bare skin. Draco sighs, content.
“Fuck,” Harry whispers, pressing a hand to Draco’s cheek, already starting to pull out. This doesn’t happen. This is different than Draco blinking away tears after coming, this is– sobbing. “Fuck, I’m so sorry, I’m so–”
“Ughhh. Don’t be responsible right now.” Draco waves a vague hand towards me and I lie back down on the bed fully. “You just shagged the life out of me. I deserve rest.”
There’s a moment at dinner where Draco reaches out and Harry goes completely still, but she just lightly touches the side of Harry’s head, where wispy curls have sprung loose from the braid.
“Shut up,” Harry tells him, shifting so he’s propped up on his elbow over Draco’s back, his cock pressed down into the crease of Draco’s arse. As soon as the material of Harry’s t-shirt meets Draco’s back, Draco starts writhing harder than he has all night, fighting against Harry’s weight on him. With his hands behind his back he can’t do much, and Harry shushes him even as Draco cranes his head around and bites down hard onto Harry’s forearm. Harry drops his weight fully onto Draco and bites down on his shoulder just as hard, yanking on the chain until Draco wails and stops moving long enough for Harry to aim his cock and slide into Draco in one smooth motion.
, good for you. And you for him. But if you cut it off before anything even happens there’s not even a chance.”
“No!” Draco lunges, catching Harry’s face in his hands and pushing both of them further into the room. “No, no, my mistake was pretending I
“Have I told you that you look like a ghost in your nightgown?” Harry asks sleepily, making a small discontent sound when Draco cranes her head around.
The Draco that isn’t you smiles, a gash of teeth. How did they get your face so accurate? Deep under-eye circles and the small mole beside your left eye. Even you had forgotten this detail. Avoiding mirrors while out of glamour is muscle memory now.
rejecting me but then deciding I’m not worth the effort, after you’ve already ruined me with your affection. Or you not rejecting me, and continuing not to reject me, even though I’m nowhere near good enough for you. Don’t tell Pansy I said that. I’m also afraid of the concept of loneliness as a whole and I get rather worked up about–”
“Darling,” Harry murmurs as he slides his cock out of Draco, never fully moving away. He bundles Draco in his arms, uncaring of the sticky mess underneath Draco’s stomach. “Darling, my sweetheart, you did so good. You were so good for me.” Draco’s forehead lolls against Harry’s shoulder but he’s blinking, the dazed look in his eyes slowly melting away.
,” Draco says drily. “But please remember I am, in your eloquent words, ‘a planet-raised priss who thought he’d just waltz out into space with nothing but toddler-level ship knowledge and a rich-person ferrying vessel’.”
“What did you mean, earlier?” Harry asks, keeping his voice low. “That I’m just as bad as everyone else.”
Pepper chirps from underneath the kitchen chair, and Harry scoops a hand down to bring her into his lap. Her small body fits easily on his thighs, and he scratches absentmindedly through her spotted fur.
“Hm, what’s north?” Harry asks, glancing away from the road to Draco’s profile. The large paper map spread out across Draco’s thighs crinkles as he shifts.
so many times that Draco comes hard enough to gather tears in the corner of his eyes, sticking in his lashes. He already knows he likes to be complimented, or praised, or
“Oh, hey,” Harry says casually from the couch as soon as Draco Apparates into their living room, but Draco barely even registers the fact that Harry has a hand down his own jeans before he slams into Harry’s lap, kissing him with too much teeth.
“Harry,” Draco says, over and over again in her softest voice, and Harry swallows down her own name like air.
“Wanna sleep, please,” Draco says muzzily. Harry snorts, then presses a kiss to the top of Draco’s head. Their hair is everywhere, silky-smooth across Harry’s shoulder and neck. Harry wandlessly cleans them up; it’s not perfect, but he can get Draco into the bath tomorrow.
Which is how he ended up here, this minute, on Harry’s surprisingly soft sheets, with a Sobering Potion down his throat and Harry’s slick finger working its way methodically into his arse.
“You feel like home,” Draco says quietly, and Harry drops his head onto Draco’s shoulder, breathless.
“I respect you,” he murmurs, eyes boring into yours. Breathe. Breathe. Something is cracking open in your heart.
“So considerate.” Moving his body up mine, Harry presses a surprisingly chaste kiss to my lips. “Sometimes I do, sometimes I don’t. But we can worry about that later, right
“Alright,” Harry says, his voice curving strangely around the vowels, and I wonder at his accent for a moment. “Convince me to take you where you’re going.”
,” he moans, his voice shuddering as Harry gently blows air across his hole. “Get on with it, then.”
“That sounds good.” Draco shifts across the small bathroom, leaning on his hands and knees over Harry. Harry straightens his legs out so Draco can get closer and meets the kiss head-on, holding Draco’s jaw in his hands.
“We should sleep,” Harry says, trying to keep her voice steady. Draco came in here with nightmares, and Harry should give her time and space and tenderness.
“I wish I knew how to braid, so I could braid your hair,” Harry says without meaning to. Draco’s fingertips flutter across Harry’s back for a moment, light as air. When she doesn’t reply Harry just shrugs, reaching up to feel the neat lines of a French braid. “This is nice.”
“Bloody hell,” Harry exclaims, staring out of the window as Draco curses behind him. He turns, arms already outstretched to take the unwieldy box from Draco. “Good thing we have the Floo, right?” Draco shoots him a look from under soot-covered brows, and Harry laughs. “How many more boxes do you have?”
“I’m not going to kiss you,” Harry says, and Draco jerks back, cracking his head against the dresser. Harry leans away, meeting Draco’s frantic gaze. As he watches, Draco’s face shutters, becoming cold and stiff.
“Everything’s good,” I affirm, then turn towards him, hoping my smile comes across as normal. “You ever been on a ship with no grav?”
“Fine,” Draco says, trailing further into his tiny studio flat. His bed takes up an alcove off to the side, and he flops down on it, already shimmying out of his pyjama pants.
The house itself had shown no signs of curse damage, despite the many cursed artifacts it held. Draco had moved through first, since his detection spells were stronger than Harry’s, pointing out anything with a Dark Magic reading. Harry, strongest at protective magic, placed delicate yet impenetrable shields over each object before sliding them into the heavy crate he carried. They had gone through the whole house with no incidents, which is something Draco always feels pleased about, even though he’s rarely had any major accidents happen since Harry became his Cursebreaking partner two years ago. They’re a good team.
Draco nods, his pulse already quickening in anticipation, because he knows what comes after this. Harry is the one who initially insisted on a pattern of questions, but it soothes Draco too– he has the chance to think about what he wants. And right now, he wants it all. “Yes.”
“Come on, then.” Harry kisses Draco’s temple, seeing straight through his husband's sarcasm to the genuine need for comfort underneath. “I guess you can come with me to the bathroom then. But the journey will be
“Let me– let me kiss you,” Harry says quietly, his eyes darting across Draco’s face. “Fuck, I thought you wouldn’t ever feel the same, I– Draco please–”
.” Harry’s eyes get wide, and he sways back towards Draco, just a bit. “I thought I was just a distraction for you. Just something in between real relationships. I– I didn’t know. You never said.”
Harry doesn’t slow his pace but he drops to his elbow and presses an open-mouthed kiss to Draco’s jaw, then his mouth. Every nerve in Draco’s body is on fire, but he kisses back as best can, held together by Harry’s hands and heat until Harry’s dick brushes his prostate and Draco shouts right into Harry’s mouth.
,” Draco whines, and Harry jolts, because Draco never says his name during sex. Not once. “Harry, please, I want–
,” Harry says, fiercer than before, and Draco turns around to press his palm to the door. Their sex life, while passionate and fun and constant, has been rather vanilla. He just assumed that’s what Harry wanted. He wants to be so good for Harry, to be
“Is that good?” Draco asks from behind my shoulder, his voice warm and curious the way it always is after sleep, and I stare out at the stars blindly as it hits me right in the chest.
“I don’t want this,” Draco says, very softly, and Harry looks up. Draco is motionless on the bed, his arms pulled back, the chain still taut and held in Harry’s hand. His wedding band glints gold in the light of their bedroom. There’s always a moment Draco goes quiet like this, docile and pliant, but Harry knows what comes next.
“Apparition sucks after an international Portkey.” Harry keeps his eyes on the pools of streetlight splashed across the dark road; if he looks over towards Draco the terrifying knot of his feelings will overwhelm him.
“Draco,” I supply, then immediately remember I’m supposed to to be on the run. “But my friends uh– call me–”
“Draco, I was destined to die and you were raised with the expectation to uphold Pureblood ideologies and produce heirs. If we– if we stayed on our course, we’d be… going in different directions, never touching.”
“Shut up,” Harry grumbles, but he can’t help smiling. All of his friends are fully aware that Harry spends most of his time volunteering at the closest animal shelter, but they still love ribbing him about his choices. “Someone brought in a whole litter of kittens today with no mom. They’re so small and every single one was completely black. So I did a lot of prep for their kennel, making it cozy for them. You should’ve seen Margot, the director, she’s so soft over kittens…” The conversation unspools easily, with Draco interrupting every so often, and before either of them realize it their plates are empty.
Where anger used to sit in Harry’s chest there’s now a raw, pulsing panic. He’s responsible for the pain his hands have caused. He’s responsible for fixing this.
feel like home,” Draco says again, his eyes bright as he crooks a smile at Harry. “I really didn’t know. That you felt the same.”
After checking the rearview mirror and seeing no other cars, Harry pulls their car over to the shoulder of the road, bumping along the gravel until grinding to a full halt. Draco stares at him.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco whispers, and he’s trembling now right alongside Harry. The fact that Draco didn’t respond with something snappy is deeply indicative of how shaken up he is, so Harry reaches out and rubs small circles into Draco’s hips.
I clench my hands on my knees, trying to breathe. Panic mixes with adrenaline and, embarrassingly, arousal in my gut. This is
“I’m not easy to hold onto,” Draco says almost apologetically, tucking himself closer to Harry, and for a brief moment Harry can’t breathe because Draco is
,” I say after swallowing down half the cup. Harry has pulled me up into a half-sitting position and is settled next to me, our shoulders bumping. “I like that.”
He’s still crying, little hiccup sobs. Reach down, smooth your thumbs over his cheekbones. Press a kiss to his forehead, return the tentative one he presses to your lips. A first kiss. A promise. Remind yourself what it means to be alive.
“It doesn’t feel like anything I’ve ever felt before,” he whispers, fear written across his features. “I don’t know if I can–”
“Looking at you tied down for me is all the foreplay I need,” Harry says smugly, rolling his hips, and Draco squeezes his eyes shut behind the blindfold because Harry is
