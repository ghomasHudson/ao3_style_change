"I should probably mention it was unintentional."
"Nope it's still asleep time."
The first thing Harry noticed about Draco was the two full sleeves of tattoos laced upon his arms, he hadn't seen them last time they met, they'd been covered by his leather jacket, but in his short sleeved scrubs they were fully visible. His left arm was covered in colourful blooming flowers that lead up into vines that wrapped around his dark mark and then trailed up into broken clocks and a gorgeous shattered hourglass, his right arm was covered in constellations that trailed up into beautiful coloured galaxies that blended perfectly into his pale skin, Harry was finding him more and more attractive with every new detail.
"Will you stay for the night?"
"Can it be awake time?"
"They're gonna be camping out at my apartment for the next two weeks."
“So?”
Draco had to stop these thoughts. Now! Because he was pretty sure Harry could feel how much Draco wanted
“Oh, we got our letter today,” Celia squealed. “Can we go to Diagon Alley tomorrow?”
“He didn’t? Huh. I thought he did,” Harry said frowning. “Well that’s good I guess. I’m rubbish at singing.”
Why couldn’t Potter be one of those people who, when you met them years later, suddenly looked hideous and nothing like you remembered them? Why couldn’t he have wrinkles all over his face or a lazy eye or a hunched back? Of course he had to waltz in here, looking even more attractive than he had in school. Why was the world so unfair?
Potter makes a dismissive gesture, which pisses Draco off more than if he had ignored him altogether.
“Ron! What are you doing?” Hermione demands.
Harry couldn’t tell if Draco was about to shout or laugh or cry. He was perfectly still as he gazed at Harry.
Draco did, his movements becoming more confident with every flip of his stomach and every thrust of Potter’s hips.
When Malfoy gave no reaction whatsoever, Harry moved his head to look at him. He had finally done it. Draco Malfoy was rendered speechless. Or was he shocked? Disgusted? Harry couldn’t tell.
“What—What was the question?” he whispers.
“Y—Yes,” he choked. Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Malfoy straightening himself up. Oh Merlin, now he was done for.
“Hey, leave my mother out of this.”
“‘I can drop to my knees, I can do whatever you want’,” Potter says in a high-pitched voice.
When he taps Harry’s bum twice, a new wave of arousal seizes him. His hand shoots down as quickly as if he was trying to catch the Snitch. He feels the gush of Malfoy’s exhale and he slowly starts to stroke him.
Draco stared at his hand that was suddenly covered by Harry’s. What was he doing? They usually only did this when they were alone! Were they really ready to make it official? Seriously? They hadn’t even talked about it!
“More colour on your face, you know?”
“Good, good, now hold it over the flask.”
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitches and his cheeks are tinged with a lovely shade of pink.
“If you have something to say, just say it!” Malfoy approached Terry, his hands on his hips.
“You didn’t even want to look at me! You turned me around so you wouldn’t have to see my face! That’s how disgusted you are by me! Who were you going to picture while you fucked me, huh? Wood? Weasley?”
As much fun as it was to watch Harry like this, Draco realised he had been sitting in the same position far too long. His left leg felt numb and his neck was beginning to hurt. He started shifting, causing the blanket to fall on the floor.
“As were you,” Draco says, his voice low and seductive. “It’s been a while since I‘ve licked frosting out of your belly button.”
Harry blinks. “What?”
Draco used to think he’s craving more glory, can’t get enough of it. But now… Potter’s hiding something; he’s trying to escape or forget or—
Harry shifts beside him and drops his hand into his lap.
Potter says nothing at first. When he does, his voice sounds more reserved than it did before. “What about, err—”
When he finally arrives on the seventh floor, he takes a deep breath. He has tried this many times before. This might turn out to be another failed attempt, but he has to try. He starts pacing back and forth in front of the blank wall he has visited so many times, concentrating hard.
had protected his heart from for almost as long as he can remember.
“If you really want me to leave…” Potter brought his free hand up to Draco’s face, and for a second, Draco thought he was going to touch him. But his fingers hovered inches away from his jaw, before he dropped his hand again. Draco almost felt disappointed. “But if you don’t want me to leave…”
Lowering his head, he started peppering Potter’s inner thigh with kisses, gently brushing his fingers against the inside of his knee. He noticed with great satisfaction that Potter’s breathing was becoming more shallow the nearer he moved to his cock. When he reached his groin, he decided to be a bit more experimental.
Harry blinks at him.
Potter shrugs. “Ron and I were always trying to get the other to fill out those bloody reports. It’s actually not that bad, having a partner who likes doing what I hate.”
want to distract you with my mouth. I want to rip those trousers off you and lick every inch of your body.”
“I’m sure he’ll be back soon,” she assures him with a pat on his back. “Why don’t you come to the library with us? It will take your mind off things.”
“Oh,” Harry said, wondering why he suddenly felt a tinge of disappointment. Then again, Malfoy was kind of a wanker, too, wasn’t he? At least in Harry’s opinion. Maybe he wasn’t asking the right questions. But what was he supposed to ask?
“What do people do in a situation like this? I mean… to get to know each other. Is it the same as in the Muggle world?”
Malfoy squints at him, as though he’s trying to decide if Harry is being earnest. “Alright,” he finally says. “We’ll do it tonight.”
“It’s okay. You do your thing with Luna. I don’t want to intrude.”
“I can’t believe you dragged me here and—”
Draco jumps at the sound of McGonagall’s voice. He knows she’s not his teacher anymore, but whenever she said his name like that, he knew he was in trouble.
Draco gapes at him. “
Feeling utterly unprepared for what’s about to come, Draco pushes his hips forward, his mouth falling open as he feels his tip slowly slipping inside.
“As if a whole afternoon with you isn’t enough,” Draco quipped. They both got up and Draco carefully put the koala down in one of the chairs.
“I am well aware, thank you,” Snape hisses. “He wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for me.”
Potter exhaled loudly and Draco could hear all the dread he must have been feeling.
“I did nothing of the sort,” Draco says.
“Malfoy, we—mmmpf!”
“I should have realised sooner that you’re too much of a softie to be a worthy nemesis.”
“You of all people do not want me to say this out loud, believe me,” Terry said unblinking. Malfoy scrutinised him and Harry noticed a strange expression flicker across his face. “Unless you want to explain why these boundaries don’t seem to apply to you. Especially-”
“Weasley was right, your beard is soft,” Malfoy murmured.
Draco makes it out of the castle just in time. He slows his steps as he approaches the hut, knowing he can’t avoid it, but really not looking forward to having to talk to Potter. His eyes dart around the room until he spots Potter sitting on the bed in a similar position as Draco had been before he left.
“M—Madam—”
But now, suddenly, what Draco has longed for seems to be within his reach. And he wants it. Desperately. But he can’t let hope cloud his senses. It’s foolish. It’s delusional. It can never happen. It will never happen. Because this, Draco lying in Potter’s arms, is just another demonstration of his helper syndrome. It doesn’t mean anything. Draco doesn’t mean anything to him. He’s nothing.
Draco has never been to the kitchens before, but Potter has, apparently. He leads the way through the Entrance Hall and down the stairs to some sort of basement without hesitation, and marches right up to a painting of a fruit bowl, hand outstretched. Draco watches, sceptically, as Potter does… something.
Feeling extremely wary but also exhausted, Harry scuffles into his room and slips under the covers. As expected, he doesn’t get a wink of sleep that night, tossing and turning instead, wondering what his former nemesis is doing in the other room.
“What the fuck did you just do?” Malfoy bellows. “You weren’t doing what I think you were doing, right?”
Potter shrugs. “He’s handsome. Who am I to turn him down?”
Harry snickered as he wrapped his arms around his boyfriend. He had to admit, he could get used to coming home to this. The candles, the rose petals, it was all kind of cute. Maybe now that they had talked about it, Draco would be more comfortable with these things. Maybe Harry would get more surprises like this in the future. On the other hand…
He feels Malfoy shift. If he had to guess, he’d say Malfoy just turned his back to him. Well, Harry won’t make it that easy for him. Shrugging to himself, he throws his right arm over Malfoy and snuggles up to him.
“What do you want?” he whispers, forcing himself to hold Draco’s gaze. It feels like they’re standing there for hours, until the other boy finally answers. He lets go of Harry’s arm and slowly traces the line of his jaw. Surprised by the tender touch, Harry closes his eyes and lets his head fall back. He shivers as Draco’s thumb brushes against his lower lip and it takes everything in him to withhold the whimper that’s threatening to spill out of him. Draco moves his hand lower, gently drawing a line down Harry’s throat.
“He’ll come around,” Potter says, his expression turning soft.
“Yes,” Harry sighs, his body immediately trembling in anticipation. Draco hesitates for a second and then, with a pleasant jolt, Harry feels his lips right underneath his ear. Instinctively, Harry’s hands find Draco’s hips, pulling him closer, pressing their bodies together. It’s exactly as thrilling as he remembers it.
Harry furrowed his brows. How come they all were so nonchalant about this stuff?
"Stone cold sober." He held up the empty potions vile.
"It's cute."
"Good sit on the backdoor steps I'll be out in just a sec." Harry did as he was instructed the cold air biting at his tan skin, he'd left his jacket at Ron's flat before they went out and the club had been warm but the April frost was nipping at his skin.
Saturn nodded shyly.
"I'm going to St. Mungo's." He announced to his cat.
"I like hearing your voice."
"We could do with getting this one out, he hasn't been out in years." Pansy poked her foot at her friend.
"Yeah, no."
"Tea?" Harry finally broke the tension.
"Just a tea please."
"Hi Saturn im Harry I'm gonna be looking after you is that okay?"
"Like you can go and all but you will have men hitting on you."
Draco dropped his head.
Draco was expecting a quiet Tuesday morning at work, Harry seemed to have other plans well they weren't exactly plans more happy accidents.
"I came out to Ron and Hermione." He mumbled quietly, wiping away a few more tears.
"You've had a thing for Harry Potter since forth year."
He pulled into the nearest drive through in serious need of some coffee.
"Keep an eye on him I don't trust him not to pull his own IV out." Harry nodded and Alex left to go fill out his paperwork.
"How do you know he's straight?" Pansy raised an eyebrow.
Drack scooped his sleeping son into his arms the boy fast asleep on his shoulder, stuffed dragon in his clutches.
Draco's cheeks turned even redder at the small 'x' next to Harry's text. He stopped himself quickly by chucking his phone on the sofa and running his fingers through Saturn's curls, the boy had fallen asleep on his chest about two minutes ago. After Saturn was born he'd made a promise, more to himself than anyone else, that he wouldn't get involved with anyone until Saturn was old enough to understand, but recent events were making the other side of the strict line he'd drawn look ever so enticing. Of course liking guys wasn't a new thing, he'd always kind of know he was gay, even when he'd started seeing Astoria he'd had his eyes mostly glued to Blaise and he'd been with guys in the past but it'd been year's since he'd actually gone out anywhere let alone got laid or had a partner, he was perfectly comfortable on his own. Maybe having a partner would have made things easier especially back in the old flat, managing rent and bills on a small server's wage was difficult and there were often nights where he went hungry so Saturn could eat or he'd go to sleep cold because they couldn't afford to pay for heating but after his grandmother, who he was surprised to learn was somehow alive and hauled up in France, kicked the bucket and his share of the Black family inheritance came in he had no need for a partner, it was just him and Saturn and that's how he liked it. He wasn't crossing that line no matter how tempting a certain Harry Potter made it look.
Draco scribbled his number on a pink post-it note and handed it to Harry.
Harry opened the door for Draco and Saturn standing at the doorstep with a sleeping Teddy.
"If you don't mind me asking, how old is he?" Harry was worried he'd crossed a line when Draco sighed gently.
"This not so legal Job, Sex work?"
"Hey can you watch the kids for twenty minutes while a have a shower." Draco asked.
"First of all I have not and secondly even if I did he's straight."
Saturn came running out to him.
"I can't hide from them forever."
"Andromeda is in Scotland from Friday for a week and well Ron is begging me to go out. Is there any chance you could take Teddy on Saturday night?"
"Ice cweam helps me to feel better." Saturn suggested before hopping down and waddling into the kitchen, walking back out a few minutes later with his cup of water and then disappearing back to his bedroom.
"Hey." Draco breathed out. Honestly Harry wasn't the last person he was expecting to see but he was pretty low on the list.
"Your son is a bloody angel." Harry mumbled resting his head on Draco's shoulder.
"Alex? What happened?"
"Yeah Alex told me."
"Okay."
"Well when you have a bad night you stay in my bed, and when I have a bad night I stay with you. Harry had a bad night so he's staying with me."
Harry rested his head on Draco's shoulder, long blond hair contrasting his own dark locks.
"No poppet daddy needs a bit more sleep."
"Saturn."
"Work alright?" Harry asked trying to make some form of small talk.
Draco's day only got busier as the hours ticked on, he was constantly rushing between departments covering patients for anything from small injuries to dark curse comas, when four o'clock rolled round he was more than ecstatic to throw on his jacket and floo to pick up Saturn who jumped into his arms as soon as he stepped out of the fireplace. It was around seven at night when Draco got a text alert on his phone, he was gently rocking Saturn to sleep when the alert had woken the child back up, he wanted to be annoyed at it but he found himself smiling when he realised it was from Harry.
Draco can’t imagine what it must be like, losing someone you’re that close to. His mind unhelpfully hisses at him that he does know. He lost his father, even if he isn’t dead. The man in the Janus Thickey Ward isn’t his father. Not really. But their relationship has always been complicated. If anyone would ask him if he was close to his father, he honestly wouldn’t know how to answer.
“I didn’t say that,” Draco interjects heatedly. “I didn’t say anything about torture.”
Draco frowns at his cup and Dumbledore sighs when he slowly shakes his head.
“Draco, you can’t hide in here forever. You’ve got to move on.”
As he levitated a bunch of bottles to the kitchen, his eyes fell on Draco who stood in front of the sofa. His face was set in deep concentration, while he silently mouthed the spell to get rid of all the shoe prints. Harry loved watching him like this. But the longer he stared, the more his body reacted to it. He could feel the hammering of his heart against his collarbone, not to mention the intense tingling on the back of his neck.
“You have to admit,” Teddy smiled, “he’s pretty cute.”
Draco was back at work after two weeks on paid leave, he worked Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday night and Friday giving him Thursday to sleep, Unfortunately for him Saturn had insisted that they go to the zoo next Thursday. Now Draco loved going out with his son, he practically cherished the time they spent together knowing that when he go older he'd wouldn't want to spend as much time with his Dad. Going to muggle places like the zoo was perfectly fine, they had potions to block accidental magic from the eyes of muggles, that included abilities like Teddy's. However, Draco had noticed a pattern recently, whenever Saturn wanted to do something big, like go to the zoo or go to the play farm he wanted to go with Teddy, which was fine but he liked to pick the weeks where Teddy was with Harry and well he couldn't handle the two children out in the big wide world so usually Harry would come along. For four year olds Teddy and Saturn were
The two got back to Harry's apartment around seven. Draco fell onto Harry's sofa rather ungracfully, Max started kneading at his leg before curling up on his lap and purring as Draco Scratched behind his ears.
"Hello Mrs Wilkins I'm Healer Malfoy, can you tell me what happened?"
"If you don't mind me asking, and you don't have to answer, what happend with Astoria?"
"You two were a thing?"
"Chatting to who?" It was Ron who spoke this time. Harry didn't have much of a desire to explain his newfound friendship with the former Slytherin, mildly concerned Ron might hex the blond. Harry loved his friends he really did but the thing he liked about Draco is he felt so natural, Ron was always ranting on about topics of the war glorifying their achievements and their bravery as if it wasn't the reason Harry didn't sleep at night or why he couldn't stand loud noises. Hermione was very textbook, she talked a lot as if she was reciting something she had read. She'd been adamant on dragging Harry out to the new muggle club She'd found.
"I do not have a thing for Harry Potter."
"A new friend?"
"I see you met Max." Harry stated pointed to the grey cat.
"Need a chat?"
"Harry, we play for the same team." Draco pulled down the neckline of his hoodie exposing his own tattoo. Part of him internally cheered, before knocking him back down again.
"If wasn't a great apartment but it was a roof, but I wasn't allowed to take my NEWTS so I couldn't really get a job in the wizarding world even if I did find someone willing to hire an ex Death Eater. So I worked every muggle job I could, Andromeda and my friends were amazing with helping out with Saturn but I still had to support us financially, I was a server, I worked in shops, pubs, basically anywhere I could, every job you can think of and sometimes when we really couldn't afford rent or the water was about to get shut off I worked less so legal jobs."
"Not many people know, he was a well kept secret for a while." Draco sipped his tea.
Draco took another drag, breathing out heavily.
Harry wasn't sure if he wanted to cry or throw up.
"You can go as soon as that IV finishes, you're on a fuck ton of pain killers right now."
"You too Harry."
"Perfect Timing, Harry you've met Pansy." He nodded towards his friend.
"Sap."
"How you haven't had a heart attack from that stuff I'll never know."
"Harry you know that's like a gay bar." Hermione pointed out.
"Today was really fun, thanks for inviting me." Harry said as they were leaving.
"I assumed so." Draco wiped his hands off with paper towels before unpacking the gauze.
This Chapter is slightly saucy, nothing graphic but just be aware
We do not support JK Rowling. A lot of hurt and a lot of comfort.
"Yeah it's been a while." Draco said quietly placing his son on the floor.
"Accident and emergency?"
"Then about two years ago they shut down those apartment's and we moved into this house, that was about the time I got my NEWTS finally, Beauxbatons let me do them and then I got my job at St Mungo's. Around that time my share of the Black family inheritance came in which to probably the horror of my ancestors I spent on Tattoos and a car and well now we're here."
"Not much to me really, I was an Auror for a while and now I just help out at the ministry occasionally."
extremely smart and were well aware that they chose the days Harry had Teddy but Saturn noticed Harry made Draco happy and well he thought that everyone should be happy. Since Saturn had practically decreed that he was not taking no for an answer especially as they had a red panda exhibition that week and well Draco did find red pandas extremely adorable he had agreed that if Saturn was on his best behaviour he would call Harry and ask if Teddy would go to the zoo with them.
Draco had been at work for about twenty minutes and he was already counting the hours until he could go home. He loved his job most of the time but for some god awful reason this particularly Tuesday morning had left half the staff off and the rest of them running round to frantically cover whatever areas they had training in. As he was leaving the dark magic and curses department his portkey pager buzzed in his shirt pocket. The pagers had been his own invention allowing healers to portkey straight to their patients instead of running through the hallways, at first the hospital had shunned his idea of adapted muggle technology but when the trial run had improved efficiency by over thirty percent they had become an essential piece of equipment and secured the blond a great promotion. He portkeyed to the main desk arriving with a familiar pop only to be greeted by an extremely familiar pair of green eyes.
"Perfect I'll see you Thursday."
Draco tied off the bandages.
He surveyed the man carefully, the brunette was only a few inches shorter than him but his shoulders were broader and he had gained more muscle since they were in school, he'd replaced his old glasses with a newer more fashionable pair with thick frames that suited him much better, all in all Draco found him ridiculously attractive.
"He's extremely polite albeit a little shy."
"I didn't know you were a car person." Harry commented strapping Teddy into his car seat.
Harry nodded.
"Teddy's my Godson I see him a lot."
Draco leaned his shoulder against Harry's, they were the exact same hight sat down.
"Hmm, once that's done you can go home."
The two stood in awkward silence as the boys ran back into the living room.
"So she's right, if clubs like that aren't you're thing what is your thing."
"Thanks a bunch."
Harry shuffled under the green duvet in his borrowed pyjamas, he felt the bed sink next to him and tattooed arms snake around his waist.
"It's fine, I made my choices and I'm the only one that can deal with the consequences of them."
"Evidently I disagree. I guess at the time I just felt like a shitty parent for not being able to give my son the best childhood."
"I bloody well can if you dissappear off the face of the earth." She ranted.
"You can't keep breaking into my Apartment Hermione, I'm a grown adult i can look after myself, besides I was with a friend."
This was a question Draco was less comfortable with, he felt Harry's head drop onto his shoulder.
"I can tell."
"Well you were at my trial, thank you for that by the way, I got very little from it. They locked down the Manor and the family accounts and while my friends got off lighter they weren't allowed to give anything to me, so me and Saturn moved into the Old Halfords apartment's, you know the really cheap ones where you pay for your utilities separately and if you don't they just cut you off."
"I did text you to say I was leaving the bar last night." He mumbled.
Harry put his tea down.
"For once Hermione can you not sound like you're reciting a bloody textbook." He snapped.
He turned to Harry again.
He offered Harry one, he declined but still breathed in the second hand smoke from Draco's chapped lips.
Draco smiled, taking another drag from his cigarette.
Draco sat next to him, thick hoodie over his old shirt, Harry felt the warmth of something drop onto his shoulders, it was the old leather jacket that had once belonged to his God Father.
"The lady who stunned me, she said something, I didn't hear it."
"So you like him but not me." Harry complained at his cat who gave him a meow in confirmation.
What neither of them expected was for Saturn to crawl up onto Harry's lap and give him a big hug and in all honesty Harry felt a lot better.
"You can stay here, I can go pick up your cat in the morning." Draco offered.
And with that he apperated back to Islington.
She gave a shirll shriek and raised her wand to him.
"I never knew." Harry said his voice evident with surprise.
"It's okay, it's just been us for a long time but we manage."
"Perfect, do you wanna come round around eleven?"
"Alex, great, can I go home now?"
"Daddy is it awake time yet?"
"Yep, he's sat next to me."
"Daddy, why is Harry in your bed?"
"You look tired." Harry commented sympathetically.
"Close your mouth you'll catch flies."
"I guess someone needs to hear about it, I don't really talk about it. As I said Blaise and I weren't exactly subtle, after Dumbledore was killed people started to notice and get suspicious so Me and Astoria devised a cover up, it was never meant to go far just a fake date to draw the attention away, she was in on the whole thing of course. One evening she was staying at mine and well it was the first evening without You know who staying underneath me so like the irresponsible sixteen and seventeen year olds we were, we got I won't say drunk but tipsy. I'll spare you the details but I have a four year old mini me sleeping upstairs so I think you can fill in the gaps."
“You really mean that?” Potter asked. The longer Draco stared at him, the more he found himself unable to speak. So he just nodded. The smile that was plastered on Potter’s face moments after made Draco’s heart jump repeatedly, as though it was doing a happy dance. It only intensified when Potter took his face in both hands and pulled him into a soft and slow kiss. Draco couldn’t help but let out a sigh.
Well, whatever was going on, Potter seemed to be having some kind of epiphany himself. His eyes were wide and glazed, his lips parted as though he was in shock.
“And I’ve come to the conclusion that—”
Draco stiffened. The obvious answer was No.
It’s almost dark outside when Potter comes shuffling through the door. Draco immediately averts his gaze.
“No,” Potter laughs. “I was just asking hypothetically.”
Connor nods sadly and stays rooted to the spot as Draco walks back to the Entrance Hall with Potter right behind him.
He should have known better. The koala slapped the shower head out of his hand with a loud squeak. Water was spraying everywhere.
“Shhh Hermione! Will you keep it down?” Harry chastises her.
Draco narrows his eyes, feeling his stomach churn uncomfortably.
Harry startles when someone suddenly clutches his shoulders.
The koala didn’t seem to be listening. Of course not. Instead, it kept staring at the picture. Draco sighed and let his head fall back. He wrinkled his nose when he caught a whiff of… Baxter.
“Just… move your finger or something,” Draco said.
“You did, didn’t you?” Harry says, leaning forward to examine Malfoy’s face more closely. It’s still blurry without his glasses.
“What do you mean ‘anymore’?” Weasley asks, narrowing his eyes.
“That was your great plan?” Draco can’t help but remark. “To die? And then what?”
“Students being attacked and… hearing voices.”
Harry is grateful to spend Christmas and New Year’s Eve at the Burrow, even though it is filled with as many tears as it is with laughter. Fred’s absence is taking its toll on everybody and Harry can’t imagine how that void could ever be filled. So as much as he enjoys spending time with the Weasleys, he’s also somewhat relieved to board the Hogwarts Express and be swamped with homework again. Who would have thought he’d ever be grateful for homework? But it takes his mind off all those awful things.
"Yes I do." Draco mumbled, he much preferred being on the other side.
"Sorry cold hands."
"Why don't you tell me what's gotten you so upset." He rubbed Harry's shoulder gently.
"I'll just get you to sign this off, you can take the dressings off in a day or two but just keep off it for a while and you've got an extra painkiller if you need it." He explained putting the clipboard in front of Harry to sign off.
"You had a child with Astoria but the Gay symbol tattooed on your chest and the fact you spent the entire of sixth year shagging Blaise leaves me to believe you're not exactly heterosexual mate."
"Harry I - Are you sure? I mean I've read about..."
He got out of the shower the cold bathroom air nipping at his skin as he dried it with a fluffy towel, he got dressed into his comfy jeans and an old t shirt and threw his damp hair up, he couldn't be bothered to dry it. As he left the bathroom he heard the faint sound of one of the boys crying he wanted to run towards the living room where the boys were playing but he hung back watching from a far when the crying stopped. He watched as if almost instinctively Harry picked up Saturn and rocked him in his arms like he was his own son. Draco smiled pressing his back against the wall out of sight from the three, he was never keen on letting people into Saturn's life, maybe he was selfish that way, wanting to keep his son in a bubble but just this once he didn't mind letting Harry play dad.
"Oh sod off."
"Shit, I need to get back to Saturn."
"Draco Malfoy don't you dare say you are any less than an amazing parent."
"Well St. Mungo's wasn't exactly on my to do list."
"Hey, you've got Teddy this week right?"
"Harry!"
"What are you doing?"
"You took a few stunning spells to the chest, I'm gonna give you a second to wake up while I get you a drink." Alex turned and left the room.
The old lady gripped her wand by her side, Draco was used to this, most patients with head injuries were apprehensive he just had to be a little more careful.
"And you know what gay guys can be like." Ron chimed in.
"Come on talk to me, what's gotten you so upset?" His voice was kind and gentle but careful not to pry at the brunette.
"Thanks."
"I'm sorry Harry but sometimes people think they're gay and they're not like it's a big thing, are you really sure?"
Harry laughed when Draco smacked her foot away from him.
"I dunno I want to say something to do with the war but all anyone ever talks about is the bloody war, it all Ron talks about."
"Something's happened" Draco stated.
"Mr Potter?"
"Giving me your number already?"
The boys were playing in the living room when Harry walked in, Teddy ran straight towards the brunette Saturn stayed back shyly.
The two got the boys ready to leave and walked out to where Draco usually parked. His car was a black sports car that had been magically extended to be able the fit the boys car seats in the back and it had an endless boot.
Draco shuffled his phone in his hand to type with one hand while still rocking Saturn.
"I know, but it won't feel like it forever."
Draco laughed slightly, saddend when Harry's hand left his cheek but less so when he returned his head to his shoulder. Draco wrapped his arm round Harry pulling him closer.
Harry scribbled his signature with his good hand.
He moved onto wrapping Harry's arm in a healing bandage.
"It's nothing to be ashamed of you know."
The four made it to the zoo successfully, first seeing some of the smaller animals the boys both very excited at the penguins who were waddling around their enclosure.
Saturn seemed content with that explanation and well Teddy was already out like a light. Onlookers would see the four and assume they were just a normal family and I guess in a way they were.
"Harry?"
Draco was running late. Extremely late. His shift at St. Mungo's started in less than an hour and Saturn was still in his pyjamas. Being a single parent had never been easy, Draco had known that since Astoria had died giving birth to their son 4 years ago but he'd never accounted for how much the war would take from him. Both his parents had been sentenced to Azkaban his father for twenty years his mother for six, he had narrowly escaped thanks to Harry's testimony at his trial, that was the last time he'd seen the Gryffndor. Malfoy Manor had been locked down until his mother would be released and they'd withheld most of the family fortunate to pay off war debts leaving Draco with no more than enough to rent a small one bedroom apartment. Since the war he had fought tooth and nail to get himself to where he was now. He'd worked many Jobs to keep their heads above the water some legal and some less so. The pair resided in Islington in Twelve Grimmauld place. The old house had been a gift from his Aunt Andromeda who he often babysat his younger cousin for. She'd been given the House by Harry who was far more content with his small London flat and was perfectly happy to give it up when Andromeda has mentioned her nephew was in need of a place although he hadn't quite put two and two together for who said nephew was. It'd taken a good week to clean the whole place out and another week to pry the screeching painting off the wall (It'd made a great campfire) he'd sold off some off the less important artifacts to make a small about of money and then he'd slowly built up to his position as head healer of accidents and emergencies at St Mungo's which was where he was supposed to be in the next 40 minutes.
"Just the usual stuff and maybe some food, we're gonna have a picnic."
Andromeda was running around trying to get her stuff together to go on her errands.
"I'm Healer Jones but call me Alex, I'm a friend. Why don't you go sit in the cafe, I'll come and get you when you can see him." And with that Alex ran to catch up with the healers as they turned the corner out of sight.
He isn’t sure what to say. He feels ecstatic about the idea of finally getting some fresh air. Ron will probably feel the same. They’ll be able to go outside and enjoy themselves. But what about… Malfoy? Harry can’t believe he’s even thinking this, but, inexplicably, he feels almost bad at the thought of Malfoy, either staying inside or being outside all by himself.
It suddenly becomes quite the challenge to stay vertical. It’s like Potter punched him right in the gut. ‘Good friend’. Not only is that the last thing Draco wants to be, there’s this sudden tightness in his chest; he’s been lying to Potter, and he thinks Draco is being a good friend? Merlin, could this get any worse?
Instead of a snarky retort, Malfoy just rolls his eyes and keeps feeding Penny. They’ve fallen into this weird routine; the days are starting to blur together. And they still haven’t made any progress on the bond. At this point, Harry isn’t sure if he really wants to. He’s still freaked out by what Malfoy told him. Is he taking the piss again? Then again, it does make sense, doesn’t it? If this is really a spell used for—Oh god. He really doesn’t want to think about it. So he doesn’t. As best as he can. That, however, proves to be immensely difficult the next day, when he wakes up snuggled up to Malfoy yet again. He’s almost getting used to it now, and even though he doesn’t like to admit it, it does feel quite nice. Very nice, in fact. The thing that throws him off completely, though, is what Malfoy is wearing.
Draco tries not to feel hurt by this and waits in anticipation as Potter crawls over to him.
They all turn to the portrait behind McGonagall’s desk. Draco freezes. Dumbledore. In all the hecticness, he hadn’t realised he was there.
“Malfoy, wait,” he says, reaching into his bag. “Here, take this.” Part of him feels like he’s going to regret this; what if Malfoy doesn’t return it? But right now, it feels like the right thing to do.
“I’m not!”
Draco positively jumps out of his skin when he suddenly feels Potter’s hand brushing his.
“You do realise you can probably do whatever you want, right?” Draco said, turning around to him.
“Sometime?” Malfoy asks, teasingly. Harry makes a face and quickly kisses him again, trying to hide his embarrassment.
“Is, um—Is this kind of attention alright?”
“With a dash of caramel syrup,” he winks. “Just the way you like it.”
For the longest time, Draco has succeeded in swallowing his feelings, turning every hint of sentiment for Potter into anger and loathing. It worked out fine so far. Draco never lets himself think about Potter in any other way. It would break him.
“Good match?” Malfoy suddenly asks, sitting down beside him. Harry instinctively flinches away from him.
“Dunno. What do you want me to do?”
“Don’t boil over the milk.”
Malfoy lets out a sigh and pulls Harry closer to him, leaving him absolutely dumbstruck. What the fuck? He acts like he’s enjoying this. But he doesn’t. Harry knows he doesn’t. Which makes this so much harder. Because Harry is very much enjoying it, even though he doesn’t want to. But he can’t help it. How could he? Ugh. This really, really sucks.
"Just quickly, what do you think about this outfit? I'm really bad with choosing things that look good." Harry showed off his outfit.
"Oh sod off that was eleven years ago, you've changed since then, not the same Malfoy you used to be." Harry gently shoved Draco's shoulder with his own.
"Yeah!"
Draco gave his usual kind smile reserved for his patients and ushered Harry into his office.
The two curled up infront of the TV watching say yes to the dress, a tub of ice cream between the two. Harry started to feel that maybe things might not be as bad as they seemed.
Pansy had left a few hours ago and both of the boys were fast asleep. Draco was using the time he had procrasted sleeping with to tidy up a bit round the old house. The house was still quite similar to what it had been when Draco and Saturn moved in but it had a much more homely feel to it now all the dark magic and screaming paintings had been disposed of. Draco jumped at the sound of a knock on the door, looking at the old grandfather clock in the corner he wondered who could be knocking on his door at one am. He opened the door to a very messy haired and tired looking Harry.
"He's four, I was seventeen when he was born, Astoria was sixteen she didn't survive."
"Sit yourself up there." Draco pointed to the hospital bed opposite his desk.
We do not support Jk Rowling.
Harry shoved his head in his hands sighing loudly, he didn't have a bloody clue what to do and that was extremely frustrating.
It'd been a week since their outing, a week since their perfect day out which Harry would argue had been one of the greatest days out he'd had. Then it happened, a day which at the time seemed like the end of the world to the brunette. He was at Ron and Hermione's flat, nothing out of the ordinary just a regular visit, it had been getting late, nearly midnight.
"Malfoy you say?"
Draco slid a small green potion onto the table with a glass of water.
"Good as gold." Harry said leaning against the door post.
"Mhm."
Draco stepped aside letting Harry into the house, closing the door carefully behind him.
"Even tonight, I know my friends are just trying to help but clubs like that just aren't my thing, Hermione thinks I need to get out she says I'm lonely."
"Are you drunk?"
"Yeah no problem."
"I'm here." He took Draco's outstretched hand.
"Andromeda's taking him for the night, you are coming back to mine."
Draco laughed gently sitting across from Harry he twisted his wrist gently to look at the burn on the brunettes arm. Harry hissed quietly at his cold hands.
"Merlin Hermione, you can't just let yourself into my apartment." He put Teddy down ushering him to go play with his toy's while he sat on his sofa next to Hermione.
"How have you been dear?"
"Yes, Hi."
"Same old, same old." Harry said cheerfully taking his coat off and hanging it on the bannister.
Draco made a disgusted face.
Draco was up at nine on Thursday, he'd only gone to bed at six but he had coffee and energy drinks, Saturn was on the ceiling with excitement, Draco had helped him get dressed into his animal dungarees with his dragon hoodie underneath Saturn loved his dragon hoodie it had wings and a tail, it was everything a four year old dragon obsessed child could ever want but it paired nicely with his grey dungarees. Draco had moved to packing their picnic basket with all manner of cakes and sweet treats knowing full well he'd have a sugar hyped up child when he tried to get him to bed that night. He'd made a few plates of sandwiches and packed coffee with heating charms for him and Harry and chocolate milkshake for the kids, he then filled his water bottle with monster energy to help get him through the day. Harry and Teddy showed up around eleven as promised, Teddy rushing in after a quick hug,  off to play with his cousin. A rather tired looking Harry joined Draco in the kitchen.
"Yes, what did you say hit you?"
"Harry?" His voice was corse and groggy.
"Hi darling." Andromeda said with a smile as she opened the door Teddy on her hip.
Draco was laying across his sofa, his hair was down just hitting his collar bone, he wore his old pink Floyd shirt and ripped jeans. Pansy had come over to see her Godson and Draco of course but mainly Saturn.
Harry and Teddy left that evening as Draco had work the next day. The two flooed back to Harry's apartment to a rather fussy Max and a very worried Hermione Granger.
Harry sat himself down and surveyed the desk in front of him, it was a clutter of quills and patient folders, one the walls was covered in a string of photos most of them of Saturn and Draco together. One that caught Harry's eye was of Draco and Saturn when what Harry assumed the day Saturn was born, the photo was dated 2/2/1998, Draco looked younger in the photograph almost like he had at school, his hair was short but slightly messier than it was usually kept but the unusual thing was he was smiling, Harry couldn't remember a time he'd seen Draco smile genuinely when they were in school but he was almost beaming at his son who was wrapped in a green blanket in his arms.
"Hi!" Harry said way to cheery for five o'clock on a work day.
"Yeah I'll come along, Do I need to bring anything?"
He mumbled, stuttering over his words.
"I think not."
Harry nodded, moving to the floor to play blocks with the boys. Draco gave a thankful smile glad to have a few minutes to himself, he loved being a parent and he loved his son with every piece of him but parenting alone was always a struggle, he honestly couldn't remember the last time he had an hour to himself without worrying about something or someone. The water felt warm rushing over his tattooed skin, he allowed himself to soak in it for a while before lathering up his curls, running fingers through them trying to release any knots that had formed overnight, he scrubbed at his skin, scrubbing more harshly at his dark mark until his skin turned red and hot, part of him still hoped that if he scrubbed away at it enough it might go away but it wouldn't.
Harry shook his head another bout of tears falling as he sunk his face back into the damp patch on Draco's shoulder. The blond swung his legs over his own allowing Harry to grip tightly onto him and for him to rub soothing circles on his back.
Draco swallowed inwardly the shirt hugged his muscles and complemented his tan skin, the jacket made his shoulders look broader and the small amount of stubble on his face was driving Draco's temperature through the ceiling.
"And I swore off dairy but then I found Ben and Jerry's."
"Why would my ribs be healing? Merlin I feel shit."
"I really hate hospital beds." He mumbled.
It was Teddy this time that ran for a hug, his blue hair changing to a platinum blonde.
"Yeah we are."
"What time is it?"
Harry took a deep breath in, the second hand smoke filling his lungs.
"Thanks for talking to me." He mumbled into the sheets.
Harry snatched Dracos good hand away holding it tightly in his own, there wasn't much Draco could do with his other hand considering it was in a splint.
"Glorified Whore would be the term I'd use."
"Let's go into the living room okay, we'll get you by the fire."
"Are you stopping by?" Draco asked.
"You can share with me?"
Harry nodded slowly.
"Please."
Draco pulled the two up onto the bed turning round the put them between Harry and himself, curling up around Saturn both his and Harry's arms wrapped around the boy's.
Harry let Teddy down who ran straight into Draco's arms. Draco picked the boy up sitting him on his lap and gently bouncing him making Teddy giggle gleefully.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Mhm?" Harry turned round to face Draco.
"Bad dweam." Saturn mumbled.
Draco opened the door allowing Harry to come in, as soon as the door shut behind him Harry practically threw himself at the blond, wrapping his arms round him, clinging onto fistfuls of his hoodie and sobbing into his shoulder. Draco carefully removed Harry's glasses placing them on the hall table and allowing the Gryffindor to bury his face deeper into the soft fabric of his hoodie. One arm wrapped around his waist holding the shorter man close to him the other stroked his hair gently, fingers running through the thick dark curls. He swayed gently wresting his chin in the crook of his neck, letting Harry let out any tears he needed to cry.
"Try not to end up in my office anytime soon."
"Maybe you shouldn't do that, Alex says your ribs are still healing."
The two looked at each other in silence for a second before bursting into giggles and like that the tension was gone.
"Maybe I want a guy to hit on me, okay, maybe I want to go home with a guy have you not thought for a second there might be a reason I hate straight bars. Okay I'm Gay, queer, bent, whatever you want to call it so tell me please what gay guys are like because I'd really love to know!" He almost shouting in a breath of anger and passion.
"Of course I'll be nice." Harry's was slightly confused at that.
-Thanks a bunch, see you Saturday x
"I didn't realise you knew how I like my tea." Harry commented as they sat in the car park letting Draco down his coffee before he started driving again.
"Ice cream and crap tv?" Draco suggested.
He reached his hand up to examain the gash on her temple.
Draco crossed his arms across his chest like a child. He then tried to reach for his own charts which Alex held away.
"Oh shush, as you said I've changed a lot."
He handed Draco the mug of tea which he gave a thanks for while still petting max with his bad hand.
Then it hit him, his name had always raised eyebrows but it had never been a real problem with anyone after they took one look at him.
"Please just get out of my Apartment, Teddy needs to go to bed."
Harry, Draco,Teddy and Saturn have a great day out at the zoo and the Draco considers the murder of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.
"You are done."
-Hi, Six should be fine, I'll leave the wards open if you wanna apperate. Draco.
"I take it it wasn't a good reaction."
"Whats wrong biscuit?" Draco asked kindly rocking his son in his arms.
"Some club that 'Mionie found, not really my thing but I haven't been out in a while."
It was around eight o'clock when the four actually started their day. Draco and Harry got the boys up, fed, bathed and dressed by half nine, it was much easier with the two of them working together.
Harry's friends are adamant to get him out for the night but he prefers the comfort of Draco's door step and leather jacket.
"Yeah... He's with Theo now."
Draco on the other hand was not having a great day. A&E had been at almost full capacity all day, he'd not had a chance to sit down and eat his lunch so he was running on a piece of toast and three cans of monster and was honestly concerned his next patient might be himself. By the end of his shift he had been thrown up on three times, was on his last pair of clean scrubs and was ready to keel over at any minute but when four O'clock came he was happy to chuck the leather jacket over his shoulders, eat the entire bar of chocolate in his pocket and leave his office in a mildly clean pair of scrubs. He apperated to the end of Andromeda's street, backpack chucked over his shoulder. He rummaged for his keys in his pocket before opening the door.
"Don't be sorry, you need to talk about these things leaving them bottled up won't do any good."
He stepped back carefully, placing the clipboard on the side and raising his hands in surrender. Her eyes glazed over his arms, be didn't hear much of what he said he just felt the impact of the stunning spell chucked in his direction followed by two more, he smashed his head against the wall and then everything went black.
"Do you want anything?"
"Well that's great Harry you need more friends, do I know them?"
"Do you live alone?"
He said goodbye to Teddy and flooed to Ron and Hermione's flat, his jeans hugging his ass when he walked towards the fireplace.
"Aww Malfoy beginning to care about me?"
"Accidentally left the stove on and put my arm down on it." Harry tried to laugh off the pain, it didn't really work.
"I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself thanks." Draco couldn't resist.
"Gay bars." He mumbled quietly, pulling up his shirt to expose his tattoo.
The two shared a few jokes and pleasant conversations before they finally made their way into the living room the children fast asleep against each other. One thing Harry noticed was when Teddy slept he let go of his controlled appearance and looked like a small version of Remus.
"Shhh, shhh." He whispered softly.
"So what brings you to my doorstep?" He flicked the ash onto the concrete next to him.
Harry shook his head into Dracos shoulder and the blond could feel the tears seeping through his hoodie, something really bad had happened.
"I was actually trying to get ahold of you."
Harry stumbled into Ron and Hermione's flat, dusting himself off from the access of floo powder.
"Granger was right you need to get out more."
"Yeah, it looks good, it looks great, you look really nice." He stumbled over his words, very flustered.
"Sod off."
"I never knew you had a son." Harry stated.
"Any reason or just feeling?"
"Okay but like even if he was Gay and into me because let's face it he's got much better choices than an ex Death Eater, I swore of dating years ago."
"If Andromeda's in Scotland would you be able to take Saturn for a day?"
"Have to say I wasn't expecting to see you today." Draco broke his daydreaming for the second time that day.
"No, but you can give yourself time to heal before you talk to them."
"Do you want to stay with daddy tonight poppet?" Saturn nodded gently into Draco's shoulder. Draco carried Saturn upstairs the eye's of the old painting's watching the pair. Draco dropped his hoodie before he got into his bed, his son asleep on his chest just like he did the day he was born. Draco's mind drifted to the day and the beautiful green eyes that had greeted him in the doorway of his aunt's living room.
Harry's daydreaming however was cut short by a sharp burning pain through the inner side of his left forearm, lost in his thoughts he'd accidentally dropped his arm onto the hot stove he'd unintentionally left on. He quickly turned it off rushing to run his blistering skin under cold water profusely cursing under his breath in all manner of profanities.
"Okay."
Harry's cheeks heated up and he dropped his head.
Draco's heart dropped.
He moved to open the door for Harry.
They exchanged a quick conversation Teddy and Saturn running off to play.
"Why are you sad?" A small voice came from the door, Saturn was up again.
"Well at least you can admit it and it's Harry." Harry smiled.
"Are you sure you're not drunk?"
"Because he was dating Weaslette for years."
"I don't, well not much anymore but on occasion I find it can help."
Harry had sent a patronus to Andromeda telling her what had happened and that she might need to take Saturn for a little longer. It was about an hour before Harry could see Draco. When he walked in he noticed a few things, one was the cut on his temple which had a small piece of gauze taped on it, Harry assumed it had been soaked in a healing potion, the next thing he noticed was his wrist was covered with a brown splint, usually healers could fix small breaks in minutes so to have it supported must have meant it was bad. The blond began to stir about twenty minutes later, Alex help him sit up adjusting the IV of healing potions in his arm.
We do not support Jk Rowling.
"I didn't hear from you after the war, what happened?" Harry asked.
"I am but I have coffee and monster."
"It's Harry. He's my friend, what's happened?"
"I like to travel in style."
Draco passed him another vial of the green painkillers and began to write down his notes.
"Taking my IV out."
"Sod off." He rolled his eyes before disappearing behind his office door.
Draco paused, he hadn't expected Harry to get it so quickly.
He let Teddy scramble off his lap and sit on the floor with Saturn who had moved off Pansy's lap.
"Hey mate, just take it easy okay."
Harry's head whipped round at the light coming from one of the exam room which was being flocked too by healers and security aurors. He squinted to see what was going on, picking up on a few orders being shouted out and saw a healer with light brown hair and purple scrubs carrying a figure in light green scrubs, the man placed the other healer on an available gurney and rush the other healer past him. Only when he got a good look at the healer did he realise who it was. Draco's blond hair was spread out across the bed, he was almost curled up like he had collapsed and there was a bruise on his temple where he had obviously hit the floor with an impact. Harry followed the healers trying to catch up.
"Shattered wrist, three broken ribs and a laceration to your head."
"Oh shove off." Harry collapsed on the sofa next to the blond.
"Andromeda usually babysits when I'm at work, although they're both at school next year so that'll make things easier, anyway enough about me, what about you I haven't heard about you in years."
"Yeah I have no plans for Thursday."
"No thanks, I'm already a bit late and Hermione will have my head."
He left the bar shortly after almost disgusted with himself he'd just let a girl suck him off in a dirty bathroom because she looked like Draco Malfoy, not one of his finest moments. It was one am and he downed his sobering potion all the thoughts of the night still fucking with his head. It's not like he had a chance with Draco I mean the boy was straight he had a child with a women and it doesn't take a genius to figure out how that happened, he decided he should probably stop thinking about the Slytherin's sex life for his benefit. He didn't really feel like going back to his apartment, sleeping alone allowed all the memories of the war, of dying to come back to him. He ended up on the familiar doorstep of number twelve Grimmauld place.
"You're lonely Harry, I've read about it you need to go out somewhere new, meet someone." She had said. As he had guessed twenty minutes into their outing he was sat alone at the bar drinking straight tequila, trying to get himself drunk enough to actually enjoy the evening. He'd stuffed a sobering potion in his pocket just in case he needed it. He felt the small vibrate of his phone in his pocket, it was a text from Draco, his heart fluttered excitedly at the name on his phone. He opened it to find a photo of Teddy and Saturn fast asleep, tangled together in Saturn's bed with a mountain of stuffed animals, what he'd do to be there with them and honesty to be anywhere but alone at the bar. A few hours later he found himself in the cold, filthy bathroom of the nightclub, jeans and boxer's round his thighs and a beautiful blond girl sucking him off, he had had zero intent of going home with someone or actually talking to someone in the first place but the girl had been nice and well Harry knew it was wrong but she did look very much like a certain blond that Harry wouldn't be against being in the same position with. He cursed inwardly trying to bat away the thoughts of his friend but the blond curls were far too enticing.
Draco scooped his son up in his arms holding him tightly.
"Whats your name lovely?" He asked sweetly.
"You're welcome to come along if you want I could always use the extra set of hands."
"Yeah I can take Teddy on Saturday."
"Anyone that wasn't in Slytherin didn't, me and Blaise weren't exactly subtle." He let the smoke of his last drag linger behind his teeth.
"He's less of an angel at five in the morning but his hugs are really something else."
"I'm sorry."
Harry nodded, the exact words had been, 'Get your hands off me you filthy Death Eater.'
"Mhm, there are better ways to talk to me than ending up in A&E you know?"
"God yes please."
His alarm hadn't gone off and he'd been awoken precisely Twenty minutes ago by his son jumping on his bed. In that time he'd successfully got his scrubs on twice, once the wrong way round and then the right way round second time, fed his son and himself and packed his work bag all that was left to do was pack his sons bag and get Saturn ready to go to his Aunt's house. Saturn and Teddy were partners in crime at this point, Saturn looked exactly like Draco did when he was younger with his striking blonde hair that fell in small curls and silver eyes, although something Draco hadn't expected was the streak of dark brown hair that had appeared at the front of Saturn's hairline that matched his mother's. Draco carried Saturn up to his room helping him get dressed into his dungarees and stripy jumper before packing his bag with a spare change of clothes and his favourite toys. The small child clutched his stuffed toy dragon in his hand as Draco put the bee backpack on his sons back and tied his own converse before his sons and throwing his leather jacket on. The jacket had been a gift from Andromeda, it used to belong to his second cousin Sirius, after the war Draco had done everything that would have disappointed his pure blood supremacist father, he'd grown out his hair the ringlets now just past his shoulders, he'd covered his arms in tattoos that made his dark mark less prominent, he'd smoked although he didn't do that anymore mainly for the sake of his son. Andromeda had given him the old leather jacket about twenty minutes after telling him how similar the two were.
The healer that had picked Draco up stopped to talk to him.
"Then don't talk about the war, tell me about what happened after the war."
Something in Harry snapped at that moment like the final nail holding him together buckling.
"Positive."
"That'll ease the pain, then we'll get you patched up."
"Drop me a text when you're dropping Teddy off."
"Going anywhere nice?" It was Pansy that spoke this time, she wasn't really interested.
"Hectic." Draco replied spooning sugar into his own Tea. The kitchen hatch led to the living room so the two could keep an eye on the boys.
Draco sat across from him a selection of burn salves, gauze and bandages placed next to the pair.
Harry turned towards Saturn sitting on the floor next to him. Now Saturn was at eye level Harry knew who his father was, how could he not he was almost identical to Draco and the 'be nice' comment started to make a lot more sense.
“Yes, but surely there’s no need for Potter and I to share—” Draco clamps his mouth shut as McGonagall’s eyes find his. “Nevermind,” he mutters.
“Okay.” But Harry can’t stop smiling. He’s pretty sure his face is going to hurt soon, but he doesn’t care. He doesn’t care at all.
“Who told me my past doesn’t define me? Who told me I could be more than what everybody expects me to be? Were those just empty words?”
Draco steps forward and peeks inside the tent. He can’t help but gasp at the sight he’s met with. “Dear Mother of Merlin!” He gapes at Potter. “Broom closets are bigger than this.”
“I… um…” Draco couldn’t even give a lame excuse for his outburst. His mind was completely blank.
“Unfortunately, yes. I don’t think I would be able to ever stay away from you again, even if I tried.”
Draco snorted but let himself be pulled into a kiss. Like always, he tasted like raspberries.
He looked around, frowning, until he paused to sniff at his own clothes.
“Ugh, I hate being called a celebrity. I’m not. You know that.”
“That’s impossible,” Harry croaks. “My new flatmate is—”
It feels… weird. Now that the tingling is gone, Draco realises how sore he is. He notices Potter waving his hand and freezes. This is it. This is the moment he dreaded. Potter always closed himself off after he cleaned them up.
“Don’t lose hope. Hope is the only thing worth fighting for.”
Harry narrows his eyes at him but quickly forgets about feigning indignation when Malfoy cups his cheeks.
Harry just grins at him.
“You know,” Draco says, his voice full of amusement, “if you ever feel like making a list about the things you love most about me, don’t let me stop you.”
“Oh, Potter, believe me when I say, it would blow your mind.”
Before Draco can stop him, he’s already vanished in Draco’s fireplace.
Harry’s mind reeled.
“Sure, that’s the only reason,” Blaise snorted. His eyes wandered over to Harry, scrutinising him. “I really have no idea how you put up with him.”
“What? It’s much too bright in here and—Oh. You were talking about
“Hogwarts.”
He ignored the incredulous looks Mister Franklin and Malfoy were giving him and pushed through the crowd. Harry noticed how Malfoy’s body twitched under his touch. It made Harry’s stomach flip. He hadn’t planned to be so bold but escaping a reporter from the Daily Prophet always took priority.
