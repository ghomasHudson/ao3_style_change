, he thought bitterly.
Harry frowns, "Other things?
"Hello again, handsome," Harry greeted softly, reaching out from beside Corvus to rub the pad of his finger on the beak of the black owl. Caligo puffed and crooned under the attention, nipping at Harry's finger gently. Harry was cooing at the soft but spoilt reaction of the bird when they were interrupted by a loud and impatient screech from behind. Corvus raised an eyebrow as he turned, glancing at the appearance of an impatient but beautiful snowy owl.
Harry sat in shock at the results of his test, numbly handing it to Corvus when he raised a brow. Corvus, in turn, hands his test to Harry, already reading his younger cousin's results. Harry reads Corvus's results, silently thankful for a reprieve from thinking about his own.
Harry was floored, beyond awed at the various clubs and events, especially the sports department. Hogwarts only had Quidditch and Dueling that one time in second year (that he was aware of). Harry was especially curious about aerobatics, broom racing and owl racing, as well as the winged horse racing, of which Corvus was a club member. Corvus had suggested that if he was truly interested, he could always found a club in Hogwarts or ask one of the teachers or head of houses if it was possible to do. When Harry pointed out that he was already part of the Quidditch team, Corvus had stated that it was allowed to be part of two clubs at a time. Harry hesitantly said he might need to think more on the subject, which Corvus was very amenable to, claiming that thinking things through was always a good quality to possess.
Marauders' Den was fun. It was significantly smaller than the rest of his properties but just as big in regards to land and just as jaw-dropping. It was a group of treehouses, way up on the trees and deep within the forest. They were connected by bridges and were painted colourfully. There was a house for each marauder (his dad had a viewing tower on his that Harry absolutely loved) and it was well-maintained by the house-elf Mimsy.
“That’s possible?” Harry squeaks, eyes wide in surprise. Alrod nods, telling Harry he simply needs to wish it and it will be so. He does so and looking at the rings, though he could still see it, there seems to be a faint mist or shimmer over them, his Heir Ring the only one still visible.
Harry pales. “Death magic?”
Alrod was a loss at this, not knowing how to explain to a young boy of only 10 years how his godfather could be the reason why his parents died.
Harry sat in shock as the words processed in his brain. He didn't even have time to be shocked that his name was actually Harrison or that he had godparents when the other things on the list caught him off guard. Like the fact that he was a lord, a real Lord, of multiple titles, that he was rich, that he has multiple places to call home, or that this Dumbledore person his older self had warned him about placed weird charms on him—not to mention that marriage contract with that girl he had never even met!
When they calmed, Corvus wrapped an arm around Harry again, and the two made their way away from the house.
(See the end of the chapter for
"For now, we go to Gringotts as planned, settle your vaults and estates, find out who was the sod who failed to take care of you and discuss what we'll do with them once we find out, and then I'll try to take custody of you," Corvus states calmly. It would be their plan for the day. Corvus would talk to Harry more about his inheritance at a later day, tomorrow, or the next when Harry had had more time to process the onslaught of information he was getting.
“And the other house-elves?”
Alrod stood by and watched the emotions filter through his face, the pleased shock to numb surprise and disbelief to wonder to horrified surprise then to angry disbelief. Alrod grew concerned when the expression became angry and vengeful, blazing emerald eyes snapping up to meet his.
, Harry's mind supplies) would hear. Harry's hand rises to touch little Harry's hair, right where it hides his scar. The younger winces in recognition but says nothing, does nothing, because young Harry can see the same scar reflected in front of him.
“Unfortunately, once it is removed, it may try to wreak havoc or to try and possess someone, as the main soul part will not be in the near vicinity for it to return to. As opposed to simply destroying the container, which would not allow for the soul shard to exit. A method we cannot use as destroying the container would mean, well, killing you." Alrod continued to explain.
Aunt Petunia wrenches the door open, her mouth open wide to scream at her nephew to
Alrod conversed with the female goblin in a language Harry couldn't pinpoint, a language he was sure belonged to the goblin race.
Deciding they would leave Sirius’ case to when the Will has been read, they discussed other matters—specifically, Dumbledore.
Harry relaxed then, satisfied with the protections, even if he didn't understand them. Somehow, goblins struck Harry as the meticulous kind so he knew they'd not allow unsatisfactory work so their 'wards' must be good then.
by Chadwick Boot,
Harry smacked his forehead harshly, fingertips at the ever-fresh-looking scar found there. He started to claw at it with his fingernails, sharp, red lines appearing at where his nails scratched, blood starting to pool at the surface of his scar, but Harry did not feel it, mind whirling with the realization that the murderer who took his parents from him, the monster that made
He heard a small chuckle from above his head and blinked when a piece of rolled parchment appeared in front of him. He looked back at Alrod handing him the parchment.
Harry calmed himself when he saw Remus look away. He placed a palm to his chest, willing his heart to go back to a normal pace. He missed the stare-off of Alrod and Remus, as he had closed his eyes and counted back from ten. He also missed the suspicious glance Severus threw at the werewolf, Malfoy staring at his friend curiously.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tom offered to escort him and Harry politely declined. He thanked the barkeep and made his way to Gringotts. Older Harry said it was big and white and slightly tilted. Harry could find that, sure enough, hopefully before night came.
For almost ten years, torturous years filled with watching over misbehaving children and dunderheaded teenagers—when he can barely tolerate adults on a good day—all in an effort to be there for when Harry Potter, spawn of his childhood enemy and once-childhood friend, finally comes to Hogwarts and watch over the child so he stays away from danger and stays alive. Almost ten years of asking, pretending not to give a damn about the well-being of a boy, a
"Harry?" Corvus called out softly to his cousin, Harry glancing back at him slowly and looking lost. "Do you wish to have him sued for this?" The question made Harry's breath caught, mind freezing and stilling.
Both gave the customary bow, but only Snape gave the customary greeting. Harry also noted how McGonagall sat with the other professors while Snape went to sit next to Lord Malfoy, the two men greeting each other by name.
The notion that Harry would go shopping, using his own money, for no one but himself, and that no one ordered him to, had the young wizard feeling giddy.
Huh. So magic was like a pen or pencil then, Harry thought. Pens have the power to create beautiful sonnets, wonderful songs, and amazing pictures. It had the power to stop wars and share love. It, also, had the ability to start wars and spread hate. It was, as the kitchen knife, sharp enough that if you stab someone hard enough, they could die.
Harry is curious by this custom, though not as much as to know who these people were to his parents. He knows Minerva McGonagall to be the Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts, should they be the same person. Sirius Black sounded somewhat familiar to Harry, though unsure where he heard of him.
"I think it's pretty hilarious," a voice says from the door leading to the hall. Uncle Vernon's head swivels to the side, and Harry gapes at the tall, young man at the door. He had medium length, black hair brushed back, revealing piercing, silver eyes, with aristocratic features, high cheekbones, strong jaw, and rosy thin lips with a beauty mark near it. There was a black and red rucksack hanging from his shoulder.
It was then that Harry notices one particular box that was covered in a black cloth, hidden behind all the others and in a nook.
Nodding, Harry let the goblin handle it, dropping the subject for now. They then moved on to another important matter that had been sitting for just as long as Sirius had.
"Master Goblin, may I ask what this is about?" Dowager Longbottom asks, the corners of her lips tugging down.
Plus, Alrod was being so helpful to him, he wouldn't want him to get hurt. Or whoever it was that would remove the soul shard from his forehead, as they'd be his fellow goblin.
"Um, h-hello," Harry inwardly cringed at himself for the weak greeting, "I'm Harry. It's nice to meet you." There. That wasn't so hard. Harry patted himself on the back when he saw McGonagall smile and Remus' smile widened. Snape merely raised a brow but he wasn't frowning, sneering, or glaring so that was an okay thing too, right?
Plans happen and Harry gets clarification on his inheritance!
, in your house. Harrison won't be returning."
, "But it appears the owl that sent yours was delayed. We shall endeavour to find out why."
It's been two days since then and Harry has gladly done his chores—not because he wanted the house perfect for Corvus; 8-year-old Corvus was already of the opinion this place would only be perfect if it was burned to ashes in the ground, Harry was of the mind that, that hadn't changed much—but because he wanted to keep busy while he waited.
"But what can I do?" Little Harry whispers, always so quiet, never one to be loud even in the comfort of his own mind, as if someone (
'. Harry had the small thought to omit some things from his older cousin but a sharp glance halted that idea before it could bloom. Harry never could lie or keep secrets from Corvus. His cousin knew him better than anyone, even after all these years, and was too observant to blindside.
"You called me uncle Moony," he whispered hoarsely, staring at Harry in awe. Harry gave a small smile.
Gurkrat handed him a vial of liquid, instructing him to down it. "It will cause you to sleep through the process. This will take a while, Lord Potter."
When he was in front of them, Harry couldn't help but blush, looking at the ground instead. For some strange reason, Harry suddenly felt awkward, like he was wearing too tight clothes. He had never felt this before so he did not know that he was feeling shy over meeting his godparents.
“Congratulations, Lord Potter.”
Which, Harry thinks, isn’t really helpful, at all. It seems foreboding at most, paired with the hoarse drawl of Alrod. Harry feels like he should expect as much from Goblins.
Older Harry feels a shift then, like a subtle and gentle wind, and he knows he has to hurry.
When he had returned, Harry was still on the floor laughing, cheeks aching and stomach cramping at the continued laughter. Corvus merely smirked at him, a familiar glint in his eyes, as he waited for Harry to calm down. When Harry had controlled his laughter and had managed to get himself up, Corvus then shifted his looks again. Straight, blond-white hair, same silver eyes, and his small straight nose elongating ever so slightly, making it look pointy and defined; Corvus looked like he was brothers with Draco Malfoy.
They repeat this five more times before Harry feels his head clears and his breath returning. His vision returns—
Alrod gazed at the boy, mature beyond his years, and wondering, not for the first time, how life could deal him such cards and yet remain so kind.
That was when he realized…
you okay?" He asked, making sure.
"You go to London, to a pub named Leaky Cauldron in Charing Cross Road. When you arrive at Diagon, go to Gringotts, the bank. It’s white and huge, hard to miss. Aunt Petunia knows the way. I know you're afraid but you have to get her to take you. If she won't, and you think you can go on your own, then go. Be smart, Harry. We have always been smart; don't let anyone stop you from showing it, not anymore."
Alrod gave him a rundown of the monetary values: 29 knuts to a sickle, 17 sickles to a galleon. 1 galleon was £4.93. Harry short-circuited at this and struggled to do the math in his head. Alrod dropped a bigger bomb on him he announced Harry had 1.8B galleons in the Potter Main Vault alone, not to mention the other older
Harry blushed but smiled, pleased nonetheless. He's been doing that a lot, smiling. More than he would have thought himself capable of, being in Privet Drive. Then again, he had thought he would not see his cousin again, so he had a perfectly good excuse to be happy. His smile did fade a little, when he thought about how long he had not seen Corvus.
Some may say that I was a little too mean to the Dursleys, some may say it's just what they deserve—I'll leave the decision up to you but just know that I was kinder to them than they ever were to Harry!
"Well, it seems you are who you say you are, Lord Potter,"
Once calm, he grabbed the last ring, the only ring for which he would not be Lord to. Harry was okay with this as he heard his godfather Sirius was Lord Black. In prison he may be, alive he was still and that was better than nothing.
Harry inhales sharply, expression serious, "We're cunning, Harry, we have to be to survive in a place where we're unwanted, I had to be, to survive in a dangerous time. And now, now you're going to have to be cunning again, so that you don't come to that. Do you want to come to that? Do you want to become
Slytherin was a circular silver box, rune etchings, and emeralds for design, and the lid was made of a green stone, its crest proudly showing; green with a silver snake and a knight’s helmet.
“Was Sirius Black the Secret-Keeper?”
Alrod didn't respond, merely raising his hand to the corner where Remus still stared at. The other three glanced at where the goblin gestured, only to blink back in shock as a child started to appear from what was previously empty space.
Remus gave a wide, if not watery, smile. He gave a quiet laugh, "I suppose I am, aren't I?" His grin soon disappeared though as he gave Harry a worried look, though considerably more moderate than before. "I still want to know what was wrong, though. As I'm sure the others do, as well."
"Wicked," Harry breathes out, and Corvus' eyes soften, glancing at his younger cousin in fondness and protectiveness.
Alrod nodded along to Harry’s plan. “Yes, checking the house for what you’ll need is a must. They have been unlived for quite some time, after all. Although you could ask the house-elves to buy the food for you, so you wouldn’t have to. I would also recommend you buy clothes. I’m sure you’ll need a whole wardrobe. Should I write down a list of shops?”
“Why have they thrown him in prison?”
Harry blushed when Mimsy gave a startled laugh.
"That would be helpful," Harry agrees.
“You can go to each property through the Portkey in your rings. Simply touch the ring of the House you wish to go and state what property you will go to.” Alrod then adds, “A Portkey is an enchanted object that upon touch will bring you to a set destination instantly, no matter how far. It is either time or password activated.”
Corvus was quite amused with Harry and Malfoy's relationship, saying that it was petty and hilarious, though he had gotten irritated with Malfoy in some instances. Still, Corvus was adamant that he make amends with the blond prat, or at the very least, to settle their petty rivalry. Corvus wanted him to be focused on himself and his studies, to make up for lost time, and be a worthy heir to the Potter and Black name. A childish rivalry between two heirs of Ancient and Noble bloodlines, and one that's distantly connected to their Black lines, was unacceptable, especially when it was borne of a childish misunderstanding.
"Tell me that these," Severus drawled with a sneer, "
Hermione had explained this to him. How she would send her consciousness through time, when he would be able to warn himself, to change time, history, stop the war before it even begun. He would be tethered to a time, any time, where his younger self would be. Harry chose to find the him before it all started.
Harry nodded, relieved that the goblin had finally stopped glaring at him, and smiled, "It's fine, Alrod. I understand. I came by with no proof of identification other than my words and my scar, both of which can be faked by anyone at any time." Truly, he was just glad that they gave him a chance at all. He knew what he looked like and it didn't really paint a good picture when placed in a bank.
"'Just Harry'," Older him cuts him off. "I know," he smiles sad and knowingly. Little Harry is reminded then, that this man, taller than him, older than him, strong yet still so skinny, is still him. No one in this time, this moment, knows him more than this man does, because they are the same, one person, in different times, but still one, whole person.
At this, Harry tilted his head. “Right, my papers did say that a ‘
"I take it you've seen some things that did not please you?" Uldrick asked, prompting Corvus to growl, much to Harry's surprise—he growled, like, actually growled! Uldrick seemed surprised by it, too, his eyebrows reaching the top of his head.
.' And sign,
Before they could leave, Alrod, however, called out.
Alrod gives a sharp-toothed grin, “Exactly.”
Little Harry snorts; quiet, shocked laughter escaping his throat. Older him chuckles with him, feeling something deep within him soothed by childish and innocent laughter. Gods, when was the last time he saw pure joy like this? The elderly and the young were of the highest death rates when the war reached its peak. It still was, even after years of war. But that would change now; Harry could feel it in his bones, in his magic and in his soul. Little Harry would change it all, save them all, and no one would know but him and the forces that be.
Noticing the eyes on him, Uldrick took a big breath and calmed himself. He regarded the two with a nod. "Gringotts offers services for situations like these, Lord DeRose. St. Mungos can remove the Tracking Charm but the removal of Horcruxes is a job for Curse Breakers, of which Gringotts have the best."
The Potter account manager nodded, pleased. This made Harry flush and duck his head in embarrassment. Alrod snickered but said nothing on the matter.
It should make him angry and yet all he felt was a numb sort of sadness. He wondered if his older counterpart knew of this and if he got angry. Did he know their father did not trust Albus Dumbledore? Is that why he told Harry to not trust Dumbledore? Did he even ever get the chance to hear their parent’s will? Their voices and how they said they loved him?
Harry made his way to an antique long table that held rucksacks and messenger bags. Harry went to the newest looking one, a leather messenger bag, with an orange-red front pouch that had the Potter crest on it, with copper rings, rivets, and buckles. Inside there were pouches that he could fill with stationary, and in the middle, he saw notebooks—possibly the journals his father mentioned—a folded piece of parchment, and an envelope. He took out the envelope and saw his name scrawled on the front in blue ink. The Boy Who Lived traced the letters of his name individually, imagining his father hunched over a desk as he wrote down his letter, tongue slightly poking out like Harry does when he concentrates.
"Are you...?" Little Harry asks but the older shakes his head.
Seeing the souring expression of Snape and the bewildered gazes of the rest, Harry decided to show his Potter ring—Alrod had advised against showing all of them, believing it to be better to keep it hidden as a sort of trump card (Harry believe the goblin also wanted to see what would happen when Harry would reveal it later).
Remus gave the dour man an unimpressed glare before rounding his eyes at Harry, eyes going soft with worry as he stared at the young wizard. "Harry?
Voldemort had a piece of his
Hearing this, Corvus tightened his arms around him. He did not say anything in response, knowing Harry was truthful, as he often was. Instead, he kissed his younger cousin's hair, gave him one last squeeze before moving back, knowing Harry wouldn't be comfortable for long, in the presence of the Dursleys.
Harry gasps, heart-clenching at the state of two of his godparents, though he’s never met them.
"I'm back, Harrison," Corvus murmured in his ear, "And I'm never leaving you again." And Harry believed this to be the truth: Corvus had said so, so it is. Simple as that.
Harry decides then, that he wouldn't let his relatives bully him any more, not in his own house. It wasn't home; it would never be home to Harry. But he lives there too, for heaven's sake; he would not be bullied within his own house.
“There is also the prospect of healing any illness or health risk upon your person, as you would need to be somewhat healthy to unbind your core; it would take another half day," he adds. The next part seems to come more hesitant than the rest, Harry notes. Alrod’s eyes flicker to Harry's scar as he says, "And then there is also the matter of your scar, Lord Potter."
(See the end of the chapter for
. History was changing—or, in this case, erased.
Noticing this, Corvus ruffled Harry's hair and reassured him. "The Ministry detected some magics being cast in a muggle home and asked if you used your wand. I had a letter prepared in advance, mentioning my arrival and emancipated status, while assuring that I used my wand away from unaware muggles."
That was another matter they would have to fix, for who else might have tried to contact Harry and was unable to.
Not that Malfoy's actions were justifiable. Harry had planned to apologize to the git the day after when he realized how snobbish he had been to the blond. It wasn't Malfoy's fault he was spoiled by his parents and Harry should have tried to make
"How about no?"
Harry remembered feeling sad for Riddle, knowing what it was like to not belong.
Corvus swept in to discuss their business. "As you can see, Harry has been kept ignorant of our ways and his heritage. That's why we've come; we want to find out who exactly was Harry's magical guardian who failed their duties so, why Harry hasn't received any mail from Gringotts—though we learned they have been sending—and to change his guardianship to me."
Harry's move turned to be super effective.
The Slytherin Lord ring was of a different design, for one, it
Harry couldn't wait for Corvus to come back.
Harry nods and they then discuss the abilities portion of the test. Since Harry was new to magic in terms of knowledge, Alrod explains for him.
Harry grabs the stack of papers and places them within his backpack. He is reminded of the shoulder bag his father left for him. Before he leaves the bank, he’ll grab the bag and some monies. He’ll check the properties later, and, by default, the house-elves.
The Gryffindor ring next, a gold signet with the Gryffindor crest. Harry places it on his right index finger, feeling the magic of the ring judge him then settling quicker than the Peverell ring. It gave him a rush of magic, heated and bold, and the feeling he got whenever he got away with throwing sarcastic comments to his slow cousin behind the older Dursleys’ backs. It was a feeling that almost made him laugh, wondering why that feeling in particular.
Since the next few stops were actual castles, the number of rooms and floors were ridiculous, the lands it sat on were already vast enough that it would take half a day to walk through the entirety of it, much less having to walk through 6 other caste grounds. Harry decided to just pop by and ask the elves stationed there to make a list of repairs or needs for the properties.
If he is honest, terrifyingly honest, Harry has enough of being Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World ™. Maybe he will be happier as Harry Black.
He remembers too late that Malfoy doesn’t like kissing.
is the one in the dress and that it doesn’t suit him half as well as Potter—and then the hulk is back, roaring up from his position hunched over and snarling, blood red eyes boring into Draco, not looking away as he pulls the sword out of his back.
That doesn’t mean Draco wants the dinner, he is not quite that desperate to make Potter confront his human failures. But he is going to get Pansy her date, as many as she wants.
Malfoy sneers, his nice hands folded against himself, arms crossed, and if Harry didn’t know better he’d say Malfoy is hurt by his sudden retreat. Which is a) preposterous and b) irrelevant, even if true, so Harry doesn’t dwell on it and forces himself to focus on the ward.
. Harry isn’t the one who should apologise, isn’t the one who lashed out because he was feeling insecure and wanted to force the conversation away from himself at all cost. A conversation Draco is now absolutely sure
In any case, Potter doesn’t wait around for Draco’s grand act of mercy, already turning to survey the mess they made of his kitchen. Brave move; Draco tried to avoid that.
Ron is having far too much fun, barely bothering to try and hide his laughter behind his giant oven mitts. Is some rightful indignation on his behalf really too much to ask? If Harry wanted to be laughed at, he would have stayed in Grimmauld. Malfoy seems to always be around when Harry makes a fool out of himself, forgetting about the stick up his arse for just long enough to laugh himself stupid.
Malfoy,
“Somehow I doubt that would help. In fact, I suspect you just want to stare at me some more.” Potter smirks at him and Draco pulls him closer, wraps his arm around his waist.
“What, want me to call you Black?” Technically, Harry supposes they are both of them Blacks, though by mutual unspoken agreement they never even once called each other anything but Potter and Malfoy and the occasional insult, to avoid confusion (keeping to old names also neatly evades the reality of marriage to someone previously consider an enemy, which is always a plus).
“You are sure you didn’t mess up the address or something? The Floo is a delicate way of travelling and frankly, I find it hard to believe that you wanted to reach
“I love your hair, you know? I always wanted to braid it, since I first saw you again in that store of yours. It has the perfect length and there are so many colours we could weave into—traditional braids were made for hair like yours.” Draco doesn’t know what he is talking about, telling Potter of tradition and colourful morsels pinned in hair, but Potter’s breath grows steady under his rambling words so Draco keeps at it, twirling strands between his fingers and thinking of Potter with Draco’s braids in his hair.
Ron makes a straggled noise somewhere, and just like that the decision is made. Disgust, Harry is disgusted. What was he thinking? He needs to get Malfoy out of here.
— Draco sighs. He could go on; he could write up an entire dictionary, and it wouldn’t do Harry justice.

“They are my
Draco is also very aware that they can’t. No matter how perfect this is, how much he wants to see Potter’s eyes flutter close as his mouth opens, just slightly, just enough to be tempting, it wouldn’t be right. Draco is here to save Potter, because Potter is hurt and vulnerable. Draco

Draco watches Pansy play with the most recent of Potter’s alleged strays and wonders what he would say if he could see them now, if he would finally stop bringing these horrid things if he saw Pansy’s open delight. It’s no mystery why Potter seeks to torment him, he is not half as good a liar as he likes to think and he could never resist a chance to make Draco’s life miserable. Bringing in animals that not only hold a ton of bad memories for Draco but also like to bite at anything they can reach — they ruined a pair of his favourite shoes before Draco found a repellent charm that worked against them – is not exactly Potter’s usual method, but Weasley is far too gleeful with every furry bundle he brings over not to be involved. Draco is sure they are congratulating themselves on their genius each time a ferret sneaks up on him and almost startles him into a heart-attack.
Draco pushes the first drawer in, surprised at how heavy it is. Then he moves to push the second one in, too, and finds that he can’t. He just … can’t. There is some sort of stopper, something jammed and—oh, the bowls are too high. Draco can see it now, one of the bowls wedged between the roof of the dishwasher and the bottom of the drawer, stuck unless enormous force is used.
“First of all, just for the record, I am

He remembers a different forest, less snow and less people, only Potter and himself, a useless dog almost as tall as the both of them and no idea what they were doing, searching for a unicorn that was probably going to be dead by the time they found it. Draco had been scared then, too, almost enough to
Draco doesn’t have the words to describe how frustrating that is, not after the sheer endless amount of baby pictures his mother unearthed, and not after the cryptic speech his father gave Harry, running into them on his way out. Draco couldn’t tell what the purpose of that speech was — based on surrounding circumstances, it seems reasonable to assume a warning, but not a single word his father said supports that thesis — holding Harry’s eyes the entire time and talking in grave seriousness about growing flowers, and needing to love and protect them, because otherwise the gardener will be very unhappy. At that point, Draco’s father snapped the huge hedge shears shut in what must have been the most threatening way he could have done, making them all jump, and then, walking out ominously, not losing eye-contact.
Potter definitely wasn’t this closed off out in the shop, where he almost denied Draco entry. It seems like wishful thinking now, that Potter should have been so full of passion as to resent Draco on sight (which is quite a twisted way of thinking, eventually leading to a certain

spent his whole life learning the fine art of casual derision. Some people are simply talented.
Draco sits on the floor, cross-legged and hunched over the ferret held in his arms. There is another ferret pacing on his legs (Harry is reminded of a guard dog, or perhaps a tiger, patrolling their territory) nudging Draco’s sides and knees and rubbing its little head in what appears to be comfort. The third ferret sits in front of their odd arrangement, glaring at Harry as it considers him. Harry stands up straighter on instinct, then immediately feels ridiculous for trying to please a
Harry isn't the one who screwed up, who agreed to a deal and then refused to pay the price. That was Draco, all Draco, so Draco is the one who deserves that tone. They should really know that. Not only are they totally wrong in their assumptions, but they are also attacking Draco’s husband, which Draco is pretty sure he is legally obligated to stop. Even if he didn’t love him, it’s bad form, letting them say mean things about his husband, who Draco swore to love and protect.
Whatever Harry meant in linking Draco and Dudley together like he did, he didn’t mean it as explanation on why Draco should let him go.
Ron explained it to him once, this fierce protection against any ill whispers. They were both very drunk, reminiscing upon the Good Old Times before everything went to hell, and then better again, ostensibly. It was their vicious fight in 4th year, when Ron didn't believe him, and Harry didn’t try hard enough to convince him. Ron said he never wanted that to happen to them again, ever. And because Harry is kind of bad at recognising when people are just a bit too pigheaded to admit they care, avoiding future disasters of that sort is Ron’s responsibility.
Potter isn’t looking at him, though. Potter is, in fact, very busy, completely absorbed in his healing and—as long as Draco doesn’t
of in context of his best friend.
Friends are supposed to lift you up, to support you and make you smile and make this life bearable. Draco is pretty sure that’s their purpose. He must have picked the wrong friends, friends who couldn’t be bothered to look up the definition and instead invented their own.
He’ll be back tomorrow, with new ideas for his new goal.
They have been apart for a few hours, nothing said about finality or separation or breaks, but their marriage feels over all the same. It’s just not official, yet. They have been apart for a few hours, and Draco already misses the git. He misses his laughter and the passion he puts into anything he does, Harry’s tendency to lose his glasses and the simple delight he finds in even the most trivial things, as long as he thinks it would infuriate Draco’s ancestors. He misses his energy, strong and determined, misses his smiles and his smirks and his bad jokes. Draco even misses his hands, warm and steady when they hold him close, the gentle rise and fall of his breathing, the way he cards his fingers through Draco’s hair — Draco misses Harry.
, to be warm and present, and that they can look at each other, if Harry so wanted. He is also going to give Harry a plan, which is good. Of course it is, Ron is a good friend.
Although, watching Potter struggle with his own Muggle thing, Draco isn’t sure he wants one.
thing, and he is the only one of Draco’s miserable gaggle of friends who can’t be accused of the same, so Draco can’t protest, really.
“Wonderful, then get to it.” Granger breaks the moment, blundering between emotions she has no patience for. The bond that she cares about is the contract Draco signed, his signature under the pledge to do all that is possible—that’s all she needs. No promise is better than a contract.
“I really don’t know what you want me to say, mate.” Well, that much for his brilliant plan of letting Ron solve it.
“His friends are all Gryffindors, as inept in dealing with the press as he is. The
“Fine, come on then.” No sooner has Harry said the words that Malfoy climbs on, immediately crawling under the blanket and laying down as far from Harry as possible.
. He is close enough that Draco could count his lashes, could trace where the green of his eyes shifts, not all simply
“No. This one is off limits. Do what you want with the rest of the house, drape it in that hideous Slytherin green if you have to, but not this one.” Harry meets Malfoy’s glare head on. He is not intimidated by his squawking; Harry faced greater opponents over less.
“Malfoy! That would hardly be proper!” Potter, thankfully, is better than Draco at talking through the tension, and he decided not to make this harder on both of them.
Draco watches him in fond exasperation, not even caring as he gets soaked to the bone.

“I don’t need your help! I’ve been doing fine without you, completely fine! I never asked for this, for you to show up
“Potter!” Draco shouts, grateful once more that they are the only people in the park.
. It’s unbearably attractive.
“What?” Draco is pretty sure he heard correctly—he has exceptional hearing, thank you very much—but what Potter said doesn’t make any sense.
, so...”
Sometimes I wonder what they saw in me, who it was they helped.
“Don’t judge my recipe book; it belongs to the house.” Potter gestures at the cabinet where he pulled the book out from, as if that should comfort Draco. (It doesn’t, in case that wasn’t clear. Nothing in this house should be trusted.)
Draco doesn’t allow himself to be rushed, not by Potter’s small noises and not by his own arousal hissing at him to hurry it up, cut to the chase and go where they both want him to be. He ignores his own need, breathes steady and shallow and keeps his senses on Potter, on the way he bites his lip, the tiny whimpers, the fluttering fingers pulling on his hair.
When Potter finally does come back, Draco almost hisses at him for tearing him away from the cool wall. He
inner circle of the family he isn’t privy to. It’s ridiculous and Harry hates it, hates how abruptly that made him feel lonely.
“For reasons I can't fathom, Potter wants to live in Grimmauld Place, which is his by law. Grimmauld, of course, doesn't credit either Sirius' will nor the law, since the law always fancied itself more influential than it is in reality and Walburga disowned Sirius. I would have been very much surprised should his opinion on who is a suitable heir for the House of Black be of any consequence. Potter is desperate enough to marry me to ascertain his own flimsy claim to the property.” Not that Draco is complaining, it would have been far more unsettling had Potter dropped to his knees to profess his unending love.
“I thought you would forget about me, that I would be trapped watching you all enjoy yourself and wait to be judged. I thought you only wanted me there so your friends would stop bothering you about it and everyone would be satisfied I'm as horrible a husband as they decided I would be. I thought you brought me to gloat.” Draco spits the words into Harry’s face, each of them hurting more than the last.
“Almost, though I don’t think the term of flirting can be applied here, not if you define it as a light-hearted exchange of suave words and charming smiles. Judging by what I saw of their recent interactions, their dinner will have to be measured on a completely new scale of awkward and uncomfortable small talk about the weather, interspersed with staggering attempts at conversation and perhaps, if we are very lucky, one or two relatively inspired insults.” Draco despises them all. Pansy especially for being the one who got him into this situation in the first place and now makes fun of him for it. If it wasn't for
“Should just burn this bloody thing down; would be nice and warm, too,” Harry grumbles, turning over and pulling the blanket closer around himself. The temperature drops another few degrees.
is the one who has a right to be upset. Not to be conceited or anything, but Harry at least doesn’t look like a ghost, all pale and scrawny and like he would break if someone were to push him, like a frangible marble statue.
“You are so good, Malfoy, so good for me.” Potter’s words ring loud in Draco’s mind, racing down his spine and tingling in his toes. Draco feels drunk on them, light and giddy when there is nothing light and giddy about him, when he is burning and needy and pushing up into Potter’s hand, chasing these last few inches with ragged breath, fingers twisted in that damned shirt, Potter's shoulders string and steady beneath.
in love with Parkinson!”
Malfoy is stiff in his grip, shoulders tense and perfect to steer him around with. Harry reels him in, just close enough that he can lean over and plant a kiss on Malfoy’s mouth, eyes tightly shut and desperately pretending this is
“Explain again why you are abandoning us for this month’s evening of shocking our parents with the depraved lives we are living,” Blaise asks, deceptively light as he takes a sip of his drink.
was the alternative: there is nothing elegant or appropriate for a ball about this.
Potter’s Weasleys, a bit. Blaise wouldn’t take kindly to being corrected when he just figured it all out and Pansy would latch on to it to distract from the looming contemplation of her feelings. “That’s who Pansy has been flirting with, isn’t it?”
Harry really can’t blame his friends either. He can’t expect them be rushing to make Draco feel welcome while Draco turns his hideout into a throne. And he would, Harry knows Draco a fair bit better these days than he ever did, and he knows with stone cold certainty that that is what Draco would do.
It sounds so very cliché, the hero who cared about limping strays before they were applauded for it, but it’s true nonetheless. Potter cared, wanted the world to be a good place to live in, and fought viciously for what he thought that ‘good place’ ought to look like.
he wasn't, because Ron grew up with six siblings, and one would think that taught him how to negotiate, but, in reality, it only taught him to play dirty and not to hesitate when there is something he wants. The Ron Harry knows never would have been able to commandeer things like this — not this smoothly, not this sure of himself.
Well, never let it said that Harry Potter isn’t dramatic. Draco is certain it will start to rain if he lets Potter brood for long enough. It might be amusing—even the rain is something Draco could enjoy, provided it stays warm—had Potter chosen a different topic to mope about. He is justified in all he said, almost everything, except to presume to know anything about Draco and the way he experiences the world.
Draco wants him as close as possible. Not only does it bode well for his… seduction? Rescue mission? Whatever you want to call it, it will be a lot easier if Harry is amenable to finally
, hands over his mouth to hold the accusations inside. Too late for that, it’s already out in the air, laughing between them, more dangerous than if Draco had just said it.
“Do you think I wasn’t clear enough? Did I miss anything? Is there something more I should have done?” There is something about laying horizontally and gazing up at the ceiling, something that opens channels in brains and makes the whole world seem different. Draco has no idea what he is saying, no idea what he is thinking, but he clutches at Blaise's hand, an anchor that doesn’t seem to help much because would you

“I told you before —” Harry interrupts him, because Draco
“First course is served,” he announces, ignoring Draco’s comment but looking like he wishes him a choking death, murderous enough that Draco fully believes he wanted to hit him over the head earlier. Unbelievable, that Potter thought of dinner as a prime opportunity to lose a husband before Draco did. That’s rather disgraceful, Draco needs to survive this if only to make sure no one ever finds out about his shame.

Perhaps that’s why he doesn’t snap at Weasley, why he takes a deep breath and reminds himself that this is
Draco has also no indention of hurting Harry. He will need to be better, until Harry doesn’t remember how he could ever think Draco and Dudley similar. He doesn’t want Harry to feel second rate standing next to him, he should never have been made to feel like that in the first place, and Draco will see to it that he never feels like it again.
The only surprising part about this is that now, apparently, that person he imagines sharing his life with is
safe, and that they are peacefully sleeping. He remembers that his house hates him and that he woke to someone actually screaming right now and not just a nightmare.
“Come here, Harry, let me hug you.” Draco prays the nail polish had enough time to dry, finds he doesn’t care if he smears it all over his clothes, and pulls Potter in for a hug that the man immediately falls into.
It would be incredibly easy to go back to hating him for that. But Harry can’t go back, because he knows what he didn’t before, that it’s not arrogance (not
legs?” Theo’s question, though no less earnest in his offering of the same unquestioned loyalty, makes them laugh and dispels the tension that grew somewhere between Draco’s sullen remark and Blaise’s suggestion.
Really, this sex thing could become a mutually beneficial agreement, with the added advantage of getting Grimmauld off his back.
Draco definitely needs Pansy there. She is the best moral support he has among his friends, disheartening as the thought is. Theo would straight up refuse, Draco got himself into this mess and he might not have the backbone to say no to Harry’s green eyes, but Theo certainly can. Blaise would be charming and brilliant and flirt with everyone and utterly humiliate Draco, giving them all blackmail material enough to justify a murder, of both Blaise and them. He’d probably think it
They were both dressed in tailored black robes in the latest fashion, which opened at the front to reveal black, equally tailored trousers. Harry's eyes moved against his will straight to Malfoy. He had never seen him in anything but the traditional robes. The trousers made his legs seem long and strong, and the cut of the robes accentuated his narrow waist in contrast to his shoulders. Harry's gaze ran up and down on him twice before Harry noticed a small cough coming from Zabini's side and turned to him.
In here, he was easily the dumbest person in the room. It was a feeling he didn’t often have anymore, especially in the last few years. And it was so obvious to anyone. A few people always treated him with a hero-worshipping fascination, but the number was steadily declining eleven years after the war, and besides, Harry tended to avoid those people. But to most, he was only here as one thing: Draco Malfoy’s arm candy.
was the hottest thing Draco had ever seen. “I want so much to make you come right now!”
Potter!
"No. No, it's not. It was even longer before that for me, I just wouldn't admit it. But I wasn't ready then, not for anything. Certainly not for you."
if he was to do all the adjustments.
“Before you ask, this is Robin Hood, the entire story told in animals. I think you should go find a mirror,” Weasley-the-bear suggest, and Draco feverishly prays for all the mirrors to be gone from this world. Whatever Weasley meant, talking about red, Draco dreads it enough to avoid vanity for the duration of his stay.
Harry abandons his tea as I enter the kitchen. He smiles, salutes like he does Conspiracy-Theory-Neighbour. Harry leaves, surrenders the kitchen so I, too, can leave.
That… Harry doesn’t know what to do with that, but it sounds fake. It sounds completely absurd and naive — Ron must be joking! Surely, he must!
Draco saying?
“Afraid so.” Weasley doesn’t sound afraid, grinning from ear to ear.
, Potter?” Draco does indeed not look like the sort, no.
Potter doesn’t need to know he has Draco cornered.

Harry had no idea what a Lord was (he had an idea but was unsure if the muggle version of lord applied to wizards), which boggled Corvus and prompted an educational discussion over lunch—they found a café called Witch's Brew Café to dine in.
. It was the first of many attempts but he never got as far as he did the first time, actually ending up in the neighbourhood next to them. He would always get caught by either patrolling policemen or a concerned, if not strange, adult that would always send him back to Four Privet Drive… even though he never told them where he lived. But he doesn’t remember ever meeting anyone that first time he ran away. He just knew he did and that wonderful feeling of adrenaline and bursting hope and then the next thing he knew, he was back in his cupboard under the stairs.
when Vernon opens the door and—it's the mailman.
There was Ceely, the female house-elf and the leader of the group. Ceely had red hair in pigtails, brown eyes and wore a light orange uniform with the Potter crest stitched on the breast. She handled the lands and maintenance. Caddey, her brother, was also red-haired, with blue eyes, and handled storage and kept the bedrooms. Cepky, the remaining house-elf, had darker red hair than his siblings and had green eyes. He was the designated cook of the group and was most keen to feed young master Harry the grandest of feasts.
Harry Potter wakes up that day like every other day, his cousin Dudley jumping on the stairs above the cupboard, the sound echoing and loud, dust is falling on Harry's hair and face.
Alrod gave a sharp grin.
"Gringotts apologizes for the delay, Chief Warlock Dumbledore. We had sent all of our summonses at the same time,"
"As it is, the Potters' will reading is about to commence. I suggest you take a seat, Chief Warlock." Alrod gestures to the seats.
For anyone confused at the bedroom part, as there were two of them, the Dursleys had them sleep together in the smallest bedroom, before they placed Harry in the cupboard under the stairs when he was 5, after Corvus got adopted.
It turns out, they don’t need stairs; they have carts that go down rails in rollercoaster fashion. The fast twists and turns had Harry gripping tightly to his seat, heart beating almost as fast as the cart itself, and a grin threatening to split his face in half. The sharp turns they take made giggles escape his lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
Shocked silence filled the room. Where did one even start? Harry watched his godparents and honorary uncle as his father's will was read. They had different reactions from each other.
Harry didn't even flush, having someone so important see how barren his room was, knowing Corvus would understand. Still, he was glad that they would be leaving soon, as he didn't want his cousin having to be subjected to the Dursleys all over again and having to stay in this small, rundown room.
W H E E Z E
Harry stares at Alrod, mind racing a million thoughts, eyes glazing over before clearing again. He relaxes and his eyes lose their intensity, nodding once.
Seeing Harry packing up, Alrod stands. “Shall we go to the vaults, Harry?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Remus frowned, glancing back at Harry concernedly. Remus turned back to Alrod, worry only deepening.
The attic was dark and dusty, clearly left to itself for a few years now. Harry moves to check the boxes and old furniture. He finds several clothes from when uncle Vernon and aunt Petunia were young—apparently, uncle Vernon had always been big. He finds some other things not worth much, like fancy but old hairbrushes, hair accessories that are very out of date, and Dursley family photo albums.
trial). Dumbledore and the professors came out next, a subdued headmaster nodding to Alrod in passing while Minerva and Filius Flitwick said their goodbyes, Sprout trailing behind them.
"We are now to hear the last will of the late Lord James Fleamont Potter and the late Lady Lily Joanna Potter. You are to keep quiet and all questions to yourselves until the will reading is done or you will be silenced in your seat if not thrown out for the disruption of an official will reading of a Lord and Lady of an Ancient and Noble House." Alrod seemed to stare pointedly at Dumbledore at this.
The chair tumbles to the ground as Vernon Dursley stands up abruptly. Harry doesn't wait for him to fully get to his feet—a downside to being overweight was the amount of effort it took to get up—and bolts up the stairs and to his room. He locks it—Vernon forgot to remove that one and lost the key, luckily—just as Vernon reaches the door and starts pounding.
The goblin nodded in acceptance and then turned to Harry, "Your key, Heir Potter?" Harry handed his key and the goblin called out to another goblin to escort the Potters.
A letter. He should write a letter, reply back to him. He has no idea what to write but as he makes his way to the desk and grabs a bit of parchment and a biro pen, he realizes he doesn't really need to
“Ready, Harry?” At the wizard in question’s nod, Alrod placed the parchment which held the will and memory of Lily Potter onto the sphere, the parchment disappearing within the sphere in a flash of light. Before long, a white mist flows from the sphere, forming into a misty miniature version of Lily on top of the sphere.
“Yes, and regarding our other Houses; I’m sure you’ve noticed that the Gaunts do not have vaults written in your test?” Alrod waits for Harry’s nod before he continues. “That is because the Gaunts went bankrupt ages ago and after two decades of no incoming monies, Gringotts closed it, as is the policy of Gringotts.”
They immediately remove Dumbledore, though, as Harry's Magical Guardian, and changes it to Corvus, which was perfectly legal as Corvus was emancipated, Lord, and Harry's close blood relative. Just because Harry believes Albus Dumbledore to be a great wizard and necessary for the safety of their world, did not ease the pain and sting of his perceived betrayal, his secrets, and his carelessness in regards to Harry's care and wellbeing. Just because Harry believed Dumbledore to be their greatest shot and defence against Voldemort did not mean that Harry would trust the headmaster again, like he once did, only days ago.
Harry deduced that he was rich, being the Lord of various Houses, and having multiple vaults, properties, and investments. Harry just did not know until now that he was ‘
Harry is surprised his head is still working.
My head was a right mess while I was writing this chapter—it was aching and everything. I apologize if there are some mistakes in this chapter! I took a lot of breaks while I was writing, though, so don't worry!
“Yes, Lord Potter. Horcruxes were made with the intention to escape death, using a method of tying down a soul fragment upon a container until it has ended its purpose or it has been destroyed. It will latch on to the mortal realm through the means of containers or hosts even, to further escape death.”
Mind made up, he glanced back at Alrod.
"I want these rectified and removed, immediately!" Corvus exclaimed, handing the test to Uldrick a bit forcefully. Uldrick frowned at him but Corvus did not notice as he had begun patting Harry down, checking him all over and asking him if he was fine—he wasn't but he felt he was handling it better than he would've, had circumstances been different.
"Nah—I'm you," he shrugs unceremoniously. Little Harry's eyes widens.
“The Black Accounts do have an Account Manager, his name is Bloodsmear. As for the Peverell Account. It has been dormant for centuries and so has not required an Account Manager until now. Should I recommend someone for you, Lord Potter?”
Harry would not do the same to himself, young as he may be.
He finds an old and slightly tattered blue backpack. He goes to the attic, seeing if he could score something there. He's never been to the attic before. His aunt never really let him; it made him curious.
A light supper over with, along with another round of potions, and Harry found himself in the shrunken nightclothes of his father. It smelled of pine, kiwi, and a faint scent that Harry swears he caught a whiff of in the broom closet.
When he catches sight of the owl, Harry almost breaks out in tears. He squeezes his eyes shut and raises his hand with the letter in the air. He hears the beat of wings and Harry opens his eyes to see the owl taking the letter and flying away. Harry stares at the owl fade away into the distance until he couldn't even see the dot of its existence.
“You see, there is a clause to Lordships, Lord Potter, and all Lords lose this when they otherwise die or become convicted. No Lord can continue being a Lord if they are convicted as a criminal,” Alrod explains, watching as the young Lord Potter stiffens, mind whirling in thought.
Harry found it after a bit of walking and his breath caught. Gringotts was both magnificent and daunting, and Harry stared at the leaning building before squaring his shoulders and going up the steps.
Harry Potter leaves 4 Privet Drive that day with no intention of ever returning.
They find themselves in a cavern, a ritual room within Gringotts, with a waterfall that would have taken Harry's breath if it wasn't gone already. As it was, Harry was focused on maintaining his cool as he was directed to lay on a stone slab, a white sheet the only thing covering his modesty among a group of goblins surrounding him. It had been decided that a team of goblin curse-breakers would work on Harry, a request from the Potter-Black Heir, who, to the astonishment and bemusement of the goblin team when they were informed of the reason, felt safer and more secure in their hands. They were currently preparing the room for the cleansing, purifying, and purging ritual. Harry dropped his head to the side, glancing at the corner of the room where Corvus stood.
People, I have another inquiry! It is one I have been stumped over, time and time again! And I need your help this time!
Dumbledore was similarly shocked at the news. His heart clenched at the thought that Sirius was in Azkaban for a crime he did not commit. Poor Sirius, who had been his student and then had been his ally in the Order. The old headmaster was near in tears, to know that he had failed Sirius so. When he had first learned of the Potters' death and how Sirius had been the one to betray them, his heart had broken for the bright young man he had once known and thought he knew. He had turned away from Sirius, forcing him out of his thoughts, ignoring the heartbreak of friends turning against each other, a tune Albus was overly familiar with. But now? All along, Sirius was not the traitor who betrayed his friends to Voldemort. And now Albus' heart was breaking again, this time because of his own actions—
“You are aware of Albus Dumbledore’s multiple titles, yes? One of his titles is Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. They are an intergovernmental organization. They are in charge of many things, such as maintaining international peace and security. An organization such as this, also have an agency or department responsible for children support and aid. For orphans with no one to go to, the ICW is the one to provide and help them to find and get settled in a new home and family. You are an orphan but by no means do you have no place to go to.”
"Can it be removed?" He asked.
Half an hour later, Harry was as dry as a prune and cleaner than he's ever been. He had never felt so relaxed. Harry thought to himself that he might just get addicted to baths, ridiculous the notion might be. Well, it wasn't as if anyone would know—and no Dursleys to make deprive him of so.
Uldrick narrowed his eyes, "Heir Potter does not know who his guardian is?" Harry shook his head negative.
Ron and Malfoy aware that their actions were uncalled for. But then the next day came and Malfoy had glared and sneered at him, and Harry resolved to have nothing to do with the prat unless necessary. That, too, did not work out as planned.
Wrapping his arms around his knees and hiding his face in his arms, Harry gives a teary laugh and whispers, "...
Harry supposes that he will just have to live it for him. It was the best that he could do.
Everyone else was also in a state of shock and disbelief. Minerva was shocked that, all along, she was Harry Potter's godmother. She had not known and the thought that little Harry could have been living with her and not with those muggles positively broke her heart. Why wasn't she told of this? Remus, as well, was shocked at what he had received from Lily but no so much as he was shocked to find out that Sirius wasn't the secret-keeper. Peter Pettigrew was the secret-keeper and the one who betrayed the Potters to You-Know-Who, not Sirius Black. Amelia cursed when she realized that Black was in Azkaban for a crime that wasn't his and wondered to all nine hells how the Ministry was not aware of this.
Surprisingly, Alrod answers, “No.”
Severus wanted to cry. He wanted to scream, to rage, and to find himself at the bottom of a bottle—
Harry frowned and stared at the floor, cracking his head to try and remember if there was ever an instance where his physical appearance made a drastic change when his eyes widened and glanced up at the Potter Manager.
Soon enough, the pair finished their breakfast and Harry was setting up to go. Harry decided to take his messenger bag since it had an expanding charm, which would surely help in his shopping. He'd go visit the bank after, or if he ran out of money, perhaps give Alrod a gift, for all his help—maybe even one for Healer Gurkrat. He'd have to talk about Grimmauld and Grim House, too.
"I have given you a month's worth, up until you go to Hogwarts. All chargers have been taken from your account."
Currently, though, Harry was at a corner of Alrod's office, shrouded in Disillusionment Charms, Notice-Me-Not, and Silencing ward. Harry, as Lord Potter, would, of course, be present at his parents' will reading, even if he'd heard it already. He had also wanted to see the beneficiaries, his parents' friends and teachers, some of whom were also his godparents. He would like to meet them, perhaps even talk to them. Alrod agreed for Harry to use the office to greet and talk with them, afterwards.
. So with a dejected nod, he left the adults to it. He let the voices of the adults, his godfather, godmother, mother-in-law of his other godmother, and honorary uncle discuss with his Account Manager about dealing with the Dursleys (and how Severus raged when he learned that Harry was living with Petunia of all people), and how they wanted to avenge Harry's childhood.
Uncle Vernon shoves the envelope to Harry's face, showing every bit of it covered in stamps. Harry's lips twitched upward as he valiantly fought off a smile. Uncle Vernon noticed and Harry straightened his spine immediately, his uncle's spittle flying as he shouts at him.
Harry continues.
Alrod makes a humming noise. “Not necessarily but many have tried to use it for more dastardly deeds; enough so that Ministry had it all outlawed, instead of just certain aspects of it.”
"How may Gringotts help you, wizards?" The teller asked. Corvus reached out within his pocket and handed the goblin a letter. The goblin teller read through the contents before giving a sharp nod.
Showing all the love, reassurance, and confidence he had through his eyes, Corvus gave a soft and small smile for his cousin, reassuring him with his presence. It seems to work as Harry visibly relaxes. He gives Corvus one last glance before drawing one big breath and moving his head to face the ceiling. The goblin curse-breakers start to chant, just as light starts to glow from the runes, Harry's eyes flutter closed just as the light travels through all the runes surrounding him and on his body, the goblins' chanting reaching a crescendo.
Corvus just smirks and states in a loud voice, "Minors can't use their wands outside of schools, yes, but as I haven't received a letter from Hogwarts yet, I am not a student so that law doesn't apply to me—not to mention, as an emancipated Wizard, I have free use to use my wand wherever I go, so long as I don't get caught."
that was spreading in waves coming from his cousin. Strangely, seeing his usually calm and collected older cousin losing his temper settled the nerves that Harry was feeling. Oh, he still felt completely and utterly betrayed, not to mention confused and wholly lost. There were some things on his test that he did not understand, like the curse scar, the life debts, or the—Merlin, what even—marriage contract between him and
Harry was just setting up breakfast when someone rang the doorbell. Everyone froze for a second before Uncle Vernon and Harry made a mad dash for the door. Sadly, Harry was on the other side of the table and Vernon's big build prevented Harry passage in the hallway. Harry glares at the back of his uncle's head and contemplates jumping on his back
’ it seemed to say.
“And what of my other guardians—my godparents, you say—what’s the deal with them?”
“And if they find me… unfit?” Harry asks as he opens the box. Inside lies a black signet ring, hollow in a way that it had lines like veins or roots, spiraling to make a ring and a flat surface to hold a signet, the Peverell Crest etched on the surface.
Everyone noticed how the goblin failed to go into details about the 'issues' that he mentioned. Harry huffed quietly to himself, growing a sense of awareness about his account manager's sense of humour. The others probably didn't notice how the goblin did it on purpose to pull on their legs.
Panting, he stares at the floor of his cupboard, his letter and the piece of paper he slipped in still lying there, Harry's key to freedom. He doesn't even care if there rests so much on his shoulders if he accepts the letter, anywhere was better than Privet Drive.
"Corvus, this isn't funny! Minors aren't allowed to use magic outside of school!" Harry whisper-yells, glancing at the Dursleys whom had huddled together at the other end of the living room.
The Peverell box was a black stone with gold linings, spiraling on the edges, and the crest in the middle front; etched in the stone, a circle within a triangle, and a vertical line in the middle.
When the Dursleys return that day, they find an old cardboard box that once held the Potters' belongings, and an empty house.
Harry nods. “About these house-elves… It seems I have a lot of these; what exactly are they?”
He was directed to lay back and when Harry laid his head on the pillow, he forgot all about the taste as his eyes started to flutter shut.
The Dursley couple were sitting in the living room when they descended, Vernon watching the telly and Petunia reading a magazine, Dudley was nowhere to be seen—probably ran off to a friend's house to hide, Corvus thought with a snort. The Dursleys' head snapped to them at the sound. Harry bit down a smile but Corvus showed no such hesitation in showing his amusement, smirking as aunt Petunia paled, bony fingers clutching at her magazine, and uncle Vernon pursed his lips and glared, a red tint appearing on his cheeks.
he thought derisively.
He also bought some non-essentials. Entertainment and hobby things. Art materials like sketchpads, pencils, graphite, charcoal, and colouring pencils, paints, and other stationeries. Harry had always enjoyed art, though he didn't do much of it. Perhaps, he could do so now that he was free from the Dursleys. He also got an Apple Arrow tee, to commemorate the first quidditch team he'd ever been a fan of. He didn't know what quidditch was when he first bought it but he got a book about it so he'd learn it anyways. He had also bought other books, some from Flourish and Blotts (which were mostly academic), which were comprised of information a muggle-raised wizard and a Lord of multiple Houses like him would need, and some from Nook of Books which was in Horizont Alley, which were more information on the wizarding world, as well as fiction books and anything else that caught his attention.
Alrod sneered at him still, "We will have to prove this, Mister Potter, I am sure you are aware. Where is your vault key?"
"Did," Harry cut him off, "You know?"
Hedwig returns the next night, at Midnight, with birthday cards from Ron and Hermione. The Dursleys let him out the same day, on his birthday, so he could get back to work—er, his chores, on his birthday, like he does every year. He had a wonderful time telling them about the impending return of Harry's favorite (as if there was competition) cousin. He struggled to hide his smile when they paled; it was totally worth having his uncle screaming at him about how they would not accept more freaks into his perfectly normal home.
Harry's heart lurched to his throat. Could it be—
Harry sits down as another goblin enters from another door in the room, bringing with him a black piece of parchment and a silver knife. He places it at the table and stands to one side.
The goblin, who was shocked at the respectful display the ratty-looking child had shown, blinked at Harry's words. He narrowed his eyes at the boy, staring at his forehead and on his hidden scar.
Instead they got yelled at and Malfoy flinched, pulling back from Harry and taking his kissable lips and the pretty flowers with him.
Harry never wanted anything more than needing to buy that bed. Draco would have grumbled about it, would have complained about not getting any sleep anymore with all the tiny people in their bed, but he also would have hidden a tiny smile and allowed their children absolutely any of the blankets they wanted, making Harry carry them all.
“And you feed her?” Draco asks, growing smug as Potter nods, begrudgingly. “Do you pet her when she is sad?”
He steps forward, ready to save Potter one final time.
, who seems to be the exception to every rule Draco ever held.
The light swings dangerously, casting false shadows on the delicate violin Potter preferred over Draco. For one horrifying—oddly satisfying—moment, Draco thinks they are going to crash into the table, ruining all of Potter’s work and giving him nothing but Draco to focus on. (Draco, that is, and the damage he caused.)
In conclusion, no one was all that excited to hear that Draco would join them in watching a movie today. Where Draco was restless and frantically checking his hair and tugged his selves, their guests had what Draco likes to call ‘the moral righteousness of winners’. Somehow Harry doubts it’s a compliment. It’s part of this big angry rant about social context for grudges (as in, the good guys can do whatever they want and the bad guys will be glared at for sneezing too loudly; Harry summarised and simplified for himself about the third time Draco muttered about it) and the much more familiar ‘bloody smug Gryffindors’.
Malfoy is going to fix this or Malfoy is going to sleep on the streets. Either way, Harry wins. That will be nice, even better than the ferrets.
“Second,” Potter counts a second finger, “she’s not
They are completely unrealistic, of course. Draco tries not to dwell on them.
“Since you asked so nicely — Capt'n was my first toy, a stuffed dragon as blue as the sky and wings big enough to wrap myself up in. But Capt’n was lonely, and I begged my parents for friends for her. They gently tried to explain that
, or even just friendly, but surely it’s not too much to believe that Draco would recognise the opportunity to do something Good and—more importantly—actually
Draco reaches for the script he has prepared for these conversations, when no words seem right and there is no delicate way of saying something. He can at least not make it worse by blundering around with unclear phrasings.
, they don’t plan anything, much less something involving subtlety. It must be the hero-complex — why do something with no one knowing? Who is supposed to applaud? Draco should have expected Harry would off-handedly discard that tiny, crucial word discretion.
“Right, I’m going to fuck him then.” Ron chokes again and Harry takes pity on him but really, he thinks Ron exaggerated on this one.
“Yeah, mate, and you orchestrated this whole scene for him,” Ron adds, looking around in consideration, judging how much effort put into antagonising someone is too much effort. He says it as if it’s a revelation, as if organising Malfoy’s arrival as unpleasant as possible wasn’t the crucial argument of holding movie night here.
“I'm not sure if the next years were coloured by my judgement or if you really were that insufferable, but it all screamed of the cousin I hated.” Harry stops again, and this time it feels more monumental, more final than the other times. Harry isn’t pausing to order his next thoughts, Harry is done talking.
Actually, Harry has a good idea of what Draco is talking about. Harry doesn't like it, but Draco doesn’t exactly use ambiguous words, and while he might like to call Harry stupid, he really isn’t. No, Harry hears him loud and clear, little as he likes it, but it’s early enough that he can get away with denying the truth before he will be forced to face it.
“That’s not the same, you died to save the world, not me specifically.” Draco swallows as memories come barging in, intruding where they aren’t wanted.
“You planned to divorce me and elope with the circus?” Harry blurts out, which expresses exactly nothing of what Draco probably needs to hear right now. Instead Harry managed to focus on the least important detail, on the part explicitly mentioning him and makes Draco’s entire confession about that. This is why Harry shouldn’t be allowed emotional talks — he is no good with them.
Still, Harry spent all his life defying what self-important people want him to be, and he has no intentions of bowing his head to some old crook who wouldn’t spit on Hermione if she burned. Harry would much rather they find a way around these archaic rules and make them seethe.
‘GILDEROY LOCKHART KIDNAPPED BY THESTRALS!’ the headline reads, plastered over the whole page. The article (Harry is generous calling it an article, mostly because he doesn’t know a better word) details on how Lockhart — apparently recovered from his dangerous position as Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, which Harry didn’t know about — has gone missing, leaving behind only a lock of his hair and a hastily written note to communicate his abduction. The whole thing seems very dodgy to Harry, but the smile is promising to give him nightmares if he looks at it for much longer, so he quickly moves on.
recognise a challenge when he sees one. This is a test, one Draco is sure Harry will fail. Just as with the tickling. Harry is determined to not prove Draco right again.
“Most of it should be easy enough, though you will have to quit complaining about me to your friends, seeing how pure-blood marriages are closer to alliances and those need to present a united front.” That’s something of an exaggeration, Draco must admit, but he doesn’t like the thought of Potter badmouthing him in his own house. He doesn’t like the thought of Potter badmouthing him in general, people have the unfortunate tendency to take his word as gospel, but Draco can’t really stop Potter from doing it altogether. A minor technicality he doesn’t intend to point out.
Next to the gross food stuff, there are more spoons than Draco thought Potter’s kitchen could hold, a few knives and twice as many bowls, the weird Muggle mixing thing Potter insisted on using over magic and that got splatters on the walls, measuring cups of different sizes and different residues, plates and cups (for the eggs, Potter was rather smug when Draco didn’t know how to split an egg on a cup, until Potter tried to show him and messed it up so badly that he started the graveyard of eggs all around) and, unsurprisingly, ever more spoons.
Harry wakes to a blood curling scream. For one second, he is back in that tent, back in the woods and on the run. He is back to the uncertainty and the fear hanging palpable in the air, though none of them acknowledged it. He is back to the middle of the war, to knowing that people are dying on a daily basis while he is
help, that he is fine and even if he weren’t, he isn’t going to accept the hand of someone who might not be his enemy anymore, but is certainly not his friend, not someone allowed to see him vulnerable.
things — there is no way she can call him out on it.
“And here we are! I suggest you start with the parlour, they aren’t
Until his eyes land on the expiry date, then he has to suppress a truly inappropriate laugh.
Before Draco can protest—Potter does
Instead of letting gravity drag him into the light, Draco flails and clings to Harry. It seems like a brilliant idea for all but one victorious moment, when Harry loses his balance and they are both falling.
Then Draco starts moving and the moment shatters.
that thing? It's always in the way and hoards dust and garbage, aesthetically unappealing and cumbersome — Draco flops down onto the soft cushioning in a truly ungraceful move he’d be mortified by if it didn’t make Harry smile every time, just a little bit.
Potter is indeed very close. He leans over Draco, a concentrated scowl on his face—tongue stuck out to the side and all; it’s adorable—as he stares at Draco’s nose, watching it carefully like it might burst out into spontaneous bleeding unless supervised. Draco doesn’t feel guilty about taking this prime opportunity to do a little intense scrutiny of his own, scanning Potter’s face for wounds and settling on gazing into his eyes when he doesn’t find any, imagines bringing up a hand to smooth out the wrinkles of concentration on Potter’s forehead.
Better yet: Draco is going to deny all of this. It’s more than likely that Harry is teasing him, that he doesn’t know his mother at all. Yes, that must be it. Harry thinks he is clever and hilarious, congratulating himself to a prank well played. He doesn’t know Draco’s mother and he is not going to see any embarrassing pictures of Draco. Yes, exactly. Draco nods, satisfied with the result he settled on.
the furniture. Your magic would interfere with their own charms and spells and concoct something dreadful.” Malfoy nods along decisively, already leading them out of the kitchen as he talks. Harry, because apparently he is an idiot and doesn’t even attempt to think of a good excuse, follows him.
Ron — the brilliant, compassionate, far too forgiving friend that he is — nods in acknowledgement of all the that Harry didn’t say, smiles in a silent reassurance that he understands, that it’s alright, and answers the question.
Draco lifts his head, inclines it towards Potter and his tempting, tempting lips, curled into a smile of anticipation and satisfaction. Why didn’t they do this sooner? Draco can almost feel Potter’s kiss already, his eyes fluttering shut on their own accord so as to better focus on the sensation of Potter against him—and then a violent wave pushes through Potter, starting in his stomach and hiccuping out of his mouth, onto Draco.
“Potter, are you still with us?” Draco isn’t sure he wants an answer to that question.
Which doesn’t mean he can’t dream of the gamble turning out well — as if Harry could stop if he wanted — but dreaming has long since stopped being a mere option and become something of a necessity. Harry can’t help it, he hears Draco’s vague hum and imagines what Draco might have said if things were different, wonders if Draco would go tense when Harry touches him without warning, if they had discussed boundaries instead of building them without maps in the murky vast of human relationships. Perhaps Harry would sleep better if he wasn’t weighted down by new guilt, wake up without falling into panic when Draco is already gone from their bed.
“No, me neither, nothing but pitch-black darkness.” Harry reaches out for Draco, pulls him closer under the blankets.
“I’m sorry too. I might have overreacted.” The words don’t come easy to Draco, though they are true. “Also, for future references, not a fan of water. The lake all around us was responsible for at least half my bad mood.”
“The instrument doesn’t like you,” Potter declares, still frowning. “They are moody beasts who don’t like anyone except me.”
“Purely hypothetical question: how many plants do you think you could fit into your apartment?” Draco doesn’t look at Potter, very pointedly looks at the flower sitting between them and grants Potter as much time as he needs for the switch in conversation.
As Ron does nothing more interesting than grumbling too low for their curious audience to understand and mopping up his spilt beer (and Harry casts a discreet charm to remind them all they have more pressing matters to attend to) the hubbub dies down rather quickly.
“I almost died the last time, isn’t that enough for you?” Draco doesn’t think anymore that he would have died on that rooftop, not even if Potter was as angry with him as he thought. Potter doesn’t leave anyone behind, not even those he can’t stand.
He feels safe once the door is closed. It’s not
That was to be expected. It might not be too early but they didn’t sleep until late and, as far as Harry can see, Draco isn’t a morning person either if he doesn’t have a packed schedule and drank too much caffeine. What Draco does do, however, is stretch himself, languidly, like a cat, yawning again and nestling back against Harry. If Harry weren’t already sold on morning cuddles, that would have done it.
Harry doesn’t understand the importance of going undetected, strangely
“It took me entirely too long to realise Draco didn’t trust me. It seems laughably obvious now — of course Draco didn’t trust me! I was just that sleazy guy violating him, tying him up in the deals we struck. I thought we had something good, that we might genuinely grow to… grow to
Draco nods again, enthusiastic this time because yes, that’s what he wanted! It was a good plan!

Draco twists, Harry jumps, and then Harry is dragged over the back of the couch, landing in the world’s most uncomfortable sprawl on the couch.
it, he planned to strike a few tones, nothing more, just to see how much he remembered. He tightened the bow and settled the violin and gently ran along the first string—immediately, he was lost. There was some minor tuning that needed doing and really, Draco reasoned that would be polite, make up the blundering mistake of playing Potter’s violin without the man even aware, but Draco did the tuning and he found his place among the notes and he
that Harry imagined in his plan, of spouse and friend and someone to raise children with and invite the neighbours over for barbecue. Malfoy is, well, none of these things. Except spouse, or soon to be spouse.
He isn’t stupid, he does have a pretty good idea of it (Parkinson all snuggled up to his husband, doesn’t take Sherlock Holmes to figure that one out) but that doesn’t make any sense. Draco is not only gay (Harry
But dinner is done now, Blaise said so himself, so Draco sees no reason to put up with it any longer.

indication that this is really what he wants) and probably wouldn’t consider having children if they would grow up to cure cancer — wait, isn’t Malfoy expected to continue the bloodline? He will
“Because, Potter, you are describing an owl. They have spooky eyes and beaks that hurt a lot when they pick at you but really, they are smarter than you give them credit for. You need to treat her better and perhaps she won’t try to murder you again.” It’s probably as simple as that, in the end. Potter was pissed after their fight, treated Athebyne with very little of the charm he is capable of, and their relationship has never fully recovered because Potter is socially inept.
The dragon is huge, not a species that Draco recognises and an aggressive shade of purple. Draco is pretty sure it’s not a real dragon, the Muggle idea of what dragons might look like but not one of the species Draco studied in his youth, obsessed with his namesakes. There was even a time he considered defying his father to become a Dragon Tamer, spending his every day with the magnificent creatures.
Draco glares up at him, pinned to the bed by Harry's hand pressing down on his chest where Harry both props himself up and keeps Draco out of any potential danger. The panic that woke Harry is no longer as loud but it’s still there and — oh, that’s his fault, because Harry woke up like the crazy soldier haunted by the war that he tries so hard not to be. Of course, Draco doesn’t appreciate it! Harry should let him go, should apologise and lay back down and act like all is completely normal, hope that Draco won’t comment.
This is either brilliant or terrible, and Harry hesitates between the two for too long to throw her out. He refuses to take the complete blame for
“You wish,” Potter replies, their little dance, and that’s all the confirmation Draco needs.
Oh! Does Potter think—but how? How does he look at their time spent together and
“Draco, darling, not that listening to your latest flirtations with Potter described in incredible detail isn’t my idea of a fun night out,” Pansy says, interrupting Draco mid-sentence with a heavy sigh and dark red pout. Draco gets the feeling she might not be entirely sincere in her assurances of enjoyment. “But did you have a point in ordering us all here and relegating us with further proof of your embarrassing infatuation with our resident hero?”
with the owl, as long as he gets rid of all irrefutable evidence. Except for Pansy, who is utterly fearless and feeds the devil with her bare hands, they’ve all had unfortunate dealings with Osbourne. None of them are keen on discussing the details, much less having it brought up again and again. So, Draco doesn’t mention it and instead shoots Theo a discreet charm to take care of the mess. Pansy is so busy defending the honour of her beast of a bird that she doesn’t care about something as trivial as cleaning charms right now. Theo, though, Theo
Draco leaves and he can taste Potter’s disdain like bile in his mouth, cruel words echoing in his mind, laughing, taunting him.
“How could it be cheating if I never claimed anything else?” That is … actually, that is unfairly correct. Technically.
But there is more, something isn’t quite right here, something in the way Harry treats the most basic of Draco’s furniture, that alludes to a truth Draco only ever heard in whispered gossip. A truth of cruel muggle relatives, of tiny rooms and not enough food. Draco thought it was nothing but sensationalism, something to explain the scrawny figure of their hero. He spread a few rumours himself, something — in hindsight rather uninspired — about a torture chamber in the Potter mansion, but they were
“I never said anything about seduction,” Draco interjects when it’s far too late. It was too late the moment Pansy got the idea in her head, but Draco would like it on the record that
It does the trick though. Draco grimaces at the thought of burned tea and Harry doesn’t fear he’ll be pushed out of bed to make breakfast now. He also, unfortunately, doesn’t like the unhappy pout on Draco's face one bit.
Draco startles so badly that he lets the paper fall, shooting upright and eyes frantically searching until settling on Harry, identifying him as the intruder. Harry might have been exaggerating on how well they live together.
That includes making sure Draco knows what is he doing, that he is willing to give Potter at least as much of himself as Potter is giving him. It’s going to be difficult, given how they walked through some of Potter’s biggest fears to get here, but Draco fully intends to create an even relationship between them.
“It’s not
he sees what he sees, what inspired the pure joy or what new terribly scandalous thing Harry did to earn Draco’s indignation, but he can interpret what Draco says or doesn’t say as easily as if he came with a lexicon. Harry would give the world to have witnessed Draco read the letter (and, if you could be so kind, another copy of that letter because, really, Harry remembers absolutely nothing of its contents).
Malfoy. They just want to — I don’t know, get to know you a bit.” Potter is frustrated, prowling the room like a caged tiger and gesticulating wildly.
For Draco, things are more complicated.
—with the appropriate ceremony, but if you insist on prying …”
The back rooms are worse. Draco was in there only once and he
He knows Potter though, knows that he will insist on this solely to annoy Draco as soon as he realises how much Draco would like to avoid it, so maybe it’s best he never knows. Perhaps Draco could simply join them for one of their insipid … movie nights? He is pretty sure that is what Potter calls them, where they all usurp the living room and stare at that dreadful Muggle appliance Potter revelled in installing. They will all be busy talking amongst themselves and watching the loud box play out whatever it is they chose that evening and Draco will be forgotten, perfectly blended in and able to ward off any possible questions with the excuse of watching the tiny people fight for their lives. That’s actually a pretty brilliant plan, Draco should seriously consider that.
is the thanks he gets? Unbelievable. He needs better friends, kind and supporting ones who lie to him about his chess abilities and don’t try to push him into a happy marriage with Potter.
“That doesn’t seem particularly fair to me, I have the distinct impression you would be the first to laugh at me had I lost the bet. You wouldn’t have claimed part if
Harry has no idea where they are going, isn’t even sure where they are at all anymore, but that hardly matters. Harry follows Draco. Left, right, down flights of stairs and then right again — just as Harry starts to wonder if Draco is leading him around in hopes of getting rid of him, always avoiding his real destination to keep it secret, Draco enters a room.
“Because then you would have handed it to Longbottom without even looking and then you would have recommended a flower shop you have never been to. Does that sound like good manners to you?” Draco gently steers Potter through the busy streets, one hand always on the small of his back as he directs him.
Dear Potter,
at him, measuring and judging, seeing someone Draco does his best not to be anymore, someone scared and cruel and arrogant. Someone who doesn’t stand a chance at being found worthy. Granger doesn’t owe him anything, isn’t obligated to educate him solely because she has knowledge he doesn’t. Just because Draco is willing to learn doesn’t mean Granger has to teach him or answer his questions.
The symbolism of his offer is not something Draco plans on sharing. Symbolism, if done well, doesn’t need to be explained. If Harry can’t figure it out on his own, perhaps Draco overestimated him. That was never one of his problem though. If anything, Draco
He might not be able to stop Potter from bringing in more and more of them (
“I understand—” Potter interrupts him before Draco can put his foot in his mouth with some empty phrases. Those very rarely help, in Draco’s experience.
Malfoy stands impossibly close, close enough that he whispered the last words into Harry’s ear, close enough that Harry can sense him, feel his warmth and smell his shampoo. It’s … confusing, Malfoy close enough to touch, and Harry can’t stop thinking about that night when Malfoy found the first ferret, how it felt to hold him and how Malfoy smells the same now and then. Then Harry jerks back, because he almost
meet him, and their potential friendship died a slow, agonising death. It was too late at that point though, Draco had developed a weakness for their Golden Boy, and there was nothing he could do about it.
Potter laughs again and nudges his nose against Draco’s neck in acknowledgement, but thankfully doesn’t say anything on it. Draco doesn’t know if he could handle that.

discontent and longing, languishing away in his terrible lonesome.

feel bad about it, but not bad enough to release Harry. Draco is selfish like that.
“Pansy, please. I made you these scones, laboured in the kitchen for hours upon hours so that you might enjoy the fruit of my hard work and dunk it into your tea—also provided by me, in case you forgot. Could you just eat them and answer my question?” Draco is not pouting, how dare you suggest that? He is very reasonably pointing out that Pansy is being a bad friend, which is a

Ron sobers as he hears that; he takes after Molly in his recently developed fussing over his friends' needs. Harry would mind more, feels that he should, really, but Ron’s cooking is far better than take away and eating with his friends is far more pleasurable than eating alone. Harry feels only slightly guilty for inviting himself over for dinner again. They probably expected him to, anyway. There is a silent agreement between them; they don’t voice their concerns about Harry and Harry let’s them check up on him in far smaller intervals than strictly necessary.
“We are coming with you.” Now it’s Weasley’s turn to smirk, the expression obnoxious on his friendly face.
Second, Draco is the cousin. Draco grew up in thoughtless splendour, given things with a reckless abandon and no thought to there ever being something he couldn’t have while Harry existed only in what was denied to him.
Harry had assured him that he could come up with a strategy, no problem. Draco should have known better.

Harry doesn’t understand it as such. His eyes light up in challenge and he leans forward, pulling Draco in with nothing but that spark. Draco is helpless to do anything but lean in further, an awed fool come to marvel at Harry's glory.
“Alright, you can open them now,” Potter finally allows, after five minutes of fussing to get the details perfect.
Harry twists his face into a grimace and yes, alright, Ron's is better but what about —
who brought it into the marriage. You can finally declare your intentions of divorcing me and throw me out of the house. I should warn you though, that won’t play out as you think it will — I will fight for this house and don’t think for a moment that Grimmauld would ever choose you over me,” Malfoy presses out, not stopping once for air as if Harry would interrupt him at the slightest chance.
to be, but Draco hopes for such subtleties to be beyond Weasley.
friends.” Potter braces himself against Draco’s shoulders, which does some strange things to their centre of gravity, but doesn’t ultimately topple them over. He glares at Draco with all his glorious fury, green eyes blazing.
In all honesty, Draco doesn’t remember what exactly it was that Theo’s father did—though he is pretty sure there was the reveal of an affair involved, a husband kissing the gardener instead of his wife? Draco doesn’t remember, but it left a stain on the collective memory of the Greengrass’ party—and he thinks it a bit ridiculous that they should still be angry enough to forbid their daughter her happiness, simply because said happiness is attached to a Nott. Looking at this mess, one could almost be grateful for arranged marriages, officially understood to be nothing but political manoeuvring and the acquisition of a paramour not only socially accepted but expected.
Wow! What happened to ‘manners are a virtue’?

It’s generally understood not to make fun of Theo's…
“Did he
I knock, scared and excited, reaching for my love, grown complacent in my absence.
What kind of love would it be, if it allowed Draco to sit here and let Harry die?
Weasley, Draco is relieved to learn, doesn’t hold real power. He puts his hands on his hips, looks very stern, and doesn’t do anything. There are no great consequences, the world isn’t shaking around them, and Draco doesn’t start feeling weak. The best Weasley can do is failing to look intimidating.
Potter, it seems, is blind even with his glasses firmly on his face. There is no other explanation to why he doesn’t react in any way, not growing more flustered or staring at Draco—both of these reactions would have been fully justified and appreciated! Instead, when Potter finally does react, it’s to grip his weapon tighter, like he anticipates having to swing it again, and soon.
Draco will also keep Harry far away from his mother, just to be safe.
Just when Draco decided to lovingly nurse Potter back to health before bringing up the height thing, Potter jerks awake in his arms. He flinches, coughs, moves to sit up the way one does when shooting awake after a nasty nightmare, but Draco holds him down, presses a cool hand onto his forehead and whispers silly reassurances. It’s nothing, wouldn’t stop Potter if he didn’t want himself to be stopped, but Potter sinks back down, settles against him and blinks up at Draco, smiling.
“That’s really not the point. We’ll trick the system!” Potter, as usual, has strange priorities.

Potter would grab an actual dagger (raised by Muggles, it leaves visible traces in his behaviour; anyone else would look up a nasty curse, but Potter has always been more physical than that) and fist a hand into Draco’s hair to hold him still, would lean close enough to breath on his face and — this thought-experiment went a little far. What were they talking about again?
“Weasley is here?” Draco asks, like an imbecile, not looking away from Potter. Perhaps he won’t be here when Draco doesn’t see him?
“Thank you, that is greatly reassuring.” Draco might not be able to lie to her, but he can feign conviction well enough to confuse her.
Honestly, anyone would have stumbled under that unexpected pressure of cooking for a loved — his
Harry might have been just fine, politely declined and suggested they first try resolving this far away from the judging eyes of Narcissa Malfoy. It’s not enough that she is an intimidating woman in and of herself (Harry witnessed her lying to Voldemort —
What does Draco have to do to make him stop?
He knew of course that he was being unreasonable, starting with the least used rooms is a questionable method not only because it means living on basically nothing until almost the end of the renovations, but it also leads to things being rushed and decisions made under pressure — it’s inconvenient all around.
Draco glares up at the window, tiny in the distance but big enough to make for a clear aim. Draco is going to get there, if only to tell him that disappearing and conjuring up a dragon is a very rude way of rejecting someone. There would have been easier ways; they would have hurt about the same as a dragon stomping on him but they would have been kinder to his clothes.
This is also where Draco first flew. This is where his mother taught him all the names of the flowers in their garden and where his father showed him how to gain the peacocks respect and trust.
“Oh that — she locked us in together!” Malfoy noticed the ward too, and he is familiar enough with Parkinson's magic and intention to realise immediately what she did. Namely, trap Harry with the annoying bastard he was just repeatedly warned not to harm. This is just
The sight that greets Harry is … not what he expected. Rather scarring too, to be quite frank.
Pansy gets obnoxiously smug about her flings, bragging and relaying tales in greater detail than anyone really wanted, proud and unapologetic. Draco supposes this is due to the disapproving looks she gets; Pansy thrives on demolishing the walls other people try and set for her. It’s only feelings she clams up at, falling in love with a nice person to marry and settle down and have a hoard of children to further the bloodline, exactly how society dictates. Her feelings for Weasley and Granger hardly fit that narrow frame, but apparently spitting monogamy in the face is not enough to tempt her into smug defiance.
instead of asking what he would like. Perhaps Potter only has one sort of tea anyway, which would indeed and clearly be a sad comment and call for an immediate intervention. In fact, perhaps they should get Potter a whole new kitchen, not just refresh his stock of tea.
“Are you saying my heroic sacrifice doesn’t count because I saved
, no need for that much contact between them, but that part always has the most boring ideas and Harry doesn’t feel guilty resolutely ignoring it. It’s much more thrilling to focus on Draco, the inquisitive little hums, the way he watches Harry’s hands intently to remember the exact details of the high art that is coffee brewing.
“You named your stuffed toy dragon Capt’n?” Harry asks, something in his voice that — is that awe?
Although, calling it a
Draco doesn’t know what he is doing, but he’d do anything to keep this feeling, even Potter.

fast, it isn’t even trying to hide and sneak up at them, not getting closer at all.
They look for Harry.
Ron looks at him like he considers running—which is insulting—and Harry prepares to tackle him into the ground, when Ron’s face suddenly lights up in relief.
It’s all perfectly fine though, he can explain this. Malfoy is objectively good looking and Harry is a young and healthy man, he has needs, same as anyone. It’s simple biology, nothing Malfoy specific. A distressing comment on his recent sex life, that’s all. Harry just needs to get laid and then he can finally stop thinking about Malfoy in those pyjamas, about Malfoy out of those pyjamas — stop! Right there, no more thinking about Malfoy as anything but the unpleasant pillock that he is.
Harry can’t wait.
“Nonsense, it’s brilliant! I figured out how to convince Potter to give me that interview.” That finally gets everyone's attention, Pansy and Blaise even deigning to put their argument on hold.
Draco, right.
“Will you teach me?”
The figure that appears isn’t Granger, or at least she isn’t human. Draco didn’t expect her to be, at this point. Whatever twisted fantasy Potter has conjured up, it affects all of them.
“Would you excuse me,” Draco says, the words phrased like a question but none of it actually up to debate. He is already getting up, leaving the table. Harry messed up.

Could Draco possibly get a week to prepare? He would ask Pansy, ask Theo after that because Pansy’s advice is highly likely to be inappropriate — Draco would do much better with some time to consider this.
“I won’t, I swear I won’t!” Harry is desperate for Malfoy to believe him. It’s a bit ridiculous, to freak out over a little kiss, but Malfoy looks like his is about to shatter into a thousand pieces, only held together by the slippery slope of pride.
Harry had mentioned before that his friends wanted to meet Draco, so the concept — no less ridiculous now then it was then — is not new. Draco should have been prepared for this coming up again. Maybe he could have averted his fate if he had seen sooner where Harry’s thoughts were headed, could have cut the idea off before it fully formed.
Harry didn’t know he was capable of feeling worse, but that does it. That’s the thing with gambles — they can pull the last stitch of ground you stand on right out from under your feet.
to visit. (And that he prefers coffee over tea, but that is blasphemous and of little importance. Draco brought him tea anyway.) Potter doesn’t throw them out when they show up, no, but he certainly doesn’t invite them over and to call him pleased at the expression of concern would be exaggerated. Weasley made it very clear that they aren’t exactly welcome.
He doesn’t say any of that to Ron; Harry has the feeling he wouldn’t approve. Instead, he makes a vague humming noise, to be interpreted anyway Ron chooses.
And then Potter laughs, hair back in the wink of an eye.
Harry curses silently, he was so close to sleep already! Maybe, if he doesn’t react, Malfoy will think him still asleep and leave him alone? A foolish hope perhaps, but Harry doesn’t want to deal with him right now, not when he is quasi almost asleep already.
The next plant Draco brings is more colourful. The woman warned him that it would require more care than the last one she sold him, but Potter is good at taking care of things. (It would do him good to remember that.) Also, distance allowed to forget and underestimate the severity of the circumstances Potter lives in, the bleak emptiness of his kitchen and dull lack of colour—if all Draco can do against it is to bring plants, he'll make sure that they are the brightest plants possible.
that you get a room and spare me.” Weasley—who is only still here because this is Potter’s mind, not Draco’s—doesn’t sound as disgruntled as he claims to be. Draco would hazard a guess that he is actually pretty fond and charmed by Potter, a suspicion that would be easy enough to verify if Draco could bring himself to look away from Potter and check.
? Did I
And, if Harry liked the kiss, all is not lost yet.
It feels like Harry should have known better than to take anything Draco said at face value, like he should have heard what Draco
“Cut my hair?” Potter backs away like Draco threatened to cut it right now, clutching at the strands brushing his shoulders to protect them from evil scissors.
He should figure out how to get himself down from this roof. And then he should get out of Potter’s mind. He has some calculations to do, some books to glare at. He’ll return tomorrow, with a new plan and better prepared for Potter swooning into his arms with no intention of staying there, jostled out of them the moment Draco has an opinion of his own, one that doesn’t fit on the lips of the hero Potter wants. Lets face, it was never
want Draco to rescue him? This is worse even than when he knocked Draco over the head with a pan and bound him to a chair!
The facts Harry knows about Malfoy and the warm body pressed against him make for a jarring contrast and Harry stumbles back, making Malfoy squawk again at the sudden movement.
“No, it wasn’t,” Draco answers more seriously than the situation perhaps warrants. Potter nods, though, equally serious, so that’s good. “She is far more important than all these reporters and is very fond of me. You might just wish she was a crazy fan when she tells you to be careful with my delicate heart.”
Not giving himself another second to think Draco surges forward, carried on a wave of adrenaline and a resolve to get this over with, and smashes his lips against Potter’s.
, and if it weren't for Draco's pride and anger, they might even have found a solution to navigate this wrong thing in Draco. Harry likes helping people, and perhaps he could have taught Draco.
Their unexpected visitor, when they finally deign to fully enter the room, is even more unexpected than Harry thought possible, with all the potential and despair of the situation.
Although that would go against the whole ‘talking about it’ thing and Blaise
good thing, granted, but that makes it all the more important. How did Draco think this would be comfortable?
Potter blinks and looks down, realises that is where Draco’s crotch is and looks to the side, even more flustered. It's such a change from Potter arrogant and smirking as he drives Draco crazy, the realisation of what they did catching up with him. Draco almost forgot that Potter hasn’t done this before, that he is endearingly prudish and novice.
“It’s Malfoy,” Draco frowns at him, shakes him a bit to get his brain running. “Did you hit your head or something? What did Granger do to you?”
They need to talk about that. It will be awkward and uncomfortable, and Harry dreads it already, but they must talk about it. They need to be clear on what they want out of this marriage — this

win.” Blaise has never once won a bet in his life. Depending on the mood and the stakes, it’s either tragic or hilarious. Given that they bet on him (which Draco isn’t too fond of — not that that’s ever stopped them) and the unexpected downward spiral his thoughts have taken (Draco didn’t think it could get lower than missing Harry; in retrospect, he stupidly tempted fate with that assumption), Draco decides on hilarious for this particular instance.
“You would run away with me?” Potter asks, granting his lips respite to stare at Draco, far more surprised than Draco thinks his offer really warrants. Hasn’t he made it clear that he won’t leave Potter?
Draco is almost surprised his eyes aren’t bound, that he sees something when he opens them.
Harry might have
he would do that, given that the house vastly prefers Malfoy and the git also legally lives here and has thus every right to stay, but it feels good to say anyway.
“I might not have much experience with gifts,” Potter says, shooting Draco a glare as he takes in a sharp breath. Draco doesn’t dare point out how sad that is—Potter would know better than him, having lived through the scandal—and Potter goes back to scowling at the cage. “But I don’t think
Draco stares at Potter, meets his eyes so painfully sincere and urging Draco to understand. Draco does understand, he thinks he does. It’s as Potter said: he broke the rules (something he does often, even those he set himself, but that isn’t the same as saying he would break them for just anyone) and he saved Draco, because he chose him.
Draco doesn’t have the heart to tell him. He doesn’t want it to shatter yet, the illusion that they could have this, could share an innocent kiss in gold and splendour.
They would still be smarter than Potter’s half of the table, but there would be no one to share fictional tales about Draco’s misadventures with and the danger of things derailing into Hogwarts-adjacent standards would be easier to control and contain.
“Dessert is arranged — anything else you need me to do that you can claim credit for to impress lover boy?” Blaise smirks at him, as he has been doing all day, coming up with ridiculous nicknames for Potter and harshly criticising each and every outfit that Draco considered wearing. He got away with it only because Draco desperately needed him to cook their dinner, a fact Blaise smugly exploited.

It’s kind of perfect. Draco isn’t going to say it, because Potter is suffering next to him even if he doesn’t say it anymore, but Draco thinks he gets the sunsets now.
—and downs the cold tea in one go, never breaking eye contact as he steals Draco’s tea. Then he presses the newly empty cup back into Draco’s hands and smacks his lips, like he never tasted anything as divine as that tea, which Draco hopes isn’t true.
Harry marvels at Malfoy's dedication to making his mother happy (because that is who he is doing it all for, Harry knows from Ron who knows from Parkinson, so he feels the information can be trusted, unlikely as it seems) in the rooms they never used anyway, the countless parlous and guest rooms. It’s harder to watch him clear out rooms they spend a good amount of time in, the living room and kitchen reduced to their essentials, Harry’s bedroom packed up into neatly labelled boxes one day suddenly. Harry has to remind himself that that was the deal, that Malfoy could do whatever he wants in the house.

, having explained that bisexuality is indeed an actual thing, really) but also married and utterly convinced Parkinson fancies Harry’s best friends — there are very few points jealousy is collecting. It does have one though, and that’s a pretty big one.
Or are they a blessing? Draco did have very good reasons not to kiss Potter. They seem stupid now, granted, but their power of persuasion increases exponentially with Potter’s distance. They seem less than bullshit when Draco needs them to ring true the most: when Potter is close enough to be kissed.
I find myself confused at your last letter. If you could be so kind as to elaborate, I would be ever so obliged.

Weasley and Granger nod, too, wands already held high, and Draco steps through the door, hoping for Potter but fearing for worse.
Yours,
Sometimes Draco gets overwhelmed by how much they care, how much they pick up on without him having to openly admit to it. Like his completely disproportionate dread of this evening. So, grateful and terrified, Draco only manages a weak nod that will simply have to be enough for Blaise.
The sharks are still screaming, scribbling notes and taking pictures, pressing Potter into the wall and circling him.
It doesn’t matter anymore, because the way Harry looked at him when Draco confessed to hating it all, confirmed by the things he wrote in that ill-thought out letter, makes Draco certain that Harry no longer has any interest in enforcing their deals. But he is still here, close enough that Draco can feel his breath on his face, arms wound tight around Draco. Perhaps they cannot only go back, perhaps they can make it better.

But here Draco is, irrevocably in love with Harry.
“It’s a
Ron sighs, looks between Harry and the danger lurking in the kitchen, and grabs his apron.
At least Potter is happy dancing with Weasley and singing his abominable songs. (Or are they good songs and Potter’s voice is the abominable factor? Draco has no way of knowing and he has no intentions of staying long enough to find out.)
“What?” The word, the only thing Harry’s mind seems capable of producing, sounds punched out and hollow.
“It’s a present.” Draco smiles at him, placing the tea and plant on the counter for Potter to inspect.
In the end, it’s all rather simple. If his father is out in the gardens being the stranger Draco is reluctant to get to know, that means his study is empty. Which, in turn, means that Draco can finally make use of the secret door he painfully carved into the wards.
What is he talking about? Draco has no idea and Weasley begins to look at him like he is a mentally challenged first year, which is how
commenting. He and Seamus have been attached at the hip (and Harry doesn’t want to know where also, no sir, not thinking about that) since the first time Seamus tried to impress Dean with a spell and ended with blowing it up instead, they don’t get to have opinions on flirting and pining. Not even when they clearly don’t apply to Harry’s situation.
Harry has no idea how they will accomplish any of that. And, yet, it seems easy compared to the rest they need to talk about, what happened exactly and how Draco didn't tell Harry sooner,
“You don’t even like ‘The Incredibles’, you always complain when I want to see that one.” Weasley stopped running, now a little boy with blond hair and far too much energy, bouncing in excitement. Draco can’t tell if that is Weasley or the role Potter assigned him—from a movie, Draco thinks? Not sure, Weasley will have to explain once they got Potter down from there—but he wishes he would stop; it doesn’t fit with the picture of Potter hanging beaten and starved above them, hurt as his friend plays dress-up.
bowls, which reflects in their size more than anything; giant ice cream is one of these things that never fails to make Draco stop and appreciate the Magic all around them—and drop it by Blaise’s place.
“Because I want to do this, Harry. I want to do it for real, out in a world that isn’t built of your mind, where we can be equals. I want to kiss you and take pictures of your smile. I want grass stains to remember this day by.” Draco doesn’t know what he wants, wants the vast endlessness of possibilities and the uncertainty of life, wants to grow and change and build a home with Potter.
He doesn’t want to be that person — who in their right mind would want to be that person? Sure, he isn’t exactly like Dudley, Draco likes to think he stayed far away from mindless cruelty, he takes better care of his things and would never let them go to ruin, and he wouldn’t classify his friends as henchmen either, but those are all subtle differences that don’t change the bigger picture. A flaw is a flaw, whether you paint it purple or green, whether it’s motivated from a darkness in character or ignorance.
because he enjoyed the horror he was inspiring in Draco; this one would be easy in comparison. Harry doesn’t
“Do you know the hat wanted to sort me into Slytherin?” he asks, almost absent minded. Before Draco has the chance to recover from
Harry isn’t foolish enough to voice any of this. Instead, he vaguely hums, grins to make Draco frown, and sips his coffee.
“What, you finally realised that your friends suck and so you—I still don’t know what you want.” Weasley looks almost relaxed by now, amused at Draco’s misery.
“No, I learnt my lesson about getting drunk with you anywhere near me.” Pansy looks disappointed but, to her credit, doesn’t push the subject. Draco is grateful for it; they both know that, if she wanted, Pansy could have him disgracefully past tipsy and loudly singing bad songs he'd be ashamed to admit to even knowing. (It has been known to happen before.) “Also, and this is just a side note, but whoever decided that sunsets are the epitome of romance? They are depressing at worst—all that symbolism of the end and such—and tedious at best. They are neither particularly beautiful nor rare—what is so special about some random sunset?”
, how slender and delicate he is, how pale his skin, like porcelain, begging for kisses to be trailed — Malfoy
“What the hell was that, Malfoy?” Potter, for someone who survived literal attempts on his life, doesn’t handle accidents well.
The fabric of Potter’s trousers is soft and worn under Draco’s hands, pleasant enough if it weren’t a barrier between Draco and the muscles of Potter’s thighs tensing as Draco slowly slides his hands upwards. He would love little more than doing this to Potter naked, feeling his skin and the twitching directly. Still, there is something to be said about delayed gratification, the gradual build-up driving them both crazy.
It’s okay, though, because Draco has the table to support him.
Granger is human at least—Draco is pretty sure he is, too—and whatever Weasley is, he sounds like he is enjoying himself. Granger is wearing a costume almost the same as Potter’s (which suggest horrifying things about Draco’s own clothes), looking out through the face of a pale teenager, half hidden behind black hair and seemingly content with that. She is Not Amused and Draco is impressed with how well she expresses that, even in a body that isn’t her own and is unfamiliar in how it moves.
Any Slytherin worth their salt should know when — and, more importantly,
“My father let me down, I thought back then. Now I think I just wasn’t prepared for the truth, to realise that he is only human. Fallible. Fragile.” Draco still speaks in that horribly hallow tone, as if the whole thing doesn’t concern him at all, grown numb to his pain.
Harry nodded “Drake here loves my cooking, so he just uses me for my food."
"So no one would know" Harry stated with an eyebrow raised but he had a huge grin on his face waiting for Draco to realise.
"Good get on it right away there is someone who is missing them dearly."
“I thought I had lost you, this all happened because of me! I should be the one comforting you but I’m too weak to stop crying, I have been so worried.”
Draco sighed, annoying the bushy haired teen sitting next to him in the process.
Harry nodded “I swear on my magic."
"You were never the golden boy." Draco stated
**********************************************************************************
Harry rolled his eyes, he couldn't get Pansy to stop calling him that. "I wouldn't say that Tom's right behind you."
Blaise laughed. “How could we forget?”
Hermione was leaning on the wall opposite the portrait; her arms were crossed as she glared at Harry as he appeared.
"No Drake it's not that I don't feel the same... I'm just confused."
Harry frowned at her. “I’m as good as! I’m only looking out for you, I hate seeing you get so hurt again and again.”
"Oh I'm sure you’re a whole heap of help." Harry smirked.
Harry shrugged "Me." He stated it like it was a well-known fact.
Hermione had finally listen to Harry and had a serious think about where she wanted her future to go, now she had a date but she refused to tell Harry who it was with. Harry had agreed to help her in the hopes of squeezing the information out of her.
"You can sleep in the common room."
“Way to beautiful.” Tom continued licking and nipping at Harry’s chest. Harry was all but a pile of goo at this point.
"I never said that." Harry laughed
“It was because of me...”
"We're not, we're just friends."
"That is correct, and Severus tells me you’re stupid."
Harry faked hurt "What it's not bad enough that I have the big bad dark lord after me, I now have you too... And here I thought we were friends."
Ron hadn’t noticed Harry’s inner turmoil, instead continued his rant all through breakfast, even Hermione had stopped chastising him for insulting the Professor and started to ignore him, it seemed Ron really had woken on the wrong side of the bed- well couch in the case but the statement was still true. Harry played with his food more then he ate, but he did manage to eat a few pieces of toast. He wanted nothing more than to talk to Ron and Hermione, but they wouldn’t understand, they would tell him Voldemort couldn’t be trusted and that was that, even despite the fact that he couldn’t lie while under the truth potion. Harry groaned he could feel a headache coming and just knew that today was not going to be a good day, especially since they started the day with Defence against the dark arts. He wasn’t going to be able to escape his thoughts of last night with Snape and Malfoy in the exact room it all happened in. Harry even considered going to the hospital wing despite his hatred of that place just to escape his morning lesson with the Slytherin head of house. He already felt that his thoughts were running on repeat, always thinking the same things in a loop, over and over and being in the presence of both Malfoy and Snape would only serve to make things worse.
Harry shook his head. “You never will, just like you couldn’t replace Draco, he couldn’t replace you… That’s why I’m so confused, I’m being selfish but I don’t want to let go of either of you, it’s nice to be loved and not hated for once.”
Hermione began to tell Draco that she had written notes for Draco while he missed classes and what he had missed out on.
"You wanted to see me sir?"
Harry gave Draco a nervous smile "So what are doing anyway?"
Hermione rolled her eyes "Come on we're going to be late if we don't hurry, Harry you don't want the others to be even angrier at you for loosing points for being late so let's go."
"Your gofather had support the support of his friends."
"Out of the question, Harry Voldemort is as gay as they come; he admitted it when I questioned him". Harry was too shocked to say anything, Voldemort was gay? That sounded weirder then him courting Hermione.
*********************************************************************************************************************
"I'm falling for you and Tom!" Harry blurted out.
Theo didn't say anything but did let out a sigh of relief and ran a hand through his hair.
Hermione looked at Harry “I better get some" Harry was about to reply when he was interrupted.
If Harry had still been drinking his potions he would have spat it out. “I’m not gay, so I don't care about what guys look like, your appearance is just a shock like I said"
Hermione squealed and her hand shot to her mouth "OH MY GOD!"
Dumbledore nodded "yes, sorry to pull you away from breakfast but a numbet of teachers have reported that you have been spotted with a few Slytherins these past few weeks... I cant help but be concerned."
Harry smiled "Please Sir, indulge me... I just want to know, there is no harm in checking is there?"
Harry smiled "Not bloody likely, you’re a slut, you sleep with anything that has a dick...you’re not my type you see I quite enjoy dick myself actually"
Smirking at Harry’s reaction to his body, Draco got on his hands and knees and held his hands on Tom’s waist as he sucked and kissed Tom’s cock, Harry, had remembered what Draco could do with his tongue was now so painfully hard he didn’t know if he could watch for much longer without losing all control. Tom kept eye contact as Draco pleasure him, his mouth was open and he was breathing heavily in pleasure but he never look away from Harry.
Voldemort eyebrows rose as he stared at Harry, his former enemy was laying I front of him, he saved his life and all he had to say was that he had hair. “Really that's all you have to say."
Tom nodded “Apart from that I only have names"
"Hey everyone look it's the traitor" Ron called as Harry neared the Gryffindor table, causing everyone to laugh. Harry started to wonder why they ever let the red hair go, but then he remembered it would be fun to play with Ron here.
With a flick of his wand the man had the room lit, Harry stared closely at the man was the tall dark and handsome type from fairy tales he had neat black hair, chocolate brown eyes, perfectly tan skin, his jaw line was sharp and perfectly fine lips. He was tall and muscled, Harry eyes widened as he realised who this man was. He didn't say anything just sat there in shock. Voldemort shook with laughter as Harry looked at him, "You have hair!"
"Ahh silence." Snape sneered
Harry raised his eyebrows “It’s true Harry, Voldemort is so intelligent he is such a gentleman... He has been treating me like I'm royalty" Harry laughed at the thought of Voldemort snake like kissing her hand and having dinner having arguments about a book.
Tom was still staring at Harry with shock. “You love me?”
“How do you know about the map?” Hermione questioned.
“Come on Draco, you at least should have figured it our... I have" Tom rose an eyebrow as Draco shook his head.
Harry smiled at the memory he felt Draco stir as he lifted his head from Harry's lap he had sleep lines down his face. Harry laughed at Draco who tried to glare but failed. "Thanks harry I needed that"
Harry lay in his room by himself smiling, Remus had just told him that he and Sirius would be able to join him at Hogwarts after all, they would stay in the room of requirement so to be near Harry whenever he need them. Harry's was so thankful to Tom for bringing his godfather back, he wanted to give something back in return. Sirius had given Harry the best thing too, Harry was a descendent from Merlin himself and contained journals written by the wizard. Harry had Remus collect them...he was going to give them to Tom, he was waiting for the man right now in fact as Harry sat up there was a knock on the door. 'Good timing' Harry thought.
“I may have scared you Harry but Tom didn’t spare me any details about you, this whole time I have been worried about you but I couldn’t find a way to wake up for some reason.”
Harry smirked "Oh well I'll put Merlin's personal journals back in my vault then." He pointed to the books piled near door. Tom's eyes widened in surprise “you’re giving me Merlin's journals?  Are you sure?"
Harry tried to get away "I'm not property Tom. You don't own me, I'm a person, your equal...and yes I enjoyed the kiss, you’re an excellent snogger Tom you could snog a perfectly straight man and they would be turned on by it but that's not the point, I also have feelings for someone else and I'm confused I'm unsure what I want right now."
"Oh come on Hermione stop teasing Draco."
"It never ends." Snape replied solemnly.
Molly gasped and covered her mouth quickly. "Why Harry I'm sure I don't know what you’re talking about?"
McGonagall smiled "That's great Mr Potter, house unity is something we have strived for years to achieve, but I was under the impression you and Mr Malfoy…well hated each other?"
" So according to this law, a true antidote to a blended poison is more than the sum of its parts?" Harry asked still confused
Draco nodded “It was only natural for you to be curious about your dad Harry, but from what mother told me he was a lot like James in personality, they were like Fred and George always in sync."
He heard a pop alerting him that someone had apperated into his wards, he knew it was Harry so he made his way to Harry's room. Not bothering to knock of the door he just walked and glared at Harry who just simply smiled. Harry was put under crucio before the he could blink however it only lasted a few seconds. “Mione told you didn't she?". Tom rolled his eyes at the teen. “Of course she did, she's not my adviser for no reason."
The Matron nodded and left Harry and Hermione with the sleeping Draco.
Tom nodded. “Turns out we both don’t hate each other as much as we thought.” He paused to smile. “I may not like to share and that he has his own place in your heart but I am thankful that you have him in your life and I understand now after seeing you these past few weeks that you need him in your life.”
Draco laughed " I'll forgive you if you be my pillow for a little while" Harry was frozen in shock, he nodded at Draco he placed his head in his lap and quickly fell asleep. Harry hadn't noticed the bags under Draco's eyes until now, he felt horrible that he hadn't noticed sooner. He declared to himself he wouldn't move and would allow for Draco to sleep for as long as needed.
Draco's eyes widened as he swallowed the cake he looked between the cake and Harry. “Merlin that was amazing, I have never had better... Potter, can you cook treacle tart or is it only cakes that you can cook?"
"That we will cub that we will."
Tom nodded. "Harry has his godfather back"
Tom raised an eyebrow "Isn't she your best friend what's with the groaning?"
"One of these days I'm going to talk to Draco about taking you shopping, I'm sure he will be more the happy to help you get a new wardrobe."
Rita agreed and left Harry and Luna with a spring in her step.
Harry nodded “Okay.”
Tom smirked "Ah so you finally noticed."
Tom interrupted before Harry could say anything. "The meal was marvellous I cannot wait until the next meal you create."
Tears slowly trickled down his face as he stared down at the injured boy; he let out soft sobs for a while until he felt a hand on his shoulder.
Harry rolled his eyes and groaned.
Harry shrugged “Actually I showed strong attributes for all the houses, so I could have been placed anywhere."
Hermione grabbed Harry's hand "Let's go Harry; you need a change of uniform before classes begin."
Harry didn’t seem any closer to an answer as he snuck out of the Gryffindor common room and made his way down to the Snape’s office. This was a life changing decision, one that was life or death.
"We are just friends" Harry scowled
Harry looked at Hermione as if she was Insane” Hermione this is the man who killed my parents!" Hermione shook her head eyes watering
"Shut up Draco or you will miss it" Blaise whispered.
Harry rolled his eyes "I'm not a prize to be won, how many times do I have to say this!"
"Hey!" Harry glared at Tom.
Harry arched his back, causing Draco to choke a little.
“Thanks for meeting me here, and not telling the others about this.”
Remus smiled "Trust me when I say, your heart and soul know who you belong to the minute you are born."
When they pulled away Sirius began grinning like the Cheshire cat at the three of them. “You three are together aren’t you?”
Draco grinned “She needs my great intellect to help her.” Draco beamed.
Harry quickly got up "I got to go, I'm going to visit Sirius."
Harry nodded not looking at Draco. Draco didn't hesitate he grabbed Harry's hand and pulled him inside the room, shutting the door behind him. "Drake you don't have to, I don't want to bother you.”
“School work is important; I just don’t want to fall behind.”
After they all had defence against the dark arts. Snape gave Harry a wicked smile before spotting Tom and turning to the rest of the class "Today you will learn the patronus charm." Harry figured Snape didn’t hear about his perfect O.W.L score because of his corporeal patronus.
Tom winked at Harry "I can think of one, the other day in my study."
Harry nodded. “I didn’t tell Rita anything about what’s happening now, you get to talk about how he defended students despite almost killing Draco, how Gryffindor house pretty much turned their backs on me apart from the select few who are true friends, how I was resorted and friends with Slytherin's, I need you to back up what Rita is saying as well for secretly writing to the world of Tom’s ideals and such I want Dumbledore to see his power taken before I finally have the pleasure of taking his life myself.”
Hermione was angry now " I know a real memory when I see one Harry! They don't call be the brightest which of my age for nothing!"
Harry frowned "How?"
Harry moved so that Draco could lay down and he was curled into the other boy, Draco ran his hand up and down Harry’s spine. They stayed like this for hours, just talking. Harry felt a lot better now that Draco was awake, he felt at peace. Just before dinner they were joined by the others, they had come to drag Harry to get something to eat and were pleasantly surprised to see Draco awake. “Where are my cuddles Harry? You have been neglecting me!” Tom smirked not letting the others see how much the scene bothered him.
Draco raised from his seat immediately rushing to the mirror on the other side of his room, Hermione couldn't control her laughter "Oh Merlin, it's just so easy!”
Draco the stood up and then helping Harry up who now was laughing, Draco joined in "See I told you" he said as he made his way to the kitchen.
"Or the I just rolled out of bed look." Harry groaned
Harry groaned "That's not the worst of it either, they both buy random things they think I need and like, just yesterday Draco bought me another house elf, I guess he forgot I already have one and Tom he bought me a harp... I don't even play the harp! What the hell am I supposed to do with a freaking harp!"
Harry nodded at the two. When Sirius spoke up. “But really Harry the night he gets out of the hospital?” The older man said gesturing to Draco.
**********************************************************************************
"Did you?" Hermione had an odd look on her face. “Hermione where are we?"
Harry jaw dropped Tom chuckled. "Her responsibly will be more focused on magical creature welfare, I have made many promises that she attends to help me keep, right now she is working on amending the werewolf laws"
“Well I don’t blame you so you shouldn’t either!”
Harry tried to look innocent "I'm not planning anything, why would you think that?"
Draco nodded. “Thank you for that by the way.”
Harry then remembered why he was here he looked over at Draco and saw that he still hadn't woken.
"And beat Hermione, you must be joking?"
Harry looked at his watch. “I’m sorry Luna but I have to go, did you want me to walk you anywhere before I go?”
Harry laughed as Pansy went wide eyed and looked behind her only to find an empty space. She slapped his arm, "One of these days Harry, I'm going to get you."
Draco laughed " I'll forgive you if you be my pillow for a little while" Harry was frozen in shock, he nodded at Draco he placed his head in his lap and quickly fell asleep. Harry hadn't noticed the bags under Draco's eyes until now, he felt horrible that he hadn't noticed sooner. He declared to himself he wouldn't move and would allow for Draco to sleep for as long as needed.
"The Ashwinder, is a class three magical creature, the Ashwinder is created when a magical fire has been left to burn for two long, it will arise from the ambers and slither away into the shadows, it leaves behind an ash trail, wild Ashwinders only live for one hour and their eggs are used in love potions. Professor Periwinkle found a formula to allow this creature to live the average life of a snake"
Sirius nodded "Just let whatever should be happen, let your heart decide and be damned what everyone else thinks!"
Harry sat down on the blanket with a grin when Draco didn't move. "Are you going to stand there all night or are you going to feed me?"
Silence once again fell upon the room. The three Slytherins stared at Harry in shock. However this time before anyone spoke Harry interrupted the silence. "Okay now you know how pathetic I really am, let’s make fun of me later okay, times up for me no more questions it’s your turn." He gestured for Voldemort to take the vial sitting in front of him.
Ron looked disgusted by the idea but Harry wasn't sure if he was hanging out with Slytherins or the studying part that the red head didn't like.
Draco pouted "Please Harry?"
"Given who their parents were I thought you would be wary of who you befriend."
“Draco has a place in your heart that I cannot hope to replace, just like I know that I too hold a place, it’s an honour to have a place in your heart after all the horrible things I have done to you in the past, and I don’t want to lose my place.”
"Wait that means you accepted your lordship" Draco smiled and Harry chuckled.
Draco’s mouth was immediately on Harry’s; he slipped one hand up the front of Harry’s shirt and began to trace patterns across Harry’s skin. Tom was pressed against Harry from behind, sucking and biting at the sensitive part of his neck. Harry’s eyes rolled back as he closed his eyes and let out a low moan. ‘why did I wait this long to do this again’ he couldn’t help but think. Harry pulled Draco closer, his hands tangled in his hair, deepening the kiss. The three of them somehow managed to move to one of the beds in the room and landed in a tangled mess. Draco reached over and began undressing both Tom hand Harry. Nipping and kissing both their chests once free from the shirts. Tom finally released the bruised flesh from from his mouth, Harry moved to kiss him just as passionately as he had kissed Draco. Exploring his mouth always felt this good. They both kissed in different ways but Harry found them highly intoxicating and was equally growing addicted to both.
“We decided that neither of us were going to let go of you, so you don’t have to let go of us.”
Tom chuckled "Luck!"
“I’ll have you know all of Gryffindor adored Harry's cooking, he has a talent for it."
Tom chuckled "Well we mustn't keep you for very much longer, or else we will have the wrath of Granger to deal with."
Harry smiled to himself as he made his way through the streets, it had been three days since he had been with Tom and Draco and none of his friends had figured that they were all together, he thought Luna might have her suspicions but she hadn’t said anything. He knew once the others found out he would be in a lot of trouble from Hermione and Pansy for keeping it a secret but he couldn’t care at this moment, he had bigger fish to fry.
Harry smiled "Speaking of which he said we have to go to Hogwarts tonight, he says we have missed too much, personally I think he is worried I’m hanging out with Draco."
Tom chuckled "It's okay, Potions isn't meant for everybody."
Harry nodded. “Sirius is Padfoot and Remus is Moony"
Harry smirked "I hope you don't think I'm an ugly face."
"I'll have Draco and Mione"
Tom just shook his head "No it's just it's been a rather good day and I don't want your mood to ruin it."
Harry smirked at Rita. “The truth about Albus Dumbledore and he craves power and cares about nothing but his power and how to get more.”
"Well it made Dumbledore even more pissed so thank you."
"Mione." Harry groaned.
"Aww Tom, Blaise is being a big meanie." Harry pouted.
They walked down to breakfast together, once they met up with friends they noticed that the talk of the hall was the attack on Draco and how Ron and Ginny where expelled. Harry wasn't that hungry but Pansy made him eat two pieces of toast and a cup of coffee.
Harry nodded once again, he followed Voldemort standing, he began leaving the room, when he reached the door, he turned back to the man. "Don't make me regret my decision."
"Who?"
Harry released him from the hug and nodded, he knew there was more to it than that but trusted Draco to tell him when he was ready, Hermione came into the room "It’s time, Harry get your mask on."
“I love you Draco.”
Harry's eyes widened " I have no idea what you’re talking about." he repeated the lie once more, scared out of his wits that Tom had somehow knew about the kiss that he shared with Draco.
Harry laughed at Draco as he ran a hand through his silky mess of hair. “Seriously? Their pranks have always lent them to the dark side".
Tom shook his head "No, he used the invisibility cloak; we just made it seem he was an uncle who wished to see his nephew, which is not uncommon."
Draco smiled "But you won't because he cares for me...wouldn't want to hurt him now would we."
Harry glared at Voldemort. “I don't know what she told you Voldemort but she clearly gave you the wrong impression."
Harry shook his head "Just to get you to shut up."
“I choose……”
Harry looked at Voldemort in disgust "Uh what?"
Draco grinned "I know right, to have a magical creature is rare!"
Harry woke the next morning, he called for Sirius in the twin mirror he had given him to make sure that Remus and Sirius arrived at the room of requirement, when they both looked dishevelled and stated quickly that they were fine and disappeared. Harry fake vomited to Hermione who smiled. They were still at it like rabbits. Harry shivered at the thought.
"They were even better than the Weasley twins." Blaise laughed
"Stupid Uncle Vernon and his temper" at least the man would finally get his wish, Harry would soon no longer exist in this world and would be reunited with his family.
"I go back to Hogwarts tomorrow."
"Hmm I don't know? I mean you just avoid them both like they have some kind of disease all of a sudden!"
"What of the faggot?" Ginny spat
"Yes I better be included in this to Harry." Harry turned to see Draco bowing at Tom. Harry rolled his eyes “Looks like I'm cooking for four".
Harry had tried to bandage up the wound but nothing could stop the blood flow, his only mission right now was to get as far away from the Dursley's as he could because there was no way he was going to be at peace with them anywhere near him when he died. Harry's head had begun to spin, he knew he had only minutes to live; he was losing too much blood to survive more than an hour. Harry only had one regret was that he hadn't done more with his life and that he wouldn't be able to say any words of comfort to Hermione about his death. Hermione was the only one he was sad to be leaving behind, she had always been there for him when he needed it, she hadn't cared when Harry had chosen not to fight for the light, and she had understood and sided with Harry. Dumbledore had manipulated Harry's every move and they had both decided that they weren't going to be puppets anymore. The light had disowned them, the Weasley’s labelled them traitors.. Even Ron hated them now.
Tom lifted Harry's hand to his lips and left a small kiss. "It's been my pleasure Harry, I've said it once and I'll say it a million more times, anything to make you happy."
Hermione beamed at Harry "Delicious as always Harry, you know I love your cooking since the first meal you cooked for me for my birthday, remember?" Harry laughed at her and nodded.
“Oh Merlin, this is the hottest thing I have ever seen.” Draco whispered as he pleasured himself.
Once they got their drinks it was straight to business. Rita had her quill and notepad, not using her quick quotes quill, knowing better then to use it while interviewing Harry ever again. “So Harry why don’t you tell me why you have asked to see me today?”
Harry nodded. “He was taking too long to get ready and I was hungry.”
Molly looked at Dumbledore confused “How are we supposed to find the boy?"
Harry sat on his bed as Tom shut the door behind him. Harry looked around the room with a smile as he realised that soon Draco would be back in this room and he wouldn’t be alone any more. Tom seemed to realise Harry’s train of thought and scowled. He pulled Harry’s chin to look up at him when he got closer.
Tom knew he should tell Harry what Lucius had told him earlier, right then but he wanted it to be a surprise right to the very end. Harry suddenly left the room muttering something that sounded a lot like “I need to see Drake"
"You don't remember me? That hurts Harry." He could hear the sarcasm in the man’s voice. “We see each other about once a year, come on your memory can't be that bad, Hermione said she told you where you were."
Tom took Harry's hand and led him around the zoo; they saw lots of animals such as the Augurey, Clabbert, Chizpurffle, Erking, Horklump and many others. Harry had a wonderful time. During seeing the animals Harry and Tom spoke about their favourite things and just got to know each other better.
