Harry stared at the now empty counter. "Where's she gone?" he snapped. "Oh bloody hell Malfoy! That was mean, even for you!"
Draco conjures magical cords and ties Placid's ankles and wrists together, and then casually casts a Silencing Charm at the man to to put a stop to the blue murder that's being sworn at him.
Why, he wondered, had Malfoy come looking for him after that embarrassing debacle? No doubt to complain about his behaviour just as everyone seemed to be doing these days. Harry's face burned thinking about how Malfoy had oiled him up and rubbed him down and made him so very bloody turned on. And then he'd done a runner and Malfoy had bloody well come after him. How had Malfoy even known where he was staying? That was suspicious in itself. There was something going on, Harry was sure of it. He just had to figure out what.
Draco puts the book down and takes a sip of whisky. As the smooth heat of it warms his throat, he recalls their tea break earlier in the day. Potter had returned to their shared desk with two cups of tea—black for Draco, and milk with three sugars for himself—and biscuits. But not just any biscuits,
Draco was pinning quite a significant number of hopes on one of his employees figuring out who the critic actually was. Not that any of his diners ever had a bad experience, or worse, bad food, but it would make life a lot easier if he knew who to focus his very best skills and magic on.
part of him was still standing by the tree in the Gryffindor common room clutching his first ever Weasley jumper.
involve him and his little bundle all alone, together against the world. That it might involve Potter in some way, and a Potter baby, and Draco felt those tears surfacing again as he sat down, and a whoosh of apprehensive joy as Potter squeezed his hand and silently asked with his eyes—green as shiny laurel leaves, beneath long dark lashes—if Draco was okay, and Draco nodded and squeezed back. "Hormones, eh," Potter whispered and rolled his eyes.
"Mmm. And she's been employee of the week seven times in the past three months. Gets a twenty pound bonus every time." Harry whistled low, and Draco smirked. "Might be
"Ah, of course. Well, we shall have to get working on a beak and tail for you too," she said kindly, running her fingers over the tangled knot of threads and fabric and placing them in her lap.
"A lovable nightmare," Draco concurred. "Now, let's go join our evil clan and watch your Australian wizard movie."
Draco had run through at least seventeen worst-case scenarios by the time the last person left (the seventeenth was that Chang had carked it, and the Dementors were going to arrive any minute to administer the Kiss), and he was well on his way to full-blown panicking when Potter spoke.
More questions than answers raced through Harry's mind, and he desperately needed to slow himself down. A calming charm might do it. He reached into the pocket of the shorts that he'd flung onto the floor beside him. He easily located his sunglasses and his wallet, but not his wand. A fresh wave of panic washed over him. The way he'd grabbed his things and
) that he's felt this way for so very, very long, and Potter's lips are tender and soft and waiting there above him.
“Well then, I want to say that I don't despise you at all and that you and I… should, er…” Harry faltered, and Draco dropped his eyes. “We should wipe the slate clean and, y’know, just be us, as we are now. What happened in the past happened. We’re Harry and Draco. Not Potter and Malfoy.”
And it's not long before sleep begins to pull him under, leaving him with a lingering feeling of how much he's in love with Harry Potter.
. If there's going to be more of this on offer,"—he dipped his head and kissed the side of Draco's mouth—"I definitely need to extend my leave."
. More than Draco had ever imagined he'd be. And Draco finds it hard to articulate any more than that. Being lost for a pithy description of his feelings is a new one for Draco, and ironically he's not sure how he feels about that.
"Master Draco," a voice called out, and there she was, Draco's copper kettle, proudly sitting atop a raised silver tray on the table, alongside none other than a smiling Mrs Potts. Relief washed over Harry like a balm.
"They are," Draco agreed, "And I'll need to ease off if I'm going to have any chance of managing the walk home." He was starting to feel a bit peaky himself, and couldn't quite decide if it was the however-many cocktails, or the last few details Potter had shared with him. He wondered whether Potter might regret going into
Potter heads out of the cell. Draco can vaguely hear him asking the duty Auror for something, a calming draught for the inmate, perhaps. Draco turns to Joanna, about to bid her goodbye before he follows Potter out and seals the poor witch in with a Colloportus.
," Draco snapped, "pureblood male wizards have been giving birth for millennia, and they’ll keep doing it for millennia more. Whether you think it's weird or not!"
Harry's stomach dropped. No doubt she'd brought Jamie along with her to throw Harry out for his awful behaviour.
She had come to that realisation all by herself, of course. And it had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the teapot in question reappearing in her kitchen later that same day with a wizened old house-elf in tow. A wizened old
Harry couldn't think like that though. Malfoy would sneer and ridicule him if he knew what was running through Harry's mind.
When it came to the contest all that mattered, however, was how the front of the house looked, and that included the garden. A well-manicured lawn was essential for a good appearance, and the judges always paid close attention too to how the shrubs and hedges were maintained and, of course, how pretty the flower beds looked. Potter’s garden was a
But when an antiseptic-smelling Malfoy rode Harry’s cock wearing nothing but marigolds and a short pinny, the squeak of rubber glove over stiff nipple obscene in the sterile quiet, Harry gripped their freshly-laundered sheets and thanked Merlin, Morgana and Salazar himself that his boyfriend was a flagrant and unapologetic dust phobe.
Potter must have seen the shock on his face, because he put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “When Cho fainted I completely panicked. I couldn’t think what I was supposed to do. I realise now I probably could have just sent a Patronus… to someone, to Ginny, to ask what to do. I just froze, and all I could think was to run to you. I knew you’d help.”
Potter frowned and stuck his fingers into his thick hair, scratching at his scalp. "I just... we've had such a perfect record. I don't know how we didn't detect that curse. It makes no sense."
low-slung swimwear, tall and muscular, with sun-bleached hair and broad shoulders, covered with an artful dusting of sand and salt.
Mrs Potts huffed. "And I'd do it again! If he wants to drink stale dust wrapped in paper, throw it in a mug and leave me out of it."
"Absolute piffle!" Hestia puffed. "The temperature of the water is the most crucial part. I'll have you know..."
Draco tried several more times but it was no good. He loved that memory. He decided to be open with Potter.
pair of Harry's shoes in the hall, and from sheer frustration had shouted 'By Merlin's beard, Potter, you might as well live here for the sheer volume of junk you manage to leave lying about this place!' In a rare moment of clarity—or temporary insanity—Harry had simply agreed and Draco's stunned silence had been worth all the galleons in Gringotts.
"You kinky bastard. I can certainly arrange a few stinging hexes the next time we..." Potter trails off and the pink of his cheeks turns crimson.
"So," Draco said, sitting next to Harry on the bed, "you're still getting those nightmares, then?". He looked worried. And in fairness to him, Harry did used to get the most horrific nightmares, but they'd not been so bad the last year or so. Harry put an arm around Draco's slender waist and pulled him closer, running his nose along the soft skin under his ear. He loved this man so much.
for w-w-work or even some new-age mind expansion purpose. Part of me did it just to get twisted and have some bloody fun.”
"Well, our kids have certainly been Confunded by his bloody Shotgun song. Like... like toddler-rats bewitched by a throaty-voiced pied piper! They play it over and over again, until you want to scrub your ears out with a strong Scourgify and drown yourself in firewhisky."
Draco goes in first, and as soon as Potter's in and has shut the door behind him, Draco's on him, pressing his face into Potter's neck. He smells like expensive aftershave and bacon grease, and it's gorgeous. Potter yelps and tries to push Draco off. And then Potter wilts into it, and it's fine.
Harry Potter, renowned for making the impossible possible (apart from taming his hair), and didn’t he teach that group of fifth years how to cast the spell, even Weasley and Longbottom who were usually hopeless at Charms? By the end of class Draco decided it had to be worth a try, and that he’d swallow his pride and take Potter up on his offer.
Vincent turned this way and that in front of the mirror. "Looks bloody terrifying." He turned to the other boys and grinned. "I love it!"
"Pick anything you want. Single malt whiskey? Glass of vintage champagne? Might as well spend all this money the Ministry pays me, it's not like I ever do back home."
That evening Draco stood naked in front of his bathroom mirror, stroking the gentle swell of his belly. It
“Please, everyone,” Draco said in his most authoritative tone, “stand back and give us some room,” and then he uttered “
They took a break after that and Draco tried to avoid talking to anyone, eschewing the selection of rice cakes on offer and opting to take his cup of tea to the window and look out over the city. He could easily spot the iconic structures of the Gherkin and Tower Bridge and, looking across the river, the strikingly raw and industrial Tate Modern building. He could see too quite a few green spaces breaking up the grey and silver of the city and began to think about how nice it would be be going for walks with the pram through the various parks dotted around the place, strolling around Stepney Green, and Haggerston, and maybe feeding the ducks in Mile End park. Hopefully they’d get a good summer; it’d been a pretty rainy June.
The use of his first name by Potter barely registered with Draco as he summoned the capacity to continue. He couldn't let his emotions best him. He took a sip from his drink and then a fortifying breath.
He’d messed it up. Before it had even had a chance to start. The thought seeped through him, cold and glutinous, that he could have had something with the man that had—let’s face it—been his fascination for so many years, and true to form, he’d managed to let it slip through his fingers.
After a moment of silence, Draco raised his wand and tapped the door several times, muttering as he did so. A series of knocking sounds came from within the cellar, and the door creaked open at last.
something to Draco. He'd felt his self-worth growing over the years he'd been away, felt his confidence bloom again after it had been cut back to its roots during the war, and though that should have been enough, this validation from Potter, the person he'd wanted to befriend, the person he'd wanted to
Madam Kite adjusted a few spells and said, “Right, I need to go do my rounds. There’s a buzzer there you can use to summon me if his condition changes.”
Upset, she threw them on the ground, but Harry crouched down to her level, picked them all up and said to her, “It’s alright, love,” whispering, “
In the morning Draco jerks awake with the realisation he's pressed chest to chest with Potter. He must have turned over in his sleep. The flood of relief, both in his own body and radiating from the still-sleeping Potter, is all kinds of intense.
"You're unreal," Potter snorted. "You are one hundred percent as nosy as me, you just don't want to admit it."
Draco's smile dropped, and sick adrenaline zipped through Harry for a second—had he misjudged this?—before Draco smiled again, a tentative thing this time, and said slowly, "Yes, I... rather think we are."
, but if you must know, Potter faints every time he sees a Dementor. We'll go onto the pitch while he's playing. And when he sees us, he'll freak out and faint, and Gryffindor will lose, and when he finds out it was me he'll glare at me for days and days! It will be glorious!"
And Draco blushed from his toes to the tips of his ears and felt like maybe, no matter the contest outcome, he'd already won.
. He supposed he might be able to execute wandless spellwork on it if he could calm down and focus himself. Or he could always
," Potter repeated in an amused tone, as he carefully freed Draco's fully hard cock from his joggers.
“I’ve been thinking about it. And you and Molly, you were right,” Harry announced when came downstairs after a three-hour sleep. Draco had busied himself while Harry was taking a recuperating nap, and set about the task of clearing up Harry’s house and making it more baby-friendly. He used all the spells he could think of, and a fragrant room spray of his own design, to declutter and clean, and before long had the place looking, and more importantly
.” He wasn’t sure why but he felt shy saying ‘Harry’ even though he’d just come all over him. ”But I’m completely shattered. Limp as a noodle. Feel free to continue…”—he gestured down at Harry’s tented joggers—“...against me.”
“Jesus,” grumbled a voice from behind Draco’s right shoulder, “the energy of the bloody life force.”
Harry wants to stay and be supportive and console the team, but he can't, not with this dizzying pain in his heart. The twist in his chest worsens on his broom ride home; he has no more cards to play, rules are rules. It still hurts like hell.
They began walking. Draco wasn’t sure whether to make a bit of small talk or just dive right in. Before he could decide, Potter took a deep breath, and Draco could feel the tiredness in his sigh. “I’m sorry,” he said.
Harry laughed. "He'll get over it. They've been at me for ages—him and Rotchburns—trying to find the

Repeated exposure to the spell will strengthen the pain experienced, and only the strong of heart will endure and ultimately overcome it.

"Do come on," Draco urged, "or the house's magic might rebel, just as the Manor's did. It was a ghastly time by all accounts, and it was all my great-grandmother could do to make him see sense before utter bedlam prevailed. You think that curse in the cellar was bad? That was a drop in the cauldron compared to what craziness we might have to endure. So, you

A silence descended after the waitress left, filled only by the unrepentant pep of that bloody Vengabus song. '
? Would they adopt, foster, or maybe, suggested Draco, they could talk to a Healer about getting tested for male pregnancy.  He’d never forget the look on Harry’s face at that revelation. They really ought to have been taught those things at Hogwarts.
There’s always music playing, mostly grime and hip hop that Draco doesn’t particularly care for, and CDs strewn about
much, at least. Encourage them but not stifle them, I suppose. I don’t know how good I’ll be at that, I… I just want them to be freer to do what
“I don’t know what to say. Or what I’ve done to deserve all this kindness. I really was terrible to you all.”
Draco's toothbrush wobbles in mid-air and then falls to the ground, bristles-down in the carpet, and Draco's mind oscillates wildly between thoughts of
(Luna), well, Harry reasoned the only way to get them to stop with their hippy dippy bullshit was to humour them. What was one night of loud music and crowds and noise and drunken dancing? He could handle it. Couldn’t be harder than battling Voldemort for seven straight years, could it? Or more difficult than the pain and exertion of rebuilding Hogwarts, brick by brick and spell by spell? And maybe, just maybe, it would be good for him—let no one say he wasn't open to this shit.
The sun is rising. The bodies have all been removed, and the dawn creeps across the now barren landscape, its cool hues turning warmer and banishing the murk.
And—if you asked him—Harry would have told you that he finally felt he belonged. Here, in this cottage, with cheeky kettles and teasing teapots and a mouthy Malfoy. And that he wouldn't have traded it. Not for all the tea in China.
know what he was. “Anyway, I’m disturbing your fun. Might see you around.” Malfoy stepped back, taking his warm breath with him, and he began moving to the music, bouncing on the spot as the tempo increased.
Mrs Potts laughed excitedly. "I told you so, I told you so," she chanted, puffing steam from her spout. "Now you
His knees buckled and he collapsed heavily sideways against the wall. Gabriel dropped the flowers and crouched down to take Draco in his arms.
And suddenly, like a lightning bolt, his focus was stolen... by a bloke with neon green hair glowing like a halo around him in the blacklight. He was moving rhythmically in the middle of the crowd,
"Doesn't count," she replied imperiously. "You're not a blood relative. Blood is thicker than water." And then, to a tune Harry vaguely recognised, she smugly sang, "
“Used to go, once upon a time. And I’d glamour up.” Draco swallowed. “Gabe, he didn’t like to be spotted with…”
Robards was only too happy to sign off on the annual leave request, and Harry began to wonder if the man wasn't also a bit relieved to have Harry gone for a while.
Service came to a close, and they all pitched in clearing up the restaurant. Titpie set all the plates, cutlery, pots, and pans to cleaning with some well-placed charms. Tiptoe took care of Scourgifying, Spritzifying and Scrubbifying all the work surfaces. Pineneedle and the other waiters looked after the remaining customers—and made sure they paid their Galleons—and Wattlepot (Norma), his front desk assistant, ensured they all got the correct robes, and of course the correct pointy hats for those Wixes who still wore them.
Malfoy held up his finger and pulled a pack of Hubba Bubba out of his pocket. Harry took a square without hesitation, unwrapped and chewed. It helped so much. It was the most perfect bursting pineapple flavour, like Molly's summer punch, and it made Harry want to cry with joy.
, as the potion’s effects started to hit harder, the idea that Malfoy was someone he had hated made him feel sick; it was of utmost importance that Malfoy should know he was loved, so loved, that he was forgiven.
cocktails a young Balinese lad at a pop-up bar had been feeding him earlier, all combined to make a heady holiday feeling. The sun was warming his naturally tanned skin, and his mind was emptying slowly of all responsibilities. Within a short while, thoughts of case files and stakeout protocols had faded completely into dreams of blue skies and surfer guys.
Harry hated that they were right. He also hated that his mates could remember more details of his sad and barren sex life than he could. But it had been work, work, work for years. You don't get to be
Draco walked home that afternoon via a different route to try to invigorate his mind, which had felt dull ever since Fordus had begun talking about Patronuses. Here and there along his walk, bits of the old Roman Wall of London—mossy brick ruins and restored medieval arches—could be seen peeking out between tall glass office blocks and rusty brick warehouses, and Draco admired the way the Muggles embraced the coexistence of the ancient and the strikingly modern.
“He’s such a darling!” she gushed, a grin still prominent on her face. “He offered me tea and vegan jaffa cakes, and we chatted and gossiped. It was delightful. And I've booked him in for a haircut and a beard trim next Saturday. I told him I'd tame that messy mop of his, and he hooted with laughter. And you know," she winked, "he's single like you. I think you two have a lot in common. I could see some Martin Miggs comics on one of his shelves, and Potter told me he’s a fan.”
“Shit.” Harry was breathing heavily, and he stood up, palming his bulge. “If I wasn’t so bloody ungainly I’d have wanked us both at the same time. Wait, I know, put your hand here.” He took Draco’s hand and placed it, palm open, against his crotch. Draco marvelled at how hard he was, and how big, and gave an appreciative squeeze. Harry groaned, and moved forward so that the back of Draco’s hand was against the sofa next to his hip, trapped between maroon upholstery and Harry’s hard-on. Then Harry began grinding into Draco’s palm, and all Draco had to do was squeeze a bit and rub a bit and lock eyes with Harry, incredible Harry, as he gave in to his own pleasure, rocking into Draco’s hand again and again and again and never breaking eye contact until he finally threw his head back and darkened his grey joggers with come right there in front of Draco.
He felt a wash of guilt for the way he'd spoken to Kirana, the poor desk clerk—and Jamie the concierge—as he'd demanded his room key and luggage in a mad panic. He was grateful to himself that he'd completed the requisite paperwork earlier that day, despite his room not being ready at the time. Flustered, Kirana handed him the key, complete with a tag bearing a bright silver '17'. He'd barely snatched the key and hurried a 'Thanks. Later!' before he was out the door and running along the path.
And in accordance with the time-honoured traditions of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, are bound by the stone and spellwork of the magical dwelling in which you reside... to attend... or suffer the consequences."
When Draco went on to speak about placing the wreath at the restored Fountain of Magical Brethren, Potter nodded and said "Yes, that's right," as if he clearly remembered seeing Draco at the ceremony, however it was his explanation of the significance of the wreath—
Luckily, after the break there was no hideous role play or other exercise where they needed to pair up, so Draco was free to concentrate on the blessedly
Magister Placid glares at Jeffrey. But Jeffrey nods his head, bottom lip trembling. It's all the answer Potter needs before he's taking a step towards the Magister, wand raised.
Draco couldn’t speak. He knew that Harry loved him but he'd never had it laid out like that, in front of their children. And it loosened an aching lump inside of him, the one that got in the way whenever Harry shut him out of his Halloween mourning.
Despite his sharp words, Harry didn't miss Draco's shy sidewards glance, and the flush high on his cheeks, just as he felt an answering blush bloom on his own face.
Potter was fucking with him. Potter was totally fucking with him, and Draco had been stupid enough to have actually fallen for it.
Draco told Harry about his parents—about a visit to his father in Azkaban, about his mother's descent into mental ill health and his dilemma and subsequent guilt about having her committed to St Mungo's. He ran through each event and his personal reactions to it unselfconsciously, without any humiliation or awkwardness. Harry felt privileged to listen.
Draco clearly indicated on the form what sort of birth environment he favoured, which pain relief he was happy to use, and which he wasn’t, what his preferred birthing positions were, and his preferences for cutting the cord. He overheard Potter at one point mumbling to someone, and when he snuck a glance he was able to just about hear him scoffing to Langston about mood lighting and aromatherapy. Draco grit his teeth. He was even more glad Potter wasn’t sitting next to him; he wasn’t in the mood to have to defend his choices of citrus blossom and clary sage candles (though Draco knew the very real uses and benefits of both inside out). When he got to the part asking who his birthing partner was going to be, he paused. He hadn’t really thought about who would accompany him. Well, that wasn’t strictly true, he’d more avoided thinking about it. Not Gabriel,
Draco relaxed and tried to put thoughts of Potter’s lush lips out of his mind. After a minute, Potter came through with a tray. He passed Draco a mug of tea, decaf apparently, offered him a biscuit straight from the packet (chocolate Digestives) and began chuckling.
They share a glance, and Draco knows they are both agreed that there is something extremely fishy going on. They do their best to calm Joanna down, her hiccups eventually subsiding entirely.
Malfoy. He smirked and continued dancing, moving towards Harry. Harry was vaguely aware that he should be panicking. Draco Malfoy was
tight. He didn’t want to hurt him. But Harry squeezed back and Draco was overcome with relief that he really was okay. Reluctantly he stepped back to let Granger smother him in kisses too.
what it had felt like. "Rather than being a sex drug its more a… well a..." Draco looked troubled and Harry knew what he was trying to say.
"In case I was leading a group of Balinese Neo-Death Eaters? Hell-bent on doing Muggles in with incredibly good massages?"
him, and he looked at Potter too, properly looked—the man was spellbindingly gorgeous, even with his clothes on—and at one point he even grabbed Potter's wrist in disbelief when Potter mentioned the comprehensive
That may not have been obvious from the frown on his face as he hurried along Cheapside, trying to avoid stepping in puddles in his good Vans (the ones Gabe had customised for him with the black and white checkerboard and green apple print) or indeed bumping into passers-by, which was easier said than done when he was sporting a baby bump the size of a watermelon.
Potter steps forward, his wand trained on Placid. "Nothing funny now, Placid," he says with a hint of a smile, though the underlying meaning is abundantly clear.
Malfoy had reviewed Hermione's itinerary and folder and culled it significantly, gleefully putting red lines through all her 'tourist trap nonsense' with a red biro, cross-referencing it with his own recommendations and setting out some loose plans at 'a much more relaxed pace'.
Mrs Potts sat quietly on the counter-top nearby, tea leaves in place and lid sitting by her side. Harry lifted the kettle to fill it with water only to be shrieked at.
But Potter is straight in with, "We will of course turn them over to you if they are not required for our investigation. And if they are, we can provide you with copies." Trust him to remember their first year training when it really counts.
“What do the Weasleys tease you about?” Hermione asked as she sat down at the table, looking prim and proper in her tailored suit. Though the slight frown on her face made her look a bit petulant. “Assuming you were talking about them.”
“Yes, Malfoy, what can I do for you?” Hermione asked, one eyebrow raised, as she sat back in her chair and turned her body to face him in interest. What could he possibly be interrupting her report-writing for?
“You know how she is, Draco. She won’t see it that way.” Harry rubbed Draco’s back in soothing circles. Draco gripped his shoulders and pushed him back to arms length, glaring.
Hermione blushed at their comparisons, while not wrong they were telling of how well the Weasley boys knew her. With a few exceptions they really felt like an extended family. She reached beneath the table and squeezed Draco’s hand as she was overwhelmed with love for them.
“Well, are you coming or not Malfoy?” Hermione shot back over her shoulder, her nose raising ever so slightly into the air as her heels clicked on the marble floors. His throaty chuckle followed her as she pressed the button to summon the lift. His hand fell on her shoulder and she flinched on instinct. “Do we have to, really?” Her voice came barely above a whisper as she relaxed into his touch.
Harry turned and exited the office, pausing at the door frame. “We’ll get him back on his feet, sir.” He squared his shoulders and made his way toward the lifts that would take him to the lobby and beyond to Valere Apothecary where he knew he would find Severus bent over steaming cauldrons.
Thank you everyone for sticking with me as this chapter fought tooth and nail to not be written. I've skipped around multiple times in an effort to get past writer's block in this one. I apologize that it took so long to post this chapter. I've started a new job, yay! The only down side is getting used to having a new schedule and also making time to write. So thank you all for hanging in there and I hope this chapter is well received, even though it was difficult to get it written.
Properly chastised Harry took the stairs two at a time to the master suite, pulling loose his clothing along the way. He waved his wand to summon the “Draco Approved” outfit to hover beside him as he hastily stripped down and changed. In less than ten minutes he had changed clothes, freshened his breath and hair, and made it back to the kitchen in what he considered record time.
“I love it when you go all haughty on me.” Harry nibbled on Draco’s neck briefly before being pushed away.
“We just received word from Saint Mungo’s that Auror Thomas’ condition has worsened. If Severus can create an antidote for him then he may just survive this.” Kingsley stood and paced toward the enchanted windows that looked out into the desert. “Whoever sent that cake meant for it to kill Miss Granger. As it stands we will need to make an example of the perpetrator. Even if it ends up being a decorated war hero. Are we understood?” He solemnly clasped his hands behind his back.
“Auror Potter, now, is it?” Harry frowned at the distance she was emotionally putting between them. “Capable is never in question, but you have to understand, love, that you can’t go back there.” The endearment slipped through in his attempt to reach her.
Draco scoffed and went to snatch the paperwork from Harry. “Of course you would finish before everyone else. Typical Potter.” He muttered as he looked over the forms as if questioning their authenticity.
A groan escaped her lips as she struggled to find a comfortable position to relieve the throbbing down below. There was nothing for it, apparently, she would just have to take herself in hand to solve the problem.
“Oh, Draco, you’re flattering me. Expertise, honestly.” Molly blushed at the perceived compliment and smiled at him. “To attain that level of mastery you would need to be at least as active as I am. I make a cake for each of the boys, the girls, and even their wives. So I’m making a cake almost every month of the year, sometimes twice in one month. So I would say two years of that would have them quite beyond proficient enough to make a cake in a shape with a longer message and have it look like it came from a bake shop.”
“Come on now, you know how important this new line is, Gred.” A stone settled in Draco’s gut. Who was Gred? He waited for a response but instead was treated to George’s frustrated groan of “Right. After this is done. It’s the last time. I swear.” Draco’s hand lowered and his brows drew together. What could George be working on that was so important, that he wasn’t working on it with another Weasley but this Gred fellow?
Harry squared his shoulders and walked past the counter and knocked on the door labeled ‘office’, there was a sound from inside that could have been a groan, before the door opened of its own accord and a pale hand waved him over to the sole chair that sat on the visitor’s side of the desk.
Harry stilled and looked down into the tempestuous eyes of his lover. Nodding he took a few deep shuddering breaths and he released his grip on them. Settling back on his calves he stroked the outside of Draco’s thigh to help settle him.
“We’ve had to cordon off your apartment until further notice. Seeing as it’s a crime scene.” Harry interjected gently.
Draco Malfoy heaved a long-suffering sigh as he ran a hand through his platinum blonde hair. “Granger, do you remember what we talked about this morning?” He settled into a challenging stance and stared down his nose at her haughtily.
Sorry for the long delay in updates. My Depression and Anxiety are double-teaming me lately since I am an essential worker during this pandemic and I live in a third world country masquerading as a first world country. Thank you so much for sticking with me this far and I hope you enjoy this update.
“Oh, hullo Ron, nice to see you hard at work.” George stood and blocked Ron’s view of the table. “How, may I ask, are our supplies getting ordered if you’re not taking stock and doing the job I asked of you?”
Draco’s smile didn’t quite reach his eyes. “It wasn’t my intention to set her off with that you know. But Merlin was she glorious spread wide, buried to the third knuckle, quivering.” A shudder passed through him and his cock twitched.
“Oh! Harry. I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you come in.” Hermione smiled brightly and attempted to fix the flyaway hairs that seemed to work themselves loose whenever she got too excited. “Yes, we should go out. We should celebrate.”
Draco sheathed his wand and nodded to Kreacher. “Seal the room, leave us to work this out, and please make sure Crookshanks gets his breakfast. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.” The dismissal in his words was clear and Kreacher popped out of the room. Draco sat on the floor next to Hermione and wrapped an arm around her shoulder.
He started sliding her stocking down her leg and she turned to face him, “Harry, hurry.” She threaded her fingers through his hair and pulled his face forward into her knickers. His hot breath drew a whimper of need from her. He pulled back and urged her to sit on the edge of the bed with a gentle nudge. He finished pulling off her stockings and stood, gazing down at her glorious naked body, her legs spread in invitation and he groaned. With a flick of his wand a red and gold jersey came sailing out of an unused trunk in the closet, Potter emblazoned on the back. He pulled his old quidditch jersey over her and kissed her softly.
“Please, stop calling me that. If you have to call me anything just call me Harry.” Harry pleaded for the dozenth time with the spirit of Death.
Grey clouds roiled above the heads of a half-dozen men and women. Hermione’s mood mirrored the tumultuous skies above. Her colleagues were at a loss as to how one of the beloved members of the Patil household had vanished without a magical or mundane trace. Hermione strode toward the tall intricately-carved front doors of the palatial manor house. She took a deep breath to steady and center herself, grasped the gilded door handle, and stepped inside to interview the family members.
“Holly has come home. Holly was caring for her mother.” The high pitched voice was timid when she spoke. Her hands shook and her gaze fell to the floor. “Holly has caused much trouble for Miss Auror Hermy Granger. Holly is very sorry.” She pulled away from Hermione and bowed so low the tips of her ears touched the ground.
“Now, my dear, come tell me all about your fabulous career.” Narcissa’s hand trembled slightly as she reached again for her cup and saucer.
The cool air of the library brushed against her exposed labia and a shudder ran through her body. “Don’t make me punish you, Granger.” She imagined the sultry drawl in her ear and her fingers slipped through her folds as the scene played out in her overactive mind.
“It’s from Sev. He’s down to two possible poisons depending on the symptoms. He’s already got both antidotes in progress because the poisons both can kill in seventy two hours.” Harry sagged in relief and let out an incredulous laugh. “He said we had bought Dean another day and a half with that, and I quote, ridiculous habit of shoving a bezoar in anything that’s poisoned.”
Draco leaned down and whispered intimately into her ear as his eyes caught and held Ronald Weasley’s. “Just remember to breathe, and if he instigates don’t rise to the bait, Granger.” Oh, Draco was going to enjoy taunting the Weasel with what he had done. He glanced at Hermione as she gave a slow blink in his direction, a smile spread across his lips. She was using one of their signals to indicate that she trusted Draco to do what was necessary. He was constantly amazed with how much trust he had been given by both of them. His partners. His smile softened and they closed the gap to the table together.
“It seems our faith in Master Snape is ever rewarded. Mister Potter, you must go to him and the moment those antidotes are done brewing take him to administer them to Mister Thomas.” Kingsley dropped into his chair and leaned over resting his elbows on his knees, hands clasped.
Harry was brought out of his musing by shouting from outside his door. He leapt up and made it to the break nook in record time, Hermione and Neville hot on his heels. He found Draco leaned over Dean Thomas casting every spell he could think of to determine the cause and stem the convulsions of the man who had no love for him. “What in the hell happened here?” Harry barked and someone shouted “The cake, sir!” while another voice shouted “Accio! Bezoar!” and in Harry’s hand was pressed a solid weight. Poison. Harry quickly pulled Dean up, tilted his head back, and shoved the bezoar as far down his throat as he could manage, then massaged the esophagus of the slowly dying man until it passed into his stomach to work at absorbing and neutralizing whatever poison Ron had decided to put in that blasted cake.
The lights in the room flickered, the sparking became a crackle reminiscent of distant thunder and before Hermione could murder the two women, Arthur put up a shield, blocking the two women into a corner of the kitchen, blackening it to cut off the sight of them.
The floo roared to life behind them and Draco and Hermione stepped out together to a chorus of “‘Mione!” and “Oi, Malfoy!” and before you could say quidditch the three of them became surrounded by redheads. There was much jostling, shoulder clapping, hugging, and all around merriment.
Harry strode up to Hermione and kissed her cheek before stealing a bite of her food, chuckling at her cry of protest and slight smack of reprimand on his arm.
“Draco. Please.” Harry’s words echoed Hermione’s own as he pulled at his lover’s tie, crushing their lips together.
A tiny energetic ball of feathers bashed repeatedly against the kitchen window of number twelve Grimmauld Place early Friday morning. The three residents looked up and Hermione and Draco locked eyes and grimaced at one another. His breakfast forgotten, Harry rose and opened the window before the tiny owl could hit the glass again. The owl flew with determination through the open window and knocked right into Harry’s chest, tumbling down into his waiting hands. “Hullo there, Pig.” He chuckled as he carried the tiny thing over to the table and set it down between the plates and the platter of bacon. Once he oriented himself, Pigwidgeon hopped toward Harry and held out his leg where a tiny slip of parchment was tied. Harry reached out, retrieving the note, and petted Pig between his eyes. “Thanks, Pig. You don’t need to wait for me.”
“Had a bad dream.” She said between sips. “Crooks was hanging up, like Mrs. Norris in second year.” She nibbled on a biscuit, attempting to let the caffeine bring her back to alertness. She most certainly wasn’t at peak performance first thing after waking.
“Mistress is attempting to leave the safety of home. Kreacher cannot allow her to leave. Masters have ordered it.” He bowed deeply, his bony hand still wrapped around Hermione’s wrist as she struggled against his grip. Tears welling in her eyes.
They both worked in companionable silence until Severus let out a small huff of annoyance. “This blasted thing.” He grumbled as he set his stirring rod on the table with a clang. “This is the fifth attempt and it has only now decided to behave. Bring me the phials. Tri-dose, crystal, bulbous.”
“What was that Granger? Another Weasley gift?” Draco shook his cloak out and placed it next to hers and rounded to watch the latest irritant be disposed of.
“You promised Harry that you would go. Before you knew that he would be there you were also quite excited to get to see Longbottom again.” Draco slid his hand down to her shoulder blades and gave her a little nudge as the doors to the lift opened. He quirked an eyebrow at her mutinous expression and depressed the brass knob for the ministry’s atrium.
“Oh! I heard about that. You had some great row that went down in the training history books. When was it? Your second month, right? Heard you busted out the Judo moves and knocked him flat on his arse in front of the whole class.” Alice’s entire face lit up in excitement.
“She was. She is. I know that I was being a bit jealous earlier. I’m sorry. I know that we love each other but I can’t say that the love I have for her is platonic anymore. I’ve been putting my feelings for her away for so long that I had myself convinced that she was like a sister to me.” Harry glanced down at his lover’s pale stomach, refusing to meet his eyes.
“We made it, by some miracle.” Draco smoothed his napkin onto his lap and leaned toward Harry. “Thank you for indulging me in a public date.” His voice droppped conspiratorily.
“Oh, it’s nothing my dragon. The annual audit of the properties. One of the alchemy books is missing, but it’s probably just been misplaced or improperly logged. It’s the one that great uncle Alphard wrote while he was obsessed with necromantic theory. It was probably seized by the ministry and improperly removed from our inventory list. Alphard Malfoy’s interests always leaned toward the dark and obscure.” Narcissa waved it off and turned to Hermione.
He pulled his spiral note pad and ball point from his pockets and flipped to a sheet bearing the name of this establishment. If he couldn’t find a lead from here he would have to approach people who may hold a grudge against Hermione, and that would be an awkward conversation to be having with people who you knew personally. It was always more difficult when you knew, or thought you had known, the suspects.
Arthur nodded and looked down the table to Bill. “You boys were given that strict talk that we don’t follow certain traditions because of my experience with the abuse of such potions. Your mother and I have not always been on the same page as far as the future goes. I know what it is to have your choice taken from you.” His eyes fell to the cup in front of him and Narcissa laid a supportive hand on his shoulder. He took a deep breath and continued. “Your mother has made some mistakes, no one is perfect. When we first were courting we had many arguments because she thought I had an unhealthy interest in one of her brothers. You know how defensive she gets…” The silence stretched, no one dared speak. “We had argued, and afterward while I was still upset she gave me food laced with a love potion. She hadn’t calculated the dosage properly and even though I wasn’t interested we ended up intimately involved and that was how you were really conceived William.” He shot his eldest son a watery smile and turned his blue eyes on Hermione. “While we have ended up happily married and blessed with seven fantastic children, I myself would have liked to wait to start a family until a bit later.”
“Draco! Please!” Her legs collapsed from beneath her, leaving her heaving and panting on the desk, eyes closed as her orgasm rocked her. She missed the soft click of the door shutting and the creaking of the stairs as her unintended audience left her to come down in ignorance.
“Still, sir, you should join us next time. I think Hermione would enjoy another debate with you. Imagine what the two of you could come up with if you stopped walking on eggshells around each other.” Harry slipped his hands in his pockets and observed his former professor.
“Harry. Draco. I’m sorry.” Hermione’s voice was soft as she stared down at the scrunched and pinched face of her cat. “I know that you trust me. You’ve both shown it time and again over the years. I’m being silly, of course.” She glanced up at Draco, whose knees brushed against her own. “I don’t take well to being coddled.”
Draco took a long sip of his wine before responding. “Even though you don’t enjoy the publicity that being their hero brings, you enjoy going nice places with me, admit it.” His smile was wistful and a bit sad.
Draco Malfoy was at his wit’s end. Hundreds of cake shops in London alone and every one he visited was a bust. He stood outside the last one on his list of places that could have made the cake and took a steadying breath. He would not let his frustration rule him. Setbacks are only ever minor and usually lead them to the right path to go down. He entered Muffett’s Fine Confections with his expectations low and took notice of the pretty girl manning the till. He waited in line as the other patrons plades their orders and when he stepped up before the young blonde girl he nodded. “I need to speak with the proprietor.” He flashed a muggle styled investigator’s badge and watched her eyes widen as she nodded dumbly. He stepped out of line and leaned against the wall nearest the counter.
“It’s not all bad, though, at least we can finally spend more time together. Eh?” Harry joked, trying to lighten the mood.
Harry set two matching green mugs of tea on the dining table in his kitchen as the door clicked shut. He glanced up at Draco and frowned. “Is she still under?” He asked, turning to embrace his lover. Draco rested his forehead on Harry’s shoulder and a brief nod was the only confirmation he needed. Hermione would likely be out for a few hours, she had been pushing herself too hard lately since the breakup. Harry frowned. “She always takes on too much at once.”
He flicked his wand and the photo rejoined the rest of the paperwork shifting lazily in patterns to help Hermione think. “We should probably go back and interview the elves. We were interrupted the other day, after all. It will get us out of the office for more than a few hours and keep your mind off things like the Weasel.”
Harry grinned and pulled the stack to him, glancing through the reports, diagnostics, and meticulous process of elimination attached behind the progress report. Of course, this would only be a copy as Severus always kept originals for his own records should the reports be somehow ‘lost’ and refused compensation as they often were when he first began. Harry was hit with a wave of nostalgia and smiled up at the dour man.
Hermione Granger, of all people, burst into their shared office space. Draco had been awaiting the assignment of his training partner with some trepidation. Merlin, anyone but Potter, please. He had prayed, and how Merlin had a sense of humor. He stood abruptly and took in her perfectly groomed appearance from sensibly heeled shoes up to her tightly wrapped hair piled into a bun on top of her head. “Granger.” Draco swallowed what remained of his nerves and came around the edge of ‘his’ desk to extend his hand in peace.
“Let’s go see him, I just heard that he’s awake again.” Draco led her into a floo to take her to Saint Mungo’s, none the wiser to the glaring green eyed monster who had witnessed their intimate moment.
“Thank you.” He accepted the glass and took a measured sip, savoring the burn of the alcohol. “I believe you know what happened to Auror Thomas the other day.” At George’s solemn nod Draco continued, “Thomas was not the intended target. We- no. I failed to detect anything more serious on the food item and though I managed to keep him alive, I still put the lives of my fellow aurors in danger.” He took another sip and stared into the charred hearth as if seeking the answers to the universe within.
“Welcome back.” Draco smiled down at her, his hands continuing their soothing rhythm. “Shall we see what the little piggy has brought us?” He pulled a reluctant laugh from her that sounded more like a scoff and they focused their attention on Harry, whose brows had knit together in concern. “Well, don’t keep us waiting. What does he want?” His hands stilled on Hermione’s shoulders as he waited for his lover’s bad news.
She hummed and pulled up a case file, flicking her wand and wordlessly spreading the sheafs of parchment through her side of the room on a semblance of a murder board. They had recovered more information about Holly the disappearing house elf, there were no signs of a struggle. It was as if Holly just walked away from her family. Which would be possible if the Patil family didn’t love and care for her as one of their own. “I suppose we should focus on the mission until Harry decides he can’t solve my case without us.”
“Hermione, please love, look at me.” Harry’s voice began to grow heavy with sorrow and when she refused to look up at him his eyes met Draco’s and he tried to plead with him silently to help pull her out of this.
The fact that her best friend had been looking directly at them when the threat was delivered seemed to act as a catalyst.
“Don’t tell me what to do with my fiance, ferret.” He tried to yank his wrist free of the vice-like grip. “She’s come back to me, and now you’re jealous.”
Days passed the trio by in a whirlwind of petty crimes, misdemeanors, and increasingly desperate gifts from one Ronald Weasley. For the third time that week Hermione had walked into her office to find a container of sweets or a bouquet of flowers on her desk which she promptly dumped into the bin. Today, however, it seems he had decided to step up the gift giving and a large silver cloche-covered platter sat on her desk.
Harry launched himself at Draco’s lips and kissed him fiercely. “I had given up on her, for his sake. For the sake of a found family and her happiness I had let her go. You and I made it through their travesty of a relationship and built our own from the ashes of our past. She may never love us the way we do her, even if she wanks to us occasionally, you know.” He pressed his forehead to Draco’s and took a deep breath. The heavy conversation deflating his libido.
There was a scuffle in the lab and a curse before the lab door was flung open and a disheveled and drawn looking George Weasley stepped out, straightening his waistcoat. “Terribly sorry Verity. Got caught up working on that new- oh, hullo Malfoy.” He reached out and shook Draco’s hand before looking him over. “You look like hell. Let’s grab a drink while we talk. We could probably both use it.” He led Draco through the bowels of the shop and into the owners’ office. George directed him to a plush armchair by the hearth while he arranged hard muggle liquor for them both.
“It’s almost like he’s trying to provoke me at this point. Levi-o-Sorry. Honestly.” She rested her head on Neville’s shoulder and gave his hand a squeeze.
Harry cast another spell over it and nodded. “If you want to, put it in the break nook and let it get eaten. I know a couple of the lads will get a laugh at the attempt. Er, if that’s alright with you, Hermes?”
Draco left with the cake to deposit it in the break nook and Harry leaned against his desk watching Hermione wildly gesticulate as an echo of her temper flared during her explanation. Her cheeks flushed, arms flailing, hair trying to break free of its confines, all of it sent a warmth spreading through him. She was finally back to being the lively witch he had fallen for. He would not lose her again, especially to someone like Ronald Weasley.
Mr. Patil nodded sternly and stood to leave. “Come, Holly, we have much to do.” Holly jumped to her feet and trailed after Mr. Patil at a trot as he strode toward the exit of the department.
“The usual.” She stood and patted his cheek while he was defenseless. “You know, it was surprising that it happened so soon, but it wasn’t unexpected. Are you done? Have you calmed down?” She backed away and took in his disheveled appearance and clucked her tongue at him. “I’d just done this tie up.” She released her hold on him and straightened his tie again.
Neville smiled at Hermione before glancing at the cake with a low whistle. “He really dug deep for that one. I honestly thought he had forgotten that class. Though, I never could forget what an ass he was. He made my first real friend cry.” He reached over and held Hermione’s hand rubbing the back of it with his thumb.
Hermione glanced up at the sharp rap on her door as it immediately swung wide to admit one Mr. Pavan Patil and Holly the house elf. Holly, the missing house elf. Hermione stood, her chair scraping across the stone floor. “Holly!” She rushed around to kneel in front of the little elf in a rather pretty dress. “Oh, Mr. Patil, wherever did you find her?” Hermione reached out and grasped Holly’s hand as if to prove that she was actually in her office.
The auror department was abuzz with activity that afternoon as a risky raid on a cache of dark artifacts was finally winding down into categorizing the goods, healing the injured, and writing reports by the auror teams involved. The excited buzz drowned out the sharp clicking of expensive heeled leather boots approaching Hermione's office door.
“It’s… complicated.” Harry set his wand on the bedside table and knelt in front of Hermione. “Love, we’re worried about you. We have some of the best protective wards here at Grimmauld. The Blacks were so paranoid about being attacked that they have dozens of layers to their wards.” He tried to appeal to her logical side and reached out to stroke down her arm in a way that was meant to be soothing and yet prompted her tears to fall faster.
“It wasn’t a dream, Crookshanks was found in your apartment. Potter called us to the scene, do you recall?” Draco asked as he eyed her warily.
“How proficient did Ginevra become at pastries and decoration?” Draco picked up a biscuit and turned it over in his hands, projecting an air of boredom and reluctance to ask these questions.
Heromione woke in their bed. She was suffocatingly hot, bodies pressed into her on either side, limbs a tangle under the duvet. She came to awareness slowly, reluctant to leave the comfort and safety of the strong arms that pulled her close. Her bladder, however, had other ideas and made its presence known. Hermione pushed the covers down slowly and tried to delicately remove herself from between Harry and Draco’s sleeping forms. Harry groaned as she moved and he hooked a leg over Draco’s and pulled him closer as she extracted herself. She quietly made her way to the attached bathroom and began her morning routine.
“Oh, she never quite reached my level of decorative magic, she could easily write out a short message like ‘happy birthday’ but it would look nearly illegible. She doesn’t have much patience for the delicate spells involved. Short fused, that one.” Molly relaxed and took another sip of tea, gazing out the back window.
“Of course I do. You may be a peacock, but you’re mine. I don’t know where we would be without each other. Plus, you’re pretty skilled.” Harry winked. No subtlety at all, clearly his Gryffindor showing through after the years. Despite Draco’s many efforts to bring out his Slytherin side there were some things that his love would never be subtle about. Innuendo wasn’t Harry’s strong suit.
Hermione turned to look at Harry with incredulity written across her features. “You’re having me on.” She scoffed and looked back at Draco, “Can you believe this, Draco? He’s not...going to…” Her words trailed off at Draco’s grim expression.
“Well, it’s from Arthur. Apparently Ron gave them Pig since he can use George’s owl whenever he needs and they never did replace Errol. Arthur wants us round for brunch this Sunday.” Harry tapped the parchment against his hand absently, “Molly insists, of course, that we’ve been too long since our last one. He says that Ron will be otherwise indisposed and that if she’s free they would all love to see Hermione at a family gathering.” He frowned and tossed the parchment to an empty space as far from them as it could get. “Indisposed” He scoffed, “I hope they have a damn good way to keep him distracted if Hermes is going to step one foot in Ottery St. Catchpole.”
“I’ll let Professor Sprout decide what to do with you lot.  The rest of you, scram. Get to class. Don’t loiter.”
“You know, the best way to get to Hogsmeade is by convertible.” His hand was still draped around Strawberry Blonde.  “I know it might seem like only a short walk from the castle, but you really haven’t lived until you’ve taken the long way around, winding through the mountains. It takes a good hour longer, but it’s worth it. There are so many great places to stop and look at the views, among other things.”
The pages contained more detailed drawings of genitals, diagrams of sex positions they didn’t even know exists, love spells to make women do anything you wanted, and more.  Two hours later, their heads were spinning, and each had a pillow over their laps, trying to hide the excitement they’d been feeling from each other.  While they both had gained some notoriety around Hogwarts High in the past few years, neither of them had been able to get past a few makeout sessions since coming to the high school, if you didn’t count Hermione grabbing Ron’s penis last month.  This book could change everything.
“Fred and George certainly are geniuses.” Harry responded. The portrait of the fat lady was now in sight, and they could hear her snoring.  Harry took off the invisibility cloak and said as kindly as possible, “erm, excuse me. I’ve been in the headmaster’s office - can you wake up to let me in? The password is apple butter toffee.”
The girls all blushed bright red as the tallest of them reluctantly handed Filch a text book from her bag.
Tired didn’t even begin to cover it.  Harry and Ron had fallen asleep on Harry’s bed while pouring over the book.  At some point, Harry had started to take notes of moves he wanted to try, and woke up with his face pressed onto his notebook.  It had taken lots of scrubbing for Harry to get “reverse cowgirl” and “buy her a drink” off of his cheek.
“Shhhh. Not so loud. No, we didn’t find anything, but we did go someplace. I’ll fill you guys in later. Where is Ron, anyway?”
“Tales of the Well-Hung Prince? A gentleman’s guide to bedding your favorite witches and bitches?” Harry read from the opening page. “Man, what even is this?”
He knew this year would be different. There was his mission that he couldn’t forget about, this whole business of being a double agent, but right now that didn’t matter.  He could pretend he was a normal, magical high school junior back for his 6th year at Hogwarts Academy.   Putting his sunglasses back on, Draco realized that Blaise had been talking to him. What was he saying?
Ron and Harry exchanged looks while Ron mouthed “invisibility cloak” to Harry while Hermione was looking away.  They had to get their hands on that book.
Hermione’s hands nervously went to her outfit, to straighten her skirt.  With a shock, she realized it was almost above her hips.  She pulled it back down to her knees instantly.   She could have sworn her entire body was bright fuscia at that moment.
“No no no, not s-s-sex.” Ron said, looking at his lap and blushing. “Blimey, I meant on this couch. Sleeping. Next to each other.”
“Ron, don’t be daft! We didn’t have sex last night!” Hermione retorted, hoping the sass would cover up the blush that was still raging on her face.
Draco passed Pixie Cut’s hand to Blaise’s while he walked back-and-forth three times in front of an empty patch of wall.  He and Blaise had done this so many times over the past years that he knew exactly the room he needed.  The girls, reminding Draco strongly that the were in fact 4th years, gasped with alarm when a door appeared in the wall. Looking at Blaise, Draco could tell what he was thinking: This never gets old. Draco grabbed Pixie Cut’s hand and guided her into the new room.
“Hermione, er, um, what’s happening?”  He seemed almost immediately to register her blush and look of horror, and realized something was wrong.  “Is something wrong? Where’s Harry?”
Snape walked through the faculty common room and headed back to his quarters.  He was fuming. He felt apoplectic. How could he have been so careless? Why hadn’t he burned that book when he had a chance?
“What on earth is that?” Harry asked, looking at the black rope-like strand Ron was pulling from a bag and untangling.
Ron and Hermione wake up after pulling an all-nighter researching horcruxes.  Did they sleep next to each other? And what is digging into Hermione's back?
“Spermio removio,” Ron muttered, waving his wand over his body.  Fred and George had made him memorize that spell as soon as he finished puberty, promising it to be the most useful spell for jacking off and, allegedly, for once he started having sex - it was the most effective magical birth control.
“-right there, but once I got the gunk cleared from my keyhole, the book was gone.  We need to stop these little rulebreakers, wherever they are.” Filch was saying.
Ron stroked himself harder remembering how in his dream, Gabrielle turned to Hermione, tangling one hand in her hair and grabbing a breast in the other one, and had pulled her in for a kiss.  Ron moaned remembering how vivid this had been in his dream.  Hermione had grasped Gabrielle’s body in her hands in response, letting loose a moan that came out as bubbles.  Before Ron knew it, they had taken off each other’s watery gowns and he could see every inch of their bodies.  After watching them make out and touch each other for a while, they floated towards him, pulling his clothes off smoothly.  Gabrielle started kissing him while Hermione lowered herself to his dream erection.  The last thing he remembered was her grasping it in her hand and guiding it into her mouth.
“Oh, wow, okay. So, um, as long as we’re on the same page.” Hermione said, quickly standing up to go to the other side of the room. “Well, I guess I should go back to my room before Potions.”  She grabbed her bag, threw the books in it, and hurried away as quickly as she could.
“Wh-wh-what? What did you hear? What did she say??” Ron said, his blush creeping back over his whole face.
He gasped as Pixie Cut unsheathed him, wrapping her fingers around his rock hard shaft before putting her lips to his tip and beginning.  From this angle, all he could make out was the back of her head, that dark hair that had become unruly with their fooling around.  It was ridiculous how much it looked like Potter’s hair from this angle.  God if he was ever left alone with Potter, unlikely given those two shadows of Potter’s. He’d love that though. He could finally just take care of the problem that the Dark Lord tried to remedy all those years ago.  He would punch him in his stupid face, and knock that wand out of his hand before Potter could use that unendurable Expelliarmus spell. And he could just beat him up, like a man, so he could feel Potter’s pain. No magic, just a full-on wailing. And then Potter would have to look up at him through his puffy eyes and his blood-strewn face and would know that Draco was about to end hi--
“What book?” Harry asked, while Ron tried to avert his eyes, not wanting to think about Hermione in the bath.
“I didn’t hear all of it, but it sounds like a book is being passed around with some lewd drawings. Kind of immature, if you ask me.”
Three hours later, after the opening feast, Draco was holding hands with Pixie Cut, following Blaise down the corridor.  Blaise had his arm around Strawberry Blonde, and was trying to casually undo her blue tie while he was walking. What were their names again? Draco guessed it didn’t really matter.
A short one this week, bringing in two of my favorite characters, Fred and George. Happy Christmas everyone!
“Oops,” Ron whispered next to Harry’s ear, as they climbed the stairs quietly. “That’s the weird thing about it being licorice.  It does get sticky when it’s warm, and kind of melty.  But that should keep Filch from knowing what it does.”
Laying back on his bed, Ron spit into his hand and started stroking his erection, slowly at first.  He tried to think of the muggle magazines that Fred and George had given him last summer, full of girls removing their skimpy bikinis, but his mind kept drifting back to that dream.  He’d been back in the lake in their 4th year with Hermione, Gabrielle, and Cho.  Cedric had just saved Cho when a merperson took Ron, Hermione, and Gabrielle to an underwater chamber.  Ron had been shocked to find out that he could breathe perfectly underwater, and that Gabrielle was nearly 10 years older than he remembered her, and beautiful beyond belief.  She and Hermione looked stunning in the underwater light, the water in their hair.  They both wore thin white dresses, clinging to their bodies, revealing the curves of their hips, their asses, their breasts.
Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw something.  Potter.  Dark, unruly hair; tall, lanky frame; dreadful broad shoulders; the red and gold tie.  But when Seamus turned around, Draco realized it was definitely not Potter.  Seamus had clearly grown this summer, but was too portly to be mistaken for Potter’s flower boy frame.  How Draco wanted to break him.
“Brilliant!” Harry whispered, as the two of them hurried into Filch’s office, trying to close the door as quietly as possible.  “You look in those drawers, and I’ll look in these ones.”
“Oh, this might be the book! I heard some girls talking about it in the bathroom this morning.” Hermione chimed in.
Draco went to the bar to prepare the glasses, as the rest settled onto the sofas.  He heard Blaise start to brag about his car.
“But what about this was so funny for those girls? This isn’t lewd like Hermione sai-” Harry began as he turned the first page, pausing as the next page held am extremely detailed drawing of a girthy penis entering a wet vagina.  “Oh.”
Just then, the girls’ giggling stopped as everyone heard a loud mew from the floor.  Mrs. Norris had just shown up - Filch couldn’t be far behind.  The girls scrambled to hide the book in one of their bags and scramble, but Filch came around the corner too quickly.  They froze, looking extremely suspicious.
“What, nothing. What do you mean? I just meant the research in the library. I saw her coming back right before you.” Harry took a second look at Ron. “Did something weird happen, man?”
“I’m just getting back from some stuff with Dumbledore. What are you doing? Are you just getting back from researching with Ron in the library?”
Blaise has a new girlfriend, and Pansy is NOT taking it well. But she'll find a way to keep herself busy and make Blaise jealous at the same time.  It's time to find out how well her and an old friend fit together.
The fat lady looked at him through sleepy eyes, half-annoyed, half-confused.  “You tell him that you need your sleep, as do I,” she said, before swinging open lazily.
The girls giggled, clearly not sure what exactly to be doing.  Strawberry Blonde took the glass Draco handed her, and then nuzzled closer to Blaise, while Pixie Cut kept crossing and re-crossing her legs as Draco walked to her couch and sat down.  He could see Blaise trying to look up her skirt - the pervert.
Ron began to stand before doubling back, rushing to cover his lap with his robe.  He was able to stammer out “d-d-did we sleep together?”
“Er, Ron, listen. Can we pretend that none of this happened?  We didn’t sleep next to each other, you didn’t just see my underwear, and I definitely never grabbed your cock.”
As she placed her hand on Ron’s knee to push herself up, she felt a blush start to encompass her whole body.  That wasn’t his knee in her back.  Hermione realized that she had just set her hand on Ron’s morningwood.  Even worse, he was starting to groan.  Hermione leapt back off the sofa, landing on the floor as Ron’s eyes opened.
The year for what? Did Blaise’s mother tell him about Draco’s job this year? That would be just like her-
After a few minutes of rummaging, Ron shouted “aha!”  He held an old, worn Potions book out triumphantly.
On their way down to breakfast, they heard voices in the corridor ahead.  They could see Filch, Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape huddled outside Filch’s office. As they got closer, they tried to eavesdrop while looking disinterested.
Draco groaned louder than he ever had, finishing in Pixie Cut’s mouth, and a little on her face...and her hair.  He couldn’t remember cumming so hard since….ever. Damn, what was Pixie Cut’s trick? If he was being honest, he couldn’t even remember how it felt when he was in her mouth.  How did his mind wander so much in such a short period of time? It really was embarrassingly short - Blaise was still on his couch, his fingers tangling Strawberry Blonde’s hair, lost in complete ecstasy.  Draco gave Pixie Cut a reassuring grin and reached over and grabbed a blanket from the couch, for her to wipe her face off.  He really didn’t mean to get it all over her.
“Well that was weird,” Hermione said. “Snape looked….upset. His face was red.  I guess he’s taking it personally because it’s in a Potions book.”
A crowd of 7th year girls was huddled in the corridor, outside of the Transfigurations classroom.  Their shoulders shook with giggles that they were doing a very poor job of hiding.
When she and Ron finally got into the room, it was set up with one big wooden desk, a bright lamp, and a full tea kettle.  Ron, ever the lazy one, had also requested a fresh set of flannel pajamas, a robe, and a comfy sofa to be set up - he claimed he could research better that way.  Hermione got her bearings straight enough to realize that she was on the sofa, using Ron’s robe as a blanket. Had she slept here all night? Where was Ron? Hermione didn’t see him in the room.  I guess he went back to his room and left me here.
As they got closer, they heard laughing bouncing off the corridor walls. They dove into an empty classroom just as Draco and Blaise turned the corner with two girls. Were those 4th years?  Ugh, those two were incorrigible pigs, Hermione swore. And were they drunk?  She didn’t even want to ask what they had been doing, but she assumed they’d been in the room of requirement.  Where else could they get alcohol in the castle?  Well...they were Slytherins, so she guessed their parents could have just given it to them.  Regardless, she was just glad that the room of requirement seemed to be self-cleaning.  She did not want to run into any of the mess they surely left behind.  She shuddered at the thought.
Harry threw the cloak back over them as they left Filch’s office as quietly as possible.  They were just turning the corner at the end of the corridor when they heard Filch’s voice at the other end of the hall.
On the bed, Ron moaned loud enough to be heard throughout the boy’s dormitory, cumming hard onto his stomach.  Fuck. That was better than any time with those muggle magazines.  Ron lay there for another few minutes, panting hard, before realizing that Harry would be back soon, and he was laying on his bed, fully nude, covered in jizz.
20 year ago, he’d been a brooding 16 year old, angry that Lily wouldn’t see him as more than a friend.  He had retaliated by trying to sleep with every girl in his grade, hoping that Lily would finally see him as the passionate person he was, worthy of being made her lover.  Those four Gryffindor assholes couldn’t have been the only ones who knew how to get laid at this high school.  The only problem was - no one would have him.  Well, that wasn’t completely true.  He slept with a handful of Slytherins and Hufflepuffs, but no one well-known enough to get him on Lily’s radar. Despite his sizable member, he just wasn’t wanted. They said he was too weird.  So he channeled his anger, desperation, and passion into his book.  He chose his 6th year Potions book because he already had it memorized, knew how to make every potion Slughorn had taught him.  It was innocuous enough that he could carry it to the Great Hall or the library without people wondering what he was doing.
As he was helping her clean up and to put herself back together, Blaise made his own climaxing noises. After finishing, he looked at Draco and winked.  Draco could see him mouth “our year, man!” as he began snogging Strawberry Blonde all over again.
Feeling herself blush again, Hermione muttered “uh, yeah. Sure. ...So you were with Dumbledore all night? Did you go someplace?” Her eyes widened. “Did you find a horcrux??”
“What is it Mrs. Norris? You think you heard something? Ick! What is this black, sticky stuff shoved in my keyhole??”
Draco climbed out of Blaise Zambini’s passenger seat and breathed in a deep breath of highland air.  He took off his sunglasses to look around.  He would admit it - it was good to be back. As much as he sometimes hated this place, hated seeing Potter’s stupid face, hated dealing with that Mudblood Granger, and all of the Weasleys (gosh how many were there at Hogwarts this year), it beat having to see his dad right now. He’d become insufferable since The Dark Lord’s return to power.  This summer had felt eternally long at home.
He buried his head in that book. He wrote imagined conversations where she said yes every time. He imagined how Lily looked under her Hogwarts uniform, what it would feel like when they finally connected, all the things he wanted to do with her and to her.  He had been an emotional 16 year old boy, overly controlled by his own hormones. And now his past was coming back to haunt him.  It wasn’t bad enough that he had to look at Potter every day.  Now the whole school was obsessing over a book covered in his own lewd drawings.  Thank god he never put his name on it.
Hermione spends some time alone in her room, reminiscing over her romantic week this summer with Viktor and an unexpected guest who is lingering on Hermione's mind
What on earth, man? It’s Hermione! She’s one of your oldest friends. She cannot turn you on this much. Ron thought, flummoxed beyond belief.  Harry would be back soon, and then they’d have to go to breakfast….with Hermione….and then Potions.  Ron grabbed a clean outfit from his wardrobe so he could be ready to join Harry for breakfast when he got back.
Draco tried to give Blaise a grin in return, tried to show his excitement, but burning through girls just didn’t hold the same appeal that it did last year for some reason.  Malfoy hung around Blaise honestly for the conversation. It was fun to boss around Crabbe and Goyle, but they weren’t necessarily the best to go to when he wanted to have a conversation that was not just one-sided and used more than a few words and grunts.  He learned that in his 1st year, and turned to Blaise and Pansy Parkinson for his more intellectual stimulation.  They were both pureblood enough that Draco’s father didn’t mind having them around, even if their parents weren’t Death Eaters like Crabbe and Goyle’s.
A mysterious old textbook full of lewd drawings gets passed around Hogwarts. Filch confiscates it, but is that enough to keep Harry and Ron from sneaking in to get a look for themselves? And who is the artist behind these drawings, the "Well-Hung Prince?"
“I still don’t see why we can’t try to date girls closer to our age. The 4th years are just so…..fresh. That middle school keeps them so innocent. It feels kind of weird, man.”
It wasn’t until they moved from Hogwarts Middle to Hogwarts High in 4th year, and Blaise realized that he had a penis, that their friendship turned from finding intellectual stimulation to ….other forms of stimulation.  Poor Parkinson. She was so head over heels for Blaise, and he couldn’t even see it while he was burying his head in older girls’ necks and chests and legs.  She still stuck around with Draco and Blaise, but it was different.  Draco went along with it all because what else do you do when you go to a school with so few people, and so many of them are mudbloods or half-breeds? You have to surround yourself with the few purebloods there are, right?
“If we mention it to everyone, it might just make more people want to see it.  Whoever made that book has one perverted sense of-” McGonagall said, before the trio moved out of earshot.
Before them were two large sofas, set before an expansive fireplace.  As planned, the bar in the corner was fully stocked with sweet wines, the kind high school girls loved, Blaise had claimed. Draco had gotten so tired of drinking the syrupy drinks that he barely touched them anymore.  But that didn’t matter. As Blaise had reminded him on the drive today, it typically only took 4th year girls one or two glasses before they were willing to do anything.
