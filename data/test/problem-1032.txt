“We’re supposed to talk and figure our shit out, Potter. Did you not read the letter? Short of that, I suppose we can read and watch movies. Or stand by the windows and look out at the ocean and brood.”
“Indeed,” Draco said. Several days ago, Pansy had surprised him with a Portkey to Aruba, where they would be staying for three nights, starting tomorrow. She said they needed a break from real life, needed to lounge and drink and dance their cares away for a while (and possibly fuck them away, she’d said, to which Draco had replied, “
Draco nodded. Sometimes things that seemed impossible at first wound up being that way – being inevitable.
Draco huffed a laugh. “Lovely to make your acquaintance as well.” Come on, Frankie, he thought desperately. Get up here. Why in Merlin’s name was she taking so long?
“But that’s years ago now,” Draco said, feeling a little alarmed by this news. It had been going on for that long? “I thought this was recent?”
“You know,” said Draco. “When you’re having trouble sleeping, I don’t mind if you come get me. Don’t wake me up if I’m sleeping – Circe knows I need it. But if I’m up, which is most of the time, then, you know. I’m happy to talk.”
, because Draco felt the exact same way regarding Blaise. “So what, since you two broke up, you were going to snuggle with Weasley instead?”
There was a knock on his door, and Draco pulled it open. It was William, who looked strange. His eyes were red and his golden hair was a mess and he was swaying slightly. “Hello, Dragon,” he said, and it was slurred. Draco realized he was drunk and yanked him inside and shut the door. This wouldn’t do.
. God, I want you to fuck me!” Harry moaned, as Malfoy, still at that deep-set spot with his fingers, licked around his rim and then blew on it gently, stimulating all the sensitive nerves there. Harry practically screamed.
When they all stumbled out of the library about an hour later, they were quite a sight, rowdy and noisy and carrying on. Weasley hurried over to them and took Hermione’s hand, looking her over. “What the hell’ve you done to her?” he asked. Hermione was singing a Celestina Warbeck song -- loudly.
She’d put on her boots and had a lantern of her own. They set out towards the gate in the stone wall, nodding to the guards who were keeping watch. They started down the path that wound back and forth across the front of the hill and led down to the marsh, but instead of following it, they jogged off to the right, winding around another trail, hardly visible, that seemed to snake down between hills. It was unmarked and quite steep; Draco could see why he’d never noticed it before.
“Throughout the day,” he said. “Seems to happen a lot when I’m alone. At my place. Or maybe I just pay more attention, then, I dunno.”
Fuck, but he still hated Bob Kerr for taking that picture. He still made a point of not giving Kerr access to anything when he could help it, and there were plenty of times when he could help it, given his proximity to Shacklebolt and Robards and half the members of the Wizengamot. Given his role as Chairman of the Reform Party. He had a working relationship with every other photographer in London – all the freelance blokes, the other photogs from the Prophet, from the Quibbler, from Witch Weekly, From WQ (Wizard Quarterly), from all the local papers. But he never called Bob. That bastard could rot in hell. Draco hoped he never got a good shot of anything ever again.
be over. Harry knew it, the same as he knew he would miss Draco always. The same way he knew it would never be like that with Ari or with anyone else that came along.
“I see that,” Potter said, leaning back down to lick Draco’s cock once, making Draco’s hips jerk up off the bed.
Except for Nott. Daphne’d never talked about him. And now Astoria would never know what they had been like together, or why Daphne’d done what she’d done, or whether it had seemed like it was worth it. She supposed that if Daphne had been willing to risk all that, it must’ve seemed very important. Theo must have kissed her like he meant to drag her soul through her mouth.
“Dragon!” came a cry from the entrance of the barracks, and a moment later, Frankie was leaping onto his pallet and squeezing the breath from his lungs. “You’re awake!”
Draco made efforts to keep the conversation going – very valiant ones – but it soon became clear that Dominic and Harry were not going to become chums anytime soon. Hermione was cool to Dominic, too, which made Harry think it probably wasn’t his fault that he felt this way. Finally, Hermione went off to dance with Luna, but Harry, possibly just to piss Dominic off, stayed.
“Tell him that you know he’s upset, and that you’re sorry. That you understand why he unloaded. If you do that, I think he’ll apologize.”
“And Harry?” Draco asked before he could think better of it. “Why is he here? To help you navigate things? To protect you?”
“Early bedtime, then,” Draco said, clearing the plates with a flick of his wand. “Did you bring something to sleep in?”
“Just…just…” God, Draco didn’t know what he wanted. For this to never stop, for this moment to never end.
Carefully, with words painstakingly chosen over the last several months, Draco explained to the audience that he and Astoria had finalized their divorce, a process that had begun in January. He explained how they loved each other, but their marriage wasn’t meeting either one of their needs because he was gay.
“You’re terrible at darts,” Draco said a few drinks and a few games later. They’d lost every single one so far.
“Sometimes?” Harry said, laughing. To him it was totally obvious that Lucas was crazy about Charlie.
“Well, yeah. As much as we can be. It was, um.” Oh Merlin, this was hard to talk about. “It was because I came out to her. That was why we split up.”
Harry wasn’t laughing, though. It was oddly cute, the thought of Draco running. Draco asked him if he ever exercised. Harry had, on occasion, tried to lift a weight or two – Ron had a set in his room at the Burrow – but he’d never stuck to anything. Last summer, Ginny’d talked him into running with her a little, but truthfully, he’d hated it. “Ran once in a while last summer,” he said.
Only, it seemed that he had surfaced in the wrong place. It was mostly dark outside for one thing, when it should’ve been fully light out by now. And secondly, there were no palm trees, no white sand beaches, no glistening turquoise sea.
He slipped out fast, then, and walked as quickly as his legs would carry him to Chang’s room. He knocked and she came to the door in a clean tunic and trousers, looking freshly washed, unlike the last time he’d seen her, which had been in the dungeon. He told her that they would leave in the morning, and she looked at him with a trembly smile and thanked him, and then reached out and gave him a hug. She was unnaturally thin now, so much thinner than she had been at home. He couldn’t begin to imagine what this had been like for her. “Thank you, Malfoy. Oh my god, thank you.” She stood back, crying now, and put a hand over her mouth, her eyes wide. “I can’t believe we’re finally going home.”
Yeah," he said, nodding. "I'll do that. What does Malfoy do for a living, by the way? I didn’t realize he worked. I thought, you know, sitting in the Manor and ordering the house elves about
Harry straightened him up and he was scrambling and pushing and his face looked terrified, and Harry didn’t know what to do, so he just pulled him tight and rubbed his back. “Shhh,” he said. “Okay. Okay. Whatever you say. I’ll do whatever you say. Okay? I’ll stop. It’s okay, I’ll stop. Everything’s fine.”
Nothing worked, not with anyone, no matter how promising things were at the start. Men, women, it didn’t matter. Nothing stuck, not since he’d come here to Chicago after Shacklebolt’s election.
He’d slammed the Door shut and turned to Kerrick. “When you open a Door to darkness like that, do not step into it,” Kerrick said, his voice calm.
“Have to admit, I was a bit surprised when I heard you were dating a Slytherin, particularly one with a cock.”
In his little flat above his shop, Draco changed into something he’d purchased just for this occasion. He loved clothes -- expensive, luxurious clothes in particular – but due to his own views of himself as well as the expectations that his family had set, he mostly wore traditional, conservative wizarding things. His mother and father might have finally accepted that he was bent, but they would never,
Neville gave Ginny an engagement ring for Christmas. It was both easier and harder to bear than Harry’d expected. Part of him wondered what would’ve happened if he’d done it years ago, before everything went to shit. He spent hours afterward going over this hypothetical. Maybe they’d be living in a lovely cottage by the sea. Maybe they’d have a child by now. Part of him was certain they’d have lived happily ever after.
“The three of us – Blaise and Draco and me – we went through some shit, fifth year. Blaise especially. He got caught up with some older Slytherins and…it was messy. It kind of fucked him up. Draco helped him through all that, and then Blaise was the most vocally supportive of Draco, when he came out to all of us. Theo and Vince were being arseholes about it, but Blaise put a stop to that.”
“Oh, er. Ha.” He was clearly throwing Potter off his game a little, and it felt excellent. “I wasn’t exactly aware that I liked men back then. That came afterward. There was one guy, but…it never would have worked.”
Edwin took a step towards him like he was going to take a swing, and Draco tried not to flinch. Thankfully, Edwin seemed to realize at the last minute that they were in a very public location, and stepped back.
“Mother fucker,” he muttered when he realized what he was doing. He turned back around and tried to shake it off.
Draco had not lost any of his momentum - or his righteous anger - so he picked up right where he left off. “I was
Harry took the envelope and stumbled over to the armchair and opened it up with shaking fingers. Merlin, his body was not taking this well. He was lightheaded and trembling, the letter swimming in and out of focus as he tried to read it.
“Is that your way of telling me I look like shit?” Potter asked, quirking one side of his mouth. His smile didn’t reach his eyes at all.
“You wish,” Draco said, still feeling huffy. “Anyway, what I was saying before when you so rudely interrupted, was that if you trail around after Katie like a beaten dog, she
“Yes, I have joggers,” Malfoy said, tossing the t-shirt on the bed and pulling the joggers on. Harry knew he should turn away, give Malfoy a modicum of privacy, but he didn’t. He couldn’t. He stared, entranced, and Malfoy turned pinker and pinker. “Fuck’s sake, take a picture, why don’t you?”
“I saw Harry yesterday,” Teddy told Draco after he’d opened the last one. “He’s my godfather. That’s not a real father, though, did you know that? It’s different.”
Draco considered this. The Elder Futhark alphabet had an upside-down ‘v’ shape. The Younger Futhark had a letter ‘u’, that was upside-down, but it meant rain and snow, which hardly seemed applicable. “May I see the memory?” Draco asked. He’d like to take a look at the rest of the runes that had been on the door.
And, thirdly, Draco wanted to talk to that fucking arsehole Bob Kerr from the Prophet. Why had Bob been there, in the wee hours of the morning, hiding outside the Leaky, waiting to snap a picture? That had always bothered him. Yes, Potter was sometimes stalked by the media, it was true, but they usually didn’t wait in alleyways outside pubs for hours and hours until he emerged.
“Maybe he’s feeling weird about you having that talk with the Weasley girl,” Pansy said later that day when Harry went to go consult with her. She was painting her nails blood red. “It’s clear you two have…
“You’ve thought about it. You’ve dreamt of it. You’ve fingered yourself thinking of me. You’ve come into your own hand calling out my name.”
“True,” said Pansy. She wrote down Daphne’s name. “I’m putting Lucius and Narcissa on here, too, Draco.”
Potter was in a pair of plaid pajama trousers and a thin, white cotton t-shirt. Draco realized he’d never been in Potter’s room. It looked almost like Draco’s, except the trunk at the foot of Potter’s bed was a different color, and he had an oversized pillow with a Gryffindor lion on it instead of a Slytherin throw. There were some books and a pair of jeans on his bed, but Potter pushed them off onto the floor. “There,” he said, gesturing.
He moved the jewels and put his hand in the indentation. Just as his father reached him, he whispered the words.  “The water of time flows downhill, but I will send it back up the mountain; I will bend it’s path to my will.”
Draco huffed out a surprised laugh, then picked up his book. After a while, Harry felt a warm hand settle on his ankle, slipping underneath the bottom of his trackies.
Draco thought back to the day he and Potter had painted that room a bright (rather gauche, in Draco’s opinion) blue. Draco’d chided Potter for refusing to have Kreacher paint it, and, even more maddeningly, refusing to use magic. No, Potter’d wanted to do it by hand, with rollers and brushes, and so Draco’d agreed to help, whining the entire time. They’d eaten pizza on the floor that evening after they finished, sitting atop the plastic tarps that were spread out to protect the wood, and had slugged down firewhiskey straight from the bottle, probably in an attempt to show off for one another.
do this. He would just have to resist Draco for a little while. Surely he was capable of controlling himself for an hour. And Draco might not even want anything to do with him after the way Harry’d treated him last time they’d been together. So maybe all of that was off the table anyway. Harry didn’t look too closely at the way that thought made him feel, the thought that Draco didn’t even want him anymore.
Harry, of course, took this as a challenge, and dug his fingers into Draco’s sides until he was howling with laughter, and kicking. “Careful!” Harry yelled. “If we’re going to do that again, I need all my bits intact.”
He ignored that because he was not about to engage in this little game with her. “What I don’t understand is
Draco made his way up to the front, trying not to vomit all over his shoes. The first time he’d done this, the hat had hardly touched his head before it shrieked “Slytherin!”. He had no idea what to expect now.
Draco wasn’t sure what was happening. Surely this wasn’t an invitation to dance. Maybe Harry wanted to shake? But that didn’t really make sense. Draco found himself having a miniature panic attack as he stared at Harry’s hand, though he really did need to do
They were having lunch at a restaurant in a muggle hotel. And Draco’d booked a room upstairs, using Pansy’s credit card, just to be safe.
She took him in her arms, and to her amazement, he let her. “We’ll come with you. I can run out and get anything that Harry needs, clothes and whatnot, if he’s staying there. Or at least some tea and something to eat.”
Harry walked towards Draco, standing directly in front of him. Draco felt overwhelming relief at the sight of his face, of him, alive and well. “It’s good to see you,” Harry said, and pulled him into a tight hug.
Draco looked over at him to see if he was taking the piss, but he seemed genuine. “Yes, please,” he said, finally.
“He didn’t,” she said again. “He cares about you, and you care about him. It’ll happen. You ought to relax and just let it. Stop worrying so much.”
When they passed an old barn on the outskirts of town, Harry pressed Charlie against the worn wood siding and kissed him. Charlie laughed against Harry’s mouth. “I’m going to get splinters in my arse,” he said.
The next two days slipped by without incident. Draco had a brief respite from his duties until the night Aunt Bella was supposed to come through the cabinet. This temporary hiatus calmed Draco to the point where he was able to eat a little and sleep a few hours straight without waking in a cold sweat. So he was feeling a slightly better on Thursday morning in the Great Hall when Potter entered and began striding towards the Slytherin table, a determined look on his face. Weasley yanked him back and dragged him over to the Gryffindor table, where a stern-faced Hermione spoke to him.
The door to the Leaky opened, and Harry glanced towards it out of habit, and saw Dean and Seamus coming through, followed by Ron and Neville. Damn it. Of all people, why did it have to be them? It wasn’t that they never came to the Leaky, because obviously they did, but Harry hadn’t seen much of them here since he’d fallen out with them. He’d assumed they’d found somewhere else to frequent.
Harry considered him for a moment more, and something that looked an awful lot like respect flickered in his eyes. "Okay," he said. "Then we should do that."
“But,” Malfoy began, looking confused. His slightly-darkened eyebrows knitted together. It looked really good with his light hair, Harry had to admit. Very striking. “You paid all that money to talk to me?” He shook his head then, and grinned. “I’m so fucking sure. Playing hard to get, are we? Interesting tactic, and very unnecessary, considering this is my job.” He frowned slightly. “I’m not going to sleep with you regardless – or suck your dick. It’s not that kind of place.”
Draco was trembling so hard by the time they came to secret passageway in the dining room that he stumbled on the stairs that led to the dungeon. Dolohov kicked him swiftly in the back, sending him crashing down the last few. He landed hard on his front, his arm taking most of the impact. He cried out as something in his wrist snapped.
Harry decided drinking heavily was appropriate after that. He was practically swimming in gin by the time midnight rolled around and they all shoved out onto the balcony to watch Malfoy’s birthday fireworks, spelled to be invisible to muggles. They went back in for dessert, which was a million different kinds of tiny cupcakes. Harry had a strawberry and cream one that was sinfully good.
Finally, he straightened and took a swig of water from the hose that extended from his backpack. “It’s beautiful,” he said, looking around. “Even if it has way too many hills.”
! Not your Mind Healer! Not your mother! You kept leaning on me and leaning on me and it’s not as though I didn’t have my own fucking problems! I lived through the same war as you did, and I lost people, too. I lost Fred –” Her voice broke here, and she looked quickly away, her red hair flashing as her head moved.
Charlie turned towards Harry. “You need another drink?” he asked, throwing an arm around Harry’s shoulders.
She didn’t know what was wrong with her lately. She was feeling quite nostalgic and melancholy and lonely, which were three things she never usually felt at all. Or tried not to, at least.
Potter nodded, green eyes holding his own for a moment longer before returning to the floor. Draco walked back towards Pans, unable to shake the feeling of wrongness that had buzzed around Potter.
“Shhh, don’t look,” Draco said in his ear. He petted Harry’s hair, and felt Harry start to shake against him.
figured out you’re attracted to men. We’ve stumbled onto this sleeping thing, and I’m sure that makes us feel…grateful, to each other. But I don’t think you really want this.”
“No. She’s quite nice to me, and I enjoy her company, and she’s wonderful with the kids. No, I don’t resent her.”
“I won’t kill you unless you do something to deserve it,” Harry said. He pulled himself to his feet and winced when he touched his fingers to his head again.
“I should bloody well hope not,” said Potter, grinning. “Otherwise, I’d say you had serious mental health issues.”
goodbye. He’d still see Draco, and it would only hurt. And there would be no down the road, because Draco would never give this up, his idea of what it meant to be a ‘good man’, and he would serve his term, and then maybe another, and he would never leave Astoria. He would stay with her, because he thought that’s what a good man was supposed to do.
And then Potter came in, telling Draco to relax, and running his fingers through Draco’s hair, and rubbing his back, and the exhaustion crashed down on him and he slept.
“If we do it quickly like that, everyone will give us shit odds of lasting, Harry. I’m talking months,” said Draco, mouth quirking up on one side.
“Harry, I’m a little bit in love with you. You know that, don’t you? I’m really happy with you, with this. I’d be more than willing to stay, but only if you feel the same.”
Ari came back over to him and took his face in his hands. “You kill me, you know that, Potter? You fucking kill me. I never know what’s going on in this head of yours and you always feel just out of reach. But then you go and say something like that, in that bruised way you have...” He kissed Harry softly, wetly, licking over his mouth. “Damn it. I really wish I didn’t like you so much.” Harry melted towards him, pulling him close. “Yes, we can still be together until I leave,” he murmured against Harry’s mouth. “You dick.”
afraid, I could tell. He was afraid of Harry. And somehow, I don’t know, I started to think of him as a bit of a hero.”
Robbie had come with her for moral support. He was over on the couch with his guitar, trying to put together a song about his stupid boyfriend Ben who thought he was edgy just because he had a lip ring and dyed his hair black. He was a fucking engineering major; he was
Five minutes later, he was rushing into the conference room, only a minute or so late for the campaign meeting. Harry was there already, his head bent close to Hannah Abbott’s as they discussed something quietly. Harry looked up when Draco walked in, offering him a tiny, almost shy smile. Just that little quirk of his mouth had Draco feeling better, suddenly. What harm could possibly come to him when Harry Potter smiled at him like that?
“Got it,” said Tony, standing. “Oh, hey, just a heads’ up…” Draco watched as Tony’s face creased into a frown, his golden-brown brows furrowing. “Security intercepted a cursed package this morning. Addressed to you.”
He could tell William, but that, too, would likely only cause more trouble. And Edwin and William were close. Draco didn’t understand it, Edwin being the arsehole that he was and William being about the most upstanding person Draco had ever met besides Potter. But William liked Edwin; he counted on him. He consulted with him, often. They were friends, and had been since childhood.
They made idle chit-chat as he led her to the Green Room, and Daphne admired the line of him as he walked. Blaise was a graceful man, despite his height and broadness. Draco was tall and broad-shouldered, but otherwise slender. Blaise was more solidly muscled, sturdier. She’d always found him handsome, even back at Hogwarts, but sometimes, on the few occasions that she was alone with him, she found herself thinking that he’d only gotten better with age. Sometimes she envied Daphne for marrying him. She knew their marriage wasn’t perfect, but Blaise loved her sister. Not the way Draco loved her, but romantically. According to Daphne, he was quite an insatiable lover, too. Astoria blushed, chiding herself for thinking that way about her sister’s husband.
to run, at least for extended periods of time, so he sprinted down one side of the track and back, and then thought he was going to pass out because he was breathing so hard. Surely that kind of running was not sustainable for more than ten seconds. He tried to do the same thing, only a little slower, and made it around the entire track once.
.” And then he caught Draco’s mouth with his, kissing him hungrily, messily, with open, soft lips and an eager tongue. “Although I must say, that move got to me. It’s a good one.”
idea what she was talking about. Something to do with tangerines and moving the furniture around in her flat. She appeared to be tripping balls. Felix kept his arm around her, and Harry wondered if they were together. Although he could’ve sworn Felix had been flirting with him just the tiniest bit. He supposed Felix could be like Harry, and like both.
Draco stood in his study, staring at the serum for long moments after Pansy left, trying to work up his nerve. Finally, he tucked the bottles into the pockets of his trousers (he didn’t want to leave them unguarded for a single moment) and went off in search of Astoria.
Draco closed his eyes and groaned, and Harry slid his thumb into Draco’s mouth, and Draco sucked it, and then Harry was fucking him harder, Draco arching up into him, matching his thrusts. “Harry,” He groaned. “
Draco chuckled and then settled onto his back to gaze up into the blue sky. He wanted to think of Harry for a moment, without all the fear and worry intruding, but it was almost impossible – he was so afraid. He forced himself to remember one evening – maybe his favorite, of all those stolen evenings they’d shared – on Harry’s hill.
“Crystal,” Nott said, his eyes narrowing. “You’re a pathetic excuse for a Malfoy, you know that? Is being a goddamned shirt-lifter really all that important to you? Salazar, I’m fucking embarrassed for you. Poor Scorpius, having a poof for a father.”
A girl named Eloise was also a sculptor, like Felix, but apparently, she sculpted mainly cocks and vaginas, and her most recent exhibit was entitled “In The Flesh” and had been featured in a University of London periodical. She was very conservative looking – almost mousy – but she told Harry what she did without batting an eye.
Either way, he needed to apologize the moment they returned to the marsh. He felt horrible for leaving today without talking to Potter first, although he’d hardly been in his right mind this morning.
Then they were out onto another street, and Frankie pulled at Draco’s hand, tugging him to the left, and then into another house, this one empty, and then out onto another alleyway. She looked left and right, panting.
“You made me sound like some sort of monster, for Salazar’s sake!” Theo hissed, and Draco wanted to slap him for showing his vulnerabilities so willingly.
She napped for a bit, then (how she was tired after sleeping all that time, Harry didn’t know), and when she woke up, Harry told her he’d help her move back home. She looked at him like he was mad and said she wasn’t going anywhere. Actually, what she said was, “Fuck if I’m going to let some shithead with a wand chase me out of here.” She felt fine, she said, and wanted to go home (to the townhouse, not to America). Harry was grateful to Shaw for insisting that she stay for another day so they could continue to monitor her, because otherwise he was fairly certain she would have pranced right out then and there.
Anyway, Draco didn’t count that stuff with Pansy. And the only other even semi-sexual encounter Draco had was during the war, when Dolohov propositioned and grabbed at him in an upstairs corridor at the Manor. Thank Merlin, Dolohov had been caught out in time by Draco’s father, so that it never went beyond over-the-clothes groping. But Draco also didn’t count that, because it had been disgusting. And, also, scary.
Edwin didn’t look up at Draco, and Draco hurried quickly to the Badgers, sliding in next to Frankie. He wasn’t hungry at all – he thought maybe he would never be hungry again – but he took some food and poked at it.
“What, am I to pull a Luna now?” Draco asked, his eyes flickering over to where Luna was petting Pansy’s hair.
And Malfoy hadn’t killed Dumbledore. He’d hardly participated at all in any of the horrors that had occurred at Malfoy Manor. He’d mostly stood around, looking pale, from what Harry had seen and heard. Perhaps it had been that his wand hadn’t been suited to tasks of that sort. Or perhaps it had been that the wizard himself hadn’t been suited to those tasks.
The moment their eyes met, Draco was filled with a pang of longing so intense it nearly drove the air from his lungs. He ached to reach out, to touch, to eliminate the space between them. He clutched his wine tightly. “I’m well,” he said. “And you?”
“Suddenly overcome with exhaustion, are you?” Pansy asked, smirking. “You understand nobody believes that after watching that kiss.”
“You could…” Malfoy began, running a hand over the back of his hair. “You could all stay here again. If you wanted. If you’re not comfortable with that, I understand, of course. But if you wanted, I could set you up in your own room. The kids could all stay in Scorpius’s room like last time.”
“Yeah. Well, it was pretty terrible, what you said. It made me forget, for a while, that it was Ron who started it.”
Harry felt his own cock jump in his trousers. “Harry,” Draco said, looking up at him from behind Charlie’s prick, his eyes dark with lust. “I don’t know what the hell you think you’re doing, but you have far too many articles of clothing on for what I have in mind for you.”
“Dean was most of it. He’s really the only guy I’ve ever done much with. I messed around a bit with Neville once at the end of the year. The girl was Parvati.”
“Enough, Bellatrix,” said Lucius tiredly.  “We don’t know whether he was acting of his own accord. We know nothing. It’s entirely possible that Dumbledore forced him. That Potter forced him. Until I find out, I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt.”
“I don’t know, I’m afraid,” Lia said, patting his shoulder. “I hope Harry’s back in time for the celebration, but I don’t know.”
“Oh, he’s not in. Two-week holiday, remember? To Tuscany. Poor man hasn’t taken time off work in two years; he deserves it.”
“The sisters were at a loss. Never before had they encountered such an evil, or something so immune to force.”
Draco’s spells hadn’t worked on the shining women, but perhaps…he pointed his wand at Potter. “Stupefy!” he shouted, and to his great relief, Potter stopped. “Levicorpus!” Potter began to lift, his body rising quickly, just as one of the shining women reached out to him. Draco directed him back over to the beach and set him onto the rocks.
“No, sorry, Scorpius. They’re with their mom this weekend,” Harry replied. Scorpius’s hair, which had been neatly groomed the last time Harry had seen him, was a wreck, some of it matted down with sweat and some of it flying around crazily like dandelion fluff.
Harry moaned and nearly came then, because Merlin, he loved that. He wanted to taste and smell like Malfoy, wanted to be marked by him.
His cell phone dinged and he pulled it out of the pocket of his robes and saw he had a new text from Ari, which got his blood surging in a nice way. They’d kept in touch – just a bit – since he’d met Ari in Tony’s office, and it was fun, texting back and forth. Ari was sharp and energetic, and sexy as hell. Yes, the tall blond thing didn’t hurt, but Ari wasn’t a Draco Malfoy stand-in. No, he
, but Potter said he didn’t care! He only said I owed it to him to talk to Katie. And now they’re getting back together, and it’s all such shit! Sorry.” His mother hated cursing. Which was a problem, because Draco loved it.
And then Harry left, because it felt like it would be easier that way. And the whole thing left him feeling quite empty, and unfulfilled, and he fell asleep in his own bed, thinking of Draco Malfoy and his delicate ears and his beautiful hair and how his face had looked when he had said ‘Now…now I’m this.’
“She saved my life, probably,” Harry said. “At the expense of her sister’s. I wish…I wish she hadn’t done that.”
Sarah snickered. “Probably not conducive to being fucked with my enormous strap-on, either, huh?” she said.
“Yes, we had a meeting to go over some things. He wanted to know more about Nott.” Not entirely a lie, he supposed.
At first, the cells on either side of them were empty. Then they were passing two old men snoring loudly in one, their grubby clothes worn through in places. Then a woman, equally dirty, of indeterminate age, sleeping next to her own filth. And then Draco stopped, frozen, and gazed at one of the cells.
“You ought to try to get along with him,” Potter said, collapsing onto the bed next to him. “You’re just making things worse.”
Charlie and Pansy got on well, which made Ron happy, since most of his family was still on the fence about Pansy. One night, Harry fell asleep on the couch while they were all sitting around talking, and when he woke (just long enough to stumble to bed), he noticed that Charlie and Pansy were still deep in conversation, despite it being two in the morning. Harry asked the next day what they’d been talking about, and Charlie told him it had been about a lot of things.
He stared back at Lia, willing her to understand what he wanted. “Yes, we saw the apples on our way in. And this apple butter is delicious.”
And then Potter was fucking tickling him – and it was quite brutal, the tickling – and Draco was squirming and giggling and trying to make himself into a tiny ball so that Potter couldn’t reach any of the most ticklish parts. “Cease and desist immediately!” he shrieked, turning his head towards Potter’s leg and biting down.
Harry didn’t want to push it; he already felt like he had pushed it plenty, showing up and inviting himself to Malfoy's dance class. “Um, yeah. Meeting someone for drinks.” That was a lie.
Harry flipped him off, laughing. “Ugh, Merlin, fuck off with that shite. Golden Trio is almost as offensive as Boy Who Lived, you wanker.”
Blaise, to his credit, took it with grace, and returned to Draco’s mouth, kissing him slow and deep. “When, then? I need you, Draco. When?”
Draco looked over at him, then kissed his mouth once, twice, and then again, only slower, that time; lingering. “Then what?” he asked.
it. He heard himself almost keening as he sank his blade into flesh, again and again, Harry by his side, the two of them invincible.
Malfoy looked up in surprise, and then down at their joint hands. He squeezed back for a moment before pulling away, and then cleared his throat.
He felt like an idiot as soon as he looked around his empty living room. He could’ve just gone to the bar and waited it out instead of stomping out of the club like a child. It was embarrassing, what he’d done. This whole night had been nothing but an embarrassment.
“Harry,” he said, his mouth kissing softly against Harry’s cheek. “Harry.” He kissed his forehead, his eyelids. “Harry.” It felt like a prayer against Harry’s skin; the way he said it sounded sacred.
His right knee was smarting, too; the wolf had landed especially heavily there. He limped over to Harry and dropped to the ground, looking over him. There was so much blood, on his face, on his shoulder, where there were deep claw marks that ripped through his tunic and his skin, on his chest, where the beast must’ve clawed at him again, and his leg, oh Christ, his leg was a shredded mess of tissue and skin and blood, hardly a leg at all anymore. There was so much fucking blood. “Harry?” he whispered, Nothing.
Ari finally made his way over to Euri and Harry, but Harry found himself distracted. Harry would have assumed Malfoy would be wearing wizarding robes, probably, given that he was the epitome of pureblooded-ness. Or, short of that, Harry would’ve thought he’d be wearing something like what Euri was wearing, something classic and elegant. Not that Malfoy didn’t look elegant, but.
They walked through and faced a towering, dark-wood door. “Throne room’s on the other side,” Berold whispered. He made his way over and put his ear to the door. “Can’t hear anything in there,” he whispered.
Potter slept through lunch and into the afternoon. Draco had some truffles from his mother tucked away, so he ate those and called it a meal. At around two, Weasley came in and stood in the doorway, frozen. “Is that Harry?” he asked.
“It’s okay,” Draco said quietly. “It’s really okay.” He sat still for a moment, then set down his tea on the coffee table, and then scooted closer to Harry. “Come here,” he said, holding an arm up towards Harry.
and there still wasn’t. Maybe it was only Harry, all of it, and there was simply something wrong with him. It would make sense, really. He hadn’t been raised normally. No part of his life had ever been what you’d call conducive to mental health. He’d been trapped in a house with people who despised him until he was eleven. And then he’d had a tyrannical, sadistic madman sharing space in his head for
Not that he cared too much. He was, after all, being snogged mercilessly by Potter. In public, no less.
Harry laughed. Giggled, more like, high-pitched and insane. “Yeah, sounds good,” he said, trying to smile like a normal person, which he was not, so it was difficult.
Theo, Millie, Greg, and Daphne were also in attendance. Draco hadn’t seen much of Greg at all this year. They weren’t taking any of the same electives, but Draco knew there was more to it than that. Greg was having a rough go of it, but he never wanted to talk about anything. Draco thought that maybe Greg blamed him, for what happened to Vince. He wasn’t sure whether that was unfair or not. Maybe not. Draco blamed himself, too, a bit.
Now, though, it was a big cat, sleek and elegant and muscled. A bobcat, shimmery blue, except for the green-gold of its eyes.
Draco tried not to get flustered. He shrugged and looked out at the darkness beyond the fire. “You were a hero. Everyone was obsessed with you. It made me angry that you disliked me, but it made me even angrier when you ignored me. I don’t know. I was a kid. Not everything I did made sense.” It made a lot more sense when you accounted for the ache of attraction that Draco had begun to feel for Potter around the time of the Triwizard Tournament, but he didn’t feel the need to share that part.
“Most definitely, Your Highness,” Draco said, and was pleased to see William’s smile grow, and a laugh fall from his lips. Then it died away just as quicky as it had come.
She nodded. “Shouldn’t be a problem. I'll bring it round to yours.” She tilted her head and looked closely at him. “Do you want me to administer it? I can do the questioning. It might be easier on you both.”
There had been a period of a couple of years when he’d even looked forward to it, almost craved it, when they were trying for Scorpius. The knowledge that they were having sex to create a life, to create something that was part of them both, was strangely intoxicating, and he’d experienced full-fledged desire for her, taking her nearly every night before falling asleep holding her in his arms.
“You look like you need another. I’ll grab you one.” Then Harry heard Malfoy calling the bartender by name and ordering.
“Go,” said Malfoy, his smile stretching broadly over his face.  He gave Harry a shove. “Get the hell out of here, you lunatic. Go get your children.”
“Yes, all right,” he said, realizing that he was fairly well terrified of this man and would probably agree to anything he said.
After work on Friday, Harry and Euri hurried back to Harry’s house. Ron and Hermione were coming over at seven for dinner, so they set about cooking together. Euri was the perfect sous-chef, nimble and quick-fingered and eager to assist.
Harry nodded. “I have to warn you: I have no idea what I’m doing. I’ve never done anything like this.”
Harry jumped back, eyes wide, his panicked expression mirrored on Malfoy’s face. They hastily pulled up their shorts and Harry cast a cleaning spell, and they smoothed their hair and their shirts and then Harry unlocked the door.
Blaise laughed. He had a very deep, compelling laugh. “The way you’ve sold this thing, mate, Potter’s probably expecting a literal orgy.”
attractive, too, based on the way he acted. He flirted with Draco, a bit, touched him on occasion, just little things, like resting a hand on his shoulder. But there was nothing more to it. And Draco doubted there would
Then Draco realized that he’d been left just as breathless, just as full of desire, and that made the short-lived feeling of control slip away just as quickly as it had come. He had no control over this, none. He was a fool if he thought otherwise.
“What are you proposing to do instead?” asked Harry, genuinely curious. Merlin, he’d had no idea things had gotten this bad. How did he not know all of this? He thought about how many times Hermione had tried to talk politics with him and he’d changed the subject, and felt a heavy guilt creeping over him.
ran into Malfoy, towel wrapped around his waist and nothing else, pale skin still glistening from the steam, hair still wet. He smelled really good, Harry couldn't help but notice. He didn't want to notice, but it was positively wafting off of Malfoy's body, this good, clean smell. It was almost minty-ish. “Morning, Potter,” Malfoy said, nodding. “How’d you sleep?”
“Hey, stop it with the pouty face,” Charlie said, poking at Harry’s mouth. “No pouting. I refuse to kiss you while you’re pouting.”
Harry wasn’t always great at conversation – he liked to think he had talents of a more physical nature: throwing hexes, running and cycling, fucking. But Ari liked to talk, and Harry liked to listen to him. He was funny and a little outrageous, had a million friends and a million ridiculous stories. He’d been everywhere, knew everything about everything, and seemed, in general, not to take any of it very seriously. And Harry found himself appreciating that, appreciating the lightness of their conversation.
He closed his eyes and gathered Sen, let it swirl through his body in a pulsating rush. It was a living thing, more alive than anything else. It
“You know what the problem with the Dark Lord was, Malfoy?” Yuri said softly. “He was a bit mad, wasn’t he?”
He imagined that Scorpius hadn’t been there – that was important, obviously, because these things could not take place with a child anywhere in the vicinity – and that Malfoy had unloaded the way he had. And instead of Harry moderating his reply because he hadn’t wanted to say too much in front of Scorpius, he would’ve just let fly, calling Malfoy every name in the book, telling him what a complete fucking arsehole he was, and maybe taking Malfoy’s shirt in his fists.
“Excellent,” William said, picking up his pace a little. They were almost to place where the men were lying in wait.
“You’re not,” William said. “You hated him. Not that I blame you. He was horrible, wasn’t he? In the end.”
On the fifth day, Draco stunned two rabbits and Potter used a knife he kept strapped to his thigh to slit their throats and skin them. He didn’t know quite what he was doing (and Draco had no idea, either), so it was a messy, sickeningly copper-smelling affair, so that Draco almost couldn’t stand the thought of eating them. But then he transfigured some of the ferns into herbs and they cooked them over the fire, and soon, the roasting scent of them made his stomach rumble. They ate them along with their transfigured apples and felt stuffed to the brim. And no one died from eating them, which was nice.
“No, I’m not freaked out,” Scorpius said, angling his chin into the air. “I just don’t want you to fight with my father because then I won’t see Lily and Al again. I’m sorry he was such a jerkface.”
After an eternity (or so it seemed), lunch was over. Scorpius took a short nap when they got home, and Draco locked himself in his study. Feeling like he was about to go mad, he rang Pansy.
They looked at each other for a moment, and then Draco let out a huge yawn. “I’m sleeping right here, I think.”
, in one another’s orbit. And during fourth year, after Pansy, Blaise, and Draco had begun cavorting with some of the older Slytherins, joining in their dorm-room parties and discovering the joys of firewhiskey and spin-the-bottle, Blaise and Draco had become extremely close. Things had happened, especially in fifth year, that Blaise hadn’t told anyone about except for Draco. Blaise had been the first person Draco had come out to, followed closely by Pansy.
Draco was pulling his arm back to take a swing when something else collided with the man’s face. Draco jumped away and suddenly Harry was there, pushing the other man down to the ground and hitting him repeatedly. Hermione and Pansy were standing nearby, mouths shaped like two little O’s, and then Weasley was there too, pushing through the crowd, trying to get to Harry. Unfortunately, a bouncer got there first, and then another bouncer, and Draco was being hauled away, and then in a blink, he found himself standing outside on a curb next Harry, who had a rapidly-swelling eye and a split lip.
He went back to his own bed (he’d have to go there in two hours anyway) and tried to sleep. But then instead of sleeping, he thought of Harry, and his brain was too fucking soupy to stop, and he thought himself into a deep, dark hole of regret and hurt and then there was no way he was going back to sleep ever.
“Did your mum do this with you, then, when you were small?” Harry couldn’t help but ask when he got back to Malfoy.
“Yes, I’m sure he does,” Berold said, his eyes on Draco’s, his expression pointed. He leaned closer. “I’m also sure he’s worried about what this means.”
Potter reached over and flicked Draco’s forehead. “Prat,” he said, and then his cheeks got pink. “Honestly, like, only in the last year or so. I never really thought about it before. Since I like girls and all. But then when I realized, I sort of…well, you know. Looked back and saw that I’d always liked boys, too, only it hadn’t really occurred to me that that’s what it was.”
In the Gryffindor Common Room, nobody looked twice at Harry as he held Draco’s hand, or at the fact that Draco was there in the first place. Draco marveled at this development as they climbed the stairs to the dormitories. Harry’s room was much like it had been the day they’d played chess, except that atop one of the beds, there was a single green pillow with the Slytherin insignia on it. Weasley was sitting on the floor talking to Finnigan, and both boys looked up when Harry and Draco came in. “Hey, Harry,” Weasley said. His eyes narrowed. “Ferret.”
did to Draco,” Harry repeated, laughing. “I fucked him, Pansy. I did exactly what he wanted me to do.” He saw her eyes widen slightly at his bluntness.
One night there was a knock on the door of the little closet of a bedroom that they’d placed him in, and a moment later, Ginny came in with a bottle of firewhiskey.
He sealed his reply in an envelope and tied it to the waiting owl’s leg. He watched it fly away before slipping back under the covers and staring at the ceiling.
. Like, I don't think it ever occurred to him in his life to be a prick the way Malfoy used to be. He didn’t brag or show off. He was just a nice kid.”
“If you are, I rather like it. I don’t think I want you to wake up,” Harry said, and then kissed him again, soft and slow. Draco’s tongue skirted over Harry’s, and Harry felt his toes curl up in his dress shoes.
Blaise. He liked Blaise well enough; Blaise was nothing if not likeable. But Blaise was not quite real, in a way that Draco found hard to pin down. Blaise forever said things and did things he didn’t mean, and if he actually had a true self, Draco was certain he, at least, had never met it. Draco supposed it was possible that there was a real boy somewhere in there under the congenial and pleasant veneer, but he thought it was just as possible that there wasn’t, that if you continued to peel away layer upon layer of Blaise Zabini, you’d end up with nothing at all in the end – just an empty, hollow core.
this would happen. I knew it would turn everything upside down.” Harry took another sip of tea and let it warm his insides, which just now felt cold in Draco’s air conditioning. “I can’t lose
Just in case what, Harry didn’t want to know. “No, that’s alright. Thank you, though. Maybe next week.” Harry knew he likely wouldn’t be here next week, but he had no desire to see Molly tear up.
After Draco'd spoken the magic words – free drinks -- everyone suddenly seemed to agree that clubbing might be okay.
By the time he was pulling on his trousers and buttoning his shirt, he’d lost whatever endorphin rush he’d had after the run, and was feeling like utter shite. He’d see Harry today, though. That would improve his mood.
When he finally finished and made his way to the sitting room, he found Astoria sprawled out on the couch, Blaise fast asleep, leaning against it. Her hand was close to his hair, and she looked peaceful. Draco spread a blanket over her and then threw one over Blaise’s legs. Then he went upstairs to bed.
But Ron was his friend again, and that was something. By the time they apparated to their respective homes (they hadn’t overdone it on the drinks today, so they could apparate), Harry felt loads better than he had that morning. Not carefree, of course, but better.
Harry was certain he had never been around people who were this cool before. Thank god he’d let Draco talk him into wearing the outfit he’d purchased last night, otherwise he’d be wearing Ernie’s jumper again, which, to his mind, was quite nice, but definitely wasn’t right for this crowd.
He wandered aimlessly down muggle streets for a while, shivering, until he finally found himself in a coffee shop. It was nearly empty, containing just two middle-aged women at a table together and one younger man reading a thick textbook at a stool that faced the window.
Six pints and no dinner later, they stumbled back to the Ministry to use the floo, because there would be no apparating that evening. They went together, which was stupid, because you could get smooshed and battered, and then landed in a heap in Harry’s fireplace, laughing.
“Sometimes you find things that are only perverted. Like that book last spring. The red one,” Blaise remarked, snickering.
Draco sat in an armchair nearby. “You know, even though I’m not literally at the Manor, I can help you with this sort of thing. I’d be happy to.”
Harry was out with the Aurors tonight, grabbing pints somewhere (probably the Leaky). He’d told Draco to meet them out later, but Draco was trying to focus on the task at hand. He was going to find a bloke for this threesome if it
But he couldn’t go back out now. Because now his brain and his body were full of Draco, and he needed to get rid of him. He needed a Draco exorcism. He pulled out his cock and leaned against the stall, then closed his eyes and pictured Draco on his knees begging, apologizing. He pictured Draco sucking his cock, pulling off to tell Harry he’d left her, that he was desperate for Harry, would take anything and everything Harry would give him. Harry’d use him, use his perfect mouth, watch his luminous eyes fill with longing and grief, and then he’d cast him off. He’d walk away again, and it would be easy, and it would feel so good.
. “I’m so sorry – for everything. I wish – I wish things were different. I’m so sorry that I can’t – that I –
Then they approached William, who was talking to Lia and Frankie, and prepared to tell them their story.
He was gaunt, wasting. His arms, as he held them out in front of himself, were so thin that they hardly looked like his own, except that he knew they were because of the Dark Mark he saw there when he pulled back the sleeve of his robes.
An elf cranked open the gates and they  walked through, crossing the long bridge to the castle and making their way up the stairs to the Eighth-Year Common Room. Pansy left him where the boys' rooms split off from the girls', and Draco hauled his suitcase into his room, tossing it on the bed.  His room was empty – no Blaise, no Weasley, and, of course, no Finch-Fletchley. He looked into the small mirror on the wall above the sink and smoothed his hair. Then he brushed his teeth, just in case, and then he took a deep breath and made his way to Harry’s room.
On Sunday, they packed up their things and kissed Draco’s mother goodbye and apparated to the gates of Hogwarts. “I had a marvelous time,” Pansy remarked as they waited for one of the house elves to come open the gates. “We ought to live in London after school. Except, oh wait, you and Potter might be married by then and living in the Manor.”
“Oh, well. In that case,” said Harry, scooting closer. He sighed. It felt so nice to be curled up together. To be wanted instead of just want
“Oh, no, not just Ginny!” Harry said. “No, she’s beautiful, obviously. More like…women. In general.”
“Well, you’ve woken me the fuck up,” Draco lied, “so I guess I’m going to find out why you’ve been crying like a little bitch.” Draco pulled on a t-shirt.
He could not bear to think too much about the insanity of it all, really. Because then he might lose his fucking mind altogether.
Draco happened to glance up, finally, and their eyes met. Harry watched him whisper something to the girl and then jump down off of the stage, leaving her to join back up with her friends.
Hermione was grinning when Harry clicked his phone closed. “So you got a cell phone just to talk to Draco Malfoy. And now you talk to him every day? I mean, seriously, Harry, there are hundreds of texts in there. And they’re very friendly. Teasing. A bit…flirty.”
Then he felt Potter's fingertips move up along Draco's skin, warm and hesitant, stopping near his navel. “You made a mess,” Potter said quietly. “Quite a mess.”
“I don’t want to talk about the specifics. But I’ve had this happen before. Once before. The, um. Forgetting.”
Draco started. Fingers? He glanced down at his own, but they were all accounted for. But Pansy…he couldn’t tell, couldn’t see her hands, but she’d gone even whiter at the mention of it.
it. Those moments were burned into his soul, and he couldn’t forget them, no matter how much he needed to in order to move on here, in his real life.
Draco dragged himself the last two or three feet, and without hesitating, jumped into the freezing water.
“Yes,” you say, thinking this is probably the most he’s said to you since Hogwarts, when you were screaming at one another to fuck off and die several times a day. “Yes, please.”
! You have some fucking nerve, saying any of this.” Draco was so angry that his voice was shaking with suppressed rage.
His heart was in his throat as the doors opened. What if Malfoy had Dominic over? Or what if he was asleep?
Suddenly, Harry’s tongue withdrew, and he felt the scrape of teeth over his rim as Harry pulled his cheeks apart as wide as they would go. He cried out. It was almost painful, but not. Instead, it was good. It was so, so good that Draco could hardly stand it. His entire body felt so tight and hot, his skin shivery with want. “I bet you love it,” Harry said, his voice deep and somehow cold, his breath tickling over Draco’s balls. He rolled them around in his hand, his thumb pushing into Draco’s arsehole, fingernail scraping gently on its way out. “I bet you love that you have me here like this. Working for you, coming for you, begging for you. I bet you fucking love it.”
He pushed Malfoy back onto the cushions. Malfoy landed a bit too high up along the couch, but Harry didn’t particularly care, and anyway, it caused his head to fall back over the couch’s arm, which left his throat vulnerable again. Harry could feel Malfoy hard against him through the fine fabric of his expensive trousers as he scraped his teeth along Malfoy’s jaw, the skin there soft and hot. “You’re already hard for me, you fucking slag,” he said as he ran his palm over Malfoy’s cock.
He walked slowly back to his own room, closing the door behind him and leaning against it for a moment. He cast against the door, then, warding it and muffling it so he wouldn’t hear anyone knock (he didn’t want to be up all night, waiting for Harry to rap on his door, to apologize, to take him into his arms, particularly when he was nearly certain it wouldn’t happen), then went to his bed and crawled under the covers without even undressing.
He approached the stone and began to paint the runes. “Ansuz,” he muttered, forming the crooked ‘F’ shape. It was the symbol of Odin, of wisdom. “Nauthiz,” he said, making the slanting cross, which represented need.
Harry had laughed a lot with Draco. It was all coming back to him, the little inside jokes, all the times they’d simply looked at one another and had to cover up an inappropriate giggle with a coughing fit. One of their favorite things was to huddle together during fundraisers (when they’d finished signing everyone in, of course) and crack jokes about every single person there. And Merlin, politics sure brought out the strange ones. Or maybe everyone was just strange in their own way, because they’d done the same thing on the boat after they’d gotten some booze in them and relaxed a bit.
Harry leaned back against a wall and took him in, just letting himself watch. Draco had none of the self-consciousness that most guys had. He was perfectly at home in his body, somehow, and Harry found it marvelous. Draco’s hair was fairly well messed, getting in his eyes so that he had to keep pushing it out of the way. The pale blonde hue was taking on all the colors of the strobe lights, looking pink and light blue and almost silvery in turns. Harry thought it wouldn’t be terrible to just stand here and watch him for the rest of the night. It was sort of nice. Besides, if the leather trousers had looked good when he was just walking around in them, they looked even
“I assure you I am,” Harry said. “It’s not so bad here. No curry or pizza. But otherwise pretty good. There are swords, even.” He gave Draco a weak smile.
Charlie nodded. “Said he was…how did he put it? Said he was chasing you down, a bit, and you finally gave in.”
Draco shivered, looking out over the gory field. He nodded. He could think of nothing worse, but it had to be done.
Harry quickly shook his head. “Not really. I mean, people know we’re together and everything, but it’s not a big deal.”
Harry smiled at that, rather shyly, and Draco pulled him closer. They began to kiss with an almost bruising tenderness, slow and deep and gentle. Draco tugged at Harry’s y-fronts, desperately wanting them gone.
“No, I think you did. And regardless, I deserved your hate and worse. But after the war, I apologized, and you said you forgave me, and we talked, and then we were both in Mysteries and we eventually discovered that we worked well together, and it just sort of…grew from there.”
He apparated to the gates of Malfoy Manor and was prepared to climb over the fucking fence if Malfoy didn’t let him in.
, given how turned on he was all the time thanks to his newfound knowledge of how Potter looked in nothing but his pants.
“Don’t know what he has to do with it,” said Draco, throwing himself back on the bed. “Get my boots.”
“We should’ve called the Knight Bus,” Ron said. He had ended up sitting in the bitch seat in back, and his long legs were all crowded up against the center console.
,” Ari said. “I’m so glad you’re okay, Harry. Fucking hell, I can’t tell you how worried I was.” He kissed Harry gently, his lips warm and dry.
“Go on,” Draco said, waving impatiently at him. “Merlin, Potter, you act like it’s something I haven’t already seen.”
. Got into fights all the time – with words and wands and sometimes fists.  I broke his nose, once. Stomped on it. And I tried to Crucio him in the bathroom, and he sliced me open with some strange spell -”
“I sort of told your Aunt Pansy I would make lunch for everyone, so I think you might be coming to my house.”
It was the second time something like that had happened. Thinking of it while Michael was talking about his trip to Belgium the summer before had Harry so wholly freaked out that he hastily said goodnight to Corner and Lavender and the rest and practically ran out onto the street.
. I’ll apologize and I’ll beg and I’ll give him a really stupendous blowjob, and then he’ll definitely forgive me. We can get past all this, if I just –”
Hermione and Blaise and Pansy and Ron came to visit in August. None of them understood Harry and Charlie and Draco’s arrangement. Harry and Charlie and Draco didn’t really care. It was a nice visit, though, all of them crowded into the little kitchen for meals and curled up together in the living room to watch movies. They took trips to the Sanctuary and to Brasov, and walked almost nightly to the village tavern and got shit-faced and wandered home in the dark. Harry realized he’d been missing the hell out of Ron and Hermione, and he could tell Draco felt the same about Pansy and Blaise. After everyone left, he and Draco both found themselves a bit mopey, but at least they could commiserate together.
He still checked. He owed Michael that much, at least. He leaned forward and didn’t feel any breath against his skin. He felt for a pulse, and the skin felt smooth and cool beneath his fingertips. He had touched Michael’s wrist before, had touched his cheek and his chest and his hips and more. He’d touched skin that had been warm and soft, back when Michael was a living, breathing person. But now, he found nothing where the pulse should be. And his skin was already too chilled.
A hand found his waist, and he turned around at his own pace, unconcerned. The man was handsome. A blonde, though, and he didn’t usually go for blondes. Dark blonde, but still. His face was quite nice, though, his jaw broad and strong, his hooded eyes glimmering under sharp brows. He was built, but not in a gym-rat sort of way. He was even taller than Draco. Overall, quite delectable.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, it is.” He picked up Hermione’s hand, kissing the back of it. “Thank you for being here,” he said.
He raced to the kitchen and got spatulas, and returned just in time to hear Draco say, “Oh, this is that muggle rap artist you used to like, Pans? What’s his name? JFK?”
“That’s – that’s not possible,” Draco said. “I can trace my parents’ families back for generations. I’m French and English. Not…Etherean.”
“I love you two,” Daphne said. “You’re cute together. Shhh, I don’t know if I’m supposed to say that.” She pretended to zip her mouth closed. “I’m a bad sister.” She giggled and Draco tensed. Astoria must have told her. She’d promised not to say anything. But then again, Daphne must know her parents and Draco’s parents wanted them to marry, so maybe that was all she was talking about.
“I think it was probably the nine negronis, Pans,” Harry said, wiping her face off with a wet towel. She cried and said sorry for throwing up and Harry said it was fine, his cats coughed up hairballs all the time and his kids occasionally puked, so he was used to it.
“Good morning. Thank you,” he said, setting a linen napkin on his lap and biting down on a piece of toast that she’d already slathered in butter and blackberry jam for him.
He could almost make out the shape of things based on the intensity of the vibrations. It was like the thermal imaging spell that Aurors sometimes used, though the image was just in his mind, based solely on sensation.
He passed the line and it took a while to slow down. When he spun around, he saw that Harry still hadn’t reached the end, and seemed ready to pass out. His face had a look that Draco knew too well, though – a look of determination. He finally crossed, and put his hands up on his head, walking in circles to catch his breath. The he lifted two of his fingers and saluted Draco with them. “Congratulations, you git,” Harry gasped, huffing and puffing. “You won. But I’m calling for a rematch. Give me a day or two and we’ll race again.”
“Some, perhaps. But each world has it’s own magic. Even here, in March – when our ancestors came through the Door, there was already magic here. It was in Evenwood Forest, and it was in the south, in Molpaedia. Creature Magic and Blood Magic, they called it. But that only exists here, in this world. If you were to take, say, a unicorn horn from Evenwood Forest and bring it home, it would do you no good. You would get no more power from it than you would from a stick.”
“You and Draco should help me and Pansy plan the first event!” said Hermione. “That way it won’t just be the girls who go, which was something we were worried about. The boys will go if you and Malfoy are involved.”
Harry stopped pulling Draco into quiet alcoves after a while. He began to look exhausted, haunted. Draco remembered this from before, from the timeline where he rubbed Harry’s back at night to help him calm down. He knew trouble was brewing. Only this time Draco was not going to run away. He was going to stay and face it.
The woman shook her head, her eyes wide. “No, can’t say that I have. I would’ve remembered, a color like that, so bright. Are you…well, are you a nobleman?”
“Oh,” Potter said. “Well, smoking. Drinking more. Getting upset easily, I guess. Losing my temper. Saying things, like, mean things. Things that I ordinarily wouldn’t say.”
Harry watched as Daphne turned towards him, shoulders relaxing a little. “Daphne, I love you,” Blaise said, his voice deep and soft. “Despite everything, I still love you. You know it’s true. And I know you don’t want to hurt anyone, least of all your own sister. It will kill her if something happens to Draco. You know this. Tell them where he is. Please. You don’t want this on your head. I know you don’t. Think of Scorpius. Think of your own children. We all love Draco, don’t we? He’s family. Tell them where he is, love. Please.”
Potter glanced at him, a curious expression on his face. Not angry for once. He was almost smiling, which made Draco want to kick him in the bollocks. “It’s an amusement park called Pleasure Beach. We’re in Blackpool.”
“I’ll go,” Harry said. “It’d be an adventure, wouldn’t it? I’ve hardly spent time in London at all, not really. I don’t count sneaking around during the war.”
“Blue room. That’s your room.” Harry began dragging him towards the door and down the hall. Draco grabbed him in the stairwell and started kissing him again, and Harry leaned back against the wall and ran his fingers through Draco’s soft hair.
Draco’s eyes fell to Harry’s prick. “I was stopping by to pick up some papers I’d forgotten,” he said, his eyes flickering back up to meet Harry’s. “And here you are, in my office, alone. And you’ve got your prick out. And you’ve…” he looked over his desk. “Put a post-it over Hermione’s face, have you?”
His absolute favorite, though, was the one picture that he had of the two of them looking unquestionably together, in the Fat Friar. They were sweaty and in t-shirts and jeans, Draco behind Harry, his chin on Harry’s shoulder, his arms wrapped around Harry’s waist. He said something in Harry’s ear, and Harry turned slightly, catching Draco’s mouth in a soft kiss, and Draco’s eyes fluttered shut. Hermione had taken it without Harry knowing and given it to him in a stack of photographs, never saying a word about it. It had been taken about a week before the end of everything. Harry wondered whether Draco’d already broken off his engagement with Astoria at that point.
Harry made pizza for dinner, letting each of the kids try flipping the dough up into the air to stretch it, and they ate in the kitchen, sitting atop the counters while the house elves looked on with horrified expressions. Harry wasn’t sure whether they were more upset that Harry had made dinner, or that everyone was sitting on the surface where food went. After supper, when the sky was just beginning to darken, they went back outside to a firepit in the center of one of the hedge mazes and made s’mores and told ghost stories. Pansy told a really horrible one about a man with a club foot that had Lily shrieking and clutching at Harry while Harry laughed and told her it was only a story. Then they piled all the kids up in Scorpius’s room, Al in the bed with Scorpius (they both insisted, and to be fair, it was a king-sized bed) and Lily and James set up on cots. Within minutes they were all asleep, exhausted from the long day, and Pansy and Harry smiled at each other, quickly changed into pajamas, and went downstairs for a glass of wine.
“Thought you’d be moping about in a full-body cast, Malfoy,” Harry snarled under his breath as they began to take out the ingredients listed on the board up front. “Aren’t you supposed to be horrifically injured?”
“Love you, too, darling,” Pansy said, blowing him a kiss as he stalked back out into the hallway and slammed the door behind him.
Draco told himself to forget it. Whatever happened, it wasn’t any of his business. Potter was a grown man, and a really fucking powerful wizard, and could take care of himself.
Instead of walking around and admiring the newest models, he was attending meetings with broom company execs and spending all his free time out in the atrium of the wizarding hotel in Leeds at which the convention was being held, signing things. And he hated this autograph shite more than just about anything.
Aberforth served up rounds of cold lager and warmed-up mugs of whiskey, and Draco settled onto a bench next to Harry and Daphne. Draco couldn’t pay attention to what anybody was saying, he was feeling so nervous. “You okay?” Potter leaned over and whispered.
But his father hadn’t been able to protect him for a long while, now. Lucius had opened the doors of the Manor to that madman and his merry band of psychopaths, and allowed them to wreak havoc inside. He’d left Draco vulnerable in every way, too cowardly to stand up to his master even when it came to his son’s safety and innocence. Draco could forgive his father for many things, but never for that.
“Yes, of course,” Harry said. “Unless…wait. I’m probably going to have to dress up if she goes, aren’t I? Because we’ll probably go somewhere nice.”
Harry’s fingers hooked into the waistband of the jeans and he tugged, very gently, until they were off.
Harry grabbed his hand, then, enveloping it in his own. “No, you tosser,” he said, trying to smile, although it looked wobbly. “We’re not dead.”
Lavender gave him a sympathetic look and patted his shoulder before heading to her desk. Harry rapped on the door to Robards’ office and waited. “Come in,” said the voice on the other side, sounding exasperated.
“Oh, you know. Good. Busy.” She’d taken an assistant coaching position with the Harpies last summer, and he knew it was taking time to get acquainted with a new team and transition from playing to coaching.
At the beginning of Draco’s bizarre eighth year at Hogwarts, he’d been emotionally bruised and battered and more vulnerable than he’d ever been in his entire life. He’d walked around those first few weeks feeling barely alive, like some sort of spectral visitor, separated from everything and everyone by an invisible curtain. Nothing felt real; it hadn’t felt like his life at all. There were nights that he sat there in his bed, wishing that Potter had gone ahead and murdered him in the bathroom, because at least then he wouldn’t have to be here now, feeling this way. Because everything was different; he and everyone he loved had
Draco gave him a look. There had been a time when he was also rather impressed with his house, with his lineage, with himself. That was before he'd learned, quite painfully, how those things didn't matter in the slightest, and that good breeding and money were not the same as goodness. In fact, they often resulted in quite the opposite. “Well, my house is not nearly as impressive as your bloody
Charlie’s nose nuzzled against his sensitive skin. “You’re so sweet, Harry. I never expected you to be so sweet. You’re so good.” He felt Charlie’s hand sweep up over his balls and his cock and his hips jerked up and he cried out.
She stuck out her tongue. “Takes one,” she said, teasing him. “Come on, I know all this is old news to you by now, but you can’t pretend like you wouldn’t be chomping at the bit over it if it wasn’t.”
Could Draco have left school? Something might’ve happened to Blaise, Harry realized, his heart sinking. God, he didn’t love Blaise, but he didn’t want anything bad to happen to him. Draco would be devastated, and Harry would feel like shit, too.
“Oh, it’s wizarding candy,” Draco said. “Same as muggle candy, I expect. I like Chocolate Frogs the best. Don’t usually go for Pumpkin Pasties or Licorice Wands, but that’s a personal preference.”
Big Ham settled them down and launched into the story of Bowen – a real stud of a Marchman who not only had sixteen sons, but seven wives as well. The first six wives despised the seventh because she was the tallest and thus Bowen’s favorite even though she had borne him no boys. They therefore decided to kill her and secretly feed her body to their husband, who somehow spawned a daughter in his stomach from his murdered seventh-wife’s parts.
He was turning on the burner under the pot of water when he suddenly turned it back off. Food could wait, he thought, making a split-second decision and running towards the stairs and climbing them two at a time.
“Celestina Warbeck is a goddess. How dare you, Potter,” he said. “My mother loved this song. She and my father used to –” He shook his head and stood. “Come here, you git.”
He was still alive. Draco was still alive. They were going to change things for the better, make a real difference together.
He power-walked down the street as fast as he could in the opposite direction from the Ministry without giving Harry the chance to say anything else. Faster and faster, until he reached a cross street, and then he turned and walked another block or so before stopping. There was an alleyway on his left. Nobody was around. He ducked in and diapparated.
“Haven’t started the orgy part yet,” Blaise said, winking. “That comes next.” Padma was next to him on an armchair, also transfigured, her head on his shoulder. It was fine. Draco didn’t even care. He’d barely even noticed. Padma who?
Draco nodded, and Potter held out his arm for one final side-along back to the Ministry. Draco didn’t bother pointing out that he knew the way back to the Ministry just fine, thankyouverymuch. He figured Potter was liable to pull his arm right out of its socket if Draco didn’t give it willingly.
Narcissa had finally left that bastard Lucius after it was revealed that he’d been financing some of the shadier dealings of the New Magic Party. She had moved to a lovely country house not far from the Manor, and Draco and Astoria were seeing much more of her.
“I surrender,” Potter said, his hands going up. Draco could feel the words rumbling against his chest as Potter’s chest moved. He could feel the air the words made, too, soft against his cheek. He realized there was a lot of skin touching skin, all of it hot and sticky with sweat. He had Potter’s sweat on his skin. All over him. The thought made his stomach dip.
Draco was having a phenomenal weekend, and it was only Saturday morning. He and Harry just finished their run, which had led them through a greenspace he’d never seen before. There had been a soaring, white stone church there surrounded by gardens in which the trees were just beginning to bud. There was an old graveyard, a pond, and ducks and other birds dithering about. It had been dead quiet, except for the birds; it was so early on a Saturday, and utterly deserted. It felt like he and Harry were the only people in the whole world as they sped over its meandering pathways. For the first time, they didn’t race, only looked around as they ran, stopping on occasion to point out something to the other.
Suddenly, there was a sharp pinch on his arse. “Ow!” he cried, turning to see Malfoy grinning wickedly at him.
It sat between them rather heavily. They’d gotten very used to one another over the last two months, and Harry knew he’d feel Charlie’s absence like a phantom limb when he left.
Potter hurried over to help hold people up, and so of course Draco had to as well, lest Potter criticize him for it later. Soon, the room was nearly cleared, and the last of them, the soldiers and the younger men, were being pulled up and out. Draco was yanked out by two soldiers and when they deposited him on the grass, he found himself standing perfectly still, blinking.
And even here, as topsy-turvy as this place was, it wasn’t as though Potter had declared his love for Draco. He hated Draco less, surely. He liked him, even. But there was no reason for Draco to think it was anything more. He was doing that thing where you projected your own feelings onto someone. He felt such intense desire for Potter that he was convincing himself that Potter felt the same.
He blinked around and took in his surroundings. He was in his dungeon dorm room, all alone. It was day; he could see the greenish, watery sunshine filtering in through the window. Without meaning to, he wandered over to the window and looked out, watching the familiar sway of water reeds. Time passed; he wasn’t sure how much, but it was hard to care. He felt so very, very tired.
He wanted to collapse in a heap, but seeing that stubborn bastard Potter still doggedly walking with the sword was enough to dissuade him from doing so. Instead, he took the cue from a few of the soldiers out in the fields and began to jog back and forth. He needed to be stronger, but he also needed to get himself used to exertion. He needed to be in better shape. He wanted to punch himself for not having some sort of fitness routine in place for the last couple of years. He ought to have been working on this for ages already.
Kerrick had told him that the only other person with the ability to Pin lived in Evenwood Forest. Could it possibly be the batty girl who’d fed them and warned them about the karkadan?
Harry marveled over how it wasn’t strange at all, being here in New York City on a date with Draco Malfoy. It seemed right and even inevitable, and Harry thought that he could do this – talk to Draco, look at him, be with him – forever, and never get sick of it.
And while he was at it, maybe he’d get something new to wear tonight, something scandalous and decadent, and maybe he could talk Pansy into coming out with him, and they’d lose themselves in the thump of bass and the oblivion of strong drinks and in pointless sex and glorious anonymity. Pans was always up for that sort of night; it was one of the many things Draco loved about her.
Potter shrugged. “I dunno. Let’s analyze it later. Right now Ron’s coming over and we’re going to get pissed.”
The flirting between Charlie and Draco got worse after that (or better, depending on how you looked at it). Draco still flirted with Harry, obviously, and still took advantage of their nights together, and still looked at him in a way that made Harry melt a little, but now he looked at Charlie a bit like that, too. And Charlie was the same with Harry. He still loved Harry and acted like it every day, but now he was doing some of those little considerate things for Draco, too: fixing him tea in the morning, rubbing his shoulders at night if Draco complained of a backache, and buying his favorite biscuits from the shop. Draco and Charlie were closer, and spent time together, on walks or lounging in the living room watching movies, or sometimes running into the village together for groceries.
Harry took a sip of his pint. “Those last two stools at the bar, over there,” he said instead of answering the question. “You were on the one on the right.”
Draco found himself shaking his head again, taking another step back and another. Potter’s eyes seemed too green, too bright, a blinding Avada Kedavra instead of soft new leaves.
“What the fuck are you doing?” she hissed at him when they were at her apartment. She lived in a high rise in River North that was open-concept, with a fantastic rooftop patio. They went up to the roof for a bit before coming back in to curl up on couches and get snacks. It was going on four in the morning. Harry felt like he might never sleep, his body was so abuzz with Draco’s continued presence. Just now, Draco was lounging on the sofa, talking to Suraj, laughing and being gorgeous, still wearing Harry’s black t-shirt. Harry’d put on a t-shirt of Sarah’s, a bright pink one that said ‘Pussy Power’. Sarah had picked it out for him.
Scorpius nodded sagely. “Like when my friend Archie told me I was pants at catching the snitch. I still haven’t forgiven him, and that was way back before Christmas.”
On Sunday, he was terribly hung over, but he had to visit his mother. It was what he did on Sundays, and if he skipped out on her for any reason besides death or imprisonment, she’d probably stop speaking to him for a month, or worse, make snide comments about it for the next several years. So, he poured himself into one of his new sets of dress robes and flooed over to the Manor with his head pounding (really, hangover potion could only do so much).
They stared at the hole for a moment until Hermione reached them, and then Draco sprang back to life, running onto the ice, towards the hole. He slipped and fell onto his knees, and noticed Ron was still with him.
Finally, they were done, and opened the floor to questions. Hannah Abbott’s hand shot up. “How will students be organized housing-wise?”
A small, careful smile. “I had thought about that, but…are you sure? It’s okay if you’re not sure about it. I would understand.”
“I did.” He let himself be kissed for another moment, the gentle pressure of Harry’s lips on his making him feel a swell of something warm and lovely in his chest, like sunshine breaking through the clouds. “You’re rather brilliant at it, Potter. But don’t get all puffed up about it just yet. It could’ve been beginner’s luck.”
anything. It wasn't like with Harry, where he had to fight for every little thing, where he was forced to constantly make himself vulnerable. Being with Charlie would be a simple matter of letting go.
And the trees, sweet Merlin. The trees stretched up into the sky so far that you couldn’t see their tops. They were taller than anything that had ever graced the face of the earth in human memory. Their trunks were almost comically wide. It would take half of the Department of Mysteries’ employees to circle around it.
Draco gave Harry presents as soon as he got home from work: a cashmere sweater and a new watch with a supple leather band that was charmed to tell him where Draco was. Not because Harry was overly possessive or anything, but just because it would be helpful and convenient, to know. Harry loved it, and even got a little emotional over it. “I like how it makes me feel,” he said, his voice rough as he put it on. “Like...like this is really…I dunno. Like we’re – like our relationship – is really established, or whatever.”
Potter took it and frowned. “I was working on some spells while you were asleep. I can’t do anything. Nothing works.”
Draco wore his emotions more obviously. He was cool with Charlie, no matter how friendly Charlie tried to be. When it was Harry’s week to be with Draco, Draco had no qualms about being physically demonstrative in front of Charlie, although Harry nipped that in the bud pretty quickly. Draco was insatiable in the bedroom, which was amazing, of course, but Harry worried that it stemmed from his insecurities rather than desire. When it was Harry’s week with Charlie, Draco grew sulky and moody, although he never actually said anything about it. Instead, he was testy about everything else, from the mud they tracked into the house to the fact that Harry left his socks on the floor. He nearly had an aneurism the time Harry accidentally forgot to take Draco’s roast out of the oven and it was slightly overdone. Harry could hardly even tell, but Draco screamed about it and threw all his food into the garbage.
When he arrived home that night at ten, everyone was asleep. He rarely saw Astoria in the waking hours unless she was campaigning with him. He would have thought Harry ripping their relationship to shreds would have fixed things with Astoria, but it hadn’t. They were still distant with one another, at odds in a way they hadn’t ever been until Draco went to see Harry in New York. Part of him missed her, missed their closeness and the way he could always confide in her. The way she soothed him.
, before he opened his eyes, that he’d done it. The Door was there, its handle gold instead of silver, the runic shapes shimmering darkly across its surface. He approached it slowly, warily, and gathered his nerve. He reached out and turned the knob and opened it.
tunnel, this one with stacked-stone walls. Berold looked one way and then the other, and then closed his eyes, making some sort of determination in his head. “This way,” he said finally, setting off towards the right at a brisk pace.
The following Wednesday after lunch, Draco was once again outside for Care of Magical Creatures. As it had been the week before, the lesson was tense. Hagrid lectured instead of using his usual hands-on, practical methods of teaching, and it was obvious that he hated it. Everyone was quiet and uncertain as they listened to Hagrid mumble on about Flobberworms, often losing his train of thought or speaking so quickly that they couldn’t understand him.
He opened it up and looked at the unfamiliar owl. His heart lightened, because it might be Malfoy, writing to apologize. Maybe he’d been having an especially bad day or something. Maybe he hadn’t meant to yell at Harry. Or maybe he’d just been so caught off guard that he’d reacted without thinking.
“You’re an arsehole, Draco,” Harry said, laughing. He helped Draco into his pajama trousers, and then pulled off Draco’s t-shirt. Draco decided to be very helpful, too, and put his arms up over his head as Harry pulled.
“Don’t recall an invitation being extended to you, actually,” Malfoy said, tilting his chin up and sweeping past them and back into the townhouse.
, and once Draco broke off his engagement to Astoria, who would certainly understand – for fuck’s sake, they’d only been engaged for a few days – this would be happening for real. Harry would be his, and he would be Harry’s, and yes, his parents were going to lose their fucking minds and probably disown him, but fuck them.
Not a loss forever, he reminded himself. It was an easy enough trip for him at this point. It was goodbye for now, not goodbye once and for all. And yet, even as he told himself that, he knew it would never be quite the same. He would never be at home here again. He would be a visitor. An outsider.
“Yeah,” Sarah said. “He’s not in a great place at the moment. I don’t know whether to feel sorry for him or kick him in the balls.”
“Not just this club. He owns a few strip clubs in the city and some regular nightclubs, too. And a steakhouse and a seafood restaurant. He’s very influential. Golfs with the Mayor, has all the borough councils in his pocket, you know.”
When Malfoy hit his arse with a cleansing spell, Harry felt his eyes widen, and then Malfoy was rolling him onto his stomach and pushing his legs up underneath him. Then, to his great surprise, he heard Malfoy cast an
, Harry was angry. He was so angry at everything, at everyone. He was so angry he almost didn’t even know where to aim it, could only
“Who’s in the palace, then? If William’s in Glum’s Marsh?” Draco asked Frankie and Berold as they saw it looming in the distance.
Harry was alone in his townhouse, pacing the floors. Sarah was out on a date with someone she’d met online, which worked out well for later, when Draco came over, but for now, Harry was wishing she was here to talk, to offer him a distraction.
He looked like words were beyond him as he nodded. Draco kissed him on the mouth once more before trailing kisses down over his stubble, his throat, his chest, his stomach, lower. Harry’s fingers were in his hair, then, curses falling from his lips as Draco’s mouth descended over his length.
Draco had been wondering about this himself. “I honestly don’t know. It doesn’t make sense. By all accounts, anything that impacts you ought to impact me.”
Sure enough, a little while later, they turned onto a different tunnel and began to ascend once more, and then they reached a ladder with a door at the ceiling. They moved silently up the ladder, one by one, only to come out into yet
“You’d have to have your Time-Turner with you always. And you’d have to act fast, no second-guessing yourself. If something feels too dangerous, you would need to go back.”
“I was hoping you did,” he said, squeezing Draco closer to him. He let out a low moan into Draco’s hair. “I really was.”
He showered fast, and thank Merlin he didn’t run into Malfoy, and then he was hurrying to the girls’ corridor, to Pansy and Hermione’s room.
Draco had seen plenty of Theo in their seventh year, and most of the memories were ones he tried not to ever think about, memories involving the Dark Lord and a cadre of terrifying Death Eaters, so yes, he knew that. “Right,” he said. “I remember.”
Draco had learned by then that Kerrick said what he meant to say, and any attempts to squeeze more information out of him would be futile. Draco nodded and tried again.
Draco cast again, and the karkadan raised up on its hind legs and slammed itself through, and that one disappeared, too.
“Would you like to grab lunch with Hermione and me today?” He didn’t even know if Hermione was free, though she probably was. He hoped she was, or he’d feel like quite an idiot.
Harry turned pink again and tugged off Draco’s leather trousers, averting his eyes a bit, which seemed silly, and handed Draco the pajama bottoms.
“Mother,” Draco managed, resisting the urge to throw his arms around her. His voice was high and strange; a child’s voice. As she approached, Draco realized that she was quite a bit taller than he was, something that hadn’t been true for years.
“I have no idea what to wear,” Harry said, running his hand through his hair and feeling sheepish. Stormy, who was batting around one of his ties, meowed.
“But I don’t want to spend my summer with the bloody Weasleys!” Draco cried, for what felt like the thousandth time. “Surely you can understand that, Professor.”
Potter slipped his fingers under his glasses and rubbed at his eyes. “No, that’s not – Draco, this is crazy. Why would we do this? It won’t ever work, obviously. There’s too much – and I – and we –” he gestured wildly, as though it were the same thing as speaking actual words. “We just can’t.”
Draco must've drifted off, but not into a very deep sleep, because something, some sound, woke him soon after.
“Your cock’s as gorgeous as the rest of you,” the man whispered, his breath hot on Draco’s neck as he wrapped a hand around the base of said cock. “Fucking hell.”
They marched back to his study in silence, and it did not feel at all like they were man and wife. It felt like they were enemy combatants, or perhaps Auror and accused.
Draco shook his head. No, he’d been the only one of their class stupid enough to take the Dark Mark. Merlin, he’d been far too eager to prove himself. It’d been utterly pathetic. He generally tried not to think of those days, because it made him so angry with himself that he could hardly bear it.
“First,” Potter said, moving once more towards Draco’s neck. He was sucking and biting, almost violent, and Draco was sure he was leaving marks, though he didn’t care because it felt so fucking amazing. “I want you to suck my cock.”
“Find out. Owl her. If it’s okay with her, I’ll go with you. Help you look through some of the muggle bookstores.”
Draco smiled at it. “Look at you. So skinny. Already stupidly handsome, though.” He looked over at Harry. “Sometimes I can’t really get myself to believe you’re here.”
“Because I want to help,” he said simply. “Because I don’t want you in the Manor alone. Because you lost your father today. Because your mother saved me –”
“Didn’t know you’d become such a staunch feminist since I’d been away, Pans.” Harry’s head whipped around at the sound of Draco’s voice. He was sitting on the floor in front of an armchair that Astoria Greengrass was perched on, and she was playing with his hair, braiding it.
From the moment Draco stepped foot in the Great Hall, Potter’s eyes were on him, tracking him. He imagined that this was the face that criminals saw when they met Auror Potter: confident, assessing, focused. It seemed to say, “I will get you, one way or another. I may not know when or how, but I will get you.” It was, frankly, chilling.
“Oh, god, Draco,” Harry said, clutching at him, wanting to fuck up into him hard, and trying to resist. “Goddamn. How are you so gorgeous, still? It’s not fair. It’s not fair that you’re so perfect, all of you, your mouth, your body, your fucking beautiful cock.
“Excellent. We’re going to announce right up front and then take some questions, all pre-approved. Harry’s fielding a couple questions as well; he’s ready for them.”
Dorthea cleared her throat. “Harry says – unequivocally – that he is happy and in love, and Draco says that he is as well.”
The Draco Malfoy Harry knew was fiery and passionate and stubborn and determined. He wasn’t flat. He wasn’t weary in that way that seemed permanent. He never let the world beat him down. How must he feel, to have looked that way, to have spoken that way?
It was a warm night, muggy and cloying, and they were both out of breath and sweating by the time they finished. The heat had been getting more brutal as the days moved closer to the apex of summer. The Marchmen, Frankie had informed him, held the solstice to be sacred, and would be celebrating the holiday, which they called Gimheif. There would be a massive bonfire at Glum's Marsh, replete with animal sacrifices and everything, supposedly. Frankie assured Draco that he didn’t have to watch that part, that he could show up afterwards for the drinking and the debauchery, which sounded intriguing.
“What? What is it? You can tell me.” She looked open and sincere, the sunlight playing over her hair, picking up the golden strands that were woven through the brown.
Draco looked at him with a very fake smile. “It’s not…oh, it’s not a big deal, Harry,” he said. “We’re not going to cast an Imperius or anything.”
Harry thought it was very possible that Malfoy was lying about this, but he decided to go along with it. “So you did?”
“I think for some people, it’s not even about that. About wanting. I think it’s about power. Control. Domination. Has nothing to do with feelings in the slightest.”
“Good. Now, tell me about the conclusions you’ve drawn regarding these adventures. What lessons do you think you’ve learned?”
and so I wasn’t telling him to back off like I should’ve, and I’m sorry about that but I honestly just felt so wretched…” he broke off and turned away, his eyes full of tears.
This time, Draco heard the noise beyond the door. Nott’s head whirled towards it. “Yuri, that moron,” he snarled, and then the door was bursting open, and Draco looked on in amazement and horror as Harry came charging through, dirty and splattered with blood, his wand held aloft as he pointed it at Theo.
William let the Molpaedian king go, on the condition that he enter into an agreement of peace that did not hinge on William marrying Lysandra. He assented, and then took his ships southward. They didn’t hear from him again.
Harry considered this. Seamus would probably think it was fucking hilarious, and he’d likely have no problem going along with it.
Draco was a caring father, and put so much energy and thought and love into raising Scorpius, and Harry had to admit that he was very,
“I already told you that I have no idea,” Harry said, grinning. “I just thought this might feel good.” Then he lowered himself onto Draco so that their skin was touching everywhere. His skin was hot, his eyes hotter, as he began to kiss Draco again, grinding a bit against him.
Harry muttered something, and then suddenly the hand that was teasing his balls looked shiny, and Draco realized that he had just managed a wandless lubrication spell. Draco’s cock jumped under his fingers, apparently very interested in this development. As if Harry wasn’t driving Draco mad enough; now he was doing wandless sex magic?
“I rather like seeing you,” said Harry, feeling lost in Draco’s gray eyes. He was bracing himself for a kiss. Because surely they’d kiss? But then Draco said goodnight and was hurrying into his house.
“No, she’s not.” Draco took another sip of his drink, willing the caffeine to jangle some of his brain cells, wake them up further, so that he could make some sense of this mess. “Then
Harry unbuttoned Draco’s trousers and slipped them down just a bit, just to right below his bollocks, and then he did the same thing to himself, and Draco watched, mesmerized, as he slid his hand over both of their cocks, pulled them close together, wanking them in tandem.
Linda slept that night in the other bedroom. Harry was sleeping in Draco’s room, which had quickly become his room, too, that last time.
“Oh, Dragon. I don’t know. They are acting very much like horses, you must admit." Some had wandered over to the stables and were munching the hay that was stored along the edge of the building, and were flicking their tales back and forth to ward off gnats and flies.
“You could do a sticking charm, probably,” Harry said. “Attach some of those metal pieces right to your feet.”
Potter laughed. “It’ll be grand. Come on.” And with that, he took Draco’s arm and pulled him in the direction of the dorms.
“It’s cool,” he said, giving Draco a rueful smile. “I swear. I know how complicated this stuff can get. My ex and I – “ he stopped, and shook his head. “Whatever. What I’m trying to say is that I get it. Not a big deal.”
by him in the bathroom. Had acted like Draco was some fucking infection, tainting his beloved Weasleys. Why would Draco want that? Why would he want someone who looked at him that way?
He handed some to Potter who took them and said thanks before stashing them into the pockets of his robes. “God, it's so annoying not to be able to use magic,” he said, crossly. “I can’t even tell you.”
Draco led him up to the seventh floor. He walked past the spot three times, waiting for a door to appear. When it did, he was shocked to find a small room with two armchairs facing each other on the other side instead of the vast room with the cabinet. “Oh,” he said. He’d intended to show Potter what he’d been doing.
“Now where have you been, little dragon?” Edwin asked, stepping closer. He sniffed at Draco’s skin, and Draco took another step back, finding himself backed up against the wall of one of the barracks, as Edwin’s eyes widened. “By the moons, you’ve been perfuming yourself like a whore.” He invaded Draco's space even further, his nose coming horribly close to Draco's neck.
Yes, he’d do that today. Fresh bottles of hangover potion, so that when he went out to a club tonight and got shit-faced, he’d have something to take tomorrow morning that wouldn’t leave his stomach churning like this.
Draco was good with her, though, guiding her carefully to a chair and being silly for a bit to make her laugh and loosen up. He ripped off his trousers in front of her, and she actually squealed – a first; Hermione was no squealer – and started giggling as he shook his arse at her.
As soon as he left the store, he pulled out Malfoy’s number, which he’d brought in his pocket, although he hadn’t really needed to since he’d pretty much memorized it. He entered it into his phone, along with Draco’s name.
Their legs tangled together, and Draco’s hand stroked along Harry’s arm as his tongue curled softly into Harry’s mouth. Harry sighed and turned his head a bit, deepening the kiss, and soon Draco was pressing his hips to Harry’s, and Harry was tilting his head back while Draco kissed over his jaw, “I missed you,” Draco said. “I missed you so much.”
“What, you’re going to finger me to death? What a way to go,” Draco said around a moan as Potter curled his fingers up so they brushed up against the wickedly sensitive spot there. “Oh, fuck.”
“Yes?” Harry whirled around and looked at him with an expectant, slightly dazed expression and for a fluttery moment, Draco wondered how he’d respond to being snogged right then and there.
Potter burst out laughing when he saw it. “There’s no way I’m wearing that. There’s no way it would even
He looked up at Pansy and then two of them started laughing helplessly. “Sweet Salazar, maybe this is good for them,” Pansy said, when she’d collected herself.
It shouldn’t have been difficult. He’d done it before, and it had been easy as breathing. But every time he tried to recapture those feelings, they seemed to have belonged to someone else entirely.  A different Harry.
Harry felt his fingers curling into a fist, and his rage felt like a separate, living entity, throbbing through his body so violently it almost hurt. “You want me to hit you? I can,” he growled.
“Draco,” she said softly, leaning in just a bit, her wide brown eyes fixed on his. “You know that when this all comes crashing down, I’ll try to protect you in any way I can.”
“Harry –” she said, and he looked back up at her. “You don’t owe me a life debt or whatever Draco said. I did the only decent thing I could do. We made you come back to run alongside Draco, and put you in harm’s way. And I really didn’t think he would hurt me.” She gulped. “I was wrong, obviously.”
They’d either die here, or they’d eventually go back home, and Draco knew that whatever their relationship was here – friendship, possibly a bit of mutual attraction – it would disappear the moment they crossed back into their own world. This place was a lie. It wasn’t real, not at all.
Potter groaned. “Ugh, I don’t even fucking know. But we better talk about it later,” he nodded towards Weasley, who was looking at him curiously.
“Yes, well, you’d better make haste,” Mrs. Malfoy said. She turned to Harry, and Harry clutched the little blanket closer. He hoped to god he’d not missed any of the copious amounts of spunk that had been flung around the room the night before. “I apologize for my son’s lack of hospitality, Harry. I do hope you weren’t too uncomfortable.”
It was Antonin Dolohov’s old wand. Draco knew the feel of it against his skin. And no, it wasn’t the first time it had been pressed against him. Draco wondered, in some corner of his mind, what the fuck had happened to the Dolohovs as children to make them this way, the sick bastards.
He considered, briefly, trying again. There must be a way, he thought, to do it right. If only he could find the right time, the right moment, the right words…
to thwart them. Then there was the possibility that he’d lose his mind the way he’d done after yesterday’s nap and try to make advances of his own.
Lia could, though, apparently. “Augh!” she cried, her blade whipping through the air lightning-fast. “Take this, beast!”
They played in silence for a while, and the Weaslette wasn’t bad, though Draco figured out pretty quickly what she was trying to do. He considered letting her win, but thought she’d possibly chop off his balls if she noticed.
He had come in his glory, glittering gold on his fingers and wrists and around his neck, in the form of a thick golden torque. He was in a spotless white toga to his knees, like the soldiers, although his red cloak was long, falling to the floor and trailing behind him. Despite all his gold decoration, he wore only a crown of fresh, bright green leaves on his head, set atop soft-looking black curls. His skin was golden-amber in color, gleaming, and his eyes were wide-set and dark as midnight. His powerful arms and legs were bare, and there were gold cuffs on his considerable biceps.
“Right, I forgot. You’ve shagged a million people,” Potter said uncomfortably, scratching at his neck.
Draco tried not to look as shocked as he felt. “No. I assure you, he’s never said anything of the sort to me.” And that was true as well. Harry might’ve fucked him, but he’d never, so far as Draco remembered, said anything about liking him. “In fact, he’s made it clear that he can’t very well stomach me.”
“I know, okay!” Draco cried. “I know. We hadn’t done it in a really long time, not for years, not until that night…”
“That’s Molpaedia. The kingdom to the south. We were at war with them for a decade. That’s why Queen Otrea came here in the first place: she was given to the old king’s son as part of a treaty.”
Draco was muttering to himself as he got ready. He didn’t prepare remarks for debates, not exactly, but he did have certain points he wanted to make, certain phrases he wanted to be sure to include, so he was going over those as he styled and spelled his hair, as he decided which tie to wear. His suit was new, very fine but not flashy, in a navy blue lightweight wool. He paced around the room, still reviewing his important talking points, and then Astoria knocked on the door to tell him that Tony was here. He was heading over early with Tony to scope out the acoustics and lighting and to say hello to the moderators, most of whom he already knew.
“The language was a bitch. I knew a little bit of Romanian beforehand, but not nearly enough. And it was hard, yeah, being away from home. But then I met friends there and fell into a routine, and soon enough, I found that I loved it. And I love my work, too, if you can’t tell.”
Draco felt a stabbing sensation in his chest. He knew Teddy, of course. His Aunt Andromeda was raising Teddy, and ever since his mother had reunited with her, Teddy was a regular visitor at the Manor. He’d never thought about the fact that Potter also had a relationship with Teddy. And he’d
Harry felt his stomach dip at the words, aching in anticipation, and then Malfoy was lifting up and positioning himself above Harry. Harry could hardly breathe as he felt Malfoy take him in hand and line him up against his hole. Malfoy looked at Harry as he very deliberately lowered himself onto Harry’s cock, and when Harry’s eyes closed at the sensation ripping through him, Malfoy grabbed his chin. “Look at me,” he said, his voice low and soft. ”I don’t want you to forget, even for a moment, who it is making you feel this way.”
Draco nodded. He may have chosen Harry – because how could he not? – but that didn’t mean he admired William any less. He understood why he inspired such loyalty. If anything, the way he’d handled Draco’s rejection had only cemented Draco’s respect for him. “He’s a good man.”
Where was he going? Home, alone, to the bombed-out carcass of the Manor? To Pansy’s flat? To a hotel?
,” he said. “Goddamnit, Malfoy. I can’t –” he pulled away. “I’m not going to last very long,” he said, looking down.
“Yeah, okay,” said Potter, picking up on Draco’s yawn and letting out an enormous one himself. “Can I still, you know…can we still, like…”
Malfoy was, after all, the boy who had stomped on his nose. That bore thinking about. But then again, Malfoy was also the boy he’d made bleed in the bathroom, to such an extent that Myrtle had shrieked about a murder. That was worse than a nose stomp. Although, to be fair, Harry hadn’t known what the curse would do, and he was fairly confident that Malfoy had known exactly what kicking Harry's face in would do. But, that was in the past. Everything was different now -- Harry was different and Malfoy was different, too. The war had made everything shift, a little. Harry often thought about the negative things -- the losses, the scars. But maybe there were some good changes, too. Maybe it had forced them all to reevaluate their beliefs and their priorities. Maybe it had forced them to grow up.
Harry laughed and took a sip of his pint. “Yeah, I’m pretty chuffed about it. The previous teacher left all of a sudden for personal reasons and they needed somebody. McGonagall heard I’d quit the the Aurors and asked if I’d be interested. I hadn’t even thought about it, but when she said it, it just felt like a perfect fit.”
It meandered further away, around the next hill, and then began to descend. Soon, Draco could hear the crash of waves and a sound like thunder. And then they were coming out onto a very narrow, rocky beach that looked up at the steep cliffs. The camp was hidden behind the hill they’d just come down, so that you couldn’t see it from here. “Only come when the tide is low,” Lia warned, her eyes serious as she looked at him. “Always bring a lantern, of course. That path could be the death of you without a light to guide your way.”
“You know you’re not to be fraternizing with employees who work under you,” Burgot said. Draco could feel Potter trying not to giggle at the phrasing. “Or, rather, what I mean to say is –”
“I refuse to deal with you when you’re like this,” Harry said, glaring. He parted the curtains and swung his legs over the edge of the bed.
, though,” Harry said, his eyes intent on Draco’s now, no longer darting every which way. “They weren’t true. They might’ve been, once, but I knew full well that you weren’t that boy anymore. You’ve changed so much, and I had no right to bring up the past like that. I’m so sorry I did. I’m so sorry that I said what I said. I’ve felt awful about it, about hurting you.”
“So,” he said, running his hand through his hair and feeling very foolish and awkward all of a sudden. “That really is all I wanted to say.”
He looked over the map once more, desperately, and then remembered. All those times he’d looked for Draco in sixth year and he hadn’t been on the map, he’d been in the Room of Requirement. Harry picked up his Invisibility Cloak (which he’d tossed onto the floor in his search for the map) and set out.
Potter meandered over to Tim and ordered his usual neat whiskey, then turned, leaning back against the bar, and scanned the room. Draco had taken note of all the other tall, blonde, lean men in attendance this evening. There was one over on the dance floor and one sitting at a booth with a couple of women, but neither one was particularly attractive. And neither one was wearing skin-tight blue leather pants.
The hunger came on them slowly, in waves. They shifted closer together, ever closer, and soon Harry’s thigh was pressing between Draco’s legs. With careful fingers, Harry was lifting the hem of Draco’s shirt, up and over his head, and then there was a glorious press of warm skin against him. Harry’s hands made their way, slow as honey, down Draco’s back, down to the bare skin under his pants, his fingers brushing lightly over the curve of his arse.
Dean leaned forward and kissed Seamus softly, no tongue, but then after a moment, something changed. You could feel it, literally, in the air, a sort of charge that swept over them. Harry watched, astounded, as Dean’s hand slid up into Seamus’s hair, and Seamus’s hand went to Dean’s arm. Dean tilted his head to the side and then all of a sudden there
Astoria flicked the wand at Draco’s restraints, and he rushed over and pulled at Harry. Harry struggled against him for a moment and then sagged and stumbled away, falling to the floor, breathing hard. Nott was bloodied and broken on the ground, lying perfectly still once more.
“Well. I hope he didn’t want me to keep it quiet. But you ought to know that about your grandmother.” It felt important, suddenly, for Scorpius to know he came from not-entirely-awful stock. Only mostly awful. He seemed, against all odds, to be a sweet boy, and Harry hated that he so obviously believed himself to have come from a family with few redeeming qualities.
They all watched as the man twirled around, his legs woven around the pole, and leaned back so that he almost fell off but didn’t.
“Okay,” said Harry, nodding. “Um. I kind of already sort of said something to James. Not really. But kind of.”
“Yeah, well,” he said, looking embarrassed and a bit miserable. Suddenly Draco had an intense desire to make him smile and maybe even laugh again.
“Sure,” said Potter, sitting up straighter against the wall of the tree. “Have at it. I’ll wake you in a few hours.”
And although a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old Harry would’ve thought murdering Malfoy was a rather good idea, at this point, it made him sick to even think about it. Malfoy was his…well, he was a friend, wasn’t he? He was kind, and he was helpful, and he had been so good to Harry.  Harry couldn’t put himself in a position where he might hurt him, even if Malfoy was willingly opening himself up to it.
“How am I supposed to answer that? It’s such a nebulous concept. For Salazar’s sake.” Draco poked at the fire with a stick.
“Oh, good,” Draco said, sinking back down onto the pillow. He looked around. He was in a small room with brightly-painted walls of violet and ruby and a deep, emerald green. He was in a gloriously soft, high bed, stuffed with what had to be goosedown.  Nearby, there were tall windows facing the sea, and velvety green curtains drawn back to let in sunlight. “Where am I?”
Potter just laughed harder and Draco gave him a hard pinch at his waist and then another and then another, and suddenly Potter was shoving him down and climbing over him and holding his wrists at his sides, leaning over him.
“Okay,” he said, taking their hands. No floo today; he did not want to risk the soot. Sometimes that stuff didn’t come out with a cleaning spell.
He knew Hermione was probably a little lonely. Sure, she was friends with Katie Bell and Luna and Ginny and some of the other girls, and sure, she was going out with Zabini next weekend. But she was used to having Ron to always visit and call whenever she felt like it, and Harry remembered how strange that had been, after Ginny, to not have that one person anymore. To not have someone you could always talk to, at any time, night or day. But Harry could be this for her, maybe, for a while. While she needed it. “We’re watching movies and then I’ll probably make dinner,” he said.
“Yes, she’s part of it. Tony Goldstein is managing the campaign. He’s worked with me on several high-profile campaigns in the past, including Shacklebolt’s last one. He’s got an amazing track record. And Weasley’s helping out, and Pansy was supposed to, although that’s a whole different story. Hannah Abbott is going to be handling press. Just left the Prophet to join the team. It’s coming together nicely.”
Harry scrambled to spell the mess away, and offered to refill the wine, which was Ginevra’s. His cheeks were quite pink. Draco decided he loved this game, actually, and when Harry looked at him next, he offered him a small, knowing smile before looking away.
“Oh, fine,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. “This week, alright? We’ll keep it up for a week. Who knows if it’ll keep working, anyway. It might’ve been that we were both so exhausted we’d have crashed anyway.”
“Yes,” he said. And he did. He also had no idea if any of it would work, or whether he was clinging to hope where there was none.
Draco could not fall asleep. It was too much, being here in this strange place, looking up at the moons. He was so excited he could hardly stand it. He was terrified, too, of course, because he had seen that mud creature and the big cat, and that had been during his brief glimpse, so who knew what else was out here?
After that, it was time for breakfast. They sat together as they ate the fruit crepes Harry made, chatting about what to do that day, and Harry found himself checking the clock much too frequently. He didn’t want today to end. He didn’t want to go home.
“You’re telling me how I feel, now? Sorry, but you don’t get to do that. And what about you? How do you feel?”
Laurel stared at him and then started laughing. “A Sacred – do you mean a Gate? To another world? Oh, Thera, no. That’s the Seventh Pillar - Pinning. I can barely manage the Third Pillar, so trying to master the Seventh would be futile. No, almost no one can create Gates. Kerrick is the only one still living with that ability, I think.”
Draco didn’t mind coming in at all hours, really. He loved his job. He was proud to be part of such an elite, historically-important department. The Department of Mysteries had existed before the Ministry itself, and some of its secrets were older still. And the work itself was always challenging, always interesting.
He thought about Robards’s other remark as he began to walk. Robards had told him that they’d had two other meetings about his behavior. Harry desperatedly wanted to know when they’d happened. He wanted to see footage of his last few months, of every second of them, because he could no longer trust his own memory at all.
An especially loud bang made them all jump, and Draco found himself back against a wall, looking at Potter’s face with wide eyes. “What is that?” asked Potter.
Didn’t need anything but his mind, really. He gathered Sen and only vaguely heard one of the guards yell, “That’s him! The Dragon! Do it now!”
“Yes, yes, you’ve caught us out now,” Lia said, rolling her eyes. “We robbed a nobleman after getting sauced at a tavern and that’s how we ended up with a herd of horses.”
“Oh,” Draco said, thinking. “Maybe this is her feeling shut out and jealous already. I wish I could see how she acted around you. It would be helpful.”
“Hey –” Harry said, but Draco was already striding away, grabbing Pansy’s and Hermione’s hands and dragging them out to the dancefloor. Well. Harry’d very much enjoyed watching Draco dance last time. He supposed he could do it again for a while.
They rubbed soot over their faces to hide them from any Queensguard who might be up on the ramparts, and climbed aboard the little boat. No one spoke as they left the shore, Pike pushing the craft and Big Ham pulling, until they were deep enough that both men could jump in. After that, everything was silent except for the splash of the oars, and the crash of the waves. After an hour or so, Draco could see a great white tower hugging a cliffside that jutted out over the water. It was imposing and pale in the moonlight, like an enormous ghost. And it seemed very, very high up.
“No challenge there, Harry,” said Draco, planting a kiss on Lily’s head. “This girl’s going Ravenclaw. Mark my words.”
“I won’t be able to cast it there,” she said. “No magic, remember?” Hermione, like Harry, could not use her magic in March.
He left the pub and stepped into a quiet alleyway at quarter to eight and disapparated, surfacing in the entry of the townhouse. It was dark and empty, and suffocatingly silent. No one was out and about outside at this hour in this weather. Harry made his way to the kitchen and put the kettle on. When he’d texted Draco, he’d been hoping they’d fall into bed together, but now he thought maybe it would be good if he didn’t have that expectation. And besides, tea seemed necessary at the moment.
“About this. About Padma. I wasn’t looking at this as something real, you see. It seemed like something we were simply
“Of course you are,” she said, smiling gently at him. “There was never a hero who wasn’t. The fear is what makes you a hero, isn’t it? The fact that you’re scared and you do it anyway.”
One weekend in late February, Charlie said he had business in Brasov regarding a Peruvian Vipertooth that a wizard had been keeping illegally in Austria. Vipertooths were one of the most deadly species of dragon, and the only species that the Sanctuary had never taken in, so it was going to be a very complicated process if they did decide to take this one. Charlie left on Friday after work and was supposed to come home Sunday.
They left it there, just like they had every other time. Of course Pansy had to say it wasn’t his fault. She was his friend; that was her job. But it was. He knew it was. He ought to have known, given the way Blaise had been with him the last time they’d talked. He’d seemed unhinged, especially for Blaise, for whom control was a form of art, the pursuit of a lifetime. Draco had known he wasn’t doing well, it was painfully obvious. But he’d thought…
“Yes, of course,” Draco said, his gray eyes flickering over to Harry. “It’s been a while since I’ve been anywhere like this, is all.”
“It would’ve, wouldn’t it?” said Harry. “Next time. We’ll bet on Lily-Bug.” He winked at her and she giggled.
“Let me see!” cried Sarah, grabbing his phone. “Oh, fuck, you weren’t kidding, Harry. She’s hot as shit.”
“I – I just didn’t expect that I’d be talking to her about anything so soon. I’m not…” He trailed off, looking so uncomfortable that Harry almost felt sorry for him.
Pansy came rushing in, Blaise on her heels. She was wearing a trampy version of a Hogwarts uniform, with a button-up shirt that was tied up right below her breasts and not buttoned at all, so that you could clearly see her lacy black bra. She had on a skirt that barely covered her arse, and a Slytherin tie that was, frankly, useless, considering the rest of the outfit. Also in play were knee-high socks, of course. A nod had been made to the school robes, sort of: she had on a waist-length black cape hanging from her shoulders.
His come was all over Harry’s cock and if he hadn’t just had an orgasm, just the feel of it and the thought of it would’ve made him come all over again. And it did make Harry come a moment later. Draco decided that watching Harry come was something he wanted to do forever. His eyes, which had been shut tight, opened up for a moment, a brilliant green flash, and his lips parted in a wordless cry before his eyes shut again and his head fell back as his hips gave a final set of jerky thrusts and his cock spilled over their bellies.
“It’s okay,” Draco said. Maybe he shouldn’t say that. It wasn’t okay. He needed Potter to not do it again. But he didn’t want Potter harboring a bunch of guilty feelings about it. “Forget about that.”
He looked over the words of the spell again and committed them fully to memory, then closed his own eyes and murmured the incantation. He ran through it once and nothing happened. He tried again. He opened his eyes and looked at his notes. He was saying it correctly, wasn’t he?
Harry put his mouth to Draco’s ear. “It’s been on my mind constantly. The feel of you, the feel of your mouth on mine, your mouth on my body.
“I’ve got to – I need to do something,” Draco said, pulling up a pair of jeans as quickly as he could and grabbing a shirt.
Draco almost didn’t hear it, he was so lost in his own pleasure. It was only when he finally slowed that it hit him.
They apparated into what looked to be an airfield. “We’re southwest of Lowestoft,” Charlie explained. “Come on.”
Harry picked up his glass of whiskey, looked at it, and picked up the bottle instead. He went out onto the roof and drank until he passed out.
And then he left, and Harry missed him a little, but not the way he missed Draco, who worked just down the hall from him and who he saw almost every day, but who was never
jealous, and still is. I mean, we always talk about how he stares at us and gets all tense whenever we cuddle up together, and how he’s always bringing up your inside jokes when I’m around, as if he’s trying to prove that he’s closer to you than I am or something. But he hasn’t really
“And he’s expecting me, yes?” Draco asked, straightening his tie and still stubbornly not taking the Portkey. He was rather dressed up for a weekend, in a blue bespoke muggle suit, but he wanted to look impressive while presenting his case. Potter wouldn’t want to hitch his wagon to someone who didn’t look the part.
But they didn’t, they just looked on with curiosity as Frankie hurtled through the gate, and only then did the shouting Queensguard appear on the road that led out of the city. Frankie was laughing now, as they continued down the road, turning around to look at the scene of chaos behind them. “What the fuck was that?” Draco breathed.
Draco nodded. “I can, and it all sounds so incredible. I mean, what little witch or wizard doesn't want to work with dragons when they grow up? And here you are actually doing it. Sorry, by the way, that I can’t tell you too much in return. You know how Mysteries is.”
Draco felt his hand coil into a fist, and he had to do battle with himself to refrain from pulling his elbow back and letting it fly. “If I were to fuck him, it would be none of your damn business, Potter.”
They were quiet for a moment, and then Potter’s hand was on his arm, warm and solid. “What the fuck would I do if you died? I’d be here all by myself.”
“So, what now? Did you have a moral crisis immediately following? Or no, because then you wouldn’t be in such a good mood. You’d be brooding.”
Al brightened and hugged him back. “Yeah, me too. Plus your house is wicked. I’ve never seen anything so big outside of Parliament.”
“What do you think of this one?” said a nearby voice. Harry looked up and saw a guy in, probably, his early twenties, standing there, looking at the same piece he was. Harry was currently checking out a sculpture called
Berold nodded. “Rouse the rest of them, will you?” he said to Laurel. “Dragon, come with me. I might need you to incapacitate some of them.” He jerked his head towards the warden’s room.
“Have you ever kissed a bloke?” Potter asked, and then added quickly, “You don’t have to say, of course.”
together, which makes me wish I just stayed at work and hadn’t bothered to see him at all. We fight, it escalates.” She sighed.
Harry shrugged. “I can’t remember. I’ve tried. At first I was thinking it was a waiter, but look at the table.”
He sent Linda a letter (she lived in Key West, Florida) thanking her and telling her she was welcome to visit London any time she wanted and could stay in Grimmauld Place with him. And at the last minute, he stuck a picture of him with Draco from way back when into the envelope. Not one of his favorites, but one where you could see, by the look on their faces, that something was bubbling between them. He wrote a short PS – “This is the guy I told you about. He’s pretty handsome, right? Not as handsome as your husband was, though, I’m sure. He sounds like he was a right sexy bastard.”
Harry blinked at him, then seemed to sag. “Ollivander. Your father’s wand, Draco. Voldemort had it. My wand destroyed it. Voldemort doesn’t understand why.
Harry got out and toweled himself off and put on pajamas. He walked back out and Draco was waiting there with a toothbrush in a plastic package. “Thought you could use this,” he said, almost shyly.
“Okay,” said Harry. One of the scars went up the side of Malfoy’s neck. Harry’d never noticed it, but Malfoy wore collared shirts. Harry trailed a finger over that one, which led into Malfoy’s hairline, just a bit, and Malfoy made a tiny, almost inaudible sort of whine.
Draco was still shivering, but he could inhale without choking. So that was good, he supposed. He nodded.
The trek out of Glum’s Marsh was unpleasant as ever, the shriek flies and the gators making Draco jump and yelp more than he liked to admit. But on the other side of the river, they’d been able to mount their horses. The land was higher, dry, and soon grasses turned to farm fields, spots of green shooting out in neat, even rows, and then they were on a road – an actual road, dirt, but still, it was cleared of debris and neatly packed. Civilization.
Later, perhaps an hour or two or three, Lia was asleep. Draco was up keeping watch, still not feeling tired. He was feeling stupid, though. Stupid because he had the sinking feeling that he’d wasted their time. They could have been at Glum’s Marsh, helping prepare for the rescue, and instead he was here, doing fuck-all. And he’d also royally pissed Ilana off, which probably wasn’t a good thing. Especially since she had the ability to create Sacred Doors, which might’ve really come in handy at some point in the future.
Which was fine, and, given that this was Pansy, didn’t even surprise him all that much. However, it had the unintended consequence of bringing him and Potter together fairly regularly.
Draco broke into a run when he was around the corner of the next building, running until he reached his own. And then he rushed inside, winding his way through the beds until he collapsed onto his own. Potter was lying on the bed next to his, facing away from Draco. He looked to be sleeping.
“Fuck off, Potter. Like you have any idea what I want,” Draco ground out. “And what, you’d rather I languish away in misery for the rest of my life? You’d rather I never got to move on from the war? If you didn’t want me to move on from it, you shouldn’t have spoken for me at the trials. You could’ve had me rotting in Azkaban all these years. I’m sure that would’ve been much more satisfying, hm?”
Draco rolled his eyes and then rolled his body away from the point of the practice sword and leapt to his feet, grabbing his own sword as he went. “You’re still one away from a victory, Potter. Don’t count it as a win yet.”
This felt fucking amazing, but it was full of something else entirely. Something hard and angry, raw and wanting. Harry was fucking into him without mercy, without touch except for his hands on Draco’s hips, leaving bruises. He was fucking him like he’d fuck a whore. Like there was nothing to this besides Harry’s desire for release. Like Draco was hardly a person at all, like he was just a vehicle for Harry’s pleasure, a tool, a hole. And fuck if that wasn’t making Draco moan louder, even as it made his heart clench in his chest.
“It definitely makes her laugh more,” Potter offered, which wasn’t even that funny, but Hermione apparently thought it was, because she began laughing so hard that she fell off of her chair and managed to pull Mandy down with her, and then the two of them just stayed on the floor.
Harry nodded, and then, for the first time in a long time, saw Grimmauld Place through the eyes of a newcomer. It was rather terrible, if you weren’t used to it. “Yeah. Haven’t done much to fix it up.”
“Not much to know,” Harry said, and Ari started laughing. “I mean, not much to know besides what everyone knows.”
, and could’ve housed a thousand people. All of it had the same renovated, cheerful air as the entryway and the sitting room, except for one particular wing. “Lucius and Narcissa’s old quarters,” Pansy whispered, looking uncomfortable. “Draco won’t touch it. It’s fucking creepy if you ask me, like a mausoleum. He’s got a few hang-ups where his parents are concerned. Don’t tell him I said that.”
“That's ridiculous. The only point in having enemies is so you can defeat them, kill them, brush them aside."
Saturday dawned bright and warm, and Draco was anxious as he put on a pair of jeans and a gray, long-sleeved shirt over a plain white short-sleeved one. Charlie had said to dress in light layers; hopefully this was acceptable. At 9:30 sharp, Charlie stepped out of the floo. Draco was waiting for him in the living room, having spent the last half hour dusting and straightening things that really didn’t need to be straightened in an attempt to burn off some of his nervous energy.
He smiled tightly. “There’s more I’d like to tell you. Only I can’t. That’s one of the things I can say.”
William was to the center of the battle now, swinging his broadsword like mad, and when the Stags around him noticed who it was, they froze and let their swords clatter to the ground, much to Draco’s relief. Inspired by William’s influence over the men, Draco cast a
“We’re going to break some hearts tonight, eh, Malfoy?” she said, spinning so that her dress swished around her ankles delicately.
“The Marchmen, of course,” said Frankie, grinning. “My people. Not that you’d ever know it, given our status.”
Potter was staring at him, his green eyes taking everything in, his hands twisting between his knees as he listened.
Malfoy explained all the things he was currently brewing, detailing why he’d left the heat on or not, and why it was okay to stop at whatever point he’d stopped in the brewing. Lily was full of questions, which Malfoy answered carefully, taking pains to ensure that Lily was satisfied and understood.
being nice,” she said. “That was a compliment. Draco was always quite proud of his cock-sucking skills.”
“Don’t get me wrong,” Frankie said, smiling kindly at them. “They’re lovely. So big and strong. And the lines of them – I’ve never seen such graceful beasts. We’ll be able to use them, no doubt about it.”
Harry thought he was probably telling the truth. Malfoy didn’t seem to have many scruples when it came to sex. “What if you found out someone did that to Scorpius?”
“That I was sorry. That I shouldn’t have screamed at you. And I think I understand how everything might’ve happened, how you got caught up in all that stuff. And I shouldn’t have been so judgmental. That’s not what a friend does, or at least not in the way I did it. I should’ve listened. You had it figured out anyway, by then. I should’ve listened and encouraged you to stop. I dunno.”
“You’ve been an arsehole to everyone in this family. Even my dad, who’s the nicest man in the universe. You’re a terrible, terrible person, Malfoy. I’d like to punch you in the face.”
Harry nodded and went about making the sandwich while Malfoy opened up one of the cabinets and took out two teacups.
“SLYTHERIN!” yelled the hat, and the table around Draco erupted in cheers. Up at the head table, Dumbledore looked flabbergasted and McGonagall looked like she’d just bitten into a lemon and Snape was…well, Snape was sneering like usual. Draco found he couldn’t stand, because what the fuck was happening.
Draco wanted to sit beside her, to comfort her, but he kept moving, trying not to look too closely at the bodies that littered the field. It stank of blood, and of filth, and he put the back of his hand to his nose in an effort to not be sick.
was this world’s Edwin. And nobody wanted Edwin with the hero in the end. Edwin should not end up with William and live happily ever after. It would never happen, and if it somehow
Pansy grinned. “I don’t know, I think I might enjoy talking to him about it. I always thought he was rather fit.” Harry tried not to choke on his tea. “Would you like more tea, by the way? And, oh, I didn’t offer you any scones or biscuits, did I? I’m a terrible hostess. Not my house, though, so. But would you like any?”
Draco drank, maintaining eye contact, and Ginny fell back onto the bed, squealing. “Haha! Oh, Circe! Draco Malfoy is a pouf!”
things he needed to do, things related to the campaign). He needed to talk to Hermione, that much was obvious. He needed to know where she’d gotten her information. Astoria was the only one besides Draco who knew of the engagement, and she’d promised not to tell anyone. But clearly, she had. Daphne, maybe, or one of her girlfriends. He supposed he couldn’t blame her, not entirely. It’d been sort of shit for him to insist on a secret engagement.
It was still light outside after supper, and some of the soldiers returned to the training fields while others lingered in the Great Hall, drinking and talking. Draco’s body had been taxed enough; he needed to give it a rest before tomorrow’s training.
“I love babies,” Draco said, looking dreamy. “I love their little toes and their rolls and their tiny little fingernails and the way their skin smells.”
him and he was just a sad shell of a man. By the time Potter arrived – without Katie, who was probably busy saving hippogriffs or whatever the fuck it was that she did – Draco practically had steam shooting out of his ears. His anger only burned brighter from there, because Potter’s tuxedo looked amazing on him and, unlike Phi’s, it was turning Draco on to a reprehensible degree.
“I heard it from Draco, actually. I was quite upset when I got your note, so I went to talk to him and he told me what happened.”
