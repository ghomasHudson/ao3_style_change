"Andromeda Tonks," Snape replied, bowing suitably low to greet a woman of the Black family. Married or not, this witch deserved his respect. "Your grandson will be cured without any lingering symptoms. You have my word."
Completely taken aback by this coherent, yet slightly awkward phrase - up until now, the little elf had but offered two-word sentences - the young wizard nearly missed, her turning around with a confused look. "Serve what … serve what?" She pondered, still clutching her master's trousers. Yet before Kreacher could offer a suggestion, her face lit up, and she beamed at Harry.
"Well," the blond rose and neatened his sleeves. "In that case, I will go and find out how I can be of service. Excuse me, please."
"Men like Rosier don't stop until someone forces them to. But Astoria has kept me from opening an investigation by not pressing charges."
"Yea," the young wizard had confirmed conversationally. "In the old days, being a parselmouth was considered a gift. Mostly because parselmagic is exceptionally good with healing- and warding-spells. But as far as I understand, it was kept a secret by the Black Family so they could keep an advantage over other families who had no according abilities."
"Draco, why don't you show your friend the guest-room. She will be expected at the Ministry in a few hours anyway. No use in her going home." Also, Harry certainly did not want the older sister of an abused witch out on the street with a few hours to kill before work. Who knew what could happen?
How interesting, the young witch pondered upon sipping her freshly brewed tea. Obviously, structural changes to her cell were not permitted, and neither was taking her out. But anything that could be brought inside seemed to be fair game. Snuggling into the armchair she had requested, Hermione closed her eyes. If she was smart about this, she could surely find a way to contact Harry. Surely her brain would work better if she allowed herself a few minutes of rest.
Slowly turning around in Draco's desk chair, where he had gone over Snape's medical records after Emilia had shared her concerns, Harry demanded, "Come again."
In New Zeeland, he found flowers unlike any he had seen before. So precious and vibrant, that he acquired a whole kilo of different seeds and sent them home, along with a library of books about their cultivation for Neville.
Quietly she revealed, "Firewood is not part of the budget until November."
"Sure," she shrugged. "It was essential for Harry to learn how to close his mind to Voldemort, back at Hogwarts, when they were still connected through the … through his scar."
This was not how he had envisioned the integration to go. "No," Harry breathed, "No. No. No. No. No! Please!" He had to pull back. Get the magic to let go of the portrait, but it would not obey his wishes any longer. Tearing up, he couldn't help but curl around Severus' arms when the Potion Master stabilised him from behind, as he broke to his knees. Hot tears started to stream down Harry's cheeks as he sobbed. That was not what he had wanted. They were supposed to be alright. Blanketed, not covered! The wards were supposed to accept them, not cover them up, maybe even destroying them! Yet there was nothing Harry could do. Merely stare and wait.
"May I ask what this is?" Narcissa inquired, holding up her beverage.
Without a word, all three purebloods followed. None of them had any inclination to get into the witch's way.
"Duly noted." After a moment, the young Auror added, "Oh and get Severus to tell your mom. We don't want to add another strain on your parent's relationship by your father keeping yet another secret."
"I see," the wizard stated, then he pulled open the door and rushed up the stairs. Draco followed on his heels. The Potion Master needed a few moments to orient himself in the setup, then approached the long shelves that lined one wall, inspecting the available ingredients. "You copied my setup."
Rolling his eyes, because the little girl was basically a mirror of her mother, Severus turned towards the room in question. Holding out his hand, he demanded, "Now come along, you impertinent child! I don't have all night, and your gums seem to be bleeding still."
"Then what's the problem?"
Gently, the raven-haired corrected, "Maybe if he had not thought about blood purity so much, instead of what was best for his wife and kid, none of this would have happened, in the first place. I mean your father was a big supporter of Tom. He might have had a harder time, without someone like Lucius' on his side, or with him outright opposing him!"
(This takes place on New Year's Eve. Just to give you a little timeframe).
Raising his eyebrows, because finally, the man was asking the right question, the raven-haired replied, "Not a clue, to be honest."
Not knowing who was on the other end of the floo-call, Snape made a few swift steps into the room and closed the connection. Then he advanced on the former Death Eater, anger burning through his veins. "How dare you?" He whispered, then continued in a roar, "
Taking in the numbers on his alarm clock, Harry sighed contently and snuggled back under the covers. Friday! Best day of the week, in his opinion. If no lead came up, all they had to do was boring paperwork, maybe some light investigating and around one, they would head out. Lunch in the Leaky Cauldron with his friends was the best part of Harry’s week.
When soft snoring filled the quiet of the room a few minutes later, Draco looked up from his doodle. He had decided within the hour after Harry had shared his intentions about the prank, which potion and colour additives to prepare. But Severus' journals, especially those of his earlier years, were notoriously dry, that you had to fight the desire to dunk the entire thing into a cauldron of tea, just to spice them up a little. There really was no better reading material to put anyone to sleep.
--O-O--
A knock on the door brought Draco with lunch. Confused, he looked from the patient, who obviously tried very hard to hold on to his bad temper, to Emilia, who appeared nearly giddy. "What are you doing?" Though he was grateful that his godfather now actively participated in his recovery, Draco was seriously worried, because the man seemed to grow angrier every day. Now, however, Severus' eyes were dancing with mirth, despite his attempts to appear otherwise.
pawned off that task to Neville.
"I'm blaming you for this!" Neville choked out, inspecting their surroundings by brushing his hands over the rubble.
"That's good …" the other wizard nodded. After a while, he whispered. "I could not even say goodbye, you know. He was there, right by my side, as always, and then he just wasn't. From one second to the next he was just … gone."
"It's not bragging if it's true!" The other replied haughtily. "My point being, you can expand your home in any direction, look here," he pointed at one of the latest blueprints. "There is an entire dungeon under the cellar we use. That means ventilation and - since it was added just at the beginning of the last century - I would say plumbing. The layout is more than big enough for two separate labs with a study between them. The only problem would be the heating as the chimney does not go below the ground floor."
"Very well," Harry sighed tiredly. "Nev, tell Kreacher to show you the guest-room and get you whatever you need. See you tomorrow."
Looking at her, Harry stated seriously, "That your sister won't be admitted to St. Mungos but end up in our morgue. I have seen such cases, Daphne, and though we try the husband with the full force of our law, it doesn't bring back their victims."
"Does Master have any more stupid questions, or is Kreacher free to return to his duties?"
"Is this about Draco?" Nott inquired, looking at Astoria, who stood in the shadow of her older sister, head held high.
"Likewise." Then the Potion Master turned towards the Head Auror, "You want to lower your wand."
"Draco … whoa, stop right there!" Finally understanding the problem, Harry shook his head. "I can find a hundred tasks for you if that's what it takes to uphold the conditions of the oath. Lucius isn't around 24/7 either, and he's bound to me under much stricter conditions than you. Also, who said anything about me not
Clearly not liking this one bit, Ron asked mulishly. "Why make Neville head of the investigation and not you? No offence, Nev, but nobody knows Hermione better than you and me."
"What should I say?"
“Pants as well?”
"How do you do it?" The witch inquired, realising that her nephew needed a little boost of confidence before he could help them effectively.
was the one making it. Yet before he could try and stop himself, panic raced through his system. The Shack. Voldemort. Nagini! … It all came back to him. By Merlin, he was dying!
"Somehow, I doubt that."
--O-O--
When the Malfoys came down from the second floor, they found their host, holding his house-elf up by the neck, pointing his wand at the creature’s anxious face. He was livid, and despite the years that had passed, all three could see the warrior that had managed to inspire an entire nation to stand up to the darkest wizard of their time.
Grumbling under his breath, the house elf put a lot of effort into not smiling. Instead, he instructed, "Master wants to eat his breakfast now. It's getting cold."
Breathing evenly, Lucius shook his head, "No, my Lord."
"Yes, he was in fifth year, while I was in sixth."
"Your jumper was the first item anybody gave me that actually fit," Harry recalled, gesturing at the red piece of wool, with the Gryffindor Lion.
Startled by the cup that slipped through the blond's fingers, Harry looked up and noticed the tension in Draco's frame. Still, the young man forced a smile when shaking his head. "I'm afraid I can't, Teddy. I'm not allowed to go out and my … our horses at home were … they died a few years ago."
"Alright, …" the boy, no, young man dragged out, clearly unsure where to begin. Severus was just contemplating if he had the strength for a comforting gesture when Harry started. "It's January the second … no, by now third, 2004." He had lost nearly six years of his life. Well, considering that he had been close to losing his life altogether, Severus ought to consider himself lucky. Funny, though, it did not feel that way.
"How long are they at it, today?" The blond inquired while adding a splash of milk to his mother's cup.
"The wards must have deteriorated."
"No?" George challenged, folding his arms, glaring. He wanted this fight, needed it because it seemed to be the only way to get rid of all the pain that filled his heart every day he woke up without his twin by his side.
Judging the sincerity of his Aurors, Robarts picked up a form. "Fine, spells up to level three and defensive magic only. A trace will be applied, and you will personally be responsible for any magic she casts, Alexander."
The next evening around six, Ron and Hermione walked out of the floo, stacked with Tupperware containers to the tops of their heads. Though still using stasis charms, Ron had come to adore the colourful, plastic boxes, especially when transporting food.
--O-O--
… were at it until around midnight. There was money, valuables, books, all very fascinating, but …"
Aurors were coming up to them, scrutinising the scene, "Mrs Granger, would you tell us what is going on? You are aware that it is frowned upon to cast a spell in the Atrium?"
Snickering under his breath, Harry shook his head. "Somehow, I doubt that. It's just, all of his assets were frozen and transferred to Draco upon his death. The goblins need to see him and confirm his identity before they can release his vault back to him."
As a result of his years of service to the Dark Lord, the white−haired man did not even startle at the harsh command, neatly setting the cup down. Only the slight trembling of his hands betrayed his distress when he tilted his head and stated, "Forgive me, my Lord."
Snape interrupted him hoarsely. "Lily had these cufflinks made for your father's seventeenth birthday. They are white gold with her letters engraved into the backside. I don't think you'll find anything in your parent's vault as valuable as these."
"That makes no sense whatsoever," Charles Leewood, a colleague who specialised in behavioural analysis, stated before biting into a sandwich. After he had consumed his early lunch - or late breakfast, depending on the view - he went over their notes. "Finch's 'The Cores That Make Us' is a more modern version of the second book. And one of the five books missing from the Library at the Manchester University, along with two volumes that deal with wizarding biology and development. One that contains the same information about muggles and an anatomy book. There is no rhyme nor reason to these volumes. Don't you think that the core-book has not been merely checked out and never returned?"
Pulling Draco's notes closer, Ron shook his head, "No clue."
"Kreacher!"
"Ouch," The raven-haired mumbled, pulling out a baking-tray so Rose could arrange her cookie-dough.
When his partner did not reply, the current Lord Longbottom shook his head. "When you think about marriage, you've always had this idea of romantic love in your head, Harry. But that's not what our lives are about. Your love for all of us, your chosen family and friends enabled you to walk into that forest camp without any lingering doubts in your heart. Dumbledore called it your greatest strength, didn't he? 'The Power the Dark Lord knows not!' It makes you the strongest wizard I know."
Trembling from exhaustion, he sank back onto the mattress. "I have to get better!"
At Harry's and Severus' confused looks, Lily elaborated, "Your wards were quite welcoming, even to the souls of the dead."
"Of course not," Molly Weasley bustled. "Just go into the living-room. This Sunday it's only Lucius and Narcissa, and Hermione and Ron. And they are playing on that computer-thing again. It seems to be great fun."
Seemingly unbothered, the wizard in question repaired his bent glasses and straightened his clothes. Draco's eyes were most certainly not drawn to the happy trail, that led from the raven-haired's navel to the waistband of his jeans. He just wanted to change. The only reason for this conversation were his dress-robes, thank you very much!
Thinking this over, Griphook nodded, "You could."
the first picture of him," the redhead defended himself weakly, aware that he was losing ground rapidly.
"What is my redeeming quality?" He burst out suddenly.
"I …," reminding himself that the life of evasion and misdirection lay behind him, Severus did not confirm Kingsley's opinion, but merely nodded, "Thank you."
Straightening, so he could look over the edge at the mostly naked pureblood, Ron frowned, "One of them. Why are you on the floor?"
Harry hugged Ron when he stepped out of the floo of the Granger-Weasley home, a few hours later. Immediately, he picked up Rose, who had come running when she had heard his voice. He sidestepped so Lucius could greet their host, twirling the little girl through the air. "How's my favourite little flower this evening?"
"Harry? … Harry!" A gentle hand was shaking him.
"Go on, then."
"Maybe …" Draco spoke quietly and in a strange kind of rush. Harry would be back soon, after all. Gesturing towards a particular vial in their 'first-aid-potions-kit'. "This is something of a … mood enhancer. It strengthens a wizard's core by drawing his magic in. Only a few drops a day are necessary, and the person who takes it will feel much stronger."
"You?" Daphne suggested.
"I …," Harry repeated, but still seemed confused.
“Sir had coffee.”
"Send a message."
(See the end of the chapter for
"What is my redeeming quality?" Lucius burst out suddenly. Since he had been studying his opposite, he did not miss the small smile the young man hid before looking up.
"Fine, so, the truth is: you don't deserve this; any leniency at all. You captured and tortured me, my friends, and probably countless others in service to your Lord. Though we have never been able to prove it, you might have killed innocent people as well. Lucius Malfoy was a bastard who deserved to rot in Azkaban for the rest of his life. Maybe, even receive the Dementor's Kiss." Looking up, Harry noticed that the other man's posture had not changed one bit. His face was frozen, and only the interwoven fingers over his knee betrayed him. He was clutching them so tightly, that his entire hands had gone white.
"What would Fred say?" George spat out venomously, glaring down at the other. "That's the whole damn point of this! Don't you get it? I have no clue what Freddy would say! What he would say about our latest line of protective wristbands for the Ministry or my idea of expanding to France. I don't know, Harry, because my brother is dead!"
Slowly reaching out, pulling the ever-present strand of dark hair out of Severus Snape's face, Harry whispered, "Good night, Sir."
Floating over the tray, gently setting it down on the desk in front of the window, the elf insisted, "Sir has to keep up his strength. Mistress was very insistent that Ruby made sure Sir is eating properly."
"He did!" Ron confirmed. "Hugo's not a fan of late nights. He's always fussy the next day. Hermione has been home on time regularly since she entered her second trimester."
Stepping aside to make room for Ron and Hermione, he looked at his fuming Potion Master. "Gringotts. I told you so at dinner."
"You don't need it any longer, Harry. Please, let go and go to bed."
Hovering an inch away from Harry's nose, the Slytherin ghost glared down at the wizard. "Don't dare to imply for a second, that I would not know the time and place where the head of Slytherin house perished; especially on Hogwarts grounds!" The spectre hissed venomously and only pulled back when Harry deflated. "Now tell the truth, child!"
"Dad?" Harry whispered tonelessly.
Hitting the back of his head against the wall, easing the pain in his heart with the pain in his skull, he looked at the ceiling despondently. "That's all I want for him: a chance to live his own life. He can even continue hating me for all I care. I just really, really need for him to wake up. So, please … please, help me!"
Since Ron was currently turning the potions journal upside down, frowning at the page, Hermione took the time to answer, "I think Ron doubts your interpretation of 4 ∆ 75."
Interpreting the grateful look in his eyes correctly, she brushed a dark strand of hair out of his face and tilted her head. "You are welcome."
Either this would work, with her sister and her son and her nephew by her side, or her cousin Sirius would forever be banned from the family. Looking into the young Harry Potter's eyes, she slowly pulled the wand from his fingers. Failure was not an option.
"The beetle-root and the scarab shells will never be strong enough to initiate that reaction."
Smiling a little, his wife had replied, "He will wear these."
"Then make them!" Severus sneered, before waving Harry out. "Now, go. I am tired."
"And the fact that he is more interested in male company does not help either."
"Then, who?"
With a tilt of her head that inexplicably looked both regal and grateful, Narcissa merely replied, "Thank you," before reaching for the hand Molly had offered with a smile and allowed the other witch to pull her into the circle. Immediately Teddy beamed at her and reached for her hand as well. He then stood sandwiched between his grandmother and his great-aunt.
Snape interrupted him hoarsely. "Lily had these made for your father's seventeenth birthday. They are white gold with her letters engraved into the backside. I don't think you'll find anything in your parent's vault as valuable as these."
"But if whatever passage is only accessible by those who know about it and we need what's beyond …"
"The Dark …," Narcissa started quietly, but after a glance towards Harry, she corrected herself, "Voldemort held court here."
"That's really cheap for a month-long holiday," her brother looked at her somewhat concerned. "Will we have to work for our living? Is this your comeback for the tricot?"
Once she had been gone, the young wizard had merely lain on the floor panting, pathetically grateful for the pain to be gone. Then, he had staggered into the bathroom, to scrub the make-up off his face. While he was at it, he had torn the blood-soaked shirt off his body, throwing it into a corner. Then, he had hesitated, looking into 'his' bedroom, before pulling the cufflinks out of the gap-space between the dresser and the wall, where he had hidden them. Clenching his fist around them, he had met his own eyes in the mirror. They had been red and blood-shot, both from crying and the harsh scrubbing. Much like the rest of his face.
Harry, having taken the time to study his Slytherins, interrupted before Lucius could reply. "That does not really matter, does it? It's just the way of Slytherins to look out for their own advantages. But as far as I understood, that does not mean that you do not care for your friends."
"You were screaming, Harry," She sniffed, before she told him angrily. "It must have been really painful, since I know how high your threshold is. So, don't tell me not to cry! Shut up and let Hermione can take care of you!"
in front of me!"
"There would still have been a reckoning. And I would have still stood by your side. Oh, Harry, …" Reaching out as if to offer comfort, Fred clenched his fists when he remembered that he couldn't any longer. "It was my decision, always has been. And even if I had known what would come of it, I would not change a thing. I don't regret it for a second. I'm just here to tell you thanks. Thank you, for everything you have done for my brothers and everything you still do. Please tell Ron 'thank you' as well, he might not have my charm and wits, and especially not my good looks, but with him at Georgie's side, Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes will become more successful than it could have ever been with me. He's so smart and resourceful, with him, George can achieve anything. And tell him to stop feeling guilty and accept the bloody partnership! They make enough money to still feed the fund, even with him taking his rightful due." Looking over Harry's shoulder, Fred hesitated before gazing at Harry once more. "There is just one last thing, a message from Lily. Are you ready to hear it?"
With an absent-minded smile, Draco agreed, and Harry departed for the Ministry.
−−O−O−−
Said mother-figure brushed through Grimmauld Place like a storm, the next day. Between berating Harry for not being more careful at work, setting Draco on so many tasks it made his head spin, and cooking enough food to satisfy an army, both men were exhausted when Molly Weasley left at five to be home in time to prepare dinner for her own family. Harry and Draco had eaten more and far healthier than on any other day of the week, and the house was squeaky clean.
"Yes. And you kissed!" That seemed to be the crux of the matter.
Rolling his eyes at the ever-occurring argument, the young wizard wanted to know, "Do we have any pictures suitable for this room?"
−−O−O−−
"You are still blaming yourself, aren't you?"
Looking his Auror dead in the eye, Robarts stated, "You pinpointed the location of Lucius Malfoy's item in Westwood Gardens. I don't care if you find the damn thing under a bush or by Malfoy's side!"
That, however, seemed to be anything but an easy question, since Malfoy started to fidget with his cup, unable or unwilling to look up. After two minutes, Harry grew tired of waiting and exhaled, “Listen, if you came over for a cup of tea, Kreacher will serve you to your heart's content, and I’ll go back to bed. Not that it is not … delightful,” he spat, “to have a former Death Eater in my house, I have work today and plans for lunch.”
"Yes, only much stronger; full to the brim with parselmagic. However, it isn't yet not strong enough to break through the wards of this place. That's why we will have to 'boost the signal', so to speak." Making a small incision in her lower arm - why people had to always dramatically cut their palms had always been beyond her - the young witch let a few drops of blood drip into the circle. Then she conjured her fire and lit the oil. Clenching Lucius' hand, she closed her eyes and leaned over the circle.
Sighing, Harry kissed his godson's trembling fingers. "I can't do that, and you know it."
It was warm and comfortable. The room was equipped with polished furniture that gleamed in the light of a merrily crackling fire. The bed was made with sheets of yellow-green silk, and the sofa and armchairs were embroidered with shimmering dark-green satin strands on thick butter-yellow upholstery. His trousers were made of the finest cotton, hugging his figure, presenting him at his best. It was luxury on par with what he had been used at the Manor during his childhood. Yet, Draco did not feel welcome, on the contrary. He was cowering in a corner, as far away from the door as possible.
"No?" Harry gazed at his vassal, his face a picture of innocence. "Well, in that case, you better keep up!" Tossing the platinum-haired the Nimbus 2000, he summoned again, "Accio Firebolt!"
The situation from last night seemed to have resolved itself naturally. Neither did Lucius glare at him over the breakfast table nor did Draco act notably subdued, on the contrary. The blond had an animated discussion with his mother, about a book on blood-magic he had found in the library. On the one hand, Harry asked himself how much time the Slytherin actually spent on the task he had set him upon. On the other hand, for all he cared, Draco could spend his days reading the entire library, as long as that kept him entertained and away from the Manor. The last week had done the young man a lot of good because although he was still pale, his face had lost the pasty complexion and the rings under his eyes had vanished.
−−O−O−−
Rubbing his temples, Harry sighed. "And how do you know about Draco's research? Did he talk to you about it?"
"Thank you for taking care of my son, Severus." James Potter stated sincerely. "And thank you even more for allowing him to take care of you. I know you only did it because Lily didn't give you another choice, but clearly, the two of you are better off for it."
“So, you haven’t set Draco upon the task to catalogue your library by hand out of spite?” She asked hesitantly. “You really can’t find the right books?”
"Honestly, it's hard to imagine wizards getting
The master bedroom, Neville had guided him into, had been as grand as one would except for the Lord of Noble House. But once Harry had set foot into it, he had felt like stepping into a fairy tale. Every surface held at least one plant, more often than not two or three; a huge four-poster-bed served as a climbing post for tiny white roses. Approaching the overgrowing piece of furniture, Harry half expected to find sleeping beauty there, like in Dudley's old books. But instead, he spotted a black and white comforter; stitched little spiders with big eyes, crawling all over it. "Luna."
"What if your friends come over?" Draco wanted to know.
"You 'bought' him?"
"Accio Fred's sock," Mr Weasley mumbled, allowing his wife to fill it up, before hanging it on the mantlepiece.
"Promise me, young Lord," the witch demanded. "Promise that you will return my portrait to this wall, as soon as your friend is finished."
--O-O--
And with that, he guided his 'boy-toy' towards the buffet to serve him some wine.
"They are Potter heirloom. James Potter wore them on his wedding day," Severus shared, studying the small links.
Shaking her head at these antics, Andromeda followed at a much more sedated pace.
That place of 'honour' was reserved for one particular dream. Walking into the carnage of the Potter's home, he felt hollow and as a spectator in his own body. Climbing over the body of a hated rival, he felt nothing. Watching the door to the nursery being blast open, regret rose in his heart. Then he was forced to watch his beloved Lily shielding her baby, before hearing the cruel words 'Avada Kedavra'. Seeing the light vanishing from her eyes, however, was not the worst part. The worst part, was an adult Harry Potter rising from the floor after he had caught the collapsing form of his dead mother. Fire burning in his green eyes, he stepped up to Severus, shouting at his face, "You killed her. It was all your fault." Then, cold, and uncharacteristically detached, he demanded, "Finish it!" Severus knew Lily's son to be right, it was all on him. Severus wanted to change the past, longed for it with his entire being, but he could not. When he looked down, he saw his own hand holding the wand, heard his own voice whispering the incantation, 'Avada Kedavra'. Then the boy's body fell down, right beside his mother, as if he had been but a puppet, whose strings Severus had cut.
"Mr Pince," she tilted her head, putting her hand delicately on his arm.
"No?"
"Why would you dread that?"
Grinding his teeth, Harry glared at the elderly wizard. "They are, still, I won't make the Lady Malfoy do something she has no desire for."
“Lucius Malfoy pledged his life, his skills and his powers to me when entering the Rite of Compulsory Surrender. He lost his Lordship the same moment, so it’s Mister Malfoy, until the day I decide to release him from my service. I, however, have no interest in a vassal so weak that he can’t follow even the simplest of orders because he is malnourished. Also, you will add cleaning supplies to the list and release the Malfoy’s house elves.”
"Harry?"
--O-O--
"Excuse me?"
Raising an eyebrow, the Lady Malfoy pointed out, "A moment ago, you offered help with our social standing. Now you demand autonomy. Would you like to elaborate?"
home seemed to always be at the heart of strange plots and secret gatherings. Not that Lucius or she could do anything about it. She was well aware that - though Harry had allowed her to choose - he was the one with the power over all of their assets, at least for the time being. Somehow, that made her feel a little better. If Harry Potter approved, surely nothing bad would happen. Right? At least this time their 'guests' planned to help and not destroy half of their society.
"May the gods save me from noble Gryffindors!" Severus prayed under his breath, massaging the bridge of his nose. "How detailed was your education on pureblood customs? I know Mr Longbottom has attempted to lecture you on the topic."
Harry's quiet voice held him back before he could even reach the door. "Yes?"
"Whatever." The raven-haired shrugged. "I have to go in today. Do you think you can manage?"
Smiling at the circle, Arthur clasped hands with Harry and Lucius. Both continued the gesture until the circle was closed by Molly and Narcissa. After a deep breath, the older wizard conjured memories of his parents and siblings standing side by side, recalling a time when his father had spoken these ancient prayers.
The former head of Slytherin routinely ignored the following wail. Honestly, house-elves and their dramatics. They had
"Ronald," looking at his youngest son, and the two friends that stood by his side, Arthur could not suppress the loving smile, when he noticed the protective stance of the two, covering his daughter-in-law. "The friends you have made in your first year at Hogwarts forced you to face the reality of our world long before your peers. Where other children had the luxury of spending their formative years fretting over grades, clothes or the latest gossip, you learned to survive trials, your greatest fear, treacherous animagi and Dark Lords. The proof that you have chosen said friends wisely, is them standing by your side, even after the war was won. "Common enemies bring people together. But only once the danger is passed, can we see who our true friends are. Not all the choices you have made in your life were smart. But those that mattered were true. So please, join Charlie and me tonight, with your growing family by your side."
"Harry, Draco, Neville and the rest of the lot."
"Depends. How much trouble am I in, either way?"
So, reluctantly, Harry had cleared out the owlery at Grimmauld Place, only to discover that Fox preferred to sleep in an old tree, at the edge of the property. Also, the blasted owl had the tendency to go hunting whenever the fancy struck. Sometimes he was gone for days on end, despite being fed regularly, leaving Harry – once again – with the need to use other owls to deliver his letters. No matter his origins, Fox was no ‘domesticated’ pet, so Harry had learned not to worry and to find alternatives to deliver his mail. In fact, he and Foxglove were more like roommates than owner and pet, and though Harry made sure that plenty of treats were available, whenever he needed Fox for a delivery, he sometimes had to wait.
"Griphook, you are Professor Snape's account manager?" Harry inquired surprised.
Since his rumbling stomach made any lie of not being hungry exceedingly unbelievable, Draco merely offered a death-glare before retreating to his desk, leaving the friends to make sense of his notes. He started to savour the delicious breakfast they had brought, grateful for the break and the chance to satisfy his empty stomach. Not that he would tell them that.
Reaching for another plate, the trio filled it with eggs, bacon, toast and a few slices of cut fruit Kreacher had forced on them, and a thermos full of Emerald's delicious coffee. It seemed that decorating the jars that contained the ingredients to their drinks had done the trick since while the white chamomile flowers still were her favourites, the colourful coffee plants Harry had glued to their coffee tin were a close second. She had also developed a strange liking for their spice-rack, and while most flavour-combinations she tried were still a little unusual, the majority tasted pretty good.
Not taking his eyes off the patient, the other nodded reluctantly. "Who knows?"
"Three powerful magical objects. Can you recall how their story ended?"
"On the contrary, Miss Greengrass," Narcissa contradicted, entering behind them. "Studying the terms of my and my son's house-arrest, you will find that there is no restriction on how many people can enter, just on who can't leave."
Since they all knew that an unbreakable vow did not work that way, the wizards only grinned before Charles and Harry clasped hands. Once it was over, they departed for the shack.
Harry merely shrugged, "That was all any of us could really hope for. But my point is, you had no way of knowing."
Studying the picture and then Lucius, the Lady shrugged. "I consider this quite accurate. A little muted perhaps. But I assume the muggle technology is to blame for that."
To be magical, with all your heart.
Knowing his wife, Ron shuddered briefly, "Well, best not to get in her way."
With a soft smile, Harry shared, "Actually, Hermione is incredibly proud of him."
"Seemed appropriate."
"I know you will," the young Auror smiled, before flooing them to the ministry.
Looking at her nephew, Andromeda took the offered tray. "Because you are family. No matter what you chose or were forced to do in His service, you are still family. Teddy has precious few people left that share his blood. It's insensate to cut someone out of his life, just because that person made mistakes in the past. Especially if he or she learned from them and changed their ways."
Wrapping his arms around his legs, the young wizard shook his head. "I don't know what I'm supposed to do."
He thought about the elf. How absent Kreacher had been these last few weeks, but not in the same way as before, where Harry could spot him doing his self-appointed tasks, muttering insults under his breath. These days he was simply gone, except mealtimes, since Molly providing them with food seemed to have hit a nerve. Harry had never particularly liked Kreacher, not with the way he had insulted his godfather at every turn. Nor had he disliked him, especially after the elf had started to take care of him after renovation. Kreacher was just … a constant in Harry's life. Like the painting of Walburga, or the continually creaking hinges of the entrance door. Determined to resolve this situation, the young wizard called out, "Kreacher!"
letting you go!" And then, after a few moments of breathless silence, the burning stopped, and she sagged against the table.
"How so?" The elderly witch asked, offering the requested vial.
Anchanee
"Draco and Lucius are missing," Harry shared tonelessly before Neville brought their fellow Gryffindor up to speed. As soon as their meagre findings had been shared, Ron stepped up to his best friend and hugged him. "We'll find them, mate. After everything we've been through, we won't allow a group of Death Eater Wannabes to harm your Malfoys."
--O-O--
That was the general consensus, until Pince whispered towards Potter, "What just happened? He is the Minister of Magic. He can get tickets to any game."
"Because Mr Potter requested me."
Aware of how difficult the young Inquisitor could have made his life these past few months, Harry was ready to agree, but slim fingers covered his mouth. Malfoy took over. "Since Potter never requested your help, only accepted what was freely offered, an argument can be made for him to provide services of equal value in return. However, no commitments of debts will be made."
Pondering that suggestion, Narcissa agreed, before nodding towards the two squabblers, "Would you, darling?"
"You haven't, and we both know that."
"So whenever I take it off, I have to make sure that nobody else puts it back on, or I won't be able to remove it?"
Raising her hand, Emilia started to count on her fingers, "Three months ago, you were in a coma. Since you woke you have left your bed, returned to a clear speech pattern, started to write legibly again and reclaimed your magic. Of course, your recovery was aided by the best potions available in your situation, but most patients, who were in a coma for more than a year, needed twice if not three times as long to accomplish that! And that, if they manage at all, which is in no way guaranteed!"
A good thing I’m not like them. I would sooner bite you than smile at you the way they all smile, full of wonder and
Then a snowball hit him in the back of the neck.
“I want to touch you,” whispered Harry on the exhale.
“Hey! What the hell, Pott—!”
!’), the recent potion he learned about in
Harry learned two things that evening: the brightest star in the Draco constellation was called Eltanin and Draco Malfoy talked a lot.
“You have nothing to worry about, Mr Potter, believe me,” McGonagall told him in her stern but unusually soft tone. She always spoke like that to Harry lately.
He tried to remember how he’d gotten here, but the only thing that came to mind was Malfoy tugging him along, not looking at him. Everything was a blur. He thought he remembered Pomfrey’s concerned face and her soothing words about some Calming Draft. Harry felt heavy now, ready to fall back asleep. He heard hushed voices nearby though, and concentrated on them.
Harry looked at Malfoy and saw him tear his gaze from Harry to look at Madam Pomfrey.
The nights repeated like that for some time.
Sometimes, he watched Malfoy in the Great Hall across the tables. Malfoy often looked back, frowning from time to time or scowlingor sneering for no reason, and Harry would grimace in return, feeling slightly better for some reason.
“This is all we have.”
And he was gone.
“It’s fine, I’ll give you both some then.” She paused, looking at Harry again. “Mr. Potter, you look confused. Any questions?”
He stared at the light spilling from the windows. Some dust was lazily flowing in it, as though stuck in honey. Harry watched and listened to Malfoy’s breathing. Floating particles danced slowly to Malfoy and back, disappearing as soon as they left the light. They were hesitant to get lost in his white tossed hair and steady breath, and Harry understood them just fine. It wasn’t any good to get tangled in another person. In Malfoy. The glowing particles, though, seemed to be drawn to him nonetheless. To him and back, and then again in slow floaty movements.
But the thing was, Harry felt inexplicably, strangely better than he’d felt in weeks. So many things were familiar here, so many faces and details and yet, for some reason, Malfoy raising his pointy chin and scowling at him across the Hall felt almost comforting in a way Ginny’s eyes next to him weren’t.
’ something ugly hissed in his head loudly.
Harry didn’t bother to go for the broom and uniform as he was already in the coat, and really, he could retrieve all that later. When he came to the usual place, Malfoy wasn’t there. Had he not come yet? Harry frowned, he just now realised they never agreed on anything, Malfoy just simply was here every time Harry came and that was it. Harry looked around.
"You're mine /;l#!" Draco replied in desperation, his eyes shining gold.
“It will rain soon. Wake up,” he said, smiling.
“At all?” she asked, perplexed, and motioned them to one of the beds.
And now Harry was hurrying to the library because Hermione wouldn’t be at all amused if he ended up late with all the essays they should write for tomorrow,
He shot a look at Harry and smirked softly to one side, right where the little line was. His eyes seemed even darker now, Harry never noticed them being this dark.
They were pathetic, both of them together. Must be quite a sight.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
Everything had fallen into a routine once classes started. Ron seemed like his old self most of the time. Sometimes, though, Harry noticed his thoughtful and distant looks or the gentle ones he directed at Hermione, or the slightly worried ones when he looked at Harry. They hadn’t been there before. Hermione tried to hold them together as hard as she could, acting excited and talking Harry into conversations. Harry smiled at her and Harry smiled at her because, even if her efforts did sometimes wear on his nerves, he was grateful for her efforts. He had good friends.
Malfoy opened his mouth to say something, then closed it. He looked up the corridor and then again at Harry for a second and again forwards.
Malfoy bit his lip (oh Harry really shouldn't look there) and ran a hand through his hair. Then that strange determination fell all over his features again.
On the bed next to his slept Draco Malfoy, just as light as everything else. He was breathing steadily, facing Harry on his side. His grey pyjamas and darker grey blanket contrasted against pale skin and almost white hair. Harry noticed the way his mouth was slack, open just a bit, and maybe he even drooled in his sleep. Harry tried to tell himself he found it disgusting.
Malfoy stood after a couple of seconds and there came a familiar tumbling into the bed. Then everything was quiet.
“Yes,” I nod. Then: “This is some surreal shit right here.”
Not a lot, Harry thought. From their year there were Zabini, a girl with dark hair Harry didn’t know, a boy which Harry vaguely recalled as Theodor Nott. And Malfoy, of course. He didn’t think it would be so hard even if he would be unlucky to get one of them as a roommate, there would be still a lot of his friends and people he knew around.
“Hey Ginny, where have you been?” asked Hermione.
Harry was relieved at that. But he remembered how apparently Malfoy had had many panic attacks and how he’d run out of the Calming Draft Madam Pomfrey gave him… And there Harry was, everyone going crazy with worry because of him while Malfoy didn’t have anyone to worry about him. He felt a little ashamed that he was so annoyed with his friends for fussing over him. How many students were there whose struggles went unnoticed? Harry felt sick.
"I'm really... The truth is—" He was seemingly fighting for the words, so quiet, but Harry felt them on his lips, somehow he didn't want to open his eyes just yet. "Oh, Harry."
“Maybe another day.”
What the hell was going on? Had Malfoy come here to steal a potion?
You taste like lightning and I’m so struck by you it isn’t funny anymore.
It was just strange, Harry tried to assure himself, it was just unusual to see, that’s all it was. He looked at the clock nervously. Less than ten minutes, and then he would go to the Pitch and not at all expect Malfoy to be nearby. Harry shook his head, earning a strange look from Ron.
And then he died. It wasn't empty all the way, but for a moment, a glimpse before he met Dumbledore and before he realized where he was, he caught the strange stillness and peacefulness of the white entity. He wondered what that place would become if he stayed. Would it change? Disappear? Blossom into the imitation of the living world? He thought he will discover it eventually.
Hermione blinked a few times. She then smiled with relief that Harry didn’t want to acknowledge was there.
As they prepared for the night an almost palpable tension hung in the air. Harry could tell Ron was confused and annoyed at the new revelations. Harry sent him a sheepish smile. Malfoy didn’t really look at Harry, he went out of the door and returned at the usual ungodly hour. Harry felt him hesitate near Harry’s bed (Harry never closed the curtains for the night, it was too dark that way). Harry heard him sigh so quietly Harry half-suspected the sound wasn’t real.
I drain another glass of bubbly champagne. It tastes mostly like nothing but it tries to make up for it with all the bubbles. I bet we’re similar like that.
. He was going to vomit.
The rage he felt earlier didn’t disappear, but now he wasn’t sure what to do. He didn’t think Malfoy would thank him for a trip to the Hospital Wing and raising questions from Madam Pomfrey. Harry suspected no one knew about this. Zabini didn’t seem worried earlier when Malfoy flinched from almost every movement. He was more than sure Malfoy would not like to find out Harry now was the exception. But when had Harry ever cared if Malfoy didn’t like something?
Harry went flying the very next day. It was Saturday, and by the early afternoon, he was restless and jittery. He wanted to find Malfoy again to ask him about anything really, he was bored out of his mind. Saturdays Ron and Hermione spent together at Hogsmeade, all eighth years were allowed to visit the village every weekend. At first, they suggested Harry go with them but it was clear they wanted to be together for a bit, so he always declined. Soon they stopped asking him.
They fell silent only when he died. It happened almost every night, except ones during that he didn't sleep. Dark silence enveloped him thoroughly and carefully, pushing on the ears and eyes, penetrating his mind through them. He welcomed it because then heavy 'I love you too' disappeared like sand through fingers slowly until nothing was left and he didn't have to say it anymore. There wasn't
“Yes.” Hermione seemed more collected. She glanced at Harry, frowning. “We’re just worried, Harry. You hadn’t talked much before and now…” She looked back at Madam Pomfrey. “Could it be an illness, Madam Pomfrey?”
He felt slightly sick of himself for lying about such small things to his friends just so he could then go and be alone for a bit. They would understand of course but he didn’t want for them to think he’s trying to get rid of them or anything. They already saw when he was disappearing without any excuse.
“We’ll see who’s laughing in the end, Potter,” he sneered and Harry laughed some more.
“Sorry, Harry, you okay?” she muttered after tucking the wand away. He frowned.
They have spoken about this many times. Draco could not remember where he was or what he was doing before falling asleep. When they tried to touch, Harry was waking up sharply and dizzy. Memories of a dream unfolding a second ago slipping through his fingers. And after a minute Harry couldn’t remember any words, events, or images. Only stole scratches of emotions swayed in the head, suffocating him in the middle of the night or the early morning. The day after that Harry always would be spent with something elusive deep in consciousness with a clear sense of wrongness. So they did not dare to touch.
Severus studied at his friend for a moment before replying evenly, "Yes, he did."
Squeezing his fingers, his partner promised, "I won't let you fall."
Chuckling incredulously, his 'servant' shook his head, glossing over how Harry's easy acceptance floored him. "I don't think that Astoria has any intentions of sharing my room."
"Really?" The former Divination teacher inquired. "Thinking back on a life as full of trials and tribulations as yours, would you really have considered it a blessing to know of the upcoming dangers up front?"
With a smile, Harry nodded. "Of course, she does, but Justin insists that all payments are covered in equal parts. He is very,
Grumbling, Snape challenged, "And will I get set hours as well? And if I don't exceed them, I get pudding in the evenings?"
"Help from the Aurors?"
Harry and Neville traded a mere glance, both thinking, 'Bullshit!' Still, they did not interrupt.
Chuckling, the raven-haired teased, "Did it hurt to say that?"
The young Auror's flinch was as good as imperceptible and he forced a grin, tidying over the moment. "I don't envy Lucius in that particular conversation."
"This is hardly a random potion," the shaggy haired wizard roared back. "And as far as I know, this is still my project! So, I will decide when we start with human testing."
At the encouraging nod from Harry, she approached the man and took his hands, before placing them gently on her belly. She could feel a tremor running through him, but he did not pull back. For several moments the former Death Eater did not say anything, just starred at the witch in wonder. He let out a startled laugh when the baby kicked again. Reverently, he shared, "The last child, the
The elf bowed, "Kreacher could."
Snickering, because no, Harry would never be part of the higher culture that thought about meals in fancy French terms, still he knocked on Draco's bedroom because the blond surely would. When no answer came, he peeked in, before turning towards the library. Sighing he hoped that his new room−mate slash servant would at least have used the couch for his nap, despite having little hope for it.
"I remember, …" Lily mumbled, lost in thought. "I always thought that he avoided me for doing too little, too late. And after a while … it just got too hard."
Sighing, Severus put his chin on her head. "He will certainly do everything in his power but putting the responsibility of three … four lives on him … that part of his life should be over. He's just a boy, Narcissa. It's wrong for people to constantly look to him to solve their problems."
"They should know better than to alter a wizard's core with the use of crystals! Their power is far too unpredictable, and most of the time, poisonous when ingested. Also, a squib's magic is spread too thin. Most likely the gems would find not enough of it to amplify it!"
After a few heartbeats, they let go and pulled out their wands, pointing them at the logs that had been stacked in the middle of the runic circle. "Transmutare Praedae."
"Harry doesn't do subterfuge," Draco mumbled absent−minded, already immersed in his work again.
With a sigh, Hermione sank back in the chair, rubbing the bridge her nose. "Honestly, I think it has happened already. Tom's pureblood propaganda paved the way for a two-class-society. From there it's just a short way to the annihilation of one class. I don't know if we have learned enough as a race to keep that from happening, but … but that's too much. We can't solve all problems of our society immediately. Let's start with teaching our children a better way and hope that … I don't know." She gestured helplessly. "Things will become better from then on."
"Yes!" Draco exclaimed, then shook his head, reverently browsing through the pages. "No, … it's complicated. I could brew some of these. Others I would have to work my way up to. But in here are recipes for potions like >The Draught of the Living Dead<. You can't give me access to such concoctions!"
--O-O--
"Or, … ahm, … I could stay here?"
"Wow," Harry exhaled explosively, sinking back on the carpet. "I feel like I have just become a father."
The witch sighed audibly. "I love Draco. You know, I do. But no matter how gifted he is, he is not a Potion Master."
"Yes, Master-Draco-Sir! Master-Draco-Sir must drink this now!" The strong smell of camomile tea made him smile weakly. Within moments, after consuming the tea, he felt better and gratefully accepted the sandwich the tiny elf … Ruby offered. After a few minutes he wanted to know, "Emerald, what are you doing here? Where is Harry?"
Brewing for money would generally be beneath a woman of her standing. However, in the stipulations of her house-arrest, was no restriction of her making money from home. It had not been necessary, since who would ever employ someone of her meagre skill-set? A witch without a wand was as good as useless. However, herbal remedies for pregnant women …
Remembering Stonehenge and how it had felt to travel along the ley-lines, their raven-haired friend snickered, "You have no idea."
"Kinky, trying to spice up your love life?" Daphne gestured at the leather outfit Hermione was wearing, that seemed to hide her pregnancy completely – no doubt an overpowered disillusionment charm.
Harry could understand the sentiment. Nobody would enjoy hearing that his godfather had been chosen for 'political' reasons.
The last thing Harry saw were the worried faces of Draco and Narcissa as he fled the room. All of a sudden, he felt like suffocating. He had to get out of there.
Smiling down at his boy, James Potter revealed, "We're an echo, nothing more. Yet more complete than we were the moment this painting was finished."
"Better. Now go for it. Fourteen minutes and counting."
It will come up later and might be a little confusing, but regrettably, I could not find a better word for what I meant.
A small voice, from behind, kept Severus from departing. "Are you the bogeyman?"
The Aurors had just reconvened in what seemed like an out-of-use office with boxes lining the walls when the first tendrils of smoke curled up from cracks between floor and wall.
When they reached the Round Table, Narcissa touched it with but the tips of her fingers awed at the ancient relic she had only heard about in stories and myths. Then she shook herself out of her reverence and turned towards the research that was neatly laid out before them. "May I," she requested, and at the confirmation of the librarians she started skimming over them.
Sheepish, Neville scratched the back of his neck. "She says it helps her to get into the spirit of the season."
Rearing, Harry stumbled back, but when Lucius reached for him, the young man wrenched his arm out of the pureblood's grip. "Don't touch me! Don't you dare touch me, Lucius Malfoy!"
"I'm so sorry, sweetheart," the redhead in the picture had mumbled, full of compassion.
That argument, however, was brushed away easily. "It's not as if I have a lot of need for it these days."
"You are not paying attention, Draco," Severus berated after lunch. "You have read the same para… sentence twice already."
"Professor Snape?"
"Yes, Master-Draco-Sir," the little elf beamed.
Nobody said a word until the door had fallen shut. Severus tried, but nothing came out. Thinking of something to say to someone he had not talked to in over twenty years was hard enough. But facing the memory, the impression of a soul that had seen him at his lowest, not once but twice was … where should he even start to redeem himself?
With a small smile, the brunet tilted his head. "So are you."
been extraordinarily helpful these last few weeks. So, it would be ill-conceived if she got hurt while we were closing this case."
Leaning beside the oven, the blond pondered. "I think Father is scared. Terrified every hour of every day, ever since Voldemort came back all these years ago. Also, the Rite does not exactly help with his emotional stability."
"Andromeda is still alive," Harry reminded her. "So is Teddy."
With barely suppressed amusement, Hermine had topped off his tea. "Do you wish for me to elaborate?"
Harry wore a dark-green robe of an elegant cut, trimmed with silver-grey that reflected the colour of his companion's eyes.
"Exactly where they belong."
"Really," Harry sneered. "That's not exactly the kind of conversation one wants to have."
"Me …," the girl startled, tilting her head. "Me does not know."
"Come again?" Head Auror Robarts asked incredulously, studying Pince and Potter, who sat relaxed in their chairs in front of his desk. Surprisingly, it was Alexander Pince who replied, "Considering the potential danger of a field-assignment, we think it prudent for Narcissa Malfoy to get her wand back."
"That was not our choice," his son mumbled, but his father brushed away the excuse. "It still happened in our home, so we will do our best to make it up to him. I have, as of now, no clue about how I can best serve him, but from now on, we will look to the future and thrive to become better men than we were in the past."
--O-O--
Exhaling defeated, Neville nodded and left.
The next day found Draco, dressed in his Sunday best, pacing in front of the Manor's fireplace. "What time is it?"
“I’m not sure if there are any blossoms left by which to identify the plant.”
Softly, Harry had recalled, "You added to the wards of Grimmauld Place. You strengthened them, made them believe that you had a vested interest in protecting those who call this place a sanctuary. In the process, you made this place your home. At least as far as the wards are concerned."
Gently, Astoria shook her head and offered a small smile, "No, I require a bedroom for my governess."
Looking at his mother in surprise, he nodded. "How do you know?"
For a minute, there was a standstill where the two wizards merely looked at each other, before Harry slowly lowered his wand and opened the passage, to reveal the unmoving form of one Severus Snape.
Grinning, Harry put their patient back into bed …
Reaching out, nearly over his son's messy hair, James admitted sheepishly, "Maybe a little. But it's true, nevertheless. And while we are grateful that you have given us this chance, it is time to end it."
So, while Harry went through the exercises, he shared everything that had happened today. He finished with, "He said 'Thank you', and I don't know if that even means anything to you because … well, because of everything that had happened. I just … it feels like something you should know." The young man shrugged somewhat uncomfortable, before pulling the comforter up and fixing it around the unmoving body. Gently he brushed the ever-present strand of black hair out of the man's face and whispered, "Good night, Sir," before leaving.
joining their club."
Harry cautiously approached his trembling vassal who was whispering to himself under his breath. "They'll be back soon. I can't let them take away memories of Draco or Narcissa. They are the only happy ones I have." Then, completely unrelated, "That cursed book! He deserved it being destroyed! Bringing an abomination like that into my home!" Another violent shiver. "Draco … my precious little boy …" Lucius flinched violently when Harry touched his shoulder. He curled tighter into himself, shielding his head.
'Someone' turned out to be a delivery−boy from 'Nott Fashion and Design'. Not that Lucius had ever heard of the company. When he returned to the kitchen with a big package, his liege merely encouraged, "You should go upstairs and open it. We have to leave in twenty."
Thinking for a moment, Harry concentrated on the snakes that decorated the stone wall and commanded,
Since this was not the first time something similar had happened to him, Harry was able to land on his feet. Thanks to his tight grip, the same was true for Draco. However, the moment the door fell shut, the blond violently pulled his arm away and zoned in on Harry. With force the Auror had not been prepared for, the blond hit him straight in the face. Since brawls were not that out of the ordinary, in his line of work, Harry did not falter. Regrettably, he could do nothing about the blood that started trickling down his nose; not even go and fetch a tissue, since Draco immediately started screaming at him. "What did you do? Everything was fine, and then he lost it … had a seizure or a panic attack or whatever. So, what the hell did you do to him, Potter?"
"Like with you and mum?" Harry sighed, "That love brought you nothing but pain. I saw your memories. How can you call that a blessing?"
To calm his agitated thrall, Harry put a hand on his arm, waiting out the tremors that seemed to continually run over Lucius' body. Maybe they should check him into the infirmary. Soothingly, he assured, "I know. It's alright, Lucius. I trust you."
−−O−O−−
"Declaring our mutual dislike," Emilia shared, turning towards the door. "I will be back in an hour."
member of the Malfoy family was making reparations under his care, he still snapped it shut when his team-leader threw him a warning look. They had agreed that Alexander would handle this and the raven-haired was too grateful for the unexpected support to put it at risk.
Neville and Luna, despite being covered in earth and leaves, had made a Domino's run. Since most of the pizzas had already been consumed, they now enjoyed squabbling over the remaining duck−balls. Harry and Ginny both had caught a majority, thanks to their seeker reflexes. Now the young man lounged, leaning back on his elbows, while Ginny had her head on his belly. Dipping the last piece of bread into the sauce, he offered her a bite, before demolishing the rest. Untangling the hair that had slipped out of her braid, he chuckled, "Not quite the way you thought your first, free Saturday in a month would go, I imagine."
"I am appalled," Severus interrupted, watching with disturbing intensity how Draco flinched at the reprimand. "Your ability to lie has become non-esis… existent. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
"What idea?"
Offering his hand to pick his friend up, the other indicated a bow. "I aim to please."
"So, she might not even have been a target."
Chuckling, Harry indicated a bow. "As you wish, your highness."
"And so Death took the second brother for his own," the redhead finished for him. "You know the entire tale by heart, don't you?"
A near overwhelming magical force appeared out of nowhere, and while the cultists cried out for their goddess' protection, the Aurors realised that they would have no chance of winning if people started attacking them from within
"He's right, though," the raven-haired looked back at his tenant. "You are a bastard."
"Draco!"
--O-O--
Meeting Draco's gaze without hesitation - this conversation was long since overdue - the Saviour-of-the-Wizarding-World explained, "An object in which a person conceals a part of their soul. They split it through murder, to hide a part of it outside of their body."
Stabilising his spine with a hand at the small of his back, the witch threatened, "I can cast a body binder. You are aware of that."
"I know what you have thought!" Harry interrupted with forced calm. "And I could not be any less inclined to discuss it with you. You entered the Rite of Compulsory Surrender with me, and though I am aware that everything is better than receiving the Dementor's Kiss, I would suggest you take your time to review what you know of me and my actions towards your family." Pulling a sheet of paper out of a drawer, Harry jotted down a few things before throwing the paper at Lucius' feet, well, knees in this case.
"New traditions, professor?" Harry inquired when accompanying the Headmistress out.
Once Harry and Draco were alone, the young wizard looked at his companion. Quietly, the blond admitted, "We were … concerned." His pale face and jittery movements proved his frazzled nerves.
Lucius was doing an admirable job defending his client while Hermione Granger picked apart his alibi bit by bit. Nothing was safe from the muggleborn witch as she presented footage from muggle security cameras from all over London, along with eyewitness accounts who had spotted Lostrife when he had gone about his illegal business. All in all, the evidence was damning, and there was no doubt in Harry's mind that they would be able to lock the bastard away for good. Incidentally, he was so concentrated about his friend and thrall, that he did not notice his superior slipping into the courtroom. His wand was already in his hand when Robarts startled him, "Potter, we need you."
"Severus' things! This is his furniture from Hogwarts! How on earth …?"
Allowing himself a small smile, Harry had nodded. "I would even go so far as to call myself a parsel-mage."

Shaking his head, the child took a deep breath and held out the pendant to Draco. "I want you to have this. I made it for Harry, but now I want to give it to you. So, you aren't sad because of your horses anymore."
"I could …" Draco piped up from outside the door, but his words were cut off by a flicker of Snape's wand. Yet, instead of explaining himself, the wizard merely repeated, "You are not my caretaker."
Since it was uncommon for the Potion Master to request Harry's attention, mostly he just commandeered it, he turned towards him. "Of course."
--O-O--
Anchanee
Briefly glancing at his Potion Master, then at the picture, Neville indicated a bow, before following his partner. "I want one with raisins; not these horrible candied orange peels that taste like rubber."
I know that the way Lucius is allowed to redeem himself is a source of conflict for many of you readers. My original Summary of the story indicated Harry to be a lot more vicious and vindictive than I am portraying him. However, Sententia is about making choices, choices of letting go of the past, choices of working towards a better, brighter future where you are not weighted down by hatred and vengeance, basically it is everything Voldemort was not. For those of you who are waiting for the 'other shoe to drop' on the Malfoys, better stop reading because while there will be conflict in this story, they won't return to Azkaban or 'get what they deserve'. I wanted to make things better and not let prejudice and anger stand in the way.
"Of course I'd believe you because you have never done anything of such, huh," Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy tsked in response.
"A word?" Malfoy's tone was cold and slow as though he talked to an infant. But it sent a shiver down Harry's spine nonetheless. He wasn't used to hearing it. His mind unhelpfully recalled the way Malfoy had said 'I hate you' in his dream earlier.
Harry glanced at the Slytherin table.
The next time he woke up it was night. He sat up in the bed, swallowing as much air as he could and trying to erase the images of the nightmare from his mind. The spilling blood and the suffocating darkness of the passageway, scared screams of his mother pleading for him, the shut door of the cupboard under the stairs… Harry pulled his knees up to the chest, swaying a little and concentrating on breathing.
Malfoy was looking at him strangely. Harry couldn’t decide what the expression was and hurried to fix his stupid out of nowhere suggestion.
He nodded. That was much better than speaking. She appeared satisfied and nodded in return.
He didn’t answer. Malfoy waited for a bit, as if hoping for Harry to rise the bait, and then rolled his eyes, holding his wand to him. Harry took it. It was probably the closest he’ll get to gratitude from Malfoy.
“Didn’t know you’re such a gentle thing.”
He was ‘Draco’ now for Harry as well, had been for a while and Harry hadn’t even noticed.
Harry watched an empty seat at the Slytherin table for the whole duration of lunch, something tight in the pit of his stomach.
Harry nodded. Vague anxiety stirred in his chest, he was constantly thinking these days that he was going to be late. He wondered how it far the Ministry would be from here if he took a taxi?
After a bit, there it is. That small chuckle. If I only knew that was an option— talking to you like that — I would’ve never traded that for the attention of my classmates I didn’t care about.
Harry sympathy rising to his throat. He realised at that moment that Draco was living in the same home as Voldemort. He raised his hand slowly, Malfoy tracking his movement warily, then Harry covered the shaking grip. Malfoy froze, staring at their hands.
Harry’s mind became as peaceful as the quiet snowfall enveloping him, full of little things that didn’t make an impact and seemed to melt under his breath.
“Harry, Malfoy told us where to look and… We’re so sorry you saw that.” Tears swelled in her eyes and Harry felt something snap closed in his chest. He didn’t want to hear about it or see it ever again. He couldn’t stand to see Hermione’s tears. He looked away.
When he emerged from the changing rooms with his beloved broom in hand, everything around was covered in the white blanket. This refreshed the previous layer of snow and made Harry’s eyes water because of the brightness. The Pitch was blissfully empty. Harry mounted and took off from the ground.
Malfoy snorted, apparently amused at the sight of him, stuttering through apologies. Harry couldn’t entirely blame him.
"See you all later," he didn't want to wait for their expressions of confusion, so he just turned away towards Malfoy again. The moment Harry was on his feet, the blonde strode to the exit from the Hall, not waiting for him to follow. Harry's heart picked up the speed the same way as his feet did to keep up.
,” he looked pointedly at Harry, “didn’t bother to return my old wand, I, what, would go to Ollivander’s and buy myself a nice new one and all would be lovely? Well, too bad, the fucking Ministry gave me this useless piece of wood with tracking charms and all because they didn’t want a little
flying.”
“Why didn't you came earlier?” Harry observed one strand of the blond hair lightly falling on the Draco’s cheek.
The classroom was empty. The windows were boarded up and little light reached the dusty tables. In the deep shadows of the corners, Harry could see there was nothing except for a few old cabinets, half-broken and loaded with glass jars. He didn’t like this room.
“I love it when it rains.” Harry didn’t.
Of course, he became more beloved by everyone than ever when he returned to Hogwarts. He knew what would happen but he didn’t. Students loved him (except some Slytherins, of course, but that was expected), even some teachers weren’t hiding their fondness very well. And soon Harry started to feel sick of it, of the constant attention and pressure. Nobody pushed him but there was always some whispering around, following like a cloud. And then he flew away from it.
The snowfall wasn’t bad, but it was dark, as they came here only after their lessons. Malfoy cast some charm on the snow so that they could sit on it without falling through. Harry’s Firebolt was at his right arm. It was rather awkward for him to always hover in place because Malfoy never took a broom and Harry didn’t ask again if they could fly. He was beginning to enjoy these short meetings even without flying. As it appeared, watching snow was rather calming.
"I can't. We can't," he said miserably. The red and orange light was so bright and warm.
Harry hesitated, opened his mouth to say something but didn’t. He turned and went for the door, looking back at the threshold. He had trouble seeing Malfoy, as he was taking the light with him but he was sure Malfoy wasn’t looking after him. Harry turned and left, leaving the door open for some light from the torches.
My head hurts because of that, because of everything, I hate this place, these people. I used to love ball nights as a child, you know? It fit me, everyone looked at me with smiles and attention I so craved. And the worst thing is, you see: I still want it, want for everyone to look at me with fake smiles and adoration. People change their assumptions about you quickly and now I’m not in their mercy.
You stare as if you have no idea what I’m talking about, too. Then you look around slowly, the crowd around us started to resemble a circle of a proper audience now. Without looking at me you say:
You don’t look at me and you look amazing. All windswept hair getting in your eyes, warm-looking skin just above the collar of the black robes, your jaw set and angular lines of your profile, Merlin, I could go on and on. I hate you for how negligently good you look.
It was the wrong thing to say. Ron was dealing with his own crisis and it was hard to blame him. All of the Weasleys were mourning after Fred still, and Ron wasn’t taking it easy. He spent a lot of time with his family, trying to figure out the new painful way of living. A lump still formed in Harry’s throat every time he thought of Fred. But he didn’t dare to come to Weasleys. He knew he didn’t really belong there, at least for the time being. Hermione felt the same, he was sure of it, even if they hadn’t talked about it.
“Potter,” I answer, harsh as ever as if I’m 13-year-old twat again. Well, maybe not that bad.
Malfoy grimaced and kept quiet for a while. It was obvious he didn’t want to talk about it and Harry felt awkward for asking. He of all people should have to understand a person who didn’t want to talk about something personal, for god’s sake.
Harry complied, feeling a touch awkward. She settled in her chair and took some papers lying there, quickly skimming them. Then Mrs Wright raised her eyes to him and smiled, slightly more professional this time, and there weren’t wrinkles around her eyes.
The classroom was even darker than the hallway. But a dim blue light glowed in the corner, suggesting Lumos. Harry couldn’t see clearly who it was but at least now he could hear more clearly.
We stand on the balcony for a minute, staring at the dark garden spreading below. Warm yellow light from the party washing our backs, muffled noise of conversations feels so very far away. This balcony is a place in-between two real worlds, not quite in either of them. I glance at you and think “
"You really, really shouldn't." He bit out so desperately, Harry opened his eyes to look at him. "And I'm so sorry."
“Sure,” he said and turned away to the forest.
“Fuck, fuck,” Malfoy muttered under his breath.
Hot hands went for his hair and Harry found a moment to realize that he’d always imagined them to be cold but they weren’t. Teeth closed on his bottom lip and Harry made a little sound he didn't know he was capable of making.
“Harry— You, you’re not cursed are you?” she asked suddenly, quiet and still not looking at him. At Harry’s other side, Ron listened intently. Harry blinked a few times and shook his head, looking at each of them in turn. Ron was frowning suspiciously and Hermione’s eyes were desperate.
Draco looked at him and relaxed slightly. A comfortable silence hung between them for a while, broken only by the distant noise of the river and the clatter of the invisible dial. The sun was pleasantly warming the left side of Harry, for some reason it seemed selected from a certain memory.
Of course it was Malfoy. Because it was Harry’s life, how could it not be him? At least Ron would still be with him Although, Ron didn’t seem really happy about it. He moaned loudly and broke into an angry tirade about his luck and damned blond gits. Harry couldn’t help but feel better at that; at this pace, Ron would soon be his old self again. They would be sharing their room with Neville and a Hufflepuff, Wayne Hopkins, with whom Harry never spoke before.
Harry sat for some time, trying to calm down. Eventually, he laid down and stared at the ceiling. There was no breathing of his roommates, no sound of Ron tossing in bed and Neville’s occasional muttering. Harry realised with a pang that no matter how long he would lay here with open eyes, there would be no door opening, no Malfoy coming quietly into the room and going straight for his bed. Harry instantly felt agitated.
“Malfoy,” Harry called, trying how far gone he was. Malfoy didn’t budge. “Right…” Harry mumbled, reaching out in an attempt to change his position (he couldn’t just levitate the git in this awkward pose all the way to the Hospital, could he). But as soon as he touched one bony wrist, something shot up his nerves like a small electric shock and Malfoy flinched, opening his eyes and breathing in suddenly. Harry pulled back in surprise.
,’ Harry thought absentmindedly,
“Do you need something, Ferret, or gonna finally fuck off?”
It was cruel, asking them to return, but he was strong. He was strong. Strong.
The sky was turning a blue-grey shade now, cold and low above their heads but Harry wasn’t hurrying back to the castle.
“You know, it’s not that bad that you don’t talk,” he said. Harry realised he was referring to what Ron had said to Harry the previous evening.
“Why not? I’ve cast them, you know, plenty—” Malfoy’s sneering voice broke off, and Harry’s wand shook badly in his hand.
Eventually, Malfoy stood and moved to the bed closest to Harry’s, lowering himself onto it. Harry half watched him close his eyes, feeling a displaced longing to touch tingling in his fingertips. He realised how tired he was.
As he exited the Great Hall, he let his legs carry him wherever they felt like. He didn’t care if he missed Potions. Slughorn would probably forgive him, as he seemed to have taken his fondness for Harry this year to a whole new level. So far he hadn’t had much trouble in classes, most professors were giving him some time as well and hadn’t questioned his silence. But McGonagall’s look told him the leniency wouldn't last forever. His throat constricted again and he walked faster.
“I—“ you say just to not continue.
“This essay is important, Harry, are you sure you will finish it in time? Do you need my notes?” Hermione seemed alarmed.
Their eyes met, and Harry held his breath as he looked into those stormy orbs. Thunder again snapped from above, the wind intensified, lifting grass and fallen leaves into the air. The trees trembled furiously with branches, dropping the rapidly yellowing foliage. The glade was gradually losing life. Harry raised his hand and held it to Draco without touching. In response, he raised his, slightly trembling, to Harry's palm. They seemed to be on both sides of the mirror like this, copying the gesture. Harry didn't feel the heat of the skin. His heart swam with resentment and the desire to just touch and feel another living person.
For example, what do you do with that stare of yours? Looking at me like that from across the room full of people. Me looking back is purely incidental because I wouldn’t like for you to set my neck on fire with that stare would I be turned away.
They walked for a while in silence and the chilly weather. Draco stopped abruptly with a curious expression on his face. Harry stopped as well, glancing at him in question.
“I’m Muggleborn, you see, I always was interested in Psychology. For some time I lived mostly in the Muggle world, although I always loved magic.” Harry couldn’t help but understand what she meant. He glanced at all the things still arranging themselves around the room.
Harry blinked at the question but didn’t have time to answer.
“…more time. It’s the best you can do, more time and patience and everything will be fine.” She smiled reassuringly at them and Hermione nodded violently. Harry felt a wave of affection for her. Ron looked just as serious and determined.
“Potter, you’re a star.”
Harry went down the main stairs, managing not to get the ones that felt like moving today, and rounded a corner. He got to the tapestry with a dreary Scotland landscape and moved it to the side the way he vaguely remembered it.
“Of course, ‘Mione, I’ll be just fine.” He met her gaze stubbornly, crossing his arms over his chest.
Malfoy shifted and a cloud of breath curled from his mouth, melting slowly in the air, weightless. Something strange constructed in Harry’s chest, heavy and sharp but sweet and vaguely familiar. He turned and flew a bit faster than was necessary.
Harry smiled to himself. He thought of finding a passageway he’d used a few times as a shortcut. Some students passed in the corridors, greeting him. Harry nodded to them absentmindedly. He turned in the direction of the passageway. Its entrance was on the second floor behind a tapestry and led to the first floor with a narrow staircase. It wasn’t really popular but could be handy when one needed to get to the library fast.
Harry stared. He hadn’t even realized that was a thing. He felt vaguely ashamed that the thought of returning the hawthorn wand hadn’t even crossed his mind. He gave it to the Ministry for safekeeping without a second thought, since he already had his own wand and all. More than anything, he didn’t expect this revelation from Malfoy at all. And judging by the faintly terrified look on his pale face, Malfoy didn’t either.
.” Draco said flatly and clearly unimpressed, peering into the distant shadows between the huge oak trees with trunks that Harry couldn't get arms around completely no matter how he’d try.
You grimace and chuckle and kiss me again.
,” she raised her voice a bit at the end as she usually did when explaining something painfully obvious.
“Please don’t. It will rain, you’ll see.”
“How’d
After longer than necessary and absolutely not enough time in Harry’s opinion, Malfoy pulled back and, taking Harry’s arm, pulled him in the direction of the Hospital wing. Malfoy didn’t look at him once all the way down.
Ginny was talking about the next Quidditch game against Ravenclaws or something, Harry wasn't listening. His attention wasn't needed anyway, because Ron was engaged in the chat so much that it could compensate Harry's and Hermione's absence. It was nearly time to go.
Harry gaped at her for a second. Muggle Psychology? He remembered a talk about stitches from ages ago when they first visited Mr Weasley in St Mungo’s in his fifth year. Was muggle medicine more wide-spread than he knew?
“Okay, if you say so, Harry,” he said. Then looked at Malfoy with narrowed eyes. “Don’t expect any gratitude from me, though, Ferret.”
“We’ll… we understand if you don’t want to talk about it,” she told him, glancing at Ron, who nodded. “Want to go to breakfast?”
“Aren’t you cold?” He blurted out, raising his gaze to Malfoy’s face.
“Yes, indeed,” she laughed a little and Harry decided he liked her. “Okay now that you know a bit about me, let’s begin.”
like myself walking the halls of this lovely school armed, you see. So yes, my fucking wand is in the dorm because it’s
“You’re not so quiet on a broom as you think you are,” he said, unimpressed, “following me, are you?”
Ron frowned but hid his wand in the pocket and nodded, still looking a bit suspicious.
You just laugh and laugh and I think I’m fucked. I sneak a glance at you and then you’re looking at me as well and I feel like smiling, your grin is so contagious.
"I hate you," Malfoy said very quietly and somehow desperately, "I really do."
“…didn’t do anything to him, I know. But,
Someone slammed into his shoulder after he turned the corner and Harry stumbled back in his way. When he regained his balance he looked up. And blinked a few times at Malfoy, who was blinking in return, looking surprised, but it didn’t last long and after a second a familiar scowl was in place. Harry almost sighed.
After some fighting, they finally settled in the snow, breathing hard and unable to keep smiles off their faces. Malfoy cast his warming charm at himself and then at Harry without a thought, not even looking at him, and the warm wave rolled through Harry. When Malfoy looked up in the snow there was a second wave that had nothing to do with warming charms.
Harry looked into the flames dancing in the fireplace. Why? He didn’t know why.
The Hogwarts Express released its first blasting whistle along with a billow of steam. It was comfortingly familiar, one of the first truly magical moments of Harry's life. He closed his eyes as the sound died out. Hermione liked to say that it was a second chance, a new beginning. Harry felt like he might throw up from thoughts of Hogwarts; he remembered all too well the exploding hallways and the Great Hall full of bodies that he couldn't save.
"Malfoy! What the fuck are you on about?!" Harry took a step further without realizing until the moment those grey eyes shot to his with visible distress written all over them. He didn't understand anything.
“Has something happened?” she asked, as professional as ever.
“What curse are you thinking of?” Harry wanted to know. “An Unforgivable?”
“Well, dragons don’t talk, do they,” he said and Harry looked at him pointedly. Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, well, okay I do. But you can be one as well, if you want. With the condition that I’d be a cooler one of course. I’ll speak with fire.” He hissed threateningly and Harry snorted again.
Snowflakes hit his face in quick, cold little bites and his glasses soon were covered in water drops. He slowed the broom a little and cast Impervius absentmindedly. The world became clearer and Harry took a second to look up at the sky. The usually invisible air was filled with snowflakes, lazily flowing towards the ground. All this air, waiting to be flown in. Harry smiled and aimed the Firebolt up, speeding in quick succession. A feeling similar to the one of falling tugged at his guts and then transformed into excitement. Harry was free to go in any direction he pleased, just turn the handle. That was familiar and dear to him, the only time when he really could let go of the concerns, fears and thoughts as a whole.
Harry rolled his eyes at that but stepped away, glancing at Draco. He was watching Harry with an unreadable expression. Something akin to…wonder? He didn’t pay Ron any attention. Harry felt strangely flustered and looked away.
With a last glance at McGonagall, he went inside, looking around. The room was well-lit and broad, done in woody colours. There was a big desk with two chairs opposite each other. Some things were floating out of bags and finding a right place to settle.
Harry opened the door, and they immediately turned to him. Ron’s wand was in his hand and Malfoy had a look of cold fury melting into surprise when he looked at Harry. Ron’s expression flicked with concern but he didn’t lower his wand.
“Hermione, I—“ He didn’t really know what to say, he never did these days. He sighed. “It’s okay. How’s Ron?”
,’ something whispered in his head.
“Do you wanna join us? I bet you’d like to add a couple of punches at this—”
Malfoy obviously needed some help, even if not from Harry. He was shaking faintly and looking like he might stumble to the ground at any moment. Harry wanted to say that there were no desks to hold on to in the hallways on the way to their dorm. He didn’t.
Malfoy was laying in the snow with his hands thrown open. Harry vaguely thought that that must be cold as hell but Malfoy didn’t seem to think that. Snowflakes seemed to melt fast on his slightly pink cheeks, Harry even could see snow on his eyelashes if he could fly a bit nearer…
Harry held on to him, Malfoy surprisingly steady on his feet. He was so warm. And Harry was freezing. Malfoy’s hands tightened around him. And it felt just like the hug from Mrs. Weasley after the night Cedric had died. It felt so good to feel someone so close and take a bit of comfort from them. Harry inhaled shakily and recognised that smell from days before. Clean and sharp and mostly
He made his way out and into the cool evening air. The sun was just beginning to set and the sky was slightly pink on the west side. He breathed deeply and went out onto the grounds that were mostly deserted at this hour.
They were going from the DADA down to the Great Hall for lunch, Ron chatting away to Hermione about the lesson and how hungry he was, when Harry noticed an open classroom. It was one of the abandoned ones, judging by the dusty door and a dim light that was visible just so through the gap in the door. Harry paused. After a couple of steps Ron stopped mid-sentence and looked back, frowning.
Harry hummed in response. “Figured it wasn’t the day either.”
She nodded, a little hesitant, but then nodded again and smiled a little, coming to hug him fast and tight. He hugged her back with real gratitude this time. The vaguely fruit smell of her hair in his face was reassuring as always, and dearly familiar.
The person entered silently and closed the doors, stepping jerkily farther in. Soon they stepped under the patch of moonlight and Harry opened his eyes wide in surprise. It was Malfoy. His sleep tousled hair gleamed in the blue light, he wore a grey set of pyjamas with a thin dark blanket over his bony shoulders. His face was a little feverish and eyes searching. He seemed not to notice that Harry was awake.
And this part was the best. Or maybe it was not, Harry could never say for sure, couldn't he? There was nothing to describe, to feel or comprehend. And this was what Harry liked. For some time there wasn't anything left, not even the self-consciousness. And that was beautiful.
Malfoy was saying something but Harry couldn’t understand. Then Malfoy grasped his hand and Harry felt a faint shock going through his fingertips. He realised he was clutching his wand so hard it hurt. Pity he didn’t care much.
Malfoy snorted humourlessly, nodded and didn’t answer. After a minute Harry asked something he wanted for a while now.
"What the fuck did you do, Malfoy?" Harry whispered, Draco flinched and something like panic flicked on his face for a moment, disappearing instantly under the familiar frown, "I mean, when you—" For some reason, Harry wanted to explain, "When you tugged my hair, that felt... Familiar."
Harry himself didn’t know how to feel about Malfoy in their room. He wasn’t as angry as Ron was, that was for sure. He could say he didn’t really care that much but… Harry shook his head, he wasn’t going to think about it. He stopped on the thought that he just didn’t like Malfoy still and that was it. They were climbing up the stairs, Ron still muttering to himself.
"Well, yeah, but I like you more," Draco said with force, "If you couldn't already tell, you idiot."
The collective exhales of the Malfoy family made the golden trio snicker before they returned their attention towards the elf, who had used the distraction to inch closer to the door. Sitting up, Harry put himself at the same height as his servant when he asked, "What am I, Kreacher?"
When the boy hovered, his godfather nudged him along, reminding him, "And I said Kreacher, not Emerald!"
The next morning found Harry, once again, curled up on Snape's bed. The man's hand lay gently on his head. Infinitely grateful that their patient was still fast asleep - a magical induced coma seemed to be tiring business - the young wizard tiptoed out of the room, closing the door after himself ever so gently, before running head-first into Draco.
Still, people would look down on the Malfoy family for years, maybe even decades to come and Harry did not want to make things harder on Draco, Astoria and their potential child by … just no. That wasn't right.
The elf beamed at the excessive order and started to bustle at the oven at once, with ingredients flowing in from the pantry.
Whipping around, the goblin studied him with narrow eyes. "In that case, you will, of course, let me analyse your spell!"
"Harry," Narcissa sighed quietly, "This is a beautiful piece of jewellery, and I am honoured by the present. But it is not appropriate for you to gift me a ring."
Closing his hand around Severus' fingers, Harry whispered, once more stubbornly not looking the man in the eye. "I don't want you to feel uncomfortable in your own home. I … I don't want you to leave."
Popping the sweet into the napkin, Ron provided, Harry, shrugged. After another hick, he pondered, “Maybe something I ate?”
Understanding dawned in the pale, blue eyes. The witch pulled up her hood again and indicated a bow upon rising. "I'll get back to you." Then she left.
"They told you …" the man had tapered off, closing his eyes against the humiliating thought of this former pupil learning about him panicking on the staircase.
"We tried that already," he heard Hermione mumble.
"Yes, with potatoes."
--O-O--
Hick!
"After You- … Voldemort returned, it was just mother, father and I light the candles in my parents' bedroom. We used to pray:
Caressing her small baby-bump, something she hid at work but showed off at home, the young witch nodded. "My department-head always was a stickler for justice. As long as Lucius plays by the rules, he is willing to accept his help. Not everything is black and white. Barrister Thomson knows that."
"Oi," now the young wizard glared. A little. "I've had other partners before Neville and did just fine!"
Outlook for Chapter 23:
Snape felt a shiver running down his spine at the hard tone of the Auror but valiantly fought it down. Instead, he rose and offered his hand. "Very well. Then, have a good evening, Auror Longbottom. And give my best to your fiancée." At a raised eyebrow from the young wizard, Snape hesitated for a heartbeat, before confirming, "Somehow I imagine my re… resurrection won't be as much … of a surprise for Miss Lovegood as it was for you."
Laughing, the raven-haired shoved the other. "So, how do wizards do it?"
"Because you ordered me to have breakfast?" The young man replied, confused.
Metal
"It's quite alright, Harry," the young witch interrupted with a kind smile. "I appreciate the offer, but I can assure you that it is not necessary."
The deep, dreamless sleep always tasted like death to him.
"Yeah sure," he mirrored Harry's posture, crossing his arms. "I really hate you."
Someone on the receiving end snorted, and Harry shivered with a guess.
There was darkness in the corners of the room, the same as under his closed eyes. He tried to look at the moonlit parts, the luminescent squares of blue falling from the big windows. It was unmoving and cool.
“I think the school will absolutely need a mind healer this year, just for some therapy. It's always a good thing, you know, Harry?”
“Sorry,” Harry almost smiled at how Malfoy seemed to lose all the spite in favour of surprise. Then he frowned and seemed to collect himself again.
“Do you know why I like snow so much?” Malfoy asked suddenly.
“I was watching you first,” then he moved forwards and Harry felt a warm press of lips to his mouth.
exactly.
"Really? Why didn't you tell me?" Harry's heart swam.
Malfoy didn’t stop to frown and looked around them. The forest nearby was still sinking in shadows, and Harry only now noticed that the sunny day was only within the clearing, while the grey sky hung low above the trees. Everything now was almost perfectly quiet, the leaves trembled in the crowns, but the sound was not reaching the only visitors of the forest. A gentle breeze was wondering through a clearing that Harry didn’t feel, but saw the stir of the grass and light moving of the platinum hair of Draco.
Harry really didn’t mind. He supposed he should have found it annoying, as Malfoy didn’t have the nicest voice, he sometimes got so excited his voice went pitchy, he loved bad impressions (Harry told himself he didn’t find them funny, not one bit) and he had a very high opinion of himself but… He hadn’t insulted the people Harry cared about for some reason, hadn’t insulted anyone much for that matter. He just, well, talked about details and things that didn’t really matter. And of himself, of course.
Best, sweet, dangerous, forbidden and desirable. So, so needed, it hurt. It would never be his. Never could and never will. The golden light of the sunset cut his closing eyes, looking disappointed in him the way his best friends were. He closed his eyes anyway because Malfoy was kissing him still.
All too soon he rounded the corner and found himself in the right hallway. He waved his wand to silence his steps and moved farther. The door wasn’t open this time and Harry felt a bit disappointed. He stood in front of it. He wished he had the Extendable Ears with him as he movedto lean his not so extendable one to the door. He waited for a bit and then heard something again.
“Oh, Harry—“
"C'mon, Harry, let's go find an empty compartment." He didn't smile and Harry thought he otherwise would have.
Harry wanted to ask if she was okay, but the now familiar tightness of his throat that appeared every time he thought about speaking wouldn’t let him. He frowned and nodded.
“I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good,” he said and touched it with the tip of his wand.
“Most certainly, thank you!” Mrs Wright answered and opened the door wider to let Harry come in.
You’re the centre of the night, of the world. Would you just shut up, I’m tired of that story. I’m looking, see?
Harry smiled a little, more to reassure her than because he wanted to. Guilt flamed to life in his stomach. He couldn’t even smile properly to his best friend who’d been worrying about him.
Putting a comforting hand on his brother's shoulder, Bill pondered, "Wait a second …" Inspecting the whimpering Auror, the curse-breaker inquired sharply after a few moments, "Harry, where is the rune of deflection?"
"You don't plan to forgive him," the young wizard stated harshly.
Slowly, Harry crowded the older man into a corner. His wand was now hovering a hair’s width from the white-haired’s throat, steady and unwavering.
Children were most precious, especially to a pure-blood like Draco. With most Ancient and Noble Houses struggling for even one heir, due to inbreeding, it was unthinkable for a Malfoy to put an unborn child at risk. While the Weasleys were a fertile bunch, surely at least Ron would know that.
"I know it might be hard without your wand, but you have great instincts for artefacts. If nothing else, you could at least compile a list of books with but a one-sentence description, so I have a general idea of my available resources."
"Draco!" Severus bellowed, barely able to keep himself from reaching for his throat when it burned up at his outburst.
Rolling his eyes, Draco revealed. "It's the exact same thing we say. The language is just different. It's all about really wanting it, remember? You just have to believe for it to come true. Like with your hair. It is as easy as that."
"I adapted the antidote, especially to his needs. Harry was right. Nothing St. Mungos has to offer would work as well."
And then Severus realised that this was not an act; a show the young Auror put on to appear contrite. All of a sudden, all thought of revelling in the boy's … young man's discomfort felt unbelievably petty. "Harry," he demanded calmly, "Look at me."
Maybe they were not strong enough, but she was not willing to give up yet.
With a deep sigh, the older Auror massaged the bridge of his nose, mumbling, “I hate you so much right now, Potter.”
When Harry gestured towards the door, the shaggy-haired wizard winked.
"Not former," Lucius corrected quietly.
"What's a soap opera?" Manson wanted to know, stealing some of the popcorn.
"I have a godmother," Harry breathed in amazement.
Having seen his promised monthly visits to the cottage slip through his fingers, Teddy studied the description again. "No," he admitted after a while.
"I woke. Now, please answer the question. How often did you inhale the pollen of this plant!"
Unwilling to open his eyes, he curled up in his chair. It would be morning soon, and he had to go to work. Just a few more minutes of peace and quiet, and he would be able to face the world again.
It was … there was not really a word for it. The magic here was dark, covering everything like a blanket. Harry understood that on the same level that he knew that the sun was rising in the east. But there was no threat. He watched mothers cast stinging hexes on their children when they misbehaved and men to use charms to help the flowers grow. The air was filled with the scent of their magic, and everything was saturated with their power. Being guided towards the temple, Harry had not realised what was going on, too fascinated by everything around him. But when he was surrounded by seven priests, standing in the middle of a circle, he grew weary and grabbed his wand tighter. But instead of overwhelming him, the men stepped up to him, and each and every one of them drew a part of a symbol on his forehead, using their blood for paint. They barely needed five minutes and the more they completed, the better idea Harry got what this was all about. Once the last one was finished, and an incantation was sung, the British wizard understood. Harry did not actually get the words, but he could gather the meaning. Making conversation possible. As soon as the Brit grasped that, questions poured out of his mouth and with a joyous laugh, one of the priests pulled him along and started explaining.
No! The boy-who-lived had always been too good at heart. But then, he
"Really?" Kingsley seemed surprised. "I was under the impression that the relationship between Mrs Greengrass and Regina Charlton has been more or less stable for the past two years."
"Hard to imagine" Harry mumbled absent-mindedly. "You look good in everything you wear."
“We are not allowed on the third landing, mother. Those are Harry’s ‘private’ rooms, and he does not wish for any of us to invade them.”
This was a dream. By Merlin, he should have realised sooner and not gotten his hopes up. Of course, this was nothing but a figment of his imagination. Nothing good had happened to him since accepting this cursed Dark Mark. Clawing at the skin of his wrist, Lucius did his best to draw blood. He didn’t want this; couldn’t take comfort in a dream he knew would dissolve under the harsh magic of the Dementors. He deserved every suffering, but seeing his family despair, would destroy him. “Wake up.
"Our professor Snape is hardly a teenager."
"Do you think we should get them out of the Manor?"
Draco still wolfed down his dinner, before retreating to his task.
"Whiskey!" the Auror corrected him.
"Flaws like you going dark. That you showed mercy and compassion was the right thing to do. We both know that. But your little side-project …" Robarts tempered off, gesturing towards the pure-blood elite around them. "You're trying to change their way of living; the way we raise our children. This could go bad much easier than it can go right."
The roused conversation had the four friends look at each other hopefully. Their suspended wait was interrupted when the delinquent spat out with a rasped voice, “You can’t mean that, Potter. What you plan is social suicide! We both know that I will never bow to you.”
Her forgiving nature had always been one of Luna's most outstanding qualities. Briefly reaching for her hand, Harry squeezed it, smiling at his friend gratefully.
--O-O--
Once the door had closed behind them, Ron gestured towards the chair, only claiming it at the patient's inviting gesture. His manners seemed to have improved considerably over the last few years. Still, Snape did not care for the idle chit-chat when the red-head started, "I like the new furniture, or the old one, I guess, since Harry said that these are your things from Hogwarts."
Laughing for the pure joy of being in the air again, Harry flew circles around the other man. "After the Nimbus was thrashed, the Firebolt was the second broom I owned and rode through nearly my entire Quidditch career at Hogwarts. After tonight, we will look into a better, brighter future. But none of it will be worth anything if we forgot about our past."
At Grimmauld Place, the Aurors had set up shop in Harry's office. The table from the dining room had been requisitioned and was covered with papers and scrolls. Every little fact and idea had been written down and sorted around the long scroll in the middle that held their timeline. It started with their first encounters with the Children of Hecate, went on to the exploding house and even included the conflict with Dolohov at the yule-ball. Somehow, Neville had the feeling that Lucius' and Draco's abduction were related, though he could not explain why. So they used the upper half of the table for Draco-related titbits of information and the more significant, lower half for Lucius.
"That is
"No matter their intentions; and let us assume they only have the best because it is their offspring we are talking about; one wrong word at the wrong time could doom us all."
"Why Draco?"
Harry and Neville traded a glance and pulled out their wands as soon as the door to Rosier House was opened. It certainly was no Manor, more similar to Grimmauld Place in size and style. But it had a certain feeling to it that Neville and Harry had only come across at Death Eater abodes: dark and menacing.
Once the door snapped shut, Narcissa mumbled, amazed by how easily her sister interacted with the younger wizard who had become family by being godfather to her little nephew as much as being cousin Sirius' heir. "He has become a great man. Better than any of us could have hoped for. With his political pull, he could be anything, even Minister of Magic. Yet he works as an Auror and lives in a house that resists him at every turn."
The disdain was so heavy in the Potion Master's voice, the tone so very familiar, that a tear ran down Narcissa's cheek. "So, you make a habit of reading people's most private thoughts?"
"Emerald, …" was the last thing Harry heard from Severus, before the door closed. He wondered how long his partner's spell would hold. Neville certainly seemed irritated enough with him so his magic would trap him far into the night.
He was scared. A small and distant part of Harry - the one that usually kept him alive in the field when curses were flying past him - could analyse the situation and judge it accordingly. But the majority of him was as terrified as Draco. Terrified that he had involuntarily harmed the man he had come to care about. So, instead of keeping his cool, he lashed out, screaming right back when Malfoy got in his face, "I showed him the bloody picture, just like you told me. So, stop being an idiot when it was your idea in the first place!"
There are likely to be no more updates in August. This story is NOT abandoned, NOR slowed. It's just me. That's it. Go on now and have fun with this chapter. It's a brilliant one if I dare to say so myself :).
There was a brief pause in their conversation, where neither witch nor wizard seemed to know of how to proceed. Recalling his duties as a host, Draco called out, "Emerald, iridescent tea please, and biscuits, should any be available."
"Really," her other self confirmed. "But for once, things have to play out the way they are supposed to. After all, this is the fourth time we have this day. Miss Belfast and Mr Welsh went slightly off track, but now I think we have ironed out all glitches."
"She is." The olive-skinned wizard nodded.
Neville glared at his superior. "Now listen, Sir, what I'm about to reveal, has to stay in this office at all cost. Do I have your word?"
"Yea," the other grinned, "likewise, Potter."
"In case the first one wears off."
"Of course," Neville smiled fondly. "I was a N.E.W.T. student. Twice, actually."
"There is body oil in the shower and make-up on the counter. Make use of both!"
By now, Lucius was used to being belittled, or so he told himself when Mrs Granger's new … or old colleague offered another demeaning remark about Lucius' 'usefulness' during the weekly department breakfast. In the beginning, he had been confused about losing a few hours of work each Thursday, but soon Lucius had recognised these for their benefit. Seemingly 'casual' conversations were used to network, as well as discuss their cases and bounce ideas off of someone else's head. Usually, Lucius had considered this enjoyable, but now - it was still nothing compared to what he had suffered at the hands of the Dark Lord. When you were able to stay sane through torment and humiliation at the hands of your master, mere words could not hurt you. The former Lord was actually angry with himself, for reacting so emotionally about the needling of the barrister. Especially since he knew that the other wizard would never back up the vitriol, he was spewing, with a torture curse as Voldemort had. Hence, it did not matter; words did not matter, especially since Lucius himself seemed to still be in the good graces of Lord Thomson, the Head of the Department of Magical Law.
“Well, our healers are out, and I don’t think that St. Mungos is a good idea either. But as you said, it’s just a few scratches. Most mothers would be proficient at cleaning them. I think I know the right person who would not only be willing, but eager to treat him.”
"I can't even begin to tell you how fucking angry I am." Harry spat out, only to mumble reflexively, "Apologies, Sir." He always tried to mind his manners, since the man in the bed certainly would not tolerate anything less were he awake.
"By doing another inventory," Neville came to his partner's aid, who nodded enthusiastically. "Exactly, and if they come, we can …" Harry pondered before his face lit up. "We could put trackers on the books, so we can follow them if they are taken."
After a while, the Lady remarked, "It is not his place to talk like that."
--O-O--
Shaking his head, Neville pulled his partner into a fierce hug. "You never do anything the easy way. Fine, I'll hold the office while you sort out this mess. But remember, Harry, you still have a job. Eventually, you will have to find an occupation for Mr Malfoy where he is not in danger of being strangled on sight."
With a small smile, the raven-haired tilted his head, "You are welcome, and, Draco?"
--O-O--
"I know where to find it," the Lady Tonks assured him, rising to kiss his forehead, before guiding him out of the door. "I'm familiar with your home, Harry. Stop worrying and go to bed. Good−night, love."
"Potter?" Draco mumbled, still half asleep despite sitting up. "Potter! You need to get away. Run! He'll be back. He'll always come back, stronger and more horrible than before! You won't stand a chance." A sob tore itself free of the man's throat when he chocked, "Dumbledore, Severus, they paid for resisting him with their lives. Dad will be next. You have to get away from us! Save yourself, or he'll kill you!"
"Then do it yourself, you stupid bastard!" Harry screamed, taking the older man aback. "What kind of asshole do you take me for, that I would decide your fate? I! Am! Not! Tom! Marvolo! Riddle!"
When Harry tapered off, Hermione continued for him, "That way, even if the body's attacked or destroyed, the wizard cannot die, for a part of his soul remains earthbound. Herpo the Foul, in Ancient Greece, was the first known wizard who practised this atrocity."
"Until he doesn't take it any longer," the young wizard shrugged. "There are really no repercussions of waning it off. You would only have to be cautious about side effects in combination with other potions. This one, for example," gesturing towards a vial with a milky-white liquid and a white stopper. "It might look like a pain-relief potion, but in combination with the first one, it might burn out the wizard's core. Nasty business," he shook his head. "I would not recommend it. It is all a theoretical concern, of course. Nobody would ever test that. However, one could easily confuse one with the other, so I'm just warning you." Taking out a near-identical milky potion with a light-grey stopper, he put it on the table beside the tall bottle. "This is a normal pain-relief, for when you need it. No negative side-effects with this one. Even if your husband takes it."
Snickering, Ron shook his head, "Of course not. Do you really think Hermione would allow that?"
Tilting his head, Harry replied, "It should be. But the wards just informed me that a young woman fell out of my floo and she is 'wetting' my carpet."
"She won't?" Leewood asked, surprised, from behind the viewing-mirror. He had been looking up possible enchantments for hours Ruby could be under, so he had only caught up with them right now.
No! She had to have faith.
At loss of what to say, both men gazed at their cups, trying their best to ignore the awkwardness that had risen between them.
The Minister of Magic allowed himself a small smile. "Redirecting magic is as easy as telling where the sun will come up. The knowledge is already there. You simply have to trust your instincts and not overthink it."
Lacewing flies. How ridiculous. If it were that simple, Draco would have had the antidote brewed for ages! Closing his eyes, he scratched his little fox behind the ears, while keeping her from nicking bacon off his plate. Somehow, her natural affections always managed to sooth him. Maybe this was of no use. Maybe he just was not good enough to master his godfather's recipes. But he had to! Nobody but him would ever be as invested in helping Severus Snape, a former spy, a Death Eater, the dungeon bat of Hogwarts.
Understanding dawned in the man's eyes, and a horrified glance rose on his face, "I would have been sick all over the place."
Seeing Harry unbuttoning his robe though the window while approaching the garden-shed, the man nodded, "I might have an idea, as should you, also your fiancé and, I imagine, every Weasley out there. But now, you'll excuse me. I have some stirring to do."
"Right," the boy confirmed, his tongue peeking out from behind his teeth, while he coloured the edge of his scroll midnight−blue. "and he was loyal and really fer… for… Harry, what's the f−word that means angry and strong?"
True to Charlie's prediction, the little fox peeked out of Draco's jacket and sniffed excitedly at the bowl. With a tiny smile, the blond put it into her new 'cavern', watching her scramble after it. Pulling the blankets close, he climbed out of the enclosure. Raising his eyebrows at Harry, he asked, "Can we eat?"
There appeared to be a few same-sex couples on the Black Family Tree. At least if the genders assigned to names had not changed dramatically over the last few centuries. Few and far between, but all had had children, continuing the family's legacy. Groaning, scrubbing his face, Harry decided that it was time for bed. Though he was still free tomorrow, he did not want to try and decipher the meaning behind Lucius' words. They had sounded too much like a blessing, and Harry did not want to get his hopes up.
"Close, gentlemen, but not quite. Mr Pince, Mr Leewood, Mr Longbottom and Mr Potter, since you have passed through the entrance with your hearts free of maliciousness, greed or a thirst for power, be welcome to the Arthurian Library. And since I am the librarian of this place, let me introduce myself as well. Christopher Pendragon, at your service."
Inspecting the inconspicuous strip of leather, Severus could not keep his curiosity at bay. "What is it?"
is the one who is currently planning to convert the better half of Grimmauld Place's dungeon floor into a potion's lab, just so Uncle Severus stays."
"Of course," the dragon-tamer confirmed. "Strawberries are no problem."
Pulling back his hand, brushing his thumb over the mark on his way down, noticing the effort his vassal put into keeping his arm still, Harry decided, "You should go home, Lucius. I am certain that Narcissa is already expecting you."
Slowly turning around, they watched Irma Pince enter the library, slipping a time-turner under her robe.
"Ice cream is a dessert, not a meal."
Instantly, the older wizard whipped around and studied him, "And you are."
"Astoria," the blond sighed. "I'll get the first-aid potions-kit I've composed. Meet you in the kitchen."
As one, they left the house and approached the ritual-circle Arthur had prepared. Symbols of the elements, the old gods and magic itself decorated the edge. Claiming the place of the north-star, Arthur Weasley sat down his candle and raised his hands.
"And from what I have heard, he was courageous in his protectiveness of his werewolf friend."
and for all there is about to be."
"Wow, that's tough," Daphne mumbled before plastering a fake smile on her face. "Anyway, see you tomorrow, Potter. Have fun with your vassal." Then she skipped down the steps and vanished as soon as the gate had fallen shut behind her.
“I tried to find the right spell to get him back.” The raven-haired choked, clawing at the armrest when he looked at the singed fabric where his godfather’s name ought to be. “But I can’t do it. No matter what I try, I can’t get it right.”
Wordlessly, the two continued their dinner, with Hermione dropping pieces of her dessert into Lucius bowl, once he was finished with the porridge. Then, for lack of anything better to do, they waited, sitting on the thin mattress that had previously been their only furniture.
