However, he can't deny the loneliness that he's feeling. He does have a few friends here and there but they know him as Adhil. Not by his true identity. Not a day goes by that he doesn't miss the presence of his friends that he's known since they were in nappies and the sense of belongingness that he feels when they spend time together.
"I don't think that's true."
Harry walked past the waiting area wand headed over to the receptionist. He almost jumped in surprise when the witch behind the desk looked up because he spoke to that same face mere minutes ago.
"I'm not here for that."
"Of course. At first, I didn't think that he'd have the guts to do it but, just like you, I've clearly underestimated him." She said, a sneer making its way onto her face. "You know what, I don't think I'll be able to verbally recall the last time I saw Draco... you would just have to see it for yourself."
"What's this for?" He asked, making the man beside him jump a little at the proximity of his voice. He was pointing at a small, dark green bottle with a brown label written in French.
"Sir, there are nine missing Muggle cases in South Kensington alone, including Hubert Walters." Grunhild started, placing the case files on Harry's desk. The three of them were in Harry's office in the Investigation Department. Ron, on the other hand, went to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes to work on the magical signature device with George. He would just have to be briefed on the case later. "All of them males and of various ages, jobs, and social status."
"We would have to perform the necessary spells to determine who this arm belongs to. If it's a wizard's, it will probably still have atleast an ounce of its magical signature." Robards explained. "If it's a Muggle's, we have to send if over for DNA testing. Nonetheless, considering the interference in the spellwork, it would definitely still have traces of dark magic that will help us identify the culprit.
"Potter…Potter! Harry!" Adhil called out, tapping the other man's arm. Sonya was standing nearby, goggles removed and her work neglected for the time being. She was ready for any instruction that Adhil was going to give her. "Sonya, hold his arms. I need to…"
"Again, Potter. Children. I despise being surrounded by gremlins. Might as well perform a cloning charm and multiply you into twenty speckled gits. Same thing." Malfoy shrugged again, before adopting a more serious tone. "I still like Potions but sometimes we have to let go of things that aren't for us."
"Bloody hell…" Harry heard Ron mutter, sounding a bit queasy himself despite being an expert in the Dark Arts and thus having dealt with the sickest of things more than the regular Auror.
Harry spluttered. The mere thought of Parkinson reading what Malfoy wrote is enough to embarass him. He doesn't know why he's embarassed though. There's nothing particularly incriminating in those letters after all. "N-No!" Harry cleared his throat. "I mean, there's nothing important written there. Just a 'thank you' note to…thank me."
"The fire died out on its own," Perkins explained. "I already performed the necessary spells on the box and it's been echanted with a protection spell and a complicated locking charm."
Harry's gaze fell onto the Potions Master who was staring at him with a questioning look.
And she's right. Despite the lack of information in the note, the gift itself held a message that Draco was faring well. Harry tried not to smile at that fact but, along with that small spark of joy, he also felt uneasy. Should he still continue looking for him? If Draco was already doing well, Harry will probably just disturb whatever peace he has already found. That question was answered as Harry looked around the room and at their unusual circle of friends. He feels like something is missing and he has an inkling feeling as to what – or who – that something is. Judging by the faraway expression in the former Slytherins' eyes, Harry figures that they also want to see Draco again.
For some reason or another, Harry has decided that he's going to find Draco Malfoy and bring him home. Help him start again. He's going to figure out the particulars as to how exactly he's going to do that but for now he needs to know where Malfoy is.
An hour later, Harry stood in the middle of a place called Place Sathonay, a square that's located in the heart of Lyon's first district. In the middle of it was a statue of some historical figure, probably an old mayor or something. He could've Apparated directly to the address that he was given but he wasn't sure if there are wards protecting the Potions Master's residence. A failed Apparation will result into landing in the closest free area beside the original destination. Harry didn't know the area well so he couldn't risk suddenly appearing in front of Muggles. That would be unwise and would result into him being kicked back to England in a snap. So, he resorted into travelling by Floo powder to the nearest wizarding establishment near Place Sathonay. Luckily, it was a pub just two blocks away from the square. The only thing he had to do was walk here to this mini-park and figure where to go from there.
You all mean so much to me because this fic is the VERY FIRST multi-chaptered that I've finished. It's such a milestone for me. Your comments have kept me going whenever I feel like I'm not a good enough writer.
"Doing my job." Malfoy simply said. "Get up. You have a Ministry function to attend to tomorrow and you need new robes."
The young Auror sat on his chair with a heavy sigh. He removed his glasses and pressed the heels of his palms over his eyes in frustration. He then took out Malfoy's letter from his robe pocket and set it down on his desk. Harry felt ridiculous carrying it wherever he goes but he feels uneasy with just the thought of leaving it for anyone to find.
"What? I was right about sixth year!"
"Hello, Pansy Parkinson." Harry greeted back in an equally teasing tone. The two of them have become rather close friends through the years. At first, it was just because of Harry wanting to find Draco and thus turning to the latter's closest friend for information. However, with Pansy growing closer and closer to Luna, she has somehow integrated herself into their friendship circle. Harry has no complaints though. The former Slytherin is a fierce and loyal friend. She's a force to be reckoned with and will fight tooth-and-nail to get something she wants. Of course, being raised as a pureblood Slytherin, said fighting often involves negotations and a little bit of bribing and manipulation instead of actual brute force. Despite being their friend, Pansy never lets a day or social gathering pass without teasing each and everyone of what she dubbed as "The Gryffindor Bunch". For Harry, that means dramatically being called by his full name in the first twenty minutes of any of their gathering before Pansy goes on to call him "Henry".
"You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. I'm not going to force you to go back to Britain. I'm going to declare it as a cold case, if you want. I'm not going to ruin the peace that you've already built for yourself here but I just need to know...I need to know if I'm right. Please."
"Well, our research team has managed to find a way to modify the potion. It's all hush hush, of course but I am such a huge fan of their work and---" Claudette stopped herself mid-sentence, realizing that she's still at work and should therefore maintain a professional appearance and behavior. "I mean, yes. I can assist you with your concern, Mr…?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I thought you were meant to get going?" Adhil asked.
"Are you a hundred percent certain that this is what you want to do?" He asked. "Not eighty-five nor ninety-nine but a one hundred percent?"
And so, here Harry was, sat in his office with the faded ivory coloured envelope resting on his desk. He picked it up and examined it. The script in which his name was written in was familiar and so was the faint scent attached to it. He turned the envelope over and stared at the wax seal bearing a simple flower on it. It was far from the grand Malfoy crest that he expected to see. Harry furrowed his brows in confusion before letting out a deep sigh and opening the envelope. It only held a single piece of parchment not longer than 15-inches. The scent of Malfoy's perfume got stronger as he unfolded the paper inside.
"I'm…I'm just wondering if…" Draco stumbled, contemplating on whether or not he should actually say what's on his mind or just keep it to himself. "Nevermind."
"HOLY FUCK!" Joseph exclaimed, rushing over to where his cook was.
That night, he dreamt of that day in Malfoy Manor, roughly five years ago when Malfoy refused to confirm his identity. Silver eyes boring into his, pools of mercury swirling with both recognition and fear.
Updates will be every TUESDAY.
"Doesn't that mean that I wouldn't even be able to suspect that Draco and Adhil are the same person?"
They could've been together for far longer than three years but Draco will never regret his decision to leave Britain. He's still happier here and now he has Harry with him, his friends back in his life, and his remaining family by his side too.
Draco's heart skipped a beat as it always did whenever Harry would utter those three words. He smiled and said those same words, knowing that they also had the same effect on Harry as they did on him.
Let yourself live, Draco. You do not deserve to spend your years alone. Be with your friends, your family. You still have your aunt. She'll accept you wholeheartedly."
Maybe Ron and Hermione were right. He was never really right as rain whenever Malfoy is involved. His…interest (he refused to call it an "obsession") may have been pushed to the back of his mind because of the little to no interactions that he shared with the blond but the letter brought it all back in full throttle.
"So, how's the Malfoy case, Harry?" Hermione asked once the three of them were sat down by the dinner table with plates piled up with food. Both Hermione and Ron did a fantastic job with cooking for tonight's dinner. Harry doesn't know where the two of them find the time to cook, much less learn it, what with being extremely busy with work. Well, if there's a will, there's a way, Harry guessed.
The entire discovery was peculiar because it's the first head that they found. The others were just limbs. It wasn't even transfigured into a different object in the first place. It was just stuck onto a spear and made to be a part of a scarecrow, replacing its original head that was made out of stuffed canvas cloth. It seemed like it was left there for quite some time judging by the maggots that were wriggling their way out of his eyeballs. It was only discovered because an eyeball fell on top of the daughter's head while she and her brother were playing around it.
Ron and Hermione gave Pansy and Luna a wizarding clock for their home, similar to what the Weasleys have. They could add more people there in the future if they want. For now, there are only two hands on it, both pointing at "home".
"Is he alright?"
The music kept on playing. A sweet song that was carried by the wind. Everyone turned to face the other end of the aisle once again as Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley walked in. Luna looked enchanting and ethereal in her ivory wedding dress, chiffon cloth draped over her shoulders serving as a sleeve to the simple V-necked bodice. The same floral lace patterns from Pansy's gown can be found sewn into hers as well, although it was only confined on the upper part of the dress. The skirt of the gown flowed freely and its hem barely reached the ground, showing Luna's bare feet. The blonde wore a soft smile on her face as she looked ahead. Her eyes were shining with love and affection for her soon-to-be wife. Her golden locks flowed down her back like a river adorned with little white flowers that were probably conjured by Luna herself.
"I don't see why that's any of your business." Adhil said dryly, obviously trying to hide his surprise behind a mask of indifference with a little bit of snobbishness.
"You know she told you to call her Andy." Harry said, poking Draco's side. "Aunt Andromeda makes her feel 'ancient'."
"But how do you do it? Is it the necklace?"
"Is that what Malfoy left you? The entirety of his fortune?"
"Pansy?"
"You're a genius, mate!" He exclaimed. "I really do believe that the Unspeakables already have a device of some sort that's attuned to magical signatures but fat chance they're gonna lend it to us just for this case. Maybe they would if the security of the entire wizarding world is at stake."
"Oh."
Harry snorted. Of course they wouldn't tell Muggles about where the "medicine" came from. Not only was it a very common potion to brew – only slightly more complicated than the polyjuice – but its ingredients aren't what one would consider rare. Get that information out into the Muggle world and corporations are sure to capitalize on it.
Thank you for supporting "La Clarté"!
"The 29th?!" Harry exclaimed incredulously. "But that's three weeks away!"
"What, like Unicorn's blood?"
It's understandable why Belinda Turnstile, The Quibbler's front desk secretary, would assume that he's here for Luna. Harry usually visits her once every two weeks for tea or to just hang out. Sometimes, he stops by The Quibbler where they would have afternoon tea while chatting about Harry's latest case. They would often be joined by Parkinson who seems to enjoy Luna's company more than she would care to admit. There are also times when  Harry would visit Luna's home where she would go on and on about her newest discoveries, whether it be a new colony of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or a baby Blibbering Humdinger.
Parkinson sighed and placed her elbow on the desk before she started to massage her temples.
Speaking of expectations and upbringings, that's one thing that he loves about being in France. The anonymity. No one knows him here. No one knows his past. No one even knows what his real name really is and if they did, it will bring less uproar than if it were to be uttered in Britain. They only know his work and they respect him for that. As long as he continues to be Adhil, the young upstart Potions Master who is intent on uniting wizards and Muggles through medicine, he could continue to have a good life.
Harry breathed in deeply to organize his thoughts. For now, he pushed the idea of quitting the Auror force to the back of his mind. Instead, he sets out to figure out just why the Masidec glowed in the shop and if his hypothesis about Draco and Adhil being the same person is true.
"Strange whispering? What was he whispering about? And how strange has he been acting?"
"What?" Ron asked, turning back to look at the portrait hanging above the mantlepiece. His mouth fell open at the sight before him. "Holy shit… That's awesome! They're glowing…"
Thank you for reading! 💖
Being trained Aurors, Harry and Ron both noticed the slightest way in which Joseph's posture stiffened. It was the only sign that he was bothered by the question. The man cleared his throat and plastered on a smile.
It's difficult but he only has to look at his own face sewn into the Black family tree to keep him going.
Those were Parkinson's words during that day at the Manor. Malfoy is finally trying. And may everything be damned if Harry isn't there to see it.
"Henry," Pansy said in a fake posh voice. "Be a dear and fetch it for me, will you?
"That's what Muggle technology is about, isn't it?" Adhil replied, setting his notepad down on the counter by the till. It seems like he was done with what he was doing. "To make people's lives better? What's the use of inventing new novelty potions if we can improve what's already in our roster?"
The two Aurors made their way to the backroom that George has dubbed as "The Lab". It's where he usually works on new products for the shop. It's door was protected by a special ward that only lets certain people see it to keep curious customers from snooping around and ruining everything.
Well, if it isn't Draco's weakness: Harry Potter kindheartedness and his desire to give so much to those he loves.
"Looks like you got another wedding gift."
"It's her!" Ron yelled, firing a Stupefy at the deranged woman who was now throwing a wide array of hexes at anyone near her.
"Why am I 'Potter' everytime I do something?" Harry mumbled as he dusted off what little crumbs he could find. "What do you think we should buy for Teddy? The Firebolt Thunder 2000 or the Tornado 1000? I heard that they're both very good."
"Here." A familiar voice replied from the living room. He walked over to where the blond was and found him lounging on the sofa, going through their mail. A cup of tea and a plate of chocolate biscuits sat on the coffee table in front of him. Harry set his bags on the floor beside the sofar before walking over to his boyfriend and pressing a soft kiss on his temple. "How was the trip?"
"I know this symbol. I know this flower. It's on the wax seal of his letter." Harry informed them, struggling to keep his voice even. "It's a daffodil."
"As you've all been taught, Dark Magic leaves traces that cannot be washed away by any normal spell," The Head Auror started to explain. "Which is why it would be extremely helpful if we can come up with something that can tell us if a certain magic like this belongs to a specific person."
"We actually went over to Pansy and Luna's the other day to take a closer look at the necklaces," George added. "They have runes written on the back to keep the enchantments in."
"That's ridiculous!" Ron exclaimed. "It'll take us a whole week – at the very least – to get the necessary papers and that is if Harry pulls out his 'I saved the wizarding world, the least you could do is prioritize my request' card."
"I couldn't let them be carted to Azkaban! They saved my life!"
"I, for one, am glad to hear from the git." Pansy said, her face scrunched in an almost sneer although she was gently clutching the pendant of her necklace. "Atleast, we now know that he's alive and apparently has enough money to purchase such valuable gifts."
Harry half expected the room to feel like an asylum or a hospital ward what with all the whiteness but it was anything but that. Elegance and sophistication dripped from every item. It felt like each piece was carefully chosen to compliment each other. It was refreshing and sort of uplifting. Two tall windows helped with the refreshing ambience. Harry figured that they would normally allow natural sunlight to shine into the living room but the impending storm prevented that from happening.
"Auror Potter, can you tell whether or not this arm belongs to one of our missing wizards?"
Andy and Teddy both still lived in the Tonks house while Harry has been trying to make Grimmauld Place his home. Sirius left it to him and he doesn't want to leave it empty. He wants to fill it with bright and happy memories that will erase its dark past. Harry deems himself successful for the most part. Walburga would roll in her grave if she sees the current state of the House of Black. Gone were the moth infested curtains and the dusty eaten-through carpets, the house elf heads and the troll foot. In their place were curtains made of nearly transparent silk fabric that allowed light to seep through into the now clean windows. The carpet that was spread out in the living room was a gift from Luna from her travels in Saudi Arabia. As for the other items in the house, Harry either destroyed or sold most of them after making sure that they're not cursed. He then renovated the whole place with the help of his friends. Every room is brighter, cleaner, and more welcoming. Household cleaning spells now work properly and Harry doesn't have to scrub fruitlessly for hours on the bathroom tiles to remove the dirt and grime just for it to return to its previous state a few moments later. If he was being perfectly honest with himself, Grimmauld Place started to become "more cooperative" after he was officially named Sirius' heir, making him appear in the Black family tree that still adorned the drawing room. Andy mentioned that it's probably the house finally recognizing him as part of the Black family.
"He went to the shop yesterday and I have a feeling that he knows who I am. Well, I think his subconscious does." The blond continued, his mind flashing with images of Harry keeling over in pain. Adhil's hand went to clutch the pendant hanging from his neck. It was his mother's, given to her by Grandmother Druella when she was still just a baby and she passed it on to him when he was born. The pendant was actually a simple round locket. It was silver and had daffodil and vine patterns inscribed on it. Inside, it held a small picture of him with his parents. Adhil rarely opens the locket to look at the picture. Even after all these years, seeing his once happy family still brings a sting to his chest. Besides, it wasn't the picture itself that is important but the enchantments that have been laced through the locket. These enchantments have brought him peace fo five years. Peace that he finds himself willing to risk to have his friends and remaining family back into his life.
I apologize for the long wait!
A few days after the Missing Wizards case was closed, Harry could be found in a random Muggle pub in the middle of London. He just got off work and wanted to have a moment for himself. He was too exhausted from a day of signing paperworks to hang out with his friends. Besides, Ron was given a special assignment of refining the Masidec for official Ministry use. Not to mention that he's also spending every minute of his free time with Hermione which they both truly deserved after the excitement and business that these past months have brought.
"Harry…" He called out after a few moments of relaxed silence.
Harry had to take a moment to regain his bearings as he was transported back to his office. He watched the swirling waters of the Pensieve and mulled over the events that transpired within Parkinson's memories.
"Then, can I do this?"
"I think you'll need this, Harry. Tell Draco we said 'thanks' and that we're looking forward to having him over for brunch in the future." was all she said before she smiled at him cryptically.
Harry's head immediately snapped down to look at his chest. He had to squint to see the faint baby blue glow that it's emitting. He immediately reached into his shirt and took out the pendant to examine it closely.
It turns out that the table was originally a severed arm. The electricity and radiowaves of the Muggle appliance interfered with the spellwork that had it preserved and transfigured. The images that you are about to see are quite sensitive so I have to ask each and everyone of you to be prepared."
After putting two and two together, Adhil rushed over to one of the shelves and grabbed a Headache Relieving Potion and a Dreamless Sleep Potion. He rushed to where the Auror was hunched over, head in between his hands and groans of anguish coming out of his mouth.
Ginny gave them VIP tickets to the upcoming Quidditch match between the Holyhead Harpies and Puddlemere United as well as invitations to a gala that Pansy has wanted to attend for a long time but couldn't due to her busy schedule.
"We have to check the wards, the Floo system--" Hermione started to say. "Did this arrive by owl? And are we absolutely sure that it's from Draco? I think we ought to examine it…"
He was prepared to see HIS face.
"No." was Pansy's clipped response.
"Then why?" Draco asked.
At that point, Adhil stood up and went over to the fireplace. He picked up a snow globe and examined it. Harry watched him in return. He noticed how the other man's brows furrowed as if he's genuinely confused about something.
Harry, Ron, George, and Angelina were now all in the Leaky Cauldron, having lunch together. It was just before noon so it wasn't as crowded as it usually was. Nevertheless, the group sat in a fairly isolated corner and cast a Muffliato charm when their orders were delivered. One would never know if there are any eavesdroppers hanging about, looking to sell any smidgen of information to the Prophet.
"Three tins of biscuits then." Harry said once they've calmed down.
"Ginny and I aren't…together."
Harry did remember the Barkley case. It was one of the most bizarre cases that they've ever come across in years. It started off as a series of robberies reported to junior aurors. In time, the things that were taken started to escalate. From common quills in the school supplies shop to a whole bottle of unicorn tears from the apothecary. The witnesses all saw different people. Sometimes it was a small child, barely of Hogwarts age. Other times it was a young woman or an old man. In the end, they found out that it was just one person, an old woman named Peggy Barkley who was an expert in brewing a wide array of potions, including the Polyjuice potion. She was dying from an incurable disease and had written a bucketlist for herself. The list specifically said "to have an item from each store in Diagon Alley for FREE" along with a few more ramblings of a dying woman. It was difficult to associate each and every robbery to her but her magical signature was quite distinct: a black river that resembled sludge. All the Aurors had to do was hide in a nearby alley by one of the stores and follow the culprit. It was by luck that the polyjuice's effect started to falter just as she was about to apparate away. Barkley was immediately arrested the moment she stepped a foot into Diagon.
George stepped back from the working table so that the three of them can look at it more comfortably.
"No, Potter. I do not know.",
"Oh, that's fine!" The woman said with a welcoming smile as she switched to an accented English with ease. "Hi, what can I do for you today?"
"Uh, Healer Vartan is the head for the magical division of the program." Claudette started to say, her voice seeming far away and just confused. Harry thought that, if used the right way, the Confundus charm can definitely have the same effects as the Imperius curse. He filed that information away for future use. "They're usually in the Oncology Department. Fifth floor, west wing. Elevators are on the right."
Thank you so much for reading! I really hope you're all liking this so far. I'm having so much fun writing this! I finished writing the chapter earlier than scheduled so I posted it right away~
"The fire is strange, sir. We have been trying to put it out in every way that we know but it's persisting." Mulligan answered. "We suspect Dark Magic. As for the occupants of the house, Draco Malfoy seems to be missing. Although it is likely that he has become a casualty. We still can't know for sure. However, his magical signature is all over the place."
Harry was being put off by all of these questions. He was the Auror here. He was supposed to be the one to ask the questions, not answer them. And yet, he couldn't help but speak his mind.
"I'm telling you, Philip!" Kevin insisted. "You've seen how frail Martina was! She was basically stuck in her wheelchair for the better part of the last five years. You saw her pictures from last week all up and at it! It was like she never even got sick in the first place."
Harry sighed.
"They all have daffodils on them, drawn in similar if not the exact same way. Your shop is even named The Daffodil." Harry continued. "A simple research was all it took for me to find out that daffodils are also called 'narcissus'. Quite close to Narcissa, don't you think?"
"There's a note." Luna pointed out as she reached for the now empty box. There, tucked underneath the cushion that the necklace rested on, was a small piece of rolled parchment. The blonde unrolled it and it was such a tiny piece of paper that Harry doubts that there's even anything written in there aside from a single word. Mayhaps a "Congratulations". However, Luna seems to be reading something on it that's longer than just a single word. She then began to read it out loud, deeming the note proper enough to be broadcasted among their friends.
"Do you think that I'll…turn dark? Become a…dark lord?" He asked after a long silence. It was a ridiculous question but he had to know. Ron and Hermione will flat out tell him no but Draco was honest. Well, atleast the blond is not about to sugarcoat things.
"Sorry?"
The previous pain must have been quite intense and the current one starting to amplify again because all Harry did was nod in response and take the bottle handed to him.
Harry's eyes travelled from Adhil's face down to his body. His eyes caught a glint of a silver chain hanging around his neck, visible thanks to the top two buttons being undone on the man's crisp white button up shirt.
"Over my dead body!" Draco exclaimed in a high-pitched voice with a thick French accent that made the two wizards laugh.
"Indeed." Agkras confirmed before standing and going over to one of the numerous file cabinets that lined the walls. After just a few seconds of searching, he procured a thick looking Manila folder that he set on the desk. "These files hold nothing but simple bank statements. If you want to view the actual legal documents, I suggest you confer with Lady Parkinson."
Upon finishing the letter, Harry released the breath he didn't realize he was holding. There was a lot to digest from what Malfoy wrote. Malfoy's thoughts seem to be all over the place but they made sense. The first and most important thing that he got from that is that Malfoy is still alive. Most likely. He doesn't have any idea as to how he came up with that conclusion but, after reading the letter, Harry just knows that Draco Malfoy is alive. He is. He has to be.
This limb was once Pollux Grimbleton's left leg. It was in a similar state as Quinn's arm. As expected, the abundance of electricity and radiowaves disrupted the magic and so it started to revert back to its original state.
Harry just let out a groan in response.
"Cool…" Harry said in admiration. That would've been useful a year ago during one of their more nasty cases. He was hit with a flesh eating curse that did exactly what it was expected to do. It ate through the skin, flesh, and muscle of his right arm until only the bone was left. It took the Healers two full weeks to patch him up and re-grow his skin. Harry pointed to another group of potions, this time it was the ones directly in front of Adhil. "How about these? What do they do?"
"Now," Adhil spoke, as he set down his cup on the coffee table. He leaned back and crossed one leg over the other before looking at Harry with a perfectly schooled expression of neutrality. Something about this man's entire stature is nagging at Harry's brain. He feels like he already had the answer at the tip of his tongue but his tongue seems to be miles and miles long. "I'm sure that we're not here to talk about tea preferences. What brings you to France, Auror Potter?"
"I found you." He whispered, still entranced as his other hand came up to cup Draco's other cheek. "You're you…"
After talking to Celeste, Harry sat on one of the numerous waiting chairs in the lobby and took the time to look through the papers that he was given. The first few sheets were the standard "Patient Information Sheet", followed by information about the program, a list of requirements, and a waiver that has to be signed by the patient and the patient's family. Harry was just about to switch over to the pamphlet when a small purple print on the waiver page caught his eye.
A loud and familiar laugh cut off their conversation and the three men looked to see the man from yesterday, the one who made a scene and harassed one of the staff. Harry and Ron heard Joseph let out an impatient huff as the man behind them kept on laughing and chatting quite  loudly with anyone who bothers to listen.
You have suffered alone enough. Your friends have moved on from the war, they too have redeemed themselves. If what Ms. Parkinson said is to be believed, they are now friends with those Gryffindor brats which means the Wizarding World likely doesn't treat them like dirty anymore.
"This is good!" Harry exclaimed as he took a bite of the free chocolate biscuit. He and Adhil are now sitting by one of the huge windows of the café. The blond said nothing. He merely took a sip at his coffee and watched him with curious eyes. "What?"
"It's that woman behind me, isn't it?" Ron asked in a low voice, his head gesturing towards the woman's direction. Harry nodded. "She looks nervous as all hell and her wand is peeking out from her sleeve. I have a feeling she's going to start firing curses any time."
"I'm sorry but Healer Vartan is busy. I could set up an appointment for you but it wouldn't be for another two weeks."
Silence.
Their lives were intertwined indeed. Draco saved Potter's life. Potter saved his life. Draco helped him defeat the Dark Lord by giving Potter his wand. Potter testified for him during the trials.
"I'm only going out to eat breakfast. There's really no need for you to…" The blond trailed off then sighed. "Fine, you can join me. But you're paying for your meal, Potter. Knowing your stubbornness, I wouldn't be able to get you off my trail if I say otherwise."
The blond let out a sigh but peeked into the bag. The scent of freshly baked pastries wafted from the bag and into Harry's nose. It was heavenly. He had quite a heavy breakfast but he figured that the smell of baked goods is bound to make anyone hungry.
"I see…" Hermione trailed off, sitting back with pursed lips and a thoughtful expression, perhaps thinking about the ways in which an object can be transported undetected.
Unfortunately, Harry's thoughts were interrupted a sharp rapping on the window. He looked up to see one of the cutest owls that he has ever seen in his life. It was small and fluffy. It's yellow eyes looked at him innocently. Harry recognized it as a long-eared owl due to its lengthy ears that stuck out of its head like antennas. He saw that it was holding a small package so Harry went over to let the owl in. He was surprised when all it did was drop its delivery on the desk before flying back into the night.
"Yes, sir," Ron said, trying not to sound sick as Charles unwrapped the paper containing the severed arm. "It's a magical signature detecting device. For now, it can only store a person's magical signature. My brother and I are still tweaking it so that it'll give off a signal once the owner of that signature uses magic nearby. Of course, it cannot be used if the witch or wizard masks their signature."
Are they friends or something more?
"I…uh…"
"It's kinda your thing, isn't it?" The Auror asked after Adhil explained the sixth group of potions that Harry pointed at.
"Yeah. Say it explodes, right? Instead of being blown into smithereens and dying, we would just find ourselves in St. Mungos."
"James Evans."
They sat in silence once again until Harry grew uncomfortable and remembered what he was here for. He cleared his throat and finally asked the question:
"Can I help you?" He asked with a level tone, writing '17' next to the 'Enhanced Skelegrow'. He would have to brew a fresh batch of it later or tomorrow. He then looked at the Auror who was still standing by his door, probably looking for the right words to say that wouldn't get him immediately kicked out of the shop.
He's still in the process of writing his book but he already has an idea for a new one.
"Malfoy?" He called out to what seemed like an empty living room. He glanced at the clock on the mantle and saw that it was only 7:57AM. He's actually three minutes early. Brilliant. Malfoy should be up and having tea in the kitchen by now. A quick glance told Harry that the kitchen is empty and lacks a certain blonde prat who should be sitting on his bar stool with a cup of tea in his hand while reading the morning edition of The Daily Prophet. Harry immediately whipped his wand out to cast the Human Sweeping charm. Malfoy will have his head once he feels the spell scan his entire flat but Harry would rather be safe than sorry. A few seconds later, it was revealed that the flat is indeed empty. It seemed like Malfoy didn't make it home last night. Maybe he decided to sleep at the Manor. Harry shrugged and made his way to his editor's study room.
Harry was snapped out of his thoughts by  an exclamation of both surprise and confusion. He looked at the door to see Malfoy standing there with his brows furrowed. He glanced at both Harry and the desk, probably making the connection as to why Harry was standing in the middle of his study like an idiot.
Ginny pressed a soft kiss on Luna's temple once they reached the end before taking a seat beside Harry.
Finally.
"Sure, no problem." Harry nodded, not really bothered by the setting. However, Vartan's comment about their eating habits reminded Harry of the fact that he also skipped breakfast in order to catch his Portkey in time. He pushed down the discomfort brought upon by his light hunger and followed the healer to the staff break room.
"It's a gift from Harry. He had it made for us." Luna said from the kitchen. The metal clinking of utensils can be heard as the dining table is being set. The delicious smell of food also wafted throughout the quaint house.
Overall, Draco's life is going swimmingly well.
"Hermione herself agreed that the enchantments in the necklaces that Pansy and Luna received are a work of pure genius," Ron continued. "And we thought that, hey, instead of making a super obvious machine thingy, why don't we just make it look like an amulet? It's subtle and people will just think it's a piece of jewelry."
Unless…
It's a photograph of Teddy during his first Quidditch match. He looked charming in his Hufflepuff Quidditch robes. They figured that it was taken by Ginny who was still working as the flying instructor at Hogwarts.
If Harry was going to be completely honest with himself, he doesn't know what's scarier: an insane Dark wizard hell bent on using the truly wicked spells in their arsenal or a strong individual, not necessarily dark nor insane but strong enough to literally rip a man to shreds? He does know that whoever is behind all of this is extremely dangerous and that they should act as soon as possible to solve this case.
As for the rest of you, patrolling shifts will continue to as to minimize the chances of anyone being taken while we try our best to locate the unsub. However, I must impose to each and everyone of you the dangers that this case proposes. Be on the lookout for anything, advise your fellow Aurors to be alert at all times and to protect each other's backs.
"A vibrator, my friends!" Blaise proudly announced. "Battery operated, of course. But do not fret, I have made adjustments to it to make sure that it works properly in a magical environment."
"Exactly."
Adhil let out a snort.
"That's good."
"For the most part…?"
Great. Not only is he confused about Draco and Adhil's identities but Harry is also having a crisis over his own occupation.
Draco didn't care about any of that though. He spat out things so frankly and ruthlessly no matter what the other person might feel or think.
Harry simply nodded and set out to leave.   But before taking a step towards the door, he reached inside his pocket and procured a small item that he set in front of Malfoy, right on top of the letter from Hogwarts. Malfoy stopped and glanced at the candy bar in front of him. He said nothing, instead he opted to look at Harry with a single raised brow. Harry gave him a small smile in return.
"Oh…" Adhil said, a bit surprised. "What are you here for then?"
"Erm… Thanks, Luna." Harry said, still confused but thankful as well. He would need to examine the items closer and using more complex spells to see if any trace of magical signature was left.
"POTTER, GET YOUR ASS OUT OF THAT CHAIR AND GET DRESSED!"
"Whoa…" He breathed out as the lens zoomed into the walls. Harry could see every single minute detail of the wooden walls: the crevices that ran down its surface, the texture of the paint, and the small things on the wood that resembled tiny hairs.
"How did you--"
"Right. Mr. Evans," Celeste began, her voice adopting an exasperated tone. It was clear that she was slowly but surely losing her patience. Surely it was way too early to deal with stubborn people like Harry…or James, for that matter. "You must understand that we have a lot of patients in this hospital and our staff are as busy as can be. As head of the Cancer Research and Treatment Program, Dr. Laurent is one of the busiest of them all. I really do apologize if I cannot set up an earlier appointment for you."
In the end, Pansy insisted that they not look deeper into it and they all agreed to let the matter go for the time being seeing as nothing bad happened. It seems like Draco's one and only goal is to deliver Pansy and Luna's wedding present. They all hung out for a few more hours before they all started to leave one-by-one. Daphne and Millicent were the first to go home despite being the last ones to arrive. "Parenthood" Blaise has said with a shrug as they watched the two of them leave. Neville and Ginny were next, saying that they have classes in the morning. They were followed by Ron and Hermione and finally Blaise who winked at the newlywed couple and wished them luck on using his gift. Pansy merely rolled her eyes while Luna laughed.
"Roughly five years ago…? I thought that he would rather work in the Ministry like his father than be an intern here." Vartan said with a shrug as they continued to eat. "How did he go missing though?"
"What are you doing here?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Hôpital Edouard Herriot is a hospital compound right smack in the middle of the city. One would automatically assume that it's a facility by and for Muggles. However, upon crossing the gate, Harry felt a tingle run throughout his body that he could only explain as magic. He wasn't particularly sensitive to any kind of magic but he could feel wards and detection spells to a certain extent. What he felt just now? It was definitely some kind of a detection spell. However, looking back at the conversation that he heard between those two Muggles in England, Harry couldn't automatically assume that this is a wizarding establishment. It could be a mix of both. For now, he was just going to go inside and ask around as if he's a Muggle despite the obvious magical things that's happening here.
The years have been more than kind to Harry Potter. He has filled up quite well, no longer the scrawny specky git from Hogwarts nor the broken hero right after the war. Of course, he has seen him quite a few times before he packed up to France but the Potter that's sitting in front of him right now is the more mature version of the Potter from five years ago. The Gryffindor seems to age like fine wine. His hair was still messy but it's an almost effortless, suave look. There was a light stubble on his chin and jaw, making Draco wonder what it would feel like to hold Potter's face in-between his hands and stroke his cheeks with his thumbs. Those eyes are as piercing as ever despite being behind the same round glasses that Potter has always worn. They are most striking shade of green, just a tad darker than emerald. He can still remember looking straight into those fiery green eyes as he offered Potter his friendship… and got rejected.
If Draco noticed Harry's weird behavior, he didn't say anything about it. Instead, his focus was on the Masidec that's currently floating in front of him. Every so often, he would let out a soft hum either as if he's contemplating something or he's satisfied by that something.
"I imagine the Unspeakables will have some kind of device like that. Have you tried asking Hermione?"
Auror Weasley, we need the device prototypes as soon as possible. They could be our only key to finding where the rest of Mr. Quinn's body has gone.
"Is there anyone from the Cancer Research and Treatment Program that I can talk to?" Harry tried again, willing his voice to be gentle despite his patience slowly but surely running thin.
"Harry, if that's what you want to do, I'll support you 100%." He said softly, "I'm not about to hold you back from doing something you truly want. I stand by what I said all those years ago. Control your own life. You're the only person who can do that. I'm here to support you, not dictate nor stop you. Besides, it's not like you're going on a suicide mission to fight off another Dark Lord. I know that you'll be back to me, safe and sound."
"I…headache…" His utterance was followed by a loud groan as a sharp bolt of excruciating pain hit him. It was getting more intense by the minute. He clutched his head in both of his hands in an attempt to subdue the agony but it was obviously not working.
"Harry's scared that Aunt Pansy will burn him into ashes if he's late, Gran!" Teddy joined in. Harry shrugged but his lips were curved into an amused smile.
". It meant that Draco was nearby during that time. Did he walk past the shop and Harry just didn't notice?
At around 5PM, Harry travelled via Floo to Pansy and Luna's home with his gift and a bottle of Goblin-made sherry from the 1940s.
"H-He wanted to kill himself?"
"Hermione examined the wand herself."
"Oh, shush." The raven-haired woman waved Harry's protest off with a flick of her hand. She then sat back down beside her wife and opened the pouch, taking out the two small boxes that it held inside. She placed one of them on her lap and opened the other. "Huh…"
"Plank-- You watch Spongebob Squarepants?!"
That day, they cancelled their plans to question Julia. Instead, the two Aurors went back to the Ministry. Harry instructed Thimble and Grunhild to look up any missing males in South Kensington. It took them roughly two hours to get back to the office with their report.
"I told you..." Harry heard Ron mutter to George. He looked at them and noticed that a peculiar expression was painted onto their faces. It was like they knew something he didn't.
"Well, I have to say that this is the most intensive and intricate thing that I've ever worked on," The elder Weasley commented. "I'm surprised that the prototype is doing well despite the short amount of time that we have."
Harry then gestured to the part of the arm that was originally connected to its socket before, once again, addressing everyone in the room.
"Something about selling illegal substances in school," Thimble supplied. "And by illegal, we mean rare potions ingredients that need approval from MACUSA before one even thinks about acquiring them."
"Wait--" Harry said just as the Healer opened the door to leave. Vartan stopped and looked at him, a questioning eyebrow raised. "Why are you helping me? I'm not even on official Auror business. I mean, I'm really grateful but you don't have obligation to do that."
"Have you found out what happened here? Are there any casualties?" Harry inquired. He was well into his lunch of turkey sandwich and a can of soda when his secretary barged into his office, face stoic but eyes holding a slightly alarmed look. She spoke with utmost professionalism as she placed the case file on his desk. "There's been a situation, Auror. Potter. Head Auror Robards specifically asked that you take the lead. Auror Weasley's team is already on their way there but nothing has been confirmed." Ron's team specializes in the Dark Arts seeing as they are part of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. They're called whenever things are tricky because the perpetrators are suspected to be dabbling in dark magic and artefacts. If they're being called in, the situation could be more than just a bit dangerous. Harry, on the other hand, worked as the Head of the Investigation Department. Through the years, it has evolved from being an office that focuses on tracking down dark wizards to actually being more involved in the "investigation" of criminals as a whole. Not just dark wizards.
"It's beautiful," Luna murmured, eyes equally as glassy as her wife's. "Thank you so much."
He's not certain whether he'll succeed but he's hoping for the best.
"Harry?" He heard Ginny's voice call out to him. "What is it? Who's it from?"
This other necklace looked quite similar to the one Pansy is holding. However, their sole difference lie in the gem. Whilst Pansy's was a clear-cut, olive-coloured gem, the one on Luna's necklace was of a deep purple shade; an amethyst.
"Actually, no." Harry answered sheepishly. "It was first used to solve a particularly nasty case a few weeks ago. The Missing Wizards case? A witch kidnapped a handful of wizards and muggles, chopped them up, and transfigured them into various muggle objects. The Masidec was crucial in capturing the criminal and tracking down all the transfigured body parts."
He had hoped that by going away, he can cut himself off from Potter's roots but fate wasn't so easily dictated. In Draco's absence, his and Potter's friends have became friends as well. Potter is godfather to Draco's cousin. They will always be connected no matter what happens.
"I do not!" He protested. "It's just… I'm the one assigned to his case and any clue that would help me find him will really help the investigation."
"Can I help you?"
"For people of magic and magical creatures, please proceed to Building B where you will be assisted accordingly."
"Luna!" Harry greeted as the blonde witch hugged him. "How are you? How's the trip?"
And so he did.
The rest of the group exchanged pleasantries with the newcomers, kissing each other's cheeks, clapping each other's back, and, most importantly, handing over their gifts to the newlyweds. These gifts were set on the coffee table in the living room for them to open together after dinner.
"My apologies, Auror Potter," he said, turning towards Harry with a blank expression. He noticed that Adhil's hand was on his chest, feeling for something. It was probably the pendant that hung from the silver chain on his neck. "I haven't seen nor heard from Draco Malfoy at all."
"The vaults, the properties, the investments. All of them were left in my name."
Ron's eyes widened in realization.
"You better be decent, Potter!" Yelled the ever-so-familiar and ever-so-annoying voice that Harry has been accustomed to hearing for the past five years. The door was then slammed open and Harry swears that he felt the entire house rattle. "Oh, thank Merlin."
Something sparked inside Harry when he heard Adhil say his name. Like the voice itself, it was so familiar and yet so foreign.
"Yes," He said so quietly, not willing to risk anyone hearing his words despite the square being relatively empty. "I am Draco… Malfoy. Draco Malfoy."
"Well, can't say I blame her too much though. I imagine I'd get to all sorts of crazy things if I'm mere months or even weeks away from death."
Harry was the one who deduced that these disappearances might be connected despite the difference in the victims' profiles. He saw the pattern by which these wizards disappeared; no signs of struggle, no evidence left, not even a magical signature implying that the unsub either didn't use magic or went through the means of covering up their tracks, and all gone roughly a week apart. Harry's belief was further strengthened by the disappearance of the latest victim. His ability to come up with these conclusions is the reason why he rejected the Head Auror position when it was offered to him. Solving these puzzles, connecting evidence that doesn't seem to be connected at first glance, and thinking outside the box, thinking like the criminal. That's what brings most of the excitement in Harry's life. Being Head Auror will reduce his job to just signing stacks of paperwork and dealing with the bureaucracy and politics of the workplace. He figured that he would go insane on the first day.
Harry's brows furrowed as he looked down at his table. If what "Kevin" is saying is true, then that could be the work of wizards illegally meddling into Muggle medicine. The wizarding world has long discovered the cure for cancer. It was a potion that the patient had to take regularly everyday for around two to three months, depending on their initial health status. This is why wizards and witches live on for atleast a hundred years. They don't let physical and biological ailments take their lives. They will only either die from old age, murder, or a magical disease. Nowadays, cancer is in the same league as a really intense flu, to the wizarding world at least. It was awful to have it, yes. But it's not the end of the world.
That caused the slowly rising anger in Harry's chest to quickly fizzle and die down.
Potter was panting lightly by the end of his tirade. His face was painted with frustration and his hand reached up to lightly rub his temples. Draco's locket must still be working but only barely.
Malfoy declined the Hogwarts teaching position, a job that will take hin to far greater places than London. Malfoy declined that in favor of staying by his side, as his editor (and glorified assistant, his mind supplied).
"Plebian." Draco muttered, rolling his eyes. "You got crumbs all over the sofa, Potter."
The use of the old nickname almost made Harry frown if only he didn't detect a slight fondness embedded into the way Malfoy said it. That made Harry feel warm, similar to how he felt upstairs after bickering with the blonde git.
"You have established a respectable and admirable career, yes." Severus argued. "But at what cost? Instead of upholding the name of Malfoy and restoring its former glory, you abandon it in favour of being a wizard with no past, no family, and no friends.
"One of Draco's friends mentioned an apprenticeship here in Lyon and… I overheard a couple of Muggles talk about a revolutionary cancer treatment program here." Harry explained, intentionally leaving out the part where he first went to France all those years ago . "Of course, Muggles still haven't come up with a cancer treatment method that is as effective as the Cell Cleansing Potion, so I assumed that it's the work of wizards. I do admit that I'm stretching it out by assuming that Draco is involved in this but he has always been a smart and talented student at Hogwarts. I wouldn't be surprised if he is – involved, I mean. Now, if that's not the case, I was hoping to atleast ask well-known Potions Masters around here to know if they've seen him."
"To normal people, no." The woman said. "But to me, your stature screams 'law enforcement' but there's…"
A sharp intake of breath.
"How's it going, Angie?" Harry greeted once they caught sight of Angelina on the till, ringing up a kid's purchase.
"Yeah, mate. Act like I haven't known you for two decades and like I wasn't there at Luna and Pansy's." Ron teased, finishing the last bites of his food and chugging down his beer pint to wash it all down. "Don't let Hermione know that you're still on Malfoy's case though, Harry. Unless you want her to…what's that word…psychomanalize, you."
"When did you last see Draco Malfoy?"
It was just his luck that Potter is one of those people to barge back into his life.
"Uh…Evans. James Evans."
"I guess we should just wait?"
The two wizards walked along the sidewalks. They passed by the square of Place Sathonay as they headed towards the café on the side opposite from where they came from.
He knew the answer the moment it came across his mind.
Harry thought long and hard as he sat there, his beer turning warm with every minute that passes. He's wondering if he should report this to the Ministry so that he can official permission to investigate or if he should just go there by himself and pray to whatever deity that what he heard tonight will lead him to the person that he's been looking for all these years.
She was just about to leave when Perkins' voice caught their attention.
Harry's mind ran a hundred miles a minute. The conclusion that made the most sense to him was also the wildest one that he could think of.
"Expelliarmus!"
"You're wizards?!" Joseph yelled at the two Aurors.
Harry and Ron ordered a basket of fish and chips with vinegar and two pints of beer. Harry figured that they really shouldn't be drinking on duty but having anything but beer will definitely arouse suspicion.
"Yes. And, before you ask, no. I am not going to divulge the details. You might interrupt her work." Draco answered. "Clearing your name from any speculations and ensuring that you live a relatively peaceful life whether or not you do become the next Dark Lord is just some of the favours that I asked Pansy to do in-exchange for the Malfoy fortune."
"He would've stayed for good too but his wife will have his head if he did." Harry joked then pretended to glance at the bartender's name tag. "So, Joseph, what brings you to England?"
Adhil Blanchet. A world-renowed Potions Master despite only making a name for himself in the recent years. He is the true brain behind the hospital's cancer treatment program.
"I should get going too." Harry said, a few moments after Blaise left. He went on over to Pansy and Luna and hugged the two of them, giving each woman a kiss on the cheek. "It was really nice to spend some time with the two of you. Congratulations again. I look forward to having you back on Game Nights to whoop Blaise's and Neville's asses."
"You're literally holding your wand, Parkinson." Harry replied but he was already standing to get the package. It was a medium sized golden pouch that seemed to hold two boxes inside. Harry tapped his wand on it to check for jinxes. When the scan came up clear, he picked it up and turned it in his hand to check for any tags that would indicate who the sender is.
Adhil was in his potions lab, stirring the final batch of Better Pepper-Up Potion included in this week's order when several knocks that reverberated throughout his house disturbed him.
"Yes, indeed!" She exclaimed. "We have received several recognitions in the past year alone, both Muggle and Magical might I add. The usual cancer treatment potions usually take around two months at the earliest to take full effect, correct?"
The ceremony started after a short while. A Ministry official stood by the wedding arch as all of the guests stood to wait for the brides to walk down the aisle.
Eight years after his disappearance, Draco Malfoy was spotted in Diagon Alley yesterday with none other than Harry Potter who has quit the Auror force no less than two years ago and has since lived a private life.
"No," the blond answered simply. "The face that you're seeing right now is my face. The face of Draco Malfoy. Your mind will just be unable to make that connection between the face and the name."
"But, the last two spells performed by his wand included Fiendfyre."
"So," Harry began in an effort to break the slightly awkward silence that's forming between them "What did you mean about my stubbornness? It's not like we've known each other for long…unless…"
Vartan then glanced at their wristwatch before standing up.
The Auror office was left befuddled. They had no leads, no evidences. The victims had nothing in common aside from their genders and that they all went missing in South Kensington. They couldn't really focus on The Crystal since only a portion of the victims have been in the establishment. Acknowledging the fact that they have reached a temporary dead end, the Auror office have assigned some of their workforce to patrol the area of South Kensington in hopes of preventing any new disappearances. This course of action worked for the most part. Although the Aurors were exhausted due to the strict patrol shifting that added to their already heavy workload, no one went missing in the days that followed. Even Muggles felt the presence of the authorities since Robards coordinated with the Muggle Police to set up patrols as well. However, if one would ask any of the Aurors on-duty, they want nothing more than to catch whoever the culprit is so that they can go back to their regular work schedules.
"As you all know, we have been having difficulties with The Missing Wizards case due to lack of leads and evidence," The Head Auror immediately started after Harry took a seat. "However, just this morning, the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes was alerted to a mishap in a store in the outskirts of London. I'll let Obliviator Charles fill you in on the details."
"Hi, yes. Um…" Harry started to say. He was having a hard time figuring out what to say. Should he go direct to the point again or should he approach from a different angle? He decided to just wing it. "I was at the main building inquiring about your cancer treatment program? I…I was given forms and it said that I should head here for further assistance. You see, my aunt has cancer…breast cancer. She's a Muggle and my family heard about this place and how you're the leading facility for cancer treatment."
Harry hummed in reply to his bestfriend's statement, sitting down on the dining chair in front of Ron and sipping from his own mug.
"Potter, you were there that night. You saved him yourself. It would take another war and an extreme necessity for him to attempt to cast that deadly spell again."
"Of course," He said. "I'll always come back to you. Thank you, Draco. I love you."
"Not personally, no." Vartan replied with a shake of their head as they took another bite of chow mein. "I read his research paper about the possible use of belladonna extract to accelerate cell repair. It was interesting so I offered him a position amongst our trainee staff despite the numerous protests against it. However, my owl came back unopened. I guess it never even reached its destination."
It was an entire arm, from shoulder to hand, rotting and greyish. Its palm was bent backwards at an angle that would be impossible for a living human to achieve. Its fingertips were turning black, the colour starting to spread althroughout the hand. It seems like the preservation charms didn't do their work after all judging by state of decay that the arm was currently in. Harry can handle images of greying flesh but what made him uneasy was the way that the arm seemed to have been separated from the rest of the body. The cutting spells that he knew made swift clean cuts similar to how those machines work in the deli shop. However, the arm in the picture looks like it was forcefully torn apart from its joint. The tendons were still jutting out from the end and the skin had an irregular pattern that resembled roughly ripped paper. That alone told Harry that whoever did this, they did it out of pure rage and hatred.
"It seems like your fates are intertwined no matter how hard you try to run away from it." Severus commented, sitting back  on the armchair. "You have always been obsessed with him and I do recall a time when that feeling was mutual."
"Mr. Potter," Brunnar greeted him curtly. "To what do I owe this visit? Not about to steal our dragons are we?"
. "Now what brings you to my shop,
The only information that he got out of the wizard was the name and address of the Potions Master as well as his role in the hospital's program.
"Magical Signature Detector," Ron explained. "In all honesty, we could've come up with a much cooler name but after working on that thing for hours, we didn't really have much energy left to think of complicated names."
"Draco Malfoy." Harry said slowly and clearly to the room. He looked around to see the surprised look on everyone's faces. Well, everyone aside from Pansy and Blaise. Even Daphne and Millicent's foreheads were scrunched in both confusion and absolute shock. The two other Slytherins, on the other hand, have matching calculating looks. Their gazes were fixed on the pouch in Harry's hand, brows furrowed at the slightest.
"Agkras, Mr. Potter. Pleased to make your acquaintance." The goblin, Agkras, greeted with a smile. Well, it was less of a smile and more of a grimace. Harry has nothing against goblins but they really don't have the kindest of expressions. "I'm the goblin in charge of the Malfoy vaults. Brunnar told me that you need to view the Malfoy bank statements, correct?"
The blond breathed in deeply before sighing in defeat.
"Yes but it would be extremely difficult," Hermione interjected. "There are a lot of factors involved: the exact coordinates of the place, the distance from the sender to the receiver, the wards that protect the property. Not to mention enchantments or spellworks in the object to be transported that should remain intact all throughout the process."
There were no traces left. No body was found, be it human or house elf. They couldn't even track where the Malfoy family's house elves were.
"Harry--" Harry heard Hermione worriedly call out his name, probably concerned at the way that he's acting. He couldn't blame her though. He also couldn't blame any of his friends. All this time they thought that he has already given up on finding Draco. Harry has kept his investigation private, not involving anyone else but himself lest he gets dubbed as obsessive once again.
Flowers. More flowers. More daffodils. And roses. This time it was roses that came with the daffodils and not baby's breath flowers. The roses were shaded compared to the daffodils that are only drawn as outlines.
The incident was a mess. The whole afternoon was a mess. Aurors and officials alike were baffled at what is now dubbed as the "Malfoy Manor Case".
"When the person uses magic, the glow becomes darker."
The other item that he has retrieved from his bag is slightly worn out seeing as it was given to him only weeks ago. The brown tag that was attached to Luna and Pansy's wedding gift may be rumpled at the edges but the illustration on it was still clear and recognizable.
"Am I? At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if I am. I've been looking for Draco Malfoy – for you – for five years!" The Auror exclaimed that last part, throwing his hands up in the air. "I've had absolutely NO leads for the better part of those years! Did I take a smidgen of a hint and thought that it'll lead me to him...to you? Probably. But I'm here aren't I? At first, I was disappointed that Draco Malfoy wasn't the one to greet me at the door of your house but once Sonya noticed the Masidec glow in your shop, that's when I started to suspect the truth.
"The Masidec?"
Harry nodded and fished a tiny folder from his robe pockets before tapping his wand on it, resizing the item into its original state. With another wave of his wand, the folder and its contents duplicated itself and flew in front of all the other Aurors present in the room.
"Sonya told me about that thing – a pendant or a talisman – he's wearing. It was glowing…and when she pointed it out to him, his head started to hurt. It must be his subsconscious fighting against the enchantments of my locket." Adhil explain before scoffing. "He's not even here on official Auror business."
"I thought The Leon Berard Cancer Center was the leading cancer institute in France?"
Harry stood there uneasy as the silence was drawn out longer than before. All he could hear was the sound of his own heart beating as well as the soft blowing of the breeze. He thought about knocking again but the Auror only took a deep breath. For some reason, his body felt tense as if he's waiting for something… or someone. His hands were tingling with nerves to a point where it was almost painful. He took another deep breath while clenching and unclenching his fists in an attempt to calm himself down.
"Anyways, she's planning on permanently moving to France," Kevin continued. "Something about how it'll help her fully recover. I asked her if she plans to buy a house in Paris but no, the old spritely hag wants to live in a countryhouse in Lyon. Makes sense, if you ask me. She can just pop in at the hospital anytime she wants if she's feeling sick again…or if the medicine has any side effects."
The latest body part to appear was quite strange and the Auror office didn't even want to associate it with the others. They think that it's the work of a different criminal, a different wizard. It was only when Harry himself went to the scene did he confirm that it has a huge possibility of being related to the case.
He wonders what it feels like to wake up every day knowing that his job is something he is truly passionate about. If he was going to be completely honest with himself, being an Auror isn't giving him the satisfaction that it usually did. Most of the time, he's stuck at his desk signing paper work for solved cases. There are still some days when he gets called into an exciting case where he can do what he does best: chase the bad guys. However, that opportunity rarely comes. He's been thinking about becoming a Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts but there are currently no job openings for the position and he's kind of nervous about what his friends and family would say. After all, being an Auror was expected of him. Not to mention the fact that he has already been an Auror for a decade.
"You reckon we can bribe Emilia for the recipe?" Harry pondered after they've both read Hermione's letter. "Or should we just bring them tins of cookies?"
For Malfoy to do this, to officially make him a part of a family – the Black family, no less – it brought strong emotions to Harry. Emotions that are now all swirling inside him and are threatening to bring tears to his eyes. The sense of belongingness upon realizing that he can now call Andy and Teddy his family. The hope that the three of them can rebuild the wicked reputation of the House of Black, something that Harry is sure that both Sirius and Andy will appreciate. The sadness of remembering Sirius and how he wouldn't be here to see it. And finally, admiration. Admiration for Malfoy. Admiration in knowing that in his final moments in the place that he called "home" for so many years, in his final moments before he decided to leave, he has still managed to make a change. A change that is so different from what is expected of him. A positive one. Something that brings fortune and hope to the right people, the good people. This time, it wasn't because he was asking for recognition or merit. This was done without anyone else's knowledge. All of the deposits to those other vaults and charities were named under an "Anonymous Benefactor". Malfoy did it because he thought these people deserved it. He did it – dare Harry say it – out of the goodness of his heart. He may have also done it because of guilt brought upon by his past actions. Whatever the reason may be, his recent deeds were still what could only be defined as good.
"Yeah."
The Auror saw a soft smile tug at the corner of the blond's mouth.
"No, it's not!" Harry suddenly burst out, louder than he intended it to be. It had the desired effect of stopping whatever it was the Ron and Hermione was about to say. However, Harry knew that his tone was less than friendly and that resulted into a nasty and sour feeling slowly creep its way from his heart to all of his limbs. He took a deep breath and ran both his hands over his hair. "Look, I'm sorry… It's just… I have to find him. I don't know why, I don't how. I just have to. Maybe I owe it to Malfoy's mother for saving me. Maybe I owe it to her to ensure that her son will live a happy life with his friends instead of being alone in a strange place. Honestly, I'm confused myself but I have to do this. I have to."
Harry shrugged.
Harry pushed away any thought of aggression. Instead, he stood up and leaned his own body against the table to face Draco.
Harry shook his head and went upstairs.
"Th…That's impossible."
"Aww… don't be like that, sweets." The man slurred, tightening his grip on the struggling waitress. "You can join us if you want."
Those were the first things that Harry Potter got a whiff of once he opened the front door. His lips immediately quirked into a soft smile as he imagined the scene that's already waiting for him.
Hôpital Edouard Herriot was originally purely a Muggle facility, only catering to non-magic folks. However, with the changing of tides, witches and wizards have also started working in Muggle hospitals, using magic to accelerate the healing of their patients and also educating themselves on the advancement of Muggle medicine and technology.
"Teddy's starting Hogwarts next year," Harry mentioned. "Everyone thinks that he's going to be Slytherin or even a Gryffindor but I think he's going to be a Hufflepuff."
"That's confidential information. Have you seen him anywhere recently?"
"The Vanishing spell can be a possible base for a more complex spell." Blaise said from his seat, breaking his own silence. He looked pensive, holding the glass of wine in his hand and staring at the fire flickering in the fireplace.
Harry pointed to a few more potions, letting the other man explain what they are and how they work. He found himself enjoying hearing about these potions despite not being good at them during his school years.
"What's that thing on your chest anyway?" Adhil asked, breaking the silence between them. "It has been glowing for quite some time now. Is it going to explode?"
Hermione's here? It seems like the Department of Mysteries were also called upon to address whatever has happened on this property.
" is the go-to potions shop in Wizarding Paris.
"How I liked my tea."
"So, are you saying that Malfoy's magic was powerful enough to rip through the regulations set by the Ministry as if they were cotton candy?" Harry perused.
Harry sat in his study for a few more hours before going to bed that night. He laid out the pouch and box Luna gave him on the desk to examine. A few more spells told him that there really isn't any trace of magic left on the pouch itself, which is odd since if a spell was used to transport it then there should still be residual spellwork. Harry thought that maybe it was too subtle to detect.
Twitter:
"Me too." Harry sighed and finished his beer. "I'll have Grunhild and Thimble get more information about this pub and its staff. We need to get their names to find out if any of them are wizards or witches."
"Do whatever the fuck I want?" Harry started to say as he pushed himself off the table and slowly walked over until he was face-to-face with the blond. Draco looked at him warily. "Anything?"
"He's a convicted Death Eater, is he not?"
The Auror was pulled away from his thoughts of admiring the interior design when a cup of tea was placed in front of him. He muttered a quick thanks to Adhil and proceeded to add two sugars in his tea along with a splash of milk. He hummed at the first sip of the hot beverage. It tasted perfect. Just like how he made it back home.
"I sure hope you have a pensieve lying about." Parkinson said. "If you have any more questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them the next time you visit. For now, I have more urgent matters to attend to. These papers are very time sensitive and should be taken care of immediately."
"Exactly," Malfoy said. "Who's going to drag your ass out of bed every morning to make sure that you're a fully functioning member of society? You would die without me, Scarhead."
"Funny story, actually--" Ron said around a mouthful of sausages. He swallowed and downed his food with some pumpkin juice. "I got the idea from Malfoy's gift."
Harry chuckled and pressed a soft kiss on Draco's forehead.
Malfoy went ahead downstairs, leaving Harry alone.
Despite knowing the package's origin, Harry still cast the usual curse detection spells. It has become a habit by now what with all the fan mail, hate mail, and death threats that he has been getting since he was still a student at Hogwarts.  Once the box has been deemed clean and curse free, Harry carefully opened it to reveal several vials of potions inside along with a folded sheet of paper. The paper held a short note along with instructions about the potions.
It was a fancier pub than the two Aurors were used to. It had an industrial feel to it with steel beams serving as posts and the light bulbs being enclosed in large glass spheres. The walls lacked any wallpaper which served its purpose of adding to the ambience with the help of the unpainted concrete and exposed brick walls. The floor was made of varnished wooden planks adorned with hexagonal pieces of varying shades of brown.
Harry stopped listening to them midway. He was stuck at a particular word that Kevin said. Lyon. Lyon, France. It was awfully familiar
His two bestfriends glanced at each other before Ron took a deep breath and spoke.
"You've successfully outdone yourself, mate." Ron commented, patting Harry's shoulder.
"I'm afraid I can't help you with that one, lads," He said. "I'm fairly new here as well and the only tourist spots I know are those that you probably already know."
"Who would've thought that vodka can increase a potions effectiveness."

Adhil…or Draco stared at Harry for a long time after the latter's outburst. He was beginning to wonder if the blond even heard what he said but before he can speak, Draco…or Adhil abruptly stood up.
A few minutes into their meal, Harry and Ron heard a rumbustious laugh from the nearby table. They turned their heads to see a red-faced man gripping one of the waitresses by the wrist in an attempt to pull her onto his lap. The waitress was struggling against the man's grip while looking around for help with alarmed eyes. This seemed to be a common occurence in the pub, judging by the look on the other patrons' faces. Some of them only looked at the scene in amusement before tucking back into their meals. All the while, the waitress was still trying to pry herself from the man's firm grip. Ron was just about to stand up and intervene when the other waitress rushed to her co-worker's side.
"I disillusioned myself and watched everyone from the window." Ron shrugged, popping another chip into his mouth. "The thing is, we can't arrest her until there's probable cause."
"It's okay…" Potter said softly. "I want to see you, to recognize you again."
"P-Pardon me?" The blond spluttered. He had a feeling that Potter already knew who he is but he didn't think that he would directly and bluntly reveal that he does. "Draco? Draco Malfoy? You must be mistaken, Mr. Potter."
Harry wandlessly casted a Muffliato charm to prevent the Muggles from hearing what they are not meant to hear. He then held up the glowing pendant of the Masidec to his face.
"Oh! You're--" The receptionist made a random gesture of waving her pointer finger in the air like it was a wand. Harry merely nodded. "Why didn't you say so?! No worries, no worries! Okay, down the east hall, there's a door labelled 'STAFF ONLY'. It's warded against Muggles so you don't have to worry about being followed whatsoever. There are several Floos inside that room. Just take your pick and say 'Building B'. It'll take you to the other part of our hospital."
Thank you so much for reading! 🥰
He was just about to relax, thinking that the Masidec might be malfunctioning and that the culprit isn't really here when something – rather, someone – caught his eye. Harry didn't stare or looked at the person longer than necessary. Instead, he continued to look around, trying his best not to let this person know that he has noticed her.
"I came here because Healer Vartan gave me your name and address," Harry continued. "He said that, you're the most renowed Potions Master as of late and anyone who's seeking an apprenticeship will go to you."
I hope you'll look forward to more of my works in the future! 🥰
The young man sighed and cast a Stasis charm over the cauldron. He then took off his dragonhide gloves and went upstairs to see who his visitor was.
Pansy sighed and went back to the  papers in front of her. She loves Draco like family but she truly abhors the fact that he left her with a shit ton of documents that she needed to meticulously read before signing. She glanced at the clock and saw that it was 1:42PM so she poured herself another drink.
"Not very often. Once every two months maybe. And I've only started writing to her a year ago." Draco explained, standing up to return the bottle of brandy to its proper place himself. "She's still quite cross with me."
A quick Tempus charm told him that it was just a little past midnight.
Harry rarely has the time to mull over his life, given his busy schedule but whenever he does, he finds that he is quite unsatisfied about what it has become. Yes, he has his friends that he loves and deeply cares for no matter how strange their circle has become. He doesn't have a mad man chasing him across the country intent on murdering him. He's a well-respected Auror and his life is mostly peaceful now since the excitement over "The Saviour" is wearing off. Harry really can't say that his life is boring because being an Auror is as exciting as it gets. They do have to deal with multitudes of paperwork after every case but there's still action in his line of work. However, despite the honour that goes with being an Auror, he doesn't really get the satisfaction that he expected. Despite the variety of cases that he gets involved in, he still thinks that his life has become monotonous in a not-so-good way. Harry thinks that he should like monotony. He thinks that he ought to appreciate it after almost eight years of being subjected to the unknown and not knowing whether he'll survive the next ordeal that he'll face. But he finds that he doesn't like this particular type of monotony.
Harry remembered the letter. Malfoy wrote that he would rather die than live another day as himself. He would rather die than bear the name of Malfoy any longer.
"What are you going to do?"
Apparently, Parkinson misinterpreted Harry's reaction.
Daffodils.
"I'll see you tomorrow….prat." He teased. He felt rather than saw Malfoy roll his eyes. Harry chuckled and made to walk out. He stopped by the doorway and turned to face Malfoy who was just about to reach for the Dairy Milk bar. "You should take it, you know."
Meanwhile, the Muggles in the pub, including the staff, had their memories modified. Their minds were filled with false memories of just deciding to go back home and sleep. The injured cook was patched up and sent home with modified memories as well. The Aurors helped with cleaning the place while Harry and Ron invited Joseph and Julia to the Ministry to get their testimonies as well as explain to them what exactly happened. In the end, they the two pub owners accepted their explanation as well as the compensation for the damage done to their place. They even invited the two Aurors back to The Crystal just to chat. Joseph and Julia often stayed away from the wizarding part of England but they think that it's still nice to have some wizard friends.
A sudden crack of apparition from behind them disrupted their conversation. The four of them turned to see Pansy Parkinson with her hands slightly held up as Aurors pointed their wands at her. Parkinson did not say a word, instead she resorted to challengingly look at the people apprehending her with a single raised brow. Harry told the Aurors to lower their wands and continue to investigate the house. Parkinson spared them a single haughty look before walking over to where the Malfoy family's peacocks are. Naturally, the trio followed her while Perkins was put in-charge of extinguishing the everlasting fire.
Harry sat up straighter, wanting to observe every single reaction that Vartan gives him. They seem to know Draco and Harry is prepared to do whatever it takes to get information if that familiarity is on a personal level.
Harry let out a laugh and reached into his pocket to get his gift for the newlyweds. He held it out to the two of them with a cheerful "Congratulations". The package was small. A box that fit right into one's palm.
I will always be grateful to everyone who has given this fic a chance. Thank you so much for reading!
"Oh, the Masidec? It's doing great actually! George and I reinforced the crystal sphere to be able to hold dark magic. It's still quite unstable and it can break easily if it falls on the ground but it works."
Harry set his own cup down – appreciating the beautiful floral details that it has – before replying.
Years of being read, re-read, and analyzed have worn out both the envelope and the paper quite a bit. However, its message was still readable. The wax seal of Draco's letter was still in tact and that is all Harry needs.
He should've expected this. He did intend for this to happen at some point in time but not so soon. It was too soon. And he was alone in Muggle clothes. No Auror partner. No backup.
Letters.
Knowing what the box was, what the figures on top of it symbolized, and what it may hold, Pansy knew what she had to do. She looked around and spotted a short piece of wood that she transfigured into a simple dagger.
"Call me Adhil," the blond clarified, with a frown. "We're roughly the same age, Mr. Potter. Addressing me by my last name makes me feel like I'm as old as Merlin himself."
It turns out that, no… Auclair wasn't as willing to answer any of Harry's questions as Vartan made him out to be.
His eyes scanned every single detail on Draco's face: from the strands of platinum locks that fell over his forehead to the slightly upturned nose down to his lips that looked so soft, Harry almost wanted to touch them.
Now, I would very much appreciate it if you stop whatever enchantment you've got going on because, I swear to God, my head is about to explode from all of these conflicting thoughts."
"That's true," Ron agreed. "I say let's go back here tomorrow as different Muggles and see what happens. Maybe we can even strike up a conversation with the bartender. This place looks good but it makes me uneasy. I got a feeling that what we just saw happens on a regular basis."
There goes Harry's hopes of tracking the movement of Malfoy's money to see where he will spend it and where he could be.
"Hate to say it but she's right," Ron said, reaching for another serving of food. "If Malfoy really did blow up the Manor and left without a trace – which he did – who's to say he's not hiding out in some far off country right now? Either that or he's dead."
"Is it…a mailing stamp?" Pansy inquired with genuine confusion in her eyes as she picked up the small image and held it up. It looked like a mailing stamp but instead of paper, the image was printed on a tiny canvass enclosed in a wooden frame.
"I know this box…" Pansy whispered, more to herself than to the others as she inspected the wooden box. From afar, it looked quite plain but if one looks closely, they will see intricate figures faintly painted all over it. The figures were that of different breeds of dragons. From the Chinese Fireball to the Peruvian Vipertooth. However, amongst all of these legendary beasts adorning the box, two stand out the most. While the other dragons were painted small, their illustrations taking up not more than half of a chocolate frog card, the two dragons in the middle seem to occupy most of the lid's area. Pansy frowned as she stared at the snoring figures of a Hungarian Horntail and an Antipodean Opaleye curled up together. She knew what these breeds were because Draco told her about it. Otherwise, she would be clueless due to the fact that these dragons were painted in the same rusted gold ink like the others. They didn't really stand out from the maroon lacquer of the box itself.
Adhil and Sonya watched him leave in silence.
"But--"
As always, kudos and comments are always appreciated.
The package was small, roughly the size of his entire palm. Harry removed the brown wrapping paper to reveal a black box that's simple and unassuming. Nothing was written on it to identify where it came from aside from the small wreath of flowers imprinted in gold at the bottom right of the lid. He vaguely recognized it as the symbol of "
Kudos and comments are always appreciated~ 💖
Joseph let out a breath that resembled a chuckle before cocking his head to the side.
Harry laid the three items next to each other with the letter from Sonya right in the middle. He aligned the illustrations together and inspected then closely.
As always, kudos and comments are always appreciated. Let me know what you think~
Hermione was just about to say something else when she was cut off by Pansy standing from the couch and swiftly snatching away the pouch in Harry's hand.
"Thank you." Harry said, gratefulness evident in his tone. Vartan gave him a small tired smile in return before walking out the door.
Sleep was anything but peaceful that night. He spent hours tossing and turning, a million thoughts passing through his head, all of which centered around one Draco Malfoy.
The portrait of Hogwarts' deceased Potions Master and war hero settled on the velvet arm chair painted in his frame. He took the book that's on the table near him and flipped through the pages nonchalantly.
"Auror Grunhild and Auror Thimble were both tasked to interview the victims' friends and relatives about their whereabouts," Harry began. "They have found out that our first three victims have all been to the same area days before their disappearance. South Kensington. Two of them, Grimbleton and Quinn, frequented a Muggle pub called 'The Crystal'. As for Mr. Rembrant, he actually arrived in the country a week before the conference started and have been to 'The Crystal' only once. I've already sent Grunhild and Thimble to ask around about Mr. Proudfoot's whereabouts before his disappearance."
Those thoughts haunt him everyday, reminding him to continue looking for Draco even if there are no leads for him to follow, no evidences for him to examine, and no witnesses for him to interrogate.
"Sir?"
Harry finally fell into a fitful sleep at 3AM.
The similarities between the main building of Hôpital Edouard Herriot and Building B is quite eerie. Everything is the same from the floors and walls down to the way the waiting chairs were lined up. If it wasn't for the hustle and bustle of wizards and witches as well as the gentle thrum of magic all around, Harry would've thought that he's still in the main building. It was quite obvious that the people around him are of magical descent. Most of them are wearing robes, both casual and work ones. Some of them also sported weird looking illnesses like growing another head or having their skin become translucent to a point where Harry could see the veins and vessels running throughout the wizard's arm. He knows that those aren't something that Muggles could have and can only be tragic results of a spell gone wrong.
"Potter, do you know what time it is?" Malfoy drawled, his voice laced with so much sarcasm that Harry had to wince. He should be used to this given the number of times that he has missed his deadlines. Sometimes, the other man's remarks doesn't affect him but Malfoy seems to be having a particularly bad day, judging by the tone of his voice.
Parkinson pulled another object from a different drawer. This time, it's a vial roughly the side of a thumb.  She removed the cork and placed it on the desk. She then took her wand and placed it on her temple. With closed eyes, she pulled out the silver glowing threads of her memories and placed it inside the vial before sealing it and handing it over to Harry.
"As head of the Ministry's Investigation Department, I would like to ask you a few questions regarding a case that we've been investigating for years." Harry replied, showing his Auror badge for good measure. "May I come in?"
"Maybe…" Parkinson murmured. "Being the only living Malfoy left is difficult. I had to stay with him for atleast a month after Narcissa's death. He was unstable yet no one saw that. He pulled off the mask of the perfect Lord impeccably but deep inside I know his heart was filled with grief. He couldn't even grieve properly what with all the legalities that had to be sorted out."
The next chapter will definitely be the LAST one and then we just have the epilogue left.
Harry can't exactly tell how or why but he can feel the magic pulsing from these two necklaces. They are obviously entwined with intricate spellwork.
"How are they?" Draco asked. "Edward and Andromeda?"
The Auror shook his head and tried to will his brain to think about what exactly he's here for: getting information.
"So, you and your Weasleys created this…device just to find me?" Draco asked, voice sounding confused, weirded out, and hopeful all at the same time.
"No." Was the blond's clipped response. "My apologies but I have to get back to my lab. My potions will not brew themselves. I trust that you can see yourself out."
"Wicked, am I right?" He heard George say. Harry went over to look at what the elder Weasley brother is working at. When Ron first mentioned that he and George were starting this little project for the Department of Mysteries, Harry assumed that the "device" would look like an actual device like a radio, a phone, or even a compass. Instead, he was presented with what looked like an amulet. A hollow looking crystal sphere rested in the middle of a silver plate with its edges inscribed with runes. The amulet itself hung from a black waxed cotton cord.
There's only the EPILOGUE left and we're OFFICIALLY DONE with "La Clarté"!
"Sometimes, I just feel like I've taken you away from everyone," Draco continued. "Your friends, your family… your home."
He would remain unconscious to the world for the next 12 hours.
Those were the only items inside the box.
Draco doesn't say anything. He just sighs. This is how Severus knew that he has finally won their argument that has been going on for a long time now. The blond just slumps on the arm chair, seemingly exhausted.
"We found something!"
"Are you absolute sure, mate? Flowers tend to look the same. Even flowers of the same species." Ron said, skeptical and a bit worried that Harry seems to have memorized every detail that's related to Draco.
Harry felt warm despite being in nothing but a pair of boxers and an old Chudley Cannons shirt. It must be the house. Some old magic or something. Harry shrugged and pulled on a more acceptable outfit for the breakfast table before making his way downstairs.
Harry nodded absentmindedly as he watched Celeste flip through the papers, double checking it.
"I'm the Head of the Investigation Department."
Harry stood there in silence. He didn't know what to say next.
I may have lied? Or atleast underestimated my own fic. I thought that I could fit the ending in one chapter but, alas, I couldn't.
The remaining group of Muggles were getting a bit rowdy. Harry only heard the squeal of one of the girls in the group before he saw the woman they were watching abruptly stand and brandish her wand at the man sitting beside the girl.
Draco went straight to the counter and ordered the usual: a large hot caramel macchiato and three chocolate biscuits. He was just about to reach pay for his food when an arm reached from his side and slid a €50 bill on the counter.
He stood still until he felt the chain go over his head, leaving his neck bare and his chest surprisingly light.
Harry was just signing the last of his paperworks when he heard three knocks on his office door. He looked up to see his secretary's head peeking from the slightly opened door.
"True, but you followed him around like mad! I'm still surprised that the Marauder's Map didn't rename itself to 'Draco Malfoy Surveillance Map'."
If only the young Auror wore the Masidec during the visit, he would see it glow the faintest of light blues.
"I was just wondering how you've managed to change the Cell Cleansing Potion's formula? It's an--"
Nevile's gift was a Wiggentree sapling that the newlyweds can plant outside. It can protect them against dark creatures, not that there's any imminent threat of a creature uprising but it's still such a touching gift.
Harry shrugged picked up his drink before sitting back and drinking from it. The two of them are now face-to-face, just watching each other. Harry took this opportunity to study the other man's face. Despite his rational mind already knowing the truth, he still couldn't place Draco's name on Adhil's face. He basically has to drill into his brain that yes, Adhil and Draco are the same person. He has to believe it. He finds himself doubting that belief even as he looks at Adhil but he only has to glance down at the Masidec's light blue glow re-affirm those doubts.
And with one last haughty look directed at them, she disapparated.
It read:
"I saw how you made it from your first visit, of course."
"Still…" Hermione tried to placate him. "You were never really rational whenever Malfoy is involved."
"Hey! Glad to see you again, mates!" They heard Joseph's voice greet them from behind the bar. Harry and Ron waved at him as they sat down. The bartender was currently tending to a line of customers. It was nearing closing time for The Crystal but since it was Friday evening, the pub still had quite a lot of people enjoying their food and drinks after a week's worth of hardwork.
However, Harry's still torn about reporting this to the Ministry. On one hand, it's completely illegal and, on the other, whoever the people behind this are they sound like they just really want to help people.
The shop was empty save for him, Adhil, and Sonya. The elderly woman that Adhil was assisting earlier was now done with her purchase and had just stepped out of the door. Harry knows that it wouldn't be empty for long. Adhil mentioned that "La Jonquille" had a slow but steady stream of customers. Most of their regular clients order their potions via owl post anyways.
Five seconds later, both Joseph and the cook were whirled out of the establishment and into St. Mungos where the latter would hopefully be attended to.
Harry nodded in understanding, packing up his notepad and quill along with the vial of Parkinson's memories.  There's indeed a pensieve in his office. It's necessary for the Investigation Department seeing as their work involves thorough examination of minute details and how they can be connected to each other to solve cases.
Three letters to be exact. Two of which were addressed to Pansy and the other one was addressed to…
"A gift from who?" Hermione asked, having heard what Harry said but not really understanding nor believing the words that came out from his mouth.
"Of course! But you already know what she said. There's a reason why they're Unspeakables."
"Harry, you have to open your mouth…" The blond pleaded. "This is just a Headache Potion."
symbol definitely has daffodils on it. The way that it was drawn was also similar to those on the wax seal and tag.
"Well, Hermione and I have been talking and…we thought that maybe you can hand over this case to the others. We know Robards put you in charge of it but…we also know how you are when it comes to Malfoy."
"I'd like to stay and chat but a time-sensitive potion is currently brewing in my lab and I should get back to it soon."
The two Aurors immediately got to their feet but the woman was quicker. She has already managed to cast an Entrail-Expelling Curse at the man, causing a mixture of blood and intestines to spill out from his abdomen to the floor. The group erupted into screams as the Muggles scrambled to help their friend and back away from the woman at the same time.
His wards were calm. Whoever was behind the door has no ill-intent towards him or anything in the property. They felt familiar too. Is it Vartan? What do they want? Or maybe it's Auclair? But either of them would definitely send an owl first before visiting.
Harry was breathless for a moment as his mind finally caught up with itself, as he finally recognized whose face he was staring at.
