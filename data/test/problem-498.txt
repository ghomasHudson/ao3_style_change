Draco left their little house with his trunk floating behind him and somewhat friendly waves from the neighbors that saw him and didn't completely hate him. Sometimes he wondered if his mother's house arrest was to protect her as much as it was to protect everyone else. If he got hexed by people outside of school he was scared of what people would do to his mother.
“The parents just fought an entire war with you Mr. Lupin. I think they would not feel hard-pressed to complain about your position. There also has been a dramatic increase in the werewolf population, due to Fenrir Greyback having free reign last year. Despite Severus being able to keep him away from Hogwarts. And Mr. Theodore is welcome to live there anytime.”
“If we add a few drops of an anti-wart potion that the store sells for acne then it should get rid of that side effects without causing more problems.” Draco suggested to Hermione before Harry dropped a book in between them and started begging for help.
They sit until Kingsley comes out flanked by two Aurors. “Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy have to come with us. Draco you're welcome to stay here considering the circumstances, However we ask you don't return to the Manor.’ He says softly ‘We’ll give you a moment to say goodbye.” He turns and heads inside leaving the two Auror’s out by the entrance.
“There was a lot of trauma both during the wars and before them for some of the people in this room. Almost none of it has been processed.' Arthur continued  'The whole world is going to struggle for some time. But if we do this now maybe we don't have to struggle as much later in life. Maybe at some point we can move past the war. Us four included.” He gestured to the four talking.
“Wait. Can you tell Your Master that I'm here? I need to speak to him. It’s Neville. Neville Longbottom.”
Remus looks at the floor as he speaks “Harry doesn't even know about Me and Sirius, granted we have a lot more issues to explain about that relationship. We were going to explain 4th year but Voldemort came back. The next year Sirius died. I just couldn't bring myself to talk.”
“Oh, he tried to teach me. It didn't end too well but I learned a little bit. I don't care about waking me up Draco, I'm glad you did, I just need you to not think of me any different when you find out what I'm afraid of.”
Hermione looked like she knew he was lying but thankfully didn't push. “Alright night Harry. We’re here if you need us.”
Draco stared down at the wand. The last thing he expected when Ellie got him was to see Potter at the door. He looked between Potter and the wand before speaking.
“Yes, maybe too well. Now I'm just confused on which opinion is correct and which one I should act according to.”
“Do-’ Draco starts timidly. ‘Do you all want to come meet my family? Hoffey, Blort, and Evedy leave soon to do the second cleaning of the properties.”
“Hello Mr. Potter it's time for dinner. The prisoner must return to his cell now.” The worker informed them then shutting the door again.
“Firstly, please don't call me Mr. Draco though I appreciate the sentiment, and secondly’ Draco quickly restored the boys robes wordlessly ‘There, your robes are as good as new. You ready?”
Draco said no then started and couldn't make it stop. “My healer Nydia asked me about my father and if I still loved him yesterday and I tried to write it down and I couldn't then I couldn't sleep now I've snapped at my mother, Chip, and you, only the people I care most about in this world. And I don't forgive him and I shouldn't love him but everytime the question comes up I don't have an answer. I should hate him for everything he's done, to mother, to me, to our family. Mother says she still loves him, but she knew him before the war and gets glimpses of the old him. I can't bring myself to hate him, since he's my father, but I don't know if I love him, I know I can't forgive him. What am I supposed to do Harry? What am I supposed to tell her next week when she asks? I can't be a bad son and hate him, but I'll hate it if I admit I love him and there's no in between.”
“Yes Hogwarts is the only home I’ve had. Well I guess this is home, feels kinda like it but it's still quite new. Hermione obviously said Yes she needs her N.E.W.T.S. Ron said something along the lines of ‘where you guys go I go’. So he’ll be returning as well."
James, Sirius, Harry, Fred, and George were on a team. While Ron, Ginny, Bill, Charlie, and Fluer were on a team.
Of course this was when Seamus interrupted with "The corridor that we were told would kill us painfully during first year?"
The Mansion was a busy place. Friends from the 1st and 2nd wars were visiting semi-frequently. The younger kids were introduced to the rest of the order.
“Mr. Malfoy has sustained a serious injury to his body. He’s stable now, but he’ll sleep for two or three days till he's lucid enough to hold a conversion. You can go into his room now”
“Hey’ Harry said, talking to the babies. ‘Meet your God parent’s Ron Granger-Weasley and Hermione Granger-Weasley.”
“As I said before, Draco is my priority, not myself or my husband. Thank you for saving my son more than once since he turned eleven as I hear it. You do not understand how much I owe you for this, I would suffer my husband's fate over and over as long as Draco is safe.”
Tonks worked with Kingsley and Robards so she could have the full week off with Teddy then work for a week while he was with Remus.
Harry brought Draco a drink and Draco gave him a kiss in thanks. Their friends started cheering and spelling confetti to fall.
Malfoy looks like he was surprised that he was asking but not closed off to answering. “I figured they were fine now so you wouldn't care whether they died or not.”
They looked at Minnie shocked. “But Professor, Remus is the only actual Professor out of us.” Lily said.
“Please, you went to Draco’s via fire call. And if it happens to help you to then it does. Sirius won't even be there.”
“I started questioning after Cedric’s Death. I know my father was there that night. He was only 3 years older than us and father let him die without a care in the world. I realized he committed to a madman.
“Harry, I want you to listen closely. I love your mother. I will always love your mother. I also love Regulus. Your mother knows and she fully supports our relationship. I love them both equally. They love me back, but they dont love each other.”
Draco still blew up every now and again and Harry still refused blame and hid important things but they were finally okay. They were finally free.
“No Draco that was good. I want you to keep adding to those opinions as we move forward. Now I want to ask you some questions they're very invasive and personal, but it's the only way I can help you. Are you ready for this?”
They continued talking till Narcissa said they should all head to bed. When they got to Dracos room, he started looking around the room at some of his sketches and the bookshelf which looked like it had a whole row of handwritten notebooks. He went to pick one up to see what was in it when Draco stopped him.
“I hate both of you.’ He did NOT pout. ‘I have to leave soon anyway. I still don't know how you got me to agree to this mind-healer crap.”
“I’m aware I'm not scheduled to go home for another week, but I came to ask permission to go now. The ministry has unfrozen our accounts and I find it would be best to speak to my mother now.”
“Yeah.’ Harry sat on the edge of his bed, hands collapsed and head down. ‘I’m sorry for what I said earlier about telling people things.”
That one is probably the best. No lingering Dark Magic, Magical community away from Muggles, Not too far from Kings cross for Hogwarts.”
“Well, last time we talked you still had a great deal of anger toward him. You are in a better place now, so I think we should see how you feel about him now.”
The crowd Gathered around Harry, Ron and Hermione were the 1st to reach him. He thought he could see his parents and Sirius and Remus coming behind them. He closed his eyes and focused on breathing.
“Sirius, He’s already in love with you. You're just asking him to go on a Valentine's date.” James chuckled.
I knew then, blood, supremacy, none of it matters. I was taught Family over everything, You should always choose your Family, He lied. If he could lie about that, everything else I believed in was a lie as well.” Draco shut his drapes and cast his silencing spells.
My name is Narcissa Black Malfoy. I understand I possess no right to ask anything from you, but I beg you if you can, please testify on behalf of Draco the wednesday next at noon. His actions were forced by fear of Voldermort and loyalty to his father. I realize now that my son lied to Bellatrix and recognized you at our manor. My Draco is still just a lost boy who was forced into a war much like yourself I believe. I do not ask for anything for myself or my husband but please help my son however much you can.
“Yeah. Your Family already knows. Mother knows. We could tell our friends in the next month or so. Then go on a date. A public one.” Draco fidgeted with his necklace.
“Okay, mother. You’ll stay here? Both of you?” After Draco got nods from both he went to the fireplace and went to Nydias.
Andromeda went to catch her. Draco asked the room to close as quickly as he could. Regulus and Sirius chased down the one escaped shot of Magic and cleansed it before it could spread. Everybody at the end of the Hall came into the Barrier and stood next to the circle.
“It’s Petunia. They think Dudley’s child could be magical. Her mom left her on Dudley’s doorstep when she was a newborn. She’s almost 4 now. Petunia says she is doing some of the same ‘weird’ stuff Harry did when he was little.”
“Harry… come on. Remember it's better to talk about it.” Hermione reminds him. She and Ron were working on Harry opening up more.
Barty Crouch Jr. who was a death eater polyjuiced as mad-eye, demonstrated unforgivables in class and tried to kill me.
“You could do it Harry. You have the political power. The right Ideas. Ideas that people would probably push to welcome into the new world cause they’re so scared of another Voldemort. And you have the stubbornness to learn what you need to to get it done. If you start close to home start with Hogwarts and build out. You could change our world Harry, more than you already have.”
A few minutes later the gates fade into the air. He walks up and knocks on the door to Malfoy Manor. Draco Malfoy opens it a minute later.
There wasn't much to do in Azkaban. If I was really bored I’d pick a fight with Bellatrix. Of course the Dementors came around. But I had 12 years of If’s Harry. They didn't do me a single ounce of good. You can't think about If’s. There really is no If after the fact. It’s not a viable thought. You have to force yourself not to think about it.’ Sirius gently pulled Harry into a hug. ‘It’s not your fault Harry.”
Mr. Black the youngest would teach Arithmancy, His N.E.W.T. Score has yet to be beat. Professor Vector has decided to teach further education of Arithmancy.
And Draco’s morning rush over the previous day’s events crashed. Hard. He continued reading before a hand came into his eyesight.
“Draco, Hey are you really awake?, and yes your hair is very soft., and you're not dreaming, you're in St. Mungos.” Harry said while getting a cup of water and chuckling at Draco.
Draco stares at his magazine before he closes it. He sits up straight and swings his legs over the bed. He pulls a worn copy of the prophet from beneath his pillow and tosses it in Harry’s lap then stares straight ahead.
“I think some of it was the horcrux. And some of it was they just hated magic, hated the fact they had to take care of me. Petunia always seemed to go quiet when Vernon
He had been slyly avoiding his mother the last 4 days, hoping that she would not want to talk about his father, but knowing she would want to talk about him. His father is the reason they were in this mess, he was the one that pledged to Voldemort, he was the one who made Draco pledge in order to protect his mother, he was the reason Draco was tainted and would never be the boy who existed before sixth year. So lost in his angry thoughts toward his father he missed his mother knocking until she came into his room.
“Yeah, but I can go get a new one. Plus the wand may work for me and it may be powerful but it's still yours, it just doesn't feel the same, it doesn't get me. You know what I mean?” Harry said smiling, remembering Dracos words in the room of requirement the first time he tried to get his wand back.
“Welcome back to Hogwarts’ McGonagall started after the sorting finished. There weren't many slytherins even though some came back to fight with the light side. ‘Last year was a dark time. This year the war is over. Voldemort is dead. It will take time for recovery. Even with people being returned the pain still exists. Due to this the floo network has been installed in Hogwarts for firecalling. At any time you can go into the new rooms set up for this on the second floor. You may call family if you're struggling. We also have resources for a team of mind-healers should you wish for one. We wish for you to use this.
It will also serve as a safe house for magical children that live in an abusive or oppressive home. Even so far as to house muggle-born children whose families don't approve of magic.
“Of course darling you wrote them, but you may not get rid of any, there's a reason I'm keeping them.”
“I’ll go get her.’ Harry floo’s while Draco pulls Scorpius back in. He comes back less than 30 seconds later with a very prepared and packed Narcissa. She joins Draco and Scorpius in their hug. ‘He broke into our house. Even with the bullshit paper he used to get out it breaks his probation. What do you want to do?”
Each new professor got their own set of connected rooms. It was more set up like the dorm rooms then private quarters.
“Space Harry.’ Remus told him. ‘You give him space to get his thoughts together. You push him too fast and he’s just going to run farther away.”
On the bright side, with Hermione and Draco busy, Harry and Ron had time to think a lot about their future.
“Well’ Hermione sighed. ‘He’s not wrong. Draco probably needs to hear something from you. He's like this because other people said something, you can probably fix it by saying something else.”
Lily breaks the settled silence. “Would someone like to give us the cliffnotes of the last 18 years?”
While Hogwarts had to recover, so did Hogsmeade. Once the twins took over Zonkos they started to help the other Hogsmeade owners. They had lost so much money from death eaters that took what they wanted that the only reason they stayed open was because of the Hogwarts children. They saw the destruction of the school during that year and refused to leave the kids. So Fred & George helped support them until they could stand on their own.
“If the potion would be available and there would be multiple precautions to ensure another incident didn't happen, I would like to teach again.” Remus relented.
“I wanted to see you. You finished your eighth year by now. If you were going off to some unknown place to live your life I wanted to see you before I wasted away in here.” Lucius explained
“Alright that's good. Calm down Harry. I’m sorry. I didn't mean any of it. I just needed you to be angry.”
Chip ended up going to Ravenclaw and Draco made sure to smile at him when he looked towards Draco. Draco didn't know what it was about the child that made Draco attach to him so quickly but he did like the child. Professor Mcgonagall ended the dinner by sending the children away and asking the 8th years to stay. Draco made sure to go tell Chip he would see him tomorrow before heading up to stand behind the other 8th years making himself stand in the shadows.
“Well one the bright side you shouldn’t encounter that much resistance. People still trust you, they hope you can make the world a better place. They should believe that's why you want to change the schools.”
Draco snorted. “No. Absolutely not. I’ve had one drink. I know you aren't drunk, you haven't even finished your first one, even if I'm willing to bet you’re a lightweight.”
“Yes no matter what you've been told I always want you to be honest in here even if that means not giving me an answer.”
Harry gets the unsaid message. Do it even if Lucius has to die. Harry nods firmly. He walks to Draco, puts a hand on his shoulder and whispers in his ear.
“Well after dueling, even in practice once the wand is given back to the original owner, it works fine. Maybe the wand will work for both of you. Maybe the elder wand will belong to both of you. There's no rule that a wand has only one owner. Mr. Olivander told you the wand changed its allegiance, but was also reasonably pliant, maybe it works for both of you.” She told him.
“Damn it.’ James sighed. ‘Well fine then I’ll leave you to your date, While I take my own lovers on a date.” He beamed at them before skipping out of the diner.
“Um..Thank you minister. Again I do not know how many of you know this so I shall start from the beginning. When me, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were on the run from Voldemort and the ministry we ran into some snatchers at one point and they were going to give us to the ministry for blood testing when the recognised Ron and Hermione and decided Voldemort was the better option. They did not recognise me because of a stinging curse Hermione cast on me before they caught us. They then took us to Malfoy Manor where Voldemort was running headquarters. When we arrived Bellatrix Lestrange worked out that I might have been Harry Potter. When she realized this she called upon Draco to identify if I was the real Harry Potter not wanting to face Voldemort if she wasted his time. When Draco tryed to identify me he knew it was me and lied and told Bellatrix that he couldn't be sure it was me. She then saw one of the snatchers had the sword of gryiffondor, believeing we had broken into her vault at grinotts she stupifyed all the snatchers and had me and Ron thrown into dungeon so she could torture Hermione on how we came about the sword. After we were thrown in the dungeon we could hear Hermione screaming and we realized that Ollivander, Luna, Dean, and Griphook were all in the cell with us. Dobby the house elf then apprated into the dungeons and we told him to take Ollivander, Luna, and Dean. Griphook had been taken to identify if the sword was real or a fake. When they left Peter Pettigrew came into the dungeons and Dobby incompactited him allowing me and Ron to go after Hermione. We sneaked upstairs till Bellatrix had used Cursio on Hermione and then we started attacking. Ron was the only one with a wand and Bellatrix threatened to slit Hermione's throat by then the stinging curse had worn off and they all knew I was Harry Potter. Then Lucius Malfoy was getting ready to signal Voldermort with his dark mark, when Dobby returned and unscrewed the Malfoys Chandelier light and let it drop on everyone. Bellatrix let go of Hermione to protect herself and me and Ron got to Hermione and Griphook ran to us. We were all standing together when they recovered and Dobby stole Bellatrix's wand while I took Draco's wand. Then we all grabbed onto Dobby and disapparated. Draco did two very important things that day. He didn't tell Bellatrix it was me allowing us to get thrown into the dungeons with the others and allowing Dobby to find and help us. He also gave me his wand to defend myself with. I didn't win the wand from him. I didn't have a wand if Draco truly wanted me to be defenseless he wouldn't have given me his wand. Thank you”
Narcissa answered in a flat tone with no emotion still staring at the letter “That's a ministry owl, Harry. More specifically that is an Azkaban owl. There are only ten. They intercept and pick up anything going to Azkaban and they are the only ones who bring anything out of Azkaban.”
A red head comes up to him. He doesn't know who it is but they know him. “Say Malfoy. How are your Death Eater Parents?”
“It’s not that hard to jump to. I went thinking you were there without really checking. Then you had to come and save me. If I just looked you never would have died.”
They continued kissing and gripping each other till Draco pulled back breathlessly to rest his head in the crick of Harry's neck and felt Harry’s hands come up and wrap around his bare torso. Suddenly Draco broke out into a fit of giggles trying to stop them then failing when Harry started giggling too. “Oh my merlin, Harry we’re giggling like a gaggle of teenage girls”
Draco opened his eyes and saw bright lights all around him, he remembered dreams of waking to Harry and His mother holding his hands sitting next to his bed, Harry stroking his head, but the last actual memory was opening the door to his mother's house putting his cloak on the cloak stand and someone spelling a flash of light into the house then stepping out to see who did it with his wand in his hand. He looked around and saw that he was dreaming again and Harry was playing with his hair again.
James sits in front of him on the coffee table. Sirius and Regulus stand behind James. Lily and Remus stand at each end of the couch circling him in. He can't help his nervous fidgeting. He thought he grew out of that the day he found the new word in a dictionary. That was the last time he fidgeted.
Harry blushed. “Yeah I think he would hex me before willingly answering any personal questions.” He said while they walked through the front gate.
“I didn't think you would. I think that's the first time you glared at me, to be honest I was expecting it last session. You weren't meant to like the homework. It was just to give you something to think about, Did it work?”
Harry stands and grabs Draco’s hand to stop his pacing. “Hey. Look at me. You want to talk about all the worst things you’ve done? I have been there for all of your worst moments. I was behind Katie. I was right next to Ron. And I was on the astronomy tower that night. Not to mention every other fight we have ever had.
“If I don't like them I don't. I'm here to help you not be your friend, and even if I was, you can be friends without sharing the same opinion on everything.”
Draco smiled and put the necklace on. Pansy did a good job getting it to match his taste and keeping it quiet. When he looked up both his Mother and Regulus were smirking at him.
“Mm..Draco your father and I made more than our fair share of mistakes when it came to raising you. One of those mistakes is that we never let you think for yourself we always told you certain things were just the way of the world, for example Mud--muggle born wizards. I always wondered what happened to the smart girl from your potions class that was only in that one letter, until I asked Severus who you could be talking about and realized that you were speaking of Hermione Granger and that's why you never talked about her again. Son I think you can have your opinions, but no one ever asked what they were so you've never had to think about them.”
He looks down at his lap and starts talking robotically. “I was three when it was the first time I was called death eater scum. I barely remember, let alone understood it. I understood at six. I was seven and I became an orphan with a small army of house elves in an empty house. I was eleven and I decided it would be my first secret, and it would stay that way. I was Fourteen when I realized I had another secret to keep. I was Sixteen when I had my first date. I’m eighteen and it all comes falling down at the hands of my mothers cousins.”
“What do you mean the elder wand didn't work for him?” Draco asked confused on what his father was talking about.
When he got home that night he said hello to his mother then went to his room and started to list the people he hurt the most.
“Thank you Regulus. If he comes to your quarters tonight will you tell him he can come back to the dorms?”
Grobb is the first to show as always. Dobby shows up half a second later and automatically goes to hug Draco. He and Draco both frown when Grobb stops him. Jeal pops and pulls Dobby back behind her. Hoffey, Blort, and Evedy pop in then quickly line up behind Grobb heads down.
“I know you would which is why I will testify for you as well. You may not realize it but you saved the whole world with one little word that night, as far as I am concerned this makes us even. I must get going now. I will see you next wednesday at noon Mrs. Malfoy.”
“Because I wanted you to suffer as well while I'm stuck in a house of Gryffindor’s. Obviously. And It has helped mine and Sirius' relationship.”
“Aww. Dragon I love it. Thank you very much.” Narcissa said, giving him a kiss on the cheek. Harry opened his to find a set of glass balls in the box. While he was opening it Draco came over to take one out. Harry took the one Draco held out to him and watched as Draco said Sectumsempra and the ball projected a blank smoke screen as well as lighting up Harrys with a faint green glow around it. “Say Sectumsempra” Draco said softly. Harry did even if he said it wearily then Draco’s light up red and a few seconds later Harry face popped up on the smoke screen from Draco's ball while Draco popped up on Harry's ball.
The boys crowded around Harry and the red-haired baby in his arms. It will always be told, especially for her first date, that Scorpius and James fell in love with their baby sister quickly.
“It's very good that you've developed so much. Now I want to try to get you to see you deserve happiness, love, and kindness. I think we both suspect this won't be last time someone hexes you and that it'll happen again when you return to school. I want you to repent now Draco, I want you to write to the people you think that you hurt the most and I don't want you to expect anything to come from it either, they might not be ready to forgive events of the war yet, but I think your ready to face them.”
"Oh, Dragon mine and your father's actions are our own. You cannot be at fault for that." She stood and cupped his face in her hands. "Draco. No matter what happens I will always love you and the bad events you were born and brought into are no ones fault but me, your father, and  V..Vold..Voldemort, okay? I need you to know that Draco."
His father hugs him stiffly after, Draco can't remember the last time his father hugged him. “I'm sorry for everything, do whatever you wish in life.” He whispers. Draco can barely contain his shock.
Shields expanded and everyone looked around for its caster. Harry pulled off the invisible cloak. Cheers of Harry's alive were stifled at once.
“You know I’m not claiming Muggles are perfect, but sometimes Purebloods really suck.” Lily told him.
“Well Professor Hagrid, go to search for the first year, and Professor Hooch will you fly around the grounds and find Mr. Malfoy Please.' Yes headmaster.''Yes Minerva' 'Meanwhile Welcome back to hogwa-" She was cut off by a bang as one of the doors to the hall opened revealing Draco with a First year. "Ah, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Haldir, Professor Hagrid and Hooch were just about to come find you. Did you have troubles?"
“Of course. I apologize for my forwardness. I only wished to confirm you were who I thought you were. Let's go into my office and we can begin this session.”
“No one. I just know you. You want to make sure kids like you and Riddle don't slip through the cracks. You want someone to take care of kids like you, and someone to recognize kids like Riddle sooner so they can get help.”
“Yes mother you are correct I don't want to talk about leaving this house, about our punishment and definitely NOT about him.”
Harry asks more questions. Draco deflects but now Harry’s aware, now he’s not unknowingly satisfied with it. Draco begins to wonder if he should tell Harry. Just Harry. He gets the choice taken away from him two weeks later. He gets an Owl from Harry asking him to come over. Both Reluctant to go and to say no to Harry he goes. All five adults are there and Harry sits on the couch with a frown.
Graduation was a large affair. They held it on the quidditch pitch. The stands were unified with the Hogwarts crest and there was a large stage and projection at one end. The students sat on the pitch Dressed in neutral robes like the first years wore before sorting. Most had their House tie on though. Mcgonagall and the rest of the teachers sat on the stage. Professor’s Sprout and Flitwick were in charge of calling out names. Mcgonagall was in charge of handing them their final Hogwarts Letter.
When they got to Azkaban they were swarmed by guards asking for their wands and brooms and any other magical items. After they did they walked to a small office with a ministry worker behind the desk.
They settled into a routine for the next couple of weeks. They didn't talk much but they were only in the dorm for so long at the same time together anyway. Classes had started and everybody loved the new Professors. Harry heard Sirius sat outside the Gryffindor common room for 2 hours to get the fat lady to forgive him.
“Hey. Um… I just came by to, Here this is yours.’ Harry shoved the Hawthorn in front of him, blushing.
He walks out as quickly as he walked in. Harry jumps up to follow and he can hear Hermione telling the rest of the people in the room to give him a minute.
Neville walks to the metal gates. He’s never been here. He talked about it though, with Luna after she was freed. It unsettles him. He knows there's only two occupants but knowing its previous occupants shakes him. A fancy dressed house elf appears in front of him.
“He seemed alright.’ He shrugged. ‘But then again what do I know about how Malfoy feels. He also seemed fine after his time with the Carrows.”
Harry kept shooting him looks when he was asked about his mother. Like he’s just now realising how much Draco deflects when he asks about her. Like he just now realises he doesn't know much about Draco outside of school and when he is with Harry himself. That scares him more than anything. He doesn't want to choose between Harry and his Family. He can’t. It would be an impossible decision.
“Thank you Potter. It's appreciated. Was that all?” He didn't prepare for Potter today. He didn't know how long he could keep it together.
“I...I don't know how I feel. I've always just did what my father wanted or believed what my mother said.”
James threw out a theory, “He might not be ready to have a relationship. He may want to wait until the war’s further past.”
“I wanted to ask you some questions. You know I love Hogwarts and I love what I’ve learned here. But I also think you know the system is far from perfect. I think you and Hagrid might be the only adults that have never really let the students down. I want to know how the system works.
"I need you elves to go to the great hall and into the graves of those who died in the 1st World War And collect a piece of their hair then bring it back to me.
“No she lied to Voldermort himself, in the forbidden forest when he thought he killed me she was sent to check she asked me if Draco was alive and when I nodded yes she told him I was dead that's how i got away with faking it. What Hermione? Spit it out.”
He still didn't know his opinions but now he had mostly unbiased facts, muggles were still Wankers, now he could form opinions based on facts. By the time he had formed small opinions on the listed facts it had already been a week and he had another appointment to go to.
“Alright Draco you may call me just Nydia. Draco, why do you think the ministry sent you to me as a condition of your release?”
“I think they’re overreacting. You're rooming with Mr. Malfoy. McGonagall thinks it would be best if you two roomed together for untold reasons. But remember you have a room in our quarters if you need it.” Remus told him.
Draco barely resisted rolling his eyes. “It was my choice, Potter. My choice: My consequences. And contrary to your belief the war was not all about you. The Dark Lord wanted to rule over muggles, and wanted Muggle-borns to be slaves. You were just an obstacle to him. An annoying, persistent, powerful obstacle but an obstacle nonetheless. His life goal was not your death, it was world domination.”
“No! She’s not. If I had just looked in the mirror, I would've known you were safe. Then you wouldn't have had to come rescue me and would have been safe in Grimmauld.” Harry said and left the room.
Andy stayed for a bit, exchanging pleasantries and presents with the Family before leaving to the Tonks residence.
“You said that you only had a few pictures of your parents from before. It's a moving picture camera. That way you can have more. The book under it is empty, so you can fill it.”
“Let's stay here and nap then we can go to the last classes.” Draco decided. They both moved on the couch till they were comfortable then slept for a few hours while Draco caught up on sleep.
“The Ladies are to the right, and The gentlemen are to the left. We’ll let you get settled in. As Professor McGonagall said you can not switch. Sorry I don't make the rules.” James said.
“If we're talking about Malfoy I agree with Ron.’ Neville added. ‘The prophet article where it said Bellatrix’s victims were paid was true. Mom and Dad got a lot of gold. The letter said it was a large part of her Vault’s. It’s been really helpful, they were able to pay off the St. Mungos Bills with less than 5% of the Vault. It’s even on the seventh level with the Black Vaults.”
“I meant everything I said in there you guys saved my life and the whole world. I guess I should be going. If you ever need help be sure to owl me. I'll see you when term starts Draco.”
Kingsley nods his head. “That sounds acceptable. Before you go, is this spell permanent and are there any ramifications?”
“Look Neville went to see him and Neville was fine. I’ll be fine. And in case you forgot I always win against Malfoy. I'm good.”
“Yeah, who- Oh Harry, did you like what I did to Malfoy, Now that's justice right boys?” He questioned getting cheers from the boys, before the trio could react Chip had already jumped on the taller boy tackling him and starting to punch him.
The students cheered and Mcgonagall sat back down. Ginny and Luna come over to the eighth year table and dragged Hermione down to Pansy Parkinson to start planning a party for the reopening of The Room Of Requirement.
“I think you would be surprised at one's openness after getting free from a maniac and Family expectations.”
“It was good.’ Draco said sitting next to him. ‘He said Thank You. I think it was good for him. His shop is doing great and he made these little sweets. With your taste for treacle tart you would really like it.”
“Okay let's go talk to Mcgonagall and Kingsley to get your mother.’ Harry said, grabbing Draco's wrist and taking him down the hall. ‘Then we can write to Andy and Tonks, then talk to Sirius and Regulus.”
The people at the end of the hall could see the magic shoot out into the circle. It tried to spread out but ran into an invisible barrier made by the circle. With each shot of Magic the circle jerked more. The magic continued to shoot until Tonks collapsed.
Harry answers, “I'm just learning that while he was a great wizard and a good leader in a time of war, he wasn't a good man or a good educator. There's no excuse to leave a child in an abusive home whether physical, emotional, or mental abuse. Not even if there's blood protection or Pure-blood parents being perfectly okay with using their children as pawns or scapegoats for their punishments.”
“Hey I punched him too. Do I get a kiss from the pretty lady?” Questioned Chip earning himself a kiss on the cheek.
“Well... what if Regulus came. He's been over there a few times. Draco hasn't reacted badly to him.”
Two hours later Harry was assuring Ron, Hermione, Sirius, and a few others Malfoy would not kill him.
Draco nods his head and looks at his red bed sheets. He has gone from an empty house to having roommates.
The house elf brought lunch and Dinner too. He didn't get a response from his mother until he was preparing for bed. He stared at it for 5 minutes before his owl pecked him hard, encouraging him to open it.
Dromeda was quite Happy with her life. She got her husband and Child returned to her. She had a beautiful Grandchild. She got her favorite cousin back. And she was at least talking to her sister. Their relationship was still layers of complication but it had been 20 years since they were on speaking terms. Her nephew didn't even seem so bad now that he was determined to be a better person.
“You donated Minerva Manor anonymously. But I know you wonder how it's doing beyond what the papers say. So I talked to the head of the orphanage. I made sure it was clear I didn't donate it but I told them the person who did wondered. The other board is in their office so you can ask about it while remaining anonymous.”
“The Black Vaults technically were not all mine. Sirius’s was supposed to be yours and my mother still managed most of them. I still have my S.P.I.V. Black Vault and Mothers half of the inheritance split between her and Andromeda. My Malfoy inheritance I still have 95% of. I still have the Manor. Septimus Vault was one of many. The ministry took Father’s personal one. The Donated Manor would be 2% if I bought it ten times over. Don’t worry Potter I'm still richer than you.”
Harry rereads the opening page then looks at Draco. “Draco you know this doesn't matter right? They don't even know anything about us.”
After Ron and Hermione left, Harry poured himself a firewhiskey to think. He could testify and they would probably just get a slap on the wrist. If he didnt they would probably be sent to spend the rest of their lives in azkaban. Draco didn't deserve that he made bad choices, but he didn't have very many options after Lucius got locked up the first although he supposed that was all his fault to, he also sufferd dearly in his own way. Narcissa loved or maybe still loves her husband but she loves her son abundantly more and that love might be the only reason she didn't flee as soon as Lucius was gone she wasn't going to leave her son alone with Voldemort. Lucius did deserve to spend the rest of his days in Azkaban, all he wanted was the glory and power. He thought once more about the way the light seemed to dim out in those shining silver eyes during sixth year, and he knew he owed at least two of the Malfoy family his life, and he would try to save theirs.
They made it to the tallest tower in the room. Below it was a clear pile of ashes. Draco dropped to his knees in front of it. Tears were making it down his face. Harry hugged him gently from behind.
“Well.. Potter, I cant possibly think of reasons I could be mad, how about that my fathers in jail my mother cant leave the house the ministry is watching my every move some idiot put me in the hospital and youre being youre usual idiotic, self ritghoues, bumbling self. SO WHAT COULD I POSSImmmh” Draco ranted then was cut off by lips crashing into his.
“Well you shouldn't assume anything until you talk to him.’ James told him. ‘Why don't you go get some sleep? We'll talk more in the morning.”
“Hello, my name is Draco Malfoy. I have an appointment today with the healer Nydia. Can you tell me where to find her.”
When Harry walked in Malfoy had settled and put up privacy charms around his bed. Harry sighed then went to do the same thing.
The things that you, and Draco, and half-bloods raised in this world know just from growing up in it. We have muggle studies for half-bloods and Purebloods, but we don't have an intro to the wizarding world for muggleborns and half-bloods raised outside the world.
"Mother I won't have anything to do at school, I don't have quidditch and I definitely won't be making plans with anyone. Plus I think it will be good for the both of us if I come home often." The next week was spent at home with his mother making or trying to make his favorite meals. They really had to learn to do things without a house elf. Learning to cook set off many of the muggle fire alarms in the house and required many windows but they could both cook basic meals and were still improving. On Sunday night Draco put his trunk by the door and started to dress in his robes. Since he was basically already at Hogwarts he was just walking.
“The task Voldemort gave you was why he failed my boy,’ Lucius said while gently pushing Draco's hair back behind his ear, ‘Because you couldn't kill Dumbledore, Voldemort killed Snape and didn't get the wand.”
They then floated the boy to McGonagall and told her about his friends that were still locked in the wall. After they went back to the hospital and invited Chip but Chip said he would go visit once Draco was lucid and they could talk, so the Trio headed back where Narcissa was holding Draco's hand sleeping in the chair while Jimmy sat just inside the door with a third chair. Harry went to sit in his chair from earlier while Ron and Hermione went to lay on the couch on the side of the room.
“Actually my healer said I should bring someone that understands our family but that's not in the middle of me and Siri, and You and Sirius never got along, Cissa.”
6 years after Hogwarts they had their first child named Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy with Dracos friend Astoria being a surrogate.
N.E.W.T.S. Sucked. Even after winning a war, they sucked. Harry and Ron were avoiding thinking about them while Draco and Hermione insisted they had to start studying early.
James looked equal parts sad and angry now. "Well you can get used to them from now on. You'll get plenty."
“Potter. Thank you for helping my mother” Draco was barely looking at him. His eyes scattering around.
Draco nodded, took the papers and left the room. Almost everyone raised an eyebrow at Regulus. “You’ll see soon enough, the Prophet will have it as Anonymous. He wants it that way, he's only going to communicate with Kingsley to set it up.”
“The council has made a decision. Draco Lucius Malfoy you have been sentenced to 5 years probation, 5 years of a track on your wand, in conjunction with other seventh year students at Hogwarts Academy you will return for an eighth year to finish your education you will be on house arrest till the start of next term, you will also be required to see a mind-healer 3 times a week or at the discretion of the mind-healer till the start of next term, at the time the mind-healer will make the quantity of visits required. Do you understand your sentence Mr. Malfoy?”
He also turned the page and listed exactly what he had done to them. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville each took half a page, while mother and father took a whole page, and Ollivander, Luna, and Dean each took a third of a page.
“I don't want to go back to fighting at all. You could take time off before you start training. You don't have to do it immediately after school.”
I knew after he returned from Azkaban. Bellatrix loved the cruciatus curse. She loved phychological torture more. Me taking the mark was Fathers punishment along with control of the manor, but that wasn't it. Bellatrix tortured him because he wouldn't torture me. I know people can only handle so much, but he gave in quick. And he meant it. It worked as well as any other Cruciatus and I’m his son.
“Well, I kinda made them. Granger helped but we basically took principles from two-way mirrors and combined them with other spells. And now they're programmable for keywords. I programmed ours to be Sectumsempra so that we could put a new meaning to the word. We can change the word if you don't-”
James and Lily hug him. James looks over sirius' shoulder and sees Regulus standing in the background. He lets out a wounded sound and lets go of Sirius to wrap Regulus in a tight hug. He looks back and sees Lily talking quietly to Sirius. They separate and they both come over to James and Regulus. Sirius hugs Regulus tightly, "Reggie."
Draco put his hand to the floor, closed his eyes and said “Thank you.’ He sat with it for a minute before he got himself together. ‘We should let everyone in. Put out the smoldering piles, clean up a bit so the room doesn't have to do it all, it's done enough.”
Now the older kids went to Hogs head to see Aberforth and get refreshments but the younger kids still went to The Three Broomsticks. All the other stores were decorated for the Christmas holidays.
“Malfoy,’Draco keeps walking ‘MALFOY’ he keeps going ‘DRACO” Harry shouts it finally works and Malfoy stops working. Malfoy turns around and gives him a tired look.
“Nah, I think you just caught him off guard. People might do a double take but most of the time they notice the differences.” Sirius commented.
“I did Mrs. Malfoy. I wished to talk to you in person to answer. I can't thank you and Draco enough for what you have done. I know that you did it for him, I also know he knew it was me at the manor and lied, although I don't know why he didn't tell Bellatrix. I am willing to testify to Draco saving me in the manor and you lying in the forbidden forest, but I'm afraid I can not testify on behalf of Lucius. He did what he did for glory and power even if he feared Voldemort, you did it for love and loyalty and Draco for fear and his love for his mother and pride for his father both things I wished to feel for my parents. Lucius deserves what comes to him. I don't believe you and Draco should share that fate there has been enough hate, prejudice, and pain from this war already. I hope you understand.”
“Everyone has learned to cleanse Dark Magic since they were a toddler except for Tonks. Tonks will most likely be the first to pass out, The Aurors only train for some much. Most of us know what his Magic was like, the first thing goes wrong we pull back. We can't risk it infecting the castle again. If it takes more than one session then it does.’ Draco said amicably. ‘The room has agreed to release it in small doses, but it will contain it if it feels it's spreading too much. Ready?”
“Okay Mr. Draco. Mr. Draco, will I have to get new robes, Father said we could only get one set so I have to take care of them and now they are dirty and ripped.”
The dorms looked more like a hotel or a mansion setting when they walked through. Rooms lit up one side of the hall. You can walk across the hall into a large open Common room. They used the neutral colors of the houses to match. Gold, Black, Bronze and Silver.
“And you're part of that family so you will probably love them both forever even if you don't forgive them for everything. That's okay.” Harry finished for him then kissing him slowly.
“Draco, there you are. I've been worried I couldn't find you. Are you alright? I saw Chip and he told me you were mad.” Harry said as soon as he saw Draco.
“The Un-People I work with will be able to forge the paperwork. She will have died after your eighteenth birthday. The world won't ask the questions you’re afraid of.” Regulus tells him.
“Draco neither is right or wrong. They may be fair or unfair, and they may be considered to be good or bad by society, but an opinion can not be wrong against another opinion. You form an opinion and you act on that one Draco as long as it doesn't hurt anybody. Alright let's start by going through your journal and what you wrote down.”
Draco didn't show up for classes that day so it was easy enough for Harry to give him space. But Harry wasn't known for being patient.
A bang went off and black pervious powder exploded. Teddy giggled in the dark. Lily cleared it with a gust of air.
“The council has come to a decision. Narcissa Black Malfoy you are hereby sentenced to 2 years of house arrest in a ministry approved home, 5 year limitation on your wand, a 5 year track of every spell you preform, along with 10 years probation after your house arrest is lifted, and you are not to consort with any known death eaters including your husband. Do you understand your sentence?”
“Yeah’ Draco agreed putting his head back in Harry's neck ‘we are still teenagers huh...Harry I need to know that this isn't a one time thing, that we’re going to go on dates and that you'll kiss me at school and we’ll be an actual couple.”
“What have you been told about what it is we do as mind-healers and what about the people we tend to?”
‘They did however make a promise during 8th year. I don't know exactly what the promise is but it has something to do with being there for each other. This is not the first time it's been acted on. When Andromeda died and Harry got full custody of Teddy. Harry went to Dracos for the entire weekend. When Scorpius was Born Draco came over a lot after you kids were asleep. When Astoria died after School started Harry went and stayed at the Manor for the next month.
“But-But-’Draco started shakelely ‘But I've changed. I've changed you know that right Harry Harry you know i've changed ihaveill i'll prove ihave harry i prom-”
They spread out presents. And there were a lot. Harry had more presents than he had for his entire life. The adults all tore through theirs while Tonks & Remus helped Teddy.
Draco couldn't even remember the last time he called potter Harry. He definitely hasn't done it in the past 2 years. The last time may have been the first day of first year at Hogwarts, but he couldn't deny how nice it sounded when Harry called him Draco he wasn't sure if Harry had ever called him Draco. He started to wonder what it would be like to hear him say it everyday, what it would be like if he whispered it, what it would sound like in the early hours of the morning right after waking up, how it would sound with Harry laying over him slightly breathless while running his hands up and down-
He planned on writing them letters telling them about Draco and Him hoping they would yell at both of them less if they had time to process it. After he saw them off he started the walk to the Malfoys. He slept with Draco in his room which surprisingly only had a few nightmares between the two of them. During the day they all hung out in the living room reading or Harry showing them how to play muggle games they all enjoyed that. Christmas morning Harry woke to Draco wrapped around him like an octopus like he normally did, and Narcissa knocking at the door.
Every hex Harry sent his way he deflected to the room. He didn't send any back, not that Harry was focusing on that since he was mad. Draco waited until the room wrote words on the wall in ink to throw his wand down.
“The summer after the battle of mysteries the nightmares got worse. I wasn't obsessed with Draco because I thought he might have taken the Dark Mark. I knew he did. I watched him take it. With Bellatrix’s dagger against Narcissa’s throat.
He sat on his bed with his newest journal staring at the blank page before just doing harsh scribbles then tearing the page outta of the book and throwing it to the ground. Then he sat his book on his nightstand and set for bed then unsuccessfully tried to sleep.
“...Thanks. That was actually nice to hear.’ This time Draco couldn't control the eye roll. ‘Promise not to hex me for my next question?”
“Shhh, Shhhh. I know. I know Draco. I know you've changed. It's okay.” Harry said quickly while soothing Draco's hair to calm the scared boy. “Look Draco , we found who did this. I think they thought it would be fun and they would somehow prove themselves. But the only thing they've proved is that they are worse human beings then you have ever been okay?”
He was not smiling Three hours later when they finished. He was exhausted and he didn't know how people could be so stupid. It was like no one updated the school system in 5 centuries.
“I want to use Bellatrix Lestrange Vault to give restitution to the people she hurt the most. I want to use her Black Vault to give to Hermione Granger for when she graduates and starts her campaigns. I don't know what she’ll do yet, but I know it will be about social change and people getting the rights they deserve. I would use the Collective Malfoy Vault to buy the Manor.”
Harry watched as Draco got up wondering if Draco actually thought they would send him to Azkaban Harry would never let that happen. He really needed to find out where this protective streak for Malfoy came from before it became a problem. He nodded to the Minister and started to follow the Malfoys out of the courtroom.
“You have to take me out on a date and formally ask. One kiss doesn't count.” Draco said, intertwining their fingers.
He made it all the way to Arithmancy without looking at Harry. He had DADA before and it was the hardest he had to work all day not to.
He stalled slightly going back to the dorms after dinner. He was scared that Harry didn't mean it, that he regretted it, that He himself would screw it up. He didn't exactly have healthy relationship role models. When he did come in Harry was sitting on his trunk at the end of the bed. His head shot up when Draco let the door shut.
He makes it through dinner. He’s surprised he did. The Blacks were curious about their cousin. Their dead cousin. He stumbled over his words about his mother, feebly hoping they don't know anything is off. He lies about how she’s doing, what she’s doing. The light sting at being an orphan has pretty much gone away. He wouldn't mind the world knowing she was dead. But he can't risk his family. And the world would have questions.
He wasn't sure how this meeting would go. She might be grateful to him or might be resentful. He got so lost in his thoughts he jumped when a ministry worker said they were ready for him. He followed the worker to a vacated small office door and took a deep breath before going in, he wasn't quite sure why he cared so much what Narcissa thought about him but he just couldn't shake the feeling of wanting her to like him, or at the very least not hate him.
“No, It's not. Dumbledore made snape promise to kill him.’ Harry told them ‘He knew what Voldemort asked you to do, and I think he also knew you were too young and good to do it. Snape also made a vow with your mother to carry out the deed if you failed.
“We are very different. I also like the power your father has over me. I think this is the most Sirius and I communicated since he left for Hogwarts.”
“I know who you are Mr. Malfoy. I am Nydia, tell me where did you learn such accurate Occlumency, it takes great skill to implant new memories.”
“I would appreciate it if you didn’t tell your friends everything I told you. Their morals are too high.”
“I want all of that.’ Draco whispers. ‘I love you, Harry James Potter.” It’s the first time he’s ever told someone outside his family he loves them.
“I wanted to ask about my parents. Everyone else that came back. They were dead. My parents were in St. Mungos under my mothers maiden name to keep Death Eaters away. I made sure quite frequently during the last few years Bellatrix had not found them and killed them. Did you heal them? Or did they die?”
Harry noticed and suddenly remembered what Draco was hoping to get out of this. “You know, everyone should go help Remus find some Chocolate. Chocolate always helps.”
Also what kids are told they can do after Hogwarts. I feel like we only learn about 10% of the professions in the wizarding world. I'm thinking I can change some of those things but I need to know how it works first.”
Draco bit his lip and started talking in a tense voice still facing away from Harry "I meant what I said in that letter harry. I'm trying to change. I know you hate me just please let me try to change. Please."
“Kay, okay, I'll get it you stay here.” Harry said gently, kissing Draco’s temple in comfort. Harry found a medium sized container still in condition and scourgifyed it.
One week later Harry drew the Hawthorn and took it downstairs. He sat at the sitting room table for half an hour before his mom raised an eyebrow and sat across from him.
“Your first appointment with your mind-healer is tomorrow. I know this will be hard for you son, but please try to trust and talk to them. It will help.”
He ran. He couldn't talk about the fact that Harry just kissed him. He had a panic attack after he returned to his dorm. He didn't even realize Harry never came in till a house elf popped in the next morning and started to gather Harry’s stuff.
When I look at these I'm so happy. I'm happy that he only had so long with you so he couldn't drag it out, okay these scars almost killed me but they saved you and they didn't kill me Severus kept his promise to my mother and his duty as my godfather and saved me. They also remind me that no matter what you can kill me before I can hurt you and I needed to know that sometimes. These are the only scars I'm happy to have because they tell me that I can care more than my father and I have consciousness and that I'm human. Harry, you remind me that I can, so don't ever feel guilty for these okay?” Draco finished with tears down his face and leaned his forehead against Harry's feeling the boy's breath on his lips.
Bellatrix is fighting Hermione, Ginny, and Luna Bellatrix shot a killing curse so close to Ginny she missed death by an inch. Harry goes to fight Bellatrix instead until he's pushed aside by Molly Weasley screaming “NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH.”
“I think she might be right, Sirius.’ Ron piped up. ‘The feud between the Malfoy’s and the Weasleys goes back a few ancestors to Rumors that Septimus Malfoy stole all our money for his personal vaults. Mom and Dad got a letter that Septimus Vaults were changed into their name. To return it to its rightful owner or something like that. They're going to check it this weekend but I think we're rich now.”
"I don't believe she did. When she got to my body and realized I was alive she asked me one thing. She asked if her son Draco was alive. I nodded my head yes and she turned around and told Voldemort I was dead. I believe that her reason for lying was her trying to protect her son the best she could given the circumstances. It's the second time my life has been saved by the bond of mother and son".
The kids sit silently for a few minutes before Scorpius goes to ask a question. He opens his mouth as there’s a bang on the door. Ginny checks the wards again and they’re lit up red. There’s more banging as she organizes the kids. “To Harrys office NOW! James you first. Wand out.’ James nods and takes his wand out. ‘Lily, you next. Scorpius. Albus. Teddy.’ She sees the look on Teddy's face and assures him ‘I'm not fighting, I'm running right after you bud.”
Him and his mother have been going through the family possessions since his first appointment, he didn't think of the journal again till he saw his mother with a stack of letters.
“Draco what are you doing here we still have another week are you okay?” Nydia asked worriedly once she saw Draco in the waiting room.
It's pretty known that Harry is not exactly patient. It had been a week since Valentine's day. A week since that stupid prophet article. He was losing his mind. Draco still did everything they normally did with each other but he was blocked off. Half the time he was bluntly wearing his Pureblood mask. He said all the right things without any of the feeling. He didn't want to go to his parents. He would have to explain every other time the prophet got involved in his love life and he just wanted people who already knew and understood. So he went to Ron and Hermione. His best friends.
“I want to be an Auror someday. I don't think I want to go back to fighting all the time right now.” Ron said.
“Uh...sure. I'll go get Dad.’ He walked as fast as he could doing the impression of his Dad he usually uses to mock his Dad. Maybe he should stop that. ‘Dad!’ He exclaimed walking into his Dad’s office. ‘Grandfather is here! And I know that sounds crazy because he's supposed to be in Azkaban but he just came through the floo.’ His Dad was looking at him as if he lost his mind. ‘He said to get you and I wasn't supposed to run and walk with a straight back and my head high. I don't know what any of that means! So i did my you impression to-”
“Thank you Narcissa, I love it’ Harry said standing to give her a hug, ‘where did you even get these pictures?”
“Thank you. He suggested we do future test runs in the Manor. We have trial rooms there for this sort of thing. And if it goes wrong the magic isn't spread into Hogwarts. Speaking of School. After your meeting with kingsley in two weeks are you and Ron going to start studying for N.E.W.T.S.? I know you teased me and Hermione for starting early but you do need to study. I don't want to hear you whining that you failed them all.”
“Oh. No, I think we’ll be alright. Kinda think we're both tired of fighting. And want to have a normal school year. Thanks Remus.” Remus gave him a nod and smile and left to follow James and Sirius.
“No, the battle happened, then I guess it just slipped my mind. Blocked it out with everything else with the Carrows.” She said with a sad look.
“I learned from my mother, and a professor. Now if you don't mind, I would like you to leave my mind.”
By the second day he was dying. Draco was back to class today but he was wearing his old Pureblood mask so of course Harry got nothing from him. When Draco didn't look at him during DADA Harry slouched at his table while everyone else left.
The group decided to take a month to find out what they wanted to do with their lives then all meet up at Grimmauld and talk so they know where each person is. Draco met with Nydia every 2 weeks instead of weekly since Draco still hasn't processed his thoughts about his father, making him slightly unstable at times. Draco, Narcissa, and Harry were eating lunch in the living room when an owl came in. Draco and Narcissa both stared at the letter it dropped making Harry confused.
The Potter and the Lupins, plus Sirius but he counts as a Potter and a Lupin, went over to the New Weasley house.
The new ministry worker they were following was much more put together then the previous one although he only looked slightly less terrified which gave him just a sliver of satisfaction. The worker led them back to their holding cell which they got to share being mother and son. He let his mother wrap her arms around him, neither of them speaking just holding onto each other thinking to themselves.
The trio reacted when the rest of the boys ran toward Chip locking them up on the wall while letting Chip beat the teenager till Hermione went and pulled him off and told him “Chip STOP if you beat him up then you're no better than him, as much as I would like to let you continue we have to take him to McGonagall and let her deal with it okay?”she said while glaring at the david teenager.
“Hey,’ Draco took a drink so he could actually talk ‘Don't laugh at me Potter. I believe I'm missing a piece of the story. Mind filling me in? The last thing I remember is a light charm coming into the house after I put my robes up.”
“Tonks?’ He came around the corner holding Teddy. Teddy’s Hair went into a kaleidoscope of colors when seeing his mom. ‘Is something the matter? You look shaken.”
Malfoy sighs and crouches down in front of Teddy where Harry is presenting him. Teddy automatically changes like he does every time he meets someone new. His blue hair goes platinum blonde. His light brown eyes go silver with a line of amber Teddy can never seem to get rid of.
“I'm great, we knew this was going to happen. I'm really enjoying our day. We’ll leave out the back then return to Hogwarts after. At least the picture they got might be cute.”
You could help them, then when you're not helping them you could be home with Narcissa and Draco. I can get them to approve it. Hermiones already been telling them to find someone in here to help them.”
And she is holding a child.” Draco said. Then picked up his ink, repaired it, and went back to work.
“We’ll start at your deaths…” Hermione starts. An hour later Hermione is parched and a dark mood settles over the room.
“Um, yeah, I’ll let him cool off more. Still not sure if he wants to hex me for asking something at the Manor.” Harry cringed.
They tried to teach Harry everything he needed to know for 55 minutes before Harry looked at the clock. “Hell I have 5 minutes’ Harry said while hurriedly packing his stuff up. ‘Thanks Hermione, you're the best I'll see you later. Thanks baby boy, I'll come by after I'm done. Bye I love you.” He said leaning in to kiss Draco then running out of the library leaving Hermione and Draco stunned and stunning himself when he walked into the classroom and realized what he did.
Harry said it was too late he overpowered Draco weeks ago, took his wand from him. Harry whispered in the quiet of the great hall “So it all comes down to this doesn't it? Does the Wand in your hand know its last master was disarmed? Because if it does... I am the true master of the Elder Wand.”
As much as I love Sirius he did give up when Regulus took the mark. I didn't, couldn't make myself even though it hurt like hell. He only accepted my feelings for him after he took the Mark. After I didn’t give up on him.
The adults were settled in Mcgonagall’s large private dining room. Most of the order gathered there to celebrate the day. Teddy came too. He was a nice reminder of the light left in the world.
“About Hogwarts.’ he rolled over. ‘About using my political power to change schools. Everything about the process is so Stupid. And I only met with Mcgonagall. She scheduled me with the Educational Office of International Confederation of Wizards E.O.I.C.W. for next Tuesday. And the next Tuesday after that I have to meet with Kingsley to understand what the ministry does. Which should be nothing in my opinion. They should stay out of schools, besides funding.”
Back in the library Hermione and Draco were still staring at where Harry was standing. “Did he? Did he just tell me he loves me?” Draco asked with amazement in his voice.
“The reason I was alive was because of Harry. I followed him into the room of requirement to get my wand back and then Granger and Weasley came in and Goyle ended up setting the place on fire with Fiendfyre and we almost died. Potter found some broomsticks and made Granger and Weasly come back to grab us. If Potter wasn't there I would've died in that fire like Goyle. And I will never forgive father for what he has done to us.”
“-Scorpius’ His Dad cut him off, which was unusual ‘Go to the Potter’s now. Tell Harry Lucius has been released and The Promise he’ll understand go Now!” His Dad pushed him into the Floo and sent him to the Potter’s before he could question it.
