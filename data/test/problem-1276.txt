"How could you love me when I'm so broken?" The grey eyes started to fill up with tears again as he asked it.
"I think you have a lot to explain Potter," was all that the headmistress said.
Draco saw fire and felt heat before passing out when the whole scenario began to change from the Manor to another one.
year and he was a mess and I’ve seen him grown so much these last months that I don’t want to be the reason why he gets back to his old self-“
"Who knew Zabini knew how to fight? Since you always seem so calm and chill," Theo said while spitting blood on the floor. "Oh, and you got the chose one to join the fun, how lovely"
“Did you know what they did to him Luna?” she nodded but didn’t say more so he understood that the topic was over and decided to ask her to teach him to braid hair.
"Don't try to come at me when you're even worse," the blond reminded her as they sat and ordered.
"Sorry, I have light feet, when you grow up in a home full of people you learn to make as little noise as possible," answered Ginny with a smile
They continue to eat, but Harry could feel that Draco wanted to say something else but was having a hard time figuring out how to say it. So he took the grey-eyed boy hand and give it a soft squeeze while asking what was wrong.
"All the little children dress like that all the time, Harry?" Draco asked once they were sitting waiting for their order.
It has been 2 weeks since them and Halloween was a couple of days away, Pansy and Hermione grew to be best friends and there have been slight changes in the later girl, and Ron loved it. He’s always telling about how he loves Hermione having more confidence in herself, and how pretty her hair looked since she changed her hairstyle, and how he loved her long nails, and how different she looked with her more fitted uniform.
"I mean, I wouldn't mind a tip or two from the chosen one," said Blaise with a smirk and it was Harry's turn to blush deeply, he needed to stop forgetting that Slytherins aren't like Gryffindors.
And so Draco decided that everything he touched must be his, or else it would hurt him. Maybe that’s why he never touched his father because he wasn’t his and it hurt, but later he also learned that his father didn’t need to touch him for it to hurt, sometimes he still longs for the physical pain. He also learned that his mother, even though it was
of September of his 6
"I am okay, just a bit tired, Lily had a lot of energy today and I haven't been sleeping that well since we are waiting for the big news," the blond answered and let himself be pulled into a hug.
“Could you cast a Patronus before I tell you what happened? I know you are waiting for me to tell you instead of asking,” said Draco with his soft voice and Harry smiled lightly doing as told, when the stag appeared he felt the blond’s body relax and he felt the grey-eyed boy’s head rest on his shoulder. He did want to know about whatever had happened but he knew better than to push the other boy.
"Oh c'mon, you're good but we never managed to beat Gryffindor when Harry played," said Blaise and Draco gasped
“Why are you helping me?” Draco dared to ask and she smiled
"Where's Draco?" anxiety started to invade Harry's body and Blaise's face fell as well
"Well, I tried cooking meringues with Harry during the holidays but it ended up being a mess, they tasted good but looked awful," smiled Draco at the memory
Or where Harry takes Draco to Godric’s Hollow
He was so in love with the green-eyed boy it hurt, he had no need to fake his smiles around him like he was thought to, he could speak freely about whatever came to his mind without fearing for his damn life, he loved how he felt safe around him and how natural their intertwined hands felt. But he also was scared, what if Harry wanted to have sex with him right away? Draco would say yes either way because that’s what you do for people you love, right? Will Harry care about his scars? He had so many, even if some weren’t so noticeable Draco knew they were there, and then there was his arm, the skin looked so scarred it disgusts him.
"Are you sure?" And the blond really wanted to answer but his ears start ringing too loud and everything was in slow-motion and then... nothing.
“Great!” and with that Harry took Draco’s hand and they continued their way to the common room.
"Oh yeah? Show me that rule!" Draco said with a smirked and Ginny just laughed.
"I love you, I love your stupid hair, and your stupidly good voice, and you strong hands, and how good you're at making me feel worthy of love and I love you so fucking much it hurts that I'm never going to be able to tell you how much I do because there will never be good enough words to express it," by now the blond was crying and his voice was barely there, "but I love you"
It has been a while since he had been here, a little bit less than 5 months but still so much had changed. Not that he was complaining, but if before he couldn't picture himself entering the manor without getting strong nausea, now it was unbearable but it was something he was decided to do. Each step he took onto the entrance felt heavy and he could feel the anxiety rising to dangerous levels, but then he remembered his mom and how sad she was when he left and if he could manage to have just a small piece of her courage he would be just fine.
“So, you never actually told me when was Teddy’s birthday, all I know is that instead of two weeks in Paris we’re only going to spend one,” asked Draco while they were waiting in the queue to enter the restaurant.
“You’re like magic Draco, I swear,” he said as they walked back to their rooms and Draco just laughed telling him to shut up.
"And that's why I love being with you, because I've always just wanted to be me, not the chosen one or the golden boy, and when I'm with you Draco, I'm just me, because you see me as who I am and not as who I am supposed to be, so please don't try to be what you think I want, because if I get to be me then you should get to be just you as well."
"Then don't," Harry smirked kissing him again and if it wasn't because someone hexed him he would've continued, he knew it was a stinging hex and it hurt a lot but he didn’t say anything letting Draco go, it has been hard enough for the other boy to regain confidence for him to just throw all that progress away just because someone decided to be a bloody idiot towards them.
And then there was Harry, who didn’t know what to do, or what to feel for that matter because the image he had of Draco Malfoy was rapidly fading and getting replaced by something new, that made it hard to want to learn the answers of his questions, but he didn’t know what to do with this feeling that kept messing with his head because sometimes he got cold answers from him and sometimes he was able to see Draco in such a vulnerable state that hurt. The nights at the Astronomy tower were common, they both stayed silent most of the time, others they talked about school, but Harry was craving another heart-to-heart conversation with him because in some way he started to see Draco as the person he would’ve ended up being if he were in the ‘bad side’ of the war and that hurt.
“For a second I thought yesterday was a fever dream, but I guess we did spend the whole ride with the git and didn’t die,” said Ron and Hermione elbowed him making him gasp “hey! I’m not saying anything wrong! I’m just getting used to the new normal Mione, geez you have such skinny elbows that really hurt!”
"It's okay, that was a mistake, we're together now, I need you to go and look for Hermione please," Harry begged and once she doubled check this information with the pale boy and he nodded she exited the bathroom.
“You really have a hero complex, Potter.”
“I just- I haven’t seen him since the letter came! And he said he was going to go for a walk, but he had this look, oh that look” she tried to explain between sobs and too many hand movements “he had the same look that he had on year 6, and I’m so scared because he was doing so good- I promise” and then her words began to make no sense so Blaise step in.
"I don't know, you tell me"
The common room was behind a pretty portrait, where the lady was very nice, the password was Novis inittis which made everyone smile and on the inside, it felt cosy which was nice for the Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors because it reminded them of their own dorms, but it was also neat and with a lot of places to sit and hang out or study.
"And then what? You get the money, that you don't need and a status that you also don't need, instead you're left with a person who despises you and ties you in a marriage neither of us really wants."
“And he let it slide the first time, he grabbed my wrist too hard while throwing me out of the room, but the second time he didn’t and threw a crucio to me, I laughed because he didn’t have that much hate, then again next to my aunt’s or the Dark Lord itself, any crucio feel like tickles” and Harry knew Draco was trying to let it sound like a joke, and Harry really wanted to believe it but remembering what Luna and Neville said he knew he was telling the truth.
"Yeah, just a bit tired," Draco stuttered back and force himself to pick up the pace.
"You are such a tease, I hate you," pouted the smaller boy but re-entered the changing room.
"What if I take too long? What if people get tired of it?"
“We should play a quidditch match today, it’s been a while and I miss beating you at quidditch,” said Draco as he sat on the Gryffindor table, he had just ingested an elixir to induce euphoria and he was praying for not having any side effects, he just wanted to feel happy even if it wasn't real.
“I attempted to throw myself out from this tower several times before, but I guess I was just too coward to do it… I still am, but now I can just pay someone to push me and then everything will just be done” said Draco when Harry lowered the letter “can you imagine the header at the prophet? ‘Ex-death eater killed on the same spot he tried to murder his old headmaster’ or ‘Ex-death eater kills himself out of guiltiness’ I don’t know which one is better” he continued, attempting to laugh, but instead he broke down crying. “I just want everything to stop, I don’t want to get married to Theodore Nott, I don’t want to be the perfect little boy, I don’t want to be a Malfoy or the Slytherin prince, I just want to be me even if I don’t know who I am” ugly sobs interrupted every third word he said but it was like he didn’t even noticed, same at the way his nails dig his palms, trying to get blood out of them.
"Make love to me?" Draco asked in a small voice and all Harry could do was smile and kiss him softly on the nose. "Please,"
"Well, I was wondering where was my son," a voice made the blond's bones chilled and he almost passes out. "It was quite a surprise when I arrived home and only was greeted by my wife and not my son, and I was hoping I taught you good manners boy" Lucius voice was cold and on the limit of becoming really loud.
Harry took the blanket off their bodies and tried to sit up, getting surprised when he managed without much struggle, either he was getting stronger with his daily exercises or the other boy was stupidly skinny. He tried to shake him again and finally managed to wake him up, it took him a couple of seconds to understand the situation and when he did, he practically jumped off the couch and ran to the dormitories.
“Want one? There’s plenty, although you should hurry if you like something in special before Ron’s hands get to it” he said laughing and Malfoy looked at him with curious eyes and nodded.
"It's annoying, I'm capable enough to survive by myself, thank you very much," pouted the grey-eyed boy and Harry laughed earning a soft punch on his shoulder.
"Well, people change Draco, and that's okay. What it's on us is if whether we want to do good or bad changes, and so far it feels like you're stuck being what people expect you to be rather than what you are, I can't keep going pretending that you're fine, because that's not what a true friend is, so if I were you I would get my shit together before other got theirs and leave you behind," said that black-haired girl and left the classroom, her firm steps resonated in the empty room just like her words did on his empty soul.
Where Draco falls into the realization that he's loved by Harry freaking Potter
And yet another picture of them together managed to find its place on Harry's old album, and if there was another picture he took without Draco noticing, well... that was a story for another time.
"Luna has been drawing a lot lately and some of the things she draws are so pretty, I want her to animate it after I get it done, which would be so cool."
"Can we have pizza? I've been craving it since the couple at the moo-vie ate some," the blond pleaded and Harry laughed nodding.
"Why didn't you tell them it was me? That night at the manor, I know you knew it was me but I just don't understand"
The first thing Draco did when he opened his eyes was to look at his right where Harry’s bed was, the black-haired boy was still sleeping so he admired how different his face looked without glasses. He had been watching Harry since day one, and Draco was glad the bag under the boy’s eyes disappeared after their first month in Hogwarts.
Harry did have plans, he was going to visit his parents’ grave in the morning and then he promised Teddy he was going to take him Trick-or-Treating to muggle London, so he still needed to figure out his costume, Teddy was currently obsessed with Pokemon and he wanted to be Meowth so Harry agreed to be James from Team Rocket.
Where they fell in love in october
Soon it was time to leave for their first class and since the eight years had pretty much the same schedule they began to walk to the 3
"Okay," the silver-eyed boy stuttered and took a deep breath before nodding and taking the hem of Harry's shirt, "but you first" and with that Harry's shirt was gone, and soon after that Draco's one was too.
“I don’t know! But it all feels a little bit odd, with his father in Azkaban and his crazy family on the run I wouldn’t be surprised if he was as crazy as his aunt,” Harry sighed, yeah okay, maybe it was a long shot but his gut tended to be right most of the time in stuff like this.
“Well, it’s a good thing I brought this today,” Harry said with a soft voice trying to not startle the boy who looked lost in thought, but failing miserably as the boy jumped in his sit due the disruption.
Or where home is a person and not a place.
“I didn’t realize this one was already opened, a pet peeve of mine is opening something new when you still have some left,” said with chuckle popping the chocolates into his mouth and continued to talk with Ron about their trip to Australia.
"And happy, don't forget happy."
“Of course not, is part of him, and he’s so perfect and those scars held meaning and a lot of stories I would love to hear once he’s ready to tell them-“
“I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually got my book yet, and nor is Ron,” Harry answered awkwardly bringing his hand at the back of his neck.
Harry tightened his grip when he started to see where this story was going, still hoping the was a happy ending to it, but knowing how unfair the world was he started to prepare for the worst because he remembers the handprint-like bruise in Draco’s wrist, and once again his stomach is tied in a knot, but he tries to not show any sign of being uncomfortable because in this vulnerable state Draco would think the reason behind his uncomfortableness was because he thought of him as something dirty and not because he wanted to kill Theodore Not.
"Oh yeah, I can't believe how much I've missed because of who I used to be, if I knew Gryffindors could be great company- well, there's nothing to do know, right? How about you show me how to play with this machines, can't be the only ones who aren't having fun" his boyfriend said as he offered his hand, which Harry took smiling and dragging him to one of the games.
"I'm getting too old for this," was the first thing Andromeda said when they stepped out from the fireplace.
“Oh Merlin, this is awesome! Hannah owes me 10 galleons now!” was the first thing Ginny said before falling at a laughing spree. “Sorry, it’s just, there have been so many bets around you two since forever but they got even better when you started to be good friends.”
"I just can't believe her, she's always like that! And I know it, okay? But she promised that she was going to come for our last day, she was here! She fucking lives here now! And she decided to choose father over me again and-" Harry observes Draco while he complaints, he had noticed that when the blond got mad and tried to talk about it he uses a lot of hands movements, it was a little bit funny but Harry would never admit that in front of his boyfriend. "And I get it, you know? I would choose him over me, hell I don't even know why you choose me at all when I'm just-" he kisses Draco in order to cut his rant, and for a second the blond doesn't react, but when he does, they keep kissing until they need to break it off in order to breathe.
Where Draco has too many doubts about how muggles live and asks for help,
"You check the Astronomy tower and I'll check Myrtle's bathroom, those are the only places he likes to go when he's sad, send a message if you find him," said Harry and started to run to the bathroom.
"Are you sure you want to go?" Draco could see the concern in Harry's eyes, but he tried to ignore it for his own good.
Or where we get to see what the future holds for them.
"Yeah, happy."
Or where Draco let himself feel something else than sadness
"Not that I don't trust your eyesight, but the number 12 is missing"
"It's Felix Felicitis, because sometimes I feel you just need a little bit of luck to do amazing things and I would love to give you some."
Draco never had a big appetite, he likes to think that he’s like his mother in this aspect, yes, he enjoys food but never in big portions, because it’s improper and show’s low class, “only poor people eat a lo Draco, it shows that they fear they run out of food, we don’t need to worry about that and besides, no one likes fat boys” his father told him when he turned 13, and after that, he refused for his mother to keep sending him chocolates every 3 days, only allowing it once a month and even then he gave most of them to Crabbe and Goyle.
"Oh but, how about a flying motorcycle?"
Song Chapter: for him by Troye Sivan
"I'm gonna be okay, I promise, I'm just gonna go and say hi, I'll be back before dawn," and with that Draco kissed Harry quickly and appeared outside of Malfoy Manor.
Or where Harry casts a patronus when things get too dark.
“I mean, yeah, both, but also I find it really weird that I get to make a decision and then expect a good result out of it, like I can talk with Hermione and not expect a punch in the face or how I can kiss you and not get hexed in the spot."
When the class was finally over Harry followed his friends to the Great hall, he was craving pudding and really hoped the was some tonight. When they found a seat in the Gryffindor table and he saw the pudding he smiled remembering the day he met Luna and started to savour the dish in front of him, nodding occasionally at something Ron said and laughing at Seamus and Dean's stories.
Con – He forced Harry to study and sadly he could be very persuasive, more than Hermione who was just scary to say no to.
"I hate you both, I expected this kind of betrayal from my sister, but my best friend?!" Ron pouted and Ginny said something like 'he's already family Ronald' between laughs.
His thoughts were interrupted, once again, when he started to feel a pair of wandering hands on him, he started to feel lightheaded but he couldn't pass out now, not with him here. But then nausea became too much and Draco started to struggle against the strong grip, he didn't realize he's shouting until he feels Theo release the grip and passes out.
The rest of the trip was uneventful, mostly Ron complaining about the heat and how glad he was back home where the Sun didn’t try to burn him 24/7, Hermione asking Draco if he started to study for their
Or were Harry founds Malfoy at the Astronomy tower and secrets get revealed.
A lot of things happened after graduation, first of all, Hermione and Ron finally got married, the wedding was nice and Draco got to meet her parents, turns out her mother makes the best roast lamb ever, and since then Draco makes sure they have dinner at their house every month (also because their kids seem to really like each other, and as long as it is not his house the one being destroyed, Draco couldn't be happier to let them play together).
"Yes professor," said Hermione and left them alone.
“Harry won’t care about that Draco, he has scars too, we all have,” said Luna with her calm voice Draco loved so much, whenever he felt anxious back in the manor he would go and talk to her until he fell asleep, that ended in painful punishments but it was so worth it. “And he has a lot of scars, I’ve seen them and I’m sure you don’t care about that, right?”
Where Draco really tries to be what he wishes he was
"Of course I am Harry, you're lucky to have me," Draco joked and Harry smiled sweetly
"It really does, am I right? When I feel homesick I come down here to do it, I started doing it because it was one of Harry's favourites but then Harry became part of my family so I just did it to feel closer to home"
was a confession? I’ve been obsessing over that small sentence for a whole week and it turns out I was right the whole fucking time!”
"And they do this every day?"
“Well that explains why Harry has been daydreaming all day,” the curly-haired girl said as she put her books on the table, “I mean, I've been known for a while that he fancies you, I ended up losing 5 galleons to Ginny because he told you right away and didn’t wait like I thought he would. He’s always so impulsive, I always wonder how he managed to survive his whole life”
"Then you just need to look closely," Harry mumbled in Draco's ear, feeling how the smaller boy shivered, casting a quick spell the number 12  began to appear.
All the hose elves were eager to help Harry out, and when they refused to let him the help he just sat there eating a sandwich someone made him. After he was finished, he took the chocolate parfaits and left a couple of galleons for the elves and left before they could throw a fit about it and how it was not necessary. The way to the tower felt quicker than usual, he was so nervous about the whole thing, he could scream to relieve his stress but when he saw Draco sitting on the cold floor his red nose and dry tears on his cheeks he couldn’t help but smile.
So, it was Ron, Ginny and Harry vs Draco, Pansy and Blaise.
"And don't you dare tell me that you're fine, because I can clearly see you're not, you haven't been in a long time and even if it got somewhat better since you returned from winter holidays you're acting weird, and they whole panic attack with Theo has got me thinking he's part of this whole mess you're turning yourself into, again."
"Dear Lord, leave the boy alone, you both are in real trouble but that can wait, Ms. Parkinson, help me take the boy back to the infirmary," said Madame Pomfrey with an alarmed voice
"Fuck me, please fuck me," Draco pleaded and Harry smiled leaving one last kiss on Draco's lips.
"Nonsense, you're trembling really bad and between the two of us I've got more fat to keep me warm," he laughed and Draco smiled putting the jumper, to say that it was big on him would be a lie, it was practically swallowing the boy but he looked too cute to do a re-adjusting charm.
"Well, well look what wind bring over," said Theo once he noticed Draco. "I think you and I have some business yet to be attended"
There were a lot of issues with Draco, more than everyone knew. He had been trying to avoid the talk about his issues with food, he had realized that eating diner beside Ron worked so well because of fucking course his stupidly small portions would look normal in comparison with his, the downside of it is that Hermione was really observant and Draco was scared of the moment she will confront him just like she did with his shaking hands.
"You must know you're so hard to buy something," began saying Draco while handing him a box "but I really hope you like it, if not you can return it"
"I don't know, he ran when Theo dropped his wrist due me punching him, shit,"
Harry had always hated when people said that, because sometimes things weren’t going to be alright and that’s how life was, so to be lied to make him feel stupid. But he understood where he was coming from, because he had been there, telling everyone it was going to be okay when he was on the verge of giving up because honestly maybe it wasn’t going to be okay.
and not someone else," Draco explained with a soft smile and Harry returned it giving the boy a kiss on his temple.
And well, this place has changed a lot since he first visited, he had finally got rid of the awful portrait of Walburga Black, and had redecorated a lot, including putting electricity so the muggle artefacts he bought could work. Harry knew it was far from perfect, and nowhere close to the luxury stuff Draco was probably used to but when he saw the sparkling eyes of the said boy his stomach did a flip.
"No, I'm not okay but I will be, we both will be," he answered truthfully and kissed Draco's temple.
"Oh yeah, that reminds me," said the blond when they were close to Hogwarts, "my aunt gave me this, she said that my mom used to enjoy taking pictures back in school" and with that, he took out a camera from his pocket, it was old but still usable so Harry took it and smiled.
Song Chapter: 34+35 by Ariana Grande
"Sorry, just... need to get used to seeing Clouds without fearing the worst, a force of habit I guess." His boyfriend smiled and then looked at the small package Draco had in his hands. "What do you have there? Is it for me?" Harry asked excited, it reminded him of Teddy and his heart fluttered at it.
“Because if he has a mission then that little encounter at Borgin and Burkes would make more sense, don’t you agree?”
Chapter song: Highschool sweethearts by Melanie Martinez
Which is why he needed to stop wondering about how things could've been and start focusing on making Theo happy enough for them to have an heir, it was not a secret that being part of a pure-blood family came with a lot of responsibilities. You should always be in your best behaviour, you can't be weak, you can't be dumb, you must be the best at everything and never fail, failing equals punishment and punishments needed to be good enough for you to regret failing in the first place. So when his father found out that a muggle born was beating him in some subjects he locked him in his bedroom until he could repeat word for word all of his books, getting a stinging hex every time he was wrong. And then there was quidditch, he had to fly until he couldn't do it anymore, he couldn't remember how many broken bones he had that summer, but in the end, Harry Potter always beat him at quidditch. When the Dark Lord heard that he was never received the cruciatus curse before he gave free liberty to all the death eaters to throw the curse at him whenever they felt like it, his aunt loved this and used it every time he failed to close his mind while teaching him legilimency and occlumensy.
"You used to be better at casting glamour spells, you know?" said Pansy when they arrived to the classroom. "And I don't really know why you bother putting them on, when you know damn well it doesn't work when people are truly watching you, and if you think that just because we avoid talking about certain things means that we don't care then you don't know us at all Draco, so cut the bullshit and tell what's going on"
“I don’t know, lately I’ve been having trouble with it, maybe I’ll shave it off,” he answered instead, why couldn’t they leave him alone? It was just hair.
"I forgive you Harry, please forgive yourself, because I don't think we can be happy if we don't let go of a lot of things we did in the past, okay?"
“Because I deserve it,” he answered without thinking and when he realized what he had just said he covered his mouth with his hands and started to panic.
"Feisty, aren't we? I'm surprised you're this brave without your bodyguards"
"What? The fact that you are dating the saviour of the world or that you manage to be friends with Ginny Weasley?” joked Harry while finishing the braid, and wondering whether he could put some daisies there without Draco noticing.
“Well, it’s a place where people live, you know? Like Hogsmeade” joked Harry and Draco punch him lightly in the arm and Harry laughed loudly, “well, to be honest, if I explain it to you it’s going to sound really weird so why don’t you come with me?”
He dragged his feet across the room, deciding that a quick shower could solve his problems, deep down he knew this wasn't true but there was no harm in lying to himself. What he didn't expect was to see the perfect face of Harry, his green eyes filled with sleepiness still, and his pants hanging dangerously low from his hips, Draco still couldn't figure out how Harry went from a scrawny kid to this Adonis. How he managed to get so tall was a mystery, and how his back became so wide and his skin tanned nicely during the summer, his strong hands and his beautiful abs and-.
“Oh yes. What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen is a curious little potion, known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly known referred to as-”
Even though the dark mark was almost faded, it was still there, haunting him 24/7. Reminding him of what he did, everything that happened, the suffering of everyone that was caused by the side he and his parents were part of. Draco tried to remove it countless times, from cutting to burning, and for a while, it felt so good, Draco couldn't care less about the scars that were left behind and even if he could remove with magic, he didn't. He enjoyed the reminder of being in pain, it was a comfort thing. Theo noticed the scars and made fun of him, but in his words 'he was already too scarred by the war' so he should be grateful that someone still wanted him, even if it was just a physical thing.
"A picture would last longer, you know?" Harry's voice interrupted Draco's thoughts, making him blush slightly
"Yeah, I'll give muggles that, they sure know how to make comfy clothes that manage to make my arse look amazing," the blond said as he checked himself out on the mirror.
“Because you were the chosen one and liked the attention?” suggested Malfoy with a tone of sarcasm that made Harry smile.
2 hours later Draco had a decent amount of muggle clothes, and Harry did too because accordingly to the blond 'if he was going to walk down the streets of Paris, he better be looking like he belongs there'.
Just for now.
"Harry James Potter, just because magic exists doesn't mean you get to make a mess every single time you come back home from work!" Draco reprimanded Harry, he could be such a child sometimes, and that was saying a lot considering they had a toddler who likes making a lot of messes.
"I can't believe I just did that," was the first thing either of them said while walking back to the common room.
"Can't I be excited to eat Molly's treacle tart?"
“Mmm not really, Pansy and Blaise are going to go to Hogsmeade and I don’t really feel like attending to the Halloween feast” answered Draco, they were walking side to side and the fact that Harry was now taller than Draco made the raven-haired boy smiled, it wasn’t by much but enough to be noticeable. “And you? Do you have any plans?”
"You're a dork, but sadly I'm in love with you."
“Nonsense, we'll sort you out. Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out,”
"So do I, so do I," mumbled Draco against Harry's lips and they began to kiss again, and if it wasn't because one of the Ravenclaw girls threw a book to them yelling for them to get a room, Draco was pretty sure Harry's lips wasn't going to be the only thing he would be tasting that night.
"It's not about who had it worse darling, is about how we cope with it, there were many times where I didn't know what to do, or who I was. I had nightmares almost every night and I felt so anxious all the time," he started to tell as Draco started to play with his fingers, "but it got better, it was really hard and I wanted to give up many times, but I didn't because I wasn't alone. And you aren't either Draco, you're not alone," Harry mumbled against the blond's temple before placing a soft kiss.
"I was never angry with you, you know? I was so grateful once you did it that I wanted to say thank you, I was gonna throw myself out from the Astronomy tower one of those days, either way, so you technically made my life easier, I got so angry at Snape for saving me that he almost took me to St. Mongo's"
"It's not Draco's fault that you guys can't think of two things at the same time," said the red-haired girl and got back to his conversation with Pansy and Blaise while Ron ran to Hermione so he could complain a bit more.
Harry was about to talk when the trolley lady came to offer sweets, at which Ron smiled begging Harry to do the same thing he did in the first year, so a couple of minutes later their wagon was filled with all kinds of sweets. Hermione began scolding Ron for eating so fast and so many sweets, saying that he was going to get cavities, Harry saw a small smile in Malfoy’s face and that made him smile as well.
And so here he was, in front of his cauldron with no idea where to start, that was until he opened the book and saw notes all over the place written in terrible handwriting (not that he could say that he was better, but he could at least brag about it being more legible thank this one), deciding that this notes may help him to make something more acceptable than whatever he would’ve managed without them he started to follow those instructions instead.
“How?” Was all Draco asked accepting gladly the cup and getting closer to Harry who just sat next to him.
Then why was he summoned here? Why did all the weight of his family suddenly settle on his shoulders? Why must he do this for a master he never intended to serve? Why if he hadn’t touched the Dark Lord it suddenly became his? He didn’t want this, please someone make it stop… but of course no one did, no one dared to say anything about his marred forearm, not even his mother. He quickly learned that his father wasn’t the scariest thing in the world like he had thought all this time, no, that place was quickly replaced by his aunt and the Dark Lord, and all the others, but worst of all, by his mother. Because it scared him to death how the only person he ever loved and loved him back, turned their back at him while he begged not to be chosen for this.
"Are you ready?" Harry asked once they were ready to go out to the world, he could see the anxiety in Draco's eyes, but also the excitement which only meant he wanted to do this but he was scared, and Harry knew how to deal with that kind of fear. So he took Draco's hand and smiled warmly.
"Do you ever wonder what is like to fell in love with someone?"
Maybe Harry Potter should have realized that he was different he was when he didn’t have a room for himself as his cousin did, or the way his parent's death was a topic that had to be avoided at all costs, or how his other classmates had loving families and favorite foods and he didn’t, or the way his hair grew from night to morning no matter what his aunt did to it.
At least this was something Harry was used to, Malfoy running away, it gave him a little bit of comfort considering how off his behaviour has been since they met again. Sighing he cracks his neck and promised himself no never fell asleep in such an uncomfortable position ever again, deciding it was still early he figured he could take a shower before heading to breakfast. Gosh, he was starving.
"What's a moo bee?"
And at this point, Draco Malfoy feared life way more than he feared death, if it wasn’t because of the stupid love he felt for his mother he would throw himself out of the window the second he was left alone, and that was almost never. Between Oclumensy lessons with Bellatrix, long study hours about curses and poisons with his mother, and what Greyback liked to call “stress relief sessions” that left him bloodied and dirty.
Harry had learned, so far, that Draco Malfoy was not as bad as he thought he was. That he had saved, or attempted, to save his life three times and only succeeded once. That his hair is slightly wavy but he used a lot of hair products to make it straight as his father liked. That he used to smoke because he learned in muggle bars that it could kill you but stopped once he started to cough during quidditch matches Ron, Ginny, Draco and he has. That his blue eyes looked grey when he was sad and that he cries so much. He also learned he has a sweet-tooth and despises coffee. He loves the way his hands look while making potions and he loves how he bites his underlip when he's concentrated. And he absolutely loves how he is now shorter than Harry because that way Harry can always give him forehead kisses in an attempt of erasing his worries.
“Did you ever wondered why I tried everything I could to be back at Hogwarts every year? No matter how many times I was almost murdered?”
Harry opened Draco's thighs with his hands while casting a wandless spell to lube Draco's entrance, he started to massage it slowly loving how the blond squirmed and moaned asking for more, then he slowly introduced one finger exploring his way in until that didn't felt enough and decided to add another one, he loved the way Draco looked spread out like that, with a thin layer of sweat covering his pale skin and with all the love marks coming to life with every second it passed. The thought of being inside was becoming too much just when found Draco's prostate, and that loud scream was enough for Harry to pull put his fingers and replace them with his own hard dick.
"How are you feeling love?"
"You're so fucking hot, you have no idea what you do to me," mumbled Harry in Draco's lips causing the Slytherin to moan.
telling me that
"I can't stay, I was just passing by to check mom, I have other plans," Draco wanted to leave, and if he was going to be punished for it he could at least give Lucius a reason to do it.
"Dad, stop, I can't breathe," Lily begged between laughs and gasps for air, so Draco stopped and hugged her.
“Liquid luck,” Hermione interrupted, oh he sure didn’t miss how she loved to interrupt everyone in order to prove she was smart, and quite a bad habit she had there.
"No matter how many scars I have?" Draco asked fearing the question more than the answer
"Are you okay?" a voice asks and Draco just nods, "why do you lie about being okay Draco?"
“I’m sorry, I didn’t find you right away and they offered to share with me” explained the blond with a quiet voice while rubbing his shoulder.
They both knew it wouldn't be too long until the word spread around everywhere, The Daily Prophet wasn't as bad as they expected it but some on the comments still hurt. Harry was still scared about what could happen to Draco if everything became too much, no matter how many times the other boy reassures him that his scars were old and that whenever he thought of relapsing or if everything felt like too much again he would tell him so, and he also was a little bit calmer now that he was certain Clouds was there for his boyfriend.
Okay, yes, he had feelings for the boy. But this was like that time where he had feelings for Cho and that ended with a very awkward kiss. So he began to wonder who he could talk about this without them having a meltdown over the fact that he was in love with his former enemy.
"Oh shut up Harry, I just want to look edgier"
"I had a part of Voldemort soul in me, you know? And I sometimes wonder if that's why I was so brave sometimes, or well... Reckless. Sometimes I felt this horrible hate inside me and during the war, it got worse, because not only I had to deal with everyone's expectations, and my own fear but also his emotions, his fear and anger." Harry stopped and Draco cleaned a tear from the tanned boy. "I hated it so much, but what I hated the most was when he allowed me to see through his eyes, because I got to see what it was like to be feared and somewhat respected, and it scared me that I kinda liked it at times because I figured my life would be so much easier if people treated me like that, but now I know that I would've hated if people treated me like that because I hate being special."
"I never want you to be alone, come here," Harry's voice was raspy, which made Draco blush as he sat beside he green-eyed boy. "Do you want to talk about it?" Harry asked, making sure his tone was inviting and not demanding.
Harry woke up to a warm body beside him, it was weird to not feel alone in the morning, or at any time to be honest. Harry was used to feel alone, and sometimes it was okay, but most of the time it wasn't; because his loneliness was that kind of thing that felt as if a part of Voldemort still lived inside him and it sucked. But being next to someone you loved, it didn't matter what kind of love it was, felt as if the brightest light was inside you and it created such a warm feeling Harry loved.
Gladly, Draco Malfoy was smart, so smart and good at reading situations, years of surviving out of instinct had thought him that there was always another way to make things work, maybe not the way he wanted it but also to avoid the worst-case scenario. So he decided to appeal his case and asked for a task for him to feel “worthy enough” of such privilege as taking the mark meant. Luckily, the Dark Lord accepted, surprised by this new-found loyalty in the youngest Malfoy, but of course, good things don’t happen to him, because fixing a cabinet was an easy thing, killing the headmaster (one of the most powerful wizards in the whole world and history) that even his oh-so-called-master feared, well, that was a death wish.
“Potter,” said Pansy, looking at him with a look full of suspicion and all Harry could do was wave at her with an awkward smile at what she rolled her eyes and took Malfoy walking about dragging the boy with her.
The only times he felt like himself, whatever that was anyways, was when he was with Harry. And that scared him deeply because he was getting so used to the other boy's company that when the school year was over he knew it would be the end of his friendship as well. And that were the times when he started to wonder how it would feel to be someone else. What if he wouldn't have been a git back then when he first met Harry, what if he didn't insult Ron that day? What if he had never called Hermione a mudblood? What if he never treated Theo like a burden rather than a friend? What if he didn't have played with Pansy's feelings and never slept with Blaise out of spite of her leaving him alone when he needed her the most? Would he have been friends with the Golden Trio? Had he been a Slytherin at all? Would Theo treat him differently? Would he have received the dark mark still? He could've accepted Dumbeldore's help that night, he could've just forgotten about his parents the way his father did, but his mother didn't deserve that, even if now she was doing what she believed was best, she deserved so much more.
Where Draco doesn’t understand muggle Halloween
"Clouds? That's a soft name for a dragon, I love it," the boy with glasses teased the other one and the blond laughed. "Yeah, it was him, he sent a message in a fireball and I knew something was wrong before the message was cool enough to read it. You cast Fiendfyre, the aurors arrived minutes later after I did and your mother had already cast the counterspell. Theo and his dad were nowhere to be seen and your father was too shocked that I was crying over your still body. You burned to arm, Molly helped Hermione fix it, so it shouldn't scar... not that you could really notice a scar in your arm"
It was already quite late, past 12 Harry figured, there were only him and a Ravenclaw guy who was finishing a letter to send tomorrow, or so he heard. But soon it was only Harry in front of the fireplace, it was one of those nights where sleep was hard to conceal, thankfully he was passed over the flashbacks and feeling guilty over everything that happened, he saw a mind-healer during summer. At first, it was to shut up Hermione but after the second session he actually began to feel a lot better, he discovered a lot of things about himself and came in peace with the idea that he was put on a position where he had no choice, and that he did the best he could and no one blamed him, so why was he blaming himself?
Harry saw how Draco blushed but try to hide it behind his Slytherin scarf, mumbling a quiet ‘thank you’. They stayed like that for a while before any of them talked again, Harry loved how natural this silences felt, there was no need for filling them.
"Why did you testify in my favour? You owed me nothing, and I know you feel like you did for the things I did for you, but then again you saved me right back so... I just don't get it, more than not getting it I feel like I don't deserve it"
“A word, please?” he asked Draco and after a quick exchange of looks with Pansy, he grabs the boys arm, not wanting to let him go. But, when Malfoy nodded to Nott and offered half a smile to his friends before he left Harry, they both understood that there was nothing he could do to make the other boy understand that he already made the mistake of living to someone else’s expectations once. And honestly, Harry didn’t understand his need of doing it again, but then again, there was a lot he didn’t understand about Draco Malfoy.
In the end, Draco knew what he had to do, deep down he always knew but was too scared to admit it was the best thing for the both of them, for him and most importantly for Harry. He had put a lot of thought into this, even before Harry confessed, but the green-eyed boy caught him unprepared so he had to take more time, and that sucked because the least Draco had was time to lose.
"Don't worry, I'm sure Molly is going to be very busy asking Percy about all the wedding details, and I mean, why shouldn't she? He has the worst taste ever and her fiancé too."
Harry felt uneasy when he saw Draco sitting on the sill of a window in the tower, his feet hanging to the abysm where their old headmaster had fallen, his back was facing him and Harry loved the way Draco’s hair was longer now and slightly wavy, unlike his father’s straight one.
Harry felt a little bit out of place, the dishes on the menu had difficult names and Blaise was asking what kind of wine they wanted. But part of a relationship was to learn to enjoy your partner interests, even if that meant smiling like an idiot while your boyfriend ordered the closest thing to fish and chips. Then again, Draco had suffered too because being so exposed to the muggle and wizarding world has been hard, but the beautiful smile that only grew bigger with time was so worth it.
"Oh no, I must have left it in Hogwarts, but if it's too urgent I can just buy you a new book," Draco bit his lip so he could just be finished with this day.
"Oh c'mon, it's not that bad, Draco got one on the holidays and he barely flinched, we can go together! I wanted to get one as well but I got scared"
And maybe they weren't totally okay, but at least they were getting there, right?
His heart? What was that? He wasn’t raised to follow his heart, following your heart lead to being heartbroken and sadness. But then again, Draco was already sad so a little bit more of sadness wouldn’t hurt him, right? But that was a lie because Harry was anything but sadness to him, whenever he was with him he felt like everything would be alright.
"Mo-vie, it's like a theatre play but you can watch it again and again, at any time you want from the comfort of your home.
Harry doesn’t know how long he was there, but judging by his cold nose and freezing feet he figures it must have been more than an hour, he had miss diner but it was okay, he could just sneak into the kitchen for some quick meal. THE KITCHENS! Draco loved sweet things, and the chocolate parfait the blond love was only served on Christmas.
The more he learned about the world, the less sure he felt about his knowledge, all the blood purity stuff that was craved inside his brain sounded wrong and it made him feel confused, because if all muggles were dumb then why Hermione Granger was the brightest witch of her age? And if all blood-traitors were so bad then why Ron Weasley had so many friends? And if half-bloods were a disgrace, why Harry Potter became the savior of their world? And even though he grew up with so many doubts he never dared to do anything about it, until the Quidditch cup came just before his 4rth year, where the confirmation he needed about his father being a bad person finally came. That was the third time he had been completely terrified of his dad, seeing him with that mask that made it look as if his real face was the actual mask and not the silver one. He remembers seeing the golden trio and all the Weasley’s and all the chaos and in his own snarky way tried to tell Harry that he needed to get the fuck out of there, and take his friends with him. And it came out so wrong, but he didn’t care about what anyone thought about him anymore, he just wanted out of this life.
Where Draco is tired of everything going wrong for him
“I wouldn’t have brought you if I didn’t” he answered as he approached the graves, the first time he had been here was with Hermione, and since then Harry never returned here alone. It didn’t felt right, so he always returned with someone important to him, and even if he didn’t stay for long it was enough for him to tell his parents about that person, and this time that person was Draco because even if he has always been an important part of his life this time, this time it was a different kind of important.
"We're not going to put our kids through hell, right?" asked Draco trying to joke, but the pain behind that question was evident.
"Did you just compared me to a magical creature Potter?"
“I… I’m sorry for being horrible to you all these years, I don’t know why you’re being kind to me but if this is a joke I would rather to just be hexed already” His voice trembled too much and it was painfully soft to believe this was Malfoy speaking.
A couple of minutes later, Pansy left as well claiming that she and Daphne had important business to attend to, and Draco was alone, again. He wondered if Moaning Myrtle ever felt alone, if she ever missed being alive or if she had anyone to talk to.
Song chapter: we fell in love in October by Girl in Red
Sadly, Draco Malfoy still craved approval, he craved to feel useful, and even if he only got praises when he did horrible things he could ignore it because he wanted it so bad, and if to be worthy again of those words also meant taking the Dark mark then so be it.
and everything turned out to be alright
"I love you too, I love you so much that I think you'll like a surprise I have for you," and with that said a Patronus appeared in the room.
The talk kept going smoothly, even Neville and Seamus joined after a while, it really was the perfect day until someone entered the common room yelling Harry's name. In less than a second, he was in front of Pansy who looked white as a ghost and had trouble breathing.
"Harry, please," Draco stuttered and Harry moan against the blond's dick which cause the later to let out a loud moan, "I'm gonna cum if you keep doing that," and that was enough for Harry to stop sucking his boyfriend, instead he start to massage those pale thighs that drove him crazy, and after a few seconds the started to suck on them too, taking his time to make sure every mark was red enough for it to be replaced with a bruise later. Once there was no space left he felt how Draco grab his neck to pull him into a passionate kiss, they both moan while doing so because both of their dicks kept grinding onto each other while they kissed.
“I mean, is not the Gryffindors common room but we’ll make it work,” said Seamus and Harry had to agree with it, because in the end all these changes were happening and the faster they make it work the better.
Did Harry want to know? Was he ready for another piece in this puzzle? Remembering the screams and the tears and the fear in Draco’s eyes was enough for Harry to nod at Luna who started to put flowers in her hair.
"Well, mom always said it's not about the way it looks but the way it tastes so today, you're going to learn the famous Weasley recipe of Treacle pudding," she announced and proceeded to ask for all the ingredients to the house-elves, constantly reassuring them that she was okay doing it and giving them a couple of galleons as thanks for their help. "Once Hermione gives you the talk about SPEW there's no going back," she said jokingly but with pain behind her eyes, which made him laugh.
“But as they say the third is the charm and after giving me a particularly heavy calming draught he did what he must, I tried to let the potion work but it hurt so much, he didn’t care about me crying, I mean… I deserved it, it’s my karma for being on the bad side, and after all, I do enjoy having sex with blokes so-“
Con – He had only known Draco as his enemy, not his friend.
“I won’t lie and say I didn’t enjoy the attention from time to time, but most Hogwarts became my home from the moment I put a step on it, it is still my home, to be honest, I dreaded coming back with my muggle relatives so much that at some point I remember thinking that maybe getting killed wasn’t such a bad idea anymore” Harry’s voice was shaky and he knew he was on the verge of crying, but it felt so good to tell this to someone other than his therapist that he didn’t care about the consequences of it. “I mean, now that everything is over I don’t think like that anymore, I have bad days where everything gets too much or I have nightmares about things ending up different, but I think I’m getting better so I don’t think I ever wanted to die but rather I just wanted a break of existing, you know?”
They stayed silent for a few minutes, Draco was trying to get a grip of his thoughts and Harry was just giving him time, so when Harry felt the other boy throw himself into his arms he was sure as hell surprised.
“I’m sorry for calling you that, it was uncalled for and maybe if I would’ve been brighter I would’ve realized that repeating all the things my father said about how someone’s worth is measured by the purity of their blood was such a toxic thing to do” he replied with a little bit more of confidence.
year, he, for a moment felt 12 again. For a second Harry felt at ease; because Draco Malfoy was easy, he was so easy because Harry's anger never scared the other, on the contrary, he always fought back never for a second caring whether he was the savior of the wizarding world or not. Draco Malfoy was a constant, was his other half in the whole Yin and Yang situation they had going on since that afternoon at Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions where they had met 6 years ago.
“Well, yeah, but… This is different, why would he believe me?”
1.- Pro – He was stupidly handsome
"Because you're not broken Draco, you're not an object, you're hurt and have a lot of problems, but there's nothing wrong with you, nothing we can't fix anyways"
"Okay," and they kissed again, "so just you know, my amortentia smelled like mint and apples, I never knew why until I smelled you in the mornings"
“Oh, and Harry, I would love to spend Christmas with you.”
"Why must you always try to give me a heart attack?"
"Well, you won't be able to forget after today cause you're going down Malfoy," said Ron and so the fame was on.
“So you found out about Harry’s feeling in what? A month? And it took you YEARS to figure out I liked you? You’re bloody impressive Ronald” She laughed and he punched her lightly on the arm
“Do you have any plans tomorrow night?” Harry asked as he returned a book to its place.
“I don’t think I’m going to play Quidditch this year, I have a lot on my plate, and honestly doesn’t feel as thrilling as before,” half-lied the blond.
“Thank you,” the black-haired boy mumbled trying not to blush, it wasn’t a secret that he was bisexual, I mean, having men like Oliver Wood and Cedric Diggory around you made it hard to be straight. But also you got girls like Cho Chang and Ginny Weasley, just thinking about how bad he failed at all his relationships made him smile, he sure hopes he won't mess up with his true soulmate.
the changes, because some of them were wrong.
"I like it too, but you know what I love the most? How pretty you are, and how confident you've gotten over this months, that you decided to take charge of your life again and let me be part of it," Harry smiles while kissing Draco's temple, "but what I love the most is how you look with flowers in your head because you remind me of a nymph"
Song Chapter: Happily by One Direction
“You defeated Voldemort and you’re afraid of telling Draco that you like him? Geez, and when I thought that a war was needed for me to realize I liked Hermione was pathetic enough you come here saying all this” joked the ginger-head and Harry throws a cushion at him as he exited the common room. “Good luck lover boy!” He heard before the door closed.
"We can stop, you know? Just because you said you wanted to doesn't mean that we have to go all the way through it," Harry assured and Draco nodded slowly
They had two weeks off due to Easter and they had a lot of plans, which included: Teddy's birthday party, a weekend at the Burrow and a week off at Paris, apparently, the Malfoy's had a villa there and Pansy really wanted to go shopping with Hermione, saying that she should start dressing as the beautiful and empowered woman she was. Harry just wanted to be away from everything and a change of air sounded good.
"I hate to wrap things, I hate it so much," complained Harry as he wrapped Neville's gift and Draco just laughed at his misery, it was almost midnight and they were in the kitchen drinking tea with soft music playing on the background, it felt stupidly domestic. "I'm done!" he screamed and Draco got scared because of it so it was Harry's turn to laugh.
"I think I'll take to the Aurors now, the sooner I do the quicker we get rid of them," and with that Harry was alone again.
“I- I would love that, Harry” he answered after a few seconds and then turned his attention back to Hermione who was already telling him his mistakes.
you know? He has such good manners and even when he has a sharp tongue he sure know how to use it," the other boy joked and Draco felt repolsed, how could he talk like that in front of him, or the adults? But Lucius just laugh and joked about how the Dark Lord said similar things.
“I think dad is getting permission to spend Christmas at home, and I’m scared of what could happen, not because I fear him, I mean, I already know what he’s capable of,” he half-laughed, “but because I know he’s going to invite Theodore and his parents so they can talk more about the arrangement and I don’t was
"I don't know, sometimes it's easier to lie than, to tell the truth," he shrugs
"I took a lot of stupid decisions as well, I mean, you already know about that. But I would do it all over again if my end game was you"
And then his Hogwarts letter came, maybe that was one of the happiest days of his life, he still dreams about the small smile on his father’s face proud that his heir was actually a wizard and not a useless squib. Hogwarts became the only place where Draco could be loud and not so cautious like he was at home, but he had to ruin it, didn’t he? He wasn’t like his mom, who could make friends with everyone and be charismatic, no; he had to be like his father who only knew how to make allies out of fear and manipulation. And Draco hated it, he always knew he hated it so much, and what he hated more is that no matter how much he loathes his father, he still did everything for him to be proud.
"Whatever you want love, whatever you want" the green-eyed boy answered as he pushed carefully Draco on the bed so Harry could be on top of the other boy. "You're so fucking pretty," said Harry while leaving a trail of kisses and hickeys all over Draco's neck while setting himself on either side of Draco's thighs.
Watching her helping Draco made him understand that maybe he wasn’t a bad student but rather she just sucked at explaining things, Harry couldn’t figure out how Draco was getting all the things she was saying but he and Ron could never keep up with her and her brain.
In another time, Draco would've laughed at those words and hex the person, but now he could feel himself relaxing and melting in Harry's arms, the same way he did at their wedding where the green-eyed boy said those words, and so far... everything was alright. They sold the manor the moment Lucius died, his mother had already left to France the minute her house-arrest ended and was happily living with Andromeda. Teddy came to live with them 2 years ago when his grandma claimed she was too old to go over schoolwork again, and after all, it was Harry's idea to send him to a muggle school until his Hogwarts letter came.
"Shut up idiot," spat Harry while trying to calm Blaise down.
"-I'm just telling you that you would look ridiculous with that haircut, and only mom does a good job with those kinds of spells anyways"
“Hello, Draco here says you’re friends and as weird this situation is the Slytherin table is being too stupid for their own good so you’ll have to deal with us” she explained filling two plates with random food and putting one in front of Draco and one in front of her. “Nice to see you, Luna, those are really pretty earrings, do they keep the nargles away too?” she asked as if she and the girl were lifetime friends, and honestly maybe they were considering that Pansy had many friends outside Slytherin and Luna liked to talk to whoever listened to her without making fun of her.
"Fire? What is he talking about? Is anybody hurt? Are you okay? Is my mother okay?" Harry stopped Draco with a quiet 'shh' and gave the ginger a bad look.
“Well, I was going to go to Godric's Hollow for a bit and then Trick-or-Treating with Teddy” answered Harry as they exit the library, he could sense Draco’s confusion.
year she gave up on it and moved on after all Slytherin was full of beautiful gits.
"I'm sorry to hear that father, I had already accepted someone else's proposal and it would've been rude to cancel at last minute"
"Your desires are orders my little prince"
And with that Draco smiled softly and walked away from Theo, sending Clouds to search Harry so he could meet him at McGonagall's office, he was ready to do what he should have done months ago, he was not afraid, he was ready, he was... he was feeling the emotions getting back to him, the fear and anxiety, his heart began to beat way faster than usual and his vision began to blur.
"You know, I tend to do a lot of stupid stuff but this time I have no idea what you are talking about," half-laughs the blond and another voice chimes in.
And so together they did it, Professor McGonagall listened to all of it, she stayed quiet during Draco's small breakdowns, she didn't make any comment nor reaction, she let Harry get angry again over all of this and she let them finished before she sighed and got up from her chair. She walked over a small table and prepared herself a cup of tea, and then proceeded to drowned it in one gulp.
"Oh yes, it was lovely, very lovely," his mothers eyes were unfocused, she seemed quite different and it almost reminded him on how she used to act around the Dark Lord.
"I'm sorry, I fucked up again, I'm so sorry," Draco began to cry and Harry looked at him with soft eyes and sat in the bed so he could hug him.
Draco stopped walking and tilted his head to the side, confusion evident in his face. Even though they had been friends for almost two months the blond still felt weird to be asked out together, sometimes he still thought it was like in the old times and he once told Harry he was still waiting for all this to be a joke. But at that moment Harry could see that Draco wanted to say ‘yes’ but didn’t know how so he offered an inviting smile to him and with that the other boy nodded.
Draco knew this was a stupid idea, don't get him wrong, he was totally capable of seeing how this could fail badly and exposed once again how little he cared about himself. Then again Draco was never known for making good decisions, let's remember how he took the dark mark and how he used to bully every single kid that crossed his way. But he also knew that he was tired of being a nuisance for everyone and that he needed to be careful with how much magic he was using to cover up his feeling and appearance overall because at the moment any side effects appeared, Hermione or Blaise would notice the stupid things that he did and Draco wasn’t in the mood for being scolded so he needed a plan for everyone to be distracted.
“Well, that sure ain’t gonna make this whole situation easier,” said Harry hiding his face between his hands as a sign of exasperation and he heard Ginny sigh.
“May I braid your hair? Luna taught me this morning and I think you would look beautiful” say Harry awkwardly and when the blond gives him the biggest smile yet seen and nods he thinks that maybe that feeling that’s been messing up his head was love, but he had yet to find what type it was.
"If I remember correctly, I never needed bodyguards around you, because when it comes to magic you're completely useless"
Harry loves the sweet tooth Draco had, and now he and Ron always had some sort of sweet on their robes in case Draco felt light-headed, which didn't happen as much as it did before, mainly because Pansy would practically force-feed the boy, on the other hand, Draco just began to have more appetite and he always said that his mother taught him that it was rude to not eat while the other person did and vice-versa, so Harry made sure to never skip meals when Draco was with him, which was more time than he had anticipated.
the older he got the less physical contact his mother provided because it was improper for a pureblood to be hugging his mother at the age of 10, only weak boys did so and no Malfoy would be cataloged as a  “weak”.
"He's gonna be fine Pans, he's not going to be alone," Harry butts in and Pansy glared at him
Draco woke up in the infirmary, where once this strong euphoria was nothing, he felt numb. He was scared of opening his eyes because he could feel Harry's scent next to him, and he was too scared of confrontation.
Malfoy on the other hand struggled the whole class, the stupid smell of Amortentia still lingering in the room made his head hurt, the sweet smell of something he couldn’t figure out was driving him insane and his trembling fingers made the task of cutting almost impossible. Pansy must’ve noticed his increasing stress because without saying a word she exchanged his mediocre chopped anemone-like growth on the back of Murtlap’s pieces with hers.
"And you also need to buy those gifts you're missing," reminded him Draco and the black-haired boy rolled his eyes, he had totally forgotten about that. "And I think I know what crazy thing I want to do"
“May I?” He asked once beside him and Draco just shrugged, so Harry took the invitation, “aren’t you cold?”
“You are a horrible person Draco Malfoy, how dare you?” a voice shouted and you could hear it come closer each word “how dare you to leave me alone with Blaise being quiet most of the time because he was reading his stupid book and Theo being an asshole as he always is! If it wasn’t for Daphne I would be death from boredom” Pansy hit Malfoy’s shoulder as she finished, Harry saw a girl grabbing Parkinson and telling her about not hurting the boy.
"She cares a lot about you, it's cute," said Harry as they start to walk out from Platform 9 3/4 onto the busy streets of London.
Where we learn about the bruises in Malfoy's face and Pansy decides that maybe having the golden trio around is not as bad as it sounds.
"How was father? I heard he came by," Draco dared to ask
"Are you okay?" was the first thing he asked when he realized there was no real danger around them, and Draco nodded slowly as they both tried to even their breath.
Sadly their holidays came to an end tomorrow, and o-fucking-course something had to ruin them for he and Draco, because when they returned to the house (more like mansion, but accordingly to Blaise this place was too small for being call that), there was an owl with a letter waiting for the blond.
They entered the common room together and sat on the couch, it felt so natural that he couldn’t care less about some judgmental looks from some people and if someone had a problem with his friendship with Draco Malfoy they could come and say it to his face.
Harry started to laugh and begin serving milk in a glass and deciding whether he fancied something salty or sweet for breakfast.
“He wanted to have sex,” he started, his voice low and raspy from all the crying, his forehead leaned it Harry’s shoulder. “And I was okay with it, I mean, sex is great, you know? But after a few minutes of what he called foreplay, I was not getting the reaction that he expected and he got mad, maybe I’m too broken to feel like that anymore, you know? But he didn’t care, I mean, it’s a miracle my mother managed to make this deal when it’s well known among the followers of the dark lord that all I ever did right was suck dick” he said as he laughed drily.
Song Chapter: Say you won’t let go by James Arthur
It took 10 minutes to finally clear the space and that is when Harry realized that only 5 Slytherin’s had come back, 11 Ravenclaws, 5 Hufflepuffs and 8 Gryffindors. Not bad, honestly, he thought it would be fewer people considering the circumstances, and he actually expected that the Ravenclaws outnumbered them.
“Sorry, but you once told me that I could kiss you whenever you said something stupid, and that sounded pretty stupid for me,” the raven-haired boy laughed lightly, but Draco just stared at his boyfriend, his normally pale grey eyes were now darker and filled with lust, and he just closed the space between them again only this time kissing him harder and with a lot of neediness.
So he laughed lightly when he felt a small hand on his shoulder, Harry puts his own hand over Draco's and squeezed it lightly. He felt Draco sit beside him and he just let himself go and hug the smaller boy, he doesn't know why he was being so emotional, but the fact that he could feel Draco's spine and ribs under three layers of clothes made him cry harder. They stayed like this for a little bit, it felt like hours but it couldn't have been more than 10 minutes, the street was empty but he honestly couldn’t care less about someone finding them out like this. At that moment Draco felt like home and the thought of it scared Harry but instead of running away like he would’ve done some years before he just embraces that feeling and accepts the fact that maybe he was falling in love with the git.
“I’ll be miserable,” he answered truthfully.
“Well, I’m going to go to the quidditch pitch, I’m going to try out for chaser this year, you coming?” asked Blaise, the incident of that morning long forgotten, but Draco shook his head.
beyond your limits but give me all the time in the world to tell you about my scars."
One day he was foolish enough to enter his father’s studio, one of the many places he wasn’t allowed to be in, but it had been a week since he saw a pretty necklace his father brought home, he dreamed about how shiny it was and how pretty the emeralds reflect the light. He loved shiny things because it reminded him of the stars, and the sweet voice of his mother telling him about constellations, he just wanted to get a good look at it, maybe put it close to the window so he could see it reflect the light again, just for a little bit, he was going to be so quick. But Draco Malfoy learned at shortage that luck was never on his side, nothing would ever turn out the way he wanted, but rather the way it was planned for him.
“Well, you know what they say, once you meet your true love you start to see how others feel” and with that, they start kissing, so Harry has to clear his voice to catch the attention of the couple
"I didn't think this would get wrong, it was a safe choice," Draco began to explain and Harry hugged him tighter.
"Do you know how to cook? I've been craving my mom's Treacle pudding and even if the house-elves one is pretty good nothing like doing it with the secret recipe," she said once they arrived at the kitchen.
Con – He hated how well his eyes reflected Draco’s feelings, and it hurt him to see how they always seemed sad darkening the beautiful shade of grey they were.
Chapter Song: Wonder by Shawn Mendes
Pansy ended up breaking up with Blaise, since they had way more differences between each other that outgrew the amazing sex, that accordingly Pansy, they had, Draco is glad they ended up as friends and that Blaise is now happily married with Daphne Greengrass, Draco swears that their kids are going to be so fucking pretty. On the other hand, Pansy decided that it was time that wizarding fashion evolved and she partnered up with Luna and Susan Bones to make their own clothing line, the diversity they offer never cease to amaze him.
"I love you"
They fell asleep together, warming each other hearts as they keep away each other nightmares. Harry knew there was a lot of unsaid answers behind the last question, but he was scared to see what Draco meant by "many scars". And Draco knew he had to answer all Harry's questions at some point but in that moment red and blue made a beautiful shade of purple and they didn't dare to mess it up.
"Maybe, but a very pretty one at least" they both laughed at it and Draco turned around and kissed Harry on the lips.
Please comment or I'll be sad, kudos are always appreciated and see you next time!
"That's so fun! It's way more interesting than a feast" Draco said laughing and started to eat his sandwich.
"So... what now?" The blond asked and Harry smiled, he knew just what they were going to do.
They entered to the store and Harry took a basket to put their shopping items, Draco's hand secured in his, they started to look around, the blond made a lot of questions and was so confused at the TV's, well rather how they worked without magic, and Harry made a mental note to take Draco to the movies. They bought the costumes and a Pikachu plushie for Teddy and started to walk to a small coffee shop, it was already lunchtime and Harry figured they still had some time before they needed to go to Andromeda's house and take Teddy trick-or-treating.
“So, I have to do an essay about eye-pots? Yeah, I think that was it, but I don’t get how they manage to reproduce music, or how it works because they use something called ‘elec-tree-city’ and I’m so confused” said Draco with a pout showing Hermione what he had written so far.
It has been a week and Harry kept thinking about those words, it was almost Christmas beak and Draco was all over his mind for all the right reasons this time. But for some reason Harry still doubted what was clear as water, so to soothe his anxiety he decided to write a list, I mean, lists worked just fine when it came to instructions or rules, so maybe a list of cons and pros would be the final thing for him to make a move regarding his feelings for Draco.
So they spent several minutes that way, not quite holding hands but touching each other. He saw Draco calm down a little, his trembling not so bad anymore but still present, and his face wasn’t full of fear but just expecting for something to happen. So Harry took his hand and pull him a little, the fact that Draco let him was enough encouragement for embracing the boy.
“More than you know” Draco mumbled catching Harry by surprise “do you want to read it? The letter, I know Pansy told you” so he just nodded and accepted the letter the boy hands him.
"Are you feeling better?" Draco cut Harry's train of thought with a small voice and the green-eyed boy just nodded.
"Why aren't you eating? Did you not liked what I ordered?" he heard Draco asked, and when he connected his eyes with Draco's grey ones he smiled reassuringly and offered his hand to the boy, who took it immediately.
“The more you think about it the worst it gets, you know?” said a voice behind him and Draco couldn’t help but jump in his place. “Easy there tiger, if I wanted to hurt you I would’ve done it by now,” the ginger girl said
“I mean, there’s nothing a good wanker can’t fix love” and so they continued to talk in the most normal way, Draco blushing every time even harder than before. But of course, the chill atmosphere had to be ruined by Theodore Nott.
? What am I gonna do?”
"I am ready"
"It's a television, TV for short, you look movies or series, or the new there."
"Thank you for inviting me tonight," said Draco as they walked back to Hogwarts, "I had a lot of fun, and it was nice to know a part of my family who wasn't involved in the dark side"
So in his mind, Harry told them about how he and Draco had been hanging out more, and how he was worried about the blond, he started to recall all the little details about the other boy, how his eyes disappeared when he smiled, or how he bite his bottom lip when he was concentrated. He also told them that for the first time in forever he wasn't failing Potions and that he actually started to enjoy the class. Harry started to tear up when he began telling them that he was happy, genuinely happy, that he felt his life was worth living and that he was scared because he wasn't used to be okay but that he was trying his best to make the best out of every day. And finally, he told them about his concerns about the future, because even if being an Auror seemed the obvious next step he was honestly tired of that stressful life, but then again he loves the adrenaline and the satisfaction of doing what was right. He promised them to start visiting them more frequently and with that, he just stared at the grave, he knew he was crying but he didn't know what to do.
“Don’t you ever dare to say that again, do you hear me?” Harry cut Draco off in the middle of his sentence, he was getting so mad at everyone whoever let the boy think that that whit Theo was doing was okay.
It wasn't the first time Draco did something out of the ordinary but it was the first time that Draco treated Teddy with such love and tranquillity, it was like the anxiety around his distant family never existed and that they had been coexisting for years and not months.
“Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions. A menace, actually so. I'm probably just gonna-“ but Harry quickly took the hem of his robe to prevent the boy to run away and leave him alone at the same time that the professor spoke again.
"Fine, you can come in," replied Draco as he sat Indian style on the bed, "but only because you brought peace offerings," that made Harry laughed but he still sat next to Draco offering him the small box.
They finally left and Draco was ready to leave as well when he felt his limbs stop responding, Narcissa was saying something to his husband but Draco's mind was in too much panic to understand what was going on. How did he manage to put himself in this situation? He just wanted a normal family, a normal life, a normal everything. He wanted a bad so he could scrub off the looks of Theo, and a draught potiong to help him fall asleep without thinking about his father.
Without putting much thought into it he let his eyes wandered at the hall, seeing new and old faces, a mix of happiness and nostalgia filled him and when his eyes landed on Malfoy he almost laughed thinking about all the times he had searched the boy in that table in a whole lot different circumstances, what he didn’t expect was that a pair of grey eyes were already looking at his and not daring to look away he let himself look at the boy for a third time today. His cheekbones were too pronounced and his face was adorned by ugly purple bruises around his eyes, his hair was slightly curly and no one needed to know that he preferred it that way than with tons of gel and straight. When the blonde looked away Harry also noticed the lack of food on Malfoy’s plate and the way Pansy was scolding him while serving him a piece of turkey at which Malfoy scolded but started to eat nevertheless.
The incident, as he decided to call it, with Malfoy remained unmentioned and other than a few exchange of meaningless words he hadn’t really see him that much, not even in their dorm. For the first time he felt at peace and like a normal teenager, and it felt good but he also missed the adrenaline of being needed for something. So when Sunday night came and Pansy appeared crying her eyes out he did what he knew best, offer his help.
Harry could still hear the screams, it reminded him of that night at the manor where Bellatrix tortured Hermione. He could still feel the taste of vomit in his mouth as Neville asked Draco if he dreamed about the cruciatus curse and Draco just nodded. He could still see the broken face of the boy, sobbing while apologizing to everyone for waking them up, saying he felt really stupid for not remembering the silencing charms and how he screamed his heart out when Harry tries to hold him saying he wasn’t worth it.
"Oh, so bossy, at least Draco likes that, that bitch never knows what to do unless you tell him, so annoying, but his mouth it's so worth it, right?" and that was when Harry lost it and hexed Theo, if Madame Pomfrey didn't arrive at that second the next spell would've been Sectusembra, knowing well how no one knew the counter spell but him and Snape.
Con – He can be kind of arrogant about it
"Well, I gotta go, love, I promised Pansy I was going to help her choose an anniversary gift for Blaise, can you believe it? They actually lasted more than a week," his boyfriend said and Harry kissed him slowly on the lips. "If you keep doing that I won't want to go"
And with that Harry learns a new thing, Draco Malfoy has the best timing when saying he loves Harry and the most creative ways of doing so as well.
"Well, I have no classes left and you don't either, and I'm kinda hungry so let's go to the kitchens, I'm feeling adventurous today"
“Oh, I already knew, I mean, the fact that I found you two sleeping together in your bed was enough for me to confirm there was something going on,” Ron said and Hermione raised her eyebrow
"You should totally get a tattoo though, and if you wanted to look edgier for Hermione you could do it the muggle way"
"I don't know how muggles can do that all the time, how does it work without magic?" Draco asked while they walked inside the mall, and before Harry could answer the blond boy got distracted by everything, wanting to learn more about anything he could put his hands onto, when they finally reached the cinema Harry bought the tickets and they entered the room. Draco was so excited, practically bouncing to their seats, Harry had to give him the bucket of popcorn so the other boy stops fidgeting so much. Once the movie started the grey-eyed boy gasped loudly.
"Thank you," Draco answered after a while, he had cried at some point but now they were just in comfortable silence. "Your turn"
NEWTs and Harry telling them about his awful handiness when it came to fixing things. Soon it was time to change to their clothes and then they were waiting for a carriage to take them.
“I thought you were over stalking me” answered Malfoy without removing his eyes from the ground, he was shaking and considering the light sweater he was wearing Harry wasn’t surprised.
“Only with people who are worthy enough of being saved, Malfoy”
"Yeah, I'm just worried about an Ancient Runes homework, I've been trying to figure out something and didn't sleep well" dismissed Draco and Blaise nodded not really believing Draco until Hermione talked
to portrait, and I was as big of a git as you were, so," Harry paused but continued to pet Draco's hair, "I guess I did it because I wanted the opportunity to ask you all of the questions that remained unanswered since day one, and I wouldn't have that opportunity if you ended up in Azkaban, where you didn't belong no matter how low of yourself you think."
“Eat,” Pansy said when he noticed it and continued her talk with Hermione about her time in muggle Paris and if she knew how to properly use the eyelash curler because when she tried she had to regrew her eyelashes.
They arrived home absolutely exhausted, they had walked so much and they ended up buying more things than planned, which was okay because according to Draco "he deserved it".
Harry continued the chat they were having in an attempt to make things less awkward, and they managed to get back to normal until Malfoy coughed lightly in an attempt to catch their attention.
"You're such a disgrace, I'm sure Molly would be disappointed knowing that you rather break the ministry rules than fold your clothes like a normal person," said Harry in a jokingly way while finally managing to fit everything.
The sorting took longer than the trio expected considering that no more 4 months ago there was a war, but Harry was happy to see that Hogwarts was still a home for a lot of people, the feast was full of chatter in all the tables, cutlery noises and a couple of scares from the first year’s due headless Nick appearances through the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco, are you sure you're okay? We've been trying to catch your attention for a while now" said Blaise, and that's when he noticed he was sitting in the Gryffindor table next to Harry and Blaise, he doesn't remember getting here, but by the look of his half-eaten apple, it looks like they've been here for a while.
"Honestly? I don't know, I mean, I could lie and tell you that the only reason why I did it was that I thought you were too much of a coward to be a death eater, or that you were just a kid like me who was used as a pawn in a stupid war, but in the end, I don't know. I asked a lot of people to give me a reason to do it because I just wanted to do it but I felt like people would ask why and I couldn't find an answer. And that's when I learned that I only got to see the part of you that
“Brilliant”
They talked about random things while eating and Harry loved how free Draco seemed when he was away from the wizarding world, he resembled of a child eager to eat the world, Harry wished he could make Draco feel this way for the rest of their lives, but he knew if he tried so it was going to be difficult as heck, but deep down he knew he was going to try it as hard as he could.
So far no one had noticed anything, then again once you start to do alright people start to notice fewer things about you. Like how these past two weeks he had been using glamour to cover up how badly he had been sleeping, or how he only ate at breakfast and dinner, and never too much, just enough. Because that was Draco's current goal, he wanted to be just enough for people to stay, just enough for Harry to keep loving him and just enough so he could graduate.
“Yeah, I mean, it’s gonna be awkward and all, but I believe this year should be a fresh start for everyone, including you Malfoy, you called me mudblood, I broke your nose, and so on so… it might be nice to have someone to study with for once,” said Hermione offering him a small smile
Do you ever feel so alone that the smallest gestures of kindness make you feel so worthy yet so afraid? How someone who has suffered so much can be so kind? It doesn't make sense, nothing makes sense anymore. The fact that the great Harry Potter is so keen on helping Draco makes no sense, why would he do that? No matter how many times the black-haired boy assures Draco that he's not playing some kind of sick joke it is still the only explanation the blond finds, because among his people kindness is not something to take for granted, he had made that mistake before.
“Because it’s Teddy’s party, and I’m afraid you’re going to stand out in an odd way if you show up with a tailored suit to a kid’s party at McDonald’s,” Harry explained, for the now 4
"I love it, but it's hard to eat food when all I want to eat is you," he teased and the blond's face got so red that he resembled a tomato.
Sadly the shower didn't take Draco's problems away, and his headache evolved to nausea and feeling quite weak, not that he was the strongest person in the world, but now it was just pathetic how weak he felt. Thankfully he just had 3 classes today and none of them required a lot of movement, he just needed to make it to the Great Hall and eat something so he doesn't pass out in the middle of a lesson or something.
"You pure-bloods sure like to set fire to things," It was Ron, who may have already get used to the whole situation but never wasted an opportunity to make a sassy remark.
"Together"
“Well, I wanted my confession to be perfect, Malfoy”
"Oh really? What is it?" Harry tried to play it cool making Draco laugh, he never succeed to play it cool but just listening to that laugh was enough for him to call it a victory
“I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt Draco, but I never thought I would live to see you in this state,” Pansy tried to joke, but the concern was evident in her voice, “like, seriously, when was the last time you brushed your hair?”
His mother just stared at him, something was so wrong with he and it was driving him mad that he couldn't pin point what it was. I wasn't too difficult to figure out who the guests would be, and he was sure that if he left now he would just make things worse for him and therefore for Harry. So, a smooth diner and he was out.
“It’s not about what I deserve Harry, just what it is and this is happening whether I like it or not so the least I can do is to not make it difficult, no one likes a difficult person to deal with.”
The next days were pretty much the same, it wasn't until Friday's night where something happened. It was past midnight when Harry heard a knock on his bedroom door, putting on his glasses and securing his wand on his hand he asked who was it, the door opened slightly where Draco's face appeared.
Christmas Eve was the best day ever, they woke up super early because they were determined to make the greatest Christmas diner no one has ever had and that required all the time they could get. The menu consisted of pudding, roast potatoes, mince pies, treacle tart and tea. The dished turned out better than expected and they ate so much they felt they were going to die from a stomach ache.
The third time Harry realized that maybe he wasn’t like the others was when he magically rode a fucking broom, later he learned that it wasn’t his first time and that Sirius actually bought him a toy broom when he was one, so Hermione wasn’t lying about talent being practically on his blood. And then, a year later he was reminded, again, that he was different because apparently he can
"Yeah, I did, but I only realized on our fourth year, it became harder to have your attention and most of my friends felt like connections instead of whatever you and your friends had. Today I have Pansy and Blaise, but back then I had no one and that started to bother me a lot which is why I took a lot of dumb decisions."
The first thing Harry noticed when he woke up is how pretty the room looked with the daylight entering from the window, he also noticed that Neville was gone and the Hufflepuff guy was still sleeping. Rubbing his eyes he cast a tempus noticing it was early, breakfast was just starting and he wondered why Hermione hasn’t come to wake Ron and him up yet, but when he noticed Ron’s bed was open he figured the couple wanted to have some time alone. Sighing he begins to change to his robes and that’s when he realized Draco must still be asleep.
The first time Draco Malfoy was scared of his father he was 5 years old and broke a glass at dinner, back then he didn't understand the feeling he felt, but now he can't remember a lot of his childhood without feeling nauseous. Mother tried to reassure him, telling him it was okay, that it was an accident. On the other hand, father just looked at him with disappointment and made him clean the mess he made, he still has small scars on his hands to remind him of that day.
“For a moment I thought I wasn’t going to, but I had already gathered the courage to answer the big question”
"I know love, I know," he answered and rubbed their noses together, "I love you Draco Malfoy, I really do"
“…and maybe you could help Harry with potions, honestly there’s so much I can do after trying all my methods in 6 years!” he heard Hemione finished and when he raised his eyebrow demanding an explanation all he earned was a ‘later’ look from her.
"No, just today, is a tradition to do so before 'all saint's day'" Harry said as their order arrived.
Where they are disgustingly domestic as a couple
“Of course love, all the time you need,” the black-haired boy says while kissing Draco’s forehead.
Chapter song: I found by Amber Rum
"I'm not lying, and you know that love, may I sit next to you?" Harry hated when this happened, he hated having to tip-toe around his boyfriend in order to not make things worse.
Until then he enjoyed the story of Draco’s best Christmas while both sitting on the floor, Draco between Harry extended legs and unexperienced fingers braiding platinum hair.
“Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible, but it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession. And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room,” explained the old man, this was going to be a long-ass class.
Or where family is more than a word
“Well, I think Luna’s right, you should just tell him, it’s not like you two never talk about your feelings”
"I know it's going to be alright, but I can't help to feel anxious," Harry laughed lightly and kissed Draco's forehead.
Song Chapter: Broken boys - Charlotte Dirckze
“I do, and it’s okay if you don’t love me yet, I’ll wait for you forever if you asked me to because you’re everything I ever dreamed of and if you give me the opportunity I’ll try my best to be that for you”
And that’s how he ended in the library on a Friday afternoon rather than in the Quidditch pitch with Ron and Ginny, those traitors leaving him with the two nerds in front of him, he could honestly die from this betrayal. But Hermione had already kicked him in the ribs with her elbow two complaints ago, and his best friend was right, she really had boney elbows.
"Are you going to finish the job?" the blond asked once Harry was next to him. "I need you to finish the job Harry, please do it," he was hysterical, his hands were trembling so much as he grabbed Harry's sweater
"Did you know that I used to wonder what it was like to be you? Spoiled and loved by your parents? I was jealous our whole first year, seeing how your mother always sent you sweets and letters, and how you seemed to have a happy childhood and all that, but then I met the Weasley's as a family and I realized that you couldn't be more happy than me, because even when you had all that you still felt alone, right?"
floor for Charms. The fact that Draco’s plate was untouched was a detail only Harry noticed and it bothered him a lot, but they were not friends yet and he didn’t want to ruin his chances over an unfinished breakfast.
Putting the thought away he went to his dorm and grabbed the marauders map “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good” he said pointing his wand to the map and as soon as the names started to appear he began looking for Malfoy’s name. When he found him at the Astronomy tower he felt like vomiting, memories of that day began to invade his mind and he felt an anxiety attack on its way. So he began to control his breathing as his mind healer taught him and when he was calm enough he began his way to the blonde’s location.
It has been a month since he last saw Draco Malfoy, and he was pretty sure that if Narcissa didn't send him a letter begging for his help he wouldn't have seen him again at all. But he couldn't deny that he was glad she did, because, in the end, her words reminded him of what Molly had said to Sirius once.
"What happened?" Harry asked once they were alone again.
"Harry!" Hermione arrived, and McGonnagall was right behind her.
Because Quidditch has been a constant in Draco’s life since he can remember, and he was good at it, only Potter managing to beat him, which was a constant reason of punishments from his father the prior years. But it wasn’t his fault, he really tried to beat him, he even stopped eating so many sweets in hope that if he lost weight he would be faster, but that only ended in hospital visits due to faint spells, not that he ever told anyone about what he was doing.
“Look, things change, and it’s on us to make a change. I won’t let you do this to yourself because you don’t deserve it, and even if you think you do I won’t let you because I care about you and I’m going to care for you the way others didn’t” Harry said quietly and Draco starts to sob again, not frantically for loud enough for Harry to hear.
“It amazes me how you noticed me doing that when you were always snogging with Dean,” he said and she blushed but then proceeded to kiss Luna on her cheek as in saying ‘well at least I got my mind together’, and again she was right.
The fact that Harry's heart was beating too fast was something no one needed to know.
"Oh dear, I'm still sorry though, I wouldn't have forgiven myself if I had killed you that day, I still can't forgive myself knowing that some of the scars you have are because of me."
Or where Harry finally opens up about things he never told anyone.
"A cleaning spell would be magnific," Draco said a minute later, they were both laying on the bed, their breaths still uneven, Harry just laughed and cast it.
"Well, it wasn't on my list of thing to do today, but since you suggested it," Harry joked and Draco punched him lightly on the arm and they both laughed. "We're going for a ride, like in Aladdin but cooler"
"Yeah, but it's awesome," he replied as he saw how Ginny managed to win ye another game of flying hockey against Ron, who was screaming that she cheated somehow. And how Hermione was proving that muggle sports aren't that bad, while winning in a game agains't Fred.
"I'm okay, just a little bit light-headed"
Or where Harry is tired of the people he loves getting hurt.
“But it is true, I lost my ‘oh so-called virginity’ when I was 14, a Durmstrang friend, and then I was with him and another boy, then I was with a Ravenclaw boy and it was amazing, I loved feeling that way, I know none of them cared about me in a loving way but they were nice enough to at least pretend. And then everything went to shit with the war, things happened that gave me a bad reputation among ‘my people’ and I have to make things right no matter the price I pay, it’s how it works” Draco was calm enough now, he was basically cuddling Harry by now and he was okay with it.
“I don’t care what you want Draco if I’m telling you we are going to sit there is because we’re fucking sitting there,” Pansy said and practically made Draco sit next to Harry, the boy offered an apologetic look to the rest of the table and that’s when Harry decided to look to the scary girl.
"Oh but, I'm not asking Draco," and he left.
Song Chapter: Friday I'm in love - The cure
"I wasn't with her, I was with a new friend." he replied and changed the topic to avoid more questions.
"Oh, so I'm back to being Potter then, Malfoy?" Harry joked to calm Draco down, and it kind of work as the boy smiled lightly, but the nervousness was still present in the blond's face. "Do you trust me?"
thoughts? suggestions? ideas?
"I'm not going nowhere near that machine, why would the muggles want hot toast to jump right to your face?" Harry just laughed and continued to cook.
After a couple of minutes Draco started to feel like a creep and got up from his bed, there were a lot of questions running in his mind and he needed answers from a lot of people before accepting the fact that someone, especially Harry, could love him in that kind of way.
"I still can't believe you didn't pack yesterday," said Ron while watching Harry suffering to fit all of his clothes in a bag. "And I still can't believe you haven't asked Hermione to make an extension charm to your things, I swear its life-changing"
“Easier said than done, and anyways, Theo is not that bad” Draco answered, his voice shaking, it was like that day at the Astronomy tower hadn’t happened, as if his mental breakdown had been a dream, he truly didn’t understand Draco Malfoy and it was killing him. “And, I mean… my father wasn’t always like that, Azkaban changes people, and I even after that he was okay, didn’t hurt me as much as I deserved to be hurt, you know? I grew up looking forward to being like him, and even though I won’t be able to do so, the least I can do is to live to their standards, my mom deserves to be happy and my father deserves to feel proud-”
want, you know?”
"Oh, do you want to talk about it?" Harry pushed a little bit more, if he was lucky Draco would actually talk about what was bothering him instead of eating his feelings away like he had been doing lately.
"Draco, it's okay, I promise,"
“Thank you, Harry,” said Draco hugging him quickly and entering the common room quickly, when Harry entered he was long gone but the missing robe of his was enough for him to agree that that just happened and that maybe he had wanted to hug the boy back.
"Anything"
But yet again, life reminded Draco that he wasn’t worthy of what he wanted, that he must be the carrier of all the karma his family (and himself) have had to come all these years. He stopped being so loud unless important people were watching, like Umbridge in his fifth year. He started to be a hell lot more cautious about his actions, about his words, about his appearance, about his smiles, about his tears, so when his father was thrown to Azkaban he finally felt as if he could breathe, and he loathed himself for it because Lucius was his father and all he ever did was to make him a better person… right? Right?!?
Draco didn't know what to answer, lately, he rarely did. Gladly the professor entered and the class started, but the words that Pansy said were left hanging on his mind. Would it be so wrong if she knew the truth? How bad would it be for anybody to see the truth? He had the opportunity to come out and tell the truth to McGonagall last week when they spoke about the whole bathroom situation, but he got too scared. What if she saw through him and decided that he might enjoy it a little bit too much, or that he wasn't clear enough when he said 'no'. What if she said that they were engaged after all... and that a good fiancé doesn't get to say no to their partners because that's not what a good pureblood does?
"Harry! We should have left some of that treacle pudding, Ginny gave me some ideas that included one of us eating it out from some interesting places," and when Harry stopped shocked at Dracos words and blushing even harder than he did earlier that day, the blond went fro the snitch catching it and finishing the game.
“Oh, yeah, Seamus bought one and I helped him enchant it so he doesn’t need to plug it to electricity” and so she began explaining the whole concept of electricity, the internet and how you download music for you to listen. Draco listed really carefully, writing notes as she spoke trying to not miss any peace of information, and after 1 hour he was done with his work and gave it to Hermione to proofread the new words.
"Harry?" Draco says as he plays with Harry's fingers.
or where Harry finally understands potions and a heart-to-heart conversation ensues.
“Are you sure you want me here?” Draco asked as he played with his hands not looking at Harry’s eyes.
“The second year, who do you think sent Dobby? Obviously, my plans failed and you ended up here and almost got killed but yeah, after that I stopped trying because our relationship got pretty bad and I saw no point in it, until the summer after 4
"Draco, do you care about mine?" the blond shaked his head, "then why would I care about yours? I know they make you feel insecure but I love you as a whole and you know it, you're beautiful with or without them, I promise"
Andromeda opened the door and Draco gasp getting closer to Harry, slightly hiding behind him from the woman, a small whisper from the boy let him know that she looked exactly like Bellatrix, but after a couple of seconds he started to calm down and entered the house. As soon as the door was closed Teddy came running down the stairs and threw himself into Harry's arms, so let go Dracos hand for a second and took the boy balancing him on his hip and taking the blond's hand again.
"Did you get in a lot of trouble?" Asked Harry and immediately apologized "sorry, I didn't mean to ask another question, please just forget about it I-"
He had managed to adjust a pair of jeans for Draco to use, otherwise they were going to draw a lot of attention with all the fancy clothing. The fact that Draco scolded Harry for not owning any good clothes was better left unsaid, he didn't want to ruin the mood by saying that the Dursley's didn't believe in buying 'nice clothes' to Harry when he could just use the old ones from Dudley. He waited for him and Draco's nausea to go away and begin to walk to the main street. And the face the blond made was the best thing he has ever seen, he looked like a little child in a candy store. His grey eyes were so bright and even if he was a little intimidated by the unknown he was eager to learn.
“It’s okay to be scared, I am as well, I’m terrified of you finding out that being with me is not worth the gossip and the constant hate remarks from the Prophet and others, I’m scared you’ll find me stupid or not handsome enough but for you Draco I would do the impossible”
"And what's this?" The blond boy asked pointing to the lamp on the table beside the couch.
"So, what's the plan for tomorrow? Does Teddy have a McDonald's in mind?" asked Harry as he poured sugar and milk into Draco's tea, knowing exactly how much he liked.
The rest of the day passed as blur and he ended up in the same spot at diner, he was hungry and for the first time in weeks he started to serve different kinds of food in his plate, but he only managed to eat half of eat before excusing himself and started to walk back to the 8th year common room, he wasn't going to throw up, because he hated it, but when he saw Theo smirking at him he sighed, maybe if he threw up on him he would leave him alone. He laughed at that thought knowing that if he did that he was going to get cursed so bad, but maybe getting cursed was better than being fucked like that, he couldn't call it rape... right? Because he deserved it, and it was the right thing to do, they were engaged after all.
They both started to run to where it was the fight happening, and he was pretty sure Theo was almost unconscious by the time they got there, so Pansy ran again to look for Madame Pomfrey.
"What?"
"Hell no, I don't want a million needles on my skin Harry, muggles are out of their minds for doing so"
Once there, he heard soft sobs and sighed, at least he found him, he sent a patronus so that Blaise could be calm and entered the room. The sight wasn't pretty, there was blood in both of Draco's arms and his face was full of tears, Myrtle was next to him trying to calm him down, but failing horribly at it.
"Stop it, you're gonna get in trouble, or worse, in Azkaban because it looks like you're trying to kill him"
"I just, I tried to do toast the way you did yesterday but I forgot the toes-terr did that thingy where it practically throws your toast," Draco explained feeling pretty embarrassed and Harry laugh.
"Oh believe me Potter, if I wanted him dead he would already be dead," said Blaise kicking Theo in the stomach again while the other boy laughed
Harry smashed his lips against the blonds’ ones, it was kind of messy but felt perfect anyways, they both got so into it that for a minute breathing was unimportant, until it was and they had to break it off.
"Why didn't you call me sooner?"
And being different got him a place where he felt he belong, a family of all red-heads that were kind and funny and loud, and that never, not for a moment, let Harry felt out of place, he got fed and hugged and every year he received a sweater or a scarf that was made just for him, that made the final statement that that was now his family. And then there were his 2 best friends, Ron and Hermione, both making him feel that as long as they were together he would be alright.
“The great Harry Potter shagging boys and girls, that was something I wasn’t expecting, with the whole ‘saving the world’ crap I’m surprised you got time to do that” she smirked and it was Harry’s turn to laugh.
“I mean what I said, don’t think too much about it, the brain has a wonderful capacity of making a lot of reasons why you shouldn’t do something, it gets ridiculous at some point but we don’t really see it,” Ginny sat beside him on the cold stairs, “think about it like a boggart, you are terrified of it and you’ll continue to be terrified of it unless you do something, so you cast a spell and suddenly it doesn’t seem as bad as before”
There had been a lot of doubts along the way, but in the end, they make it work, it's no secret that very few people had hope that their relationship was going to last but either they love proving people wrong or they were really meant to be with each other. Draco likes to think it's the latest because at least that way he could feel like all his regrets ended up being part of something bigger than what he was able to understand at 16 years old.
“You sure rant a lot when you’re nervous, Potter”
"Yes it is, but first I need your emotional support, I think I'm ready to talk about what happened with Theo," Draco said with all the confidence he managed and Harry tried to cover his surprise with a smile and offered him his hand, which Draco gladly took.
"I've missed you too mother, did you like your Christmas present? I was going to wait and give it to you myself but I know how special traditions are for you"
"Love you babe, see you Harry," exclaimed the girl, again, and they finally started to walk so they could apparate home.
Or where Harry kisses Draco like he is his entire world
In one hand he knew he was deserving of love… or at least he once was, but then he took a lot of decisions that led him to be the mess he was today, and apparently, a lot of people were accepting of his mess but Draco couldn’t help to feel like a burden most of the time.
“Yeah, I know… but maybe I like the idea you have of me in your mind, and I want you to hold onto that for a little longer” the grey-eyed boy answered realizing Harry’s hand and offering him a small smile before grabbing his pyjamas and heading to the bathroom to change.
Between messy kisses and soft moans they mapped each other's torsos, Harry learned how loud Draco was whenever he brushed his nipples and proceeded to bite them lightly while Draco gripped Harry's hair harder. Suddenly that didn't felt enough and Harry's hands found their way to Draco's pants and started to undo the belt and buttons, once he managed to do so, he grabbed Draco's hips lifting them up until there was enough space to pull them down, leaving only a tight pair of boxers which were even tighter around Draco's erection.
“What hurt, Draco?” and even if Harry had some ideas of what could’ve happened he had learnt to not assume things when he could just ask, but Draco just started to shake his head, the signs of a panic attack where clear so Harry just did whatever came to his mind first, and he cast a patronus lighting up the room. He saw the wide eyes of the blond as he tried to reach it but not really managing to, then he looked at Harry and smiled lightly, he was shaking so much that Harry was scared he was gonna fall, so he reached to Malfoy and when he checked it was okay to touch him he took his hand pulling him slightly so that he was now facing him instead of the abysm. Draco let go his legs and lets them hang from the sill, leaving just enough room for Harry to be between them while he hugged the heck out of the blond.
