In fact, Albus is beginning to suspect he may have even underestimated the depths of Malfoy’s regard; and, from the intense look of wide-eyed relief that floods Harry’s expression as he jerks around to see Malfoy awake, he suspects it’s an underestimation he’s made twice.
Ginny frowns, confused at the different signals he’s sending. On the one hand he’s just been in a fight with Malfoy, on the other, he’s looking at her the same way he had when she found he’d kissed Malfoy.
He looks back at Gryffindor table just in time to see the tall, obnoxious seventh year give Harry a wide smile before turning and heading back down to his seat. Harry’s shoulders slump with relief and Draco wonders how the hell they don’t see how uncomfortable he is?
‘Hey, Lovegood picked it out,’ says Malfoy, raising his hands and smirking again. ‘Besides, it’s a good book.’
His eyes fixate on the spot where Bellatrix had stood a moment longer before, finally, he closes his eyes. She sees his fingers shift around his wand as his mouth moves inaudibly, mouthing the numbers as he counts out his breathes.
of sixth year. It’s years of aggressive rivalry underlying this strange and barbed truce they’ve developed. Yet all of that history doesn’t stop Harry’s stomach from tying itself in knots every time Draco so much as glances Harry’s way, that infuriatingly superior smirk lifting the corners of his mouth, making Harry wonder exactly how they taste.
‘No,’ Minerva agrees. ‘But he has to agree to a strategy in the first place. This apathy he’s fallen into does not bode well.’
‘I must say,’ says Lavender, eyeing Hermione with interest. 'I had heard about the bet among the Slytherins, but I'm surprised
He drops his gaze to the book, pushing his glasses up as his gaze scans the page. ‘Oh, I love this bit,’ he says around a mouthful. ‘You know, I had a secret crush on Sophie when I was a kid?’
Harry glances sideways. He grins, and, unable to help himself, nudges Draco’s elbow. ‘What? Wander around in the dark to go ice-skating?’
Malfoy rolls his eyes. ‘Of course you’d think that,’ he scowls. ‘No, Potter, I didn’t go through all the effort of saving your sorry arse only to torment you at school. Merlin.’
Despite the speculation about who Harry might be seeing—and there has been plenty of speculation—the entire school is so accustomed to seeing them together due to the Seating Arrangement, that even now that Harry has been outed, no one blinks twice at seeing them together. Not in class, not in the library, not in the grounds or even roaming the castle late at night. Not now, when they have every reason to part ways and get away from each other.
is giving you second chances, Malfoy. I just…I can’t keep doing this. I can’t figure you out. You keep saying one thing and then doing another and it’s driving me mental. So what is it, what the hell do you want from me?’
She steps toward the cabinet, her footsteps light and silent, and presses one finger to the edge of the cabinet.
Hermione makes a point of glancing in at the usual Slytherin compartment as they pass. Her eyes scan the room quickly through the open door before switching to the compartment across the hall when she doesn’t see him. They’ve stretched out across two compartments this year, leaving the doors open so conversation can pass between them.
Except that having a conscience doesn’t explain why Malfoy willingly got obsessed over muggle books and knows what a toaster does and is okay with Harry’s choice of class project (if a little reluctant and weary).
The way he says it sounds ridiculous, even to Blaise’s ears, but he smirks and says, ‘I dunno, maybe?’
Pansy, of course, stomps over to them red faced and fuming. ‘Speak for yourself,’ she snaps. ‘Weasley has already got me landed in detention. The detestable pig.’
‘Actually,’ says Dean. ‘It’s usually worse than that. My Uncle got beaten so badly he had to go to hospital.’
Ron glances over at Harry, pointing his fork at him. ‘Yeah, you don’t really want to give him any more reasons to start shit?’
‘Whatever you’re doing, drop it now and come with me,’ says Draco, coming to an abrupt stop at Harry’s elbow.
‘I’m not disputing that,’ says Kingsley. ‘I’m simply pointing out that a pureblood as indoctrinated as he is would not simply
exactly. There are degrees to Draco’s moods. This is…well it’s more concern than anything else. And annoyance that I’ve noticed. He doesn’t like looking vulnerable.’
Tonks wrinkles her nose. ‘Ah, I wouldn’t worry about him. He’s been dropped from the rotation after that incident with the goblets.’
Luna reaches out to grasp Draco’s arm, stilling the shakes that are rocking through him. He looks up at her, his eyes wide and dilated, black pools of despair that want to drag her down into their depths.
Whispers break out across the hall. Blaise straightens, his mouth dropping open, and shifts his attention back to McGonagall.
Harry glances up at her, his eyes wide, a flash of fear crossing his face that is more apparent without his glasses to shield his face. The air thickens, and Hermione shivers, the hairs on her arms standing on end as static fills the air.
Dora grins, her hair shifting to a pastel blue, her eyes changing to match and Remus’s heart kicks up a notch. He looks away, swallowing and trying to regain his composure.
Distress comes off him in waves, and the urge to go and reassure him makes Albus’ limbs twitch, but there’s a student of his bleeding out on his Hospital bed and so he pushes aside his concerns about Harry and moves to help Poppy.
Severus blinks, his expression remaining blank just a fraction of a second as he processes Albus’ words. For a moment, Albus thinks he might argue, but he knows Albus too well not to at least suspect that Albus might have guessed the source of the spell that Mr Nott used. Understands that the present circumstance is, in a small way, his own fault. He glances sideways at Nott, who hasn’t yet grasped the meaning behind Albus’ plan.
Ginny is calmer. ‘Dean,’ she says, her voice cautious. ‘What’re you talking about? What did you hear?’
Luna leaves him to his draw, slipping down one of the other rows. Her fingers trail along the draws, her head tilted to one side. Magic saturates the room, and Luna’s gaze is drawn to one corner where two small grey sets of cabinets are nestled between the rest. She starts towards it, her footsteps light, her skin tingling in response to ward magic.
Draco leans on his arm, considering the problem. ‘Alright,’ he says. ‘What can we do to make you feel less awkward?’
Still, nervousness grips him, and he’s so lost in his trian of thought (practicing what he’s going to say) that he doesn’t notice the other person coming his way until they’re almost on top of each other.
doing it for him. He takes a deep breath, startled by how different it feels with someone else’s hand in control.
He sounds disappointed, and Hermione doesn’t blame him. Though she suspects they are disappointed for different reasons.
Mad-Eye levels her with a glare and Tonks sits back, raising her hands in mock surrender. ‘Alright, alright. No, no incidents to report Sir.’
Poppy rolls her eyes. Well, if Minerva tells them there's nothing she can do about it and frankly Poppy has other things to worry about. Like how to keep Potter from becoming magically crippled.
Potter. Wasn’t he the exception to every rule? On day four in Potter’s constant presence, Poppy is starting to look a little frayed. Minerva doesn’t blame her. Potter is a handful on the best of days, let alone dealing with the news that he has an incurable disease.
Been on a bit of a roll this week. Normally I'd hold off on posting, but I was excited about this chapter too, so I hope you enjoy it!
‘You and Ginny,’ she says slowly, carefully considering her words. ‘You were good friends, and I hope you’ll remain that way for a long time.’
‘I looked out for you,’ Draco says in a low voice. ‘I gave you a place to stay. I gave you clothes and food and a safe place to hide from your father and you can’t even look the other way?Just
As the door closes, Severus casts a quick but complex privacy charm. Draco frowns at the door in concern, sensing the magic and turning to Severus enquiringly.
Harry, on the other hand, relaxes into the motion with ease, and they work in silence until Molly decides that Harry has unwound enough to talk.
Theo crouches down slowly to reach for his own wand, discarded on the floor, but in a flash Draco’s wand is up and pointed at him again, the look on his face expressing clear enough that Theo is lucky that spell wasn’t aimed at
, start to open. Without looking, Minerva flicks out her wand and snaps out a sharp spell, slamming it in the faces of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
Ron just needs to get away. He needs to process what the fuck he just saw. He needs to figure out how the hell to deal with it before it destroys his friendship with his best friend. Because if there’s one thing he’s feeling more than the anger, it’s fear. Fear that he and Harry will never speak again.
‘No,’ she says. ‘It cannot be Severus or me. Picking one head of house over the other will just make the other boy feel outnumbered; and besides, most of us teachers are too busy to go chaperoning an excursion like this for a full day. Not with NEWTS coming up.’
Lavender smiles, and wraps her arm around her friend’s shoulders, giving her a little squeeze. ‘I know,’ she says. ‘But just think! This day is as much for us, as it is for everyone else. If we don’t like it, how can we expect anyone else to?’
‘Thought you didn’t want to be sexually frustrated,’ Harry says, almost a challenge, though his tone is somewhat undermined by the breathy little moan that escapes him a moment later.
the seeker, aren’t you? And the rest of us don’t need the snitch to get started. Besides, aren’t you and Potter good ol’ pals now?’
While Thistle is organising the presents into several piles, the two house elves return, distributing the hot chocolates and eclairs that Thistle had ordered.
In their first class of the year, Harry barked out a shield charm so strong it knocked Snape off balance. He’d said it verbally, though, and it had cost him detention. This time he sees what’s coming and clenches his jaw, readjusting his grip on his wand, and reaches for his magic. Yet when Snape swoops in, there’s something in the movement that throws Harry’s memory backwards.
‘Alright,’ she says with a smile. ‘Lemon slice it is. My, it’s been quite a while since I’ve made a lemon slice. What do you think, should we add a bit of curd?’
Her breath catches and for the barest moment her mind goes blank. She forgets her irritation. She forgets Ron and Ginny teasing her. She stares into those vivd green eyes, gazes at the soft curve of his lips, is overwhelmed by the smell of fresh earth and coffee and treacle.
‘I’ll do all my homework before we go,’ he says quickly, cutting her off. ‘For all my classes. Even the stuff that’s not due yet. And I’ll pull extra detention. And clean the Infirmary.
‘Give it to me,’ says Potter, stepping forward. ‘I mean, we have some similar classes, I can make sure he gets it.’
The manor has never looked better. She pulls out all the stops, pulls every ornament, every bauble and string of lights from storage. All of Draco’s old handmade decorations are strung throughout the house. Every family photograph proudly displayed amongst wreaths of perfectly blooming flowers.
‘Of course not, my dear boy,’ says Albus, smiling benignly at him. ‘Madam Pomfrey is just being diligent, as is her duty. She’s quite right. Harry should get all the rest he can before he wakes. Better for his recovery that way. You’ll let me know when he wakes of course?’
Rumbling footsteps shake the ground. ‘Everythin’ alrigh’?’ asks the Giant One, rushing over to them.
Theo knows that, somewhere in the room, Blaise and Granger are watching them. Trying to figure out who is right. Who is going to win the ten galleons.
‘I guess I just don’t like feeling so exposed,’ Potter mutters, his voice barely audible above the running water.
His voice is even. Calm. There’s no jibe. No taunting. Just a truthful question that quiets Eric in an instant. His face goes pale. His breath catches. His eyes go wide and dilated. He might not have been afraid before, but he is now.
‘And about—about what you said. I…I’ll try. I mean not that I don’t, because I do, but I mean I’ll try and—what I mean is—ugh, I’m so bad at this. I just—‘
Sure, Potter is a problem. But for now, at least, he’s staying silent to protect Draco. Theo isn’t sure how long it will last. How far the depth of loyalty extends into whatever newfound partnership has formed between Draco and Potter. The one thing he’s sure of, though, is that the second Potter finds out what that necklace is, what he almost endured, he’ll go to Dumbledore.
‘Fascinating though this conversation is,’ says Granger, sounding oddly like the very person they’ve been talking about. ‘We have plans for the afternoon.’
to him about this. She wants to be the one he goes to when he’s embarrassed or confused, and she wonders what she’s done wrong that he didn’t feel comfortable to come to her. That he went to Ginny, and now Luna, with his worries.
The flat tone to Potter’s voice is a stark contrast to that unreadable expression burning in his eyes and Draco falters, unable to think of a suitable reply.
Myrtle blinks, looking between them. At the vivid red blush across both their faces. Embarrassment that she was no longer capable of feeling. Not the way
He can’t help it. For six years he’s watched Potter—hell for two months they’ve spent more time together than Draco has ever spent with anyone else—yet Draco has never seen him like this; and he reacts on instinct, pulling his guard up before realising he’s even done it, unsure of this new version of Potter.
The groundskeepers hut is lit up, with smoke billowing out to be smothered by the downpour, but Harry, of course, isn’t sensible enough to at least take refuge there. No, he’s sitting up against a tree, with some flimsy excuse of a rain shield up, twining Blue between his hands.
He rubbed a hand over his face and immediately winced, glancing down and lifting his shirt to examine the mark on his hip. Smith had obviously had to hex him more than once to wake him up, as there were three red welts starting to bruise along his side. Harry sighed.
Still, as Potter pushes through (shoving in between Draco’s teammates instead of walking around), he glances sideways at Draco and for a moment that burning look intensifies into something heavy and hungry. Draco’s mouth goes dry and his palms start to sweat.
Romilda finally senses that her scheme to talk to Harry has come to a fruitless end and stomps away, muttering about Slytherins and Malfoy’s. Malfoy watches her go, amusement lighting up his face and making him look far less menacing than usual.
‘Morning ladies,’ says Blaise, one eyebrow raised in that enquiring way of his that somehow manages to get him the answers to all his questions.
‘Erm,’ Potter says, his adams apple bobbing, and he runs a hand through his hair (almost dropping a sock into the puddles at his feet). ‘I said, uh, did you, um, did you flirt with-with me. At the Halloween party?’
Professor Burbage turns around and Earnie cuts off. She stalks over to Potter and Malfoy’s shared desk, and drops two books in front of Malfoy (who jerks back rather comically).
Harry—still with his glasses pushed up on his head—looks up at Malfoy, making eye contact for the first time. Without a word, he shuffles over on the bed, pushing himself into more of a sitting position and leaning against the headboard. He doesn’t look at any of the rest of them, instead staring down at the sheets with a mild frown.
Harry shifts slightly, biting Draco’s lower lip. It’s a subtle shift, but it’s enough, putting the smallest amount of space back between them.
‘And for Merlin’s sake,’ she adds, smirking cheekily (least he get the wrong impression). ‘stop taking it out on the rest of us. Greg’s looking about as fragile as a glass flower. Honestly, you were far more pleasant when you were shagging him.’
The Pale One sighs. ‘No,’ he mutters under his breath, barely loud enough for Blue to hear. ‘Everything’s all wrong.’
He’d thought it was good. He was certainly enjoying himself, and it was clear that Harry was just as aroused, so why…?
He produces his wand with a flourish and flicks it at the bag. It shrinks and zips into one of his pockets, hidden from view. Potter mutters something Tonks can’t hear under his breath—something derogatory from the sounds of it—and Malfoy flicks him in the back of the head.
Hagrid chuckles, as if this is perfectly normal behaviour. ‘This ‘ere is Archie, he did his training with Charlie a few years back.’
No, that was a lie. He glanced in at Smith and tried not to grimace. He definitely knew which was worse.
‘I…’ Ron sighs, and runs a hand through his mane. ‘You know that kids story? The one about—about the Fairy Queen? Did you ever hear it?’
Though his colouring has begun to return to normal since the fire, he is still too pale and too thin. His face is drawn and there are dark shadows beneath his eyes (though Poppy gives him dreamless sleep at least once a week).
A huge, white wolf appears, skulking out from the shadows to place itself between Harry and the tigeress. He snarls, and the tiger balks. She reconsiders (a smart move being that she is much smaller than the large wolf), turns and bounds away. The wolf turns to face Harry.
‘Well,’ Minerva says, ‘Since neither of you are willing to offer a reasonable explanation then I cannot help but agree with Professor Snape’s suggestion. Two hundred points from both Slytherin and Gryffindor—‘ both boys jerk, their eyes widening comically at the pronouncement. ‘In all my years at Hogwarts I have
Ron glances sideways at her, dropping into his seat with a heavy sigh. ‘Sorry,’ he mumbles, and slouches back, arms crossed. ‘Are we doing this or what?’
Harry nods and does so, moving first to wash his hands and then reaching for the flour without Molly having to tell him which container it is. She smiles. If she’d have instructed Ron or Percy or even Ginny there’d have been a lot of griping and question-asking just over which container it was, let alone any of the rest of the instructions.
‘My…’ confusion finally wins out over the discomfort and the fear. ‘I’m sorry, I’m confused. Why do you need to buy my silence?’
The whisper of footsteps on stone interrupt her train of thought, and she turns, half expecting to see a lion pouncing up the stairway. She startles, stepping back out of the doorway as she sees a flash of red, but there is no lion on the steps, just Ron, alone and forlorn. It’s almost lion-like, that downturned expression. Not a grand, lion king, no. But sad, like the lion who lost his courage and had to go on a quest to find it.
‘Yeah,’ he says, getting supremely annoyed—especially as he’s just noticed these girls are from his own house. ‘Ginny Weasley?
. His shoulders shake, and when he looks at Ron again there’s an expression Ron’s never seen on his face before. As if all the world has collapsed in on him, and Harry has just...given up.
He balances the book in one hand and begins to rifle through it, his brows furrowed in a frown of concentration as his eyes skim the pages. Ron leans over, peering over the top of the book to frown down at the upside down words. Draco ignores him, flicking through the pages impatiently.
Harry reaches for another sandwich and blinks down at the empty plate in surprise. Molly sends a few more his way. Then she turns her gaze deliberately away from him and sets about measuring out ingredients.
Draco, for his part, is as unaffected as ever. He sits with his elbow on the table, his chin rested in his palm as he idly pushed his food around his plate with his fork. He’s pretending not to notice the glares and whispers, instead staring off toward the great hall doors as if deep in thought—though Blaise suspects there’s less deep thinking going on and more of a wish for escape.
Surprise tingles along Hermione’s skin, shooting up her spine and making her eyes wide as she stares. She thought Malfoy had brought Zabini for company. Yet Zabini drops into a seat across from Ginny, diagonally across from Malfoy (not a very good position to provide backup from) without so much as a glance at his fellow Slytherin. They’ve barely exchanged two words, and sure, Hermione had assumed that this was just typical Slytherin behaviour—but now that she thinks about it, she hasn’t ever seen Zabini and Malfoy be particularly friendly.
Grey eyes flicker back up to Harry’s face and despite the return of the pretty pink blush, Draco’s expression is as stubborn as ever. ‘I might be.’
He takes the ring out of the box, studying it for a moment, before slipping it onto his finger. He stares at it, takes it back off, and slips it into his pocket.
He shakes his head, trying to rid himself of the confusion, and pushes into the boys dorm. The others are all already there. Theo had dawdled on his way down, lost in his thoughts as he was, and the other boys are all in various stages of packing their trunks.
The potion beside him begins to bubble, but Draco doesn’t take his eyes of Severus. With a start, Severus realises that he doesn’t trust him. Not even to deal with an unstable potion.
His eyes are too wide, and his voice—still too high—has that same undercurrent of embarrassment as earlier this morning. Hermione frowns and Harry drops his gaze.
Blaise, of course, doesn’t see these things. Because he hasn’t known Draco as long as Greg has. Hell they’ve barely been friends until this year. He doesn’t know what to look for. But Greg does. He’s seen Draco flirt. He’s seen Draco on a conquest. But this? This is different. This is
Harry crosses his legs, his shoulders hunching as he picks at the hem of his trousers. ‘Um, a little, I guess,’ he mutters, he ducks his head, frustration furrowing his brows. ‘I just feel so awkward.’
Malfoy looks back down, his expression cool and annoyed. ‘I thought Gryffindors were all about second chances?’
‘No,’ says Zabini dryly, following along behind her with an amused glance at his friend. ‘Of course you wouldn’t. So, what exactly do
, and she’s getting ready to flick a Bat Boogey hex his way to remind him to mind his own damn business, when she hears Harry’s low voice mumble something in response.
They’ve only bickered a few times (they’re on their last warning from Madam Pince—who is pretending not to glare at them from behind her desk) but have now been interrupted by a girl in Ginny’s house.
Then Minerva straightens, strength surging back through her eyes. ‘Alright,’ she says. ‘What do you need me to do?’
The air around Luna goes still. It’s as if all the magic in this section of the castle has gone silent, as if it’s listening with as baited breath as she, for what Ron has to say.
Every now and then the stern woman stalks into the room to collect a book or a potion off the shelves at the end of the room, leaving them with no doubt that she is keeping an eye on them.
They’re so close to the ground. Malfoy is falling head first, Harry’s hand brushes Malfoy’s leg but it’s not enough to grab hold. They’re going to hit the ground, they’re going to—
He kicked at the ground and stared at Ron, hoping to wear his friend down. Ron glanced back up as the rollercoaster whooshed by them again.
Again there’s that amused little smile at the corners of Dora’s mouth, as if she’s enjoying his confusion. ‘I can think of one Slytherin he’s spending plenty of time with.’
‘Narcissa,’ he says, enunciating very clearly. ‘You do realise what you’re asking me could get not just both of us killed, but also Draco himself.’
Malfoy frowns, looking away. ‘I know you want to fight. I know you can’t help yourself. But…if you just stay out of his way, he’ll leave you alone. He will.’
Draco throws him a grin (a rarity these days) and nods, ‘of course,’ he says, a smirk slips easily into place. ‘I would expect nothing less.’
Ron smirks, stuffing his mouth with entirely too much bacon. Hermione wrinkles her nose. ‘I bet he hated that,’ he says around his food.
There within lay a jewelled silver necklace. It’s large, and yet finely intricate, each opal set within detailed silver bands, all linked together to form something his mother would love to wear. Not that he’d ever want his mother to wear it.
She brows furrow and her hands find their way absently to the small braid in her hair, where she’s wound a charm that doesn’t quite seem to be doing it’s job. She’ll need to make a new. Something stronger, and more permeating to break through the stubborn haze that seems to be clouding the minds of Hogwarts students. Perhaps something with lavender or rose or—?
Malfoy groans and leans back into the wall, running his hands through his hair and dislodging the pristinely arranged strands. ‘Merlin talking to you is like talking to a wall. You just don’t listen. All we’re doing is going around and around in circles.’
Blaise winces. He turns to face Granger, bracing himself for the long, ranting Gryffindor to give them what for.
He keeps his gaze on the clouds, knowing that Harry is more comfortable talking about this when they’re focused on something else—so he can pretend they’re not talking anything about anything potentially embarrassing. Not that Draco finds it embarrassing, but Harry is different.
Well, if he really cared about patching things up with Harry he’d spend more time trying to figure out how to talk to his friend than he spent with his tongue shoved down Lavender’s throat.
Watching them, Poppy thinks that Malfoy is the worse off of the two of them, despite Potter’s bleeding nose. He’s holding his arm to his chest, his movements stiff and minimal. She remembers the last time he was in with broken bones and decides to start with him, lest he decide a reenactment is required.
Draco’s breathing is somewhat heavier than it was a moment ago, and he rolls his shoulder, his arm bent at the elbow as he stretches his neck.
He doesn’t even register the words as his, barely even registers the state of the room, he’s too busy trying to process what he’s just heard. Trying to reconcile it with the look of absolute horror that’s spreading across his best friends face.
‘How do you accidentally punch someone in the face, Ron?’ She says, shaking her head. ‘Honestly, you never
Draco rolls his eyes, but—after a beat of silence—follows Potter in, pushing off from the wall and throwing them all his scathing patented number two “I’m-better-than-all-of-you” sneer.
Before either of them can reply, he turns and heads back toward the classroom, almost running headlong into Blaise Zabini.
Blaise had thought it was something to do with the fight Draco and Theo had—seeing that Draco has ignored all of them ever since it happened. Yet now, as Draco trudges over to his bed, rubbing his eyes and looking like he could sleep for months, he wonders if there’s something else going on.
‘Guess we won’t see you at the Malfoy’s Christmas dinner after all, eh?’ says Vince nervously in the awkward silence that follows.
Blinking up at the ceiling as Poppy performs her test, Potter says, ‘Look, it’s done now, okay? Can’t you just say thank you like a normal person and be done with it?’
listening—are going to get an answer. Draco may have been a bit of an attention seeker, but he could be stubborn when he put his mind to it.
Unfortunately, I will have to return it as it would be unconscionable for me to accept considering the rest of the contents of this letter.
‘I knew there was a prophecy but no one told me what it was about,’ says Malfoy, his voice strained, ‘I…I thought all that stuff about you being the chosen one was just an extension of the whole Boy Who Lived thing and the fact that you were there at the Department of Mysteries, I didn’t realise…I don’t…Merlin…he really will come after you.’
Three days, three days he’s been home and yet, Narcissa has hardly seen him. He mingles at the parties, polite and yet reserved. He holds himself back at dinner, smiling at all the right moments, but never in a way that reaches his eyes.
The common room door slams open and a familiar flash of red catches Lavender’s gaze. She turns, a smile lighting up her face as Ron heads into the room.
‘I was surprised you’re not at your usual table?’ Luna says to him, moving out of the way as he leans up to look at the shelves above her.
He’s trying to think. Draco is smart. Severus would like to think he’s smart enough to have gotten the hell out of Diagon Alley the minute the attack started. He knows Lucius has been training Draco to apparate but he has no idea whether or not the boy has mastered the ability.
Colin’s grip tightens on the bag, and he reconsiders his idea to bring the photos out of the safety of his bag as Harry Potter drops into the seat directly opposite Ginny. The seat that happens to be next to Colin.
Swallowing, her gaze darting to Harry and back to Ron, she nods. ‘Alright,’ she says feeling tears sting her eyes. ‘Alright.’
The fear and the anxiety and the shame coil deep within Theo’s gut and he feels his face twist. ‘Say it!’ he snarls at Draco. ‘You think I won’t do it? You think I won’t send a bombarda right into those pretty green eyes? Or maybe a diffindo. Add a few scars to that fancy lightning bolt, hey?’
Potter frowns. ‘So, because we have to share classes together now, I must know where he is at all times?’
than fourth year. At least then she knew what needed to be done. But now...now neither of them will even admit there’s a problem. They just keep dancing around the issue and pretending it doesn’t exist.
Harry starts to laugh. He leans forward, to continue the conversation, but Malfoy goes stiff all of a sudden. He steps forward and grabs Potter’s arm.
echoes over the grounds, oddly muffled in the falling snow. She sees a small ball go flying across the pitch, and frowns. Why on earth was Ginny working with the bludgers?
A glint enters Harry’s eye. His hand slips, and Draco jerks in surprise, his whole body tensing as Harry’s hand cups him.
He spends his day waiting, growing increasingly impatient as he thinks of the various, much more productive, things he could be doing rather than pacing the small front room of his mother’s house. Such as grading papers, stocking up on supplies, ensuring the duelling dummies have all had their spells reworked, keeping Albus Dumbledore alive.
She pushes up from the couch, smoothing down her skirt again and sashays back out of the room. Honestly, they think she’s so vapid. Well, she knows things that they don’t.
Over the course of six years, Hannah hasn’t had much occasion to spend any significant time with Harry, but even so, through their limited interaction in class and in the DA, she had always thought him roguish and reckless. He is a magnet for trouble for sure, with all the classic markers of a Gryffindor: never running from a fight, mouthing off to teachers, fighting with Slytherin’s.
With her other boys, it was always easy to know what they needed. They were such loud and boisterous things (well, with the exception of Percy) that it took hardly any coaxing at all before they were spilling their worries to her or Arthur.
‘Hi Neville, hi Luna. Guess what?’ Ron adds, turning to Harry. ‘Malfoy’s not doing prefect duty. He’s just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.’
A/N: Okay you get an extra this week because I got excited by all the fluffiness. More to come next chapter with a full day at the Zoo (likely to be a long chapter!)
Draco says nothing and Blaise knows he’s not going to get anything further out of him. Whatever is on his mind, flying has—at the very least—helped him regain his composure. His thoughts are back under lock and key and there’s not even a hint of the elusive blush Blaise had seen the night before; nor the baffled confusion.
Ginny reaches out and grasps her hand. ‘Romilda, Milly…ohh, Milly, that’s so cute, can I call you Milly?’
When the conversation devolved from the friendly (if heated) debate to insults, Smith—apparently at his wits end—threw down his quill and exploded up out of his seat. ‘Would you two just shut the fuck up and kiss already?’
A hand closes around Neville’s arm and pulls him free of the flowers (which weren’t really trying to eat him, they were just curious). Neville sighs as the offending bulbous flower releases his arm without hassle. His robes are soaked through with a pungent smelling slime, but that’s nothing to the discomfort he knows he’s about to face.
He stomps toward their little cluster, his wand in his hand already, with Longbottom trailing behind him like a nervous yet loyal dog. Draco sighs. And here he was hoping he could slip away with Harry for a quick snog.
She glances across at Bella, who is lost amongst her own presents. ‘Let’s not disturb your Aunt,’ she says in a stage whisper, and Draco grins back at her and nods.
‘I didn’t name her,’ says The Speaker, his shoulders hunching, and Blue thinks that if he was a snake he would be coiled tight, fair in the crevice of a rock. ‘That’s just what she’s called.’
Unlike many of her fellow year-mates, Lisa has so far managed to avoid any particularly inflammatory encounters with Gryffindors and Slytherins during her years at Hogwarts. She even managed to steer clear of any of that
‘I sent him to the Hospital Wing,’ says McGonagall in a thin voice, turning her sharp eyed gaze on the rest of them. Almost instantly, her expression softens as she takes them in.
Harry and Malfoy become untangled. Harry’s eyes are open, and a surge of relief rushes through Ginny when she realises he’s still conscious, that he hasn’t been hit—a relief that is swallowed up by fear when she sees his broom tumble away from him. He twists in the air, arms outstretched, searching. His fingers brush the handle, once, twice, three times. On the forth, his hand locks around the broom.
Misery claws at Remus’ insides, reminiscent of the beast that overcomes him every full moon. He attempts to squash it but judging from the knowing look that crosses Kingsley’s face he doubts that he’s succeeded.
He’s already started to sort through them, eager to find that one photo that will take him on to the next level. He knows it’s in there. Feels it down to the core of his being. Between all the different house practices, the lazy afternoon catch up games, and the odd free fly Colin was lucky enough to capture, he knows that there is much potential.
Harry cries out, turning onto his back, his hands clenching around the edge of the stretcher. ‘Stop,’ he pleads in a hoarse voice that clenches at Ginny’s heart. ‘Make it stop. Please…it
Malfoy, as usual, ignores her, scratching out something that looks suspiciously like a potions essay.
‘Ron,’ says Hermione softly, gently. ‘How do you expect him to feel when you can’t even say the word?’
‘Tell Malfoy to take you to Episky’s,’ says Ron sleepily from the bed. ‘They have your file there, and they’ll be able to floo Pomfrey.’
Collecting the letter off the floor and the parcel, Theodore kicks open his own trunk and places the items deep within, beings sure to place a powerful locking charm (one far more powerful than the simple spell Draco had used to shield
Draco blinks. Sighs. Glances away and back again. Decides that if they’re going to do this, they might as well do it properly.
‘Gotta go,’ says Potter, pushing up. He pauses, hands still on the table as he looks down at Draco. ‘But you better make a decision fast. Today is the deadline for class projects, and I’m picking one with or without you.’
Potter shoots her a grin, and Tonks senses a touch of relief behind the expression. ‘I gave him the flick,’ he says.
Blaise glances up to see that Draco hasn’t moved. He’s still stairing up at the ceiling in much the same manner that Blaise had been mere moments before.
‘Er, so,’ says Ron, tapping his knees. ‘Any idea what happened? With the fire I mean? When we got there it was already out of control and you were, well, you know…’
Tonks tunes out the show. She’s never been overly interested in magical creatures (aside from watching Charlie Weasley’s antics during class) and if she’s honest, snakes just creep her out.
Thistle blinks her big eyes, glances over at Bella, and offers Narcissa a knowing nod. ‘Of course Mistress,’ she says, and quickly rearranges the piles. ‘Alright, Master Draco, these be’s your presents sir.’
Draco Malfoy stands near the far wall, weighing a bag contemplatively in one hand; his own bag slung across his shoulder.
‘If you ask me that one more time, I’m going to stuff the rest of that burger down your throat until you choke,’ says Malfoy in a huff, dropping his fork on the plate and sitting back. ‘Merlin, can’t you just say “thank you” like a normal person and move on?’
Harry doesn’t do any of those things. He grins, closes the distance between them, and kisses Malfoy right on his stupid mouth.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and scrapes his fork across his almost empty plate. ‘Yes, well, you were taking too long,’ he says, glancing sideways toward Hagrid.
As Blaise talks, he swipes the book, tucking it into the depths of his robes as if the exchange had never happened. Greg keeps his face impassive in case either of them look back at him again.
‘Of course you can,’ says the girl in a bright voice, nudging her shoulder into The Speakers. ‘After all she needs a name.’
She pulls back and shoots him a wide grin. ‘Well,’ she says. ‘We better get in as much snogging as we can, then?’
Vince shrugs. ‘Don’t know what’s so interesting about a book?’ he turns to Millicent—who is sitting on his other side—and asks, ‘You don’t like reading, do you?’
Thanks for reading and sticking with me so far. Double thanks to those of you leaving reviews; while I'm enjoying writing this immensely, your thoughts and feelings are always welcome and appreciated!
Malfoy doesn’t say it like an insult. He doesn’t even look away from the ceiling as he speaks, his voice calm and quiet. ‘I can do things you can’t,’ he continues. ‘Things you
Draco drops his bag by the end of the bed and then collapses face first into his pillow without even bothering to pull shut his curtains.
Blaise sighs. Really it’s not like he actually cared what happened between Potter and Draco, but the lack of Draco’s usual pompous behaviour concerning all things Potter has piqued Blaise’s curiosity. He’s spent years understanding the inner workings of the more emotionally damaged Slytherin’s to the point that he’s sort of the unofficial house councillor, and he’s not used to being unable to figure out his housemates.
Her gaze, as it usually does, lingers a moment longer on Potter. The boy doesn’t notice. He’s too busy dawdling, trying to pretend he’s still got things to do so he can hang back. Draco, likewise, is doing the same.
‘Not really,’ says Hermione. ‘After all, the Department of Mysteries is where it all started. Now that Voldemort is out in the open, the attacks are only going to get worse.’
that happened. I’m given to understand, from all the shouting just now—’ here he levels a glare at both Harry and Mr Nott, an impressive feat given that they are standing at opposite ends of the room, ‘—that there was an altercation? Would anyone care to elaborate?’
Potter tilts his head. He turns and mimics Malfoy’s position against the wall, leaning back and gazing up at the ceiling.
‘I wasn’t—this isn’t—I mean…Potter was having a nightmare…’ he trails off, his cheeks going crimson as he realises that this explanation is still rather out of character for him.
Harry glances back, and Eric offers him an apologetic smile. Harry holds back a sigh and looks back in front of him, wondering why on Earth he even agreed to this in the first place. No doubt Draco would berate him later for not just saying no, regardless of how pleased Hermione had looked when Harry had agreed. Hell, if it were Draco, he’d have hexed Eric for that dig at Luna.
So far the snitch has remained elusive, but the boys dart through the game every now and then, throwing the rest of the players into chaos and laughing all the while, spreading a sense of calm and enjoyment through the field.
developed a habit of sneaking off to the library,’ Blaise says. ‘You can blame us for thinking you might know where his new hideouts are.’
I received a question about Harry’s Zoo shirt and what it said...I’m gonna be honest, I thought of the scene and wrote it before I figured that part out, but then I couldn’t think of anything clever enough (hence why I never mentioned it again). I guess you’ll have to use your imagination for that part XD
‘Oh, poor little thing,’ she says, crouching down to pick it up. ‘What’re you doing way down there on your own?’
‘Mr Potter is suffering from magical exhaustion.’ The headmaster’s voice is as calm and gentle as ever and yet they send Draco’s vision into a spin.
‘No,’ says Harry, crossing his arms. ‘Look, have you found what we need yet? I’d like to get this done sometime
He glances up at her, the briefest flash of a scowl flitting across his face, which is more emotion than he’s shown since Poppy told him about the Curse.
‘So, uh, did you listen to the CD? Because you know I didn’t…that wasn’t…I only made it for the class. As an example, I mean. Not to…you know.’
Madam Pomfrey glances sideways at her, a wry smile lifting the corner of her mouth. ‘In a manner of speaking,’ she says. ‘Love potions are a compulsion, they remove inhibitions that the consumer would normally adhere to, allowing for the intense declarations of affection that love potions are renowned for. The loss of inhibition is the affect that tends to remain the longest. So that even when the impulse to love a particular
Greg wrinkles his nose, still not sure about that. Though, it’s not like he’d know. He can’t seem to get a girl to go out with him long enough to do anything more than snogging. He sighs and leans back, digging back through his bag of marshmallows as he considers the conversation.
Potter leans over the table, as if he’s divulging a secret. ‘I could tell you…but then how would you tell Professor Burbage that you think all muggle inventions are rubbish?’
‘Stupid sod,’ he mutters to himself, just barely loud enough for Narcissa to hear, but—despite the insult, the word is full of fondness.
Ginny leans across the table, handing Colin back his photos. ‘Oi,’ she says, and pins Harry with a pointed glare. ‘No conspiring without me. You promised.’
brought so low. To make him grovel for forgiveness. Instead, all he sees is Harry’s face. Harry curled up in pain after the fire. Harry tired and broken and scared the day after. Harry, with eyes that burn with pain, telling him he had to be alone.
She grins. ‘Good,’ she says, and passes him three photos. ‘Then you can look at these and tell me which one you like better.’
Poppy glances off to the side, frowning at the disturbingly small pile of books Minerva has managed to rummage up about Morgana Le Fay.
‘Ah, no,’ says Hagrid. ‘It’s just what we say when we’re talking about Keeper’s who can communicate with a Dragon. Or, I guess communicate isn’t the righ’ word. It’s more o’ a sixth sense.’
She sets down her quill and straightens up, taking a proper look at him ‘Something else on your mind?’ she asks.
Harry raises his eyebrows. He steps into the room, pushing his glasses up his nose to better inspect the painting. Sure enough, within the scene of two frolicking horses, is a small blonde boy sitting in the grass near the frame.
'Well yes. But then Harry’s never been to a magical Zoo before,’ says Luna. ‘He was raised by muggles after all. Draco’s teased him relentlessly about it, I'm afraid. He is right, though, it really is a pity. I still remember going with my mother. It was always my favourite holiday, we would go and--oh dear, is class over already?’
‘Gay?’ asks Ginny, her gaze narrowing at him, her face getting that dangerous glint their mother’s did whenever she was angry. ‘Merlin Ron, it’s just a word.’
‘Why don’t you try?’ he says, taking a step back and covering the move by gesturing to Eric, as if he’s giving the boy space to perform the spell.
‘…no. Surprise me. I don’t like being caught off guard. And you’ve been catching me off guard quite a bit.’
Honestly, the man might be some sort of grand potions master, but he has nothing on Snape’s attentiveness.
? Especially after everything he’s put you through. I mean, you guys blew up a classroom. Not to mention whatever the hell that was on the train.’
He rolls his eyes and sinks down further in the chair. ‘I’m fine, thanks,’ he says and pokes his tongue out at her.
Something bubbles away in the corner, filling the room with the scent of seaweed and chocolate. The smell tickles at Minerva’s nose, making her want to sneeze.
Vince shrugs, turning his magazine sideways. ‘Maybe,’ he says. ‘Pretty obvious that’s the problem though, isn’t it?’
‘It might surprise you to know, Scarhead, but you weren’t the only one that disliked that frilly, scrumpy, pink-pampered, stupid toad of a—‘
Still, there are enough students lingering about in the corridor that by the time she blinks away the memories, Harry is already pushing through the doors between carriages.
Without missing a beat, Malfoy leans back, turning in his chair to drawl, ‘even if there were, we all know you’d be too stupid to realise it’s worth and wind up loosing it anyway.’
Malfoy crosses the room, looking down to examine the tower of cards Luna and Ginny are making. ‘You need to place a card here or Weasley will win,’ he says, gesturing.
Harry scrunches up his nose. ‘Er, sorry,’ he says and offers the boy an apologetic—if sheepish—smile.
His breath starts to come ragged, and he gasps, unable to talk any further. He takes a deep breath, trying to focus on something, anything other than the crushing panic he can still feel echoing through his body. He hears a nearby snuffle and looks over. It’s late and the room is dark, but he can still make out the lump in the next bed. And in the one next to that.
She shakes her head and turns to Potter. ‘Alright,’ she says. ‘If you’re quite done, it’s your turn.’
She’s musing over how viable an excuse this is when she spots movement out of the corner of her eye. As if summoned by her very thoughts, Potter trundles out of the long grass in the field to Tonks’ left.
The light dims and Ron blinks, keeping the shield up and readying himself for a fight. Except there, in the middle of the hallway, is a giant stag made of light.
He doubles over, unable to slow the heaving gasps, dragging in too much and too little air all at once. His vision swims. No. No this can’t be happening. He can’t…He can’t be…
‘Of course,’ she says. ‘That’s what school is for, dear. To meet new people, to discover what you like in a person. No one expects you to marry the first person you date.’
They head back into the party, and Ginny can’t help but look for the blond haired Slytherin. He’s still with his posse of housemates, but his eyes are on the door when they walk in—as if he was watching for them. The minute he catches sight of her looking, he scowls, his gaze flicking away in disinterest, but not before she sees a flash of something else flicker across his face. A hint of jealousy, perhaps? She grins. Oh, this was going to be fun.
Draco ignores him, and before Theo even has a chance to recover, two more spells are thrown his way. A disarming spell, and a binding spell. Theo is frozen motionless where he stands, unarmed and undefended, with Draco’s wand levelled at his face.
Theo, coming to stand next to him, merely grunts. Brown just about bolted from the room the second the class was over, and Blaise wonders what on earth Theo did to the poor girl.
Harry grinned. He was about to retort, but the buzzer sounded and the cart was suddenly pulling away with a jolt that threw Harry and Draco forward and then slammed them back into their seats.
‘Ah sorry,’ says Hagrid, getting to his feet again and almost bumping into the skeleton above his head. ‘Didna mean to intrude.’
Harry ducks his head, scratching at the back of his neck in that way he does when he’s nervous or self-conscious.
Draco huffs, grey eyes dropping away to the side as a (rather adorable) soft pink flush works it’s way up his neck. ‘Well excuse me for being concerned for my child.’
Only, he’s going to see his best friend. That is, if Harry is still his best friend. Ron isn’t sure after their conversation yesterday. If it could be called a conversation. After all, that was why he was here, wasn’t it? On his own, ready to patch things up with Harry without anyone else getting in the way or confusing him.
‘No,’ says Madam Pomfrey, straightening up and glancing across at the boys. ‘As the potion wears off, the first thing to go is the hold of the potion maker. Some of the impulses and compulsions may remain, as you can see.’
Most surprisingly, however, is the fact that Harry doesn’t seem to like conflict. Oh, he argues with Malfoy all the time, but that’s different. It’s like a game they play. The constant teasing back and forth that is both barbed and caustic and yet…almost friendly.
Then the smell is gone, and so is Harry. Without a word, without a glance, and Draco knows that if he hexes Smith right now things will only get so much worse for Harry.
Severus startles at this. At first his eyes flash angry and dark when Poppy points ou the fact about his students being less afflicted, but when she excludes Malfoy confusion—followed quickly by worry that he can’t quite squash—replaces the anger.
. And he starts to shake. He knocks into a shelf and the whole thing comes tumbling down around them.
The Girl raises her eyebrows and glances between the two boys. Blue does the same. She doesn’t understand what has changed. Before the Christmas the Pale Boy talks off, they had visited her together. They would sit for an age by her tank in the early morning sun, bringing her Prey and scratching her scales.
Potter pauses. He shoots Malfoy a quick glance and says, in a rather diplomatic tone of voice, ‘Ah.’
?’ Ginny asks, steam practically coming out of her ears. ‘What exactly have I done to convince you that this
Brown stands there, staring down at the crumpled mess of ruined wrapping paper, blinking in surprise.
Potter leans over to have a look at the titles while Malfoy and Burbage have their staring competition.
‘Well, yes,’ says Malfoy. ‘And I suppose seeing you married off to the likes of some trussed up bimbo
How is it he can manage the intricate web of lies he has to weave between serving Dumbledore and the Dark Lord without so much as breaking a sweat, and yet dealing with his Godson on a personal level has him at a loss of words?
Draco pulls his towel away from his face and smirks at Potter. ‘I was messing with you,’ he says. ‘What, you think this is a thing, do you?’ He gestures between them, his tone clearly indicating that Potter was delusional.
‘Boys, please!’ Professor Burbage tries again. She rubs her temple. ‘As you’ve been told, Mr Malfoy, if you are struggling with the coursework you merely need to ask one of your classmates or myself for help.’
Harry didn’t care. The cart pulled back into the station, full of white faced riders, and adrenaline shot up Harry’s spine. He shuffled his weight from foot to foot, a face-splitting grin on his face as the attendant pulled open the gate and let them through.
So I've been writing this chapter one sentence a day for several weeks now and it has been a trial. I've been holding out on using the Dumbledore POV simply because I have such complicated feelings about his character. I'm not yet satisfied with this chapter, so I may come back and tweak it when I can, but it's been so long now since I last updated I just wanted to put something up to show you that I haven't disappeared.
He straightens and takes one step back from Malfoy. In an instant, Malfoy's guard is back up and the warmth vanishes from his eyes. Harry is
Ron scowls as he stomps back to the quidditch pitch locker rooms. He’s worn out from the game and really not in the mood for the long trek back to the pitch, but seeing as he’s gone and left his wand in there he really doesn’t have a choice. He sighs and tries not to think about Hermione’s berating voice in his head.
Draco considers this for a long moment. He rolls over onto the grass, removing a rock from under his hip and tossing it aside.
Also, there's a high chance of some major smut coming up so I may have to up the rating on this soon. There won't be any sex scenes, but there will be mentions of other activities. None of it will be overly explicit, but I'm going to add a warning at the top of the chapter anyway, just so everyone is forewarned. If this is an issue for anyone please let me know and I can also add a few bold asterisks (***) within the story before and after the scenes in question. Rest assured these scenes will not be overly frequent, and will only occur when the story requires it.
Harry sighs again (more for theatres than actual annoyance), and turns back to the Junior. ‘Sorry about this,’ he says and with a wave of his hand pulls all the remaining quills simultaneously from the Junior’s person.
‘These creatures,’ says the keeper with a smile. ‘They’re so misunderstood. People associate them with the dark arts because of creatures like Basilisks but most of them are beautiful and intelligent and well, quite simply wonderful. I’d love to be able to speak to them. To be a voice for them. I thought maybe…when I heard that Harry Potter was a parselmouth, maybe…’
He adds the last part as an afterthought, half a threat and half a promise, and isn’t sure which way he intends to mean it. Besides, they both know that Severus is likely to spend just as much time browsing ingredients as Draco is ogling over broomsticks.
‘Ah, let me,’ says Zabini and waves his wand, conjuring three more chairs around the now rather small table.
Draco peers up at him, his arms crossed tight across his wool-clad chest in an apparent attempt to stave off the cold. The beanie and scarf (wrapped twice around his neck) do nothing to reduce the flush of pink across his nose and cheeks that Harry can see even from his second-floor window.
Minerva casts a careful look toward Harry (who is so busy glaring at Mr Nott and avoiding Draco that he doesn’t notice it) and says guardedly, ‘that there was a fight in the Slytherin sixth year dorms, and that someone has been grievously injured.’
‘You were worried,’ he says. It’s a statement, not a question, albeit there’s surprise lacing his voice. ‘You were worried about me.’
Malfoy is still scowling as he shoves Harry’s bag at him and stomps toward the door, only glancing back over his shoulder at the door to give Harry an impatient look.
Potter sinks in his seat, ducking his head in that familiar way she’s noticed when he’s incited someone’s ire (besides Malfoy’s, of course).
? If anyone can change his mind, it’s you. Tell him what Pomfrey said, that it’ll be good for me. Tell him…tell him he can sick whatever bodyguard he wants on us!’
Harry and Ron did as they were told and moved on. Harry, counting the doors as they walked, stopped outside of one that had a large bronze Seven on it.
She raises one eyebrow at him and he shudders, half turning away from her. His breath comes faster and Poppy purses her lips. She steps forward.
‘Being out of breath is not the same as hyperventilating,’ she says briskly, and flicks her wand toward his chart.
‘You honestly expect me to believe that you don’t know what’s going on?’ Zabini is saying, one eyebrow arched artfully.
Pansy, of course, ignores Weasley. ‘I’m talking about Blaise’s little trysts with little miss goody two shoes,’ says Pansy in her most haughtiest tone.
’Think I’ll pass,’ says Harry, poking his tongue out. ‘Maybe you’ll learnt not to be an arse when people try to help you.’
‘Oh how very original, you know I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone call me a snake before,’ drawls Malfoy, and he turns to Harry, completely ignoring her. ‘About our Muggle Studies assignment. I think I have an idea.’
Minerva has had enough. She exchanges a look with Poppy (who is watching from the door to her office, a harried and exasperated look on her face).
Longbottom shrugs, cuts a glance across to Granger, and shuffles out of the room. Granger, giving Draco (who is pretending to rustle around in his bag) one last piercing look before heading off. That leaves just the remaining Slytherins.
They stumble and the blond has to brace himself against the sinks so they don’t go tumbling over onto the ground.
A flash of pale blonde hair catches Hermione’s eye as Malfoy glances out at them. A scowl flashes across his face, but he doesn’t say a word. He simply turns back to the window, his elbow propped up on the sill and resumes staring out at the flashing countryside.
Beneath her, the gentle swaying of her mare’s walk slows to a stop as her hands to slack on the reigns. Draco pulls up, glancing across at her nervously. He opens his mouth, closes it, looks away.
‘Of course you do,’ sneers Ron. ‘Did you really think this would work? You think that just because you’ve proven what I
You're a light at the end of a dark day. Cheers to all of you and I hope the world is treating you kindly in these trying times.
Outside her tank, the Girl and the Pale One are still talking. Blue tries to block them out (wallowing in her own sadness that she drove the Speaker away) but the urge to listen and learn cannot be denied.
Draco pauses, gaze flickering down to the cover as uncertainty flashes through his gaze. He shakes his head, fists clenching as he glowers, as if his glare alone will pierce a hole in Potter’s head.
Voices clamour for the attention of Rosmerta, despite that it’s a weekday and there are no students to crowd the tables of the Three Broomsticks. Remus pushes his way through the small and yet exuberant crowd with reluctance, heading toward the side booth that the others have already claimed.
The air whistles by her ears as she flattens herself against her broom, half rolling as she ducks and weaves through the oppositions defences.
Light, blinding and white, erupts in front of her and Ginny cries out, pulling up to a stop. In the absence of the wind there’s a sudden quiet. So she hears the splash that follows the blinding flash.
Draco’s body goes cold and still, the pounding in his head dying away to nothing (whether due to the potion or his shock, he doesn’t know). Without thinking, he swings his legs off the bed and follows Pomfrey, eyes fixed to the prone body on the other bed.
It’s almost comical, the way his eyes go wide, the way his expression pales into complete horror as his mouth drops open, speechless and sputtering.
Also, I have decided to reopen my tumblr account. I will be posting updates and maybe sneak peaks and snippets over there every now and then, so feel free to hop on over if you have one and say hello: thejadewritergirl.tumblr.com
The pleased feeling vanishes. ‘Do you really think that little of me?’ Lavender asks, her voice low.
partners with him. Couldn’t you get him to give it back? Preferably without a fight. I’d rather us not lose more house points.’
Dean shakes his head in disgust. ‘Fine, whatever,’ he says and spins around, stomping for the door. ‘I hope you’re happy together.’
She turns to face him, ignoring the couch, and says in an even, deceptively calm voice. ‘It’s Draco.’
Surprise puts a halt on the anger burning through him, and Harry is momentarily distracted by the memory of the shield. Suddenly, he’s back in that room, a spell racing toward him, his heart hammering in panic.
The room spins. Luna turns, her vision moving in slow motion, playing catch up to her body’s movements. Ron is gaping at Draco, brown eyes large beneath raised eyebrows.
. The images are crisp and clear, clearly well memories, every smile a treasured memory that Draco frantically tries to yank away from him.
Hagrid—who was watching Potter at the cart—startles and looks down at Malfoy in surprise. As if he’s unused to the boy’s attention.
Harry laughs. ‘Alright,’ he says, and runs a hand through his hair. ‘Actually, it’d be nice to have someone to talk to about it. I feel like I’ve been loosing my mind.’
hopeless,’ says Draco, poking him in the chest and ignoring the indignant hiss from Blue. ‘Honestly, what were you thinking coming out here?’
‘Because I saved your life?’ Draco asks, he means it to sound mocking, but his voice has lost it’s edge.
She’s not entirely sure why she’s chosen to abandon her delightfully warm home and head all the way out here uninvited; only that her mother had made some crack about her moping and Tonks’ had decided that she’d rather be anywhere else than endure yet another conversation about spending the holidays “alone”.
She grins at him, and he feels a slight wave of relief. She wouldn’t be so relaxed if she’d overheard his complaining. He scoots over, making room for her on the seat next to him, but a call from across the room calls her attention away.
‘Is there are reason you’re still sitting here, Potter?’ asks Pansy, drumming her nails along the table top.
‘Well I didn’t think you did it up on purpose, but seriously Harry,’ she shakes her head. ‘You’ve got to get a handle on this.’
Draco is staring at Vince, a contemplative expression on his face, twirling his wand around and around in his hand. The way he always does when he’s trying to puzzle something out.
‘Harry,’ says Draco in a carefully controlled voice, his entire body rigid and yet motionless, as if Potter is a wounded animal that will attack at the smallest provocation.
Ron narrows his eyes. He sighs and slouches back against one of the other cabinets with his arms crossed, staring toward the door while Draco works. The room grows quiet, and yet, the air fills with a static energy. An anticipation that forms in tiny, minuscule drops of perspiration on Ron’s upper lip, across Draco’s brow, and along the back of Luna’s neck.
He can see the cogs work working in Severus’s mind, the suspicion of Albus being up to something, the confusion at it being something that for once (in his mind) doesn’t benefit Harry.
At the soft, gentle way she’s watching him. Without any surprise. Without any confusion. Like she really does know that he couldn’t make it stop. He swallows.
‘Serves you right,’ Severus snaps. ‘What were you thinking? Do you ever listen? Do you ever think about anyone other than yourself?’ Severus shakes his head and adds in a low voice. ‘After everything, I would have thought you’d know better by now.’
In the photo, Harry reaches out for the door of his flat, turning back to glance at Draco with a shy smile. Draco grins, leans forward, and plants a soft kiss on Harry’s lips, and Harry’s face lights up brighter than Christmas morning.
Ron had thought maybe Harry had come out to the pitch to fly and let off some steam, but what if that isn’t the
He starts back toward the house, closing the last little bit of distance between them and the back door, his footsteps trudging loudly in the snow. Tonks stays where she is. She’s mulling over their conversation, debating whether or not she should even bother going in or report back to Kingsley.
By the time Hermione had heard what had happened last night it had been too late to go and see them. Though she had rushed down to the Hospital Wing first thing that morning, Ron and the others had already been released. Harry was the only one to remain, and Madam Pomfrey had firmly denied Hermione access, telling her to “come back in the afternoon, when the boy has had a chance to catch his breath”.
Hermione can practically feel Ron bristle beside her, but she squeezes his hand and he stays quiet. Though he shoots her an irritated glare that she pretends not to see.
Draco continues to scratch Winnie behind the ears, refusing to look in Narcissa’s direction as she digests his words. At first, surprise flows through her. Whilst it is not wholly unusual for Slytherins to date outside their own house (purebloods
Luna touches his arm lightly, casting him a sidelong look which he pretends he doesn’t see. Instead, he shuffles forward, his footsteps sliding along as if the floor is ice, as he might fall if he overbalances or takes one misstep.
She steps into the brightly lit shop and glances around, her eyes assaulted by various toys, shirts and prospective souvenir’s—each one claiming to be the very
Before dreamlessness can consume him memories go crashing through his brain. The match. Flying through the air. Potter laughing. The bludger, heading straight for them. Shock, fear, realisation. It’s going to hit them. It’s going to hit
‘Hey,’ says Draco, nudging Harry’s hip with his toe. ‘You better not be leaving me to finish this thing by myself.’
He’s pale and shivering and looks up at her from behind his glasses with a wild sort of desperation.
‘Hang on, how the hell could Potter kill Malfoy when he’s up in the Hospital Wing right now? I heard he hasn’t left his bed in days.’
Colin flushes and scratches the back of his neck. ‘Uh, well, almost,’ he says, his hand falling to the bag on the bench next to him.
Poppy doesn’t falter. Spells shoot rapid fire from her wand without instruction, and the wounds covering Malfoy’s torso begin to knit back together slowly.
Kingsley arches an eyebrow at her, the smallest of smirks on his face, and follows her lead. Mad-Eye eyes them both for a moment longer, brows furrowed in distrust.
Malfoy, half sitting in a chair and half sprawled on the side of Potter’s bed, shifts, and lifts his head from where it rests on Potter’s arms.
Harry blinks. In a sudden flush, his face goes beat red. ‘Uh, no. No I, uh, I don’t think…this isn’t, uh…I have to go.’
Potter, on the other hand, looks miserable. He’s sitting slouched in his chair, attempting to look as small as possible as he focuses entirely on eating. Granger and Weasley are leaning over the table, trying and failing to talk to him, but he shakes his head at them and stuffs another mouthful of shepherds pie in his mouth.
The scowl he gives her could melt butter, and she winks at him, smiling in victory. ‘Anyway’ she says lightly, ‘that’s all I had to say.’
Severus clenches his jaw. ‘What is it with everyone thinking Albus can help them? He’s not infallible you know? You really think he can protect your mother? Protect
‘Morning Potter,’ he says. ‘Haven’t seen Draco lurking around anywhere have you? We seem to have misplaced him.’
The blush swarms back into place and he ducks his head. ‘Er, yeah,’ he says. ‘I thought I’d been hexed or something.’
Potter throws it back. ‘I don’t know the first thing about runes, and besides, I’m not allowed to use magic, remember.’
‘I can if it works,’ says Malfoy and then pins his gaze on Neville, freezing him in place. ‘Where do you think you’re going?’
They start filtering off, back toward the castle, and for the most part no one takes any notice of the fact that Harry and Draco are still standing together. Draco keeps his face carefully neutral, being sure to sneer in the direction of anyone whose gaze lingers too long, but inside he feels oddly satisfied by the way their gazes glaze over them. Well, mostly everyone.
‘That would be cheating,’ Blaise remarks, but, the minute Slughorn’s back is turned, he vanishes the failed potion.
It’s a strange feeling, the sense of control that flows through him when his spell hits her. She resists him for a moment, and Theo frowns, strengthening the force of his spell, his hand tight around his wand, the grain rough against his palm.
Bella, of course, doesn’t notice Draco’s mood. After all, she barely knows him—or he her—and besides, Bella has never held that appreciation for the softer side of men and Narcissa is almost grateful that Draco’s own child-like wonder has all but disappeared beneath the surface of his adult self.
‘Daphne’s a classy lady,’ says Theo, surprising them all, but not bothering to look up from the essay he’s working on. ‘She wouldn’t approve of kissing and telling.’
The blond boy turns back to Harry, putting his hand over Harry’s mouth to cut off any further talking. ‘Hush.’
‘You’re upset because he isn’t being a pain in the arse?’ Theo asks, glancing sideways at Blaise again.
Little bit of smut for you seeing as the next two chapters (which are almost finished!) are a bit more serious.
She doesn’t pretend not to know. She would have, once. She would have enjoyed it, too. Dangling the information in front of him until he gave her something worth her knowledge. He would have, too. That was the game was played. He knew it, and so did she.
‘Have you ever noticed,’ Luna asks Ginny (one of the few friends she can speak to about any topic without fear of judgement), ‘how uncomfortable Harry gets when he’s approached by people?’
‘Malfoy?’ the boy gaps. He pulls his arms against the restraints. ‘What the fuck? What the hell is this?’
Katie shakes her head and rubs her hands together. ‘Nothing,’ she says. ‘It doesn’t matter. Let’s get up in the air before we freeze.’
‘Like,’ says Draco, as if explaining something to a small child. ‘What kind of action? Are you a Chaser or a Seeker? Do you bother with quaffle at all or are you all about catching the snitch?’
He’s already had to deal with the Smith situation once today, and is in no mood to listen to anymore of Zabini’s excuses on the matter.
,’ she says sharply. ‘After all, us ghosts can get quite lonely. Sometimes we like to share stories about the interesting things that happen to us. There’s so little that’s interesting that happens in here—‘
She has an armful of things that scatter all over the place as she drops them onto her desk. She straightens up, sweeps her hair out of her face and turns to check the display table—all the while chattering away like an excitable first year.
. You want to see him cry?’ Harry flicks off a mild stinging hex with a casual wave of his hand. Scorpius, naturally, starts to wail. ‘There. Now he’s crying’
‘Very well then,’ she says. ‘I see you want to do it the hard way. Who do I need to threaten to tell about this little relationship before you tell me the truth? Professor Snape? Dumbledore? Your parents, perhaps?’
Until Zacharius Smith gets up. He heads up to the front of the room with his usual flare for the dramatic. Hannah catches Susan’s eye again and they both roll their eyes.
Hagrid glances back at the other students, still hanging back from the disappearing meat, and chuckles. ‘No fear o’ that I think.’
Oh sure, everyone thinks Albus Dumbledore is all wise and all knowing, but what they don’t realise is behind his calm, omniscient facade is some rather questionable information gathering habits.
Draco tasted like coffee, and chocolate, and warmth and Harry was melting, drowning in the taste and the surprising roughness of Draco’s lips. He pushed Draco back onto the bed, his breathing heavy with his own adrenaline and daring, and offered Draco a little, lopsided grin.
‘One step after the other,’ he mumbles, dragging himself and all his bed covers over to Potter’s bed.
Draco’s head snaps around, gaze fixing on Smith as fury surges up his spine. He hadn’t noticed the boy come in past them and this time he lets himself go for his wand.
‘Be normal teenagers,’ agrees Minerva. ‘That’s what Potter said,’ and here she shoots Albus a significant look. ‘That it’ll be one of his last chances to be a normal teenager.’
Draco shrugs. ‘Sure, sometimes. Sometimes it’s more. Sometimes I think about things that have happened, like that time we fought the Ravenclaws. Sometimes I imagine doing more things with you, sometimes I imagine less.’
Draco leans forward, watching him with narrowed eyes. ‘So, what, that’s it then? That’s as far as your knowledge goes?’
Draco sucks in a sharp breath, not at all prepared for the sudden touching, and loses focus for a moment.
‘Dean, wait,’ says Potter. ‘There’s nothing going on, I swear. Dean…We’re not…I’m not...for fucks sake, I’m
After a long moment, in which Malfoy continues to frown at Potter, he finally says, ‘Sure. I’ll have—‘
‘Now, now Severus,’ says Albus amiably, ‘give the boy a chance to speak, as Minerva promised. Mr Nott, I gather you understand the gravity of your actions?’
The thought of her boyfriend—who she has barely seen all summer—washes away the irritation of the last hour. She grins and pushes off into the train.
‘Of course,’ says Potter, cutting off Hagrid. ‘We have to head back to school in another hour or so, but I can come back and get it before we go if you like?’
The library is hushed and soothing, a welcome change to the loud and somewhat overwhelming raucous energy cascading down the halls of Hogwarts in the wake of returning students. Luna sighs, stretching out her hands to run the tips of her fingers along the spines of the books that are more friends to her than most the students in her year.
As she nears, she realises that he’s soaking wet, and as he drops onto the edge of his bed, her first order of business is to cast a drying spell.
He tilts his head at Nott and the two of them proceed to class. Hermione sighs, and hopes that she won’t come to regret this decision.
‘Hey!’ Ron objects, though he sees the uncertainty on Harry’s face and seems to realise what he’s said. ‘I just mean that whatever spell you used must have been crazy powerful.’
Malfoy is right, of course. This relationship is bad news. At least for Malfoy. The boy is on the wrong side of the war to be taking up with the Boy Who Lived, and Phineas wonders what in the name of Magic possessed Malfoy to get involved with him in the first place.
‘Yesss,’ says Draco, his exhale creating a hissing sound on the tail end of the word. ‘And it’s complicated, so shut up and let me concentrate or we’ll wind up having to use your thick head to get into it.’
content, and twists within the confines of the tank to rub against one of the rocks. She is glad she will be getting a new home as she has grown far too big for this one.
Parvati lines up a sash of red over a bright swath of pink fabric. ‘Is this too much?’ she asks, tilting her head at the colour scheme. ‘It’s very…pink.’
Malfoy starts to head back, pauses and turns back to the counter. ‘Actually,’ Tonks hears him say. ‘Could I get a framed copy of the map?’
Draco may have chosen not to complete his task, but Theo…that wasn’t something he was capable of doing.
Weasley rolls his eyes. ‘Harry’s already said he doesn’t know where the stupid git is, so why don’t you go look somewhere else?’
He gets it under him, but instead of stopping, instead pulling up out of the nose dive he’s in, he flattens himself and rockets downwards.
Ginny holds up a hand. ‘Harry, please. I already told you you can’t lie to me. Besides, you know how you said you don’t know how to flirt? Well
Ginny looks up from the photos she’s inspecting with interest. ‘You got photos of those two flying?’ she asks, her voice impressed.
‘Like tigers hunting,’ says Luna, before her gaze falls on another potions book. ‘Or an Erumpent in mating season.’
He jogged over, grabbing Malfoy’s arm and dragged him toward the line. ‘First one to puke pays for lunch.’
Ginny rolls her eyes, but makes no effort to contain the broad grin that’s stretched out across her face. ‘Oh, don’t be so melodramatic,’ she says. ‘I won’t tell anyone. If anything…I’m mostly just confused. I didn’t even know you’re gay.’
Hermione frowns. At the end of the bed, both Ginny and Luna are pretending to re-start their card game, but Hermione can see them watching Harry out of the corner of their eyes. Ginny’s frown is full of worry and even Luna looks concerned, twining a long, beaded necklace around and around her hand.
Poppy steps out of her office, no doubt alerted by his arrival, in full medi-witch readiness only to pause when she sees it's him. Her eyes narrow at him as she halts.
of her shoes pervades the air as Poppy Pomfrey performs some long overdue maintenance spells. There are no patients to deal with. No first years suffering from some mishap or other, no home sickness, no first day potions accidents (for the first time in
‘He will certainly have his chance,’ agrees Minerva. ‘But as Mr Malfoy is not yet quite up to talking and
‘Never say never,’ says Blaise, rolling his shoulders and winking at a Hufflepuff girl as she passes.
He ignores it and flicks his wand out from its hiding place in his sleeve, sending up a flare out of the way but where he’s sure Potter will see it. That is, if he’s paying attention to anything other than the reckless flying he’s doing.
This is untrue. Hermione knows this is untrue because she had to walk around their make out session this morning to get out of the common room.
Fury swells in his gut. He doesn’t want to see this. Potter isn’t supposed to be weak. Potter is supposed to be…
‘Oh please,’ says Poppy, turning and flicking her wand and Potter’s chart. ‘Don’t pretend you didn’t notice. I know you better than that.’
‘What’s so wrong about my knowing if anyone has caught your interest,’ she asks, feigning insult. ‘You can’t expect me to believe that no one
you’ll tell me who it is,’ she shoots him a wink and wanders off to fetch them drinks, ignoring his protests.
Tonks sighs and raises a hand to run through her hair. Without her even thinking about it, her hair shortens, the style coming up around her shoulders, a fringe bouncing into place just as her fingers rake through it. Almost as soon as the motion is over, it lengthens back out.
Draco eyes the rectangular box with a curious frown, accepting the heavy looking gift and turning it over in his hands to inspect. On one side is a hastily scrawled message in black ink, and when Draco’s eyes fall on it, he stills, staring att he words in shock.
It’s not the trees—placed strategically in every room—or the bright swaths of tinsel, or the charmed layers of snow that never melted despite the constant roaring of the fireplace.
‘You’ve read it three times,’ says Theo tiredly, staring down at his breakfast with a rather nauseated expression. ‘Surely you know by now.’
Having witnessed Harry being outed once already this year, Colin had no intention of doing it again.
They’re duelling in DADA and Snape once again interrupts Harry and Ron’s duel. It’s starting to become a habit.
There’s a sudden quiet behind him followed by a frenzied scrambling. Neville doesn’t want to turn around. He doesn’t want to face them.
Theo has Potter at wand point, and yet there are three other people in the room who could disarm Theo and protect Potter. And they would, too. Theo can see that. Oh, not before Theo hexed him, but really, how much damage could Theo do with one spell? Even he’s not sure of his own conviction.
Also, I'm probably going to stick to once weekly updates for a while as I've recently found out about a health issue that's going to make things a bit difficult for me for the foreseeable future. I'm still churning out chapter summaries though and I'm getting an idea on how to finish this story (still a fair few chapters to go though) so I hope you stick with me.
Ron can’t listen to anymore. Before he’s even fully thought it through, he’s stepping out of the hallway and into the locker room.
Malfoy narrows his gaze at Potter and leans back against a nearby table. ‘Really? Is this how it’s going to be from now on?’
are,’ shouts the Pale One, and magic cracks through the air, making Blue flinch. ‘I’m the one down here every morning, making sure she’s okay, feeding her and checking on her tank while you just hide away in your stupid tower! You won’t even talk to her. Let me guess, you’re suddenly too good to bother conversing with her in parselmouth right? I mean, talking to snakes is
A lot has changed this year, he knows. He's seen it. Harry and Malfoy don't act like the squabbling pups of crups anymore, but rather regard each other with wary watchfulness. Malfoy himself, even, has been less troublesome than usual, though neither have seemed to give Hagrid the full enthusiasm he had hoped for.
Draco arches one eyebrow, glancing over Harry with a sigh of disapproval. ‘For the love of Morgana, Potter, I feel cold just
offered to set an example by becoming partners in all subjects, to the point that they have even changed classes in order to show how inter house unity should occur. Violence is not tolerated at Hogwarts. Anyone who receives a three strike warning for not cooperating with a member of another house will be suspended and then expelled.’
He stares back at Malfoy. At the wide grey eyes and high cheekbones and the soft, pale hair slightly ruffled from their tousle and consequent fall.
He knows they’ve had to learn to get along since McGonagall’s stupid seating plan. And sure, maybe he gets that. But this? This is more than just being civil, more even than being
Harry replies, already refocused on her over Draco, and Draco’s already sour mood digs it’s claws in deep. He obviously doesn’t give a single damn that Draco has been traipsing around all afternoon looking for him.
Some of the sludge, which somehow didn’t manage to spatter any further than the immediate radius around their desk, siphons away into a vial the professor produces from inside his robes.
‘Because you’re standing out here in the freezing cold hitting bludgers,’ says Ginny dryly. ‘C’mon Harry, somethings obviously got you worked up. Tell me what’s wrong.’
‘Oh. Thanks, I—,’ says Potter, putting the glasses on only to take them off immediately to stare at them. ‘These aren’t my glasses.’
Draco sighs. He pushes up onto his knees and knocks the scrubbing brush out of Harry’s hand. Harry glances up at him, that sad little smile playing on his lips, and Draco suddenly wants nothing more than to make that expression go away.
‘Dying? But you can’t…you can’t be dying. I mean, there has to be a way to fix it, right? There’s got to…’
A strange smile crosses her face that is part wry amusement and part despair. ‘I know only two things about the person Draco is seeing,’ she says, and she pauses, once again giving him that shrewd expression, assessing him before she gives her answer. ‘Whoever it is who has captivated my son, isn’t one of your Slytherins. He is a halfblood boy.’
Malfoy rolls his eyes again. ‘It’s no wonder you’re so bloody skinny,’ he says, but he pulls the plate toward him and starts to pick at the chips.
She presses her fingers into the soft leather cover of the book. Three letters are pressed into the top right hand corner, barely visible in the deep red of the leather. HJP. She runs her finger over the letters, feeling the deep indent and somehow taking comfort from it.
‘Harry? Ginny?’ Neville pokes his head in from the direction they came, worry etched into his face. ‘Are you guys okay?’
‘Yeah but…’ Parvati sighs. ‘I mean, are you sure everyone else will like it? Do you remember when Professor Lockhart organised Valentines…I just, this is our mark. The teachers almost never let students plan things like this, I don’t want to mess it up.’
Harry brushes soap suds off him. ‘Alright, alright,’ he says. ‘Sorry. It’s just, I don’t really think of myself as…’
of the cards falling against each other the only sound in the room. There’s a tension in her shoulders and a distant frown on her face and she goes through the motions as if on instinct. One of the cards catches, and half the pack spills from her hands. Ginny startles, shaking herself out of whatever thought she had been trapped in.
Thistle starts handing out the gifts from each of the three piles. As Narcissa accepts the first from her own pile—a gift from the Parkinson’s—she watches Draco out of the corner of her eye.
Malfoy opens his mouth—no doubt to reply with some sort of retort that will drag this pointless conversationist far too long—but Hermione cuts him off. ‘Harry is sick,’ she says.
Draco doesn’t answer. He simply turns and stalks back down the corridor. Harry follows and, despite years of Auror training, feels a brief flash of anxiety surge up his spine.
Zabini and Hermione both jump, and Lavender blinks, just as surprised as they are for having spoken. They both stare at her, obviously not having realised she was there.
‘I usually see you there during study break,’ she says, turning to hand him the book. ‘The Magical Creatures section is back there, and there’s a few lounge chairs near your table that are rather comfortable to read in. Besides, it’s quieter back there. Easier to think.’
Harry stops, eyes going wide as he stares at the park spread out before them. He knew, of course, that there was a park at the end of his street. But he’d only visited it once when he first bought the place (and only then because Hermione had insisted he know what the neighbourhood was like).
‘That’s pretty good. Enough to get you an O on the spell at any rate,’ he says, suddenly wanting this little lesson to be over with. ‘If you keep practicing you’ll have it in no time.’
‘I do,’ Harry says, slouching down on the bed as his eyes droop sleepily. ‘Draco always smelt really good. Like honey and lemons and hazelnut coffee.’
As she blinks away the salt water, tears helping to clear away the awful sting in her eyes, she sees that it’s Ron and Katie who have Malfoy. Ron glances back over his shoulder at her, worry in his face, and she pulls a tired arm out of the water to wave at him, trying to reassure him that she’s okay.
He takes a deep breath. He knows. Deep down he knows. First the shield, and then the pitch. Every tiny little bit of accidental magic since (exploding bludgers and cracking glass) and now this. The fire. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that there’s something not quite right going on. But fear still grips him.
She offers him a weak smile. ‘A little,’ she says. ‘The sun doesn’t seem to be reaching the castle today.’
The stunned, too-wide expression on Draco Malfoy’s face jerks him back to the present and a cold feeling of horror washes over Harry, chasing away the contentedness.
Albus raises a hand, attempting to stem the tide of Harry’s temper. With a vague sense of alarm he notices another swell in magic. ‘Harry, I assure you I am only thinking of Mr Malfoy’s best interests. I’m sure you are aware of the conversation between Mr Malfoy and myself, however I have, for some time now, doubted the veracity of your current “rivalry” as some have called it. You cannot deny that you have both lost the previous fire of animosity which once existed between you.’
She gives him a cool look, as mistrustful as any of his housemates, before relaxing her shoulders and offering him a soft smile. ‘Yeah, it was. Thanks.’
A smile stretches across Harry’s face. Somehow, Draco never tires of seeing it. Bloody great big sap that he’s become. Well, at least when he’s around Harry.
Draco nods, and leans back against the tree, determined to at least look unperturbed. After all, he doesn’t need Harry’s instinct to flee kicking in again.
He turns away from Ginny and swings hard. The bat connects and the sound that echoes out across the pitch is concussive. The bludger explodes. Katie flinches even though she’s standing several feet away.
A strange look crosses Harry’s face at Bellatrix’s name. ‘I…sorry, I don’t feel well,’ he says, cutting off Slughorn.
Draco flushes. ‘Yes. A bloody gesture. And a great, fat lot of good it’s done me, too.’ He shakes his head, turning away to run a hand through his hair.
Harry tries to swallow but finds his throat has gone dry. His chest restricts painfully and he’s all too aware of the baffled confusion and mounting realisation building in Malfoy’s expression and oh god he wishes the ground would swallow him up whole right here and now.
People stared up at the thing in varying degrees of discomfort or even fear, though Tonks noted that Potter was one of the few people gazing up at it in awe.
‘Okay,’ he says, and feels some of the tension bleed out of Harry. ‘But only if you tell me what’s going on.’
‘Are they ready yet? I’d love to see them,’ she says, and shoots him a grin. ‘I mean, only if I look badass, of course.’
As Harry passes Smith, he catches sight of Draco, of the wand in Draco’s hand. He gives a tiny, surreptitious shake of his head.
His face falls, the frown deepening across his features as guilt flashes through his eyes. Instantly, she regrets her tone.
‘What?’ Harry asks, and then shakes his head as he realises the state he’s in (the fact that he didn’t even notice speaks
The door creaks open and someone shuffles into the bathroom, making no effort at discretion. Unless he thinks soft humming is subtle.
He pushes himself to his feet while Weasley continues to gape at him like the great gormless git he is.
want is for you to do anything your not comfortable doing. I can take care of myself. Frankly it wouldn’t be any fun if I knew you weren’t enjoying it.’
With dawning horror, Harry realised that not only was he sharing a room with Malfoy, but he was sharing a room with Malfoy
They shrink down to children before her eyes, standing with their arms crossed, their shoulders touching even as they glare in opposite directions, like little boys too stubborn to admit they want to play together.
Something both familiar and foreign flashes in Harry’s gaze. Familiar because she’s seen that expression many times over the last six years, but foreign in that she’s never seen it on
‘Well, I guess we have to figure out what each of us thinks is going on, and make the bet according to that. But nothing too broad. For instance, I think that something happened in the Defence classroom that they’re not telling us, but I don’t think they fought.’
Minerva merely twitches her lips into a sardonic smile as she steps the rest of the way out of the fireplace. ‘How is he?’
‘I…okay,’ he says, trying not to let his feelings show in his voice. ‘Sorry, I…I didn’t mean to…’ he trails off, not exactly sure what he’s done wrong.
Still, Lisa casts a sticking charm to her inkwell, very aware that her table (situated directly behind the pair) is likely to get caught up in any squabble that may breakout.
Ron glances up from his essay, chewing on his quill. ‘Hm? Like who?’ he asks, completely oblivious as usual.
‘While I appreciate the thought, Charity,’ says Minerva with a small frown, frustrated at their lack of options. ‘I do agree that we shouldn’t make too much of a fuss about it. There’s no sense in us all rearranging our schedules to make it work.’
Luna blinks, shaking her head free of the image. Draco leans heavily on the wall, his fingers working at the tie around his neck, loosening it as he sucks in sharp gasps of air.
rumours this summer of the Department of Mysteries. Of course, there’s the summer attacks as well. You were there, too, weren’t you? At Diagon Alley?’
‘No,’ says Draco and Harry looks up at him in surprise. ‘The point is to make you feel better about it. So, no, if you don’t want to talk about it, we won’t.’ Draco shrugs.
Kingsley glances up as she enters the office, giving her a brief nod before refocusing on whatever report he’s working on. ‘Anything to report?’
,’ Albus says, still with that tiny frown he’s trying to hide. He glances hopefully at Severus, but Minerva jumps in before he can ask.
She shakes her head and tries to put it out of her mind. Despite the way everyone else behaves, what Harry thinks of her isn’t her problem. She can deal with one brooding sixth year being PO’ed with her. Besides, she has far more important things to worry about. Like her NEWTs exams.
). ‘Oh, that. Never mind.' He runs a hand distractedly through his already messy hair. 'Look, can we talk? Please?’
He blinks at her. A blush swarms up his neck and he ducks his head, a small grin on his face and she realises that maybe she doesn’t tell him that enough. Maybe
‘What…what do you mean?’ asks Neville, eyes wide as he glances around the table. ‘Why hasn’t Madam Pomfrey healed him?’
As long as Ron has known him, Harry has hated changing in front of other people—let alone showering when there’s people around—and yet here he is. Alone in the shower with Draco sodding Malfoy.
Shock blends into annoyance. Malfoy glances at Harry, who doesn’t seem to have noticed Ginny at all. Worry creeps into his expression, and angers surges in Ginny’s gut.
Oh yes. She can definitely see it now. Now that the gloom has been washed away to be replaced by an entirely
get back late from detention last night,’ says Blaise. ‘Curious, isn’t it?’ before Potter can answer, Blaise shifts his focus, the smirk never wavering from his face, and looks up into the furious gaze of one Draco Malfoy. ‘Ah, Draco,
The room seems to exhale collectively, even Albus allowing himself a small sense of relief as he feels Malfoy's life-magic grow steady.
Dean fumbles for a moment. He crosses his arms. Uncrosses them. Flushes. Stares back at Ginny in a mixture of defiance and embarrassment.
Minerva purses her lips but dips her head. ‘I suppose,’ she says, and glances at the remaining Slytherins. ‘Have you ascertained the cause of this situation.’
Draco looks down at the table, grey eyes confused and—yes, still distracted. His gaze flickers to the other side of the room, almost without him realising. Blaise follows the direction of the glance and can’t help the small smirk that twitches at his lips.
It takes Greg a moment to figure out what the hell they’re talking about. After all, Potter is a Gryffindor, not a Ravenclaw. But it’s not until they’re settling themselves at Slytherin table that a flash of colour at the head table catches his eye. Dumbledore, in a pair of bright orange robes, that are somewhat reminiscent of the Phoenix that lives in…something in Greg’s brain clicks and he realises that Daphne and Blaise were talking about the Order. The opposite side. Greg pauses with the jug of juice halfway to his glass.
She nods. ‘Yes,’ she says. ‘I want Draco to tell him about his task, to help him find a way out of it.’
‘I know you don’t really talk to—’ Draco pauses, and cuts a quick look across to Bella. ‘Anyway, I hope you don’t mind. I just thought you might like it.’
‘I…er, we’ll try our best,’ says Harry weakly but Myrtle gives him a hard look, shooting forward to get right up in his face (she only wishes she could get in his face like
She steps around the end of the bed and sits on the edge a little ways from him. She allows her face to soften, though she keeps her shoulders straight, showing him that she will brook no argument here.
‘Hey,’ he says, and glances back at Narcissa, gesturing to the window. ‘The storm has stopped. I think I’m up for that ride now, if you’re still interested?’
‘Spell wouldn’t hold,’ Ron says. ‘We couldn’t…’ he erupts into a fit of coughing, unable to continue.
. The lights, the decorations, the snow, the laughter. When one is a witch or wizard, finding the magic in any moment is usually taken for granted, but not her boy. No, Draco
Another explosion rocks the street, and Severus is half thrown from the storefront from the force of it. He throws a hand up instinctively, protecting his face from the shower of glass as the windows shatter, though he barely hears the sound, being half deafened by the sound of the blast.
Her presentation is short and efficient (as all Susan’s work is), and—judging by the pleased smile on Professor Burbage’s face, her description of a device that “allows Muggles to communicate by voice over vast distances” is right on the money.
Draco, his whole face covered in the cute pink blush, stomps out of the room, brushing past Harry and leaving him with nothing but his guffawing laughter and the tantalising smell of coconut and lemons.
?’ Pansy asks in disgust, her nose wrinkling as she watches Potter almost choke on the food in his attempt to discourage conversation.
Severus ushers the stretcher by, his face pale as he helps manoeuvre the blood soaked boy onto the bed. 'I've stemmed the bleeding, but there was too much damage and—' he breaks off, swallowing sharply as he stares down at the boy he has vowed to protect.
Harry’s breathing is ragged and sharp, his chest heaving as he glowers at Nott. ‘“He’s okay”?’ he repeats, his voice low and guttural, his eyes behind his glasses bright with rage. ‘Does he
He grins, as if sensing her ire and finding enjoyment out of it (which, he probably does). ‘Yes,’ he says, as if Romilda isn’t even there. ‘It’ll mean having to have a conversation with Zabini, seeing as you managed to get me kicked out of Ancient Runes, but I think it’ll work.’
Tension roils through Harry, tightening his shoulders. Without turning around he says, in a voice so bitter and miserable it seems to echo through the room despite its softness, 'when has that ever mattered?'
‘Well it looks like that just leaves Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy,’ Professor Burbage says, looking over at the project table where a single item remains.
Her moral compass cringes at the thought of making a bet about one of her best friends; but on the other hand…there
‘That doesn’t matter,’ she says. ‘Look, you’ve said it yourself before. Harry hasn’t had much luck when it comes to adults, right?’
‘Harry, dear, you’re talking to the woman who raised a dragon tamer, a curse breaker, and the creators of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes,’ she says with a smile. ‘Draco Malfoy is not as troublesome as he thinks he is.’
Harry frowns. He looks at Draco. He looks back at the painting. Squints. The little boy in the painting crawls forward, squinting right back at him.
was the saviour of the world?) almost chokes on his breakfast. ‘What?’ he asks, hoarse and strained as he tries to breathe through the food he’s just inhaled. He looks up at Blaise with wide green eyes. ‘No, why would I know where Drac—Mal-Malfoy is?’
Tonks feels her pulse quicken, and she glances sharply at the keeper. The man is watching, curious, but unworried.
‘Albus,’ she says her tone pleasant and yet not quite hiding a curious uneasiness at seeing him. She flicks a hand at her door and it closes behind her. ‘What can I do for you?’
Light swims just beyond the darkness clouding his mind. Harry rises out of unconsciousness in pieces, slowly, like crawling through mud. The first thing he feels is heavy, followed by the bitter tang of smoke.
quiet. His mind starts to wander. Flashes of skin, hot breath, the smell of lemons and honey, and a warmth that pools in Harry’s insides. He shakes his head, tries to clear himself of the thoughts.
Malfoy’s brows furrowed in concentration and he chewed on his bottom lip as he fought to free himself and capture Harry in return. It was a tic of his. Something Harry had noticed now that they were sharing a room together.
Harry frowns down at the cover. ‘Potions for the catastrophic creator…what…this is a book for people who suck at potions, isn’t it?’
‘Well,’ says Professor Burbage. ‘You all did very well.’ She beams around at them all (and seems to forget that not
‘Draco,’ says Luna, reaching out to catch his arm. She casts a sideways look at Ron. ‘Don’t be mean.’
Despair so raw it almost hurts to look at flashes across Potter’s overly expressive face. Merlin, how did that boy function with emotions that severe? Theo has to look away, swallowing sharply and trying to keep the boy’s overly intense reactions from seeping under Theo’s skin like an infection.
About the way Draco and Potter watch each other every meal time. The quiet way they talk in class, sitting
They’re two corridors away from the room, and Hermione pauses, not wanting to be overheard by any of the other students in their class. She turns, eyeing the two Slytherin’s.
question. ‘Rumours?’ he repeats flatly. ‘I thought we covered rumours when you came to visit with your sister?’
He looks as if he’d rather stay, though whether out of concern for his friends or curiosity for how events would unfold, Albus isn’t sure. He taps Mr Goyle on the shoulder and gestures to the door.
The half-giant lifts her new home with ease, takes two heavy steps and sets her down in a bright ray of sunlight. More warmth flows into the tank and Blue relaxes, her scales slipping over one another as she broadens herself as much as possible to soak up the sun.
‘What’ve you done now?’ Ginny mocks furious. ‘You hit him, Ron. You bloody well hit him! I’ve half a mind to hex you into next century!’
it?’ Draco asks in a carefully controlled undertone, not looking away from Harry and the seventh year.
‘You don’t know that,’ Potter says, but Phineas sees the desperate helplessness in his expression. ‘It could work out. I don’t care about the war, or which side you’re on or any of that. I don’t…I just…’
He doesn’t tell anyone about them, and that, he knows, is his first mistake because it doesn’t take long for them to get worse.
, followed by a brief curse. Somewhere outside, a familiar voice echoes back that curse. Harry’s eyes fly open.
Harry drags both hands across his face and tilts his head back, looking up at the ceiling. He drops his hands away and says—still looking up—in a voice that is quiet and hollow and full of defeat, ‘I’m sick.’
There’s no mistaking what they’re talking about. It’s clear, from the pent up wanting coming from both boys, that there is far more than civil co-operation going on between them. Anyone with eyes should see that they’re clearly involved and Phineas wonders how no one has noticed. Of course, Malfoy is holding himself back from Potter, his arms crossed between them as if a shield to keep Potter at bay, but still, the situation is obvious.
He’s studying one of the cat portraits on her wall when she glances up at him from over her glasses and frowns.
‘Well, that’s not very nice of him,’ says Lavender stoutly, smiling in sympathy at Ron and running her hand through his hair again. ‘You’re wonderful.’
‘Romilda!’ squeals Ginny Weasley, bounding over to her, her face bright with a wide-eyed smile that Romilda has never in her five years of sharing a dorm with the girl seen directed at
Glass shatters into the quiet hum of the potions room as ingredients and tools go scattering across the table and floor, drawing the attention of every head in the room, including Hermione’s.
Potter trudges into Poppy’s office—still in his pyjamas—and slouches in the doorway. Despite the fact that he’s had dreamless sleep almost every night this week, there are dark shadows under his eyes, making his sallow face look paler than it already does. He’s taking longer to recover than last time, and though she knows it’s a sign of his advancing condition, she also can’t help but think a large part of the problem is this mood he’s entrenched himself within.
Cold sweeps through Luna, drenching her in a sudden sweat. She swallows, feeling suddenly quite faint. She reaches out for Draco’s hands, his fingers as icy as her own as grasps hold of him, sucking in a sharp breath that isn’t full enough.
‘I won’t wake him too soon, Albus. I mean it,’ she says, and suddenly she doesn’t look tired anymore. She looks fierce and determined and
He rechecks the distance and slips off the edge of the window, holding onto the ledge as long as possible to make the drop to the ground slower. He lands hard, the impact shooting up his leg and he winces. Draco sucks in a sharp breath between his teeth. He steps forward and smacks Harry upside the head.
Unfortunately, as her gaze settles back on Malfoy, she very much doubts that she’s going to get any answers here.
The table at the front of the room is filled with over a dozen different Muggle items, each varying in size, weight and colour. Hannah has seen them before, when the class first had to pick their assignments. They each got to choose one—except, of course, for Harry and Malfoy who had to share—and were tasked with finding out it’s purpose.
He gives Potter another appraising look, shakes his head, and turns to walk off to the tree—no doubt to try and coax his charge back down out of the tree.
Malfoy glowers at him, but he uncrosses his arms, snatches the shirt and stomps over to the changing room.
Severus snorts and rolls his eyes, exasperated by the entire notion of sending someone to (no doubt in his mind) pander to two teenage boys. Minerva ignores him.
‘Steady, steady now, you really shouldn't be up,’ says Poppy with the tone of a woman who isn't being heard, and she helps him reposition into a more upright posture.
I do. For Merlin’s sake, Draco, is this boy really worth risking your life? Switch sides if you must, but spying? Do you think this boy would want you to sacrifice yourself for the likes of Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter.’
topic once the others arrived) and surveys the room. There are several boxes stacked up in the corner and she raises one eyebrow, smiling as she narrows her eyes and contemplates the spell she needs. She bites the inside of her mouth, twirling her wand through the air.
As he’s doing so, Potter gets up and wanders idly toward the ingredients cupboard. The motion catches Blaise’s attention—and, he notes with satisfaction, Theo and Daphne’s (though she’s pretending not to notice)—and the three of them watch as Potter disappears into the small pantry where Draco is
under the pretence of homework. Now can’t you just shut up and just enjoy the fact that I decided to share this with you? Merlin. I’m trying to make a gesture here.’
not any better. Hermione is almost at her wits end, unable to deal with trying to mediate the awkward tension between them.
Ginny drops into the seat next to Luna, leaning forward to talk to Malfoy, her brown eyes furrowed in seriousness. ‘What’s going on with you and Harry?’
Malfoy snorts and rolls his eyes, but Tonks sees his grip (that he hasn’t yet released) tighten around Potter’s arm. A warning, no doubt.
They both turn at the same time, and Hermione steps back out of the way, watching them. They don’t quite fall in together. Ron is still looks too awkward to relax and Harry...Harry is holding back. Hermione frowns and knows that despite what Harry said, nothing has actually been resolved. She sighs and can only hope that things are better in the morning.
In an instant the chart is at her side, a quill poised at attention over the page as she casts several diagnostic charms at once.
His breathing is shallow. He starts to nod, then stops, shakes his head twice and covers his face, mumbling something under his breath. Alarm fills Ginny’s face and she reaches out for him.
He offers her a half-hearted smile of thanks and presses it to his nose, tilting his head backwards.
His face creases in pain. ’S’burning,’ he mutters, his eyes drifting around, not seeming to see any of them.
Harry glances back up again, and offers a nervous grin. ‘Guess we make a good team after all,’ he says.
Irritation burns along Deans spine, and he storms toward the two girls. Rumours claiming Harry is dating someone new are a knut a dozen—and
‘It’s been a week,’ says Pansy, still trying to draw Draco out of his book. ‘It can’t take—Potter, what the
‘The rest of you, too,’ says Ron, gesturing around the table as he takes his prize winnings from Blaise.
He sputters, staring at her through disbelieving eyes. ‘Gees,’ he says, shooting a glare that is half-hearted at best. ‘Just punch me while I’m down, why don’t you?’
‘Poppy,’ Minerva continues. ‘I leave them with you for the evening. Heal the broken bones of course, but leave them with everything else. Let it serve as an example to the younger years that this sort of violence
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. ‘Doesn’t bother me.’ He sat up, watching as Harry repaired his curtains. ‘I’ve never seen someone cast magic in their sleep before.’
Malfoy crouches and mutters something Ginny can’t hear. She reaches the door, flinging it open, her wand pointed straight down into Malfoy’s surprised face.
‘Whoa,’ says Blaise and makes to move but sparks of red fly out of the end of Theo’s wand. He freezes. ‘Theo, come on, mate. This isn’t you.’
‘Well if we’re quite done here,’ says Malfoy, brushing a stray speck of dirt off his robes. ‘I have better things to do than stand around gossiping with Gryffindors.’
Blood rushes through Ginny’s ears, her heart pounding as much in panic and worry as it is in exertion.
Dean can’t listen to anymore. He grabs the door handle and barges into the room, cutting off any further conversation between the two.
Nott treads pointedly on Zabini’s foot. Zabini winces, glaring at his friend, but cutting off. Hermione raises her eyebrows. Interesting.
There’s more smoke in the hallway outside the Room of Requirement, though Ginny can’t have been gone ten minutes. There’s a shout from within and Ginny rushes forward past McGonagall.
Most students were excited to begin, to try their hand at more rigorous magic. Most students were not Harry Potter.
The blast of fresh air nips at her nose, delightful in it’s coolness after a day of rigorous study indoors. Snow crunches under her feet and Katie feels a burst of restless energy surge through her as she heads down to the Quidditch pitch. With her NEWTs fast approaching she hasn’t been able to get in as much practice as everyone else (much to Ron’s disgust as he loudly tells her every chance he gets).
He raises one eyebrow, scoffs and looks away from her. Hermione almost wants to laugh. He’s good, she’ll give him that, but now that Luna has cracked his facade, Hermione is starting to see through his blustering.
Draco wishes he had a mirror, or maybe even a camera, so he could capture the moment and make Harry see himself the way Draco does.
Potter doesn’t respond, though there’s a rustle of clothing and Tonks has the distinct impression that he’s shrugged. Eventually he says, ‘that was the first time I ever spoke to a snake.’
Perhaps it’s the unexpected “please”, but she doesn’t berate the boy for interrupting her. ‘Why not?’
Lavender takes half a step back, pulling her arm back as if he burnt her. Conversations around them go quiet and Lavender feels her shoulders turning in again, she swallows, and tries to squash the uncomfortable feeling.
Harry concentrates on breathing evenly and tries to think about something else. Something other than
All at once, Harry’s weight is pulled free, and she comes up spluttering. Goyle, with Peakes’ help, has hauled Harry out of the water, and already the two are peeling away toward the stands.
Draco glances across at him. ‘Uh, actually, I am going to need my coat back,’ he says. He looks freezing, with his puffing breath and pink-tinted nose and bright, starry eyes ,and Harry instantly feels guilty, wrapped up in the delicious warmth of Draco’s coat.
He stares at the leaf, uncomprehending, and she gestures at him with it. He takes it from her hand, pinching it between thumb and forefinger, and staring at it as if it might bite him.
She throws him a sideways look, cocking a disbelieving eyebrow. ‘You don’t really expect me to tell you that do you? At least not until we establish the parameters of the bet.’
Draco stabs his wand at the ground and a chunk of grass and mud explodes. He’s so angry he’s shaking, his chest heaving with every breath, and he’s itching for a fight. He’s waiting for Harry to pull his wand out, to retaliate, but—for some reason—Harry deflates, all the anger washing away under the downpour of rain.
‘Did you know,’ says Luna mildly, watching the magic in the walls ripple away from her fingers like the wake of a little boat in the water. ‘That in 1735 there was a horrid fire in the south tower?’
They’re nice eyes. Always smiling. Yet with something dark lurking beneath. As if she has seen into the black. It makes the kindness in her eyes that bit sweeter.
He crosses his arms over his chest. ‘I guess,’ he says, scuffing his feet along the floor. ‘I just—what if, if I…’
‘Just so you know,’ she says, unlocking the door and stepping out into the hallway. ‘Now that I know, you have to keep me in the loop.’
I did some checking over the notes and half written chapters I have, and thought I'd let you all know that it turns out I have over thirty chapters still to go for sixth year alone. Seeing as I plan to go into seventh year as well, you'll be happy to know that there is still plenty of story to come :)
Harry’s feet slide around the ice as he’s pulled to his feet and he sucks in a breath, gripping Draco’s hand tightly to keep from falling. Their breath mingles in the cool air as they shuffle slowly back to the edge of the rink.
Worry settles in her gut, and as she opens the door she prepares to send one or both of them to the Hospital Wing. She’s already thinking of ways to punish them for whatever fight they’ve had (moving their detentions to friday nights obviously hadn’t made much of an impact) so she’s surprised when she steps into the room to find Draco Malfoy sitting at the front of the room, fingers drumming on the table top and completely alone.
Colin swallows. ‘Er,’ he coughs and clears his throat, trying not to sound so terrified. ‘Um, yes. There’s this competition and—’
‘Sorry chap,’ says Archie, turning to Potter. ‘Best not to get too familiar with Pod. He doesn’t much like it.’
He’s not even having a panic attack. Not a real one, anyway. No, this is something that she’s beginning to recognise as a normal, teenage freakout (for want of a better word). She sighs.
Someone bumps into Remus, jostling him sideways, and by the time he looks back up, Dora is gone. He looks for her flash of bright hair, but, as usual, she’s blended seamlessly into the crowd.
‘To be honest,’ says Hermione, and bites her lip, wondering if she dares say it. She sighs. ‘I think it’s the war. I think maybe Malfoy has…you know.’
it’s what Padfoot would have wanted,’ he says and though she hears the slyness to his tone, understands it for the underhanded blow that it is, it
He stares at her with his mother’s eyes, his mother’s face, imploring and hopeful and oh so young and she feels her resolve weakening. He sees it. She sees him see it.
‘Alright, Myrtle,’ says Harry. ‘We get it. I’ll come visit you, okay? Not all the time, mind. I have class, and detention, and quidditch. But I’ll…I’ll come by at least…um, once a week?’
‘Oh don’t worry,’ says a pretty girl with long brown hair, stopping outside a compartment door. ‘I’m not giving up. Harry’ll realise eventually that—‘
Also, please note that I'll be dropping down to once weekly updates as of Monday for the duration of April - just until camp NaNoWriMo is done - then I'll pick back up to twice a week come May.
Of course neither of the occupants of the room notice his entrance (they never do), and he peers out, surprised to see a familiar flash of blond.
At lunch, she watches as Malfoy and Harry make their way into the Great Hall, straggling in after their joint Care of Magical Creatures.
Malfoy, to Neville’s shock, is grinning. ‘Look at that, I think I actually improved your looks,’ he says.
Malfoy shakes his head, glares again, and sighs. ‘Fine. So maybe I was worried. Maybe I kissed you and maybe you looked more pathetic than a kicked puppy last night that I had no choice but to come keep you company lest you fell into a coma or something and they blamed me. But if you want the truth, the truth is that this is never going to work. That we’re too different, and you’re too—what’re you—mfph.’
Poppy watches him, her foot tapping lightly as she decides what to do. ‘You did well,’ she ventures, keeping her voice from being too enthusiastic.
Harry surges forward, grabbing Draco by his stupidly nice-looking turtleneck sweater, yanking him forward and kissing him on his stupidly nice-looking mouth.
Cold, sharp fear spikes up Harry’s spine. Something coils in his stomach, the whole world freezing in place as the panic that’s been building in Harry’s chest lashes out.
‘He thinks they’re wonderful too,’ says Potter in a soft voice. ‘They’re smart, and funny, and can love to talk…or, at least that’s what I’ve heard.’
A slow grin works it’s way onto Harry’s face. ‘See you at seven,’ he says, and he turns and saunters out of the room, feeling entirely
A faint chuckle comes from the door, and Draco looks up, ready to send whoever it is away with a sharp worded insult or two, only to stop when he sees Harry leaning on the doorway—watching him with that stupid smile and those stupid eyes and that stupid way his mouth quirks up.
Potter nods. Shrugs. Blushes. ‘Come on, be a good sport,’ he says. ‘I want to get one and it’s no fun doing it alone.’
Neville turns back to the greenhouse spread out before him, beaming so wide he wonders that it doesn’t split his face. Pride swells in his chest, and—with renewed confidence—he heads into his new domain, sure that nothing will top this night (it’s oddities and all) in quite some time.
‘It’s been a few nights since I’ve done a proper dessert. What do you think, Harry, should I make a pudding? Or perhaps some brownies? What do you think your Mr Malfoy would enjoy?’
Theo sighs loudly. ‘You know,’ he says. ‘If you’re planning on suffocating yourself there are more effective—and less disruptive—ways of doing it.’
He does hate him. He hates him for all the nasty things he’s ever said about Ron’s family. All the digs at how poor they are, or how pathetic. He hates him for everything that happened to Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets, for ruining her first year at Hogwarts. He hates him for all the small-minded, nasty things he’s said about Hermione.
The pent up frustration is driving him mad, and he wanders around the castle, barely paying attention to where he’s going and wishing desperately that the quidditch season had started already.
Professor Slughorn comes bustling over to their table. ‘Now, now Mr Malfoy, whilst a regrettable outcome, it’s not worth such language,’ he says, pulling out his wand and giving it a swift flick.
Malfoy frowns, a scowl flitting into place, and Neville swears he sees a hint of disappointment in the expression. ‘Damn,’ he says, and he’s looking back down the hallway again, as if Harry will just magically appear there. ‘If you see him, tell him I’m looking for him.’
‘Well, normally he can’t wait to tell everyone how he humiliated Potter, but this time he hasn’t said a word.’
Severus arches one brow, but neither confirms nor denies the accusation. ‘What will you tell the Dark Lord when you fail to complete your task?’ he asks instead. ‘I assume if you’re helping Albus Dumbledore you no longer have any intention of killing him?’
Draco sits up, throwing the pillow aside and glowering at Theo. ‘If I wanted an expert opinion on how to off myself I’d ask you,’ he snarls in a particularly cutting voice. ‘But for now I’d prefer if you’d kindly mind your own fucking business.’
Instead of retaliating, Potter glances back at Malfoy with a bright grin and races after Hagrid, disappearing into a stone, domed circular building on the edge of the park.
Potter, leaning on the wall just outside the door, looks up, and Greg has just enough time to see Potter’s face light up as Draco steps out, to hear Draco’s quiet ‘I told you to
Harry, now panting against the far wall, the built up magic expelled and absorbed—the wall serving it’s intended purpose just as Poppy had said—looks physically (not to mention emotionally) exhausted. Albus feels a little of his doubt fade away, assured that his confidence in Poppy is not misplaced, and that she indeed has Harry’s situation in hand as he had suspected. Confident more so that his investment in the young Malfoy Heir is the right course of action.
Harry nods, though tension rolls through his shoulders. ‘Sure,’ he says. ‘Why don’t you show me what you have so far.’
Bellatrix staggers backwards, but her appearance does not change. Potter winces. He readjusts his stance, closing his eyes for a moment and counting inaudibly. When he opens his eyes, he looks steadier—if a little paler—and raises his wand again.
‘Are you sure you won’t stay?’ asks Pete, gesturing with a pot of what she can only assume is the sweet tea.
Something shifts in Draco’s expression. Some strange mix of determination, fear and longing. At first Severus doesn’t understand it, but Draco drops his eyes away and something in Severus’s gut clenches.
she understands why he’s avoiding Ron. It’s one thing for Harry to admit that he’s gay, but there is no way Ron wouldn’t struggle with the idea that Harry might already have a boyfriend.
Hermione turns, ready to intervene if Ron flies off the handle, but he only frowns at Malfoy watching with a mixture of uncertainty and confusion. Hermione reaches over and squeezes his hand, giving him an encouraging smile. He glances at her, offering her a tight smile in return, but he keeps hold of her hand and a small burst of warmth spreads through her.
‘You think I’m happy about this? I didn’t mean to hit him, okay? He was walking away and I thought it was Malfoy who grabbed me. I’d have never have intentionally hit
Malfoy rolls his eyes. ‘Of course he didn’t,’ he mutters. He shakes his head and says, ‘Look, the point is that Potter knows exactly who and what I am, and now, so do you. So, what else do I have to do, to get you to accept a truce.’
Blaise chuckles. ‘Really, Pans. Just because he won’t shag you doesn’t mean he’s off screwing around somewhere else,’ he says, pushing off from the wall. ‘Some of us have standards, you know.’
Draco mutters something about show-offs and wandless magic. Harry shoots him a grin. He thrusts a potion at the kid and pushes away from the desk.
Worry flashes over his face. ‘I dunno,’ he says, glancing back over his shoulder. ‘They’ve gone to the Hospital Wing.’
He considers saying no. He’s still agitated. Still wants to fight. But there’s a small (growing) part of him that is also relieved that Harry is
‘I want—’ Malfoy stops, sighs, and looks up at the ceiling. ‘How is that every time we talk we just end up arguing?’
reason to disappear—more than likely attempting to reenact the photo that was the purpose of the group’s meeting.
Harry chuckles and shakes his head. ‘He’s never going to let me live this down,’ he says, and runs a hand through his hair. ‘Hell, he’s never going to let me see that bloody photo. Stupid git.’
Something shifts in the air as the tension within the Speaker grows into something coiling and angry.
Despite the surrealness of the last ten minutes, Neville finds himself smiling. ‘Thanks, Harry. I am.’
Harry blinks. ‘You want to—Malfoy, bloody hell it’s the middle of the night and you want to talk about homework?
Something crinkles and at last, Theodore sees it. The small, brown paper wrapped parcel. He reaches for it but stops just shy of touching it, remembering his father’s warnings.
don’t know where he went,’ she says, prodding at his chest. ‘I, on the other hand, know more than either of you think.’
Pansy Parkinson lounges in the doorway of the second compartment, and gives Hermione a high arched sniff of superiority. Hermione rolls her eyes and ignores her.
They go through three more presentations with Professor Burbage smiling and nodding along. They all pass.
He grins at her and it almost seems genuine. ‘You’re welcome,’ he says, and then turns to Ginny. ‘Where are you sitting?’
Draco grunts, but doens’t offer any explanation. Blaise shrugs and decides to snoop amongst the items that have spilled out of Draco’s bag. Several books, some notes and a strange little black box have scattered themselves across the table. Blaise frowns and picks up the small, rectangular box, except there is a wire attached. He gives it a curious tug, and the thing comes loose. The wire splits into two, coming to an end with two strange little rubbery buds on the end.
Taking a quick look outside the store front, Severus sees the four hooded figures have split up. Two are engaged in a vicious duel with three red-robed aurors, the third is halfway down the street exchanging hexes with a pink-haired witch that can only be Nymphadora Tonks, and the forth is missing.
Except, when Potter lands before them (a windswept mess), there is no anger or frustration in his face. Only a burning intensity that Draco can’t read.
Draco scowls at the empty hallway in front of him as he stomps toward Gryffindor tower, unsure yet what he’s going to do when he gets there, but half tempted to blast his way through their portrait door and demand to know where the hell his idiot Gryffindor has gotten too. He’s checked everywhere else. The library, the astronomy tower, all their secret nooks and alcoves, hell he’s even checking in with Myrtle, but his wayward Gryffindor is nowhere to be found.
Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He exhales slowly and when he opens his eyes again his expression is lighter. Without his glasses obscuring his face, Harry’s eyes look greener, bigger, making him less like the undaunted hero and more like a boy.
‘Fuck I don’t know, because you Slytherin’s get a kick out of making people beg? Come on just, grow a heart and tell us what you know. I’ll pay you if that’s what it takes.’
Dora grins at him and shakes her head. ‘Ah, Remus,’ she’s says. ‘Remus, Remus, Remus. Maybe you’re older than me, maybe you’re more experienced, and yet, you still have so much to learn.’
‘Security is intact. No damage to any of the wards that I can see,’ says Kingsley in that stoic manner of is.
His gaze shifts away from her and for a moment she thinks he’s going to give her the brush off. He shrugs his shoulders up to his ears, shivering away the cold, and says in a low voice partially muffled by his scarf,
Draco tries to snatch the book back, but Potter leans back, jerking the book out of reach. ‘Fascinating as this depressing tale is, Potter,’ Draco growls. ‘I want my book back.’
Clearly December to February are just not good writing months for me. To make matters worse, I went from two days of work to five in January (more than doubling my work hours) and it took a little longer than I expected to adjust back to full time work. I'm still finding it hard to balance work, life, health and kids and somehow squeeze writing time into my schedule - but I am working on it.
‘Well, sure,’ says Blaise with an easy smile, shrugging as if he doesn’t spend most of his time these days lounging around the common room.
‘I’m going for a walk,’ he says, and with that said, he turns and trudges off without waiting for a reply.
Potter winces, dropping his gaze back to the floor and muttering something vaguely apologetic. Malfoy, on the other hand, is still outraged. He stares between Minerva and Potter with a horrified expression.
Malfoy smirks, then shakes himself (as if realising that he doesn’t find Potter funny) and flicks Potter a glare, ‘I don’t
It seems, in the absence of Harry, Ron has thrown himself even further into the disgusting display of snogging he calls a relationship. Hermione wrinkles her nose and attempts to block them out.
‘Yeah,’ says Blaise, but he’s staring at Draco with that calculative gaze, and Theo feels dread settle into his stomach.
‘Oh leave him alone, Pans,’ barks Blaise, sighing heavily. ‘Honestly. I already told you that he stormed out an hour ago. We don’t know where he went or what the problem was. He wasn’t exactly in a
This turned out to be a lot longer than I intended; still not sure how I feel about how it turned out, but I hope you enjoy it :)
Malfoy drags Potter to the exit without answering. He’s shaking his head, clearly exasperated. Hagrid, with a quick, nervous smile to the Keeper, follows.
There’s an odd flush to his skin beneath the bruising on his face, and Harry’s desperation is growing. He looks at Ginny, gaze imploring and understanding washes over her.
Her legs twitch with the urge to move over to him, her hands clenching against the temptation to administer a calming drought or to take his vitals. She takes a long, slow, even breathe and reminds herself again that he needs this.
She steps up next to Ron, curling her fingers through the cuff of his robe as she leans around his arm to read.
‘I’m not betraying my—you know what? No. I’m not doing this. I don’t have to explain myself to you. I love my mother, I would never hurt her.’
He’s left to stalk about the house in this manner for another hour before he hears the knock on the front door.
He has his hands in the boy’s hair, messing up the slicked back strands, as he presses their mouths together once, twice, three times. One of them groans. The blond pulls away, but only for a moment, and Harry is pulling him back, muttering, ‘don’t stop,’ against his lips, swallowing up any chance of protest.
Two thestrals stand at the edge of the clearing, tearing into a hunk of meat. The flock is growing and Hagrid is proud to show them off to the students, but he’s missing the usual glow of warmth that comes with showing off these misunderstood creatures to his students.
Two students step out from behind Hagrid. They almost look like brothers. Both are sandy haired, brown eyed and adorned in Hufflepuff colours. Still, whoever did the spellwork on their glamours didn’t do focus too hard on changing their faces, other than hiding Potter’s scar.
She pushes out into the hall, a smirk settling into place at the thought of what she could do with this information.
The blush spreads across Harry’s cheeks, and Draco leans over to press a soft kiss against his warm cheek.
He rolls his eyes, glancing off to the side and muttering under his breathe, every bit the petulant teenager. ‘Can’t I have a few more days?’
‘I still can’t banish her, though,’ he says and swipes a hand over his face, leaning back on the bed.
‘Harry was raised by muggles,’ Luna reminds him, pulling the book on erumpent properties off the shelf. ‘He’s probably never seen an erumpent.’
Figuring out how to keep the leaf in his mouth will require patience and finesse, both of which were things he will have to learn if he has any hope at managing his Curse.
He grasped Draco’s shoulders, returning Draco’s smirk with one of his own, feeling a flush of warmth and embarrassment and fear and desire burning through his skin and letting it spur him on.
‘Shirking your responsibilities as usual, Malfoy?’ Ron says, pausing just outside the compartment to give Malfoy a disgusted look.
?’ asks Ron, shaking his head. ‘I don’t understand. You…you fought for this. You wanted to be with him. Why break up with him now? This isn’t because of
Draco’s fingers slide along the spines with a whispering noise. He hums, his fingers stilling on one notebook that is a little thicker than the rest. After some wedging back and forth, the book comes free, expanding into a thick tome as wide as Luna’s fist.
’So,’ says Ginny, gaze flickering up to Harry with entirely too much innocence. ‘How’s potions practice going?’
She’s mapped out the pattern in Potter’s symptoms (the pattern that has been niggling at the back of her mind ever since Draco Malfoy revealed the events of Diagon Alley). The magical outbursts, his lack of control, even his panic attacks, they all lead to the same thing.
Draco blinks. He stares at Eric and knows suddenly that nothing this boy has to say will make anything better. Not Draco, not Harry, not this whole
Draco’s mental defence is at least good enough for him to notice Severus’ presence, but the flimsy defence he puts up is pathetic and crumbles easily under Severus’ will.
Professor Burbage sighs, and glances over at Zach with an odd little half smile. ‘Perhaps you should finish your presentation another time, Zach. After you’ve done more research.’
It’s as if the air itself takes on the taste of despair. It’s bitter and tangy, and it leaves Luna feeling wretched and exhausted. A feeling of foreboding spreads through her, and she shivers, the cold gripping her with clawed hands.
Most of all, though, it’s his lack of wonder. There’s no delight in his face as he watches a train trundle through the air above the dinning room table. No spark of appreciation at the intricate scenes of Christmas wonderlands depicted in the frosting on the windows.
Instead of the usual pristine uniform that Draco normally wears, he’s in a loose fitted, untucked t-shirt and a pair of wrinkled slacks. His hair, which is normally perfectly coiffed, falls around his face in messy strands. Despite all this, it’s the look of complete and utter panic flashing across his face that has Harry abandoning the armour completely and standing up.
Harry inhaled deeply through his nose. He held it for a moment, before pushing all the air out of his lungs in a long steady exhale. He nodded.
know this? Surely it’s not something they go around advertising or every student in Ravenclaw would be there clawing their way in to find their marks. Not to mention Hermione.’
Black fury wells in Ron’s gut. He wants Harry to pull away. To punch Malfoy. To tell him to back off.
Brown nods and Theo breathes a small sigh of relief as Patil walks away. His biggest obstacle bounds out of the room on the tails of most their classmates.
Remus shifts awkwardly in his seat. ‘So,’ he says uncomfortably. ‘You think the new ally is a student?’
‘Please,’ says the boy, leaning forward again. ‘Even if you could just take a look at my wand work and give me some advice.’
‘I suppose that’s true,’ says Hermione. ‘Though, I didn’t realise you’d be inviting her, or anyone else, today.’
‘If he does or he doesn’t I don’t care,’ says Harry. ‘I’ve been patient enough. He’s made his choice.’
He drops kisses along Harry’s jaw, nibbles on his ear, sucks softly on a patch of skin that he now knows is particularly sensitive.
She’s too tired to protest. Leaving them to it, she turns her broom and searches for a place to land. By the time she gets to the stands, Harry and Malfoy are already gone.
That same flash of darkness crosses his face and Tonks instantly regrets her choice of words. She didn’t mean
‘Fae?’ asks Zabini raising his eyebrows. ‘I hope you’re not suggesting that this is a Fae curse. Because that would be bad.’
Which is mostly true. Although, he’d give almost anything to be out of this situation right now, but he has a feeling that’s not an option.
‘Okay,’ he mutters softly to himself and runs his hands through his already damp hair. ‘Okay. It’s okay. You can handle this. It was just a kiss. Albeit it’s
‘Why d’you wanna talk to her?’ asks Ron, nonplussed, as if he can’t understand why Harry might want to talk about anything other than Harry’s supposed fight with Malfoy.
Hagrid stands to one side, regaling the boys with a story (accompanied by huge hand gestures that about knock over other surrounding patrons) about the erumpents. Potter watches the creature intently, his head half turned as he listens to Hagrid, but Malfoy is clearly not paying attention. He stands side on, leaning one hip on the rail, watching Potter rather than the creature they’ve come all this way to see.
She notes, with some amusement, that he’s gravitated toward his usual bed, and considers that a sign that he is, at least, still mostly in control of his faculties.
Ron grimaces. Great. The Slytherin team was here. Ron sighs and contemplates coming back later, but the only thing worse than dealing with the Slytherins was having one of them find his wand.
‘Potter,’ she says again, and stops, because how can she tell him that he isn’t allowed to be a normal teenager.
Harry’s shoulders turn inward. ‘I don’t, um, I’ve never…god this is humiliating.’ He drops his face into his hands and blurts. ‘I don’t wank.’
Surprise makes Molly still, and she glances back over her shoulder toward the family room. Harry is standing in the middle of the room, green eyes wide with shock and surprise as he stares after the young Malfoy.
—again, hands tightening around Draco’s waist and never before has Draco wanted to ditch out on anything more than he wants to ditch out on Quidditch practice right now.
Molly hides a smile. ‘You like him a lot, don’t you?’ she says. Her sorrow (a familiar companion now, rather than a constant ache) steps aside and allows her to take joy from Harry’s now-obvious crush.
Potter glances around the room, eyes trailing over the last group to leave the room. Once the door swings shut, he leans forward over the observation rail and peers into one of the tanks. He opens his mouth, but no words come out, instead a soft whisper of hissing slips through the air.
‘Oh of course, blame the Slytherins,’ she sneers. ‘Honestly, you’re pathetic. I can’t believe you’re taking it this far. He’s your best friend!’
. Ginny stifles a surprised laugh and makes a mental note to find out who is holding that rumoured bet about Harry and Malfoy being friends. She’s got her eye on a new broom after all, and if what she’s seeing is any indication, than she has this bet in the bag.
‘I didn’t say it was,’ says Malfoy, and he turns that sharp blue gaze back on Neville. ‘Well? What do you want?’
The keeper flushes. ‘It’s not what you think,’ he says hurriedly. ‘Just…I’ve heard he’s a parseltongue.’
Pansy smirks, knowing she’s got him. Jealousy has never been something Draco is very good at dealing with.
‘I’m sorry,’ says Malfoy. ‘We still have Blue, and I doubt Myrtle will let us out of our arrangement so we’ll see each other there, and there’s class, so—‘
A shiver runs through Draco, tracing down his arm, through their joined hands and transferring to her. His fingers tighten around her hand as he takes a steadying breath. Outwardly he seems calmer, but Luna knows that even the most stoic of Slytherin’s often hide the turmoil raging within, and she thinks she can see a glimpse of it in the depths of his storm blue eyes.
Books and notes and soil samples spill everywhere, cascading down the steps and scattering across the floor. He curses. He curses again. Then he blushes at his own use of the rather colourful language.
And that’s when Hermione’s hunch pays off. Whatever guilt had been plaguing Harry pops like a balloon.
Zabini keeps pace with her, his breathing even and matched with his stride, while Goyle puffs along behind them, his footsteps heavy and laboured. The sounds blur together into a backdrop to her mantra.
In truth, McGonagall had merely raised an eyebrow at Harry’s absence, no doubt having heard the rumours already.
How is it that Draco Malfoy can care enough to be worried about Harry being upset, but Lavender’s own boyfriend can’t bother to care about
The keeper waved his hand in dismissal. ‘Nonsense,’ he says. ‘I’m always happy to have people stay a little longer.’ He glances over the group. ‘You’re from Hogwarts aren’t you?’
‘Sorry to break this up,’ says Malfoy, stepping forward to grab Potter’s arm again. ‘But like he said, we only have an hour or so left, so we best keep going.’
Ron shrugs. ‘Hey, a title is a title. And anyway, the girls are going nuts over it. You know at least three chicks asked me about you today? Even despite the way you bumbled through the whole day.’
By now, a significant portion of the table is eavesdropping and Blaise relishes in the irritated glare Granger is not-so-surreptitiously shooting his way. Well, if she didn’t want him goading information out of Potter she should’ve been more explicit with the specifics of their bet. As it is though, teasing Potter into tripping up is fair play.
‘It’s fine,’ says the Speaker, yanking down his shirt again. Red stains the front of his shirt. ‘It’s not that bad.’
Draco sweeps water off his face and stares at the wall between him and Potter. ‘Bullshit,’ says Draco. ‘You’re telling me you’ve gone your whole Hogwarts career without running into someone in the showers?’
He stumbles, and almost falls, but the blond is there with a steadying hand, keeping him upright. Harry shrugs him off.
Kingsley’s eyes—which hadn’t even blinked at the term “boyfriend”—widen imperceptibly. The man was plain unflappable. ‘Well,’ he says,
Harry seems to hesitate. He looks down at the vial in his hands as if he’s unsure what to do with it.
‘Maybe…maybe there’s something I can do,’ says Malfoy, and trails one hand down from Potter’s shoulder to grasp at his wrist. ‘To stop them from hurting you. Or—’
Draco greets his mare with a soft smile, rubbing the side of her face and pressing his face close to her neck. ‘Hello Winnie,’ he says in a low, pleased voice. ‘How are you today?’
Draco leans up on his elbow. ‘Harry, honestly how many times do I have to tell you. I’ll do whatever you want. Whatever you feel comfortable doing, whenever you’re comfortable doing it. You’re mine…but also, I’m yours.’
Albus doesn’t look appeased, but seems to realise he’s loosing the battle. Minerva has learnt to read the subtleties of his expressions, to note when the benevolence is an act and when he truly knows something others do not. In this instance, Minerva is almost sure that there’s something bothering him he doesn’t want them to know about. She frowns.
The door bursts opens before Harry can shout anything back and Hermione walks in, her eyes wide in that way she gets when she’s both worried and frustrated.
Startled, he turns to see Harry’s expression change from pale-faced horror, to fury. Sparks flicker around his hands and, just in time, Albus conjures a shield between the boys as Harry lets loose a snarl of rage and flings a spell at his classmate.
Except, he realises with a scowl, his wand is lying on the bench beneath his clothes and no matter how proficient he’s become at wandless and wordless magic, performing both simultaneously isn’t in Draco skillset.
Potter tilts his head. ‘I don’t think I could do it again. I definitely don’t think I could do it at will.’
He slides into his seat and Blaise is relieved to see that he at least managed to find the ingredients that need replacing before he and Potter ruined the storage cupboard.
Draco stuffs his hands into his pockets, still looking skeptical. He glances up at the early morning sky, his nose pink. ‘Alright,’ he says, shaking himself. ‘Let’s get moving.’
Draco frowns. Something squirms in his gut and his heart starts to thump painfully in his chest. He turns away, not wanting Potter to see him so unnerved, and leaves Potter and his stupid knowing gaze behind in the bathroom. Still, he can’t escape it. Potter’s words
‘It’s a children’s story,’ says Malfoy. ‘A scare tactic from parents to stop their children from playing with magic before they’ve learnt control. To stop them from exhausting themselves. In the story, if you get the curse…’ he takes a deep breath and looks up at Hermione. ‘You don’t just lose your magic. You die.’
‘Mr Malfoy,’ Professor Burbage sighs for the umpteenth time in several weeks, pausing mid lecture to look imploringly over at the blond.
When she turns back around, two drinks in hand, she sees that Harry has once again been cornered, this time by a tall, busty brunette Ginny recognises. She sighs and rolls her eyes. Romilda Vane. As vain as her last name implies and as equally vapid. Harry is leaning away from her, looking far more terrified than he has any right to be.
‘Er, nothing,’ comes the voice—Greg, he thinks—from just outside his curtains. ‘Just…sounded like you were having a nightmare.’
The night air is cool and crisp and Neville winds his way around the side of the castle, so excited he has to take extra care not to trip and fall on his face. Not that he’d care if he did. For the first time he feels like even falling won’t stop him. He’s full to bursting with pride.
Greg shrugs at Blaise. Blaise jerks his head toward Draco. Greg shakes his head and points back at Blaise. Blaise makes a face and mouths “best friend”, pointing at Greg. Greg glowers.
Harry runs a hand through his hair, glancing away. ‘You’ve pretty much got it. I’m not sure what else I can do to help.’
The boy, a Ravanclaw, looks up in surprise. Malfoy shoves the boy hard, his palms slamming into his chest and sending him tumbling backwards. Malfoy scrambles backwards and to his feet just as three more Ravenclaw’s round the corner to join the first.
‘I suppose, being so close to him as you are, you know all about his interests. The type of people he’s dated in the past.’
‘Well, who cares about him anyway? How about tomorrow we go do something fun to take your mind of it?’
‘What happened?’ asks Potter. ‘At Christmas. What happened that changed your mind. Can’t you at least tell me that?’
Scars adorn them both. Just a few months ago, touching those scars himself brought back memories of pain and terror. Now, though? Now he has new memories. Memories that fill him with fire and wanting, and he relishes in each new touch, each new sensation drowning out all the past.
Potter’s face twitches. The briefest flash of exasperation crossing his features before being swallowed up by the sheer exhaustion still clinging to his body.
Ginny stares at him. Inside she’s dancing, but for now, there’s a wild, freaked out storm of emotions playing out across Harry’s face, so she takes a deep breath, sits him down on the edge of his bed and stands calmly before him.
is gone, their own feelings of affection—whether romantic,’ she gestures at Harry and Ron, ‘or simply friendship,’ she points at Ginny, ‘are more pronounced. They may be acting unusually affectionate, yes, but this comes from a genuine emotion.’
She hears the Infirmary door burst open from two rooms away. Marking her place in the book she’s researching, she tucks it and her notes safely away in a draw before casting a soft, but strong locking charm and heading out into the infirmary.
She can’t help it. As he pushes out of the compartment with Neville on his heel, she thinks of Malfoy, and the similar way he had looked at her.
Not when Theo was certain all the evidence he needed to bring Draco down lay on his left forearm. The real question was, could he? Draco was a self-involved, conceited asshole, sure, but they had been friends for years. Since before Hogwarts. He’d stayed at Malfoy Manor more times than he could count and Draco, for all his faults, had never pried into the reasons Theo showed up unannounced to stay for days at a time. There were plenty of people who would call Draco spoilt, and they wouldn’t be wrong, but for all the things he owned, he’d never had a problem sharing them with Theo. From toys when they were little, to books and quills and, on occasion, his clothes. Draco was frivolous and ridiculous. But he wasn’t a bad person.
He turns and trudges out toward the castle side exit and Draco watches him go. Emotions swirl through him. Confusion, irritation, worry, arousal.
