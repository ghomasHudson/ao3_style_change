Harry glanced around, feeling foolish. He hadn’t realized there were reporters. He took a step towards Malfoy, annoyed. “You
In a small study off the main hall, there was Malfoy, his shirtsleeves rolled up, re-framing a wall that looked like it had blown out in a serious explosion. It looked like hard work, Malfoy’s back muscles straining as he maneuvered the lumber, even using magic.
“He seemed alright,” Hermione said, “less twitchy and terrified than last summer. I don’t think I’ve seen him since the trials. I didn’t know you were in touch with him.”
Malfoy reached for his sheet music and turned the page. “How would you have known?” He wore a short-sleeved button-down shirt, the sort that Muggles might wear in summer, and his forearms were exposed. He started to play again, and Harry watched the corded muscle, transfixed.
Harry shook his head and turned back to Ginny and Luna, who thankfully hadn’t noticed anything. They dragged him off to find something to drink and then to dance badly to covers of 80s pop. Hermione and Ron joined them, and they found George and Angelina, who made a valiant attempt at teaching them how to dance properly when the band switched over to swing. Harry danced with Parvati for a while, who told him he hadn’t improved at all, but didn’t seem to mind. Then Hermione cut in laughing, saying he couldn’t be worse than Ron, who had given up entirely. Ginny and Dean were the stars though, picking it up quickly, their movements fast and joyful, slotting perfectly together.
In the days following Teddy’s rescue, time passed slowly. Harry felt on edge like he hadn’t since the war, waiting for the other shoe to drop. He spent a lot of time at Andromeda’s holding Teddy, keeping him occupied with bright plastic muggle toys, and letting him drool on his shoulder as much as he liked. Harry kept thinking he might see Draco, maybe at Andromeda’s, or anywhere really.
“Oi, Harry! Tell Malfoy to piss off and bring some of those back for us!” Ron was shouting from across the dance floor, gesturing at the water.
“Harry, you made it out of your closet! I like the look!” Ron winked at him. He had been ready for ages, squabbling with Ginny over the record player, and mixing horrific cocktails from the nicer, simpler drinks Ginny was making. He wore a Muggle tuxedo that he’d had professionally tailored with money from their Order of Merlin prizes. “The Yule Ball was scarring mate; I’m never wearing wizarding formal wear again if I can help it. But this…” Ron did a bit of a twirl. “I can get behind.”
“Well, stop sneaking around. It’s like school. I could swear you were following me again.” Malfoy looked guarded in the dim lighting.
The room was too warm. Harry wondered if Malfoy and Ernie MacMillan had always been on first name terms. He opened his mouth to ask, and then realized that Ernie’s hand was inching upwards, and forgot the question. Malfoy flushed all the way down to his pirate shirt, but he just smirked and said, “I think she’ll come for the party anyway.”
there. But Hermione was nodding along and saying something about preservation of the site of centuries of magical history, seeming unaffected.
“Mmm, not likely, I never sleep with fans, too strange,” Harry said, as if this wasn’t, stroking a line down the curve of Malfoy’s spine. His whole body was heavy with satisfaction and sleep, and he let it pull him under. He woke up once in the night, in a cold sweat, unable to remember what he had been dreaming about. Malfoy still lay beside him, breathing deeply and undisturbed. His first instinct was to get up, get away from Malfoy, the terrible clammy feeling seemingly tied to his presence in the room. Contemplating where he might go, Harry watched the rise and fall of Malfoy’s chest, steady and calm, until his own heart stopped racing, sleep dragging him under again.
After he finished, and Cato shooed him from the dishes, Harry heard music floating in from another wing of the house. He followed the sound until he found Malfoy in a small sitting room, playing the piano. He stood in the doorway listening, watching Malfoy’s hands as they moved deftly across the keys. After a moment, the music stopped.
Harry didn’t know what to say. He hadn’t paid much attention to the terms of Malfoy’s probation. He also hadn’t paid much attention to the rebuilding effort at Hogwarts. He’d gone to the first meeting, done the walk-through to survey the extent of the damage and McGonagall had taken one look at his stricken expression, and sent him home. She’d promised him he’d done more than enough and recommended a stiff drink.
“Of course,” Dedalus said warmly, “I think you should feel free to explore. We’ll meet you on the patio when we break for lunch.”
“I don’t think Draco will be there anyways. I’m meeting Dedalus to go over some research we’ve been doing into magical homes.” Hermione reached across and snagged Harry’s drink, taking a sip. “You might be interested in what we’ve been finding, if you think you might stay here long term.”
“You want to know what I think of the gardens?” Harry asked, darting a look at Hermione, who just shrugged and smiled.
Harry couldn’t tell if the question was mocking or genuine. “What, and have Michael Corner’s sloppy seconds?”
Afterwards, Malfoy lay on top of Harry for a moment. He propped himself up on his elbows and smoothed the hair out of Harry’s eyes, running his thumb down the scar just above them. Falling back onto the mattress, Malfoy laughed a little wild huff and turned away. Harry was exhausted. The thought of leaving the bed seemed impossible. He dipped a hand experimentally in the neat little puddle on his abdomen, trying to muster the energy to find his wand. Without warning, a strange sensation came over him, like a
“Malfoy-- er, I didn’t expect to see you. We were told you were away.” Harry forced himself to look Malfoy in the eye, dragging his gaze upwards.
“It was part of my sentencing,” Malfoy said quietly, face and neck now positively red. “Helping with the repair work at Hogwarts. It was simpler to use some of the resources here, while the more extensive structural work was done at the castle. And Longbottom has just been helping because, you know, he’s Longbottom.”
A window was open to the east and the sun shone through setting Draco aglow in the dim study. “Well then.” Draco stepped forward, took Harry’s hand and pressed it to his lips.
They wandered through the rows of plants, some humming or snapping, most just waving gently in the still, humid air. Pansy asked Neville the proper names for everything saying, “You don’t mind, do you? It’s only that I’ve forgotten since last time...” her neatly manicured fingers resting gently above his elbow. Harry considered Malfoy’s elbows. They were exposed in the heat, and the skin just below the crease of his left elbow still marred with the faded dark mark. If the rest of Draco had become bulky with muscle, his joints remained fine, dainty even. Harry thought of Malfoy nimbly maneuvering their bodies in the guest bed until they clicked into place. He thought Malfoy at the piano, his fingers a graceful contrast with the strength in his forearms, and their harsh whispers reaffirming their long-held hatred, probably a lie already.
On the manicured lawn at Malfoy Manor, Harry took deep breaths and focused on a ladybug, crawling up a blade of grass. He pictured Ron, then Hermione, Ginny, Teddy, and Andromeda, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, each of them safe and going about their daily routine, his heart rate slowing with time. After a while, the ladybug flew off, and he followed it, down to a path that wound its way through a marsh, following a stream through natural grassland and wildflowers, a small valley in the verdant rolling hills where the Manor was situated.
“Draco Malfoy is engaged?” Harry felt blank for a moment and then that hot shock of possessiveness flared up again. He wondered if Ernie MacMillan knew.
Later, when she was napping again, Harry went and found Cato in the kitchen. The elf looked up and said, “Nothing to worry about from me, Mr. Potter,” and went back to work without another word. Harry supposed that was reassurance enough. It was more than he deserved, really, getting caught necking his school rival in the foyer of someone else's home.
“Shouldn’t you just be glad I’m not trying to win back your girlfriend?” Harry said, only half joking, backing out of the room.
The joist Malfoy was levitating dropped to the floor, his back stiffening. After a beat, he answered shortly. “Staying with friends.”
“Maybe he’ll teach you,” Hermione said sweetly, her eyebrows raised. Harry thought he was being teased, but he couldn’t be sure. Honestly, he could never really be sure what the hell was happening where Malfoy was concerned these days. “Look, you can ask him now.” She nudged Harry and pointed towards a set of French doors that opened onto the patio from the Manor, Malfoy coming through. He had dressed in a linen shirt, open at the throat, pressed grey trousers, and loafers without socks, giving a flash of delicate ankle as he crossed the limestone. His hair was still damp and curling at his collar. Harry’s palms itched.
“Rivers and streams actually,” Malfoy mumbled. He did a surreptitious cleaning charm on himself and the floor, then crossed the room to the door, stopped and reached an arm out. “I…” he faltered, blushing. Harry waited, but Malfoy just turned and left.
“Never thought about what? Swimming?” Hermione turned to face Harry, and his face went hot. She looked annoyed, then resigned. “He probably learned as a kid, I feel like most people do.”
“Last year, in winter, when Greyback had killed someone very important, although to be honest, I couldn’t tell you who, I’ve certainly blocked it all out by now--”
“Insolent boy!” Greengrass shouted, gripping the bannister, swaying from the force of her anger. “You must tell me at once, has Draco Malfoy promised himself to you?”
“With Sprout yeah, but I think I would have noticed if he had said that he was also working with Malfoy.” Harry stood, gripping the back of his chair.
“I’m afraid not. She is still quite contagious.” Cato bowed his head slightly, seeming genuinely sorry. “Perhaps tomorrow.”
ago Draco, you’ll have to act normal around him sometime. And Harry, you and Hermione can come back and bring the Gryffindor set, you still see Longbottom and Thomas and the rest all the time, right?”
Faced with another day of waiting for Hermione to recover, Harry poked around the old house until he found a broom cupboard with a couple of Cleansweeps. No one bothered him about it. Ernie seemed to have fucked off back to London, and Hermione was still firmly ensconced in her room, with Cato on watch. Harry cast the strongest disillusionment he could and spent the morning flying, avoiding groups of hikers and tourists.
“Has someone got an actual camera?” Ron asked, turning to yell in the general direction of the stairs. “HERMIONE? Have we got a camera?”
Hermione wasn’t at breakfast in the morning. When Harry went to her room to check on her Cato was at the door, looking like a very small, very stern nurse. He’d swapped the tuxedo for a tiny pair of scrubs and wore what Harry thought looked like a muggle stethoscope around his neck, only the pieces were pulsating gently, and making a sort of whirring sound.
“Are we? Seeing each other?” Harry felt quite off-balance, dizziness from the hangover spilling over into something else.
“He didn’t apologize to me,” Harry said petulantly. Malfoy hadn’t, he had just fucked Harry tenderly and then offered him breakfast. And Harry had yelled at him and called him a Death Eater.
At the end of the month, a massive eagle owl showed up with a parcel for Hermione. It contained two ledgers that looked to be at least two hundred years old, filled with tiny, impenetrable writing. Hermione sat at the dining table and paged through them carefully, making notes as she went, in a Muggle spiral bound notebook labeled neatly, “House Magic”. No one disturbed her as she worked. It wasn’t worth it to try and get her to explain what she was doing when she was so focused. Harry just sat back and watched her for a while, something comforting about Hermione making notes. The smell of the old parchment of the ledgers reminded him of the Hogwarts library, making him homesick.
Malfoy’s fingers trailed downward, ghosting gently behind his balls, circling around and around. Harry realized with surprising clarity that he had been waiting for this all week. He hadn’t been distracted at all by the afternoons spent in the shop or at the Burrow, he’d been imagining this, hoping for it, even.  When Malfoy stopped to take a breath, Harry reminded himself that he was a Gryffindor, affected a casual tone, and said, “You can fuck me if you’d like.”
“You know, the meal people eat in the mornings,” Malfoy said in that awkward, stiff voice, still looking upwards.
Harry took the brandy, if only to have something to do with his hands. He had planned on drinking less after dinner but now there was little else to do. Malfoy busied himself with writing a letter, appearing determined to ignore Harry.
In the nursery, Draco cradled Teddy and spoke softly to Andromeda, explaining how they had overtaken Greyback, and entreating her to place more protection on her home. Harry sat in the glider and waited his turn. He dozed off at some point, although he couldn’t remember when, only realizing it when he woke to Andromeda lifting a sleeping Teddy off his chest, to move him to the crib.
“Oooh very moody,” Ginny said as he came downstairs, “hoping to catch someone’s eye? I hear Tony Goldstein has been on the prowl.”
“Well, if you’re so certain it’s a lie, I’m not sure why you’re knocking down my door.” Harry crossed his arms.
It wasn’t until later that Harry remembered about Ernie MacMillan at all, having gotten off on his own a second time in the cavernous guest suite, thinking furiously about Malfoy’s fingers, strong and precise, pressing against the keys of the piano. He decided he didn’t want to know. It wasn’t like it meant anything anyways.
“Malfoy Manor?” Ron asked, wandering in from the kitchen at the sound of Hermione’s voice. “You’re going to Malfoy Manor tomorrow? Voluntarily?”
“How dare you, I’ll leave when I see fit,” Mrs. Greengrass sputtered. “I’ll involve Narcissa, you’ll see.”
“It won’t change what’s happened,” she said firmly, “he’s safe now. You can’t keep watch by his crib forever.”
“I’ve been helping him finance some joke shop expansion business on the continent,” Ernie said, as though that explained why they would have been discussing Harry’s love life. Harry glanced over to Malfoy who was clearly listening in. This was not a conversation he wanted to have with Ernie MacMillan and Draco Malfoy of all people.
He had also testified for Draco and Narcissa. Their trials were held very early on in the process, a high-profile affair that was covered extensively by the press, the public breathless, hanging onto every word. Narcissa had maintained her steely countenance, but Draco was a wreck, pallid and lifeless as the charges were brought forth. Up on the witness stand, Harry had described in very plain language how each of them had saved his life. Afterwards he was sick in a Ministry toilet. Lucius was sent to Azkaban.
Malfoy buried his nose in Harry’s neck and breathed deeply, one hand coming up to hold Harry’s jaw firmly, the other reaching between them. They got off like that, Malfoy’s bulk covering Harry completely, pinning him to the bed. Later, after Harry crept back into his own room, he had a sensation like he was floating away and had to wrap himself tightly in the covers to fall asleep.
“You really must come back next week for Bastille Day! Bring whomever you’d like, there will be plenty of champagne. If you ask me, we haven’t celebrated enough this past year,” Dedalus said as they stood next to the hearth. Harry and Hermione promised they’d attend.
“He’s manning the till while George makes a massive fireworks order,” Ginny said. “I wanted to get in on it to be honest, it sounds like fun, but George doesn’t want me accidentally blowing up the workroom. Something about never really being the best Potions student or whatever, not that anyone would have said he was either.”
“Alright, Harry.” It sounded strange in his low voice, but Harry thought he liked it. Draco kissed his other cheek and then his mouth. He spoke again, his lips millimeters from Harry’s own. “Sweetheart.” Harry shivered. He liked the sound of that more.
Harry felt his face go hot. He hadn’t said anything to anyone, about the blowjobs or anything else. For his part, Ron looked mostly unconcerned, already shrugging and wandering off in the direction of a tray of mini quiches. From there, it was just a blur of champagne and music and trying to persuade Seamus that they shouldn’t go for a dip in Diggle Pond. Despite what Malfoy had said about the reporters, no one bothered Harry for a quote or a handshake or a tearful salute. He felt safely cocooned amongst his friends, Ron and Hermione smiling and laughing and indulging his terrible dancing. Close to midnight, he went and found Luna, who was resting her feet, as she sat near a pack of Hogwarts grads Harry only sort of recognized.
“I learned a lot of things,” Draco said airily, “A Malfoy is always learning, we’re keen observers. You never know what might come up that could be used to your advantage.” He was doing the haughty nose thing again. It still made him look arrogant, which of course he could be sometimes, but Harry realized he now understood that it also meant he was nervous.
“It’s your name, isn’t it?” Harry felt a little shy all of a sudden. “You can call me Harry, if you’d like.” Draco leaned over and kissed him on the cheek, his mouth hovering near Harry’s ear.
He got out of the bed and walked to his robes, rummaged around, and produced a small bottle. Harry raised his eyebrows. “You brought lube to the Diggle Bastille Day party?”
Harry didn’t spend the night. He went back to his room and laughed helplessly when he saw his shoes, still sitting on the floor by the bed. In the morning, he beat Malfoy downstairs and had coffee waiting. He alternated between reading the
At dinner, Harry ate alone, served a meal in the kitchen by Cato. He hadn’t seen Dedalus or Malfoy or even Ernie MacMillan all day.
“Harry? Are you home?” Ginny shouted as she came through the door, early in the evening, on a weeknight.
“Hiya Harry.” Michael waved and then ran his hand through his hair. “Somehow, I feel like I should have known.” He looked back to Malfoy. “See you at Hogwarts, I guess. Or, maybe not?” Michael’s eyes flitted once more to Harry before he finally made for the stairs.
Luna laughed. “I think my aura has that effect on some people. She’s supposed to marry Draco anyway.”
“In a manner of speaking,” Ernie said with a sly look at Malfoy, who was still bright red. “Anyway, what about you Harry? George said you’d thrown Ginny over for a Muggle barista, but that was ages ago.”
As they crested another hill, Harry began to regret his decision to accompany Hermione on her walking tour of
“No, you were too busy with Ernie MacMillan to have intentions towards me,” Harry cut in, sitting up and letting the sheet pool around his waist.
“Wanted a souvenir then? To remember the night?” Harry smirked a little, heat pooling low in his stomach.
“I think it looks great, Ronald,” Luna said, smiling from the doorway. She did a little model walk into the room.
“You, throw a tantrum?” Harry said, making eye contact with Draco for the first time that morning. “Unheard of.”
“Harry!” Luna replied, smiling at him. “Do you know Astoria Greengrass?” Luna pointed out a blonde girl who Harry thought looked familiar, wearing a plunging beaded dress and bright red lipstick. She kept glancing at Luna, her eyes sliding over Luna’s tube top appreciatively.
“Dedalus always says it’s a Bastille Day party, although if you ask me, there’s nothing French about him, I think the Diggles just liked an excuse for a big blowout with lots of champagne,” Ernie said. “Dedalus always had the best parties when we were kids, and now he’s been putting them on again. That’s how I reconnected with Draco, you know, Vernal Equinox.” The hand on Draco’s thigh squeezed a little. Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“You have traveled through time before,” Harry reminded her, “it was very stressful, and involved a lot of schoolwork.”
“No, just, you felt pretty confident, then?” Harry wsat up too, so that he was of a height with Malfoy, and shuffled closer on his knees, tucking his face into the curve of Malfoy’s neck, unable to look at him while he talked about this. “You knew I’d want it this badly?”
“Oh, shove it,” Harry said darkly, finally spotting a tray of water glasses, grabbing one and gulping it down gratefully.
Harry followed Neville around the garden beds, and then over to a greenhouse he hadn’t noticed the day before. Some of the windows were smashed in, but overall, it didn’t look to be in terrible shape. “The one at Hogwarts is still in a right state,” Neville told Harry, “one of the giants put his foot through it. Repairing magical glass is a bit of a nightmare.” He reached back and clapped a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Lucky for us, Malfoy here has worked to make himself a bit of an expert.”
Feeling as though he was moving very slowly, Harry cupped Malfoy’s cheek with his palm, stroking down his nose with his thumb, over the cupid’s bow of his mouth, and pressed into Malfoy’s bottom lip. Malfoy’s eyes were very dark, and he made a low, hungry sound as Harry’s thumb slipped into his mouth. His tongue laved over the pad of Harry’s thumb, once, twice, and then Harry withdrew, pressing back into Malfoy’s lip again, slick, shiny, and red.
” Draco’s hand shook, but the spell held. His face was ashen, and he pressed his wand to Greyback’s throat. “Send for the Aurors.” He didn’t turn.
“And you’ll make it good, won’t you?” Harry caught Malfoy’s earlobe in his mouth and bit down gently.
“Oh my! I thought that was, but I never imagined, not here….”An excited voice rang out as the horses drew nearer. Harry squinted upwards, not sure he recognized the man speaking.
At the table, it was much like their first night, only Malfoy jumped into the conversation now and then, offering tentative opinions about theories of house magic, and complimenting the food. It was all very civil and surreal, as though Hogwarts and the war hadn’t happened, let alone the past few days.
“Well, George Weasley is designing them specially for me.” Dedalus looked sheepish as he reached around for the jar of Floo powder. “Brilliant young man!”
“Well, I can stay here and keep an eye on things. I’m not sure that I can help but sticking around probably won’t hurt either.”
Harry coughed up the dregs of his brandy. “George Weasley?” he asked weakly, as Cato whacked him on the back.
“What do you want, Potter?” Malfoy asked harshly, grabbing a jumper from where it had been thrown haphazardly across a sofa, yanking it over his head. He stood up from the piano bench, knocking it backwards, crowding Harry.
“Of course. You’ll see him next week though. Not to worry!” Dedalus beamed, handing them the Floo powder.
“Well, if those are your requirements, I guess we were all trolls then,” Pansy said in a good-natured way, turning to the raised bed where Neville was sweating through his t-shirt. They watched as Neville painstakingly extracted a flowering raspberry bush, leaving the roots intact, handing it off to Draco who repotted it carefully and created a new tag.
beautiful, like a scene out of a movie, the shadows building anticipation towards a dramatic shift in the plot. As if on cue, two figures appeared, approaching on horseback.
“Er, right, thank you Cato, I’ll uh, just be on my way then to see her.” Harry hurried first in the wrong direction, doubled back, and found the correct staircase. Once there, he paced outside of Hermione’s room for a moment, willing his erection away.
“The Malfoy Arboretum was a bit of a legend, in its time.” Neville gestured expansively to the leaves overhead. The identification of the trees was clearly very old, some of them dating back hundreds of years, and though most of the species struck Harry as ordinary, they seemed to hum with a deep magic.
Malfoy still had packing to do. He’d meant to do it the night before. Harry was set to meet Ron and Hermione early at the station. They went back upstairs together and stood in the hall for a moment.
“Oh yes, much better, just a little tired. I think I’ll stay tonight and then we can head home tomorrow, if that’s alright with you.”
Once he had caught his breath, he lay down, exhausted. These attacks had begun not long after the final battle at Hogwarts, always prompted by something he couldn’t anticipate, taking him out sometimes for hours at a time. Initially, he had thought something had been left inside him from Voldemort, still poisoning him. He shared his theory with Hermione and Ron after an unexpected storm ripped through the garden at Grimmauld place and left him gasping for air, causing alarm and embarrassment during a pickup Quidditch game. At their insistence, he had gone to see Dark Magic specialists at St Mungo’s who ran tests and scans, each turning up nothing. After the final test, a terrible exercise that required him to stand completely alone in a dark room while waves of terror rolled through him, he was transferred from Dark Magic to Mind Healing.
“TUBE TOP! TUBE TOP! TUBE TOP!” Ginny chanted, joining her to pose while Harry mimed taking photos with an imaginary camera.
Malfoy’s robes finally pooled on the floor and he reached for Harry, slipping the old jacket off of Harry’s shoulders, finding the button of his jeans. “Malfoy, come on,” Harry said, his voice low, as Malfoy slid his hands up underneath the threadbare t-shirt, gentle, skimming over sensitive skin. Malfoy hummed and then his broad, cool hands slid back and under Harry’s buttocks, picking him up in a fluid motion. Harry’s legs wrapped around Malfoy’s waist automatically and he couldn’t help clinging to him, impressed and turned on. The effect was ruined a little when Malfoy caught his foot on the carpet, staggering up to the bed, and dropping Harry with a startled look. Harry laughed at him and he scowled before relenting with a rueful half-smile Harry had never seen before. Harry smudged the edge of it with his thumb, pulling Malfoy down for another kiss.
Back at Grimmauld Place, things were basically as Harry had left them. Ginny and Luna were in the kitchen, which meant that Dean was likely about somewhere as well, and if Dean was there, then Seamus was either there or coming over soon.
“Malfoy, where’s your mother?” Harry called out, forgetting for a moment that he was technically snooping.
“Yes, my dear girl!” said Dedalus, and he launched into an enthusiastic history of magical authors who had found great success in Muggle publishing.
you are to Draco Malfoy, he is to be married to my youngest, Astoria. There is a rumor, a pernicious lie, I’m sure, that Draco has decided to give up the match to pursue your affections instead.”
“That settles it.” Dedalus squeezed his arm excitedly. “Wonderful, wonderful…Oh Draco, is your mother here? I must go say hello!”  Malfoy nodded stiffly and gestured towards the house.
“I don’t think it really matters who he likes, the match was made when they were kids,” Luna said with a shrug. “ I think I’m going to go and introduce myself.” She waved at Astoria, who smiled back, slow and satisfied. Harry thought she looked a little like a beautiful shark, predatory and beguiling as Luna made her way over.
Harry froze, his whole body seized with fear and adrenaline. A year ago, he would have known what to do, how to fix it, where to go, but he had changed. He had become soft and now the worst might happen while he was paralyzed on the lawn at Malfoy Manor of all places.
walking tour,” Hermione responded, “Muggle literature, you know.” She looked at Malfoy, who was looking at the ground.
routine. Bullshit, if you ask me,” Harry said, still irritated. He hadn’t meant to forget about what a prick Malfoy was, just because he was apparently good at blowjobs.
“You really must give a toast! Before the fireworks display, won’t you?” Dedalus seemed not to hear him at all.
They sat in awkward silence. Harry wasn’t interested in making small talk with Malfoy. They certainly had never engaged in any before the war. What would he even ask?
He’d go to Tesco and see a blonde head over by the produce and let himself imagine for a moment. Or at home, he found he was waiting for the doorbell to ring, which was absurd because the house was still under Fidelius, and Draco probably couldn’t find the front door even if he wanted to.
“Not since we started? Even back in the beginning of July?” Harry hooked his ankle over Draco’s and nudged him to lay back down as well.
“Come, sit.” Hermione patted the coverlet next to her. There was a massive stack of books on the nightstand.
Harry looked down, remembered that he was in his underwear, and felt that he might melt into the floor. “I just like to be comfortable.”
Harry shrugged, uncomfortable. He crossed the room to the piano and pressed a key at random. “I didn’t know you could play.”
Harry lay back down, resting his hands behind his head. “Oh, and where would I find you then? Normally?”
“Hiya Harry!” Neville was grinning at him, stowing his wand, the plants fully watered. “Malfoy said you wanted to hear about the work we’ve been doing?”
Harry stewed, irritated and mesmerized by the stretch of Malfoy’s idiotic frock coat across his biceps as he fidgeted in the quiet, horror dawning when he realized what he really wanted to ask was, ‘
“Oh that, yes, I came back early.” Malfoy looked around, his hands clenched. “You’re here with Hermione, right? Is she well?”
“He’s mine,” Greyback rasped from the ground. He jerked his head towards Draco, leering. “They both are. The Dark Lord intended them for me. Different purposes though.”
“Oh, come on, you literally carried me to bed.” Harry blushed as well. They hadn’t acknowledged any of it, the fucking or the fighting.
Harry looked over her shoulder towards the nursery one more time, and then did as he was told. Grimmauld Place was quiet and still when he returned, and he slept soundly through the night, only realizing in the morning that Draco had left without saying goodbye.
“Hmm well, it was a bit more complicated with you, wasn’t it?” Hermione said lightly, “More than just realizing he was bigoted or a bully.”
“He what?” Harry pictured Malfoy crying and instantly regretted it, visions of Moaning Myrtle and shining blood on wet tiles making him queasy.
“I don’t think we need to worry about that, he’s too busy plotting to get into Draco Malfoy’s pants,” Ginny said, taking Dean’s hand.
When Greyback was taken into custody and Teddy was returned home, they gave statements in Andromeda’s garden, a sort of makeshift debriefing with Kingsley’s partially rebuilt force. Harry couldn’t focus on the questions, watching the upstairs window where he knew Andromeda was trying to put Teddy to sleep. Next to him, Draco stood very straight and tall, neatly evading any inquiries about how he knew where to find the cave. The minute the Aurors finally left, Harry made for the back door to the cottage with Draco on his heels.
“Maybe I should. I was always more eloquent than you in school.” Malfoy lifted his chin a little, his nose in the air. Harry found that he wanted to reach out and touch Malfoy’s pointy arrogant nose, and wondered if he’d had more to drink than he realized. That arrogance had driven him mad at Hogwarts, and he certainly felt crazy in this moment. He was unable to look away from the lines of Malfoy’s face, somehow familiar and new, under the warm twinkling lights. Malfoy’s lashes were making pretty half-moon shadows across his cheek, contrasting with the sharp patrician angles of his nose and mouth.
After what seemed an eternity, Dedalus popped back in and said, “Merlin, where are my manners! Let me show you to the drawing room. We can have Cato bring up some brandy.”
“Neville? Longbottom?” Harry asked. He heard Hermione sigh. He couldn’t remember a time when she had sighed quite so much as she was doing now.
Harry wasn’t used to hearing people talk about Malfoy Manor in such casual terms. He reached out instinctively for Hermione, who certainly hadn’t been back since she was
Harry suspected he was being tested on something, but he ignored it and instead recalled the night that Pansy had wanted to give him up to Voldemort. Her cowardice wasn’t exactly a crime, there wasn’t a trial or anything, and he had lost track of her completely in the intervening year. Now, watching her blithely hit on Neville Longbottom in the garden of Malfoy Manor, it all seemed like a lifetime ago.
Once dinner was concluded, Ernie and Dedalus insisted on giving Hermione an extensive tour of the house, leaving Harry with Draco. “Behave,” she mouthed at him, before jogging after Ernie, who was already droning on about a tapestry and a unicorn war.
Eventually, when Harry had been walking for a while, the stream widened, opening up into a small lake, shimmering in the late morning sun. Emerging from the water in a truly sodden white undershirt was Draco Malfoy. He didn’t notice Harry at first, shaking water from his hair and turning his face towards the sun. Harry froze in the high grass on the lakeshore, not sure what to do. He had forgotten how good Draco’s chest looked, stacked with well-defined muscle, the wet fabric clinging and translucent. Harry was still thinking about pectorals when he heard, “Potter?” That stupid posh voice was unmistakable. Malfoy had noticed him and turned, heading closer.
“Don’t be crass Ginevra.” Harry went across the room and stole her drink. Ginny was beautiful in a sleek satin dress, with skinny little straps that made her freckled shoulders look incredible and strong.
“It’s been good for him, all the restoration work. I thought he might have complained about having to get his hands dirty, you know, found it all frightfully common, but I think it’s all work he enjoys. You know, the building and fixing, cataloguing and restoring. Maybe he’s always liked it, or at least for a long time, but couldn’t figure out how to engage with it in the right ways.” Pansy said all of this while still looking out at Neville, now drenching the plants in water, as Draco stood back and looked over his notes again.
The man beamed down at them. “The very same. So nice you see you both!” He turned to his companion and gestured him forward, saying, “Come now Draco, you must say hello.”
“Never took much interest before, I’ll tell you that.” Neville winked at Pansy. “Well, come on then, I’ll explain. These are beds where we’re re-establishing the plants to be sent to Hogwarts for the kitchens, and then we’re doing the same in the greenhouses, only those will be more for Potions and Herbology. We’ve been rebuilding the garden beds and greenhouses at Hogwarts and improving the soil, but all of the planting for this coming school year was done here.”
Malfoy came up and peered over Harry’s shoulder at the photograph. “I think it fell out of your pocket. It was there when I went back to Diggle’s guest room to uh…” He stopped, spreading his hands. “When I went back, it was there and now it’s here.”
“Actually, it wasn’t about that at–” Malfoy started to say, only he was cut off when Harry briefly lifted him up off his feet, maneuvering them onto the little bed.
. They’d spent the morning in Bakewell and at Chatsworth house. Then, Hermione had insisted they walk the four miles to Peak District National Park. She really wanted to get the full Lizzie Bennet experience, and all she had planned for them once they got there was more walking.
Hermione had a muggle camera that printed out the photos right away. Ginny appointed herself photographer, getting pictures of everyone as they finished off the last of Ron’s concoctions and then one big group shot before they left, propping the camera up on the mantel and levitating a shot glass to press the button. It took three tries, but it was worth it, all of them cheering and laughing when the flash finally went off. Harry pocketed a picture of him changing a record, the perpetual bedhead and Sirius’ jacket making him look like a dirtbag Muggle DJ, and then they all went through the Floo.
Ron shook his head slowly, speaking carefully.“For a little while, it was nice to think we could be properly brothers. But we’ve always been like this, Ginny or no. I found my way back to you in the forest for you, you know?”
“I bet you never knew Draco was such a swot,” Pansy said, peering up at Harry from under the wide brim of her hat.
Tucked away from all the partygoers outside, Malfoy moved slowly. He carefully removed his formal robes as he kissed Harry up against the doorframe, long and lingering. The week that they had spent apart seemed to have sweetened things, Harry’s breath stuttering when Malfoy reached up to stroke his cheek and take off his glasses from where they had been digging in. Before, Harry had felt a familiar hostility humming at the edge of his thoughts, pushing him to bite and tug and collide with Malfoy, reminding him of times they had scuffled in school. He still felt some of that urge to fuck Malfoy up, fuck himself up in the process, but even more so, he was overwhelmed by a feeling of uncomplicated pleasure.
The rest of July went by pleasantly enough. Grimmauld Place was busy. Neville and Hannah stayed for a week, along with Luna, Ginny, Dean, and Seamus, who basically lived in the house by that point. They went out often to Muggle clubs where no one recognized them. Sometimes they were caught by a photographer who heard they might get a shot of Ginny with Dean, after the Diggle party. Ginny didn’t seem to mind, only saying that maybe photos in the Evening Prophet might finally persuade Mrs. Weasley that things really had ended with Harry. If Ron was disappointed by how everything turned out between Harry and Ginny, he chose not to say anything at all.
Draco took a breath and looked cautiously at Harry. “My feelings are unchanged from what they were in July. If you feel now the way you did then, please just say so and I’ll leave you alone forever. I really will. But I, I want to try–”
“Okay, fine, so you are Draco Malfoy, restoration expert. Is that how you’ve gotten so big, then? Rebuilding the Manor?”
The thing was, Harry didn’t know whether he could ever really get on with Malfoy, whether he even wanted to.  And now, he felt a prickle of heat, mingled with the usual feeling of dislike and mistrust, too confusing to try and untangle.
“I don’t want anything from you. I’ve already won, remember?” Harry said, trying to recall his earlier plan of avoiding Malfoy.
“You, uh- you could come back tomorrow, if you’re interested. Longbottom will be here as well, he can explain it better than me,” Malfoy said. “And then, Hermione, if you’re not done working with Dedalus yet, you can keep on.”
Malfoy, it was just the convenience of it, having someone around who wanted you as much as you wanted them. Which at this point, Harry could admit was quite a lot.
“It’s just a garden, Malfoy,” Harry said, uncomfortable. An awkward moment passed, Malfoy’s eyes still trained to the ground. “I mean, the vegetables looked really, er, green? And organized?”
“Some people wash before dinner,” Malfoy muttered, with a sidelong glance at Harry that went straight through him.
Hours later, when they had finished, slept, woken up, and gone again, Harry slung an arm across Malfoy’s waist as they lay side by side. “You’re not going to see Michael Corner at Hogwarts.”
Harry searched Draco’s face and saw his own terror mirrored back at him, but also something in the set of his jaw that looked like determination or maybe strength. Things he had never seen there before.
Afterwards, Cato insisted on Hermione going straight to bed, so as not to overtire her. Dedalus left them after dinner as well.
you?” Malfoy said faintly. His eyes were very grey. Harry didn’t know what to say. He looked instinctively to Hermione and found that she was watching them with a thoughtful expression.
to Draco. They had never even really been together. And Draco hadn’t given any indication that he even wanted Harry anymore.
Malfoy startled, glancing up and then back at the massive hole in the wall. “Well, it’s not as if she really has any expertise in this.”
Harry began to back up slowly into his room. For a second it seemed like Michael might turn and leave without noticing him, but a floorboard creaked and Michael’s gaze swung from Harry to Malfoy and back again. He looked confused, then a little disappointed.
Eventually it got too difficult to stay away, which was how Harry wound up accidentally Apparating directly into the small study at Malfoy Manor. Miraculously, Draco was there, mudding and taping the newly repaired wall. Harry caught himself on the desk, which was still covered in blueprints and drawings, the photo of Harry in Sirius’ jacket now hanging charmed to the wall behind it.
“Uh yes, I suppose it is. Yeah no, Mal- Draco’s been fine, really. Not bothering me at all.” Harry rubbed at the spot where Malfoy had bit him the night before.
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice rang out through the door. “Is that you out there? Cato says it’s perfectly fine to come in.”
When the tour of the greenhouse was done, Neville took them out to the tree line of a small wood, where there were more little labels, this time stamped in bronze relief, affixed to the bark.
“Oh, and you do? Draco Malfoy, restoration expert? When have you ever fixed anything in your life?” Malfoy coughed and Harry remembered the vanishing cabinet, a sick feeling in his stomach.
In the end, it was over quickly, Greyback bound on the floor of the cave, his stolen wand tight in Harry’s grasp. Draco stood over Greyback’s prostrate form as Harry ran to Teddy, waving away the protective spells and lifting him into his arms. Teddy was still crying, smearing snot all over Harry’s shirt, his sobs quieting to little hiccoughs while Harry rubbed gentle circles on his back.
“Why don’t you ever use a muffling spell?” Harry tucked his face into Malfoy’s neck, ground his hips against him. “I can hear your whole damn day through this wall.”
Hermione was at dinner as promised, looking like her old self. She was deep in conversation with Malfoy and Dedalus, something about the magical cores of houses, when Harry came in from the gardens where he’d spent the afternoon tramping about and lying in the sun. He felt positively grubby standing next to Malfoy, who had changed out of the breeches into soft looking charcoal trousers that draped devastatingly well. It just made Harry want to reach out and muss him up a little.
Malfoy did make it good. He returned to sucking Harry’s cock and then opened Harry up, slow and agonizingly sweet. He warmed the lube in his hands and used so much that Harry felt that he was dripping with it, that he could take anything that Malfoy gave him. When Malfoy finally pushed inside, Harry was surprised at how much he loved it. He twisted and arched into the pressure, pushing his hips up to get
“Well, maybe not forever.” Harry didn’t take his eyes off Teddy’s little chest as it rose and fell in time with his breathing.
Instead, the low, steadfast hum of magic stretching between the roots and the canopy suggested the mundane. Here was a place where people and plants had lived and died. A home with a history that was punctuated by terror, but that was also normal, domestic and quotidian, just like anywhere else. It was a relief to know that even after Lucius and Voldemort, the wood remained to watch on for another four hundred years.
Harry allowed Cato to lead him back to the breakfast room, where he used the Floo to let Ron know what was happening.
They still spent a good deal of time together, going out with the Gryffindors, dancing and drinking and avoiding reporters from the gossip columns. At Grimmauld Place, surrounded by his friends and without the threat of violence for the first time in his life, Harry would see her laughing or flying or just lying on the couch, and he knew that he loved her, but it just wasn’t how he had thought.
Once, after one too many whiskeys, and in a maudlin mood that wasn’t helped by the sad records Neville preferred to play after dinner, Harry asked Ron if he cared that he and Ginny weren’t having a happy-ever-after.
“Oooh yes, I’ve heard about those parties. Katie and Angelina went on New Year’s and said there was a champagne fountain.” Ginny grinned. “Apparently, Pansy Parkinson went for a swim.”
Malfoy’s mouth pressed into a grim line. “Right,” he said tightly, “good night, Potter.” He hurried down the hall, without waiting for a reply.
“You could be wearing that damn invisibility cloak and I’d know you were watching me.” Malfoy did look up then; his cheeks were flushed.
“Well, I might see him in the Great Hall at meals, or in class. Can’t really avoid anyone fully at Hogwarts, the castle’s not actually that big.”
“Well, Parkinson will probably be at this party as well, if you wanted to join her this time. Malfoy invited her,” Harry said.
Draco just shook his head at her. “Who is even left? They haven’t had the time to rebuild. Edward is my cousin.” He drew a breath, looking away. His voice had cracked. Harry waited.  Draco drew his wand, murmuring to himself, looking sick. The air was very still and quiet. Harry’s heartbeat thundered in his ears. Draco swayed, his eyes cold and unseeing.
.” Malfoy slid one hand up into Harry’s curls to tug sharply, the other gripping his t-shirt tightly, fingers hot against his collarbone.
Ginny made a face at the mention of Malfoy. Despite how he had spent the past few days, Harry sort of agreed. More and more it seemed like the rest of the world had moved on. Harry often sensed a creeping expectation he was just going to get on with these people, the way Diggle and MacMillan were. People like Parkinson who had wanted to turn him over to Voldemort to save herself, and Malfoy, who had really believed in it all, at least in the beginning, bigoted and cruel even to the end. He didn’t regret testifying for Malfoy, but it had felt like a debt repaid.
“You can come and see him again in the morning,” Andromeda promised, shepherding Harry to the floo. “You need to sleep, and so do I.”
“I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but you cannot go in,” Cato said firmly, holding the door shut. “Ms. Granger has contracted Doxy flu and is highly contagious. Seeing as you have never had it yourself, it would be unwise to expose you.”
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. He made his way back up to the great lawn and saw Hermione waving down to him as he came up the hill. She led him around the decrepit rose garden to a patio where a table was laid for lunch. As they walked, Hermione was talking rapidly, describing the centuries-old magic at the core of the Manor, mysterious and alive, just pulsating like a heart, out in the open. Harry absorbed none of it.
For a second, Harry wasn’t sure what to do, wondering if he should go over there or wait for Malfoy to come to him, or just pretend nothing had happened at all. Then, Ernie MacMillan appeared with a drink and canapé for Malfoy and Harry felt a flash of possessiveness, like a shock. He’d forgotten about Ernie. They turned away and the possessive feeling twisted into smug satisfaction when Malfoy neatly sidestepped Ernie’s hand at his lower back.
“It’s generally considered rude, you know, apparating directly into someone’s home.” Draco had turned and eyed Harry from across the room.
They gathered themselves quickly, any afterglow obliterated when Malfoy wondered aloud if Dedalus meant to join them for breakfast.
Dedalus appeared then, looking apologetic. “I think she must have contracted it in the library. We all had it as children and are immune. We’ll take excellent care of her though, don’t worry Harry! It’s only a mild case, really.”
“Er, Cato, how is Hermione doing? Do you think I could see her later tonight?” Harry asked, picking at his meal.
For a while, Harry felt a strange sense of anticipation, like if he entered a random room at the right time, Malfoy might be there waiting for him. He ate breakfast with Seamus and Dean and was distracted thinking about Malfoy going down on him at the table. Or after flying in the garden with Ginny, he was a little disappointed that Malfoy wasn’t there in the living room, sneering at him. It wasn’t that he
Hermione nodded. “Yes, it’s quite fascinating. I think we’ll use the historical record you sent over to try to gain an understanding of the long-term effects of dark magic on a home like this.”
When Malfoy spoke again, his voice was ragged. “Did you expect that I could just forget everything I’d ever been taught, leave behind my family, my birthright? I was a child! Was I supposed to rejoice in the realization that the shining future my father described was really just endless terror and fear?” He took a breath and looked Harry in the eye, his face marked by a sort of desperation. “Everything you said at my trial, about how I wasn’t a killer, and how I’d saved your life, that meant nothing to you?”
Draco Malfoy was beside him, looking like he’d rather fall off his horse than say hello. Hermione shot Harry a look, which he interpreted to mean that she’d rather Malfoy fell off his horse as well. Not wanting to appear rude in front of Diggle, Harry waved and said, “Hullo, Malfoy.”
“Of course not,” Malfoy said wildly, waving his forearm at Harry’s face. “I never have!” He stared at the Mark so intensely that Harry thought he might be trying to do some kind of wandless, wordless magic.
Malfoy took a step back and Harry followed, walking until they were against the wall. “Any of it, I guess,” Malfoy murmured, looking at Harry from under the curve of his lashes. Harry pressed himself up against Malfoy hard enough that the wall must have been digging into his back.
As soon as Dedalus was gone, Malfoy reached over and gripped Harry’s arm a bit too hard. Harry winced and fumbled for his wand, but then they were squeezing through blackness, into what must have been Malfoy’s guest suite, landing with a loud crack on the bed.  Malfoy set in on Harry’s trousers immediately, growing frustrated with the buttons, then banishing them and his own altogether. He knocked Harry’s legs apart and slid in between them, pushing Harry onto his back, balancing above him. Harry canted his hips up towards Malfoy, grinding against him, feeling desperate already, saying, “Don’t you want me to go and have a wash?”
“You might check in with her about it, then. Last I heard she was engaging in her own, what did you call it? Promiscuity?” Harry spoke coolly, thinking of the way Astoria had looked at Luna.
“Maybe?” Malfoy reached out and rucked up Harry’s t-shirt, his fingers finding bare skin, smiling when Harry shivered at his light touch. “Okay.”
“Did you know this, Hermione? That Neville was working with Malfoy on plant stuff?” Harry asked. The exasperation on Hermione’s face indicated that she knew and maybe Harry also knew as well, or would have known, if he had listened a little better when Neville came over.
“I don’t know about that,” a familiar voice floated in from the doorway. “I seem to remember lots of clippings—”
“So, it’s been alright then? Staying here?” Hermione looked a little apologetic. “I know historic homes aren’t really your thing.”
“Er, party?” Harry wasn’t sure what was stranger, that Ernie MacMillan was planning a party with the Slytherins or that he had just invited Harry.
A mountain ash tree was bright red with late summer berries, and when Harry read the plaque, he saw that it had been growing on the Malfoy estate for nearly four hundred years. He stood underneath the tree for some time, examining the bark and admiring the berries, feeling the coolness of its shade. Harry wondered what the tree had thought of the war, if it had minded providing safe harbor for monsters. He felt a little ridiculous, imagining the inner life of a tree, and yet the sound of the breeze making its way through the leaves made him certain that the tree had at least borne witness to the war, but that it had not been the only great or terrible thing to happen there over four hundred years.
Malfoy hummed. “I used one when it mattered.” He pressed back, hooking a leg around Harry’s for leverage and better friction. “You only heard Michael when he left.”
“We haven’t eaten yet, but I’m sure it will be very nice,” Hermione said warmly. “Dedalus had Cato prepare us something. He’s just inside.”
When it was time to turn another page, Malfoy darted a look at Harry as he reached across. Dissonant chords rang out and then the sound stopped entirely, Malfoy clamping his right hand over his left forearm, searching frantically for something. Harry hadn’t even noticed the Mark; he had forgotten all about it in the close room with the music.
“Yeah, I know what breakfast is, thanks. I’m just surprised you want me to stay and have it with you.”
Harry groused as he wandered the grounds of the estate. Even so, the combination of good weather and stunning landscape made it difficult to feel too annoyed. Staying a few extra days in such a beautiful place was hardly a chore, and Harry reasoned he could avoid Malfoy in the massive old house while he waited for Hermione to improve.
“Right, yes, the Manor kitchens still aren’t functioning. Not for guests anyways.” Malfoy turned away for a moment, touching the back of his neck. “And uh, were you and Dedalus able to find what you were hoping for?”
The Diggle Estate twinkled with thousands of fairy lights and a band played from a tent down on the lawn. There must have been 300 people there, but it only took Harry a moment to locate Draco, standing taller than most everyone, wearing midnight blue dress robes. Just as quickly, Malfoy noticed Harry and looked him over in a disgusted way. This would have infuriated him until very recently; now it just caused a swooping sensation, low in his stomach.
, a precaution given the um, occupation, which is to say that the connection has never been opened since it was made, but I imagine I could access it.”
When it was time for the fireworks, most everyone gathered on the green overlooking Diggle Pond. Harry hid towards the back of the group, hoping that if he couldn’t find him, Dedalus wouldn’t make good on his earlier promise to bring him up for a toast. Someone touched his shoulder from behind and he jumped, reaching for his wand on habit. It was Malfoy, holding two champagne flutes, the corners of his eyes crinkled in amusement. He handed one to Harry and said, “You’re going to miss your speech if you stand all the way back here.”
“Draco Malfoy is engaged to my daughter,” Mrs. Greengrass hissed furiously. “A strong match, made when they were children. I won’t see that taken from her.”
“Good, excellent. Potter, I trust the gardens were to your liking?” Malfoy turned to Harry now, still formal in his address, the only hint of their earlier soggy run-in staining his cheeks and neck pink.
“You don’t have to,” Pansy said in a low, angry voice. “You don’t have to open the connection. The Aurors are professionals, they will take care of it.”
Harry suppressed a shiver and turned to face him. “They say that anyways. Why not give them the picture to go with?” It was true. The Prophet often reported that Harry and Hermione had run off, recycling old photos of Ginny and Ron crying from Fred’s funeral. It would be horribly depressing, if it didn’t happen like clockwork any time a slow news day rolled around.
CW: This chapter contains a short scene of canon-typical violence, including discussion of implied sexual violence.
Harry lay alone in a massive guest suite and tried not to think about whether Malfoy and Ernie had gone together down the hall. When that didn’t work, he tried picturing each of them alone in their own beds, which would have helped, only he got stuck imagining Malfoy’s pajamas. Harry slept in boxers, and while he supposed Malfoy might do the same, it occurred to him that there really wasn’t room for boxers under those breeches. So then he was just laying in bed picturing Malfoy sleeping in the nude. It wasn’t conducive to rest.
Two spots of color emerged high on Malfoy’s cheekbones and he gave a stiff nod. They hadn’t really seen each other much in the last year, keeping their distance at Ministry functions when the need arose. Harry wasn’t sure what Malfoy had been doing since the war, other than damage control.
Draco burst out laughing. “The look on your face! Merlin!” Harry poked him in the side. “No, I know, I know. I don’t really want to live here either.” He gestured vaguely to the room, the house. They were laying on a mattress on the floor of a bedroom that wasn’t too damaged.
Hermione accepted the invitation with enthusiasm, launching into the detailed description of her findings, and Malfoy nodded along politely. When Cato arrived with lunch, Malfoy bowed out and Dedalus joined them in his place, starting a long and boring conversation about the historical occupants of Malfoy Manor.
Harry gaped at the painting. She shrugged back. “You’ll figure it out, I’m sure. The Greengrasses were always a ghastly sort anyway.”
in the parlor with the piano, or the breakfast room, or the guest wing.  “The Potters were purebloods, weren’t they?”
“About what?” Harry reached out and gripped Malfoy’s shoulder, his thumb pressing into delicate collarbone.
“I was in Scotland a lot this year, for the rebuilding. I spent time with Dedalus in Derbyshire. And, Ernie has a place in London, but I haven’t, you know, not since we started–”
Draco demurred, waving Neville off, gazing up at the greenhouse instead. “I wasn’t really allowed to come down here as a child. Some days my grandmother would sneak me in though. She was always a little less immune to a tantrum.”
Beyond the vegetables there was a rose garden. Now August, it was far past its prime and the pathway littered with rotting petals. Entire plants were ripped out of place, no labels or neat writing to be found. Harry felt a chill among the wilting foliage, even though the day was sunny and warm. He jogged forward to the back lawn, hurrying to push away the clammy, cold feeling. He stumbled across the green, away from the decaying scent of the rose bushes, taking in great gulps of the summer air.
“I want to try as well–” Harry started and stopped again, horrified to find that he felt like crying. For his part, Draco looked like he was only one more declaration away from losing it too.
Harry thought back on his interactions with Draco in school, steeped in loathing and righteous anger. It was true that Draco was a bully and a bigot, but he had also been magnetic, catching Harry in his orbit again and again. Even if it hadn’t felt
A moment before Harry was about to give up and try something on his own, Draco reached out and gripped his forearm, pulling him into the darkness. They emerged on a soggy hillside, just feet from the mouth of a cave, the sound of a baby crying coming from within.
.” The sound of a polite cough came from behind them. Harry jumped back and felt himself go bright red. Cato was looking up at them expectantly, in his usual stately manner.
“Well, you’ll have to tell Draco goodbye from us,” Hermione said, looking around. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy since he’d left him sticky and sleepy-eyed the night before. He hadn’t said goodbye to Malfoy then, either.
back then, in hindsight Harry knew he’d gotten a kind of satisfaction from it. And now, even as things between them changed and the world changed, that irresistible magnetism remained, tugging at Harry through it all.
Malfoy. Not everyone has a poncey horse they can just ride around on, looking down on people.” Harry’s embarrassment slid away as quickly as it had come.
“Ancient earth magic, and very important,” Luna said seriously. “Also, it helps purebloods sort out the incest ick factor when they, you know, want to
“Harry, my boy!” Dedalus Diggle’s voice rang out, cutting him off before he could finish. “So glad you could make it. Really, you’re the guest of honor, I should say.”
Ginny darted a look between them, and kissed Harry on the cheek. “She was waiting for me in the square, wouldn’t take no for an answer. I’ll be in the living room,” she murmured. “Give a shout if you need anything.”
“I don’t know that we had planned on staying,” Harry said, wishing he had paid a little more attention when Hermione had told him her plans the night before.
Harry shut his eyes, mind awash with memories of Draco in the garden at Malfoy Manor, taking fastidious notes for Neville, at Andromeda’s cottage holding Teddy like he was the most precious thing in the world, holding
Harry went back into his room and closed the door behind him. His heartbeat was too loud to hear what was happening next door, a small mercy. He sat on the edge of the bed, and took off his shoes. If he wasn’t wearing any shoes then he couldn’t walk back out into the hall and take the five paces to Malfoy’s door. Harry slid to the floor with a groan. Even an hour before, the situation would have been unthinkable. But now it was crystal clear, something he’d seen that he couldn’t unsee.
“Well, I don’t know. I mean, I certainly didn’t intend for this when we started, I don’t think I really intended to start anything at all--"
During the war, Harry had had only a vague idea of what his life might look like if they won. In the immediate aftermath, there were procedural things: funerals, trials, sentencing, elections. The Ministry was in utter shambles, and sorting through who was really a Voldemort loyalist and who’d acted under Imperius took months. Harry hadn’t really wanted anything to do with it, but he’d gritted his teeth and testified when called, usually with Ron, Hermione, or Luna. He helped pick out Snatchers from lineups, and spoke on behalf of people like Stan Shunpike.
and peering over the top of the paper to watch Malfoy sip from the mug, the steam curling pleasantly in the fall air. They had to be at King’s Cross soon, their week at the Leaky was over.
Mrs. Greengrass looked sharply at Ginny’s retreating back. “Just another example of your infamous promiscuity, I presume?”
“The Dark Lord opened a connection between our minds, so that Greyback would know where I was if he liked.” Draco’s voice was bitter. “It was meant to be a gift.” The bottom of Harry’s stomach dropped out. Pansy’s face was white with fury, but she didn’t look surprised. “Mother was teaching me Occlumency already, among other
“You thought I was asking you to move in?” Draco sat up part way, his expression all concern and confusion.
Harry was silent for a moment. The whole situation felt absurd and archaic, some pureblood nonsense. He certainly wasn’t
and motioned Harry forward towards the dark opening. Inside, Greyback was pacing. Teddy sat on the ground, wailing, his chubby fists clenched.
while Hermione recovered. He hadn’t really been doing much of anything in the past year. Hogwarts was closed for extensive repair work, so Harry had mostly been living at Grimmauld Place with Ron and Hermione and sometimes Ginny. The house was large, and Harry liked it to be full of people, inviting members of the DA to stay for weeks or months at a time, making it feel crowded and alive.
. Malfoy was holding himself up, tentatively rocking into Harry with care. He pressed his face into Harry’s neck and reached down to grip Harry’s cock between them, everything hot and wet and sensitive.
, Harry jolted a little, remembering what a snob Malfoy was. The whole outfit was ridiculous, as was the horse for that matter.
Harry looked at Malfoy instead. This was a mistake. The candlelight was somehow even more flattering to Malfoy than the sunset had been, softening his sharp features, making him look golden and fine. He was still wearing the full ensemble from earlier, including a stiff overcoat, waistcoat, and a truly stupid shirt that looked like a pirate’s nightshirt. Harry helped himself to another glass of wine.
He turned and leaned against the door, feeling drained. Walburga Black eyed him thoughtfully from her portrait.
After about fifteen minutes of scribbling, Hermione looked up and said “Harry, you should come to the Manor with me tomorrow,” as if this was a completely normal thing to say.
In the morning, Dedalus saw them off to Grimmauld Place, explaining that he had set up a temporary Floo connection with Ron – “Excellent young man! Saw him last night about the fireworks”– having been let into the
“Do we just go in then?” Harry nodded towards the massive estate. Hermione approached the gate, and he held his breath, waiting for some terrible repelling jinx or curse. Instead, it just swung open, creaking loudly, startling the peacocks on the great sloping lawn. They crunched up the pea gravel drive and met with Dedalus at the entrance to the house.
“Pansy!” Malfoy exclaimed, talking over her, taking three long strides to reach out and squeeze her shoulders tightly against his chest. “I forgot you were coming today!”
“Right, of course.” Malfoy swallowed and frowned, looking downward. “And Hermione is well? And her, uh Weasley? Ronald?”
“I’ve been helping young Draco, you know. Managing the Manor is a lot of work and Lucius was terrible at it in the best of times, and I know you saw some of the damage it sustained, in the war. With Lucius gone, I’ve been helping Draco with restoration, land management, that sort of thing.”
“You know what he looks like now, don’t pretend,” Malfoy muttered in Harry’s direction. “Tomorrow, Pansy, Longbottom is coming by tomorrow.”
“Come on Harry.” Ron looked to Hermione for a moment, eyebrows raised. “You know how you can be about him.”
“Oh, but you’ll let me suck your cock. Very nice,” Malfoy fumed as he extricated himself from the bed.
“Oh no, away on business. Too bad, you’ll miss him entirely I think.” Dedalus shook his head. “Now then, should we begin? I think the best place to start is likely the cellar. Harry, would you care to join us?” Harry considered the cellar at Malfoy Manor and backed away unconsciously.
“Oh, I suppose you could come as well, Ron. I only thought because Harry enjoyed the grounds at the Diggle Estate, he might want to see how Draco has been restoring the park at the Manor.” Hermione said this in a way that struck Harry as purposefully obtuse.
Harry nodded, his throat tight. Across the dinner table, Diggle was turning his attention to Malfoy with the same gracious tone, as though Harry and Hermione were just old school chums of his, hoping to catch up.
Dean didn’t reply. Things weren’t bad between them, just complicated. It wasn’t exactly true, what George had said about Harry throwing Ginny over for a Muggle barista. Harry and Ginny had never really properly gotten back together after the war. They had tried, sort of, and parts of it had worked well. The sex was fierce and affectionate, and Harry loved it, how intimate and different it was from any type of closeness he had felt before. But it had mostly been just that, and when Ginny found herself weeping for hours after going to see George, Harry felt useless and distant. And when Harry couldn’t bring himself to visit baby Teddy for months, Ginny seemed unable to relate, holding onto her own family more tightly than ever.
At that, it seemed Malfoy could stand their conversation no longer. Still looking at the ground, he nodded and said, “Excuse me.” He turned on his heel, squelching towards the main house, apparently too flustered for any drying charms.
When Jason, the Muggle barista, had asked Harry out, Ginny had just shrugged and told him to go for it, she’d been spending more time with Dean anyway. Clearly though, knowing Harry wanted to date nice coffee shop employees named Jason was one thing, knowing he had spent the last few days desperately rubbing up against Draco Malfoy was another entirely.
Affixed to the wall behind Malfoy was the Diggle Family Crest, which looked to be hundreds of years old and very heavy. The symbol of the crest, flames encircling an eagle in flight, nagged at Harry even more so than the strangeness of eating dinner with Draco Malfoy. Something Ernie said about the rebuilding effort at Hogwarts jogged his memory at last.
“No, I think it will probably help, in some weird way. And I do really want to see Dedalus about his research into the cores of magical homes. I’ve been so aimless this past year, it feels like time to figure out a graduate scheme.”
Harry laughed, surprised. “I’d say I was offended that you weren’t displaying it more prominently, but then I suppose I understand. I mean, what would people say, Draco Malfoy hanging pictures of Harry Potter in his house, they’d think you’d gone mad.”
It was strange, then to see Draco Malfoy here at the Diggle estate, his life seemingly uninterrupted, the war a small hiccough in his birthright as Lord of the Manor. ‘
Harry pulled away, impatient and pacing.  “Not to be rude, but how? You’ve got no experience in this sort of thing and not to mention your defensive spells were useless the last time I checked.”
“Oh well, I wouldn’t say that. I mean, it’s a Bastille Day party, I didn’t have anything to do with that, it was all those angry French women,” Harry said, awkwardly.
“Yes, and you tried to kill me in a toilet!” Malfoy said, “But somehow I still wanted to eat fucking breakfast with you.”
“Harry, what do you think?” Hermione was speaking again, trying to get his attention. “Dedalus has invited us to supper at his estate. It’s a lovely old home like Chatsworth, and since we won’t make it to Lyme Park, I really think it will round out the trip.”
Malfoy looked up, his eyes dark and fixed on Harry’s. “Yes.” He reached out and grabbed Harry’s chin, pulling him down. “Yes.”
Malfoy blinked. “The vegetables. Yes, I’ve been helping Longbottom prepare plants to transplant back to Hogwarts this fall. Our greenhouses are full as well. Part of the restoration. We prioritized that over the Manor kitchens.”
“You sure you want to do this with everyone here?” Malfoy’s lips caught Harry’s ear. Harry shivered, not even sure of what
Ginny made everyone drinks while they got ready, playing music, and critiquing their outfits. Hannah came over, with Neville, Lavender, and Parvati, because Harry’s Floo was still connected to the Diggle Estate, and because Ginny hosted an excellent pre-game. This was the sort of thing Grimmauld Place was good for, what their school years could have been like if they hadn’t been fighting a war.
Harry and Hermione spent the night at the wizarding pub in town, where Hermione secured lodgings under a false name. “I just think we could do without the headlines, don’t you?” she asked, after signing her name in the ledger as Mafalda Hopkirk. Harry hadn’t considered it, his mind too full of Draco swimming and framing walls to worry about tabloid press. He went to sleep in the small room still preoccupied, dreaming of shimmering lakes and deltoids, glistening with sweat or lake water or both, just out of reach.
Harry tucked his face into Malfoy’s neck and reached around blindly for his arse, groaning when he realized Malfoy was wearing breeches again.
“No trouble with the gate then?” Dedalus asked, shaking Harry’s hand with a smile. “Draco’s been working to undo most of the nastier wards. Difficult business.”
Neville was at the Manor in the morning, as promised, wearing a great straw hat and dungarees, with wellies already caked in mud. Pansy sat on a chaise lounge that she’d dragged over to the kitchen garden from the patio. She wore an enormous sun hat of her own that was probably quite chic, overseeing the proceedings. Draco was crouched down next to Neville, scribbling notes as Neville took measurements and performed what must have been diagnostic spells. Pansy waved Harry over as he approached. Hermione was already inside, eager to get back to her research.
