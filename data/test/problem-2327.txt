When can we make an appointment for you to come to the DoM for an in-person meeting about your research?
Trudging along, he was counting itty bitty stitches and doing silent math for making cables in the round when Harry’s voice broke the silence. Draco jumped, nearly forgetting that Harry was in the room with him, consumed as he was with his project.
He couldn’t believe his last day was finally here, after months of encouragement from his therapist and few friends. He’d been teetering on the edge of a vicious burnout for so long, and he knew, despite his fears and existential dread that this change would be good for him. He sighed in relief as he strolled towards the Janus Thickey ward, his feet carrying him down a familiar route as he thought. He had worked so hard to get through Healer training, to get into his speciality, to do good in his community. He jumped through every fucking hoop and obstacle the wizarding world could throw at him, and did it without complaint. It was his penance, after all.
Harry cleared his throat loudly, and she started, bleary eyes looking about. “Password?” She half gurgled, hurriedly swiping away the drool across her cheek.
He would rather pull his herbal encyclopaedia down from the shelf and lose himself reading about African wormwood. He certainly didn’t want to see Charlie today. He didn’t want to be seen by the students. He wanted to let his potions room swallow him whole where he could absorb himself in something that nourished his mind rather than making him want to peel his skin off.
He dipped the ash gently into the freezing water, and watched as the blood within seemed to be soaked right up into the wood, the little figure writhing in his palms, claws coming to life against his skin. As he lifted the little figure, the Ash now tinged reds and browns, black in places, it raised it’s head and regarded Harry thoughtfully. He was painfully reminded of those first moments when Norbert (later Norberta) had come cracking through the shell of her egg, fearless and full of curiosity.
In a rush, sound came back to Harry’s world, Hestia’s voice cracking the stillness. The silence. Sound and time fell back together and Draco was coughing and spluttering and clawing at his neck, and Harry was flying down the stairs. Running to him. Arms outstretched, a fire kindling in him. Burning and roaring and his magic surging out of him, desperate and enraged, spiralling.
“I’m feeling brave.” Draco pressed, in a voice that didn’t sound brave at all. “Let me be brave.” He whispered. Knowing that this bravery was tentative. Fragile. Flighty. It could be gone in moments at the merest hint of doubt and insecurity. Draco was holding on to that thread of bravery with all of his might. Nearly trembling with the effort of keeping it .
He walked closer to Harry, no longer fearing physical retribution, and held out his hand to help him up. Harry looked at the proffered hand and seemed to consider rejecting the offer of help, but eventually he took Draco’s hand and was slowly hauled to his feet.
Now standing in his kitchen cradling his cup of morning tea Draco looked over to his little encourage-mint, the only sign of life in his otherwise bleak existence. Neville had told him when he had given Draco the little mint corsica, three years ago, that it was an extremely difficult plant to care for requiring constant attention and moisture. He had also said that anyone who could keep a mint corsica plant alive for more than a few weeks was an all right bloke in his books.
“So, tell me about your mum.” Harry said, turning to catch Draco staring, and blushing slightly.
“Rose, it’s you and me in the kitchen today. You’re in charge of making sure I don’t mess this up. A certain someone is very picky and terribly discerning. And, Godric, I want to impress him.”
“Oh, Draco, you’ve already made a fuss, but not the fun kind. As your
“Shit.” Harry’s voice broke the thick quiet in the kitchen.
“But… but… you’re Harry Potter.” His voice was incredulous. Bewildered.
Harry felt a numbing tingling sensation ghost across his lips as he thought back to that moment in the dark, in the warm rush of Draco leaning down and the pull of everything they had been through together. The months of building trust of creating a place of their own to explore who they are just as much as what they wanted. What they needed. A place to reclaim themselves.
“I told you, kid, the amount I’m giving you lately, it’s too much. You’ve gotta cut back.” He was trying to shake his head.
While he never wanted to attend births again after that rotation, as the emotional strain was almost crippling, he took those lessons with him, remembered them, practiced them. Leaned into discomfort when it arose. Sat it with. Became its friend.
“Yes.” She said placatingly. “But, I think we need to get it off the record. They’re not interested in keeping the forest safe, or magic of the land balanced to prevent evil maelstroms from forming, they’re interested in the power behind your connection. How they could weaponise it. This is what’s happening all over the world. Magical governments using these connections to create conflict and fear. We can’t let that happen here. You two need the space and freedom to discover what this connection means without worrying about the ministry breathing down your necks. I’d never be able to live with myself if one day I wake up and you two have disappeared to some deep dark level of the DoM, never to be heard from again.”
Draco had been furious. Of course, he had been furious. He had thought he’d wait for Harry to write so that he wouldn’t feel too pushy, too needy, too consumed with his moments of pleasure, too shocked and unburdened by the release.
Draco hummed in agreement, and Harry was drifting away into a dream, warm and cosseted against Draco’s side, the wind still howling around the snowbanks at the edges of the hollow, the night full of thick clouds that belied the moon.
There was silence for a long moment while they digested the information. Harry seemed a bit stunned that Snape apparently paid him some kind of compliment on his morality.
Harry wanted to reach out and touch him, comfort him, let him know he didn’t think anything else of him than admiration for having lived through it. But his hands clutched his mug instead, and his throat went dry, the silence between them stretching out into the darkest corners of their room.
It was hours later, the sun sinking rapidly in it’s shallow arc across the sky, that Harry walked back into Tenebris Hollow. He picked up his mittens where he dropped them by the stoop, and pushed open the door.
“What you gave me wasn’t enough for this week.” He hissed. He had a hard time controlling the sudden surge of anger within him. He had spat the words, even though he hadn’t needed to. He was the only one there this early in the afternoon.
“I brought it, Harry.” Came Luna’s soft call, singsong and instantly calming, and Draco could visibly see Harry’s shoulders dropping down, defeat marring his posture. He slunk into the room like a kicked dog and took up his position, arms and legs crossed in his yellow armchair so tightly it looked as if it may take several years to untangle them.
Harry’s mouth was hanging open. “You’re friends with Neville? Neville Longbottom? Our Neville? And Neville saw you have a panic attack?”
“You know, being close to someone, physically. It’s not something I do - not since the war.” He felt his face flush and knew he must be hot pink.
“But what are you wearing?” Draco was still confused as he followed Greg into the very eclectically decorated home. Nothing matched. It was an explosion of colour, of mismatched furnishings, of house plants in strange containers, and inspirational quotes painted on the many coloured walls. It was slightly overwhelming at first, as was the garden, but as he moved through the house behind Greg, he thought it was very suited to Luna and what she did.
He came with a loud cry, his orgasm washing through him as if pulled by a lunar tide. He fucked up into his fist, riding the last of the receding waves until the sensation was almost overwhelming and his cock was nearly flaccid again. He lay there feeling elated with his breakthrough. Floating on a cloud. The shame that normally broke through his post orgasmic haze only danced on his periphery, unable to gain entry into the hallowed space he had cultivated during his explorations.
. That it was real. That had been beautiful and extraordinary. And okay.
Nearly every blood magic related potion he tried to incorporate the thestral blood into seemed to increased the efficacy. And what’s more, he couldn’t seem to find the same caveats the unicorn blood held. He sat hunched over his notes, scribbling theories and results frantically at the kitchen table. He often got up and raced over to his potions bench. He was beginning to wonder if he should be testing thestral hair and saliva as well. All the while, Harry was an ever present entity in the little cottage, making sure Draco didn’t skip meal times or forget to take breaks. He even helped with scanning the small ancient texts looking for clues and deciphering the sometimes vague meanings.
______________
The house reeked of dark magic, a scent so similar to the metallic aroma of blood that Harry placed it easily, instantly, the coppery odour sticking to his palate, as if he had just developed a nosebleed. Any trace that the Order had met here, worked here, even that they had attempted to clean, was gone, and the dust lay thick across everything Harry could see illuminated in the single dim light of the entryway. Harry took a tentative step forward, his foot landing silently amid a little cloud of dust. He sighed as another of the old light fixtures on the wall sparked to life, casting a second sphere of the dim, yellow glow. It seemed the house was doing as little as possible, as slowly as possible for it’s new master.
Malfoy.
When Harry was done doing whatever it was he was doing, he came back to where Draco stood with wide worried eyes and started pulling his own clothes back on. “I don’t think we’re alone.” Harry said quietly. “But with the charms I just put up, they won’t know we’re here.”
“I know.” he groaned petulantly.
“Yeah…” Harry pushed out, awkwardly, yet looking relieved. “Sorry, I meant to mention it— I just— didn’t know if I was going to take it. But, then— then, I thought of Orelia and how she had cast her first
At the edge of the clearing, near the copse of blackthorn trees, he caught sight of a silvery figure. He watched the small wolf, with it’s large and pointed ears, tip it’s head back, nose to the sky, another carrying howl across the dark of the forest. At the sight of it, Harry felt his fear fade. There was something familiar. Something comforting about the way the little wolf stood so graceful and resolute in the snow. It was not a timber wolf. Not a wolf of the north, slight and small and with long and dainty legs, howl so much more like song. He walked to the door and pulled it ajar, the wind instantly spilling into the warmth of the cabin, snowflakes whipped up from around their single step beyond the door and forming eddies in the air around Harry’s bare legs.
He turned, looking over his shoulder, seeing Malfoy standing at the edge of the stoop, not wanting to interfere, looking decidedly uncomfortable.
Draco could sense Harry’s mounting distress. Could feel the prickle on his skin. Could taste the tinge of metal on his tongue. It mirrored the same acrid sense of panic Draco could feel in the pit of his stomach, and he was desperate to sooth it away.
Harry rested his chin on his knees and hugged them to himself. Sirius’s huge personality and unapologetic lust for life was shining through, even in these little scraps of correspondence. It was unfair that he had died. It was painful, still, but knowing he had spent his last years being playful and in love, writing letters and having secret romance, it warmed Harry. It seemed to lay salve along a wound that had been open so long he hardly even noticed how much it hurt anymore.
Pointedly not looking at Harry he finally asked. “How much do you know about patronuses, Potter? Specifically those that change or those that match with someone else’s?” He was using his clinical voice again, but his insides told a different story.
Draco apparated just beyond the iron gates of the Hogwarts grounds and saw Hagrid standing there waiting to let him in.
“Okay. Harry.”
Draco nodded and hummed as he scratched a few more notes. “I think that’s fair. But, maybe, regardless we should talk about what this means moving forward. If you are going to learn to harness the magic that’s returning to you, we might have to consider the possibility that you’ll need to find lodgings in a wizarding area. The last thing we want is for you to be fined by the ministry for accidental magic in front of muggles.”
Hours later, as the wind picked up and whistled around the frozen fields of the hollow, Harry awoke with a start. The fire had died down, lingering coals glowing red in the bed of ash, the cold seeping into the cracks and corners of the cabin. Harry rubbed the sleep from his swollen eyes, his mind prickling with the sense that something had wrenched him from sleep. Something sinister.
The two of them tore after one another, chasing and being chased, flying higher and higher, looping, diving, showing off, and laughing.
To his left, he heard Robards say he assumed Seamus’s spellwork had gone awry, leading to another of his infamous explosions. Harry’s mouth was hanging open, his hands balled so tightly into fists that his nails drew blood on his palms. He wanted to stand up for Seamus, to explain, to tell someone that he had done it. It was him. It was his fault. It was an accident. But the words didn’t come. Instead, he felt consumed with fear.
“Of course you are.” Severus said, regaining composure. “Any other male platonic friends you care to share about?”
“Guilty-”
“It’s fine, it’s not like it’s not something we discuss as Healers, you know. You’re not the first person who’s struggled with lack of desire.” Draco was resorting to putting this in the context of work to keep the distance between them safe, and comfortable, and not too intimate. Harry watched him, and noted the change in his demeanor.
Harry froze, his mouth too full of the sticky soft buzzing to speak. Everything felt thick and slow and intangible.
He pulled Harry to him, not wanting to let this feeling pass him by, to hold on to Harry and share his joy. The sounds of the coming night rose around the cottage and the thestrals nickered their familiar chatter as Draco threaded their fingers together and let the moment hang between them, heavy and full of promise. Full of their future and the love they had for each other. Full of all of the ways they had survived and woven their lives together with magic and trust.
“Are you okay?” Draco asked, resting a tentative hand on the suddenly tight set of Harry’s shoulders, doubt momentarily clouding his arousal, his confidence.
Teddy did as he was told, and Harry turned to him, grinning.
Coming into the clearing, he was surprised to see Harry in the garden, pulling weeds with a look of deep concentration on his face, looking far less ill than he had since they came back from their outing to Grimmauld Place.
“Well said, Severus.” Nodded Dumbledore solemnly. “Like I’ve told you before, Harry, I knew at a young age that I could not be trusted with power, and yet I continually found myself in possession of it. And, every time I did, I abused it. You and Draco will do much better than I ever did.”
, he made a hasty exit. He needed someone to talk him off the ledge.
She maneuvered an arm out from one of the babies to uncover them as Draco extricated himself from the group hug.
“The prodigal son returns.” He heard the soft snarky voice of Severus and couldn’t help but smile as he approached the portrait and pulled out a chair in front of the desk.
He had raised his wand and allowed the memory of Harry comforting him after his nightmare to rise to the surface. Filling his heart and his soul with a feeling of contented acceptance and security. Even if the circumstance wasn’t romantic, it held the profound feeling of being safe and loved. And, although that memory wasn’t particularly joyous, it was overwhelmingly positive. A testament to how far Draco had progressed in overcoming his fear of closeness, of letting others in. He had asked for comfort and received it, without judgement. After he let the memory fill him and warm him down to his very bones, the thestral flew easily from within him and out through his wand.
Harry didn’t say anything, but smiled into his freshly steeping mug of mint tea, the chip radiantly familiar in the lip by the handle. He reached for the mug he had prepared Draco and passed it to him silently, watching Draco sniff at it, obviously still peppered at the audacity of his own knitting.
And with each passing second, Harry felt himself holding stronger, on surer footing, more in touch with his limbs and the sense of his own body, his own self. And it was glorious, to feel so in control. To know that he had met with the moment of weakness that would have broken him, would have stolen him, and had survived it. Today was not his day to relapse. Today was just another day in recovery. A day he had mastered.
“Three?” Draco asked, flipping through the pages of the file, Sprigg’s familiar scrawl in the margins, the notes of the obstetric healers and midwives lacing the pages.
Draco froze at the sound of Luna’s voice, feeling like a trapped animal. His joints creaked in protest as he crawled out of his den of blankets and shuffled towards to the door. He was not prepared to face anyone in his condition, let alone Luna and her knowing eyes.
He let himself fall backwards onto the bed, his legs still dangling off the edge of the mattress, a huge grin on his face amid the cloud of dust and feathers that flew up around him.
Harry followed Draco’s outstretched hand from his lion to canis major, and saw the legendary brightness of the dog star, his heart straining with the longing for his godfather. His eyes reflexively burned with tears at the thought that all these years he’d had a star and Harry had never thought to look to it.
Draco watched as Harry seized a fistful of dirt from the ground and attempted to fling it away from himself, only managing to hit his own face with the crumbling clump of earth, exploding with a sonorous, “FUCK you, you piece of shit
Charlie broke the kiss. “I should light the fire.” He said still smiling. “Come sit.” He lead Draco to the couch and lit a fire in the grate. Turning back to Draco he grabbed his hand and pulled Draco down on top of him as he lay back on the couch. Draco could not believe this was happening. He was laying on top of a Weasley in a front of a fire in a Romanian forest surrounded by Dragons. How was this his life? Their kisses began taking on a more desperate and eager quality, and Draco could hear the familiar buzzing in his head, the panic such closeness heralded. Charlie’s hands were running up Draco’s back beneath his shirt and pressing eager fingertips into his hips. Draco could feel Charlie’s erection straining against him through their layers of clothing, and he felt in over his head.
“Is this okay?” Harry whispered.
“Try this.” Harry’s voice was soft in his ear, goosebumps erupting down his neck.
. Okay? This is as real as it gets.”
“I thought of you. Of these last few months.” Harry said, softly now, his bright green eyes searching Draco’s pale grey ones. “Of how you believed in me and trusted me enough to help me. Of how you gave me the space to be who I am, the space to even figure out who that is. I’ve never had that before.” He paused, and licked his lips nervously. “I thought it was over, my life, I thought I was never going to be anything but a pawn in a game I didn’t know how to play. But, you saved me and, fuck, you did so much more than that, you showed me how to have a life worth living. How to be honest, with myself first.” Harry’s green eyes were bright and emphatic and he stepped closer, his hands just nearly grazing the bottom edge of Draco’s sweater, their foreheads almost close enough to touch.
Draco sat staring, lost in thought, until the tinkle of the bell at the front door jarred him out of his befuddled reverie. Moments later Hermione was being led into the exam room by Juniper, and the door was being shut quietly behind them. Draco smiled at her with a raised eyebrow and gestured for her to sit in the large plush armchair beside his desk.
Her voice was sad, heavy, but she continued at a clipped pace.
He allowed himself to feel everything. Every desire, every need, every pull of magic that wrapped around them. The hope, the affection, the protectiveness, the pride he felt in Harry, all swirled in his chest as he breathed in air that smelled and tasted of Harry. Every one of his senses felt saturated in this man as he lay there, eyes barely open, just breathing him in. Why did it have to feel this good?
Draco sniffed and wiped the unbidden tears that threatened to spill over as Luna moved towards the kitchen with an easy gait. She had never been to Draco’s flat before, but she seemed to know how to get around.
Harry pulled Draco’s letter back toward himself and flipped it over, summoning a pot of ink and quill from the living room without even looking up. The quill flew right into his hand and he dabbed the inkpot quickly to scribble onto the back of the page.
Draco grabbed his night things and went to change in the small wash closet in the corner of the cottage and do his evening ablutions. When he came back out, the room was feeling warmer and it was filled with the soft sound of Harry’s breathing. It was oddly soothing.
Suddenly he was sweating. He should be happy right? This is what he wanted? He realized he was shaking slightly. It was like the bottom had fallen out of his stomach. Did he even have a stomach? Or a body for that matter?
“But, no one has reported being
He knelt in the snow, his chest burning with the cold, his body shivering, but his mind elsewhere. What had gone wrong? What had just happened?
Now he was here. He was here, and he was ready to move through the motions of formal tea in the drawing room with his mother and be talked at about how she was waiting for grandchildren.
“It was Sirius’s.” Harry croaked out, sounding suspiciously like he was on the verge of tears. “But I… I ruined the memory of him in it.” Harry brought his hands up to his face and pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, breathing deeply, obviously struggling to keep himself together.
He smiled, finally realizing why he had been led here. They had brought him to help. To heal. He had healed that male thestral’s gashes all that long while ago, and they had remembered.
“Moony wanted me to ask you to check in on Teddy, if you can.”
“I wanted to use Sirius for his power, as Death Herders are want to do with Grims. And Sirius wanted to help, but I was not forthcoming with what that meant, and he was unaware of the dangers it posed to him. I couldn’t take any chances in him backing out.”
Harry watched him go, his magic swirling around him gently, warming him against the cold, replacing the comforting warmth of the winged stallion. The sun shone down a bit brighter, and Harry lifted his face to the light of the new day.
“That’s why we brought knitting.” Draco said smirking, reaching over and squeezing Harry’s leg comfortingly.
“Yes, I think there’s a dearth of information on the concept of consent and gifting with unicorn blood— with many manner of creatures, in fact. That being said, the superstitions around unicorns tend to make people uncomfortable.”
He could feel Harry’s mounting agitation, sure he was thinking along the same lines as Draco.
“But why do you have a scar? Couldn’t they fix that?” Harry asked as if he was solving a riddle instead of discussing death.
Do you have access to rare magical plants such as wiggentree, gentian root, bog myrtle, or tormentil?
. Instead, Draco felt nothing but a well of relief. A morbid gratitude, of sorts. Reverence.
Harry wrinkled his nose and laughed away the nerves, committing to the discussion. “I was using and I never wanted sex. I never thought about it, I never had any desires, nothing. It’s been … months and months at least, before I even got here. It’s like that whole part of me was numbed and I didn’t even notice.” He paused, his eyes closed and his head tilted back, soaking in the afternoon sunlight that dappled their little garden. “And then this story goes and gets me hard like I’m still a teenager reading a naughty scene in a racy book. I had forgotten, almost, what it was like. I had forgotten about sex and wanting someone.”
“But?” Lucius’s face was turning more stoney by the second, his gaze forbidding and hateful.
He did the right thing, in the end. Harry knew it to be true. It wasn’t time, not yet. This was just the beginning.
He heard footsteps approaching and felt Harry’s arm brush against him as he sat down next to Draco. He didn’t say anything. Just sat there, and let his presence comfort him. He hadn’t even realised he was craving comfort, but he really was. Fuck those rose bushes, honestly, he thought.
“Oh no, his inhaler!” Teddy grabbed his bag from the back of the room, then hugged Harry quickly on his way out. “Thank you, Harry! See you on Tuesday!”
“I’m not offended.” Malfoy cut Harry’s rambling off. “I am gay. I just am not really a fan of people making assumptions about me. Aside from this particular thing, people tend to assume the worst when it comes to me.” Malfoy sniffed, looking haughty.
Draco felt so terrified by what their patronuses meant, by what that meant about Harry’s feelings towards him. He was already filled with a sense of weighted dread by the memory he had used to produce the patronus. When Harry first prompted him to pull his happiest memory he immediately thought of one hundred different memories he had made in the last few months with Harry. He had instantly chastised himself for the foolishness of wanting to use one of those memories. Surely, he could think of something joyous on his one. Something without Harry.
Persephone soon disappeared silently down the hall, file in hand.
Harry laughed. “You’re right, I’d have been right pissed off with you. Disappear for two days, and get lost in a cave? Unbelievable.” He huffed, getting to his feet. “Well, are we going or what?”
“Sorry?” He asked apologetically, looking up from the cutting board to see 6 eyes curiously trained on him.
“…non timebis portenta vultus eorum…”
, Potter’s
She gave him a rare smile, tucking her handkerchief back beneath her robes.
Draco apparated back to the hollow just after dark, ladened with shopping bags for Christmas, some new yarn and knitting needles, and a few snacks they couldn’t procure from the house elves. He felt lighter after his appointment, but nervous about the conversation he was about to have. Beatrice reminded him that open and clear communications about emotions and feelings were an important skill, no matter how uncomfortable. Damn that woman, he thought, feeling so grateful to have her as a resource.
The sun broke over the horizon at their backs, its weak rays doing little to warm them. They strode with determination towards the stone monolith bathed in red daylight. He wondered for the millionth time why on earth he was here, hoping lightning would deign to strike him down before he reached the entrance.
Walking through the door and up to the bed, Draco saw, and smelled, immediately that this was dark, dark magic. The unmistakable stench of musty copper, with an undertone, one Draco hadn’t experienced before as it was specific to this curse. Its signature was sinisterly floral, but sickeningly so, like cheap perfume was dumped in a bucket of blood. He grabbed the file to scan what potions had been given over the last four days and groaned aloud.
.” He said, his voice dropping an octave as the truth of what he said hit him. How rare it was that he told the truth, these days. What a sad state he was in that it was his door knocker that coaxed it out of him. It had gotten into the habit of asking him existential philosophical questions whenever he came home, and Harry did his best to be honest with the little snake. Who else did he have, really?
“Fuck you.” Draco said, his voice even. “This is the thanks I get for nearly getting fucked by a Weasley. You’re no better than the blood purists who won’t have my mother to tea after saving Potter’s life.”
Harry stood and levitated the tree, shrinking it and carrying it into the cabin easily, then restoring it to its original size, propped up with charms meant to hold until New Year’s. It took up nearly all the space they had, crowding the kitchen table and their beds, but it smelled incredible, and filled Harry with a sense of holiday cheer and the feeling that not all was lost. Draco needed time. He needed space. He needed the ability to decide for himself that what he had with Harry was okay, that it would be good. And Harry could take this time to show him that it would be. He wouldn’t rush him.
Ominous, thought Draco. Greg only ever asked him to his favourite cake place when he wanted a favour. But he didn’t like how they had left things at the Ministry after Draco had bailed him out. Greg had been embarrassed and didn’t want to hear Draco’s suggestion that he get help.
“That fucking—
“What?” He asked.
“No. I— I tend to avoid the magical community to tell you the truth— coming from the purebloods on my dad’s. My grandmother on my mother’s side was a muggle. Stayed with her most of my childhood after parents found out I wouldn’t be going to Hogwarts.”
A choked, bubbling sound interrupted his musings, and Harry dropped his boots to the floor, the textbook skidding across the desk surface. Winston had his hands up to his face in a vain attempt to stem the tide of blood that was streaming down from a nose that could only be broken, bruises starting to creep along the soft expanses of tissue below his eyes.
“Your mother tells me you’ve found love— tell me, is it the Parkinson girl? Your mother won’t say. You know Draco, her family has so many connections— ”
His godfather. Sirius. That’s who this magic belonged to. And a ripple of pain cut so quickly and sharply through Harry, he sucked a breath in. For how much he missed him still sat so close to the surface, grief he had never known had to abate.
“You don’t have to keep it on you if you don’t want, I just wanted to do something for you, for everything you’ve done for me. You made me feel safe, you deserve the same.” Harry shrugged, feeling supremely self conscious.
“Ready?” Harry asked, holding the spoon towards Draco.
Draco rolled his eyes and started to clear away their dinner.
Again, the same earth shaking effort, rolling waves of magic eddying through the house, surrounding them, before another silence. This one longer than the first. Draco stopped pacing, Harry gripped his spatula and stood still as stone. Again they stared at one another. Waiting.
“Lovely, dear, thank you.” She said without looking at him. After an awkward pause in which Draco didn’t respond, she sighed heavily and finally looked at him to see what must have been very obvious annoyance and probably hurt etched into his face. Realising her mistake she leaned over to grab the shawl and unfolded it to study it closer.
He promptly shut the book.
Draco went over his research from top to bottom starting with the unicorn conundrum and his (and Potter’s) theory on soul purity, finally ending with the thestral blood and his nonexistent theory on that. Severus nodded along and asked sporadic questions.
“Don’t you think it’s weird that we were both master of the Elder Wand? And then it was your wand that finished him off?” Harry looked pensive.
Maybe it was the life-debt that he owed Potter, but Draco felt it was paramount to keep him alive— even it if was against his will.
Malfoy nodded slowly, and Harry reached up to lightly rub circles on his upper back, doing his best to be comforting through the thin material of Malfoy’s grey t shirt.
“I needed to come see you both as soon as I found out.” She let out in a shaky breath. “The books—” Trailing off as she leaned over to pull them out of her bag, the sound of clattering and clinking echoing from it as she rummaged. Draco and Harry exchanged confused and worried looks.
“Well—” Hermione said, smiling at him in an indulgent sort of way, like she didn’t know what she should have expected from her Harry, “
She smiled, the lines around her eyes crinkling in a way that told Draco she spent a lot of time smiling. “You were such an unusual birth. Did your mother ever tell you about it?”
“They do keep me busy, yes. There’s only two of us that specialize in blood curses so the haematology department is always understaffed— Considering most of what we deal with is blood curses, it’s a bit ridiculous. And my counterpart leaves much to be desired if I’m honest.” Draco huffed.
To his left, he heard Robards say he assumed Seamus’s spellwork had gone awry, leading to another of his infamous explosions. Harry’s mouth was hanging open, his hands balled so tightly into fists that his nails drew blood on his palms. He wanted to stand up for Seamus, to explain, to tell someone that he had done it. It was him. It was his fault. It was an accident. But the words didn’t come. Instead, he felt consumed with fear.
He tried and tried to pull his happy memories forward, but thoughts of Harry dying of an overdose, trapped in the tomb of Sirius’ old bedroom, clouded his thoughts.
“Lumos.” Malfoy said softly into the dark just behind Harry, his wand casting the illumination that Harry’s had held moments before.
“Oh, yeah thanks.” Harry said, pulling his gaze from Draco. He took a deep breath and reigned himself in, concentrating on stowing and controlling the prickling sensation within his hands, for now. He scanned the crowd again, smiling to himself at Neville with his grandmother, who’s large vulture hat was now obstructing the view of a small ministry witch he didn’t recognise. At last, Susan Bones had slid into the witness box, and the Wizengamot seemed properly seated and arranged. Percy, in his chief warlock robes of pastel blue, was standing at his designated bench, calling for order, setting out final reminders to the press to remain silent and for spectators to resist from any commentary, jeering or unnecessary facial expression.
It was when his thoughts had focused on his companion that Harry felt the chill of the season settle on him, and he had roused himself to trek down the mountain. He spent far too much time these days reflecting on the feelings he might be having. The strange stirring within himself that Draco was becoming more than an enemy turned friend, more than a focus of his admiration, and much more akin to the epicenter of his world.
“Hermione!” Came a familiar voice from just inside the house.
“And then I died. I chose to die. It was the only way, at the time, to allow him to kill me. To surrender. Here in this very forest.” He said, laying back and stretching his arms above his head, closing his eyes.
“You found my constellation.” Draco said shyly, looking over at Harry’s cheeky grin, illuminated in the light cast by his anthropomorphic charms.
“Get out, Potter. Get the fuck out.” Draco hissed, pulling his blankets back from Harry, staring daggers at him. His eyes were dark and cold and Harry really was drowning this time, lost in the tempestuous tide that was Draco Malfoy.
Harry rolled his eyes and smiled, picking up another book and leafing through it. “Fine, you prickly prat, don’t tell me then.”
of all people— what was she
“Longbottom, I’m gay, whatever you’re trying to say shouldn’t be this difficult— unless you have some rare fetish no one can satisfy.” Draco said with mock impatience, trying to project his usual cold indifference.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at Teddy’s enthusiasm for his friend. Another orphan. Another of the abandoned boys who ended up at Hogwarts. A Slytherin. Named Thor, no less.
He scribbled onto a green one.
He couldn’t believe he was crying in a greenhouse in France, being soothed by a serpent slaying Gryffindor.
Harry smirked and shook his head, but didn’t answer.
He was standing now and striding over to grab his basket and broom sticks, “But you could have fucking kept all of it.” and he marched out of the room without a backward glance.
Harry stared at the parchment for some time, tapping the quill and jiggling his foot beneath the desk. This was harder than he had expected, even.
“It’s okay.” Malfoy said, his voice even and healing next to Harry’s gruff mumblings. “It will get easier, even if it doesn’t seem like it now. Eventually, you’ll be able to make tea with honey without thinking about it. You’ll find yourself doing lots of things that might seem impossible now.”
The issue came in finding a unicorn in the wild that had died of natural causes before the materials expired. It was incredibly rare and unrealistic to rely on as a source. He wanted to explore the use of unicorn blood in curing blood curses from freely given blood. But, how does one persuade a unicorn to freely gift their blood? He thought he knew someone who might have an idea.
Harry sighed a relieved sound, nodding, before pushing himself up. They divested one another of their clothes, quickly, tossing them aside, the cold air of the room prickling at their skin.
Harry who was laying on his back, with his arm around Draco who in turn had his head on Harry’s chest and was curled into his left side, his arm and leg slung over him. Draco who was becoming more and more aware in his awakening state of the erection he was pressing into Harry’s hip, and after shifting subtly, noticing the hardness pressing into the inside of the thigh that was draped over Harry.
Actually, every Friday is Auror Pub Night. Like clockwork, they leave the office and head to the pub, get drunk and celebrate whoever’s locked up someone big and bad recently. Every week, Harry gets the routine shoulder slap and “see you at pub night, Harry!” usually with finger guns from one, two, sometimes three different coworkers. Harry always smiles and laughs, confirming his attendance with a thumbs up, hating the sick ritual and the fact that he’s not even sure of the people’s names who are asking him.
Reaching the headmaster’s door he knocked and heard an imperial, clipped voice command, “Come in.”
“What happened?” Harry was already by Hermione’s side, his eyes drawn instantly to the dark blood stains that spread across his uniform.
Draco was pulled from his dream by the sound of a guttural moan, and he realized, after a moment of horror, that the sound had came from his own throat. Good Godrick, he had been dreaming of Harry. Again.
______________
Draco nodded.
It was only after finally leaving a very distracted Hermione flipping feverishly through giant tomes on her desk, and regaining the light of day outside the ministry, that Draco heard it for the first time since the morning he left the forest. The familiar rustle and flap of leathery wings.
He hadn’t quite gotten the hang of it since acquiring the supplies from Luna, as he only managed to pick it up on his rare breaks, but he was hoping that with a few weeks of solitude in the forest he would figure it out. Winters in the forest were cold, after all— he would need all the socks, scarves, hats, and jumpers he could pile on to his thin frame.
“It’s more complicated than that.” Harry said, clearly still hanging on to the guilt.
He checked Potter’s breathing. After confirming that,
Where would he even find Potter now? Without stopping to think about what he was doing he flipped feverishly through the file to the personal details to find an address. It felt like a gift from the universe that he knew exactly where to go.
Elio was born in what remained of the shared caul, quickly followed by the placenta. “He was slow to join us, after he was born.” Porter told them.
“Can you stand? Do you think you could walk?” Draco asked. He didn’t want to risk disapparating them both, Harry was obviously unstable, yet he was feeling antsy to get back to the cottage before dark and they only had just over an hour of light left. He heard the thestrals enter the clearing behind him.
“Are you ready?” he asked, his grey eyes calm and collected, a refuge in the dark chaos of the house where Harry had died.
It was nearing midnight when the last of the patronus responses came in. Luna’s hare had just faded into silver vapour, her voice trailing after it, “We’ll be there in 30 minutes, dear”, when Harry began pacing like a caged animal. Draco didn’t feel much better, but instead of pacing, he sat still as stone, taking in the details of the room as Hermione furiously scribbled notes.
Beatrice had told him, in gentle and soothing tones, that it was because he carried too much responsibility from his childhood and took on even more as an adult. That the weight of his past was so immense, that even small decisions, like ordering takeout, felt like slaying nine dragons.
To be himself, but to feel… human. He could be flawed and scared and struggling and still be Harry. Malfoy, in his own way, had given Harry permission to exist as both, and to not be judged for it.
“I don’t have to.” Harry started, looking self conscious. “It’s just you’ve been doing all the cooking and I thought I could return the favour.” He wasn’t looking at Draco.
Harry didn’t move. Didn’t reply. His magic felt still. Like the silence before a storm. Draco knew by sheer instincts to change the subject and allow Harry some space to process the information in silence. “How do we protect ourselves. How do we keep this power out of the wrong hands?”
“We’re not running anymore, remember?” Draco said softly, taking his hand, and Harry huffed an incredulous laugh, still not looking at Draco. “I get it.” He pressed on. “I get it, okay? Stop running from this— from me.”
“Well, when you put it that way—” Harry laughed. “Sometimes. Sometimes I miss it. It was home, you know? Probably will always be in a way. I’ve never really had that before.” He paused, mulling over his words. “I guess I’ve just been thinking of something Dumbledore told me once, help will always be given at Hogwarts for those who ask for it. The surety of that thought makes me miss it.”
After a moment, however, the anger subsided down into the fact that Harry had people who cared, and who worried, and who had a pretty valid reason to be worried. He had come here to die once, that was true, he couldn’t fault them for remembering that.
ceremony. A house warming party, of sorts. Officiating their relationship. Their roles as Death Herders. Their home in the forest.
Harry just looked completely shocked. “Is that why you’ve been completely unreasonable for days? Because you have... feelings for me?”
“Oh no, sorry, these are the other two witnesses. You remember Susan?” He gestured towards the mousy woman in a plain brown dress with frizzy blond hair and freckles. Then to the other vaguely familiar face wearing deep mauve robes with gold bangles that stood out stunningly against her dark skin, a crown of white Zinnias atop her braids. Ron continued, noting Draco’s black expression, “and this is Hestia Lamadaya. She was a few years under us.”
“And I still had my magic, and I was afraid I would go apparate off somewhere to use again, but I didn’t want to. I mean. I did. I really wanted to…” He looked up at Draco, his bright green eyes almost apologetic. He was sorry for having the thoughts, and he wanted Draco to know. To see that he felt guilty. It was clear on his face.
“You could have told me, Harry. But, I’m glad you did now.” Ron said, his voice thick with emotion. “Nothing is worse than losing you. Nothing.”
The cowardly part of him thought he might just try walking straight past them, as if he were in a hurry, and hope for the best, but this older self, the part that had been significantly galvanised by Harry’s existence, stayed his footsteps in front of Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
Harry stood there leaning against the wall, arms crossed with his takeaway number in his hand. He was looking down at his feet which tapped impatiently. He huffed a few times in quick succession, apparently frustrated. He looked ill.
He stood from his desk, stretching and scratching fingers through his mussed hair. Turning around, he faced the brewing bench that lined the wall opposite his desk. The bench itself held a row of large cauldrons, in varying stages of brewing, steeping, and curing. On the wall behind the brewing bench were a set of stacked shelves, on which rested a rapidly growing collection of bonsais.
He didn’t want to see Dumbledore today, with his enigmatic knowingness, nor did he want to discuss his relationship with Harry with
Harry’s eyes were burning questioning holes into Draco’s, but neither of them dare speak or break the unspoken spell that had settled around the house.
” Draco asked in mock horror, stifling his laughter. “Honestly, Longbottom, what do you think I’ll be doing out there?”
“Luna’s.” Draco said, softly. “He’s always at Luna’s. And here.”
The thought of his den, his refuge, resulted in a sharp, sickening pull deep in his viscera. He could feel his magic asking to apparate him right back there, straight through the wards of the Ministry. It felt so excited, strong, like it hadn’t for ages. Bold and resplendent at the mention of his godfather’s home. The house full of slithering pewter snakes.
Ron nodded and Harry watched him zone out happily for a moment, obviously thinking of his wife and daughter. Harry tried to not let the bitterness overwhelm him. He had treasures awaiting his return, too. He nodded to Ron and jogged back up the stairs and out to an apparition point. His shirt was sticking to his back.
” The little adder had uncoiled itself and was sliding around the knocker, peering down at Harry, forked tongue flicking into the air.
. Embarrassed all over again by his lack of desire.
Although he had returned to the Burrow the next morning and apologised, their relationship never recovered. He had spent months ruminating over his failure, filled with a sense of dread that somehow, after everything he had been through, something inside him was broken. He was broken. Deeply and profoundly.
Eventually, she murmured quietly, “The forbidden forest was almost on that list. Both of you almost didn’t come back. I’m fairly certain you two are the last Death Herders in Europe. In this entire area of the globe, in fact.”
It was too much. Everything. He couldn’t even set out to die. And now, Malfoy knew his secret. He’d probably already owled the Ministry. He would’ve lost his job, and it was only a matter of time before the press caught wind. Oh, and how he’d be destroyed by them, eaten alive, ridiculed, demonised. And the worst part, it would all be true. He’d have nothing to hold him on the course, he’d have no legs to stand on in refuting their claims. They’d call him pathetic and weak and lawbreaking scum. And he was. He really was.
“I see.” Draco really did see. He felt he could empathise. Maybe he was asexual too? Well, he supposed there was a difference in not wanting sex and not being able to have it. No, he wasn’t asexual, if his daydreams and want fantasies were anything to go by. “I guess we’re doomed to loneliness then.” Draco surmised with an empathetic smile.
He would just have to get over himself if he didn’t want to lose Harry, he thought to himself, resolve settling in his gut like a jagged rock.
So, it was one week later at Rose’s second birthday party, that he pulled her aside, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly with one hand while he shuffled about, his eyes on his feet.
“Sirius.” He slurred the name out of his mouth, drool pooling on his pillow.
“Just grab the plates, please?” Harry asked.
“Fuck” he managed to breathe out as Malfoy quickly closed the gap between them, grabbed his arm and apparated them away, not giving him a second longer to think on the absolute horrendous absurdity of the situation.
“Oh, Harry! That’s wonderful. Well, it’s great. And it’s great you told us! Oh that was not what I was expecting. Gods, Harry I really thought you were about to tell us something awful. But this, being gay, this is lovely. I’m so happy.”
“Well, when you put it that way—” Harry laughed. “Sometimes. Sometimes I miss it. It was home, you know? Probably will always be in a way. I’ve never really had that before.” He paused, mulling over his words. “I guess I’ve just been thinking of something Dumbledore told me once, help will always be given at Hogwarts for those who ask for it. The surety of that thought makes me miss it.”
Use your words Draco. Beatrice had given him the vocabulary to discuss these things. Be an adult. Be honest.
They were passing Neville’s shop and they could see him standing against his window display, standing intimately close to Hestia, speaking softly to one another, smiles big and bright and luminous in the soft dim lighting of the shop. She gently touched the outstretched leaves of a potted peace lily, Neville reached out and slipped his hand into hers. They looked nowhere else but at each other, as if the rest of the world could not possibly exist, couldn’t bare to interrupt the moment between them.
Above the rushing of air against frozen ears, Harry could hear the wingbeats behind him, could sense the dark shadow that fell between him and that brittle sun as Flea leapt from the ledge behind him, the giant beast swooping beneath him, then past him, coasting just beneath his outstretched hands as he fell, Harry’s fingers twisting into that ratty mane, gripping tight as the beast pulled them both from freefall, Harry’s knees sliding into place along Flea’s bony ribs, the two of them gliding out across the trees.
Closing his mouth, and slowly lowering the caramel away from his face, Draco turned his head slightly to the side and looked carefully at Greg. “Well, I’m glad you’ve finally come to terms with that.” Draco said evenly. The fact that Greg was an alcoholic wasn’t news, but Greg’s acceptance of his condition certainly was.
Harry placed a gentle, yet firm hand on Draco’s lower back, keeping it there while they filed in slowly, into the depths of Azkaban prison.
Oh god, he thought, panicking, what if he threw up right here at his desk? He couldn’t do it silently? Everyone was quietly shuffling papers around and making chit chat and it would be a cacophony of violent choking sounds if he let this happen here at his desk. He had to get up. He had to get to the loo. He had to get through today.
Until, that is, he thought of Harry himself. Before casting that third time, he allowed his mind to see the simple domesticity they had cultivated together, and before he knew it he was being flooded with all of the joy and struggle they had experienced in their time in the forest. It was shocking and overwhelming how visceral and emotive those memories were to him.
“Do you know what a Wiggentree is?” Harry asked, his eyebrow raised, keen to one-up Draco on something magical-theory related.
“You lousy cheat!” Draco yelled after him as he too dove towards the rock wall.
He had one hand on Harry’s face and the other tentatively gripping his shirt. Draco had pulled Harry down and over him so that he was straddling his groin, and Harry was valiantly trying his best not to sink the full weight of his hips down onto him, despite Draco’s clear invitation and the gentle, nearly insistent tug of his hand, fisted in his shirt. Draco was shocked by his own bravado, but he had never felt so sure, so safe. So open.
Harry only had his clothes, really, and many of his little carved figures, some half in progress, some finished. He decided to keep his knife, to keep working on them once at home. He had already slipped the sheet of meeting times and information from Luna, as well as Hermione's reply in the bottom of the box, safe and out of sight, out of mind.
Draco eventually joined Harry in his aimless floating. After a relaxing beat of silent drifting, Harry asked cautiously, “Can I ask why you’re wearing a shirt while swimming?”
Draco resisted the urge to squirm in his seat, as squirming was unbefitting of a Malfoy. Instead, he tapped his fingers on the table, stealing himself before looking up into Neville’s eager face. The bar they were situated in was Muggle and the smell of ale and cigarettes floated around him like a warm blanket. His cranberry juice was dripping condensation onto its coaster and he wondered vaguely why he kept choosing these muggle bars to meet up with his friend. Neville always bought Draco his cranberry juice without comment and drank ale, never whiskey, while they talked of potions, life, and magical theory, but never Draco’s love life, until now, apparently.
. After the owl had left with his response he quickly ran to his bathroom and promptly vomited.
Harry had never spoken to any of the other patrons, preferring to seat himself two thirds of the way down the bar, comfortably distant from the elderly mumbling gentleman at the front stool and the three snickering women taking up a booth in the back. He came for the drinks and the solitude, and that’s what he got.
“But, they decide who’s worthy of it.” Draco finally said, quietly, marvelling at the ash in his palm. All of his effort, his agonising, pointless. Lucius’s one last hope, gone in an instant.
“And you’re certain no one else can see them?”
Draco was dreaming. He was walking with Voileami in a frost covered graveyard. It was peaceful in the softly lit liminal space of the dream. Icicles formed on colossal rib cages and hefty femurs that scattered the clearing, jutted out from the frozen packed earth. Dragons, Draco’s mind supplied. It was a dragon graveyard. He was approaching a particularly large ilium, it’s curved shape sloping out of the snowy ground. He reached his hand out to brush his fingers along the smooth surface—
Draco found himself kneeling in the garden later that afternoon. His quick bath before lunch had been utterly pointless, as he was now covered in more sweat and dirt than he had been before. He was breathing hard and staring daggers into a hedgerow of roses he had unearthed under a gnarled sprawl of brambles and weeds. He felt personally offended, betrayed even, that this garden had been harbouring these dozen or so rose bushes within its midsts without Draco’s knowledge. He felt a sharp stab of anger at the thought of the rose bushes awakening after their winter slumber and going on to produce an array of heavily scented flowers to gawk at him every time he walked pass.
Greg grinned sheepishly, adjusting his tool belt. “Me and Weasley.”
This is how you keep them safe. How you layer them in your love, in your courage, in your sacrifice. This is how you protect the ones you love.
They had been at this for hours. Hermione had given up her Sunday at home with her family to accommodate Draco’s increasingly frantic schedule. On top of everything, he had been meeting with Ron in the auror department regularly to go over his testimony, an experience he honestly wished he could obliviate himself from. It’s not that Ron had been mean, or crass, or even inherently oppositional as Draco had expected. No, Ron had treated Draco like any other victim giving testimony, professionally detached. Draco had to walk Ron through all of his worst memories and experiences with Lestrange in gross and graphic details over several painstaking days.
Harry had grown so fond of watching him work, the humidity making his blonde locks stand up on end, the concentration ensuring a furrow in his so often haughty brow. Harry had sequestered himself away up on his top bunk and was re-reading The Quintessence of Debauchery for the fourth time. He had hidden it up above his bed in one of the little nooks behind a cross beam, and often took it out late at night, his wandless lumos creating a soft glow from his hands.
Draco did as he was told, feeling cautiously hopeful.
The thought scares him. Everything feels so out of control. Fear buzzes too, now, in his ears it’s growing louder and Harry is frantic to maintain his purposeful control. Frantic. And angry. So angry.
“You better believe I will. I want to know what in Merlin’s name you’re up to.” He goaded with a raised eyebrow.
______________
“Are you going to tell me why exactly you’ve been so thoroughly displeased as of late? I still don’t understand why you were so mad about your patronus.” Harry was speaking softly and cautiously, as if Draco might lash out at any moment. Which, to be fair, wasn’t off the mark for his behavior of late. Draco cringed inwardly at himself.
Draco thought carefully for a moment. “I can’t say why you’re seeing thestrals, not really, they’re strange creatures, I have to say. The one behind you is certainly not a hallucination. But, I am interested in learning more about this curse. Has anyone examined your curse since you were diagnosed?”
An arctic hare was burrowed deep into the bank by the thicket that opens into the blackthorns to the West. He could just see the set of cautious spoor leading to an upturned pile of snow. He imagined the hare, black nose and ears tucked deep into it’s thick fur, protected within the snow, waiting for the soft light of morning to emerge and scavenge for lichens and mosses, woody shrubs and the scant nutrients that lay hidden in the winter forest.
Harry blinked, the blush on his cheeks spreading down his neck and making him feel like the collar of his shirt was just a bit too tight, though it had been absolutely fine moments ago. He nodded, appreciating how Hestia could be so blunt, but in a way that made him feel safer, less ashamed. He knew she wouldn’t shy away from whatever he brought to the circle.
Draco was fueled with a desire to get away as fast as humanly possible. Surely, he was overreacting? It was normal to have morning wood? It was a normal response to existing with a penis? It had nothing to do with another person being in his bed, right? It certainly had nothing to do with who was in his bed. Right?!
Unice smiled. “You and that plant are something else.”
The answering screech ricocheted between trees. Flea swooped and dived, landing gracefully beside Harry, slipping his beaked nose beneath his outstretched arm. Harry ran his fingers down the familiar feel of his thick, matted mane and the bones that rippled beneath his leathery hide.
“Oh.” Draco said. It was such a Luna thing to do, so sweet, so supportive, so slightly invasive. He loved it. “Thank you.”
“What is happening?” Draco asked, with mounting confusion.
Draco stilled at the admission. He had always thought he was a bit of an outlier, having never spent the night in someone’s bed with whom he had chosen to do so. Opening his bed up to Harry last night had been a huge deal for him, but apparently it had been just as big of a deal to Harry as well.
After what felt like a searing eternity in the 9th layer of hell, Draco’s bravery and resolve broke. He stood abruptly and began clearing their plates.
“What kind of questions?” Harry cocked his head in curiosity.
“Panic? Like a panic attack?” Harry asked, watching Malfoy closely, making sure his own worry didn’t course through him and cause him to rub too fast, too frantically.
Harry was pulled back from his ethereal thoughts into something that felt far more real. More tangible. In fact, as the moments passed, he could feel himself laying on the floor. His hands brushed along the sheet that was over him and he realized, yet again, he was naked.
Sirius grabs Harry’s shoulders and leans back to look at him, eyes still crinkling and smile still broad and beautiful and seemingly unceasing on his features. Handsome and young and effortless, as Sirius was always meant to be.
Seeing what was underneath it he chuckled and said, “But, I can see now that you’re not dressed for dinner with a boring gay couple— no, you’re dressed for something far more exciting than that.”
The thought made him a little nauseous.
poetic.”
want to see.
After 20 minutes of hacking that grew more and more frantic and desperate, Draco was finally able to wrest the rose’s ball of roots from the earth and toss the mangled form of thorns and branches into a heap next to the compost pile of weeds. He sank back down on his knees in front of the hedgerow and resumed his pensive and angry staring. One down, another dozen or so to go.
Instead, Draco let go of his knees to sit cross legged. He looked down at his hands, feeling his lip tremble, his vision blurring with unshed tears. Luna reached out and pulled him into a hug. She smelled so familiar and so safe. And he ached with how much he had missed her without having realising it. He didn’t know how long he cried onto her shoulder, but his sobs eventually subsided and he found himself laying in her lap, her fingers running through his hair, a soothing comfort. This is why he loved Luna, Draco thought dazedly, she had no expectations, only love and empathy.
He left a concerned looking Harry in the garden and walked into the snow covered tree line without looking back, feeling Harry’s magic trail after him, rippling in his wake, questioning. His own magic eddied around him, calmer than he’d ever known it to be, swirling, picking up bits of detritus not yet covered in snow.
The sound of the lock clicking and doorknob turning interrupted Harry’s ruminating on what the fuck could possibly going on. The door to Harry’s left swung open, revealing none other than Draco Lucius Abraxas Malfoy. Fucking Malfoy.
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry. Equal parts annoyed and endeared that Harry was trying to order him about. He mumbled bitterly under his breath about bossy Gryffindors as he turned away from Harry’s grinning face to double check the stasis charm on their dinner.
Now Harry rolled his eyes and sat back in his chair at the kitchen table, sighing heavily, crossing his arms.
And Draco leaned down further to kiss his naked chest, and Harry felt the distinct hardness of Draco’s own cock pressed up against his abdomen, next to his own, and he groaned, no longer shy of how turned on he was, knowing Draco was feeling the same.
______
Draco hadn’t realised he was screaming until he was out of breath. He was covered in sweat and his hair and clothing clung to his damp skin. He was shaking as Harry whispered soothing things he couldn’t understand. His eyes darted wildly around the room, taking in the details as if he was bidden to memorise them. He was in the cottage. He wasn’t at the manor. He was with Potter, not Lestrange. He was safe. He was okay. He realised he had a vice grip on Harry’s shoulder, perhaps to steady himself, to anchor him to reality, or to keep him away. He wasn’t sure, but the realisation filled him with embarrassment and he let go quickly, rubbing his eyes as if to clean away the images of his dream from his mind.
“I’m working on it, Harry—” He said quietly, feebly, trying to make up for his dithering. “I’m working on my trauma. We can—” he trailed off, not knowing how to end the thought but not wanting Harry to think they could never be a normal couple because of him and his endless baggage.
Harry turned and greeted the last two students. Two more Slytherins. A boy and a girl, the boy simultaneously sullen and sneering, and Harry instantly recognised the pettiness that consumed Draco in his moments of self conscious ill-ease. The girl looked timid. Unsure. They both surveyed the others, then looked at each other with a knowing glance. The boy, whose thick curly hair had been pulled down into neat cornrows muttered “I told you.”
Whenever he had tried to pursue closeness with another or himself, his body would take over and go on automatic. While the rest of him seem to detach, go far away. Leave the scene. He could go through the motions but couldn’t really participate with it. There was a wall.
Due to the unusual name of the west London eatery, it became a hot spot for queer folk looking for a bite to eat during their pub crawls. It’s not that there was anything overtly
Harry nodded, looking defeated, his gaze finally falling down to the kitchen table.
“So, what now?” Draco finally asked after Hermione had pulled her wand from her messy bun, casting charms to erase her pages of careful notation.
His resolve thickened as his quiet breathing marked time, as he imagined the bright white room, where pain and fear didn’t exist, where Dumbledore had told him he could choose his own destiny. Yes, this is the choice he would make. He would go…
After they had eaten the picnic Harry had brought for them, and after Draco had word-vomited about everything he had done in the cave the last few days, they fell into a comfortable silence. Watching the thestrals swoop in and out of the cave entrance and the new foals wobble about on unsteady legs.
Harry took a deep breath, sighing it out slowly. “I just want to stay sober. I don’t know what that will take, or what I’ll have to change, or where I’ll even be living.” He looked down at their hands between them, under the thick duvet. “I try not to think too much about it, honestly. I’m scared I won’t do well back out in the real world.”
My partner and I are on day 35 or so of a military enforced national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic and we finally caved and started a podcast.
“But what are you wearing?” Draco was still confused as he followed Greg into the very eclectically decorated home. Nothing matched. It was an explosion of colour, of mismatched furnishings, of house plants in strange containers, and inspirational quotes painted on the many coloured walls. It was slightly overwhelming at first, as was the garden, but as he moved through the house behind Greg, he thought it was very suited to Luna and what she did.
They were on opposite paths, each working on one of the two large beds on the edge of the garden, the forest just on the other side. Harry had sat back on his heels, wiping the sweat from his brow after a particularly draining fight with a thorned valerian bush, it’s purple flowers giving off an offensive, rancid smell anytime they so much as swayed in the soft breeze. Eventually, Harry had won out.
Packed with people making their way to the various ministry departments, most didn’t recognise let alone engage with Draco. But, there were a few others that gave squawks of surprised and awkwardly shuffled away from him, causing many a curious eye to swivel in his direction. This attention, minor though it was, was causing the all too familiar flush of crimson to rise on his neck and cheeks, and he had broken out into another bout of uncontrollable sweating.
“Guilty.” Smith answered again.
Harry stood before the smouldering remnants of the fire, so recently extinguished, the smoke still curling up from blackened logs behind him. He glared at those gathered before him. He focused hard on control. On his anger. On tempering it just enough to tell them what they needed to hear. What they all desperately needed to hear. He took a deep breath, watching other, newer faces fill the common room from upstairs.
“Sometimes what people need is to have their hands held the whole way through, to not be left alone for even a second.” Persephone chimed in. “And, when that happens, we’re there, doing just that. But, that’s not what Luna needs, or what she wants. So, we’re here, where we’re needed, in the wings.”
“Harry.” Draco said with authority, and Harry stilled, looking caught out. Draco grabbed his shoulder and pulled him around to face him. Harry took another deep breath and nodded, his magic felt careful, controlled, wary. Harry had held himself at arms length for days now.
“Ah.” He said, surprised and impressed. “I hadn’t noticed that before. I wanted the pearl dust to counteract the sloe berries.”
In and out. Now punctuated with strange noises. A wheeze. A gurgle.
But it had changed. And the thought of Draco’s vacant expression flashed before him - the automated movements, Draco’s attentions turned from him to his body.
“I want my fucking yellow chair.” Harry demanded petulantly as they came into the hallway leading to the sitting room.
“How do we keep ourselves in balance? How do we stop ourselves from being like you?” Harry asked harshly.
“Uh huh.” Draco replied. “And when did you release the hippogriff into the kitchen?”
It was all he needed to say. Hermione would feel his magic, she would know he was fine. Better than fine. She would see the joy as soon as the little carving was submerged, as the little otter would come to life, splashing and winding through the water, flipping on her back and floating happily, a perfect replica of Alice’s lazy days in the summer stream. Hermione would know. It was the most comfort he could ever give her, far more meaningful than words.
“I’m glad you made it out alive.” Harry finally said, feeling inadequate and overwhelmed in the face of something so inhumane.
Chapter Six – Boundaries
“So,” Draco said at a lull in their conversation, feeling a little nervous, “I know we said we weren’t going to do gifts-“
Porter was in the kitchen boiling another kettle when he walked in. He could see the lines of her face cast in stark relief in the dull kitchen light, and Draco thought she must be older than he initially thought. The whites of her eyes made her eyes seem darker than they probably were, and her hair glowed against her olive skin, a halo.
Draco searched his face for a long while. Looking for anything. Any hint that Harry might be against it, or for it. Or have some feeling other than this unbearable
He couldn’t relax his shoulders until well past the Hogsmeade station. He reminded himself for the 50th time since leaving the house that apparition was the only suitable form of transportation.
“Sirius, I can’t keep living like this. I don’t know what to do.” Whether or not he said it aloud, he didn’t know.
“Yes, but what do the two places have in common?” Hermione asked.
He sent the little scrap of parchment on with Little Dipper, who seemed just as pleased with himself as Harry was, hopping to the windowsill and swooping out of sight.
Draco just snorted as he added logs to the fire and boiled a kettle for tea.
“Neither of you ever renounced your titles?”
He was chanting. Words soft and disheveled at first, the magic flighty and fickle.
“What do you want for the new year, Draco?” He asked, his face looked sleepy but content, soft and open.
“What are you doing in here?” Draco asked, curiosity maligning his anger.
Draco nodded and Hermione continued. “So, at 20 weeks on the dot, both pregnancies miscarried so quickly there was nothing to be done. Contractions came out of nowhere and it was done within the hour. The midwives and healers were baffled. They said they couldn’t find anything wrong. The baby and the placenta were perfectly formed, no anomalies, nothing— they just died.”
The summer before his 6th year had been full of shocking revelations, one of which was that he would never be safe in his childhood home again. Another, was that he was entirely responsible for his own safety. The adults in his life could do nothing to keep him safe.
“Oh, stop worrying for now, I’m not handing you over to the wolves just yet.” Malfoy said, his voice oddly protective and caring. Harry smiled, despite himself. It felt nice to be the one taken care of, for once, and he was thankful he could tell Malfoy these things. That they could be honest with one another.
“Well, yes. She’s—” He wanted to say, she’s mine, pay her no attention, but he was sure that sounded much too bizarre.
Draco’s eyes snapped to Neville’s feeling utterly lost in the proceedings. They couldn’t possibly know, could they?
Hanging plant baskets, furry throw rugs, a beaded hanging in the doorway to the bathroom, a poster of The Weird Sisters behind a lumpy brown sofa her and Hestia had found at a second hand shop, and a grey cat sleeping softly under the battered coffee table. The cat and the coffee table had been found together in a dumpster, and no one had the heart to tell Juniper she couldn’t have both.
“He’s right, Draco. You can talk to us.” Neville’s voice sounded softly from the shadows behind him. Luna and Neville seem to have snuck up on them without Draco realising.
“Oh, do shut up,
When he tried to reconcile this version of Harry with the boy he went to school with, he just confused himself further. That relationship had been fueled by righteous indignation, teenage hormones, jealousy, and a healthy dose of spite.
The wards were torn. Harry felt it instantly. His magic flitting around him, searching for any source of potential danger. Instead, it was only moments before he felt the bitter traces of what had ripped them to pieces. Draco’s magic. Cold and cruel and surgical in it’s precision.
“It became like a game for them, to choke me until I passed out, then have their way with me.”
Harry’s heart jumped into his throat, and he shimmied out of his blankets and over the edge of the bed. Draco was already lifting up the edge of his comforter as an invitation, and Harry’s body burned in excitement, anticipation.
“I asked if you wanted tea.” Harry asked seeming flustered, cautious, like he was approaching a dangerous animal. “I’ve only been calling your name for the last five minutes. Are you sure you’re alright?”
It was all fine and well, too, he reasoned, to wank himself raw thinking about the things he wish he could do with Harry, but he knew that faced with the reality of sexual intimacy, he probably would never be able to cope.
The pervasive thought dancing on the edge of his mind, that these were all things he could—
At the end of the quaint side lane that housed the practice, Harry turned and made his way up the central high street of the village. The sun was high in the sky and he let its warmth wash across his skin, a magic of its own, soft but powerful.
“Maybe you’re the one who’s supposed to be giving the help now.” Draco offered.
“You know, Draco dear, it’s awfully unbecoming that I can’t seem to get you to visit.” She said, her eyes like daggers, her voice like ice, and her words too sweet sounding. “It’s almost as if you don’t want to see me.”
Draco waved his wand in the familiar diagnostic movements checking the shimmering magical auras of his writhing, babbling patient. The potions were undoing the damage of poor healer management but did nothing for the exponentially worsening blood curse.
“Yes, I did say that.” He conceded. “But, it’s been brought to my attention that perhaps we should work on communicating our expectations. Especially about-” You can do this, Draco. He thought to himself. “About sex.”
When he reached the wrought iron entrance, he stopped. He knew he didn’t need to, it's not as if he needed someone to grant him entry. He knew if he kept walking the gates would melt around him and welcome him, the heir, into the sprawling expanse.
It was another hour before Harry canceled their protective enchantments and marched them back to the cottage in a strict and careful silence, not a single thestral to be seen along the way. Upon reaching the comfort of their forest home, Draco went straight for his bed and hid beneath his mountain of blankets and pillows for the remainder of the evening.
“Yes.” Draco said, glad he didn’t have to explain it more fully.
Reading and rereading the letter she sent, just to be sure he was seeing things clearly, he pulled the books out of the crate and onto his desk. One by one, he examined each cover in turn and marveled at his mother’s brazen attempts to make amends with her son. Sure enough, as the letter indicated, she had sent him smut. Old. Gay. Magic. Smut. Draco’s boggart laughed maniacally, and he almost joined in.
Harry sat up and reached for Draco, wrapped an arm around him.
“Your mother wrote to me, you know.” She said looking up from the tea tray, an unreadable expression on her face.
They stood in the cold, frost covered meadow just beyond the wiggentree, Draco in his sharp suit and long winter cloak, Harry in his leather jacket and black jeans. Their thestrals close by, ambling in lazy circles, Flea nibbling at a twig stuck in the frozen earth.
Draco looked back up at him and nodded. Harry jumped up and extended a hand to Draco, helping him to his feet before stepping back quickly and beginning to walk further away from the cottage. Draco brushed the detritus from his clothes and wiped the last of the tears from his face, trying to pull himself back together before going forward.
Harry pulled back, a huge smile on his face, and a mischievous glint in his eye.
“Don’t worry sweetheart, I like it when you scream,” was punctuated with Lestrange’s tongue licking the patch behind his ear.
He looked mortified at his admission, worrying his lower lip with his teeth, but powered on, still not looking up. “And then I was just thinking, like you seemed to know without too much fuss, and I thought it would be so much easier if people just got letters like we did from school. I didn’t know I was a wizard, and then I got a letter saying ‘hey, you’re a wizard’ and everything clicked for me. Like, it would be really great if I could get a letter saying, ‘hey, you’re gay’ or ‘hey, you’re straight, you just have an issue with your cock’ or ‘hey, you’re incapable of a sexual relationship stop thinking about it so hard’, or ‘hey, you’re asexual’, you know?” he rambled at his plate before looking up pleadingly into Draco’s face.
Draco apparated back to the hollow just after dark, ladened with shopping bags for christmas, some new yarn and knitting needles, and a few snacks they couldn’t procure from the house elves. He felt lighter after his appointment, but nervous about the conversation he was about to have. Beatrice reminded him that open and clear communications about emotions and feelings were an important skill, no matter how uncomfortable. Damn that woman, he thought, feeling so grateful to have her as a resource.
“Why did they name you Draco?” Harry asked softly, Draco laying back next to him to look up at the rest of the night sky.
He placed one of his hands over his mouth as he heard something heavy coming down the hallway, rhythmic but slow, solid clunking sounds. He heard big blowing breaths next, even felt the little gusts come tumbling, beneath the bottom edge of the door. He recognised the sound once he heard the shaking and stretching of those long, leathery wings. A thestral. It pawed the carpet outside the door twice before continuing along the hallway.
When he reached the end of the letter he just stared at it in disbelief. Unseeing. It was a long moment before he looked up at Harry.
“Tom called from the Leaky. Greg just left to go and get him.”
A thin wisp of silver smoke snaked from Draco’s wand tip and furled in on itself, winding around slowly, languidly. Draco’s face split into a soft smile, and he looked over to Harry, who couldn’t keep the grin off his face either.
He watched the smile pull at the corner of Draco’s mouth. Their love was undeniable. It was pooling around every word, every moment. It was beautiful.
“I don’t know what to write back.” Harry said, rubbing his face and worrying his bottom lip, looking back at Draco’s calm and steady grey gaze.
The cold followed him in, and the howling wind, the fire extinguished. The laughter died. Heads turned in his direction. A queen struck down a pawn on the chessboard in the corner, unseen by the players. Suddenly, the room was deathly quiet, ignited for a moment by a flash of lightning and the fearsome vibrato that rolled across the room, altogether too close. Suddenly so dangerous.
December 12, 2009
Harry nodded solemnly. He didn’t need to remind Draco why that memory hadn’t worked. It was tainted. It was full of the resentment and pain of being humiliated.
“What?” Harry demanded, straightening his posture, and pushing off the wall of the lift.
Eventually, he did go back into work. He had been told he was needed for a raid on the morning of the 15th. Some kind of follow up on whichever dark wizard was busy cursing potions or some such nefarious business. Harry couldn’t really be bothered with the details of the case, he just showed up where they told him to and trailed along as the other Aurors fought their way into a basement potions lab. Harry took his time wandering around looking at all the various ingredients and brewing stations, the cauldrons still smoking with whatever they had been cooking up. He knew some of these potions were used to put blood curses on objects, but he didn’t understand much of the theory behind it.
Harry left his chipped mug on the counter, and gently guided Draco’s own mug from his hands back down onto the unassuming slab of wood, and the two men stood facing each other. Harry was drawing him in close, hands first on Draco’s, then guiding up his arms and back down, soothing and soft. Draco sighed deeply, letting Harry’s attentions wash over him.
They stood together, Draco leaning back against Harry’s chest, and Harry holding them both steady.
“Well,” Harry said, with a slow blush creeping up his neck, “I spent most nights looking at that map trying to figure out what you were up to. Drove Ron and Hermione spare, to tell you the truth.”
Draco had reached out to Luna asking for her meeting schedules for Greg, and thus began a weekly correspondence that Draco hadn’t anticipated or entirely wanted. It was as if they’d always been friends, though. After the initial inquiry, Luna never spoke about the meetings again, they were anonymous after all. She instead asked him about his research and life, inviting him over for tea a fair few times, and was generally very pleasant.
“Besides,” Porter said smiling again, “if the midwives are knitting, what is there to worry about?”
“Been up to no good, have you?”
“Draco?”
“He gave it all up, in the end. The pureblood mania, the nonsense of it all, it caught up to him. He couldn’t watch people die. But, he didn’t feel like he could escape. He had no one to turn to, so he conspired with a house elf and gave up his life so that others may live.” Harry said finally, turning until his gaze met Draco’s, both of them facing each other.
And Harry knew that he had been right. He had found his place. Where he needed to be.
Harry stretched his legs out in front of him, leaning back against his old rowan and contemplating the small glade ahead of him. It was full of tall grasses and foxgloves in full bloom, their bright rows of bell like flowers housing the busy grumblings of bumblebees. Harry had gotten overwhelmed with the buzzing the first day he had come, his heart going fast and his focus bleeding away into a haze of craving and tightening around his upper back, but he had stood there, slowly stretching himself right, swallowing down the feelings, focusing on the idea that, like making tea, he could do this, and it would be alright. And, eventually, it was.
He was always like that, so playful and chipper, full of excitement for any delivery and whatever strange instructions Harry had for him.
Draco was peeling back the comforter and stepping over Potter as he began to stir.
Draco was stunned by the cavalier use of Voldemort’s name, and by the assertion that McGonagall thought it preposterous Draco would be up to anything morally dubious.
His nightmares came back with a terrifying insistence - Nagini tearing pieces of his flesh away from his legs as he tried desperately to scramble away from her, the inferi pulling him beneath the surface of the lake as he screamed for Dumbledore to help him, he even had one where Ron had been imperiused and who kept trying to poison him, until he finally got frustrated and shoved the sword of Gryffindor through his abdomen, telling Harry he never really liked him anyway. That last one had kept him up replaying their friendship over the years, looking for hints that they weren’t anything but best mates.
He passed the afternoon stringing up popcorn and bits of tinsel, transfiguring the tips of the branches into ornaments - little reminders of their time in the forest together - an otter, a little thestral foal, carrots from their garden, a little wiggentree. He spent the whole time narrating his thoughts to Little Dipper, who was happily napping on his perch in the corner by the fire, wing long since healed, but too content with his lodgings to be bothered with leaving the cottage hearth, especially during the daytime.
He groaned, not realising that Malfoy’s eyes were still on him, overwhelmed with ideas of his next step. He wanted to go to Grimmauld Place, but not to use the drugs he had left there, to get rid of them, for good.
“Ron was convinced it was because you fancied me, but you were such a git I never believed him.”
“Yes, she says you’ve become a most unsociable hermit with a tendency to rudeness.”
“I suppose we should intervene.” Draco said with a sigh as he turned from the window to walk back downstairs.
He felt oddly weepy, weirdly relieved, and yet, somehow still ached with a bizarre sense of fondness for this horribly drafty and splinter filled attic. It was the perfect place for a young adult to start their journey, not for two blotchy old wizards like he and Harry. No, they had never belonged here. The protective magic woven here by so many sang with lightness. It was ready to hold Juniper through this part of her life.
“No, Head Mistress— Dumbledore has many hiding places, even in death.” His withering tone dripped with sarcasm and Draco couldn’t help but glance to see the bored expression and the dramatically discourteous eye roll.
of sleeping in the same bed- mean nothing? And, how have you not discussed the bedroom?!”
She smiled. “No one better.”
“The court will now administer veritaserum for the purpose of the testimony. Let me remind the court that questions will be limited to these specific cases. Past criminal activity from prior to the Azkaban breakout is inadmissible.”
“No?” Harry asked, curiously.
Adrenalin pulsed through Harry as he grabbed the second owl’s leg.
Harry met Draco’s eyes, and he saw a war there. Confusion and hurt, trauma and desperation.
The startle of the insult broke Draco from his spiralling trance as he squawked his protests at her.
He led them both down a flight of steps and off into a shady copse of trees, in one of which, sat Little Dipper. He hooted frantically and swooped over to land on Harry’s shoulder, nibbling at his ear, obviously ecstatic he’d done his delivery properly and all was not lost.
Draco could smell something minty and wet that slowly replaced the fire whiskey smell in his brain. He became aware that he still had a body and he slowly began to re-inhabit it again. He was in France, not the manor. He was with Neville, not Greyback. Neville, who was helping him pet a small plant that made nice smells the more he touched it.
