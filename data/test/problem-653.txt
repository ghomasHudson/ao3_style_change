I tap twice. My hips thrust up in search of something, anything to rub my aching cock against.
‘The bit where I still have my wand, and you, dear Mr. Potter, are wandless?’ I lunge at his stomach, head forward, and hit him so hard, I hear his air escaping him. He staggers, but manages to keep upright. He runs away. I quickly vanish the cord.
‘I feel as though I know you really well. I heard your voice singing. Such a beautiful voice must belong to someone with a beautiful heart. I am Harry.’
‘I thought it would give me pleasure.’ Malfoy’s voice breaks the silence, startling Harry.
‘Mr. Potter! Harry!’
‘Aren’t you coming with me? Hermione would love to have you over.’ Ron asks.
He grabs my wrists, his emerald eyes blazing. ‘Just to be clear. I love you too. I don’t know how it’s possible, but it is. I love you, Gin. I would never do anything to jeopardize that. That’s why I never told you. That’s why I broke up with Draco. So I could be with you. But it broke my heart, choosing between two goods.’ He looks so vulnerable, so miserable, I have to hug him. The position is awkward, me sitting on the floor. He pulls me onto his lap and just holds me. Both of us are crying, our tears forming wet spots on out clothes.
‘What the...’ Harry gasps. He knows those eyes. The stranger pulls off his hood and smoothens his hair in one fluid movement. Harry‘s deceitful feet take an involuntary little step backwards.
‘Fine, but you can keep calling me Mr. Malfoy.’ She is startled by my reply, but my eyes betray me. She smirks.
Ginny grins. ‘I would be disappointed if you didn’t. Ready for a good show, hun?’ Harry pulls her closer and kisses her. I sit on the chair, not sure what to expect or how it will affect me.
He crowds in on Harry, pushing him onto the bed and resumes their kissing. Their tongues twist and lick. They bite, explore and suck. When Harry’s out of breath, the Count gets up on his knees. He opens his sinfully tight trousers, to reveal his hard cock. Harry watches it, licking his lips. He wants to taste it. And then it hits him. This wizard has had more companions than he probably can remember. And Harry’s practically a virgin, when it comes to sex with males. He clambers back a bit, feeling so stupid.
Harry opens his eyes and raises an eyebrow at him. He points at his leaking cock. The Count laughs his wonderful laugh again. ‘Don’t get cheeky now.’ He pushes in a third finger unexpectedly, soliciting a loud moan from Harry.
‘I do.’
Instead of being angry, she swats his arm and laughs. ‘Draco, you utter cunt. Harry’s trying to have his bloody important conversation here.’ He laughs too as they share a moment of eye contact. I feel a bit left out and realize that’s how they sometimes must feel too.
Harry laughs. ‘So eager, dearest Draco. We’ve got all the time in the world. But as you’re so insistent, you can suck me off right now.’ Hmm, the prospect of getting him off in the loo goes straight to his cock. He gets up.
‘You realize that in my position, one can’t have distractions like these pantaloons or this...’ Harry gives Draco’s cock a little squeeze. Draco suddenly thinks breathing is overrated as his breath catches in his throat.
‘That’s a lovely offer, but no. Thanks.’ Harry tells him, as he gently pushes the wizard away and makes his way over to the bar. He looks around and sees the dancers move a lot more sensually than he at first noticed. Two gorgeous witches are kissing with fervor. A couple is in the corner, almost melting into each other. Harry can’t make out their gender, both are beautiful, slender and hot as hell. They notice him watching and laugh.
‘Nonsense, Hermione. You’re the best mom I know. You’re just tired. And Rose cries because she trusts you. You’re her safe haven. Now, get on the couch and I’ll fetch you some tea.’
Harry avidly does his chores, to keep his mind from wandering to tomorrow. When evening arrives, Harry orders some chickpea curry with roti. He eats it in front of his television. He knows just what he’s going to watch.
Draco blushes a bit, feeling pleased with the compliment. ‘She thought me all kind of useful things one can do without magic. Ever since I was little, I relied on magic. My father wouldn’t let me do anything the muggle way. My mom too, or so I thought. One day I walked into the kitchen, wanting to steal a bit of pie and blame it on the peacocks, when I found my mom peeling apples. Watching her slender fingers was soothing and oddly relaxing, so I watched her from a corner, being as quiet as a mouse. Of course mum told me to either come in and help, or discard myself. So I started helping. She let me mix flour, butter and sugar with my fingers, creating perfect crumbles for the pie she was making. From then on every Sunday we prepared the most wonderful and strange dishes I had ever laid eyes on. I think my mother was truly happy when creating all this delicious food with her bare hands. She transferred her enthusiasm on me.’ Draco looks at Harry. ‘How come you can cook this well yourself? That omelette was restaurant quality too.’
He trails further up, avoiding his cock, kissing the sharp bone of his hip. ‘I wish you could see yourself as I see you.’ The kisses go up, over his abs, his scars, gently flicking over his nipple.
‘I know!’ I hear Ginny say. ‘I hate it when he does that! He snores louder than a forest troll.’
‘Cheesy.’ Draco smirks as Harry captures his mouth to shut him up.
Spirals of lust rage through him, as he sets a demanding pace. Harry grips his hips as Draco’s fists grab Harry’s hair even more tightly. ‘I can’t... this is so good... can’t hold back... I’m...’ Harry squeezes his hips and moans around his cock. Draco’s pace is faltering. He gives Harry a warning, tries to pull out, but Harry’s strong hands keep him right there. ‘I’m coming’. Harry refuses to let go. Draco’s balls tighten and he forcefully releases spurts of white spunk deep inside Harry’s throat, making Harry gag. With white stars blurring his vision, Draco staggers, holding onto Harry’s hair for support. Pulling back, his legs give way as Harry catches him and coaxes him gently to the ground.
‘If you show yourself now, I’ll be considerate. I won’t force you.’
Without further ado, Harry pushes his cock in. Halfway he stills, allowing Draco to adjust. ‘Fuck...’ Draco pants. Slowly, Harry presses his prick in further, grabbing Draco by the nape of his neck for better leverage.
‘I’m not sure you’ll fit’ Draco answers. Shit, did he just say that out loud?
As quiet as he can, Draco tiptoes to he next tree. If he could only reach the outskirts of the forest, he’ll be free. ‘Fuck’, he mutters under his breath, while walking through a thorny bush. It hurts. His arm is bleeding, crimson drops falling to the ground. Silently he keeps on walking, his feet padding the soft moss.
I rub my good knee between his legs, grinding it at just the right spot. When you’re a couple as long as we have been, it’s easy to arouse your partner. You know all the right spots. Using my knee as leverage, I flip Harry over. He looks at me appreciatively as I start unbuttoning his trousers. I take out his half hard cock. ‘This won’t do’, I tell him as I pull back his foreskin and start licking stripes on the crown. Harry moans. I feel his cock swelling. ‘Much better.’ He chuckles.
‘I pinky promise. Look at you. So gorgeous.’ Just Harry brushes the tip of his cock against Draco’s hole. It makes Draco shiver with anticipation.
Both of us struggle for the upper hand. She loves it this way. Competing, besting each other. I’m starting to see a pattern, because it’s what Draco and I always have done too. But enough! There is a lovely, hot woman waiting for my attention. And I know just how to arouse her.
His eyes widen when the words sink in. ‘Sure?’
‘Well? Do you want to ride the elevator too? Or do you want to take the stairs? Disneyland is waiting for us, you know. And Ginny too. I bet she can’t wait to ride the real tower of terror.’ I’m already making my way to the stairs, when Draco pulls my arm.
‘Not to my liking! Drapunzel, you have no idea what your beauty does to my insides.’ And my cock, Harry thinks, but he can’t tell him that. ‘You look stunning. Gorgeous. Like a precious princess.’
Harry looks like he wants to counter the question, but decides against it. ‘I’m the one that hurts you, Draco. Not some freaking rabbit hole. Because you can stop me at any time. A rabbit hole doesn’t listen to safe words.’ A small grin ghosts over Draco’s face. ‘I’m also the one that looks after you, cares for you. I’m not like all those fuckers who abused you.’ Draco looks at him defiantly. Harry knows how much he hates when he is considerate.
He moves the towel down. The fluffy fabric removes all the remaining droplets with ease. Harry takes special care of his scars, looking Draco in the eyes. ‘So good at taking pain.’
‘I know, I know. I’m just... what if there’s someone there wearing the same mask as I am and I’m too afraid to follow it through? What if there’s no one there that’s compatible? What-‘
Harry kicks Draco’s legs apart and spells them to the ground. He vanishes his clothes. His fingers search out Draco’s hole and find the butt plug they agreed on beforehand. ‘Such an eager slut.’ Harry presses the plug in deeper and twists it. Draco moans. He feels Harry take his cock out of his jeans and slick it. He removes the plug. It makes a small sucking noise. His arse feels empty. Harry holds Draco’s head against the tree while sliding his cock into Draco’s already stretched out hole. He starts pounding him without warning. Draco groans, gyrating his hips against the tree to find friction.
‘Draco, look at me. You would like to re-enact the things that happened to you?’ Harry looks him in the eye. Draco gulps as he nods almost imperceptible. ‘You must think I’m crazy?’ A silent tear slides down his left check. Harry gently wipes it away with his thumb.
‘You’re not... not gloating?’ He says it like he expects me to burst into a fit of taunting laughter. Really, Potter. I thought after all these years we were way beyond that. Before I can get angry, I see I shimmer of hope fleet over his face. He quickly schools it, but his impulsive Gryffindor nature has already showed me what he feels.
‘When I find you, and find you I will, I‘ll fuck you, dear Draco. Fuck you into the ground. Whether you want it or not.’
Harry looks at me, waiting for more. When it doesn’t come, he tells me more than he asks: ‘So you started writing Harry Potter fics.’ Averting my eyes, I nod. I feel a flush creeping over my cheeks.
Eyes never leaving Draco’s, he tells the waiter: ‘Tonight, I’ll be drinking just a glass of your finest wine, Fernando. I’ve got an important appointment tonight, which I want to enjoy sober.’ Draco shivers in anticipation.
Harry seems to read his mind, again. ‘Don’t, Draco. It’s perfectly normal to crave this. Nothing’s wrong with you. Unless you think something’s wrong with me for getting aroused too.’
‘Don’t you dare!’ Harry eyes are blazing. Is this Count really going to reveal him to everyone if he doesn’t kiss him?
‘Draco, I’m... fuck it, what I’m trying to say is: I think I love you.’ He blushes as he says it. A delightful, pink stain on his tanned face.
‘Why? I’m sure you’ve had much more experienced, much better, much more gorgeous fucks.’
‘Next, I want to be honest. To the both of you. Never hiding seeing the other. The way I feel it, we are in this together. As two of the most important people in the world I really hope you’ll get along. I can’t force that, though.’ I gulp. It’s difficult to talk like this. So pragmatic and businesslike. It’s the exact opposite from who I am.
‘Where dit you learn to cook like this? The muggle way, I mean.’ Harry asks, when he’s finished his plate.
‘No.’
Shit.
‘I know, love. Don’t remind me. You know how many of those, featuring me, arrived every day before we got a privacy filter on our house to only let the owls in with real mail?’ He rolls his eyes.
‘Yeah?’ He answers as he makes his way over to the kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
‘Wow. She did a proper job at it. This dish is restaurant quality, love.’
‘What do you mean?’ Harry asks.
‘Don’t for a minute think I find you mental or cracked up. I love your submissiveness, it’s a rare treat. But yours should come with a fierce sense of disobedience. It suits you better than the insecure, timid person that sometimes shines through.’ Harry looks at him intensely. Draco has to close his eyes to shield himself from it.
Harry thrusts deep into his throat, making him choke. This time Draco knows what to expect, which makes it easier. Draco slowly strokes his own cock, using the feeling to relax. ‘You’re doing so well, such an obedient little thing. You spoil me with that luscious mouth of yours. Letting me fuck your throat as deep as I can, taking every inch of my large cock like a good lad.’ Harry moans loudly.
Parties like the Flagler’s are famous for attracting young, rich and fit witches and wizards. There are spells all over the place, to keep people from recognizing each other. What happens at the ball, stays at the ball, or so it’s said. But he’s heard the whispers of people who attended. Stories of sensual encounters and even plain sex have reached his ears. Is he ready for this?
Never one to back out of a challenge, Draco naturally wears his pants again the next day. Harry is already at their office, sitting at his desk. This time there is a large mug of steaming earl grey in his hands. Harry is sipping his tea, while reading the case files Draco and he are working on.
Harry resumes his tender caress as he flicks his tongue over Draco’s lips, nibbling at his upper lip. Harry’s tongue grazes softly between his lips, as he deliberately starts darting it in and out. Draco stifles a little moan. It’s like Harry’s fucking his lips. It’s fucking sexy. He feels his cock getting incredibly interested. Again.
‘Thought so. But you can’t, can you? He’s all mine.’ Without further ado, she thrusts the fake cock in. Harry stifles a surprised yell that transitions into a sinful moan. Ginny pulls back and slams in at full force, making Harry cry my name.
‘Good start.’ Harry nods.
‘Bad example. Why not write about how Dean and Seamus shared their first kiss during that game of Truth or Dare?’ I shake my head. No real stories shall be written. It has to be fantasy. ‘Or... or... Snape and Parkinson in detention?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘No, love. Not at all. I like it when you do that. Please, don’t stop.’
Yeah, sure. Draco grins. As the stinging in his sides becomes too much, he has to halt. He bends over wheezing, his hands resting on his knees. His breathing is raggedly, his body shaking from the effort it takes to fill his lungs. He resists the urge to cough up phlegm. His heart is thundering. Harry’s voice sounds closer.
‘They started dueling me, but without a wand, this time there was no glorious victory. I took beating upon beating. The arousal stayed, until they started breaking me, Crucio by Crucio. It was too much to take. I tried to stop them, but they kept throwing their unforgivables at me. It hurt so bloody much, Harry. I was petrified, I kept thinking about Longbottom’s parents and what the Crucio did to them.’ Harry watches him, jaw clenched, his nostrils flaring, anger showing in the crease between his eyebrow.
‘Say that again or do that again?’
We are more alike than I ever knew. Ginny and I? We’re both selfish, we both know what we want. We won’t forget ourselves when making someone else happy. She just hides it better.
Boy Toy moans. The swelling of his cock tells Draco he is close to the edge. He changes his rhythm to prevent him from coming.
Harry grins so widely, for a second Draco is afraid he’ll split his lips. Harry gets up. ‘Now love, this wasn’t that hard, was it?’ Not waiting for the reply, because they both know how difficult the talk was for Draco, Harry takes his hands and coaxes him to the living room carpet. He pushes Draco on the soft plushness. ‘You liked deep-throating, right?’ Draco nods and obediently starts to unzip Harry’s fly. Harry pushes his hands away and Draco on his back as he straddles him. ‘Let me’. He kisses Draco fiercely before going down on him and swallowing him whole.
Malfoy just laughs and thrusts again and again, making Harry see white stars. Malfoy’s breathing quickens, as does his pace.
‘Whatever.’ The crutch is rickety, but it’s holding up his weight. Carefully he starts stumbling out of the forest, but of course the crutch breaks. So much for fucking sturdy wood. He missteps and lands on his already swollen ankle. ‘Fuck’. Tears well up in his eyes, but he keeps on limping. He can do this without support.
‘Do you want a calamari?’ Harry dips one perfect golden, crispy looking calamari in a blazing red sauce. Draco nods. ‘Come get it then’, Harry challenges, popping the calamari in his mouth. Draco looks horrified, the whole restaurant will see him eating out of another mans mouth. His finely bred manners revolt and he goes rigid. ‘No more food for you then’. Harry shrugs, while popping in another piece. ‘Shame, it tastes sinfully good’.
Harry snorts a bit. ‘Scared?’
Harry shakes the envelope. A gorgeous, Italian handmade mask falls out. It’s painted a deep emerald green, off white and gold. It features a traditional diamond harlequin pattern. The golden lines on the mask are adorned in rhinestones and diamonds. Harry flips it over a few times. The precious stones gleam in the sunlight, creating stunning rainbows of lights. They give the mask a remarkable sort of life.
‘Please?’
‘But?’
His owl arrives in the late afternoon, two days after our meeting. I was starting to get afraid he or Ginny changed their minds.
Kudos and comments are much appreciated! Ideas are always welcome. Always wanted our boys to do somerhing? Now is your change!
Loving you is a losing game
‘Doesn’t...’ I bounce up in excitement. ‘Draco, it turns me on beyond words. I would love to wriggle my way out of a parking ticket.’
Small-town boy in a big arcade
Sound of writer clapping hands excitedly. Tomorrow! Sleep wel Harry, sleep well Count. You’ll need your energy tomorrow  (;
You’ll punish me anyway! Draco thinks. Anticipation sending a shiver down his spine.
‘I’m sorry, mother Bella, I was combing my hair. The comb got entangled.’
Don’t think I haven’t noticed how you look at her. The She-who-must-not-be-named that got us tickets. Your eyes linger just a bit too long at her cleavage. She twists her hair when you two talk. I’m no expert, but even I can read non-verbal signs if they are this obvious.
Harry presses his tongue in her slit, fucking her with it, before licking back at her clit  again. Ginny throws back her head and gasps, her hands stroking her own nipples.
‘Don’t spill, love. It would be such a shame if I had to punish you this morning.’ Harry looks at him, his eyes glistening with playful provocation.
‘I want to spoil you, Harry. I want to tease you, kiss you, stroke you until you’re so over sensitized, you’re crying. I want to map your whole body, lick your nipples, tug your hair. I want to open your tight hole, stroke your pleasure spot with my finger. I want to suck your cock while I do it. Then I want to lather you in lube and fuck you in languid movements. I want to feel your come spill over me, your tight hole clenching around my cock, sending me over the edge too.’ Harry’s eyes are black with arousal, he licks his lips and shivers at my words.
Which one to choose? His mind wanders to a noble prince called Harry, who will climb his golden hair to save him. Wanting to look good for him, even if he’s just a figment of his imagination, he undresses. He fills his water basin and washes himself. Making sure to clean his lower region and buttocks, his mind thinks up the all the ways he could thanks Prince Harry for saving him. It makes his cock hard. He sprinkles some lavender scented talcum powder on his skin, making him smell lovely.
‘Drapunzel, Drapunzel,
In which Harry arrives home and finds his beautiful wife waiting.
One fingers becomes two, and the Count scissors them a bit. ‘Okay?’
‘The scars have healed, Potter. Severus was a good healer.’
Harry laughs. I frown at him. ‘Even more bonkers than that time you took the candelabra and-‘
‘Touch yourself’ Harry orders. Draco’s moves one hand to his cock, finding it surprisingly hard and leaking again. ‘Jerk off. I want to feel you come around me’. Compliantly Draco starts wanking as Harry keeps on thrusting in him. This afternoon Draco thought he had never been this aroused in his life, but now he’s ready to adjust this statement, seeing stars as he keeps on tossing in sequence with Harry’s thrusts. He feels his movements falter as his breath comes out in uneven puffs. ‘I’m close’.
‘Oh my. You want this, don’t you, stud? I can see it in your eyes.’ Sexy Arse tells him, as he pushes his cock further in Draco’s mouth.
‘No, I’ve had sex. Just always relied on what I had done before. Never trying different stuff, I never trusted anyone.’
In which Harry and Ginny talk.
I hum. ‘He always was a suckler for family.’
Waking up that morning is strange. He misses the warmth of all those bodies around him. Harry is nowhere to be seen, his doubles have vanished. He finds himself missing them already. He had enjoyed himself thoroughly last night. He felt so powerful, thinking up a scenario by himself. Just remembering it makes him blush. He gets up and feels the delicious soreness in his arse. Good. Today every move will remind him of Harry.
Harry snorts. ‘Just as pretentious as your Count status.’
‘Oh officer, I promise, it’s the last one. Please, don’t tell anyone.’
We keep on kissing. There’s a primal reaction in both of us. If we keep this up, we’re going to dry hump each other on the desk. That’s not how I want it. Reluctantly I break the kiss.
Draco laughs out loud. ‘Don’t worry, I remember everything. Crazy aunt Bella and so on. I did love the shock on your face, though.’
I saw the end before it begun
She lies there, a panting mess of disarranged perfection. I cancel the spell and rub her slim wrists to get the circulation back, before lying next to her.
‘I...’ Draco sighs. He’s not sure how to put this in words. ‘I... Why did you stop?’
That will be quite the sight, I think as I reach inside my pants, pulling my cock out.
‘Okay. Just do it then.’ Harry blinks slowly.
‘Oh Harry... You’re only a war hero, nothing to write home about.’ Dean rolls his eyes. ‘You could have everyone.’
The count, Harry thinks. A small smile forms on his lips. He looks just like Jareth. Just as arrogant, just as hot. And he’s sporting a very different mask from Harry’s. He swallows away the disappointment he feels. That’s what you get from people putting ideas in your head, he thinks. The count turns his attention to Harry. His gaze trails down Harry’s body. The intensity of the stare makes Harry’s legs feel liquid. An appreciative grin forms on the Count’s lips as he looks Harry in the eye. Harry blushes a bit and drains his drink. When he looks up again, the count is gone. He puts his empty glass on a nearby tray.
Malfoy uses a spell that undresses them and leaves their clothes of the sofa. That’s a useful one, Harry thinks, he must remember it. Harry feels the breeze from the spell ghost over his body. ‘Spell or lube?’ Malfoy asks.
‘Draco, get your arse back here.’ Harry’s voice leaves no room for debate. Draco stills.
‘Good boy, telling me what you want.’ Harry gently presses his lips against Draco’s. Softly, he starts kissing him, his lips trailing Draco’s ever so slowly. Draco wants more and tries to deepen the kiss. Harry retreats a bit. ‘Patience, dear Draco. I’ll decide when we take it further. We’ve got all the time in the world.’ His hands make their way to Draco’s soft hair. Draco sighs.
Harry kicks him. ‘Prick.’
‘Yes.’ He says simply and makes his way up the stairs. Harry follows. Draco lights the candles in his bedroom. The room feels softer because of it. Harry sits on the bed and pats next to him. Draco sits down, timidly.
Draco whispers: ‘They aren’t going to ride this, at their age?’ Before I can reply, the woman walks over to us.
They eat in silence, both relishing the perfect, crunchy croissants.
She sighs. ‘Red.’
I nod. ‘I’ve reserved seats at the restaurant. We’ll talk there. Right now, I have more urgent needs.’ He returns my look with a desire that makes my spine turn into a liquid.
‘You just need to go with the flow, Har. The greatest pleasure in life is love, there is no shame in that. There also is no shame in having fun after two years. Ginny would pull your ears if she saw you now, cowering away. You know that. So, you toss away that letter you were writing and you will go and have a lovely time. Bye!’ The floo goes black again. He grins. Luna has gotten the Divination post for good reasons.
He stands his ground. Of course he does. When I’m near him, I lean in and whisper: ‘I’ll be pounding into that tight arse of yours tonight’ He shivers. So needy. ‘there’s only one thing that can stop me. Say it.’
When the food arrives (Curry, of course. Because that husband of mine has a strange fluff in his ears. A fluff that magically only lets through ‘Indian’ when talking about take away meals), we sit at our couch, cuddled close together. It’s a good thing the kids are all at Hogwarts, because they would’ve found our position extremely gross. I can vividly imagine Lily making gagging noises, while James gestures rudely to get Al to blush. It brings a smile on my lips. I miss them.
Harry moves even further down. His tongue trailing a path to her dripping cunt. He opens her legs wider as he lies between them. His hands hold open her puss, while he licks her clit. She moans. Wow, she is just as vocal as Harry is.
‘He fucked me, okay? He fucked me thrice after the war and I loved it. There. Then I met you again, and we broke up.’ Harry falls down on a chair and buries his head in his hands. Is he crying?
‘But he wouldn’t let me. Not there, not without you knowing.’
‘Ginny knows.’
Harry looks back. Something in his eyes is off. Malfoy looks questioningly, as if he wonders what it is. Harry spells his clothing on. The spell is a useful one indeed. He watches as the gears in Malfoy’s head click in place. He sees his eyes widen and the horror showing on his face, as he whirls around and dashes for the gun. Harry waits until he’s got it.
Dean looks at him wide eyed and claps his hands in excitement. ‘Seriously?! Harry!’ His eyes cloud over. ‘Please tell me you’re going?’ Dean of course knows about his aversion to parties. He nods.
I pinch his nose with my other hand, until he has to gasp for air. I thrust my cock in at lightning speed, using his hair as leverage. He moans.
‘Do you want me to show you around?’ Draco asks.
Harry steps into the suit Dean has made him. It’s over the top for him, but he supposes a plainer set would have him stick out in the crowd much more than this one. He puts on his socks and a pair of brown shoes. Shiny, but plain. Dean said his shoes shouldn’t divert the attention from his incredible mask, gorgeous blouse or even more gorgeous arse. He puts on a subtle glamour, the same he wears when going out shopping, the one that makes him less recognizable. Combined with the mask it should be enough.
Spent, they lie on the recliner for a little while, waiting for their breathing to even out. Malfoy gets up and casts a few cleaning charms. He dresses and tosses Harry his clothes too. ‘Mustn’t leave evidence.’ He half-jokes. The atmosphere changes. Malfoy looks at Harry from his standing position.
He lies next to me and strokes my hair. I’m still recovering from a mind blowing orgasm. I love it when we play and I particularly like our Badass auror scenes. Harry doesn’t always feel like it though, it’s too close to his everyday job, but he sometimes does it for me.
‘Why? Tell me, why would I want to show this kindness?’
‘This won’t do, Draco. I want to know precisely what you consent to, or I’ll be going home right now. Alone.’
‘I’m not eating off the bloody floor, if that’s what you’re insinuating!’ Draco’s eyes are suddenly blazing.
Draco feels his breath ghosting over him, leaving goosebumps all over his body. Harry kisses the side of his mouth. ‘So deliciously snarky.’
He hears a familiar chuckle from under his desk.
I swallow. I have thought about it. Quite a lot. But now fantasy has become reality, all my prefabbed answers suddenly are meaningless. ‘I don’t know, luv.’
She can only nod as Harry steps out of the floo. ‘I’m so tired, Har.’
‘Good luck!’ She waves encouragingly.
‘Look at him, Harry. You were so right. He really is gagging for this.’ Ginny has entered my vision, looking at my hard on, her eyes filled with a desire I haven’t seen before. She is wearing a black leather strap on. I knew it! I want to tell them I was right all along, but no sound gets out.
‘Good morning Timothy, would you mind getting me the boss?’
‘Why are you so... caring?’ Harry chooses his words careful, not wanting to break the moment they share as Malfoy walks him towards the path.
‘Mr. Potter, please. It’s urgent.’
Whiffs of garlic, oregano and fresh tomatoes enter his nostrils. He grabs a spoon to fill up his plate with the lovely green asparagus with aioli, glazing dates in the most crispy bacon he’s ever seen, smokey sweet shrimps with a tiny film of garlic olive oil, incredible patatas bravas fried to perfection and...
Draco’s cock tents up his trousers with immodest enthusiasm. He feels the familiar redness creep up his neck, as he drinks in the sight of a very naked Harry, clothed in only mushroom omelette. His mouth waters again, but this time the eggs are not the main reason.
‘Please don’t. Let justice deal with her. I need you, Dray. I’m scared.’ It is scary. Being in the dark, while he hears everything around him. He feels Draco’s proximity as he kneels besides Harry.
‘You should see yourself.’ Harry tells him. ‘All flustered and satisfied and filthy. Jerking off at a restaurant, what would your parents think of you? I should keep you like this for the rest of the evening. Just to remind you what a dirty little thing you are.’
Draco swallows and averts his eyes. His voice is strangely devoid of emotion when he starts talking. ‘The Dark Lord told me it was a test. A test if I was resilient enough to take my mark. At first it wasn’t so bad. It was pure physical violence. They used me to blow off steam. I didn’t mind. It made me feel important, to be the one to relieve their stress. I fought them all and I felt proud even if I lost. As a disturbing side effect it also turned me on. It made me think about all those duels you and I had and suddenly things clicked into place.’
I help her up and remove he cuffs, gently massaging her wrists before throwing her onto the bed. She is a big bad suspect, you know. No need to be too gentle.
‘Imagine how the pillows taste, if I find Marmite-ing them an improvement.’ We both laugh. My eyes are puffy.
‘Trying to make me forget, Jareth?’ Harry smiles as the Count immediately grasps the reference to Labyrinth and laughs.
‘I’m teaching you some respect, auror Malfoy, just like Senior auror Jones ordered. Now don’t let it take your mind off the report.’
Harry feels a strange sensation wash over him. He knows it’s wrong. He knows it’s probably Stockholm Syndrome. But he feels arousal well up.
Her face is close as she whispers in his ear. ‘You know you’ve been naughty, Drapunzel. You leave me no choice but to punish you. No nice food for you. I will be back tomorrow.’ She chucks Drapunzel’s long locks out of the window and makes her way down, tugging hard when she’s down. With a sigh, Drapunzel pulls up his hair and twists it in an intricate bun. It’s heavy, but he’s used to it. He thinks. He feels the burn of his flesh where Mother’s hands were. The sobs return.
The wetness subsides. ‘Don’t forget that report.’ Hastily, Draco returns to his job. He’ll be really proud of himself if it will come out making any sense.
‘How? Wait until he sees him in a dress. The little fucker thinks he looks so lovely. Hahaha. The idiot. As if Mr.-Straight-I-Singlehandedly-Ended-The-War-Macho-Man would ever have any interest in a bloody crossdressing deviant. No, he will reject him. He’ll reject him hard. And then the poor little thing will be devastated.’ More maniacal laughter.
‘Yeah, or maybe it’ll turn you into a frog?’
‘Nothing, auror?’ She smiles seductively at me, as she gets on her knees. I lean down and tell her: ‘Love, I’m so aroused, if you suck me off now, I’ll come within seconds.’
‘Why? We’re having so much fun here.’ The wizard leans in again and bites Harry’s neck softly. Harry pushes him away again, less gentle.
‘Why aren’t you mad?’
His expression turns serious. ‘Yes. I know he came back because of what you talked about. I... Thank you.’
‘Ever heard of a cover up? I’ll bet you the muggles chuck all their persona non gradas in here and leave them to die a quick yet painful death.’
‘It’s as Sybil tells you. Plymouth’s a prejudiced bitch. But I think we should send the aurors to investigate. Maybe something did happen to all the cats.’ Harry sucks vigorously, flying his hand expertly over Draco’s hard cock. Draco breaks out in sweat. He has to bite his lip to keep from groaning. Jaimy continues. ‘We should... Sir? Are you alright?’ Jaimy looks inquiring.
The Count is an excellent dancer, Harry thinks as they float around effortlessly. Harry has long ago learned how to dance properly. He turned out to be a more gifted dancer than he ever expected. He feels the Count’s hands on his body, sending shivers down his spine. It’s thrilling, being led instead of leading the dance. The Count guides Harry into a full body sway. He is surprised by the movement, but leans into it, trusting the Count to pull him up again. When he does, Harry’s face is very close to the Count’s. He feels his breath hitch in his throat. The Count smiles a lopsided grin.
Taking in the fascinating beauty of the place, he starts making his way. He follows the path, knowing he has to get off somewhere to fetch the anemones. He remembers there is a cluster of stones and mushrooms where he has to leave the path. Searching intently, he forgets his surroundings.
Unable to stop himself, Draco lets out a loud moan. Shit, he didn’t mean to do that. Why is he always so loud? He bites his lip to prevent further embarrassing sounds.
A dazzling wizard, dressed in the most beautiful gown Harry has ever seen, makes his way over to him. The gown’s v-neck dives all the way to his navel, showing his slender body and a small dust of hairs, while covering his nipples. The wizard wears a mask similar in pattern to Harry’s, but grey in color. Too bad. Now he can’t have the Count, this sweet wizard would’ve been a beautiful replacement. The wizard’s lips are painted flaming red and part slightly. ‘Your beauty is stunning.’ Harry feels a blush creeping up as he’s not sure if the wizard will appreciate his compliment.

‘Right, I’ll need a safe word too, don’t I? I can only stop you with a safe word?’
I nod. ‘Owl me when you’re ready.’ Reluctantly I leave. My erection is pressing painfully in my trousers. I’m in desperate need of a long, hot wank under a long, hot shower. I take one look back and walk away, before I almost change my mind (I’m only human, after all) and the sight of Potter, disheveled, lips bruised from kissing, almost makes me come in my pants. I blow him a kiss and apparate home.
‘No.’ He opens his eyes, regaining eye contact.
Draco puts down his knife and fork and carefully takes a tiny bite of the omelette at Harry’s belly button. It tastes like fluffy, hearty perfection on a plate..uhm..stomach.
‘Now I’m not sure anymore. Draco, I’ve seen Harry yesterday. He... I’ve never seen him like this. I think he loves you.’
‘I tried different fandoms, but I’m too old for all the new shows and bands the young girls and boys write about. So I tried a few others, but all the fandoms from our youth are almost dead and have practically no followers. So my fics still weren’t being read.’
Draco moans as Harry fingers his hole. ‘Just fuck me.’
‘Stop.’
‘You’re doing great. It’ll get better. I promise.’ Softly, he starts moving. Harry feels his hole opening even more and all of a sudden it doesn’t hurt as much anymore. Experimentally, he wiggles his arse, moving up and down slowly. He whimpers.
‘Don’t ever think you can outrun me. You’re mine and I’m entitled to do with you as I please.’ Harry presses a violent kiss on his lips. Draco tries to kick him in the balls with his knee, but Harry deflects, looking furious. For a second Draco is scared. Harry notices instantaneously, his face softening.
‘Look up and check if I’m laughing.’ Reluctantly his eyes look up, searching out mine. I’m not sure what he finds there, but I feel compassion and protectiveness bubbling up. That’s unexpected. Also, standing so close to him, I feel something else. Something I can’t place yet.
I’m waiting for him. I wish he was here already. I’ve never wished for something in my life this badly. I don’t know which outcome I fear most. Him and Draco getting together, or him being destroyed by a rejection.
Harry looks at him. Malfoy’s glamour is dropping. His eyes turn into the color of the sun. Harry yelps.
‘Incarcerous’ I mutter, conjuring ropes to tie her arms to the bedposts.
I get off her back and pull her up. She looks so hot. Her blouse is partly open, revealing her tits, her hair ruffled and her skirt is askew. I open her lush mouth (she struggles, of course) and hold my thumb in front of it. ‘If you bite me, I’ll make sure to punish you, understood? And do I have to remind you that there is a word you can use to stop me?’
‘I do like... I... Oh my, this must sound fucking stupid.’
I nod.
Just Harry pushes his cock in deeper and deeper. Draco opens his mouth to tell him to stop, only to have Sexy Arse’s prick shoved in his mouth deeper and rougher. Just Harry stills a moment, giving Draco time to adjust. And time to tap, should he want to.
This close to Harry, I can smell him. It’s a male smell, strong, musky and powerful. I hadn’t realized I missed it. After Harry I’ve never been with another man. It didn’t feel right. Then I met Astoria and all thoughts of Harry were shoved back. Oh, Astoria. If you could only see me now. Would you be proud I follow my heart, like you told me countless times?
‘Auror, please. I’ll behave.’
‘Really?’ Count Flagler has a reputation of fucking everything in his way. After the war, he suddenly appeared, claiming that after the dire war times, wonderful parties were needed to restore people’s moods. And he’s thrown outrageous ones, filled with alcohol, music and sex.
‘What has happened?’ His voice comes out hoarse. Jaimy enters the room too.
He smacks me as I’m laughing. ‘I’m only one year older, Mrs. Potter.’
This must be underwater love. The way I feel you slipping away from me.
‘Do you have to ask? I would like nothing more.’
Fuck. It’s only the most illustrious event of the year. He knows Ginny would have murdered someone to join the notorious ball. He feels his throat tighten a bit.
She nods. ‘You have my thanks, Mr. Potter.’ Her head disappears in a roar of flames.
Draco hesitates. Maybe this wasn’t a good idea after all. Harry is his senior partner. Maybe he just meant it when he told him these pants were unfit for duty. Harry hasn’t spotted him yet. He still has time to go to the lockers and change into his auror pants. Yes, that’s a most wise decision. Draco withdraws.
‘Not after the war, there isn’t anymore. Your precious Aurors made sure no werewolf got their hands on it. They purged us. Those of us who lived, stay hidden in the forest. With no cure, it’s not safe to be here at a full moon.’
‘Now, now, love. You shouldn’t have done that, should you? Do you want some of the omelette I’ve made?’
‘Don’t let it get to your head, Saviour. Your ego is already big enough.’ The sneer is without venom and Harry smirks. ‘Now, eat.’
‘So, as much as it pains me, you’re leaving me no choice but to practice what I preach.’ Harry’s hands slide down, holding still at his buckle. His darkened eyes seek out Draco’s as he waits for permission.
‘Fan fiction are stories written by fans about their favorite character-pairings and fandoms.’
‘Don’t worry, auror. I’ve got plenty of vials in my stash.’
I don't need your games, game over
‘Would you like that, Draco? The feeling of being immersed in this beautiful, soft hole? Tap twice.’
‘We will resume our posts, sir.’ They walk away. Relieved, Draco slouches a bit, giving into the pleasure of Harry’s mouth. ‘And sir?’ Sybil looks back at him. ‘Please take that potion.’ He manages to nod. They exit his office, bickering about the case and closing the door. Just in time. Draco’s hands fly onder the table, grabbing Harry’s hair through the cloak. ‘Fuck...’ His eyes close with arousal, mouth open in a perfect ‘o’, jaw tight and a frown on his forehead. Harry intensifying the rhythm gets him off. Hard. He spurts a seemingly endless supply of come deep into Harry’s throat, letting out a low grunt as he does so.
‘Rough night, sir?’ Jaimy grins. He is the party animal of the force. Of course it’s his first thought, Draco thinks. He grins back. ‘Something like it. Rough morning too.’ The tongue on his cock trails the ridge of his crown. It feels so good. And so wrong.
She keeps standing there, looking defiantly at me, her hazel eyes sparkling with provocation. I tackle her down (careful I don’t hurt her knee), with a special auror move, and pull her hands behind her back. My knee is on her butt, restraining her. I cuff her with special cuffs a muggle police officer once gave me. I pull her hair with one hand, lifting her head, and whisper in her ear: ‘You will be very sorry you disobeyed me, Mrs. Potter. I will have to do an extra thorough check now.’
Harry lightly smacks his butt. ‘Chop-chop, get that lovely arse under the table. We’ve got some time before dessert.’ Harry opens his fly. Draco feels anger well up in him. How dare he be so presumptuous. He won’t do it!
Draco comes closer. He starts walking me over to the desk, his eyes colder that I’ve ever seen them.
When I arrive home, Gin is already waiting for me, sitting on the porch swing Lily always loved so much. Her legs are propped up under her as she slightly swings to and fro, a crocheted blanket covering her fine legs, leaving her ankle free. Her blouse has tightened over her breasts because of her sitting position, giving me a nice view of her bosom.
Draco is silent for a while. I can see him considering if he wants to tell us more. Deciding he does, he complements: ‘You want honesty? I must say, I already have felt jealous of what you have on more than one occasion, and I await more of these moments. You two have more history and you already chose her once over me.’ He is right, even though my heart never really could make the choice.
Draco grins. He will never think of dessert in the same way now. He spoons a copious amount of the ultimate chocolate pudding into his mouth. Sighing he enjoys the sinful rich chocolate flavor in his mouth. He licks his spoon clean. The next heap of the perfect pudding makes him moan loudly, just as a couple passes their table. He looks at them embarrassed. They look right at him, but there’s no reaction. It as if they can’t see him. What the?
Harry starts rubbing circles around my ankle bone. ‘We will get this sorted out, right? I don’t want to lose you. Or him.’
Harry’s face splits into a toothy grin. ‘Sure?’
Draco smiles. ‘Same here.’ He gently pushes in further, as his hand finds my cock and slowly starts wanking it. It helps me relax.
‘I’m sorry too.’ My voice comes out muffled because of the pillow. Harry sits back down.
In which Draco meets up with Ginny. Will it change his mind?
Quickly raking my brain for an excuse, I tell him: ‘I don’t know. What is in the notes? Maybe it’s something that was already there? I told you we should’ve bought a new iWiz, not a refurbished one.’ Yes, that sounds plausible. I’m real glad my fantasy also comes in handy when hiding stuff from my husband.
‘You do realize you say fuck a lot for someone who isn’t actually fucking yet, do you?’
Malfoy grins. ‘I’d rather have you open something else for me.’
‘Please, more.’ Harry’s eyes open and flick to the Counts. He needs this so fucking badly. The Count looks at him entertained. ‘Count? If you can still look at me like that, you aren’t fucking me hard enough.’
‘Why?’
He uses Harry’s shampoo. It’s rich smell of patchouli and musk cuddles around Draco, the scent of Harry making him feel warm and loved. He closes his eyes as he lathers himself in foamy soap, spreading it over his body and relishing it’s softness. With a sigh he turns off the water. Work. Must get ready.
‘Let’s just say we’ve got some very influential friends. Mr. Potter, I wouldn’t have called on you without a reason of the utmost importance. It’s Draco.’
‘Please, you.’ Before I loose my courage to go through with this, Draco thinks. Before you think I’m crazy for wanting terrible things.
He frowns.
‘What is it? The consequence?’ Harry asks calmly.
‘I don’t know, Harry. I’m a werewolf. It isn’t easy being with me. You know what happened to Professor Lupin. And Greyback. I would never want to hurt you of all people.’
Draco decides he also wants another hole filled, so he lets go of both pricks, while he pushes Just Harry away, releasing his hard prick with a pop.
‘I’ve...’ I lick my lips. ‘I’ve never been gagged before. I...’
Loving you is a losing game
‘To be the unrelenting auror in question, yes. But if that doesn’t turn you on, we could do it the other way around?’
Harry snorts and swats Dean’s head through the floo. ‘Ouch! But seriously, Harry. It’s time for a nice fling or just a good fuck. It’s been two years, lad. You’re entitled to some fun. It doesn’t have to result in a 20-year marriage.’ His gentle smile warms Harry.
‘How do we go from here?’ He asks me. ‘How are we going to do this?’
‘Begging already?’
Shit. The Count thinks he doesn’t want him. ‘No! No... It’s definitely not you. It’s me.’
‘Would you like some of that champagne now?’ The Count sits down at the little table, gesturing to the other empty chair.
Draco swallows. He is too aroused to talk, so he just nods. Harry flicks his wand in intricate patterns, mumbling spells he has never heard before. He feels his bone regrowing, feels his ankle straightening up. The pain subsides. ‘Liar.’ Draco spits at him angrily.
‘Oh no. No, no, no.’ Harry shakes his head with a sad smirk. ‘Draco, I will be the fucking you. Not myself.’ He grabs Draco’s wrists, still tied high above his head, his other hand holding down his hips. He twists Draco around, and gives the rope a little more slack. He fists Draco’s hair and forces his head against the tree. His face scrapes the bark. Harry breathes in his ear. ‘I could’ve made this pleasurable for you. But you choose to defy me.’ He bites down Draco’s neck again, sucking and grazing it. He feels his skin bruising.
‘Tell me, did you let him explain? Or did you fill in the bloody blanks and made up your own story?’
‘I’m sorry, Harry. I shouldn’t have said what I just did.’ Draco almost cries from remorse.
Draco nods. ‘Yes’
‘Let’s get inside, ma’am.’ I open up the patio door. ‘After you.’
‘No, not today. I have a date with a platter of sushi and a lovely bottle of Mirin wine.’ Harry replies.
‘A what?’
‘I.. I don’t know how to tell you this. I never wanted to keep it a secret. I just never knew how to tell you.’
‘Youwouldfuckmerighthereonthetablebetweendesserts’ Draco rattles.
‘He’ll show. Don’t worry. My sister will make the self righteous bastard show up. He’s such a sucker for saving the world, even my fucking nephew will do. I’ll let him break the little brats heart first and then I’ll kill them both.’ She giggles like a madwoman.
‘Now, eat.’ Harry picks up a bowl of noodle soup from under a stasis spell. Draco lifts his arms, but pain sears through. ‘Uh-uh’ Harry tuts, as he swats his hand away with the spoon. ‘I’m taking care of you.’ He strokes his hair, kisses his forehead and feeds him soup. Hot, spicy noodles slither down his throat. Spoon by spoon, Draco feels warmer and even more loved. He smiles a soft smile. Harry returns it, his eyes sparkling.
‘Nah, you can do that yourself. I kinda like you doing all the hard work.’ Harry strides back over to Malfoy and kisses him long and rough. ‘I really have to go now. Or I won’t be able to pull myself away.’
Stopping my train of thought, I ask him: ‘Do you still want me to leave?’
I look at his eyes. They are bright from tears. Don’t think I didn’t notice, Harry dear. I’ve known you for quite some years now. I can see how excited you are and I see the way Draco looks at you. Like he wants to devour you, but doesn’t want to with me watching. As if I would mind. Wait? Where the fuck did that thought come from? Well, maybe I wouldn’t be opposed to see some of the gay porn I write firsthand. I make a mental note to share this sometime during our dinner dates.
It’s a bit disappointing actually. Not nearly as kinky as I like it with him, and playing auror doesn’t really do it for me. But just as with Ginny, I would do it if it makes him happy. Maybe I can retrieve some old gear out of the attic for it. ‘Okay handsome. I’ll see if my old uniform still fits me.’
‘I’ll start then. Luv, I really think you should talk to him about this. About how you feel.’
Together, they eat the chocolate croissants from Harry’s satchel and drink some conjured water. They take battle positions and it isn’t long before Harry hears Bellatrix’ voice telling Draco to lower his hair.
Mother looks at him. ‘Let me help you.’ She picks up the comb and slides it through his long, golden locks. She uses more force than necessary and yanks out some hairs.
‘Turn around.’ Harry’s voice is low and dangerous.
‘Why are you here, Malfoy?’
Ginny covers the strap on with lube, gliding her hands up and down the girth. ‘Look at him, Dray. He’s so ready for it. He’s begging to be fucked. Oh, I bet you would love to get into that perfectly tight arse yourself, don’t you?’ I’ve started drooling, partly because of the gag and partly because my mouth is watering at the sight of Harry, waiting to be pounded.
‘Ouch! That hurts.’
‘No animals is different from animagus or potion induced animal forms. That just you or me in a different form of ourselves.’ Draco nods.
Not really knowing what to do, Harry walks slowly through the room, taking in its beauty. His auror senses pick up a shift in the atmosphere and he turns around. The crowd parts to reveal a blond wizard, moving around with an arrogant ease. He is wearing a charcoal dress coat, complete with glittering cuffs and long, wavy tails. The collar is turned up and embedded with darkish, sparkling gemstones. They shine in the light with an iridescent glow. A frill of white silk covers his throat, a dark broche clasped in the middle. Sinfully tight black pants cover his muscular legs. He is wearing a pair of long, black boots over them. In his hand he holds a feathered black mask on a stick.
‘Keep looking.’
‘Harry!’ I smack his arm. Hard. He smirks at me. ‘Stop it!’ I semi-shout.
‘Pray tell, what were the consequences?’
‘16, 17, 18’.
‘Two taps with foot or hand in quick succession.’
‘No, stud. We won’t fuck that beautiful arse of yours, right lads? We promise. Don’t worry your pretty head.’ Sexy Arse replies as he deliberately starts unbuttoning Draco’s shirt.
Harry though? Harry’s a lot less enthusiastic. Parties aren’t his cup of tea in general, because everyone is either awestruck when they see him, or feel compelled to be mean and disrespectful. They share opinions he thinks better are left unvoiced. And since Ginny’s death it’s even worse. People he doesn’t know empathize with him, share their own sad life events or flirt blatantly. Why would this party be any different?
Malfoy hesitates before answering. ‘They weren’t gentle my first time.’
The Counts eyes flick to Harry’s. ‘Trust me when I say I haven’t had sex this overwhelming in a long time.’ He looks so earnest, Harry feels himself relaxing.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You bloody fucker.’ I push him backwards. Too late I realize this is what he’s been waiting for. He sidesteps and grabs my arms when I storm by him, wrapping them up behind my back with a piece of cord that he must’ve conjured wandlessly. This is bloody arousing. I never tell him, but I could come thinking of the sheer power of his magic. He is the strongest wizard I’ve ever encountered, and I’ve lived under the same roof as fucking Voldemort. He could overpower me with a flick of his wrist.
‘Uhm.. yes?’
Biting his lower lip, Draco averts his eyes and fumbles with his sleeves.
‘The mouth on you, so not worthy of a princess.’ Harry’s finger finds the right spot and Draco groans.
‘Don’t worry, pet. I’m sure I’ll be able to keep up with your Gryffindor haste.’ I feel his cock pressing against my leg and know he’s just as worked up as I am.
‘I...’ He fumbles with his hair. I want to get up, to leave this place. What was I thinking?
The impact his undergarments have on him, doesn’t escape Draco’s notice. He smiles and wiggles his hips seductively. ‘Maybe you should ask if Drapunzel minds if you fuck him.’
‘Sounds good. I wish I could join you. ‘Mione has cooked dinner tonight.’ Seeing his best friends face contort with aversion, Harry laughs and slaps his shoulder. ‘It’s the greenish lasagna.’ Ron stage-whispers as he shudders with horror.
I push in my prick with one hand, and hold her hair with the other. I try to fuck her slowly, but she looks at me longingly, her red mouth around my cock, her eyes filled with raw desire. I thrust deep into her mouth and come in an embarrassing three thrusts. ‘Fuuuuuck’, I hear my hoarse voice growling as I spoof her up. I take a moment to collect myself.
‘Maybe... Maybe if you go first, I’ll be more courageous?’ Draco’s words stumble out of his mouth. He curses himself for being such a bloody idiot.
He tries to look around, but all he sees is the flower filled clearing he’s at. When did the forest get so dark and hazy? The mist is blurring his view, disabling Harry to find the path. He stumbles a few steps ahead, and freezes. A sudden sound has drawn his attention. It sounded like a... sigh? He tries to locate it.
‘Fuuuuuuck.’ Draco’s voice comes out rough, his cock jumps up embarrassingly fast.
‘I know.’ Harry looks like he is fighting back a new fit of tears. We can’t have that. So I kiss him. Harry’s eyes do the comical quick-changing thing again before settling on the passion I didn’t realize I’d missed so much. He tilts his head and opens his mouth a bit, looking questioning. Harry! I can take a hint. No need to rub it in.
‘I’m sorry, Gin. I really am. Let’s talk about this later, okay? Please, don’t stop on my account. I’ll be downstairs.’ Banging my head against the wall.
Sighing, he starts getting up. He knows how stubborn I can be.
Harry stills. So Draco does too. ‘I will open up that arse of yours and stick my cock in. I will fuck you until you see stars.’ Suddenly Harry peeks around the tree. ‘Found you.’ A devilish grin forms on his lips.
‘Show off.’
‘Looks can be deceiving here, lad. Nothing is as it seems.’
‘Please, don’t.’ Draco replies.
I look at him feral. ‘Oh, it’s not the potions I’m talking about, Mr. Potter. It’s the arse.’
One last chapter tomorrow! Will Harry find out who the Count really is behind his mask? Let me know in the comments!
‘My turn, you can let go’. Draco retrieves his hand to pick up an olive. Harry takes it between his teeth and sucks on it. Then he flicks it with his tongue and swallows it. ‘More’.
He tousles his hair, fluffing it up, only to comb it straight again the minute after. Deciding he has enough if his indecision, he heads downstairs.
‘Hello, precious.’
Silence follows. Then: ‘No.’
‘More men die of jealousy than of dragon pox, so best be careful with that.’ Draco quips.
Harry swallows.
Fuck.
Harry hits him in the face. Hard. Draco moans as his lip splits. He feels the stinging pain settle in his cock. Harry readjusts the spell, and suddenly Draco’s hands are way above his head. He almost has to tiptoe to stay upright.
‘What did you mean, yet?’
‘Did I tell you this afternoon where a filthy mouth would get you?’ Harry’s voice is dangerously void of emotion.
‘Ever so easy to wind up, Draco’, he smirks as he swallows him whole. Draco lets out a rather undignified squeak. Withdrawing, Harry presses back his foreskin and starts licking the tip. His tongue teases the head, having special attention for the little slit in the center and the rough edges of the crown. His right hand is kneading Draco’s balls, while the other hand squeezes his buttock.
Reluctantly the Count sits down and listens to his employees, discussing music, food and drinks. His mind wanders to his matching mask wearer. Will he show? Has he waited long enough? Not the first year after her death, that would’ve been rude and inconsiderate. But not too long either, or he would have been taken already.
Draco wakes up in Harry’s bed. Harry lies next to him, sound asleep. As he has no memory of getting in the bed himself, Harry must’ve carried him there. It makes Draco feel warm and fuzzy inside. The warm fuzziness starts to growl, drawing his attention to the fact that he hasn’t eaten since breakfast. And what a great breakfast it was, Draco thinks as flashes of Harry’s cock covered in omelette come to mind.
The Count’s body is extremely fit. His muscles are pronounced. Harry can’t take his eyes of him. A few silvery scars are on his chest, making his appeal even more sexy.
‘No.’ Malfoy pulls his hair hard. Harry grunts and lets go of his own hardness. It’s compelling, not being in control. Harry thinks he’s never been more aroused in his life. His knees on the uneven, leafy forest floor, his hair hurting from Malfoy pulling it, his throat stretched to the limit, his own prick neglected and leaking, looking for friction of any kind. Malfoy slows down, pushing in his cock even further. Harry gags around his prick, unable to breathe. He feels like he’s choking. When it gets too overwhelming, Malfoy pulls back, only to push in as deep again. Suddenly he removes his cock. Harry swallows. This might be the moment. He can’t deny he’s frightened a bit. Will it hurt?
‘LEAVE!’ He’s bellowing. One day, this voice scared me. The day we broke up. No, when he broke up with me. Now it doesn’t. Not with Ginny’s story in mind. I wonder if he was just as devastated when he told me we couldn’t see each other anymore as he is now. I didn’t notice then, but he must’ve been.
‘Please, Auror. I can’t be found with any dose of invigoration draught. My husband, I’m sure you’ve heard of him, he’s very important for his legislations against illegal potions that leave polyamorists energized enough to please all their lovers?’
‘Nothing like a good bashing to break the ice. Now, if you’ll excuse me for a moment? I need to go stir something. You can go talk about me in the living.’
‘Fuck, Harry. That was so fucking arousing.’ Draco moans, his own cock leaking with anticipation.
Well, this is the end! I woke up incredibly early (it’s now 6 in the morning as I’m posting) to write and post the last chapter. I really hope you liked it. Let me know if the ending was as you expected :).
‘Yes. Merlin’s balls, Harry. Please. Fuck me.’
‘I’ll fix those distractions, right now.’ Harry expertly opens Draco’s button and fly. In one swift movement he slides the trousers down. His hands slip behind Draco’s back and start massaging his buttocks, while pressing his own crotch onto Draco’s. Draco feels the hard outline of his cock pressing against his own.
‘Harry?’
‘What? Did you expect sex with a werewolf would be gentle?’ Malfoy looks at him sternly. Fuck, it’s even more arousing this way. Malfoy’s pulsing, enormous cock is dangling in front of Harry’s mouth. This is something he can do. It’s a bit bigger than he knows, but it’s something he’s done before. It makes him a bit more confident. Harry opens his mouth obediently as Malfoy fists his hair and feeds him his cock.
Harry sighs. ‘You do remember I’m an auror, do you? I checked the creation date out of habit.’
‘No thanks, lass. I would rather help you and gossip about Mister Potter, if it’s the same to you.’ Ginny laughs and holds out her arm.
‘I would do it myself, but I’ve got a meeting at...’ she glances at her small, golden wristwatch, a present from Ron, ‘five minutes ago. Shit, I’d better run. Would you...?’ Hermione gestures at the basket.
Harry tries to mimic Bellatrix’ voice, as he waits for the rope to come down. Carefully, not wanting to hurt Draco, he climbs up. When he pulls himself up and swiftly throws his legs over the window sill, he sees Draco, hiding behind the curtain.
Draco’s brought a posh looking jar of chocolate cookies and a bouquet of bright yellow daffodils for Gin. She takes them flustered. ‘Thanks, hun. That’s real gentlemanly of you. It almost makes me forget you’re screwing my husband.’ I startle at her jibe, but Draco lets out a bellow of laughter. She laughs too.
Harry gaze follows him, eyes inky black with desire. Hesitation forgotten, Draco gobbles up the rest of the omelette, savoring every bite of rich flavor, mixed with Harry’s own arousing, musky taste. Harry’s cock springs up, bobbing and trying it’s best to gain Draco’s attention.
‘You should.’
‘I know, I know. But I’ve thought about that. The portal doesn’t allow any wand to go through but my own. Yes, quite clever of me, isn’t it.’ She listens to the other side.
All I know, all I know
‘Indian’, Gin and I tell him in unison, as we both know about the fluff in Harry’s ears. He walks down to order. I look at Gin.
‘Such a lovely arse’. He swats it with his outstretched hand, leaving a red print. Harry yelps. ‘Yeah, just as red as that pretty face’. Malfoy tells him, as he gets on his knees behind Harry. His tongue trails down Harry’s butt. Malfoy opens his arse, stretching his cheeks with his hands. His nails are pricking in his flesh. Harry whines. Is he really doing what he thinks he will?
‘I’m sorry, Dray, that Gin can only take one person backstage. Would you rather go?’ He looks like a crestfallen puppy with emerald Bambi eyes. How could I say no? I swallow and nod.
I have to swallow a lump. I don’t want to lose him, but I don’t want him unhappy for the rest of his life. ‘Oh love, I guess it all just clicked into place. Your animosity against Malfoy. Your aversion to Scorp and Al’s friendship. The sadness after the war. I think deep down I’ve always known. Why do you think my fics came so easily? Question is, what are we going to do about this?’ I lower my hands. Tears are streaming down my cheeks too. I love this man. It’d break my heart if he should leave me.
He blushes a bit. ‘I would like to do some auror play.’
To his surprise, Harry doesn’t give the normal reaction of pity or repulsion. He just watches him and nods, eyes transfixed on the scars. There’s something predatory about his gaze, something that makes Draco feel strangely wanted. Almost imperceptible, Harry licks his lips. Shit, they are both raving mad, aren’t they? Harry tears his gaze from his body as Draco continues.
‘The masks!’
He is running in the opposite direction of the forest border, because Harry surely won’t be expecting that. Only flaw in his logic? The edge of the forest is much farther away. Fuck. Draco’s feet screech to a halt.
‘I like... I want to... I...’ He freezes. He can’t tell him this. Can he? His eyes travel downwards. He feels his eyes burning.
‘I’m sure you’ll do just fine, pet. You know how to pleasure yourself, right?’ Boy Toy asks.
The man grins. ‘Don’t worry, lad, it’s not me you’ve got to fear.’
Harry looks outside. His arms are starting to cramp. His eyes shoot back at Malfoy. ‘All this talk, and so little action? Or are you scared, ferret?’ The use of the old nickname stirs something in him. He notices he isn’t the only one.
‘Fuck, Pott- Precious. You feel so fucking good around my cock.’ The Count presses in even further, until he’s in balls deep. He waits a bit, so Harry can adjust to his hardness.
Malfoy looks at his movement, before looking him in the eyes, ‘Hot.’ Harry smiles a little lopsided smile. Malfoy keeps on pounding his arse. The thrusting becomes less controlled and Harry moans. He sucks in his bottom lip.
A broken heart is all that's left
‘If that’s the case, we’ll best start working.’ Harry gets up. He feels energized. He contacts his production team, telling them he’s got the story of the year. Together they will make it work. If, that is, Malfoy doesn’t distract him from the task at hand with his perfect cock. He grins to himself. All will be well.
Harry closes his file and puts it on the desk, together with the tea. Effortless he pushes himself off the desk. Draco finds his attention drawn to Harry’s well built biceps. Slowly Harry closes the distance between them. ‘An incident, hmm? I don’t believe one word of it, auror Malfoy.’
Harry feeds him the date, licking his fingers afterwards. Draco’s mouth explodes with a prefect mixture of sweet, salty and smoky flavors. Does food always taste this great? Of has Harry magically enhanced his taste buds?
We settled on a muggle holiday park. One that has tiny cottages, with lots of privacy.  It’s neutral territory, with no press or nosy neighbors. I’m owling Draco the apparation point and the date. Restlessly I await the return of Jareth, our pet owl. It arrives within 10 minutes. Someone is eager.
‘No, but I want you to put it in anyway.’ I manage a shaky smile. She returns it as she tuck a strand of hair behind my ear, her hand lingering on my cheek.
‘Just this once I’ll condone your language, dear Draco, so let’s start. You or me?’
‘What do you expect me to say, Harry? Why do you bring this up now?’
Harry gets up too, both of them crowding in on me. They walk me over to the corner of the room.
‘Let’s get something to eat. Take away, anyone?’
‘Suck’.
One finger turns into two, three. Just Harry twists his fingers, so he reaches Draco’s prostate. Draco moans around Boy Toy’s cock. Suddenly he feels the fingers being replaced with... a cock.
‘For the first time it’s best to open your hole by spell. Is that okay?’ Harry tries to hide his disappointment and nods.
Harry is ranting on. ‘So don’t you fucking dare to start, Ginny Weasley. I can see right through your bloody deceit!’
(See the end of the chapter for
This, he thinks, will be one long night. Luckily there’s a whole bowl of high-calorie pasta carbonara in his stomach. He’ll last. And if it gets too much? He knows he can back out with just one word. Lazily he surrenders and waits for the incredible things the Harries will have in store for him.
Residual condensation starts to cling into nebulous puffs, cleaving to the ceiling. The BroomBod was a mistake. Merlin, how he hates his celebrity. Harry lies down on the floor and closes his eyes, waiting for the conjured clouds to fatten up and begin pouring down on him. Might as well save the water on a shower; Hermione will praise his efforts.
He should have known by now that his plans never worked out the way he wanted.
"You don't own something when you save it."
“And Molly says to come by at three, but only if we stop by Luna’s first and bring back her knitting patterns so she can start on Hugo’s spring jumpers; she says he’s already outgrown his Christmas ones, can you believe—Harry? Did you fall asleep?”
"No," she agrees, chuckling. "Not at all."
,” I reemphasise, “and even if we weren’t, there is nothing for you here.”
Does Harry hate Malfoy?
“Balamara isn’t much of a party island,” Draco says. He keeps glancing at Harry’s face and missing, sliding down to the peach-and-lilac print of his tropical shirt (Snitches weaving between palm trees; a bit of a cacophonic catastrophe).
When Harry awakes that morning, he sits up with a start, his heart half-torn from his chest. His alarm rings and rings and rings in alarm: Panic! Cry! Despair! There’s been a storm thundering through his mind all week. Draco Malfoy stands trial today, and he’s worse than dead if Harry doesn’t do something about it. Harry’s never liked Malfoy much (stupid prejudiced bully with even stupider pretty hair), but he’s going to save him anyway. It’s what is right.
"How many bartenders are there at Nylon?" Ginny casts her eyes across the room, trying to catch the attention of a server.
"Who the fuck is Stella?"
“The chicken scratch you pass off as quillmanship is abominable, by the way,” Malfoy continued, “you’re lucky I could even parse it at all. But after I’d put in all that effort into reading it, I thought—why not? I’ve earned it, haven’t I?”
Eltanin takes out two sticks of Sobering Gum and hands one to Harry. "Come on," he says. "Chew this and drive me to work in your fancy car. I'll forgive you if you hook me up with the valet."

It was three days ago when Draco came to me with the idea. I was already in bed, but he stood by the wardrobe still, itching at his wrists with a nervous bite to his lip. He said, “I couldn’t figure out what to get for your birthday. What I want to give you may well be impossible. But we can try.”
Sneaking into Potter’s home is not hard. Grimmauld Place recognises Draco as family, and he pays his tribute in blood, palm slashed and dripping over every door. He finds what he’s searching for under the basement trap door, suspended over a pedestal of black haze in a room with mirrored walls. Draco walks toward it until he sees clearly the deep crimson of the Resurrection Stone, and within it, the swirling image of Potter’s face, mid-scream.
We go on a drive today, to the hills. (241 words)
The dinner wraps up. Dean stands on the bar and gives a speech about how he couldn't do it without a bunch of Weasleys and his mum (Ron rolls his eyes at his own name) and announces the afterparty at Thestral & Gold. Harry already knows from the bar's name that the party's going to be a total snooze, so he bows out, saying he's had a long day. "Exhausted. Photoshoot earlier," he explains to Dean, leaving out the part where it only took him thirty minutes.
“They would’ve been able to follow the Apparition trace if it weren’t for the rain,” Harry says later. Draco sits in Harry’s bed, his back against transfigured pillows, the dog’s head in his lap, his hands cradling a mug that’s chipped despite Harry’s best efforts.
A cruise ship came in today as it always does in July when the wind blows buoyant, and everyone wants a little piece of heaven for themselves. Summers with Nana are blessed, breezy days of linen-hanging and lemon cake after, and no one gets upset when Draco smears icing all over his five-year-old mouth. “It’s good to do things yourself,” Nana says knee-deep in the river behind her cottage. Draco wrings what he can from his corner of tablecloth and takes pleasure in the slick velvet of rock underfoot.
Draco Apparates back to his flat that isn't theirs anymore and beats dust off the bed where they used to fuck like they were going to die (because they were). There's a band of white around his finger where the ring had burned. Whatever the antidote did, it didn't work.
Once Draco started, he couldn't stop. He bought recipe books on the best methods to suspend ham in green jello molds. He bought books on grief disguised in a motorcycle maintenance handbook, intimacy without touch, love beyond a mirror
Draco swings his legs over and slides into Harry's lap, his arms hung around Harry's neck. "Getting close," he murmurs, breath tickling down Harry's spine. "Merlin. Please."
"Who said I only wanted one thing? You're making a lot of presumptions," Harry said, his voice hitching. "You don't know me at all. You don't know what I want—"
Harry rolls over on his bed and flops onto his pillow, his hands balled in frustration. A steady strum of
"There's nothing wrong with being gay."
Ginny lifts her own box of takeaway chips. "Helped myself," she says. She wrinkles her nose when Harry gets near enough to smell her shampoo.
“Alright,” Draco says. There’s a pause. Harry closes his eyes, imagines Draco wetting his lips; waits for Draco to ask, “What are you doing?”
“It’s too much,” Potter says later on, at the club.
"Sort of," Harry says, distracted by a glint of gold from the west entrance. The blond shoves past the bouncer, revealing another disappointment.
“I—yes. Happy Birthday.”
"I wasn't alive then."
"Are you going to fuck me, or are you going to make me fuck myself?"
Harry does a lap around the room. He thinks about getting back on the BroomBod, but he doesn't want a repeat of the same incident as earlier, and he sure as fuck doesn't want to call someone every time he wants to work out. He calls Hermione instead, the old-fashioned way, through the Floo. The flames flicker green until the fire dies without a reply. So he dials her on his mobile.
“What else feels good?”
? Is that a signed copy?"
“I saw Malfoy again,” Harry tells Ron the next day on Ron’s back porch. “Not like, saw-saw,” he corrects. “Just saw his run at the X Games.”
“Bad dream,” Draco says.
"Yeah," Harry says. "But we weren't friends."
“It was too much,” Draco says, and by it, he means himself.
“I could eat.”
Fury clawed at Draco's chest. "I'll show you—" he choked.
" Ginny asks in an undertone, so Ron doesn't hear.
“Burger’s messy food. Can’t eat it without ketchup dribbling down your chin.”
. I'm going to vomit in your shoe to teach you a lesson." She stood up with an empty plate in her hand. "What are you even going to tell your kids is your grand epic nausea-inducing love story? Daddy One went crazy over a couple of books Daddy Two stole out of spite?" She dropped the plate into the sink, where it began washing itself, before she rounded on Draco. "It still makes absolutely no sense to me why you cared so much about a few stolen books."
"What
“You haven’t asked me why I’m here, how I found you. Who was after me. I could’ve killed someone, I could’ve killed Ronald Weasley —”
Draco pressed in another finger, his arm coming around Harry's back. Harry shivered, tremors rolling through Draco and straight to his dick. God, he wanted to fuck Harry so badly. Where did the urge come from? What was the appeal behind it? Harry made Draco's blood boil. That was all. Simple aggression, the kind you got when you stubbed your toe or when Jan stole your work lunch again. Not the kind that made you nut in your trousers.
Harry should have expected the two boys to be friends. They’re both in Slytherin and small for their year, which, at their age, is all it takes for friendships to form. Although he can’t fathom what they’d talk about; he certainly has nothing to say to Malfoy, even now, except maybe Quidditch—and Albus hates flying.
"Yeah, but it's not long. I have it written out on parchment, so just find me before you go up."
"No," Malfoy laughs. "You're too bloody flashy to want that."
Soft light. Light as the perfume on Mother’s cashmere scarf. Supple as the leather of an armchair before the fire. Bare feet peeking out from under heavy blankets, blanketed thick as the meadows coloured white as marshmallows squished over cocoa. Harry’s cocoa, a sweetness that Draco tastes with every kiss.
"Right now? Probably
Fingers card through his hair and down his neck, soft as the tap-tap of piano keys half-pressed down, ethereal in their half-existence. There is a Ferris wheel outside, Harry says. It wasn’t there before. Do you want to see it? Do you want something to eat? Do you want half my sandwich and have it weigh you down inside like a responsibility. Do you want to be whole again.
"Too busy for Quidditch?"

"Yeah," Ron sighs. "I miss her. It was all kinda petty, looking back at it."
"I walked up and down the entire length of that train, but there wasn't a conductor in sight."
“How many?” Draco asks.
"Can I get another one?" Harry asks the bartender, his attention still on his phone.
Draco set his book down on the kitchen table and looked up, annoyed. "My books aren't for sale."
In spring they’d grown, but it’s summer now, the days warm and endless, and Draco, tan on the undersides of his arms, on the soles of his feet.
"Uh-huh." Draco lowers his wand and gives the blank wall a curious look. "Closets...is it only closets, or also attics, or cupboards?"
"Harry, you're not seriously going to—" Draco starts but shuts his mouth in a snap. His face relaxes, and he forces a smile. "I'm late for dinner, but I'll see you at the bar after," he says in an exacting, tempered voice. He shoves past them, disappearing down the hall.
"We're not going to the trials anymore," I announced out loud the next morning. "We're going to jerk off instead." A rooster crowed. Or maybe I imagined it; it was bloody dark still. I waited for his chuckle of assent before slipping a hand down our pants.
Breakfast is yoghurt and blackberries from the woods, drizzled twice over with honey. Harry licks his spoon clean before opening the cabinets again for a loaf of sourdough, butter, marmalade, two pieces of chocolate, a pomelo. Draco peels the pomelo by hand, tugging off the pith strand-by-strand between his index and thumb until light swallows the shade and he starts to sweat from the heat.
"Alright, enough," Draco laughs. But Harry feels the calluses under his palm.
Harry rests his chin in his palm and leans forward. "What did you say your name was again?"
"We're in no rush," Harry says. He walks over to the Wireless and fiddles with the copper dials until an r&b station he likes comes into focus. He steps back and takes a moment to appreciate how the music warms the room, his room, his things.
The barman nods to Harry, though not because he recognises him. "What’ll you have?“
Except there isn't anything to

Friday comes slow and goes even slower. Harry is bored enough to leave his house for a jog and let the paps chase him the whole five kilometres. He's still wired when he gets back, so he hops on his new stationary broom—a gift from BroomBod, delivered that morning—and does an hour ride. It's not fun (nothing like flying outdoors), but gets his mind off things. Afterwards, he goes through the motions of an actual shower, with water coming down from the faucet, for the first time in what must be weeks.
Draco gives his coat another pat-down. “I left my wand at the shop.”
“Not even a little because I hate you a little.”
“Once the world knows the full tedium of your humdrum life, they’ll stop haranguing you.”

Outside, Ron asks if Harry wants to go to another club, but Harry feigns a yawn and says he's got all the excitement he needs for the night.
"No need to get up," Harry said with a hurried motion forward. "I'll look for it myself."
My snout drags again, around his trainers. It’s hard not to, being so close to the ground. He hunches down and scratches behind my ear where he thinks I can’t reach, whispering words that he thinks I won’t hear.
Harry looked up, wary.
Draco purchased new cords for creaking sash windows and new flooring where the hardwood had warped. In went shiny new fixtures and new candles for the chandelier. New, new, new! Everything new except Mother's linen curtains, hung up in the kitchen nook and filtering sunlight into something soft. There, Draco took breakfast every morning—toast and marmalade, with a cup of tea—and peered out at the people passing by until his arse numbed from apathy, and he began the slow process of unpacking.
"Do you really miss the old me?"
"Well, it's nice to see you too," Draco said. He smiled like it was easy to. And then it slipped away to something more befitting the two of them.
Luna is solemn. “I cured him, of course.”

"Good job," Hermione says. "You won the lotto on this one."
Harry Potter: arch-nemesis turned probationary pub partner, turned shitfaced drunkard eating pizza on a public toilet.
Draco closes his eyes and gives in to the softness of Harry’s mouth. He braces his hands on Harry’s pauldron, wishing it were the warm ridges of collarbone instead. All this useless armour when what Draco craves is the intimacy of chests pressed heart-to-heart.
The bagger at the Muggle shop we always walked by asked me if I wanted paper or plastic. I said paper, then plastic, then paper again.
"And what do I deserve?" Harry asks.
"There ya go," the florist says, presenting the bouquet with a flourish. "For your boyfriend or girlfriend or bae or soulmate or whatever you kids call your loves these days."
It’s a beautiful day outside. The sky is an endless expanse of blue, and Harry’s dizzy marvelling over how big it is, all of it. It’s hard to imagine that people have ever died on these grounds; not when the now is so bright, Harry can barely open his eyes.
"Oh, no, nothing like that." The woman gives a bright, false laugh. "You really are quite an influencer. Our Star Athletes program is designed for celebrities like you, who—"

"Your living room fucking sucks," Ginny says as she flops down on his boxy, L-shaped sofa. It bounces back as though resistant to comfort.
They kiss and kiss and kiss, and Harry doesn't know how to stop. He chases it even when Malfoy digs nails into his wrists and pulls away. When they can breathe again, Malfoy runs fingers through his hair and comes out with a handful of spaghetti. His shoulders shake with mirth. Then Malfoy says it again—
"No!" She throws her hands up. "I can't!"
“I didn’t mean—” he lies, like he means it.
“I… no. I—I love you.”
"Again, I don't. Usually I reason out the answer before the question."
Harry pinches her arm.
I’m alone when I sink into the Pensieve at last. I see myself in my mother’s arms, my name rolled off her tongue for the first time, her eyes like twin omens of death.
"Get the blue bag, then."
"You're needed," Draco said.
“You wish.”
"Sort of, yeah. She even went over to his flat once."
Harry lays out two towels and sets up an umbrella.
"Did you hear that crowd?" Draco exclaims. "People are going to be sound-biting your endorsement everywhere. I'll bet on Pansy's purse collection that Hermione has the election in the
Harry throws his glass at her. "Shut up."
"Sure you do. Why else would you drive around in a ridiculously expensive Muggle automobile, show up to the same loud bars, and pull increasingly outrageous shite every weekend? Because it'll keep the paps off of you? No, I think you like the attention. I think you're lonely as fuck, and all you want is somebody to look at you."
"He invited you over?"
From the sky dropped brooms, the Ford Anglia, a half-giant on a motorbike, twisting, curling magic, and still, their lives stretched taut, untouching, eyes forward, one foot after another, the future a green point of light ahead, precisely between the eyes.
Mornings, Draco walks out in his striped pyjamas and sleeping hat and breathes in the sloping hills, the snow-capped peaks; the lake nestled between, asleep under snow. Then he goes back in, to bed.
"But isn't that what books are? Shards of other souls that reveal your own reflection, if you're lucky?"
Harry clicked his tongue. "I'm sure it's all a misunderstanding." He waited for his student to leave before sharing a knowing look with the portrait of the late Headmistress McGonagall.

Harry bangs both fists on the table before he hauls Malfoy out of the chair by his collar. “We know you did it,” Harry snarls, making a show of his rage, his childhood fury long forged into steel. “We found the list.”

They want me to say things like, he’s grey eyes, a pointy nose; frost-blond hair and a smirk as cool as moonlight. I want to tell them instead of the naked affection he wears when he sees me stepping down from the train. The way his shoulders seem draped in devotion, his eyes tender and trusting. I love him so much, it’s like I see him inside-out.
Harry doesn’t say anything because he isn’t sure Draco is entirely himself. They’re testing a new formula of Wolfsbane. One painless night spent alone in a windowless room, and the rest of the month is yours to freely live. That is the hope the potion sells.

Harry's smile is wrinkled and worn, like the sun on the back of a crumpled envelope. His palm lands over Draco's hand flat on the bench. Draco snatches it back, flinching up to meet green eyes that seem to ask,
Draco’s hands are on me the moment my eyes crust open. He says, “It’s not worth it.”
“Thanks.”
"The Manor," Draco whispers, thinking of Father, of Mother. What will happen when the Dark Lord discovers—
“You’re not.”
In the years since, Draco sees Potter plenty, though always from a distance. Meritocracy pushes Draco only so far, so he ends up with a desk position within the Aurors, signing off this and that, and playing the bad guy for the puppetmasters upstairs when the answer is no. Potter is infuriatingly polite, his voice measurably calm and his dismissal always impersonal. The others follow his lead, their words and actions a shallow replica of their Saviour, and with that example set, Draco leads a middling, tolerable existence.
Death creeps in our bedroom day by day in the long, spindly shadows of dusk, tugging at the seams as my beloved unravels before my eyes. Soon, the beast will ask Draco to pay his dues, and I, his subject, will watch.
Harry takes Malfoy's face and pushes him away. He runs a firm thumb over Malfoy's lips.
“Merlin, Harry. When were you going to tell me?”
"That's kind of hot," Harry said. Harry's dick was already dripping—Merlin, Draco wanted to lick it so bad, his cock jerked.
"Then why are you here?"
“Alright, I won’t,” Draco said, and let the words clog up thick in his chest. He looked at his hands. To them, he asked, “But, am I? Surprising? Do I surprise you?”

There is a Ferris wheel outside swinging its spindly rails round and round.
"I know," Draco repeats.
“Yeah?”

They’re together two years before Harry tells his friends. It’s snowing outside, and Harry lays open and quiet all winter, waiting for them to tuck his insides back in for him. “Didn’t seem worth it,” he echoes when they ask
Heavy double doors clang open to reveal Dean Thomas: the Auror, ex-husband, the legend.
"Uh-huh." Harry wonders how long he should indulge her because there's no way she's only here to "check in" on him. She's too selfish to swing that kind of visit. Not that Harry minds. Actually, Harry likes that she's too self-absorbed to dig into Harry’s shit.
The windows in Harry’s bedroom start from Draco’s knees and sweep up to the curtain rods, hitting just below the ceiling. They’re curtained now, but haphazardly so, with lazy strips of light falling over the bed, the blades of Harry’s shoulders. Draco squints at the light, trying to guess at the time. Just past ten, probably. Harry likes to sleep a lot, maybe ten or eleven hours most days, sometimes straight through on the weekends. Draco doesn’t sleep as much, maybe seven at most, but he always pretends that he does. “Can’t make it, don’t know how long I’ll lay in til,” he’ll tell Pansy when all he’s planning on doing is pushing himself up against Harry’s chest and wrapping Harry’s drowsy arms around himself until he feels warm again. It never takes long.
Harry draws his gun and shoots. The bullet soars neatly between blue eyes. A perfect line of red blooms down the middle of Dolohov’s mouth, still open. His eyes roll back.
Ginny draws in a breath. "Geez. You're not even married to Ron, and she drags you in like this."
The thing about love were the things you took for granted. Harry could run fingers through Draco’s hair, or he could slip a hand beneath Draco’s trousers, or he could press Draco up against a wall and slide to his knees, and none of this would come as a surprise.
Harry bites it out of her fingers. "Disgusting," he agrees, but he swallows it anyway. It's rather tasty, actually. "Can we get back to my issue?"
"Really?”
"Draco," Harry said, a smile creeping across his face very, very slowly. "Want a taste?"
"Of course you wouldn't," Hermione snorts. "God forbid you sully your hands with house-elf work."
It's a whole week before Harry sees Hermione again, the days going by like years, transfiguring marble into brick and gold into walnut and adjusting the lamps so that they give off a soothing yellow glow. Harry's a new person by the end of it. He's full from change, languid in progress, content cataloguing all the new things in his house, the things he can call his.
"Don't get me started," Ron groans, stretching into a yawn. "Guy can fuck off and die for all I care." He sets his glass down on the counter and cleans it off with his wand before getting up and yawning again. "Should head off now," he says. "Don't stay up too late."
The train pulls into the station at the minute. Draco glances up at the scrolling marquee, translation spell twisting foreign characters into English. Two more stops, then home. Not that Draco needs to check. After years abroad, he can get around on smell alone. And what a smell that is: fresh-cut grass and the wind on a sunny day; Amortentia dispensed at regular intervals throughout the airy Muggle train car, magic zipping alongside electrical wires under fluorescent lights.

Lazy off-season mornings. Trips to the coast, dinner with friends. Telling the ref off even when his boyfriend's clearly in the wrong.
But Harry has never obeyed a Malfoy, and he doesn't intend on starting now. He grasps Malfoy by the chin and shoves their mouths together. He wants it to hurt, and it does feel like suffocating, how Malfoy doesn't put up a fight.
"I haven't."
"You're pissed," Malfoy says. His throat is thick with emotion, but Harry can't pinpoint which. It doesn't matter because it's not like Harry cares about Malfoy. And everything's been so
Draco lifts his wand.
After the war Harry is clumsy in a way that seems light and easy and not at all embarrassing or irritating. He bumps shoulders and knocks wrists and trips ankles and then he picks himself up and says sorry, but then he smiles so soft and loose that Draco can tell that he’s not sorry at all. So when Harry stumbles and lands a kiss straight on Draco’s mouth and apologizes, Draco says, “No, you’re not”, and then kisses him back, thinking how nice it is to not have to think so hard before making decisions anymore.
“I wouldn’t touch that,” I call from halfway up a ladder, my right hand pressed against gold-threaded book spines, searching for a title that slipped my mind the moment my ex walked in.
Ginny leans back in her chair and downs the rest of her negroni. "Buy me another, will you?"
Encased is a vivid portrait of a slumbering house-elf, scribbled in the broad strokes of a cheerful child.
"Dean says you can come back as Chaser if you want," Ron says. "Probationary, of course. You understand."
Draco taps his fingers against the counter. "You may not be familiar with the concept, but it's okay to make mistakes."
“Yeah,” Harry smiles. “Yeah, I think it sounds—funny. Like a diner run by goths. Do you know what goths are?”
," he yells. “You know he can escape—"
"Yeah." Ron licks his lips. "I've wanted to try this place out for a while. Say, do you eat seaweed?"
“Yeah,” Harry admits. “Me too. Like my own hand.” He kisses Draco on the thumb, then the wrist. The explanations can wait.
Hermione flicks an empty sugar packet at Ginny. "Can you get
Pansy drapes her legs over the booth seats, digging the heels of her stilettos into Ginny's lap. "Ginny and I are going to a concert on Friday. Wanna come?"
Ginny kicks Harry under the bar and gives him a look that means absolutely nothing to him.
"A thousand Galleons."
"Can't make out with food in my mouth. Bloody unhygienic."

Draco doesn’t like mirrors so it’s not until Harry comes home late one night asking if Draco saw the message he left that Draco realizes what he’s been missing. Draco is already in near tears with worry. He thought Harry was dead. But when he tries to explain that he doesn’t look into mirrors, that he hasn’t since sixth-year, what comes out is a sort-of lie about how he must’ve missed it, and how it won’t happen again.

The acceleration of gravity on Earth is something around 9.81m/s2. “But why?” you may ask, and someone may tell you about big G and little g and relativity. “But why?” you may ask again, and someone else may explain to you redshift and background radiation and maybe even show you a cool simulation of a black hole eating a supernova (gravity is dope), but the real answer is all the same: because. In any other universe, the numbers may be different, but in ours, they are what they are because they’re the numbers that make everything else make sense.
A calico fluffball stretches in great yawns over Draco’s bed in the other room. Harry can see it moving dimly from the doorframe, her paws kneading the croqueted coverlet fondly. “The kittens like it,” Harry says, turning back to Draco.
He leaned in and brushed his lips against mine. I pulled him in by the neck, opening up, my entire chest stinging with anticipation. Like counting the seconds before thunder.
Harry's voice remained deceptively calm. "Can you explain it to me again?"
Harry wakes up this morning with a vaguely empty head. It’s as if someone walked down the halls of his mind while he slept and locked up each thought separate from the rest. So when Harry wakes and sees that the hour hits ten, he doesn’t:
Harry waits. He’s very patient now that the days have slowed. All those extra years in his life that need filling up.
‘Shit, sorry...’, Draco tries to retract, but Harry’s hands firmly hold him in place. Draco’s eyes travel downwards and meet lustfilled, demanding eyes. Harry takes hold of Draco’s hands and places them in his hair. Not breaking eyecontact, Draco grabs Harry’s softer than expected mop.
Harry finds the gorgeous flowers in a small clearing, just down the hill. Molly will love these, he thinks as he sets to picking. Plucking dazzling pink, purple, red and white ones, he starts to feel like himself again. Why did he let an old man scare the shit out of him? It’s a good thing he’s not an auror anymore, Harry contemplates. Who wants an auror on duty who chickens out when talking to an old bloke with a ridiculous old-fashioned green outfit? He laughs at himself. When he’s got a large bunch of anemones in every possible color, he wraps them up with the string Hermione put in the basket.
He looks at me puzzled. Well, puzzled doesn’t quite do it justice. He looks at me like he’s a squib and I just explained in detail how to cast a Patronus. His lips are slightly parted.
‘We cannot warn you enough: should you encounter the suspect, do not try to approach him yourself, but contact the aurors immediately. You can also contact the Quibblers anonymus tip line by owl or firecall the auror department. This is crime reporter Harry Potter for the Quibbler News Group’ Harry wraps up the broadcast.
He gets up and leans over, underarms flat on the table, propping himself up to allow Harry the best access. Harry unfastens Draco’s belt and with one swift movement lowers his pants and boxers. His finger enters his hole. ‘Oh my, such a lovely, tight arse. You don’t know what you do to me, Draco Malfoy.’
Draco feels overwhelmed. Maybe he was wrong about Harry. Maybe he does know what he wants. He gives Harry a small nod.
‘Did I do something wrong?’ Harry’s panting.
‘You never wanted to give me any of that, Mr. Potter. I seem to have been choosing the wrong approach, so I came to set things right.’ He looks back up at me as I crowd in on him. His eyes darken with expectation.
Harry gently grabs his chin and tilts it back, looking into Draco’s eyes. ‘I really like you, Draco. I don’t want to hurt you unintentionally, so it’s crucial we have this conversation. I do respect if you’re not ready to talk yet, the consequence is vanilla sex. We both know that’s not what you want.’
Ooh, ooh
Another small kiss. Draco whimpers as Harry gets to his cock. Never leaving his eyes, he gently pats it, from bottom to shaft, his balls receiving extra attention. Draco feels his cock swell. ‘So responsive.’
Harry grins cheekily. ‘Thought so’. Smug bastard.
Harry inspects me as he circles me. ‘Not such a big talker now, are we? Let’s see if you’re the man you proclaimed when I strangle that lovely little neck.’ He grabs my long hair and pulls it backwards hard, bearing my neck. He licks a stripe down it. I groan.
‘Fuck, Harry. Don’t safe word out on my account. I’m perfectly able to make my own fucking decisions, you sodding Saviour spoilsport.’ Draco bites at him. His eyes dart around, looking for a sturdy stick to use as a makeshift crutch. He finds one and reaches for it.
Swallowing hard, Draco manages to nod. Losing no time, Harry unbuckles and swiftly pulls out his belt. He diverts his attention to the trousers itself. ‘You know, auror Malfoy, that those trousers almost made me come in my pants yesterday, like a randy teenager?’
‘Only if I get to fuck your face.’ I tell her as I open my trousers and take my cock out.
‘Huh, no consequences? Am I still allowed to eat?’ Draco asks, slightly taken aback.
Back at the table, he looks at Harry expectantly. The waiter returns with a large plate of delicious, gooey treacle tart, molten lava cakes, plain evil chocolate pudding, flawless strawberries and luscious orange mousse.
The Count’s twinkling eyes tell him enough. He kneels in front of Harry and lines up his cock. Ever so gently he presses in. Harry’s having trouble to relax. He feels the Count’s hand move to his cock, giving it small tugs. Harry moans, his eyes flutter shut again.
I nod and try to ignore the pang of jealousy that flares up. We finish our plates and go back to our... shed would be granting it more credit than it deserves. Cupboard? No, that would be unnecessary insensitive. Broom cabinet? Yes, that’s much better.
‘I know she does. I promise I will do something about it. But not tonight.’ He hugs Ron. He pats his back in return.
‘Oh, Harry. Thanks for your confidence in me.’ The Count strokes his hair gently, pressing a few locks behind his ears. He presses a soft kiss on Harry’s forehead.
‘Why do you want to know?’
‘I’m not sure if I want that.’
‘Go fuck yourself.’
It makes me smirk, even though I’m still mad at him. Knowing I’ve been a true arse too, I lift my head up. ‘It would taste better with a bit of Marmite, I agree.’
I finish my tea and stare out in our garden long after Ginny has left. Deciding, I get up and apparate back to the shed the Potters call their country residence. I hesitate at the threshold. Am I really doing this?
‘Dare what, Precious?’ He hooks his finger into the ribbon in Harry’s hair and pulls it, letting his soft curls fall loose. A mocking laugh plays at his lips as he tucks the ribbon in his pocket. He looks back at Harry, eyes suddenly serious. ‘We both know what you want, Saviour. But the choice to give in to your desire is yours.’ He tucks Harry’s hair behind his ears. The gentle gesture throws him off balance.
‘I could try and tell you? If you want me to stop, I’ll stop.’ I nod. Harry starts telling me. I see the emotions in his face when he tells me he thought all was lost. I’m almost crying myself. His face lights up when he tells me how Draco came back. Then he comes to the last part. He hesitates.
‘Do you...’
He feels his hole opening some more. Malfoy’s prick slides over the sensitive receptors inside his arse, making it easier. Carefully, Malfoy starts to move. Harry moans. It’s not entirely from pleasure. Yet. Malfoy puts one leg up, the other still in kneeling position, and grabs the armrests for better grip as he pounds in Harry.
Yes. He did right. It’s out of his hands now, he just has to wait. A small grin forms at his lips. He’s waited so long, he’ll live through another day. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he’ll know how sweet his lips will taste and if he was worth the wait.
Draco sits up straighter, trying to focus on the aurors in front of him. ‘Please, tell me. I don’t know what it is, if you don’t tell me, I can’t help you.’ Harry licks the head of his cock and slides the tip of his tongue into his slit. Draco bites down a whimper.
Remembering the old man’s warning, he hesitates for a moment. Feeling the sturdy and comfortable presence of his wand in his pocket, he shrugs. ‘To hell with it!’ he mumbles, as he strolls into the thick forest. The anemones are just behind the hill, he knows.
‘I’m going to caress your arse, worship it like it has never been worshipped before. I bet you’ve never been petted between your cheeks?’ Just Harry opens his arsecheeks and gently strokes between them.
When she’s entered, I deliberately fumble with the curtain, to give her some time. Of course she makes a dash for it.
Ron has joined his broadcast as senior auror officer, to warn the people about a convicted Death Eater that has escaped Azkaban. They hope the tips will help them bring him back in.
He lets out a dry chuckle. ‘And here’s me thinking you wanted to spice up our sex life. But why... why with Malfoy of all characters? Why couldn’t you write, I don’t know, about Ron and Hermione after the Yule ball?’
He nods.
‘Country residence, Malfoy. But you wouldn’t know, as you probably only own fifteen posh country villa’s the size of a castle.’
Harry startles. ‘Did you just read my mind?’ he blurts out, feeling silly before he’s finished his sentence.
‘You are the most wonderful spouse a man could ever wish for, you know.’ He kisses me on the lips. It feels good. I straddle him as I deepen the kiss and before we know it, we’re making out like a bunch of randy Hogwarts fifth years. The kisses are passionate, just as Harry’s passionate about everything. He holds me so tight, I almost can’t breathe. Well, breathing is overrated as it is anyway, so no complaining from me.
‘Mrs. Potter.’
It feels strange, but in an exhilarating way. I test the ball and realize I could push it out with my tongue if I really wanted to. That relaxes me. I try to speak, but it comes out muffled. This really is fascinating. Me, used to getting my way with eloquent speech, reduced to a mumbling mess, forced to watch and unable to participate.
‘Insatiable bastard’, Harry grins as the Count hands Harry an incredibly plush, black towel with the Count’s monogram embroidered in gold. Harry raises his eyebrow. The Count lets out one of his laughs as he summons their clothes. They dress in silence and make their way over to the bedroom.
‘You are generous Draco, and wonderful, and Ginny, you are too. I want you to know I both love you. Each in a different way. I could never compare that love, so that’s my rule number one: no comparing. You’re both special to me, and I couldn’t choose, just as one can’t choose which child he likes best. I had to choose all those years ago, and see where that left us.’ I see them nodding.
Draco stills in the middle of the room. ‘Even in this dress?’
‘I know, she thinks you work too hard. And that you didn’t take enough time to recover from the threats in your last case.’ Harry had been run over by a car and was dragged by it halfway across town by two hitwizards that luckily hadn’t been in the business for long. Nor did they have their driving license. Hermione has been worried ever since. But Harry hasn’t felt a thing. No anger, no fear. Nothing. It’s been a while since he’s felt anything, really. Must be a professional deformation. Living with fear making him fearless or something.
‘Are you always this bossy in bed?’ Harry smiles as he starts moving. Draco’s moans spur him on and he starts thrusting for real.
‘Incarcerous’ I mutter, wand in hand lightly. He yelps, I caught him by surprise. Good. I’m the bad guy here. I take his wand.
He looks at me, his eyes a mixture of love, tenderness and merriness. But for the first time in years I also see the hurt. How could I have been so blind? Me, who has an emotion antenna that picks up all feelings around me, so much it sometimes leaves me depleted?
Harry strokes his cock in languid movements. Draco feels his balls swell. Harry stops. Draco gasps. When his cock softens a bit, Harry starts stroking again, licking stripes on Draco’s back and biting it.
Harry wakes from the smell of croissants. As he opens his eyes, he has trouble placing his surroundings. A blond, masked man is arranging breakfast on two trays. Harry pushes himself up, his body feeling sore. Especially his arse. Lovely memories of the previous night flood his mind and make him smile guiltily as he props himself up on a layer of cushions.
‘My mom taught me.’
‘Harry, I can’t take much more. Please. Make me come.’
Just Harry stands up and dangles his cock in front of Draco’s face. He appears to be thinking. ‘Oh love, I don’t know. You don’t want us to take that wonderful tush of yours and both of your hands are busy right now. What else could you do?’
‘Don’t worry, Precious. As the world falls down, I’ll be there for you.’ The champagne is delicious. Harry finishes it far too quickly. He feels his head spin a bit.
‘Goodmorning, dear Count.’
I start sobbing. Frustrated, I bury my head in my pillow. My eyes start hurting from crying when I hear the stairs creaking. ‘Can I come in?’ Harry sounds reasonable from the other side of the door. But I’m not ready to talk, so I stay silent. He can’t force me to talk.
Draco closes his eyes. His breathing becomes ragged, his stroking gets irregular. He’s almost there.
‘You can stomp your foot down thrice, then Harry and I will help you immediately.’
‘You are such a beautiful man, Draco. I can’t wait until we’ve negotiated our limits, so I can try out all this wicked stuff I’ve been thinking about.’ Harry murmurs against his lips. Draco’s blush turns into a dark crimson as he feels the dizzying sensation of Harry’s magic wash over him, cleaning him.
Looking around, he sees people are touching, kissing and stroking hair. A dashing witch next to him is grinding into a wizard. Her arse is slowly gyrating over his cock. His hands are deep down into her cleavage, kneading her large breasts. Her face is contorted in ecstasy. He can’t keep his eyes of her as she bites her lips and moans.
I take off my shoes and fill up a kettle of water. I need some tea, or my brain’ll stop functioning. The electric kettle that Harry got us makes quite the noise. So much, that I miss the creaking noises coming from the bedroom.
Tears well up in Draco’s eyes. His voice comes out hoarse. ‘I want to... I want to get this off my chest. But I’m not sure if I’m ready.’
‘Don’t what?’
‘Do you like this?’ I twist the plug a bit, eliciting a moan from Harry. He sags through his arms and leans his head onto his underarm, stifling his moans. ‘Or do you want me to replace it with something larger?’ In one rapid movement I pull out the plug and line my cock up with his hole. He whimpers at the loss of fullness and wriggles his arse. I can see he finds it hard to stay in character. Well, that makes two of us.
I see a crooked smile tugging at Harry’s lips. We’ve been together long enough now for him to deduce from my body language what I’m feeling. ‘You like it, handsome? Tap twice against the armrest if you do.’ I tap twice. ‘Want to start?’ Two taps. He grins and walks over to the bed.
‘For what?’ Is she about to disclose what I suspect? This can’t be. I massage the bridge of my nose.
‘This.‘ He shows me the iWiz. It is open at the notes section. A very explicit scene is flashing up there. One that’s rather well written by DrarryShipper1981, if I may say so myself.
‘So I can suck on my prey better, dearest Potter. And boy, can I suck.’ An involuntary whimper escapes Harry’s mouth. His cheeks flush as Malfoy bares his teeth in a lustful gin.
Draco flicks his tongue over the now free part of Harry’s stomach, carefully avoiding his groin, licking it clean of salt and oil. His tongue swirls over Harry’s pronounced abs, sucking gently at his hip bones. Harry moans.
In which Draco and Harry have a talk. And snog.
Still panting, Harry tells him: ‘You can come yourself too, love. Do you want that? I want you to be done in ten strokes. Can you do that for me?’
Harry startles and looks up quickly. There is a woodsman standing on the path. He’s wearing a green tunic, brown leather pants and a brown and green, pointed hat with a feather in it. He looks like he comes straight from a fairy tale. Harry shakes his head to clear it. It must be the surreal magical surroundings, Harry thinks.
Ginny kisses me on my forehead. ‘I think he needs the bed now, luv.’  Harry swoops me up, like I’m a featherlight Disney princess, and gently carries me to the bed. The gag has left me sated but exhausted. Ginny flips open the covers and Harry lays me down so tenderly I feel I tear slide down my cheek.
‘Yes, that would be best, I agree.’
‘What the fuck?’
‘It’s not starvation I’m worried about, Draco.’ His gaze is intense. ‘I’m afraid I’ll not be able to resist bending you over the table.’ He closes in on Draco and breathes in his ear: ‘And fuck that lovely arse of yours.’
‘The Ramblas? They’re booked up in advance for months! What did you do? Use your never ending Hero Fame to get us a seat?’
He nods. ‘Do you... do you want to know what happened?’
I put my cock back in my trousers. ‘I’m sure the Prophet will pay me an excellent fee for a transcript of your arrest then, ma’am.’
"I'm not a ghost."
Running off to Alazambar two years after the war should've solved all of Draco's problems, but the past keeps looping back like an LED billboard, deja vu every thirty seconds and every man looking like Harry Potter until they don't.
Malfoy glances at his shoes. "I hate you," he says.
“Good afternoon,” Draco says an hour, two, three later, yawning. Harry murmurs incoherence into Draco’s hair, tickling down his neck. They try again in another minute or twenty, staggering out of bed on sleep-legs still swaying to the drowsy rhythms of REM. Harry tilts his head up for a kiss halfway down the hall, and they fall against a slatted square of sun, breathing affection like oxygen.
The valet at Nylon takes his car with the same Lumos-bright grin as always. Harry's grateful it's not awkward, but why should it be? Who's going to hold a grudge against someone who sucked you off but refused to let you return the favour?
Potter took him home that day, handing him off to Pansy before Flooing the rest of the way to his own home.
"Not gonna come that fast," Draco said.
“Scared, Potter?”
And yet. Potter knows that, and he’s
"Does he now?"
cw: grief, loss of a parent
Harry understands, but how boring of an explanation is that?
Draco tilts his head to the right and closes his eyes, leaning in.
or something."
The potion goes down bitter. Harry grimaces, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. "Is that it?"
"I didn't sell it," Harry says about the weather system. "I know you said that it's the sensible thing to do, but I don't really want to."
When Draco was maybe ten feet in front of him, he stopped again. He appraised Harry for a few seconds with his mouth curiously pursed before saying, "What's so funny."
"Tell me about yesterday," Draco says instead.
Eltanin fixes him with a quizzical stare. "Do you want to come inside? Actually, can you sign my BroomBod? Otherwise, nobody will believe me when I say that Harry Potter showed up at my door with a bouquet."

“How do you drain a flood?” Draco reprises the next dawn shallow as the shadow of tides. Harry hands him a coffee though it does no good for the salt in his eyes.

And yet, why had others, who had not the slightest inclination toward numbers, known with such certainty?
"Seriously?"
I’d scribbled on the back of a used sticky note, one of several dozen piled up on my desk still to do, and I nearly cried trying to remember if I’d done the thing on the sticky after I sent it.
