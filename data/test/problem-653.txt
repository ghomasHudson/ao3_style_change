Draco lowered his hand that had been blocking the sunlight. When he dropped his hand, he could see the man who had been chasing him for the past few days was smiling at him with one of his muscular arms already reaching out to cover Draco's.
Until finally Draco felt the waves come and hit him with misleading pleasure. Trembling at the sin the devil brought to share with him.
Draco wants people to respect his privacy. Therefore, Draco limits the number of people he interacts with as much as possible.
Draco had stopped the taxi, and he saw the taxi's lights was on to indicate there were no passengers, but when he opened the door, someone was already sitting in there.
And it didn't take long for the guards to start fighting with the session numbers they had gotten. Mistakenly, Draco didn't feel bored or tired in the slightest. Hearing the sound of clashing swords and seeing the swords gleam in the sunlight, he felt increasingly impatient to see who would win.
Draco smiled with satisfaction when he saw the beauty of his embroidery. His dainty fingers moved to clean the cotton cloth from the small embroidery threads stuck to it.
Right now, their entourage was resting in a forest that was transformed instantly by the royal guards into a camp. Because the sun's presence in the sky has been replaced by the moon, like it or not, their group must stop the journey.
Cedric smiled brightly when he saw Draco walking towards him. Not wanting to waste any more time, Cedric immediately reached out his strong hand to Draco and helped the blonde sit right in front of him.
"Mr. Draco, are you all right?" asked the maid when she saw Draco's face, which partially looked pale.
"Well, it's finished. Try opening your eyes," exclaimed Daphne. There was a tone of satisfaction in her voice. Draco opened his eyes slowly. And he stared at the figure who stared back at him in front of the mirror.
Draco peeked a little at the empty throne next to him. The throne was supposed to be filled by the king. However, Draco didn't mind that, and he knew if Harry must be having fun with his mistress then, so let Draco have fun with his current position.
Harry Potter, his arch-enemy. The man had destroyed his business with his expansion. And not only that, Tom was wracked with feelings of jealousy and intense hatred for Harry. Somehow Harry was created so perfect, from a physical point of view. Everyone scrambled to kneel at his feet, worshiping Harry like a god.
Harry's smile seemed full of amusement seeing Draco's helpless condition. The man opened all the buttons on his shirt so that his chest and muscular stomach were exposed. For a moment, Draco was stunned by the bronze skin that sparkled like satin, but then he realized he was in a precarious condition.
"No!" Draco interrupted stubbornly, although his face flushed at Harry's vulgar words. "I'm not, and I will never be!" Draco was sure that his burst of anger kept Harry frozen for a moment.
"Yes! I'm here! Get me out of here!" Then the carriage stopped. Draco’s head collided with the wall because the carriage was a little unstable. He complained while rubbing his forehead.
Someone suggested that I should write about Harry's past when he first met Draco in Lucius's study room, where I said that Draco's past appearance was a nerdy. Yes, I'll try to include their pasts in the future chapter.
"Come on, rub my back." Harry turned over, letting his shoulders and neck catch the warm water from the shower, which coursed down to his muscular back and toned butt.
Draco looked at several royal guards in silence. They were busy practicing their swords. He looked at the sight with admiration. Perhaps this was one of Draco's many advantages because he was the queen of this kingdom. Draco didn't need to ask anyone's permission to enter the training ground.
Harry turned to him. His face was serious now. "Then good if you already know what I am," he said. "It will make it easier for me to cooperate with you,"
This was where Draco and Harry were. In a small waterfall that looks very clear. Draco was amazed at the beauty of nature that didn't seem to have been damaged by humans, but the admiration disappeared as soon as Draco remembered his purpose here.
"Are you all right? Did an intruder enter your room? Actually, I just found out that the guards I assigned to guard you have been kicked out by a man who likes having an affair." remarked Cedric in one breath.
When Ares saved him from the wolves, he was wearing armor, but now he's probably wearing a slightly less revealing outfit than the Spartan warriors in 300 movie. Draco tried to calm down. He had seen similar sights many times when he lived in Hollywood.
Harry literally destroyed his family. Somehow his father's ownership of the business was countered. Everything was taken by Harry and controlled under his hands. Draco's father had nothing more than a monthly allowance for him and his family. Draco's family fell into poverty instantly. Their luxury home was forcibly confiscated; they had to move to a small, simple house. They tried to fulfill their own needs without servants who were usually always ready to serve their needs.
Harry walked into the living room. No wonder Draco could recognize this room. He's at Harry's house right now. But it feels different. Is it possible that the man decorated the house? Someone like Harry redecorating his house? It was like asking an adult to believe in a fairy even if they do exist.
Doctor Jason shrugged his shoulders and smiled at Draco. "Okay, Draco, I have to get back on duty. I'm sure you'll get well soon." His smile is as bright as the sun was shining again, captivating Draco, even after Doctor Jason had left.
"I heard from Attica. She said Hadreda lived here for a long time. I want to study this palace. Maybe I can be friends with her too,"
Draco stopped his lunch and looked at her seriously. The red-haired girl frowned. "Good. You like him?" asked Draco.
They were all handsome because the world market more favors handsome actors and models. Draco was used to it and wasn't a teenager who would easily sway if he was close to a model or member of an angelic boy band. But this time, Draco was awkwardly mixed with anxiety when he met the War God. He shouldn't be this handsome. The God of War, he thought, was ideally more beefy with a thick beard on his face as well as some ghastly scars.
Draco does love books. Moreover, the peculiar odor of the book made it look like someone was using drugs. The difference is, the smell of books does not harm anybody.
Harry did not mess with his words. Anyone who dared to play with fire and intended to injure what was his, that person would be eliminated, including Hyde. People like that do have to get rid of.
He had heard Greyson clearing his throat before answering. "Well, maybe I'll come back another time. Then… I'll take my leave. Good afternoon, Potter. Good afternoon... Draco."
Draco sighs, once again, trying to find a more comfortable position for him to last longer. And his efforts soon made a slap land gently on the skin of his bare ass.
In modern times, people call it a planetarium. Often people don't actually observe the stars there. It was just a building that usually had a futuristic design with a large dome on the roof. On the dome, there was a projector that would display a near-real picture of a view of the Milky Way galaxy or its constellations of stars and planets.
Greyson walked out of the room and was greeted directly by Alden, who had just arrived. Alden bowed slightly to greet Greyson and responded with a nod from the other man. He watched Greyson's departure before entering his master's study room.
Draco could imagine what it would be like if there weren't any flowers growing here, it suited Harry's reputation very well. Draco chuckled softly at his ridiculous thought. He lowered his head slightly, brought his nose to the top of the flower, and took a deep breath of the fragrance that the flower gave off.
Ares took the prince into his arms and spoke while whispering in his ear. "Didn't I tell you that I would protect you?"
She bit her lower lip and looked at him carefully. After saying this question, surely Arabelle would be marked disrespectful by Draco.
Glenice grimaced in worry when she heard her queen utter crazy words with such ease. "It's done, Your Majesty," Glenice pulled herself up as she finished styling Draco's hair.
"What are you guys saying? Why are you crying like that? What's with my body? Did you do plastic surgery on me?" Draco cried too, but his cry was a cry of anger. What have they done to him? Were they so eager to destroy Draco's career that they turn him this way? Various theories raged in his brain.
Ares was not used to being unwanted by humans. He had never experienced this before. He had failed to understand a nineteen-year-old mortal boy even though he had had thousands of years of romance experience.
Is Harry hurt? Or is that man dead? And why rather of being happy but Draco feeling anxious instead?
"Don't talk like that. You can't keep running from me," Hector tried to grab Draco's hand, but he brushed it off.
Draco wiped his tears and glared at Alden. "So, that's why Harry kept me here? Because my face looks like his late wife?”
Draco's tears rolled down his cheeks. Died because of a broken heart. Draco thought of his mother. They both died because of a broken heart. Don't they realize that they are selfish? Leaving all the burdens in this world easily without thinking that they also leave a broken heart for whoever they leave behind?
As sensitive as Harry, Draco realized that the owner of the crying voice was none other than his husband's mistress. Nevertheless, he tried to be indifferent so he wouldn't spoil the activity the four of them were currently doing.
When Draco descended the stairs, in an instant, his heart sank. Everyone present at this party was dressed spectacularly, all must be the latest designs from famous designers.
That must have been something the older man wanted to mention again and again as if there was nothing else the older man wanted to talk about. Wasn't that man curious about his own son's condition?
"You tried to touch Ares' bride. I won't kill you because I want you to suffer," Alastair said coldly. He held out his hand to the still frightened Draco.
After Harry's departure, Draco took a quick stride towards his room. He didn't want anyone else to see him in this strange condition.
Harry Potter must be exterminated; a man like that must not live in this world. And tonight was probably the last night the man will live.
Harry only cleared his throat and nodded faintly in response. After that, Harry stared right at the ballroom door. He was waiting for the girl who had promised to come and show herself to Harry, even if only from a distance.
"Of course! In your opinion, who else is this ignorant girl in the kingdom besides Arabelle?!" Cedric huffed.
"No, I don't want to keep my new wife waiting too long," Ares said half-jokingly, but Aphrodite didn't smile at all. She approached and cupped the jaw of the handsome god seriously.
"Draco. How hard is it to open your heart to me and let me teach you about love?" Cedric asked as he held Draco's hand.
"Honestly, no, the oracle who found you testified that it was a snake bite. Besides, didn't the palace healer confirm that? Said it was from six snake bites."
"We can't draw your blood. Your condition is not possible," the doctor interrupted as quickly as Alden did.
Draco gasped, either because of the topic Harry was talking about or because he didn't want to guess who Harry was referring to. "Why should I even notice? Or do you want me to help you with it?" he mocked him.
"That—you asked me to wait outside the room. It turns out I could hear a little of your conversation," Draco tried to hide the fact that he was trying to eavesdrop.
Draco stared in disbelief. He tried to free himself from Cedric's grip with all his might, but, for the umpteenth time, Draco's strength was nothing compared to the strength of the man who had spent a quarter of his life on a battlefield covered in blood.
Harry enters, and Draco waits with anticipation. Harry was wearing a neat jet-black suit. His hair, which was slightly long that touched his collar, was slicked back, making him look like a handsome beast who was so charming.
He bit his lower lip, watched the king remove his wolf fur cloak from his body. From his bed, Draco could easily see how incredibly awesome Harry's back was.
The shop owner's face changed, and he let out a long breath as if his expectations were crumbling for a wealthy customer. "It's over here," the man said, leading Draco to a different spot. "It's 80 Pounds Sterling."
Draco turned his blushing face away. The entire palace knew that he and Ares had spent the night together. Alastair even offered him a warm bath, thinking he had a backache. How rude was the God of War when he has sex with his lovers that Alastair kept a stockpile of herbs like that?
Pansy was clearly dissatisfied. She sighed and looked at Draco with a slight smirk. "Are you sure that's all?"
Even though she looked unsure, the maid nodded, then bowed slightly and walked out of the room. Draco could breathe a sigh of relief now. He lay down on the bed, then closed his eyes and fell asleep.
Harry returned Draco's gaze, no less piercing. "Because you are my lover, and Hyde is targeting us."
Harry's refusal managed to make the happy smile that graced Arabelle's lips disappear instantly. The girl in the light pink dress looked at the king with a confused look.
Now Draco understands. They are the children of the devil. If one day their creator wakes up, then they will take side with him. "You look like an angel to me," Draco teased.
The only noticeable difference between gods and humans was that their physiques were usually more attractive. The humans thought that the gods were nobles and wealthy landlords or relatives of kings who had enough money to buy expensive food and clothes.
"We're taking a short break. You can take this break to eat," said Harry without bothering to turn his head back and look at his group.
"I meant that, but I don't think I'll be able to ignore you," Ares said quietly as he placed his palm softly on the prince's cheek. "I'm not comfortable with the fact that your existence has bothered me, Troya." Ares continued.
Harry did it because he was very passionate about Draco. He was very, very excited, and Draco was in no condition to resist him. Harry's body was on top of the pretty boy, and Draco, already under the influence of the drug, teased him with his squirm and inviting hips. Harry propped himself up on his elbows, keeping his hard chest from resting on Draco's more petite body. Harry lowered his head and tasted Draco's lips, which were so alluring and hot, they were sweet to taste.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Harry and Arabelle seem to be having fun with their backs to Draco. This way, Draco could leave without having to be afraid that Harry would catch him again.
And it didn't take long; Harry immediately stepped firmly into the royal garden, which was certainly far from the crowd. Harry knew that his mistress had been peeking at him. His naive mistress would surely follow Harry right away.
His polite remark was only answered with a grunt from the aged man. Secretly, Draco took a shaky breath. Their relationship was getting more and more strained, even though they share the same blood.
"He's only human. What kind of damage can he do? Why are you so angry with me? I've made more mischief than this. Why now?"
"I'm worried about disturbing your sleep. I think the bed was too small for both of us." Draco reasoned.
Draco only grunted in return, although he couldn't help but enjoy the gentle treatment Harry was giving him. Honestly, it was strange, bizarre, yet it feels good at the same time.
Even so, Ares always hoped that Hephaestus would make a new sword for him. He was the best blacksmith in the world—fitting his title as the god of volcanoes and blacksmiths. Unfortunately, it's been thousands of years since they haven't really greeted each other because his wife Aphrodite had an affair with Ares.
Harry and Icarus groaned in pain, and they finally released their grip on each other. Icarus stood up and adjusted his clothes. Harry also stood up, glared at Draco, and just disappeared. Draco didn't care if the man was angry. Soon he will be free of him.
"Honestly, Dray," Pansy's tone seemed to be asking Draco to look back at her. "If I pay attention, Potter likes to get your attention the most. I'm quite sensitive, you know. I do occasionally find Potter looking at us, but not at me, but—"
Alden shrugged his shoulders. “Mr. Tom harbored anger towards you, master. Mostly because your actions have entirely crushed the entire project planning."
When he saw Draco and Greyson's togetherness in the garden, Harry seemed to want to explode. He was jealous. But why? Is it because Harry doesn't like what was his to be taken by someone else? Yeah, it could be because now Draco was his lover.
The sound of the blade scraping against the rough cement was as different as the sound of a beautiful melody in Draco's ears. The sound seemed to be about to awaken another side of Draco, the side he had been overcoming for so long as he was made queen of this kingdom.
Ares chuckled, feeling amazed, confused, and surprised at the prince's request. "You're not wrong. You must have heard from my people how I abandon my lovers and ignore them when I'm bored. I don't think there's any point in pretending to be nice to you. I really can't guarantee that I'll still like you, Troya." Ares responded.
Draco lay down with Harry lying on his side facing him, the man kissing his forehead, temples, the tip of his nose, cheeks with soft little kisses, then Harry's lips stopped on Draco's lips, tasting them a little at each end, blowing off the wet warmth. Makes Draco open his lips with longing.
Draco chose to remain silent. The young man didn't want to waste his energy arguing with his father about the same issue every time they met.
The long-haired beauty squeezed his inner muscles tight around Harry’s cock, keeping him in place, and devoured the other's mouth in an enthusiastic and passionate kiss. Harry gasped against him, the occasional moan passing through his lips. Draco loved the sounds he made. His gaze focused on Harry's face as they kissed, noting how those green eyes were closed in concentration and sweat covered the tanned forehead.
As for Draco, he watched the whole thing from where he was sitting. He noticed Arabelle crying into Harry's chest. It would be a lie if Draco didn't envy the young woman. She was free to express her feelings without fear of anyone reproaching her.
"Because she doesn't seem to like me. I just wanted to try to make a good impression on her." Draco reasoned.
Draco couldn't understand why this man in front of him wanted him so badly and wanted Draco to love him. Is this the only way so he can kill Draco? But he can kill Draco anytime, anywhere with his power.
"The air is getting colder. It would be better if Your Majesty returned to the tent," Cedric said formally, lifting his ass from the wood he had just sat on the last few minutes.
"For the great Zeus! Thank goodness, Troya!" Not yet finished bursting out with nausea, suddenly several people appeared in the room. One of them approached him, then hugged and stroked his head.
"Yeah, I hope so too." Greyson checked his watch. “Looks like I have to go now. I have an appointment with my parents to have lunch together." He got up from his chair, then straightened the suit he was wearing.
"It's a marriage, Ares! You haven't done that in the thousands of years you've lived. The bond never mattered to you. Don't you agree with me not believing in marriage? Why now?" Aphrodite did not immediately believe her lover. She pushed Ares away from her.
Draco flushed again, hating how his physical reaction was so visible. Harry’s tongue ran the length of his member and then back, and then he began sucking on Draco’s balls. Draco let out a gasp at the sensation. His dick quickly swelled to full hardness.
When he got home, his mother was not home yet. His mother always comes home at night, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, because there are more restaurant visitors on these days. Draco opened the refrigerator and took out a box of cereal, complete with milk. After taking the bowl, he prepared his meal.
Deftly, Harry shifted Draco's sleeping position from sideways to supine. Harry was a little grateful that his wife didn't seem bothered by Harry's actions. He seemed to be very tired.
"Shut up, Draco! Why are you always talking?! Do you want your vocal cords to break?!" A shout escaped Cedric's mouth when he caught Draco was about to say another useless sentence.
He looked at Draco coldly and hissed softly. "Just close that window at night!" And full of pride, Harry stepped out of Draco's room, leaving the door thudding behind him.
He was trying to remember something in his past that could help him deal with this situation. Draco often competes in acting with famous Hollywood actors and models. Some of them even openly asked him out. However, most Draco decided to end it after a few dinners together because he was too busy with his career.
Draco had accidentally looked at the channel history when he was watching a gossip show. Draco felt that what the host said was ridiculous. They discuss artifacts from the past, examine shapes and images that resemble humans dressed as astronauts, and conclude that aliens have come to earth thousands of years ago and claim to be gods.
As a stalker, Hector was too attractive. He has light brown hair with a handsome outline. His blue eyes give off a masculine feel. His body was also naturally shaped through the forging of military training since he was young. That person was clearly not on steroids, let alone consuming protein drinks to build muscle. But his good looks didn't help. Hector scares Troya with his excessive attention.
Draco sat on the edge of the crystalline lake, busy watching the trail of water beetles pass by. He didn't have much entertainment in Sparta. He was tired of playing dice or listening to musicians strumming the lyre. He even fell drowsy and almost fell asleep because of it.
Without saying anything, Harry slipped his hand between the girl's thigh and back to carry her in bridal style.
Draco felt his angst and frustration begin to set in as his anger at himself and all the hatred for Harry came back to his mind. He scrubbed angrily at his skin, feeling dirty from all the events of tonight. Halfway through cleaning up the fluids in his buttocks, the door opened.
"I can't," Draco denied as he rose from his seat. He was just about to take vast strides out of the library, which was currently only filled by him and Cedric, but the grip on his hand made the young man stop his steps.
"No... This... It's not because of the bugs..." Arabelle stuttered as she touched the bluish blotches that stood in stark contrast to her long, pale neck.
"Come on," Harry said as he reached out his hand to help Draco so he could quickly get on the horse. After making sure Draco was seated comfortably on the horse, Harry mounted the horse.
Harry glanced at Draco's bound wrist and realized that it was hurting Draco. "Don't move around, or you'll get bruises when this is over."
Draco looked at him expressionlessly, even though he was actually feeling a little apprehensive. The Omega, Harry's soulmate, has already left this pack for one year due to the tragic accident that happened at the time. All of this, this stupid and unreasonable offer—supplication—would never have happened if the soulmate was alive and healthy—literally.
"We're about to leave right away, but there's a change of plans. We'll continue our journey by horse. We're leaving this ungrateful human kingdom right now." one of them spoke.
Harry's expression immediately changed, the man rose from his chair, and half sat on the bed, hugging Draco. "Draco? What's wrong with you? Draco?" he asked worriedly.
King Harry James Potter strode so valiantly onto the dance floor, his hand tightly gripping Draco's. Draco was the same as Harry. The young man walks so gracefully. It made all the guests there gasp in amazement. Finally, they could witness firsthand the ideal noble couple in this decade.
Draco continued to stare blankly at Terence even until the man finished his sentence. Without saying anything, Draco then withdrew his hands that rested on Terence's broad shoulders.
Draco doesn't know what made him wake up from a deep sleep. Was it because of the strange pain in his body or the bright light that suddenly appeared out of nowhere? Draco opened his eyes, his vision was blurry at first glance, and he tried to focus himself. That room, with a feminine white tone.
Never in his life had Draco done anything like this. However, despite how he was sure to feel in the morning, Draco knew he would never feel more satisfied after a session of sex than he did at this moment.
Narcissa turned and looked at Draco. "Hi, sweety. What do you want me to make for your breakfast?" she asked.
Hector was silent. He didn't dare to refute all of that clearly because there was a speck of faith in him who was also a worshiper of Ares—if that could be true. However, Troya who should be dead, can now live and walk again because of taking medicine given by the God Ares. The entire palace believed that it was a divine miracle.
"Yeah, that's possible. It's not the first time Ares was grown tired of his lovers and left them. But if he had wanted to, you wouldn't be here now, and he's still letting you roam around his palace and gathering spices," Eros hummed.
"No! I will never bear the child of a man I don't love. Even if you were to kill me, I would never do it." Draco said stubbornly as he steeled his shaky heart.
Draco turned to Harry and glared at him, telling him to shut up, or maybe he should just walk away from this room.
"Yes, I'm Troya," Draco found it odd because it wasn't his real name. "Just calling you Ares? No need for 'your highness Ares' or 'Lord Ares'?" The boy confirmed carefully.
"What do you think we should do to get the weavers back to weaving linen?" asked Harry to his wife, who at this time seemed to be busy writing right at a luxurious wooden table opposite him.
Harry frowned. He sensed something was different. "I just came back from the market swapping out my wrong clothes," said Harry, to which Draco gave the nod.
Draco bit his lower lip. For a moment, his heart hesitated. Draco needed clothes right now, considering he wasn't wearing anything under Harry's thin robes. Besides, he was also feeling cold right now.
The sun was very bright, but the thick trees act as a light filter to keep it shaded. Draco could also see some of the large fields where sword practice or duels were held. There were currently dozens of Ares' trained soldiers using it. The sound of swords and spears colliding sounded loud but blended harmoniously with the gurgling of the river water there.
For a moment, Draco wanted just to run away. But he realized this was a challenge. Harry challenged him, and Draco wouldn't lose.
The blonde let out another sob. Finally, Harry began thrusting in and out. He kept his motions shallow at first, before finally sheathing himself in and out of Draco’s hole over and over again. With a final sob, Draco came so hard that he blacked out. Harry’s orgasm came to the second Draco clenched down, and his cum spurted inside the long-haired man.
"Today is your birthday?" asked Harry, placing his hands on the table and resting his chin on his palms.
The man's big, strong arms held him until his hands felt stiff and sore. But Draco didn't give up; he struggled with all his might, scratching and biting his arm, which still felt as hard as a rock. He was panting, and his face was red with anger and shame because, as a man, his strength was so powerless to withstand the domination of his fellow male power.
Harry's eyes were still scanning the files in his hand as if the news about Tom Riddle suddenly disappearing was not because of him. Of course, Harry had already made sure that Tom Riddle would never appear again after he planned to kill him, and it actually resulted in Draco, who had to be seriously injured and hospitalized.
While running towards the stated location—he also thought about the familiar-looking face of the Satyr. Maybe he was one of the god followers, but he couldn't remember. Ares also passed a tame riding horse that was chewing a mulberry bush. He thought it was the prince's horse. Ares caught him and tied him to a tree. The prince was probably not far from there, and he thought of taking her home with the horse.
Draco knew all the guests must be adoring their current intimacy, but Draco also knew this intimacy was just a pseudo-intimacy. Draco could feel there was no spark of love in the eyes of the man who had been his husband for the past five years.
"Don't you know that coercion like that can be traumatizing? I want to live this marriage happily. That's why I ask you to wait until I'm ready," Draco said, sounding hurt. "And you agreed..."
"I'm Ares' lover, the mother of his children. Whereas you are his wife now, I just wanted to know if you suddenly wanted to do something reckless trying to hurt me or something. I have to get ready."
"Draco," Harry growled as he felt Draco's hot, smooth, and so tightly wrapped body, teasing him to reach the fastest possible gratification. But no, tonight for Draco. Harry wanted Draco to remember every second of their sex tonight.
"No, be careful talking like that, prince of Sparta. On Olympus, that title is very serious. We have twelve major gods and dozens of minor gods. They are our leaders. We are only Titans living in the land of the earthlings in peace." Argus explained.
"No, Your Majesty. The linen fabric made in our kingdom is high-quality linen. No people will refuse to pay that 5%. Apart from quality, our linen fabric has also become one of the things exhibited by the young nobles when they're at a party, of course, with the addition of 5%, the young nobles will be more interested in buying because they want to show off the linen fabric which seems more expensive than the previous linen."
The words Draco had just said made Harry feel rage again. He doesn't like it. The King turned his glare to Draco, but the glare meant nothing to Draco as usual.
"How does it feel? Does… Does it hurt? Ah, no... Arabelle says it feels great." Draco mumbled, which Glenice could still hear.
"What?" Draco's voice unconsciously tightened. Everything related to Harry makes him tense, and he wants to curse at anyone near him.
Draco turned his head to find Harry standing, relaxed, leaning slightly against the nearby window. The man seemed to have been standing there for a long time. He must have heard clearly all the insults that had been thrown at Draco earlier. Draco's cheeks blushed even more, embarrassed and humiliated.
He was preoccupied with the matter of his country's feud with Thebes. Time and again, his troops experienced difficulties because Thebes was now experiencing rapid progress in military strength. It was something Sparta had not previously anticipated.
"My answer is still the same. I wouldn't want to have a child with a man I don't love," Draco replied with his eyes glaring at the aged man, who, unfortunately, was his father.
"What is this? I may not be reincarnated in ancient Greece, but I may be in a Disney world." Draco said to himself, feeling ridiculous.
Draco watched Harry's face slowly. He could see the look of worry and frustration over his handsome face. Draco knew he had to do something. Without saying anything, Draco stepped smoothly toward his husband's desk. He made brief eye contact with Harry before he decided to kneel right next to Harry.
Besides being famous for his beauty and grace, Draco was also famous for his skill in carrying out royal duties and his soft and sincere heart. Ah, and of course, Draco was always praised by the royal servants because the young man had been so proud to accept Harry's
Harry felt like he was going crazy. He hasn't had sex with any women lately. Because he's not interested, his craving was centered on Draco. This young man made him want to subdue him, conquer, and dominate him possessively. Harry wanted Draco to bend to his feet, adoring him as so many people did to him.
Even though they'd tried to deal with the heat by installing cool marble and designing every room with tall columns and niches—it didn't really help.
Suddenly Harry raised his hand. "Of course it can. Demons have a strong appeal, and angels have never tasted worldly things that demons can offer."
"Don't you want to come down?" asked Cedric, amused as he looked at Draco, who still seemed amazed at what was in front of him.
"Would you like to rest first, Prince Troya? The horse can be tiring for an inexperienced person like you," Alastair offered kindly.
The cut was neatly arranged. Even when checked now, no one would notice. But as the car went, and about 10 kilometers from here, just as they entered the suburban area with the winding road and the big tree on either side of it to Harry's house, the cable would break.
Harry was already halfway to stripping his tie and laying down on the bed if he hadn't remembered that Ron had been waiting for him for quite some time in the front yard of the packhouse.
"You thought you just came back from another world?" sneered the man, and he rushed across the street when the light turned green.
"I should have guessed this, with a very beautiful face and a husband who doesn't love you, it's impossible if there are no members of the royal family who have a crush on you, Your Majesty," Terence crooked a smile.
. We're not going to do anything inappropriate. Why are you so worried, Your Majesty?" asked Cedric mockingly.
All of Draco's actions did not escape one particular man's eyes, emitting tremendous anger. That male tried to suppress his anger, but he couldn't, much less to see the woman he loved chatting so happy with his own father. For some reason, that man wanted to vent the anger and jealousy that had burned his heart.
If Draco looks around, it's not just his clothes that are weird, this room is just as weird. The rooms are old-fashioned with only candlelight to light them. There is a large bed with tall pillars covered with a mosquito net attached beautifully, making Draco tempted to sleep there.
He was on guard, and he began to guess who had entered this royal chamber without the slightest bit of courtesy. Draco knew it couldn't be his husband. Harry was a nobleman who had been trained to be the ideal king since he was young. Harry would never break down a door violently, even if it were his own bedroom door.
Everyone is always afraid of Harry. The man was as handsome as an angel, but his heart was as black as a devil, that's what people said. Everyone adored him and kept their distance out of fear. What they don't know is that sometimes, his master can be like an angel completely, both in appearance and in his heart.
"All right. I will call my Godfather to track and fetch me." Draco reached into his trouser pocket for his cell phone.
The park in the city center is quite crowded these days. He and Ron sat in one of the quieter spots and watched the commotion in the garden from a distance. Ron narrowed his eyes, repeatedly tapping Harry on the shoulder and pointing at each Omega that happened to pass by. Harry massaged the bridge of his nose. He already knew this was a bad idea. He regretted being interested in trying Ron's method.
"Then... How did His Majesty create the spot?" Draco asked again with a curious glint already in his eyes. Glenice's heart suddenly dropped when she heard Draco's question.
"Firstly, I have handed over a lot of treasures to the king of Sparta as a wedding favor. Second, we haven't even officially announced our relationship with the Titans. Third, if I wanted to kill you, why would I bother looking for you in the middle of the forest like this?" Ares explained.
Harry narrowed his eyes, watching Draco from head to toe. "It's too easy if I let you go, you will definitely find a way to get revenge again, and it's too easy if I kill you. Your body is too good to die in vain." Harry stepped closer, and Draco immediately stepped back automatically.
Draco has found the exit. He was right in front of the gate even now. But just as he tried to get out, the scent of burning iron transmitted from the gate. Draco saw the iron gate emitting smoke as he tried to grab hold of it. Draco was surprised and immediately pulled his hand away from the iron.
"Are you currently trying to seduce other noblemen? Aren't you satisfied with just having His Majesty?"
Tired of all the tension, he looked around the large, hall-like room with a throne in it. He saw familiar faces in Troya's memory. His older sisters, as well as the sons and daughters of the concubines. There was no genuine sorrow in their faces. Troya was not close to his siblings. Troya's parents were calling their whole family tonight for a farewell dinner.
Harry cleared his throat in a low affirmative, answering the man's question completely, and it made Draco sink his face into Harry's shoulders even further, embarrassed.
"I'll bet bad thoughts are running through your little head." Busy in his thoughts, Draco didn't notice Harry's arrival. He studied Harry. The man looked tired.
Hello, guys! Sooo, before reading this story, there are a few things I want to point out related to the story.
When Draco reached the point of losing consciousness, there was another, no less violent splash in the pool. Within seconds, a strong arm grabbed him, lifted his body, and then brought him to the surface. Draco's limp body was lying on the floor at the edge of the pool, and then he felt his stomach squeezed expertly until the swallowed water flowed out.
"They... The maids... They didn't say that the dandelion garden at the end of the palace contained many caterpillars. They... They also laughed at me when I showed my legs..." Arabelle explained in the middle her cry.
Draco turned his head to find Harry, who was folding his arms across his chest. "I thought this is for me, and you don't eat the food of mortals anyway," he said sarcastically. Considering that the man once taunted Draco as 'mortal', now Draco is taking his revenge.
"Since it's quite a distance from here, we have to get our horses on quickly. I know you don't want us to come back late, and Harry will get mad again," said Cedric when Draco's horse was right beside his.
"Of course, I want to come down," Without accepting Cedric's hand, he jumped off Cedric's horse. Draco's eyes were instantly locked into the beautiful scene in front of him. That place was truly heaven on earth.
They had not slept in the same room for three days. But Ares decided not to talk about it and was sweet as usual. He was smiling and asking how he was. They were also still eating at the same table, and Ares learned a lot of new things from his wife.
That afternoon, the house was peaceful, and Draco walked through the house's first-floor area. The home is so spacious with hallways that are nowhere to go. It didn't seem like one day would be enough to explore the whole house. Draco stopped at an open door and took a little peek. He was fascinated to find the high shelves lining the walls, full of books!
Instead, Luna's face turned serious. She leaned forward and whispered. "That's a prophecy concerning
The clothes Draco had bought him were so numerous that it required three large suitcases to pack them, not to mention one large suitcase containing a collection of shoes that Draco didn't even get to wear.
"Ah yes, I almost forgot to ask, what are you doing here?" Cedric asked. He walked over to the horse Draco had stroked gently.
Draco and the rest of the palace hall witnessed a sight that they had never seen. The vulture trembled and spread its wings. Then the bird squealed loudly as if it had just had a shot of adrenaline. Clumps of muscle and veins are clearly visible from beneath the feathers. Its body grew rapidly until it was almost the size of a horse.
Then they fell silent again. No one spoke anymore, either because they didn't know what to say or because they were awkward about the situation. Especially for Harry, this situation was no longer awkward for him but stupid. Ridiculous and stupid. How could Draco still not get a clue from all of his words?
Alden took a deep breath. "Okay, I'll explain, but not here. Come with me." The man turned around and rushed out of the room as if being in the room felt suffocating.
"Your Majesty, you should have let me go. We've already missed the pair swap part." Draco said as he lifted his face so he could see Harry's face.
Draco glanced at his watch. Then he turned his eyes to the street again. Draco saw a man standing in the crowd right in front of him. People seemed unaware of his existence. Of course, they didn't see him. He was an invisible being like the others. But then Draco saw several fairies who were unaware of the man's arrival.
Draco didn't want to be remembered as a bad queen in the annals of history. Draco didn't want to be branded an ignorant wife. He didn't want to accept all the hate speech even when he had rested for good.
Narcissa was busy with the frypan and her ingredients when someone suddenly pulled up a chair beside Draco and sat down. Draco really couldn't believe it. Harry sat beside him without saying anything. His mother naturally didn't notice that immortal man.
Draco turned his head and saw Harry walking into the room, wearing a black shirt and looking incredibly healthy, and it didn't seem like he'd been in an accident. Unconsciously Draco frowned, regretting worrying about Harry.
"Draco," Harry panicked. He supported Draco's body from falling, touched Draco's forehead, and felt how hot his forehead was. Draco has a fever. Harry immediately carried Draco in bridal style.
"I'm not shy, Alastair! Normally one wouldn't discuss this with other people. God! How old are you anyway?"
The music from the orchestra playing made Charless and Draco immediately dance in the middle of the dance floor.
God only knows what Harry would do if the man found out that Draco was pregnant with his child. Therefore, Draco used the excuse that he didn't want to be a substitute for Harry's late wife so he could get out of the house.
"Yes, many of his other lovers were from the Titans, and they lived on Olympus, but never for long,"
In Cedric's two clear grey eyes, he could find a ray of desperation, even though it was barely there, but he realized that the other man was desperate. Though, why did the man desperate?
Instantly, the atmosphere between the husband and wife turned silent. They both didn't know what else to say until Harry accidentally looked at Draco's hands which were currently filled with little birds that seemed to be dying. No. It looks like the bird was dead.
Alden moved, slightly uncomfortable. "Not yet. When he realized that he failed to kill you, he immediately ran away somewhere."
Draco will be hit by Professor Trelawney's never-ending nagging and then have the task of cleaning the toilets until the afternoon. Draco wouldn't let that happen. Quickly, he ran out of the building and looked for a taxi.
"You're scared, Potter, you're afraid I hurt this young man, I can see it in your eyes," Doctor Jason looked at Harry with a crazy smile, fiddling with his knife around Draco's neck. "Just one cut, I will cut his veins, right in the neck, the blood will gush out, and he will die quickly, right in front of your eyes, and I am willing to die for the satisfaction of watching that scene."
Icarus laughed. "Actually, that's not the story. But mortals certainly don't know the truth," he said.
Ron paused, then shrugged his shoulders. "I don't think we should get involved in Harry Potter's business. He's a wonderful business partner, and I'm glad my company is working with his company, but from a personal perspective..." Ron ran his fingers across Hermione's back. "I don't really like him."
"How about it, Draco? Either you promise to be nice, and I'll let you out humanely, or you choose to act stupid, and then maybe I'll tie you up in a sack and lock you up in the warehouse," Harry's voice outside snapped Draco from his reverie.
Draco was just about to open his mouth and answer the question, but his husband had already cast a disapproving look on the King of the Delion. With just that gaze, the older man managed to lose the wide smile.
"You talk as if you're going to come out victorious, Prince Cedric. Such overconfidence will kill you," Draco said calmly.
"I told you my idea was ridiculous. However, without offending you, it's the first and last option you can make if you refuse to go alone. After all, this is just a companion and nothing more," explained Ron.
When Draco looked at Harry, he can't help but remember their lovemaking last night flashed in his mind. Unable to endure all those erotic memories, Draco looked away. "None of your business,"
"What? Don't gods and goddesses always work miracles with their magic? Why do they resist the magic?" Draco was confused. How about a vulture turning giant? Wasn't that magic?
A tear rolled down the corner of Draco's eye. He was desperate in his attempt to escape. "Don't do this, please..."
"Scared, Malfoy?" Harry uttered sarcastically. “You are afraid that you will give up in my arms, aren't you? I offered you here earlier, wanted to see how far you dare to be alone with me in the same room, it turns out that you run away afraid like a rabbit to be eaten."
"I'm just feeling a little bored, and it looks like I need to see the night sky before I sleep." Draco lifted his head again to look up at the sky.
"Do you mean by making him a Titan? You know that it can't. We need a Titan with a god title who is willing to guarantee his life."
"Easy for you to talk, Ares. Because you have power, you're the son of Zeus. While I'm only human," Draco bit his lip. Once again, he was wracked with feelings of insecurity and worry.
Harry wiped his face with both hands as the tragic event—the nightmare—came back to haunt him. The day when the center of his world was snatched away from him. The day his soul went with the person he loved the most, Ginny Weasley, soulmate for life and death.
Luckily they weren't in the palace corridor at the moment. Otherwise, Glenice might have managed to create quite a stir.
Harry took a shaky breath. For some reason, the attention his own brother had for his wife disturbed his peace of mind.
Draco dropped himself on the soft white chair right in front of the royal concubine with a graceful motion. Draco knew the concubine was looking at him with admiration.
Her queen was indeed very stubborn; Glenice knew that. Persuading Draco to give up his intentions was impossible. After Glenice finished curling his hair and lightly blushed his pale cheeks, Draco immediately stepped out of his camp tent. Outside the tent, Draco could see many guards and servants walking around, and they seemed busy.
Draco chose to remain silent about his father's words, but his eyes couldn't lie that he didn't like his father's presence right now.
"But I'm not Elle! We are clearly different. She is a woman and I am a man. So let me go, I am not a substitute for your wife!" Draco couldn't help but sound annoyed.
"Oh no, for us Amazonians, if they go too far, we'll cut off some of their fingers," Attica smiled as he said it. Draco responded with an awkward laugh. It seemed he didn't need to teach an Amazonian woman to defend herself.
"Okay, I'll be there in a minute," Harry said to the guard, who replied with a nod. The guard took the time to bow before he left Harry and Draco.
Why did Harry reject Draco's suggestion? Did Harry not want to be with her? Was Harry tired of her? Is she no longer attractive in the eyes of the king?
Damn it! Harry clenched his jaw as he felt uneasy even though he had poured all his desire into his mistress's body. He rose from his position and grabbed the satin robe not far from the bed with a grunt.
"My name is Vlad, and I want you." A pair of fangs can be seen growing from Vlad's mouth. Sows terror to a Draco because Vlad looks abnormal for a human.
Draco was really mad at Harry. Harry was a complete mix of everything Draco hated, insolent, disrespectful, and obnoxious. Maybe that's why God created him with extraordinary physical perfection, to compensate for his vices.
Draco tried to think, and he had not checked the bathroom at the end of the room. There may be a way out of there that escaped surveillance. He quickly stepped into the bathroom, but his steps staggered. Somehow his head felt dizzy, and his whole body was shaking… Hot… What was this? Draco touched his forehead, it was hot.
"You're right, and I envy you. You're lucky that you were born so ugly that even a Satyr wouldn't want to marry you," Draco said as though concerned.
Without further ado, Harry threw his jacket on the chair, loosened his tie, and gave Draco a sharp look. "What did you say to Ron's Wife?"
Harry finally turned to Draco. His face was crimson red, and he couldn't hide his nervousness. "Well, this might sound weird, but I'm serious." he took a deep breath and looked straight at Draco. "I like you, Draco. I don't know since when, but I'm sure I've been attracted to you since we first met." he paused for a moment, seeing how Draco was reacting. The blonde remained silent, inviting him to continue speaking. "It's up to you how you look at me after this, but I'm serious. I like you. I love you, Draco,"
Draco gasped, trying to struggle with all his strength. But it's useless because Harry is stronger than him. "Are you going to force me again?!" Draco screamed in his attempt to break free. "If so, then you have proven to me that you are indeed a bastard who can only get what you want from rape!"
The smile on Harry's lips was a cold, triumphant smile. "Then come here, my darling." The man opened his arms, and Draco stepped hesitantly toward him. With a sensual gesture, the man grabbed Draco and briefly kissed those pink lips. "Good, don't test my patience. I don't want to be challenged tonight."
Cedric felt the relationship between him and Draco had progressed so significantly. In fact, they had just officially hooked up one day ago. Perhaps, this was all because they already knew each other well enough to accept each other's feelings with an open heart.
Troya was uncomfortable with all of Hector's attention. Even though the man claimed to think of Troya as his younger brother, he knew that Hector's concern was not genuine because he also has an older brother, and they all never care when Troya was sick or injured.
Harry left Draco on the dance floor alone. Luckily Draco smiled happily, so Harry's departure didn't invite many questions from the gossipy-loving royal guests.
"How is your relationship with her?" Harry asked curiously as he gently twirled Draco's body on the dance floor.
Everyone there supported the fact that King Harry and Queen Draco of the Shinia Kingdom were the ideal couples for a decade.
He felt confused. Why these past few days, people around him were asking about other men in Draco's life? Don't they know that Draco really loves his current position? He wasn't blind. He wouldn't let love overwhelm him till he left this position his family so coveted.
Not wanting to waste any more time, Draco stepped right in. But suddenly, the blonde's body froze as he felt a strong hand hug him from behind. He felt the head of the owner of the firm hand now drop onto Draco's satin-covered shoulder.
Harry's eyes lit up Draco's pale face with a sharp and unfriendly gaze. Oh, come on, Draco was just expressing his opinion, but why did the man act as if Draco had committed a fatal offense?
Long time no see, guys. I mean, long time no see, especially for this fic. It's been three months, huh? Sorry for making you wait for so long.
Draco bit the hand that was covering his mouth. But the hand did not let go of his mouth and instead pulled him into the corner of the room. Suddenly Draco is in another place. But it felt like he recognized the place quite well. Reflexively, Draco elbowed the face of the person who was still covering his mouth, and finally, the person pulled their hand away.
The Prince looked at him doubtfully but immediately answered, "I think I sprained my leg a little bit."
Draco closed his eyes and tried not to cry. He does not want to be an emotional man just because of the forbidden love that his brother-in-law was currently offering.
Draco held the reins of his horse in a graceful motion. At this moment, he was the center of attention of the guards standing guard right behind Draco. Right now, Draco was no different than a goddess who had descended from the sky.
Perhaps of all the people there, Harry was the only one who looked at the girl with admiration because the people in this kingdom threw their disgust stares at Arabelle.
Harry was struck by lightning on the spot. He turned his head very quickly at Ron. "You're out of your mind."
Draco's heart began to double. Cedric's sad face looked at him with a look of tender love, a look he would never get from his husband. The other man's hand that gently stroked his hand managed to make him feel comfortable.
"I've written a prescription for the medicine Mr. Draco must take." The doctor bowed slightly. "I'll excuse myself, Mr. Potter." Then the doctor walked away, with Alden escorting him out.
There was no glint of nervousness or bewilderment in Draco's eyes. He sighed when he heard Cedric's words. Without saying anything, Draco took a step away from Cedric. Even though Draco was eager to be in love with someone, if that man were Cedric, of course, it would be the wrong choice.
"He didn't touch his food at all. We put his food in the room, and he just sleeps there. When we looked at the tray, he didn't touch it, not even his drink. You have to do something before that kid puts himself in danger, master." Alden replied dryly, although there was a hint of worry there.
Harry growled fiercely, his eyes burning. "Try it if you dare ask Hermione to release you, and if that woman dared to do something, I would take her life away." Harry hissed furiously. "And I never messed with what I said, Draco, your freedom will be replaced by the lives of those who let their guard down or those who try to save you."
"This is the only way you won't be in pain anymore, honey," Harry's voice sounded a little hoarse. "Let me help you."
Draco was stunned. This guy's really weird. Why would he ask Draco to love him? As if no immortals willing to love him, and he's desperate for not getting anyone.
The toilet is quite crowded. Draco walked into the cubicle and locked the door. What a challenging and unexpected day. Who would have thought he would meet his guardian angel? Maybe Icarus really was Draco's guardian angel because Harry had said the same thing.
Draco didn't open his mouth, but he lifted his face and looked at Cedric's handsome face under the moonlight.
The king wrapped his arms around Arabelle's slender waist. He let Arabelle play with his palms. His mistress matched the shape of her hands with the shape of his hands.
Draco's face turned pale. Is Harry really going to hurt Hermione? He remembered the gentle smile on Hermione's pretty face and her kind heart. Oh my God, Hermione was his only chance to escape. But if Harry was going to injure Hermione in return, then Draco had no chance.
"Don't you want to be with me, Draco? We fit so well in bed, you and me. We can have a mutually beneficial relationship.”
Hearing his name, Draco felt both tense and excited, but Alastair forced him off the wall for fear that he and the prince would get in trouble. Draco couldn't do anything more and sat down with his lips pursed in annoyance.
With a frown polishing his forehead, Draco decided to examine the horse's body covered in pure white fur. Everything was fine until his eyes caught a black animal that seemed to be having its time enjoying the blood of the poor horse.
Draco enjoyed the freedom in and out of this room to the fullest. Oh, he still wants to leave this house, but not now. He's still traumatized by yesterday's incident. At least in this house, he's safe. Alden still watches him quietly as Draco paces out of the room, especially when he took a walk in the garden. But Draco learned to ignore him.
Draco gasped, feeling Harry's warm breath against his cock. Instantly he straightened up to sit but was caught by the bonds on his wrists. "Don't!!" he shouted frantically, trying to squeeze his legs together, preventing Harry's lips from moving further.
Draco's heart skipped a beat when he heard a male voice that had only been in his mind for a few seconds. Draco quickly looked up and saw Harry looking at him with a surprised look.
"That if I recover, I will marry Ares?" He concluded it himself, for the King seemed shaken to continue.
The man ducks slightly, pressing his lips to Draco's full, pink ones, slipping his tongue inside that small, hot mouth. "Cummin' baby-! Oh, fuck...
Again, Cedric was made to chuckle at Draco's antics. "Of course you can," said Cedric, which made Draco smile happily.
Draco didn't even have the will to go back to his house. He wanted to go somewhere. Anywhere. He didn't want to go back, no matter where it was. He just wanted to disappear from this world. His footsteps stopped in front of a building and trying to raise his hand to press the doorbell.
Charles's smile grew wider when he heard Draco's compliment. He had often heard compliments about his good looks from many people, but somehow when Charles heard those compliments come out of Draco's seductive lips, he couldn't help but feel very happy right now.
Harry decides not to choose anyone when his gaze fixates on a particular person. The 'woman' who looks out of place in this fancy nightclub was wearing extraordinarily sexy clothes but looks uncomfortable in them. Unconsciously a wicked smile appeared on his lips.
The trunk opened suddenly, and Draco wasn't ready to struggle. Besides, it's useless struggling. Behind Harry, who was standing proudly, were several bodyguards with sturdy bodies that looked like stone. Seeing how they looked, Draco knew they would not hesitate to injure him if he did something that would harm either one of them.
A young woman in a pink dress with a large ribbon on her waist ran into the room without noticing the presence of two figures who had filled the room. Her face was decorated with clear crystals. Without saying anything, the girl in the pink dress immediately threw her ass right on Harry's lap.
"Harry Potter, your boyfriend." The woman shrugged her shoulders in the direction of Harry's retirement. "He defended you bravely in front of those annoying women…whoops." The woman covered her lips with tapered fingers. "I can't say it, but they are annoying, right? If it weren't for my husband, I wouldn't want to attend this party and mingle with them." the woman laughed again.
"You watched a werewolf movie?" asked Harry. Finally, the man spoke. Draco thought he wouldn't talk.
"No big deal, you say? Bringing humans to Olympus is an offense. Besides, you picked up that boy by announcing your status as the God of War, Ares!" Hera responded angrily.
Ares smiled, finding Aphrodite's jealousy slightly adorable. The Goddess of Beauty never loses her charm. Her hair was golden blonde with magnificent curls like it had been embroidered by a fairy. Her naturally pink lips look full of seductiveness. Her body, even though she has given birth to many, was still perfectly sensual.
Their lovemaking is a very passionate and exquisite pleasure. Draco gripped Harry's muscular shoulders, forgetting the pain in his head, too immersed in the pleasure that was wracking his body. Harry tried to move as smoothly as possible, but his desire overpowered his senses. He moved furiously, taking Draco with him. And finally, when the peak came, their bodies were so tightly joined, in the rolling waves of satisfaction that smashed against their bodies.
"Soon your birthday... according to the agreement signed by your father, master Harry will marry you."
"You... What do you want?" Draco started to panic when Harry, who was half-sitting on him, unbuttoned his shirt.
Draco's gasped and suddenly felt short of breath. His chest felt like it had been hit by a thousand tons of rock, and it hurt. Wife? Harry had a wife before? And why did the woman's face resemble Draco?
"What kidnappers claim to be kidnappers? If they confess, then hell will be not pleased..." said the man.
Draco listened to all the debates with trepidation. He didn't know what to say but smiled nervously. Does he have the right to speak? Because Troya's parents seem to consider him a property, they can treat him as they please.
And by the time Harry finished playing around, Draco was lying there, limp and helpless with panting breaths and a burning body. Harry lifted himself back up and kissed Draco gently on the lips. His broad chest rubbed against Draco's perky tits, and Draco felt Harry's manhood touch his thigh so seductively as if Harry understood what Draco wanted most.
"Your Majesty, don't you think something strange about His Royal Highness and that stepmother?" Glenice asked Draco when they had stepped out of the garden.
Ron looked straight at Harry. "He asked for help from my wife to be saved so that he can get out of your house."
The cafe door rang, and Draco could see Luna entering the building with orange clothes that made her look stand out.
Harry opened the door of the room where Draco was slowly locked. It was late at night, and Harry did not expect Draco to wake up. The room was dark and dim, but Harry's eyes caught the tray of food that was still intact, only his drink was gone.
"Who is prettier? Me or His Majesty?" Arabelle lifted her head so that her eyes could catch Harry's handsome face, which looked very soothing under the shade of the maple tree where the man was currently leaning his burly back.
“You are in my house, and you need to know, my bodyguards are very unfriendly. I advise you to come down obedient and calm, for your own sake, because my bodyguards might injure you if you act stupid." Harry warned.
"Draco, don't you know that I'm feeling annoyed right now? That self-conscious girl has ruined my happiness tonight. I don't know what I've done until I met that ignorant girl," Cedric grumbled without paying attention to the sentence that had previously been saying.
"I'll beat you up before I kill you," Harry lunged Doctor Jason to the floor, and they wrestled, hitting each other. But Doctor Jason, the Hyde was not used to fighting with his bare hands, so he was overwhelmed. Harry went on and on beating him mercilessly when then Draco's whimpering stopped him.
"In my opinion, it would be better if we give a little extra wage for the weavers who want to weave flax. Because as we already know, the woven linen is very difficult to produce, even though linen is in great demand at this time," Draco replied without thinking. Still, because the young man spoke in a firm tone, the lines that just came out of Draco's mouth sounded very convincing.
For the second time in one day, Draco felt his body not respond at all. His chest rose and fell, the air in his lungs forced out without him being able to breathe. Draco's head grew dizzy, and finally, his eyes closed.
Hadreda did ensure that he would be fine on Olympus as long as he pleases Ares and tries to make friends with the residents. Hadreda invites him to join in watching the soldiers sparring or touring Ares palace. Hadreda introduced him to a lot of people, and that helped Draco adapt.
What about Lucid Dreams? Like in the film Inception, starring Leonardo Dicaprio, humans can control dreams that feel very real. Draco used to have fun studying it. There were several things people can do if they suspect they were in a lucid dreaming situation. First, look for a watch or wall clock. If the needles were odd or more than three, it's most likely a Lucid Dream. But Draco couldn't find the clock anywhere. This was ancient Greece. He couldn't tell the time except when the sun was just rising and setting.
"What did you do with the gate?!" Draco screamed in distress when he saw the man watching him from the balcony.
"Of course, there are some men who are willing. Sometimes it's better to have an affair like that." Cedric replied, cornering Draco.
Draco nodded stiffly. His body was already shaking slightly when he could feel the cold splash of water accidentally hitting his arm. He was about to turn his body and walk towards the river decorated with a small waterfall, but suddenly he remembered something.
Harry flashed a smile as Draco said the word 'destruction'. It was as if he was looking forward to that day and longed for it. Draco was still trying to steady his heart, which was pumping so intensely. Witnessing what he had just seen, Draco couldn't
"Are you happy?" Cedric moved his body in very gentle movements as if he didn't want their togetherness tonight to end so quickly.
"Bastard," Draco hissed irritably. Stomping on his feet, Draco went back into the house to persuade the man. "Come on. I can't just love someone. You're a man anyway, and I don't know your name either."
"Seducer," Draco sneered as he smiled widely and shifted his gaze from Cedric to the large trees that were currently accompanying them.
"Sex with the devil?" Harry raised his eyebrows as he read the title of the book. His gaze at the book's cover immediately moved quickly to Draco as the blonde was still fast asleep.
Ron chuckled, then turned around and hugged Hermione's body. "All right, princess, I'll try." He brought his face close to hers, then kissed her lips sweetly. "Now, can we stop talking about other people and go to sleep? I'm so sleepy, and it's not good for you to sleep late at night. "
Annoyed, Draco walked back to the kitchen and grabbed a rag to clean up the spilled cereal. Harry just stood in the tv room while watching Draco silently. He didn't follow Draco, but Draco felt like he was always being watched.
"I'm saying this because I don't want the Shinia Kingdom to be involved in this rebellion. The plan was, I wanted to coup my father on the day he appointed my stepmother as Empress of this kingdom."
When Harry intimidated him with the threat of throwing him at his bodyguards, Draco felt helpless, and he was furious at himself for being powerless against the other man. Draco has no idea. He felt as if the threats Harry was throwing at him weren't serious. Draco began to realize that Harry was starting — already obsessed with him. Draco doesn't know what kind of obsession Harry has with him.
Alden's words made Draco's heart shrink, but he shook his head, Harry was a cruel man, but Draco couldn't be afraid. Draco must dare to challenge Harry, showing the man that he is not a person who can be tamed so easily. Draco opened the unlocked white door with cautious steps, his eyes peeking out slightly, worried that someone was guarding the entrance. But apparently, Harry thought Draco was too weak for him to have a guard at the door.
Draco didn't answer because he was afraid his mother would hear him speak again, but he didn't nod either. Draco just stared at Harry and blinked a few times. Maybe to him, Draco looked really silly or stupid. And that's precisely what Draco was showing Harry to get him away from him.
Harry propped his chin on his hands. A frown adorned the man's forehead. He seemed to be thinking carefully about the words that just came out of his wife's mouth.
"Have you ever looked bad in my eyes?" Harry asked back, taking one of Arabelle's slender hands and holding it warmly.
In the darkness, the figure was watching. The car's brake cable had been successfully cut. All of that is indeed difficult to do, considering that Harry's bodyguards are always on standby. But don't call him Hyde if it all goes wrong, he fairly popular underworld pseudonym as the most skilled assassin.
Draco never thought that his 'survival' effort that he did—can be sweet, dangerous, and exciting at the same time.
horse could not match him. By morning, Ares had arrived at the foot of Mount Olympus. Here human settlements were rare because humans who stop too deep into Olympus will not return alive. But not only humans were wary when entering Olympus. Even he had to be careful because he could cross paths with the Olympus guardian monster, who was sometimes not very good at choosing his victims.
Draco blinked absentmindedly. My Lady? He tilted his head in confusion, but then he followed the woman without asking anything.
Even though Lucius' face was adorned with fine wrinkles, it still gave off an extremely intimidating aura even though it had lost some of its good looks.
"You don't want to?" Harry spoke again. He had run out of ways to convince Draco to agree to go with him tonight. While Harry had every right to be angry—even chastised—at the refusal of his own subordinates, he did not. Besides, Draco's words had some truth in them. They are not soulmates; he couldn't just ask Draco to be with him and pretend he was his
But then Doctor Jason's words provoked him. He wasn't Potter's whore! "I'm not Potter's whore!" Draco shouted his rebuttal loudly.
Obviously, Harry can satisfy his desires with women who kneel to his charm, but the man chooses to threaten Draco and gives up his ambition to be with Draco. What did the other man want from him? At first, Harry was rude and cunning, but as time went by and since the incident where Hyde kidnaped Draco, Harry's attitude seemed to change. The man surnamed Potter was gentle with him. Well, he's not completely gentle if Draco turns to challenge him. But what else can he do? Draco's grudge and hatred for Harry go deep beyond the Bermuda Triangle.
"Abaddon would never have come straight down to Earth if it wasn't something he wanted so badly." Harry started walking toward Draco. "What's so special about you?" he asked, his voice started to intimidate.
Draco stretched out his hand politely, and Ron shook his hand, then glared at him. It made Draco feel his guts shrink a little under the sharp gaze of those sky blue eyes.
But suddenly, irritation rippled through his chest. What the hell! He is a man. Why is he dressed up as a woman?!
Harry chuckled again. "Alright, you want it," with a nod of his head, he ordered his bodyguard. "Put him in the trunk."
Draco understood the man was speaking informally to him because, actually, Cedric and Draco had known each other for a long time, even long before Draco was betrothed to Harry. He and Cedric got to know each other at their debutante party. They were the same age, and their similar interests made the two children quickly close and formed friendships.
Cedric gasped unconsciously. The man stepped back. Draco, who kept looking at him with a sharp gaze without the slightest remorse, made the man's heart feel like a sharp object was piercing it. It hurts.
"Do you want a drink?" Harry deftly grabbed a glass of water from the bedside table. "Here, I help you drink." Harry got up and lifted Draco's body, then tried to make him stand.
Of course, Cedric immediately gave a very deadly glare at the girl, who looked like a doll. She's wearing jewelry was too childish. Pinks and flowers, sickening!
However, Harry's eyes still weren't on him. As if there was something more interesting to see than to see himself begging.
After serving the noble’s continuous conversations at the party, Draco finally stepped aside from the crowd. Honestly, Draco still really wanted to talk to them a little longer, but when they brought the topic of wealth into their conversation, Draco couldn’t help rolling his eyes in annoyance.
"Just trying to get away from you two!" Draco roared, which only made Pansy and Blaise laugh harder.
Draco let out a slow breath as his slender hand moved to push against the large door. His heart was beating so fast when he saw the figure of an older man who still looked dashing seemed to be waiting for Draco's arrival.
When the fear gripped him, Draco immediately shook his head, trying to regain his courage. He remembered his father and mother's happy faces, then replaced with their pale faces lying in the coffin. Hatred and anger are his weapons against Harry.
"Call the doctor." It was Harry's voice. Was it Harry who saved him? Besides…why did that man save him?
Harry cleared his throat before he opened his mouth. The man also ran his eyes towards the dense trees, which looked less extraordinary than his wife's lips.
Draco took a quick glance at Harry's naked body, standing proudly beside the bed, his face flushed with embarrassment. They were there, red marks on Harry's chest, on Harry's hip, near his manhood. Did he do it?
"Okay," Harry's stare at Draco burned in the cold rain. "Whatever, please make yourself sick. I hope you won't bother me later." The man spun around, but after a few steps, he turned his body back and looked at Draco. "When you're done, I want to talk to you,"
Draco made an exasperated face. "You want everyone to look at me like I'm crazy?" Draco whispered again.
The king's jaw tightened, his eyes immediately shone sharply at his cousin, who seemed indifferent to the events in front of him. "What have you done to Arabelle?!" Harry asked with an angry growl.
1. Seraphim are a higher class of angels but lower in status than archangels. Seraphim are angels that possess great strength and abilities.
Doctor Jason's body collapsed to the floor because of the gunshot. Harry looked back, saw Doctor Jason collapsed with the knife still in his hand, and he then turned his head toward the door, towards Alden, who was holding the gun in his hand.
"Make sure they know you had a great night, Troya," He whispered in his ear as he closed his eyes and hugged him.
They weren't always on Olympus. Their people were scattered throughout Greece and even in other countries. They were called the Titans, with Zeus as their leader. The Titans formed their own communities and mingled with fellow Titans. Sometimes they also interact with humans and act like ordinary civilians.
"Are you drunk?" Draco glanced at the door. It only took a few seconds if Draco wanted to run away from Harry. He can do it.
Draco snorted. “Isn't in this house what Harry Potter wants like a king's orders to be obeyed? I saw with my own eyes how people go back and forth, panicking all day long over your endless madness."
Alastair tells those male satyrs to have a strong sexual desire. They will chase the Nymphs and any woman for intercourse. The satyrs were able to smell women who were in their fertile period.
Seven days he went through his morning sickness without anyone knowing that he was actually pregnant. They assumed that his weak condition and frequent nausea and vomiting resulted from his high fever because it would never have crossed their minds that Draco was carrying a life inside his belly.
The Nymphs and Satyrs, who were not human, took care of the kitchen instead. Of course, the food served was not exactly delicious. Moreover, Nymphs like to eat raw meat. It's only natural that their meat dishes taste tough.
There was a large painting hanging on the wall. A huge painting with a lovely golden frame. But it wasn't the size of the picture or the beauty of the frame that stunned Draco, but the person in the picture.
“You are free to go in and out of this house, but I beg you, don't try to run away from this house. I am evil, but I will take care of you, not so with my enemies."
"I don't care! From the start, you knew I loved you! Even before you got engaged to that crazy Harry! But you kept your heart closed?! What's wrong with you?!" said Cedric, frustrated.
Alden nodded his head. "Daphne has prepared him from an hour ago," Alden bowed, then opened the door for Harry.
Draco couldn't move. His body was getting limp and lost a lot of blood. The sun has risen when Draco lost consciousness.
Draco chuckled inwardly when he heard Natalie's formal question. Draco didn't think she would be in the mood to ask Draco all kinds of questions, considering Draco had once emphasized how chaotic the current state of his household was.
For some reason, the heated atmosphere became silent, and Draco felt all the gazes on him. On the other hand, he was leaning against the bar table, busy with his own thoughts. Draco nervously straightened himself up, trying to meet everyone's stare, then his eyes fixed on that man. The eyes were so green, causing him to seem sucked into that sharp gaze.
"For getting you into this situation," the man shrugged. "A situation like this will be inevitable, considering my condition. But you must know that when you are with me, I will take care of you."
Draco stared at the hand, then growled. Angry, he slapped Harry's hand away and tried to get out of the narrow trunk himself despite a bit of difficulty because his legs and arms were stiffly folded in the cramped space and traveling some ten kilos. Finally, the long-haired man managed to stand out from the trunk with all his pride.
Draco shook his head. "I'm here." His voice sounded flat, and then he began to sob. "Mr. Flitwick is dead, and Abaddon is looking for me now." Draco begins explaining today's events to Icarus.
Draco couldn't understand what was wrong with himself. He does not understand. Draco has tried to be a lover who understands and forgives all the flaws that Harry has.
"Why should you feel inferior, Aphrodite? You will forever be the most beautiful on earth." He seduces again.
Draco's short answer made Cedric race his horse quickly. The journey that should have felt long and a little boring became unnoticed. In front of them, Draco could see a field of blue flowers that looked stunning, although he had not seen the flowers up close.
The sound of Draco's shoe tapping echoed so real amidst the boisterous sound of the orchestra, which was still passionately performing various musical instruments. Draco strode steadily and elegantly toward his seat where he was destined.
"That woman is Seraphina Potter," Alden mumbled dryly, staring deeply into Draco's eyes. They were now sitting in the room at the back of the house, which has direct access to the back garden and was equipped with beautiful, comfortable couches and a table that currently serves hot steaming coffee on top of it.
Cedric took a shaky breath when he saw the other youths who broke the household were walking towards them so cheerfully. The girl even spoke without the slightest bit of shame or hesitation.
"I'm Draco's husband. He has to take the same carriage as me." Harry said and stared at Draco, who had been putting on a calm face.
Only this time, Draco was dancing in the open place, with his dress already touching the damp grass beneath. They danced to the faint sound of the orchestra and the sounds of the small insects that lived in the garden.
"Yeah, the maids are probably speculating and waiting for each other when will they finally find proof that you and Mr. Potter slept together to be used as the next gossip," she muttered in a smile, then looked at Draco with a raised eyebrow. "Hey, I'm also wondering, if they were serious about looking for it, would they find any evidence, Draco?" she asked meaningfully.
"Always mentioning that," grumbled Harry irritably. "I still don't want to talk about it," the man gave Draco an attentive look. "I asked you to do something for me."
"What are you doing here?" asked Alastair. Draco frowned slightly because he was confused by the stiff interaction between the two people called family.
Draco tilted his head. This time he really didn't understand what the man meant. "Listen," Draco began to speak, finally. "I know I can see immortal creatures, so I'm not surprised anymore. You better return me to London, wherever I am now."
"No, my King! I can't hurt Troya!" Hector knelt. He realized that the King could suspect him after this. A king does not need evidence, let alone a court, to convict someone.
Draco's body clung weakly to Harry's arm, and then his breath caught in his throat. "Hot... Please... It's so hot...” Once again, Draco confirmed the voice, the sound of heat, as if tortured.
Draco couldn't stand the cold that rushed over him. He then closed his eyes tightly and gently stroked his arm, which felt very cold, even his two slender legs were shivering violently.
A man with a very busy agenda like Harry definitely didn't have the spare time to investigate such unworkable matters. Not to mention, those inconvenient things come from Draco, someone who doesn't hold a special place in that man's heart.
"Didn't I say that I would help you escape?" Hector forced Draco to carry him again. They fled into the thick of the trees.
Ares stretched his neck muscles, feeling tired. Athena never wanted to stop bothering him. To the Goddess, Ares was like a pebble that kept getting in the way. According to her, Ares was a disgrace to the Titans because he was barbaric, vile, and immoral.
Draco started to panic as he slowly walked back without making a sound. Where's his guardian angel? Draco thought. He felt like he wanted to scream for help, but screaming means telling him where he is, and Draco doesn't want to get killed.
"What a strange day, lately really strange. Why do these creatures keep appearing in front of me?" Draco grumbled.
Draco was about to open his mouth to refute Harry, but suddenly his head throbbed in pain as if his head had been hit by something hard and big, blurring his vision. Draco's body wobbled, and he just fainted in Harry's arms, who caught his helpless body.
The God of War re-sheathed his sword after making sure that no more monsters would attack him. He saw the dawn starting to rise and the sky turning red. The bride should be arriving today. He also saw the fresh carcass of the bull monster he had killed earlier. Ares scratched his chin and got the idea to bring a present for his new wife.
Draco realized what would happen next. Ares gave him a deep and passionate kiss. His fingers were a little rough from swinging the sword frequently—combing Draco's hair while occasionally applying pressure that emphasized his power over Draco. The young prince gasped, and his breathing sped up. It was as if he had been stung by something that made his ripe and inexperienced body turns hot. Even though today the night was quite cold and the wind was blowing hard.
"Prince of Sparta, they will escort you to your room. All your needs will be taken care of by the Nymphs," Alastair informed. Several nymphs, who were almost entirely attractive in their clothes, exposing their bodies, approached Draco.
"You know, I've been in situations like this a lot. Some humans acted as if they were not interested in me. They hoped that I would be curious and chase after them. Unfortunately, I knew their trick and never saw them again. But that doesn't seem to be the case for you."
he hissed to himself. Those bitches are used to living richly, so they sometimes lack manners. Hah! If only they had known that the Harry Potter they glorified was secretly attracted to 'men'.
“Wha—!!" Draco's voice stopped when the man's cold, hard lips suddenly crushed his. Draco rebelled when he realized that Harry was chasing his lips with a hot, wet kiss.
Glenice's heart sank even more. This beautiful, smart, and responsible Draco deserves a husband more than their king. "Uh, if Your Majesty wants, I can bring a book like that to Your Majesty as study material," Glenice offered while trying to smile.
Ginseng, damiana, vanilla, rose petals, and cinnamon. The spice was an Aphrodisiac plant. Eros, the God of Love famous for his arrows, can make anyone fall in love if exposed to it, apparently making his love potion. What he called a love potion was some kind of aphrodisiac. Maybe Eros should add it again with some secret chemical to make it stronger. Draco accidentally learned the truth about God Eros'
"Will you at least try talking to Potter? You have a meeting tomorrow morning with him, right?" Hermione gave Ron a pleading look. There was anxiety in her voice, especially when he remembered how agonized Draco looked when he begged her earlier.
If only normal humans were chasing him, maybe Draco would take them on. But a werewolf whose strength was ten times greater than him? No, thank you. Draco better runs and hide.
It doesn't matter even if their marriage was one-sided, and the Spartans were not too willing to give up their prince. Still, he was already his.
Draco managed to find a gap in the room where he could put his ear to and hear the conversation between Goddess Hera and his husband, though faintly. Draco had missed most of their discussion, but the boy kept trying to listen to the rest of their conversation.
Cedric smiled faintly as his thumb moved to Draco's forehead and gently stroked it so that the traces of the wrinkles disappeared. "My offer will continue to apply. Until whenever I am ready to be your love affair."
Draco could still pick up on Harry's harsh words, but he tried to remain calm and put on his clothes in gentle motions as best he could. He didn't know whether Harry was cursing because he was too slow to wear an item of clothing or because Draco had worn the king's clothes.
"I'm not defending anyone, Your Majesty," Draco stated without the slightest hesitation. "I'm just saying what I think is right. I don't want this endless bickering to destabilize the kingdom." Draco continued with his eyes fixed on Harry as if he wasn't afraid of his husband's piercing gaze.
At this time, Tom should have prayed that he would be caught dead, because if Harry had found him alive… Alden did not dare to imagine how that man would become.
But Harry didn't budge. The man grits his teeth in anger. "I'm not leaving. Your chance is already time out. I was kind enough to give you the opportunity to join the party and wear nice clothes. Now hurry up and put on that dress,” Harry didn't raise his voice at all, but the anger in his voice crept into the air and forced Draco to do what he wanted.
"Then, are you going to let her keep crying like this?!" interrupted Harry in his already rising voice.
Draco was so mesmerized he was almost breathless. He stood for a long time in front of the garden, then frowned when he realized that the right-wing of the house, though clean and well-groomed, appeared to be hardly ever used.
Harry is stunned, but then he chuckles and decides to sit in the chair next to Draco's bed. "I repeat, don't you ever fall for that young doctor, he must be from a conventional family, and I'm sure his moral education and his family will not tolerate you, the person Harry Potter has tarnis—"
"What happened to you?" Draco asked softly and moved his hand to wipe away the traces of tears on Arabelle's adorable face.
Alastair also drew his sword, which looked different than any Draco had ever seen a Spartan soldier wield. The blade had a lightning-like glint, and the metallic color was dissimilar. Alastair swung it. Although they all clearly saw—if the tip of the blade didn't touch their armor in the slightest—about six soldiers within range were mysteriously thrown away.
"I'd better use the cloak," Draco muttered as he reached out his hand to grab Harry's flimsy robe, which was lying helplessly on the ground.
"Her dress is an old dress, last month's design, she must be a poor girl." the voice of another woman with reddish hair in a light blue dress, whispering maliciously, also heated up the atmosphere. "She embarrassed Harry with her appearance."
"Don't moan or make weird sounds like that in front of men!" Harry growled as he stepped away from Draco in annoyance.
Again Cedric ignored the queen’s words. In his training clothes, the brunette stepped out to meet the guards waiting for him with light steps.
Draco had no other choice. He also didn't know what kind of danger could befall him in this era of ancient Greece. Draco was about to ask which warriors would be willing to escort him before a dashing man suddenly came up to the two of them and spoke.
Draco knew the woman in front of him must be feeling scared. She was afraid that her previous question had offended Draco. "As I have said before, I will answer. Lady, there is no need to be so nervous. I am not someone who is easily offended." Draco said, ending with a small laugh.
"Nothing," argued Draco. It was enough for Luna to know that he was a Demigod, and no one else should know. "I've found the girl you want. I'll bring her this weekend. And after this, I won't have any business with you anymore."
"I saw you killing me when I kissed you at that time. The image of an apocalypse, the devil ruling the world. I witnessed all of it," explained Draco with great emotion, then he remembered his mother. "I don't want it all to happen. I don't want to." tears began to pool in his eyes.
Draco was familiar with some of the famous demigod names like Hercules or Perseus. Alastair may be just one of the more unknown minor demigods, or his role isn't significant enough to be worthy of the inclusion of poets in their poetry.
"I will replace that doctor with a female doctor. From this moment, Doctor Jason will not be assigned to treat you again."
Doctor Jason laughed at Draco's futile attempt to escape, then pushed Draco's chair against the wall and pressed the knife against Draco's cheek. "This knife is very sharp," Doctor Jason played the knife against Draco's cheek. "I doubt Potter would still want to make you his whore if your face is damaged." He placed the cold iron on Draco's cheek, causing Draco's eyes to close in fear.
Attica said they weren't always in the same place. They often go on adventures and work for the gods of Olympus. So, it's not strange if they meet a man and get pregnant and give birth. What Lasonas said was just an issue often made fun of by people who didn't know their culture. Attica herself was a follower of Ares and one of his flagship soldiers.
Draco half smiled, then touched Harry's cheek gently. In an instant, Harry's body stiffened as if surprised by the soft touch of Draco's fingers on his cheek.
The Goddess got up and touched her son's shoulder while looking into his eyes through her clear yet wise eyes. "To be a leader, strength and loyalty are needed. It's not a popularity contest but thinks about it. The strongest candidate is probably Athena. You don't want your sister to take the lead, do you? So think about it, Ares. Athena hates you. She won't make your life easy if she is the leader. I'm saying this because I care about you." Hera explained.
Draco widened his eyes. Was Harry still taking the agreement of years ago seriously? But the deal involved a lot of money, which Harry gave to his father and then squandered. Even if Draco rejected Harry, then he owed him a considerable debt.
A second later, both Draco and Arabelle returned to focus on their respective embroidery activities. Arabelle looked so sloppy when embroidered because Draco could hear a small whimper that escaped the girl's lips as the needle pricked her finger.
He couldn't stop thinking about that immortal man. Why does Harry keep following him like a stalker? The problem is that this stalker can be anywhere Draco is, and it's
If Draco felt another feeling for Harry... Draco shook his head, trying to get rid of the feeling that clung to him. With trembling hands, he felt his bandaged arm and sobbed.
Doctor Jason smiled. "I'm just doing my job, but at the same time, I'm happy that my patient is getting better."
"We are husband and wife. Sometimes we have to look harmonious so that there is no bad talk," Ares replied, still in his cold tone.
"If I get hurt, all you have to do is call a healer and keep it a secret from everyone. Easy, right?" Draco replied lightly with a small laugh.
Luna joined in tidying up her books and grabbed the bag that was lying at her feet. "I'll see you this afternoon, Dray…" she said and left the classroom ahead of Draco.
But now Draco was a little doubtful of their happiness. Because there must be times when they were not familiar, or there was boredom. The proof was that Alastair was born a Demigod. His mother must have been a human who had contact with Eros.
Although the King of Sparta had three children, Troya was his only son, whom he loved the most. If people think that the son and prince of a Spartan kingdom will be the leader on the battlefield, that does not apply to Troya. He grew up to be different than most men in general. Hence, the King and Queen of Sparta loved Troya very much because Troya was special.
Vlad tightened his arms tightly around Draco's waist even more. "You're not going anywhere. Your place is here with me."
"All right," Draco took a deep breath and let Alden open the door for him. Draco immediately faced Harry, who stood so handsome in the middle of the room.
"You don't have to worry about Aphrodite. She doesn't even visit Ares palace often. It would be best if you thought more about the inhabitants. Like the Amazon warriors and me and their other knights," Attica whispered to him.
"You can do it. We haven't even started yet. You don't have to worry about anything. Everything will be fine," Cedric reassured.
Draco took a deep breath and opened his eyes to find that an incredibly handsome face was staring at him anxiously, truly concerned, nothing artificial. Is Harry really that worried? But how could that be? Isn't this man a cruel man who destroyed his family and parents?
Suddenly a man's loud voice in front of Draco ordered the group to stop. The voice was none other than Harry's.
Greyson stared at Harry's departure. It couldn't be helped that he was worried about Draco's condition. Greyson has already fallen into Draco's beauty. Maybe next time, they would meet again if fate allowed.
"Anything?" Draco briefly thought about asking her about the Oracle named Cyllenius. Where could Draco find him?
The window was covered with thick glass and was filled with substantial iron trellis. After all, Draco had just realized that he was on the second floor. Even if he could open the window, he had to find a way to safely off the second floor.
Harry glanced at Alden with sharp eyes, then grabbed a towel to rub his wet hair. "I was about to kill him."
"Well, that's better now," Draco smiled with satisfaction when he saw that his scarf had covered the marks.
He wanted to run away from this party and drown again with the popular books among the Delion people that Natalie had given him.
"No! I don't want to! I'll sue all of you!" Draco felt sick. He bent over, clutching his stomach, his diaphragm muscles forcing him to press the contents of his stomach out through his esophagus. But there was nothing he could vomit.
“Get over there quickly. He wants you," The bartender standing behind him whispered to him, as if afraid that if Draco didn't do what Harry wanted, it would be fatal.
Draco turned his head so that his hateful eyes met Harry's cold eyes. "Thank you for releasing me. I hope I don't see you again in the afterlife." Then Draco's body was thrown, floated in the air, and hurtled down into the deep pool.
Not that Draco hoped to be married, the problem was that he was already at Olympus. He can't get out of there and needs someone to protect him, at least until he can protect himself. However, he doesn't know when it could happen because he couldn't even run properly when chased by a wolf.
"It only exists in your dreams!" Draco half screamed, ran to the door, and slammed the door loudly, still hearing Harry's laughter as he left.
Harry felt a little dizziness and pain in his arm this time, which was cut by the car's iron that had rolled three times before crashing into the downhill road. He caressed Draco's head affectionately and quickly kissed the blonde on the forehead before Alden walked into the room.
Alden nodded. "Yes, master. Everything is working smoothly. It's been confirmed that there are no eyewitness accounts of Tom Riddle's loss and no media reports about it."
The Titans and Alastair promised to be his friends on Olympus and guide him in many ways. Unlike the other youths who had been with Ares—Draco would mingle with the rest of his palace. At least Draco could see that as the God of War, Ares wasn't cruel to his followers.
"Luna? Can you hear me?" Draco was starting to get confused because he couldn't hear Luna's voice at all. Just a few murmurs and some strange noise from the other end of the line.
The king of Sparta had made a foolish decision. Defying the messengers of the gods was enough to make Sparta cursed. What's more, that god was Ares. The God of War was notorious for being merciless on the battlefield.
There was a sudden and appalling hush. Harry fell silent, and Draco waited curiously for what the man would say.
Everything went well at first. Harry kept his promise to change into a better man, to take care of him, to make him happy.
"Because Harry Potter, the coldest tycoon here, invites you to stay with him in his house. Despite having many lovers, Potter is known to have a principle of sterilizing his house from the presence of women." Hermione twitched her chin. "And well, who knows if the woman he's carrying isn't a woman," Hermione said teasingly, making Draco blush awkwardly.
Draco looked doubtful for a moment. Then he sat down under a thick leaf olive tree. Eros sat next to him while Alastair just stood guard near them.
The middle-aged man with a wise gaze shed tears of emotion. He wore a robe and leather armor, a sword attached to his iron belt. Draco just stared at him in confusion until a sudden headache hit him.
The young man noticed his reflection in the lake. Troya's physique was indeed very enchanting. Even though he wasn't wearing makeup, his golden blonde hair was also left loose and only combed with his fingers. His skin was flawless white, and his lips were naturally red like ripe apples. His eyes were symmetrical round with curly blonde eyelashes that make his gaze deep as if drowning.
"C'mon, baby boy. Ride me. Ride your Daddy." Harry rasps, breath hitched as he encourages the cute blonde to roll his hips back and forth, hands clutched tight onto Draco's plump butt, leaving fingerprints.
Harry did not stare at him and only stared at the fireplace in front of him. Draco frowned his eyebrows questioningly. What did he see? There was only an empty fireplace, not even a television.
Every time he saw Alden, Draco was punched by a terrible feeling of fright and guilt. Harry threatens to kill anyone off guard and let Draco escape. Is it worth sacrificing one life to escape? He doesn't know Alden, but if he gets freedom at the expense of other people's lives, it still doesn't feel right to him.
Out of the corner of his eyes, he could see the reddish blotches on his husband's chest. Now, Draco couldn't think positively anymore. After reading the highly erotic vulgar novel, Draco could tell that the reddish blotches were from Arabelle.
Daphne glanced at the maid's departure and smiled. "They are new, and of course, very curious about you."
Draco finally got his feet off the bed and walked over to Harry and Cedric, feeling the situation was getting thicker.
Draco grabbed a kitchen knife and opened the door carefully, letting the chain hold it in place. "Who?" He looked at the handsome man in the neat suit while frowning.
Harry fell silent. Alden's words were so tempting. He returned to the room, driven by the intense feeling to see Draco again. Draco was still stretching and groaning on the bed when Harry sat beside him. The young man stared at Harry with his misty silver eyes, as if not recognizing him.
Harry chuckled a little. He had intended to bring Draco back with him, but with Draco's disheveled appearance and Harry's immaculate appearance, there was bound to be some slanted gossip about them.
Ares was a God. No one could go against God's will or question their morality. Moreover, even though Ares was the most hated God, he was still one of the twelve main Gods of Olympus. But now, he came with a lavish gift for the king and formally asked for their son.
Draco had just spun around for a while, but Harry's hands instantly returned to cup Draco's small back. An overwhelming sense of possessiveness made him pull Draco's body so that Draco's head touched his broad chest, which was lined with very soft satin fabric.
Harry began moving in and out at an agonizingly slow pace, so slow that Draco wouldn’t be able to reach orgasm, but the pressure was potent enough to keep him painfully close to the edge.
Seeing Cedric gotten his sword, Draco immediately bowed respectfully to sign that he would battle with a noble. Cedric also did the same. The brunette bowed with one of his hands hidden behind his back.
In contrast to Draco, who seemed normal with the older King's jokes, Harry didn't seem to like the words the King had just said. Evidently, now, Harry's hand, which Draco had gently held, was moving to embrace Draco's slender waist tightly.
While walking, Draco pretended not to see the man. Maybe it would be easier if he acted that way. Just as Draco was about to cross the road, Harry pulled his hand, making Draco's body turned around and bumped into him.
Not long after that, Professor Trelawney walked in with some of her drawing books. Of course, this is not a drawing class, but professor Trelawney really likes to show her works depicting mythological creatures. Draco was always amazed whenever she showed them the drawings as if she had actually met these creatures.
When Harry moved, Draco moaned. All of this was too good to bear. He couldn't reach his consciousness any longer, almost frustrated that his body had finally given up on Harry's whirl of passion. Harry lowered his head, kissed the corner of Draco's lips possessively, declared his possession, and plunged himself deeply.
"Troya... Oh, Troya... Look at your beauty that can compete with Aphrodite, your long silvery blonde hair, and your graceful footsteps. No matter where people look, you are the most beautiful man in Greece. But why is your destiny so unfortunate?" The Queen knelt while crying on the floor.
After tying his long blonde hair, he then took a large plastic box in the corner of the room and then started tidying it one by one, putting all the scattered dolls and toys.
Hector's face turned tense and slightly angry. The young man spoke back to him. Whereas all this time, even though Hector realized the compulsion of his smile—Troya never spoke loudly to him. Because Hector knew that Troya didn't want anyone to hate him.
Harry knew very well that at this moment, the men who were looking at Draco with lustful eyes behind the gazes full of admiration they gave Draco openly. Harry's jaw hardened.
“Oh…Oh my god.” Draco closed his eyes as the pleasure exploded and drowned his body with unbearable heat.
Draco jumped when the voice sounded nearby. Terrified, he turned to find Harry over there, sitting on the sofa not far from the bed and studying Draco.
Of course, the relationship between Ares and Aphrodite was well known in mythology. They were a sinner couple and had an affair based on lust. Ares was said to love the Goddess so much that he repeatedly kills his love rival.
Ginny's screams followed by a groan of pain loomed over his head. Even though it's been a year since the tragedy, but the sensation is as if it happened yesterday. In Harry's memory, it was clearly etched how Ginny's bloodied face with her head leaned against the windshield that shattered pieces had disfigured. Ginny's brown nettle stared at Harry blankly as her life force was slowly being pulled out of her body. And Harry couldn't do anything to save her.
Draco's strolling around and looking for a shelf with a spiritual theme. He has read several books where the main character also hunts down demons, but the main character was a descendant of angels or rather called Nephilim. Did the Nephilim really exist? And Draco is a Demigod. Perhaps others will also wonder whether Demigods really exist? All of that became a question that he wasn't sure how to answer.
Icarus nodded while biting his lower lip. Draco's ear began to hiss again, and now he knew where the sound had come from. It must be the demon Icarus was referring to, but Draco would make sure the demons couldn't touch him. Maybe Draco should find out about how to get rid of demons.
Draco nodded his head. He really enjoyed all of this, not only the food, although the food at Harry's house was no less delicious, but being able to eat with a free landscape — not inside the room, and the room that was always locked — was very nice.
"I saw the wings of angels being cut off and falling on the ground. Thousands of human corpses were covered in blood, and demons were doing destruction." Draco tries not to tell the part where he saw himself being killed by Harry.
Glenice's scream made Draco reflexively follow what Glenice was staring at. Draco's mouth opened slightly wide when he saw Natalie making out with her stepson.
Draco was still wondering, what exactly is behind the door? But never mind, he will try to open it tomorrow, because now he wants to rest his body.
He hasn't seen Harry since he fought with Icarus, neither has Icarus. The two of them haven't appeared since then. Maybe they need some time together and are currently hanging out together. Who knows, right? Like two boys who fight over a toy and then make up again because their favorite game has just been released, and decide to play together. Even though Icarus said he was his guardian angel, Draco still didn't believe him. Could he be around Draco anytime? And did he follow Draco in the bathroom too?
"We're ready to be punished," Attica added, looking so embarrassed and didn't even want to look at the prince.
His eyes suddenly stopped on a doll lying helplessly under the bed, an old doll in Doraemon form, the blue cat robot. With trembling hands, Draco grabbed the tiny doll, looking closely.
"Okay, I'm still confused. Can you tell me about the Titans? Who are you? Why are you different from us?"
All the guests were silent and stared at their king as he rose from his throne. All the guests who were there held their breath, guessing what their king would do.
"You take a quick bath. I'll be sitting there waiting for you." Harry pointed to a large tree some distance away from where they were standing at the moment.
Any normal lover would subconsciously think of touching his hair or stroking his sturdy arm muscles. Draco didn't deny that he might be willing to do something else with him that was more intimate and fun, but he wasn't willing to do it just because they were married.
Draco cursed himself inside, he should have been quicker, or maybe he should have hit Alden on the head with something so that the man fainted and could not call his friends immediately.
"Isn't His Majesty still sick?" asked Arabelle curiously when she saw a shawl draped over Draco's slender neck.
"To Lady's previous question, I also don't know what the answer is. Maybe because she is a sweet innocent girl, I consider her as my little sister. It feels good when I finally have a sister." Draco's light made Natalie's level of admiration for Draco increase even more.
Supported by the cool and serene air, Draco finally fell asleep without noticing the presence of someone who was now standing in a dark corner and watching him with glowing eyes.
"No. I've spoken to my ministers. This may all be a trick of my enemy. Ares may never have been involved in any of this. The Oracle, nor can it be found in any temple." The King of Sparta suddenly turned dense, he was still half-convinced, but hope shone in his eyes.
Draco’s breath came in halted spurts. “Yes — dammit ye—!” He growled before yelping as Harry thrust his massive cock inside in one swift motion. Draco felt his eyes roll back in his head as he slumped against the fullness consuming his arse.
Cedric just grunted and scrunched his face. Really, that guy’s already feeling quite fed up. If only he couldn't find Draco on this dance floor, maybe by now he would have taken out his disgust on his innocent subordinates.
"We were worried that the place might bear a curse on you. That means six snakebites at once. Even snake charmers say it doesn't make sense." She reasoned.
With dignified steps, he walked on the velvet carpet that adorned the entire palace floor. His pace quickened as he suddenly felt his heart quiver a little as he recalled his wife's face.
The large vulture walked towards him, looking at him with its eyes that looked friendly at first. Draco looked around him. He's alone. There were probably several guards watching him from afar, but the bird only focused on him.
"Prince Troya, are you sure you don't want to take a warm bath? We've got some great herbs for muscle soreness," Alastair offered Draco when he was ready and refreshed since morning to explore his husband's palace.
Harry strode hastily up the stairs with an enraged growl, slamming his feet with every step, violently opening the bedroom door. His eyes flared, and he was ready to fight and found Draco sitting on the couch, had changed into his pajamas, also reading a book.
Harry snickered. "Maybe you need to feel for yourself how crazy I am about your body." The man grabbed Draco into his arms gently and immediately smashed their lips.
Draco remained calm. He wasn't surprised at all by the high-pitched words that just came out of his husband's mouth. Draco once read a novel, the novel said that a man would feel his heart squeezed when he saw his loved one suffer, and now, Draco understood Harry's words earlier.
Frantically Draco began to struggle and kick, moving as best he could to escape. But it's useless, Harry's ties to his hands are very strong, and in such a bound state, Draco is entirely helpless.
"There are many kinds of mythological beings, and not all of them are immortal. Why do you always call them immortal, huh?" Luna took the seat opposite Draco.
Draco felt a hot tingle all over his body, and he stretched. There was a sensation creeping from his lips that felt good when someone grounded him. Draco weakly blinked half asleep and opened his eyes.
Alastair raised his right hand, and a vulture was seen flying from behind Ares' group. The bird then landed right in front of Draco. Alastair feeds it a purple strawberry-like fruit. The vulture chewed it in one swallow.
Draco simply replied with the word "Oh," and let Harry walk beside him. People are now paying attention to Draco, not because they think he's crazy or anything, but Draco thinks it's because of Harry. The people staring at Harry were girls who seemed fascinated.
Draco glanced slightly at the mirror, not interested in Daphne's makeup at first, but couldn't help but hold his gaze a little longer. This time he's wearing a black suit. Draco's long blonde hair was lifted in ponytails, showing off his ears. Overall, the appearance looks so elegant and classy. Daphne is excellent at making his appearance change drastically like this.
Still, Draco felt embarrassed. Good grief! For whatever reason, Draco was desperate to run and disappear from this room!
Hyde kept watching until the car drove and disappeared around the corner, then smiled wickedly, now is the time to collect the payment from the pathetic Tom.
"Draco," Harry made his characteristic menacing voice. “Don't challenge me. You know I'm not in the mood to argue with you, I'm in a bad mood, and I'm sick of all your resistance. So don't try to provoke my patience. "
"Is there any problem?" Draco responded fiercely. His shady hazel eyes didn't look as tame as they used to be. His sister was a little nervous. She didn't think that Troya would dare to counter.
"Maybe," the other man shrugged. "My mother grows all kinds of flowers in our house. I even thought that our house looked like a flower garden and deserved to be a museum."
