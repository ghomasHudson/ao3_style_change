"You told your house-elf about the baby?" Harry asked a little stunned. Dobby had a sister, imagine that!
"Harry, we all know how difficult it's been for you. Since you broke up with Ginny, you've dated I don't know how many witches over the years, and it never seems to click. Now you know you've looked for love in the wrong place all the time."
Draco straightened up. "Why not?" he asked with his haughtiest tone. "It's the adequate way of adressing one another."
Heavenly. Malfoy's lips were on his cock and it was heavenly. He licked and sucked and Harry pushed in, fucking his delicious mouth.
Potter inhaled sharply at the sight of it. "Can we ever get through our past, d'you think?" he asked incredibly low, almost in a whisper.
"I'm sorry I woke her up," he said and patted his god-daughter on her soft red hair. "If Malfoy hadn't insisted, I would have gone home. I feel fine, you know."
Hermione watched the turmoil evident in his face. "Is there something you want to tell me?" She fixed her eyes on his. "You have to fix this. This isn't fair towards Ginny, and possibly not to this other person either. You must decide what you want, Harry, and make a choice." She picked up her quill and looked down at her books again. " Now leave, I have a pile of work and need to study."
"All right then," Hermione said with an eyeroll. "I'll start at the beginning. It's quite a story, you know. The Greek wizard Socrates was a great humanitarian and philosopher in Athens more than two thousand years ago. He saw great suffering among his fellow man and thought about a way to ease the pain in people's life. Since he himself had been forced into a loveless marriage, he got the belief, that if everybody had True love in their life, a Soulmate just right for them, to help with the daily struggle, life would be more pleaseant and people would be happier.
That made Harry's rage boil, and with eyes flashing with anger, he pushed him even harder against the wall. "Watch it, Ferret, are you calling me fat?" It was true, in a way. Harry had filled out these last six months and his shoulders had broadened. He wasn't the scrawny nimble boy anymore, but it was all muscles.
They ate in front of the fire, sitting in Harry's soft Gryffindor-red chairs, with a pot of tea under a heating charm on the small table beside them.
Harry surveyed his fellow students. They've been through so much and now they were interacting as the war never happened. He could see Hermione on the otherside of the room talking to Millicent Bulstrode, of all people. It made him feel a bit uneasy.
"No, we'll go shopping. Don't look so surprised. If I'm to be seen with you in public, you need to look better than this."
He was the last to speak. Headmistress McGonagall had been the first, then Minister Shacklebolt and now it was Harry's turn. He had hardly listened to any of them. He hated doing this, and every year he felt unable to say no. He looked up and met the eyes of his friends, Ron's and Hermione's on the front row with Rose and Hugo in their laps. Hermione's eyes were filled  with tears. At their side the whole Weasley clan, Molly with her face buried in a bright blue handkerchief, Arthur with his arm around her. Beside them George, with a look on his face as if it could have been carved in stone. Harry's eyes wandered, searched, and eventually found him. A reassuring grey gaze met his, from further back at the side, and he nodded slightly.
"You're beautiful." Potter threaded his fingers through the silky strands on the pillow. Draco's cheeks flushed bright red and he hid his face in the pillow.
I made an effort to calm my rapidly beating heart and tried to be cautious where I treaded. This was treacherous waters I was out on. This was, after all, Draco Malfoy, not so long ago my opposite in all things, someone I'd fought with, duelled with, rivalled with in absolutely everything. For as long as I've been at Hogwarts, he's been constantly on my mind, one way or another. I didn't know until now that this was what I wanted.
"I actually live right across the street." He turned to the window and pointed at a narrow house on the dimly lit street outside. "See that blue-grey door over there." Malfoy looked and gave a short laugh. "Well, you didn't lie when you said you lived close."
Draco reached out and started to pull at the hem of the garment. He needed to see, with his own eyes, without any layers of clothes in between. Potter picked up at what he wanted and yanked the jumper over his head and threw it on the floor. Then with some hesitation he zipped down his jeans and opened the flaps.
Harry swallowed and lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper. "Is that what you call it, civilized? Whatever it was you did to me last we met?"
The smile died on the Healer's lips. "Absolutley. We cannot afford to take any chances there. The blood status of the donor is of the utmost importance, as is your relation with the man. In the rare cases of wizard-pregnacies there can never be any random anonymous donor, it just doesn't work that way. Don't ask me why," he put his hands defensively in the air, "research hasn't come that far yet. You must know the donor, and as soon as you've inseminated yourself with his sperm, you'll concieve, and at that moment your magic is drawn to the embryo, and this is the tricky part, for the creation of the temporary womb. The child will later have to be delivered with a caesarean, of course, but during the pregnancy your body will react as normal as any woman carrying a child; nausea, food cravings, the risk for high blood-pressure and a lot of other things that we will deal with as they come. You will know the very moment a womb has been successfully created, since your magic will be unobtainable for you from that time."
Molly beamed at him and shook her greying red locks. "It's a pleasure, dear. Happy birthday. And you should call me Molly."
There was a noice and they heard padding of feet. "Don't worry," Potter said, "it's only Seamus, he always wakes early to take a leak."
"What do you mean, this is your resignation?" Head-Auror Robards face turned a very unbecoming shade of red.
Harry gulped down the whiskey in one go and choked as it burnt his throat. He wasn't used to drink in that way, he secretly preferred the Butterbeer of his youth. Malfoy snickered into his own tumbler.
Blaise Zabini almost fell off his chair with laughter, totally ignoring the stares from the other students. He lowered his voice again. "Oh, Draco," he whispered and wiped his tears while convulsing with mirth, "you
Harry blushed even deeper as he shook his head. "I don't know anything about you really, except what happened at Hogwarts and that you're now a semi-Muggle solicitor." And as Harry still was a Gryffindor at heart, he added, "Care to fill in the blanks?"
Blaise knew the pretence of a friendly evening was lost the moment Draco's fist touched Potter's chin.
"I want to get rid of it," she said. "I want to play Quidditch, not let another baby suck the life out of me one more time."
"It's the right thing to do, and she's so devoted to me. It seems my presence calms her, and the concistency of a home will do her good. Duncan's perfect company for Lily, they're the same age. It'll be fine." Harry grinned.
Harry sat and studied him silently. He looked different today, in Muggle clothes, a dark blue jumper and grey slacks. His shoulder-long hair that yesterday had been in a very strict ponytail, slicked from his face, was now in a messy bun with strands of pale blond hair hanging at the sides, and his face was sort of un-masked.
Pansy sat on the floor beside Malfoy's chair with her legs crossed, idly flipping the pages of a copy of Witch-Weekly. Neville couldn't take his eyes from her.
Draco felt the ice have effect, the blood wasn't gushing down anymore. He tried to sit up, suddenly aware of the crowd around the four-poster, and the fact that he was naked, and in the wrong dorm.
to forget. And I thought it was the same for you, Harry, but apparently you're too blinded by his fabulous
"I liked the kiss,though," Draco said with a yawn and nuzzled his face into Harry's shoulder and placed his arm over Harry's midriff. "I'd like to have more of that."
They shrunk all of Harry's bags while in the cab and put them in his pockets before they stepped out in front of a small bar. Because it was a bar or a nightclub, not a pub like Harry was used to. Malfoy was recognized and greeted at the door and by the barman. He placed Harry in a small booth and went over to buy drinks. He returned and put two glasses on the table. "I figured you for a beer man, was I right?"
Blaise glanced at the door as he steered the group over to the makeshift bar. A horde of Hufflepuffs this time, eight or ten of them, laughing and chatting, arms slung over each other's shoulders. They were clearly in the mood to have some fun.
"No reason not to enjoy oneself while at it." Malfoy smiled. A genuine bloody smile, and he winked at Harry.
Harry held Draco's gaze over the rim of his glass. "Pity you never beat me to it, then," he smirked and had the satisfaction of seeing Draco's ears turn pink.
Over the bustle in the room a voice suddenly carried. "Just put the damned shirt on, Draco. We all know you're bent, anyway."
Malfoy sat back on his heels and wiped his mouth, where some of Harry's cum had escaped, with an elegantly outstretched pinkie. "Mm, that was delicious," he smirked. "The Chosen Sperm!"
to, Harry." Hermione's voice became concerned, and if I may, a little patronizing. "No one is forcing you to reveal anything you're not ready for." Some friend, huh? Must she always know absolutely everything?
Harry looked at his newly purchased mobile in disbelief after disconnecting the call. What a strange place to suggest for a meeting, from Malfoy, anyway. "See you at the stairs of British Museum, Friday afternoon. Shall we say four?" was what Malfoy had said.
Harry blushed. Of all sodding questions. Malfoy must have read it in the papers. Harry had tried to stop them writing about it when he left, he wasn't at all happy that it got so much publicity, but he had promised to go with the truth. "I guess it wasn't as heroic as I thought it would be when I was younger."
"Harry, I'm twenty-two. Life is supposed to be fun, we're supposed to have fun. Merlin knows, we deserve it after all we went through. But you work
Harry shrugged. "Dunno. Can't get a fire starting in any of them, it seems." He held up two teabags. "Indian or Chinese?"
Malfoy?" Ron exclaimed and Rose started to cry. Hermione lifted her up and hummed an out-of-key tune as she rocked her on the hip. "This got to be good, Harry," she said. "Let me just put this one back to sleep, and then I demand to hear the whole story. Don't you dare start telling it before I come back."
Harry drew his fingers through the long blond hair at Draco's neck. He hadn't put it up in its usual ponytail yet and it fell lose over his shoulders. "I keep telling everybody that the war was a long time ago and that it's time for us all to move on. Let me get a chance to prove that to myself. Take me with you and show me what the old place looks like these days."
When did he learn to dance like that? To move and sway that way to the music. Four years ago, at the Yule ball, Draco was quite content with Potter making a fool of himself, stumbling around the dancefloor, as Draco and the other Slytherins mocked and cracked with laughter. But now, he moved with confidence and grace, just like he moved on a broom, not that he had noticed, of course. He swirled around with almost everyone at the party. He danced with Granger, Loony-Luna and all the girls in the room, including Pansy, the traitor. Hell, he even danced withe the Weasel, with a lot of awkwardness and laughter. The sight of that had made him rather nauseous, seeing him wrap one arm around the redhead boy's waist. Right now, he was dancing with the She-Weasel again, and as he raised his arms in the air, the shirt rode up and revealed a string of dark hair, that trailed down from the navel on a surprisingly fit stomach.
"I'm not sure," she bit her lip, "but I think we've got some serious damage-control to take care of in your dorm."
shirt. But it was a dusty kind of pink, that made his eyes shine and his complexion glow, and Harry thought he looked absolutely gorgeous.
His cock was long and immediately slammed into the back of Draco's throat and made him gag, but Draco forced himself to stay calm and not retch, and soon enough he found a pace at how to bob his head up and down Potter's shaft, hollow his cheeks on his way up and breathe through his nose.
Malfoy sat in the leather recliner, dressed in a pair of well-worn Muggle jeans and an over-sized shirt made of some flimsy silky material. It was open at the neck and showed a lot of that pearly white skin. A glass of red wine stood on the table beside him. The house-elf that had showed Harry in bowed and disappeared with a pop.
"Do sit down, Potter," he gestured to the gobsmacked Auror. "We got loads of work ahead of us, so be prepared for a long day."
Ron rolled his eyes and Ginny huffd a dry laugh. "Yeah, that used to drive me insane too, you know, Harry. Your total inability to say what you actually think or feel. I bet Malfoy's biting his nails bloody right now, wondering what it all means, what you want."
Harry hated these Ministry functions and this Halloween fundraising party was no exception. He found them boring first and foremost, and seeing people showing off their wealth and sucking up to those in a higher position, the Head-Auror included, got on his nerves.
Malfoy tilted his head and his gaze pierced Harry. "Yeah," he said dawdlingly, "but we do that pretty well, I believe." He leaned closer to Harry. "The duels we've had, rather spectacular, don't you think? And the bare-knuckle fights were quite satisfactory too."
"Of course, you will," Harry chuckled. A great relief spread its warmth in his chest. "Changing diapers is very important for creating a bond with your child. It's intimate and a time where it's only you and the baby that matters."
She turned and watched him carefully. "How are you, Harry? Ron told me that you might be pregnant again."
Harry woke, but for some reason he kept his eyes closed. Was this another wet dream? He waswarm and sweaty, and achingly hard.
He got up and went to the loo and then he pulled on his old joggers before he padded into the kitchen. He filled the kettle with water for a pot of tea and was just about to pull out his wand to heat it, as he used to do. With a small laugh he put the kettle on the cooker and turned the nob. Things were going to be different from now on. Really, really different.
When he'd payed and had his purchase handed over to him in a paperbag, Malfoy was again right behind him.
The list was long and as always there were certain names that stood out to Harry, as if written in letters of fire. He carefully folded the parchment and put it back in his pocket.
"Ages ago, end of September, I think." Weasley turned to the girl for confirmation. Granger nodded and chewed on her lip. "Surely that can't still be in his system?" she asked. "I mean, it's been more than two months since that happened. And it wasn't funny at all," she spat at Weasley, who still grunted a laugh.
"Oh, my dear boy," Molly said, and once again Harry found himself almost suffocating in her embrace. The prickling and stabbing behind his eyes became worse. He tried to hold it back, but the sob came anyway and then another one. Molly patted him on the back of his head and rocked him as they sat. "Hush, hush, my sweet," she murmured. "It's going to be all right, it's all going to be all right."
"It's not hasty. I've thought about it for years. This job was never what I once thought it would be." Harry sighed and rested against the chair. He was starting to feel heavy now and his back hurt. "I'll be off on parental leave soon anyway, and let's face it, I'm more of a burden for the Department right now as it is."
Draco remembered visiting old relatives there with his mother. The bleak house with its dark walls had scared him and he recalled being whiny and petualant the whole time, and his mother had been very cross with his bad behaviour.
"Ron, have you ever felt you were attracted to another bloke?" Harry tried to make the question sound casual and indifferent, but the way his friend snapped his head around at him, showed he wasn't that easily fooled.
Harry stepped into the dark room and threw off his Invisibility Cloak. At once, someone grabbed his forearm and an elbow hooked around his throat from behind. "Couldn't keep away, now could you, Scarhead?" Malfoy's ragged breath tickled his neck. Harry pushed his back closer to the boy behind him. He could feel Malfoy's cock twitch, and he grinded his buttocks against it. "You seem pretty eager yourself, Ferret-face."
"I guess that's not that surpising, since it's only a few of the old families that arrange marriages nowadays. Unlike the Potters and the Weasleys, who marry the Muggle way."
It was over, Malfoy was safe. Two Aurors walked up to him and loosened the manacles with their wands, then they did the same with his mother. Another group of Aurors came in, grabbed Lucius Malfoy and pulled him up from his chair. They were in dark-red robes, the colour of the guards at Azkaban.
Harry shrugged. "It's Friday, and as it happens, I have nothing planned for the evening. I have Muggle money and I could use a pint. There's a perfectly decent pub a few blocks from here."
"And what more," she said with a malicious grin. "You covet him. I can tell. You have the same eyes as that treacherous eldest off-spring of mine, the eyes of a deviant, the eyes of a WHORE." Her shrill laugh echoed through the house.
He attacked Harry's lips and neck with a fever he'd never known he had in him. He completely lost control. He latched on to Harry's mouth and pressed him down with the weight of his body, grinding the bulge in his trousers against Harry's, his hands fluttering everywhere over Harry's body. Draco could hear himself moan and whimper as he finally got to devour, to taste, to...
Harry's mouth went completely dry and he rubbed the back of his neck. He felt sheepish and awkward and hot all over.
"Merry Christmas to you too, Ginny," Harry stalled. But she wasn't that easy to divert. She opened the magazine at the centre and put it on the table for everyone to see. There were a number of photographs of what the paper described as '
He didn't turn his head when he said. "Sometimes I miss the dungeons and the strange green light that came from the water-covered windows in our old dorm. Don't you?"
He quirked his shoulder in one elegant move. "Something to do, I guess. Couldn't bear being cooped up at the Manor anymore. I asked André, who runs this place, if I could play one night, and it got to be a regular thing." His grey eyes held mine. "Never thought I'd be found out in a place like this, though."
It was the third Friday since they first did this, and Harry had not yet shown any signs of being pregnant. Three nights of shagging, and Harry hadn't seen Malfoy naked or touched him, their lips never met, and he never stayed. Not that Harry was
With a facial expression contorted with pain and rage, Malfoy took off back into the crowd on the dancefloor and Harry watched him disappear.
Malfoy tensed up and jutted out his pointy chin. "Why this morbid curiosity of my love-life, Potter?"
"No." Potter stood too and put his hand on Draco's arm. "Don't leave. I've made a steak-pie. I was… surprised, that's all. I thought all that rubbish only was meant to insult you."
Potter coughed and continued raspily. "You know, I have a house with a fireplace. Several, actually. It's a big house. My Godfather left it to me, on Grimmauld Place."
He went inside the house and up to the nursery with Scorpius resting his head against Draco's shoulder, and sat down in the old rocking-chair that had been brought over from the Manor, and closed his eyes, listening to the sounds from the garden and the light breaths of his sleeping son.
"You might think this is a bit presumptuous, but I've actually prepared something for the two of us at my place." His cheeks had just the slightest touch of pink. "Would you like to come?"
"That was taken right before we moved back. We've been living in the south of France with my mother for the most part until now, but I wanted him to attend Hogwarts, like all Malfoy men before him." He looked at Harry and winked. "Go to Hogwarts, sort Slytherin, marry a pureblood witch, have a son. That's what we do, we Malfoys."
Malfoy put a hand over his to stop him. "Not so fast. This is a delicate play. Tonight, we will focus only on you. Tonight, I will teach you about pleasure, Harry."
spend a lot of time here, he realized. The toddler at Ron's knee squirmed and sulked. Harry felt bad for arriving so late and wake everybody up. But he had promised Malfoy.
"Fine! It's not as if I want your degenerated inbred sperm, anyway," Harry shouted, red in the face and something burning behind his eyes. Then he Apparated home on the spot.
Harry swallowed. He hated being recognized and noticed as the famous one. He wasn't the only one who faught the bloody war, for Merlin's sake.
"I couldn't possibly go to a place like that alone. I wouldn't know what to do." Malfoy shook his head and strands of his blond hair fell in front of his face.
Potter continued with his wet socks and trousers, until Draco was left in his white T-shirt and pants. Potter lifted the duvet. "Would you like to lay down?"
"He's not the same anymore," Harry said. "He's changed. I think he really regrets all he's done." Was he fooling himself when he hoped to make them see what he had glimpsed of this new Malfoy? What if he really was fooling himself?
Potter hesitated a little, but then he slowly came closer and loosened Draco's arms from their grip around the knees. He pulled the ice-cold robe off his shoulders, then he continued pulling Draco's jumper over his head. He said nothing but let his fingers trail through the blond hair, that fell in limp tangles. Draco knew he must look a complete mess and shuddered, but whimpered slightly when he felt the warm hand against his face.
"No, not anymore." Cho laughed softly. "I can't sit on a broom right now, not with this little one on the way." She affectionally stroked her prominent baby pout.
"Now, first things first," Harry heard Malfoy say and the matrass dipped beside him. "I want you to pick a safe-word." Harry could feel a hand resting on one of his thighs. "I want you to submit to me, but only out of your own free will, so if there's something you don't want, or I go too fast and you want me to stop, you say the word. Understand?"
Malfoy sat up straight and put his glass down. "Well, let's see, I'm a vegetarian. I own a Muggle mobile phone, to which you have the number, by the way, if you still have that business-card. And I officially live at the Manor, but I have a London flat close to my new office." His eyes dug deep into Harry's. "Unfortunately, I already slipped the gay thing. Your turn."
"And what could possibly have changed if you'd known? Wait, I can just see us, walking into the Great Hall at Hogwarts, holding hands. There was a war going on, Potter!"
"No, no, he's back," Hermione said and helped Rose climb onboard. "He's moved back at the Malfoy Manor again. I think he's got some position at Gringotts." She jerked Harry's arm. "Harry, wake up. I think your son is trying to tell you something."
"Yes, do." A man with thick wavy grey hair stood and offered Malfoy his chair. "We get all sorts of questions about Hip-Hop artists, blogging and Sci-fi films and could really do with some help."
Harry was stunned by surprise, but nodded none the less. "I don't have much time, though. I promised Molly I'll be back to pick up the kids in good time for her to make dinner."
"I guess the hormones in Harry are running amok right know," came Molly's voice. "I don't envy him that. I remember how awful it was, all six times." She tittered a little. "Crying and screaming, falling apart over the silliest things."
"Honestly, Ron," Hermione said, and Harry knew she would make them choose something sensible in the end, something Harry too could participate in. They knew he couldn't ski and the last time he'd tried flying was two months ago and then he nearly fell off because his balance was all wrong, and his belly had grown since then. A lot.
Harry gave a slight chuckle and rubbed the back of his head while he gave Draco a furtive look. "As it happens, I think I like him too."
Malfoy swallowed audibly. "His hair is a lost cause, I'm afraid. I will spare Raul the possibility of a nervous breakdown. We'll just have to leave it as it is for now."
"So, you're sitting here, in my favourite restaurant, eating seafood now?" He remained on his feet and gave Malfoy a stern glance.
"Easy, you just put it on and then it reveals your sexuality on the chest," Zabini explained. "It's a similar Charm as the one on the Sorting Hat, really. Look." He pulled on the t-shirt and letters forming the word
Harry gasped as Malfoy's hand slowly wandered lower from his waist and then, with something that was somewhere between a whimper and a sigh, he murmured, "Oh, Harry."
When it was only the two of them left in the room, Harry wiped his clammy hands on the front of his thighs and got up of his seat. "Malfoy," he said, "could I have a word?"
Draco couldn't even fathom what it would mean. He looked down at Potter's abdomen. He had a knitted old jumper on and it strained a little over his body. There was a slight swell there at the middle, the small beginning of a belly.
Harry was rambling, and it wasn't really a question. Draco closed his eyes and tried to find a smearing remark, fast and devastating, but the bloody eggnog made his sharp mind blurred. Completely horrified, he heard himself whisper, "Yes, please."
"I don't know how to begin to tell you how disappointed I am of the two of you," she said and tied the sash tighter on her tartan dressing gown. "As figures of leadership in your respective Houses," she held up her hand to stop Harry from protesting, "well, you are, there's no point in arguing that. I thought what happened last year should put a stop to all this rivalry nonsense between you, that you finally could act your age and put all that behind you. You're adult wizards now, even if you're still at school. You have the responsibility and the ability to make a difference. Your experiences in the war must have shown you how far animosity can get, and I'm not talking about losing House-points." She paused and somehow seemed to deflate as she exhaled.
Harry rubbed his face and tried to sort out his thoughts and feelings. "Look, Malfoy," he began, "I appreciate what you're trying to do here, and it makes me feel like a total dick, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry i didn't tell you the whole truth. I didn't mean to deceive you, not from the start."
Harry moved fast and silently slipped into the empty seat next to Malfoy. "What are you doing, Potter?" Malfoy hissed between his teeth.
Pansy shot a quick glance at the boy who had fetched her. Longbottom had, very red in the face, walked up to her where she sat in the nook in the wall, where the last rays of the setting sun could reach, her favourite place. How he'd found her there was a mystery. It was her secret place, where she went when she wanted to be alone, to think. Longbottom had mumbled and stuttered something about preventing some sort of chaos, and would she, please, help him and Weasley.
Harry froze mid-air over the bed. Shit! How could he forget something like that? Malfoy saw his flabbergasted face and grinned, "Luckily for you, one of us thinks." He took up a small jar from his pocket and placed it on the bedside table.
Harry's mouth was dry and he clenched his hands into fists in his lap when they brought in the accused, three of them. Thankfully, there were no Dementors this time, they were instead accompanied by four Aurors in scarlet uniform-robes, to the middle of the room, where three chairs stood. Three pale slim figures, all blond; father, mother and son.
I've seriously been thinking there was something wrong with me, something damaged since childhood. That I never could have an emotional connection with another person."
Malfoy entered the room with two cups floating in front of him. He had discarded his black formal robes and had put on a soft blue jumper instead. It did something to his eyes, made them pop out like stars.
Ron streched out his hand over Hermione's waist and patted Harry on the arm. "Right, Harry, it's only a couple of days, then we can forget all about this mess. We'll go to the pub afterwards and get properly pissed, what do you say?"
"Harry, are you all right?" Hermione fell on her knees at Harry's side, Ron stood, looking bewildered at him.
The door to the ward opened and someone turned the harsh light on. It was blinding and Draco screwed his eyes shut and swore.
"There's no need to tear the place down." Malfoy sipped from his cup; a little smile twitched at the corner of his mouth. "I'm only trying to give you what you secretly want."
He cleared his throat, as he didn't rely on it to hold. "Is there any particular reason you're telling me this
"Thank the Gods, you've managed to clean up a bit, Potter." Malfoy leaned closer to him and pretended to kiss his cheek in some posh continental mannerism.
"Do you have to leave? It's Saturday," Harry whined as Draco got out of bed and let a cold whiff in under the duvet.
"That's not enough. If mother had been sent to Azkaban together with my father, it would have killed her instantly. Thank you, Harry."
When he left the Burrow yesterday, Ron had forced Pigwidgeon into his hands and muttered something about Harry might want to contact someone. He had wiggled his eyebrows in the most exaggerated way, so Harry just shoved the little bird into his coat-pocked and rolled his eyes at his friend, before he Apparated home.
"I'll make some tea," Harry said and hurried downstairs to the kitchen. It too was dark and with no fire in the hearth Harry heated two cups of water with his wand and placed them on the table together with a plate of Molly's gingersnaps.
Susan Bones did her best to make him move to the music, but Harry could only stare at her as he held her hands.
Draco stilled. He had not anticipated this. He felt his blood pumping violently in his chest. "Are you sure?" he had to ask. When Potter came to him that time, he'd been all loose and wet, more than ready for Draco to plough into. Draco had thought he'd prepared himself, but now he knew it must have been the potion. "I thought last time was a mistake, a joke. That the potion accident..."
"It's too late, Potter," he said softly. "This can never happen. It was a possibility, when it was only a one-time thing, but we both know it's not, not anymore. And I can't get a divorce."
"Is there anything Kreacher can do for Master and young Master Malfoy, sir?" the elf asked eagerly, still at Harry's elbow.
Harry looked down on his well-worn favourite hoodie. He could have made an effort today, he supposed. And shaved.
"Easy there, Potter," Malfoy snickered and pulled Harry's pants down and the throbbing cock sprang free. Harry tilted his head back and screwed his eyes shut. The sound of the film in the background sped up its pace, as Malfoy's lips descended on him. He licked a stripe on the side of the shaft before he took him in and sucked.
"No," Potter moaned, "this is so much better." His mouth was on Draco's again, hot, wet and demanding. It was messy and glorious.
Malfoy pulled out a chair and sat down with a sigh. "The tea's fine. I'll have the Earl Grey, thank you. I meant the hearths. There must be house-elves in this kind of house?"
"You won't be able to work from the moment the baby is concieved. And being such a public figure as you are, you'll have no protection."
"Salazar's mouldy pants..." Draco sputtered from the reclining chair he was sitting in, spilling what Harry imagined was whiskey on his black trousers. "What the fuck are you doing here, Potter?"
"That's what you think." Draco tried to sound haughty, but he was a little out of breath. Harry nipped at his lip again and darted out his tongue to lick inside of it.
"There are farmhands, tenants and millworkers," Draco informed. "There are crops to oversee, livestock to attend; sheep, pigs and cows."
"The first time I came here, was merely by chance." He spoke softly, careful not to make his voice echo around in the dome with all the other noises. "It was right after the tials against my mother and me, and as I was able to move freely again, I began walking around in London. Randomly, for hours." He gave Harry a sideway glance as he guided him into one of the archways on the left. "It was raining quite heavily that day and I wanted to dry up and get warm, so I went in." Harry couldn't help wondering what had kept him from casting some simple spells to get warm, even if it had been among Muggles.
He slid down on the floor and banged his head back against the wall and closed his eyes. What a complete idiot he'd been. Of course, Malfoy wasn't his soulmate. Still, Harry couldn't escape the feeling that it had made sense, somehow, that there had been a connection. Something that had drawn them together from the very beginning.
He streched out as he lay on the worn-out sofa and waited. He'd been there for a while now. He'd sat there and waited until all his fellow Gryffindors had finally gone up to bed. It was very late and still he hadn't come.
"Yes, it's a lovely house, but there will be others, in due time. But not now. We're hardly at home, any of us, as it is."
"You go there with Ron and the rest of the Aurors, and you talk shop all the time. Sometimes Hermione comes too, or Luna, but most of the evenings I just sit there and watch." She got closer and drew her fingers through his hair. Her face was sad and serious. "I know you have difficulties, and I thought it would get better with time, that we'd become closer, but we're not. You're pushing me away every time I try, and I don't know if I can live like this much longer."
"Let's continue our little game," he said as Harry returned with the drinks. "I've looked around this place and I think we have plenty of time before the real action begins, and I can easily come up with a few more things I want to ask you."
Harry sighed. "It's no use. I never took my N.E.W.T.s. Hermione was right, of course. She tried to persuade Ron and I to go back with her for our last year, but the feeling of finally being free was so overwhelming, and everyone was hurling opportunities at me wherever I went, and I thought being an Auror was the best thing there was, the coolest thing. To fight like my dad and Sirius and Tonks."
"Excuse me for not fully understanding the situation," Charlie butted in. "But what, exactly, has Harry done here that's wrong?" A room full of people turned their heads to him. Harry started shaking.
"Don't look so sceptical, Harry," Hermione giggled. "It's just for a bit of fun. It's not like it's a Love-potion or anything."
Malfoy brought Harry to a bathroom. He filled the tub with perfectly degreed water with a flick of his wand. Then he poured into it something from a small glass bottle. Its spicy scents filled the moist air.
Draco watched the dark-haired man move slowly along the stack of books. Something about that familiar figure was different, but it still sent the same ripple of want through him, the same as it had all those years ago. It was something Draco had long ago made his peace with, accepted as a fact of life, just as sure as the faces of the moon or as the sun raising in the East. Draco loved Harry Potter and had done so since he could remember.
"It's been fifteen years since you and Mum got divorced, and since you left the Aurors you hardly ever leave the house. You've got to go out once in a while, Dad." There was a sad streak in Al's voice. Had it really been that long since he and Ginny split up?
"No, I'm fine," Harry said. Apart from the bump in the back of his head he couldn't feel anything out of the ordinary anymore. "It was probably just a little fatigue." He actually felt embarrassed now. "All I need is a good night's sleep."
Draco gingerly got to his feet. So far, he had counted 7 tripping hexes, 4 stinging hexes, 1 toenail-growing hex (rather imaginative, that one), 1 vomiting jinx and 3 Howlers. Nothing lethal so far, but it had only been a week since he stepped off the Hogwarts Express. He didn't keep record of the taunts and the hissed threats.
Hermione sighed. "Does any of you have any recollection of studying the ancient Greek wizard Socrates?"
I reached out and took his hand. He flinched but let his stay in mine. His hand felt warm, strong and a little callused from Quidditch.
"Well, I certainly didn't ask for it." Now it was Draco's turn to yell. "I prepared myself for WEEKS to take my punishment with as much dignity as I was able, and then you swept in and charmed the whole Wizengamot, with your smile and your sparkling eyes and your words of innocence, when you knew VERY WELL that I wasn't innocent AT ALL!" He drew a steadying breath. "Why did you do that?"
"He kissed me," Harry said, now completely red, and he almost buried his face in a carton of rice. "And he told me he's been in love with me for years."
"The address on the card isn't valid anymore," she said. "But I wrote the new one down at the back."
"Well, isn't it just my lucky day?" The young blond man wiped his hand under his nose and raised his pointy chin defiantly and snarled, "Of all the wizards in the bloody world, Harry Potter just happens to pass by."
Malfoy pressed passed him with a huff and flung open the door on the other side of the corridor. "And this is your bedroom?"
"They're all asleep up there, but I suppose I can count on you, keeping it quiet?" Harry's voice was hoarse and his breath hitched.
Harry had no idea that it had left such a scar. He gazed into Malfoy's eyes. "That's mine," he stated, as he trailed it with his fingers. He could see Malfoy clench his teeth and his body tensed. Harry leaned forward and placed a kiss on the ragged line close to Malfoy's nipple. Then he placed another one and another one, and then he licked it. He licked and kissed the scar all the way from the shoulder to the hip. Malfoy's breath hitched and Harry felt the shivers in his body. Harry licked his hipbone and let his tongue slide over his abdomen and lingered a while in the blond hair that trailed down from his navel, as he got down on his knees. The scent from the groin and the pre-cum was intoxicating. Harry drew a deep breath and inhaled it, as he opened Malfoy's trousers and pulled them down. He heard Malfoy moan and yelp as his erect cock sprang free.
So, it was with his consent? It hurt a little, but yes, he was certainly enjoying it. With whom, though? And how had this happened?
Harry stifled a snarky remark by sipping on his too hot tea, desperately searching his brains for another topic. "I met Draco Malfoy," he blurted out, and mentally slapped himself. Of all the things he could have said to Zabini, why, in Merlin's name, did he say that.
Harry grinned and tilted his head. "You're such a prick, you know that. So, what do you want me to call you when people ask, huh? Special friend, significant other, fiancé… husband?"
That's when Ginny rushed in with the latest issue of Witch Weekly clutched in her hand. She waved it in front of Harry. "What the fuck is going on here, Harry?" she demanded to know.
"So, what's wrong with your fireplace?" Malfoy had followed Harry down and stood leaning against the doorpost, all long legs and elegant robes.
For some reason the last part of a story is always the most difficult to write, but here it is, as it turned out, some of it according to plan, some not. Thank you for reading, commenting and cheering me on. You are all truly the best.❤❤❤
Harry gathered his courage and got up. He took a tentative step closer to Malfoy, who had his face turned away and his eyes shut. Harry could clearly see the long pale eyelashes that fanned out over his cheekbones. "I couldn't believe my eyes when you walked in through that door tonight," Malfoy said, "and for one moment I was stupid enough to think this was real, that you were the one good thing that'd happened to me in years. Well, boo-hoo me." He snorted.
"Not tonight." Harry shook his head with the energi of a shaggy dog. "Tonight I just want to get un-heroically and properly pissed, that's all."
With a very undignified whimper, Malfoy took a firm grip in Harry's hair and pulled him closer for a proper kiss. Malfoy's lips were hot like fire against his own, and when he parted them slightly, Malfoy prodded his tongue in. Harry felt like he was soaring and falling at the same time, and he latched on with all his might. He carded his fingers into the silky blond hair and tugged him closer, devouring deeply, grinding his hips against Malfoy's crotch, until he had to break free and gasp for air. Harry buried his face in the crook of his neck, trying to even out his rapid panting.
Potter shook his head vigorously. "Me? Never. You gave me some Dreamless Sleep after... you know, and I've had some more prescriptions during the summer, but nothing since then."
"Well, you smacked it very hard into my desk, I'm afraid." Malfoy surveyed him. "Have you had attacks like this before?"
Meeting Dudley after all those years had felt strange, but Harry couldn't bring himself to muster up any hostility towards the man. Uncle Vernon had died, and Aunt Petunia wanted to move into something more manageble closer to Dudley. Harry had retieved all the things he'd left behind when he left on his seventeenth birthday, and once again said goodbye to his childhood. He and Dudley had shaken hands when they parted, and that was that.
Draco returned with two steaming mugs floating behind him and crawled back in bed. Harry inhaled the sweet savoury flavour when one was handed to him.
"Potter," Malfoy hissed out of ear-shot of Adam, "you're one of the richest wizards I know. I'm sure you can afford it."
He looked at Malfoy's neck and was jolted by the urge to rub his nose to it, to inhale the sweet smell of citrus and sandalwood that must be Malfoy's shampoo or something. Harry sometimes caught whiffs of it when they passed in the corridors.
At the doorstep he reached down in his breast pocket and pulled out another one of his business cards and gave it to Harry. "In case you lost the first one," he said. "I am intrigued. Call me." He turned and Disapparated with a crack.
"Oh, Draco," he heard Harry say. "I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry. Ron, quick, give me something I can transfigure to a block of ice."
"Well, if that's how it is..." Ron started but he got interrupted by Gerorge, who darted his head out of the kitchen. "Come on, you sappy morons, you'll miss lunch!"
“Ah, Ron!,” Harry threw his arms out in front of him as he was pushed forward, Ron stumbling into his back. Harry collided with the body in front of him, the air temporarily knocked out of him.
“Love me?” Harry asked hopefully and the corner of Draco’s mouth pulled up in a smirk, his hands gripping each of Harry’s hips lightly. They were in Harry’s dorm; Draco had taken to spending as much time as physically possible with Harry. Apparently, some of the Slytherins had not taken Draco’s defection well.
Draco didn’t hear what Theo said to him as he searched for Harry in the crowd, he finally found him, Harry looked like he wanted nothing more than to pull out his cloak and disappear. Granger was shoving him from the table, fear clear on her face. Draco’s stare shifted to Weasley’s and was shocked to see the incredible rage and jealousy open on his face. People were yelling things at Harry as he slowly and meekly made his way from the hall. Draco had to get out; he had to be anywhere but here. Panic was clawing at his chest, and he absolutely would not lose it here in the Great Hall. Once Dumbledore left the room, all hell broke loose and Draco was able to make his way out of the hall away from his housemates.
Malfoy whipped around to look at what Harry was holding, but Harry pocketed it with a smirk. "Sorry. Top secret."
“Stop apologizing to me, I’m in the wrong here. For the record, I agree it was completely fucked up for them to bring Gabrielle into it. Fleur was fighting tooth and nail to get back into the Lake. Cursing at them in French. It was kind of terrifying.”
“Yes, we did,” Luna said still smiling and seeming not at all surprised about what had just happened.
Harry quickly realized he was in the Hospital Wing. He recognized the smell and the feel of the mattress beneath him. Harry slowly started to notice more of what was going on around him. Draco must be close by, he could feel his emotions loud and clear, and the pleasant warmth flowing from their bond. Harry tried to blink his eyes open but it was like they were glued shut. Why couldn’t he open them?
“She’s absolutely beside herself that she can’t host one this year,” Draco’s eyes focused over Millie’s shoulder where Harry was now dancing with Hermione. She was laughing and looked like she was having the time of her life. Draco was happy Harry was stepping out of his shell and letting himself have a good time.
“The only thing I can think of is maybe the Bubble-head Charm, but that’s really hard to maintain for a long period of time, especially if you aren’t a very strong swimmer.”
He pulled out a box with gold trim on the paper and had a sneaking suspicion of who it was from.  Draco glanced around the room and confirmed that everyone was thoroughly engrossed in unwrapping their own gifts before carefully opening his. On top of a layer of tissue paper was a note.
Harry snorted, “Uh huh, no ulterior motive? I thought we were past cursing each other. Or should I be on my guard again?” Harry asked coming up behind him, leaving barely any room between them.
“Yes, he will sleep. Of course you may stay, contact with you will only hasten the healing process. I will close the curtains now and return in the morning. If he should wake up before I return, do not hesitate to come get me should he need healing. As far as I’m aware he only had these minor injuries outside of the Cruciatus, and I will heal those in the morning. The Wing will be barred to anyone but the Headmaster and those requiring medical attention, I do not expect any visitors.”
Harry scoffed, “No, I didn’t. But I honestly don’t know how long I can not get changed in front of Ron before he starts to get suspicious.”
Draco glared at him fiercely, “If you have any value for my sanity, at all, you will end my suffering.”
Harry frowned, he hadn’t known that was even a thing either of them could do. He felt another stab of guilt for how terrible of a soul-mate he had been. “We’ll have to talk about that sometime, but first let’s focus on getting you better and fixing what suspicions might have come up from last night. I’m going to sneak out of here now, but I’ll be back.”
“I’m sure Madam Pomfrey will have me covered. I wish you the best of luck in finding the conclusion to those matters,” Draco responded, formality dripping in every word. He knew he probably sounded a lot like Lucius in that moment, but that was the point.
I'm really excited for next chapter. I won't spoil anything, but I promise you'll enjoy it. Thank you to everyone times a million for the outstanding reaction last chapter. I was nervous about it and yall definitely made me feel fantastic about it. We'll have to nail down exactly when the 'Lucius gets what is coming for him' club should meet!
“That’s actually bloody hilarious,” Ginny agreed. “I’ve never even heard of a polyamorous soul bonding though, it’s so cool.”
Harry shrugged again, “I guess? You remember the Dementors last year? Well I have sort of a severe reaction, as you know. When they come close I can hear my parent’s last few moments. That and I’ve dreamed about a bright flash of green light for as long as I can remember.” Malfoy was silent and Harry looked up at him. He had a look of unrestrained horror and disgust on his face.
To Draco’s surprise Theo snorted again, “Nah I just risked my arse against three of- age wizards to save your boyfriend because I felt it was ‘the right thing to do’. Fuck no! I mean, do I think you two are completely mad? Absolutely. But he could definitely do worse. And any person that changes you for the better in the way that he has over the past nine months is a good one in my book. I know it may not seem like a lot to you, but what you did with your dad? That was really fucking brave. You fucking exposed what those pieces of dragon shit have done to us our whole lives. People noticed. People said that it wasn’t okay. If what you did keeps Senior away from even just one Cruciatus this summer, I’m in your debt.”
“I don’t ever want you to block me out. You’re who has kept me sane through this year. I don’t know what I’d do without you. You put up with me, my crazy emotions, the Tasks. You’re friends with Hermione. You defend me, you’ve changed your whole life for me. Please don’t shut me out,” He pleaded. Draco bit his lip, still silent, but Harry felt his emotions flow back through.
“I have to use the loo anyway, Hermione don’t worry about it.” Harry quickly stepped out into the hall before anyone could say another word. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could go without baring his chest. Ron was going to think he had some weird mole or something.
“You. Have. Forgotten. Your. Place.” Father punctuated each word, his voice so low Draco could barely hear it. “It is time I reminded you.”
“People can like more than one gender, Ronald,” Ginny hissed. “Luna, he’s ruining this. Let’s go for a walk by the Forest. We can stop by the kitchens on the way.”
“I, for one, am glad he’s not hogging the mirror all morning,” Theo teased. Draco flicked a piece of corn at him, rolling his eyes.
Hermione bit her lip, “I’m sorry, I’m rubbish at healing. I’ve never learned.” She felt awful but didn’t know what else to do that wouldn’t make things worse. Draco seemed to acknowledge her words and had straightened his legs from the bent position they had been in. Hermione helped him into a seated position, figuring that getting his face off the ground would be beneficial all around. Draco went easily, still eerily silent.
Hermione hesitantly reached out and touched Draco’s shoulder briefly. They didn’t really touch each other often and she still half expected him to pull away in disgust. Instead he looked down at the spot she touched and then the ghost of the smile she had seen when she left him in Hogsmeade actually made it onto his face.  She quickly left the room, unwilling to shatter the moment.
Regardless, Harry was beginning to get worried at how frequently Draco’s emotions were depressed or cut off entirely (another thing Harry loathed Draco was able to do). Harry was becoming more and more preoccupied with what they were going to do over the summer. He didn’t think either of them could stand being apart for the entire hols.
“Draco, I had no idea. I wish you would have said something, I could have helped. I don’t have to leave love bites; we don’t have to lock ourselves up here as much as we do.”
“Enjoying yourselves?” Hermione asked. She did feel slightly bad for crashing the new couple’s first time together in Hogsmeade, but she figured once Draco’s meeting was over she could give them some privacy.
“I know you don’t love what you’re learning, but right now your best chance at survival is going to be running away. You’ve got fast reflexes, but you won’t be able to out duel a Dark wizard whose only intent is to harm you.”
Draco felt a tightening in his chest and realized the gillyweed was wearing off. An uncomfortable feeling in his neck told him Harry’s gills were gone. Draco grabbed at Pansy’s hand, squeezing hard in an effort to not lose his mind. He felt Harry suffocating, his thoughts becoming overwhelmed with panic. Just as Draco was about to throw all caution to the wind and alert the tournament organizers, a series of splashes and a feeling of relief signaled that Harry had surfaced. Weasley and a small girl that Draco assumed was Gabrielle, shortly followed by Harry, made their way towards the edge of the Lake. Draco was also interested to see a crowd of Merpeople had surfaced and were swimming with Harry, Weasley, and Gabrielle. Draco released his crushing grip on Pansy’s hand, taking deep breaths to calm himself down and forget the feeling of Harry drowning.
"I'd have figured you would think I deserved it." Malfoy said quietly, adding what looked like moth's wings into the potion and stirring it clockwise with a silver rod.
Harry opened his mouth to retort but was distracted by a commotion from the Hufflepuff table. Two girls were staring at each other mouth agape, in unison they pulled up on the sleeves of their robes to reveal what looked like an elaborate knot of lines on each of their arms. They immediately pressed their arms against each other and Harry could just barely see that the pattern completed on the other girls’ arm. The surrounding people began to clap and the girls wrapped their arms around each other, crying.
Draco cleared his throat, turning back towards his potion in an effort to buy some time to school his features, “You surprised me is all, I do hate it when I am interrupted.” He forced as much annoyance and indignation into his voice as he could muster. His heart rate was beginning to slow down.
Regardless of how softly Draco had placed his glasses on his face, his face still pinched uncomfortably underneath the metal. Harry wondered what his face must look like to hurt this badly.
Draco felt like an absolute prat for the corniness of what he was about to say, but couldn’t bring himself to care, “Nothing about you is ugly, shut the fuck up, that’s my soul-mate you’re insulting.”
"Draco your hair is leaving a puddle," Hermione commented and Draco looked down to confirm her observation.
“Hermione, there’s a very likely chance that Voldemort is living there or at the very least popping in from time to time, fuck no,” Draco whispered. The last thing he wanted was the entire table starting to interrogate him.
"We have to figure it out! Father absolutely cannot know," Malfoy said urgently, moving for the first time as he took a step towards Harry. Harry felt stress and anxiety flare up inside of him again as Malfoy worriedly chewed on his lip and began quickly cracking his knuckles.
A boom echoed and all four champions hastened to the water’s edge and waded in. Harry paused to swallow his handful of gillyweed, then waded all the way into the water. Draco could not contain a quiet gasp as he felt his lower extremities become soaked in the chill. It was like before, like he was experiencing the cold second hand, but this water was insane. Draco felt like his legs were being stabbed by tiny needles. The transformation began and as Harry stood out of the water Draco felt the odd and incredibly uncomfortable sensation of growing gills. The skin on his neck felt as though it were tearing.
“He knew they were going to lose, he didn’t want it to drag on any longer than it needed to. The Irish chasers were unbeatable.” Harry said staring at Dean’s hand. He wondered if he and Malfoy would ever be that comfortable together. He highly doubted it.
“He really isn’t absolutely dreadful on a broom is he?” Theo commented and Draco did not dare to respond.
“I shouldn’t have said you were doing it to be a hero. It was just so fucking terrifying to feel you drowning. It’s all I could dream about last night.”
“Don’t worry Malfoy, it doesn’t,” Harry called back. “Best bundle up for it though; I know how you Slytherins get when the weather isn’t absolutely perfect.”
"How the hell am I supposed to keep this hidden then? I could barely keep myself together for a few hours!" Harry ran his hands through his hair before plastering his fringe back against his forehead.
Hermione figured that the scarf must be helping at least a little as Draco’s hand came up to hold it more solidly to his cheek.
“You can call me a Mudblood today if you need to, I don’t care. Whatever you need to do to keep your father from catching on or doing something,” Hermione said, her eyes fixing to his pale face. He had massive bags under his eyes, which also looked distinctly bloodshot like he hadn’t slept much the night before.
The trio set out across the campground, eyes wide as they took in the various scenes they encountered.
“Yeah, a bit. I supposed I don’t have to ask you. Come to think of it, I’m surprised Ron hasn’t woken up yet. His stomach pretty much rules his schedule.”
“We know!” They said in unison, messing up his hair roughly. “You’re on your own explaining away your night time escapades with Ronnikins.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “What about it? You didn’t think Hagrid was just like freakishly tall, did you?”
Harry brightened, those were questions he knew the answers to, “We were only a few minutes in, but on the very far side of the grounds. I couldn’t see the castle or the lake anymore. They were all just about as tall as the trees.”
“Well, I guess it was time she knew anyways. Fair is fair.” Draco took a deep breath, steeling himself for the questioning he was about to get. Draco left the loo and almost laughed at the way Pansy’s eyes grew to the size of saucers.
“It wasn’t, Lucius used her seal so that I would open it. More blood supremacy bullshit. Thankfully, he is sending an elf to come retrieve me from the platform. I have my letter ready to give to them instead. I sealed it with my magical signature so they’ll know I wrote it.”
“They said they’re taking something from me, something I’ll ‘sorely miss’. I don’t exactly want to lose anything I’d ‘sorely miss’.” Harry kept making airquotes around ‘sorely miss’.
I hope everyone has had a wonderful holiday, whatever that may be. 2020 is wrapping up and I just want to say that everyone who has taken a moment to read this story has been a massively bright moment in my year. 2020 has been rough on all of us, but I can honestly say yall have dramatically changed mine for the better. Thanks for being the best readers in the world.
Theo smirked back at him, “Come on, let’s go grab breakfast before they come looking for us. We’re going to need full stomachs if we’re committing some Azkaban-able offenses.”
“Of course, Albus, you know that you we will always help anyway that we can,” Mrs. Weasley frowned, but looked determined.
“That’s disgusting,” Ron said through clenched teeth, grabbing Hermione and pulling her between Fred and himself.
“How did you get rid of everyone?” Harry asked, rifling in his pockets, and plopped down onto the empty chair next to Draco’s bed.
Harry rolled his eyes, “You look fantastic, as per usual.” His eyes drifted to the pouch still perched at the foot of his bed.
“That oaf, Hagrid, was chatting my ear off. I was worried he would report me for being out on the grounds, so I had to let him.” Theo sighed; acting like it had been an absolutely awful night. Draco’s anxiety was skyrocketing the longer this went on. Something was up, he was sure of it.
Draco closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, trying to focus on getting the shampoo out of Harry’s hair. “Did Lucius do anything to harm you?”
“What did he curse him with? You figured it out,” Harry accused, grabbing onto her hand as he picked up the pace so he didn’t leave her behind. Hermione let herself be dragged, she wanted to get there as fast as possible.
“More pain, obviously. Er, he feels weird now. Maybe he’s under Imperius? But he can fight that off. Ah yeah, that stopped, he feels angry. He feels determined.”
Draco brought his hands up to his face and scrubbed hard, “I wasn’t even trying to curse her or you. If I’m being honest I was aiming for Weasley, but he’s being awful to you, he deserved it! I didn’t want to call her that name, but I can’t just stop overnight. I was drawing suspicion. You have no idea how hard I’m scrutinized! I’m drowning over here trying to balance it all!” Draco burst, grabbing the pillow from beneath his head and smothering himself with it. “I’m lost; I don’t know what I’m doing!” His last words muffled by the pillow.
“Oi! Ron, Harry!” Dean Thomas waved from in front of a tent completely decked out in shamrocks and various other decorations in emerald green. His soul-mate, Seamus Finnegan, was wearing a matching outfit, completely plastered with shamrocks accented by a yellow edging.
“Yes, my Father has. Something like that, anyway. My Mother has not, well I guess technically she did slap me once. I deserved it though at least. I aimed some choice language at her and some of her guests at tea. I pretty much knew what was going to happen before I said it, but,” Draco shrugged.
“Draco, absolutely not, you know he doesn’t change anything. I’m just sorry,” Harry assured, he seemed to be slowly rousing from the stupor he had been in. Shock, most likely, if Draco were to hazard a guess.
“You could have and you should have! Someone cast the Dark Mark, who knows what else they could have done! And what the fuck actually happened here, if Weasley did this, I’ll kill him,” Malfoy said bringing his hand up towards Harry’s bruise before quickly pulling his hand away, clasping it at his side in a tight fist.
“See what?” Draco asked, did she honestly think he was going to give this type of information freely? She was going to have to fight for it.
“Hey,” Draco said, catching his hand. Harry suspected he must have felt the crazy whirl of emotions inside of him through the bond. Harry stared at their clasped hands.
Poppy closed the curtains behind her, leaving the two boys some privacy. She bit the inside of her cheek. The way Draco Malfoy insisted upon such formality ensured she couldn’t take the image of his father from her brain. At times she had to remind herself who she was facing. That she was facing a 14 year old child, not the father he looked so similar to. Whom he at times acted so similar to. One thing was for certain, she had never heard Lucius Malfoy cry the way she could hear Draco weeping right now. He was being eerily quiet, something Poppy was sure he learned how to do at some point during his lifetime. Especially after hearing the almost idle comment that revealed Draco had been on the receiving end of a Cruciatus curse, probably at more than one instance. Her mind briefly flashed to the black eye she had seen Draco sporting just a few months ago.
"Thank you, Mrs. Weasley. Please call me Draco. Also please accept my sincerest apologies for any feud between your family and Lucius. I do not stand by anything he has said or done in the past and will be separating myself from his reputation at the earliest opportunity. If there is anything I can do to right his wrongs, do not hesitate to let me know."
Harry rolled his eyes, then gasped quietly as Draco’s lips pressed against his forehead before coming back down to his lips, kissing Harry again for a few moments before nipping lightly at his lip and pulling away. “We definitely should have been doing that before.”
Until finally Draco had been able find what he had been looking for. He had had a shadow of a memory of a bedtime story Mother had told him once. She had been talking about soul-mates, a bedtime favourite for him when he was young, and had talked about how if he found his soul-mate that he would even be able to become a full wizard early and run off with his soul-mate and start his own adventures with them.  Sure enough she had been speaking of a very real, but outdated Pureblood tradition. All he had had to do was have found his soul-mate, and prove to his family’s magical artefact that he was worthy of taking on the duties being heir to the line meant for him, and he was golden. He was officially an adult in the eyes of magic. As far as Draco could tell it hadn’t been used in centuries. Mostly because not many families still had their family’s artefact, or followed the Head of House conduct like the Malfoy’s did. As it was, Lucius barely followed it.
Harry had never been any good at dancing. He'd tried, with his friends and with Ginny, but he'd never been able to see the facination in shuffling about, feeling stupid and having a whack at finding the beat.
Zabini shook his head, clearly amused. "You're dipping your Death Eater cock in our Saviour's arse," he chuckled. "In his married, presumed to be straight arse, I might add. Oh, what wonderful gossip this is." He clapped his hands together in delight.
Harry moved his hand to the man's neck and lifted him up from where his forehead had pressed against Harry's shoulder, and met grey eyes, glazed over and lust-blown.
"In that case, I believe you have more than half a chance of making a decent job at it." Malfoy looked very solemnly at him.
Harry ran. Out of the front doors, out in the tempered night. He stopped and bent over, trying to catch his breath.
"That woman is pure evil! Astoria is my former fiancée, for Merlin's sake. I'll have to go over and talk to her."
Potter moaned and sort of melted on top of him, the length of his body over his, their naked torsos against each other. Everything inside Draco screamed YES, YES, YES!
"What is this strange Muggle currency you've been handing out?" He was fingering Harry's Master Card. "I've seen Muggle money before, you know, and it looks nothing like this."
They were directed to a table and Harry could thankfully hide behind the leather-bound menu, as they sat down. He wasn't used to pull 'the famous card' and this whole situation was unsettling. His hands were sweaty and his stomach felt like he had swallowed a Hippogriff.
Harry felt a knotted mess in his stomach of all the questions that were still unanswered. "So, have you forgiven me?" he croaked out. "Maybe you even like me a little?"
"See what?" Harry asked and took the glass at Hermione's side. Dinner seamed to be delayed and he was still thirsty from flying.
She put the cardboard boxes down in front of them. The rich smell of curry immediatly filled the room and Harry felt his stomach ache of hunger.
Luna couldn't leave Rolf alone, the twins were teething, but she hoped they all would come to their Winter solstice party, where the name-ceremony was to take place. Why they had waited so long to name their children was beyond Harry, but Luna claimed the babies hadn't been able to tell them what they wanted to be called until now.
"All right," Harry said. "Let's go then. As friends." He smiled at Malfoy. "Choose a bar and we'll have a couple of drinks and see what happens. What about this one? The name doesn't leave you in any doubt, does it?" He pointed at an ad for a club called G.A.Y. "Or this one, it's not far from where we are now."
At that, his knees gave in, and by instinct, he reached out for something to hold on to, which happened to be Harry's hand. It was warm and the grip was firm. He smiled at Draco and then Draco smiled back, one of his rare genuine smiles that totally transformed his face. He wasn't aware of it, but it was breath-taking.
"A house in the country, a garden, not really like the Burrow, but something similar. Laughter, children's laughter. Maybe a dog."
It was totally unpredictable. Sometimes slow and meticulous, sometimes it was like a race, or even some kind of revenge. I was like a drug Harry couldn't get enough of and was getting more and more dependent of.
Harry reached out and gave Malfoy's hand a little squeeze on the table. "You're not a coward. You were just a kid then, same as me. Neither of us should be held responsible for what happened during the war. We were forced to do what we did, both of us. Besides, you saved my life, I'll never forget that."
"You ask too many fucking questions, Potty," Malfoy seethed and turned his face away. "I'm not here to indulge your curiosity."
"Who else?" There was laughter in her voice, but her eyes were serious. "Who else but you, Longbottom, would turn out to be my knight in shiny armours? That was one hell of an abduction just now. A girl isn't often swept off her feet like that, you know." She came closer and her eyes roamed his face. "Fuck, you're even pureblood. Mother will pee in her pants of delight."
"They're both completely exhausted by the turmoil of emotions," said what must be Madam Pomfrey. "I gave Draco some Dreamless Sleep, but that could harm the foetus, so Harry is on Calming Draught only."
Harry frowned and seemed to think. "Bisexual, I guess. I still like witches too. You know they will think the same about you."
"My mother was very persistant, and I still belived at that time, that marrying a pureblood witch and concieving an heir was what I wanted and was obliged to do, no matter what. But you see, I couldn't get a position. After the trials and ,my father's death, I studied hard and took my NEWT exams, not with bad grades, I might add."
In truth, Harry was more than a little upset. He had spent the whole night pacing and pulling his hair, trying to sort out all his mixed emotions. In the end he came up to one conclusion; he liked having Draco around.
He felt close to falling to the floor and just die, right there, but he had to see Harry's face, if he was smearing and making fun of him. But the green eyes were dead serious and as they flicked all over Draco's long slim body, he mumbled under his breath, "God, you look amazing!"
"There's no need to behave like a boorish oaf, Harry. Can I call you Harry?" he added, cocking his head and smiled. Harry glared but said nothing.
Draco had to be honest; he shook his head. "How can we? How could anyone.. how could you ever forgive me for what I've done?" There was a big lump in his throat now and he had to struggle to swallow.
"It's not the same," Al wailed. "They used to have prisoners chained up down there. It's awesome! And there's a huge garden with peacocks and loads of stuff. Oh, pleeease, can I go?"
Ron cleared his throat. "Ginny wouldn't say, but is this why... It's none of our business, mate, but are you..." He gave a short cough. "Did you two split up because you like blokes?"
"Did you come here to gloat? "Well, now you've had your little fun." He wiped the back of his hand under his nose.
"It's fine. Mother and I had dinner. We had a lot to catch up on and I lost track of time. I only just now returned to my rooms."
He grabbed Harry's hand on top of the table and brought it up to his face. "You're supposed to be madly infatuated with me, remember," he smirked, and his lips ghosted over Harry's knuckles. Harry's face flushed bright red and he withdrew his hand as if it'd been burnt.
The person in Harry's arms covered him in a way that made it impossible to tell who it was, but Harry knew instantly that it wasn't Ginny. He was having sex with someone else.
Ron turned to his fellow-Gryffindor. "He's got the map out. Who's the first one he always looks for on the map?"
Harry shoved his hands deep down in his jeans-pockets and inclined his head out towards the busy street. "There's thousands of pubs and bars all over London."
Harry saw to that Draco had a glass of wine in his hand before he left him to catch up with his old Slytherins, and sat himself down with a heavy sigh. He had three more months to go and he already felt huge. Unexpectedly, and to Harry's delight, Ginny sat down beside him and handed him a plate filled with food. He smiled thankfully at her.
"Mr Malfoy…  Draco," Headmistress McGonnagall started, "I've received news about a recent development, and I can see that your mother has written to you, as I can only guess, about the same matter. Why don't you take a moment here and read your mother's letter?"
After all the years of therapy Harry had undergone since his final break with Ginny, he had learned not to let his anger flare up, not to his children anyway, when they meant well in their condescending way. Harry only muttered something under his breath and kept his eyes to his working hands.
Sha had the prettiest ears. They were pink and small and shaped like a delicate shell. A black and silver earring dangled from the lobe. She pushed her shoulder-length dark hair behind it with her hand and wrinkled her small, upturned nose. The imperfection of her nose, in all her otherwise perfect appearance made Neville love her even more.
"Auror Potter, this is the solicitor, that is handling our case. You have an appointment with him at his office at 3 pm tomorrow." Head-Auror Robards' secretery handed him a business card.
"Oh." Green eyes turned to Draco. Harry drained the last in his glass and put it down with a thud. "I can understand that your mother wants you to be closer, but I will miss you."
"Without this I never would have won against Voldemort, you know that?" He could feel its magic tinge in his hand. "We're quite good friends, the hawthorn and I." He waved the wand and dimmed the lights.
With a heavy moan Harry collapsed on top of him and his lips searched and found Malfoy's. Now they were soft and reassuring and Harry could feel a smile pull at the corner of the blond's mouth as they played and nibbled. Harry buried his face in the crook of his neck as he slid off him and felt his limbs grow heavy with sleep. Malfoy put an arm around him and whispered, "You'll be the death of me, Potter. I always knew you would."
When they walked out of the empty kitchen and out into the garden, Draco hummed and gave Harry a sideways glance. "You've grown bigger. Are you alright?"
His father cleared his throat. "You know, of course, how this works, Draco? A marriage, for a member of a family like ours, depends on many different aspects and a person's soulmate is by no means the most significant. Your mother and I was very lucky, and I can only hope at this point, that you, as my only son, will be granted the same happiness. But bear in mind; if the name that appear isn't of Pure-blood heritage, a liaison of that kind is out of the question." He produced his wand out of his sleeve. "Give me your hand, son."
"Yes, you've been so distant and quiet lately," her sister added. "And when this nice young man suggested a party, I thought it was just the right thing to cheer you up. I think all of your friends from school are here, except the Crabbe's boy. And that lovely girl Astoria came up and said hallo to me. She's such a beauty, don't you think?"
Harry didn't know when it started, when it crept up on him, but suddenly he found that he'd let himself go. First it was the Quidditch-practice he never seemed to have time for, then with his promotion as Senior-Auror he got more and more deskwork and Ministry meetings and less fieldwork. The final blow came when he became a stay-at-home-Dad.
Harry snorted. "I didn't mean right here. I meant this... bloody party." He waved his hands to illustrate over at the almost empty Ministry ballroom. Only a few couples were still up on the dancefloor. "Who invited you?"
Draco swallowed. He looked down on his hand clutching Potter's, no Harry's. It was still a little sticky from the dried cum and that was actually pretty didgusting, but also proof of how close they were in this moment. Draco took the wand he had placed at his side and cast a
Slowly Draco woke in the rays of the morning sun. They splashed across his face and made him close his eyes firmly shut again. His head hurt and his mouth was dry like sawdust, and he had the most disturbing notion of not being in his own bed. The smell of the sheets was different.
"Is this working for you?" he suddenly heard Malfoy drawl beside him. Harry turned his head in Malfoy's direction, but before he could react, Malfoy put his hand over Harry's crotch and gave it a squeeze. "No, I thought so."
He was instantly pressed against a broad shoulder clad in  black velvet as the arm curled around his waist. The feather-light hair stroked along Harry's nose and some masculine hair-product whiffed his nostrils. "Malfoy?" he gasped. "What… I mean…"
"Thanks," he said. There was a warm hearty feeling in the group, and under other circumstances Harry might have sat down for a while, and obviously disappoint them with his lack of knowledge in young Muggle culture. "I'd love to, but you see, me and my friend, we have some things to discuss, so I think we'll just stay at the bar."
His blond opponent smirked, "Why? Aren't you up to it anymore, Scarhead? Are you getting slow and heavy?"
He walked over to the door down the corridor, turned and looked at Harry before he entered. Harry gave a sigh and followed. Of course, he followed.
"You know damned well that people here find places to shag regulary and even spend nights together. Hermione frequently sleeps in your dorm, haven't you noticied?" There was a hint of frustration in her tone. She clenched her teeth and took a deep breath as if to calm herself.
THey worked surprisingly well together, although Malfoy had to correct again and again what Harry did, and although he always did it with a disdainful smirk and a lifted eyebrow, they actually had fun standing side by side, chopping and mushing. Harry found it comforting to feel the light brush from Malfoy's elbow on his forearm and the thought of touching that smooth pale skin, so close, but still out of reach, made his heart beat a little faster. It was their secret, theirs alone. Occationally Harry would make a mistake and Malfoy would roll his eyes, and occationally their fingers would touch while they worked.
Something cold took hold in the pit of Draco's stomach. "I don't know what to do," he said. He heard how weak he sounded. "My father…"
Harry huffed a laugh. "Yeah, I guess I did. It still shocked me at the time, though. That you didn't give me away."
"No, I didn't know that then." Draco's voice grew softer. "You had the most amazing green eyes, enlarged by those horrible spectacles, as you stood there in your too big robes, and you looked as if the world was handed to you like a big birthday-cake. I felt an instant pull towards you. If we'd never met after that, I doubt if it would've made such a dent in my memory, but we did. And then I blew everything by trying to act like my father. After that it all got worse in every way."
"I was going through some things," he called and beckoned Harry to come over, "and I found my mother's stack of old records. I'm trying to make this work." He bent over what seemed to be an old crank gramophone with his wand out and his hair falling over his face like a curtain.
How did I end up in his knee? I tugged at his Slytherin tie and his crisp white shirt to get to his bare skin and he clawed equally fiercely at the nape of my neck, in my hair, and then his fingers were digging into the flesh of my buttocks, pressing our pelvises together. It felt like, finally. FINALLY! That's when the door flung open and Blaise Zabini stepped in.
Harry did, far too well. But it would be worth it, he reminded himself. And blow over. Everything would eventually blow over.
It wasn't as this was the first blow-job Harry had received. Ginny had been quite fond of it, actually, but Malfoy's mouth was bigger and as he expertly swirled his tongue around the head, sucked and pulled, he could also take Harry deeper, all the way to the root without gagging. Harry looked down at the blond head that kept bobbing up and down on his prick, and it was so good. He felt his stomach heat up and his toes curl and faster than he thought possible, he was getting close. He tried to communicate this through his ragged breaths and ended up running his fingers through the silky soft hair, pushing him away. But Malfoy took a firm grip at Harry's hip and continued sucking and moaning, as if Harry was the tastiest thing, his cheeks hollowed and his lips nuzzled into the dark curls of Harry's groin. Then, Harry came. He felt the force of his orgasm rapidly build, from the pit in his stomach to the mush his brain had become, and he came in Malfoy's warm mouth, with loads and loads, his hips bucking, his hands pulling at Malfoy's hair and gasping for air.
Harry stretched like a cat. He woke up alone in the ruffled bed, just like the other times. Malfoy must have left right after Harry fell asleep. Everything was the same, yet it wasn't.
After Harry had left Molly in the kitchen, slightly sobbing but with a happy smile on her face, he went into the sitting room, hugged everybody there and admired the tree. They were soon joined by the three men from the garden-shed, who smelled suspiciously of whiskey this early on Christmas Eve, and a newly awaken Charlie emerged from upstairs, dark circles under his eyes, but with a wide grin at Harry as usual.
"You stopped. You turned on me, you pushed me." This close up Potter's eyes were too big for his face, and surprisingly held flecks of gold buried in the green. Draco bit his lip. He knew exactly how he used to react to displays of Potter's magic. He guessed he'd always be a sucker for powerful wizards.
"What makes you think I'm the one to contact about your broken Floo?" Draco Malfoy drawled and narrowed his eyes, his pointy chin jutted out stubbornly. "Just because I mended that blasted cabinet, doesn't make me an expert on Magical Transportation."
"'Couse their only way of communicating is through wands and fists and, obviously, dicks," Ron muttered.
"Hm-hm," Poppy hummed and cast a few basic diagnostic spells. Nothing distinct, apart from what she'd been told; nausea, slightly low blood-pressure, low on magnesia and iron. He definitively needed to eat better. She pocketed her wand, put her hands on his stomach and pressed lightly. "Any pain?" she asked.
They finally cought up with him in the dungeons. Ron put up his hand to stop Neville, who came rushing after him, out of breath and panting heavily. They had to run for quite a bit, Harry being surprisingly fast, and they'd lost track of him more than once.
"Look at the pictures, Ron," she yelled and jabbed her hand at one of the most vivid, where Harry turned his head and gave Draco a smile. Harry remembered the moment. They were in dress robes at the Gala and had just made a very generous anonymous donation together. The photo didn't show it, but Draco had squeezed Harry's hand hidden in the folds of the wide garments.
"Well," she said as she joined the two men on the living room sofa. "Start at the beginning." And Harry did.
Harry sat rod right up and froze. Malfoy bent down, placed a hand on Harry's shoulder and held him in place. His breath ghosted over Harry's neck and Harry shuddered. "Especially as he was tied up to all corner of our four-poster marital bed," Malfoy whispered huskily.
Blaise had come up at her side. He banged his fists in a rapid staccato. "Don't be such a drama-queen and open the fucking door. It's my dorm too."
