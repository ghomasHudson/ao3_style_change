Draco and Harry pop into the same sitting room of Grimmauld Place as before, only they’re on the loveseat this time and MV Harry is kneeling on the rug by the fireplace.
He couldn’t even attend his Arithmancy lessons or Magical Runes. Draco only had his school books for learning, which he had already finished reading.
Harry suddenly worried about retaining a single idea from today’s class, regardless of any Language Charms.
“—It should clear up,” Harry muttered darkly, quickly pushing a friendly smile into place when Mrs Mulberry seemed apprehensive by his change in demeanour.
No, because I shaved my hair off.
Draco sat up straight and deliberated his next move, a smirk burgeoning on his face when he made his decision. With a more firmly applied pressure, so as not to tickle, Draco ran the wool scarf down the sole of Harry’s left foot from toe to heel. It resulted in a shiver and a few garbled words, muffled by Harry’s fist in his mouth. Draco repeated the moment a few more times, digging his thumb into the low arch and massaging the stiff muscle. Harry couldn’t silence his next groan and pushed back against Draco’s grip.
Harry groans as they plop onto their arses on the hearth of a stone fireplace in the Slytherin boys’ dormitory. He blinks once he realises this is a universe where he’d listened to the Sorting Hat and had stayed in the first house suggested. He has his own bed, nestled between Theo and Draco. All three have their emerald curtains open while snores ring out across the room from three closed curtains in various tones and volumes. Presumably, Zabini, Crabbe, and Goyle if nothing else has changed here.
Draco prepared himself for the worst. To spend the rest of the school year hiding his face in shame, behind a veil of black lace, to show proof of his contrition.
need to work on their nonverbal communication because Harry can’t understand any of the hand signals Draco is throwing his way.
“Okay, we can leave now.” Draco pulls Harry’s arm tighter around him and spins the Time-Turner with haste. They pop out of the alternate universe before Harry even gets to check the game’s score.
Draco levitates another vial over to him and ladles a bit of steamed foam off the top of his brew, before he holds it up to the light for inspection. The sample is a golden-green shade with black specs floating inside. Harry is so marvelled at the difference between smoke and brew, the potion’s sheer ability to transmogrify that he nearly forgets to feel insulted.
Draco gave Harry’s foot another squeeze then dragged the wool up his calf, ruffling the dark leg hair along the way. He returned to trailing the fringe along sensitive inner thighs, amusedly watching the muscles tense and jump underneath his ministrations. Harry flat out whimpered and began to clamp his legs shut on either side of Draco until a wool-covered palm smacked the outside of one thigh in punishment.
“Millicent isn’t creepy Weasley. She’s an acquired taste.”
Until he puffs up his chest, feeling cocky. “We’re not together in
And the colours turned blue like Malfoy’s eye and Harry could breathe. He could see again, could feel the fabric of Malfoy’s sleeves under his hands where he had gripped so tightly, he’d left indentions behind.
But Harry watches, and wanks, and comes far too early. While Draco is still humping the giant dragon plush toy, his hips working overtime until milky ejaculate is smeared across the dark fur of the toy.
. When he knew they were not.
Oh fuck. Harry thought he’d been discreet enough to keep anyone from noticing. And of all the fucking people, it had to be bloody
He’d barely taken one step past before Harry’s arm shot out to stop him from leaving. “Malfoy, wait!” Swallowing his pride, Harry pocketed his wand, then held out his map and timetable. “You know French, right? I saw you with Beauxbatons students during the Tri-Wizard Tournament,” he admitted, conveniently leaving out that he had been spying on Draco from under his invisibility cloak at the time. Harry scraped his trainers on the floor and rubbed the back of his neck with a sheepish shrug. “I’m sort of lost.”
Universe.”
Although the wretched frames did leave the most unsightly imprints on his copper skin.
Draco swallowed the irritating lump in his throat as his eyes fluttered open. Potter was still staring, his gaze a ravenous green. Well, time to fix what he’s bollocksed up. “You aren’t going to embarrass me by ordering something atrocious like Pistacho, are you?”
With forgiveness in his heart, Draco let the wool trace a tiny crooked line over Harry’s nose, then a line across his throat that ended near his left shoulder. His lips curled into a proud smile when Harry gasped and realization filtered over his face, evident even despite the blindfold covering that deep jade eyes. Slowly, Draco continued to trace invisible lines across Harry’s torso, lines that matched his own Sectumsempra scars. He ran the wool over a nipple, crisscrossed over both hips, over one diagonal line which spanned his entire rib cage. Draco hesitated at Harry’s left wrist, then pressed firmly when he travelled up the length of his forearm. Harry sniffed loudly when it was followed up by a dozen horizontal lines over the same space.
As Harry blinks through crooked glasses, he sees a bright sky and two Quidditch teams flying through the air overhead. Professional Quidditch teams. He recognises the colours of Puddlemere and the Falcons easily enough. They must have Apparated out of Draco’s lab and onto a random pitch, but Harry has no clue how.
Scandalised, Draco smacks Harry’s hand away and hikes his trousers back up, sorting his clothes while ignoring Harry and the noise of their MV selves, who are going at it faster now.
“Master Black is being late,” Nipsy interrupted, with a brown sack lunch in each hand, her sternness quite the contrast from her bright yellow dress. “
Not only were they caught
,” Scorpius said, his short steps slower than normal as he took in the pastel wall decor.
Draco inhaled deeply and wiped the spit from his mouth with the back of his hand. Merlin, he was drooling already and he hadn’t even started.
Of course — they shouted, they sniped, they had multiple rounds of fisticuffs — but they found a way to make the sticky situation work.
Harry panics once he realises he’s not alone in the Muggle sex shop. He isn’t worried about being outed or judged for his purchases. He’s sweating at the possibility of being recognised by Draco.
Harry licks his lips and finally finds it possible to speak, stuttering as he asks, “Is that even possible?”
“You are aware that demolishing this castle won’t help Hogwarts rebuild any faster?” drawled a bored voice behind him.
The longer Draco ruminated on all of this, the closer he felt to going into a snit about it, and they simply didn’t have the time.
“Hey.”
“Well, maybe you’ll get the Winnie the Pooh lego set for Christmas, and then Mr. Bumblebee—”
to be in therapy, which would help a lot more if you didn’t skip out on half of your appointments—”
“That—” If Harry were blindfolded, he’d swear someone’s lubed fingers were wanking him off, in tight, slow strokes. However, seeing as that was clearly not happening, his mind was justifiably shorting out.
I was. Until this wretched disease ruined my entire life.
“Like Seokjin?”
Or maybe it was the thick, forest green sweater he was dressed in. Until Potter shifted to pat Rose on the shoulder and the beginnings of a soft stomach were apparent under the fabric’s stretch. Draco needed to remember which thoughts were particularly inappropriate for a classroom full of five-year-olds. He could feel the start of drool gathering on the sides of his tongue.
“Yeah,” Potter nodded. “His name is Teddy.”
Caught by surprise, Potter took the vial with clumsy fingers, only barely managing not to spill it, but he hesitated only a few seconds before following Draco’s directions. As he added the potion to the cauldron and gave it a slow swirl, Draco could’ve sworn he saw him smile.
Casual reminder that this fic is rated explicit! Tags have been updated.
He could hear Pansy saying his name, a soft question tinged with that familiar note of concern. He ignored her, ignored the curious stares of all of his classmates, barely pausing to snatch up his bookbag before he left the room.
I know it's been a long time since I last updated and I'm really sorry about that. I've had some serious health issues recently, and most days I haven't felt well enough to write, so unfortunately this story got sidelined. I really appreciate everyone who has waited and is still reading, thank you for your patience!
But he was sure about this, so sure that he felt as if his bones were aching with it. And he could try to tell Potter that – tell him
Potter sighed. “Fine,” he conceded, glancing at Draco’s still-bare chest. “Do you want to heal the rest of those scars first?”
It was all new to Draco, equal parts thrilling and nerve-wracking. He was inexperienced, to say the least; his only previous experience with another man had been nearly two years ago, and it had been nothing like this. That encounter had been clumsy and desperate, the awkward experiment of two teenagers.
Potter had grown bored with pretending to listen to Slughorn’s story, or perhaps he sensed that he was being watched, because just then he turned his head. As he caught Draco in his stare, the blonde became acutely aware that he hadn’t just been looking at Potter—he had been
They worked quietly together like that for a while, and although it wasn’t exactly companionable, it at least wasn’t wholly unpleasant, which was better than Draco might have expected. After about twenty minutes of silence, Granger rolled up the essay she’d been working on and set it aside, reaching for her bookbag. Draco spared her an idle glance as she began to search through it, noticing her efforts gradually become more frantic.
Anger twisted on Potter’s face and Draco was satisfied to see that it matched his own. This was the way their relationship should be, the way it had always been: hostile, vindictive, simple. Much simpler than having to think about the pressure of his lips, or the movement of his body, or the cruel tease of forgiveness that his friendship offered.
Draco had to work to keep the irritation from his tone. “What is, sir?”
“Don’t get him too worked up, Potter, or Madam Pomfrey will have your head,” she said with a breezy wave. Draco glared at her back as she departed, her shiny dark hair seeming to laugh at him as it disappeared beyond the doors of the Hospital Wing, leaving him alone with Potter.
“I guess I still forget, sometimes.” Draco could feel the warmth of his breath as he spoke, a contrast to the chill touch of their damp clothes. “All the things magic can do.”
Draco shook his head. “Gods, no.” His mother had enough on her plate to worry about. Even though her house arrest had been lifted after Potter spoke on her behalf at her trial, just as he had at Draco’s, she hardly ever left the manor. She seemed permanently on edge these days, always tense and jumpy, and with Lucius locked up in Azkaban for another three years, the only people she spoke to anymore were Draco and the family house elves.
“You hear that, Potter?” She raised her eyebrows, a grin playing at the corners of her lips. “No
He let his hand fall away from his chest, lifting his gaze to meet Draco’s. His expression was open in a way Draco had not seen before, almost vulnerable, and although he still didn’t quite understand what Potter was saying, not really, Draco didn’t push any further.
After a long moment, he turned back to face Slughorn.
The ringing of the bell marking the end of the class period was a unique kind of cruelty. Immediately, both of them stilled, listening over their hushed breathing for the tell-tale sound of footsteps in the hallway. Although he knew it was in vain, Draco wished that the sound would never come, for he knew that then the spell would be broken, and he wanted more than anything to hold on to it for just a few minutes longer.
“Just what?” Potter challenged.
Grabbing his copy of
Potter huffed a laugh, looking both pleased and embarrassed at the compliment. “And here you thought I would be no help,” he teased.
Draco's chin jutted forward. "It’s not my fault this school has such atrocious food.”
you?” Draco didn’t even know why he was shocked. Who would have dared to say no to the great Harry Potter’s face, only weeks after he had defeated the Dark Lord and ended what most had believed to be an un-winnable war?
Draco had to admit, if it weren’t for the frizzy mane of hair, he could almost have imagined that it was Pansy speaking, reminding him for the thousandth time that he should eat something.
Draco didn’t know what to say. All he could do was nod, holding just a bit more tightly against Potter. It must have been enough because Potter smiled, pressing one last kiss to his lips before he grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him out into the rain. As they ran back to the castle, neither of them caring anymore about the water soaking through their clothes, the reckless beat of Draco’s heart sounded like the same word, repeated over and over again.
For some reason, Potter seemed irked by this response. His frown deepened, a small crease appearing on his forehead.
“Draco? Dinner? Hello?” Pansy waved her hand in front of his face, blocking his view.
“Oh? What changed?”
Annoyed by the unexpected teasing, Draco dragged his clouded focus away from the heat of Potter’s thigh, placed so enticingly between his own. There was an odd hesitancy to the sudden change in Potter’s actions that he couldn’t quite interpret. He could feel the desire in Potter’s touch, the eagerness in the movement of his hips. But if Potter wanted this, then what was the problem?
“Are you sure?” Draco could feel the softly spoken question against his skin. He had forgotten the room around them, had forgotten anything that existed beyond the reach of their breath; the world had narrowed down to this space between them, Potter’s words filling the only remaining void.
Draco watched him hurry out the door, unmoving. He didn’t know what else he had expected, but he couldn’t help feeling a sharp stab of disappointment all the same.
“Give me the paper, Pansy.” Draco held out his hand, voice deadly calm. She hesitated, glancing over at Blaise, and then with great reluctance handed it over.
They lapsed back into awkward silence, all seemingly unsure what to do now, except for Pansy, who continued with her Charms homework like everything was perfectly normal. After a few minutes, the rest of them followed suit, Draco pulling out his Defence Against the Dark Arts essay while the three Gryffindors resumed what they’d been working on before Draco and Pansy had interrupted.
If Potter noticed Draco’s distraction, he was merciful enough not to comment on it.
Goyle sniggered as Blaise passed him the photo.
Potter shook his head. “Not really. I guess I was sort of turned off from it after the first time I came here.”
Kissing in the rain is one of my top five favorite romantic cliches.
At Pansy’s response, Draco looked up. She was chewing her lip and fiddling with the strap of her bookbag, staring off in the distance as if deep in thought. Draco’s eyes narrowed.
Despite everything, Draco loved it.
Granted, Draco hadn’t had much of an appetite for many months now, but at least tonight he could claim an easier excuse.
They were quiet as they walked. Although as eighth years they were allowed to visit the village whenever they wanted, it was the first time Draco had been since the term started. Thankfully, it wasn’t a Hogsmeade weekend for the younger students, which meant the town would be emptier than usual. Draco was still wary of too many people seeing them together, for both of their sakes.
Maybe Potter was just trying to move forward, and Draco was the one clinging to the past. Maybe it was okay for things with Potter to change; everything else in his life had, so why not this?
The crease between Potter’s brows deepened. “No, but…”
Still flushed from her crudeness, Draco muttered, “I hope you’re alright with a sexless marriage.”
“You won’t have to do anything.”
Pansy rolled her eyes as Madam Pomfrey disappeared back into her office. “That woman always assumes the worst of everyone. What does she think, we’re going to refuse to let you sleep or something?
“Oh, um,” Granger said. She clearly hadn’t even thought to ask him, though it would have been the logical thing to do considering they were all in the same Transfiguration class. He supposed he couldn’t really blame her for that, though. They weren’t exactly used to doing favours for each other. “That would be great. Thank you.”
“Draco, darling, please. We’ve snogged before, remember? I’ve known since we were fourteen.”
“What about my mother?”
Potter let him yank the books away without resistance.
Abruptly, the memories were gone. Draco stumbled a step back as if he had been shoved. He only had a second to feel disoriented before he was overcome with a renewed slew of memories, this time his own: he was fifteen, pressing a hand over Pansy’s mouth to silence her giggling as they stole firewhiskey from her parents’ liquor cabinet; he was alone on the Quidditch pitch, the sun just beginning to rise as he practiced; he was eight years old, tugging on his father’s sleeve to get his attention, only to be brushed off; he was standing frozen as screams echoed around him, his wand shaking in his hand, his vision blurred by fear—
Potter looked caught between a laugh and a frown, like he wasn’t sure if it was okay to find it funny or not. The result was a sad, conflicted sort of half-smile. After a second, more pointed glare from Granger, Weasley gave a murmured apology in Potter’s direction. Draco wasn’t sure why he was apologising to Potter of all people for making a joke about Snape, but Potter just waved it away.
At that moment, by some cosmic stroke of bad luck that Draco could only imagine was karma, Potter glanced at the shelves beside him, exactly where Draco was peering between the stacks. As quickly as he could, Draco ducked down, holding his breath to keep quiet. But even as he crouched on the floor, heart hammering in his ears, he felt certain that Potter had seen him. He glanced towards the table he had abandoned, wondering if it was too late to make a quiet dash back to his books and pretend that he hadn’t been eavesdropping when Potter and Weasley inevitably came to investigate. It was only a few yards away, maybe…
He was going to be sick, just as he was then. He was going to fall to his knees, crying and shaking, and still the screams wouldn’t stop, they wouldn’t stop…
Pansy's eyes were shrewd as she continued without answering his question, “People are saying he wasn’t interested in her anymore. That maybe he’s, you know…”
That sounded exactly like he did have a problem with it.
“Me? What about
“I was just trying to get out of the rain.” Potter glanced towards the street, watching the downpour. “We should’ve brought an umbrella.”
At this point, Slughorn launched into a longwinded recounting of all the prominent potioneers he had taught in his time, focused heavily on his own hand in all of their successes. Surreptitiously, Draco stole a glance in Potter’s direction. Potter had schooled his features into an expression that to the untrained observer might be interpreted as polite attention. But Draco knew better; the slight glaze over Potter’s eyes betrayed the fact that he had as little interest in Slughorn’s self-congratulatory anecdotes as Draco did.
“Why?”
“Fine, fine, I won’t,” she promised, waving off his threatening stare. “If you don’t hurry up, though, we’re going to miss dinner.”
“I don’t know.” Draco pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, trying to organize the chaos in his head. “I haven’t really hated him for a long time, I guess. I’m not so sure anymore that I ever did.”
“No, they’re free.” Granger gave them a tentative smile which Pansy returned with a bright smile of her own, immediately making herself comfortable on the sofa. Draco hesitated a moment longer before giving in and taking a seat in the armchair, settling his bookbag at his feet. Like this, he was situated directly across from Potter, simultaneously too close and much too far.
Professor Flitwick came bustling down the hall then, squeaking out an apology for his lateness as he ushered the students into the classroom. Draco took his usual seat in the back, which made it easier to ignore the pointed glances and carrying whispers of his classmates. Ignoring Potter, however, proved much more difficult; twice during the lesson, he caught the Gryffindor looking over his shoulder at him from across the room, not even seeming to care how many of their classmates noticed.
“I just think—”
“He seemed worried that I might upset your delicate sensibilities with my harassment,” Draco drawled, all too happy to fall back into their familiar rapport of insults and gibes. “I, however, had no such concerns.”
“Fine.” He had no idea how Potter knew that he was trained in Occlumency, but the Gryffindor must be vastly overestimating his own abilities if he imagined this idiotic tactic was going to work. Potter could try as hard as he wanted to force his way into Draco’s mind and prise out his thoughts; it didn’t matter. Draco had faced far worse opponents without breaking.
“It’s not working.”
Immediately after the question left his mouth, Potter flushed, as if he’d said something he shouldn’t have. He was right, of course, but Draco didn’t pause to wonder how Potter knew that.
Draco stayed silent. They both knew it was the truth, even if Potter refused to say it out loud.
The silence lasted a beat too long. Draco was the first to break it.
Potter shrugged. “I guess it’s a good thing I know better, then.” He was no longer smiling, but the assurance with which he spoke annoyed Draco just as much as when he had told McGonagall that Draco hadn’t intended to attack him.
“Is that Potions homework you’re working on, Potter?” Everyone seemed to tense when Pansy spoke. Draco gripped the arms of his chair, bracing himself for wherever this was going. The question sounded innocent enough, but knowing Pansy, Draco doubted it was just idle curiosity.
“I don’t know.” Draco pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, trying to organize the chaos in his head. “I haven’t really hated him for a long time, I guess. I’m not so sure anymore that I ever did.”
Potter continued to stir in slow clockwise circles, careful to keep the glass rod angled at exactly 90 degrees. It was the most neutral form of potion agitation, and the one Draco had always told him to default to when they tested new ingredients. Usually, Draco had to remind him at least twice to correct his angle or reduce his speed, but he was impressed to see that Potter needed no instruction today.
It had been three days now since he and Potter had spoken. They’d exchanged a few stiff “hellos” in the common room here and there when courtesy called for it, but never more than that. Draco wasn’t even entirely sure who was avoiding who at this point. He had been careful to keep his distance ever since Potter caught him eavesdropping in the library, even though Potter had pretended he hadn’t, but Draco knew that they couldn’t keep this up forever. Soon enough, Slughorn would expect a report on the progress they had made with their potion, and if Potter had no idea what was going on, it would be all too apparent that they were no longer working together. Then Draco would really be in trouble.
“Of course not,” Potter agreed. His eyes flickered over to meet Draco’s, and something in that look and the lowness of his voice made Draco shiver.
“Merlin, it smells terrible in here,” Potter muttered, eyeing a bizarrely shaped horn just above his head.
And Potter wouldn’t, not even now, not really, still waiting for the moment that Draco changed his mind.
Or would Potter make him beg for it?
He had nearly reached the top of the stairs when, with a sudden burst of speed, Potter cut him off, blocking him from reaching the Entrance Hall. Draco raised an eyebrow.
After a few minutes of struggling, Potter spoke up. “Let me help,” he offered, reaching out a hand to adjust Draco’s pillows.
“That’s enough now,” McGonagall silenced, although she was still smiling. “I trust that
Draco perched on the stool he’d pushed aside earlier, watching Potter rather than the cauldron. Thinking that Potter was good-looking, he’d already decided, did not mean anything. It wasn’t as if Draco was attracted to him; it was just an objective fact that he’d ignored for many years. He could set aside enough of their childhood animosity to admit that Potter was, by most measures, handsome. Frustrating and annoying and in need of a hairbrush, but handsome. And if Potter was going to spend so much time staring at Draco, as he had clearly resolved to do, it was only fair for Draco to look at him a little bit more often than usual as well. No big deal.
“No worries, my dear boy, no worries at all! Well, then, I won’t keep you any longer, you both should get to lunch before your next classes begin.”
Despite the dismissal, Draco didn’t move, too taken aback by the sheer preposterousness of Potter’s statement. “My
When he finished, Pansy rolled onto her side, propping her head up on her hand. “So this Potions thing is a big deal to you.” Draco nodded. “And Potter has agreed to do it.” Draco nodded again. “So then what’s the problem?”
In his dreams, deep in the safe, dark depths of unconsciousness, Draco’s anger twisted on his tongue until
There was a moment in which Pansy and Potter just looked at each other, indifferent to the other three watching them. Then Pansy gave a small nod, seemingly having made up her mind about something. “Good,” was her only response, the tension that had built in the air dissipating as she went back to reviewing her Charms notes.
For a second, Draco almost thought Potter was going to laugh. His lips quirked up at the corners, halfway to a grin before he seemed to catch himself and his expression quickly smoothed. Draco felt an inexplicable twinge of disappointment.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Draco’s voice was low. Though he was looking at Slughorn, the words were for Potter. “I’d never have been able to do it without you.”
“What are you looking at, Potter?” he spat, leaping at the chance to try and discover why the messy-haired idiot couldn’t seem to leave him alone. “Not got enough attention already? Hoping I’ll bow at your feet, like everyone else?” His voice rang out through the stone hallway, drawing everyone’s attention.

As soon as they were out of earshot of their classmates, Draco rounded on him.
It was hard not to roll his eyes. Did Finnigan really think it was news to Draco that everyone wanted him gone? He knew all too well where he stood with the students at this school – that much had been clear to him long before he returned.
Potter shook his head slightly, a small crease forming between his eyebrows. “Dead.”
Capitalizing on Potter’s momentary inattention and Slughorn’s wistful reminiscing, Draco took a moment to appraise the boy beside him. His dark hair was the same disaster as always, his eyes the same bright green. But Draco had never quite appreciated how clear and smooth his skin was, or how striking his cheekbones looked from this angle, as they were so often hidden by the round frames of his glass. And were his glasses new? They looked similar to the ones he had always worn, but seemed to fit his face better, somehow.
Draco would linger longest on those dark circles. By most measures, Potter was the picture of a well-adjusted survivor, always smiling at meals and busy chatting and laughing with his friends in the common room, all with an ease that Draco envied. But those dark circles told the truth behind the cheer – they were the one crack in the façade, the damning evidence that not all could be as rosy as it seemed in the Chosen One’s world.
“Well, it’s not exploding, so that’s a start.” Draco reached for an empty vial, filling it with a small quantity of the brown-coloured concoction. “Let’s test it.”
He cast a pointed glance towards the sole Hufflepuff in the class, Macmillan, whose empty cauldron and sheepish expression suggested he was the source of the awful orange smog. Slughorn gave him a small, patronising smile.
As always, I love hearing what you guys think of the story, comments always make my day!
Draco didn’t have to strain this time to hear Potter’s response. “It’s all of them!” He had never heard Potter snap at his friends like that. Seeming to remember where he was and the lurking threat of Madam Pince, Potter dropped his voice as he added, “Just… leave it, okay?”
He was still staring across the hall hoping that Potter might look his way when a sharp intake of breath from Pansy drew his attention once more.
It was very, very difficult to keep the sarcasm from his voice. “A few.”
, then he was going to have to tell Draco to his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter did not look at Draco once while giving his testimony. It was only after he had finished his wild story and gotten up to leave that he turned to face the person he had so ardently insisted was a victim, rather than a criminal. Potter’s eyes had never looked so vibrantly green as in that moment when he extended his hand, holding out Draco’s wand.
from his dresser and wrapping himself in his newly purpled covers, Draco settled in for a long, sleepless night. He wasn’t foolish enough to believe that merely changing the colour of a few fabrics would be enough to keep the nightmares away, but at least now he could stop thinking about that bloody green-eyed git.
Draco recoiled at the image. He realized, then, what Potter was doing: he had wanted Draco to see these memories, to force them upon him in a way Draco could not deny. But unluckily for Potter, Draco knew how to push back.
The confusion and uncertainty that had plagued him since their first kiss disappeared under Potter’s touch. Suddenly, it was all too simple to give in to the slide of their tongues and the firmness of Potter’s body beneath his hands. He wanted to map Potter’s shoulders, the planes of his chest, the muscles of his stomach. He wanted to kiss, to touch; he wanted more, wanted everything.
Draco ignored the rapt attention of his classmates as he went to the front of the room, leaving a couple metres of space between them as he turned to face Potter. His grip tightened around his wand, not yet raised. He had already begun the process of emptying his mind, tucking away all hint of emotion like one might store coins in a vault, carefully stacked and locked behind a heavy door where they would be impenetrable, safe. There was a comfort in Occlumency that he had always liked, a sense of control. He could sort out the images and ideas that cluttered his brain, clean up the messy feelings he’d left strewn about and place them all under lock and key, just for a while.
He didn’t know if Weasley had been the one to break it off or not, but judging by Potter’s face, he seemed to have struck a nerve. The Gryffindor’s cheeks reddened but, surprisingly, he didn’t look away, and the boldness in his gaze struck Draco with nearly as much force as his response.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” she cried, flinging herself at him in what Draco thought was a thoroughly overdramatic fashion. “You’re alright! Oh, I was so worried!”
“Nonsense! It’s not an exam, no need for perfection,” Professor Hayward chirped. “Would you like to help me give just a quick demonstration? It’s your choice, of course.”
He threw himself into his Arithmancy homework, which was always his most difficult and therefore the most effective source of distraction. And for a while, it worked. Lost amid complicated numerical charts, the thoughts inside his head — the ones that were cold and cruel, the ones that hissed the words
The honest answer, he realized, was no, he wouldn’t have. In a way, Pansy’s blithe acceptance of what had just moments ago felt like a life-shattering piece of information to Draco was oddly reassuring. If Pansy knew – had known all this time, even – and wasn’t bothered in the slightest, wasn’t even the least bit shaken, then maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t the end of the world as Draco knew it.
Chapter title taken from the song I listened to on repeat while writing this:
“She’s not going to care.” Pansy sounded so confident that Draco wasn’t sure he had any choice but to believe her. “She just wants you to be happy. I know it.”
“Then tell me, Potter,” Draco’s voice was hoarse, barely a whisper, “What do you want?”
“Sadly, I don’t think you’re her type.” It wasn’t his best retort, and he didn’t quite achieve the cool and mocking tone he was going for, but he least managed to keep from sounding breathless.
Weasley shared a glance with Potter. The redhead must have known that what he was about to say wasn’t going to go over well with Granger, because he reached out a preemptively placating hand as he began, “See, Hermione, the thing is—”
Potter made a noise of surprise but didn’t pull away, only hesitating a second before his hands were tugging Draco closer, one on his shoulder, the other on his hip. The kiss was not cautious or soft, nothing like the first time. It was bruising, a kind of desperation in the way that Draco’s mouth moved and in the way that Potter pushed back, a different kind of duel.
Draco’s head turned so sharply he felt his neck crack. His gaze roamed wildly for a moment, skimming over the tables of chattering students until it landed on the tousled black hair of the boy in question. Though he was all the way across the room and half-hidden behind the bushy-haired Granger girl and the redhead beside her, Draco knew Pansy was right. Potter was indeed staring at him, the unnatural green of his eyes apparent even from this distance.
This chapter ended up being a lot longer than anticipated, but hopefully it's worth it for all the lovely sexual tension!
Before Draco could ask the question ready on his tongue, they were interrupted by the arrival of Professor McGonagall. The Headmistress’s expression was stony as she strode through the doors of the Hospital Wing, although upon noticing that Draco was awake, the firm set of her lips seemed to soften slightly.
“Shouldn’t you be taking it easy for a while?” Potter asked, glancing at the only recently unpetrified side of Draco’s chest. Pansy snickered.
adults, and if I hear that you are behaving otherwise, the consequences will not be so lenient.” On that note, McGonagall bade them all a goodnight.
“Why not?” Pansy asked innocently. “You and Potter have been spending an awful lot of time together these days. I thought you’d want to sit with him, since you two are
Since their trip to Hogsmeade, they hadn’t really spoken about what they were doing, or what this was. Potter’s confession —
But the Muggleborn persisted. “Harry, you know we’re only trying to help…”
Draco felt an unpleasant tug in his stomach at that. He tried to ignore it, clinging onto the happiness of their success, but it persisted even after they left Slughorn’s office, promising to meet with him again in a week once he’d had time to review their potion more closely. Draco was quiet as they headed back to their common room, unable to stop his thoughts from spiralling, stuck on Slughorn’s comment.
, Draco wouldn’t ignore that. He watched Potter’s lips, red and slightly swollen from kissing, waiting for them to form the words that would put an end to all of this.
He grabbed a squat glass bottle off the shelf, holding it up briefly to examine the contents before placing it back where it had been wedged above a minuscule label reading
“Does it seem like it’s working?” Potter frowned at the potion. His hair really needed a trim, Draco thought; the dark locks kept falling into his eyes in a distracting way, and Draco itched to push them back from his face.
“When the curse hit you, it shattered three of your ribs and petrified the surrounding tissue,” Madam Pomfrey explained, gesturing at Draco’s bandaged chest. “I’ve given you a healthy dose of Skele-Gro, which seems to have done most of the work mending your ribs, but the petrified muscle will require a Mandrake draught. Professor Sprout and Professor Slughorn are working on it now, but you’ll likely be here for another day or so until it’s ready.”
A simple charm, but effective enough. Draco didn’t look long enough to see what other scars Potter might want to protect further down his body, although he could hear Potter murmuring the spell over a few different spots.
“It’s not—”
This is the longest chapter yet by far and I didn't entirely mean to write a 3k sex scene but uhhh I guess I got a bit carried away, hopefully no one minds!
“Er.” Potter blinked, looking caught off guard by this simple request. Granger’s frown deepened. Draco could practically feel her distress as she turned instead to her boyfriend, her voice now somewhat desperate.
Potter frowned. “People don’t think that.”
Potter’s eyes brightened. “How about tonight?”
“What do you mean?” Potter’s response was much quieter, and Draco found himself leaning over in his chair to try and hear. “Everything’s fine.”
exactly, but with that jawline I suppose it’s an easy mistake to make.”
“It’s true, isn’t it?” Draco clung to the cruel taunts like a drowning man reaching for a life raft in a storm, desperate to hold on to anything that would rescue him from the appalling desire he felt. “I thought the Weasel must be exaggerating, but you are obsessed, aren’t you? Still stalking me, just like you always have, trying to find out what terrible, evil things I must be up to. That’s why you want—”
The heat from the cauldron was beginning to feel suffocating. “You couldn’t have known that.”
Pansy gave a dramatic sniff. “No, all she can do is disinherit me.” To their mutual horror, Pansy’s lip began to quiver, looking for all the world like she was on the brink of tears as she stared morosely into her pumpkin juice.
The Gryffindor dried his wrist off using the edge of his shirt, apparently satisfied that the potion wasn’t imminently dangerous. “I just spent a lot of time with my godson this summer, is all.”
And the longer they stayed there, warmed by the glow of the fire as the night sky slowly darkened, the less Draco had to pretend.
“Malfoy?”
As her only child, she had always worried over Draco more than was perhaps necessary, but her fretting had reached new levels ever since Draco had told her he planned to return to Hogwarts. It was understandable, of course, but now that he was gone, he could only imagine how frayed her nerves must be, alone in the silence of that old house, still so heavy with nightmares. Draco wasn’t about to add to her anxiety, not over a few shattered ribs and some minor petrification.
The furious hammering stopped as the door flew open. “Bloody hell, Pans, keep it down, will you?” Draco griped as his best friend shoved past him into his room. “I wasn’t ignoring you. Just knock like a normal person next time.”
“You—” Whatever Potter had intended to say, Draco would never know. The words faded into a drawn-out groan as Draco leaned back in, flicking out his tongue to taste the wetness at the tip of Potter’s cock. He kept the motions shallow, licking and sucking at the head to give his throat a break before he wrapped his lips around him fully once more, surprised by how much he liked the weight of Potter on his tongue. He found a comfortable rhythm much more quickly this time, searching for the patterns that drew the greatest reactions from Potter. He wanted to hear him moan; wanted to feel him come.

He was starting to hate the phrase “take it easy,” but it seemed to appease Pansy.
“According to her account of the event, she saw you crossing the hall looking quite agitated, and was under the impression that you were on your way to attack Mr. Potter.”
He narrowed his eyes at the Gryffindor, wincing only a little as he pressed his hand against his aching ribs. “Why are you here, Potter?”
A weight that Draco had not even realized he was carrying seemed to lift. He had already resolved that his very fleeting desire to lean in and kiss Potter had been a moment of pure insanity brought on by the trauma of the attack and the effects of too much pain potion. But what was worse, Draco felt almost certain that Potter had never intended to kiss him in the first place, and somehow in his addled state of mind he had misconstrued a completely innocent situation. Which meant it was quite possible that Potter now thought—mistakenly, of course—that Draco
was – ran too deep.
Potter bit his lip, trailing his fingers over the rising water. For such a large tub, it was amazing how quickly it filled. Draco pulled the stopper out of the first vial, tipping it over the edge of the bath. The potion was so deep a grey that it was almost black, and the colour hardly seemed to dilute at all as it mixed with the water. By the time Draco had poured in the last bottle, the whole tub had darkened to a nearly opaque shade of charcoal.
“I, um.” Draco cleared his throat, subtly attempting to bunch the blankets up further around his waist. He would rather die right then and there than have Potter become aware of his current predicament. “I wanted to tell you to stop being such a
“Madam Pomfrey has assured me that you will make a full recovery.” The Headmistress gave him a tight smile. “And Ms. McKinnon will receive appropriate punishment.”
“Please.”
Draco spent the rest of lunch waiting just outside of the Great Hall, pacing as he tried to work out exactly what he wanted to say. He knew Potter had the next period free and Draco hoped to catch him alone for a moment before his own Advanced Arithmancy class. But when he finally spotted the familiar trio heading towards the stairs —
“Been eavesdropping, Potter?”
Potter nodded. The first match of the Quidditch season – Slytherin versus Gryffindor – was coming up in just a few weeks. Draco considered the question a moment, wondering why he felt so worried all of a sudden about saying the wrong thing, as if it mattered whether his answer was suitably clever or interesting.
— — —
A scantily clad MV Draco is leaning against the building across the street from them, smoking a cigarette while the loud thunder of a motorcycle grows nearer. It turns out to be MV Harry who slows to a stop in front of MV Draco. The engine is never turned off so Harry can’t hear the words exchanged, but he clearly sees a bag of Galleons exchanged that prompts Draco to climb on board behind him.
“So you’ll do me a little favour?” Draco followed up his request with that magic trick of his, kissing just the right spot on Harry’s neck, and he folded.
“Except that you can.” Draco’s voice was silky now as he stepped in closer to Harry, playful fingers tracing up the seam of his lime green robes.
“No.” Malfoy withdrew his fingers with a noisy squelch and a satisfied smile. Then scooped up the semen on Harry’s stomach and fit them back inside, moved them in and out until they both moaned.
MV Draco blows a lock of hair out of his face and smirks. “Long enough, Darling.” His free hand grabbed MV Harry’s arse with a casual air and Harry didn’t need to see any more.
Harry had a hunch something was off when he started eating lunch.
Draco glanced up and felt conflicted about being correct, for the first time in his life. Potter.
“Not yet,” he hissed, nodding politely at several Wizengamot members they passed on their way out of the canteen. Once they were in the empty hallway, Malfoy sped up his pace.
Biting his lip, Draco looked up to find Potter staring at him with an expression he couldn’t decipher. All he knew was it felt intense — enough to trigger his blush response.
“But I find it so hard to sleep…”
They turned another corner, and Malfoy pulled him in closer, waving off a curious passing witch with his usual no non-sense cue — Unspeakable Business — move along.
Finding some mercy, Draco abandoned the stimulation to his chest and dragged the length of the scarf down Harry’s torso, narrowly avoided his prick. Using the wool as a barrier, he fondled Harry’s bollocks and pressed on his perineum, smiling at the increase in response.
“Like someone’s trying to suck my soul out through my knob?” Harry asked between clenched teeth. It was getting stronger by the second and it wasn’t even pleasurable anymore. Like a build-up that would never plateau.
Harry may have been falling apart, but Malfoy was calm and unaffected. He didn’t so much as spare a glance at Harry, squirming in his grasp. “Weasley’s case, Potter. The black market potion dealers had an arsenal recovered at the crime scene, then some imbecile botched the chain of custody and a crate of evidence went missing. Including vials of the potion, someone slipped into your drink.”
before it hits them both at once.
Draco is gaining more fans by the week and when a new viewer drops a HollyWood80 sized tip on the cam site, they both take notice. Draco’s eyes widen and his smile turns coy.
Scorpius let out another sigh like the entire world was ending and scraped his foot across the carpet, then he frowned and stomped so the Muggle mechanism inside would light up properly. The two seconds of flashing blue light seemed to quell him enough for his devastation to recede into a mere pout. The pout was still deadly however when combined with hopeful blue puppy eyes as he turned his chubby face up to look at Draco. “Can you Accio?”
Before he can wonder how Draco pulled it off, two Seekers are zeroing in on the Snitch, flying right towards them. They’re going to crash onto the pitch and don’t seem to care if they take out civilians or not. “Draco, move, now!”
“You’re in luck, Potter. We share Professor Brousseau right now and Professor Devereaux after.” Folding the map neatly, Draco tucked it into his bag before leading the way down the corridor, the opposite path that Harry had come. “Once we’re in the classroom, I can teach you the Charm so you’ll be capable of reading it and listening to your lessons.”
Despite the four weeks of cabin fever, Draco and Potter didn’t kill each other.
“Rose, please stop telling people they’re late,” said a tiredly fond voice that was even more familiar.
“That’s absurd.” Almost a good enough reason to allow Draco to trample over Harry’s ‘no more sex at work’ rule.
A slow blink and Potter seemed to catch himself, clearing his throat and nodding, his smile friendly and bright when directed at Scorpius
He marched Harry into a cramped room stocked with dusty filing cabinets and closed the door behind them, not a moment too soon. Harry felt his knees buckle without warning, and it was only Malfoy’s iron grip on the collar of his shirt that kept him from face planting into the tiled floor. “Fuck!”
Before Harry could blink, all sticky slow from a pre-orgasmic haze, Draco plucked the prescription parchment from his loose fist and hobbled out of the room faster than should be humanly possible with a bum knee. His poor bollocks were still trying to empty as the full force of a ruined orgasm hit him like the Hogwarts Express. And all whimpering was drowned out by the noise of Draco cackling farther down the hall, and no doubt pleased with himself for getting exactly what he wanted.
“Scorpius, it’s your first day. You need to be focused on being friendly to the other kids instead of playing with toys by yourself.” Draco kissed Scorpius on the forehead, then he gently scooped him up. “I know you’ve been sad since Seokjin moved away, but his Mum had a special job here with Aurors. They could only stay a few months for her case.” Truth be told, He dearly missed their previous neighbours. Single parenting was easier with a support system nearby. Sighing, he levitated the Spider-Man backpack and sent it bobbing along behind them on the walk to the living room Floo. Draco barely remembered to hit the light switch on his way out. “But that doesn’t mean all your new friends are going to leave, okay?”
He was in a right state — like after a night of binge drinking with Ron and the lads, coupled with one of George’s ‘party favours’. Not any sort of experience one should have at the Ministry canteen, surrounded by one’s co-workers.
The Time-Turner spits them out onto Neville’s bed in the Gryffindor’s boy dorm room, where MV Draco and Ron are playing an intense game of chess. While wearing matching house ties. Sitting unbearably close together, MV Harry tenderly brushes a loose curl from MV Draco’s face and tucks it behind his ear. Then stares at him, looking absolutely besotted.
He was on the verge of losing his mind by the time Madam Pomfrey arrived with the restorative draught, and Pansy had to restrain him from snatching it right out of the matron’s hand in his impatience. As soon as the heavy weight in his left side began to lessen and he regained feeling in his arm, he was on his feet and reaching for his clothes, much to Madam Pomfrey’s distress. When she tried to insist that he stay just another few hours to ensure there were no lasting effects from the curse, Draco flat-out refused; he could not stomach another minute trapped in that hospital bed.
Molly still looked sceptical but Ron turned to glare daggers at her, this was about Harry's recovery and it didn't matter what way it was done as long as he got better.
"'Mione-" he began but was cut off by the reassuring squeeze of his friend's hand.
The door slid open again and Mathilde smiled as she led the way back in, followed by a grumpy looking blonde in sky blue robes and the entire room erupted as Ron and Molly both shouted protests, startling Rose who began to cry. Arthur merely watched with a frown on his face as though he were thinking hard on something. Harry barely reacted, his eyes searching those startlingly grey eyes for some sign of the man he once hated but the silver that stated back at him was unrecognisable, even if he could never forget who they belonged to.
"Harry, dear," Molly rushed to Ron's side and clutched at her son's shoulder as she leaned over him. "How are you feeling?"
"Mrs. Weasley," the nurse replied with gracious patience and Harry had to admit he was impressed by her, not many could stand up to Molly Weasley and remain polite and professional about it. "The detox is quite a precarious period, our formula was created in house to counteract the modified hardening potions that the extremists use in their attacks. Using a different combination of anaesthetics could do more harm than good, we do not have enough research completed to allow use on a patient. I'm sorry but you will have to sign the consent form to continue without pain potions."
"Of course," Harry nodded. "They have my permission to send Aurors here, I won't be able to leave to go to them for a while apparently."
"Yes we have and she will be flooing in from England any minute," Mathilde nodded and the man on the bed grumbled in his sleep as if calling for someone, his stung swollen arm shifted and his fingers brushed off Draco's robes which he immediately snatched away. She. Of course Potter would be happily married and beginning to breed at this point. It had been seven years since the battle after all.
"Good, see to it you explain the situation and she signs the necessary forms, I must return to the EW," Draco spoke stiffly and Mathilde raised a delicately arched eyebrow in that way that made Draco quite aware he would be getting the brunt of her Louisiana French temper later tonight. "Thank you, 'Tilde," he smiled, hoping to take the edge off her ire and she nodded in resignation but he knew it still wouldn't be the end as he strode out of the room.
The shouting stopped immediately and Molly Weasley stalked back into the room, followed closely by a quite beautiful nurse? Or was she a healer? The unfamiliar robe colours made Harry quite certain that he wasn't in St. Mungo's and as she raised her wand and spoke
"Actually, Draco," Mathilde mumbled, brushing some of the ash blonde strands off her face. "It appears Auror Potter is allergic to wartizome and any alternatives will counter the detox effects."
"Catoire," she smiled demurely at him. "I will be assisting the Healer in both your recovery and Mrs. Granger-Weasley's." A small beep on her robes alerted her to an incoming patronuntius. She opened the small compact and a silver ball hung over it, relaying a message privately and she closed it quietly, putting the device back in her pocket. "Speaking of, Mrs. Granger-Weasley is back in her room and the Healer has returned if you still wish to speak to him, Mrs. Weasley?"
"I think I shall," Molly decided firmly and Nurse Catoire nodded, twirling to exit the room and fetch the Healer. "Now you boys tell me exactly what happened."
Harry nodded, resigned to his fate of two weeks of molly codling from his surrogate family. It wasn't that he didn't expect it, he just still wasn't used to people making such a fuss over him. Even after fifteen years of it.
Molly was shaking and Ron had switched places with her to give her somewhere to sit. "Do you think you boys could stop attracting trouble wherever you go? I'd like to live to see my all grandchildren and not die of a heart attack, thank you."
Draco nodded as he pushed through the chaos of emergency Dark Arts Reversals, issuing of detox potions and counterspells before patients could be taken to be treated for their injuries. The hustle and bustle of the emergency was left behind as he pushed into the private ward, it was like being transported to another world. Muffilato charms were around the whole area and Draco could no longer hear what was going on but he followed the nurse towards a room that was supposedly empty... Or at least there was no name on the door to signify it being occupied. Sliding open the door, he saw a man on the bed in the middle of the room. Half his body was covered in the raised red swells of a stinging jinx that faded into the now increasingly more common karst cracked skin of exposure to a hardening potion. The potion had burned through the patient's clothes to reach the skin directly, a new feature to the bombs that Draco hadn't seen before. Draco immediately raised his wand to perform diagnostic spells to check for any other dark spells that may prevent treatment when he rounded the curtain and his eyes landed on the man's face and he stumbled.
"The American Aurors want to take your statement as soon as you're able," Ron finished off his story, speaking to Harry. "I've already given mine."
"Really, Molly," Harry reassured her. "I'll be fine, I have a very high pain threshold." Ron snorted,
Draco froze. It had been so long since he had seen anyone from his old life in England and even longer since he'd gone back to his home country. Although his former nemesis had never been extremely far from his thoughts, he hadn't really paid mind to the young man in months. He was happy here, with the life he'd built, his friends, his partner, he didn't need an old school rivalry to ruin that. Draco shook his head,
"Thank you, Nurse..." Harry began, realising he didn't know her name.
He took a shaky breath, not realising he'd stop breathing for a moment and set to work doing the usual diagnostic work. The nurse left the room, soon to be replaced by a tall, willowy woman in lemon nurse robes. "Healer Malfoy," she nodded professionally and levitated in the detox drip and replaced Potter's chart onto the end of his bed.
Harry sighed in relief and settled back onto his pillow. He didn't care about the rest, he could deal with a detox drip without pain killing potions, he'd suffered worse pains. One doesn't quickly forget being subjected to unforgivables, no matter how many decades pass.
The influx of patients from the Quidditch game had piled up the beds and nurses were hovering gurneys three at a time to make space on the floor for healers to treat patients. Draco looked around, taking in the obvious signs of the more and more frequent terrorist attacks of late. He rolled up his sleeves and dived into work, his knowledge of the attacks and the entire case drawing him into his position of control and guidance as he assessed patients and delivered instructions to his team of residents.
"I assure you, the pain will be quite manageable and we will lower the detox dose in accordance to your requirements. However, it will prolong the treatment period to about two weeks," she explained and handed over a clipboard and quill to Mrs. Weasley.
"Healer Malfoy," a red faced young nurse huffed as he stumbled threw the doors. And Draco turned on at the sound, a delicate eyes raised until he saw the condition of the nurse. He was already stalking towards the double doors of the private ward before the message had tumbled out of his mouth. "You're needed in the private ward immediately. It's one of the victims."
Harry was perfectly happy to let Ron take over the tale of the 2006 Quidditch World Cup and the interruption after the game was called as Extremists for the Preservation of Wizarding Society attacked the proceedings. The X-POWS attacked with their signature hardening potion bombs and guerrilla tactics of having planted assailants into the crowd before the game began. Unfortunately, it was something the British Aurors were used to as well so Harry and Ron quickly rose to action but it was when a potion bomb nearly exploded on Hermione that things began to go wrong. Harry stood in front of her to take the brunt of it but was simultaneously hit by three stunning spells and a stinging hex, effectively knocking him down for the count. Without him acting as a human shield, Hermione threw her protego around him to stop anything else hitting him and then was struck by two stunners herself. Ron only managed to levitate them both out of the way of the stampeding crowd when Mediwizards and Aurors turned up, rounding up as many of the terrorists as they could and port keying the injured civilians to hospitals across the Eastern seaboard.
, he thought to himself.
Harry blinked awake to the sound of a frantic woman yelling to speak with a Healer immediately. He tried to sit up but found he couldn't push himself up, he couldn't even feel the tight grip that apparently was clenched around his semi-swollen hand. Where was he? All he remembered was being with Ron and Hermione at the match and then... Of course, the attack. He moved his eyes to the person holding his hand, meeting familiar brown irises set into a freckled face. "Mum, he's awake!"
"Thank you Nurse Catoire," Draco smiled, amused at the woman's insistence on formalities while at work. Draco's diagnostic spells came back with nothing unusual beyond telling him that the man had been hit with three stunners alongside the stinging hex and appeared to have taken the brunt of a potion bomb. Draco wouldn't be surprised if Potter had used himself as a human shield for some poor helpless little lass. "There's nothing out of the ordinary, you can begin the detox drip and pain potions, Mathilde. The stinging hex will go down in a couple hours."
"...M'orry," the patient muttered and Mathilde returned to fussing over him, removing his shoes and pulling the blankets up over his immobilised body. She hoped he woke soon so they could take the enchantments off his body but, for now, they couldn't risk making his condition worse. "Sorry, Mal-" he cut himself off with a snort and Mathilde held her elegant hand to her lips to stop herself from laughing, blissfully unaware of the nightmare of blood soaking through a flooded bathroom floor in her patient's mind.
"She woke up half an hour ago, they're running some tests but she should get discharged today," Ron explained, the relief evident in his eyes. "She might not have made it without you, mate."
At that moment Arthur walked into the room, carrying the youngest Weasley and handed his granddaughter over to her father, Ron was perfectly happy to tend to his six month old over on the couch as Arthur reached Harry's bed. "I'm sorry to say the rest of the family aren't far behind me, Harry," he explained with a rueful smile. "Bill, Fleur and Percy are arranging accommodations for everyone and George, Ginny and Charlie are watching the children at home but they'll be flooing in this evening."
Mortified, (his) Draco clutches at his Time-Turner and yelps, “I do not!” However, barely two seconds pass before he turns around to look at his own derriere while tugging down his trousers, just far enough to check.
“I didn’t—” Harry lurched forward and banged his fist on the table, hunching over to protect his erection from all prying eyes. The canteen was no locker room, and Robards was two tables over. He was leaking into his sodding pants now, and Malfoy wanted him to stand? The fucking twat.
It’s so meaningless now.
That’s not true. I’m angry because my life has been stolen from me—
Draco and Harry both start coughing when they land face-first on the rug, inhaling lots of dust. This time they’re at Grimmauld Place, in the corner of a large sitting room where several Order members are having a meeting. Narcissa, Molly, and Kingsley are all speaking in shockingly polite tones while MV Harry and Draco are sitting on a loveseat, looking cosy. It can’t be too far out of the ordinary since they’re being ignored by Ron, Hermione, and Percy who are bickering about something else. MV Harry and Draco are failing to hide their grins while they play footsie in plain view of everyone else. It’s embarrassing.
Absolutely terrified.
You have some anger over the situation, sure, but it’s not the root of the problem.
MV Draco’s cold exterior melts away when he laughs at Harry’s antics, gently pushing him away as Harry grabs his book and tosses it on the floor. He whines about how he thought Ron would never leave and the fact that they can’t hide much longer. Draco rolls his eyes and grabs Harry’s tie to reel him in for a passionate snog.
That would be the feathers and beak, yes?
Harry felt like a bellend, watching this happen to him without realising it until afterwards. Like his entire world was bathed in molasses and all the time turners were broken, like time itself was just a theory and nothing mattered but the energy flowing through his veins. Warm reds and pinks and purples, like a setting sun that had all evening to sink into the Atlantic. Like a haze of smoke that settled all around him but never slipped inside his lungs, heaviness without the choking, no knee jerk reaction to snap him out of it.
Draco shakes his head and holds onto Harry as the Time-Turner spins again.
Despite his cock not having any attention paid to it yet, Harry looked close, his hair-trigger the same as it’s been all semester. Draco chuckled and spared some more pity. He wrapped the scarf around Harry’s cock and gave him four tight tugs, all that was needed to send him off, semen hitting his stomach and the wool. Draco whispered, “Harry.” However, that was drowned out by his boyfriend’s louder groan.
“I’ll see you again in ten days, Mrs Mulberry.”
“Not crucial enough. Lisa and Weasley are handling the murder by ritual case. I know for a fact, that you’re chasing a hippogriff egg smuggler. Significantly less important, Potter. Do be sure to dry your tears on something that isn’t your uniform. It’s wrinkled enough as it is.”
“It’s nice to see you aren’t completely thick in the head.”
Harry snorts to cover his own feelings and turns to look at (his) Draco, his pale cheeks now rosy with a blush that’s visible through a fine layer of dust. “Aw, did you and your mum leave the Death Eaters for me?” Nothing recovers his dignity quite like insults and cruel teasing.
I can smell it on you now, Malfoy. Among...other things.
And Malfoy’s eyes were still different colours. They were so… pretty. “
What? Potter wanted to—
When Ron sees the bags under Harry’s eyes the next day, he knows he’s in for another lecture. At least his Auror Partner allows him the luxury of settling in his desk with a cup of tea first.
It was a signal Harry usually found rude and pompous but was happy to see this time when it benefitted him.
Harry could almost confuse this teasing for flirting if Malfoy wouldn’t seem to be paying his new toy more attention than him.
Harry struggles to breathe as the wind is knocked out of him when he crash-lands on the cool grass. The problem isn’t helped when Draco immediately falls on his chest, his pointy chin banging into Harry’s shoulder. Draco’s body seems to relax into a state of dead, unconscious weight. Brilliant.
There isn’t any time to make a plan or run away. In the second it takes Harry to inhale, Malfoy has wrapped elegant, non-lube covered fingers around a sizable, dark green dildo — with a fat knot built into the base.
“Malfoy,” Harry says, “I need you to decode this file and find a way to brew a reverse potion for my case. I need an antidote.”
This was almost too easy.
But you won’t.
—You think my affliction is funny?
You’re being very combative.
A pout crossed Draco’s mouth, and then he stuck a hand down Harry’s pants. “If you insist.”
. “Potter, did you listen to a single announcement during breakfast? The hallways are warded to prevent any magic from being used. Supposedly it’s a safety issue, but we all know that’s a load of bollocks. They’re worried the students will start hexing each other after the war. Their plan for unity hasn’t gone quite as smoothly as they’d like.”
Meanwhile, his timetable for the new year consisted of a list of classes alphabetised by subject title instead of accompanying time stamps. Also, in French.
Before Harry can share the groundbreaking news out loud, Multiverse Draco and Harry burst into the hotel room, both dressed in Auror uniforms. They’re fighting over what sounds like a botched bust and suspects that got away. Bummer.
“Yes. Just follow the instructions on the parchment insert they’ll give you on the ground floor,“ Harry explained to the witch sitting on the patient bed in his office. “In about five days—“
I’m a guidance counsellor, not a Healer.
Draco flicked his wrist and kissed him deeply, his free hand trailing along Harry’s bicep and squeezing the muscles with pleasure. “Sorry, Harry, but you leave me no choice,” he chuckled darkly. “Ta.”
I have every right to be furious! My life has been ruined by this wretched curse. You have no idea what it’s like, you imbecile.
Harry stomps up to the side of Draco’s station and holds the file out, his demands crystal clear. “The case can’t wait. It’s crucial!”
(His) Draco chokes as Lee Jordan’s voice is heard announcing to the stadium that Draco Potter-Malfoy has won the first game their respective teams have played since they married last month in Scotland.
I’m still a Malfoy.
Then everything goes black.
Potter smiled wide enough for his eyes to crinkle at the corners and Draco felt his entire stomach drop out of his body. He was fucked.
“But this is a Muggle shop.” Not what Harry should be latching onto, but his brain is spinning in useless circles. Malfoy is wearing a very thin t-shirt and his perky nipples are visible.
Harry swallows back the drool he can feel building up on the back of his tongue and jogs to catch up. “Does coffee in another universe count as ‘dinner’?”
What a beautiful mess he made, but Harry knew the rules. If he dirtied any of Draco’s things, he had to clean it up.
I am not—
(His) Draco sounds breathless beside Harry. “I look magnificent.”
Malfoy might be alright now, but he was still a prick.
from having an effect on the wood, the doorknob, even the tarnished gold hinges.
“Shut up, Potter.” Draco yanks harshly on Harry’s robes and sends them off again.
be seen. I don’t know what happened to bring us here, but we’re going to stay for a while.”
And he does. Draco preens for the camera and blows a cute kiss to the lens. “Thank you, HollyWood80. I always appreciate your generosity,” he says with a wink. “I know I usually do private video chats afterwards, but I’ve had a very long day.” Draco pauses and looks imploringly at his audience, not breaking his act even when the tips started to pour into his screen out of desperation for him to stay. “I’m afraid I can’t stay, but I’ll miss you profoundly.” His lips twitch into a small smile as the money continues to stream in with fanfare. “Next time, I’m going to private chat for three hours,” he promises. “Sold as individual slots, of course. I can’t let you gentlemen lose out to HollyWood80 every time,” Draco teases, playing with his own nipples.
Malfoy tilts his head and scrutinised Harry like the way he does when reading rapid fire comments in the chat-box during public shows. “Most wizards are when they spend their time shopping in this particular aisle,” he says with a casual gesture to the incriminating items surrounding them.
Harry blushes and rubs his nose, scooting away from Draco a little bit and hunching over. “You look naked.”
“We were out of the country during registration day, but I am aware that class ends at three. I’ll be here on time, don’t worry, Potter.” Draco said, his drawl slow and skirting the edge of condescending.

“You’re a pervert, Potter,” Draco insists, grabbing Harry by the collar and choking him as he sends the Time-Turner spinning with vigour.
“Healer Potter!” Draco shouted as the door to Harry’s clinic room flew open and hit the wall with a thump, his usually precise spell work trending towards overzealous when the dramatics worked in his favour. Like needlessly scaring innocent souls seeking treatment at St Mungo’s.
Draco snorted. “I just won a professional game of Quidditch. I want to see this.”
“I suppose if you need to be so crass.” To add to the humiliation, Malfoy cast a Cushioning Charm on the floor, then sat down beside Harry. “I’m afraid you need to work through this as quickly as possible to end your suffering.” He showed the first bit of compassion all day, gentling his tone and squeezing the back of Harry’s neck in a way that felt just right. The supple leather gloves felt like butter on his skin. “Come on, out of your pants.”
It was just Draco’s luck that by the time he and Potter enjoyed playing house, Professor Flitwick was able to break the Charm of sentient castle magic that kept them locked up inside.
Harry removed his glasses and pinched his nose in an effort to stave off a headache. “Draco.”
Perhaps not all was lost.
Harry doesn’t give Draco a chance to fully wake up, he simply wraps his body around Draco and rolls them both over so they’re out of the way as the first Seeker crashes into the turf where they have just been, with the other team’s Seeker sliding off his broom to land on top in a heap. The blond Seeker from the Falcons raises his fist triumphantly from under his opponent. The crowd goes wild once everyone realises he’s caught the Snitch.
Draco’s breathing is heavier than it was, and this time he’s brave enough to make eye contact while he sets the collar of Harry’s robe to sorts. “We really need to go down to the basement lab and go through the process of a decontamination shower,” Draco says, his voice almost scratchy.
Maybe your father should hear about this.
“Draco… Draco,” Harry panted under his breath with his balled fists pressed harshly onto the sides of his hips.
“Wait, no. What?” Potter’s grip slid down to Draco’s wrist and squeezed briefly. “Who said Scorpius was an issue?”
“Mr Potter,” Draco spoke up rudely, but necessary. “This is my son, Scorpius Black. He’ll be one of your students this year.”
There was a long moment of silence, broken only by the scratching of Draco’s quill, and then…
“Go on, I’ll see you in the Great Hall,” he told them, looking far less concerned than Draco felt.
“Because I’m a good friend,” she answered with a shrug, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “What was I supposed to do, inform you of your own sexuality? I wanted to let you have, you know, a nice coming out moment or whatever. I wasn’t about to force you into something you weren’t ready for.”
“I didn’t know.”
But no, that wasn’t right. He took a shallow breath. The room was dark, familiar, silent. This wasn’t the manor. There was no one sobbing, no one begging for mercy. He could hear Goyle snoring, just to his left. He was at Hogwarts, in his dormitory. The war was over. He was safe.
The rain continued through the night. It was still drumming against the windows when Draco awoke with his heart racing, not knowing where he was. The room was dark, familiar, ringing with screams. The sound was like a knife to his lungs, piercing them and stealing his oxygen. His stomach twisted, a feeling that went beyond nausea, a kind of sickness deep in his bones. The screams were growing louder and louder and he couldn’t breathe, everything around him like broken glass, high-pitched and jagged.
“What are you adding now?”
“Malfoy.” Draco had never liked the sound of his own name so much. But Potter’s fingers were more deliberate now, trying to guide him back. “Malfoy, I’m—I’m going to come.”
The variables were seemingly infinite. Their time, however, was not. Their submission was due by the first of December, allowing sufficient time for the entries to be reviewed before the finalists were selected for publication in
All three Gryffindors looked around in surprise, almost as if they had forgotten he and Pansy were there. Weasley was staring at him with his mouth slightly agape, which Draco thought was a bit dramatic. It wasn’t as if he’d offered her his kidney or anything.
