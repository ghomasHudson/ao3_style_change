“Potter,” Draco began slowly as if talking to a child. “Those robes were
Potter blinked. “That’s actually right.”
“Draco?” His mother’s call rang through the halls and Draco called back to her.
Ginny went back inside for a moment and returned with a large wall clock in her hands. She placed it on Draco’s lap and he stared at in awe, tracing a finger delicately along its surface. “It’s brilliant,” he whispered as a pleasant thrum of magic emanated from it, and he took in the many hands. Ginny’s and her parents’ pointed at ‘Home’ and her brothers were at ‘Work’ or ‘Travelling’. Except not all of them, he suddenly realized with a sick lurch, his eyes landing on the hand that pointed to ‘Lost’. Fred Weasley’s picture was darkened and unmoving, his face frozen in a roguish smile. While the other hands seemed to quiver with spirit, this one was still.
“If you think this is rude, then you don’t know me very well.” Draco shot back, suddenly realizing that he and Potter were actually having a civilised conversation! Would wonders never cease?
He stumbled out of bed and made his way to the Floo. He couldn’t do this anymore; he needed a way out. The clock read half past eleven and he scowled. Blaise and Pansy were probably in some state of undress at this hour but he
“Hagrid warned us to be respectful around them and not to do anything to insult or anger them.” Draco continued. “But see, I was peeved at all the attention Potter was getting and thought that if he could do it, why couldn’t I? So I walked up to the beast and made the grave mistake of calling it a ‘great ugly brute’. It didn’t take it too well.”
As he’d eaten, Mrs Weasley had puttered about the kitchen chattering away about Merlin knew what. He thought she’d said something about radishes? But he wasn’t too sure, having been too busy trying not to groan in pleasure after each spoonful of stew. It had been divine. He’d been finishing up when the children trooped in. They’d disappeared for a while but eventually they had come back, this time including Teddy and the Potters. Introductions had been made and then somehow he’d been roped into babysitting and shooed to the childrens’ playroom.
“Keep it down, you utter berk,” Pansy hissed, glancing behind her. “Do you want to inform the entire household?”
When they finally did address the past, Potter apologised for the scars that still marred Draco’s torso, green eyes sad and hands visibly shaking. In return, he’d accepted Draco’s own apologies with a nod and a gentle smile. They finally spoke about the War and the horrors they’d each seen; of how they both still had nightmares and couldn’t sleep unless their wands were securely under their pillows. Draco told him about life growing up with Lucius as a father, always expecting too much and appreciating too little; how even now, he still loved the man in some warped way whilst simultaneously hating him like he hated no one else. Potter reciprocated with tales of his childhood and Draco had listened, disgusted by his Muggle relatives and ashamed at himself for ever making fun of Potter for things that were a result of them.
Harry placed a chaste kiss on his lips. “I haven’t had a moment alone with you all day.”
get some action?”
Suddenly it was too unbearable. Draco had been a fool to think that he could ever have that. Harry may have been attracted to him but once they’d scratched that itch, would he even want him anymore? Draco couldn’t replace Ginny Weasley. He couldn’t even try to fill her place in the children’s lives. What did Harry want him around for when he had her? She was obviously a wonderful mother, attentive, loving, playful. Watching them as he was, he felt like a complete outsider. He had no place here. He had no right to even be witnessing this little tableau. He felt like an intruder and all he wanted to do now was leave.
“I’m still completely clueless here Potter, but whatever.”
“What is
Only the Golden Trio remained, the others having left earlier with the excuse that they all had work the next day and therefore had to rise early. Weasley approached him with Granger now, but Potter seemed to have disappeared.
Draco didn’t trust himself to answer and hurried out before Bob could ask him to stay for tea or something. Potter followed him, his amusement having subsided to weak giggles now, and Draco glared at him. People on the street were giving them curious looks and Draco thought it served Potter right if he ended up on the cover of the Prophet looking on the verge of an epileptic fit.
“If I’d known you were coming, I wouldn’t have taken a nap.” Potter rubbed at his eyes and yawned a little. “Hermione and Ron went out to run some errands and never returned, so I figure they’re having an impromptu date.”
Potter gave a sudden snort of laughter. “Merlin Malfoy, could you be any ruder?”
was the one who had been waylaid in the middle of a busy street for some inane conversation that was leading them nowhere.
Draco’s words hit Harry like a tonne of bricks. He’d never thought of it like that before. Even after all these years, Harry still chokes up at the thought of that day; Myrtle’s screams echoing through the room, the blood in the water, the metallic smell in the air, Draco’s deadly pale face… The first time he’d seen the scars, Harry had almost had a panic attack, and he feels like hexing himself for being so thoughtless. How could he have possibly thought this was a good idea?
“What the
Narcissa’s glare softened and a tired expression took its place. “I’ve had a fair share of spells shot at me but I quite pride myself on my Shield Charm and do not know what they would have done had they actually hit me.”
Potter shrugged nonchalantly. “Nothing much, just that we could have very well ended up rooming together back in first year.”
Teddy beamed. “You knew my mum too.” he said surprisingly. “Gran says you were cousins which makes us cousins too! I’ve never had a cousin before.”
He and his mother stayed for dinner, which his aunt ordered from a Muggle restaurant nearby. Draco had eaten curry before when he’d been in India, but it was his mother’s first time having it. She instantly loved it and Draco had a feeling the house elves would soon be learning how to make it.
Eventually he finishes with the lawn, and quickly puts the mower away in its shed, already mentally cataloguing everything he’ll need to make the stew. He’s walking back towards the house when suddenly he’s stopped by a voice.
Draco leant back on his palms and closed his eyes. He could hear the adults laughing about something and it warmed him to know that his mother was having a good time. Arthur Weasley had been as gracious and welcoming as his wife, and it was almost strange to remember the intense animosity he and Lucius had shared. It truly was a testament of Arthur’s good character that he was willing to overlook the unsavoury history between the Malfoys and Weasleys with such cordiality.
Draco winced. “Out with it, Weasley. Let’s hear it.”
Potter grinned. “I’ll take your word for it. Anyways, tell me why Zabini isn’t allowed in Spain and what does it have to do with the Minister?”
“Draco, are you alright?” Harry was suddenly in front of him, his eyes filled with concern.
“It was in the bloody papers, for fuck’s sake!” Ginny exclaimed. “Our breakup was splashed across the papers for a full month before we managed to get them to stop.”
“Something like that,” his older brother replied neutrally, which did nothing to settle Draco’s nerves. He gulped as he looked up at the tall Curse-Breaker and a wave of panic hit him when Percy unwittingly wandered away and left them alone. Arthur was conversing with his wife near the back porch and Ginny was nowhere to be seen.
“Don’t shoot, I’m unarmed!” Ginevra cried, holding up her hands in surrender.
A light weight landed on his chest and Mercury gave a soft hoot which Draco knew to mean ‘
“I don’t think you’ve any broken ribs or fractures,” Molly finally said when she was done with her examination. “You’ve hit your head, though, and I’ll want to see to that. Come along, I have some healing paste that we can rub on to take the soreness and bruising away.”
“Prat.”
Draco has slumped against the side of the fireplace and the thump Harry had heard was probably him sliding down to the floor. His knees have been drawn up to his chest and the position makes him look
This time Draco did jump, whirling around with his wand aloft as Pansy shrieked and Blaise fell off the bed onto his face. Ginny marched in like a general leading her charge into battle, followed close behind by an equally determined-looking Granger, one exasperated Weasley, and last but certainly not least, Potter. If their arrival wasn’t already astonishing enough, there were yards of rope wound tightly around Potter’s body and he was being levitated in by Granger.
“Good girl.” Potter really did look much better when he smiled. Not that Draco cared if he smiled or not of course! It was a simple observation.
Draco did sit up, but not because he believed the mirage. “Ah, but that’s exactly what a hallucination would say,” he reasoned smugly.
“You can go to bed, Mother,” he said softly, keeping his voice low as to not disturb the quiet tranquillity of the gardens around them. “I’ll come in after a bit.”
“Er, Malfoy… you could come too if you want,” Weasley offered haltingly and Draco smiled humourlessly, his hackles rising at the unwelcome display of pity.
to go see him looking like that,” Granger said with a speculating look.
“Mind your own fucking business, Potter,” he snarled, horrified to find that he was choking up a little. He refused to cry over a wand of all things, and certainly not in front of
He wasn’t sure how long he lay there, staring unseeingly at the ceiling. It could have been a few minutes or an hour for all he knew, but he was eventually jerked out of his purposeless vigil when his door slammed open louder than it had ever been slammed before – and that door had already been slammed
A few minutes later, he returned with the dark-skinned ex-Chaser in tow.
Weasley stared at him incredulously. “Has anyone ever told you, you’re a bit of a nutter?”
His business with Potter done now, Bob finally turned his attention back onto Draco, but when he caught sight of the cage with the tiny owl in it, he froze and stared at in unblinkingly. Draco shot Potter a questioning look but he only shrugged before making a discreet gesture that expressed his opinion that the shopkeeper was not all there. Bob looked up with an expression of worship and much to Draco’s unease, his eyes were brimming with tears.
Still, Draco felt panic building up inside him. What if he hadn’t managed to turn his head in time? If the kiss had landed its mark, there was no way he would have been able to resist Potter, and it made Draco hate himself all the more – that he could so easily throw all his principles away just like that.
“They look delicious.”
“Funny Dada!” Lily squealed, splashing the water for emphasis.
he is an expert in all things Muggle, but his know-how really only consists of operating the television and using the coffee machine. Harry hasn’t even taken him to a Muggle restaurant or supermarket yet, wanting him to first be properly Muggle-trained. This outing has been a first.
“I’m single,” Draco interrupted in a rush, defensiveness creeping into his confession as he added, “It’s not really easy to meet someone when I never go out. Makes it even less easy when I have a bloody Mark on my arm.”
“It’s a weekday afternoon so it isn’t crowded.” Potter explained. “I never take the kids during rush hour because Merlin knows, with this lot I’m bound to lose one in the crowd.” He sent a fond look over at the children. “They’re a handful, but they’re
“Yeah. Ron thinks that she’s taking them to visit George, but she’s actually buying a wedding anniversary gift for him. She’s trying to top what he got for her last year.
“I see,” Mrs Weasley murmured, sharing a look with her daughter. “We really should tell Kingsley about all this. We’ve already gone to war once because of prejudice and division amongst ourselves; we can’t allow it to happen again. Haven’t you reported any of these attacks?”
“Oh, Percy’s fine,” he replied breezily, and now Draco was seriously wondering if he was talking to some sort of imposter. Percy reached up to scratch at his neck and his collar gaped for a moment. Draco’s eyes widened.
are you doing this to yourself?”
“Don’t
His mother turned to him. “Did you try one?” she asked eagerly, wringing her hands together. Draco obligingly took a cookie off the top of the pile and broke off a piece. He popped it into his mouth and instantly sighed in pleasure.
“Oh, har har, very funny.” Draco shot her a quelling look. “Joke all you want but I’m sure you of all people know that if any of your brothers were home, I’d likely not leave here with all my body parts intact. Weasel especially would go for blood, no questions asked.”
Draco smirked to himself. So predictable.
Draco sniffed. “It might surprise you to hear this, but not all of us want to bask off the power of your name.”
“I assure you he may have favoured us in class, but when it came to marking he was probably more exacting on those of his own House than anyone else. He expected us to represent Slytherin House at all times after all.” Potter looked even more dumbfounded by this.
Things come to a head when the lights suddenly turn off, and they are plunged into darkness. Draco lets out a bloodcurdling shriek and Harry yelps as his nails dig into his arm so hard, he thinks the skin might have broken.
Potter threw a cushion at him for that.
?” Blaise growled as he flopped down in front of the fire. “This had better be good.”
“What, no. I mean, she was crying so…”
“Bloody hell Mother, for all you knew I could have been naked under here!” Draco yelled, struggling to pull the sheets back.
late.” Draco found himself saying before he could stop himself.
“I see.” said Draco absently. “Wait, what?” He turned to her with wide eyes. “Mother was invited too?”
“Aww Draco, it was awesome. Can’t you just admit it?” Teddy joined in.
“Okay, I did not mean it like that,” Potter protested slowly, blinking in confusion. “Of course I know I’m lucky to have Ginny. The fact that she’s stuck by me despite everything… well, not many would.”
“What, did you think that my new friend stopped at kissing? I told you, he was a
It was late when they finally said their goodbyes and Teddy had long since fallen asleep on the couch. Draco helped carry him to his room and ended up tucking the boy in alongside his aunt. Then he side-alonged his mother back to the Manor. They had hardly been there five seconds before his mother pounced.
He supposed that all things considered, he could have done far worse in the way of owls. He wouldn’t have intentionally selected such a small one, but at least it appeared to be smart and hadn’t cost him a Knut. And if it got his mother off his back for a while, well then, all the better.
“Fine fine, I’m a complete arse. I should have come back ages ago. In fact I shouldn’t have left in the first place. I made my mother miserable. I abandoned you when you’ve always stuck with me. I, Draco Lucius Malfoy am sorry.” He bowed his head to emphasize his point, only lifting it when he heard a giggle.
There was a commotion in the hallway and suddenly the room was teeming with Mediwizards. Draco flattened himself against the wall, trying to make himself as unobtrusive as possible and watched as they quickly took over the spellcasting and eased Potter on to a magical stretcher. They took him out the door and Aunt Dromeda followed worriedly, deep in discussion with one of the Mediwizards. A lone witch remained and she hunched over the book, muttering feverishly – most probably a Curse-Breaker at work.
Granger shrugged unremorsefully. “I’m not feeling very benevolent right now with Harry upset. He misses you.”
Harry followed his gaze and gave his hand a light squeeze. “I still remember that moment when we got home after our honeymoon,” he said, voice faintly teasing as Draco tried his utmost not to blush and then failed spectacularly. He remembered that moment all too well.
“Anyways,” Potter continued brightly, quite obviously changing the subject. “Tell us what you did today at the shop.”
“Potter, touch my arse again and you’ll have a fucking broomstick shoved up yours!”
Draco sighed, moving to flop onto his bed and waving for them to join him. He didn’t know how to explain it; the conflict inside him that refused to be resolved or dispelled.
Draco found himself staring into green eyes that were much closer than he’d initially expected. He took an involuntary step back.
“Well, ouch,” he said dumbly as he tenderly rubbed his bruised arm.
Weasley snorted.
he was truly enjoying himself.
“Wow, when I’m in a bad mood, Ron tends to avoid me and Hermione keeps pestering me to talk about it until I either run away or tell her off.”
“I’m going to have a bloody bruise from all that rough-handling, you cretin.”
Draco blinked. “Oh…er, it’s good to see you too, Granger.” He grasped her hand and gave it a quick shake before dropping it.
Potter promptly dozed off soon after, overseeing duties completely forgotten, but Draco didn’t mind too much. The silence of the room was only broken by the occasional snore or snuffle from Potter, and it was a soothing backdrop for Draco to work to. He could feel himself drifting into a comfortable rhythm and wasn’t pleased when Kreacher suddenly popped into the room and disturbed the peace. Potter jerked half-awake at the loud
Granger shook her head with a small smile. “No, but thank you for the offer.” She sat down primly in the same armchair she’d sat in the last time she’d visited.
“Just a chat, actually,” Draco admitted sheepishly. “I had a rather odd day. Hold up, cut the Floo and I’ll call you. It’s probably difficult for both of you to use the Floo at the same time.”
Draco smiled weakly. “Joy.”
Potter kissed like he fought; with reckless abandon and pure intent. He moved an arm to wrap firmly around Draco’s waist as the other gripped his jaw, and Draco whimpered softly as the kiss quickly gained heat. Potter was just as good a kisser as he was at pretty much everything he did, and it wasn’t long before Draco was kissing back, clumsily trying to catch up to Potter as he sailed ahead confidently.
“Nonsense,” she interrupted sharply, and then turned to a startled Potter. “My son accepts your proposition.”
“She had a few scrapes and bruises.” he offered, wondering why his throat suddenly felt dry. “Nothing serious though, and I healed them up.”
“I’ll just take him off to bed then. Sleep well, Malfoy.”
“You can’t do that!” Draco protested loudly, shocked at the loathing in Potter’s voice. “That tapestry dates back to the 13
“You came after me which makes you late.” Draco had no idea what he was saying anymore. His mouth seemed to be doing a Longbottom impression.
Draco looked down at the smooth elm wand in his hand. “Yes, well this is Mother’s wand. I figured it might be best to have a wand that actually responds well to me at all times.”
“I need to put on my pants.”
“I think we both gave each other grief.” Potter spoke up in a quiet voice, and the silence that followed spoke of things left unsaid. Bathrooms and unknown spells.
“I guess so.” Weasley stared glumly at his sandwich before taking another bite. “I need something to take my mind off things. Let me sort out the books since Malfoy’s done for the day. There’s not a lot left, is there?”
“So Al, what would you like to play on?”
“Yeah, George let me off early and then I went to place the cake order.”
“Please…come… in…” he wheezed.
“It’s bloody difficult to shop for him though,” she added with a groan.
“Fine!”
“Ah.” Honestly, he wasn’t all that shocked by it all. “Where are they now? Please tell me they aren’t waiting somewhere out of my line of vision until you get back to them.”
Pansy laughed. “I don’t know whether to be offended or gratified by your regard for my level of debauchery. There was no Polyjuice involved; we simply made the acquaintance of a pair of delectable twins. One happened to swing my way while the other swung Blaise’s.”
He turned to her now and found her with a small frown gracing her face. “I
The little girl gave a sniff but nodded her head. “Good. Then I promise to come visit you as soon as I can.” Behind his back, Draco crossed his fingers, knowing that it was juvenile but he really did feel guilty as he saw the little faces light up at the idea of him visiting. So he’d stooped so low that he was lying to toddlers now.
“May I know your name?”
At this point Draco thought it best to get to his feet. He moved Hugo to his shoulders and stood, Lily still nestled against him. The Weasley brood stared at him and truth be told, it was rather terrifying. Just when he thought the room couldn’t get more oppressing though, Harry stalked in.
“So…” Potter finally spoke. “What do we do now?”
” He stared at Draco as if he couldn’t believe his eyes.
“I’ll just have to best her in Halloween décor,” Draco declares after a few more minutes of pouting. “Start cleaning, Harry. I want to start carving as soon as possible.”
“You were so happy,” Harry continued with a bemused shake of the head. “When you caught sight of the change in our names and the new branch, you stared with this look of complete awe.” Draco’s breath hitched as Harry leant to speak directly into his ear. “You were stunning in that moment and it made me realise just how lucky I was, having you in my life. To be able to call you
Draco didn’t say anything but stared at her mutinously. Her gaze softened a bit.
“But really,” Pansy continued, her eyes glittering dangerously. “I mostly want to throttle you for being the biggest idiot in the history of idiocy.”
“All done Draco.” Dominique announced in satisfaction after they’d completely cleared the floor of all the toys. The paint still remained though so Draco pulled out his wand, removing it from the walls and the children.
pretty good at it after all. Now that the Dark magic was gone, the suffocating pressure was gone as well, and Draco could breathe easier now. He pulled his wand out and prepared to cast the counterspells to get into the room, but Potter stopped him.
Draco took a fortifying breath. “Let’s do this.”
Narcissa Malfoy had always held her head high in the face of adversary but right now she looked like a frightened school girl being sent to the Headmaster for the first time, staring up the walk way to the house with wide blue eyes.
The boy began to bawl.
Weasley grinned. “Hermione’s influence.”
He received another calm stare.
Weasley laughed, though not unkindly. “I’m not going to say anything, Malfoy. Not really my business, now is it?”
“So you’re telling me that you were completely justified when you pulled off your little stunt, then snatched the robes from his hands and dashed to have them fitted in the back for Ginny, before finally buying them and dragging us out of there while Smith still lay groaning on the floor?” Potter said in one breath, looking like he could hardly believe his own words.
“I think you’re doing a pretty good job of it.” Draco said truthfully. “Teddy obviously loves you.”
“Does no one remember the concept of
“Dear Merlin, can you even hear yourself Cissy? They aren’t children anymore and I think Draco is perfectly capable of choosing his friends wisely.” She took the newspaper out of her clenched fist and smoothed it out. “Don’t they look like they’re having a wonderful, if not rather undignified time?”
friends. Best friends, in fact, and it was just a bit of friendly experimentation. Now stop interrupting or I won’t give you the dirty details.”
“Turns out, you’re actually really soft, Mal-mafloy.” He stroked a hand down one of Draco’s cheeks. “Ron, you gotta feel this! It’s like– like a kneazle kitten without the fur.”
“I thought… maybe I could do something about the Black tapestry. As gratitude for returning my wand.” This was what he’d told himself before when the idea had first hit him, but he knew it was really a selfish excuse to prolong his time with Potter. If things still ended up pear-shaped, Draco would at least have enough memories to get him through the storm.
Draco wanted to tell Potter that the best course of action would be to continue from where they’d left off in the kitchen. He wanted to walk up to the man and kiss him again, knowing that there was nothing holding them back. He wanted to ask Potter if they could go out for dinner some time. He dearly wanted to return to the party hand in hand, showing everyone that Potter was his now.
“…and made that shelf fall on his head!”
Draco groaned as he shuffled out of bed, dismissing the elf with a wave of his hand.
“Molly and Cissa get on better than you would imagine.” Luna told him with a smile. “I’m glad. Molly’s always been so kind to me and I’ve always wanted her to see Cissa for how she really is.”
be a typical Slytherin afternoon by the Lake.”
“I thought you might like to have your meal out here, dearies,” Molly said with a beaming smile.
of treats in fact.
“And now?” Draco asked in a whisper.
?” Now Potter looked a bit too pleased with himself for Draco’s liking. Very well then, two could play at this game.
to write, and then I end up doing something else and forgetting.”
“Mother, you’re able to hold it in the palms of your hands. Do you honestly think an owl of that size could serve a purpose?”
“He heard that.”
“I would never cut you off Luna.” he said gently. “Not you.”
“Hard to get that out was it, Potter?” Draco quipped with a smirk. “Well it’s not really a shock that she likes me so much. After all, I
Potter shrugged. “Suit yourself.”
Draco’s eyes shot open and he shoved Potter away with enough force to send him falling on his arse.
“I finished it already. A pleasant read but not one of her bests.”
He barely resisted the urge to stick his tongue out at the other Seeker; let him stare all he wanted if it meant he wasn’t paying attention to the game. The boy hero was most likely watching to see if he did anything nefarious. Perhaps he thought Draco would whip out his wand and start AK-ing off the rest of the players. Suspicious prat.
“Hey, I was just making small talk.”
It was a Potter-Malfoy tradition of sorts for the family to sit down at the end of each school year and discuss the events that occurred. They’d been doing it from James’ first year and it looked like it would continue on until Lily graduated. The children were all keen letter writers – James surprisingly being the most attentive, sometimes sending them in the space of a few days, but Draco personally loved these little family bonding times. Sometimes he could hardly believe that this near perfect life was actually his and just sitting together with them, talking about menial things like House points and detentions, helped to make it feel
“I’m just going to say what everybody else is thinking,” Granger began once the teams were made. “Bill’s teams has a handicap and her name is Hermione Jean Granger.” She raised a hand to silence the indignant protests. “It’s fine; I’m not offended. Quidditch was never my strong point anyways.”
Draco laughed. “Too bad for them, I have no interest in going into finance.”
“Do you fancy him?” she asked bluntly, and if Draco hadn’t already been seated, he might have fallen over.
“They didn’t?” This was news to Draco. He’d assumed the Golden Trio were living it up at Hogwarts, basking in the adoration that they’d surely get from the rest of the students.
Ginny looked suitably chagrined. “Sorry, it wasn’t my place.”
“Oh, darling, you know better than to call at a girl’s room unannounced. I could have been changing, you know.”
too close for Draco’s comfort. “I mean, why would she, when she has a pretty little poofter of a son to spread his legs on her behalf?”
“Maybe you should sit down.” Mrs Spencer suggested kindly, gesturing to one of the many benches that littered the park.
“It’s the least I could do after you invited me for dinner.” Draco replied with a shrug. “And I would be surprised if you
“Mama…” Draco hadn’t called her that since he was six years old but his mother made no comment about it, instead taking him into her arms and holding him close. A light weight landed on his shoulder and soon he had a crooning owl snuggling up to him as well.
“I’m so glad you find all this amusing, Malfoy,” he drawled, voice virtually dripping with sarcasm, and Draco had to take a couple of deep breaths to compose himself, quite overcome.
The rest of the Weasleys were milling about in the back garden and Draco could see that they’d already set up the Quidditch hoops a fair distance away from the house. Some of his trepidation melted away in place of anticipation. If he remembered correctly, he hadn’t played a proper game of Quidditch since fifth year.
Draco smiled, even as he felt a twinge of sadness at the remembrance of his godfather. “Have you… seen his portrait?” he asked hesitantly. He’d heard that the Ministry had finally relented to having Severus’ portrait join the other Headmasters at Hogwarts.
“I confess that I am. I find her writing quite refreshing.”
“You told me about your little journey of discovery, so I suppose it’s only fair if I tell you mine in return. You’ll see what I mean better if I do. That is, if you want to know.”
Draco frowned. “I beg to differ seeing as how–”
Draco sniffed. “
Potter had always been a rather touchy-feely sort of bloke, always crowding into Draco’s space with no regards to boundaries; sitting too close, leaning on Draco whenever he could, showering him with careless touches and unexpected hugs. Draco had always had to grit his teeth and tolerate it but an intoxicated Potter seemed to be a hundred times worse. The man was clingier than the giant squid and Weasley was absolutely no help when Potter decided to turn his attentions on Draco.
Needless to say, they’d cut all ties with him soon after.
“That curse spreads with
when you look at it,” Draco continued, sneaking a glance at Potter who was staring at him with his mouth slightly hanging open. “And I feel like owe it to those scorched off, as much as to you, to do something about it. I can even add you to the tapestry through Sirius.”
“Just for the record, I wanted no part of this,” Weasley put in.
, Weasley?”
“Oh, come on, he’s not a fuckboy,” Draco protested, feeling extremely indignant on Potter’s behalf. Whatever was going on with him now didn’t cancel out all the good that was in him, and Draco couldn’t just stand by and have him badmouthed. “He’s not cheated because, might I remind you,
The near-kiss debacle of a week ago hadn’t really changed anything at first, and he’d chalked it off as one of those spur-of-the-moment things Potter had been talking about. The problem however, was that if that were truly so, it wouldn’t have almost happened again… and again…
“Malfoy, just stop,” Potter cut in wearily. “You can be such an idiot sometimes, so I’ll keep this simple. You didn’t do it on purpose, I’m fine now, I really hate apologies,” he ticked these off on his fingers, “And I’d like to move on with my life, if you don’t mind. Can we just
Draco sat up and reigned in the impulse to shove him back, keeping to mind that Potter was still recovering. He settled on a glower instead and wrapped his arms around himself defensively.
“Trust Granger to get it right on even this account.” He was glad when his voice came out firm.
“Er, yes. Yes I am. And you are?” Draco asked.
“Yeah, but it wasn’t officiously!”
“That’s beautiful, Harry.” Weasley at least seemed to be enjoying himself.
. It’ll take more than
Draco smiled as modestly as he could. The party really had turned out well and Teddy’s hair had been a vibrant turquoise all evening, which was a known indicator that he was extremely happy. The birthday boy was currently doing a quick circuit around the room atop George’s shoulders, waving grandly at his guests. They’d just cut the cake – an enormous confection of chocolate fudge, covered in an array of sweets, that had had the little boy squealing in delight the moment it had been brought out – and he was busily sucking on a lollipop as he impressively made his rounds.
if she caught him reading one now.
“Thank you Cousin Draco!”
Draco’s breathe stuttered. Had Potter actually told her about Hogwarts?
Together, she and Ginny helped him upright – with quite a bit of wincing and groaning on his part – and Draco sat placidly as Molly gently checked him over for breaks or injuries.
Left behind, Draco went down to the kitchen to get their customary welcome-home milkshakes. Kreacher had already left them ready on the table so all he had to do was lift the cooling charms and carry them back up with him. He reminded the house elf to make a fresh batch of sugar cookies too. Ginny would be along for supper and her twins simply adored them. Their father wasn’t too far off in his love for them either, and Harry often wondered aloud if Daniel was such a quick Seeker because he practically ran on sugar.
sitting room.
“And what did Zabini think of all this?” Potter still seemed pissed.
“That’s still boring.” Fred declared and then turned to Louis and James. “Come on, let’s go play in the garden.”
With that he hurried out of the room, but not before he saw his mother and aunt exchange sympathetic looks.
Draco shook his head with an indulgent smile. “You know, I could have summoned it myself. You’ve only just been given the go-ahead to doing magic. It doesn’t mean you have to go crazy with it.”
and then was gone, leaving Draco still gaping like a fish.
“I see,” Draco deliberated slowly, beginning to realise the purpose of Potter’s visit. “And I suppose you want me to help you handle the rooms?”
Harry rolls his eyes at Draco’s dramatics. “We don’t have to kill it; we just need to get to our wands and then we can change it back to normal and get it out of the house.”
“I know that feeling.” Draco said softly and Potter wisely didn’t say anymore. Eventually after ten more minutes of walking, they came to what looked like a staircase going underground. Draco followed Potter downwards, and they came to a row of small gates which Potter opened using a small card.
Draco ignored the interruption. “Well, I’d finished my education at Hogwarts and was aimlessly wasting my talents by taking on the life of a recluse. Or at least, that’s what my Mother had said.” He laughed. “Not to say that she was thrilled when I suddenly announced that I’d be moving to France to complete a Potions Mastery. That was a bit of a spur of the moment decision but I’d always loved potions and thought that a career in it wouldn’t be so terrible.”
! Sweet Salazar, why would you even
With a sigh of irritation, he turns back to the fuse box, angry with himself for acting so jumpy. He’s about to reach for the trip again but stops and glances back over his shoulder when he hears the sound again, and it’s with even more irritation that he sees nothing there. Truth be told, he’s not even sure
“Is she alright with you staying away so late? It’s already dark out.”
“That girl really needs to learn to keep things to herself,” Draco muttered to himself, making a mental note to have a talk with her.
“I’ll take Lily, you take Al.” Potter said, stepping up behind Lily. “After that we’ll take them to join James at the seesaw.”
. A few drops that flew out as a result came dangerously close to Draco’s sleeve, and he surreptitiously moved it away, handing Potter a napkin when he didn’t immediately reach for it himself.
“How far did you go with her then?” Draco demanded, and
“How benevolent of you.” Draco gave a small smile, pleased to find them returning to their earlier dynamic, as if the accident had never occurred. “How do you take your tea?” he asked as he poured a cup for Potter.
“I should never have introduced you to George,” he tells Draco plainly, giving the snake a small kick before he stalks back to the house.

“Merlin’s balls, were you just
George deftly caught the coin and placed it on the back of his hand. “And heads it is! First pick goes to Ginny.”
“You’re
“Oh?” Potter’s hands settled firmly on Draco’s hips and he gave a dangerous smile. Draco smirked back as he leaned in to whisper in Potter’s ear.
And that had been quite some time ago.
“That has got to be the wickedest jinx I’ve ever come across!” Potter’s eyes shone with disconcerting brilliance as he crowded into Draco’s space. “Are you saying he’s going to be like that forever?”
“Young man, you should be ashamed of yourself!” she reprimanded fiercely, glaring up at Thin Lips. “In all my days I have never witnessed such disgusting behaviour. Good heavens, and in the middle of the street, no less!”
Well now, Draco had done a lot of things in his life that he was ashamed to admit, but never had he reduced a child to tears. It was unnerving, and he didn’t understand why the child was crying in the first place. Draco hadn’t even said a word and surely he wasn’t so horrible to look at that a child would break into hysterics at the sight of him. He’d never understand the workings of the mind of a child.
“I know,” Potter sighed. “If it makes you feel any better, I’m taking her out this weekend.”
“Great idea, Hermione!” Bill nodded in approval. “George, go fire-call her now.”
“Do take a seat,” Pansy continued, inviting them in as if it was her room and not Draco’s. “Would you like some tea? We can ring for it if you want.”
“You’d think they’d have backed out after Lucius went to Azkaban,” Blaise added.
Bill nodded. “The Healer said it would be May or maybe even late April. The sooner the better I say. I’ll admit I was happy to get out of the house today. Fleur was being extra difficult and if Gabrielle hadn’t shown up when she had, I don’t know where we’d have ended up.”
“Dromeda, should I add more flour?”
“Can I call you ‘Cousin Draco’?” Teddy asked, suddenly looking nervous.
“Yeah, everyone’s coming.” James put in. “Teddy too, cause he’s part of the family. We’re gonna have an egg hunt and play games and eat lots of chocolate.”
“Sacrilege!” Draco placed a hand over his heart. “That you could think me capable of such a thing.”
“I assure you he did. It was the talk of the dungeons all of sixth year. Even I heard about it and as you of all people know, I was a little distracted that year.”
a half-giant after all.” Draco said with an amused smile. “Anyways, it turned out we were going to be looking at a Hippogriff.” He took out his wand and quickly conjured up a puff of black smoke which he shaped into a hippogriff. The children ooh’d and ahh’d in apparent appreciation.
“Come on,” said Potter, and to Draco’s immense surprise, he took his hand, pulling him closer to the swings as if it were the most normal of things to do. His hand was warm and rather calloused; no doubt he still played Quidditch. It was slightly larger than Draco’s own hand and felt capable and comforting. Draco’s breathe hitched in his throat and he wanted to snatch his hand back and scold Potter for confusing the shite out of him.
“Nothing much. Just want you to stop acting like an idiot.”
“Well now, I don’t think that’s very hygienic,” Draco pointed out weakly, desperately trying to bring the conversation to safer waters.
“Draco, stop.” Pansy looked like she wanted to bop him on the head but settled on just glaring disapprovingly. “You are not going to be murdered by a pack of Weasleys and buried in their garden so there is no reason for you to be dictating the conditions of your will.”
“Well, it’s getting rather cramped in here so perhaps we should all go downstairs?” Granger’s crisp tone suddenly cut through the tension and Draco was able to breathe easier.
Draco shot Potter a panicked look but the git just stared back at him impassively.
“I think it’s because I’m still nothing more than a coward,” he finally whispered. No one said anything, waiting for him to continue. “When I realised that I liked Potter – that I
Draco looked down at Lily. “Do you think your dad looked like a monkey?”
that,” he manages to grit out, teeth clenched against the pain. Draco reaches out to gently prise his hand away from the impressive bump, and then murmurs something, his wand already out and pointed at Harry’s head. The relief is instantaneous and if Harry wasn’t already in love with Draco, he would be now.

In the end, Draco had settled on Mercury.

Ginny stepped forward menacingly and cracked a knuckle in an extremely un-ladylike manner. Potter’s hands went up defensively and he quickly put a chair between himself and Ginny.
“That too.”
“It wasn’t
Draco frowned to himself as they left him, wondering what his mother was up to. It was obvious she had something up her sleeves and if Andromeda was in on the plot, it didn’t bode well for him. With a shrug to himself, he did as told and went into the sitting room – and immediately let out a loud shriek.
Al nodded. “That’s a pretty name too. My mommy is Gineva.”
“Who would have thought that underneath all that Malfoy-ness, there’d be a real nutter.”
Potter looked stricken and Draco hastened to explain. “It’s not to say that I don’t
tanned Adonis of a bloke. Although in this case, Blaise appeared to be the one doing the buggering.
“First things first, do you know that I live at Grimmauld place?”
“You didn’t seem to have much of a problem last night.” Harry snapped.
“You were going to be the first person we told,” Pansy added softly.
“Whyever not? You do find him attractive don’t you?”
“I’m sorry it took me so long to get this to you,” he said softly and then gave a small chuckle. “I sort of had to find it first. My cupboard’s a mess.”
Potter frowned at that and handed one of the drinks to him. “You

“You made her
Draco found it difficult to hold back a ridiculous smile, absurdly pleased by everything Potter had said. When he’d been younger, he’d strived to emulate his father to no end, finding it flattering when people compared them favourably. But as he’d grown older and started to see Lucius for what he truly was, the comparison had grown stale.
Draco swept out of the room and returned to the sitting room where everyone had apparently left except for Ginny, Granger, and Weasley. They tried to say something but Draco ignored them and entered the Floo. As he was whisked away, he caught one final glimpse of Potter coming into the room, face ashen.
“That’s right.” Draco frowned, wondering where this was going.
“Al calm down, Draco wasn’t really going to do that.” Potter said comfortingly from his place on the ground, shooting Draco a glare.
to be fine with what we were, er… doing.” Weasley snorted again. “But then he suddenly freaked and pushed me away and threw pies at me,” he ended with a slight pout. “My hair probably still smells like gravy and meat.”
Draco shook his head. “The last owl I received from him was two weeks ago, but he was never a big letter writer to begin with so we shouldn’t worry. I assume he’s still working as a Muggle builder. He always did enjoy using his strength more than his mind.”
The fireplace flared at that eventful moment and they both sprang apart at once. Potter stumbled over the coffee table and landed sprawled across the couch just as Weasley emerged, a large cake box secured firmly in his hands. He paused at the grate as he surveyed the scene in front of him and Draco flushed guiltily even though he had nothing to feel guilty about. To make matters worse, Potter’s shirt had gotten twisted up during his fall and his muscular abdomen was exposed in a most telling manner.
Potter laughed again and Draco found that he rather liked being the reason for it.
His sharp tone must have jarred on Potter’s nerves and he crossed his arms stiffly, his whole bearing going into the offensive. “Really? Well, from the way you were mooning over her on the couch, I was pretty sure you didn’t know.”
What an odd day.
“Oh, grow the fuck up, Weasley,” Draco sneered. “It’s just a knitted shirt.”
Potter grinned sheepishly. “Next time I’ll be more careful. Come on,” he gestured for Draco to follow him as he exited the room and made for the stairs, “we’ll break through the attic and then that should be enough for today, I think. It’s much more guarded than the library and we probably won’t have the strength to do anything else afterwards.”
Draco gaped. “But… how can you
report it. The young Auror that I spoke to was… unhelpful.”
“Harry isn’t here yet,” Granger pointed out, lips pursed disapprovingly. “Late as usual.”
“And Harry,” she shook her head. “I haven’t seen him smile this much in
“What was what?” Potter asked innocently, heading towards the confection stand.
Draco nodded as he gingerly sat down on the settee. To his surprise, Potter took a seat at the other end and leant back comfortably, completely at ease with the situation.
Potter shrugged, leaning back in his chair comfortably. “It might. I think the Daily Prophet is running out of things to write about me. I haven’t done anything even close to heroic in years.”
Draco huffed but didn’t say anything else, following in silence when Potter led him into a darkened hall with an enormous screen at the front.
Draco looked down at his lap. “I see.”
Draco missed the rest of his mother’s speech, his mind whirling. So that explained why Potter hadn’t been wearing a ring and why he hadn’t gone for the film with the Weaslette. He wondered why they’d split if they were still ‘on the best of terms’.
fine specimens milling about, Potter.”
Just because he was divorced didn’t necessarily mean he played for Draco’s team, so to speak. With a sigh Draco headed to the
Draco’s eyes narrowed at the implications. He couldn’t really see Molly allowing Ginny to sleep over at Potter’s house.
“Draco.” she said, reaching for his face with a tender hand. She stroked his cheek and then turned to her sister. “Oh Cissy, he’s lovely.” she said and then took him into her arms as well.
“Whatever,” Draco muttered in defeat, snatching his hand back and staring down blankly at his wand. He couldn’t say that he cared for Potter and his strange mood swings; let him do as he pleased as long as he left Draco alone. Not everything was about him after all.
“Andromeda Tonks and my mum was Nymphadora.” Teddy replied. “Your mum is Aunt Cissy, right?”
Strong arms snaked around Draco’s waist and pressed him even more firmly against the wall. Potter’s hard body pressed up against him from the front so that there wasn’t a hair’s breadth between them and Draco shivered at the feel of Potter against him, angling his head to deepen the kiss as he urged Potter to take control. When Potter’s tongue licked along the seam of his lips, he opened up obligingly, accepting Potter into his mouth with a happy sigh. Their tongues slid against each other in wet heaven and Draco moved one of his hands to bury in Potter’s hair, finding it surprisingly soft and delighting in the appreciative groan Potter gave when he ran his fingers through the raven locks.
Both Potter and Weasley stared.
“Draco…” Harry reached out again and Draco moved out of his reach.
Pansy sniffed scornfully. “I’d have joined Draco as a recluse in the Manor. My mother, no matter how terrifying she may be, would never barge in unannounced and I’m certain the Manor’s wards can keep her away.”
do this?”
Draco pulls off the pumpkin and Harry’s scowl deepens when he sees that the prat has had the sense to cast a Bubble-Head Charm over his head before putting the pumpkin on. Draco’s laughing as if he doesn’t give two Knuts to the fact that his boyfriend is still lying on the ground, bruised and cold. Harry really hopes Harpy-lady hasn’t seen this little affair.
Narcissa pursed her lips before answering shortly. “The first time it happened, I

him – I was scared because of what it would do to our friendship, not to mention Ginny. I really valued what I had with her. If it wasn’t for her, I’d still be moping around the Manor. I’d never have made the decision to complete my N.E.W.T.s or turn my life around.”
“Only a tad though, right?” Potter actually smiled in a faintly teasing manner. “So I needed Ginny’s help to get a hold of you,” he went on. “And she told me I’d find you here.”
Draco actually apologizes for the snake incident, that night itself in fact, and that is probably why Harry stupidly believes he won’t try another trick on him again. He’s sadly mistaken of course, but he takes some amount of pleasure in the fact that Draco suffers through this one just as much as he does.
the conversation had been about, and Ginny took a sharp inhale. She rounded on Charlie accusingly and he actually stepped back in alarm.
“But –” Draco swallowed again. “I

.” Al put in, also crossing his arms.
sorry,” Draco says softly. “Are you hurt anywhere?”
he saw that it was not a thing at all, but a small child. A little boy with a mess of inky black hair and a pair of the biggest green eyes he’d ever seen. Those eyes were now staring up at him unblinkingly and Draco felt oddly unsettled. It was almost as if he’d seen them before. The child continued to stare, then he opened his little mouth and Draco noticed that his bottom lip was trembling violently.
“Cissa told me that you quarrelled with Harry.”
The following day found Draco shopping in Diagon Alley once more. He’d gone in search of a belated birthday gift for Teddy even though his aunt had told him it wasn’t necessary, seeing as how he hadn’t even known about Teddy’s existence when his birthday had passed. Still, Draco had wanted to give his new cousin something special and really, a child could never have too many gifts now could he? Eventually he’d come across a book on constellations and the myths behind them. Ever since Draco had told him about the constellation for which he’d been named, the child had shown an interest in astronomy – emboldened by their trip to the observatory later on. He was sure the book would be much appreciated.
.” He winced as his voice broke.
“I’m here,” Draco echoed stupidly, frozen in place by the force of Potter’s face-splitting grin.
Harry laughed. “Come on Draco, you know the holidays will practically fly by and then you’ll be begging them not to leave you.”
going well,” Draco shot back, and it was true. He’d actually been enjoying himself. “That is, until you had to remind me all too clearly of how much of a brat I used to be, and that you hate my guts.”
Draco scowled at the mess that was still the attic. They were trying to do some cleaning before they began sorting through the items, but it was as if the more dust and cobwebs they cleared away, the more still remained. He glanced over at where Potter was poking around a pile of candlesticks and saw that his denim-clad backside had a patch of dust on it. Draco wanted to laugh but as he was probably in a similar state, decided not to. He’d need a long bath when he got home to wash all the grime away.
“Draco never came to visit!”
“I came here for some supplies a couple of weeks ago and Bob was the one at the counter. He didn’t know who I was either but this other customer came up to me and asked for my autograph.” Potter let out a resigned sigh. “Bob asked me if I was a celebrity or something and the witch who I’d given the autograph took it upon herself to relate my entire life story to him.”
Turning back to the door without another word, Draco raised the wand and repeated the movements that his mother had taught him a few hours ago, murmuring the incantations under his breath. When he felt a small snap at the back of his mind, he stopped and turned to Potter.
“Excuse me, but may I interject?” Mrs Weasley enquired pleasantly, as if she hadn’t shamelessly inserted herself into their discussion uninvited. Her daughter stood behind her, idly watching the scene with arms loosely crossed over her chest. “Mrs Malfoy, if I’m assuming correctly here, it seems that you’ve been harassed regularly. Have the attempts ever crossed over to violence?”
Draco smothered a laugh at everyone’s horrified expressions. He felt quite horrified himself actually, but not as much as the others seemed to be. Ginny, for one, looked like she’d just witnessed bloody murder.
“I had a lot of people to meet, and I had to convince them to give me a chance too. There was no way I was going to jinx it by telling anyone before it was all finalised.”
“I hadn’t known that you were planning on buying an owl.”
“Well, you rushed out so suddenly.” he said with a frown. “I was worried that something was wrong.”

Draco unintentionally opened his mouth to ask a question but Potter seemed to have read his mind and beat him to it.

to choose.” She nodded at Draco. “Malfoy.”
James hurried after his brother, his trunk levitating haphazardly behind him and Lily followed him, still going on about James’ unsuccessful dating portfolio. Harry went up after them, wanting to make sure that they wouldn’t start fighting. They’d re-plastered the walls and he obviously didn’t want damages their first day back.
“Oh Draco,” his mother sighed. “You really need to catch up on the gossip. You’re dreadfully behind. Why I remember when you were at the height of it all, always bringing me tit bits about everything and everyone. I never did find out who you’re sources were but I always thought –”

Luna looked pleased. “You’ve matured splendidly!”
“I meant, say to Draco.”
“I will provide a wonderful home for your clothes,” Blaise promised fervently.
Her foot began to tap. Never a good sign. “I take it you haven’t the slightest clue about this particularly interesting article?” She held up the paper. “I’m having a lovely shopping expedition with your aunt when I suddenly see
Ginny whooped loudly and gave Potter a comradely smack on the back that made him take a step forward.
The day after, more flying and delicious macaroons.
“Oh come on Malfoy, just because you don’t like the prat doesn’t mean you do that.” Potter argued. “After all, he wasn’t buying them for himself. He was getting them for his wife.”
“At least
“I’m fine.” he said, pleased when his voice didn’t shake. Potter let go of him and Draco thankfully stepped away before turning around.
“I didn’t think,” Harry finally says helplessly, gently kissing first one cheek and then the other, tasting the salt of Draco’s tears. “I’m an idiot, I’m sorry.”
Draco took a fortifying breath and slowly counted to ten. It was either that, or strangle Potter with Mother’s new scarf.
“Well then, I humbly accept your invitation.”
“A little too long but perfect to describe Percy,” Ginny said in amusement. “Here’s an idea though. How ‘bout you try calling them by
Draco still hadn’t quite come to grips with what had just happened, and he remained silent. Luckily, his mother had her wits about her, ever the dignified Malfoy matriarch, and could answer instead.
was the one who stopped him from falling on his face, stepping forward and catching him easily. He set Draco to rights but didn’t step away, going so far as to duck under Draco’s arm to take the weight off his twisted ankle. It was a good thing Potter was already supporting him or else he’d have fallen in shock, the situation bordering on unreal.
“No, Draco don’ goooo,” Potter whined, wobbling over to flop onto his chest and staring up at him pleadingly.
“I have nothing better to do.” Draco had replied with a casual shrug, trying not to show how curious he suddenly was to know more about the wizard seated across from him.
I could book and lo and behold, I was back. That day you found me with the children had actually been the very day I’d come back. I’d been visiting Luna.”

, Draco thought as he glanced at the large grandfather clock in the corner of his room, and regretfully noted that it was almost suppertime already. He released a slow breath and smiled wanly at his friends. “As much as I hate to leave at this depressing note, it’s almost time for supper and I have to change.”
“Oh, there you are, Harry!” Ginny called, waving a hand in the air. “Something’s wrong with Draco.”
“Yes, yes, until we finish the two rooms, I’ll come,” Draco replied distractedly, rubbing at his temples. Sweet Salazar, Potter was worse than a child at times.
“Potter, what the fuck are
“No need for that Harry.” Aunt Dromeda said. “After all, too many cooks spoil the broth. We’ll be fine.”
‘Everything is fine!” he said in an overly cheerful voice. “Now you know I’m alright, you can get back to the children and Ginevra.”
“Must I repeat myself? A
Draco was taken aback but he could see that Potter meant every word.
She laughed. “Don’t worry sweetheart, he’s all yours.”
? How does that even work?”
“What did he do to you?”
Potter came straight up to the counter, ignoring Draco as he did so. “Could I have some owl pellets, please?”
The Weaslette finally stopped when they reached a less bustling part of the street, and Draco eyed her warily. He’d never admit it, but Ginny Weasley had always intimidated him a little, and he was at a complete loss over what to say or do in the face of her nonchalant stare.
Potter gave an uncultured snort. “Charming isn’t the word I’d use to describe you.” he said, with a quirk of the lips.
“Well, you shouldn’t,” Draco shot back snappily, the careless statement instantly souring his mood. “Ginny is a lovely girl, one of the most amazing people I have ever met, and you are
“Draco, why…” Harry trails off. His eyes are stinging, his whole body is aching, and he’s shivering with cold now too. He can’t even muster up the energy to be mad at Draco, meekly allowing himself to be helped off the floor and wiped down with a warm fluffy towel.
“Where
“Sorry Aunt ‘Mione.” he mumbled and his hair quickly melted in to an unassuming brown whilst his eyes also turned brown.
“Yeah!” Al agreed. “Like a monkey.”
“Sorry, Ginny, but Teddy will be expecting me.”
of firewhiskey he’d downed last night. He’d been hoping it would knock him out into next week.
“What do you want?”
Weasley scowled. “It’s not like I’m asking you to fight a basilisk. They’re just biscuits.”
Pansy’s gaze softened. “I know, Draco, but she’s welcome to come too. Ariana would love to have her. She’s currently between lovers and would enjoy the company.”
, you can join us downstairs after you finish up with Rose’s hair. It’s looking lovely already and afterwards you must show me how you made these smoke figurines so solid.”
“So…” Weasley began, sitting down comfortably in one of the armchairs.
“Nothing’s wrong.” Draco answered a bit too quickly.
Draco felt as if he’d been petrified by a basilisk as he watched Potter’s frantic look morph into one of utter relief. He knelt down and took them all in his arms at once, peppering kisses all over them. And then he smiled and Draco felt the breath leave him in a rush. Since when had Potter been able to smile like
“What did you and Mr Potter talk about?”
“What are you doing here?” he demanded again, and Harry looked rather taken aback.
Draco’s forehead furrowed as he realised that he didn’t like this hesitant, defensive Potter, and that he couldn’t just leave the situation as it was. Potter had made the effort to try and apologise for his behaviour on Monday, and now, Draco knew that it was his turn to be the better wizard.
“So, why
“Actually,” Granger spoke up again. “We were talking about how I pose a hindrance to my own team. As such, couldn’t we call someone else to play Chaser? George, you’re dating Angelina, right? Think she’d be up for a game?”
“Alright,” he finally said after a moment of contemplation, the slight uncertainty in his voice at odds with the steady way in which he met Draco’s gaze. “Relationship.”
Teddy put on an innocent expression. “I wasn’t running
“Stop acting like the Malfoy I hated from school!” Harry fairly yelled.
“Oh, no, snake boy, you are not chalking this down to ‘I am a Slytherin and that’s what we do’. You’re coming for the Quidditch game tomorrow and if you keep fussing, I promise you I’ll set Mum on you faster than you can say ‘hair gel’.”
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Dean asks in way of greeting, but he’s already unpacking and enlarging the items in his briefcase, setting them down on the floor.
“Potter, are you even listening to me?”
Draco smirked, lips tingling. “Definitely.”
were my best friends. I suppose you could say that they were what Hermione and Weasley are to Ha–Potter. The day after my trials, I received two letters from them. Pansy’s was smudged and soaked in tears. She said that her father had threatened to disown her if she continued her association with me. It was bad enough that she’d tried to give Potter up to the Dark Lord and he didn’t want anything else soiling the family name. He always was a cantankerous old bastard. She couldn’t do anything but obey him. If she was cut off, she’d be penniless and homeless and knowing Parkinson Sr., he’d make sure that no self-respecting wizarding family ever gave her the time of day. She’d lose everything.”
James shot Draco an unsure look but still turned to follow his cousins. Draco raised his voice. “I suppose you don’t want to know about the time I was attacked by a ferocious, mad Hippogriff?”
“It’s not about power,” he insisted, looking offended now. “I just meant that I could have vouched for your character.”
Though the last thing he expected was for it to happen in the shower.
Draco didn’t say anything but after a while he looked up to find Potter regarding him nervously, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth, and generally looking completely pathetic. Draco sighed. Salazar, he was getting soft.
Ginny’s words from that Quidditch game all those weeks ago came back to him in an instance. It had been absolutely terrifying to dive for the Snitch like that, not knowing whether he’d catch it or not, and the possibility of getting hurt a very real thing. And yet… he’d still gone for it anyways, hadn’t he? He’d done exactly what he’d never been able to do before; he’d gone for what he wanted, repercussions be damned, and it had
“Relax, Potter, we didn’t go all the way, although not for lack of wanting on my part. He, on the other hand, insisted that I needed something more meaningful for
“I guess I do have an unfair advantage,” Ginny accepted, manoeuvring her broom closer. “I get a lot of flying done at school after all.”
He lifted the pillow and his face must have been quite the sight if Narcissa’s stunned expression was anything to go by. She recovered fast enough though, and gave him a cold look.
Granger cleared her throat loudly and everyone finally looked at her. She not so subtly nudged Weasel and he stepped forward, taking a moment to inhale and exhale deeply before looking at Draco.
Draco’s responding hum sounds strangely muffled and Harry’s frown deepens. He finally places his hands on Draco’s to stop the massage and turns around.
exactly this heroic, day-saving dad is.”
Draco recounted the trip to Diagon alley and how the Weasleys unexpectedly came to their aid. Blaise whistled.
“Then
Draco laughed. “Really Potter, what was I supposed to do? I couldn’t very well cast a spell with all those Muggles around now could I?”
“So, you think this’ll make front page news?” Potter asked once he’d finished devouring his cone. Draco wasn’t even halfway done with his own vanilla and raspberry sauce sundae.
creature that he is.”
“Such a shame about Ginny though,” Mrs Spencer gave a weary sigh. “I really don’t know what went wrong. They always have and still do make a beautiful couple.”
he shouldn’t be able to understand them anymore.
“They’re your sons Potter, would you expect them to do otherwise?” Draco found himself saying, in spite of his previous plan to make a quick getaway while the boys were distracted.
He swallowed again. “No.”
“Er, I was hoping for a just a small bag actually,” Potter said apologetically.
“Well, I can tell you about the time I found a ghoul in my attic. I was only eight and let me tell you, it was not fun.”
“My Dwaco.” Lily said in a firm voice as if agreeing with Granger’s statement.
“I should have sent a message to St Mungo’s. Why, for fuck’s sake, did I fire-call Aunt Dromeda instead?”
“Malfoy, has anyone told you that you’re amazing?” Potter cut in abruptly, looking completely wrecked. “You can really add me?”
The results were immediate.
Harry grins. “That’s the idea.”
He turned on the spot and when the world came into focus again, he was in his room. He’d already informed his mother that he might be late so all he had to do was strip out of his clothes and flop into bed. He was asleep before his head even touched the pillow.
Al also held out his hand. “I’m Albus Severus Potter.” Draco shook his hand as well.
“Thank you.” he said, and was not ashamed when his voice broke.
“Are you sure this is alright? Maybe I should –”
Draco sighed. “Luna, could you please leave the room so that I may put on my pants?”
“I trust you,” Harry says simply, doing as told and turning his back to Dean. “Now buck up before Draco gets back.”
Potter frowned. “That’s another thing. You’ve finished up with all the Familial spells and all you’re doing now is sorting out the books to arrange for me. So doesn’t that mean that we’re pretty much done?”
“The curse breaker that came along that day offered to check the other books while she was here. She said that she’s cleared everything she can, which leaves only the Familial spells to deal with.”
“Complete words please, Draco.”
Ginny could obviously recognize a peace offering when she saw one and she visibly relaxed. “I can wait outside until you’ve finished your call,” she offered politely, but Pansy stopped her.
Narcissa frowned. “Language, Draco.”
Dean holds a mirror behind Harry to give him a better look. “So, does it look alright?”
“Capital idea Weasley, though I must warn you, you will lose.”
Draco could feel a stir of panic forming in his gut. It was all going to be over soon. No more spending time with Potter. No more bantering, and arguing and laughing together. No more sneaking glances or stealing touches. No more of everything that had quickly become his whole world. He was going to be thrown aside again, as oftentimes happened.
“Impressive.” Ginny looked between them approvingly. “We broke out of Hogwarts and then kidnapped Harry to bring him here with the intention of forcing Draco to talk to him or else.”
Potter seemed to relax at that and he reached out to ruffle Teddy’s hair, a vibrant blue that day. “Sure Teddy bear.”
“What did I miss?” Blaise’s head appeared next to Pansy’s and he gave a low whistle. “Well, if it isn’t our fiery Ginevra!
“Yes Potter, I know he got there first. I’m actually pleased that he pulled them out from that corner they’d been shoved in or I might not have seen them, but the fact remains that he did not deserve them.”
Kreacher cracked into the room with two plates piled high with sandwiches carefully balanced on his hands. Weasley’s mood lifted instantly.
Potter looked at him with grudging respect. “A worthy parry,” he acknowledged and then grimaced. “How do you even know about that?”
“Darling,” Pansy sighed. “You know we worry about you. Why can’t you just accept Blaise’s invitation and join us here in Italy? There’s plenty of room and so much to do! It’ll be like old times again.”
“You’re still miles better than Percy,” Weasley said firmly. “The last time he played with us, he kept trying to score for the wrong side.”
“Mirror! I was arguing with the mirror!”
“Can’t Harry.” Granger sighed. “Rosie still has a fever and I think Hugo has caught it too. It should go away in a few days but they need rest. Let me know if it’s a good movie and I’ll take them to see it later with the others. I have to go now. Bye Harry. Kids have fun.” She turned to go back into the Leaky. “Good to see you back Malfoy.” she added with a small
“Ginny, dear, are you alright?” a voice called from the crowd and soon her mother came hurtling through with the force of a rampaging erumpent.
“Harry, we need to kill it,” Draco whispers urgently, never taking his eyes off the spider. “It’s the only way.”
Working in the attic, which had started off as an enjoyable experience, quickly evolved into the very epitome of frustration. Their work consisted of repairing, restoring and sorting through the old items they came across, and it was so clustered that they oftentimes had to work in close proximity. Huddling together side by side for days on end had resulted in enough accidental brushes to almost drive Draco completely spare, and been a true exercise of self-restraint.
“Stop calling it action!” Potter sputtered, red in the face and eyes wide behind his glasses. “It makes it seem like more
There was some more fidgeting and a bit of shuffling, then suddenly Potter was dropping down to the floor next to him. He started in alarm.
“I’m not naked!” Draco yelped, yanking the sheet off him. “See, I’m fully clothed.”
“Well, well, well,
“I like you too,” Potter gushed and dutifully climbed off his lap.
Draco swore under his breath and hastily ducked out of the way as a spell shot straight at his head. It hit the wall behind him and he gulped as he took in the smoking hole it had made in the brick. Salazar’s ghost, that could have been his
“My knees were practically in ruin afterwards. I had to take a potion for the rug burns.”
When his mother entered she was holding a newspaper and not looking very happy. Aunt Andromeda was right behind her but she looked more amused than anything else. If the newspaper happened to be the Prophet, then Draco could understand what had sent his mother into a bad mood. They’d long since stopped subscribing to that rag, but Potter had kindly sent him a clipping that morning. He’d laughed so hard, he’d fallen out of his seat.
“That’s good. I was considering wearing the turnip ones, but I thought the purple would not go with my dress. Rolf picked it out for me.” she added, her face taking on the slightest of blushes.
“Harry, I’m–”
“No Al, it’s perfectly safe. It’s Al’s first time taking the tube too.” he said to Draco. He lowered his voice so the Muggles nearby couldn’t hear. “We could have just
“What brought this about all of a sudden?” Draco asked cautiously. His aunt was still browsing but it was clear she was listening intently.
“Is that safe?” Draco asked nervously as Potter led them to stand on a platform beside the tracks. “What if the roof collapses?”
Dean rolls his eyes but dips his brush into some red paint and begins to apply it with confident strokes onto Harry’s back. Harry watches as best he can by craning his head back, and at first all it looks like are random red lines that look nothing like Sectumsempra wounds at all. He’s about to complain when Dean sets his brush down and picks up his wand. He murmurs something Harry can’t quite catch as he waves his wand over each red line, and right before Harry’s eyes he sees the paint morph into bloody wounds, slicing up his back in a gruesome way.
“Draco is a pretty name.” Al announced suddenly, and this brought a smile to Draco’s face. “Thank you, Al. My mother will be pleased when I tell her that.” Potter was now staring at him as if he’d announced that he was planning on marrying a hippogriff and moving to Alaska.
He gave them a defiant look. “Can you imagine if we were actually together? The Saviour shacking up with a Death Eater, not even a full year since the War. It would never last. Potter would eventually realise that I’m just not worth the trouble, and he’d leave me.”
Lucius had been as prejudiced and egotistical as always even as he was being shipped to Azkaban in chains, and he hadn’t taken too kindly to being told some hard truths. Narcissa had still been rather cowed by her husband at the time and she hadn’t said much apart from mentioning her plans to make amends with her estranged sister. It had been Draco who had had to tell Lucius that everything he’d taught him was wrong and that if he ever hoped to salvage his soul (whatever little of it he had left), he had to let go of his hate. His father had never been a very good listener and his parting words had been, “I am ashamed to think that you bear my name.”
Draco rolled his eyes at Potter’s scandalized tone. “We
Harry decides not to make that stew after all.
“I’ve been calling you for ages!” Potter grumbled. “Ferret-face was a last resort.”
Draco sighed, looking out at the fields that surrounded Luna’s quaint house. The last time he’d been there had been a decade ago and he’d been fresh out of Hogwarts. He’d visited a few days after her father’s funeral. He would have liked to have come for the funeral itself, but with memories of the War still fresh, he hadn’t wanted to cause trouble with his attendance. So he had come later on, holding her close as they’d sat on this very veranda, watching the fireflies dance in the mellow colours of twilight. Luna hadn’t shed a single tear though; instead choosing to tell him about the wonderful things she and her father had done together, a smile firmly on her face the whole time.
“Hey Dad, can Draco come back to the Burrow with us?” James suddenly asked.
Granger sighed. “I suppose, as long as they’re happy…”
“So the baby’s expected in May?” Draco wondered how he’d feel if he was to be a father in such a short amount of time. Frankly, it was a terrifying prospect.
“Draco, we love you but
“Merlin, you’re overdramatic.” Ginny actually rolled her eyes at him. “This is ridiculous and you’re acting like a baby. Buck up and stop being such a coward.”
Draco could only gape as the boy was engulfed in a hearty hug by Potter. Just then the door opened again and Potter’s brood came trooping out, James holding Lily’s hand on one side while Al held the other. Granger was right behind them.
“What in Circe’s name is
Potter had the audacity to give him a cocky grin. “I didn’t know you cared, Malfoy.”
Draco exited the
didn’t say anything.”
Potter was dozing off by the window, snuggled up in a cushy armchair that someone must have brought up from the sitting room. He was pale and his face was thinner than Draco remembered, but most of all, he looked astonishingly
The little red head drew herself up. “Lily Luna Pottah!”
“I hate you,” Harry sighs, picking himself up off the ground and dusting his back for pebbles.
The room fell silent and Draco was instantly mortified by his outburst. He should have
“Careful.” Potter was next to him in an instance, a warm hand on his back. “It seems to get worse day by day. Wasn’t like this before, but Hermione thinks that since I officially live here now, it’s acting up to get me to leave.”
, he stooped down and picked up the Weaslette’s fallen bags, handing them to her with a muttered apology.
be done! I don’t suppose you remember who this Auror was?”
Potter grimaced in sympathy. “Was he old?”
Draco turned away from her, hating that he needed his mother to reassure him of his self-worth.
“I still have more books, you know,” Draco replied mildly.
! He heard Ginny give a loud whoop, and the rest of the game seemed to freeze as they watched the two Seekers hurtling towards the Snitch.
“Oh I know.” she replied pleasantly. “I wasn’t afraid of
Draco raised a hand to silence him. “Yeah, see, I’m not here to actually make a purchase so you might want to save the sales speech…” He squinted at the nametag pinned to the front of the man’s robes. “…Bob.”
“Er, yes. Is that a problem?”
Draco patted his head and to his delight the boy changed his hair to a soft white blonde. “I have one request though,” he said to Potter. “Do you think it might be alright if my mother came as well?”
There were murmurs of agreement all around and George produced a sickle. “Toss to see who gets first pick.” He threw it up and Ginny called, “Heads.”
Draco turned to see Mrs Weasley advancing on them with purposeful strides, her mouth set in a disapproving line.
“Malfoy, look at me.” He waited until Draco did so before he continued. “I’m not trying to push you, I swear. It’s just, there’s something between us, right? I know I’m not imagining it.”
“That I do.” Luna replied softly and Draco felt a warmth spread through him. He kissed her on the cheek one last time before finally strolling away from the house.
He leant back onto the tree trunk with a sigh. Al, his green eyed friend was sitting on his lap and seemed content to simply snuggle into the crook of his arm. He looked to be on the verge of dozing off, probably tired out by his dash through the wilderness. His big brother James, was leaning against Draco’s other side, and seemed intent on talking his ear off.
“As I’m sure you already know,
you mean then?”
“Sounds like Sev alright.”
“Harry also told me that you helped him pick out those dress robes.” she continued, a smile beginning to form. “I have to say, you have wonderful taste and the robes are beautiful. I’m planning on wearing them for the upcoming quidditch fundraiser hosted by the Puddlemere United team manager. Will you be attending?”
“I can see this is a sore topic for you,” Draco said as gravely as he could manage, which really was not gravely at all, seeing as how he was practically choking to keep his laughter at bay.
“Sorry about that,” he said with a wry smile. “She’s just shut up and I’d like to keep it that way.”
Draco ignored him as best he could and took hold of his mother’s arm, ready to lead her away from them. If they didn’t get away soon, he had no idea what he might do.
“In his defence,” Draco added quickly. “He was extremely drunk.”
“Just because we’re Slytherins doesn’t make us Snape.”
Draco leaves by Floo and as soon as the flames have dissipated, Harry is throwing a small handful of Floo powder into the grate. He calls out the address to Dean’s flat, and soon his old housemate is coming through into his living room, a small briefcase in his hand.
Truth be told, this was all because of the accident. Draco never wanted to find himself helpless in such a situation again, and he’d always secretly had an interest in Healing magic. In a sense it went hand in hand with Potions, but of course any hopes of a career in either of these fields had been nothing more than pipe dreams with his father pushing him to go into politics, much like himself. Yet another reason to be glad Lucius was out of the picture.
“Then you should ask permission from my aunt first.”
Draco’s jaw dropped as his wand was snatched out of his grip and flew into Potter’s waiting hands. He’d just been disarmed.
“I know we use our wands for the Wizarding ones, but there’s nothing like some good old-fashioned mouth action to get the job done,” Potter continued, his face the epitome of innocence even while his eyes gleamed devilishly.
Draco’s heart ached for him at the moment. All he wanted to do was tell him that it was all an act and let Harry take him into his arms and comfort him. Instead he set his jaw and erased all emotion from his face.
Draco lets out a watery laugh. “Yes, you are. But I’m the one who started it so I guess it’s really my fault.”
Harry scowls. He’d regretted his decision the minute Draco had asked for a cart to carry all the pumpkins he expected to choose. In his defence though, he’d honestly been afraid that Draco would break the Statute of Secrecy if he was allowed a wand. Draco
“You’re bringing out all the stocks, I see.”
“There, there,” Draco cooed in mock concern and Potter snickered. “She’ll be coming for the party at least. McGonagall gave them permission so you’ll get to see her tomorrow.”
“I was just about to ask you if you normally allowed your very young children to gallivant around the meadows by themselves.”
“Ginny said the same thing,” Draco said, remembering that first day spent together.
“We used to have a whole flock of albinos,” Draco explained. “Lucius’ idea of course; he said they represented perfection. Personally, I thought they represented cantankerousness – they were
“Well I’m not as young as I once was.”
“Wonderful party, Draco,” Granger told him with an approving nod and smile. “You’ve handled everything beautifully.”
Potter opened his mouth to say something but Draco silenced him with a raised hand. He wasn’t finished just yet.
Potter swung around in his seat with a wide grin. “Ginny! You didn’t tell me you were coming over today. I thought you were helping out at the shop.”
“Makes you wonder what she did to get off so easily,” Thin Lips continued. “Probably whored herself off to gain the favour of the Wizengamot. Tell me, does your husband know what you’ve been up to while he’s off in Azkaban? Or perhaps it was his idea in the first place? Did the plan include obtaining pardon for him as well?”
, Malfoy?!”
“I’ll be studying for my N.E.W.T.s actually,” he finally said.
me, you shameless prick!”
“Would you like us to help you?” Potter asked. “More people might get the job done quicker.”
At first, all he could do was lie there with his face in the dirt, fingers still closed tight around the quivering Snitch. He could hardly hear anything save for the staccato thudding of his heart and a light ringing in his ears, his lungs seemed to have forgotten how to breathe and the rest of his body probably hated him now, and yet Draco had never felt more
The statement was so
Now that he thought of it, Draco
“You’re the one who forgot your speech and had to rush home to retrieve it even though you’ve already read through it a million times and have it memorised word to word.”
“Draco, you aren’t pushing.” Al whined, drawing his attention back to him and Lily.
“Git.”
“I’m not supposed to do even the easiest of spells for at least two weeks,” Potter sighed. “That’s been a bit harder to get used to. I never really realised how dependant I’ve grown to magic until now.”
“Come on, Harry. Put some back into it!”
“Hey Dad, aren’t you s’posed to officiously introduce us?” James broke the silence once again. “’Cause you already know Draco and Auntie Hermione says it’s rude not to introduce people.”
“Yes, well you might not believe me when I say that my exceptional potions marks had nothing to do with Snape.”
Draco had no idea what a battery was but he nodded nonetheless. “I’ll start juicing it up then. It’s best done bit by bit or the toy could get damaged, especially if it hasn’t been used in a long time.”
“Merlin, Draco, what’s the rush?” She laughed as she cleaned herself up with a swish of her wand, but quickly stopped when she took in his dishevelled appearance. “Are you alright?” she asked, and the sweet concern in her voice made him want to cry.
for his birthday.”
“I’m no Seer but I predict that shopping for you will be an absolute nightmare,” she said wryly. “Anyways, what I meant was, you cannot be the only baby that was born on that day.”
!” Draco spluttered, but to no effect as she placed the owl on his shoulder and returned to her letters. She waved her hand in obvious dismissal and with a huff of annoyance, Draco snatched up the owl cage and supplies and stalked up to his rooms, his new roommate clinging onto his shoulder for dear life.
Draco turned to face her so fast his head spun. She met his narrowed gaze with an unwavering one of her own. He sighed.
the eldest living Black male, though seeing as how I’ve already inherited the Malfoy properties, I would have given the Black estate to my cousin.”
“You haven’t been back to Grimmauld Place,” she said, no beating around the bush as usual.
“Potter, we blondes can wear many things, but burgundy is a definite no. It makes us look practically sallow.”
Luckily for Draco, he was saved from answering this by the arrival of Ginny, followed close behind by an unhappy Weasel and an exasperated-looking Granger.
“We should celebrate! Bring out the firewhisky, Harry.” Weasley swept out his arm importantly.
“Boys, I –”
Weasley exploded. He laughed so loudly that everyone jumped and this time George really did spill his drink all over Angelina.
There was still a bit of tension in the air but this was to be expected, considering who they were and the history they shared. Potter’s game ensured that conversation was relatively flowing, but at first they never spoke about anything of real worth; sticking to the most mundane of topics. There were just too many ugly things left unspoken between them and Draco was afraid to bring them up and spoil the tentative friendship they’d begun, preferring to continue as if their shared pasts had never occurred.
“Draco?”
“You could have still asked, Draco,” Ginny said more gently. “Without jumping to conclusions.”
Harry’s happily humming away as he rubs shampoo into his hair, when the shower curtain is suddenly yanked back. He turns, fully expecting it to be Draco here to join him, grey eyes filled with wickedness. Instead he’s met with the terrifying appearance of one Severus Snape, who in all sense should be dead and certainly not cornering him when he’s buck naked in the shower.
“Malfoy,” Potter cautioned, his mouth pulling down in a moue of disapproval. “I’m not playing around here…”
Draco here?” she asked, taking a seat beside Potter and reaching for two cookies at once.
“Malfoy.”
your mother say?”
were in that House.”
Draco shook his head and she pouted.
Draco suddenly looks angry. “What did you expect? I come home and suddenly it’s like I’m sixteen again and back in Myrtle’s bathroom, except it’s not me bleeding to death on the tiles, it’s you!”
Before Draco could respond, his bedroom door banged open and he jumped, almost smacking his head on the grate.
“Please don’t tell me you’re
Blaise gave a shaky sort of smile. “Don’t go all sentimental on us now, Draco. You know we rely on you to uphold the aloofness that we Slytherins pride ourselves on. The moment you start telling us about your feelings is the moment the world ends.”
“Maybe he could be a crazy old house elf man?” Pansy suggested. “Narcissa says he speaks with them quite a lot now.”
Ginevra scoffed. “Oh please, don’t play dumb Draco. Do you really think no one has noticed that you’re avoiding Harry as if he’s the plague? I don’t know what happened between you two but you need to stop running away and face him head-on.”
sorry.”
. “Come on Lily,” he tried to unwind her arms from around his neck. “Draco needs to leave now.”
Draco blinked. “Longbottom, really?”
“Then you must return the favour and call me Narcissa.”
“I know,” Draco sighed, not wanting to talk about it. He didn’t like to talk about
Draco picked up the clothes and examined them. They seemed to be in his size alright and the short-sleeved button down shirt was in a lovely shade of green. The exact green of Harry’s eyes in fact.
had to be better than what they’d been doing. He nodded. “Very well then, I’ll begin. Early mornings.”
“That’s complete shite,” Ginny snorted. “There must be loads of people out there that share your birthday, whenever it may be, and–”
“How typical.”
Another stretch of silence passed between them and this time it was decidedly more awkward.
“I don’t hate her,” Potter replied easily. “We were all so young and lots of us did stupid, heat of the moment things, myself included. I’m tired of the fighting and hate. We’re all alive, that’s what matters.”
“Those people shouldn’t have treated you like that,” Potter continued, dark eyebrows pinching together as he looked at Draco earnestly, and
“Well, there’s not much to tell.” Draco said with a shrug. “Apparently the Minister didn’t take too kindly when he found out that Blaise had been shagging his wife.”
The children nodded their heads gravely, all except for Teddy who seemed to be trying not to laugh by stuffing his fist in his mouth.
protest, but seeing as how Potter wouldn’t let it go, he decided not to waste his energy. He took a seat while Potter rummaged through a cupboard.
“Mother.” Draco sighed. “We’re already here and you want to back out already?”
In retrospect, Draco would kick himself for forgetting that any form of half-arsery was extremely inappropriate when one is dealing with the Dark Arts, and this fact was made
He thought it prudent to immediately get away before someone else had a go at him, but no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than he found himself sopping wet.
“This is Malfoy,” George said in a chipper voice. “
“Ginny dropped an ice cube down the back of my shirt, of course I was going to react. Christ, I thought a Dementor had snuck up on me.” He shook his head with a grimace. “Sometimes I seriously wonder why I love her.”
“I forgot you went back,” Draco said, releasing his hold on his broom to shake out his cramped fingers. He really was severely out of fitness. “Did many of my year return?”
“That’s nothing. I once saw him get on a broom
“Still think it’s brilliant though. The others are going to worship you when I tell them about it.”
“Ginny, that’s enough,” Draco interjected sharply before Pansy could say anything. “You may know my situation but you don’t know theirs, so kindly refrain from antagonizing Pansy. She’s still one of my closest friends alongside Blaise.”
“Perfect.” Ginny nodded. “I’m still using the Firebolt Harry got me for my last birthday. How about you go get your broom quickly and we have ourselves a Seeker’s game? You can use our Floo.”
“Oh no, Mr Potter.” Bob shook his head vigorously. “Consider it on the house.”
clear when Potter began to scream.
“Trouble with the wand?”
“Hello, Malfoy,” he said in a fairly amiable tone.
Kreacher had already pulled a fresh batch of pies out of the oven and they were resting on a cooling tray. Draco reached for a plate to pile them on and waved Kreacher off when he hurried over to help.
With the few shreds of dignity he still retained, Draco stormed out of the room and back to bed. If Potter had indeed intended on leaving soon, his mother was sure to be in his room in a few minutes to lecture him on his ‘rude conduct’.
“I told you he had to lighten his grip.” Draco couldn’t help saying.
,” he points at the mess on the rug, “doesn’t leave a stain.”
If Potter had been stiff before, he was practically carved from stone now. “I assure you, I do not.” he grit out. “We were all at the Burrow and they snuck out the moment my back was turned. Why do I even need to explain myself to you?”
“I came by Floo. Your mum let me in.” One of Potter’s hands twitched and Draco bet he was just itching to get to his own wand.
His aunt invited them all to stay for dinner as well, but Potter declined, saying that he’d best be getting back to the children who were staying with the Weasel. He left soon afterwards and Draco had shared a strangely awkward goodbye with him. Perhaps they were feeling strange after realizing that they’d shared a rather personal conversation.
Potter kissed the side of his neck. “So beautiful.”
“Only if you’re fine with it, of course,” he added in a rush. “I mean, it is your house and I don’t want to step on your toes or anything. I just figured it might–”
“Pure torture, I assure you.”
If possible, Bob’s smile brightened. “Certainly, Mr Potter! Let me just show you our selection.” He completely ignored Draco as he started rummaging below the counter, making a fine racket, and Draco was deeply offended. He may have been a fake customer at this point, but he’d still got there first! Talk about biased customer service.
“We’re planning on calling it a night, Malfoy,” Weasley said with a friendly clap to the back. Apparently braving peacocks was enough for Weasley to regard him as a sort-of friend, though Draco wasn’t really complaining. He’d found in him a worthy chess player and they’d have gone all night if George hadn’t threatened to destroy the chess board if they didn’t put it away.
Yes, Draco should most definitely back down and yet here he was, currently clinging to Potter like his life depended on it, while the Muggle taxi driver drove like one who was intent on ending their lives as soon as possible.
Draco stiffened at once. Oh, he certainly liked
“Can’t you just call him ‘Father’ like the rest of us?” Al asked with a roll of his eyes. “We aren’t little kids anymore.”
The next day followed a similar routine, although Molly brought them mini apple pies for a change.
“We did,” she conceded with an exasperated look. “We got together after the War but that didn’t even last a month. Harry’s gay, you twit.”
“You were?” The hopeful tone in Potter’s voice did nothing to calm Draco’s nerves.
“Oh stop it you.” Luna laughed as she swatted his arm. “I told you, it’s a business meeting.”
A few days later, the pair were seated side by side in the attic as they attempted to restore an old toy carousel to its former glory. There was a great deal to be found in the attic, a plethora of items that the Blacks of the past had accumulated over the years, and Draco had been delighted to discover truly fine pieces of his heritage in the most unlikeliest of nooks.
Potter looked stricken. “I don’t hate you.”
“Why not?”
“I –”
“Merlin’s tits, Weasley, restrain your bloody friend!”
Draco rolled back onto his stomach. “I was hoping to have a nice pleasant conversation with my two best friends. Instead I get a first-hand look at your very active sex lives. Lucky me.”
“They can have it by tomorrow, yes?” Draco asked and pushed the pile of books away from him. “Enough sorting for today.”
“And I suppose all of them happened to be blokes around your age who are big Ginny Weasley fans?” Potter looked amused.
He quickly made his way to his set of rooms to change into some casual robes. He hadn’t been lying when he’d told Potter that he wore Muggle clothes quite frequently. He’d found that a pair of cotton trousers and t-shirt were a joy to wear when in the comfort of his home, and seeing as how they never got any visitors, there was no danger of being caught in such informal wear. After finally deciding on a set of plain light grey robes, Draco lingered in front of the mirror wondering if he should do something with his hair.
“I’ve been trying so hard to sell that owl and all anyone ever does is laugh at the poor thing.” Bob’s voice quivered even more. “Why, just this morning I caught a bunch of children poking fun at him.” He sniffed loudly and Draco narrowly held back a shriek of pure horror when Bob actually reached out and grasped one of his hands between his own. “But now I’ve found that special customer who sees him as the
Of course, it also helped that he’d yet to meet any of the other Weasley men, but alas, it seemed that was going to change very soon. A week’s company seemed to be enough for Ginny to want to officially introduce Draco to the rest of the family, and she sprang that particular idea on him when they were sitting in the kitchen eating hot buttered scones.
“Malfoy, how nice of you to join us today,” he gritted out in monotone, and Draco was surprised any words had come out at all, from the way he was clenching his teeth.
, the child said?
Potter snickered. “You should have told us to keep some for you. How were we supposed to know you wanted biscuits?”
given a rat’s arse about what the public think? So what if it might not last? You don’t know for sure which way it’ll go; it could turn out beautifully or blow up in your face. But you won’t know unless you
Potter smiled softly. “I’m following her example actually. Ginny’s all for second chances.”
“Quidditch!”
“Parkinson.” And then to Draco, “I didn’t know you still spoke with her.”
The redhead’s eyes narrowed and Draco sincerely hoped she wasn’t going to start screaming at him, or hexing. He still shuddered at the mere thought of her infamous Bat Bogey hex.
“Does your mum know about it?” Ginny asked curiously.
, but Potter suddenly grabbed his hand.
Draco groaned. “Well, it sounded more like a bloody date to me.” He rubbed his eyes tiredly, resigned now to the fact that he’d apparently been killing himself for nothing.
Her eyes widened a fraction and she motioned for him to bring it to her. He watched nervously as she pulled out the robin egg blue cashmere scarf he’d picked out for her, wondering belatedly if he should have stuck with the silver one instead. However, his fears fell away completely when her face lit up in pure delight.
“I do?” People always went on about how he looked like the spitting image of his father.
Harry chuckled, pausing in his torrent of kisses to give Draco’s neck a fond nuzzle. “Have I ever told you, you have a beautiful neck?”
He took another peek out the window and saw with horror that Potter had managed to escape the mob and was almost at the door now. Short from stuffing himself into an owl cage, there was really nowhere for him to possibly hide so he grabbed the nearest item – which just so happened to be a cage – and rushed to the counter. Affecting a nonchalant pose, Draco shot Bob a warning glance and hoped for all the world that he looked like a normal customer about to make a purchase. Just in time too, as Potter chose that moment to push through the door, the doorbell giving a soft tinkle.
Draco snickered. Potter was sopping wet with suds in his hair while he was completely dry. He’d wisely offered to wash Lily in the little bathtub that Potter had provided, whilst he dealt with the boys in the actual bathtub. Lily had turned out to be an angel in the bath, sitting quietly whilst Draco wiped her off and scrubbed her hair. The boys on the other hand managed to keep Potter wet no matter how many drying spells he employed.
Harry hurriedly pulled his hands out of Draco’s pants and they each took a sheepish step away from each other, trying to surreptitiously adjust themselves. James put Lily down from her place in his arms and began to pantomime a rather intense vomiting fit.  Al however was watching them with a look of pure joy.
,” she said with a shudder.
“Er…” Potter visibly struggled with himself, fidgeting and rubbing at his neck. “I just– where are you going?”
Pretty soon all the girl wanted their hair styled, so while he continued to relate his stories, Draco found himself plaiting and clipping and tying. He made sure not to do anything permanent though, knowing that their mothers’ would have a fit otherwise.
He didn’t blame his mother for her vindictive attitude. It would seem hypocritical of him to defend Lucius now after he’d all but told him how much he loathed calling him his father. Draco winced in memory; it was definitely a conversation he was unlikely to forget in a long time.
He turned to the children who were quiet for once as they regarded him. “Has anyone told you that you lot are terrors? Menaces. The stuff of nightmares!”
“We’d like that, yes.” he said smoothly, giving Draco’s hand a warning squeeze. Draco didn’t say anything and after buying the tickets, Potter finally let go of his hand. They made their way inside and then only did Draco round on him.
“What–”
Potter finally smiled at that. “I’m starting to reconsider my opinion of Zabini and Parkinson now.”
“Ow! Malfoy, that fucking
She must have sensed that he was in no mood for such a talk and quickly changed the subject. “How are Pansy and Blaise doing then? I assume she is still staying at his family estate.”
“Untie me.”
,” Draco sniffed, but this seemed to only amuse her even more. He gave her his best glare, although to little effect. “You know, you’re quite different from what I expected as well.”
was not one of them.
“Come on, you have to admit it was funny,” Draco calls after him.
Draco snorted. “Hardly. It belonged to my maternal grandmother and is frightfully unreliable. Mother’s wand doesn’t feel all there either, but it will listen, almost as if it’s looking out for me.” He broke off before he could say any more, aware of the fact that Potter was now looking at him strangely.
“Hermione calls it that too.” Potter sighed. “So, we joined up and eight months later we graduated from the academy. It took us two years to round them all up but even afterwards, there was always some wannabee dark wizard cropping up on a daily basis. Kept us busy. At the time, I’d also started dating Ginny again.”
“I don’t know what you just said but I think I should be offended,” Ginny huffed and sharply smacked Potter on the head.
“No excuses, Malfoy,” Potter spoke up from the doorway. “If you’re helping me, the least I can do is invite you to join me for dinner. Take a seat, unless you want to eat in the dining room.”
“I’ve been called in to help sort out a few rooms for him.”
Draco scrambled to his feet and put a good distance between them in case she went through with her threat. He stuck his nose in the air haughtily.
“Fine, I made new
close to fainting dead away. Harry isn’t sure how exactly they’d ended up in the kitchen, but with the door closed they can’t summon their wands without snapping them in the process, leaving them otherwise defenceless against their eight-legged foe.
“You’re telling me,” Pansy added, dark eyes glinting murderously.
It is
“But I’m used to ‘papa’ and it sounds so much more
“Good afternoon.” Draco replied politely.
“It’s not like I’d be doing anything better with my time.” Draco shrugged. “And anyways, this way we’ve made much more progress.”
. Draco turned his head sideways to see who had entered, and he blinked, sure he was seeing things.
“Can’t a son get his mother a gift just because?”
“There’s that…”
“And your magic?” Draco asked after a dry swallow.
Potter stopped transfiguring clumps of dust into bubbles and turned to him with pursed lips. “I’m pretty sure I saw another copy of that somewhere. Wait, let me just…
Draco let out a belligerent growl and he too pulled his broom into a dive. He’d be damned if he let Potter out-sneak
“I swear those swots cheated this year.” he groused.
“S’not like I care.” Potter mumbled so that Draco just caught the words. He continued in a louder voice. “We had a batch reunion about five years ago and you weren’t there. Neville asked after you for some reason and Luna told us you’d left the country. That’s all.” he finished in a defensive tone.
Everyone turned to Draco with varying levels of judgement and Draco stared back, completely flummoxed. He had no clue what was happening right now but he was starting to get the idea that he’d made a blunder in his understanding of things somewhere along the line.
“It’s not funny.” Potter said to Draco petulantly. “Next time I’ll make you wash them and then we’ll see who’s laughing.
Care to explain?”
The girl glanced from Potter, to the boys, to Draco carrying Lily and then gave a strange smile. “Might I interest you and your partner, in the family ticket prices? We’re giving a discount for the first hundred families.”
Draco focused all his energy into not choking on air.
The rest of his inner monologue was effectively cut off though, when the child suddenly clutched onto his robes. Draco now faced a dilemma. Should he brush the child off harshly, and risk more bawls? Or should he allow him to sniffle all over his leg, surely ruining the fabric with bogeys and drool and whatever else came out of crying toddlers? In the end, the boy made his decision for him by ceasing in his sobs and looking up at him, nose sniffing pathetically and eyes wet and huge. Draco cursed himself for suddenly developing a weakness for those eyes. He hesitantly placed a hand on the boy’s head.
“Better close your mouth before you catch flies Malfoy.” Potter’s teasing voice made Draco close his mouth with a snap.
“Lily was the result of too much alcohol coupled with some fumbling in the dark that both of us couldn’t even remember the next day.” he said with a face devoid of emotion. “I’m grateful it gave me my little angel in the end, but that doesn’t make it something I’m proud of.”
“From what I saw before, you do seem a tad whiter,” Pansy said thoughtfully. “Must be because you insist on living like a Muggle depiction of a vampire.”
“Er… Draco Malfoy.” Could Bob honestly not know who he was?
“I always thought it must be kind of nice to share it with a friend like that,” she continued. “Wouldn’t you like that too?”
“Why are you such a savage?”
“That’s not an excuse.”
“Knob.”
“You haven’t finished up with the library either,” she continued, warming up now. Draco could practically smell the lecture coming up.
“Keeping tabs on me, are we Potter? Didn’t know you cared so much.” Draco said with a sly smile, feeling absurdly pleased when Potter’s cheeks bloomed pink.
Draco’s eyes widened. He’d never thought about it before, but they really were finished. All he had were a few piles more; about a hundred books that he could probably finish today if he really tried.
. Just a little more and –
“I can’t wait to meet him.”
Draco opened his mouth to say something but the train suddenly gave a jerk forward and they were moving. Draco tried looking out the window but he could only see darkness. He instinctively moved closer to Potter before remembering himself and moving away again.
Granger blinked quizzically at him. “Well, you’re his friend who until a couple of days ago, came over every day and then you suddenly disappear. I think any of us would have done the same in his position.”
“And you’re going to have to tell her, you know,” Pansy said, equally as firmly. “Tell her about your feelings and that Potter might feel the same. Better talk to the speccy tosser too, before you do anything else. Call him out on his shite and get some answers.”
Although Draco was loathe to admit it, he actually thought it was quite sweet that Ginny was being so earnest about it all.
Teddy grinned and for a moment his eyes flickered to grey. As they walked Teddy told Draco about his Gran and the little house he’d grown up in. He told him about how it was his first year at Hogwarts and he’d been sorted into Hufflepuff, a fact that he was greatly proud of since his mother and grandfather had also been of that House.
“Yes, Potter, I
Draco had been to the Black estate only a few times and only as a very young child but he could still remember the gloom and foreboding that seemed to perpetually hang over the grimy house. He could see why his aunt had decided to relinquish any more dealings with the place.
“What the hell is wrong with you?” Potter demanded with an irritated scowl, following close behind as Draco stalked into the library.
She waved her hand impatiently. “Didn’t Luna tell you? Mr Potter has been divorced for a little over a year already. He’s a free man.”
A strange look passed over Potter’s face and Draco found himself leaning in as if drawn by some sort of invisible force. They were much closer now, Potter’s eyes boring into Draco’s own. “I was hoping it could be,” he confessed lowly, and Draco, winded and completely off-balanced in the face of Potter’s brazen honesty, wanted nothing more than to kiss him.
Turning to Lily he asked, “Would you also like to take a swing.”
“I’ve finally gone round the bend, it seems,” he said aloud, feeling pretty serene considering his insanity. “Janus Thickey ward, here I come.”
territory. Before he could make his escape though, Luna was already dragging him to the front door. She knocked loudly on it and took a step back.
When Saturday arrived, all Draco wanted to do was bury himself in his covers and never come out. Unfortunately for him, his mother had other plans. She sailed in with a cheerful ‘Good morning’ and then proceeded to aggressively strip him of his covers.
“I’m sorry for losing my temper.” he finally said. “Let’s just say the past few days haven’t been good for me.”
to!” Potter huffed in frustration. “I thought things were actually going well on Monday.”
“Can’t you give it a try?” Pansy whined. “You said it yourself, you’re turning your life around. You want to be your own man, then go for what you want.”
“What is
would.”
Draco stared at her in dismay. A meal at the Weasley abode? He was going to be
“Six tickets for Up please. Two adult tickets, two child tickets and my three and one year olds can share our tickets can’t they?” Potter said, reaching into his pocket for the money.
He reached the sitting room in a matter of seconds but tripped over a throw rug just as he entered, tumbling hard onto his front. Gritting his teeth against the pain, Draco crawled over towards the fireplace. His hands were trembling so badly that he ended up dropping the pot of Floo powder and it smashed to pieces on the stone hearth. Paying no heed to the mess, he scooped up a handful off the ground and flung it into the hearth. “Teddy’s nook!” he cried, thrusting his head into the green flames and immediately yelling for his aunt.
Draco swallowed. “Well, your father didn’t like me very much.” He sent Potter a defiant look which he returned.
found something noticeably different in Bob’s accent. If it hadn’t been for Bob’s perpetually happy tone, he might have even found it to be moderately attractive. “I suppose I did,” he acknowledged, and then gave Potter a searching sideways glance. “And why exactly do you know so much about dear Bob?”
“You are

Harry drew back as if he’d been slapped. “What?”
They set off but after a few minutes Draco found the metamorphagus child walking beside him with a curious look on his face.
a surprise to see you.”
“Aunt Dromeda mentioned it a few times.”
“Who doesn’t what?” The amused voice that cut in was one that Draco knew all too well. It had featured in his dreams last night after all.
“Oh you were so whinging.” Al called from halfway up the stairs.
Potter gave up swatting at Mercury and wrapped his arms protectively around his head. Draco beamed in triumph and made a note to buy Mercury some special owl treats the next time he was out. “Mercury, that’s enough. Potter desists.”
“How are we choosing team captains?” Charlie asked.
Draco saved Potter from having to come up with an excuse. “I can’t anyways. It’s growing late and I really should be getting home. Perhaps another time?” he said smoothly.
“Let’s see,” Potter clasped his hands under his chin. “You already know I didn’t return for eighth year. Ron and I had been offered free passes into Auror training, even without our NEWTS.”
“Harry.” This was growled into his ear, and the heady feel of hot breath made him shiver. Potter pressed him even harder against the counter and the edge of the counter dug painfully into his lower back.
Potter laughed. “Mrs Spencer can come on as rather strong but she means well.”
“It’s very nice to meet you Mr Potter.” Draco gave the boy a firm handshake. “I’m Draco Lucius Malfoy.”
, his mother had said and here this woman also thought that the divorce had done little to diminish their regard for each other. He didn’t understand. If Potter and the Weaslette were still so close, what difference did the divorce make? He might as well still be a married man and here Draco was, hopelessly falling for him.
Draco looked back in through the window and found Bob smiling back at him. He waved cheerily and Draco shuddered in revulsion. “…I really should be off. Good day, Potter.” He was about to make his exit but stopped when Potter suddenly sprang forward and grabbed his sleeve, with a loud, “Wait!”
“So, do you have any plans for the day?” his mother asked, taking a seat in one of the chairs by the window. Aunt Dromeda moved over to one of the bookshelves and began to browse.
Potter raised his hands in alarm. “Malfoy, calm the fuck down.”
“Good, you’re up.” she said pleasantly. “Now get dressed, it’s almost two in the afternoon. What a time to get up.” She shook her head disapprovingly.
“Weasley, please take Draco and go,” Pansy interjected with an impatient huff of breath. “They’ll be at it all day otherwise.”
Soon Potter had reached them and he gave them a stern look. “How many times have I told you to
Draco blinked. Surely he’d heard that wrong. “A lily fell in a hole?” he asked slowly. The boy nodded vigorously. Well, apparently he hadn’t misheard it.
They were level now; arms outstretched, sides pressed firmly against each other, shoulder to hip. The Snitch was so close now and Draco knew that success or failure lay in the next crucial few minutes. He desperately flattened himself against his broom, his back screaming in protest as he managed to stretch himself out even more, but to no avail. He watched, as if the world had slowed down, as Potter’s hand began to edge ahead of his own, and in a last-ditch attempt, Draco decided he was done playing it safe.
Weasley shrugged. “Like I said, it’s not my business. Harry’s old enough to make his own decisions and sort out his own messes. Or at least, that’s what ‘Mione says.”
“Well, aren’t you a charmer,” Ginny simpered and gave him an exaggerated wink. “You better not have fallen for me, pretty boy, for I am regrettably a taken woman.”
“Hey!”
“Thanks for offering to help though.” Potter continued. “Bath time can be pretty hectic and I’m rather tired today.”
Draco swallowed thickly. “I want to do better. I want to make you proud, but it’s just so
forgive her for that.”
Soon she was with him in the sitting room and he led her shakily back to the library. Kreacher was hitting himself with a large book and was bawling about how his master was dying, but Potter’s screams seemed to have subsided, replaced by exhausted whimpers. The streaks had spread up to his elbow by now and when Andromeda caught sight of them, she gasped.
“You can’t blame yourself for this,” Blaise told him firmly. “So Potter isn’t in love with his girlfriend anymore? These things happen.”
“However,” he added sternly when Potter finally looked up with a startled expression. “That was then, and this is now. I’d prefer not to be reminded of my less than commendable past and I hope you’ll respect that.”
Draco sniffs. “I acknowledge the fact that my plan got out of hand. I wasn’t the one that closed the door though, so we’re both to blame for our current predicament.”
“Malfoy, are you alright?”
“You all rushed out so suddenly and I couldn’t just– Good heavens, what happened to Draco’s neck?”
Potter looked like he didn’t quite believe him but thankfully didn’t press the matter. He gave Draco’s hand a final squeeze before letting go and taking up a balloon. Draco followed his example and took up the balloon he’d been trying to inflate before, although this time he used his newly-returned wand and it worked perfectly.
His eyes narrowed. “You think that’s funny, do you?”
Draco was stunned. He’d known that the public wouldn’t exactly accept them with open arms, but he’d always assumed that they would be more lenient with his mother. Narcissa didn’t have the Mark, after all, and had never been a Death Eater. He’d thought the worst she’d come across would be hissed words behind her back or a mild snubbing.
“Now that you’ve calmed down a bit,” he said, squatting so he was more at level with the boy. “Why were you crying, and –” he looked around, “– why are you all by yourself?” Really, what were parents doing these days – allowing adorable little children to run around in the wilderness by themselves! If he ever met the little one’s parents, he would give them a piece of his mind.
“Unlike you, I know how to get them to behave.” Draco replied smugly, even as he felt a thrill go through him at the mention of a ‘next time’.
Draco stared aghast. “You bastard! You actually think that?” He moved his shoulder back and sent the tail of his broom smacking into the side of Potter’s head.
“So tell me Potter,” Draco began, but the Gryffindor was just staring with an odd expression on his face and didn’t appear to be listening. “Potter?”
“How do you like
In the end, Draco suggested a game of chess and Potter had gratefully accepted the idea. Better to play a game that happened to have little talking involved, than stand awkwardly in the middle of his aunt’s sitting room. So Draco pulled out his wand and summoned the chess board which came flying from on top of one of the cupboards. When he turned to Potter, he found him staring intently at this wand.
“Er, Potter? I don’t have any Muggle money.” Draco whispered into his ear, feeling unprepared.
“Oh yes, well as I said, he and Ms Weasley split up early last year. It was an amiable split too and I hear they’re still on the best of terms. No scandals whatsoever.”
Potter looked up for a brief moment and then dropped his gaze again. “He’s fine now. We kind of made up during the War. But back when we were kids, yeah, he wasn’t nice.”
“What did you get her?”
Draco smirked again. Potter was going to flip. “Let’s just say that she didn’t take it too kindly when she found out that Blaise was also shagging their son.”
“Do you?” It was Draco’s turn to look incredulous.
Lily giggled and clapped her hands together. “Dwaco!”
Draco shuffled his feet guiltily. “I may not have actually gone to Ginny’s in the first place.” He held up his bag. “I went out to get you something.”
Draco’s nerve left him as soon as it had come, and he took a step back, fully intent on hightailing it away and sequestering himself back at the Manor until the end of days. There was something inherently
“Sorry I’m late! I was with Teddy and completely lost track of time. I–
“I could do without a heart attack, thank you very much.”
“This, as in?”
“The problem wasn’t that he wasn’t holding the broom properly.” Draco explained patiently. “It was that his tightened grip made him seem unsure of his movements which made the broom not respond to his touch as well as it should have.”
something!” Draco whines, clutching onto Harry’s shoulders like his life depends on it – which it sort of does.
To his surprise, he felt quite reluctant to do so and Ginny must have felt the same as she spoke up at once.
“We were taught basic First Aid spells during training,” Potter said as a way of explanation, tucking his wand away again. “I’ve healed what I can but you’ll still want some of Molly’s paste, unless you want to wake up black and blue tomorrow.”
“The beginnings of madness if you ask me. And he’s so young too.”
Draco genuinely had no idea. He’d just found out that not only was his crush reciprocated, but there was nothing wrong about acting on it. He took Potter in, noting the faint flush on his cheeks and the nervous energy surrounding him. Gone was the confident man in the kitchen, and it was as if Potter had reverted back to an awkward schoolboy trying to ask Cho Chang out to the Yule ball.
“That was so cool! Did you see me, Harry? I did just what Cousin Draco said and I didn’t fall off even once!” Teddy exclaimed with a big smile on his face.
Draco cursed his pale skin as he erupted into a fiery blush. “If you are finished insulting me, I’ll take my leave now. See you on Monday, Potter. Goodnight all.”
He took a shuddering breath and looked down at Potter, face scrunched up in concern.
“Wha…?”
Lily giggled and patted his cheek, drawing his attention to her. “And who might you be?” Draco asked with a smile.
Draco turned but instead of Harry, he found himself face to face with Ginny Weasley. Lily was in her arms and Draco was struck by how she really was the spitting image of her mother. Ginevra’s eyes were fixed sternly on her sons, but they suddenly shot to him as if only then realizing who was with them.
“Pretty much.” Draco replied with a shrug.
, maybe even sleeping in the bed next to him.
“Well, he’s only a friend right now, though I wouldn’t mind more.” Luna admitted, flushing even more.
“Ooh ooh, Jamie tell them about what you, Fred and Louis did to Peeves!”
Draco looked at Harry for support and found him watching them with a soft smile on his face. He turned back to Al. “I’d love to.”
