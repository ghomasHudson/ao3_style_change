"It's just a bit odd, isn't it?" Ron finally said one night as he stepped into the Floo. "Being here, after everything. I mean, I understand wanting to be close to your family, but… I don't know, Harry."
"And that's another thing." Potter points at him, his hand shaking. "What do you mean by operative? I know every member of the Auror Corp, and you're not in it."
Malfoy, silent and uncertain, put his fingers around the glass, then waited, though Harry didn't know for what.
I didn't mean to become a pirate, not really. I'd always liked to imagine myself as somewhat of a rogue, though it took the Dark Lord's demise and my father's admittance to the Janus Thickey Ward before I finally took on the trappings of the title. I'd been acquitted, though just barely — thank you for that, by the way — and with all of the Malfoy money tied up in the courts and mother's guardianship, my desire to fall into a life of sin and splendor was somewhat curtailed. It's a bit hard to live a life of leisure when you've no gilt, and Mother certainly wasn't going to finance my debauchery.
As they calm, the downpour slows until it's only a light mist. They're both soaked through. Harry's glasses are completely covered by droplets of water that cling to the lenses, and as the rain stops, leaving only humidity—and completely ruined paperwork—behind, he takes them off and casts a quick drying charm before putting them back on.
From what I heard, you did well at first, just like I did. It's always like that when you start something new, isn't it? Those first days feel exciting, like you might enjoy what you've been tasked with.
nice restaurant, Potter," Draco says, setting the menu—and its lack of listed prices—down on the table.
"No, darling, no." A gentle kiss to his temple, to the top of his head. "You're perfect. You're absolutely perfect."
If he thought that this would be a soft, gentle thing, Potter quickly disabuses him of that notion. He doesn't let Draco go, just levitates him over to the closest wall and pushes Draco against it. Potter bites at the nape of his neck, then licks over the sting.
Weasley shrugs, his posture in the chair more of a lounge than a slouch. Head lolling back, eyes closed in what Draco assumes is warm bliss, he says, "No idea. They wouldn't commit to a timeline. Be thankful you lot have good weather in here."
Harry surged up and captured Draco's mouth with his. The fire in his soul blazed, and though he tried, he couldn't hold it back. "You're mine," he said between bruising kisses. "You're mine, and I'm not letting you go."
He takes the roots from Harry's sweaty hands, then quickly picks up a knife like it's an extension of his own body before easily and quickly slicing it into even pieces. Turning the board, he does the same in the other direction, before finally cutting through them a third time. The neat, tidy pile of cubes laid out across the cutting surface are almost mocking in their perfection.
Harry had pulled a stool up behind the bar and was leaning back against the rail, his beer resting by his elbow. Malfoy's hair was loose and falling in his face, and his cigarette left curls of smoke behind as he gestured around the pub.
Potter unbuttons his shirt deftly, competent fingers slipping the small discs through their holes so quickly that Draco is caught unawares when Potter's shirt flaps open. His vest isn't wet with sweat anymore, except under the arms, but Draco can smell the man's body from where he's sitting, a sharp, musky thing tinged with the spice of his deodorant or soap. The room heats in a rush, and Draco lets his fingers flirt with the next button on his shirt. When he catches Potter's eyes on his hand, he lets them push against the fastening until it slips free.
His hand worked over Harry's cock with firm, teasing strokes. That competent touch only faltered a little when Draco pulled away to take his own prick out, and when it came back, it had the added pressure, the added pleasure of Draco's length against Harry's own.
For the first ten minutes of Malfoy's lecture, Harry finds himself too distracted by the heads still turning his way to pay much attention to what the man's saying. But as the other students stop looking at him and start listening to Malfoy, Harry finds himself doing the same.
"Hm, let me see. I got you out of a firefight, patched up your broken head, and then graciously offered you comfort and safety. A bit of gratitude would be much appreciated."
Harry rolls Draco's cuff back easily, forcing it further and further up until it reaches the crook of his elbow and can't go any further. The Dark Mark is a black stain along Draco's pale skin, and Harry trails his fingers over it slowly, tracing the outline of the skull and snake before falling back to the lines of Draco's veins.
It's not enough prep. Draco's not ready to take it. It's too much like pain, too much like pleasure, and as Potter plows his way into Draco's body, he loves every aching inch of it.
, and Harry has to admit that if Snape had been half as good at teaching as Malfoy, Harry might've actually learned something.
When Harry comes to, his face is wet and sticky with blood and people are screaming. He tries to open his eyes, but one of them is stuck closed. From the one he's able to open, he sees Draco standing before Voldemort, the Elder Wand in his pale, shaking hands.
"You're doing so well," Harry murmurs, his thumb resting against Draco's lower lip. Without thought, Draco lets his mouth fall open, lets Harry press against the firm, wet surface of Draco's tongue. "Get me wet, love."
Harry inhaled, tasting tobacco and Draco's mouth, and let the smoke settle in his lungs. Let it burn him for just a moment before he let it go.
"I've been thinking," Harry says as he coasts his lips down the column of Draco's throat, "about how much I wanted to put that pretty cock of yours in my mouth."
"Merlin, Potter. If I hadn't seen you kill Voldemort myself, I'd start thinking it was a rumor with the way you're carrying on. Here."
Though it nearly killed him, Harry gritted out, "It's okay. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. We can go slow."
In a rush, like breaking through the surface of the sea into the glorious salt-tinged air, Draco comes.
"That's right," Draco said, his rhythm faltering. "That's right, come all over me, Harry. Show me how much you want me."
"Now," Draco says after he pulls away, breathing against Harry's mouth, "I believe we've some talking that needs to happen."
"Now, try again." Malfoy presses the knife into Harry's hand and passes him another root. "And don't fuck it up this time."
"I want you, Harry." A soft kiss at the corner of his mouth. Another across the apple of his check. "I want you. As long as you'll let me, I'll have you. Just as you'll have me."
"Neat for now." Malfoy took another drag on his cigarette and watched Harry pour him a drink. He exhaled as he said, "thank you."
Malfoy sniffs and doesn't meet Harry's eyes as he walks to the sink. Harry's still leaning against the counter, but Malfoy doesn't push him out of the way, just edges around him until he can reach the faucet.
Malfoy finished his cigarette and stubbed it out in the ashtray before taking a healthy sip from his glass. Eyes closed, he sighed, then looked at Harry with something like fear.
With the door to the room shut, the noise from the club is muffled. Harry can hear the man's clothes rustling as he moves about. He doesn't speak, though, and Harry does his best to not let the unease tighten his body.
"Last man standing," Dean says again, before pulling Seamus up from the floor. They press too close together, and Ron whistles.
"Right." Potter's eyebrow raises, and Draco watches as a bit of sweat rolls down his temple to disappear beneath the arm of his glasses. "You're never worried about that now."
"Not in my pub," Harry said, laughing. He didn't stop undressing, though. "There's a flat upstairs."
"Consider it motivation, then," Malfoy says, his hand running along the waistband of his joggers, the front already starting to tent.
Potter has to rise to his tip-toes to grab it, and his shirt pulls with the motion, coming untucked from his waistband. There's a flash of dark skin that Draco can't pull his eyes away from, and the room gusts with heat. A moment later, Harry's got the folder, and he's turning around to hand it to Pansy, and Draco tears his gaze away like a guilty child caught reaching into the biscuit tin.
The curtain slides shut with a cheerful jangle, and Harry suddenly realizes that there's not nearly enough space in the cubicle for both him and Draco. They're both pressed against opposite walls, the water falling between them and splashing their chests. It makes the ice-cold tile against his back a bit more bearable, but the temperature difference is distracting.
Uncertain if he should approach Malfoy now or after the class has emptied, Harry stands next to the drying cauldrons, trapped by indecision. Malfoy has his head down, flipping through papers—likely the reviews he mentioned—with hardly any attention paid to the Trainees gathering their stuff to leave. Harry watches them file out of the class, their voices bright with success, and feels doubt sink its claws into his gut. He'll find Malfoy later, maybe try to ask him then. As Harry moves to join the mass of leaving students, Malfoy's voice cuts through the noise.
And though Draco has done his absolute best to make sure to put his best features on display, it seems as though Potter is not only a Himbo, but a blind one at that.
"Likely story, Mr Potter. Anyway, he's Seeker on my team, and he's turned out to be less of a prat than he was at school. You're changing the subject, though. Are you going to do something about him being fit?"
"I rubbed your spunk into my skin. I got my hand nice and wet with it, and then I made myself come again."
Mouth quirked into a smile, he looks down at Harry without any judgement in his eyes. Just patience. "Potter."
Harry licks his lips and smiles as Malfoy groans. "Doesn't taste that bad," he says before putting his sticky fingers in his mouth and licking them clean. "I could get used to it."
He'd be hard and bleeding beneath Malfoy's feet, and Harry wants to believe he wouldn't be begging for more, but in the solitude of his own mind and his frozen body, he knows he would. He'd be gagging for it, the same way he's gagging on his own blood now.
"But you need it." Draco touches Harry's shoulder lightly, and even that small hint of a touch has goose pimples erupting on Harry's skin. "Let me help you, Potter. If we work together, we could—"
The moment is broken by a loud, frantic knocking on the door. Cursing, Draco and Harry pull away and put themselves somewhat to rights. Draco's just got his prick put away when Weasley bursts into the office, then stops just past the threshold.
"I've no idea what I'm doing." Draco's hands told another story. They eased Harry's fly open, dragged the gaping fabric wide enough for Harry's cock to fall out, then grabbed it with a firm, confident grip. "I've never…"
"Oh, fuck, that's lovely." He closes his eyes for a moment, and Draco watches a flake melt and soak into Weasley's hair. "You two are bloody lucky, I have to tell you."
Voice raised so the whole class can hear, Malfoy announces, "You should all be on the final step before brewing begins. Since this is a fast brewing potion, you will need to keep a careful eye on the cauldron. Pay close attention to the color changes or you'll miss the moment when you need to turn the flame down, then off. Thankfully, this doesn't have anything noxious in it, so there's no real risk if you overbrew, other than the smell and difficulty in cleaning the cauldron after. If you've got your diced,"—his eyes cut to Harry, then back to the room—"root ready, please add it to the cauldron and turn the flame onto high now.
He can feel the body heat of passersby, can smell their perfume and their sweat. No one touches him. They're not allowed to. This is about making Harry wait.
Harry panted Draco's name into his mouth, then shoved the jacket from Draco's shoulders. It fell to the ground, but Harry was already focused on Draco's shirt and getting it off.
The alley is empty, and Draco's nearly halfway down it when the door slams open behind him. He curses, then starts running.
He does take the time to bring his summer uniforms out of storage. The linen shirts and trousers, their threads enchanted with Cooling Charms and antiperspirant spells, should make things a bit more bearable than his heavy woolen winter garb.
Sighing, he leans his arm against the shower wall, lets the water cascade over his back, and works his prick nice and slow, just how he likes it. His toes curl, and his eyes fall shut as he starts picturing someone on their knees before him, their smart mouth open and red around his prick as he fucks their face, when there's a pointed cough behind him.
"That's cheating," Harry finally manages, though he's so weak and limp with satisfaction, he thinks he'll be lucky if Malfoy can make the words out.
"Are you…" Malfoy's brow furrows. "Are you telling me you deliberately poisoned a fellow Auror so that you could ask me out for coffee?"
Potter brushes his fingers against Draco's prostate, then pushes hard against it until he's writhing and cursing into the wall. "Not until you're begging for it."
"I think an hour." Harry says it as if they're planning on leaving the house for dinner. He's so calm, so collected. Draco wants to destroy that serenity, wants to rip it to shreds and expose the beast lurking within.
"I've got an idea about that, actually." Draco holds his hand out for the case file, then opens it after Potter places it in his hand. "There's a family friend in here that seemed a bit… too close with the wife. If she was having an affair, it might be motive enough."
"Well done, Finnegan," Dean says, and Harry gets the feeling that Seamus's choked off breath isn't from embarrassment. Especially when Dean comes a minute later and the two of them stumble off towards the bathroom, laughing.
I've an offer to make you, Potter. Or shall I call you Harry, since we may become partners after this? Judging by that glare of yours, I think not.
When Harry Potter stepped out of the smoking rubble of Hogwarts Castle, no one expected him to fall at Voldemort's feet, his wand outstretched in shaking hands, and surrender.
It didn't stop them from nearly getting me. It's how I got this. Yes, I've seen you staring. It is a bit garish, isn't it? I'm lucky I didn't lose the eye. My doctor told me it was a near thing.
can't be the same bloke from the other night. There's no way that Malfoy would get on his knees, arse up and waiting for whichever wizard was willing to put his prick into it. No way that he'd reach back to grab at a well-muscled thigh and order that wizard to make him fucking feel it.
"Oh, darling," Harry says before wiping the warm, wet cloth across Draco's forehead. "Let's get you cleaned up. Do you need water?"
Heart stuttering in his chest and a frown forming before he can stop it, Harry turns to face Malfoy. "I'm sorry?"
And through it all, he wanted to know what Potter would think of Draco now. Would he take his hand, if he knew the things it had done? Would he look at Draco with disdain, with disgust, or would he — maybe — look at Draco with respect?
It's far from an appropriate response, but Malfoy's order makes the fine hairs on Harry's arms and the back of his neck stand on end. Grabbing his notepad and holding it completely coincidentally and innocently in front of his crotch, Harry hurries from the lecture hall and to his office.
Draco wraps his hand around his cock, fists it once, twice, and then he's shaking, shuddering. Come splashes against Harry's cheek, his extended tongue, the soft curve of his open mouth. "
," Harry says, eyes dragged back down to the parchment like it has its own gravitational pull. "So I didn't let the potion simmer for the full twenty minutes. He got better. This,"—he waves the parchment—"
Oh, stop it with that blushing miss act. I've seen you watching me as I've paced around this room. Those porters aren't the only ones with glorious thighs, and you've been staring at mine since I told you about Frankie or whatever his name was. This bit in the middle is just as good, by the way. Just a thick, just as powerful. You can see how it fills my hand, can't you? Do you want to touch?
Malfoy gestured vaguely at the bottles arrayed along the back wall. "Whatever is fine. Whisky. Ogden's 18, if you have it. But well is fine."
"I'm going to take that as a compliment, Potter, and you can't stop me." Draco slides a bit deeper into his chair, letting memory sweep over him. "I wasn't surprised when they arrested me, not really. I'd been expecting it after they came for my father. Something about their eyes as they took him away… The magical cuffs burn, did you know that? I thought my hands were going to fall off, it hurt so badly. But then they took them off, and they told me what they needed me to do, and that, somehow, hurt more. No one had ever asked me to be a hero before, and here was the Ministry and the Head Auror, begging me to help them.
Potter moves like lightning. A quick strike, too fast for Draco's eyes to make out except for the shadow he leaves behind. A spell slashes over Draco's shoulder, and he falls into a body roll. The asphalt tears against his shoulder, and there's blood dripping down his upper arm as he scrambles to his feet. For a moment, he thinks there's enough space between the wall and Potter that Draco could dart past him, but then Potter's screaming "
"I didn't tell you you could close them." Harry digs his fingers into the reddening flesh. "I don't want to get the cage."
Draco shakes the surprise from his mind and puts on the comfortable role of spoiled rich brat. "Malfoy. I've a reservation."
"Good evening, sir," he says, his gloved hands held together in front of him. "May I have your name, please?"
"But not yet." When he goes to steal another chip, she slaps his hand away. Shaking it until the sting subsides, he frowns. "And anyway, I'm concerned about the quality of clientele they've been letting in lately. My last visit started off entirely out of the usual."
He's nearly there when a familiar voice hollers his name, sharp and pointed, down the hallway. Glancing over his shoulder, he stops walking and waits for Pansy to catch up.
Cursing, Draco helps Harry pull his trousers and pants down around his thighs. Draco's prick is just as lovely as it had been that night, but this time, Harry doesn't freeze, doesn't stutter his way into action. Instead, he presses a kiss to the heavy vein running on the underside of it, then licks his way to the tip before swallowing the whole thing down.
He doesn't see it when the key passes into Draco's hand, but he feels it. The magic in the cuffs blazes, and he curses as they burn his flesh. He'd been unconscious the first time, left only with the magically healed scars around both wrists. This time, he watches as the flesh burns away, Lucius's name removed with it, and then heals a moment later. A scar in the shape of
Draco does as he's told, catches a glimpse of the woman they're trailing, then immediately turns back to Potter.
Draco's dragged out of sleep by Potter's voice. It's quiet, just barely there, but Draco's spent years living with danger and he never sleeps deeply.
Groaning, he thrusts into Harry's hand, the drag of his palm eased by Draco's spunk smeared across it. Fire lights Draco up from the inside out, whipping through his bloodstream like an unholy beast made of lava and flame. It boils his blood, sears his flesh, until all that's left is a burnt out husk, the shaking remains of whatever he was before Harry wrenched Draco's orgasm from him like steel throwing sparks against flint.
And when Harry travels the short distance from his prison to the bathroom, when he pulls his dirty clothes from his body, he knows Draco is watching.
"That's," Malfoy pants, his head thrown back against the shower wall, teeth gritted and bared, "one for me."
"You're in luck, then." Draco readies another cup, then stands in silence as the kettle warms on the hob. It rattles when the water starts boiling.
Pale skin suddenly flushed, Draco drops Harry's gaze, his chin falling to his chest. "Well." He coughs softly. "My apologies, then. And thank you."
His fingers tangle in the fabric of Harry's vest, dragging at it until it bunches up around his armpits. Laughing, Harry draws away, arms raised, and lets Draco tear the thin cotton from his body. His bared chest is covered with scars, ones that Draco knows the origin of and others he doesn't. Fingers trembling, he lets them touch what only his eyes have dared brush against. The oval, just off-center on Harry's chest; the great slice that goes from right pectoral down along his obliques to end above his waistband; a starburst just over his hip bone. Draco traces them with purpose, and Harry shivers before pulling him back into another heated kiss.
One more stripe lands across Harry's glasses, obscuring his view of Draco's hooded eyes. As Harry licks his lips clean, he tips over himself, his own release spattering against the floor and the toe of one of Draco's neatly polished Oxfords.
Malfoy is an understated, if enthusiastic, lecturer. The intensity of his voice draws Harry in, and though he's never been much for potions, Harry finds himself captivated. Something about the way that Malfoy explains the intricacies of brewing and the various interactions between the ingredients and the cauldron, and the way that the heat and magic brings it all together, grabs Harry's interest and doesn't let it go. He's bloody
"It's not a joke, though. Honestly. I, uh,"—Harry scratches at the back of his head and can feel his cheeks heating—"I'd really like to get to know you better."
Harry isn't quite sure how to explain it, but he feels an itch beneath his skin that he can't scratch. He goes to classes, attends his Advanced Defense training, wanders the grounds, but nothing seems to ease the tension thrumming under his skin. It flares whenever he sees Malfoy, though he seems to be avoiding Harry lately. Ever since he sat across Malfoy's thighs and… well, Harry can't fault the man for avoiding him after that. Competition aside, it was a bit… much. Shame and a sickly wanting twist in Harry's gut when he remembers that night. He can't figure out if he's disgusted with himself or if he just wants to do it again.
The longer he stares at Malfoy's cock, though, the more Harry can't look away. He knows he should. This whole fiasco is probably skirting the edges of sexual harassment or something. But as Malfoy's elegant fingers move easily up the thick shaft to twist at the end with brutal efficiency, Harry's eyes refuse to move.
"It is done," Voldemort hisses, and the reminder of Harry's capitulation, his surrender, makes him shiver. "He's yours now, Draco. Do not take my gift for granted."
The touch on his mouth is gentle. "You have something I want. Something I'm coming to realize I desperately need. But you can't give it to me like this." Those fingers trail up Harry's face and rest on the thick fabric of the blindfold. "You need to see me, to
They're leaving the Great Hall after dinner one night, everyone else filtering out before them, and Malfoy bumps into Harry's back as they pass through the doors.
"Shut up. Anyway, he kept gloating about it, so I challenged him to a rematch. That's all that was."
"It's okay, mate. He's still a bit of a prat, but he's not as bad as he was in sixth year. Honestly, I'm surprised it took you two this long, the way you've always been about him." Ron reaches across the table to put his hand over top of Harry's and squeeze it comfortingly. "I accept you and your sexuality, Harry, even if your taste is terrible."
"Point to you, Potter," Malfoy says as he examines the mess on his fingers. He arches his damned eyebrow and draws his hand closer to his mouth, lips parted and pink tongue visible.
"I'm going to do something," he says as he squares up with Harry, "and I want you to promise me you won't punch me."
"So once we're able to prove that Muggle techniques, like fingerprinting, can be used in combination with Magical means, then I've got a proposal ready to go for integrating DNA testing into our standard procedures. I already talked to the Muggle Prime Minister, and he's on board with granting the DMLE access to their centralized databases. Combined with what we can already do with Magical traces, I think it will be a revolution in the way that policing is performed in Magical Britain."
He's having a similar problem, the collar of his robe sticking to his neck uncomfortably. Reaching back to quickly pull it away, he can't help the sigh that escapes when the slightly cooler air of the room slips into the space between fabric and skin.
Harry gets his opportunity for payback when he's returning from a late night Astronomy lesson. It's ice cold outside, even though term is coming to a close, and he's desperate to get out of his heavy cloak and under his heavier blankets.
They stayed that way for a long time, Harry petting Draco's hair, Draco breathing against Harry's pulse point.
But you know this already. I'm just rehashing the things you've already figured out for yourself. Harry Potter. Too precious for the Ministry to put on the street, too powerful to be lost to bureaucracy. So they tucked you somewhere between.
But this wasn't some wild one night stand. It wasn't a quick shag and then out the door. This was momentous in a way few things had ever been in Harry's life. This was something precious, something he had chosen for himself and sworn to keep safe.
Potter hisses something in reply, but Draco can't make out the words. It sounds like a curse, though, so Draco sends a light Stinging Hex into Harry's back. His body arches away, eyes shut and teeth gritted against the pain.
He didn't know when it had happened, but he fucking missed Malfoy. More than he ever thought he'd miss the prat. It was almost in the same way that he missed Ron and Hermione. The intensity of it was the same, the overwhelming desire to see him. Only with his friends, there wasn't the low heat in Harry's blood, the overly sensitive awareness that had Harry looking up whenever someone smoked Mayfairs nearby or wore brown leather across broad shoulders.
"You've been in the Muggle Outreach department for three months, and now you're the resident expert." Pansy rolls her eyes and waves a loaded fork at Draco. "Now, Professor, tell me what a Himbo is."
Draco's chair is loud as it scratches against the floor. A moment later, the leash around Harry's throat tightens. "Come, Potter," he says, and Harry's the only one that hears the terror in the words.
Leaving the man to his liquor, Harry finished getting the pub ready for the dinner rush. He rolled silverware, spoke with Robert — the middle-aged cook who worked the evening shift — and made sure the kegs were full. Through it all, Malfoy sipped quietly on his whisky and smoked.
Potter draws him closer, and Draco's feet drag against the pavement. He feels Potter's words against his face when he speaks. "I think, Draco Malfoy, that if you wanted to be free, you would be."
"You're…" Potter's eyes flash with a mix of disgust and desire. "Of course. I don't know why I thought…"
Now that his attention has been drawn to it, Draco has to agree. Their office is nice. A bit warm, for sure, but nothing like before. More of an early morning in summer when the air hasn't had a chance to truly reach scorching but is tinted with the flavour of it, a metallic tang in the back of his throat that hints at what's to come. Draco shrugs out of his robe, which is still a bit too heavy, even for the more reasonable climate. But as he settles it over his arm, he feels the temperature tick up a notch, a rush of heat that has him frowning in response.
Harry clenches his teeth and yanks his thoughts away from that. There's a warning heat pooling in his gut, a navel-deep pull not unlike Apparition but infinitely more pleasant, and while he doesn't really
"I'd wondered," the man says, "if this was something you and I had in common. I had my theories, back when we were younger. I watched you, you know."
Draco removes his vest at some point, tossed haphazardly away while they desperately try to keep their hands on each other. It's a fumbling, sweaty mess, but neither of them care, focused solely on the challenge of being as close to the other as possible. Harry's cock is firm and hard against the dip of Draco's hips, and when he shifts to the right, his prick rubs up against that firm ridge. They both groan at the caress. Draco thrusts are slow and steady, and even though his prick chafes against his sweat-soaked pants and trousers, he can't stop himself from chasing the pleasure of Harry's body against his own. It's too much. He burns with it. If he could, he'd immolate from this alone. But when Potter's fingers touch the buckle of Draco's belt and his lips part to murmur, "May I?" as if politeness is what's needed in this moment rather than expediency, Draco curses and fumbles for it himself.
Groaning, Harry opens his mouth wider and lets Draco pull his cock free. Spit trails from Harry's mouth to the tip of Draco's prick, but before he can wonder at it, Draco's sliding past Harry's lips again and to the back of his throat.
"Of course not," Draco says as he turns his eyes to the cold cases still scattered across his desk. "I only want the Prada."
"I believe that means Greg's lost," Blaise offers helpfully as he takes the bottle from Malfoy. "Longbottom, you're in, yes?"
Pushing past the fear, Harry wrapped his fingers around Draco's cock and squeezed. It punched a groan from Draco's throat, and he thrust into Harry's fist, eyes shut and the corners dotted with tears.
they cast clearly not enough to stand up to whatever weather front has been unleashed on their workspace. One woman is sobbing over a pile of ruined ledgers, her snot-muffled voice moaning about ruined balance sheets and income statements. A man far ahead of her in the queue is covered in a thick layer of snow that has yet to melt, even though he's been there much longer than Draco, who's near the very back and would be annoyed if it weren't for the fact that the hallway is relatively temperate.
"Maybe not on the bathroom floor, though," Harry says. His toes are numb, and he knows he's going to be stumbling for more than one reason when he finally stands. "Could I take you to dinner sometime?"
"All those years," Potter says as he reaches around Draco's front to open his fly and yank his trousers and pants down, "all those years at Hogwarts, I thought of this. Thought of your arse and my cock buried inside of it."
Harry tilts his head back, eyes closed, and rain pours over his face. Mouth opening on a laugh, water spills over his lips and out the corners of his mouth, cascading down his face. Draco wants to lick the rain from Harry's skin, and the room grows humid. Steam curls around their feet, but Draco pays it no mind as he lets the rain wash his hands clean so he can grab Harry's face and draw his mouth back to Draco's. He drinks the rain from Harry's mouth, lets it pool between them as he rests his lips against Harry's.
Draco's hips rise at the thought, but he fights it back, muscles quaking. "I'm sorry. I won't do it again."
When Draco wakes up the next morning, Potter's waiting with two cups of tea and a somber expression.
has Harry's mind wandering, his hands are the worst form of distraction. They're graceful, almost delicate, but the surety with which he holds his chalk makes Harry think of those fingers pressed against a wand or Harry's skin. They're strong, supple. The more Malfoy writes on the board, the more Harry's desperation to feel Malfoy's touch on his body grows. He wonders if Malfoy would cradle Harry's cheek as gently as he writes potions components on the board.
The next day, Harry's dragged from his room and into a well-decorated bathroom by Crabbe and Goyle. They throw him, clothes and all, into the already filled tub. The hot water is scalding, and Harry hisses as it touches his skin. A moment later, the pristine water goes black with dirt.
"Be careful with him," she says, and Harry can't tell if she's talking to him or to the man in the room. She doesn't clarify before she leaves.
He washes the evidence of his pleasure away, drains the tub, waits for Draco and his manacles and his collar and the way he won't meet Harry's eyes, not for a long time after.
was well on its way to becoming a fixture in Godric's Hollow. People were in and out of the place throughout the day. Harry served a simple lunch for the working crowd during the week and always did a Sunday roast. The beer he served was local, the wine inexpensive but not bad, and the liquor on special after seven. There was always a crowd, though it never felt crowded. Cigarette smoke hung in the air with the conversation, and Harry moved through it all like a fish through water.
"I haven't!" Ron leans forward again, his voice quiet. "I heard the two of you the other night, in the dorm. It's not a big deal, honestly. Dean and Seamus have been at it for months now, and it's never bothered me none."
Harry works his hand over Malfoy's cock once, twice, and then twists his wrist one last time. Grey eyes slamming shut, Malfoy gasps as he comes.
Now that he doesn't have to worry about making a fool of himself, Harry's less cautious, less guarded.
Harry's laying on his mattress and watching Draco. It's been like this between them ever since that dinner. Draco, anxious and cagey whenever he's alone with Harry, and Harry, still and waiting, a predator stalking its prey.
Harry clapped Ron on the shoulder and told him not to worry about it. That night, though, as Harry lay in his new bed with his new sheets and his silent walls, he wondered if Ron would ever understand.
," Potter says with a laugh. "I wonder what other random nouns I can trick out of that clever mouth of yours."
Malfoy's eyebrow arches. "If you think that game is the only thing I'm better at than you, I do believe you need to pay closer attention."
It works for the first half-hour. He's got a good sweat going, and he's unzipped his hoodie to let the early spring air cool him down a bit. It flaps around his sides, the only sound other than the rhythmic slap of his feet on the ground. But as he draws closer to the entrance to the locker rooms built into the Quidditch stands, Harry's easy pace falters.
The pull-out couch was still open from the morning, and though its mattress was thin and the springs dug into Harry's back, he didn't feel anything other than searing pleasure as Draco threw Harry down, settled over his thighs, and then grabbed Harry's prick through his jeans.
"Undercover operative." Draco sighs. "I can't tell you much about the specifics. You don't have the security clearances for it, and all jokes aside, if I give anything away, they'll have my hide and yours, and I rather like where ours skins are currently. You happened to stumble into one of my operations, rather unfortunately, and now," he gestures around the safe house, "we're here."
"Fuck, Potter." He can't hold back the needy moans pouring from his mouth. His cock, still untouched, twitches meaningfully. "Oh, fuck."
Harry knew this was a bad idea two hours ago when Dean brought out a bottle of bootleg Firewhisky and started passing it around. Now, he finds he doesn't care nearly as much.
Draco stands a moment later, his expression unafraid. "My father speaks out of turn. Of course, we will continue to house Mr Potter. No harm will come to him while he's within these walls."
Harry finished with the glasses — there weren't many left — before turning around. His patron hadn't grabbed a seat as requested, but rather stood in the middle of the nearly empty barroom, hands in his pockets, his grey eyes somber and still on Harry.
"Grand larceny, breaking and entering, illegal possession of an unregistered wand, and that's just the six months after the war."
"For fuck's sake, Potter! I thought you cared more about your life than this! What about all of the people waiting for you out there, the people depending on you? Even if you don't give a damn about your life, you should give a damn about theirs."
Harry hated to admit it, but Malfoy looked good. His hair had grown out. It brushed the collar of his black turtleneck, which clung to a well-defined chest. He didn't bother to take off his brown leather jacket, and Harry watched its hem brush against Malfoy's thighs as he shifted his weight. His black jeans were tight enough that Harry could see him clench his hands.
This dumb competition is going to be over pretty fucking soon if Harry doesn't think of something else. Malfoy's licking his lips, and judging by the way he keeps opening his mouth and closing it, he's probably thinking of other filthy things to say. Filthy things like what he talked about in the shower, when Harry came so hard, he saw stars.
Cursing, Harry shook and shivered. His stomach was wet and sticky with come, and he kept his eyes on Draco's before trailing his fingers through his own mess and bringing them to his mouth. He sucked them clean, and Draco looked like the breath had been punched out of him as he came.
Harry doesn't try to stop the groan this time. He doesn't feel shame. Grey eyes flash, but then Draco is out the door, and Harry is left alone, his mind confused and his body aching.
Potter laughs. His eyes stay on Draco's mouth. "No, I suppose not. You're not a bad guy, are you, Malfoy? You can be good."
"Fuck," Harry gasps, his grip on Draco tightening as his breath punches out of him. "Fuck, Draco, I—"
"You've been so patient," he says as he touches the bunched muscles of Draco's thighs. Another soft caress that feels like pain. "It's been, what, thirty minutes? Forty?"
"Why him?" Harry moans before throwing the parchment onto his desk and leaning back in his chair. "He's got trainees teaching these classes most of the time. Why's he leading this one?"
"Of course." Draco looks around discreetly, hoping to see Potter's familiar shaggy hair somewhere in the tastefully crowded dining room but is disappointed when he doesn't see anyone even slightly resembling the prat. Draco should have known better. "I will see myself out, then. Thank you."
Harry frowns as Ron continues idly with his paperwork. Of course Harry expected something after his Enervating Draught had caused Jefferies some… problems. But he'd expected a slap on the wrist or a week's probation, not an order to attend a seminar designed for Trainee Auror's fresh out of school and needing remedial training on their basic potions skills. A seminar taught, this time, by the Ministry's Head Potioneer.
Draco's thrusts against Harry's stomach grew more frantic, less measured. His hands shaking, Harry took one from Draco's waist to the fly of Draco's trousers, then stilled.
He's grabbed two wallets and a watch so far, and he's halfway through taking a woman's mobile from where it hangs out of her too-small back pocket when he feels eyes on him. Moving his hand away carefully, he puts it by his side and takes a step away.
"Took you long enough, young man. I believe there's a lot I need to catch you up on. I doubt that gentleman of yours will want to wait long for your return."
"We've got to get you out of here," Draco says as he paces Harry's cell. "It's only a matter of time before someone slips up and you get hurt or, worse, killed." He reaches for his hair as if he's going to run his fingers through it, then throws his hand aside. "I wish you would act like you gave a shit about this."
As the light fades, Potter groans. It's the first noise he's made since they crashed through Draco's wards, which Draco takes to mean he hasn't scrambled Potter's brains any worse than they already were. He grabs a blanket off of the nearby couch and throws it over Potter's body.
Harry's going to hell. He's going to hell immediately. Even with all of the good he's done in his life, he's never going to overcome the impure thoughts racing through his head at the sight of Draco Malfoy looking like an academic wet dream in a room full of barely legal adults. He's thankful he put on a pair of comfortable denims instead of the joggers he'd considered briefly, as there'd be no way he could hide the stiffening line of his cock in those. Shifting in his seat, he does his best to adjust himself without drawing attention to himself.
So, Draco does what he always does in these situations and decides to brazen it out. Though he's a bit out of breath, and he really doesn't have the time for it, he takes out a cigarette and lights it with a bit of wandless magic. He's barely gotten half of an inhale when the man appears around the corner.
"This is the end of it," Draco says, voice thick with anger and tears. "Now that he's dead, it's all over. You're over."
Draco kissed him, though it was off-center and more smile than caress. "It's very funny. You'd think you'd never done this before."
Eyes open and unflinching, Harry tries to memorize what Draco Malfoy looks like as he comes, as he falls apart. It's the most beautiful thing Harry's ever seen, and though it's over much too soon, Draco pulling away and leaving a smear of come and spit across Harry's face, Harry knows he'd do anything to see it again.
Draco's cock hardens as Potter pulls his hand away. He spits, and the sound shouldn't be erotic, but it is. When Potter's fingers return, they're wet and insistent.
And I supply those goods. I pay the taxes, the tariffs. And yes, there are other names on the manifests and other captains on those ships, but we both know who they really work for, who's really in charge of that great lumbering beast of commerce.
Groaning, Harry shakes Ron quickly, then pulls him into another quick hug. "Fine, you bastard. I'll see if he wants to get a coffee. What's the worst that could happen, yeah?"
He offered them to Draco, then watched as he went through the familiar motions of pulling the cigarette from the pack and sliding it between his lips.
The maître d' shows them to what is likely the best table in the house, then offers them both menus. Draco isn't entirely sure when the man picked them up or if he was hiding them somewhere in his jacket, but as he handles the thick cardstock, he's again impressed by the quality of the restaurant. As he starts looking through the offerings for the evening, an eyebrow raises without his consent.
," slips out when he undoes Draco's trousers. When Potter puts his mouth on Draco's cock, Draco buries his fingers in Potter's hair and breathes out "
Confused and rapidly growing irate, Harry takes a seat. "You're going to have to enlighten me here, Malfoy. I don't remember doing a damned thing, other than what you told me to."
prisoners. Sure, he'd been pardoned, partially because of Harry's testimony, and he'd been on his best behavior over the last year. The war had shaken some of the brat out of him, too, so he's not really that bad. Just a bit sarcastic, a bit sharp with his wit, which, if Harry's going to be honest, he kind of likes. Malfoy had taken up running and was out on the Quidditch pitch most weekends, working on his skills as a Seeker, and Harry had seen him in the showers that one time, his towel low on his hips, two dimples right above the globes of his arse, water still dripping down the long, even line of his spine…
"Do your best to keep the fawning to a minimum, ladies and gentlemen. Now, if you could get your note taking supplies out, we shall begin."
"Rather strange for you to be in a pub, then." Harry gestured to the stools lined up in front of the bar. "Have a seat. First drink's on the house."
Malfoy puts his hand on Harry's waist, and that's what does it. Malfoy's fingers against Harry's sweaty skin. As pleasure rips through him, Harry's head falls forward into the curve of Malfoy's neck, and he curses into Draco's neck as Harry's release shakes every bone in his body.
"Do you really want to know the answer to that question or do you want to know what I've been thinking since you left?"
Harry pulled an ashtray out from beneath the bar and set it in front of Malfoy. After the man pulled a cigarette from his pack, Harry flicked his fingers, then offered the blue flame pinched between his thumb and forefinger to Malfoy. Pale eyebrow raised, he leaned forward and lit his cigarette.
Harry curses quietly, then steps up to a free urinal and pisses as a way to kill time. The man finishes up, washes his hands, and hurries out, somehow picking up on Harry's irritation. Wordlessly and wandlessly, Harry locks the bathroom door, tucks himself away, and washes his hands. Leaning against the counter, he crosses his arms and waits.
All I ask is that you let a few shipments get through unnoticed, unexamined. Fudge a few lines in those great ledgers of yours. And in return, I will give you exactly what you want. Exactly what you've been wanting after ever since you put Voldemort in the ground.
"Right. So you're not gazing with longing at one Harry James Potter, Senior Auror and Ministry Golden Boy?"
"Well," Malfoy says as he runs his lips up Harry's neck, nipping at Harry's earlobe. "It seems like I've done an awful lot on my own." He tangles his fingers with Harry's, then brings Harry's hand to his still-hard prick. "I think you should lend me a hand."
Dying is nothing in comparison to the pain Harry feels knowing what he's forcing Draco to do, what it'll do to him in turn.
Monday morning comes much too quickly for his liking, and though he's uncertain if Building Services have managed to make any progress over the weekend, Draco does his best to be optimistic about things.
Draco kisses him quiet. Though he doesn't have much room to maneuver, he gets a grip on Harry's cock and gasps. It's long and thick, like a firebrand in his hand, and Draco curses himself for not undoing Harry's trousers properly. He wants to see it, so though it nearly hurts to let Harry go, Draco does, but only as long as it takes him to finish undoing Harry's trousers.
"Oh, sit down, Potter. You're still slightly concussed, and I don't have the skills to fix you twice." As Potter falls, defeated, onto the couch, Draco makes his way into the kitchen to start the kettle again. "How do you take your tea?"
"What're you doing tonight?" Potter repeats. "I'm running reconnaissance tonight, and I need someone who's familiar with Muggles and authorized as a consultant for the Auror Department. Normally I'd ask Finch-Fletchley, but he's running an op in France at the moment, and Lavender's out sick. I checked the duty roster, and you're the last person on the list."
The man walks over to a white marble stand, looks down at it for not nearly enough time to read anything, then comes back to where Draco's waiting, that placid, perfect smile still on his face.
"Explain to me," he says, probably not for the first time, but Draco hasn't been paying attention, "why we're stuck here."
For the last five years, Auror Draco Malfoy has walked into his office with hardly a glance at the illusioned window taking up the back wall. It looks out over an imagined London, a perfectly bright and brilliant view of the city that hides the smog and rain and dirt that clings to the city like a patina of time that can never be worn away. It's always a perfect summer's day with soft, white clouds that float through the painfully bright blue sky like a dream. He likes to imagine the gentle breeze that ripples the surface of the Thames brushing across his skin, since he'll never be able to actually feel it. After all, his office is located on the second floor and is, therefore, underground.
Draco puts his hand on the back of Harry's head, holds him still as Draco starts thrusting, hesitant, almost as if he doesn't want to. Harry tilts his head back, opens his throat, waits for the brush of Draco's cockhead to cut off the flow of air. The collar around his neck tightens each time Draco's bottoms out, and Harry tries not to think about how much he likes the feel of it, the press of leather against his skin as Draco fucks Harry's face.
"And the emotions in the room are how it's triggered," Harry says carefully. "So when someone's angry, there's thunder."
Harry reaches for his wand, murmurs and spell, and as soon as Draco hears the low humming, he nearly thrashes away.
Harry took him out to a nice dinner. He bought expensive wine, fed him good food. Let Draco drive the conversation, and happily followed wherever his nimble, intriguing mind wanted to go. Desert had been shared, a piece of decadently rich chocolate cake with a ganache that clung to the corner of Draco's mouth the way Harry wanted to.
"Isn't it?" When Draco takes his hand back, Harry's grip slips away easily. "You said it yourself. You're surprised I went into Muggle outreach. Doesn't matter that I'm damned good at my job or that I've learned to respect and admire the Muggles for their ingenuity. It's still a shock that someone like me would bother with them at all."
Draco's hands are tied behind his back, the rope carefully looped about his ankles so that if he shifts, it draws tighter. He's naked and covered in sweat, and as he shifts his weight, his cock bobs obscenely before him.
Spread your legs. That's a good boy. You can feel it there, can't you? Pressed up against your calf? There are other places I could put it, ones that would feel much, much nicer.
"It's too much," he says before gently petting Harry's head. "You're too much. Gods, you're a fucking mess, Potter."
But it was those trips that made me think to buy my own ship. Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious. It was plain enough for Mother to not suspect, and I had a very thorough business plan. Simple runs across the Channel. Wizarding goods from the Continent, brought weekly to England until the demand outstripped our pace and I had to buy another, larger ship and switch to daily travails.
It makes Harry laugh, though the sound holds no happiness in it. Draco grabs Harry's shoulder and turns him around, forcing him to meet Draco's eyes. They're as bright as steel and just as cutting. "Knight to Queen Four."
"Brilliant. You need any help with drying charms?" Weasley lifts his foot and shakes water free. "I can help."
Which is how he comes while looking straight into Malfoy's eyes, nearly spilling Malfoy's name from his lips as come spills from his prick.
It's different than the other times. Something about the sunlight creeping through the trees, the dappled light playing on Malfoy's skin, the buzz of insects in the distance. Harry smells sweat and green earth, and he can't stop looking at Malfoy. Can't stop looking at his hand and his prick, his muscled arms, his pink tongue darting out to wet his lips, his grey eyes turned nearly black by the blown-wide expanse of his pupils.
Still frowning, Harry stands up and turns to the bookshelf behind his desk. He reaches up, competent fingers running over the line of folders neatly tucked into the top shelf. "I don't even know how you can see it."
Malfoy's holding the shower curtain open, his eyebrow raised (as if it ever isn't) and a smug grin on his face. "Am I interrupting?"
Harry runs his fingers over the head of his prick, pulls his foreskin back, then repeats the motion. It's a bit too much stimulation, staying that focused on his cockhead, but Malfoy can't look away. His hand speeds up on his own prick, and Harry bites the inside of his cheek to stop himself from blowing his load at the site.
Harry's still trying to come back to reality, his mind wiped away by orgasm, when Draco falls onto his knees next to him and captures his panting mouth in a kiss. Harry loses himself to it, to the gentle push and pull of Draco's mouth against his own, the ache of his swollen lips eased by the slow and delicate brush of Draco's lips. It's as easy as the blow job had been hard, but they both settle something in Harry's chest.
"You think you know what I feel, Potter. You think you understand what's going on in my head, the things I don't say. You look at me like you look at any of your other patrons, and you think, 'ah, Malfoy. I understand. I know what he's about.'" He pointed his finger at Harry, his hand shaking with anger. "But you don't. You
"It is my favourite topic." She points at him with a chip. "And you had your turn talking about Potter yesterday."
Harry nods, then waits for Malfoy to lead the way. He doesn't say anything as they walk, only puts his hands into his pockets and watches as the treeline grows nearer. Once they step into the shadowed overhang of the trees, he glances at Harry, then glances away again.
Though there's barely enough space between the table and the side chair, Draco lays down next to Potter, who pulls Draco's head to his shoulder and starts threading his fingers through Draco's hair.
His hatred, and the never-ending question of why Potter had bothered to save him from the blazing ruin of the Room of Requirement instead of letting Draco burn.
"It's this damned heat!" Angrily shoving his chair in under his desk, he grabs his robes, and even though they're heavy and threaded through with warming charms, he puts them on. He can't bloody well storm into Building Services without looking his absolute, official, best. "I'm going to give someone a piece of my mind about this. It was perfectly fine until you arrived, and then it was like someone decided our office needed to be a bloody oven."
More heat, and another confused glance from Ron before he nods and steps into the hallway. He casts a quick charm on his shoes, then reaches for the door before pausing. "You want me to leave it open? It's gonna get pretty muggy in here if I shut the door."
"Not just your emotions, everyone's. The windows, they're keyed to the occupants of the room, right? Only problem is that Building Services adjusted the spellwork behind them a few weeks ago, over the weekend, and they mucked it up. Instead of just
"No one." Draco's words come out as a croak, and though he wants to tear at the painful press of Potter's arm, he keeps his hands loose by his sides. "Honestly, Potter. I wasn't looking for you in a bloody Muggle bar."
Green fire lances through him, Potter's eyes like a dagger piercing his skin. Draco undoes another button and another until his shirt hangs open around his chest, his own sweat-stained vest visible. He carefully pulls the shirt free of his trousers, then stands so he can more easily slide it from his shoulders.
His lips are lax and open in surprise, which means that Draco can taste the man long before he's ready for it. Still, he's taunted by that hint of humid warmth, and his tongue darts out to touch Potter's lower lip. It drags a groan out of Potter's throat, a wrenching, tearing sound like the roots of a great tree pulling free from the earth, and then Potter's fingers are digging into Draco's hair, tangling around the sweat-dampened strands and pulling him closer. There's no resistance in his body, all of it melted by the heat of Harry's mouth and his hands.
Dean and Seamus aren't even trying to win. They keep giving each other meaningful glances, licking their lips, and leaving their mouths wide open as they breathe. Harry expects they would've been all over each other if there hadn't been an audience. Even that vague hope is beginning to fade the longer Dean stares at Seamus like he's something edible, and Seamus keeps leaning closer and closer towards Dean.
"Yeah, but your office… It was…" He frowns again. "I guess it's still warm in here, isn't it? But why… Oh, well. Look, Parkison figured it out. She's a bloody evil genius."
They're standing so close that Harry can feel Malfoy's panted exhalations. Dizzy with desire, Harry bends in closer, close enough that his nose brushes the curve of Malfoy's shoulder. He rests in that almost-touch and breathes in the sweat-fresh scent of Malfoy.
"Harry." Draco's fingers traced the edge of Harry's eyes, the curve of his cheek, the line of his jaw. "Harry, please. Don't cry, love."
The maître d' is bowing his head when a voice breaks out over the quiet din of polite conversation and clinking porcelain.
He fucks Harry's mouth with a methodical determination that shouldn't be as hot as it is. But Draco's grey eyes are steady on Harry's face, his fingers holding Harry's head in place as he fucks into Harry's mouth. Harry holds onto Draco's thighs to feel the muscles there jumping with each thrust. Mind blurring, body aching, he lets himself be used, barely noticing his own, painful arousal.
It's a simple prospect. You control the ports. You control the flow of goods in and out of Wizarding Britain. You charge the taxes and inventory the storehouses. All of it, within the palm of your calm and confident hand.
Blinking against the light, Harry takes in the man's shoes. Black leather and well-made, but lacking in ornamentation. He trails his gaze up, following the well-tailored trousers that encase long, lean legs. His white shirt is tucked into his waistband, though a bit of it has come undone. His hands rest by his sides, well-formed and loose. Harry wonders how they'll feel when wielded against him when they beat pleasure from his body.
Harry blurts out, "Coffee," and watches as Malfoy's stern expression is washed away by confusion. "Do you like coffee?"
"Maybe I didn't fix that head of yours enough," Draco says as real concern starts pooling in his gut. "You feeling okay, Potter? What year is it?"
." Malfoy's eyes dart from Harry's to his mouth, then back again. Almost unconsciously, Malfoy licks his lips. "Are you looking for a rematch, Potter?"
It doesn't take Harry long to realize that they have no idea what to do with him. They keep him fed and watered, but whenever his guards linger outside his cell, it's with a sense of uneasy, temporary glee. Though he's the one locked up, they're afraid.
"I am sorry about the show," Draco says as he washes Harry's hair three days later. "But he has to believe that you're nothing more than an amusement to me. If he suspected anything else…"
"I don't need your permission to dress down, Potter," Draco says. "And I haven't worried about a uniform violation since I was a Junior Auror."
Harry trailed after them, smiling good-naturedly as they complained about the score and the refs and the players. Once the last one left, he closed the door and locked it with a sigh.
Harry runs his hand over his beard and tries not to think of Draco's skin there only a moment before.
Ron, who clearly wants to win this thing, has his eyes shut and has picked a pace like a marathon runner's. It's steady, even, unflinching. If Harry weren't praying to somehow wipe the image of Ron's hand on his prick from his mind without inducing brain damage, he'd be impressed.
The next time Voldemort comes to visit, Draco puts a leash on Harry and forces him to crawl around like a dog. He feeds Harry scraps from the table, forces Harry to lick gravy and cream from Draco's palm and from between his fingers. After he wipes Harry's spit from his skin, he tangles his fingers in Harry's hair and forces him to look up. His grey eyes flashing, he whispers, "Good boy," before shoving Harry to the ground.
"You bloody idiot," Draco moans, rocking the both of them back and forth. "You fucking inconsiderate bastard. How dare you make me fall in love with you."
It thankfully doesn't bother Potter, who's kept his eyes down on his own work since Draco removed his robes. The small stack of papers that Draco gave him earlier hasn't shifted very much, which is only further proof that Potter can't be trusted with the admin. Sighing, Draco pushes his glasses back up his nose, rolls the ache out of his shoulders and neck, and grimaces as his shirt sticks to his back. He lifts the front of it away from his chest, trying to vent some of the trapped heat of his body and failing. For a brief, barely lucid moment, he considers undoing the top button, but then he comes to his senses. It might be hot in the office, but he's not quite to that point of desperation.
"I don't mind stopping." Malfoy's feet come into Harry's view, and when he looks up, Malfoy's eyes are dark and considering. "You'll want to walk for a bit, though. Cool down."
"So good," he says as Potter's throat closes around the head of Draco's cock. "Fuck, your mouth was made for me, wasn't it? It's so good, Potter. You're so good."
So it started at Immingham, and it followed me to London and Southampton and Liverpool. Every time my boots hit land, there your men were. After that first time, they never got close enough to touch me, though. It's something you always failed to notice about me, Potter, ever since we were children. You spent all your time with that Granger girl and thought you knew who the most intelligent person at Hogwarts was.
Harry puts his knee onto Malfoy's mattress, then lifts himself up and onto the bed. Shutting the curtain behind him, he casts a more robust privacy charm, then starts undoing his belt. "I think it's time for round two, Malfoy."
He's on display tonight, though he can't see how big of a crowd he's drawn. The blindfold over his eyes is charmed to remove his ability to see, but Harry has his eyes closed anyway. It eases something in him when he submits. He doesn't have to worry about what's coming next.
Draco laughs and slides his wrist free from Harry's slackened grip. "You don't want to talk to me, Potter."
When Harry pulls Draco's cock from his pants, it's still soft. For a moment, Harry's afraid that Draco will stay soft, that he doesn't want Harry the way that Harry wants him, but there's no time for fear, not with everyone watching.
Harry shivers and looks at his darker skin against Malfoy's blood-flushed cock. Almost as if in a haze, he wraps his fingers around it, feeling the heft and weight of it with an illicit thrill.
Hands suddenly unsteady, he unfastens Draco's belt and starts undoing his button fly, all while Draco trails his fingers through Harry's mess of curls, pushing them back to reveal his eyes and his scar. Draco's thumb trails across the top of the bolt, just for a moment, then comes to rest at the hinge of Harry's jaw.
"We should probably time it. Wouldn't be fair otherwise." Ron looks around for his wand. "I'll cast a
"Did the Ministry owls not find you?" Weasley pushes his hair back, eyes wide. "I'll take that blank stare as a no, then. It's the windows." He falls into the chair opposite Draco's desk, his long legs stretched out before him and crossed at the ankles as he settles down to defrost. "Something about them's messing with the climate control spells. The whole Ministry is a mess."
"A Himbo," Draco says with confidence, "is similar to a Harpie. They're only male, and they're possessed of spectacular physical stamina and beauty. The most famous of them is one called Fabio, who became an icon for Muggle literature during the 1980's and started the restoration of the Himbo species. They're much more common these days, even considered no longer endangered by some experts. But," he gives her a pointed look, "there is one particular downside to them. While they are physically perfect specimens of male beauty and generally kind and docile, they are, without exception, complete and utter morons."
When the man pulls away, the knots stay tight. Harry's back is bent at an awkward angle, and his muscles are wrenched almost to the breaking point. Sweat covers his skin, and though he could have the bonds loosened with a word, he keeps his mouth shut.
Still and relaxed, Draco listens to Harry undress. The mattress dips under his weight, and then Harry's pulling Draco close against him. His body is so warm, so strong, and as Draco leans into it, he starts drifting off.
His shoulders ache. The ropes carefully looped around his wrists and forearms tightens every time he shifts his weight, and it's putting a strain on his joints. His rigger knows what she's doing, though, and he trusts her to keep him from injury.
He could see the moment Malfoy decided to do as he was told. The fight drained from his eyes, his expression turning to a soft, sad resignation that startled Harry with its depth.
"Should've guessed you'd be a size queen," Malfoy says, his head thrown back as Harry keeps running his fingers over Malfoy's cock. "Harder, Potter. You've seen me do it enough, you should know what I like."
Potter's got his feet up on the couch, his shoes on the floor next to it. There's something painfully vulnerable about the great Harry Potter in slightly tattered socks, his eyes closed and one arm thrown over his head. Draco coughs quietly, and Potter startles.
The levitation spell ends, and Draco nearly scrapes his face against the brick wall. Potter kicks his legs apart, and though his clothes keep Draco from spreading them as wide as they can go, it's enough room for Potter's hand to find Draco's crease and the pucker of his hole. His fingers are rough and broad, and when he breaches Draco with the tip of one, it stings.
His finger brushes up the underside of Draco's prick, and Draco has to grit his teeth to stop from screaming.
When Draco first joined the Ministry, he did it out of spite. He did it because he hated the Death Eaters. He did it because he wanted to destroy them the way they destroyed his family. His mother was insane, and his father was in prison, and all Draco had left was his hatred.
Harry was busy restocking glasses, wiping off the lingering condensation from his dishwasher, when the bell above the door chimed.
They'll be gone soon enough, though how depends on these next few minutes between us. Either I'll remove them, no harm, no foul, or my man outside will knock you unconscious, and he'll leave you unbound on the docks. Either way, those ropes won't be a problem for you much longer.
It's been awhile since Draco's had to use this house. He makes a cursory check of his supplies, confirms the water is still running, and then gets his first aid supplies from the bathroom cupboard.
"This was yours," Draco says before pressing something cold and metallic into Harry's hands. "They took it from you when you were captured, but I recognized his handwriting, and you should have it. It's yours."
Harry draws his thumb out, then replaces it with two fingers. Draco splits them apart with his tongue, gags as Harry presses down in the very back of Draco's mouth. Though he wants to spit them out, he fights against the reflex, softens his throat, breathes slow and easy, and Harry pushes his fingers another inch deeper.
Draco slams his palm over Harry's mouth before he can finish talking, just as Crabbe and Goyle walk into the bathroom.
He glares at her for a moment, then his eyes drift back to where they were. "Shut up, darling. You've no idea what you're talking about."
"We are aware of the problem and are doing our best to return all climate control and decoration back to their standard behaviour. We appreciate your patience during these trying times and will inform you via owl as soon as we have a solution."
Potter finds him three months later. This time, Draco's in the middle of a raid gone wrong. There are spells flashing around the room, and though he's safely hidden behind a heavy shipping crate, he knows he's got to get the hell out of there if he's going to keep his cover.
Draco glares at the pair, his hand still pressed over top of Harry's mouth. "Leave his clothes and get out."
"2004. Blair's the Muggle Prime Minister. I'm pretty sure you Apparated us wherever we are now. I was born on the thirty-first of July, 1980, and you're a bastard."
"Grab a seat wherever," he shouted, examining the glass for any specks or smudges before putting it down with the rest. "I'll be right over to get your order."
Silence, then Ron starts coughing. Suspiciously. When Harry moves his hands away from his eyes, he sees that Ron is trying to disguise his laughter as a bout of tuberculosis.
Harry finishes rinsing the last of the soap from his body, then listens carefully. It's late, and he doesn't hear anyone else getting ready to turn in for the night, so with a wandless
"You've really got to stop believing your own assumptions, Potter." He steps close enough to whisper in Potter's ear. "Now, I don't want any trouble from you. You're going to let me leave, you're not going to tell anyone you saw me here, and you're going to let Robards know that he should keep his hounds off of me if he doesn't want this all to go to shit. You understand?"
Potter sighs and shakes his head. "People are such idiots when it comes to sex." Draco has to agree, especially when Potter sighs against and starts pulling the tails of his shirt free from his trousers. "This is unbearable."
"I've got something you want, don't I?" Potter's wand twirls through his fingers, and the ropes around Draco's chest tighten, then ease. "And you've got something I want. Something I've wanted for a long time."
The way that Potter gulps it down is criminal, though. His throat shifts and flexes as he swallows, the condensation on the glass clinging to his fingers as he cradles it in his hand. When he finishes, he always lets out a low sigh of pleasure, a soft sound that is painfully loud in their too-small, too-hot office. Every time he drinks, he sighs, and Draco, sitting behind his desk with his sleeves rolled up and his glasses sliding down his nose from perspiration, feels it like that imagined breeze across the surface of the river. A tantalizing chill that isn't there, that he desperately wants to chase.
"Right." Draco looks at Potter, who helpfully shrugs. Trying to bend his voice towards polite dismissal, he says, "Well, thank you for letting us know."
. Where people talk shite about your homemade crisps — they're rubbish, Potter, and you should really take them off the menu — and give you guff about your football team, and if anyone thinks 'Oh, isn't he that bloke that defeated the most evil wizard of our times?' they forget about it because you've got a beard now and you're carrying a dirty dishrag on your shoulder like a sash. And I just…" He grew quiet, his anxious gaze settling in the distance, running from Harry's. "I see it, and I'm jealous, and I hate that. I've spent my entire life being jealous of you, and I thought I'd moved past it."
"Come in," Draco shouts. As the door opens, Draco's stunned by the cool breeze that flows in from the corridor. He hadn't realised how warm it had grown since he arrived.
"I startled you," Harry offers as his trousers gape open. "I can't imagine that you wouldn't have to start over after that."
"Yeah, I don't know about that, or about the rain. I was pants at weather magic when we covered it during eighth year Transfigurations. Anyway, if you two can be cordial, it should be fine in here until Building Services gets it fixed. They're saying two, maybe three more days to get every office fixed."
Harry's out of the bed and stumbling to his own before he can see if Malfoy actually licks it clean.
"I also like coffee. And I was thinking, perhaps, you might want to have some. With me. In the near future." As Malfoy's expression darkens, Harry founders. "Or not at all. Not at all is fine, too."
"Brilliant." Potter's eyes dart to Draco's throat. The room somehow grows warmer, though it might just be Draco and the feel of Potter's eyes on his skin. "That looks… Is it better?"
A moment later, ropes tangle around Draco's wrists and body, pinning his arms to his sides. He thrashes against them, hoping something might give, but Potter's magic is as strong as ever, and while Draco manages to roll onto his back instead of his front, he's no closer to escape than he had been when first chased after him.
As warmth fills Draco's palm and Harry bows forward under the strength of his orgasm, something cold hits Draco's shoulder. It's a tiny annoyance at first, but then there's more and more of it, wet and cold enough to sting. Dragging his too-heavy eyelids open, he stares into Harry's green, hazy eyes as their office goes from sweltering desert to torrential downpour.
As Draco settles into a chair, Potter groans again and finishes rolling onto his front. The blanket tangles a bit around his shoulders, and he pushes it away groggily. It's a losing fight for Potter, who ends up thrashing against the fabric to no avail.
He was nearly finished cleaning the barroom, with chairs sitting upside down on the tabletops, when a knock on the door startled him. Turning, he froze, a chair still in his hands, waiting to be set down.
"You know it does," he spits out, eyes screwed shut until Harry slaps Draco's thigh with meaning, and his eyes fly open again.
"I know you do. Don't think I didn't see you looking at everyone else's pricks that night. You couldn't help yourself. Didn't even skip Weasley's. But it was mine,"—he gives his cock a pointed squeeze that Harry swears he can feel even though Malfoy's hand is nowhere near him—"that did it best for you. This thick, hard prick and my hands stroking it. Did you wish they were yours, Potter? That you were the one touching me, instead of myself?"
"Would it make you feel better if I let you wax philosophical about what things Ginevra Weasley would like to do or have done to her in bed?"
"Pansy hates the cold," Draco says, just as confused as Weasley sounds. "The windows are configurable, aren't they? Just put in a request for different weather."
Malfoy was at the door, his face twisted in a scowl. Banging on the glass again, his words were muffled as he yelled, "Open the bloody door, Potter!"
"In the…" The implication hits Harry low in the gut, and his denims go tight. At this rate, his cock's going to fall off from the aerobics it's gotten up to today. "Okay. I'll see you Saturday, then."
He starts experimenting after that. Nothing serious, nothing as brutal and devastatingly good as the sharp crack in his skull when Malfoy's heel met bone. But he'll dig his fingers into his thigh as he wanks, hard enough to leave bruises. He squeezes his bollocks in his fist until just that is enough to make him come. One late night in the library, he finds a book on knot tying, and he takes it back to his bed and pants his way through the first three chapters.
Potter's hand is warm and gentle on Draco's back, his fingertips brushing against Draco's skin for just an instant. It sends heat pouring through Draco's body, and his muscles tense as he fights the urge to inhale sharply at the touch.
looks like someone took a high-end decorating magazine, threw some Michelin Stars at it, and then coated everything in a layer of gold leaf. Even the maître d' looks like he's been dipped in gold, his blond hair gleaming and his spectacularly starched and pressed uniform decorated with tiny metallic threads woven through the white. His smile is just as blinding, and Draco blinks at him dumbly as he approaches.
"Bygones and all that, then. I believe we've got a suspect that needs surveilling. Can't loiter in the restroom for the rest of the night."
"No." He takes another step closer and flicks his wrist, sending his wand falling neatly into his palm. "I didn't."
"No!" Harry nearly leaps across the table as he grabs Ron's hand. It doesn't do much to prevent the rest of the table looking at them, but as Harry keeps his death grip on Ron and doesn't say anything else, other people's interest fades. "No, you can't tell her."
"You dare speak to me in such a manner?" Voldemort stands, his thin, wasted form suddenly overpowering. "You think you know better than I, Lucius?"
With the rest of the students finishing up, Malfoy walks to the front of the class again, his voice booming out across the room. "Well done, everyone. It seems that you'll all be more than capable of brewing the simple potions you'll need to accomplish your work as Aurors. A gentle reminder that the Ministry Potions Dispensary has all field-issue potions on hand, brewed by certified Masters, if you do not feel up to the challenge. However, you should all be secure in the knowledge that your basic skills are more than capable of managing the job on your own, should you put your mind to it. I will be sending performance reviews to your Supervising Aurors by the end of the week. You are all dismissed. Have a lovely evening."
"I'm not who I used to be. I've worked hard to not be that petulant, ignorant child. But, as the world continues to prove to me, time and time again, that doesn't seem to matter. People look at me, and all these see is who I was, rather than who I am."
Draco was the first to move. He shifted, his knee digging into the back of the couch as his body leaned into Harry's. Even that slight touch was enough to make Harry gasp. But his breath stilled in his lungs as Draco moved again, climbing carefully, hesitantly into Harry's lap.
"Since I have to assume there's an expected window of time wherein the illicit activity will commence or the nefarious evil-doer will be present, I don't see as I have much of a choice. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a bit of research I need to finish before I leave for the day."
"Probably catching up on paperwork," he says with a wince. "If you wanted to keep me company, though…"
," Draco says lazily, waving his wand at Potter until the fractured glass knits back together. Potter's glare, slightly more focused now, locks onto Draco.
Harry's head lifts, and he feels the sudden urge to cover himself as Draco walks into the room. He hadn't felt shame before, but now it seeps into his bones.
Another gust of heat, and sweat gathers again on Draco's skin. His touch lingers on the hard line of his clavicle. Potter's eyes still. The room heats a fraction more.
Draco nods, tight and aching, but keeps his hands on his desktop. Sweat runs down the back of his neck, collecting in his collar, soaking the thin fabric until it sticks to his skin. "I'm fine right now, Potter, but thank you for turning a blind eye."
across the top of the frosted glass, and when Harry steps in after Malfoy, the door locks behind them with a quiet click.
"You speak French," is what he manages, though it comes out nowhere near a question and more a husky, shocked pronouncement.
Draco touches him again, and Harry closes his eyes against the pleasure of it. "You don't have to trust me. Just do as you're told."
Which brings us to our current circumstances. I do apologize for the bonds, but I know what kind of mischief you can get into, and I'd rather keep what remains of my looks.
"Don't trouble yourself over it, Potter. If you'll excuse me for a moment, I need to use the restroom."
"Of course he'll kill you." Draco's eyes are wide and wild. "He's the Dark Lord. His temper is completely unchecked. You'll… you'll look at him one day, and he'll hate the colour of your eyes, even though they're the same colour they've always been, and he'll cast the Killing Curse and be done with it. With
It's like the world pauses around them. The moment drags on, Potter's words ringing through Draco's head. His arms ache from the ropes, and his neck is starting to twinge as Potter's grip tightens. But underneath it all — under the pain, the fear, the dread — there's a frisson of excitement, of want.
Draco whirls away from Potter, his hands shaking as he tucks his shirt back into his trousers. "Yes. Now, if you'll excuse me, Potter."
The hand in his hair gentles then releases its grip. Harry's head drops forward, and the blindfold drops to the floor.
The world is full of mystery. Most of the time, it's the normal sort. Lovers gone missing, scientific discoveries on the brink of realization, secrets held tight in the center of a heart like a touchstone. There are millions of them every day, those brief moments of uncertainty that come with crossing a street or checking the weather.
They stumbled their way to it. Harry kept pulling at Draco's belt, and Draco kept trying to get Harry's vest over his head, and neither of them succeeded in doing much of anything other than falling all over each other.
Harry presses a kiss to Draco's head, laughing. "All's fair," he says before kissing Draco's hair again. "And we've still got a war to win."
The shifting stops. There's a quiet curse, then the quieter click of Malfoy's shoes on the tiled floor. Harry watches them step towards the door of the stall, pause as if taking a breath, and then step out of the stall.
"You're welcome to load the dishwasher if it'd help," Harry said, pleased when it startled a laugh from Malfoy. "Honestly, Malfoy, I don't think anyone cares about who you used to be as much as you."
Draco goes to step around Harry, but Harry grabs him again. This time, though, his fingers are wrapped around the breadth of Draco's forearm, the touch somehow more intimate than the one around his wrist had been.
"That's it." Another brutal thrust, and then Harry's mouth is on Draco's shoulder, his teeth biting down. "Ah, love. Draco."
Harry's hand brushes Draco's shoulder, and he tries to arch into the caress, but it's gone as soon as it arrives. Draco tilts his head to the side, searching for something, desperate.
"No," he says, and Harry feels the harsh exhale of the word against his ear. "Not like this. But I knew you before, Potter, and I never took you for a coward."
Draco melted then, softening in Harry's arms like a marionette with its strings cut. His hands wrapped around Harry's shoulders, and he pressed their bodies as close together as they could get. When their lengths brushed, just a barely-there pleasure, they both cursed, then angled their hips so that the next time, it was better.
"It's a natural response to physical stimulus, Potter. Don't fret over your virtue. I've no interest."
He looks down at his now soaked shoes, then back up at Harry and Draco in confusion. "Why's it all wet in here?"
"You should see how well you take me," Potter pants. "You should see the way your arse opens up around me. God, it's beautiful. You're fucking made for this. Made to be fucked."
"Door's locked," Harry says as he presses a kiss to the hollow of Draco's throat. "Why should I stop?"
He tests the Anti-Apparation wards. They're not the strongest he's ever encountered, but breaking through the damn things always gives him a headache. He looks down at Potter, unconscious and bleeding, and then considers the Dark Wizards who control this wharf, who definitely won't let Draco walk out with a prize like this. Cursing, he grabs Potter under his arms and drags his limp body so it's leaning back against Draco's chest, cradled between Draco's legs.
"I fucked you through a Floo when I didn't know who you were. Why wouldn't I want you to fuck my face, now that I do?"
Digging deep for his Gryffindor courage, Harry sits up on his knees and, in a rush, throws one of his legs over Malfoy's thighs. Straddling Malfoy isn't comfortable—Harry's trousers are tight around his thighs and his belt buckle is cold against his skin—but the shocked curse that tumbles from Malfoy's mouth is well worth the discomfort.
His clientele didn't regularly ask for the high end stuff, but Harry liked to keep it on hand for special occasions. So, while the glass was dusty, and it took Harry a minute to find it, he pulled out the bottle of Ogden's 18 and a tumbler and set them both on the bar.
As Malfoy's boot slams into Harry's nose and his body is flooded with pain and his mouth with blood, Harry realizes with a stricken panic that on the tail-end of the searing agony of bones snapping is the liquid curl of desire.
Harry freezes as excitement races through him. Hair standing on end, he throws his cloak onto his trunk, then sneaks over to Malfoy's bed. This close, he can hear the distinct sounds of hands on flesh, the shift of a body against sheets, and with a clear sense of victory, Harry slips his hand into the crack of Malfoy's curtains and pulls them aside.
Pansy takes a bite of food and chews thoughtfully. After swallowing, she nods. "You're right. He's a complete Himbo."
Mumbling something profane under his breath, Harry mirrors Draco's motions. There's just a bit too much friction, their sweat and excitement not enough to ease the burn of their palms against each other, but Draco can't be bothered to cast a lubrication spell. Instead, he distracts himself from the hint of pain by kissing Harry's shoulder, biting at the ridge of his clavicle, trailing his tongue up the jagged planes of his Adam's apple and chin. They kiss again, and Draco chases Harry's groans with his own. Frantic, desperate, they thrust and pull and tighten, and the room grows sweltering, boiling around them. He can't think. His world is narrowed to the circle of Harry's hand on his prick and the painful burn of air against skin. He smells smoke. They're going to burn the Ministry down around them, and Draco doesn't care.
Draco raises an eyebrow. "You'd best not let her hear you say that. She'll want it embroidered on a pillow."
you're fit, what with all of the"—he waves indistinctly between them—"that just happened. But I wasn't going to do anything, I swear."
"Oh yeah." Potter looks down at the menu, completely unaffected by Draco's words. "They offered a course in foreign languages as part of Auror training, and I decided to give it a try."
They both fumble for their joggers. Harry only pulls his low enough to get his prick out. He's never been a fan of running in boxers, and he knows the exact moment Malfoy realizes that Harry's been out here without pants this entire time. Cursing, Malfoy pushes his joggers to his knees and pulls his cock out from the slit in his boxer-briefs. They're black and tight around his thighs, and Harry's struck by the beauty of Malfoy's ruddied cock against all of that tight, inky black.
Why'd he say that? What in the world had possessed him to think that that level of honesty would be appreciated? It was ill-considered, ill-advised. If he could, he'd take them back, if it'd have Malfoy walking through the door of Harry's pub again.
Draco pushes his hair from his forehead—his hair potion is doing nothing against the onslaught of heat and sweat—and Potter groans. Glancing at him, Draco raises an eyebrow.
"What the hell is going on?" His voice echoes, and a moment later, Dumbledore opens one of his bright blue eyes and smiles.
Harry spits into his palm, and Malfoy does the same, staring Harry down as he does it. They both wrap their fists around their pricks at the same time, and then they're off.
He doesn't need any further encouragement to let his mouth fall open. It's as easy as breathing to lean forward and push his open mouth against the fabric-covered bulge of Draco's cock. It's still trapped within his pants, but Harry feels it jump at the contact anyway. Draco's hands wrap around the back of Harry's neck and pull him closer.
Seamus grins at Ron, then kisses Dean with what is probably too much tongue. It doesn't stop Dean from putting his hands on either side of Seamus's head to bring him closer.
"That's not—" Harry gasps, but it's too late. His orgasm slams through him, and as he bows into it, he falls forward into the scalding water and nearly brushes his hand against Malfoy's.
"No idea." Paper rustles. Ron's quill taps against the inkpot. "Better buckle up, though. He's going to be a right bastard about it, I'm sure."
Potter takes it, and even though there's plenty of paper between them, he places his fingers close enough that they brush Draco's. Again, heat lances through Draco, and he pulls his hand back carefully, doing his best to hide that he's been burnt by the touch.
Eventually, he remembers it with the lowering of a wand and the clasp of sweat-dampened fingers, hard and bruising around his wrist.
"No." Draco sets his tea down and meets Potter's eyes. "You were clearly speaking to yourself. I've enough manners to know better than to listen into a person's private conversations."
glows faintly. It draws out the planes of Malfoy's toned body, and Harry has to admit it's enticing. The subtle shift of light and shadow, the way Harry can see the careful tensing and relaxing of Malfoy's stomach as he runs his hand over his slick skin. Malfoy spreads his legs a bit before reaching down to fondle his balls, and Harry shivers at the sight.
Every few days, Voldemort drags Harry from his cell to be put on display. Chained and collared, he kneels in the middle of the dining room at Malfoy Manor while Voldemort's inner circle hesitantly eats dinner around him. Voldemort seems to take it as a joke, but everyone else's eyes are wary as his stay glued to the floor.
It's the smallest bit of a caress. Knuckles against knuckles. Nothing soft or gentle about it, just bones clacking into bones. But it makes Malfoy curse again before his eyes slam shut and his back arches, and he nearly sends Harry tumbling onto the mattress as he comes.
Draco waits for Weasley to continue, but as he looks at them with wide, excited eyes and doesn't say anything else, Draco's forced to admit that he's going to have to move things along if he's going to have any chance to get out of his wet… well,
up for most of his walk to the office, but with the new security protocols, he was forced to take it down about a street away. Casting a surreptitious Drying Charm before stepping in the lift, he sighs at the touch of warmth along his scalp. It chases away the lingering chill, leaving Draco with only the slight dampness on his greatcoat to remind him of the rainstorm outside.
Draco's cock goes from bored and limp to painfully at attention before the first lilting syllable falls from Potter's lips.
Draco walks a slow circle around Harry, who does his best to not flinch at the impartial inspection. "Get him a change of clothes," Draco orders. Crabbe and Goyle comply immediately, skittering from the room like the cockroaches they are.
"And when they're ready to kill you with a look, it's frigid." Weasley grins. "Apparently, I pissed Parkinson off recently, and she's been trying to freeze me out ever since."
Once the door shuts, the temperature starts to rise again. Now that Draco's aware of the problem, he can't ignore it. Potter looks perfectly content without his robes, though Draco thinks he can see a hint of sweat gathering on Potter's brow. The roots of his hair are just slightly darker than the longer strands, his fringe clinging to his forehead. Potter brushes them away, and Draco catches the slightly darker shade of Potter's shirt under his arms, sweat seeping into the thin material.
Harry's grip on Malfoy's wrist wasn't tight. It wasn't biting or rough. It was delicate, like someone picking the first flower of spring. A gentle touch, just enough to contain, to enfold.
His gut twists, but he keeps his mouth shut as he follows Malfoy into a small room off to the side of the class. Black letters spell out
After a week of punishing heat, Draco is thrilled for the relief the weekend brings. He turns his climate control spells to their coolest setting, lays naked on his floor, and enjoys the way goose pimples cover him from head to toe. Once he starts shivering, he admits defeat and puts on a pair of joggers and a jumper, but for a glorious twenty minutes, he's frozen solid and loves it.
"In approximately fifteen minutes, the potion should turn a bright teal, which will indicate that you want to turn down the heat to a low simmer. Once it mellows to more of a peacock green, turn the heat off entirely. If it gets to hunter, you've gone too far, and the potion will solidify. Good luck chipping it out after, and yes, I do expect you to do it yourselves."
Eyes closed, Harry falls into the motion of Draco's cock in his mouth. It brushes the back of Harry's throat, but he doesn't gag, doesn't choke. He breathes through his nose and brings Draco as deep inside of his mouth as he can. He would devour Draco if he could, but he'll take this taste instead.
"Potter," Draco says, his head still tipped back, the long line of his throat red and exposed, "if you don't stop talking like that, I can't be held responsible for what happens."
Potter frowns, and there's a shiver of cold, quickly replaced again by that overwhelming heat. "We'll still need to figure out motive, even if we can trace the financials."
The voice is husky and low. Harry doesn't think he's heard it before, but something about it is compelling. He keeps his head bowed because he's been told to, but the desire to raise his chin, to open his eyes, to find out who's speaking to him is nearly overwhelming.
Nodding as much as he can while pinned by the weight of Draco's cock on his tongue, Harry groans in agreement before Draco cuts off Harry's air again and again. He's careful about it. Harry can feel the tensed strength of Draco's control with each press forward, his care when he pulls away. It's nearly as intoxicating as the bitter taste on Harry's tongue or the wild light in Draco's eyes.
If Potter thought Draco was worth saving then, he was going to do whatever he could to live up to that expectation.
He stays on his hands and knees and crawls after Draco. Eyes on the floor, Harry nearly bumps into Draco's calves when the other man stops. Harry looks up and catches Draco's gaze. He looks stoic and lost, silently begging for Harry to show him what to do, how to save the both of them.
It doesn't hurt that Malfoy is, by any measure, significantly easier on the eyes than Snape had ever been. His fringe keeps falling into his eyes, and there's a bit of chalk across his forehead from when he brushed it away earlier. Harry's fixated on that smear of white, almost imperceptible against Malfoy's pale skin. His fascination shifts to the line of Malfoy's cheek, the jut of his jaw. There's a hint of a five o'clock shadow there, a darkening of his skin that Harry could feel if he were close enough to brush his cheek against it.
"Do you take your tea with milk?" Draco shouts, though he knows they don't have any and Potter's probably still too out of it to respond.
Harry kissed Draco to distract him, to calm him. He used his lips and tongue to say the things that he couldn't find words for. The desire to protect, to cherish, the way those feelings melded with Harry's desire to ruin Draco, to dig into the meat of him and grab all of the things that mattered and hold onto them until they couldn't be taken away. The possessiveness was nothing new, but the ferocity of it scared him. Harry didn't know what he'd do if Draco said this was over, if the depth of Harry's feelings were too much, if this was nothing to him. Harry wanted to bury himself in the center of Draco's chest and never leave.
As the temperature rises, so does Draco's annoyance. Even his linen isn't enough to keep him cool, and he's forced to roll his sleeves up again. Rather than easing the heat, it seems to only make it worse. Groaning, he throws his quill down and shoves himself away from his desk. The screech of his chair against the floor makes Potter curse.
