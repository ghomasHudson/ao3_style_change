Remus glared at Tobias, who smiled innocently at him. Narcissa giggled softly.
Cool, elegant fingers gently caressed the one on Tobias’ back. Draco let out a warning hiss when he felt his bonded stiffen slightly, only to be smacked on the back of the head by Narcissa.
I climb inside your heart and still find
Tobias woke to a small body crawling into his bed with him. He sleepily opened one eye and took note of the long blonde hair and slightly protruding eyes in a paler than normal face and moved around so he was spoon in the younger female who had protected him, his mate and their unborn cub with her own body. With a sigh of happiness he fell back into a deep sleep with his new cuddle-toy not too far behind.
Tobias nodded. “The glass room please Lykos. We will be there once we have finished this last assignment.”
“Which wouldn’t surprise me considering the Healer they gave us was an idiot,” George sneered.
“Then I follow him,” Minerva stated without hesitation, “And to be completely honest, it wouldn’t surprise me if he did. Not with all the crap the Light have put him through.”
“I can do it,” a very young goblin said as it stood. “I am Drimbolweave.”
Draco sighed when Tobias just hid his face in his chest. “How about this?” he stated. “You have some noodles in broth and a little bit of salad now and whatever Dobby brings you for after and tonight I will spoil you. How does a hot bath for two, a pot of baby tea and a foot rub sound?”
“Miv!” The Pack called and ran to the small group by the doors. “What are you all doing here?”
“I’m sorry Bi. I’m so so sorry. Please believe me.” He bowed his head as more tears fell.
Everyone watched in silence as the door handle slowly turned and the door inched open wide enough for a single person to slip out. The door was gently closed once again before Narcissa turned around.
Poppy held her breathe. Did this mean what she thought it meant?
‘It’s a pity the boy hadn’t been place in Slytherin from the very beginning,’ he thought, watching the boy and his pack chat while eating. He was disrupted from his thoughts by a warm hand settling, and then rubbing, on his thigh.
“Neogennito? There are two mid-growth lions outside. Do you bid them entry?”
The four marked Weasley males sank into their chairs at the kitchen table as the inferno that was Molly Weasley ignited in the sitting room and aimed all her flames at her youngest son and his girlfriend. For a while, no one said anything. Tobias then swallowed the last bite of his breakfast, cleared his throat, drank the rest of his pumpkin juice and looked at Ginny.
Ginny nodded. “Very.”
It wasn’t the food that held everyone’s attention, however, it was the people seated to the left of their Alpha.
“I sent the letter, Alpha,” Blaise said. The Lord should get it just as Grandmother goes in to see him.”
The people in The Pack’s normal compartment were quiet. Tobias and Draco hadn’t arrived before the train left and they were starting to become concerned for their leaders. They were also extremely bored. Thanks to their Alpha, none of them had any unfinished homework and none of them could do any more planning or training until they talked with Tobias.
“That sounds wonderful to be honest,” Millicent smiled. “It has been a while since we’ve had a Pack fun day.”
Tobias slowly nodded.
“Hush My Raven,” the woman said. “She is yours to punish. I am only Judge and Jury.”
“You will stay here until this is resolved,” Madam Greengrass snapped at the pouting teen. “What anyone saw in you is beyond me. You are nothing but a spoilt little snot-nosed bra …”
Draco smiled and nodded, already ordering Dobby to run a bath for them. He knew that the next 7 months, 3 weeks would be physically and mentally draining on both of them, so he would treasure the moments he had with his husband relaxed with all he had.
“Our newest.”
The carriage The Pack was seated in was silent but for the scratching of quill on parchment. The number of books that were scattered around them put one in mind of a library. With a sigh and a crack of vertebrae, Tobias put down his quill.
Tom smirked. “Thinking against getting her another house-elf again are we?”
Stumbling out of the fireplace at Malfoy Manor, Severus bellowed, “Lucius!”  Almost at once a house-elf arrived at his side.
“And you are how old?” Pansy asked, unable to help herself as she stared at the muggleborn as though she had never seen her before.
It had been one week since Tobias had resumed his previous identity as Harry Potter and had appeared before the Weasleys and Dumbledore. During this time, Draco, his father, mother and godfather had been talking and preparing for the big day scheduled for the first of September.
“Ok, what have the rest of us missed?” a bemused Ginny asked.
Harry just laughed and smacked Draco’s arse cheeks firmly as he fondled and roughly squeezed the dark purple testicles hanging close to his Pet’s body. After a few more tugs, Harry began to strap Draco onto the table’s surface. Once the blonde couldn’t move at all, Harry moved to the side and revealed a selection of long, thin tubes full of various liquids that would snuggly fit into the spring-loaded device hidden inside the butt plug. He picked several out of his collection and jiggled them in front of Draco’s glazed eyes to get his attention as he plastered himself along Draco’s back.
Tobias bowed back to the Goblin, making sure it was noticeably deeper than the one the goblin gave him. “It is us who owe you and your kin thanks Master Goblin,” the dark-haired teen responded, “for guiding us through this period at such short notice.”
Draco silently counted to three before Pansy and Ginny squealed in delight. “We’re going to have a Neogennito in The Pack!”
“How is he?” Tom asked, almost desperately.
Tobias turned and glared sleepily at the man. “You were the reason I didn’t get my back massage or my promised night of pleasure before I can’t have sex until a few months after the baby is born. Be thankful that I’m not trapping you in the pubic hair of the youngest Weasley male as pay back.”
Iron and steel, Iron and steel.
“To show disrespect for you is to show disrespect for The Mother.”
Lucius hurried over to the bed and cleaned up the mess with a wave of his wand.
Luna happily returned to her seat as Vincent chuckled softly and shook his head.
“Congratulations,” Severus stated in a dry, cool voice. “You just successfully weathered a very mild mood swing.”
Draco and Severus,
Smirking, Ginny explained to her brothers how she and Luna were looking for Double-tailed Xansprites in New Zealand. As the twins laughed hard enough to need the support of their older brothers, the two girls shared a look that would have made the four men shudder in fear. They had an idea for their first official victim – the way they would announce their presence. They would bring fear to the hearts of the wizarding world before bringing about peace. Things must become worse before they could become better.
“Do you think Fred and George will mind if I borrowed one of their owls?” Luna asked Ginny as she slid into the seat beside the red-head. “Daddy said in his last letter that Heron is grounded for a few months. She was showing signs of clutching again.”
Forty-five minutes later, Severus, Draco and Tobias were listening to Godric and Salazar explain what they thought might be wrong with him. By the time they had finished with their explanations, Severus’ jaw had connected his chest, Tobias’ eyes were wide and slightly fearful and Draco was dangerously pale.
Draco laughed softly before kissing his husband gently. “Of course you’re not cute. You’re adorable, sexy and MINE!”
“Well stitch my seams and burn my brimming,” the Hat whispered into the silent hall. “I take every word I said to you back, Milord Black. You are more than Slytherin than Salazar himself! You’d best be placed in SLYTHERIN.”
Narcissa walked calmly into the sitting room where her husband was almost bouncing, something that scared her as he never bounced – Malfoys do not bounce! “Calm down, dearest. Now, tell me this news.”
“Draco, I need to see your father immediately.”
She sighed, eye focused on the distant past. “He said that it was more of a hindrance than a help – that the students with higher marks should be allowed to shine rather than forced to aid those too lazy to do the work themselves. Dippit agreed – after all, Dumbledore was one of those very students, so he should know.
“I have,” Amelia admitted with a sigh. “Tell him and his over-protective blonde that I will discuss it with those present here and give their answer later tonight. And Lucius?”
‘Oh well,’ she thought sadly. ‘I’ll just have to wait for grandchildren.’
“Ron is the main troublemaker. He has Dean, Seamus, the Creevy brothers and a few others behind him. I don’t think you have much support from the Gryffindor males.”
Something hit him on the back of the head and he turned around angrily only to shrink back at the sight of a viciously glaring youngster of around twelve.
“TOBIAS!” Lucius, Severus and Minerva shouted as Draco leaped forwards and slowed the slightly younger male’s fall.
“Yes, Neogennito. My name is Kityantropia. Hogwarts is the name of this building, but that is the name of my soul being.” Tobias nodded.
“He said that I said, ‘If you think that I could love a pathetic freak like you, then you are more delusional than I thought.’”
Everyone settled into a seat and nodded.
Tobias grinned and ran out of the room, leaving all three men to compose themselves. He had a nice stack of papers to get through before 12:30.
Tobias sat between Pansy and Vincent watching Neville and Millicent playing a game of chess. He smiled softly when he looked around and saw all bar three of his Pack around him.  He thought of the two girls that were sitting in a special room in the Ministry, privately sitting their N.E.W.Ts.
Draco growled, wandlessly removing the ties around his ankles and flipped them so Tobias was pinned beneath him. “Two hours,” he growled breathlessly into Tobias’ ear. “You have been teasing me mercilessly for two hours – giving me enough stimulation to want more, but not enough to cum.” He laughed darkly, sending chills down his husband’s spine. “I am going to fuck you so hard that the extra protection our child has wrapped around it will be activated.” He pushed in a touch. “You WILL get on your hands and knees. You WILL get my very long, thick cock shoved deeply into your arse. There will be NO touching yourself. You will come from my cock and my cock alone, is that understood?”
Everyone laughed and moved to get their breakfast, only to turn sharply and another shriek.
She blushed slightly at the look Tobias gave her.
Fred, unable to say anything, pat his younger twin on the back soothingly. After all, he would have reacted the same had he have been the one that had been assigned the Gryffindor Patil twin. Neither of them wanted a brainless twit as a life-partner. They needed  women with substance; with a brain and who wouldn’t think twice to give them a swift kick up the rear when they were being too much to handle. Pavarti had none of these things going for her from what they had witnessed and both twins shuddered in horror at the thought of being tied to her for the rest of their lives.
Plans within plans within plans and a few explanations.
The first Tobias/Dumbledore confrontation and a gift.
Booph lent forward and whispered something to Zog, who lowered his head and murmured an apology. Tobias nodded his acceptance and lay his head back on Draco’s lap.
The reaction of those in the Hall was immense. People groaned, shouted out in anger, fear or annoyance, some paled until they could almost blend in with the ghosts while others still just accepted it with a shrug of the shoulders.
Draco smirked at the small moans and whimpers coming from Tobias as he plundered his very willing mouth. Slowly, he ran his hands down Tobias’ sides, seeking a way for his hands to enter the fabric. Breaking the kiss, he glared at the robes, causing Tobias to giggle slightly. Draco turned his glare to his husband, who sat up and kissed him softly.
“TOM!”
“Harry!” Severus barked.
“That is true,” Tobias mused, “but still, we should warn the rest of The Pack as well as Severus and Minerva. Just in case.”
Tom fidgeted under the blank stare of the younger male and cleared his throat. “To begin showing you how serious I am – I want to remove your Dark Mark.”
Tobias nodded, noting with absentminded pride that the twins and Padma were also listening attentively.
Draco nodded and left to gather the rest of their family. It looked as though Severus wasn’t quite ready to let Tobias out of his sight just yet.
The questioner flushed slightly and cleared his throat nervously. “We’ve heard from many people that Mr Snape is a harsh teacher who treats his students as if they are lower than dirt and that both yourself and one Neville Longbottom were his favourite targets. How do you explain that?”
There, in the middle of the mattress, lay the entwined bodies of Tobias and Draco. Tobias’ head was rested on Draco’s still chest and his left hand was gripped tightly in Draco’s right and on both faces a small content smile lay. One by one the family entered the room to pay their respects and each left with tear-filled eyes and a small smile on their lips. The sound of wolf song once more entered the estate and all who entered the room released the hold on their tears and, on the shore of a distant lake in the middle of a wondrous garden, a pair of wolves – one white and one black – watch on and howl their emotions into the air.
“Agree! Came the shouted vote of the entire group bar Luna, who just smiled sweetly. Everyone who looked at the blonde shuddered in fear – that dreamy look masked the owner of the most horrifyingly violent mind in history.
Tobias re-read the letter and couldn’t stop the smirk from taking over his face. This was just what he needed! Without a second thought, he reached for a quill and parchment and started to write.
“And what does the Romanian Minister wants in exchange?”
“You and your husband. You are simply cute together!” Pansy smirked.
Harry’s face angered. “Then the bastard told the Dursleys that Sirius was no longer alive. I wouldn’t have needed rescuing if the old fucker hadn’t have done that!”
Severus looked between the two of them thoughtfully. “That is a good idea to be honest,” he murmured. “We are getting to the point where it is far too dangerous for Tobias to be near the classroom with the potions we are doing.”
Draco giggled softly. “I’ll hold you to that. Goodnight, Sly. I love you heart and soul.”
“That was at the beginning of your second year, Hermione. You told us in fourth year about what happened between the three of you when the tournament was announced, and you told us how it ended. What the Hell were you thinking at the end of last year?”
Within seconds, Tobias was back to his human form. “What is your idea Sev?”
The Patil family had always believed that the strength of a man was found, not in body or magic, but in the bonds they held to their family, and while some may argue that Mr Fred and Mr George Weasley proved themselves to be weak by abandoning their blood family; Achalendra had heard and witnessed tales and behaviours of older generations of the Weasley and Prewitt families to know that the twins distancing themselves from their blood family was a sign of the strength they had.
“Now that I have you back in my arms, I’m never letting you go.”
“Tobias love,” Draco said cautiously, “That didn’t make much sense.”
Severus, Lucius, Narcissa and Remus stood around the chair watching the tears fall down Draco’s cheeks as what he’d done hit him over and over. Eventually, Remus took pity on the young man and sat beside him. Placing a hand on his shoulder, he soon found himself with his arms full of sobbing blonde.
Draco beamed at that and hugged Tobias tightly, laughing when the teen’s stomach let loose another growl.
As a chorus of ‘So Motes’ echoed in the room, the golden glow expanded to surround them all.
Tobias kept his eyes locked onto his betrothed as he walked slowly towards him. As his father had led him to the ceremony, Tobias had felt as if he was going to lose his stomach, but as soon as his eyes had locked with Draco’s, everything had faded until all he could feel was a deep, consuming love. Neither he nor Draco realised that with every step closer together, the magic in the garden grew, making the flowers glow as if it were a full moon, rather than a new moon.
“And what Tobias went through wasn’t?” Draco asked frostily. “I would think very carefully on what you say Granger. I was there when Sev burst into MY family home shouting for help. I was there when Sev, Remus, Father and Pa fought for Tobias’ life and I was there when Tobias was recovering from the mental wounds that were left over from what you, the Weasel,  the manipulative SOB that shouldn’t be anywhere near a school, let alone running it and our oh-so-caring school nurse did to him.”
“Silence!” All movement stopped. “Now – what is going on?”
When Draco and Tobias arrived, the Minister escorted the sixth years to the Ministry for their exams.
Tobias and Draco talked throughout their meal, neither one mentioned the information The Mother had given them. Instead, they spoke about what they wanted in their relationship. Both were pleasantly surprised when it turned out that they wanted roughly the same things. The only disagreement they had worth mentioning was the number of children they wanted. Draco wanted two, while Tobias wanted three or four – if not more.
“My boss heard about what is going on back home,” Charlie replied as he took a seat. “He wants to talk to either the Lord or Skotadi.”
She walked out of the room, activating the spells that would allow no-one but her inside or hear what was said in that room. After a moment of hesitation, she also spelled the room to notify her if either patient left their bed. Nodding once firmly, she walked to her office, muttering about schoolboys and their rivalries.
“I assume everyone knows of why we are here,” the youngest goblin asked.
Falling down, falling down.
“Incendio,” a voice hissed. Everyone stopped panicking and looked at the teen that was glaring at the man who held his Father under that curse. In one hand he held his wand and in the other was a black and silver flame and his face was one that everyone in the Pack, as well as every married man, was familiar with.
Everyone shook their heads.
Without wasting a second, Algernon had cursed the woman and subdued her with ropes.
Luna looked up as the door opened to reveal Severus carrying a deeply sleeping Tobias close to his chest and sighed in relief. She had decided that even though Tobias had told her to plan a girl’s night, that for now she would stay with the rest of The Pack since it was they who gave her the love, comfort and strength she required to face her – potentially ex - housemates every day. That isn’t to say that she wasn’t going to follow his advice, she would just make it for when lessons re-started so the Slytherin girls had something to look forward to as a break away from the stresses of being pure-blood maidens.
Severus nodded decisively, finished his drink and rose from his seat. “No time like the present,” he said before leaving.
“Oh Rowan! Look at them all. Aren’t they just so cute!”
“You are talking about young William aren’t you?” Grapplefang asked, amused.
“No longer exists,” a cold voice interrupted from the doorway. Tobias strutted into the room, followed closely by both Malfoy men and the Slytherin head of house. He looked the older boy in the eye, his own eyes hard and cold. “And you’d best remember that, Mr Benalighan. I am less forgiving than Pateras.”
“Father,” he answered. “Shall we?”
“Yes Alpha.” Greg released his grip and moved back to his position – behind and slightly to the left of Draco. Tobias’ eyes went AK green. Remus whined and Severus and Lucius gulped.
“Before you open this book, Miss Granger, I want your word that you will do several things for me.” Hermione nodded eyes slightly wide at the sterner than normal look her teacher was giving her. “First, you must make an unbreakable vow, do you accept?”
“This is acceptable,” Grapplefang stated as he wrote something out. “Do you believe much will be found?”
Tobias had then spent three hours explaining to her that a reaction might have occurred if the victim was only injured by it rather than being bisected. After several minutes in deep thought, the blonde-haired female had agreed that yes that might have helped, and dropped the matter.
Minerva sighed. “Right: everyone back to bed. I’ll sort this out. No use for all of us to be tired later on in the day.” She turned to the girl and put a hand on her shoulder to gain her attention. “What Happened, Miss Granger?”
The boys laughed and interrupted her. “Of course we want to have it here. We picked the night of the first because it is a new moon, so Remus can attend, and we’d like it to be in the moon flower garden.”
Tom sighed and rubbed his face. “It is that important. Madam Longbottom discovered who is going to be involved in the investigation. One is Lucius, several of the others are neutrals but there are two people I am worried about – one more than the other. The lesser danger is Madam Greengrass. I still have a degree of control over her – as does Lucius. The main problem is the last person on the team. Lucius assured me he did his absolute best to prevent it, but it didn’t work.”
“I didn’t hear that Daughter,” he said, crossing his arms across his chest.
The two of them spent the rest of their time together laughing over past memories.
“Get Tobias and Melody out of here!” Tom yelled as he and the older members rose, drawing their wands.
Tobias laughed and picked up the top newspaper and promptly chocked as he read the Headline.
After hearing that, Draco slowly began to move, enjoying the sweet sensation of being buried deeply inside his husband once more.
“So this is what you do in your spare time, is it?” a deep voice purred into his ear. “You really need to get a life.”
“Only what I’ve mentioned. Oh, and the fact that one Bellatrix Lestrange is terrified of him, making him officially the most feared member of the Death Eaters – Your father included, Neogennito. With this new threat, he has paused in his meddling of your life.”
Zog’s rockslide chuckle announced his arrival. “So now you decide to not stand on ceremony? What if we say that the Mother is here to see her Raven?”
“He has visitors, Sev. Could you come back later?”
Once everyone had cheered or grunted their understanding, Tobias chose the first name. “Blaise.”
He raised his head and looked into his husband’s lust-filled eyes. He pulled back to stop himself from cuming too soon and to look over the body beneath his. He jumped when he felt hands on his shoulders. Smirking, he removed the hands and pinned them above their owners’ head.
“I may have been a proud member of Hufflepuff in my school years, but do NOT consider me a pushover by any means. Hufflepuffs are loyal and hardworking and more likely to work in positions of power in their chosen field due to this. If you have a problem with what our job here is tell us so we can either sooth your fears or transfer you with someone who will do the job you are unwilling to do.”
Build it up with Bricks and mortar,
Tobias bowed to the room in general, shot his father a dark look until he left for his bed chamber and left, all of his pack following him out.
“To visit Alpha for.”
Tom smirked and raised the glasses, revealing azure eyes. Tobias walked to him before almost throwing himself into the waiting arms of the older man.
“Yes, Neogennito. What is so funny?”
As he put the last mark for the night on his husband’s body, his left hand reached for his husband’s mouth and his right reached for the botte of lubricant he had obtained before tying his husbands hands together. Draco was extremely hard and was impatient to sink into his husband’s depths, but for some reason, he also knew that he had to be sure to not allow Tobias – who was now sucking on Draco’s fingers as if they were the only thing keeping him sane – to come before he was breached.
“WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?” Narcissa yelled, freezing both of the men in her life with a silent spell. She let it go and crossed her arms, barely noticing Tobias coming out of Neville’s rooms with the taller teen close behind him.
Tom interrupted. “Why would she do that?”
He grinned viciously as Dumbledore yelped as flames appeared around his hands. He began to laugh.
Remus walked into the large room holding the newly marked youngsters. To his – and everyone else’s – surprise, all the sixth year Slytherins that were present also chose to be marked by his godson. His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of silence from a previously noisy room. Looking around, he quickly put the goblet he was holding on the table next to Tobias.
“Only partially,” Pansy responded flippantly from where she and Ginny were conversing. “The rest will be the Cubs.”
“M’not h’ng’y” Tobias pouted, snuggling into Draco’s chest.
Catching Draco’s expression from the corner of his eye, Tobias placed a hand on his cheek.
Draco smiled as Tobias snuggled into him, settling in for a night of peace. It was the first night in over a fortnight that the two of them were sleeping in their bed without the presence of at least three other members of The Pack. He gently pressed a kiss to the top of his husband’s head.
“And that is something none of us want to see before breakfast thank you,” Ginny piped up with a playful glare.
Bend and bow, bend and bow.
Searching for the official, she paused when something caught her eye. She moved towards it and blinked. There on three cots slept six members of The Pack. In the centre cot was her charge and his husband. To their immediate right lay Greg and Vince. To their immediate left lay Neville and Millicent. At the foot of the cot holding her patient lay a dark brown wolf with a caramel snout, saddle, tail and right forepaw. At the head of the same cot lay a petite pale tan wolf with large blue eyes and a black stripe from the tip of its muzzle to the tip of its tail.
Without a thought, Tom jumped in front of the curse and he fell to the ground, gritting his teeth together so hard that you could hear them creaking.
Luna walked around the male, singing in her once again dreamlike hypnotic voice.
Harry glanced at the Dark Lord and receiving a nod, smirked. “Well, I am the Founder’s Heir,” he drawled, sounding much like Draco. “In all points of Law, I own Hogwarts, amongst other things. I am to claim them when I return, so Hogwarts is now in our possession, without any bloodshed. I have also had a large magical boost and have some other gifts that should start making themselves noticeable once I return to my holdings. Professor? May I complete my test now?”
“NOW, Lykos.”
Tobias smiled at his husband then turned blank-faced back to his Father in law.
“Okay people!” Tobias yelled after everyone had calmed down. “I have two boxes here. One has everyone’s name in it and the other has a selection of colours. I will pick a name from the first container. Whoever I call will come up and chose another name. That person will be your team mate. The second person called will chose a colour. That will be your team colour. Once everyone is teamed up you will have a moment to change your clothing to said colour or to transfigure something in said colour. Everyone understand?”
He was once more attacked by a person throwing their arms around him. “HI SEVIE!” He turned his head slightly, only to come fact-to-face with a red-eyed Demon-man. He yelped, causing everyone to laugh. The demon pouted, as did the young man on his other side.
“Beyond ready Sister,” was her answer.
Luna relaxed into the embrace of her Alpha and exhaled until she felt there was nothing left in her lungs. “I know that in my head,” the fey-like female whispered as silent tears fell and were absorbed by Tobias’ shirt, “but it doesn’t make my heart hurt less.”
He glared at Lucius. “I know you gave it to her, because Dobby told me,” he smirked, “but he also tried killing me several time over the course of that year, so he kind of evened it out.” He shrugged again before glancing around the room before whispering, “Do I have to go tomorrow?”
Amelia chuckled at the lad’s bashful smile as a tall, muscular girl strode up to him with a small handful of parchment. The two exchanged nods and a smile before the girl walked away, leaving the parchment in Neville’s hand.
His voice took on a malicious glee. “I wrecked his office.  Everything I could see, I destroyed. Not even Thanatos could calm me. Not that he really tried. He wanted to see how the old goat reacted. He waited until I calmed down and told me about the prophecy.” Harry snorted.
Tom looked at his son in confusion. “Who is ‘Miv’?”
“Then punish her. Stop attacking the idiots and take her down and calm down. All this stress can’t be good for our little one.”
The Slytherins that had been at his marking laughed knowing that Lucius was talking about Dumbledore, not their Lord. Tobias nodded his understanding.
He sighed, serious again. “It took me, Luc and every potion I had six hours to remove all of the bands. I have never seen Draco run from a room so many times – nor seen him that shade of green either.” He looked up, just now remembering where he was and with whom. “I can put all my memories into a pensive if you wish.”
Tobias sighed then shook his head, “At least I should have an uneventful rest.”
The man gave a half smirk. “I am Randal Johns. Tobias’ father.”
She then turned to her father, blind in her Temper tantrum. “And don’t get me started on you. You are about to sign one of your family members into slavery! Wait until I tell Mother what you are doi …”
The were-wolf disappeared and was replaced by a newly transformed Harry Potter. Half the hall felt their jaws drop as they took in the boy’s new appearance. There was no two ways about it – The boy was damned well smoking hot! Half the Hufflepuffs swooned, but Tobias had eyes only for the boy he had pinned to the floor. Ron gulped in fear as he met the cold, hard malachite eyes above him.
“If you are sure.”
“Tart?” Sally-Anne grinned while pulling an un-opened jar of pickled cabbage and one of pickled onions from her bag. “Serina sent you these for you when I told her your cravings had started. I swear on my magic that as soon as I got them I ensured they were untempered with and that no one else has touched them. I will not, however, be insulted should you wish to get a Professor to test them.”
“Yes Draco?”
Neville’s grandmother nodded. “That is acceptable. I shall see you then.”
“Ginny, Pansy,” Draco called, seeing a way he could help his husband. “Can you come here?”
“We are hoping to get through the staff and the first years before lunch. I recommend remaining in your house common room, your dormitory, the library or the Quidditch Pitch. If there’s a place you know you will be for a long period of time, please tell one of us so we will know where to send a patronus to fetch you when it is your turn. We will begin as soon as breakfast is complete.”
Harry whimpered in pain again and then the magic escaped his grasp.  All the men in the room were flung backwards into the walls and Severus cursed as he felt all of the security spells around his Manor be over-whelmed.  The only one that wasn’t destroyed was his strongest, and even that one was severely weakened.
“Thank you Neville!” Pavarti gushed.
Draco looked at the box closer and found a slight depression and grinned. “I will tell you how it works out my Dear,” he almost purred. He pat her softly on the head and walked out of the room to meet up with his father.
Draco grinned and thrust forwards gently. “We only have 30 minutes, but I’m going to make it the best 30 minutes ever.”
The bottom of Ron’s stomach dropped as clay-muddied water dripped down and around his body. He screamed once again as the clay’s grasp on the wood loosened and he – along with many large planks of wood - started to fall once more. He gasped for breath in relief when the tenor cut in before the soprano could repeat the verse.
The girls glanced at each other. “Yes Alpha.”
When he heard the chanting stop, only to be replaced by a soft keening, he wrapped his hand around the engorged dick and tugged on it. As he continued to administer to his husband’s engorged member, the soft keening built in pitch and volume until Tobias’ mouth was open in a silent scream and his whole body tensed.
The next day, Harry laughed as he read a very degrading article about his lack of a life as the reporters from the previous day wrote story after story about his idea of a holiday as playing with a pet. He put the paper down with a grin and wiped away the laugher tears that had escaped his eyes as he spread his legs wider so his pet could have easier access to the treat he was happily slurping on. Thinking of the previous night’s activities and those he had planned for the rest of the week, he found he couldn’t disagree with the papers more.
“What do you think you are doing?” she shrieked, trying to buck him off.
“Draco!” a voice called out, laughing slightly as Lucius moaned once again. “Stop teasing Anadochos, we don’t have time for it. Arketa and Epikindynos are getting fidgety so I want these plans to be okayed before I set them up.”
“Bi? What?”
“If you move them from there, Bi, I will tie them up with the willow’s branches so you can’t move – and if that’s what you want, then by all mean, touch me,” he whispered seductively.
After half an hour of nothing but this, Tobias’ arms snapped up and grabbed Draco, pulling him over the back of the chair and into his lap. Pansy and Millicent giggled as Tobias nuzzled into Draco’s hair, semi-purring. Draco rested his head on Tobias’ shoulder and smiled happily.
And so it was that Draco Malfoy lay dying on the fringes of the Forbidden Forest, three days into the new term at Hogwarts.
'Y...yes.'  Draco swallowed down the nausea, hoping for just a moment longer.  The humiliation didn't need to be completed over the Gryffindor common room floor.
His fingers curled in, broken nails digging scarlet crescents into his palms.  The potion too warm to be comfortable against his naked skin.  It tingled, burned.  The smell creeping across his nose.  He squeezed his eyes tightly closed, his head sinking deep into the pillows, teeth gritted against the rising pain.
'No.'  His voice clipped, biting back a harsh retort.  The wait was agonising.  'Just...  No, I don't want Harry here.  Just do it.'
He wouldn't do it, he could never do it.
Stupid of him to be sitting on the floor of the bathroom while Draco waited.  Clearly in pain, terrified and completely alone.  He was meant to be looking after him, he had promised him with empty words that he he wouldn't be long, that as soon as the bath was filling he would be back to help him peel off his dirty, damp clothes, get him into the water and wash away the heartbreak the Boggart had left him with.
'No m...more hiding.'  Draco opened his tired eyes.  And Harry once again saw that bright flash of shining silver, the sight that had haunted his own lonely dreams.  'Stay here.  With me?'
Snape, Colin, Fred.  Lupin and Tonks.  Students he hadn't known, and ones he had.  So many fallen.
Professor McGonagall had at first been slightly perturbed by the insistent knocking at her chamber door.  Wondering who on earth was up and about at this time in the morning, she tugged her dressing gown around her nightdress, secured the belt with a tight cinch, and smoothed down her disheveled hair.
'Draco?'  Neville's eyebrows arched.  'It's Draco now is it?'
It was there, between them.  And it would always be there.  A voiceless body of blood and broken bones, shared memories and a rejected handshake.  So much connecting them over all the years.  A past they would never escape from, and Draco knew it was meaningless to even try.  'I can't...  I can't give y...you the world, Harry.  I can't give you a...anything.  And I can't take it all back.  But, you have me.  You have always had me.'
'I can't believe you missed dinner.'  Ron exclaimed, stuffing bacon into his mouth like it was becoming extinct.  Harry's stomach protested so much at the sight he had to turn away.  He couldn't eat, couldn't even think about it.  His dry toast sat in front of him, untouched.  'Actually, I didn't hear you at all last night.  What time did you get back?'
'I never knew, Harry.  I...I always thought that you would have had a wonderful time at home.  You were the baby who defeated Voldemort.  Who wouldn't be proud of that?  You mentioned about your cupboard, before.'  Draco tilted his head, watching the boy who was making his bed.  'You slept in a cupboard, didn't you?  They kept you like an animal.'
Draco lurched to his feet, desperate to escape Nott and his nasty smile.  'Y...you have it w...wrong.'
'It's Malfoy's.'  Ron told him quietly, sadly.  'Harry, it was in his bag.'
'I...I can't.'  He stumbled around his words.  Why couldn't she see?  Did he have to spell it out for her?  'I'm not...not a wizard.  Not now, not after...'
'I missed you.'  That voice hissed, cool and odd, almost serpentine.  'Did you miss me?'
'Perhaps.'  McGonagall smiled deeply, momentarily cheered up by her friend.
The child, for they were all still children in Hagrid's eyes, had tried to curl up, unconsciously seeking warmth despite knowing that none would be found.  Using the dull lamp that hung from his fingers, Hagrid dropped to his knees to inspect the boy, his breath catching in his throat, tears stinging in his eyes at the body that was Draco Malfoy.
Lies that Theo had taken in and believed without a thought, without asking questions.  He had spat them back to Draco.  Been merciless, tortured him with the memory of his Professor, accused when there was nothing but blameless innocence.
He had to move, Harry knew he couldn't stand in the cold, quiet hallway all the long night.
'And she is best where she is.'  Millicent swallowed, knowing that whatever she was to say next would cause Theo to explode with anger.  But still she did not silence her tongue.  Theo had an anger in his eyes that frightened her.  It needed to be said.   'And so is your father, Theo.  They made their choices, and you cannot change what has already happened.  Whatever you have planned, stop it now.'
'Goodnight, Draco.'  She had spoken, keeping her place within the book with a manicured finger, and leaned forward to accept his kiss.
'What's the hurry, Theo?'  Millicent watched him carefully,  'You are not normally in such a rush for food.'
Someone was knocking.  A faint tap, afraid, hesitant.  Harry could hear it through his fog, a bone deep weariness that threatened to pull him under.  Draco was in his arms.  Not sleeping, never that.  But still, quiet.  Calm.  It was enough, for now.
Almost losing his tenuous hold for the second time, Harry knew it was crazy to be out in the oncoming storm, lightning flashing menacingly in the distance.  All it would take was a slip in a turn, a particularly forceful gust of wind, and he would plummet to the ground in a tumble of broken bones and torn flesh.
He waited until all the fuss and commotion of bedtime had quieted, lulled and finally ceased.  And when all he heard through the drapes was the gentle sounds of snoring, he emerged.
'You can't possibly want a card with my ugly face on it.'
Harry deserved his secrets after living such as life as he had.  His story an open book that everyone was eager to read.  He must have had his reasons for venturing out at night, it wouldn't do to ask.
'Why are you even saying that?'
'It's not like that, Neville.  Don't turn it into something sordid. You don't understand what's been happening with Draco.'
Draco knew that what he should be feeling right now was deep, dark shame.  He was just too tired.
'It has to be this way.'  Harry shrugged, unable to stifle a jaw popping yawn.  'Ginny is happy, that's all that matters.'
It began as a secret.  Precious few were granted access to Lucius Malfoy's only child.  The whispers grew, until everyone who passed thought the home knew that there was a once pretty child being kept to vent frustrations upon.
'Let him go, Harry.'
'Is he hurt?'  Harry turned to him, his eyes blown.
'But it is.  Look at what Voldemort did to you.  What He is still able to do.  It's never going to go away, Draco.  He has a hold over everyone still.  I...I should have done it sooner, I should have known what was going to happen.'
Draco studied the exhausted boy who sat beside him.  Right from the dark circles around his eyes, to the way he held himself, everything spoke of his unending tiredness.  There was a slight tremor in his hands, the book threatening to fall to the floor at any given moment.  He was clearly not sleeping, spending night after night sat here, reading aloud, granting Draco a peace he thought was long out of his reach.  Harry Potter.  It never failed to amaze him.
Perhaps the sweet treat would tempt the slight boy into eating again.  Scant amounts of cooling soup sipped from a spoon was hardly going to add pounds to Draco's body.
Along came Ginny.
But he could.
Draco allowed Madam Pomfrey to unwrap him from the relative comfort of the furs, his naked body once again bared to the hut.  She had him lean forward, getting up behind him.
'Many, many times.'  Harry smiled, working as quickly as he could.  'I had to do the housework when I lived with my aunt and uncle.'  He told Draco, tucking the sheets tightly under the mattress.  'I guess it came in handy after all.'
'How...How many?'  He whispered, his ruddy face paling, unable to look Draco in the eye as he spoke.
His body shrinking away from the voice.  Just one night.  Please, just one night left alone.
'It's all right.'  Harry murmured again, pulling Draco's fragility against himself.  He pressed a kiss, two, three into his hair.  'You are almost there.'
'You didn't have to come tonight.'  Draco spoke.  Perhaps it would be for the best if he left?  He was hardly going to be good company.  'You should go back.'
'Ah, Potter.  I was told you have been keeping young Mr Malfoy company during his spell here.  We have been discussing his return to Slytherin House.'
'It...  I...'  Greg faltered, there was nothing more to say.  Nothing that would ever change what he had allowed himself to become in his shameful silence.
Of course Harry should follow Ron, it was the right thing to do.  Years of friendship could not be torn asunder because of some cross words, some hasty actions.  Harry would make it right.  He had too.  But...But it had hurt.
Harry always seemed to give it half an hour before reappearing.
'He has Potter.'
To rape.
'He won't.  He will never get over this.'
Draco couldn't stop the tremors as his fingers clawed to his throat, as he struggled to loosen the knot holding his tie in place.  It wouldn't do to keep the Dark Lord waiting.  The repercussions would be severe, the punishment unimaginable.
'I...Harry, I...'  He eyed the door.  The world beyond his sight.  'I don't...'  He shook his head, burying his face into Harry's shoulder.  'It's been so long.  The last time...  It...it was the Forbidden Forest.'  It was out there, beyond that door.  Waiting, watching.
'I needed this potion to be good.'  Hermione fumed, stuffing her books into her bag with more force than quite necessary.  'The exams are coming up, and I wanted to make sure that I had done everything possible to get an Outstanding.'  She huffed, and thankfully didn't meet Ron's eyes.  'How could they have run out?  It doesn't make sense.  I'm going to speak to Professor Slughorn.'  She was up, about to set across the room and demand an explanation.
She swung silently shut behind him.
The circle drawing ever closer, the putrid smell coming from the bodies in the corner, the loneliness, the desperation, the cold hard truth of his own existence.  He was nothing.  A vessel to hurt, to torture, to rape.
'Tell that to Draco, try explaining that to the one who has lost everything in his life.'  Harry snapped.  But his venom was waning, his strength draining away, leaving him with nothing but a scribbled letter and tears in his eyes.  'I want him back, Neville.  I just want him here, with me.'
She and Harry had not worked out.  It was as simple as that.  It was the story they both told anyone who happened to ask.  They would always remain friends, but nothing more.  Neville had believed that.  Right up until Harry kept vanishing.
He didn't notice the pain, he only saw the man standing before him.  The man who was once Mr Lucius Malfoy, the imposing patriarch of the Malfoy family.
'I...I don't understand why.'  Draco couldn't help the sob escaping.
His more intimate injuries would have to heal without their aid.  He could not take any more trauma.
But... There was anger beneath the tears this time, his raw eyes containing a fury that was not going to be curtailed.
'Shh, it's okay.  I'm going to make it all okay, I promise you.'  Harry swallowed down his sobs.  They could wait for later, when he had time, when he clawed back some semblance of Draco.  Later, much, much later.  'How about a bath?  Would you like that, do you think?'  His voice felt thick, sticking in his throat as he forced the words out, forcing them to sound normal.  He wouldn't allow Draco to see him break.
'Promise me.  Just promise me that you'll let me stay.  That you won't say sorry, that you won't turn me away.'
Draco was broken beyond repair.  He was dirty, used.  His body was no longer his.  He couldn't allow someone as inherently good as Harry to be around someone like him, it just wasn't fair.  Harry was light, happiness, a life worth living.
He didn't want any of it.
McGonagall knew that he would never fully recover from all he had been through, even with all the care and devotion Harry would undoubtedly bestow upon him.  There was no doubt in her mind that Harry would help him through the nights, and his care might put weight on his bones, but Draco would always remember, would always feel the everlasting effects of his incarceration.
He had to, Harry knew that.  It would raise far too many questions if he didn't join his fellow Gryffindors.  But the thought of food, the thought of pretending that everything was perfectly normal when he knew that his life had changed irrevocably filled him with dread.
'I...'  He stuttered, his fingers aching where he held the book tighter.  'I...'  He tried again, but it was useless.  Those three pointless, heartbreaking words he had said to Harry still burned against his lips.  How could he find his voice after that?
'And s...so many more didn't, Harry.  Grieve for them, but don't f...forget who you did save.'  Words sticking in his painfilled throat.  It didn't matter.  Harry was upset.
'I guess, if we are giving each other presents...'  Harry reached behind himself, under the chair.  'I don't have anything as special as what you have given me, but...  I have this for you.'  He placed the badly wrapped gift on Draco's outstretched legs.  'Something old.'  He looked embarrassed by his present, it would never compare to the gift Draco had bestowed upon him.  To give him something that precious, the only thing he had left from his mother.
'Can...Can I carry it?'  Draco eyed his prized possession with longing.
One did not come without the other, it didn't happen, it was beyond wrong, it was unthinkable.  But still, there he was, George.  Without Fred.  Still looking the same, still the spitting image of his dead brother.  Minutes should be separating them, not eternal sleep.
He had been going to him, night after night.
Theodore Nott had no words.
'It's not your fault, Harry knows that.'  Hagrid slowly, carefully took the destroyed biscuit from Draco's shaking hands, along with the mug that was threatening to spill into his lap.
Harry lingered in the emptying corridor outside the Potions classroom.
'Merlin, Draco.  I'm so sorry.'  Harrry turned at the sound of Draco's utter despair. He went to him, dropped heavily to his knees before him.  'I...I don't know how to do this, I don't know how to make things right.'  His head falling onto the bed, voice muffled against the covers.
Draco couldn't recall the last time he had felt this safe.
The kind voice painted his sore lips with water.  Cool and soothing.  He drew in what little he could, his tongue cracked and swollen.  But it was wonderful.  The water continued, dripping slowly onto his lips.
Not this.  Please.  Never this.
'Can you tell us what happened next, Draco?  Pomfrey asked, worried about the vacant look in his grey eyes.  He wasn't with them.  He was back in that terrible place.  'I know it's difficult for you, but the more we know, the better equipped we will be to help you.'
'I'll keep you safe.'  Harry murmured.  'I promise you.  I'll keep you safe.'
Deep lash marks, inflicted with a vicious whip and a heavy hand scoured his back, shoulders and buttocks.  Infected and looking desperately sore, Hagrid knew that when the time came to pick him up, he would undoubtedly cause unbearable agony.  His breathing was laboured, shallow, thin chest heaving with the effort.  His once pale face was swollen and littered with purpling bruises, stretching across his throat.  Shaped like fingers where a set of hands, more than one set, had gripped him hard, a hold that would have choked him unconscious.
“That’s good,” Luna said, staring dreamily at something just over Hermione’s shoulder. “That means we can say everything that has happened to her as part of her punishment was for her own good. It’s the same thing isn’t it?”
"Do you know who was behind the attack?" Professor Dumbledore asked in a very grave voice.
"Oh, it's nothing. I'm keeping you." Day replied. At that moment the owl post came in. Hedwig flew down and landed beside Harry's plate. Harry fed him some bacon and realized that Hedwig just wanted to check on him as she had no letter tied to her claws.
At the end of the two hours, the two boys were starting to be exhausted, as doing wandless spell was actually tapping into the raw magical power between them and the strain was starting to show on their faces. Finally they stopped and the two boys collapsed at a corner of the room on the floor, leaning against the wall, resting as they felt the drain of power.
Draco wondered to himself. He did notice that Dean's eyes kept wandering to Seamus, who was opposite him, during the dinner. Were those two together? No, it didn't seem like they were a couple. Seamus had often flaunted himself as a gay man while he remembered Dean having a girlfriend before. Unless things happened during the summer. And he didn't know any of the two well enough to ask any of such questions. He would just have to file it up at the back of his mind and observe the two for a while.
When everyone finished dinner, they all made their way up to their rooms, with Remus and Sirius following. Or rather, the whole group followed Sirius who was in front with another group of Gryffindors who was trying to pet it. Finally, reaching what they call Study area, Sirius pounced on one of the couches and changed back to human form. Those who did not get the couches just sat on the carpet around the couches, lazy to pull chairs towards the centre. All that is lacking is a fireplace for the cozy atmosphere to be complete. The night before, when everyone was unpacking, Hermione suggested that they each pick a table in the Study area as their own and the shelves above their table will be their own personal book space. This was a good idea as the sleeping areas only had closets for the clothes and no space to keep the books at all. In comparison, Hermione's, Ginny's and Draco's shelves had the most number of books, while Ron's, Seamus's and Harry's space had many Quidditch stuff. After the first day of school, Hermione's area already looked very well-used as she had woke up early in the morning to attempt some studying before breakfast. Neville's desk had a small cactus on it and was next to the window looking out to the Quidditch pitch, which was always left open for air ventilation and for the owls to reach the people in the dorm. Sirius looked around the place.
"I also don't get something. Why didn't Dumbledore just leave me be? Why would he want me be protected like his darling Gryffindor Heir? I'm nowhere as important. That bastard already killed my whole family." Draco injected.
"Oh my, can those two get anymore dumber? My dear, thank you. We're even now." Draco smiled at Day.
"She defended me on the first day of school. Without me around, Parkinson wouldn't even notice her. It's my fault." Draco said, finally giving up the fight to remain calm as he leant down to place his face at Harry's neck, breathing in his essence. Harry's arms came around him and a tug caused Draco to be seated on Harry's lap as Harry tried to bring himself as close to Draco as possible.
Draco stopped talking, and the two continue to stare up in comfortable silence.
"Um… I…" Dean shot a pleading look at Harry and Harry decided to step in before Dean blurt out anything he might regret.
The noise level of the whole common room suddenly went up, as everyone got up to go to their rooms to get ready for bed, discussing about the chess game that just ended in a draw. Ron Weasley had been recognized for his chess skills since his first year and they promised themselves that they would spread this news to their other friends in other houses.
"Oh, Merlin… your two are beautiful." Remus couldn't bring his eyes to leave the two panthers who lazily strolled towards Remus. Remus squatted down, as the two panthers stopped in front of him. The green-eyed panther nuzzled Remus' hand while the silver-eyed panther sat itself down contently to clean itself, keeping an eye on its mate whom was being scratched behind its ears by Remus. Finally Dumbledore gave the two panthers the signal to change back and the green-eyed panther walked towards its mate and both changed back in the process of Harry pulling Draco up from the floor. The door then flew open as the two boys left for the Gryffindor tower, as the door closed behind them.
Ron and Hermione were waiting at the door, with Hermione wearing an impatient look. She hurried the three boys towards the History of Magic classroom grumbling that they were going to be late. Draco commented that he didn't understand why anyone would worry about being late for the lesson in which everyone would take a nap in. Ron then commented that Hermione actually took notes in that class for the past six years. All Draco gave as a reply was an astonished look and Hermione responded by glaring at her boyfriend.
Draco smirked. "Maybe they did. They didn't expect the great Draco Malfoy to lower himself to play against them."
To the three adults in the room, it seemed as if the boys were just waiting for the spell to hit them. Suddenly the spell hit the space about a meter in front of the boys and disappeared into nothing. Both boys then grinned as they saw that the wall stopped the spell. Draco's change of the texture of the wall caused the wall to absorb the power of the spell and since the shield was still linked to their magical powers, they could feel that small amount of power making its way to their power pool. They looked at each other when they realized the potential of the wall they have constructed together. If they were actually attacked at all sides, the type of wall they had just constructed would not only prevent the spells from reaching them, it would absorbed the energy of the spells and actually become their own energy.
"Herm, Ron will know what to do, after all he is the Captain." Draco answered, seeing Ron indicate to the team to go down to the stands for lunch. Everyone but Day flew down immediately. Day just shook her head and seemed to go on practicing flying. Draco frowned. He then pulled away his attention from Day when Harry came up and collapsed in front of Draco. Draco handed him a towel that he had ready for him to wipe his perspiration so as to not get a chill. Hermione just shook her head as she started laying out the lunch the house elves put together on a picnic cloth for the team. Dean started to pour drinks for everyone.
Both Harry and Draco sat up straight. Their animagus forms clearly interacted with each other, and actually displayed… both boys blushed again. Seeing the blushes on them, Professor Dumbledore chuckled. "The only animagus forms that will interact with each other were of people who were bonded to each other."
"Nothing. Why aren't you guys eating?" She asked, trying to smile for her two 'brothers'. Both Harry and Draco frowned when they saw that she was giving them a fake grin.
Pansy kneeled down and looked at Day's body. "I heard that you are a virgin. So no one saw this before? Vincent, you won the bet right? So you get first taste of her tonight. But before you do anything; let's add some graffiti on your lovely body." She then pressed her dagger onto Day's breast and it cut into the flesh, as Day screamed from the pain. She sliced a few more times on the same breast, before doing the same to her other breast. Pansy then watched morbidly as the blood flowed down Day's torso onto the floor. She then moved on to the limbs of the girl who was withering on the floor in pain, as she slashed lines that crisscrossed each other all along her hands and legs. She then stepped back, satisfied with the large amount of blood flowing out of the girls body onto the dark floor, as the two boys behind her stepped forward, and Crabbe started to unbutton his pants.
Harry wished that he could just lay there staring into Draco's grey eyes forever and be able to forget about everything out there. He wished that he could just forget about the evil overlord who wanted to kill him for the past fifteen or so years, just because he was born into that family. He wished that he was a muggle. But if he was a muggle he would not have the chance to meet Draco, fight with him for six years and become his friend. And be attracted to him when both are living in close quarters.
Harry looked at the black-haired man who, after four years, was still on the run, after escaping from Azkaban in his third year. Since his godfather started following Professor Lupin around as his pet dog, he seemed more rested and healthy, being less pale as he was no longer being locked up. Harry hoped that Sirius knew what he was doing by being at Hogwarts but knowing Professor Dumbledore, he would try his best to protect Sirius.
"Woo… so you like someone new huh? Who is she?" Seamus tried to make it seemed that he was happy for Dean, but deep down inside, his heart was breaking.
"I love you Draco Malfoy." He smiled at Draco.
Draco pulled back from Harry and Harry looked at Draco's mercury glazed eyes. Harry breathed in deeply as he realized that Draco looked especially sexy that morning with his glazed eyes seemingly giving a come-hither look. Draco then licked his lips slowly and Harry felt a wave of arousal washing over his entire body, as blood flowed south. He slowly shifted his body till he was positioned above Draco, with the silvery blond looking up dreamily at him. In the past two months, the two boys had become quite familiar with each other's bodies during their heavy petting sessions. They found out what each like the other to do to them as well. Harry found out that for someone who was so in control of his emotions in public, Draco seemed to be totally open to him, especially during the time when they were alone together. Draco also preferred Harry to be the dominant one in the relationship. Maybe because he liked losing control to Harry, and to truly belong to another person. Harry had not been in much control of many aspects of his life and thus did not mind being the dominant one in the sexual aspect of the relationship, even if very often, it was Draco who started the ball rolling.
Harry wondered to himself, as he copied, not noticing that Draco's body froze in the middle of note-taking.
Draco nodded. "Dumbledore told me about it. Snape's a member. Sirius and Remus are too. What about it?"
"Armadillo bile, frog's eyes, powdered Billywig stingers, dewinged Lacewing flies and sliced leeches." Professor Snape nodded and started droning on and on about how the combination of the ingredients and the process of boiling the potion at which particular temperature and the duration made the portion the way it was. Harry could tell that Professor Snape really loved potions. He managed to spend the next one and a half hour telling them about the potion, and everyone was scribbling like mad on their parchments to catch as many things as they could of what the professor had recited. The class was strangely quiet, as every time a question was asked, Hermione never looked up from her parchment. All the Gryffindor students were frowning away at Hermione, wondering if she was feeling ill. Finally Professor Snape dismissed the class and all the students rushed to hand in their summer homework and to exit the class. No one in their right presence of mind would want to stay back after Snape's class.
As they entered the room, they saw Dumbledore, Sirius and Remus, before the door of the room flew shut, with a wave of Dumbledore's hand. For fun, Harry waved his hand at the door, mentally saying 'alohomora', and the door flew open. Cheekily, Draco followed him by waving his hand and the door flew shut again. They turned back to the three adults currently standing in the room with grins on their faces.
Draco cut in. "All we want is to be her support system when she wakes up. If she didn't want us there, we'll get the hell out of here. We just don't want her to wake up alone after the trauma she went through." Harry pleaded with Madam Promfrey with his eyes, till finally she nodded and shooed them out of the infirmary.
"Because you are with Potter. And Potter always knows when things happen." Blaise huffed with exasperation.
"Morning, all." He greeted everyone as he looked at his schedule to pack his bag. "Double DADA… free period… lunch… advanced charms…" he muttered as he placed the books he needed into his bag.
Draco stared at the mirror as he brushed his teeth. Harry was in the shower cubicle behind him, humming to some tune that Draco had never heard before. He shook his head at how silly Harry could be sometimes.
Draco shook his hand and let go. "And I'm Draco Malfoy. Just call me Draco will do. Thank you everyone." Ron turned back to Hermione to find that she seemed to be about to burst into tears. All she did take a deep breath, smiled at her boyfriend and start to eat. Everyone at the table started to eat too. Draco finally relaxed his rigidly held body as he realized that all of them had just accepted him into their group and from what he observed in the past, it meant that all was going to be well at least in the dorm room.
Professor Lupin turned to Draco, and asked "Do you care to elaborate?"
Suddenly, Sirius raised his wand and pointed towards the two boys, and shouted "Stupify!"
"You will realize that Snape is actually a very good judge of character. All the prefects who were chosen are people who don't want to be Death eaters. His reasoning is that in times of the war, we must have at least the prefects to keep the house safe and going, and not apparating to Voldie whenever their Dark Marks burns. Hey, I said Voldie! That name is so much easier to say." Draco grinned. Harry grinned as well. "I mean, no matter when the war starts, there will be younger students in the house. Those who had not been involved by their parents yet. These kids need the prefects around to keep them calm and safe."
"Harry, promise that you won't leave me. I lost too much. I don't want to lose you too."
, Harry thought to himself.
Draco shook his head. "You know, it's amazing how Hermione got a boyfriend. I'm amazed that she even noticed Ron."
Both boys frowned at her, before Harry ventured to sit down beside her. Both of them were looking at her as if she was going scream any moment. Then Day realized what the problem was. "You thought I'm going to scream bloody murder because you two are guys huh? In the first place I can't really remember much about… you know… all I really could recall was the first part. And somehow," she smiled up at the two of them, "I had the gut feeling that you two are not going to harm me. And I've always had a good judgment of people. Are you two the only visitors I have?"
Harry spoke up. "And magic itself is light. But the textbook will say that the true intention of the caster of that spell is what actually denotes it light or dark. Due to that, it is actually very difficult to justify. Killing a person to save a town. Is that spell considered dark or light? I cast a spell to trip a friend. Dark or Light?"
"Dray. I decided last night that 'Draco' is too formal. It is less formal to moan out 'Dray' when we are making love. Isn't it?" Harry grinned, when Draco lifted his eyebrow.
"It's Dean isn't it?" Draco asked softly.
Seamus pouted. "How come we don't get such good deals? You get Professor Lupin for the first lesson? When do you see Snape?"
The whole group burst into laughter as Harry was trying unsuccessfully to frown at the twins as he absolutely hated people making fun of the fact that he was the Boy-Who-Lived. Ginny finally rescued him by asking everyone to not laugh at him any more and Hermione suggested that they go find a compartment.
"Why are you doing this?" Day demanded, as she stared at her wand.
One day, I might just come back to it. Thanks for reading, for those who made it to this point.
"All these intention to harm, intention to control, all it actually means is to have the ability to do something to others. When you control a certain person's actions, that person lose power to you. The Imperius curse allows you to have the power over a person's actions. The Cruciatus Curse allows you to have power over a person's pain. The Killing Curse allows you power over a person's lifespan. They say that to be immortal means that you have power over nature. The power over something is what defines the dark magic and the dark creatures." Draco explained.
Dumbledore finally said, "Like two parts of a whole. The gold thread indicates soul mates."
Dean opened his mouth then shut it again without saying anything. He then did it again. He breathed in deeply and let his breath out and tried opening his mouth again. All this while Harry only looked at him with a questioning look, hoping that it would encourage him to open up to him. Dean never came to him with problems before. His roommates were all so different in personality. Ron would combust at hearing a single word that seemed like an insult towards his girlfriend or housemates. Neville was the insecure type who had the tendency to go speechless with fright in front of professors. Seamus was the flirty and bouncy type who seemed to be forever moving and talking. Dean was the quiet type who seemed to be mature and reasonable at all times. In other words, Dean seemed to be the last person to come to Harry with a problem.
"You idiot. You are scaring them. Let me introduce this idiot and myself. I'm Godric Gryffindor and this idiot is Salazar Slytherin. Helga Hufflepuff and Rowena Ravenclaw are out wondering now. The four of us are what you termed as the 'guardians' of Hogwarts. We make sure the wards and all are in place and that we alert the correct people when enemies attack. We are a secret that is only revealed to the headmasters of Hogwarts."
"I wanted to talk to you yesterday, remember? When it was eleven o'clock and you were not back from your detention, we got worried. Then there was this special map that showed the whole of Hogwarts and the position of the people in the castle as well. We checked it and… found that you seemed to be injured. We rushed out of the dorms like a herd of bulls after us, as all eight of us came out to search for you. And then, when we found you…" Draco broke off, as the sight of Day lying there all bloody flashed in front of his eyes.
"We need to test the extent of your powers. How deep is the connection between the two of you?" Dumbledore asked with twinkling eyes, making Draco, Harry and Remus blushed with the direct question. Sirius only continued to grin at them.
He finally confirmed his sexual preference last year, when he found himself checking his roommates out. He was so shocked that he collapsed on his bed while all his other roommates were still getting ready for bed. Ron was so concerned when he saw his pale face that he wanted to bring him to the infirmary immediately. Seamus Finnegan, one of his other roommates just asked Harry what was wrong. Harry, in his shocked state of mind, did not even attempt to lie and blurted out "I was checking you guys out." The silence after he said that made Harry look at his roommates' faces. Four pairs of eyes were staring at him unblinkingly. Then Seamus bounced up from his position beside Harry and announced "Oh Harry, don't worry. I've been checking all of you out since fourth year." Everyone turned to stare at Seamus while he happily went on changing in front of the rest.
Albus fumed. All the planning he had done over the holiday period had been for nothing! Now, he had to do everything all over again, because the two boys had bonded. He had to make doubly sure that any “accident” to occur to either boy could not be traced back to him. Some days he wished he’d told the Dursleys to just drown the brat!
The sandwiches appeared before them and the two girls ate tiredly. When they were finished they sat for a while to allow their meal to settle.
This bought  a bout of laughter from all those surrounding them.
“I was dismissed because I allowed a patient to die. She’d had a difficult birth and by the time the young one had been born she had lost too much blood. It was either save the babe or lose both of them. There was nothing I could do for the mother, even if I had tried. My supervisor didn’t see it that way. It was his niece and whilst her husband and parents forgave me saying that it wasn’t my fault as even her original doctor had said that should she get with child she had a large chance of not surviving.” He shrugged. “I ended up losing my job due to him forcing it to go through court.”
“What’s wrong?”
Here I am (Here I am)
Amelia chuckled, breaking the slowly growing tension between the two Malfoy men. “It is perfectly understandable, you Mr Malfoy. You need to make sure your family is kept safe. It is highly commendable of you to go through all of this trouble.”
“If you are thinking that I am asking for my two Pack members to come here once a week for a deeper clean, then yes,” Tobias stated calmly as he placed his empty mug down. “The worker who is in contact with them will join them. We will pay ten galleons per treatment,” he continued.
Tobias and Draco exchanged looks as the rest of The Pack surrounded them and slowly started to walk towards the castle Absent-mindedly, the three in the centre started to walk with them.
“Thank you Sir,” she muttered softly with a bow. “I shall inform the rest of The Pack so you do not suffer through repeat questions.”
“I don’t care if the Dark Lord himself is in there with him. This is important!”
“We’ll do it free.”
Whimpering softly, Remus pulled two bags out of his pocket and enlarged them. Harry emptied them into two piles at his feet. Draco gasped when he realised what the bags held. There, at Harry’s feet, in tiny slivers, were his wand and broomstick. Harry started to smoulder. Everyone backed away and looked up when Thanatos arrived. They watched as he landed on a perch close to Harry and cooed softly.
The person that had shocked everyone to silence, however, was Charlie. One day the second oldest red-head walked into the estate with wide blank eyes and shaking hands. It had taken almost two hours for him to snap out of his state and the first thing out of his mouth was ‘I’ve been bonded.’ His eyes then widened and he hastened to explain before Tobias exploded.
This was how Tom, Lucius, Narcissa, Severus and Remus found them half an hour later after seeing off the guests. The five of them had known that they wouldn’t have consummated their bond that night, since the both of them had been deeply affected by the past fortnight.
“Just because I said you couldn’t use magic doesn’t mean that you have to stop eating so you can focus on paperwork Love,” Draco sighed.
“Oh, that was amazing,” Draco purred as he stretched to his fullest.
“And I swear the deaths of one Albus Dumbledore, one Ronald Weasley and one Hermione Granger to be accomplished by my hand, with the aid of Draco if he wishes it.” A golden glow surrounded them.
“Hello,” she whispered, placing her hands over the unsuspecting witness’s eyes.
“Please accept this gift and those that follow as a symbol of my growing affection both of and for you. If you accept this gift now that you have been told this, I will take it as a sign I have your permission to court you in this manner. If you do not accept this gift, then I will not bother you with anymore gifts until the day we fulfil the marriage contracts we both signed.”
~Yep,it’sanotherline~
Hope you enjoy. As always, tell if you see a mistake. I'm going back to my chocolaty goodness, and no sweetie, I'm not sharing. my chocate! :p
“I’m not sorry to say that I will not be going to Madam Pomphrey for quite a while,” Tobias stated lazily. “You see, she isn’t qualified for what I need. I have a healer that is trained in both male and female neonatal areas – one who has not broken trust with me, my husband, or our families. Now, if you don’t mind, I need to go sit down and eat. Thank you for your help in obtaining the objects I needed Professor.”
“Off with you,” Minerva scowled, trying her hardest to not show her amusement.
“Firstly, because if I didn’t then Tobias would have been in tears for the rest of the night, then become more hormonal than normal tomorrow. Secondly, I would do anything for him and thirdly,” he smiled grimly, “it hasn’t been the worst thing I’ve tried since his cravings started.”
“Now, I suggest both of you go back to your dors immediately. Mr Weasley, you first, and I will know if you don’t get there.” He waited until he was positive the Weasel was no longer in hearing before turning to the girl.
“Dobby will be right back with Master Bias’ food.” He bowed slightly then popped away.
“Promise?” Tobias asked with large mostly green eyes as the rest of The Pack arrived and crowded the doorway with Draco rubbing his temples in resignation.
“We can’t say,” Fred stated.
“Ginevra, Fred, George, Bill and Charlie Weasley are not to be harmed at any time as they are members of my pack, with my own mark burnt into their flesh. One that note –” Tobias waved his hand over Draco’s head, turning his long, silky blonde hair red and gold. “Thank you. You are dismissed.”
“You look troubled youngster.”
“London Bridge is falling down,
Severus chuckled slightly. “I wouldn’t allow him near my books when he’s like this either.” He grunted slightly when a solid body ran into his.
When the girl opened her mouth, Amelia found herself thinking longingly of the students who wanted to avoid a visit to the Healer.
“Yes girl, Master,” Minerva snapped. “The ownership brand is just that – a mark of possession. In layman’s terms, it means you are less than a slave to the person whose magic is in that mark. You are a possession, nothing more. You are fighting against your Master’s orders, so he – or she – is punishing you by allowing you to see written words but removing your knowledge of them when you wish to read them. You will find that you will be able to read again when you have done what they wish.”
Draco smiled and snuggled into the warmth behind him. “My point is, you are both powerful and dangerous, but underneath it all you are just a hopeless romantic.”
As he read the letter addressed to him, a huge smile plastered itself onto his face. Grabbing the letter from his son, he read through it quickly before jumping to his feet.
Lucius chuckled at his son’s face and looked at Severus.
“Then let’s be off!” Tobias cheered, shooing everyone from the room amidst much laughter.
-Timey Whimey Stuff part 2-
“Not more paperwork!” he groaned.
Draco nodded and tried drowning the taste left in his mouth with spiced pumpkin juice. When he looked up, he noticed the incredulous looks he house-mates were giving him. “What?”
The Minister paled slightly, seeing a flash of colour appear on the youth’s cheek.
He grinned and Ron whimpered once more as Tobias dragged the sharp blade over his tongue, drawing blood. Wordlessly, he sent the blade to the redhead’s scrotum. His screams echoed around the hollowed out tower and more than one person turned green as they watched the boy eat his own testicles.
Draco shook his head and signed for Vincent to come over, only to be interrupted by a soft growl and fading footsteps. “That man will be the death of himself,” he muttered, rubbing his temples. “Do us all a favour Lupin and pull your head out of your arse quickly or I’ll be the one going temperamental on you. I would like to have my husband for more than half an hour a day.”
Tom was seated at his desk watching as Lucius and Remus destroyed his office.
“Enter.”
“Iron and steel will bend and bow,
“Hello my fellow Ladles and Jellyspoons! Did you miss me?” Tobias, Draco and the two daemons appeared.
The mother and Father shared a loving look at the obvious connection the two newlyweds had. “Please, have a seat. We have much to discuss before the night can truly begin.”
When not in the kitchen with Lucius, he was in the library recording the books he found there. So far, he had found several rare books that were hidden amongst the muggle books. To Tom’s surprise, Tobias had placed a muggle book on his bedside table with a note asking him to read it. He hadn’t understood why he had wanted him to read it, but once he’d started, he hadn’t been able to put it down. It had been written by a muggle named Jeffrey Deaver, and he’d just started another of his books.
She had woken an hour ago in the Infirmary under the watchful eyes of the transfiguration professor, the potions professor and the school’s healer. She had been asked multiply questions about what she could remember about what had happened and she had answered them to the best of her ability before hesitantly asking how the Zabini boy was. All three adults had thinned their lips. She had been informed that he had a broken wrist and a dislocated jaw, but he would be alright in time for breakfast. It had been then that they had informed her of the claiming mark that rested at the base of her skull.
Reactions :3
Zog created an earthen seat and sat. Draco straightened when his husband did.
Tobias nuzzled into the flesh behind Draco’s ear, making him giggle slightly. “Let’s go down for breakfast, Dragon.”
Ginny and Luna looked around the Great Hall nervously. That morning had come with the announcement that only the fifth and sixth year students hadn’t been seen by the Healers and now the two girls were, once again, separated from the rest of their Pack. Unconsciously, they reached out to each other and held the other’s hand tightly.
“Goodnight.”
Tobias nodded, thinking. “Alright. How about from now until dinner everyone does what he or she want. After dinner we come back here for games until the rest of The Pack come. I have something we have to do tomorrow. I will also invite Sev to the meeting, if he doesn’t already know there is one.”
Chuckling, Harry pulled on his shirt. “I did mark my territory as well, but Draco here is too much of a prude to take his shirt off in front of others, so …” He grinned when Draco responded by taking off his shirt and throwing it at Tobias, hitting him in the face. Tobias’ eyes roved over his husband’s marked torso before he walked up to him and latched onto the skin where his collarbone was closest to his throat.
Silently Tobias held out one of his hands. Visibly shaking, Draco placed his hand into his husbands and allowed him to place it on his bulge. After a few moments a radiant smile burst across the Malfoy heir’s face and he sank to his knees, whispering to his hidden child.
“It is a powdered bacterium that I sprinkle onto my gardens at Longbottom Manor,” Neville explained patting the package he had returned to his pocket. “It is harmless until magic is added to it. Once magic has been added, then the only person who is safe from it is the one who’s magic woke it.”
Tobias shook his head. “Pateras, you do know that white isn’t your colour, don’t you?”
That night Tobias had finalised the plans to ensure he and his father were free to do what they wished … well … within reason naturally. While Dumbledore was held in the magic-depleting cells in the Ministry, Tom, Tobias and Severus were planning the end of the war.
When one of the wolves had Ron’s wand in its jaws, Luna changed back and walked towards him. “I am under my own power as you know – or should know – that spells to control others don’t work when either of them is in animagus form. And I support Tobias with 100% of my own will.” She leaned in closer to him and cast a spell that blocked his ability to speak of what she was going to say.
If anyone in the common room noticed the single crystal tear making its way down his cheek, they didn’t say anything as they surrounded their Lord and his mate.
It was lunch by the time McGonagall, Tobias and Draco returned to the school with their purchases. In all four seats had been bought; one for Minerva’s office, one for Severus’ office, one for Tobias’ office and one for the Great Hall.
“You don’t have to give up sex yet, Bi,” Draco said softly as he carried the unresisting teen to their room. “Algernon only mentioned that it could be a possibility later in the pregnancy.”
Draco blushed slightly, a small smile on his face. “I … I think I may,” he paused and took a deep breath. “How did you know that you loved Remus?”
“May I ask why?” She asked tentatively.
The Shadow Daemon grinned toothily and bowed. “Pleasure to meet the loved ones of our Akzant’tra.”
When the owl had left their sight, Ginny gave the letter to Luna. As she read, Luna’s mind started to work double-time with what she could do to the weasel the next time she saw him. She smiled dreamily as she handed the letter back to its recipient – she could hardly wait.
“You live at our place to help with –”
“Please give my compliments to your brother for the meal,” Tobias said when he had finished most of it, only having his drink and snacks left. “If all meals taste this good, then I understand now why Professor Flitwick can often be heard complaining about Hogwart’s food tasting bland.”
Ginny smothered a giggle. “I asked if you were going to explain why you want this done and why us in particular.”
Grapplefang joined in with his own laughter, making Amelia shudder at the unnatural sound.
Narcissa smiled. “Even though he doesn’t say it, I believe our Lord misses his heir. I’ve noticed that he seems a bit more distracted then he used to be, and his eyes are not quite the same as before Tobias joined our side. Do you think that could be the boy’s doing?”
“Okay. We’ll wait here,” Luna said as she guided Ginny to the food table. “If we are meditating, just place your hand on our shoulders so you don’t startle us.”
While they waited, several of their school peers saw them and came over to congratulate the couple and see the small bundle for themselves. Draco acted the part of proud parent and bragged about the past two weeks with obvious joy and love.
This was followed by the sound of leather hitting flesh and a muffled curse, like someone talking through clenched teeth.
“I’m sure the Aurors will be very happy to meet you,” he purred, making the woman pale. “Be assured,” he continued, “that your boss will also be investigated. It is against your very oath to take a life and it is against magic to take the life of a new-born babe.
“Tell Potter I said I’d be glad to help him with Weasel and his mudblood.” He then stepped into the flame and disappeared.
“I see no problem with it,” Lord Patil said, speaking for the first time.
Tobias laughed and let all his barriers – both natural and formed – down, shutting the hat up.
“Made my life harder,” he pouted. “He managed to somehow convince Lord Patil to sign a marriage contract between his daughters and the Weasley twins. Molly and Arthur signed it as well, so now I need to talk to Lord Patil, the goblins, Padma and Pavarti, Fred and George and Madam Bones to decide on what to do about it and I can’t start anything until both sets of twins are checked!” Tobias huffed in annoyance. “All I CAN do about it until then is talk to the goblins, Madam Bones and Lord Patil to discuss potential plans of action depending on what we know of the four of them.”
The silence that met that statement seemed to last forever as time seemed to stand still.
“If you don’t start now, there is the possibility that later in the pregnancy you will be bedridden. You must understand, Tobias, that you are still early in the pregnancy itself. Due to your upbringing, you have some damage to your skeletal structure. Your bones aren’t as strong as they should be – and not even your phoenix can heal all of the damage. He did a very admirable job, but even with his help, you still need time for the majority of it to fix itself. Do you understand?”
“I’ve taken out your
Deloris screamed as a loud sizzling came from where the metal touched and the scent of burning hair filled the room.
“No, Alpha. I was just reading about the bond you and Drakontas have formed, and it appears that you have a partial creature bond with a soul mate bond.” Murmuring broke out amongst those surrounding them, but when they saw the slight smiles on the lips of both bonded, they settled down.
“Let’s get this started,” Amelia groaned. “I can’t believe it is only time for breakfast.”
Albus Dumbledore let his fake twinkling eyes take in the population of Hogwarts. Smiling, he welcomed them back, while internally he raged. The one spy he fully trusted within the Dark Lords ranks had been returned to him earlier that morning. The man had every joint in his body snapped and it looked as if a vicious animal had attacked him. A mark – the death mark with flaming wings coming from the sides – was burnt into his chest. Below the mark was a message for him stating, “Thanks for the toy.”
***Flashback***
“It also seems that the reason some people are better at handling dragons than others is due to their receptiveness to dark magic,” Charlie threw a half-grin at Bill. “Guess who was the most surprised when Gerda – that’s the Hungarian Horntail that Tobias pulled in his fourth year -  picked me up by the back of the shirt and placed me in the very centre of her barely-out-of-the-shell hatchlings.”
There's no stronger word I can use
While Neville was inspecting the room, Luna was preparing her desired instruments of torture. With a whispered spell she vanished from sight as her special brand of magic surrounded her. With another whispered spell, her victim was silenced and stung spread eagle at waist height by ropes attached to the bands. With another whispered word, the red-head woke and whimpered slightly due to the pain in his wrists and ankles.
~My apologies, Alpha. May I do anything else for you before I allow you inside? ~
Draco felt an arm go around his waist, as he was manipulated into position before the portrait.
“Everyone, this is Raithia. She is going to be the Guardian portrait for my rooms. She can no longer harm you. Raithia, these are my godfathers – Severus Snape and Remus Lupin.”
He felt the smile on Tobias’ lips when he planted a kiss on the top of his head. “I am dangerous, Dragon, and I am powerful. I am also a hopeless romantic – but only for and towards you. You, Drakontas, are the only being I would humiliate myself willingly for. You deserve nothing but the best. Nothing will stop me from giving you the best, not even loosing respect in Pateras’ eyes. Now, let’s go down for breakfast.”
“Back to what we were saying. Bi has to still act as if he’s Harry, so even though he wants to be with his marked ones, it might be better if only Draco, Crabbe and Goyle search him out, as you normally do. He also requests that whatever happens tonight, just go with it and act like you’d normally do. You’d better get on the train now. We’ll see you on either the first Hogsmead weekend, or when you visit your parents for the holidays – whichever comes first.” Then they were gone.
“Something is going to happen today,” Tobias stated, relaxing into his husband’s embrace. I don’t know what and I don’t know when, but it will happen.”
“We’ll put it in with the rest of his important paperwork,” Fred said as he watched George tucked the scroll into a secret pocket of his robe. “He might not get to it for a few days if Draco has any say about it, but it will get looked over as soon as he has a chance.”
“This meeting of members is now over,” Neville announced seriously when everything was completed. “Good hunting all.”
Everyone looked up and watched the owls appear and vanish – all except one. Tobias stared into the deep eyes of the owl before him. Can you come back this time tomorrow so I have time to properly write a response?” The owl bobbed its head and disappeared.
“This meeting is dismissed!” Tom yelled before running out of the room, leaving confusion in his wake.
Once the words were stated, Remus pounced on the other man and with a murmured apology for what he was about to do, bit down as hard as he could on the flesh behind his left ear. He waited until the magic building in the air settled itself deep inside his chest before letting go of the spot, licking the blood gently from the wound, whining apologetically. It wasn’t until the wound closed that Remus noticed his most precious object had fallen asleep where he sat.
“One of Father’s business associates from Rome bought his son with him when he came to a business function. Father mentioned that I attended an exclusive boarding school in Scotland and when we were away from the crowds; his father asked me how I found Hogwarts. He, the Father, is apparently going to ask father about a contract between our families – a courting contract, not a bonding one.”
Draco appeared from seemingly no where and settled beside his resting husband. “Hi,” he said softly, smiling down at the tired-looking male.
Remus struggled to keep a pouting face but failed as he started laughing. “We are bigger children then our godchildren,” he managed to wheeze. His eyes turned soft as he looked at his lover. “I’ve missed this Sev,” he stated softly. “I’ve missed your playful side. I miss YOU being you. I never see you without your masks on, I admit it is mostly my own fault for taking you and our relationship for granted.”
Chapter 50
His voice changed as he went back to what he was saying to the group. “Then there was the snake thing with Ron’s father.  The cream of the crop though, was Siri going through the veil.”
Lucius, Narcissa, Remus, Tom and Severus looked down to hide the evidence of their amusement as Draco stood behind Tobias and started to rub the muscles in his neck. A bowl appeared before Tobias with a small pop and before anyone could react, Tobias had attacked it, moaning in ecstasy at the sweet juice coating his tongue with every bite.
Everyone, Harry included, stopped moving. You could hear a pin drop in the great hall. No one breathed, but Harry’s shaking got worse. Jaws had to be scrapped off the floor when Draco Malfoy – resident Death Eater wannabe – wrapped his arms around the raven-haired youth and started rocking with him, singing softly.
Neville watched and listened as the Patil twins tried to convince the Minister to allow them to be in the same hall. Smirking internally, he walked over to them.
Tobias stretched with a small smile on his lips, a devilish idea sparking in his mind. As stealthily as he could, he tied both of Draco’s hands and feet to the bed and then straddled him, running his hands reverently up the taunt stomach and chest to the broad shoulders. He leant down and started to lick and nibble at the smooth skin of his husband’s throat. Ignoring the moans, groans and whimpers that were coming from Draco’s mouth, he slowly made his way down the chest to lick, suck, nibble and pinch the dusky pin nipples, making Draco jerk awake, causing he loose ties to tighten, making him struggle to reach his husband.
Lucius looked around the room, searching for his son. When he noticed that his son and son-in-law were not in the room, he went searching for them. When a pale and shaking Lucius re-joined the group, everyone stopped and looked at him.
“It’s been a long and busy day,” Amelia said. “I never expected to get such a headache”
Tobias nodded, running his hands slowly from the top of Draco’s head and over his neck, back and shoulders. “I’m ready to be yours, Draco,” he whispered.
Blaise looked at her and blinked. “Never mind,” he muttered as he turned and walked to the table, missing the amused smirk on the blonde girl’s lips.
Tobias nodded and turned to his pack. “You know where your rooms are. You have half an hour to get settled. Change into muggle wear, we are going to start arm and shoulder training. Dinner after. Neville, you have an extra 15 minutes to talk.” He turned to Neville’s Grandmother. “I’m sorry to have to limit the time you can speak to Skoteinos, but we are on a schedule. May I offer a room to you for the night so you can catch up tomorrow?”
Harry beamed at him and hugged him tight before drawing him into a deep kiss. After several minutes, they separated gasping for breath.
“The one that got me was that he managed to talk the sorting hat out of putting him in Slytherin and managed to trick everyone, including the Head of the Snake House, that he was pure lion.”
“No idea! You have no idea! How the fuck do you think I feel! I didn’t even know that it was damn possible! Don’t forget I was raised by muggles – Come on say it with me. Mmmuuuuuggggglllleeeesss. How the hell am I supposed to handle it you narrow-minded, thin dicked bottle blonde!”
When Tobias didn’t arrive in time for dinner, Draco started to worry. After eating, he rushed back to the common room, hoping he would find Tobias there. The rest of the sixth year Slytherins followed him and froze in place when they saw their leader. He was curled up on an armchair, hair still wet from the shower and fast asleep.
“It’s not a changing bite,” he assured her, “it’s a claiming bite. Were’s mark what is theirs in one of two ways – Urinating on it or biting it. I am the chosen mate of a Dominant werewolf and I refuse to be used as a urinal.”
Neville laughed softly. “I understand. Sometimes I don’t recognise myself when I look in the mirror.”
Tom looked at his son and pouted. “I missed my honorary nephew. I’m allowed to annoy him.”
“You … that thing … Big … How …”
“I’m assuming he is talking about seeing a Ron Weasley that isn’t eating,” Pansy stated in amusement.
“But it’s too early,” Draco stated, paling.
“Who is this ‘Randal’ you are talking about?” Lady Ariandra asked. “I do not believe that I have heard of him before.”
Theo watched Blaise’s eyes shine with excitement as he watched the Mudblood Granger run from the Hall. “What are you planning?” he whispered to his friend as the sound of the closing doors echoed around the room.
Tobias raised his head from Draco’s chest. “I want to know how you got those herbs!”
“Well, Mr Riddle, I must congratulate you on finally escaping the old man’s clutches – Even if it has taken you five long years to do so.”
“O-of course,” Cornelius stammered, terrified of the man before him.
On the other side of the room, something was niggling at Ron’s brain. It wasn’t until he stopped shovelling food into the black hole he called a mouth that he registered the music. He froze in place because even though the voices were different, the song was very familiar.
Draco looked up at him. “Bi?”
Tom entered the Chamber of Secrets with wonder I his eyes. Not even in his youth had he believed that there was more to this place then what he had seen originally. He was astounded by the amount of work his heir had put into his old hideout. He followed the Potion’s Master to the room where the four founder’s portraits hung.
Tobias noticed the look of surprise on Draco’s face and smirked. “Even poison would be preferable to spending any more time with them two.”
A deep silence filled the room at this statement. Tobias, who was deep within his own thoughts, didn’t notice it.
Chapter 48
Harry stopped and leaned against the doorway. “Is ‘Harry’ really that hard to pronounce?”
My Fair Lady.”
A loud SMACK echoed in the sudden silence of the room as Pavarti held her cheek, looking at her twin sister in shock.
“If Draco had known what I was going to do last night, he would have tried to stop me. What I had to do was extremely dangerous. If Draco had started to fight me while I was in the ritual, it would have killed me. Having Drakontas pissed off at me was the only way either of us survived.” Tobias looked into Neville’s eyes. “I know you thought that you were protecting me, but you still need to be punished. As such, your physical training will be increased, as will the weight you are to carry through it and the time you will be woken will be an hour earlier than the rest of The Pack. You will now be starting your physical training in real life with me – all of you will be.”
“I told him about our time in the Ministry Grandmother,” Blaise stated, stepping forward. “He deserved to know what happened and how you treated his heir.”
“At least he is better than the pathetic brown-nosing psychosomatic sycophantic parasites that are scampering around most wizarding homes – and don’t get me started on those that work for them! Dobby is a damned good and loyal worker who not only does everything he can for his present employer, but he also has an actual brain in his head instead of the myxomycete sludge that denotes other of his station.”
“Human, dikos mou lykos?”
“Dobby will.”
Ginny put the quill in her hand down with a soft groan of relief, that quickly turned to a moan as Theo grabbed the hand in question and dug his own fingers into the cramped flesh. Neither of them noticed the glare that a certain body guard threw at the smaller male.
Luna smirked. “You both come shopping with us next time we are in London – in muggle London, not Diagon Alley.”
“We’d better change, Bi. We’ll be there soon.”
“I don’t know why they did it Harry. I cannot tell you why they did what they did, but I will tell you right now that you will never, ever again go through that.  You are safe here, and I will do everything I can to make sure you survive through this year.  I do not need you to make an unbreakable, but I will take you up on the offer to get inside your head,” he joked lightly.
“Calm down? CALM DOWN! I DON’T THINK SO! NOT AFTER LEARNING SHE WILL BE IN MY TERRITORY AGAIN!”
“WHAT ABOUT MY SHCOOLING?” Pavarti screeched.
Tobias laughed. “I assume Bumblewhore sent you a summons to ‘discipline’ me for being resorted?” At his nod, Tobias grinned. “You are going to need to explain a few things to Nona and Anadochos for me, please. Wait until they have recovered from this morning, though. I swear Malfoys were not created for manual labour – even of the magical variety.” Remus snorted.
“Right,” Pansy inhaled. “Bouno, Skia and Dynamo. Your parchment has only one thing on it and it is vital it is done to perfection. Your parchment is dedicated to the protection of Alpha and Beta.”
You're my safest place to hide
The noise level of the Hall rose drastically and Tobias was positive that he had been deafened.
Tobias relaxed into Draco’s side as he watched his Pack interact as a whole once again. It was only three days since Dumbledore had attacked the small family so not only were his entire Pack – including the older Weasley boys – in attendance, but his father, godparents, Padma and Augusta Longbottom were also with them.
Remus smiled at the shocked and admiring glances Tobias was getting from those around him, Draco and the twins laughter still rolling around them. Remus then left the youngsters to their chaos.
“Satan’s Will.”
Neville, as Tobias’ second, and Pansy, as Draco’s, had the same edging in the same colour, but had cloaks the colour of thunderheads. The rest of the group were in a green so dark it could have been black with poison green embroidery around the edges that told of that person’s talents – that was if you looked close enough. The outfit was completed with dark bronze dragon hide boots with a silver dragon burnt into the inside ankle. Overall, The Pack looked hot, and boy! Did they know it!
Minerva laughed and pulled the shocked younger man into a one-armed hug. Severus growled deep in his chest as he planned his next lot of torture for The Pack members who were present due to their amusement at his predicament.
Sitting down, Tobias opened the package to find a small green and grey stuffed toy dragon. He hugged it close and smelt sandalwood and cinnamon. Squeezing it tighter, he heard a click and a soft voice started talking to him.
“Yeah,” Tobias agreed quietly. He looked at Draco with slightly lowered lids. “I’m curious, Drakontas. If this is what a couple does when they first wake up, what things do they do when night falls?”
Pansy shook her head. “Like I was saying, because he started with the morning sickness, we were late since none of us are willing to leave Tobias since his life – and that of his child – has been threatened more than once.”
A matronly-looking woman clasped her hands together and beamed as she looked out over the congregated students.
He was five steps away from his destination when his eyes widened and his hands flew to the now obvious bump.
Hermione curled up on the over-stuffed armchair in the Gryffindor common room with a book, stubbornly ignoring the rushing memories and urging to report them. She may have been branded by this mark, but it would be a cold day in Hell before she gave into it. Slowly she got deeper and deeper into the book she was reading. Half an hour later a high pitched scream woke everyone in Gryffindor tower. Everyone hurried to the common room to find Hermione bawling her eyes out while staring at the book in her hands.
When the suction stopped, Draco let out a moan, half-regretful, half-relieved. He watched with dazed eyes as Tobias lifted his head to above the water’s surface. He whined when Tobias nuzzled into him.
“Shh, I’m sorry as well,” Tobias murmured, leaning into the man. “I don’t have any control over my emotions any more. They just levelled out properly today. I’ve missed you Sev.”
“So you are saying that I shouldn’t have eaten a specially prepared meal in my own set of rooms with my husband. Or was it the hour of slow dancing before having a long, hot, relaxing bath that I shouldn’t have done? How about the full body massage that I fell asleep half-way through? Just because I woke up with my husband’s cock buried deep inside my arse doesn’t mean that we spent all night fucking – not that it would be any business of yours if I had decided to ride him long and hard through the night. If you must know, I was in and out of sleep all night throwing up.”
Silence reigned as the two stared at each other.
"Brother, excited?" Day stopped behind Draco, and embraced him from behind.
Dumbledore smiled at the two boys opposite him. "In the last few days, did you feel especially contented just to be with each other?"
"For who?" Draco tried denying it.
The next period was Herbalogy. Of the whole group, only Harry, Draco and Hermione had a free period, as the rest headed towards the greenhouses. The three of them who were free made their way to the library, with Harry whining all the way.
"Well, what if that person… is a guy? Does that mean that I'm gay?"
Draco growled. "Touch my cock." He whispered.
Draco's eyebrows went up. "This is even more impressive than before. And it's quite hard for someone to impress ME."
Her answer almost made him choke on the juice. "Almost did." He turned to stare at her. Day looked up to find everyone staring at her. "I read up about the houses before I came. Hated snakes and green. So when that hat suggested Slytherin, I threatened to take a scissors to it and for that action, it deemed me brave enough to be a Gryffindor. So here I am." She went on eating like it was nothing.
Harry reached out when he saw that Draco seemed to be in a panic and grasped Draco's wrist tightly. "Draco, listen to me. LISTEN. Voldemort does not know. You are not in anymore danger than you were before, yet. No death eaters will be that stupid to go to him and tell him that he's not the heir. I don't think your father knew. That's why he didn't say anything. Voldemort would never have guessed that the Malfoy family that was under his control for so long is in actual fact hiding the heir. Calm down. Take a deep breath." Harry said in a commanding voice. Draco took a deep breath and found him calming down. His mind started moving very fast, accessing the situation. Upon evaluation, he realized that Harry was correct. Nobody would be so stupid as to tell You-know-who the truth if they wanted to keep themselves alive. Voldemort, assuming that he himself was the Heir, would not attempt to order anyone to trace the Slytherin bloodlines. When he was positive that he had his emotions under control, he looked up at the rest, who were still staring at him.
At that particular moment, Pansy strolled into the Great Hall with Crabbe and Goyle. She purposely chose to walk past the Gryffindor group.
"Dean! Were you checking Draco out? How could you! You don't even check ME out, how could you check HIM out!" Seamus pouted, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Seeing the sunshine grin plastered on Day's face, Draco was suddenly grasped by a wave of protectiveness for her. Somehow, in the two months that he was here, he had gained the family that he never had.
"No, Harry," Dumbledore cut him off, "I now have to do another spell. Allow me." Dumbledore then muttered a spell while pointing his wand at Harry, and all a sudden, a golden thread sprang out and twirled a few rounds around Harry. It then went flying towards Draco and twirled a few rounds as well, before heading back to Dumbledore's wand and the thread disappeared. Dumbledore then sighed.
"This is interesting. Even the Slytherin class that I had yesterday didn't come up with this point. Many of us put down Slytherins because of house rivalry. I'm a Gryffindor. Somehow when I was sorted into the house, I just hated everything to do with snakes, green and silver, you know… However, years after I graduated, I sat down one day, and wondered, what made me not like that house? Every student who was born in within the wizarding world tends to link Slytherins with dark arts. For the Muggle-borns, the first thing they heard was, 'hope you don't get sorted into Slytherin'. All of you, with the exception of Mr Malfoy were never in Slytherin. What made you not like them?" Professor Lupin asked.
"You are kidding me! I really love that dog, but letting it eat at the table is too much huh?" Ron exclaimed, as he sat down. Sirius' eyes narrowed and a growl escaped him.
"Did Dumbledore just tell us to go have sex?" Draco grinned.
"Hiding your emotions. Everyone tells me that they can read me like an open book. I don't want Voldemort to read me so easily." Harry commented.
"What are you looking at?" Draco asked. He came back to the table with the books he needed, but when he saw the seat without Harry, he thought that Harry had left. Then he realized that Harry's bag was still on the table and when he looked around, he saw Harry standing at the window, looking out.
Harry nodded. "We started out planning our so called next step regarding Voldie. Then… I blurted out that I like him. Both of us agreed to take things slowly. We don't want to rush. And… well… we kissed. And it was perfect." Harry was relieved that Sirius didn't seem to disapprove of the relationship.
Snape took the parchment from her and read through it. His face was even paler than before when he finished with the parchment. He passed it to Professor McGonagall who winced at the parchment when reading through it.
Draco then recalled that in the past, whenever the whole group settled down to eat, Harry would choose a seat first and everyone would settle into seats around and in front of him. Wherever he went, it was the same case. At least Ron and Hermione would be with him at almost all times. Students from Gryffindor seemed to know where the other housemates were and had the habit of keeping an eye out on their fellow housemates and Harry. Was this the protection that Dumbledore was talking about? That the students understood that in the case of an attack they would all have to make sure that they are shielding Harry with at least their bodies? The paintings along the hallways all knew who Harry Potter was and at the first sign of Harry in danger, they would alert the teachers and the headmaster. Even the house elves were familiar with Harry and his group of friends. So all they were going to do was to include him in their actions and protect him along with Harry. Realizing that there was a protection network already in place around him made him relaxed a little more, as he felt slightly more protected. It was true that he would lose the privacy that he had back in the Slytherin house as everyone only noted their own business, but at least he would be able to sleep more in peace.
