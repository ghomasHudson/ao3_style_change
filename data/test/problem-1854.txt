"I'm not freaked out," Harry said, only lying a little bit. He didn't want this to break them, either, though, truthfully, he still wasn't sure what he felt. There was a lot to process.
Harry nodded, his stomach churning too violently to speak as Draco casually reminded him that they hadn't actually figured everything out just yet.
"Harry." Vaguely Harry registered Draco calling his name, but he'd just figured out how to get Merlin to shoot green sparks out of his tiny little wand and he was utterly absorbed. "Harry!" This time the tone was firm and sharp, jolting Harry out of his game. He turned towards Draco.
"You could what, Harry?" Parvati asked sharply. "Lose control and do something stupid? What secret interrogation skills do you have that Fathi and the rest of his team don't? He's been doing this a lot longer than either of us have."
Harry's face grew warm and he took a hurried sip of his beer, his heart racing with giddiness and guilt. Apparently the spring in his step of late had not gone unnoticed by his friends, and there'd been plenty of good-natured ribbing all night in an attempt to get Harry to fess up to a new lover. He'd been unable to hide his goofy smile at the teasing, thinking of Draco and the glorious month they'd spent together dating and exploring a whole new side of Harry. They'd had a couple of additional ageplay scenes since the first, not to mention several "vanilla" dates and
While Harry had been gaping, Draco had taken the opportunity to get himself back under control. He straightened, brushing off his robes and giving Harry a brisk nod.
Harry had dismissed the offer at the time, but maybe it was exactly what he needed. He had more than enough time off saved up at work, and he and Sue Li had just wrapped up their latest case, so there wasn't anything pressing he was needed for. It was a crazy idea, impulsive and completely unlike him, but Harry had already fixated on the idea, certain it was the perfect solution. He couldn't escape his problems, but maybe they wouldn't be able to find him right away in Italy. He wasn't running, he just needed to hit pause, to take some time for himself. Harry knew he and Draco needed to have a good, long conversation about the kink and the future of their relationship, but before that could happen Harry needed to figure out what he wanted. It wasn't fair to Draco to keep stringing him along, not when Harry wasn't sure he could keep going down the path they'd been travelling on together.
"That's all I ask, Harry," Draco said as he leaned back against the loveseat and crossed one leg over the other. "That, and that you keep talking to me. As long as we keep a healthy line of communication, we can work anything out."
Draco leaned over and brushed a kiss against Harry's cheek before passing over the sections of the paper he'd already read through. They'd been dating for over a year and had moved in together less than a month ago. It was long enough to develop lazy weekend morning routines together, but not so long that the routines didn't still fill Harry with a little thrill. For as long as Harry could remember, all Harry had wanted was a partner to share his life with, somebody who he could lean on and who could lean on him, somebody to be by his side through highs and lows and the exquisite mundanity in between. He'd never have thought he'd find that partner in Draco Malfoy, but life was funny like that sometimes.
"But?" Harry could tell there was something Draco was leaving unsaid and he'd rather just have it out already.
Harry obeyed without question, suddenly realising as Draco spoke how incredibly thirsty he was. He took a massive gulp before Draco chided him to take smaller sips. Something about the gentle yet commanding tone of Draco's voice was irresistible, and Harry followed his instruction, taking tiny drinks until the glass was entirely drained. As he sipped, clarity slowly began to return to him, a veil slipping from his mind that he hadn't even fully known was there.
Draco moaned and seemed to lose himself for several moments, undulating his hips as his fingers carded through Harry's hair.
No, really, he wasn't. He was… processing. Just like Draco said he should. And if he spent all day Saturday
It didn't take long before Draco was doing the same to him, undoing Harry's jeans and fishing out Harry's dick. He took hold of Harry with a firm, confident grip that made Harry shiver and fumble as he pawed at Draco's trousers, pleasure making him clumsy. But he was determined not to be shown up, so he grit his teeth against the desire to melt back against the door and let Draco have his way with him, and plunged his hand into Draco's pants, grabbing hold of Draco's hot, hard length. He felt amazing, so thick and silky-smooth, and Harry desperately wanted to get a good look at him, to see if he was as big as he felt. But Harry wasn't willing to give up Draco's lips or the feeling of his body smashed up against Harry's own, so he'd have to save a proper look for another time.
They materialised at the Apparition Point in Chelsea, right at the edge of the wizarding street that ran parallel to King's Road. The sweet smell of pancakes wafted in from the next street, reminding Harry that it was nearly time for lunch. Perhaps he and Draco could grab a bite once they'd finished with their interview. Not like a date, or anything—they were still on the clock after all—but just a nice, platonic luncheon between colleagues. Of course, Harry wouldn't exactly be opposed to another date, if that was on the table, but it hadn't even been twenty-four hours since the last one and Harry didn't want to seem overly keen, especially given that he was still trying to detangle the mess that was his feelings for Draco.
He yawned, the long day catching up to him, and Parvati huffed a gentle laugh. The two were nothing alike, but Draco used to laugh just like that when Harry was exhausted at the end of the day before ushering him off to bed. Godric, what Harry wouldn't give to be home right now in the flat they shared, crawling into bed with him right at that moment.
Well, it was out of his hands now, too late to turn back. He busied himself with cleaning the kitchen, and then with eating the last half a pint of chocolate ice cream straight out of the carton, pacing the lower floor of Grimmauld Place all the while. Draco had always had a way of making Harry feel off-kilter, but this was a whole other level, one Harry was entirely unprepared for. The constant roller-coaster of emotion was beginning to wear, and Harry didn't know how much more he could take before he went mad.
Harry blinked and panted, still in shock. That word had taken Harry completely off guard and there was no disguising his immediate and visceral reaction to it. Humiliation washed away the usual post-orgasm endorphins, leaving Harry off-kilter and mortified. It wasn't as if Draco hadn't clearly been into it as well; he'd been the one to start it, after all. But with Harry still kneeling there in his bright train-covered shirt, the word
Something must have alerted Draco to Harry's presence in the doorway because he looked up, a soft smile dancing across his lips as he met Harry's gaze. His gaze darted down to Harry's hands and his smile brightened.
"Okay," Malfoy said, placing a warm, wand-callused hand against Harry's shoulder and sending tingles down Harry's arm. "I'm going to cast in three, two, one."
When Harry thought of somebody caring and nurturing, Draco wasn't exactly the first—or even the thirtieth—person on the list. Draco was sharp and caustic, with a pointed, acerbic wit, and a barbed exterior that was prone to prick anybody who got too close. Harry would have thought it'd be easier to picture Draco wielding a whip rather than petting and praising, but apparently his subconscious had no issues with the latter. It was disconcerting to say the least, imagining Draco in such a role, but there was something about it that was strangely alluring. Harry had learned long ago to trust his instincts, and they told him now that Draco would be willing and able to give Harry this odd, confusing thing that he was starting to think he might want. That perhaps Draco might even want and need it too, in his own way.
"I do," Harry replied firmly before giving her a smile, showing there were no hard feelings. "But you're right, I should probably go to bed. I'd like to turn in early, but I owe Draco a letter. I'll go to sleep after that."
"It's a Portkey," Harry eventually offered when it became clear Malfoy was beginning to seriously worry about Harry's sanity. "I always keep some on hand to various locations in case of an emergency. This one will get us to Grimmauld Place."
"Harry," Imogen said, her tone wary. "Parvati told me to keep an eye on you… she seemed to think you might do something reckless."
He wasn't so sure about that Daddy bit, though; that seemed to be taking things a bit far. Particularly given his plethora of issues related to the death of just about every person who'd ever been a father figure to him. But Draco had said that kinky relationships came in all different shapes, so maybe he didn't need a
Fathi frowned, though Harry wasn't sure if he was more annoyed at the interruption or the unfortunate news he was about to deliver.
"Yeah, I guess." Harry actually wouldn't mind seeing a bit more of the world; he'd never so much as left Great Britain. But going on holiday alone didn't really strike his fancy, and though the idea of going somewhere with Draco sounded quite nice, he wasn't sure they were ready for a weekend away together. Maybe soon.
Graham smiled at her, a soft, gentle thing that for some strange reason made Harry's chest ache. "Absolutely, princess. But first, we've got to speak with our friends."
"Hi Emily," Draco said kindly as he lowered himself down into a squat. "I'm Draco, and this is my friend, Harry. Do you mind if we sit and ask you some questions?"
"It's a sort of informal or casual gathering in a neutral space, like a park or a café. Basically, it's just a hangout session with like-minded, kinky people minus the leather and bondage gear. It's great for introductions and a low-pressure way to meet people and get involved in the scene without jumping straight into something a bit more intense or explicit."
"Tell him—" She broke off and cleared her throat, looking away and blinking rapidly, as if she'd caught something in her eye. When she turned back to face him there was a bright, brittle smile on her face. "Tell him I say hello, will you?"
"I thought we could watch a Story Spell, but I've also got some different toys to play with, depending on what suits your fancy."
. You're not the first person to find peace in a bit of age regression, and what you, or anybody else, does in private is of no concern to anybody else as long as it isn't hurting someone."

distracting." He tried to sound scolding, but his voice was a little too breathless to come off as anything other than encouraging.
Work taken care of, Harry had spent ten minutes haphazardly throwing clothes and toiletries into a travel bag before sending off the final letter he'd written. He'd been purposefully vague, telling Draco that he was going away for a while to have some space to think, and that he'd be in touch soon. Harry knew Draco would be worried and concerned when he read it, and Harry felt bad about causing him any distress, but he just couldn't bear to face Draco quite yet. So he'd sent off Apocrypha with the letter and then immediately activated Blaise's Portkey; knowing Draco, he'd immediately Apparate to Harry's place the moment he got the letter, which meant Harry wanted to be long gone by then.
"They're not wrong, you know," Blaise said before taking a sip of his ridiculously expensive Japanese whisky. "It's good to take a break every now and then, recharge, see the world."
"Ah, yes, I was wondering if that might come up." Draco seemed to be weighing his words carefully. "There's a lot of helpful information available that can be useful in figuring out what turns you on, but you've also got to remember that every person has their own unique perspective. The wonderful thing about kink is that, much like a relationship, it's entirely up to the people involved to define what it means for them. There's no one right way to do it, though of course there are best practices and guidelines to follow." He gave Harry a somewhat wry smile. "Just because salt-and-pepper Daddies with their young twinks or little girls in pigtails may be the poster children for ageplay doesn't mean that they're the only ones who play; much like everything else in life, you'll often find the reality of kink to be a bit different from the way it's portrayed in the media or on specifically curated websites. I know it'll be difficult, but I'd like you to try not to think about anybody else and their possible judgments, or what you think you should want or do. Right now, this is about me and you and whatever we want to make this. Nobody else."
"Losing access to Lady Foley's inner circle will be a blow," Harry said grimly, reaching the same conclusion that Parvati had; Kelly was likely already dead. Parvati frowned at Harry's somewhat heartless assessment of the situation—yes, it would be tragic for Kelly's friends and family if he'd been murdered, but Harry was neither a friend nor family, and he'd lost enough people in his life to have learned the ability to compartmentalise when he needed to. "I know Byrne has been making the rounds through the underground duelling circuits, trying to get noticed by Foley and her followers, but until then…"
"I just thought, given… I mean I know that your…" Fathi floundered, uncharacteristically at a loss for words. He exchanged a loaded look with Parvati that Harry couldn't interpret. Harry growled.
"Which has been our aim all along, and thus far we've not had an opportunity for it," Parvati said, her eyes narrowing, apparently taking umbrage with some aspect of Fathi's delivery. "I take it something's changed?"
He dipped his head towards Draco, tacitly acknowledging that Draco should indeed be taking point on this interview. Draco nodded before returning his focus to Emily and flashing her a wide smile that made Harry's knees go weak.
"I'm working the attack," Harry said. It wasn't a question. His voice sounded strange, deadly calm when inside he was a chaotic storm of emotion.
One of Malfoy's eyebrows rose as he took in Harry's mussed bedsheets and the pile of laundry on the armchair in the corner. Harry knew he shouldn't have put off cleaning yesterday. He hastily kicked a used pair of pants under the bed, as if that would suddenly make the room appear like less of a disaster.
"I lost track of time," Harry said with a sheepish smile that quickly turned teasing. "Sorry, Daddy."
Draco's smile was tinged with relief. "Yeah? Excellent. I've always found holidays more fun when you've got somebody along to enjoy things with."
Draco snorted. "No, not like that. You'll see soon enough. Just don't react, okay? I told Graham we'd be professionals, so try not be too weirded out about whatever we see. If you need me to, I can take point. I'm probably more familiar with this kind of thing, and I can explain things to you afterwards." Harry bristled at the insinuation, and Draco held up his hands in placation. "Sorry, I know I sound like a prick, but you'll understand in a minute. It'd be better if I had more time to explain, but we should probably get up there sooner rather than later. Trust me, okay?"
Harry scoffed. Nothing against Fathi (well, a little against him, seeing as he had shown the poor judgement of not letting Harry in on the interrogation) but Harry didn't have high hopes. "She won't give us a thing, not willingly."
"There are a couple of people I think you'll really get on with; I should have broached the idea sooner. There's a munch next month, I'll get the details and let you know. Regardless of what we end up deciding, I really do think you should consider it. Even if you don't feel like pursuing kink right now, it can't hurt to speak with some people in the lifestyle other than me and get some other perspectives."
"It's time for dinner. Put your toys away and meet me in the kitchen." Harry opened his mouth to protest, but quickly shut it at Draco's no-nonsense look. "No arguing. You can play some more after dinner."
Draco raised a single eyebrow, an amused smile playing about his lips. Harry swallowed as he pressed his chair back from the desk and licked his lips. Draco's gaze darted down to Harry's mouth, and Harry's hands gripped his armrests in an effort to restrain himself from leaping up and kissing Draco breathless. Fuck, he didn't know how he was going to survive an entire day of this.
Draco's lips pulled into a reluctant frown, but if he knew Harry at all, he'd know that Harry wasn't about to let this one go. He sighed, seeming to come to that very conclusion.
"I'm so sorry, lad," he said, and he sounded it, too, though Harry knew he'd never fully approved of Harry's relationship with
Draco nodded before leaning down and giving Harry a deep, thorough kiss. He slid his fingers through Harry's hair, scratching lightly at his scalp as his tongue slid into Harry's mouth. It was a brilliant kiss and Harry lost himself in it, so he was surprised when Draco finally pulled away and Harry noticed that, at some point during the kiss, Draco had sunk to his knees.
He glanced over at Draco, who nodded. "Of course, Em. They just have a couple of questions, and then you can go back to playing."
Harry's eyes went wide with shock and he made to pull off Draco's cock, his cheeks flaming, but Draco shook his head and clenched his fingers in Harry's hair, stilling him. It was just enough to indicate his preference before he immediately unclenched, letting Harry know he could pull off if he really wanted to, if it made him too uncomfortable. Harry hesitated.
"Why don't you want me working the terrorist attack? It would make the most sense to have me on that team instead of here. You know I'm better at offense than defense."
be a next time. Harry wasn't sure yet if there was more simmering between him and Draco than some serious sexual tension, but he knew it would take more than one night to work it out. There'd be time to explore the possibilities of Harry's unexpected
Harry Summoned a quill and three sheets of parchment, penning a quick message and sending it off with Apocrypha and then sitting down to write the other two while he anxiously waited for a reply.
"Thanks for coming out tonight," Harry told Draco as they made their way into their flat and up the stairs to their bedroom. "I know you've got a full plate right now and you have to be knackered, but it means a lot when you join us."
"Of course not. This is definitely a good stopping point for today. Why don't you change and then meet me in my room? It'll be more comfortable for us to talk there."
Harry's heart was pounding so loud he was sure it was audible as he grabbed a handful of Floo powder and called out for Draco's flat at two-fifty-nine on Saturday. Having already made a good amount of progress on the state of Grimmauld Place with all his recent anxiety-induced cleaning, he'd decided to spend the morning out in the garden, pulling up weeds and trimming the grass and various hedges. It was physical work and helped keep both his mind and body busy. So busy, in fact, that he'd lost track of time and had to scramble to grab a quick shower and change before his date with Draco. He'd worked right through lunch and debated grabbing a banana as a quick snack, but he wasn't feeling all that hungry, his stomach churning with nerves. Harry wasn't keen on possibly throwing up partially digested banana all over Draco's expensive carpet upon going through the Floo, so he figured it best if he skipped it.
Draco flapped his hands dismissively, his breathing speeding up and his hips shifting restlessly beneath Harry's bum, as if he was holding himself back from thrusting. "We can work out pet names later."
next to both of those activities, hoping he wouldn't be somehow disappointing Draco. It was a slightly crushing thought, but Draco had told him to be thorough and honest, and Harry took him at his word. It wouldn't do either of them any good if Harry was anything other than entirely truthful, as difficult as that was already shaping up to be.
The walls around them creaked and groaned ominously as they made it to a stairwell. Harry opened the metal door with a clang and ushered Cara and her brother through before taking the lead once more. The hospital was set onto a hill, so the entrance that Harry had come in through was technically three stories up. Harry already knew there was fighting there and he was hoping that the ground floor entrance might be less occupied—their battle plans had involved several members of the resistance taking that entrance as their primary task, and he had to pray they'd been successful.
"Draco, relax, I didn't tell them! Just because I'm more comfortable with everything doesn't mean I want to shout it out from the rooftops. It's still… private."
"Harry," Draco called out. There was something in his voice—worry and anxiety and self-recrimination—that made Harry's heart clench, but Harry couldn't stay, not even for Draco.
Draco was still dressed in the dark trousers and crisp white button-up he'd been wearing earlier that day, but he'd ditched his shiny oxfords, leaving his feet bare but for a pair of midnight blue socks covered with fluttering white Abraxans which were most

She returned ten minutes later, and Harry tossed her a treat before tearing open the missive attached to her leg. An ornate gold key fell out of the envelope and into his hand as he slid out the accompanying sheet of parchment.
"I did recognise him. It took me a minute, as I wasn't expecting it, but I've… seen him and Emily around before."
Draco wouldn't have included anything on the list that was illegal or immoral, and Harry wasn't stupid; he knew that there wasn't anything wrong with roleplay between consenting adults. But the taboo against incest ran so deep that Harry's mind shied away from the possibility, resolutely ignoring the tiny flicker of curiosity, the spark of interest inside of him that had a perverse kind of attraction to the wicked and forbidden. Draco wasn't

Then again, he knew Draco had made amends with both Luna and Neville, that he was something like friends with them, even. Everybody knew that Harry had become closer with Draco since going through Auror Training together, and the few times Hermione and Ron had crossed Draco's path, they'd all been perfectly civil. Draco had personally apologised to a lot of people after the war, but he'd be the first to acknowledge that nobody owed him their forgiveness. As much as Harry wanted all his friends to care about Draco as much as Harry did (well, maybe not
"Did you want to play some more?" Draco asked. Harry furrowed his brow in thought. He wasn't ready for all this to be over, but the boundless energy of earlier was starting to fade, leaving him somewhat sleepy. Draco gave him a shrewd once-over. "Why don't we cuddle on the sofa for a bit and watch a Story Spell?"
Harry rolled his eyes, but some of the tension began to leach out of his muscles with the return of the familiar banter.
Throughout their meal, Harry was a jumbled, distracted mess. Such a mess, in fact, that it took him until they'd finished eating to realise he wasn't the only one who was preoccupied. The fact that Draco hadn't called Harry out on his distraction should have been Harry's first clue, really. Now that they didn't have the food to divert them, it was clear that there was something weighing on Draco's mind—he barely seemed to notice the unbelievable-looking biscuits currently being showcased on the baking programme. He shifted on the sofa cushions, and his eyes darted to a paper bag that appeared to have been hastily stowed beneath the coffee table. Harry might've suspected condoms and lube, except Draco was a pure-blood wizard and probably had no clue what condoms even were. Besides, the bag was far too long and flat for that, much to Harry's disappointment.
The date had been a long time coming. Auror Training had been rocky at first, given all the history between them. But Draco had been dedicated and hard-working, and though Harry hadn't been all that swayed by his initial apology, seeing him actually strive to be a better person, to learn and grow…
"Hi, come in." Draco opened the door wider and stepped aside to let Harry pass. He brushed a brief kiss against Harry's cheek as he entered that set them both blushing like schoolchildren.
"Essentially, yes. They were in the middle of an ageplay scene. Part of the appeal for the submissive in that kind of relationship is the opportunity to let go of all the responsibility of the adult world and drop into a headspace that's more childlike and carefree. Playing with dolls and dressing up in bows and frilly dresses and knowing that she has a Daddy to care for and protect her helps get Emily into that place. And it sounds like she was in particular need of it after the attack."
"It's just…" Harry sighed, trying to figure out how to put it into words. "I know there's nothing wrong with wanting these kinds of things
"Well I happen to have a villa in Italy. Tuscany, wine country, absolutely gorgeous," Blaise continued blithely. "I'd be happy to let you stay there if you ever get the urge. Just let me know."
Harry got where Draco was coming from, long-distance relationships were difficult enough without the added element of Draco constantly fearing for Harry's life. The two of them signing up together would eliminate the long-distance aspect, but it would add in combined danger for them both. Harry might be able to live with that—it would hardly be the first time he feared for his loved ones' safety—if it weren't for the fact that he knew Draco would be miserable. Draco had committed himself to being a better person and fighting for what was right, but he wasn't the kind of person to put himself in constant danger. He might do well under pressure, but being under continual threat was a different matter entirely. Asking Draco to put himself in a situation where he'd constantly be battling his instincts to do whatever he needed in order to escape the situation wasn't what Harry wanted. He didn't want Draco to survive, he wanted him to thrive.
In the not-even-five-minutes he'd been by the entrance, the integrity of the building seemed to have further disintegrated. Fires popped and crackled everywhere as the walls moaned ominously. He did his best to ignore it as he checked the rooms and made his way further inside. It was difficult to hear anything specific in the din, but eventually sounds began to isolate themselves: shouted spells, jeering taunts, and there, up ahead, the bright flash of spell work.
"Harry," Draco said, his voice kind but firm. "Let's stop stalling. Here, I'll even help wash up." He waved his wand towards the table, sending the dishes and cutlery soaring towards the sink. He settled them gently into the basin before filling it with soapy water. "There, we can have a chat while those soak."
"Exactly," Harry agreed, pressing in closer, pleased that Draco seemed to welcome the post-coital twining of their bodies. Harry loved the feeling of Draco's warm, bare skin against his own, the gentle press of his soft dick against Harry's thigh, the firm swell of his bicep curled around Harry's back. "Definitely best for all involved if you stay right here tonight. We can…" Harry hesitated. "We can get breakfast tomorrow. Maybe talk about… things."
fan and went to a lot of their concerts. Harry remembered how panicked she'd been when they got news of the attack, terrified Padma might have been there, which she thankfully hadn't been.
Draco's smile widened as he gave Harry a slow once-over. "I can think of worse ways to spend the day."
Draco groaned. "Salazar, you're awful. I can't believe they let you loose on the public with such horrible lines."
"Lady Foley's leaving the country." The room gasped, but Fathi held up a hand, forestalling any questions as Byrne continued, "Not permanently, of course. But she's been furious by most countries' refusal to acknowledge her leadership of Ireland as legitimate. Britain and several other countries have been directly aiding our resistance"—he nodded at Harry and Parvati—"and many others have been imposing embargoes and sanctions that aren't doing her or Ireland's economy any favours.  Even her supporters have been grumbling about the price hykes and shortages. She's worried about being able to hold the country and has been scrambling to make allies who'll come to her aid if she needs to make an even stronger show of force to maintain control. Apparently she's arranged to meet with one or more foreign powers—I don't know which ones—but they've required that she come to them."
Instead, Harry's gaze was drawn towards the blond-haired man walking slowly towards him, looking at Harry with that small, secret smile Harry knew by heart, the one he saw in his mind's eye whenever he pictured the man he loved.
"Yeah," Harry breathed, his skin growing warm as Draco trailed his fingers over Harry's body, looking into his eyes with love and heat. "I don't want to lose you either, Draco. I
Harry lost track of how long he played with the action figures. Each of them had been enchanted to perform a variety of tasks on command, and Harry became absorbed in directing their interactions, laughing with delight each time he discovered something new.

wrong or bad about what happened earlier." Harry opened his mouth to interrupt, but Draco quelled him with a severe look. "
Draco cleared his throat, his expression eager and sheepish. "Yes." He gestured towards the classier book with the geometric pattern. "That one's an adult colouring book. Apparently they're all the rage these days. I saw it at Flourish & Blotts earlier this week, and I thought you might enjoy it. It's supposed to be a good way to… de-stress."
Draco's eyes went wide, and Harry didn't miss the distended bulge of his erection tenting his trousers. Still, he hesitated, the noble bastard. "Best practice still dictates no strenuous activity for twenty-four hours post-Healing spell," he said, sounding like he was reciting from memory, which he probably was.

"Yeah, I know," Harry said, though these days he wasn't quite sure he agreed with that sentiment. Quiet just left room for him to think, to miss the people who weren't with him and the life he had before the call of duty brought him hundreds of miles away. "I'm feeling a little frustrated, that’s all. Besides, it makes me nervous when Lady Foley goes quiet. Every time that's happened over the last six months it's been right before something massive and awful, like when she attacked the

What we need to do is capture Lady Foley,
Malfoy scowled and looked down at the chart in his hand. He was clearly in the middle of a busy shift, his blond hair slightly messy and his cheeks rosy as he read over the admittance form he obviously hadn't had a chance to look over before coming in. If he had, then he wouldn't have been so surprised. Then again, if he had, he might have tried to pass off the case to a fellow Healer, which would have been a waste of a perfectly good broken arm/valid excuse to see Malfoy.
Which he should be doing any moment now, if they didn't want to risk losing Foley entirely. Harry tensed, preparing himself to move. If Fathi didn't give the go ahead soon, Harry would take matters into his own hands. He was done waiting.
Harry barely heard a word he said, too captivated by watching Malfoy work. He'd always had a bit of a thing (okay, a
information, and it had quickly become clear that the world of BDSM and kink was even more nuanced and vast than Harry had anticipated. The deluge of possibilities had been a lot to take in, and in some ways he felt even more lost than before. It seemed so messy and complicated and confusing, and a part of him wanted to throw in the towel right then and there. But there was another part, one that had perked up with interest and timid desire as he read through the online diary from the perspective of a "little".
Malfoy sighed. "Why on earth are you so determined to date me? Have you forgotten the fact that we don't actually get on? Childhood rivals? Opposite sides of a war? Hero and villain? Does any of this ring any bells?"
Harry fought back the instinctive urge to argue. He'd always been a man of action, but Draco was right, he didn't always have to be the one putting his life on the line. There were ways to help that didn't involve putting himself in physical danger, that didn't involve him leaving his life and loved ones behind.
"Me neither. I think a part of me didn't really believe we'd catch her tonight. I'm still in shock." She didn't seem shocked, though. She seemed nervous. Worried. She nibbled her lip and took a sip of tea, avoiding Harry's gaze before tentatively venturing, "That duel between you and Foley was looking pretty intense before Fathi and I were able to join you. You looked like you wanted her dead."
five-year-old. The Dursleys certainly hadn't stocked his cupboard under the stairs with any colouring books.
Ever since, he'd made it a point of specially requesting Malfoy whenever he ended up in St Mungo's, and since Malfoy seemed to all but live at the hospital (and since Harry was
"I know," she said with a sigh. "I've been pressing Fathi about it, but you know how he gets. Not one to be proactive, him."
By the time he'd finished undressing, Draco was naked too, and Harry allowed himself a moment to look and admire. By now, Harry had grown familiar with the long lines of Draco's body, the pale skin over sinewy muscle, and the grace and power of his lean form. His cock rose proud and hard from a thatch of golden curls, and Harry's mouth watered from the memory of his taste even as his cheeks grew hot as he recalled what had happened the last time he'd been on his knees for Draco. He met Draco's eyes, which were dark and ravenous.
"I'm ashamed to say it did," Draco said with a sigh as he stripped off his shirt. Harry took a moment to ogle his pale chest, dusted with a smattering of fair hair and bisected with familiar scars. He didn't have long to linger, though, because next Draco was batting away Harry's fingers, which had gone still on Draco's waistband, and undoing his trousers, sliding them off along with his pants and leaving him entirely, gloriously naked.
They'd stationed undercover agents throughout the hospital around the clock and had a number of alarms set in place to notify everybody on the strike team when Foley's followers arrived. And then they waited.
narrow window in which to make our move. And we'd need to be ready and waiting at the exact time and place where Lady Foley plans to take her Portkey."
Harry's heart began to race and he tore his gaze away, not even finishing the Cs. He'd known there was a lot on offer, but it was overwhelming to be confronted with it all at once. Had Draco already curated this particular list to represent the things he was personally interested in? Was Draco really into—Harry scanned the list and gulped—
. His hands shook as he pulled on his jeans and T-shirt, and Harry needed to leave, needed some space. Everything here reminded him of Draco, and Draco was too tied up in these confusing feelings for Harry to possibly separate them and figure out what was happening in his head.
Something crashed across the room, sending a cascade of bright sparks flying up into the air. It was difficult to see through the smog, but it sounded like there might still be people fighting. Harry wasn't sure if he was imaging the flash of coloured spells in the distance or if it was just the light catching strangely on a stray spark of flame.
Draco's smile was sunshine bright. "That makes me very happy. I know it's a vulnerable position you're putting yourself in, and it's an honour that you're willing to share that with me."
"She's agreed to speak with you," Graham said, once again addressing Draco. Harry might have been offended, but it was clear there was something going on here he didn't quite understand. "I'm sure I don't need to remind you that she's in a quite vulnerable state, so I'd ask you to be mindful of the way you phrase your questions. If you need more information, you're welcome to return later."
Harry crept forward as inconspicuously as he could. Six of Foley's followers were duelling it out with three members of the resistance, though Harry couldn't tell who they were through the smoke. They were outnumbered and fighting against a foe who had nothing to lose, a dangerous combination. Harry gave himself just a moment to get a lay of the land and then he jumped into the fray, his anger coalescing into a singular instinct: to destroy.
He broke off, a strange and slightly hesitant expression creasing his face. Harry didn't want to stop sucking, so he made a noise of inquiry around Draco's cock.
"No! I mean, of course there's nothing wrong with it. If you want to tell them you absolutely should, it's just, oh
Mortification made Harry's skin heat and his hands shake as he shrugged out from Draco's embrace and Banished the glass with a burst of wandless magic. He stood, rather abruptly, and flashed Draco a smile that felt tight and uncomfortable as it stretched across his lips.
Draco's hands slid along the insides of Harry's thighs and Harry gasped, his cock twitching as Draco's palms drew nearer. Draco leaned forward, his hot breath ghosted over Harry's flies as he met Harry's gaze, and Harry couldn't help but whimper when Draco smirked up at him.
Harry had already been aware of the existence of kink and BDSM, of course—he wasn't a prude by any means—but he'd never felt the need to learn any more about it, quickly dismissing the practice as not really for him. Giving or receiving pain had never particularly appealed, nor had the idea of heavy bondage or crawling around on his knees while calling somebody
"They're lists of potential kinks. I have the one I've used in the past with partners, with a list of kinks more generally associated with the BDSM community. The second list is a little more specialised to the Daddy/little dynamic we've discussed. I'd like you to go through them both and indicate whether you're interested, not interested, or unsure. Take your time going through it, really think about your responses. There's no right or wrong answer, but it'll hopefully help you narrow down what you think you might like and provide me with an idea of how I can give it to you. Once you've finished filling them out you can owl them to me and, if you'd like, I can start planning an official scene."
Harry gasped, his hips twitching upwards. He liked it when Draco looked at him like that, liked it when he called him baby.
," Harry said emphatically with only the smallest hint of a leer. "Seriously," he continued when Draco's brow remained creased. "I'm all healed, promise. Your wand fixed me right up." He waggled his eyebrows, quite pleased with his double entendre. Draco snorted, seemingly less impressed, though his expression eased somewhat.
"I wasn't telling you because it bothered me," Draco said, his voice lower and rougher than before. He gave a gentle thrust into Harry's mouth, and though Harry's face was still burning, he resumed sucking, looking helplessly up at Draco, desperately turned on and slightly ashamed at the same time.
Draco's head whipped towards him in alarm. "It was too much, wasn't it? Fuck, I thought you were ready to be pushed, but I clearly misread—"
Draco clutched Harry more firmly, one hand in his hair and one tight around his waist as he growled, "Gladly," before the twist of Apparition took hold and they appeared in the middle of the villa's main bedroom where Harry had been staying.
Draco didn't have to tell him twice. Harry lifted his hips off the bed and shucked off his jeans and boxers before he could overthink. Once naked, though, there was no hiding from the fact that, with past partners, this was the point where things often went awry. Biting his lip, he chanced a glance up at Draco who was, as expected, staring open-mouthed at Harry's dick.
"Oh, no," Harry replied breathlessly, bracing himself on Draco's firm chest, feeling the Sectumsempra scars beneath his palms. "Hot stuff's great. You should"—he lifted himself until just the tip of Draco was inside him, then sat back down, hard—"definitely call me that."
"I know. And we will. I… I like you, Draco. A hell of a lot more than I ever thought I would. I'd like to continue getting to know you, but I know there's going to be a point where we can't move forward until we address our past. Just… not tonight. Tonight I want to get our coffees for takeaway and take the long way walking you home."
When a local rescue agency working to help refugees escape the situation in Ireland had reached out to St Mungos, asking for Healer volunteers, Draco had been the first to offer his services. He was already working sixty hour weeks, and Harry didn't get nearly as much time with him as he wanted, but he understood how important it was to Draco that he do this. It was one of the many ways in which he tried to make amends for his past. This opportunity in particular was close to his heart given the similarities between the situation in Ireland and his history with Voldemort.
The moment they entered the sleek and surprisingly modern kitchen, Draco was waving his wand once more, sending various dishes, wine glasses, and cutlery flying through the air with practised ease. It surprised Harry. Not so much that Draco would have such casual mastery of his magic—he'd grown up with it after all—but that he'd have such delicate precision with household charms, which Harry knew from experience were annoyingly finicky. Harry figured the house-elves would have managed all of that for Draco growing up, and that he wouldn't have had occasion to learn them as a child—same as Harry, though obviously for very different reasons. Then again, Draco had been on his own for years, cut off from his family and from most of the wealth and privilege he'd been so accustomed to throughout his childhood. Harry supposed Draco had plenty of reasons to become proficient at household spells since the end of the war, particularly if he wanted to avoid having to wash and clean things the Muggle way.
," Harry said as Draco straightened the lapels of his blazer for the eighteenth time. "It's just Ron and 'Mione, not the bloody Minister."
Malfoy puffed up a little and Harry fought off an amused smile. "Well yes, of course they are," Malfoy replied haughtily. He gave Harry a judgemental look. "It'd be irresponsible of me if they
But he wasn't ready to share Draco with the world, not right now. He knew Blaise was still good friends with Draco and would be one of the least likely people to judge their relationship, but telling Blaise before he'd even told Ron and Hermione didn't sit right with him. He and Draco were still figuring things out, and he should probably have a conversation with Draco to determine what exactly their relationship
Parvati nodded slowly. "Fair enough. I'm just worried about you, that's all. With everything that's happened…" She trailed off and took another sip of tea, then tried again. "I know it's been hard, but I'm proud of you. Draco would be, too."
Fathi's jaw clenched in obvious annoyance and he gave a quick, sharp nod. "Yes. As you all know, Foley Manor is heavily warded. It's all but impenetrable, but those protections work both ways. She won't be able to arrange an International Portkey or Apparate out of the country from behind her wards, and given she doesn't want her absence from Ireland being made public, she won't be going through official Ministry channels, either."
"Okay, great," Harry replied, his cheeks growing inexplicably hot. "In the meantime, we should probably discuss the actual case. You know, the reason why we were there interviewing Emily in the first place?"
"Yeah, I got that from my research. It was a little overwhelming," Harry admitted. "It helped confirm that the colouring thing wasn't an isolated incident, but…" Harry ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. "I couldn't help but notice that we don't… well, we don't really fit the image of any of the couples I saw."
He felt strangely calm as they fought, even as he deflected curses that would turn his bones to knives or explode his heart where he stood. Harry let instinct guide him, while a litany of
are getting out of it!" Draco's eyes widened in evident surprise and Harry barrelled on. "I know you're all kinky and dominant or whatever, but that's not really what we've been doing beyond a bit of manhandling in bed. You said yourself that the whole ageplay thing was never really your scene. And maybe I might want to experiment with some of those other things you're into, but that's definitely not my main interest. I don't want you doing this just to humour me, and what happens if one day you get tired of playing"—
Harry's eyes widened. It was obvious Draco had given this a lot of thought, certainly more than Harry had, even though it felt like Harry'd thought of little else the past few weeks. It was overwhelming, all the possibilities, but that was why he had Draco. Draco, who would take care of everything, who'd figure out what Harry needed and give it to him. He shivered.
"It's all right if you want to leave," he said evenly. "But before you go, we need to discuss what just happened."
, for takeaway and telly, which Harry was trying very hard not to read into, because they were taking things slow and not meant to be shagging on Draco's sofa, even if Harry really, really wanted to (and had worn his best pair of boxers, just in case).
"Hello," he called out. "Is anybody there?" No response, but then again, Harry wouldn't reply either, not without knowing if the person calling out was friend or foe. "I'm with the resistance, I'm trying to make sure everybody gets out of the building safely."
"I've never really gone on holiday with anybody before, so I wouldn't know, but I can't say I've been enjoying myself all that much so far. Though I did have a lot on my mind."
Draco shot him a scathing look. "You possess many talents, Harry, but an eye for style isn't one of them, so you'll forgive me if I don't rely on your discerning judgement when it comes to the appropriateness of my attire."
Parvati's expression grew pained, and she opened her mouth as if to say something before seeming to think better of it. Good. He knew people had plenty of reasons to dislike Draco for his role in the second war with Voldemort, and they had every right to their anger. But the war had ended seven year ago, and he and Harry had been together for several years—plenty of time for his friends to get used to the idea. It wasn't like Parvati to hold a grudge, and she'd seemed to get on with him well enough the few times Harry had brought him to their Auror Department get-togethers, but perhaps being in the midst of this war was stirring up bad memories of the last one she'd been involved in.
they need. Even more than money, what they really need is a shift in ideology. They need people to continue to do the hard and unseen work for years to come so that they don't have another uprising and a bloody repeat of history. Hell, we still need that here." He gestured furiously as he paced, the Dark Mark on his arm standing in sharp relief against his pale skin. "It took less than twenty years for Voldemort to regain power and restart the same fucking war with the same exact principles in the same fucking country! And he was able to do that because we let him! Our culture and society was built on the idea of blood purity and magical power, and people like me and my family were still here and ready to take up the cause the moment Voldemort came back. The people opposed to him the first time around were content with his death, as if he was just one bad egg and with him gone they could go back to the status quo, as if the status quo wasn't what allowed Voldemort to gain power in the first place."
"Don't know what you're talking about, mate," Harry said innocently when it became clear Blaise wasn't giving up without an answer. "Nothing to tell."
Harry was contemplating this very question for the thousandth time, an undrunk glass of Tuscan Chianti sitting in front of him, when a sudden and insistent knock on the door pulled him from his reverie.
Not just because of the word itself, but who he pictured when he thought it. When Harry thought of himself in this hazy, blissful place, relaxed and safe and happy, his caretaker wasn't some nameless, faceless figure. Of course not. It was none other than Draco running those long, strong fingers through Harry's wild hair, telling him how sweet and perfect he was, how good he was being for him.
"Ready?" Draco asked, settling his arm comfortingly around Harry's shoulders. Harry nodded, burrowing more firmly against Draco's chest.
"You always look so lovely on your knees for me," Draco murmured reverently. One of his hands slid out of Harry's hair and he ran the back of his knuckles along Harry's cheekbone. "But you look especially fetching tonight, my sweet boy."
. But Draco wanted Harry to indulge his desires, wanted to help him do it, and already the feelings inside of Harry were too big for words.
Thankfully, that wasn't necessary, because a moment later Fathi's fingers twitched, and suddenly the forest was filled with shouts and the bright flash of spellwork as the resistance attacked.
"Of course not," Harry said miserably. That was part of the problem. "I get it, you're an understanding bloke when it comes to kink—or whatever the hell that just was. But in case
Draco sighed again, pulling the batter off the last of his fish with those long fingers of his. "We frequent some of the same establishments in London. Those that cater to people with more… particular tastes."
"I don't give a damn what you think, Fathi, not in this." His voice was pure steel. "I'm going. You can't stop me. I wouldn't suggest you try."
That was all Harry could take without kissing Draco, so he stopped holding back and pulled him in close. Draco went easily, their mouths slotting together perfectly, the brush of their lips making Harry's insides light up the way it always did. How could Harry have possibly thought he could give this up?
"Okay," Harry said, nuzzling his nose briefly into Draco's soft hair before stepping back and pulling off his shirt. Their discussion had interrupted their preparations for bed, but Harry was ready to be out of his clothes for the day. "I can't promise I won't still feel the urge to go over there, but I
"Never a dull moment with Seamus. But while everybody's distracted…" Harry gulped—that tone of voice never boded well, nor did the insinuating waggle of Blaise's eyebrows as he continued, "If you wanted to tell me more about this mystery person you've been seeing, I'm all ears."
"I'll see you at work, okay?" Harry said, not turning around as he walked out the door. He didn't want to see the emotions on Draco's face that had made him sound so defeated when he'd said Harry's name.
"Ahh, somebody's back I see," Draco said, his voice thick and slow as if he'd been napping. His hand slid down to Harry's arse, pulling him in so that Harry could rub his hardening cock against Draco's hip.
"Semantics," Harry mumbled as he deemed his chips cool enough to consume. "But fine. Are you going to tell me what the bloody hell was going on back there? Because that"—Harry gestured with a particularly lengthy chip in the general direction of Emily's flat—"was not normal. She was acting like a—like a
Robards gave him a hard stare, and Harry did his best to look innocent and unconcerned, though he was fairly certain his red-hot cheeks were giving him away. But Robards just nodded before leaving with a request that Harry let him know once they had their statement. The moment he was out of sight, Harry folded over his desk, resting his forehead against the back of his clasped hands as he tried to get his ridiculous body under control.
was really called, or what might be on offer, or what he even fully wanted. Draco might have had more experience in the world of BDSM, but he'd also admitted that this particular kink was outside his normal purview. They were due for a lengthy conversation, and Harry knew it would be soon, but he didn't want to go into it totally clueless. Harry could rely on Draco to guide him to some extent, but it would be a good idea to look into it himself as well.
"You telling tales on me, mate?" Seamus asked Ron as he made his way back to the table. "Ah, Harry, just the man I wanted to talk to."
"What about you?" Harry finally managed, his gaze catching on the bulge in Draco's trousers. His mouth watered at the thought of getting a good look at Draco's cock, at putting his mouth on him and returning the favour.
. Which. Was fine, really, and Harry supposed it was a better reaction than the first two options. Harry didn't
He tried not to think about it—had been trying not to think about it pretty much every second of every day of the past week, in fact—but then Draco's eyes would flash or he'd make a decisive gesture with his hands and the fantasies would pop right back to the forefront of Harry's mind. He wasn't quite sure how to act around Draco, and was half-terrified Draco would realise exactly what Harry was thinking and run screaming for the hills. Or, maybe he
"Blaise." Of course. Harry knew he and Draco were close, but somehow Harry hadn't considered that Blaise might tell Draco where he'd gone.
"Harry," Draco said, and for some reason the tenderness of his tone made Harry want to cry. "Look at me. Please?"
He took down one of the wizards before he had a chance to know what hit him and then moved on to the next, not holding anything back. Much like his duel with Foley, the spells Harry used weren't strictly sporting, but Harry was past caring about that. These people had attacked a
Harry nodded and wandered back to the guest room where he first changed. Falling asleep and waking up again had seemed to slip him out of the littlespace he'd been in for most of the afternoon, and Harry felt the rest of it fall away as he shucked off the little boy clothes, carefully folding them and placing them on the bed. It was like the burden of adulthood he always carried around had been placed once again on his shoulders, but it seemed somehow lighter than before, or at least more manageable. His session with Draco had refreshed him. He waited for the shame to come, but it was nowhere to be found; he felt too good. Harry wasn't so naïve as to think he'd escaped it entirely, but for now he just let himself enjoy its absence.
That wasn't necessarily a bad thing—it meant there were enough bodies around so as not to alert Foley's followers that the resistance knew their plans, but that didn't make any of them feel any better about it. Harry in particular felt like he was crawling out of his skin knowing that they were using innocent people as bait. All he could think about was what would happen if any of them should die, and how their families would feel if they found out that the resistance had known about the attack and had decided their loved ones' lives were worth the sacrifice. Harry was no stranger to the tough choices one sometimes had to make in war, but it didn't make that bitter pill any easier to swallow.
His blanket dismissal had apparently prevented Harry from ever realising that there was more to kink than the more extreme S&M aspects that pop culture always seemed to focus on; there was a softer, gentler side. Harry most emphatically did
"Oh, Harry," Draco breathed, so quietly that Harry almost couldn't hear him. He looked at Harry for another long moment, the intensity of his gaze making Harry flush and squirm before Draco withdrew his wand. He Conjured up a glass and filled it with a muttered
Parvati nodded. "And undisclosed Veritaserum in her tea. Fathi's… not happy about it. Says it feels dishonourable, but—" She shrugged and grimaced. "I was up half the night with him talking about various options, and we both agreed it would likely be the only course of action."
"I love them!" Harry agreed, bounding over to Draco and plopping himself in Draco's lap, snuggling in for a hug. As much as Harry craved touch and affection, he wasn't great at initiating it after a childhood that had taught him it would only be met with rejection. But something about wearing these clothes, about having Draco care for him, stripped away all those barriers. He didn't think twice of physically showing his appreciation for what Draco had given to him, and Draco tugged him close, ruffling a hand through his messy hair.
such a thing as too big, and Harry's dick, unfortunately, seemed to have crossed that loathed threshold.
staring into one another's eyes before Draco seemed to shake himself out of it. He slapped Harry's thigh. "All right, hot stuff, let's get this show on the road."
"Yeah," Harry agreed glumly, absently scraping up bits of marsala-infused cream with his spoon. "We've not been properly briefed or anything, but there's a lot of buzz around the Ministry. It's not anywhere near a point where we can officially do anything or offer any kind of aid, but…"
Harry stared at Draco with wide eyes, shocked by his passion and agitation. They'd talked about the war extensively, had rehashed every moment, brought every ugly truth to light until there wasn't a secret between them. Harry knew how much Draco had changed, how deeply he'd looked inside of himself, how far down he'd reached to pull out the very roots of his prejudice. It wasn't perfect, or complete; it was something he worked at every day, combating the bias he'd been raised with. But Harry hadn't ever heard of him speak like this, of the role the greater wizarding world and society had played in creating the kind of environment that allowed somebody like Voldemort to grow and thrive. Voldemort hadn't existed in a vacuum. In many ways, he was a reflection of the darker underpinnings of wizarding society, an unwelcome mirror that exaggerated and distorted the prejudice that existed in the hearts of all witches and wizards.
"Good. Really good. I was more aware of it this time, of slipping into that headspace. It was…" Harry trailed off, not really sure how to describe it, the feeling of weightlessness, the way his mind seemed to actually regress. He wasn't sure if he'd have been able to cast a proper spell like that; the complexity of even a first-year spell had felt beyond his little mind. It was a somewhat frightening thought, being so vulnerable, but he hadn't felt scared or unsafe at all. Not with Draco there to watch over him.
After they finished eating, and Harry had finished spelling out words with the dregs of his pasta letters, Draco cleaned up the dishes with several quick spells.
"Am I?" Draco asked as Harry took his arm, sounding far too pleased with himself. He leaned in, his breath hot against Harry's ear as he continued in a low murmur, "My
had some time to think things over. This isn't just about me, Draco. It can't be." The thought of Draco going along with it just for Harry's sake was unbearable.
Harry took a deep breath, unable to look away from Draco's magnetic eyes. "I know," he whispered. "That was part of what I was trying to reconcile. Because the thing is, I
feeling surprisingly well-rested; usually naps left him feeling more exhausted than before, but right now he felt invigorated.
"Agreed," Draco said, and his smile was warm and sincere. "Until then." He leaned forward and brushed a soft kiss across Harry's cheek as he opened his front door. "Goodnight, Harry. And sweet dreams."
Draco frowned and looked away, reaching for the bottle of vinegar and dousing his chips with a surprising amount of vigour as he said shortly, "If you really thought that, we wouldn't be here right now."
changed, or if he'd just become a much better actor, but he found himself hoping it was the former. "I'm not asking you to marry me, I just want one date. If it's awful, then we don't have to go on another, and I'll even stop pestering you about it."
suffered enough? Was he doomed to bring death with him wherever he went, leaving a path of devastation in his wake?
Draco looked at him thoughtfully. "Assuming that wasn't some kind of goodbye wank and you're still interested in pursuing a relationship…" He waited for Harry to nod his agreement, a relieved smile crossing Draco's face when he did so. "Great. Well in that case, as I said before, I think we need to have a conversation about the whole"—he waved his hand towards his living room—"thing, but that can wait for another day. I think you need some time to process it first, and to really think about what you want."
Draco winced. "Partially. It's a lot more varied and nuanced than that, though. Plenty of people in the community aren't into whips or blindfolds at all. There are a lot of different kinds of relationships and dynamics that people engage in under the BDSM umbrella. Emily and Graham are one of them."
button he'd like Draco to hit with due haste, so he pulled back from the kiss, dumped entirely too much lube on his fingers, and reached back to slick himself up.
Draco laughed and pressed a warm thigh up against Harry's groin where he was already half-hard. "Oh, it's clear. Though we should probably talk about that, too."
"Okay," Draco said, clearly stunned and trying to process what Harry had said. "All right, I hadn't realised that was something you were worried about. If I've been unclear about how mad I am about you, then I should apologise."
Harry's entire body was vibrating with arousal and anticipation (and not a small amount of anxiety) as he finished the first list and reached for the second, shorter parchment. It was one that Draco had created just for him, with the kinks and activities he thought might be most appropriate for the dynamics Harry had shown an interest in. It was the moment of truth, and Harry found himself holding his breath as he opened up the list and began to scan, his gaze catching and snagging on the various possibilities as he read through.
Harry narrowed his eyes. It wasn't like Fathi to be so accommodating, and after doing everything in his power to keep Harry away from Foley, it didn't make sense why he would suddenly be giving Harry full control over her safety.
"More talking," Draco confirmed. He rubbed his thigh once more against Harry's hardening cock. "But we can make it quick."
Robards's face creased with a subtle grimace. "I'd say you're more than equal to the task on your own, but the higher-ups have been on my arse lately about not sending anybody out alone after what happened with Jenkins." He ran a hand over his face, his brow furrowed as he seemed to mentally flick through the list of available Aurors.
“I won’t.  I hope he gets better soon.  You have your other partner looking out for you in there, right?”
“They were angels.  As always.”  Narcissa smiled at her son.  Sirius snorted, remembering little Harry throwing food at dinner, and earned himself a glare off his older Cousin.  “And Tawly was very understanding.”
“You looked pretty wiped this morning in the Great Hall.”  Again, Draco was surprised.  He knew he paid what was probably too much attention to the scruffy dark-haired boy, but he didn’t for a second think it went two ways.
“I wish I could wait around and try some.”  Tara said.  “But I have to go.  I have a client due in thirty minutes at the office.”
“Because you stood there with your wand pointed at me with me making no move to arm myself and didn’t fire a single spell.  Because I’m the one who’s suggested the place to go.  So it’s clearly not something you’ve got prearranged in the room to kill me or take me away from the castle – especially given that I’m going to be the one to ask the room to create us a space to talk.”
“Don’t say it Potter, you’re drunk.  You should go home to bed before you do or say anything we’d both regret”
“I’m sorry, Love.  I’m so sorry.”  Harry pulled Draco in tighter.  After several long minutes, Draco’s arms moved and wrapped around him in return.  Harry relished in the embrace for several long moment before speaking.
“Go on then.  I’m running late for my arithmancy study session anyway.”  Rose said, then surprised him by pulling him into a tight hug.
In an embarrassingly short amount of time he was vanishing the sticky mess in his trousers away.  He felt a little guilty that it had all been about him, but Lily was snuggled contently into his side and didn’t seem to mind.  It was like she knew that he’d needed the physical release to help clear his head from the pounding of guilt and anxiety that had become his constant companions.
birthday in the future, joking about Azkaban’s lack of a record player.  It was even worse imagining his parents now though.  He’d always imagined them being Remus and Sirius’ age, but they had been in their 30s when he had met them.  His parents had only been 21 when they’d died.  They were only a few years older than he was.  They were the same age as Sirius and Remus, just his brain had aged them alongside their friends.  It was a little shocking to really picture the fact that they had barely been adults when they had died.
“I don’t personally.  I actually do all of my own cooking and cleaning in my house, even if I’m not great at it.  Draco has a dozen looking after their home, as well as the Manor.”
“Merlin, I love this one.” Hermione heard Ginny say from the other side of the room, holding the third in the series in her hand.  “The scene where a troll attacks them in the swimming pool changing rooms is my favourite in the whole series.”
“But what about your friends?  I know you had a whole bunch of them at school.  You were really popular.”  Even as a first year he couldn’t help but see the charisma Edward Tonks had.  He had a large group of friends amongst his year, but never seemed too busy to help struggling younger students.  Justin had never had much interaction with him, however.  His difficulty with people had been even more profound when he was younger. Through his adolescence he had learned ways to seem a little less strange and stop himself from fading completely into the background, but as an eleven-year-old, he had been invisible.
“Not that. I’m asking you not to insult my husband. If you do, I’m going to have to leave.  I could try and explain, but if you can’t see past your prejudices, then there’s no point.”
“Thank you, Draco” Harry said sleepily, and still fully dressed, he curled up and closed his eyes. Draco gently took off Harry’s glasses and placed them on the bedside table, his fingers lingering slightly on Harry’s cheek, then he turned and left the room.
“I guess not.”  Harry said and flicked the lighter into life, lighting his own cigarette before holding it out so Draco could light his.  “Are you okay?”
She didn’t look happy, but eventually responded when Harry’s silence and stance made it clear this was the best offer she was going to get.  “Very well.”
“That term and the next were awful.  The stares I used to get when I started showing made me feel so ashamed.  Madame Pomfrey and Professor Haywood, my head of house, helped.  I studied harder than I’d ever done before, determined to pass my OWLs.  I had decided that I was going to give the baby up.  I’d even picked out a couple that I thought I could give her to.  Then before I was able to make the arrangements, two days after my exams finished, I went into labour.  Madame Pomfrey whisked me away to St Mungo’s and I had Hattie.  I knew even without the arrangements in place I could still give her that couple, but then I took one look at her and knew I couldn’t give her away.  It’s been hard but I’ve managed.  I’ve had to give up a lot but she’s worth it.  The only thing that makes me sad is that my parents still don’t want to meet her.  I don’t know whether I’ve helped or made this harder for you.”
“I know love, but it’s not just going to go away.  You have to make a decision.  Whatever decision you make it’s going to be hard. But that decision has to be yours”
“No they don’t.” Draco sighed eventually.  “It’s bad enough that Blaise and Pansy got to witness us getting that out of control in public.”
Harry arrived at the Burrow late.  His morning with Teddy and Andromeda had been so easy and relaxing he completely lost track of time.  He seemed to be doing that a lot whenever he was meant to be seeing his friends, or the Weasleys.  Harry knew he should probably feel bad about it.  But like with the ever-increasing number of lies, he couldn’t bring himself to care that much. He was rapidly becoming a pretty crap friend.  Ron walked out the front door as he was making his way down the garden path.
Hermione knocked on the door and it opened.  The woman in front of her bore an uncanny resemblance to Bellatrix Lestrange.  She was glad she was seeing her fifteen years down the line, and not immediately following the war.  The subtle changes, of age and time, helped her not react with automatic revulsion and fear.  Like the mad woman who’d tortured and permanently scarred her was stood in front of her.  The obvious annoyance the older woman was displaying, at having Hermione showing up on her doorstep without any notice, wasn’t particularly comforting, however.
“I should have done more.  Should have made different choices.  I… I just wanted you to grow up to be strong.  I’m so sorry.  You can never know how sorry I am.”
“Yup, but I didn’t think that was going to happen anyway.  I was surprised you weren’t already sound asleep when I came back.”
“Sorry.  Didn’t think about it.  Too hot or cold?”  Harry felt a little guilty, but it wasn’t like he had to think about these things living by himself.  He’d never been with someone before where he’d been comfortable enough to end up in a situation where water pressure changes from flushing the loo was a problem.  He found that he liked it.
"I get that it's hard for you, Harry," Draco said, resting his forehead against Harry's and closing his eyes wearily. "We all have different strengths, and I know you'd be happier helping out somewhere where you could see the more tangible and direct benefits of your actions." He pulled back and gave Harry a wry smile. "You've always been a hands-on kind of bloke." Harry gave a weak chuckle, and Draco pulled away, running a hand through his hair and mussing the fine strands, his expression tormented. "I'm the reason why you've not already signed up to fight, and I know it makes me terrible and selfish and probably a massive hypocrite, but I don't think I could bear it, Harry, I really don't." He looked at Harry, his expression pleading, as if begging him for understanding, for forgiveness. "I've tried to convince myself that I could survive it, that
"Fuck!" Harry shouted as Draco bit Harry's nipple. He looked down and Draco raised an eyebrow in question. Harry flushed and nodded, and Draco gave him a cat-who-got-the-cream smile before dragging his teeth over the other nipple.
didn't always understand it—but that didn't make it any less real. If he and Draco both wanted it and it wasn't hurting anybody, then what did it matter what anyone else thought? Nobody else had to know, and if they ever found out, well, Harry could cross that bridge when he came to it. Maybe by then he'd have fully made his peace with his desires, maybe he'd have worked past the internalised shame and guilt that even now still prickled at him, though he knew it shouldn't. That kind of conditioning didn't disappear overnight. He just hoped Draco had the patience to deal with him as he continued working on it.
"Of course you'd be hung like a bloody Hippogriff," Draco continued, his voice low and lips twisted into a smug little smirk that made Harry's dick throb in Draco's hands. "I can't wait to watch this big cock of yours swing while you're bouncing up and down on
“But we don’t hide.  And we need someone to stay here so if someone from the Ministry turns up, they can contact us, and we can get here quickly.”  Cissa and Andromeda had decided to go on holiday in order to avoid the media two days ago and wouldn’t be back for another week.
“Angelina, Hattie has made a bit of a mess.  I think she’s tired.  I’m going to get her cleaned up and then put her down for a nap.  There’s water all over the floor here, as well as the remnants of half eaten fruit.”
“I’m…i…  don’t touch me.”  The last words were spat out.  “I don’t deserve….”  He threw up again as more memories hit.
Draco picked at his food.  There were only a few other people in here at this time.  He barely noticed the tables around him beginning to fill.  It wasn’t until Potter entered the room that he was able to haul himself out of his introspection.  He didn’t know how he knew it, but somehow the second Potter entered, he knew the other boy was there.  Glancing at him, he thought Potter looked almost as bad as he felt.  Dark circles cut deep under his eyes, and he looked like he hadn’t even bothered to get changed out of last night’s robes with the number of crinkles in them.   Classes dragged more than they ever had before that day, and he wasn’t sure how he managed to stay awake through them.  If he’d had history or magic or defence, he definitely wouldn’t have managed it.  Still, come 9pm, rather than crawling into bed as he wanted to, he left the common room to wait for Potter.
Malfoy laughed “My Son seems, nice enough.  Really Potter? Merlin, look at the two of us.  Who would have thought we’d be sat in the ancestral Black family home talking about our children dating in our forties?”
“This drifted way past the official brief months ago.  Really, I should report you in for your unethical behaviour.  What would the ministry say when they hear what their golden boy is doing?”
“Teddy, we told you, none of this is your fault.” Draco tried to reassure the young man.  “Come sit with us and let Andi grab a cup of tea.  Harry and me will get jealous if you give all your attention to your grandma.”
“Not until you talk to me.  We’re all worried.  You’ve ignored letters from all of us.  Molly is going spare.  Ron’s pissed off at you.  This isn’t like you.”
“Thank you, Potter.  Send my love to Draco.  I’m coming over this evening and I expect the good wine.  Please be clothed when I arrive.  However lovely you may find me dressed like this, I don’t want to see your knickers, thank you very much Potter.”
“That sounds like her.  And seems very sensible.  We can rota you into our breakdowns if you need.  As long as at least one of us is holding it together at a time, we’re all good.  Right.”
“I told you, the gates are useless.  I can come out to you, but I can’t bring you in.” Harry thought for a few moments.  Short of hexing Narcissa, which probably wasn’t the
“Well he can allow you to use it.  That is how the family bed works.  You will have the best.  You deserve the best, sister.”
“I just wish...” Harry paused, trying to work out what it was he actually wanted.  “I wish I could talk to Sirius.  I want to hear him explain.  There just isn’t any way now.”
“Let’s go somewhere.  Anywhere.  There’s no way I’m heading straight back through those corridors now.  I wish I never had to look at those corridors again.”
Eventually pulling away Draco spoke.  “Harry, I don’t really know what to say.  I don’t know what Pansy told you, and I’m going to have to strangle the bitch for telling you anything, but I was a complete mess after that fight back in eighth year.  Well I was a mess before the fight, but that’s not really the point here.  Pansy, well she saved my life and I spent months stuck in a hospital, miserable and fantasising that you would come and take me away and rescue me.  It took me a long time to realise that the only way I could really be happy was to learn to live with myself and what I’d done.  I couldn’t rely on someone else to rescue me.  And as much as I loved you back then, more than anything I needed a saviour to rescue me.  The thing is now, however fucked up I am, with my barely controlled anxiety, I know that I can manage most things that are thrown at me.  The only shit I cannot manage is you coming in and out of my life it seems.  These last few months have shown me that magnificently.  I love you and therefore you are the person best placed to hurt me.  You’re a shit communicator and I’m not much better, but Doris has helped me see that.  I love you too, but I don’t know whether that’s enough yet, Harry.”
“No.  I’m not telling you who I’m living with.  There is something I haven’t told you though Ron.  I’ve been putting it off, but… I’m not living with a woman, okay.  I’m living with a man.  Well two men actually.”
Harry snorted and sprayed the mouthful of drink he’d just taken across the table. “I was going to do nothing of the sort.  Although Wood did have a rather nice arse, I just never knew you’d noticed George,” Harry said laughing.  “Maybe we should rank the arses of all of the quidditch players from our school days.  Ron, however lovely your posterior may be, I don’t think you’re quite up to Wood’s level.  You though George…”
“I made it on time, and in heels.  No running for me.  It’s your own fault you left late.” Pansy eyed him suspiciously then. “Or is it?  Did you find some nice guy at a party to spend your evening with?  Some beautiful boy who couldn’t bear you to leave his bed?”
“Not really.  But the two of us managed to get ourselves into this mess.  And now I’m finally accepting help off other people rather than just hiding from it, I’m sure we’ll manage to get through.”
Scorpius didn’t sleep that night.  He’d taken Lily to the hospital wing, then just wondered around the castle.  His legs and feet started to ache, but he ignored it.  The physical pain was nothing compared to what he was feeling inside.   It was the early hours of the morning before he finally made his way back down to the dungeons. He didn’t really want to go in, but he was cold, and the fire was tempting.  The stone walls of the castle didn’t hold heat well.  Sitting and staring at the flames appealed to him, and he guessed everyone else would be in bed and he could just sit in the common room alone.  Scorpius was wrong, however.  Al was sat under a blanket on one of the sofas.  He looked half a sleep, but started at the sound of the door opening.
“I’d probably want to throttle him, and then wrap him up in a hug ad remind him that he has the two of us.”
For the first time since Harry had worked out how to activate the emergency siege protocol, the gates at Malfoy Manor were used.  The three of them walked out of the grounds and onto the lane where the hearse was waiting.   Blaise and Harry didn’t release his hands for a second.  When they got to the church, he got out.  It was the church his parents had married in.  The one he always expected to get married in before everything had been turned upside down.  He was so grateful for Blaise.  His partner, lover, boyfriend… he didn’t know the right word.  Whatever the word was, Blaise had pulled off the impossible.  A funeral according to his father’s wishes that hadn’t been turned into a media circus – although he had Harry’s cloak in his pocket in case things changed.  And Harry was prepared to apparate him straight to the Manor gates if he needed to get out of here.  For any reason.
“I’m not lying, Padfoot.” Tears were coming thick and fast.  That stupid song from the café was going round and round in his head like the worst ear worm imaginable.   “Please.  I need you to believe me.  If you do what you’re planning you’re going to spend the next 12 years in Azkaban.  You’re going to be accused of betraying mum and dad.  You won’t see me until I’m 13 years old.  We’ll get a few weeks together over the span of two years and then you’ll die.  Please Padfoot.  Siri.  Please.”
Draco had managed to hold off the panic attack until he had arrived back at the Manor.  He’d managed not to splinch himself apparating, though he wasn’t sure how.  He knew what a bad idea it was to apparate after drinking, but he hadn’t cared.  He wasn’t going to have a panic attack in front of all of Harry’s friends, nor Scorpius’s for that matter.  He had too much pride.  The same pride that lead him to going outside and watching the fireworks rather than running home as soon as they’d been caught, and after he’d had to listen as Potter had tried to dismiss what they’d been doing and pretend it hadn’t happened.  He knew he’d waffled something about not wanting secrets and about the good of the children, but all he’d felt was the pain of rejection.  He didn’t know if he could live through Harry rejecting him again.   It had happened too many times.  Each time, instead of getting used to it, the pain seemed to be worse.  He stormed up to his study and immediately called for a house elf to bring him a bottle of the good red and lit another cigarette.  He was such an idiot to have gone in the first place.  He wasn’t sure what had possessed him.  His stupid fucking therapist putting ideas into his head about trying to have a civil relationship with Potter.  She didn’t have a clue about what it was like between them.  The pull the other man had over Draco when they were in the same room.  Somehow, he’d managed to drag himself away from Harry before he’d made a mess of his trousers.  Then he’d caved at the request of one kiss and they’d been caught by one of the Weasley-in-laws.  Of course, fucking Potter had had to go and try and cover it all up.  As if it was nothing.  Again.  Draco was pacing as his mind was whirling.  He wasn’t sure who he blamed more for the whole situation; Potter, for being a coward; Doris, for suggesting he try talking to Potter; or himself, for being an such a monumental fool.  He could feel the self-destructive urges build.  He wanted nothing more than to let them out.  But he’d promised Pansy.  Explaining to her at lunch tomorrow that he’d caved after being good for so long was not high on his list of desirable tasks.  He could imagine the look of pity and disappointment.  He poured himself another glass of wine and fumbled in his case for another cigarette.  Actually, he was pretty sure if he explained what had happened, Pansy may decide to forgo the pity for him and head straight to Potter to eviscerate him.  That wasn’t fair though.  Unleashing a wrathful Pansy on an unexpecting Harry, for something that wasn’t entirely his fault.  The thought of Pansy ranting at Potter, along with the half a bottle of wine, did having the benefit of calming the storm in his mind.  He was starting to feel sleepy and a little dizzy.  He wasn’t exactly sure of how much he’d had to drink at this point.  A fair amount before he made the idiotic decision to join Potter’s New Year’s party, a couple of drinks there, and now the half of bottle of red.  He was going to feel like crap in the morning.  He called for Mipsy, his favourite elf, to take the rest of the wine away and leave a bottle of hangover potion on his bedside table before making his way up to his bedroom, kicking off his shoes, and passing out in the middle of the bed.
“Why are you helping me?  Yesterday was a spur of the moment thing, but you actually waited around for me to come out of detention with everything needed to help today.  And did you say something about an anaesthetic ointment?”
“Take the packet.” She replied as she tossed the half empty packet and cheap disposable lighter she had with her on the table.  Their eyes met then, and she thought she could see a hint of tears at the corners of his.  She watched him close his eyes, swallow and pick up the cigarettes.  He nodded at her once then pulled out a fag.  He was twirling it unlit in his fingers as she walked away.  This wasn’t exactly the meeting she had planned, but she hoped against hope that she’d made enough of an impression on Potter that this time he wouldn’t fuck it up.
“To berate me for being an irresponsible child, and then tell me I’m having occlumency lessons with him on Dumbledore’s orders.”
“How about a biscuit for dessert, Teddy.”  Andromeda says, with very forced cheer.  She could tell there was something wrong, and she didn’t want to alarm the toddler.
“Very well Harry, this was not the outcome I expected.  I would have thought… well that doesn’t matter now.  I will go with your recommendations.  Mr Malfoy’s probation is lifted. I just hope you’re not wrong and we don’t all live to regret it.  Now, will you take this letter to the post room and have it sent off to Mr Malfoy to inform him of the good news.”
“Fine” Harry said, a little breathlessly, between giggles.  “I’ll make sure Cissa and Andi know this isn’t your idea and that it’s me and Pans they should be getting cross at.  I can blame Blaise too if it helps.” And Harry stuck his tongue out at the man.  “We will do this as slowly and you will have absolute veto power over any idea we have about where and who I should be seen with.  Also there will be no talking to journalists.  No comment all the way. Now I think we’ve had enough scheming about me, and we should get back to scheming about our Diagon dance party.”
“No Potter. Don’t say anything.  This was fun while it lasted, but we always had an expiration date.  This thing was never going to work.  The other day just proved that.  You can move on with your life, marry the Weasley girl or whatever.  I’ll marry some pure-blood willing to put up with my reputation because of my gold.  We had, what? Three, four months of fun?”
‘Yes.  I know we’ve never bothered before, but we decided every additional layer of protection was worth it.  Also given it was just meant to be you here, me knowing the secret was enough.  You know how well that particular charm works between the two of us.’
“Did he mention I had to do it whilst he was in the room with his arms around my emotional wreck of a daughter?”
“Earl Grey, please” Harry replied, and the house elf instantly popped out of the room returning less than five minutes later with a tray ladened with an ornate tea pot, a small pot of honey, lemon slices and steaming buttered muffins.
“Don’t call me Tom.  I hate that name.”  As more memories came back, his dislike of the name had returned to hatred.  The very thought of Tom Riddle brought bile up into his throat.
“I know it is.  Let’s go to bed now.”  Harry soothed Draco. Touching his hair and placing soft kisses against his forehead.
“Cousin Draco is sleeping, Teddy Bear.  You want to help me wake him up.”  Harry said softly to the toddler.
“Then we’ll go.  But not just yet.  You and Sirius should be able to get in even if the fideleus is still there.  And if I can’t find the place then we know the charm is still active.”
“How did you two get from feeling awkward about having to shower whilst keeping some kind of contact to leaning against each other naked in a bath.”
“You know better that that Draco” Doris said sounding more concerned than cross.  She sighed before continuing. “Talk me through everything.  You know the drill by now, dear.”
They were halfway to the gate and the pain was almost gone.  He knew he was close.  He just had to go a little farther.  He let go of Blaise, his legs suddenly feeling stronger and began to run.
“I know I did.   And I stand by my decision.  But it didn’t make me feel good that I didn’t want to tell them.  Just like it probably didn’t make them feel great to think they’ve been replaced by you snakes.”
“Do we have any jam?”  Harry stuck his tongue out at Draco.  Glad that conversation was over for the time being.  That Draco had snapped back to being playful so quickly.
“Angelina…” Harry fumbled, trying to find any excuse not to have the conversation he was sure she wanted.
“Well screw that.  I’ll sit on Draco’s lap for the evening if I have to.  I’m not sitting up there.”
“Everything.  I guess I’ll cancel our dinner reservation then, or would you rather I keep it.  You can go with Lee?  That
“Morning Gramna.” Teddy said in an exaggerated whisper.  “Baise says we have to be quiet cos Cake and Harry are sleeping.”
“I was petrified when they noticed me in the park.  I expected…  well I certainly never expected they’d talk to me.  I had no clue who Draco Malfoy was.  I just saw the mark and was terrified.”
Draco smiled in relief. Closer was better than nothing.  Why did Slytherin and Gryffindor had to be so far away from each other?  Distance made everything worse.
"Would you like to change now?" Draco asked gently. "You can meet me out in the living room when you're done."
"I don't have anything in particular picked out to watch. I figured we could see if any of the programmes on the telly looked interesting."
Harry ignored the slight—for one, Malfoy wasn't wrong, and for two, pissing him off right now wouldn't get Harry what he wanted, as delightful as it was to rile him up. Instead, Harry blinked slowly up at Malfoy—not hard, considering he was still feeling a bit faint from blood loss and the blinking took a worrying amount of effort—and gave Malfoy what he hoped was his most pleading and beguiling stare. Malfoy went still and looked at him with wide, shocked eyes, which Harry took to mean he was suitably bewitched—either that, or Harry had missed the mark entirely and Draco was actually wondering if Harry was suffering from gastro-intestinal distress. Not wanting to give Malfoy an opportunity to breathe life into that particularly unsexy possibility, Harry said, "In that case, why don't you take me back to my place and heal me up yourself? I bet you're just as good as whatever Trainee Healer they'll assign to me, and this way we can both avoid the hassle of St Mungo's."
“Harry, there is no need to do anything like that.  Neither of us is ever going to breathe a word to Dumbledore about little Harry.  And Sirius, I trust that Harry wouldn’t put little Harry or little Draco at risk.  Nor would he put the other Draco at risk.  From what he’s saying it will be a few days at least before… Tom…” Remus visibly choked over the name, but Harry was pleased he was at least trying.  “- will be physically capable of even leaving his room.  We can have another discussion about what to do then.  I’ll look more into the ritual and see what exactly we overlooked in the meantime.”
Draco pushed him off, shaking his head. “I know you love me.  You don’t need to kiss me in front of half of London to prove it.”
“I think the first time I got well and truly drunk was on champagne.  It was at one of Blaise’s New Year’s parties.  I was so sick the next morning.  I was only fifteen. Grandma Andi and Aunt Cissa were so mad.”
“I missed you.”  Harry confessed.  Draco reached over and held his hand, not saying anything.  Harry wanted to ask Draco whether he missed him too.  Whether he regretted sending him away.  But he didn’t.  He just sat with his fingers interlinked with the slim, pale, delicate ones and waited.  He wanted to say more, he just didn’t know what.  He didn’t know where to start with this conversation.  Draco broke the increasingly uncomfortable silence.
Selfishly, this was exactly what Draco needed to hear.  That Harry’s old family hadn’t been able to worm their way in.  That Harry hadn’t decided, on seeing them again, that Draco wasn’t actually worth losing the first people he’d called family.  He knew it was just his own insecurities that had told him this might happen.  He knew Harry loved him and wasn’t going to abandon the life they’d built, but there was still a small part of his mind that told him he wasn’t worth the trouble.  Harry coming back and telling him that he was still Draco’s helped push his doubts away again.  “I love you.”
“You’re my friend too, Harry.  It’s all I’ve ever wanted.  Since before I even met you, I wanted to be your friend, but I messed it all up on the train.  I was an arrogant prat.”
“Of course Kingsley.” Harry said, and hoped that the older man didn’t notice that he’d spoken through gritted teeth.
“No…  don’t… help me get up.”  Draco didn’t know why; he just knew he had to go somewhere.  Had to get out of bed.
“I know, but I’m just not ready yet.  Please, please don’t tell anyone.  You’re my best friend.” Lily pleaded.
“We did at first, mostly.  There were a few people who helped us hide in the beginning.  But eventually his friends became my friends. The not telling you wasn’t because I was ashamed of being with a man.  If it had been any other man, I would have just told you.  I wouldn’t have used Ginny to hide behind.  I’m perfectly aware of what I did, and how awful it looks from your perspective.  We couldn’t let you know because of what everyone would say if they found out we were together.  Not just you guys, but the whole world would have been against us.”
“You’re not a Death Eater anymore. Even when you were you were a pretty crap example of one.” Draco snorted at this.  “That’s besides the point.” Harry continued.  “If you don’t try, they won’t ever get to see the real Draco.”
Harry went back to Draco’s side and led down on the bed next to him.  He slipped his arms around the blond-haired man who was currently trapped inside his own bleak thoughts.
“Teddy is 13 and at Hogwarts.  You don’t know horror until you’ve done all of the nappy changes and sleepless nights.” Theo snorted.
Harry had managed to get the key card to work and drag Draco into the room.  Then their mouths were on each other.  Draco’s hands tugged at the familiar shirt the other man was wearing.  He couldn’t believe Harry still had it.  He remembered abandoning it to escape before he broke down that day.  His fingers worked at the buttons.  He needed the material out of the way.  Harry had sensed what he was doing and pulled their mouths apart, shrugging the now undone shirt off his shoulders.  Draco lifted his arms up as Harry lifted the jumper, he was wearing over his shoulders and then made quick work divesting Draco of his shirt too.  The moved back towards the bed.  Harry sat Draco on the edge and then very deliberately knelt between his legs.  Harry’s mouth nipped, licked and teased as he worked off Draco’s trousers and boxers. Draco lifting his hips to help, staring down at this perfect man.  Draco let out a gasp as he felt the warm wetness surround his aching cock.   It didn’t take long before pleasure whited out all thoughts from Draco’s mind.
“Well he is literally part of your family.”  Harry snorted and shoved at Draco playfully.  “I always thought some of his behaviour was because of Azkaban, but it seems he was just odd all along.”
room and hadn’t since the end of the war.  When he had taken over as head of the family after Lucius had been sent to prison, he hadn’t taken over his Father’s office.  He had instead closed off most of the Manor and moved into the wing that had been his mother’s and turned one of the day rooms there into an office.  His mother’s wing had been only part of the house that had been largely untouched by the time the Dark Lord had taken up residence.  It wasn’t until Astoria had moved in and Scorpius was born that he had had the courage to deal with the rest of the Manor.  By that point he had qualified as a Curse Breaker and had been able to rope some of the others from the office into helping him clear the ¾ of his ancestral home that he had been avoiding.  Ridding it of the dark magic that had been lingering there and redecorating and remodelling almost every room.  Even though that part of the Manor was now habitable, and mostly unrecognisable, he still kept his father’s old study locked, with only the house elves going in once a month to clean.
“Fine.  But I’m raiding your potions stash and you’re both taking a pepper up.  Then you’re going to explain everything.”
Draco felt arms pulling him up out of the bed and supporting him to stand.  He managed to start to move his feet.  It didn’t feel like he was controlling them, but he knew they were moving him in the right direction.  With each step he took he felt a little more coherent.  A little less like he was going to pass out again.
“I know.  Will you see him if I get him to agree?  I know he’s happy with joint sessions with me and Draco, but I think he needs something different right now.”
They all made their way up the stairs towards the room.  It felt odd.  Like they were having to forcefully will themselves to go up each step when everything was telling them just to leave the room be.  Whatever was in this room, Harry had put up some serious wards around it.  Ron reached the top of the stairs first and loudly knocked on the door.  There was no response and he couldn’t hear anything from inside.  He tried opening the door, but unsurprisingly it was locked.  They each tried various spells to try and get in, but all of them failed.  Giving up they went downstairs to the living room and sat, unsure as to what to do next.    For something to do Hermione went to the kitchen to make them all a pot of tea. Ron and Ginny were still sat in silence when she returned.
“Okay.  Well I’m sure she’ll come and find me soon enough, so I shall be here waiting for her.  I don’t think there’s much now that will stop her connecting Draco to Harry, but there’s still a possibility.  You should go though.  Let them know that there’s a chance that Hermione Granger is onto them.  They can decide what to do from there.  If we’re lucky when she comes to see me, as I suspect she will, I can convince her that neither of us know anything.  If not, then this is their mess Teddy and it was always going to end this way.  Do not blame yourself for this in the slightest.  You know that your Godfather and Draco were very foolish when they were not much older than you.  This is their burden and not yours.   I promise you, no matter what happens now, everything will be okay.”
“I don’t want to be a father right now.  I want to finish Hogwarts and hang out with my friends.  I’m not ready for that kind of responsibility.  I love her.  But I don’t want to have a child now and have my life be determined by one stupid night where I wasn’t thinking.  When I get have a child, I want it to be because I’m ready. When I have kids, I want it to be because of a decision not a mistake.” His voice small as he confessed this.  He knew his father wouldn’t judge him for it.
“I wasn’t sure whether that was your hunger or mine I was feeling.  I’m assuming yours then.  Did they give me nutrient potions when I was unconscious, Blaise?”
“Very well, Miss Granger.  I trust that you know Harry well enough to know that he couldn’t have applied whatever wards are currently in place back then, although it may be different now. I will get some people on looking at finding out who inherited the property with Gringotts, though I doubt they’ll tell us.  We can also see if they’ll let us know if Harry has any other properties in his name, but again it’s unlikely we will get anything from them.  I’ll also send people to stake out the place, and maybe some curse breakers to look at the wards.  They might also be able to tell us how long the protections have been in place, which should give us some clues.”
“Mipsy, Draco has just had a bit of a shock.  Could you bring us something to drink?  I’m going to take him into the study.”
“It’s a credit card.  Have you signed the back?”  Harry was relieved.  They might actually be able to pay for this.  He didn’t think he could stand disappointing Malfoy over something so stupid as forgetting that they needed money to go shopping.
“I’m tired.”  Draco said, snuggling further into Harry.  “Can any more planning wait until the morning, or do you need to go fill your Gryffindor friends in?”
“I know.  But the resentment is.  Lily and I have spoken about that a lot.  Sometimes we talk about keeping her.”
Potter looked pained at the question, as if it was something he didn’t really want to think about.  Draco was surprised when the other boy actually answered.  “Fairly certain he does.  I’ve been begging not to go back there each summer since first year.  Doesn’t make any difference though.”
"Harry." It was just one word, but it was said in that same commanding voice Draco had used earlier, and before Harry had even realised it he had stopped, his hand stilled where it had been reaching for his robes.
before announcing it to all and sundry. Besides, Harry couldn't help but remember his friends' frosty reception of Blaise when Ginny had first brought him around, and he wasn't even a Marked Death Eater the way Draco was, nor had he been so personally nasty to them back at Hogwarts. Everybody Harry cared about had plenty of reasons to despise Draco Malfoy, and though Harry didn't plan on keeping him a secret forever, he couldn't help but be wary of the inevitable growing pains that would follow the announcement they were together.
He followed Parvati down the back staircase, unsurprised to see that many of the other key players in the resistance were already seated in the formal-dining-room-turned-command-centre. All of the people that lived at the Manor were already there, of course, and several others who lived elsewhere—keeping a lower profile out in public in order to maintain key positions helpful to the resistance—had also turned up.
Far too soon Harry felt his orgasm peaking, the familiar tingling radiating out from his groin as the pleasure inside him reached a fever pitch. He wanted Draco to come first, so he braced himself by Draco's head with one arm and reached down between them with the other, taking Draco's hot, hard cock in hand. His shaft was soaked with precome, providing the perfect amount of slip as Harry gripped him hard and stripped him fast, just the way Draco liked it. Draco let out the familiar little hiccuping gasp he always made before he came and moments later he was spilling all over Harry's fist.
After weeks of effort on the underground duelling circuits, proving his magical strength and making connections, Byrne had finally been invited to join Lady Foley's
Draco's palm ghosted over Harry's side, the one that had been torn open not all that long ago. "Your side, how is it?" Draco brow furrowed as he looked down at the unblemished skin, seeming far more concerned than was warranted. "That was… probably a more vigorous shag than is advisable after a Healing spell."
"You want it?" he teased, and Harry nodded, too turned on to play coy. Draco's smile was pleased as he leaned in, brushing his lips against Harry's ear and whispering, "I want it too," as he began to push inside.
Harry reached for his fish and bit into the no-longer-searing morsel. It was delicious—crisp outside, soft and flaky inside—and he tried to focus on the warm, tasty food instead of the chaotic thoughts bouncing around in his mind. He was completely out of his depth with whatever they'd witnessed today, and he had so many
He didn't spend long taking things slowly or feeling Harry out—just a few gentle thrusts before he set up a deep, hard rhythm that had Harry's hands twisting in Draco's grip. He seemed to sense exactly how Harry wanted it, and Draco committed to delivering with his customary zeal. The pleasure didn't take long to build, growing and growing until it felt like Harry would burst. The fact that his movements were limited, pinned down as he was beneath Draco's body and with Draco's hands wrapped tight around his wrists, only made it all that much hotter. He'd had an occasional errant fantasy involving a bit of light bondage before, but it hadn't ever been an avenue he fully explored. Judging from the way he was reacting from just Draco's hands holding him down, Harry was
Draco seemed relieved. "I thought it might be nice to have something to help get you in the right frame of mind. I'm not all that familiar with children, to be honest, but the Muggle girl at the shop said this would be perfect for a little boy, so I bought it and used magic to make the clothes a bit bigger."
Harry crawled onto the bed, leaning back against the pillows and giving his aching cock a quick stroke as Draco prowled towards the mattress and crawled over him, straddling his thighs. He ran his hands up Harry's stomach and pecs before sliding his fingers though Harry's hair and leaning down for another eager kiss.
Fathi sighed, apparently giving up his brief attempt at tact and going for his usual direct approach instead. "The attack, it's on the local hospital."
It worked, for a little while, but at the end of each day he came back to the large, empty villa, with nothing to occupy himself with other than his thoughts.
In a daze, Harry stepped aside and swung open the door, allowing Draco inside. Draco slid off his traveller's robes in one elegant motion, revealing the more form-fitting clothes beneath. Harry watched him hungrily, taking in the pull of his tailored shirt across his shoulders and the grace of his wrist as he sent his robes sailing towards the hook by the door. For all the mess in Harry's head, one thing he'd never questioned was how badly he wanted Draco, how right it felt being with him. Mere moments spent in his presence had already settled something in Harry's gut, a wash of peacefulness stealing over him, telling him that everything would be all right now that Draco was here.
One of the red clad aurors stepped forward. “Mister Malfoy.  We are here with a warrant to search your property as well as place you under arrest for the kidnapping of one Harry James Potter by use of illegal potions and/or curses.”   They hadn’t even gotten his husbands name right, although that was probably to his advantage, but he decided not to press that particular point, as his solicitors were best placed to deal with that kind of technicality.
Harry thought about it for a few seconds and assessed his discomfort.  “Lavender.  It’s not too bad.  I’d rather a little pain than not being able to think straight.  I’ll have the purple one with dinner.”
“You shouldn’t have stayed up.  I just needed to be alone.  Dumbledore is gone.”  Harry said, by way of explanation.
“This is Draco…”  Harry said and turned to look at Draco, who was stood behind him.  It was then noticed that Draco was doubled over in silent hysterics.
of November was the worst in their lives, as it was the one where he’d been dumped on them, yet his parents had died on the 31
“Maybe you and Gin could plan a holiday away or something, I know she wasn’t around for many of our summer trips, but you should enjoy the chance to spend some time together.  Ron and I have both booked some leave from work to go visit Norway for a week whilst the kids are at school.”
“I’m sorry, love.  I shouldn’t have tried to force you.  We’ll come up with another plan.  Would it help if you made them yourself?  I can get Tara to send the recipe for the adjusted potions.  That way you can see they’re not poison.”
“You’re stronger than you know.  And wondering about it doesn’t matter.  You have me.  That’s what’s important.”
“Hmm… very well.  I will be going to see the judge that issued this farce of a warrant.  As you very well know, legal and magical bindings cannot occur whilst under any kind of love potion or magical coercion.  It is public record that Misters Potter-Malfoy are legally married, in a magical ceremony with multiple witnesses.  A fact that even the papers in Britain are now aware of, although they kept it secret for a long time in order to avoid such ridiculous situations as this, and as such the Ministry should know that they have no due reason to harass my clients in this way.”
“It’s really no problem, you don’t need to do anything.  It isn’t easy but Hattie makes it worthwhile.” Despite what she said, Harry still wished there was something he could do in return.  Then he remembered the conversation they’d had months ago about her desire to go into healing. With everything that had happened since then he’d completely forgotten about it.  He needed to go up to the school again soon to see Lily.  While he was there, he would talk to Madame Pomfrey and McGonagall and see if they had any ideas about how he could help the young woman.
“I’d prefer not.  I’d rather talk to someone I trust.”  Letting someone else into his mess of a head was not appealing.  Particularly if he only felt able to share less than half of the confusions of his life with them.
Draco had snaked his arms around Harry after he’d pinned up the colouring.  Blaise was sat in the study still working and would have to be shown the artwork later.  He’d be especially pleased at how his present went down.
“Sorry about that.  I just…”  Harry didn’t quite know what to say.  He knew the others must all have been worried about him, but his mind had been so preoccupied with Draco and Blaise and the bond, that it hadn’t left much time for thinking about the other people in his life.
“Potter, you’re not going to change my mind.  Please move on.  Tell me about the Weaslette’s latest attempts at flirting with you instead.  That’s at least entertaining.”
“Harry will be right here.  Both of us.  And we have Siri and Moony and Draco to keep us safe.  Now you go with Mummy so she can keep you safe.”
“I’m sorry to hear that.  You would have made an excellent teacher.  I understand though.  It must be tough on your family to have such rubbish printed in the paper, particularly with what you’re all dealing with, with Scorpius and Lily.  I can see what you wouldn’t want to aggravate the gossip and upset them further by being here as a reminder to the other students”
The three of them made their way to the Great Hall.  Harry took his old seat, from where he would be able to see Draco at his usual place.  Being able to see each other helped greatly with the strain of the bond.  Draco walked in less than a minute after he’d sat down, dragging Blaise behind him.  He almost looked like he was going to come straight over to Harry before Blaise whispered in his ear.  Harry smiled at the slight huff Draco gave in response to whatever Blaise said.  Draco was much less able to cope with the pulls and strains of the bond than Harry was, and Harry was infinitely grateful that Draco was the one that got to keep Blaise by his side, however much he would have liked the comfort.  Once Draco was sat down and their eyes met, Harry found eating was much easier.  Paying attention to the conversations around him was a challenge, as all he wanted to do was stare at Draco.
“Now please remember that this doesn’t mean I don’t love you, or your mum.  It doesn’t change who I am, or who you are in the slightest.  I wouldn’t change any part of my life if it meant I didn’t have you or your brothers.”
“Thank you, Harry.  For everything.  You might not have been the best husband in the world, but you are the best friend anyone could ask for.” Ginny said, just before the two of them entered the fire and onto St Mungos.
Draco stared open mouthed at his mother.  This was the last thing he expected from her.  He didn’t expect her to get it. To respect his limitations.
“I thought it tasted better than usual.  He always did like pretentious whiskeys.  Christ, I think the last time I drank something that good, one of Harry’s whiskeys, was the night he disappeared.  Minerva said they were having an argument over the quality of the wine when she tried to get Harry to move to his actual seat.  Can’t believe how he was with her.  And did you really just say they didn’t get straight out of there once the Aurors turned up?”
“You know you need to keep your hat on, Teddy bear.”  Harry says, gently.  “Now how about we go find the play area.  You and your cousin can play then.”
“Tori, go to the floo and contact the solicitors.”  Draco said as calmly as he could manage and then tossed over his phone.  “And text Harry and tell him to get here.  I believe we have some unwanted guests at the gate.”
“It’s okay.  It’s just not something I talk about.”  Then continuing with the confidence that seemed exude from him, Teddy said.  “I like to look Harry and Dray.  They’re my parents, in all of the ways that really matter.  And Andi, but she is actually related to me.  Well Dray is too, but that’s a little more distant, he’s my second cousin or something.  Dray, Andi and Cissa don’t really talk about the Black family much.  I know I’m one of them, but it’s not the same.  This gives me a connection to them.  Supposedly I started doing it when I was really little.  Changing my hair and eyes to match each of them, which ever one was making me laugh the most at the time usually, according to them.”  Teddy’s tone changed from jovial to more introspective and sadder the more he talked about this.  Justin wanted to tell him to stop.  That he didn’t need to know.  Especially if it was painful.  But he couldn’t make himself speak and Teddy carried on talking.  “So there was this one day, I don’t really remember it, but they love to tell the story so much that it feels like I should.  It was my fourth birthday.  We were playing in the pool at their house.  Between the two of them, and Andi and Cissa, I couldn’t have been a more spoilt, and happy child.  I didn’t have a huge amount of control over my abilities then, so I ended up turning half my hair black and curly, and the other half blonde and straight, with my eyes different colours to match each of theirs.  They said they’d never seen anything more ridiculous, but I can tell how happy it made them.  Over the years the eye thing just kind of stuck.  I do what I like with my hair, but Dray likes it when it’s blonde, so that’s what I do most of the time.  I feel like their son, so I make myself look like it.  I know it’s silly.”  Teddy finished, now sounding like he was trying to hold back tears.
“No.  Not yet.”  Harry still sounded unsteady, but he was determined not to let this stop them finding the horcrux today if they could help it.  “Sirius and Remus can start searching the Manor.  How about we search for the shack?  I don’t have any traumatic memories of being there.”
Harry chatted inconsequently to the woman on his right, some witch from the International Confederation of Wizards of import in the Wizangamot, waiting for the proceedings to start. Ginny was on his other side talking to Ron.  Ginny’s hand was on his knee, kneading at his thigh.  The small box in his right pocket was providing a constant, unpleasant pressure.  Burning and nagging at him the whole time he was sat there waiting, just at it had been doing since he’d bought the wretched thing.   Eventually everyone was seated, and McGonagall started the event with a short speech about the importance of cooperation and unity.  It’s tripe.  He knows it’s tripe.  It’s the same bullshit Dumbledore used to give them, that he’d bought so easily back then.  The night on the astronomy tower and Draco lowering his wand flashes through his thoughts.  Dumbledore hadn’t offered Draco sanctuary until the last possible moment, once it was already too late.  Bile rose to his throat as he remembered.  If McGonagall were truly sincere, he would have seen some of his own Slytherin year mates among the crowd, but they were all conspicuously absent.  Green and silver were not welcome at this celebration.  Food appeared in front of them all once the headteacher finished, giving him an excuse to not talk whilst he eats.  He’s dreading what comes next.  His own speech.  His own idea to cement the separation between him and Draco.
Harry's entire body grew warm from the praise, but he was too relaxed and content to feel embarrassed or self-conscious about the implications of Draco's statement. Harry had already admitted to being interested in things a lot more damning than being bossed around in bed.
"You're not the only one that can get in over their head. This experience is just as intense and emotional for me as it is for you, just in a different way. It is important we both have the means to quickly end a scene if it gets out of hand."
