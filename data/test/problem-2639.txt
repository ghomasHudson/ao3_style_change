He felt Draco moving over to one of the side tables and pulling open the drawers, it wasn’t long before he returned, letting a bottle and package fall beside Harry. “I’m going to work you open slowly,” he kissed Harry’s neck, “would you like that?” Harry nodded his head, whining lightly.
His magic, always volatile, had calmed down, curling around the magic he could feel radiating from Draco now. Their eyes were still locked on the other. He knew Draco was happy now, he could feel it, in his bones, in his mind. He was safe here.
The three of them apparated to the Burrow. They were greeted by Molly Weasley, “Harry, my boy,” faintly he heard Sirius growl, “Happy Birthday,” she said, hugging him. She turned to Sirius.
This breaks the silence that had been on most of the others. ‟Oh Harry,” Mrs Weasley says again, pulling him in another hug. ‟How long have you known?”
They went to Gringotts, Ron transformed into a more rugged version, Harry could see the Ron beneath it, but only because he knew how he looked. Harry and Griphook were under the invisibility cloak.
Hermione stepped in, “are you guys talking about the whole noble family thing again?” she asked, “because if you don’t mind telling us all, that would be great.”
Slowly he pushed in, Harry’s hand grabbing the blanket under him, the other pulling Draco in for another kiss. Slowly he pushed in, waiting for Harry to move before moving back out. The pace they set was slow, loving, passionate. No words needed to be used, no filthy words coming out of their mouth, they kissed endlessly. And when they weren’t kissing they were staring into each other's eyes. The pace slowly increased, Draco moving more forcefully, touching Harry’s prostate. Causing said boy to arch his back, letting out a low moan, again and again, and again.
Then he saw Narcissa, faintly he thought about the fact that she was his mother in law, but as quick as the thought came it disappeared. They were in trouble, even though the order had promised to protect Draco’s mother he wasn’t sure how much she would help them. It’s one thing to help a whole other to completely lie in front of a group of people.
‟Well see it at the feast tonight.” Harry says, ‟Your mother is watching the kids, right?”
‟Harry,” she says softly. ‟Is that what I think it is?”
Draco nodded and walked out of the room, following Sirius. It didn’t take long before all the Weasleys and Hermione were there crowding Harry. “how long has this been going on?” Hermione asked.
“Harry, Harry!” Ron’s voice reached Harry in his dreams, waking him from the dream he was having. “Harry, mate, are you okay? You were having a nightmare.”
The sun sank behind the horizon, the moon shining brightly in the sky. There was snow visible when they drove through deserted landscapes. It was late when they arrived at kings cross. Harry and Draco walking over to Molly and Arthur, together with Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Luna. They said goodbye to Neville and Hannah, both off to their respective parents, much like Seamus and Dean.
“Oi, Luna,” he called out, “come with us after dinner, we got a question.”
“Yeah,” he said, smiling more already, “let’s get our coats,” he said, pulling Draco along by his hand.
“Yeah, I think we should go back,” Harry turned to Sirius, “we can use the floo to go to Grimmauld place now, right?”
Ron opens his mouth to say something but he´s interrupted by Hermione, ‟you really think that? You don´t think he´s just using your fame?”
I just wanted to add some fluff, the boys are going through so much, and no one trusts Draco, but he's slowly apologising for his horrid behaviour. He has a long way before Ron and Hermione will forgive him. But at least they will be working together now.
“Draco,” Ron’s warning voice came, “stop it.” Draco just looked up, seeing the fierce look in Ron’s eyes.
He sees Draco pause, looking between Ron and Harry. “Let him stay Weasley. I won’t break your saviour. Maybe he remembers something.”
“We thought something like this might happen,” Moody says, “that’s why there won’t be one Harry, but 7. We will be travelling in pairs. Everyone will be a Harry and another person. That way people can’t suddenly kill you, because they can’t kill Harry.” Harry opens his mouth to disagree. “It is happening Potter, so shut your mouth.” Harry did as he was told.
“God, she’ll be shocked when she finds out we’re also bonded.” He said, “I’ll tell her this weekend, Monday at most,” he promised, more so to himself than to Draco. “I’ll tell them everything, I’m not only going to tell them we are dating, I don’t want to hide it from them anymore. Especially after the fiasco with Ginny.”
“Thank you,” he said, “I know you didn’t have to share it with me,” he paused, “you could’ve just asked me to leave when I had ordered Kreacher to listen to you, but you knew that whatever Regulus did was worth knowing for me.” He looked up at Remus, “I think we are going to take a nap now,” the three nodded, letting the two men go.
Snape seemed to find this explanation enough, “well, either way, you will see the Headmaster after lunch.”
“You are both very powerful. Not everyone could break through a silencing spell with only a scream,” she said. “I understand why Remus wants to see you two duel. It could be very interesting.” She looked at Harry, “I  want to thank you for sharing it with me,” she said to him, “have you ever thought of visiting a mind healer?” She had a feeling she knew the answer.
It’s halfway through November when McGonagall makes an announcement to the school. “This year has been off to a good start,” she looks over at the tables. Every table has been a combination of all the houses, ever since the first time, Hannah sat with the Gryffindors. “The school has grown, people have seen that their house isn’t everything. With Christmas approaching, I would like to make an announcement. This year we will have a yule ball.” There are cheers erupting around the hall, she lifts her hand quieting them. “Though it is not for the Triwizard tournament, I do expect all of you to be on your best behaviour. The ball will be held the Saturday before the term ends.” She sits down, a cacophony of sounds erupting from the hall.
“Better go with him then,” Dean said, “don’t want to make Hermione mad,” he whispered, causing the other two to laugh. Draco stood following him. Draco walked into the room after Harry. After a few days, they realised they didn’t need to give each other permission due to their bond.
“Then hereby you have been granted this right,” Narcissa says, as the sceptre slowly descends and the strings fade into their cores. She pauses placing the sceptre “and you shall henceforth be known as Lord Draco Lucius Malfoy and Lord Harry James Malfoy-Potter.” She smiles brightly, “you may kiss the groom,” she says to Draco.
“Pretty long letter for only saying she was okay with a snake,” he said, looking at the letter.
Harry nodded looking around. He sees Fleur and Bill, sitting next to Fred. Arthur and Percy weren´t there, but Harry hadn´t expected them to be, not really. They´ll hear about it through the family, it´s better than the prophet at least.
Harry kept his eyes closed even though he knew that she was standing in front of him. He didn’t know what he was waiting for really, but he felt like that is what he was supposed to do. It didn’t matter to him really, he knew Ginny would never do something to hurt him, he knew that.
The trio had decided to do some homework when they got back, much to both Harry and Ron’s chagrin, it would be the only way for them to get help from Hermione so they relented. “I have to get something from the room, I’ll meet you two in the library.” With that he ran upstairs, moving fast along the halls, he used some short cuts to find his way to the headmaster’s office. He saw that the stairs were open, and he climbed it fast.
“God,” Draco said, “hadn’t even thought about that. Do you think we’ll make the front page?” he asked laughing. Harry hit him over the head from across the table. Rosmerta walked over them.
When he opened it he saw two rings in the box. The rings were made with two metal bands, silver and gold intertwining each other. On both rings, two stones were present, one red and one green. They took Harry’s breath away. “They’re beautiful,” he said softly, grabbing one, “give me your hand,” Draco obliged smiling. Harry lifted the ring, putting it on Draco’s ring finger.
“I was cancelling it?” he asked, “you two weren’t doing it.”
“Harry,” Hermione said, “I think you should not be here when I tell him. You know, with your mind?”
“I knew which one I used then,” Harry said. Draco agreed.
He nods, “I like it,” he says, “I’ll be helping my own family, and the families bonded into mine.” He sighed, “It’ll be hard work, but most of it is doing paperwork and watching the accounts. I’ll have to visit the continent every once in a while, to check into our greenhouses and all that, but it’s always nice to see them.”
“For me, it's already late,” Draco said, kissing Harry, “I usually wake up at 7, always have, so be happy it's around 8 now.” He rolled them over, laying on top of Harry, “besides, it doesn’t feel like you are against waking up next to me.” Harry only hummed in response, pulling Draco closer to him.
“No, but I don’t know why but I have a feeling they are connected.” Harry said, “I can’t explain why, and how, but I think, they are.” Hermione nodded at that. “But, Harry, finding out more about his lie won''t change the fact that he has not told you anything about his family. Nor will it tell you anything about why he left us these weird artefacts.” Hermione said. “We should focus on the Horcruxes, Harry, it won't help us any to find anything more about Dumbledore.”
“Okay,” Ron said, “I have to admit, that was a bit creepy.” The others looked at him, “the way he just changed from English to Parsletongue.”
Draco pinches his nose cursing George. ‟Papa had a very different childhood, and nothing that happened during our school years will happen.”
“I think we should bring in a curse breaker,” Narcissa said the next day, “they would be equipped to handle any cursed items still present in the manor. I hope the elves destroyed everything, but you can never be sure.” She paused, “especially when part of our belongings are only cursed against people that aren’t of our family.”
“Well, she is from a pure-blood family,” Draco said as if that made everything clear. When he saw the confused look on Harry's face he explained. “They typically do not marry out of love, but out of status. You have high status in our society. I was just wondering why she came over to talk to you.”
“My hognose snake. He’s just about one year old. He’s the cutest little guy you’d ever see.”
‟Actually,” Harry says, ‟we were wondering if there was a store that sold wall paint anywhere close by.”
Draco´s breath hitches, ‟I´ve known that for so long, and I know that you feel like that too. And I´m a coward for not telling them sooner.” He shakes his head, ‟I love you, so much. And I want to spend the rest of my life with you.” He opens the box, ‟will you marry me Draco.”
“I modified my parents’ memories, they think they are Monica and Wendell Wilkins,” Harry saw tears welling up in her eyes, but she went on, “they think their life long ambition was to move to Australia. They have done so now.” She sighed, “they don’t remember having a daughter.”
“In our defence,” Harry said, “everyone was out of the house, and Kingsley hadn’t told anyone he’d be coming to the house. But well, we were on the couch in front of the fireplace he came out off.”
“I’d like to return these,” Harry said, letting them be checked by madam Pince. With her okay, she crossed his name off the list. “Is there any book with a list of names? Preferably Indian names?”
Fleur scowls besides Harry, ‟I wish my pregnancy would take that long,” she says, ‟I´m already done with the morning sickness.”
Next to avoiding the questions of Ron and Hermione, he also had taken up to avoiding Ginny. Anytime he was close to her, she would walk over to Harry, taking his hands in her. He didn’t know how he had given the impression that they were dating, but she had clearly thought they now were. They had only shared on kiss, one horrible, horrible kiss, even worse than the one he and Cho had shared. Still it seemed that Ginny had the impression they were dating.
Another owl flies down, dropping a letter. ‟Our appointment,” Harry tells Draco, ‟It´s next Friday, after class. It´ll be in the infirmary.” Draco nods. Harry turns the letter, ‟and this is my potions list,” he gives it to Draco, ‟at least I only have to take them during lunch and dinner.”
It turned out that a lot of people were there all ready for dinner. When the boys walked in the hall went silent, all eyes focussing on them. Harry, used to this by now, just walked on, ignoring the stares. Draco, less used to it, had some difficulty ignoring the looks. The others weren’t here yet, so Harry sat down, pulling Draco down with him.
“If you’re going to say hot, I’m going to hit you,” Ron said. Draco just laughed.
Saturday, the day of sleeping in, the day of getting to sleep till he woke up all by himself, light shining in the room. Harry woke up with a smile on his face, the night before still on his mind. He hoped he would see Draco today, if only from afar.
With that it seemed like the topic was discussed, and the four men sat in the chairs. Taking time to think what was necessary to be discussed.
“Ron, take Hermione and Griphook, we need to leave.” He ordered.
Pomfrey frowns, ‟have you felt like this before.” Harry nods, telling her the same he told Draco. Her frowns deepen, ‟any other symptoms you´ve noticed?”
Draco started to tell about them excitedly, pointing at the constellations and telling the stories that he learned about them as a child. At first, Harry kept looking at the stars, but in the end, he had moved to lie on his side, staring at Draco while he was talking excitedly. Draco felt the look from Harry, his eyes boring in his head. In the middle of the story he stopped talking, looking into Harry’s eyes he asked, “Why are you staring at me?”
“When you give me permission to use it,” Draco said, “as is the decorum.” She looked slightly perplexed at that. “Honestly, you all know nothing about proper etiquette. And that is with me only using the bare minimum of the etiquette I would use at proper functions.”
“You what?” Harry asked. He knew he had been dying, he knew he got back through some reason. But he hadn’t thought it had been Draco. Nor had he thought he would’ve felt what he felt. “Thank you.” He said, “you once again showed me, that love really is more powerful than any magic.”
The woman nods, ‟yes, there´s a hardware store somewhere around here.” She gives them directions and wishes them Goodluck with their reparations. ‟I´m happy couples like you two can also find their homes safely. I remember when my son still had to hide his love,” she says with a sad smile. She shrugs, ‟anyway. Good luck, I best be off now.”
The weekend was dark, but in the end, the energy overall was better. With everything out of the way, there were no more secrets between them. It did become increasingly apparent that though all of them were between the age of seventeen and nineteen, they were no real teenagers. They all had done some stuff, had some stuff done to them.
“Can you tell him that we need it?” Harry said, “but only mentioned it when he is alone, no one else can know.” Once again he saw the man nod.
“It’s now twelve, so I suggest we all aim to be in the drawing-room five to two.” Draco looked at his mother, commanding them all, and was glad to know that she would be the one that taught him how to be a lord. She had control over the situation, even without needing to raise her voice, or order people around. She suggested she summarized, all in a way that people would do what she expects of them.
Harry was still in shock, both at seeing Dumbledore being killed, even though he knew that would happen and at the fact that they didn’t get to see the real Horcrux was pulled away from Dumbledore’s body. Ginny was the one who pulled him away, she led him over to the hospital wing. Where the rest had gathered.
That night, though he had a great day before, though he was lying with his husband next to him, plagued Harry with the memories of the war. The forest, so close to him, just out of the window, plagued him. It was 3 in the morning when Harry woke up screaming. It wasn’t the first time, but it was bad, very bad. Draco was next to him, holding him, whispering nothings into his ear.  He whispered with the practised ease of someone who has done so many times. He was whispering into his ear that he was alive, that Hermione was alive, that Ron was alive, that so many people were alive. It was over.
It turns out that Seamus and Dean are both awful, they trip over each other feet every single step they take. They are having fun though, and in every lesson, they manage to get a bit further. Ron and Hermione aren’t half bad. Mainly because Hermione knows how to dance, having done enough of it with Victor. Draco is amazing. He and Neville show them how it is done the first lesson, the two boys twirling around the room gracefully. Hannah needs to learn, but with Neville as her lead, she picks up quickly.
When Harry looked at Ron’s bed he saw the box of chocolates Harry had given him. On the inside of the box was a picture of Romilda Vane, and Harry suddenly remembered the conversation Harry had had with Hermione. About how she and some other girls had wanted to give him a love potion.
“Around two years,” Draco said, “he was the one I was doing during the sixth year.”
“It’s my pleasure,” he said, bowing his head slightly. Narcissa had been teaching him some etiquettes. Mainly because now that he was part of her family she thought he should need to know it. Though, she didn’t expect him to actually implement it. It was one of the things Harry liked about her, the way she made him feel like family.
She complimented everyone when she saw the potion. “Well, that will be all for this class today, please bottle a sample of the potion, write your name on it, and I will grade them all.” She said, “homework is researching the potion you made and writing an explanation of how the potion was created.” With that, the bell rang and the group left the classroom.
Lucius doesn´t make a fuss though. He´s civil towards everyone, even to Arthur. He looks towards Harry while he extends his own hand for Arthur to shake. And Harry smiles turning back to his friends. It´s a fun day, and they get a lot of gifts from their friends. Especially from Pansy, stating that as godmother she is supposed to spoil Scorpius.
“Are we really going to do this?” Harry asked, “I really want to do this.” He looked at Draco with determination.
“Yeah,” Draco said, “I know. I won’t hurt him though.” He looked at Harry, “I’d rather die than hurt him.”
It only took one second for Harry to realise something was extremely wrong, Ron collapsed on the floor. “Ron” Harry called out, running to his friend who was convulsing, “Professor do something!” But it seemed Slughorn was nailed to the floor. Harry acted on instinct, he ran to the professor's potion kit, grabbing a bezoar out of it, and stuffed it down Ron’s throat.
“God,” Harry said, “preparing for the wedding is going to be awful,” he paused thinking, “where are we even going to do it?”
Harry spluttered at that answer, he didn’t know what he had expected, but it wasn’t this answer. “They think you’re out here every night shagging some girl?” He didn’t know why he added the girl part, its not like Draco had said that part himself. He kind of hoped that Draco was going to say he was wrong.
“There is so much to be done,” Harry called out. Harry and Draco were back in their own room after a full day of wedding planning for Sirius and Remus. The two of them had chosen their revealing ceremony, having attuned it to Remus’ wolf. The venue had been chosen and the decorations and clothing were done. “How much preparation can there be for one wedding.”
Ginny seemed to start to say something again, but Harry pushed through. “We should not because there is a war brewing, there are too many things that we need to focus on that isn’t a relationship between us. My focus will be on this war because that is what my life is now focused on. There is a man out there, trying to kill me and almost any wix that isn’t a pure-blood.”
Hermione shrugged unsure as well. Ron still half asleep looked up at Harry, looking him up and down. “Cool tattoos and nail polish and you would look like some rock star, or you know, Charlie.” Harry laughed looking at his hands.
.” The snake moved as if he was doing a little dance, causing Harry to laugh. “
“Ginny,” he said, nodding slightly. He waited for a second not sure what to say, in the end, he decided upon asking her a question. “Why does Luna think we are dating?” he asks her.
‟Well, if we have enough warning in advance, we can clear the living room of any wizarding things.” He says with a shrug, ‟it´s not like it´s that different. Just freeze the pictures and clear the magical toys.”
“Just, Malfoy,” he said absentmindedly when he realised how that must have sounded to his friends, he added hastily, “I think he’s up to something.” He willed his eyes to leave the other boys, looking over to Hermione, who was looking at him with disappointment.
“For me, it is the same, though I know Draco’s family, one doesn’t come from France and doesn’t know the Malfoy’s, ‘is family apothecaries are everywhere,” she said smiling at Draco.
Ernie’s hand shot up, “what the difference then? Did you both not use the same ceremony?”
“Yeah,” Draco said, “everything that is under the Potter family name will be added to my families vault. Everything that is just in your name, would stay yours. So, basically your personal vault, and the Weasley investment, since you invested with your personal name. Though, my family vaults would be yours as well then, as we would be one family.” Harry and Draco both smiled at the sentiment.
‟I told them,” Harry says, ‟all of it. That I´m bi, that I´m in love. But most importantly, that it´s you who I´m in love with.” He shakes his head, ‟you were right. They don´t care, they love me no matter who I love. They just care that I´m happy, and that´s what you make me Draco. You make me so incredibly happy.”
“Yes,” Hermione said, “That’s smart,” she handed Harry the pouch. He briefly considered taking out the ring and wearing it, wanting to feel the strength of his and Draco's bond. But, that would draw too much intention to its importance to Harry. They walked away to a clearing.
Draco chuckled, “I think we do both deserve a nice nap,” he said. “Though you gotta stand up because we’re both still in our court clothes and that won’t be very nice after we had a nap,” Harry grumbled something incoherently but he did listen. He removed his clothes only pulling on a t-shirt, the air too cold to sleep solely in his briefs. He looked over to see that Draco had done the same, lying back on the bed so Harry can resume his position.
“Mate,” Ron said, “you are literally one of the most powerful wizards we know, and your Patronus is a stag. Maybe the kind of creature doesn’t say anything about power.” Hermione seemed inclined to agree.
“Draco,” he whispered, “thank merlin. Are you okay?” he asked.
“I wouldn’t know,” Draco said, “it’s not my culture. But at the same time we are bonded,” he looked back out to the street. “We could buy me one, and ask Sirius. He would know, I hope.”
“I never thought of it like that,” Narcissa said, standing next to her son, “that does sound much better than purity will always conquer.” She grabbed the case lifting it from the mantle. “Do you know what this is Harry?” she asked.
,” he said, though he didn’t move from the position he was in.
Narcissa stood in the middle of the platform a small table in front of her. Harry and Draco moved to stand by her sides, Harry on her left, Draco on her right. Remus and Sirius stood in front of them, eyes locked.
It´s a few hours later that their little room is flooded with their friends. Harry laughs when they all coo at Scorpius and congratulate them. But he´s also really glad when Draco pushes them all out again. Scorpius is put in the small crib beside their bed, and Harry makes sure to feed him every three hours.
“Well,” Harry said, “there was a war going on and no one really accepted that Draco was even an actual part of the order. We didn’t want to shake things up too much to tell you guys as well. Sirius and Remus knew.” Harry shrugged, “and we didn’t feel it was necessary.” Bill nodded in understanding. “Also the fact that your wedding was the day after, and that was more important.”
Both men took a breath and looked one another in their eyes. Draco handed him the potion, and both took a sip, before looking into each other's eyes again. Harry nodded, signalling he was ready, “I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, promise to love you, Harry James Potter, forever, in every way I can. I promise to lend you my strength,” He waved his wand, a red string moved from his wand to curl around his hand.
“Let them think what they want,” Harry said, “I’m comfortable and this day was exhausting even though most of what we did was sit on a bench.”
“Not lacking the number of near-death experiences I felt the last month. Plus that one time you were captured and taken to the manor,” Draco joked, his hand moving to rest against Harry’s.
‟I would say lucky you,” Draco says, ‟but I got out of all that. I knew mother was speaking with the Greengrass’s and I suspected Astoria, which would have made it a bit easier to marry her. It´s not like she´d expect a lot.”
“Yeah, she’s the Lady of her own branch though. Technically it’s part of the Blackline, but when her family became the leaders of the country they became their own line, and they distanced themselves from magical England,” he says casually, moving on without letting them think. “So the head of the family, that takes care of all the other family branches. It takes a family up in their family, a lot of times either by adoption or by a marriage bond.”
“What have you been up to? People are saying you’ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something.”
The three were outside, discussing the thing about the Elder Wand when Fleur came up. She told them that Griphook had asked for them. Harry stepped inside first. Before the others could come in Griphook spoke.
“I’d love to tell you about it, Harry,” Sirius said. “I’ll try to tell you whatever I know.” Harry wasn’t sure what to say so he just hugged the man.
None of the others could answer that question. Hermione broke the silence, “well, I have to admit, having someone with intimate knowledge of pure-bloods does help with understanding.” It was the biggest compliment she could have given.
“Next time,” Dean said, voice low, “don’t let him follow you seconds after you fake going to sleep,” he turned around winking, walking into the greenhouse with his back turned to the door. Harry unable to answer, both not knowing what to say and not wanting others to overhear. Instead, he just showed dean his middle finger, the latter boy cackling at that.
‟I´ve been pretty tired, and nauseous. That´s it I think.” The doctor nods.
A sound ringed through the school, “Harry Potter is dead! He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone.”
‟I think it´s me that´s using more,” Harry murmurs, ‟I´m not sleeping so well. And all the energy I have has been going to the exams.”
Ron walked away first, striding purposefully onto the path. Harry couldn´t see it happen, but he knew that the boy had stopped just before the right side of the archway. Blaise would have walked out from the other side at the same time, stopping in front of the archway on the left side. When they both stopped Pansy and Hermione walked up. Just before she walked out Pansy turned around with a smile and a thumbs-up, before gracefully stepping onto the path. Pansy walked over the path, crossing the centre before stopping just a bit before Blaise. Hermione had done the same on the other side.
‟I´ll come when Scorpius is born,” Harry answers with a laugh, ‟if you tell them about it already, they won´t be too shocked either.”
He knew he had to act, but he waited for a moment, when he heard Hermione and Luna walk past the seventh-floor corridor, he knew that they had been warned. They would be patrolling the floors.
“Oh,” McGonagall said her face full of surprise, “I’m sure that can be arranged.” Harry thanked her again standing up. “Harry,” she said, making him turn in the doorway, “for what it’s worth, I think you two are good together.” Her eyes were twinkling like Dumbledore’s did whenever he spoke with Harry.
“How does having a Lord impact someone’s life?” Dean asked, “I mean, you said you give them money if they need it. But is there something else?”
“Hello everyone,” Dumbledore said, “as you all know we have gathered because I have an announcement to make. Most of you will be surprised with the events that have aspired in Hogwarts while the new term had started.” Dumbledore looked Harry in the eyes. “Everyone who has ever spoken to Harry about his school years, will be, as they say, thoroughly surprised.”
“Yes,” he said, “I have witnessed all the crimes of which he denies having been part of.” Amelia signalled him to continue. “For the crime of torturing muggles, I am confident to say that I saw the accused during the World Cup of 1994 torturing the muggles, something which Tom Riddle repeated towards him in 1995 when he had been resurrected.”
“Of course I want to marry you, Harry!” Draco said, “I might have thought that we would have more time together in our next year, but when have our lives ever been normal? I want to be with you, especially now, with how dangerous it is. I get why Fleur and Bill are marrying, as well as Remus and Sirius. To know that the love of your life is still alive, even in these times, to know they are at least not dead, even if they aren’t safe? Who would say no to that?”
“You have a week,” Draco says, “A week to start the conversation, to start telling people you’re bi and in a relationship.”
He opened the book slowly. He hadn’t used it so far. Back when he had gotten it he was too busy for any journaling. He was either plotting to assassinate his headmaster or plotting to kill the darkest wizard the world had seen. His life really was strange.
“Well it does get confusing if you combine explaining the concept of magical family relations and the concept of the family business at the same time,” Neville said. “Not even every noble family has such a business. Though I guess there are big corporations in the muggle world,” Draco nodded. “I never thought how to explain it. It’s just something we know,” he said. Draco nodded again.
“Harry, why are you only back so late?” Hermione demanded as soon as had sat down. “We have an important lesson tomorrow.”
“He’s not even fighting?” she asked outraged, “why?”
Harry nodded his head, it really was for the best, after all, talking about things too much too fast won't help either of them. And Harry could really get on board with Friday day for themselves.
He wasted no time, however, moving at a fast pace. When he added a second finger his head fell on Draco’s shoulder, a loud moan coming out of him. He moved his head slightly, kissing Draco’s neck, and moving up to his mouth, kissing him. When he added a third finger, he scissored his fingers, the angle harder than he had thought, but the look in Draco’s eyes was worth it.
Harry moved his hand before his mouth smothering the small groans of pleasure escaping between his lips the other buried into Draco’s hair. It wasn’t long before he was coming, Draco knowing perfectly well how to get Harry off as quickly as possible. Harry hit the wall with his fist when he came, the sound rattling through the shared bathroom.
‟You´re naming him Scorpius?” Ron asks the next morning, a frown on his face, ‟I thought you wanted James.”
“You can’t have that,” Harry said. “Is there nothing else?” The goblin shook his head.
Draco laughs behind Harry, ‟you know, aunty Pansy met aunty Astoria on the train. They became friends instantly. Now they´re married.”
They arrived at the shrieking shack and listened to Voldemort and Snape talk. They heard Voldemort talk about the wands, about him taking the elder wand from Albus. He told him how the only way for him to master the wand was through killing and explained how the only reason for him to master the wand was by ending Snape's life.
Harry nods, ‟yeah, I think so too.” Harry´s friends give him an exasperated smile when he and Draco stand before them. Neville makes enough room for the two of them to sit, and Harry smiles gratefully. ‟I´m thinking of selling Grimmauld place,” he says, ‟but I wanted to ask Andromeda and your mum first since they lived in the house as well.”
“I think it’s lovely,” Draco said, trying not to laugh, “You realise, Harry, that my mother would love to get anything from you even if it was a ripped piece of paper.”
Draco frowns, he and Harry had both promised to keep this a secret, not ready to break the safe feeling between them. Especially not in the beginning stages of their relationship. Now though, they´ve both been more secure in their feelings.
Harry moved off of Draco, feeling the come dripping out of him. He cast a quick cleaning charm on the both of them. “You know,” Draco said, “if that is what happens every time I get a bit jealous, I think you won't be able to walk after this week.”
“I really have to go, love,” he whispered, “but you can stay here with Sirius and Ron.” He nodded and Harry sat back down, letting the boy go. Harry looked around for Ron and found him talking to Sirius.
‟I should go back,” he says, ‟if he´s already back and I´m gone he might get worried.” He stands, ‟thank you.”
When night came, the three retired to bed. All falling into a restless sleep. The next day wasn’t any better, all three had been looking at what they had gotten from Dumbledore. Ron had been flicking the light on and off continuously, that was till Hermione called for him to stop.
He moved his head forward, licking the head. With that Harry’s head fell back, letting out a low moan. Draco, spurred on by this reaction, wrapped his lips around the head, moving slowly down. He felt Harry fall down from his elbows, one hand reaching for Draco’s head, the other grabbing hold of the blanket he was lying on.
“You don’t have to talk,” Draco said, he thought for a second. “We could go to Sirius’ class, see how it goes. You won’t have to talk, he’ll understand.” Harry looked conflicted. “I’ll tell him it’s a bad day, he’ll understand.” Draco hears soft hissing from the terrarium on his desk. Harry looked from him to Darsh.
Harry turns to Ron and Hermione. “Guys,” he says, and the whole table falls silent, “why didn’t you guys tell me I’m gay?”
“The couple can choose which family to be a part of if they are both of noble descent. Most of the time this was already known, seeing as the marriages were arranged for a good political outcome. And if they aren’t usually the two will become part of the most powerful noble family.”
They heard the floo go off, signalling that Draco was there with dumbledore. Sirius, who was more interested in his godsons reaction was looking at Harry when Draco walked in. He saw the way his eyes lit up, the love in his eyes. He hid it well, but still he knew that this person was important to Harry. If the way people started yelling was any indication, most people in the room didn’t agree with Harry. Sirius looked up and saw Draco Malfoy standing there. Even though he had not really seen the boy before, he knew it was him. The white hair, the aristocratic black features.
“Did you get one from mum?” he asked Harry, who shook his head. “Nope,” he looked through the letters, “though the twins did send me a letter. Though Fred already knew.”
“You know, you could’ve told him, but never mind that. Friday evening, party in this room, a celebration of surviving the first week of the last year of school. Booze, music, all the shindig, every one of the eight years, some seventh, also known as Ginny and Luna, because they too deserve it. You in?” he asked.
“I know he did,” Dumbledore said, “you see, Harry, what he wanted to know most from Slughorn was how the soul would react to being split seven times. Something he could never find in any book. No one has been known to create more than one Horcrux before, as far as I, and I am sure Voldemort, knew.” He paused and looked at Harry. “You see, four years ago I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul,” he said. “You handed it to me, Harry. The diary, a fragment of his soul. But you see I also realised that his Horcrux was not only intended to keep his soul safe but also was intended to be used as a weapon.”
‟You didn´t hide it because you thought I blamed him for Fred did you?” George asks.
He´d really expected to feel weird about feeding Scorpius. It´s not like he really grew breasts, they´re just more pronounced. But it´s not weird at all. It´s not really comfortable, but it´s nice to have Scorpius so close.
‟I know what you mean,” Draco says with a soft laugh, ‟but yeah. I can look through the houses my family owns, but I think something just ours would be better.”
It was empty when they arrived, the silence eerie. Harry was worried for both Remus and Sirius, though he knew they would protect each other, and that they had to protect the wedding guests. They were sitting in the kitchen when Harry felt his scar hurt, pain went through him like a brief electric shock, he felt rage in his.
As promised Draco saw his friends back at Transfiguration. They didn’t mention anything, nor did Draco and they went back to their usual routine. Whenever Hermione and Draco had free time they worked on their proposal together. They thought of what they wanted to say to McGonagall and the muggle studies teacher. They could not work on the curriculum as they didn’t know the muggle studies one, but they did form their questions.
The following weeks move slowly, most of the sixth years have their apparition test to look out for, but both Draco and Harry, who will only be seventeen after the test date, wouldn’t be allowed to take the test with the others. They stayed behind while the group takes their test. Meanwhile, Harry tries everything he knows to get Slughorn alone. He goes to his office and stays behind in every class. However, even when Harry knows the man is there, Slughorn refuses to open the door of his office.
They were both immersed in their book, too much that they didn’t even notice someone walking into the drawing-room. Harry, still with one hand massaging Draco’s skull and both of them reading. Sirius looked fondly at the picture in front of him, reminded of himself and Remus, but also James and Lily at the same time. He softly closed the door, getting ready to make the breakfast he had promised his love.
Lucius smiles, ‟how are you even certain it´s your son?” he asks with a glint.
‟Yeah,” Neville says, ‟I was thinking of it.” He looks towards the head table, ‟Professor Sprout actually told me to also think about it. She told me I could use this project to start my apprenticeship.”
“I won’t do anything Dumbledore doesn’t want me to,” he said, “just trust me.” His friends nodded at that. He looked over at his friends and at Draco, “uh, guys, I kind of need to speak with Draco alone now,” his friends looked at him, “Dumbledore mentioned something that could help him with his mission, but can’t tell you two about that, orders and all.” They just nodded and left. Without waiting to go to the other room they started talking.
Harry shrugged, he hadn’t followed that this year, nor did he follow Care of Magical Creatures now. Remus continued, “You would need a passing grade in both Potion and Herbology, as they can counteract Dark Magic. As the DADA professor, you would be the person who would need to know most of this, though the Herbology professor and Potion professors would help, you should have a basic understanding. And you would of course need an outstanding for you DADA NEWT.”
They were led into a second room in the big house. The room was dark, but there was a bright fireplace, shining an almost warm light.
“We both like the third option the most, because well, we both get what we want, the potter name doesn’t go extinct, and Draco becomes the Lord of the family.” Harry said, “and I would be part of a real family.”
Their friends were lounging in the common room when they entered. Hermione and Ron looked up, “what’d McGonagall want?” Hermione asked.
“Your wand has been lying on the table the whole time since you cast the spell,” Blaise said, “how did you- You did it wandlessly?” Harry nodded, he forgot not everyone can or is used to it. “Right, of course, you can do wandless magic. Only you would be so damn powerful that you can just effortlessly do that.”
Lucius gives him an amused look, and Harry sees that he´s no longer hiding behind the masks. ‟Harry is exactly that,” he says, ‟proud to love and be loved by a Malfoy. Someone who isn´t afraid to stand up against you or me. Someone not easily manipulated.”
“Where do you want to go?” Draco asked. “You needed some supplies?”
“Well, I think that is all we can think of today. We still have the essay about Dementors to finish, so I think I will go back to the dormitories, Ron,” she said looking at the boy in question, “coming?” Ron only nodded, following Hermione out of the Room. Draco and Harry left as well, only to return to their room where they sat on the couch, next to one another.
Lavender had been accosting Harry, asking how Ron was and talking about her feelings for him, it unnerved Harry a bit. Now that Harry was a keeper down for Quidditch McLaggen had decided that he would be the replacement. Harry agreed but soon regretted his decision as the man was the worst person and a worse player even.
“Duh,” Draco said, moving to stand leaning onto Harry, “you are the strongest of the two of us.”
“Jazz?” Harry asked, knowing both that Draco liked it, and that it would be comforting for him. Draco hummed in agreement, pointing his wand at it, letting it start on the Jazz channel. Soft piano music filled the room. “Thanks,” he whispered, eyes still focussed on the floating lights.
It felt like weeks before Harry heard something from Draco, even though it had only been a few days. It was mostly their change in routine, that had made Harry feel like it had been such a long time.
“Really,” Hermione said, “why do we not learn this in school. There is so much about the magic world that is just ignored because people expect us to know it immediately. Half the people in these halls don’t even know how the ministry really works.”
A few days before the party, Hermione asks who she’s going to bring, now that Ron and Lavender are dating. Hermione just tells him she is going with someone she knows Ron will hate. When Harry says he thought they could’ve gone together, she says she should’ve thought about that. She does not say Harry is smart to think of that.
Harry proceeded to ask questions. Kreacher answered them. He told them about the order he had gotten from Regulus, how he had accompanied the Dark Lord to a cave, drank a liquid and had seen the Dark Lord dropping a locket in the basin, filling it up again. How he was dragged down the water by the inferi that had almost killed Harry, but how he was saved by Regulus, telling him to come back. How he had told Regulus what had happened, and how following that Regulus had asked him to bring him back to the place the Dark Lord had gone. How he had ordered Kreacher to switch the lockets, bringing the real one back, leaving Regulus there. How he had tried everything he could to destroy the object.
“You aren’t, Draco,” Harry answered, hugging the boy from behind, “you are brave, and you are good. I believe in you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Look, Harry, tell me what you are going to take, I need to pack it because we are going with you.” Harry opened his mouth but Hermione didn’t let him speak. “We know what we are doing, we have both been preparing.”
‟Ron did say something I thought about,” Harry says, ‟he said something about moving in together.”
“Yeah, it’s true,” Ron said.
Harry nodded, “yes, the poison that was meant for Dumbledore. Turns out that Slughorn is greedy and hadn’t given it to Dumbledore. Luckily I was there, and shoved a Bezoar down his throat.” Draco looked positively sick, “It’s not something you could’ve stopped Draco,” he said, “if Slughorn would have given the drink to Dumbledore everything would be okay, but that didn’t happen. We should be glad that I was there, Slughorn had no idea what to do.”
Harry smiles, ‟yeah, I think that´s nice. But which one first though?”
Narcissa shook her head, “I’ll be staying in France till Harry and Draco’s graduation, so I might use them before then.” Pihu nodded in understanding.
They both nod, she keeps walking and Harry and Draco follow her. At the end of the stairs is a door that had been locked so far, and no one had cared enough to try and open it. McGonagall taps her wand against the wood of the door, and it swings open.
Only after does she broach the subject of his pregnancy. ‟Harry, how are you feeling? I remember I had been exhausted most days.”
Draco shrugs, ‟that just gives us room to grow, doesn´t it?” He smiles, ‟we can buy plants and things we think look nice. Thinks we´ve wanted but never thought fit in our rooms.” He smiles, ‟besides, we have two rooms that will be filled to the brim with toys for Scorpius and Teddy. A guest room, and an office. We don´t need a lot of stuff.”
I'm a sucker for Aro-Ace Charlie so yeah that's him. Als am a sucker for Harry being accepted with eyeliner and nail polish because it's awesome.
He knew he shouldn’t be avoiding Ginny, he should just talk to her. He just didn’t know how he had to explain it to someone and he needed advice, but he could hardly ask Ron. Asking Hermione was out of the question, as she would only use the conversation to find out more about what he has been doing. So it seemed he was doomed to just avoiding Ginny till he found a way to break up with a girl he never even dated.
“Ron and Hermione agreed to talk with you about the things Dumbledore showed me,” he said when they parted again. “They agree that you could help, it’s a step. Not everyone will accept you as I did Draco, I’m sorry.”
Daphne shrugs, ‟when you´re the heir to a major pureblood house it´s to be expected. Especially in this community,” she says circling the table. ‟And I mean it´s not like it matters. Sure, I´ll have to get an heir, but that´s it. If I wanted, I could just take a lover, it´s also pretty normal. And my husband will treat me right, or he will disappear from the face of the earth.”
“What’s that?” Harry asked, moving his plate so Draco could unroll the letter on the table.
The next letter in the envelope had been details of the graduation. Every student's parents had already gotten the date of the graduation, as it was the next day, and it informed them that the school had provided them with the appropriate robes for the occasion. They were to arrive in the great hall around one, as the ceremony would start at one-thirty. They would have the evening to pack and Sunday the train leaving around eleven.
“I called out!” he said, “I told you I only needed an answer to hear both of you were okay,” he squinted, “for as much as I know something could’ve happened and you would both be dying on the floor.” He looked around the room and saw the clothing articles on the floor.
“Same mate,” Ron said, “though with Hermione I don’t think she’d be up to flying to a vacation destination.” They laughed.
Harry moved his hand behind him, grabbing hold of Draco’s hair, pulling him even closer. Draco groaned at that, causing Harry to moan from the feeling and the knowledge that Draco liked it. Harry felt his orgasm rising, his hips moving minutely against the top of the bed, creating light friction. “I’m going to come,” Harry gasped, Draco only doubled his efforts. “Draco,” he moaned, “don’t stop.”
Before he went out he put his head against the door, listening. He heard the voice of Luna and Hermione. It seemed that they had decided to protect the Room. Luckily for him, Draco had thought of that. Out of his bag, he pulled a box of powder, he opened the door and threw Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder out of the room. With the hand of Glory in his hand, he led the group through the darkness. He felt Bellatrix’s hand on his shoulder, using him as a guide, as the rest could not see.
Harry sat down in the nook Draco had just pointed at, getting comfortable while he looked at Draco walking around the room. “I think this would have to go,” he said to Harry, pointing at the materials and workbench. Harry nodded, having no problem with letting it go.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was smiling, and leaned over to give Draco a quick kiss, “It’s great, Draco,” he said, “I love it.” Draco grabbed his hand and pulled him down towards the blanket both sitting down. He opened up the basket and started putting all kinds of foods in front of them. Most of them were sweets, such as treacle tart, which was Harry’s favourite. There were also some more fruity options, Strawberries and things like that. They ate while chatting idly, talking about everything and nothing at the same time. They talked about the Quidditch game tomorrow.
They walked through the forest. Harry knew where he needed to be. He could feel it in his bones. He followed the sound walking through the old trees, walking slowly.
Andromeda smiles, ‟anything else?”
‟Harry,” Draco calls out, ‟are you okay with me staying in Edinburgh that night? I don´t think they´ll believe it if I say I can go home that night. Not when I only get there around five.”
The group was chatting happily throughout the whole trip, all excited to go back to their school one last time. Everyone had bad memories of it now, but their happy memories fiercely overpowered them. Though for Harry it was harder, when he saw the forest he had died in for a second time, he looked away, leaning into Draco. Hermione and Ron looked concerned, even though they never knew what happened there, they still knew something bad had happened in the forest.
“Yes,” he said, “but not only that. Powerful wizards can share their magic, they can give their partner magic when they need it.” He saw Hermione’s eyes grow. “Yeah,” he said, “Draco gave me magic that day, he gave me enough magic to counter a killing curse with a fucking expeliarmus.”
Harry shook his head, as he imagined the answer sceptre would not be correct. “It’s the symbol of our noble family. Do you remember the sword at Sirius and Remus’ wedding?” Harry nodded, “that was the symbol of the Black family. It is used in the ceremony that gives the head of the family the power to be the lord. It is connected to the registry in the ministry, and it can accept or deny someone's claim on the title.” He cocked his head in question, “it has a spell on it, that can see if someone is out to harm the family. It can also see if someone is really allowed to make the claim. Say that Sirius’ brother had been alive, Sirius would never have been allowed to make the claim on the title.”
On the day of the test, Ron had final thought of a way to figure out how to get the memory. Harry would use Felix Felicis, but only if he didn’t find a way to ask Slughorn after his class today. The class was smaller, a big part of them going for the test, only Ernie, Draco and Harry still in the class for the day. They were tasked with making something that would amuse Slughorn. Harry decided to make an Elixer to Induce Euphoria, if he could make Slughorn taste it, he might even be able to ask for the memory. Though, when the lesson was finished, Draco and Ernie left quickly leaving Slughorn and Harry alone. The moment Slughorn realised this, he almost raced out of his own classroom.
Draco shifted awkwardly – he still hadn't got around to formally telling his mother about the break up.  "No," he replied quietly.  "She and I are no longer together."
"Hmm, I suppose," Hermione replied, not sounding terribly convinced.  "Blaise seems nice, don't you think?"
, he watched in satisfaction as it burned.
Overwhelmed by confusion, Harry did as he was bidden. Now, camera in hand, he examined the box. "You bought me a camera," he repeated. "A really good
"Don't forget I've seen your room, Potter. In terms of destruction it was pretty much there already."
going to get upset. There'd been too much of that lately. Thankfully Ron was there and he had other concerns.
"You're still coming on Friday night, aren't you?"
"Hello, Rosie."  Unable to swing her into his arms as usual, Harry had to content himself with patting her head instead.
Draco looked thoughtful for a moment before nodding.  “I’d like that,” he said. “I have to meet mother now, but owl me when you’re free.”
Harry's owl – Hedwig, Draco recalled – was perched on the end of the banister, eyeing him suspiciously.  Draco'd never had much to do with the owl in the past, beyond retrieving the odd letter.  But as they were going to be living in the same house, he felt some kind of effort was necessary.
They didn't see a huge amount of each other, especially with Harry's training schedule which seemed to get more intense with every passing week. But moments like this, quiet, shared meals, with easy conversation, were becoming a bright spot in Harry's otherwise bleak existence.
"Never mind."  Pansy silenced him with a wave of her hand.  "This isn't about us."
"Maybe." A slow smile crossed Malfoy's face. "You don't think it makes me a twelve year old girl, then?"
Potter's answering grin was almost blinding. "Good."  Then, with a hint of impatience, he cupped one hand round the nape of Draco's neck and tugged him back in.
on the bench's surface before seating himself at Harry's side.  "Any luck with the Board of Governors yet?"
"Sounds like a plan to me," Harry agreed.  He pushed his chair back from the table and got to his feet.
Blaise held up his hands in a placating fashion.  "I don't want to argue," he said.  "I'm just saying that if you got yourself a proper bed, then your back probably wouldn't feel like a troll had been tap dancing on it."
could alter his adherence to it.  She shook her head slowly.  "There was a time when
“Think you’ll manage to muster a smile by then?” Ron teased.
"Beef's done," he said, more to himself than anyone else.  Then, oven gloves in place, he removed the joint and set it on the side to rest.
The irritation at being constantly interrupted was plain on Potter's face, yet Granger seemed immune.  Mainly, Draco supposed, because it was an expression she was so used to seeing.
“This one,” Harry said decidedly, and stabbed his fork back into the sponge to emphasise his point.  “You have to taste this; it’s amazing.”
Harry can't tell where Blaise stands on this – he's always been hard to read – but he's got a plan, sort of, and not even Draco's best friend is talking him out of it. "I love him," he says, entirely without planning to, and the shock obviously shows on his face.
"Thank you, Potter." Malfoy said, as Harry turned towards the door, and Harry knew he was talking about more than the food.
"But he's only our age," Harry pressed.  "And it's an arranged marriage by the sounds of it."
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
"Besides," Harry continued, "People who want favours from their friends – huge favours, mind – need to start being nicer to them."
"Just ask him out, Harry.  What's the worst that can happen?"
"Pansy, don't even think about—"
"It's beautiful," Hermione said.  She placed her box on the floor and crossed over to the open-plan kitchen.  "These worktops are exquisite," she added, trailing her hand over the polished surface.
"What about you, Potter?"  Malfoy turned his attention back to Harry.
Pansy gazed absently at her nails.  "Astoria was right.  You really are in a bad mood."
Ron nods his agreement at Hermione's words, but his mouth is far too full of food for speech.  For his part, Harry is just glad of the opportunity to catch up with his friends.  He adores his goddaughter, but since Rose's birth, their time together has been seriously curtailed.
Harry let his eyes drift closed and his head loll back, and surrendered himself to the sensations Draco's mouth was creating.  He was achingly hard by now, and just as he was at the point of begging, of pleading with Draco to just
"I really do love you, you know."  Draco knew his smile betrayed more emotion than he usually cared to display, but this was him and Pansy, and he couldn't have helped it if he'd tried.
Well, in that case, morning, Professor."
"That won't be necessary."
Part of Harry relished the fact he could read the paper without having to wrest it from anyone else first, but the other, more prominent part of him was too busy noticing how big and empty the old house felt now he was on his own once more.
"You keep telling yourself that."  Malfoy turned his attention back to his magazine, but the corners of his lips were still turned upwards in amusement.
"Sirius left it to me. He was my godfather." There was a hint of challenge to Harry's tone, as if daring Malfoy to dispute his rightful ownership.
Harry decidedly ignored her hints – he was already confused enough without going there.  "I haven't made my mind up yet."
He made his way into the living room and was confronted with a rather red-faced Hermione, who appeared to be taking a deep breath in readiness for her next tirade.  At moments like this, Harry understood what Ron had meant when he said that marrying Hermione would be like marrying his own mother.
"Don't make me spit in your food, Potter," Draco replied good-naturedly as he exited the room.  Harry grinned to himself and took a moment to ponder the delight that was Draco Malfoy's arse in pyjamas.
"Maybe you should take some time to think about it, Mr Worthington.  Go home; discuss it with your wife and son.  We want you to feel comfortable with your decision."
That was where it all started, and Harry reserved the right to blame Hermione for everything that followed.
When they finally parted, both panting slightly, it wasn't to go far.  They were separated only by a matter of inches.  Draco looked at Harry through lashes which were thicker and darker than Harry had imagined, and asked "D'you want to get out of here?"  in a breathless voice that stole Harry's own away from him.
Draco chuckled softly.  "Don't you remember, Harry?  You have a bridesmaid dress fitting."
"What about to make your
Harry looked at her in confusion and was relieved to see Ron do the same. Pansy really wasn't making any sense. "Head start? How's that?"
"Pub," Malfoy replies without stopping.  "I don't know about you, but I think that
"But if you ever want me, or those bloody elves, out from underneath your feet, you're going to have to let us get the job done. And if that means putting up with a bit of noise, or remembering you’re a wizard, then that's what you'll have to do. Okay?"
"We need to start getting you ready," Hermione said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
"Oh." Harry wasn't sure why he felt a little flustered by the question, but he did, nonetheless.  In an effort to stall, he took a sip of his drink.
Harry flushed a little at that comment. "I never thought of that," he admitted.
It occurred to Harry that he wouldn't mind doing this again, and he made a mental note to suggest that Blaise brought Malfoy along with him on their next night out.  After all, if he'd managed to become good friends with one ex-Slytherin, why should it be such a surprise that he might possibly do it with another?
reunion."
Beta:
"Nice job, Hermione," Ron crowed.
"Malfoy."  Harry acknowledged him with a nod, then stepped backwards as he realised how close he was standing.  "This is one of the last places I would have expected to see you."
"But I…That's just…" Harry tailed off at the sight of Ginny's amused smirk.  He folded his arms across his chest with a huff.  "I
Harry scowled with more feeling this time. "It had a bed. That's all I really need."
"Ah."  Harry didn't need further explanation – he'd heard enough about Verity's impending nuptials on one of his many visits to the shop.  "Can't be long away now?"
, you idiot.  Anyone with eyes can see that.  All you have to do is stop arsing around and just
Harry's eyes widened in surprise as Molly's expression softened visibly.  "How did you do that?"  he asked in wonder.
"Don't apologise," Draco replied briskly.  "I'd far rather you be honest with me.  It's not good for my professional reputation if I set you up in a house you don't like, is it?"
"No!"  Harry tensed as Malfoy reached out for his hand.  "I like it."
"There's going to be a next time?"  Harry had a feeling they were heading that way, but he wants to make sure.
He arrived home moments later, scarf still wrapped firmly around his neck, and his cheeks flushed from the cold.
Harry's heart sank, and he was just about to bemoan his fate when a waitress wandered over to clear their table.  He decided it probably wasn't the best time to start complaining about magical portraits of dead people that spoke and acted just as unpleasantly as they had when they were alive.
"Do you want your calves to look fat," was all Draco said by way of explanation, before selecting a different outfit and placing it in her hand.  "Try that one."
"How is this my fault?" Ron demanded incredulously.  "You're the one—"
Just as Draco summoned the nerve to grind himself against Harry – the need for release overriding his restraint and good sense – he felt the gentle touch of Harry's other hand sliding under the hem of his jumper.  It was almost innocent, but there was something about the teasing way Harry's fingertips skimmed over his heated flesh that made Draco almost sob with need.
"Only you would insult someone at the same time as trying to seduce them."
"Will do."  Harry nods and then leans on the counter to enjoy Draco walking away.
Blaise passed a note to the barman before turning back to face Harry, lofty expression in place.  "I happen to be very well-versed in matters of gender and sexuality, I'll have you know.  As a man with gay friends, I felt it was only right to educate myself."
"Persuade Father to get rid of that bloody car."
The mention of Potter's name no longer provoked the same reaction from Draco.  It hadn't for some months, not since the four-eyed git had saved his life.  Try as he might, and being Draco he certainly had, he just couldn't think of Potter with the same amount of disdain after that point.  "Don't you think we've got too much ground to make up to be worrying about having fun?" Draco shouldered his bag and looked intently at his friend.
marrying Theo, Ron has...well, whatever it is that's going on between him and Pansy."  She looked briefly at Ron, who nodded contentedly before opening his mouth to speak.  "There's no need for explanations," Hermione added hurriedly, before turning her attention back to Harry.  "That just leaves you," she said quietly.  "And Malfoy.  And the two of you are still dancing around each other like you did in school, and it's driving us all crazy."
Harry didn't say, could well imagine this to be true from both what he'd
"We're friends," Draco replied quickly.
tone she'd learnt from his bloody mother. She smoothed one hand over his shoulder, allowing the fabric to run between finger and thumb. "They bring out your eyes," she said. "Don't they, Potter?"
"Don't mention it," Draco replied, and took the menu offered him by the hovering waiter.
Pansy didn't respond to his ploy, and Draco could practically see the cogs turning in her head.  "There's only one thing ever gets you this worked up," she said finally.  "Blaise tried it on with Potter."
"I went to see Astoria today," Draco interrupted, anticipating Harry's concerns.  "She knows it's over between us.  I told her the truth."
"She feels responsible," Blaise said. "I know you don't think much of him, and with reason too, but Draco's done a lot for Pansy over the years and she feels like she owes him. She
Draco saw the moment her gaze fell on him, how her words dried up and her eyes narrowed slightly.  It was swiftly followed by a dull red flush that crept its way up her neck as she stared unashamedly at Draco's fingers wrapped around Potter's bare wrist.
"Nonsense," Malfoy said briskly. "Look, I was going to leave this until last, but now that you've brought it up, it seems the right time to do it."
” Harry repeated, because he was pretty sure it bore repeating.
"You're a good man, Potter," Malfoy murmured as he rested his head against the back of the sofa.
Harry's arms were warm and strong around Draco's waist, holding him firmly against a broad chest.  Their legs were tangled together, feet brushing teasing strokes along each other's calves.  And then there were Harry's lips, pressing the gentlest of kisses to Draco's neck – to that spot behind his ear that made Draco's entire body turn to jelly.
#18 Kiss
As interesting as all this was, none of it grabbed Harry's attention as much as the sight of Draco's pert arse straddling the banister did.

"I will," Harry agrees. He feels more than a little sick at the prospect – he doesn’t really
with that, Harry, except it's not you.  What about Draco?"
Harry pulled her into a brief hug.  “Have I told you lately how utterly brilliant you are?”
"Off to get some
"Yes, well I spent a year there," Malfoy replied, evidently taking that as Harry's answer.  "So you can imagine how keen I am to go back."
"I'm fine."  Blaise didn't need to speak for Harry to know what he was thinking.  "You try lifting patients all day and then see how your back feels."
Harry sank into a chair and inhaled his coffee like it held the answers to everything.  He couldn't face training today, not when it felt like his brain was trying to hammer its way through his skull.  He said as much, and found Malfoy watching him curiously in reply.  "What?"
."   Pansy laid her hand over Draco's left forearm to illustrate her point.
With a mind to the library's other occupants, and with no desire to be overheard, Draco kept his voice low.  Too low, it seemed, because Potter continued to scratch away at his homework, oblivious to Draco's attention.
“I heard that, Weasley.”  A blond head appeared around the side of a nearby dressing room curtain.  “I can still put you in lace, you know?”
"A Lotus Elise," Lucius clarified.
Harry wondered if Blaise knew, or even if he was involved, because if Ron was to be believed then Slytherins had been into that sort of thing way back in eighth year.  Thoughts of Ron immediately led him to thoughts of Hermione, and he could hear her telling him to stop being so dramatic, that friends had arguments occasionally and it didn't automatically mean they were practising
"Morning, Potter."
The canteen had obviously been modernised since his last visit.  The hideous Formica chairs and tables of his memory had been replaced with more appealing wooden ones.  But the smells took him right back to the bleak days of his father's illness, and Draco made a mental note to eat as little as possible.
"I shall expect biscuits with my tea tomorrow now.  Chocolate ones."
"It's about bollocks," Ron says from somewhere behind Harry, because naturally they were the first to be split up.
“Can’t you give me a hint?” Draco begged.  “You know I hate surprises.”
"Wine?" Draco queried in surprise.
Harry is too far into the bizarre for this to faze him.  "But you said—"
Potter gave a sheepish smile, which really didn't help matters, and inspected his thumb.  "You had a bit of blood there," he said, and his words were swiftly followed by a gentle flush of pink across his cheeks.
Then there was a whoosh of green flames and Harry was left staring open-mouthed at an empty fireplace.
"Yes."  Their prisoner turned to Harry with wild eyes. "I mean…No! They weren't mine. I've never seen them before."
Harry tried his hardest not to look at Pansy's
Harry couldn’t help but smile at their antics.  Despite the fact that they now got along perfectly well, both Ron and Draco still insisted on using each other’s surnames and maintaining a charade of ambivalence.
"You know," Pansy mused.  "I'll say one thing for Muggles, those
Head Girl business.  After all,
"It's your day off."  Both Draco's tone and expression held accusation.
Surprisingly, Hermione flushed at this.  "That wasn't my idea."  She paused and looked at Harry thoughtfully for a moment .  "Do you like him?"
Draco pulled back, reluctantly breaking the kiss, and pulled his top the rest of the way off.  Barely had he dropped it on the floor before Potter was back, lips on his, and gentle hands smoothing over his skin, guiding him backwards towards the bed.
Harry shrugged.  "He's at work."
"It's fine." Malfoy gave another vague wave of his hand and settled his glasses back in place. "I was done anyway."
Harry pauses, drink halfway to his mouth, then gestures it in a kind of salute at his companion.  "So you do," he agrees.  The panic from earlier seems much more distant through the comforting haze of alcohol.  Or rather, it does until Malfoy's next words.
Blaise remained unconvinced.  "That's what we have hangover potions for.  Besides, you're the boss – who's going to complain if you Owl in sick?"
Harry flushed and fidgeted awkwardly with the paper in his hand, but was saved from having to come up with a reply by Draco's call for help.
"I draw." Malfoy didn't expand and turned his attention to fitting the tiebacks in place.
"Apart from your sunburn."  Harry smiled softly and it warmed Draco's heart.
Harry gaped in surprise.  "I thought you'd..."
Hermione narrowed her gaze and even Harry's tired brain could work out he was on borrowed time. "Taste it and find out."
Draco places his cup on the desk's surface but manages to topple a stack of papers in his haste.  "Bugger," he exclaims, crouching down to gather them up.
Draco snorted.  It was most undignified, he knew, but he really couldn’t help it.  "That's something of an understatement, I suspect.  But I was rather hoping I could persuade Pansy to distract him with her
Once he was sure Malfoy was settled on his own two feet, Harry stepped back slightly and nodded.  "George called earlier while you were at St. Mungo's. How bad is it?"  His eyes roved over Malfoy's form looking for any sign of injury.
Harry leant closer and inspected the boxes.  "Stuffing," he replied, pointing to the first one.  "And I believe the other one's bread sauce."
"How are you getting on?"  Ginny opted to ignore her brother and focussed her attention on Harry.  "I hear you've been to see him.  Found your dream home yet?"
"Go!"  Neither Pansy's expression nor her tone brooked any argument, and despite having faced down Voldemort numerous times, Harry couldn't help thinking this was one person he really didn't want to piss off.  Plus, considering that what she was telling him, making him do, was exactly what he'd wanted to do for months, well, it didn't seem so bad.
It was the first time that Harry had referenced their past relationship in a positive light, and Draco was not willing to let the moment pass.  "That was a wonderful holiday, wasn't it?" he asked.
Harry looked up tiredly from his desk to face a raging Pansy Parkinson. "I don't have one," he admitted weakly. Harry had spent the whole weekend alternating between berating himself and trying to see Draco. He'd had very little sleep and didn't have the energy to defend himself against Pansy. Besides, he didn't think that he deserved to.
"Kreacher has baked a ginger cake," the elf continued before Harry could reply.  "It is being Master Malfoy's favourite," he added proudly.
Harry had barely made it into the kitchen before Malfoy was on his feet behind him. "Potter, wait!"
Harry grinned despite himself, visions of his friend's Yule Ball robes came flooding back.
Hermione turned around finally, a small smile on her face.  "Well, it is almost Christmas, so I imagine there'll be Santa hats, too."
"You did, sort of," Neville said.  "Well, you and Malfoy's pensieve."
"In trouble with the boss, Weasley?" Pansy Parkinson perched on the edge of their desk, giving a flash of leg that left Harry unmoved but caused Ron to gulp visibly.
Harry turned an outraged expression from Malfoy to Hermione and back again. "This is
"What?" Ron looked at Harry in confusion, words muted by the mouthful of pie he was currently chewing.
Harry gaped for a moment.  "B-But—"
Harry flushed. He couldn't help it. He was no expert by any means, but he was
“Okay, fine,” Harry answered huffily.  “I’ll do it.  But you two are helping.”  He paused here and glared meaningfully at his two companions.  “And by helping, I don’t mean hovering round the kitchen like a dog begging for scraps, or peering over my shoulder giving a running commentary like you’re the
"Is everything okay?" Ron repeated.  "Between you and...Astoria.  Only you hardly ever mention her anymore."
"You promised."  Draco's voice was quiet, but the fear in it was palpable.  "You gave me your word."
“Like it?  I think it’s bloody brilliant.  It’ll be like the anti-Christmas.  We can do all those things we secretly wanted to, but Mum wouldn’t allow.”  He paused and grinned.  “Heh, we can even watch those naked women channels if we want.”
that you liked her."
#12 Snow-covered graveyard
"Drake?" Draco fairly spat the word.
"I've never been to a Muggle restaurant before," Draco admitted. "Not much of a surprise considering my family, I'm sure."
Harry snorted at this, drawing a glare from his best friend.  “Where are they off to?” he asked hurriedly to deflect attention.
“Of course he will,” Draco answered before Harry could speak.  “This’ll be the perfect opportunity to crack open that Nigella cookbook that you’ve been practically sleeping with recently.”
"So, what do you think then?"
"Well," Harry said finally with a shaky laugh.  "That told us."
was just a euphemism for you," she bemoaned.  "You're no fun anymore."
"Just a bit stiff."  Harry rolled his shoulders and arched his back tentatively.  He couldn't hide his wince at the cracking noise that followed.
Realising that this was the best he was going to get, Draco relented with a nod.  He watched for a moment as their friends trooped from the room, levitating a variety of boxes in front of them, and then turned back to Harry.  "Right then, Potter, let's get you to work."
*****
Ron's gaze flickered towards Harry's wand, and then looked back up in time just to see Draco slide into Hermione's recently vacated seat.   "I've created a monster," he grumbled.
"He's nearly fifty!"  Draco's voice was getting shriller with each word.  "And he's
the other day."
down on the table, narrowly avoiding the marmalade.
"Yes, Potter." Malfoy's look was still too intense for Harry's comfort. "Go and see your friends. It's time to end this hermit-like existence, and when you come home tomorrow, I promise you won't even recognise this place."
“Probably best that you don’t touch, then, Weasley.”  Malfoy had approached without them even noticing.  “Harry,” he said.  “Good to see you again.”
Draco looked shocked.  Which considering his exceptional ability to mask his feelings, was incredibly telling.  He nodded.  "Thank you.  That would be good."
**********
“There’s no point in cooking that much food just for the two of us,” Harry pointed out.  “Not even Ron can eat that much.”
**********
"How long would you…What?"
Harry stepped closer still. "No joke," he said, hands raised placatingly.
Draco felt the heat rise in his cheeks at the memory of that particular evening – Harry's hands smoothing cream all over his naked...Draco brought that line of thought to a halt immediately.  A hard on at the dinner table was hardly appropriate.
“Draco seems to be enjoying himself.”
Harry's now certain someone's spiked the champagne. Apparently he voices this thought out loud because Blaise is laughing again.
"Good evening, Draco."  The door opened to reveal a smiling Hermione.
feelings – but he's never been one to shy away from a challenge.
"Master has unexpected visitors. Should Kreacher be sending them away?"
Ron, on the other hand, was rather enjoying the attention –there was a good chance he'd never take his uniform off, if it was down to him.  The grin on his friend's face did little to ease Harry's grumpiness, and he was just pondering the merits of tipping Ron off the side of the platform, when Hermione emerged from the train to distract him.
"But why?"  Harry couldn't ever imagine the Weasleys turning on him, and this was surely the same thing.  When there was no reply, he turned to Malfoy and found him draining the last of his drink.
"Not really, no."  Draco had had an inkling about Hermione's intentions since that first dinner invitation some months ago. He hadn't expected Potter to figure it out so quickly, truth be told, but now that he had, Draco wasn't going to lie about it.
type."  Malfoy says it without a hint of irony and then he's on his way again.
"Slacking off already?" he asked, with no effort to moderate his tone.
"It's not that easy though."  Harry leans forward, elbows on knees and chin in hands.
Pansy laughed then, loud and throaty.  “You’re a shit liar, Potter.”  She patted him gently on the cheek.  “That bodes well for you.”   The music slowed then.  Pansy stepped back and let her hands fall to her sides.  With only a nod in his direction, she turned to leave.
"Go away, Malfoy."  The words were Harry's only acknowledgement of his company.  His eyes remained closed, his body still.
He juggled his unwieldy burden into one hand and, with the other, rapped smartly on the door.  The snow was starting to fall heavily now, and he silently willed Hermione to answer sharpish.
"I'm not...she's...Astoria isn't here," Draco admitted finally, and Harry felt a twinge of satisfaction at hearing him struggle.
By no means as tall or as well built as most of the dance floor's occupants, Harry still cut an imposing enough figure that his passage through the throngs was assured.  The war might have been over for some years, but there wasn't a week went by when Harry wasn't featured in a paper or magazine.  While anonymity was usually something he craved, this was one occasion when Harry's notoriety came in very useful.
Harry was so interested in Blaise's return, and Draco's plans for him.  "No," he said firmly.  "Blaise is a little too narcissistic for my liking."
"Okay, what did you have in mind?"  Draco produced two bottles of water from the bag and handed one over.
you didn't mind.  You
Harry gave himself a quick shake.  He reached up and took hold of Draco's hand.  "What's going on?" he asked firmly.
"Weasley, you mindless oaf! Watch where you're going."
"Potter!"
"I think Neville would have something to say about me marrying Ginny,"
"I don't understand," Harry said weakly; it was too much for his tired brain to process.
"Kick a man while he's down, why don't you."  Harry turned to Draco again.  "Aren't you going to stick up for me?"
“You may have mentioned it once or twice, but it always bears repeating.”  She grinned.  “That ought to win you a few brownie points,” she teased, glancing over to where Draco was hauling an uncooperative Pansy to her feet.  “Not that you need the help judging from tonight.”
"Are you taking anything for that?" Harry asked when Malfoy finally sat back in his chair, eyes glassy with unshed tears.
“I don’t think there’s much danger of that,” Harry replied, a little breathless from laughter.
"And what about what you owe to yourself?  To me?"  Harry pushed off the wall and closed the distance between them.
Pansy's smile faded a little. "I'm meeting up with Draco," she said. "Otherwise I'd love to."
Rose gave Draco a look that reminded all concerned that she was still Hermione's daughter, however young she might me.
"Potter!  Hold up a minute!"
"No one really knows," Hermione replies. "Relationships don't come with guarantees or instruction manuals. Just be honest. Tell him how you feel."
Having met and conversed with Narcissa Malfoy on numerous occasions now, Harry didn't doubt the truth of this statement.
Harry feels sick at these words, because he never meant… He only wanted to keep Draco away from all the crap that went with
It was a gathering made even more unusual by the last-minute inclusion of Greg Goyle, who now worked for Ron; Ron had invited him and then forgotten to inform anyone.  There was some initial awkwardness, as it had been years since Draco had spoken to his former schoolmate.  But after a few glasses of wine, they found common ground on the subject of Greg’s ex-wife, whom Draco had never liked in school and whom Greg clearly held no lingering fondness for.  Blaise joined in happily, simply glad to be surrounded by people who weren’t covertly watching him or busily discussing the more tawdry aspects of his mother’s marital affairs.
Directly after the war Harry had felt compelled to attend a ridiculous amount of Ministry functions – he'd felt it was a small price to pay to honour those who had paid the ultimate one.  But no matter how many years had passed, the level of public scrutiny he was forced to endure on such occasions never lessened any, and experience had made him no more comfortable with it.
Pansy arched one perfect brow.  "She thinks you're on the verge of splitting up."
"Then you'll either become experts in looking the other way, or become really close friends."
"I want to know what happened Friday night," he blurted out.
Hermione pushed a loose strand of hair back from her face.  "Rosie's playgroup is having a Christmas party.  And she very kindly told the woman in charge all about
Not that Harry was there for entirely unselfish reasons.  George was the only one who didn't press Harry to talk about his
“I’m not entirely sure,” Harry admitted.  “She turned up here last night, drunk out of her brain.  All Draco could get out of her was that she'd broken up with what's-his-name, and that a rather unpleasant impotence curse had been involved.”
Ron shrugged and swallowed hard. "It's just a word. Harry knows I don't care who he shags. Right, mate?"
Draco almost laughed out loud at the look of scepticism on his elf's face as she took in the chaos of his usually immaculate room.  However, Malfoy elves were taught from an early age to hold their tongues, and this one was no exception.  There was a loud crack and then Draco was alone again.
As an Auror, Harry didn’t exactly move in the same circles, but they did work in the same building, shared a couple of mutual friends, and Harry wasn’t stupid – he knew Andromeda had built bridges with her estranged family, however tight-lipped she was about it around him. By rights their paths should have crossed. How much, Harry didn’t realise until things changed. Then it seemed like Malfoy was everywhere he looked.
What little colour there had been in Draco's face vanished. "Is this some kind of sick joke?"
"Don't you think it's about time you made a move?"
Hermione squeals, and then promptly flushes. "Hormones," she says, an excuse that's been heavily used in recent months. "What did he say?"
"I'm simply getting into the spirit of the evening. Besides, I'm going to need many more of these if you two don't shut up about that damn case."
“Huh?”
The church itself was beautiful.  Harry knew virtually nothing about architectural styles, but even
“Coming right up.” Hannah scribbled some more on the pad.  “Grab a table; I’ll bring it over when it’s ready.”
Draco's eyes widen as they look from the key to Harry's face. He steps close again and suddenly his lips are against Harry's – warm and dry and over all too quickly, but it sets Harry's heart pounding just like their first kiss had. "I love you, too" Draco murmurs, and his lips brush Harry's cheek.
the brain to match."  She shut the catalogue firmly and then shuffled into a seating position with her legs crossed.  "It's our last year at school, Draco.  We should be making the most of it, having some fun, not swotting so hard that you'll end up with specs like Potter."
"Nothing a little Drying Charm won't sort out.  C'mon Harry," Ron wheedled.  "You know I'm useless at this sort of thing.  Plus, I'll only get lost on my own."
"Just some information he asked me to get."
"No." Ron shook his head firmly. "Well, maybe a little. I just…I know you took Malfoy out as a favour to me, and I appreciate it, really. But me and Pansy are good now, I reckon. You don't have to keep it up if you don't want to. I never…" Ron stopped then and looked away.
Wasting no further time, he closed the remaining distance and pressed his lips to Harry's. Not that wild Thestrals would drag it from him, but Draco had thought of this moment on and off ever since he'd seen Potter come out of the lake back in fourth year. And not even his wildest imaginings could live up to the reality of Potter's lips, warm and soft, and pressed oh so firmly against his own. He wasted no time in burying his fingers in Potter's messy locks, just as he'd done in his head many times before.
"I have no intention of hurting Harry," he replied stiffly.
Draco spun round with such alacrity that he set a pile of booklets tumbling to the floor off his desk.  Astoria dropped to her knees immediately and began gathering them.  Draco, however, was too busy staring at the new arrival to pay it any heed.
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
“Marcus Flint,” Pansy replied, the distaste clear in her voice.  “It seems his ability to get her pregnant far outweighs his less…pleasing qualities.”
Harry’s eyes widened in surprise.  “Teasing?”
"I have." Ron protested the slight to his bravery. "Haven't I, mate?"
As the door slammed shut behind them, Draco slumped forward and buried his face in the crook of Harry's neck with a groan.
Harry shares the sentiment, hates this kind of team building crap, but he doesn't reply.  He's far too busy watching a silvery rope bind him to Draco Malfoy for the foreseeable future.  It's like potions class all over again, and Snape is having one final laugh at Harry's expense from beyond the grave.
Malfoy looked surprised at the question.
"There's nothing to tell, really."  Harry reached for the nearest bottle of food colouring and added a few drops.
As he slipped his way over the cobbles this time, Harry knew the warmth he felt had nothing to do with the spell.
Draco reached for it and motioned for her to continue.
"You never know," she said, smiling down at him. "You might want to stay on his good side for a while though. Wouldn't be half as interesting around this department without you here."
“Don’t ask me,” Harry shrugged.  “Last I heard they were at each other’s throats because Ron walked in on her naked.”
Draco looked over at his friend thoughtfully for a moment before turning to face Harry. "I'm just glad she has something else to focus on. Gives me some peace."
Harry shook his head.  “Flying visit to the Manor to pick up some
"What?"  Harry knew damn well what Draco was referring to, but he was nervous and trying to buy himself time.
going out tonight, aren't you?" she asked, trying, Draco thought, to sound rather casual.
"You can't leave."
Harry wasn't so tired that he didn't grimace at the reminder.  "Like I have a choice?  Hermione'd drag me there kicking and screaming if I dared to suggest otherwise.  A bit like Pansy would with you," he added, with a faint smirk.
?" Harry's brows raised in question along with his tone.
"Bi," was all Harry said in response.  He'd learnt early on in their friendship not to question some of Blaise's more eccentric behaviours and statements.  Trying to work out which were genuine and which were simply for effect was the quickest route to a migraine.
. I really don't think I'm the person for this job. Besides," she added, "I'm hardly in a position to warn him off relationships with ex-Slytherins."
Hermione slipped into the chair opposite.  She reached across the table and placed her hand over Harry's.  "How was it?"
"It's not so much can't," Harry said, and cast one last glance at the arse in question.  "It's more usually
“He didn’t.” Harry shook his head.  “Not really.  It’s not like he doesn’t have reason to be upset.”
"There's a lot you don't know about me," Harry said, and though his eyes still held amusement, his tone was a little more serious.
Draco grinned.  "It comes and it goes," he replied airily.
"You're a good looking bloke." Harry's expression said he hadn't meant to blurt that out, but Draco definitely appreciated the flush in his cheeks. "I mean, I'm not blind. And we do get on better now."
Ron shrugged.  “We’re both adults.  I don’t see what it’s got to do with Malfoy.”  He climbed up on a nearby stool, picked up a knife, and began to help with the sprouts.  “What’s she doing here anyway?  I thought she was off to some island somewhere with that Greek bloke of hers.”
"But I…" Harry sank down onto the sofa. "Why didn't you say anything?"
“And look, not a bridesmaid dress in sight.”
"I think we broke him," Draco said, as he leant his forehead against Harry's.
"Indentured?"
"Sorry."
That was why he, instead of Ron, was now the regular visitor to Malfoy's office with requests for their department. And despite initial concerns from his colleagues, they had proved groundless. Harry remembered the look of surprise on Robards' face when he had returned with that last surveillance warrant authorised in record time with just a hint of smug satisfaction.
“Same place as always.  Your parents…” Harry trailed off here as a look of glum realisation crossed his face.
"He never wanted to." It sounds weak, even to his own ears.
~*~*~
Harry nodded. "Yeah, I'm fine." And he was. It was just that he had started to see a new side to Draco Malfoy and had been a little surprised by the realisation that it might not prove to be a bad thing after all. It was a little early to share that, though, so he picked his drink and hid his smile behind the glass.
Potter reached for his wand and aimed it deliberately at Draco's hand – and for the briefest moment, Draco couldn't help but think of the last time he'd been on the receiving end of it.  But then Potter was murmuring softly, a gentle cadence of words unlike the typical healing spells Draco was familiar with, and he could see the cut vanish before his eyes.
Potter smiled then.  That beautiful, heart-stopping smile that just recently caused Draco's stomach to swoop every time he saw it.  "If there's one thing I've learnt over the last few years, it's that life's too short."
"Huh?" Harry pulled his attention reluctantly away from Draco to find Hermione looking over at him. "Oh, yeah. Of course." He began to collect the remaining pots on the table, but couldn't help the way his gaze drifted over to Draco constantly.
"I'll take that as your congratulations, shall I?"  Hermione spoke stiffly, but Harry could see the uncertainty that lay behind it.
Harry flushed slightly.  "I overslept and didn't have time for breakfast," he explained.  "Draco kept me up late watching some pretentious film with subtitles."
Draco glared – Pansy had hit upon a rather sore point. "We're taking it slowly.  Unlike you and your Weasley, Harry and I are in an actual proper relationship."
"I'm afraid that's confidential."  It wasn't as such, in that Draco really wasn't bound by any sort of confidentiality clause, but he enjoyed the expression on her face too much to resist.  "Now, if you could just let Harry know that I'm here?"
Pansy gave a disbelieving snort.  "Please, like you need to worry about that.  You have a work ethic that would make a Ravenclaw blush,
Felix had turned out to be okay.  A little broader than Harry liked, and his hair too dark, but he was genial enough and Harry found it refreshing for once not to be on the receiving end of barbed remarks.  Ron, to his credit, had made it feel very much like a group outing, for which Harry had been endlessly grateful.  So he had been able to chat to Felix without any pressure and they had soon bonded over a shared love of Quidditch.
Harry's stunned. His mouth opens to reply, to demand explanations, but there aren't any words. Ginny's always been able to surprise him, but
Harry did look up this time. "Confusing," he said simply.
Draco's expression softened.  "Hermione told me that you haven't celebrated properly since...well, you know."
“But-”
Even in the isolated quiet of their location, Draco had to strain to hear those words.  "What?"  And even though he
"Don't patronise," Pansy snapped.  "It's not funny.  This morning it was sick in my knicker drawer!"
A Single Step
girl, you're
Harry sighed and rubbed his face – more in an effort to buy time than anything else. He'd never been any good at talking about his feelings – something he and Ginny had agreed on. "I
"Just had some contracts to drop off upstairs. Draco didn't want to leave the shop, so I thought I'd take advantage and see if I couldn't catch you for lunch."
Ron banged his cup down loudly on the bedside table, and the resulting noise caused him to wince.  "So were you planning on telling me you fancied Malfoy anytime soon?  Or were you all having too much fun keeping me in the dark?"
Harry put down his drink and got to his feet.  Casting an eye around the room, he thought out loud, "those crisps could do with chucking in a few bowls.  And I suppose we'd better put some wine in the fridge for Theo."
.  I daren’t touch anything in case I break it.”
"Stop it," Malfoy says, and that’s all the warning Harry gets before Malfoy's leaning over him, free hand sliding up his neck, angling his jaw, and then they're kissing.  Or rather, Malfoy's kissing him.  It takes a few moments for Harry to overcome the shock and get with the programme.  But he's always been a fast learner.
Hermione didn't answer straight away. She retrieved two mugs from a nearby cupboard and set them down on the counter, before reaching for the coffee.
"What about Ron?" This wasn't the reaction Harry had expected at all, and stringing coherent sentences together was becoming a bit of an issue.
"It?" Hermione asked, "or him?"
Harry did know, but it just wasn’t enough for
Potter was a revelation.  As far as Draco knew, he had only limited experience with girls, and absolutely none with boys, yet he seemed to know just what to do, where to touch, to make Draco forget all the plans he had of his own.
that Draco was flirting with him.
"Fine," Ron replied, giving the least convincing impression of that word.
"Are you drunk?" he asks hoarsely, not entirely sure what his response will be to a
"We went out for a few drinks last night," Harry replied, as if this explained everything.
Harry woke late on Sunday morning.   He'd spent the best part of the night tossing and turning restlessly in bed, unable to shut his mind down enough for sleep.
"Did it never occur to you that…?" She trailed off and gave a shake of her head. "Never mind. Let's eat."
Draco's expression remains neutral. "Is this some ridiculous jealousy thing, Potter? Because Astoria is—"
If he was honest, Harry was secretly pleased that neither of their guests had joined them yet.  Although he and Draco had lived together for almost three years, this was the first
“I can’t do that,” Ron answered.  “It’s yours.”
By the time Draco made it to his room, it was already lit with the soft glow from numerous candles, and Potter stood in the middle of the room, looking a little uncertain.
"Of course, dear, don't mind us.  We'll be out of your hair in just a tick."
"Blaise —"
messed up, but it's going to be down to you to fix this. You have to make the first move."
Harry laughed and shook his head.  "I'm working."
"Yes."
"I suppose," Draco replied noncommittally.
Harry and Anthony grinned at each other, then nodded at her in reply.
It was hard to tell whose splutter was the loudest, but all three members of the Golden Trio were staring at Ginny with varying degrees of shock and outrage on their faces.  The youngest Weasley, however, remained unrepentant.
“iPod,” Harry corrected reflexively, whilst fondly reminiscing about the days when Hermione used to refuse to be in the same room as Draco, rather than bond tighter with him to torture Harry into Christmas-related insanity.
Draco resisted the very real temptation to kick Blaise under the table.  He settled, instead, for praying the insinuation in his friend's tone had gone over Harry's head.
"I don't think—"
"He's invited me round for dinner tomorrow night."  Draco took a sip of his drink. "We're going to talk."
"I didn't have any choice
"With a little help," Malfoy replied, with the brutal honesty that Harry was coming to find was characteristic of him.  "You?"
"So I'm stuck with him," Harry groaned.
"What's
Harry couldn't remember the last time he'd been so grateful for the existence of his Invisibility Cloak – and given the level of unwanted attention he'd received over the last six months, that was certainly saying something.
Draco’s hands settled on Harry’s shoulders and he closed the gap between them.  “None at all.”
"And Malfoy knows."  Ron's glare showed that he considered this to be the biggest sin of all.
Harry shook his head and smiled.  Obviously Draco had no intention of leaving the dining room any time soon, so it was up to him to entertain the guests.
The lack of dark room facilities meant Harry's current option was a Muggle shop, but the numerous rolls of film contained many pictures that were likely to raise a Muggle eyebrow or two. He'd have to work something out soon, with the rate at which the filled rolls were piling up. But now wasn't the time to worry about that. He was supposed to be home to meet Hermione five minutes ago, yet he was currently still in the north of Scotland.
"Think? Or hope?"  Draco looked pointedly at Ron who followed his wife into the room. "Hoping for a larger portion this evening, Ronald?"
"Are you absolutely sure he's straight?"  Hermione's brow wrinkled slightly.  "I know he's supposedly dating Astoria Greengrass, and then there was that whole thing with him and Pansy Parkinson at Hogwarts, but I've heard rumours.  And Pansy's made one or two comments in passing that have made me think."
Draco was frustrated.
“Well,” Ron said, “I might not be much for cooking, but there’s one thing I learned growing up with mum, and that’s how to peel veg.  Let me just go and dump this bag in my room, and then I’ll come give you a hand.”
Malfoy let out an audible sigh, and then sank into the chair opposite Harry. "Look, Potter, I realise that this is a difficult time for you. And I sympathise, really."
"Have you been down to breakfast dressed like that?"  Harry eyed Ron's pyjama-clad body sceptically.
"Malfoy doesn't have pigtails."  Harry knew exactly what they said, and what Hermione was implying, but he had no intention of making it easy for her.
Harry smiles again – he can well imagine this is the case.  He's learnt a fair amount of pureblood customs during this unexpected acquaintance.  "It must be a relief for you," he says.  "Having her well again."
"I also know what you said; what's changed?"
Ron nodded his agreement and seemed only too happy to let the subject drop.  Harry needed to take a few minutes to himself to process these revelations if he was to be any state to face Draco later.  And for the first time since they'd agreed to meet up, Harry found himself thinking Draco Malfoy was the last person he wanted to see at that moment.
Potter looked from his parchment and textbooks to Draco's face with an expression that would clearly have said
Glad at least one of his friends was on the same page, Harry reached for his drink. Then stilled suddenly.  “Hang on, when did he tell you that?”
Her tone sounded affected and girlish, or at least it did to Harry's ears, and he found himself irrationally irritated by it.  Malfoy appeared not to mind though, because he smiled indulgently and patted her hand on his arm.
"Bollocks," Ron muttered.
"Potter, I need a word."
"Just a rumour," Draco replied quickly – he had no desire to upset Potter, and even less desire to raise Granger's ire.  His cheek tingled at the bare thought.  "So, about Hogsmeade," Draco continued quickly, unwilling to let Potter dwell on the topic.  "Maybe I'll catch you in the
me, and that's a pretty important part of marriage by anyone's standards."
Harry laughed.  "I'm being serious.   He made those wreaths as well."  Harry nodded in the direction of the fireplace.
"Details of what?"
Blaise slaps him on the back, all large hands and amusement rumbling in his chest. "Relax, Potter. No one's getting castrated this evening. She hides it well, but Pansy actually does like you."
-----
Draco shook his head.  "Hardly.  We kissed a few times in sixth year, then he left, and I've seen him a handful of times since."
It was like fate had determined he should remain in his poky little flat forever.
"Ah, can't say no to a pregnant lady, eh, Harry?" There's a wry touch to his tone and Harry vaguely remembers stories of 3am ice cream runs when Pansy was carrying their daughter. "How is she? Can't be long left now."
"Mother came to see me last week.  We had dinner in Hogsmeade."
But Harry was determined not to dwell.
Tugging the t-shirt over his head, Harry headed for the stairs. And not before time it appeared, as Hermione had already started her ascent, clearly set on seeking him out. Her hair was even more dishevelled than usual – a sure sign of inner turmoil.
"See." Ron turned a brief, triumphant expression on Hermione, and then loaded another forkful of meat and pastry. "So, I was thinking maybe you could talk to her for me."
The comfortable silence stretched onwards before them, and it wasn't until he felt a shift at his side and a weight on his shoulder, that Harry realised Malfoy had fallen asleep.
Seconds after the unpleasant potion slid down his throat, Harry began to feel better.  The throbbing in his head receded, and left behind just the usually sleepy morning fog.  Harry reached gratefully for the cup of coffee and drank deeply.  "You're an angel," he murmured finally, collapsing back onto his many pillows.
"Huh? Oh, yeah. Fine." Harry could feel the heat rising in his cheeks and forced himself to look away from Draco's lips.
Harry laughed.  “I’m not Hermione, Ron.  I know what the grin means, and I also know that Draco will kill you if you start hitting on his best friend.”
you fidget with your cuffs."
“Talking of moving on,” Blaise said, with a watchful look at his friend.  “I hear Potter’s got himself a date this weekend.”
"It's NEWT's year, Malfoy, and I'd like to come out with some decent grades.  I don’t exactly fancy a career wiping tables at the Leaky."
Harry isn't sure if he wants to kiss or kill Hermione when she invites them to join their table, but when Draco's squeezes a chair in at his side, their knees knocking occasionally, Harry's mind is made up.  Hermione's getting flowers tomorrow.
“Malfoy,” he managed to grit out, with the barest nod of his head.
"Well, there's that, obviously," Malfoy agrees.  "But that's three days away.  I assume you'll want to sleep at some point during that time."
Draco looked up then. His smile was weak, but a smile nonetheless. "I hate you, Potter," he said, but the way he leant in said otherwise.
had witnessed her drunken antics.
"Mmm," was all Draco said in response.  Memories of that night tended to evoke memories of a particular broom ride, and somehow he doubted Astoria would appreciate him reminiscing.  He took another sip of his coffee and sighed his satisfaction through the steam.  "What brought this on, anyway?"
"Oh, I see."  Harry was sure his voice was a little higher than usual – apparently feigning innocence was not his strong suit.  "It's just that you two work together, socialise together... I just thought..."
“And he’s not deaf either,” Harry snapped.  “Can you stop talking about me like I am?”
Harry couldn’t deny that, so he nodded sadly.
Draco glanced down to where Potter had laced the fingers of their joined hands together.  "Really?"
to burst through him.
The streets of London were cold.  Bloody freezing in fact.   But despite the bitter temperatures, Draco wasn't ready to go home yet.  He had too much to think about, too many unanswered questions swirling around in his brain – so he simply adjusted his collar against the falling snow and continued his walk.
"You're working for George?"  he managed to say at last, instead of a greeting.
Not Hermione then, Harry thought. He remained still and fought to control his renewed anger.  He couldn't do this, not here, not now.
"Not half as well as you and Pansy Parkinson."  It was a desperate attempt to side track, and it worked a treat.
It was more than Draco could bear.  He scoffed as convincingly as he could manage considering the bile rising in his throat.  "Whatever gave you that ridiculous idea?"
"That's a relief.  Although, I was rather looking forward to Ron's reaction.  Maybe you could forget to mention the dress robes part to him?"  Harry looked hopeful.  "And wait till I'm there, of course."
"Is it really business though?" Blaise asked after swallowing a mouthful of ham and cheese.  "Or is there a chance you're milking this for an excuse to spend time with him?"
Harry grinned at the memories this evoked. "No. Her and Malfoy are quite friendly, believe it or not."
"I'm not ashamed," Draco protested.  But then he saw his mother's raised eyebrow, and added, "Anymore."
Pansy snorted into her coffee.
"Yeah, well, we're good friends too. But we don't spend every spare minute in each other's pockets." Ron screwed up the remains of the serviette and tossed it on the table. "It's weird."
The End
Auror Kettlewell makes his way around the room, testing their bonds.  Harry's never minded him before – he was one of the more reasonable tutors in Auror training – but he's definitely rethinking his opinion now.
his decorator, and tomorrow he'd be gone and Harry would return to his previously solitary existence, albeit in nicer surroundings. Getting his hopes up now would only make it worse when it happened.
"A little warning next time," Malfoy says, and steps out of Harry's grasp.
Harry's not sure if he's happy or if he regrets asking that question when Malfoy squeezes between him and the back of the sofa, their joined hands between their bodies, and Malfoy's free hand on his stomach.
And as Draco had noticed on more than one occasion that Weasley's eyes fixed significantly lower than Pansy's face, despite his professed dislike, he could attest to the truth of this.
Harry paused for a moment, and gazed at  Draco as he desperately tried to right his hair.  "Yes," he said softly.  "I do."
~*~*~
The faint smile became a full one now. "Okay, so not the best choice of words. But I'm a Black as much as I am Malfoy, and I'd be honoured to take on this project. If you'll let me."
Blaise sat watching, eating his way through the remains of Draco's lunch.  The smirk on his face was entirely too smug.  "So, are you still sure it's just business?"
“I can’t till they do,” Harry answered, with a rueful look in the direction of the living room.  “I thought everyone would be having an early night so I volunteered to sleep on the sofa bed.”
There, amongst the mass of sweaty, muscled bodies was an all too familiar figure.
Harry feels like he really should say something to this, but it's all he can do right now not to swallow his own tongue.  So he gives a weak smile and gestures towards the door, hoping Draco will understand.  The smile he gets in return is sympathetic.
"I'm coming with you," Harry replied in a tone that clearly implied
Harry looked at his watch.  “Draco, it’s nearly eleven.  It’s hardly early.”
"Does that mean you'll do it?" Ron was practically bouncing in his chair.
Clearly Malfoy wasn't aware of just
"That depends."  Potter's voice was low, almost husky, and Draco found himself leaning in closer despite his better judgement.
"But I thought…"
Draco just laughed and reached out for Harry's hands.  "Come back to bed," he murmured.  "You're freezing, and we have a busy day tomorrow."
"That's nice," he replied as disinterestedly as he could manage.  One quick look at Pansy's expression told him she was
“Charming,” Ron muttered, hauling himself to his feet and heading off in search of a fresh drink.  “Think you can handle a day of beer, junk food, and sport then, Malfoy?” he asked, casually throwing a fresh can in Harry’s direction.

"Short version? I'm an idiot, and I messed up."
George still hadn't come to terms with his twin's death.  And the Weasleys, though they loved him, seemed unsure of how to deal with the depth of his grief.  Even Harry could see how hard it must be to look daily on the image of the very thing that you had lost – but he could also see how this would be ten times harder for George.
Harry laughed.  "Fair enough," he said.  "Think he'll be okay?"  he asked, with a nod towards the main doors.
Draco marvelled at his own behaviour.  Although he always acted in the best interests of his clients, he was usually ruthless when persuading them to sign on to an investment that he believed was worthwhile.  The commission alone was enough to keep him in fine wine and fancy new robes; his wages went, untouched, straight into his personal vault.
"Even without the prospect of the lovely Martha visiting?"  Draco leans forward, arms resting on the counter, and his mouth quirked in a teasing sort of smile that makes Harry want to kiss him very badly.  He's imagining doing just that when it becomes apparent that Draco is waiting for an answer, and Harry has no idea what has been said.
Harry rolled his eyes.  He'd known introducing George to Muggle pop-culture would come back to bite him in the arse.  "Just remember I still have to buy your present," Harry warned.  "So be nice."
"No, we're not
“I want you to be my best man,” Neville blurted out suddenly before that line of conversation could progress any further.  “Will you...I mean, I’d really like if...”
Against his better judgement, Harry lifted his head up off the bar and out of his hands – he'd buried it there after Blaise had actually groped the last bloke that caught his eye, only to lay the blame firmly at Harry's feet.  "Where?" he asked, regretting it the instant the words left his mouth.
"I am
Harry leant forward in surprise.  "You think he still likes Blaise?"
"I talk to him all the time"
paid off.  You can actually read now."
"A snake?" Draco says, lips so near to Harry's skin that his breath causes shivers.  "How interesting."
Not in a bad way, not really.  It was just this
then?” Harry teased.
"Just an upset stomach, I believe." Narcissa placed her cup back in its saucer with a soft
to notice the faint smile on Potter's face as he watched, Draco reached for his potions knife and set about shaping his quill into something resembling a point again.
"Flat?  I thought you were staying at the Leaky."
“Fair enough,” Ron replied, clearly not wanting to argue with a woman who was handy with such spells.
“You’re just jealous.”
There's a huff from the portrait but nothing further.
"Didn't you hear what I said?"  Harry ignored the pointed remark, and swept past Draco into his flat.
Ginny's smile dropped and was replaced by a look of concern.
"I'm sure she'll understand."  Possibly the biggest lie Draco had told in some time – he knew quite well Astoria would be anything
"Good."  Harry leant back in his chair and stretched.  "Either of you want anything else?" He nodded towards the counter.
"I've always known what she is," Blaise continued.  "I've heard what people say about her, and I know a lot of it's true."
#20 Glasses of Wine
Hermione tutted disapprovingly, but surprisingly left off the lecture on the evils of drinking.  “I was beginning to think you were dead,” she sniffed.  “Where’s his lordship, anyway?”
"Okay, okay, I won't mention it again."  Harry took a sip of his coffee whilst he searched his mind for something to say next.  "So what happened today then?  I thought they'd been getting on better this last week."
Which was certainly true, however much Draco refrained from agreeing. Pansy snickered, but really that was restraint coming from her.
"There's no hurry, is there," Hermione said, much to Harry's relief. "You should take your time and make the right decision." The
"You and the rest of them," Malfoy replied bitterly, with a nod at the rest of the room.
"And yet you seem strangely unperturbed by it."  Draco frowned as this occurred to him.  Surely Potter should be horrified – not just because Draco was male, but because he was a Slytherin, and worse still, a Malfoy.
“You don’t know the half of it.
In response, Harry reached up and removed the blindfold.  “Happy Christmas, Draco,” he said softly, and then stood back to await the response.
Potter simply shrugged.  "It could be worse."
Draco opened his mouth to reply, but whatever he had planned to say was lost in the noisy clatter that sounded from their living room.
"Are you sure you want to do this?"  Draco fastened his cloak and turned to Harry, a tiny crease of concern between his brows.
Harry nodded absently.  "Okay."  But he didn't look at Ron at all, he was too busy staring at the gently steaming bag by his side.
Harry wanted to shout. But the memory of Ron's
"Indeed," Narcissa agreed. "You're practically a grown man now, and yet sometimes…well, forgive me for saying it, Draco, but you act like a child."
Ron grinned.  "Oh well," he said finally, "at least it means I can get home on time tonight.  I'd never have heard the end of it if I arrived after the guests."
“How can you know that,” asked Hermione, “Dumbledore said there was more than only one kind.”
“Oh, fuck you’re right. It almost 10 already.” He looked at the others, grabbing his bag, “Bye guys! I’ll be back later, no idea how long Snape is going to keep me.” With that, he walked out of the group. No one really batted an eye all saying bye to Harry and continuing with the game.
She smiles at him before walking over to the door opening the doorway. ‟Mister Malfoy,” she says, ‟is this urgent? I have an appointment.”
“Mostly with money,” Draco said, “We pay for every child’s education, for example.”
“Oh,” Draco said, “the Malfoy family supports the reservation that Charlie works at, so we visited it every now and again before I went to Hogwarts. Charlie has given us a few tours.” He shrugged.
Draco makes a pleased sound, kissing Harry´s cheek. ‟That does sound like a good dream.” He pauses, ‟Harry,” he says. The boy turns around looking into Draco´s eyes.
“Technically, only with a fertility treatment,” Remus consoled them, “and even then only strong wizards can handle it. Though, with your luck, you never know.” Harry scowled, “but,” Remus said moving on from the topic, “what is it you wanted to talk about?”
Harry smiles, “astute observation,” he says, only pulling away from Draco’s jaw long enough for the words to move past his lips.
‟You can tell them,” Draco says softly, ‟if that is what you want.”
Draco looked at him confused, “have you ever tried Sleekeazy?”
Draco only lifted his hands in surrender, turning to Harry and waited for him to talk. Harry, in his turn, explained the lesson to the three. Harry explained how Riddle’s features had changed, how he had gone from a handsome man to the almost snake-like features that he was now sporting.
“No,” Harry said, “We should go to the great hall, every student, with me included. The rest of the order stays. They’ll come in later. We need every advantage we have to overthrow the Carrows.” It seemed the rest agreed if their cheers were anything to go by. He looked over to Draco, beaconing him.
Harry looked over at Remus, they looked at one another for a second. “Go,” Harry said, “I’ll send my Patronus when he’s gone.” Remus nodded thankfully.
Scorpius and Regulus bound down the stairs, ‟Is Alyssa feeling better?” Regulus asks, his bright blue eyes landing on his sister.
It wasn’t long before Harry felt himself growing tired. He hadn’t slept well the last few days, so he thought he might sleep early. He told so to his friends, all of them acknowledging it, some agreeing with the sentiment. He walked to the kitchen, where he heard the soft murmur of his two guardians and his boyfriend talking. He opened the door and saw the three in a deep conversation. He leaned against the frame of the door and looked to his favourite people. He felt kind of sad that Hermione and Ron weren’t able to be part of it.
Remus and Sirius were looking at the discussion with rapid interest, Sirius moved over to Remus, as if he was going to whisper something, but said loudly, “It’s like they are a married couple,” he said.
“I’m trying to talk to you?” he says. “You see, last week I got hit with this curse and forgot like everything I know. But I recognized you, or at least there was something, and I wanted to talk to you.”
How had he missed that all the times he had been here? The whole time the letters RAB, the name had been right here. They had known who it was all this time. “Hermione! Ron!” he called out. Seconds later the two had bound down the stairs.
(See the end of the chapter for
‟I guess you don´t,” he says. Draco takes the first bite, and he makes a face. Harry laughs, ‟what´s wrong?”
Harry smiles, ‟we did! You live around here?” he asks.
‟I´m here for the appointment,” Harry hears Draco says. Harry snorts. Madam Pomfrey looks around the door towards Harry, who nods.
‟He does, doesn´t he?” Draco says with a small smile, ‟come, I´ll introduce you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
‟First painting, then the kitchen, then furniture, and then our own stuff.”
“Good,” Seamus said, “now, fancy a game of chess?” he asked.
The next day Harry wakes up happy, something that quickly turns into nervousness when he and the rest of his quidditch team move into the locker room. He gives a rousing speech about winning and defeating the Slytherins, and all his teammates seem proud and ready. Ron the most, though that might be from him thinking he had drunk Felix Felicis that morning. When they win, he looks at Draco, thinking how he would like to kiss him, but he can’t. It would have to wait.
‟I want what is best for you son,” he says walking towards them. ‟I want you to be happy and safe.”
“A letter,” Harry said, “written to me.” His voice broke when he said it. Draco inhaled sharply, his eyes focussing on the words on the envelope. Harry’s hands were trembling. He slowly opened the letter, only for it to fly up, and a voice to speak.
Harry’s legs winded themselves around Draco’s waist, his arms having relocated across his shoulders. Harry let out a deep breathless laugh as Draco walked them up the stairs. The door to their room was closed, but with one wave of Harry’s hand, it had opened itself. Draco kept walking till he was standing in front of their bed, only then did he lower Harry laying him across the bed.
“Yeah,” Hermione said, “it was awful, he was scared of a specific sound that made it possible to move past it. They even blinded it.”
“Dumbledore will know something that will work, though,” Ron said confidently.
“Would the gold and silver be one both?” Harry asked, to which the man nodded.
Lucky for Harry, Ron had thought that he would be too preoccupied with tonight, so during lunch, they could talk about the possible training they could do. Harry was happy that he still could talk to his friends, even though he had to keep this big secret from them. During the day he acted the same as he used to, well he tried to at least. He had seen Hermione looking at him strangely multiple times. Though that might be from all the avoiding of Ginny he was doing. She had seen him watching Ginny when he had still liked her, something that was quickly cured by that kiss.
“Our second year,” Draco parroted, “right, because how did you talk to him then?”
‟The common ones are enough,” she says, ‟if you forget, and do not want to suddenly get pregnant again, there is a potion you can take the day after.” Harry and Draco both nod. ‟Anything else?” Draco and Harry both shake their heads.
“Who died,” Harry asked Ginny, “Draco said he stepped over someone’s body,” it must be strange for Ginny, that Harry still used Draco’s first name when she also knew he was there.
Harry was the first to reach his climax, calling out Draco’s name, as the boy he called, held him and kissed his neck. When Draco followed, no name fell from his lips, to busy kissing him. When they finally came back from their high, they curled around one another, looking into each other’s eyes. “I love you,” they said. This time, it seemed that the room decided they could stay a bit, both resting in each other's arms. Though the light, which had been dimmed while they were dancing, turned back on brighter when it was nearing one in the morning. Though the boys wanted to fall asleep in each other’s arms, they knew they could not. Reluctantly they climbed out of the bed, Harry walking Draco to his common room, and Harry going back to his after a goodbye kiss.
‟You make it sound like you knocked him up,” Seamus says with a laugh. ‟Good thing you´re both blokes, eh.”
“What?” Harry asked, he turned around to look at Ginny. The girl in question was looking mad at him, he turned back quickly. “What in the hell made her think that?" he said with a low voice, "I don’t even like her like that!”
He opens the box to look at the ring he´d bought for Draco. Elegant, slim, almost white with a dark bright blue rock for his eyes. ‟A week,” Harry whispers. He stands walking out of their bedroom, ‟you´re right Draco, I can do this.”
Harry drags him in. ‟You really like old stuff don´t you?” Harry asks and Draco nods.
‟What is happening?” Ron asks when he walks in. He looks concerned to Harry, who gives him a small smile. ‟Dean said you had something to tell us all.”
“Harry, it is important to remember that Voldemort has warned him about us. How are you going to be sure that he will listen to us, and accept our help?”
She played innocent but stopped her hand from moving. “Sorry,” she said, though she did not explain her reasoning behind it.
“Wow,” Blaise said, “that’s awesome.”
‟I can do it if you want,” Draco says.
McGonagall has been standing beside them in silence. She turns to Harry, ‟you want to look inside?” she asks.
“I was wondering if I could come with you when you go.” Sirius said, “I remember Potter manor, it’s close to Malfoy manor, but it’s not visible anymore.” He looked sad, “before your mum and dad went into hiding, they made sure that only someone who could get into the family vault could come into the home. They made sure no one could claim their land. So, I haven’t been there since then.”
Harry and Draco sat next to one another, though Harry wasn’t leaning on him. They drunk their tea slowly. Harry was looking at the food again as if he was contemplating if he should eat. In the end, he grabbed a small piece of Chocolate, nibbling on it.
Slowly Ginny is coming back into the group, she started talking to Harry again. And she apologised for how she acted towards him, for the assumptions she made. Harry apologises for the way he told her, and for not taking the time to explain. They talk again, though they aren’t as close as they used to be.
“Oh,” Hermione said, “That makes sense, after that you were really trying to avoid Ginny and I couldn’t figure out why, I thought you liked her.” That last caused Ron to look over to Hermione.
He looked at the two men, and didn’t know what to say, thanking them profoundly again, they walked down the steps.
The two ate in the comfort of their beds, Draco asked about Harry’s writing. Something the boy had started doing more and more. Harry told him about the story he had started, a new one, not one he had made up when he was younger. They finished their breakfast, and Harry pulled Draco out of bed to join him in the shower.
Hermione and Ron had already changed into the clothing they would be wearing during the ceremony. Hermione wearing a flowing dress that was completely black, except for the belt around her waist, which was the same dark green as Harry’s robes. Ron wore a black suit, with a green tie and green pocket square. His shirt was the same off white that matched the chairs outside.
Harry nodded, “tell him that he can’t be seen by any of us. Thinking about him and seeing him are two very different things. If he was to bring it, we can not see him.”
“Yeah,” Draco said, “it was really beautiful. When I asked, you said you didn’t know if you wanted to live there. But now it sounds like you do.”
“Yes,” Harry said, not elaborating further, “he will take me the next time he finds out where a Horcrux is.”
The sound of the floo chimed through the house. Harry wondered who it was, as most people just apparated to the home. “Mother!” Draco called out, standing to hug her. The two of them were actually pretty affectionate if they weren’t in the outside world.
The only one who was really trying was Hermione, but she too didn’t want to be with Draco alone. She managed to speak to him a few times, but never in-depth. It seemed that even though the idea of why Draco could stay was good, it didn’t help any of them accept Draco more. They reluctantly did, but only for the sake of the war.
“Because we wanted to see if we could?” Draco asked, Harry conceded to that, nodding.
‟Harry,” Draco says, ‟are you for real? You´d add my last name to yours?”
Draco turned around, “the lighting is beautiful,” he said. “You could even read here while I paint.” He pointed at one of the window nooks, “we could put some pillows there, and it would be a perfect place to sit. Especially with your weird affinity for sitting on desks.” Harry laughed and nodded, having come to the same conclusion
“Nah,” Draco said, “you can be whoever you want to be. Just because we are together doesn’t mean you can’t do whatever you want. I mean, look at Sirius,” they all looked at him, in conversation with Remus, “he’s a teacher here.” He shrugged, “you won’t have to change just because I’ll become a lord one day, it’s more a job than anything else. And the people that work for us are the family.”
“Now, step two,” Twycross continued after letting some time pass, “Determination. Focus your determination to occupy the visualised space. Let your yearning to enter it completely take over your body, to take over your mind.”
“Love,” he asked, “can I ask you a question?” Draco held up a finger, signalling him to wait a second. He finished writing his letter and faced Harry asking him to continue. “You keep mentioning I’m an heir, and that I could become a Lord. But,” he paused, “what if I don’t want to become a Lord?”
“You know what Moony always says,” he said, handing Harry the piece of chocolate. Harry nodded, nibbling on the chocolate. The snake hissed something. Sirius looked down, the small snake was lying on the table. Looking at its owner. “I heard from McGonagall his name was Darsh,” Sirius said, “a nice name.” He held out his hand for the snake, letting it decide if he wanted to be touched. Much like Harry, it seemed to always want to be touched, as it immediately slithered on Sirius’ palm. He petted him, but not much later the snake went off again, moving back to Harry
They heard someone coming down the stairs, the group looked at one another. Ron turned down the light.  When the person came close, Harry recognised who it was instantly.
The group went up flights of stairs, leading to a tower that had been unused during their six years at Hogwarts. “Welcome to the eight-year common room,” McGonagall said, having given the gargoyle protecting the door their password. “There are individual rooms for everyone, though,” she said with a smile, “no one will check if they are used,” the group snickered at that.
“I can’t believe this year is almost over,” Harry said, “it’s been such a long year. So much has happened.” Draco nodded, sitting down next to Harry on the couch. “Only the trials, and then we can finally leave this war behind us.”
Draco stood, grounding Harry with a touch on his shoulder. The two looked at one another, Harry looked worried. Draco smiled at him, enveloping him in a hug. “Well,” he said, when they parted, “that’s okay. There is no Potter family, so you could disband it.” He saw doubt in Harry’s eyes for that.
Draco, whose friends would not be returning to Hogwarts, was joining them. Though it seemed only Harry was happy about that. But the boys didn’t let it bother them all too much.
“This means you will have time to fix the cabinet enough to let the death eaters in the castle when we are gone for the Horcrux.” He looked around the room, grim faces all around, “I will most definitely be weakened when we find this Horcrux, so it would be best to do it then,” he looked at Severus, “you will kill me, as we discussed. But you,” he turned to Draco, “you will disarm me. In my weakened state, it will be easy, even if your mind is not behind the spell. But do it, because it will cause them to trust you. Which is important for you to be able to stay in Voldemort’s circles.”
“Not that much really,” Harry said, “only every five days in the beginning. Though slowly less and less. In six years hell only eat once every two weeks.” He gave the little guy a pet, “
The two feelings, conflicting as they were, made sense to him when he came back. He was lying spread eagle on the floor. The intense agony Draco felt, conflicting such pain, even though he knew he had to, was strong enough to come to Harry. But the anger was part of Harry as well, though he knew this was Voldemort.
He moved his cheeks apart, blowing. Harry whimpered at the sensation. “Don’t hold back,” Draco said, “I like to hear you,” for good measure, he kissed both of Harry’s cheeks. Harry huffed slightly. Draco chuckled. He pulled the cheeks apart again, licking a stripe from Harry’s balls to his hole. Harry actually moaned at this, though still softly.
Harry nods, “I guess you’re right.” He gives a small smile, “you’ll tell me if it's too much though?”
Harry winches, he knew this question would come. ‟We´ve been dating for a little over three months,” he says. He sees people open their mouths, either in shock or to say something. ‟I know, it´s quick, but, well, there´s something else.”
“Harry,” it was Ron, he opened the door, “we are going out, last time to re-think and join us!”
They woke up with the house still quiet. After some time they both got dressed walking down the stairs quietly. They made themselves some tea, Draco adding the right amounts of milk for his. Harry is deep in his thoughts when he looks up to see Draco looking at him. “what are you thinking about?” Draco asks.
“And that was just me trying to stay alive,” Harry laughs, “when I actively start fighting it got even crazier. Though you both know I can’t talk about that yet.” They nodded.
“I’m glad you think so,” Ron said, smiling, “not everyone can own a manor at age eighteen after all.” He looked at Draco and Harry, “not that I have something against you two suddenly visiting, but I’m guessing there is something you want to talk about.”
“Now Heir Draco, repeat, ‘I, Heir Draco Lucius Malfoy, accept the title of leader of the Malfoy family. I promise to take care of my duties and my family to the best of my ability. I accept the contracts made by my predecessors and promise to uphold them and continue their legacy.” Draco did, making the promise he has lived his life towards. The sceptre glowed brighter until the light flowed to where Draco’s hand touched it. It paused there until it moved into Draco, it moved a path from his hand to his heart and core. There it settled dimming after a fraction.
People were looking at him worried, Neville asked if he wanted to sit down. Harry refused. “We need to get going,” he said, “We three need to do something and then we’ll get out of here.”
“I can’t lose them over this,” he says softly, “they’re the only family I have.”
When the training finished the team came together, talking about strategies. The next game would be at the end of the week, it would be the last one before the pause for Christmas break. They would be playing Slytherin. With all the new people in the team, Ginny as chaser and Ron still the keeper, they still had a chance against the other team.
“They reacted without waiting for the first one to move,” Remus nodded, asking her to elaborate. “Well Draco was the first one to move, but Harry had put up protection even before I could see Draco had actually shown his spell. Then it went on, again when they switched wands.”
“Okay,” Draco said, “I won’t tell you then.” Blaise groaned, signalling him to tell them. “We got bonded on Harry’s seventeenth birthday. So we’ve been bonded for more than a year.”
“Stay,” Harry said, pleading, “he can sit somewhere else.”
“Oh,” Harry says with a smile, ”I’m not going to Grimmauld.” He pauses and looks at Draco, “at least, we don’t live in Grimmauld, do we? You said I moved in with you.”
“Sir, I want to ask you something,” he said, smiling politely at the professor, who opened his arm as if to show that he was always welcome to ask anything. “I wondered what you know about,” it seemed that he hesitated for a second before continuing, “about Horcruxes?”
Harry stops thinking and the glamour disappears. ‟You´re right about that,” he says. ‟Also, I think you found out what to tell your friend.” He laughs, ‟We should have thought about that before, now people in Everton would get really confused if I´m suddenly pregnant instead of gradually.”
‟Not really,” he says, ‟I don´t think it´ll be much different than what we had with Madam Pomfrey.” Draco nods, ‟I do have some questions for him though,” Harry continues, ‟like, how am I going to deliver the baby, and will I start growing breasts?”
Harry stepped behind Draco, his tie slinging around his neck and wearing his waistcoat. He looked in the mirror to his hear, sighing. “You going to help with this mess?” he asked. Draco handed him a box before moving to stand behind Harry. “What’s this?” he asked.
‟I know the gist of the war,” he says, ‟I know Neville was something of a hero in it. Together with Harry and his friends. Even the squibs know of the great Harry Potter.” Draco frowns, ‟I also heard you say that Harry testified on your behalf. I know that if you really did something bad the ministry would never have given you a second chance. I only know the you that you´ve shown me Draco, and that is a bloke who might be pretentious as shit but who loves people. Who doesn´t care if someone´s a muggle or a wizard? You invited us here, even though you know we´re muggles.”
“To the library, duh.” Harry said, walking faster, “I want to get a book about snakes and how to take care of them! I need to know what to and what not to do!” Harry and Draco went into the library, there were few people there, and Harry walked over to madam Prince.
Neville, apparently having listened to the conversation answered as well. “You were a great teacher. I mean, I could not even disarm someone, and this was in our fifth year. We learned that in our second year. You managed to teach me. And because of you, I regained confidence that I could actually do things. And see how that ended.”
Can't believe we're almost at the end! This story will end shortly after the battle, I'm writing a story about their eight-year currently! So I'll start posting that when this one is finished!
Draco pauses for a second, ‟contractions?” he asks.
“You two would be a great couple,” he said, “We both know you fancied her.”
Everyone stuck up their hand, Remus pointed at Seamus. “Because they both used wandless magic.”
‟One also doesn´t kill for a madman, but alas, we don´t all measure up to the expectations,” Harry says with a serene smile, ‟I think Draco´s indiscretion is less ruinous of the family reputation than yours.”
Harry didn’t understand all that was happening, Draco was too far into the book for that, but he listened. Listened to the way Draco’s voice droned on, the way his voice changed when a character would speak. He listened to the story, and let his mind follow it. Slowly Harry fell asleep, his head resting on Draco’s chest.
“Weasley,” Draco said, turning to the ginger, “I am glad to hear you are making a great recovery.” Ron and Hermione both looked at him with wonder, but also with suspicion. “I heard what had happened from Harry, I am glad that he was there.”
“To better understand the connection a bonded couple has, and how that impacts their fighting, Sirius and I, will also be duelling. Mainly to see the difference between a bond like Harry’s and Draco’s, which we know is particularly strong due to their strong magic, and a bond like Sirius and mine.”
“I’ll carry him myself,” Harry said, holding out his hand. The snake moved onto his hand without hesitation.
“We know,” Harry said, “this is important, Sirius, we wouldn’t ask it of you if it wasn’t.”
“No time like the present,” Draco said, calling out for Lucien. The house-elf popped in, bowing to both of them and asking how he could help. “Would you be so kind to give us our breakfast in bed?” he asked the elf.
“Hey,” he said softly, walking over to Harry, “are you ready to get eternally bonded to me?” he asked. They had spoken over the mirror about this many times, and both agreed that it was best to perform the bonding immediately, as they could never be sure that Draco could stay for long.
Harry snickered, “The Harry Potter?” he asked, “didn’t know you already thought about me when you were younger.”
“Do you think the Black house could have a book about it?” Harry asked the group.
‟Maybe a bit too compatible,” Harry thinks. When Luna raises an eyebrow, he realises he´s said that out loud.
“How do you know what I drink in the morning?” Draco asked, looking at Harry, who was turning red. “Never mind, I know how,” he laughed.
“It’s a dragon Hermione, It can take care of itself. It’s us we need to worry about.” Ron said. Hermione cocked her head, questioning. “I don’t know how to break this to you, Hermione,” Ron said, “but, I think they might’ve notices we broke into Gringotts. The most secure place They’ll know we broke into Gringotts.” They started to laugh, Harry momentarily forgetting the pain in his scar, until it was too much.
Dumbledore’s pride shone on his face, “indeed, I am under the impression that he used those two items, that remains two other items. We can only guess which they are, but I would imagine that he would search for other relics from the founders of Hogwarts. There is no evidence of one such object vanishing. The only known relic of Gryffindor is safe,” he said, pointing behind Harry to the sword that Harry had used in his fight against the basilisk. “The best thing is that he might have found another relic of either Ravenclaw or Gryffindor.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I can’t wait to have you all for myself. If only for one night.” Narcissa would move in her belongings on Monday. Draco chuckled at that. “How will we go home? I mean it’s not like it's a walk away like Grimmauld place.”
They were ushered to the dining room. Where a nice dinner had been placed, ready to be eaten. Harry chuckled and took the place he was ushered to by Pihu, Draco being ushered to the other side by Lucien. Narcissa taking the remaining seat with a smile.
“Can’t,” Harry said, heart, thumping from the adrenaline, “promised Dumbledore and all that. Besides wouldn’t want your trip to be interrupted by a fight between us and death eaters.”
‟No thanks,” he says, causing Ginny to give him a sceptical look, ‟have an appointment with Pomfrey tomorrow, can´t show up with alcohol in my system can I.”
Harry laughs, ‟it´s a bit different than the weird sisters,” Harry says. He puts the needle on the vinyl. The first song starts and Harry mouths along with the song. Draco watches Harry moves around the room, opening another box. His hips sway with the beat of the music.
I can't believe it's the end! I thoroughly enjoyed writing the series and I hope you guys liked reading it!
Harry had told Draco more about himself than he had ever told anyone before. He had told him about the Dursleys, how they treated him, how they acted around him. He had told about the nights he had lain awake, with pain in his stomach from the lack of food he had received. He had told him about the pain he had, he told him about everything that happened to him during his stay in Privet Drive. He was happy to almost be done with all of them. Harry would only go back to his aunt and uncle until he was 17. When he turned 17 he would be able to live wherever he wanted, that’s what Dumbledore had told him, and Harry wanted nothing more than that.
Sirius nodded, “families have merged over time. But, this has always been one family taking the other up into their ranks. It has never been the two combining under a new name, a changed name.”
‟Yeah, next week we´ll visit Queenstown,” Draco says, ‟and the week after Everton. They´re the closest without any need for apparition. We´ll see if we like them, and if not we´ll have to start looking a bit further. But McGonagall will be escorting us.”
Draco looks at his engagement ring, he´s so used by the weight by now that he doesn´t even realise it. ‟Yup,” Draco says popping the p, ‟I´ll tell you all about it over a pint.”
Draco smiles, helping him with the books. They put them in the bookcase without order again, moving around. Harry sings along softly, moving dramatically when the guitar solo starts. Draco laughs, watching him. He doesn´t stop, continues singing and dancing around. It´s a sight, with his baby bump and the air guitar, and Draco falls just a bit more in love with him.
“Are you telling me you never snuck a look at him in the showers?” Draco pressed, raising an eyebrow again.
Hermione nodded wordlessly.
“Of course. Of freaking course. The saviour of the magical world is too good for a common dormitory like the rest of us, what was I thinking? Tell me, Potter, do you ever feel guilty that your friends almost died for you and yet it’s always you that gets all the glory?” Draco spit the words like so many hexes, chin raised, fingernails digging into Harry’s wrist.
“Who’s to say? Pansy’s always been sharper than she lets on and I wouldn’t put the whole thing past her if I’m honest.” Draco stroked Harry’s wrist with his long fingers, learning all the curves of it by heart.
Draco nodded, pulling Harry across to sit on the sofa opposite the two girls. “This has probably just been a long time coming,” he said. “We’ve just been too caught up in other things to notice.”
Pulling away with a gasp, Draco looked at Harry with wide eyes but didn’t say anything. After a few seconds, Draco shifted and captured Harry’s lips again in a much softer kiss. His hands fisted in Harry’s robes, he pulled the other boy closer.
. Or at least that’s what the French say.”
Harry and Draco pulled apart and looked at Pansy innocently.
“You are, and you know it,” Harry said, moving to stand right in front of Draco so that they were nose to nose.
“Guess I’ll just have to apologise then, won’t I?” Draco murmured, moving closer to Harry.
“Sometimes potions are easier,” Draco said, moving his hand slightly on Harry’s chest, making the other boy shiver. “Sorry.”
“We aren’t sure about specific requirements for the spell, but it’s likely you’ll have to be skin-to-skin.” Hermione looked entirely too pleased with herself.
Draco gave a small huff of laughter. “Well, no, you wouldn’t,” he said. “Like I said, I’ve only ever told Pansy that. I never wanted my father to find out when I was younger, but I don’t particularly care now. I’d rather be happy than live a lie.”
“Not exactly,” Draco said, unsure if he should tell Harry what had happened or not.
No sooner had Draco spoken than the very tips of his fingers started to glow faintly. Runes appeared on his skin, golden and luminescent, crawling up his fingers and covering the back of his hands like ivy. Draco’s face tightened in pain as he gripped his wrist in a vain attempt to stop the runes in their inexorable ascension.
“Can you tell if it’s gone?” Harry asked, looking to Hermione. “Just so we know for sure.”
Harry grinned and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. “I think we should play a trick on them,” he said, his eyes shining. “Let’s go in arguing. Then, we can make up with more of this…” he punctuated his words by capturing Draco’s lips in another lazy kiss.
Draco slipped his hand down from Harry’s wrists until their palms were touching, and threaded their fingers together. Harry took the gesture as acquiescence to his previous proposition; he smiled and led Draco through winding stone corridors until they stood in front of a still-life painting of a bowl of fruit.
His hand on the door, Harry signalled a silent count to Draco.
to just leave the mug in the sink without washing it?” Draco demanded, gesticulating wildly with his arms.
He got up with a flourish, pulling Harry into his arms.
Before Harry could move, Draco opened his eyes and blinked rapidly a few times before raising his gaze to meet Harry’s.
“Do we have to talk about this?” Harry sighed.
“Dreamless Sleep. When I remember it,” Draco replied. “Listen, I, er, I owe you an apology. For what I said when you told me about this room. You… you didn’t deserve that.”
“We’re not going to class,” Harry said as soon as they were out of earshot. “First, I think that being cursed is a good enough excuse to skip. Second, I don’t want everyone to know. What if we need to let go of each other and the runes flare up again? I’m not telling the professor and everyone else in the room we need to be holding hands at all times.”
“I, on the other hand, am not feeling the least bit guilty. You know what you’ve done and if you won’t feel ashamed for it, then I refuse to take responsibility for the consequences of your actions.” Pansy caught Hermione’s hand and gave it a squeeze.
Pansy looked up from where she was sitting, a frown on her face.
With that, they left the classroom and made their way back to the eighth-year common room. The school day was surely over by now and Pansy and Hermione would no doubt be wondering where they were.
Draco smiled into the kiss as he returned it. “You have the best ideas,” he said. “Come on.”
type?”
Once fed, only the matter where to spend their day remained. The dorms were too risky of course, it would be the first place anyone would look for them. The infirmary would have been the reasonable choice, but neither of them mentioned it, perhaps because the room still held memories that they weren’t ready to revisit quite yet. They ended up in an empty classroom on the fourth floor instead where they did homework for a while. Neither of them could concentrate on their reading and essays, not with the curse, and the nightmares, and everything that had transpired in the last few hours, so they soon took to playing games instead.
“Oh,” Harry murmured. “I didn’t know the… girl thing.”
“Do you reckon they knew?” Harry asked, when the giggles finally stopped “That this would happen, I mean.”
“Unlucky then, because I’m using it today!”
“I know,” Draco whispered as tears fell round and wet on Harry’s robes. “When he moved in at the Manor, I thought I was proud that he had chosen our home as his residence. I thought I had chosen it, deserved it, I thought I had to be happy to take the mark. And then Mother started falling apart, I’d notice empty bottles in her room, and she’d go without eating for days. And there was nothing I could do about it. I loved her so much and there was nothing I could do.”
Harry rolled his eyes but obliged, taking hold of Draco’s wrist firmly.
want.”
Both Harry and Draco were currently missing. Having angered their Potions teacher with their bickering, they had been forced to stay behind and clean the lab.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, lifting Draco’s fingers off his wrists and up to his mouth, pressing a light kiss onto the soft skin, “I just don’t know anymore. I’m not even sure I believe what just happened. I mean—it feels so strange, after all the years we spent fighting and bickering and trying to get each other into detention.”
“Hey! Don’t tell me we’re going to have to put up with you doing that now, instead of fighting?” Pansy demanded, clicking her fingers.
“Wood? As in
“Tell me, Malfoy, how does a spoiled baby like you cope with having nothing at all? Does it hurt that you lost everything because you were too busy grovelling for your life to make the right decisions? Does it hurt that you’ll never see your father again? Does it hurt your mother refuses to talk these days?”
won’t admit when he’s wrong!” Harry exclaimed, gesturing to Draco.
Arguing and begging their captors to set them free having proven entirely useless, Harry and Draco spent a good portion of the evening bickering over whose fault it was that they found themselves in this situation. They thus discovered that the spell
“Can… can I ask why?” Harry said softly. “I mean, you could have your pick of Pureblood girls. You’re… not exactly ugly, after all. And you’re a Malfoy.”
“How can I admit it when
“If you want the mug so badly,
As the day passed, Harry and Draco’s arguments occurred with alarming frequency. They weren’t particularly malicious, but every one of their classmates found themselves wishing the two would give it a rest.
Harry chewed his lip gently, considering Draco’s words. “And is it something you want?”
“They’re bound to be worse at first though,” Hermione said warningly. “But it’ll be worth it in the end.”
mug!”
Pansy nodded. “I know. I’m quite willing to put up with the extra arguments at first.”
“Well, sort of,” Hermione said. “What she actually said was ‘Miss Granger, I don’t believe I heard a word you said. Certainly nothing to complain about, so have fun’.”
Draco smiled at the reminder that not two days prior, they’d been fighting about something so insignificant.
“You… you woke me up screaming,” Draco replied with a sigh. “You didn’t mention that you had nightmares.”
to work with!”
Draco had drifted off into a fitful, anxious sleep when he was awoken by blood curdling screams. Harry was writhing, as if in pain, tears staining his cheeks, breath rapid and shallow. Draco’s eyes sought his hand at first, worried that lack of contact was causing this reaction, but his hand was resting on Harry’s back, underneath his heavy woollen jumper and the soft cotton of his t-shirt. Nightmares, Draco realised when Harry blindly begged an invisible shadow to
“Yep,” Hermione sighed, closing her book. “They’ve already argued about a bowl, the last bit of milk and now the mug.”
“Why do you think I have this room of my own?” Harry muttered, closing his eyes. “If I’m in here, I’m not going to keep everyone else awake.”
Draco’s eyes widened in horror. “Not until just now! Oh, Merlin, I’m going to kill Pansy! How are we meant to shower if we have to touch the whole time?!”
“Hermione, what are you saying? We have to—touch all the time?” Harry flushed as he spoke and pointedly moved as far away from Draco as the circle would allow.
“Honestly? Not a lot,” Harry said. “After everything was over, the Weasleys spent a lot of time together as a family, grieving for Fred and I had a house to renovate. It just sort of… fizzled out. We did try again but… my heart wasn’t in it. I don’t think hers was either, really.”
Feeling his heart pounding in his chest, Harry leant forward and crushed his lips against Draco’s in an awkward kiss.
“What? No! I’m not coming with you to the toilet!” Draco protested, shuffling away from Harry while leaving his hand resting on the Gryffindor’s midriff.
the one who’s dirtied it?!” Draco exclaimed, throwing his arms into the air.
They were occasionally joined by Ron and Blaise who had also grown tired of their friends arguing. So much so that they had taken to spending more time with each other than with Harry and Draco.
Before Pansy could reply, the door to the kitchenette slammed open and Harry stormed into the common room, closely followed by Draco. They were still arguing.
,” he said, rolling his eyes at the phrase. The suit of armour saluted and stepped aside as the wall slid open to reveal the door.
“Maybe,” Draco said slowly. “I mean… it can’t be that hard, can it?”
Draco scoffed. “You’re such an idiot, Potter—”
Pansy and Hermione sat together on a loveseat (rather close together, Harry noticed). Their faces lit up when they saw the boys (with mischief, and pride, and something else that belonged only to the both of them).
