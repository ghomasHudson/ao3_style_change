With a resolute shake of his head, Draco pushes his wet hair away from his face, his mouth twisting in a self-loathing sneer. Certainly, if word of their relationship got out, Draco’s fate would be far worse than Harry’s — there would be no helping him in the investigation the Ministry would launch this time. But Harry… Harry had given too much. He’d suffered enough. Draco wouldn’t allow it to happen again. How presumptuous of him, really, to have assumed Draco Malfoy deserved a happy ending. His selfishness has caused enough damage. He can’t keep imposing it on Harry. There’s only one way to put a stop to it, and Draco knows what it is.
“Hope my arse was worth the ten-year wait,“ Malfoy laughed haltingly. In the dark, with only their voices echoing against the showers’ tiles and the overwhelming feel of their bodies thrusting against each other, the space felt disorienting, cavernous. Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hip in one hand, slipped the other between Malfoy’s thighs, cupping his heavy balls and his hard cock. Malfoy let out a needy whine and pushed back against Harry. “I take that as a yes.”
Gabrielle Delacour, their nineteen year old intern, who had never declared her level of queerness, but who had come from France to London to learn English and had got on with the rest of the team like a
“You were raised by utter dicks,” Draco says softly. “You had more important things to do than notice those signs. I, on the other hand, had never seen one until I’d decided what I wanted to do with my life. Of course the snakes and staff held a crucial meaning for me. I wanted to do with Caduceus what Muggles had done with medicine. Try to put everyone’s magical Healing knowledge and access on the same level.”
For a second, Harry looked like he’d been slapped. Then he scowled, a dark glint in his eyes. “You’re absolutely correct. I do
that I’m trying to keep safe.” Draco glances at him, without lifting his head. Harry crumples the parchment in his hand as he continues.
Yes, most certainly three hours.”
I wasn’t a good guy. I wasn’t even a good
Mistor Potter. Ernestina is only saying.” Then she turns her back to him and continues her preparations.
“What the fuck, Draco? Don’t talk about them like that,” Harry burst out, and Draco wondered if he’d gone too far, but he couldn’t stop now. “Don’t talk about them like that, when we’re all still mourning—”
“Besides,” he continued, willing the flush to go away, “it was over ten years ago. Water under the bridge, and all that.”
This time, Harry stays quiet, and listens.
“You don’t have to look people in the eye. You can just… look somewhere close to their eyes. Most people can’t even tell that you’re not looking into their eyes if you do that. You can look at their neck, or hair… or their glasses.” He points at his own spectacles, crouching down at Scorpius’s height, still keeping his distance. The little boy turns his head his way, casting a tentative look. Harry’s heart speeds up and he forces himself to stay very still, to speak very gently.
in England. The
His friend. His ex nemesis.
“That’s what you said last time,” he warns, “and then we found you asleep in the hydrangea bush outside. Thank fuck we found you before the tabloids.”
Mephistopheles—it was his full name, and Merlin knew how much he hated that Draco shortened it—flapped his bat-like wings and landed in front on him on the moss-covered ground. His skin was shining, a puffy, sunburned-looking red. He smelled like sulfur. The scent was all the rage in the Hereafter, but Draco had never really cared for it.
“We’re going to have to, anyway.”
“Of course you did. Of course you followed me around, I was your arch nemesis, that’s what you’re supposed to do—”
sorry
Draco turns away.
“You’re probably spending too much time at Malfoy’s,” Ron’s voice, equally harassed, comes from the kitchen. He must be the one cooking dinner tonight. “I bet his brat has his room meticulously tidy and organised, hasn’t he?”
“Okay,” Harry says simply. Under his collected façade, his heart is beating madly. He might have pulled this off. He might start working for Draco Malfoy.
you? Again with the playful tone.
Draco clapped his hands, mock relieved. “That’s the title of my ad at the matrimonial agency. So much better. I truly am a catch! How do the single gentlemen of Britain not know?”
“But I’m interesting enough that you’re here, talking to me instead of watching the show.”
“Malfoy?” Harry asked, prodding him out of his quiet reverence.
“Yeah…" Harry admits.  "And now I’ve gone and messed things up beyond belief. If word of what happened between me and Draco gets out… it’s over, Hermione. He’s done. The Ministry is waiting for a reason to launch a full-on attack. And I’m the only thing preventing it for now.”
“Fuck,” Harry curses, adrenaline flooding him, blood pumping through his skull, his entire body going hot.
by the inexpressible pleasure of plowing into Harry’s tight, scorching heat. The kitchen was no longer quiet, filled instead with the filthy sounds of Draco’s flesh slapping against Harry’s arse, of Harry’s uninhibited moans, of his body rattling the cupboard doors with each of Draco’s thrusts. It was so good, and it’d been so long, and Draco didn’t want it to end, ever.
Inside, the house is quiet; all lights are out. Harry checks the dining room first. The table hasn’t been cleared. It’s still covered in chocolate-smeared dessert plates, half-empty cups of tea, unfolded napkins. The whole room has a forlorn air, something that resonates painfully inside Harry’s chest. He goes down to the kitchen, sticks his head in the wine cellar. He goes back to the dark, empty foyer. He climbs the stairs as quietly as he can. Ernestina’s door is closed. He feels the motion-sensing wards around Scorpius’ bedroom as he passes it on the landing — no light in there, either. It’s only when he’s about to reach the second floor that he sees the sliver of light escaping from inside Draco’s bedroom.
Hermione lets out a little laugh.
who helped Potter with that perfect winged eyeliner he was sporting yesterday (which was — what a coincidence! — the challenge I laid down: wear black eyeliner for a full day at the Ministry).
Harry crumples the pieces of parchment in his fist and sets them aflame with a furious Incendio. The ashes scatter across the floor of the lift of Caduceus and he Vanishes them with another sharp swish of his wand. He puts his hand on the wall of the lift, exhaling harshly. Under the fluorescent light of the lift, the scar on the back of his hand glows an angry, blotchy white.
Two white-eyed ravens descended from the tree after Mephistopheles and perched on each of his shoulders. From inside the demon’s coat pocket, the pointy, twitching nose of a tiny creature emerged. It was a black Niffler whose beady little eyes fell on Draco’s signet ring instantly.
Nothing to it now. He let go of the fence and launched himself on the ice.
“Oh, what a canny sense of observation, Potter,” Draco says, sarcastic, and rolls his eyes.
Harry gazed at Draco with delighted disbelief. His hand left Draco’s arm, not before trailing along the sleeve for a second.
Not now, anyway.
“So… your dad said you liked music,” Harry ventures. “I like music, too. When I was your age, I really liked, er…” Scorpius hasn’t so much as batted an eye at Harry’s words. It’s like Harry hasn’t even spoken. He scratches the back of his neck. “I really liked The Cure.” He feels foolish. As if Scorpius would have any idea who The Cure were. Or the other bands Harry liked. The Pretenders. Nirvana. R.E.M. “I don’t know if you know them... What kind of music do you like?”
“Retrospectively... it sounds so evident. Like I should have known all along.”
he mouths, and they scatter with a round of quiet giggles. Draco goes to sit at his desk. He watches, blatant and teasing, as Potter finishes with Penelope.
Hermione’s conversation partners nod at him. “A pleasure to meet you. Mr Potter, is that right? We’ve heard so much about you.” They’re looking at him with earnest smiles, but their eyes have none of the star-struck glaze that most people have when they look at Harry. It probably takes more to impress Americans than a teenage British hero figure, he thinks, and smiles back. “It’s so lovely to see that you’re an Acromantula lover like Miss Granger.”
“I’m not going to—” Harry throws his hands up. “God, Draco. This is crucial information! It’s enough to prove you haven’t committed some horrible action to get to where you are today! It’s enough to close the case!”
Marvelling at Draco’s impeccable composure in the face of embarrassment, Harry watches him disappear down the kitchen staircase. He is, once again, left to face Narcissa Malfoy alone. Her thin lips are still curved into an unsettling smile, but her eyes, now stone-cold, have lost the gleeful shine they had a minute ago.
“That’s because you trust me, and I trust you. That’s the kind of person you need to find,” Greg tells him, his earnest eyes trained on Draco’s.
There were two things that could kill a demon.
Haughty, unflappable,
After the last slice of Christmas pudding was eaten, Harry went out to the back garden with Mr Weasley. The rest of the family moved to the sitting room, the young parents carrying sleepy children on their shoulders.
“Look, mate,” Ron says, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck. “I was honest, earlier. I… I had no intention of acting like the main Auror on the case tonight. Actually, I’m not going to be an Auror around Malfoy. Not anymore.”
At the sound of the word, Harry groans, rolls him hips faster. “Yeah? Tell me — what else?”
girl down.”
“Which time?”
Ron leans closer to Harry. He lifts an eyebrow and nods at Harry’s neck. “Honey. I think someone else is diverting Harry’s attention…”
It’s always been Malfoy.
“Not anymore, Mistor Potter. Ernestina started working for Mistor Draco when he got married.”
Harry is kissing him.
“I’ll go get him,” Harry says, and all but runs after Draco.
“I want to make you feel good, Potter.”
Narcissa stares at him for a second, as though she can’t quite believe he dared say the words he did. Then she lets out a surprised, delighted little laugh and shakes her head.
“As I was telling Mr Potter just before you arrived, Draco, I came here for your birthday,” she says. “I wanted to see you — and my darling Scorpius, of course. However, I can book a room at the Dorchester if my presence is going to be of any inconvenience.”
Harry braces himself and says: “He’s figured it out.”
“Oh, god— Malfoy,” Harry gasps as Malfoy’s arse twitches around his cock. He’s so tight, and Harry can’t hold back. His balls tighten, his cock aches and throbs as his own orgasm crests, and with a long grunt, he lets go. Hand digging in Malfoy’s hip, he thrusts hard, once, twice, and empties himself inside Malfoy, eyes screwed shut, balls tight against Malfoy’s.
This is even more embarrassing than I feared.
Harry turns around. The Minister is standing in his office doorway, tall and wide-shouldered and formidable-looking. He hasn’t changed much in all the years Harry’s known him. Except for the deep creases across his forehead and between his brows, Kingsley looks just as youthful, authoritative, and charismatic as he’s always done. The one time Harry had brought it up with him, the Minister had just laughed. “Thank you, Harry,” he’d said, “but you should know that’s how people describe you, not me.
“Bugger,” he said, grabbing Malfoy’s arm to steady himself.
He instantly knows he’s fucked up too bad to get a free pass this time.
“You never do anything half-heartedly, do you?” Pansy muses from behind her glass of wine. No one can tell if she’s talking about Draco or Hermione.
Luna chuckled softly, her palm tree-shaped earrings tingling with the motion. “Does it surprise you?”
be as loud as you want.”
Went from one extreme to another, the rumours say. Went from blindly abiding by the old pureblood values and traditions, to pulling scantily dressed, glittering young men in the trendiest gay clubs of Muggle London.
Tearing his eyes away from the fascinating sight of a talking animal that no one else but Draco could hear speak, Draco told the little group gathered around him: “Or, you know, maybe not. We don’t want to set him out on the grounds and have him attacked and killed, do we?”
Beaming with triumphant glee, Draco squeezed his fist tighter.
“Oh, no, no, no. None of this, Potter. I heard you. We’re going to die. Now spill it out. Is there someone? Who would you like to fill your—ah,
Harry laughed. “A risk we have to take into account, for sure.”
“Beg your pardon?”
He rubbed small circles over Harry’s rim like Harry had done just a few days before. Above him, the sweetest sounds were falling from Harry’s open mouth, Draco's name soft like a prayer, and Draco pushed a knuckle in when he felt the tight ring of muscle relax under his fingers.
“Scorpius sat at the piano one day, and started playing. He taught himself, with a little help from me. That’s all he does. He plays the piano, he goes to school, he goes to his therapist appointments. Sometimes we go for a walk in the park. Most of the time though — he’s here, with me. Playing, always playing. For us it seems — unbelievable. For him, learning music is like learning another language. At this age, he can still do it seamlessly.”
“Next time?”
“Any secret traps or passageways I should know about?” Harry asks.
McGonagall studied them over her cup of tea. If she was surprised by Harry’s gesture towards Draco, she didn’t let it show.
“Scorpius is a good kid,” he says. “And his dad is a good person now, it seems.”
“Oh. Three hours?” He looked at Luna, who gave him an emphatic nod. He jumped.
the logo spells, and the rest of the parchment is written in official-looking French.
remains to be seen,” Malfoy snarls, and pushes at Harry’s fists, forcing him back. Harry staggers, one hand still wound into Malfoy’s collar, as his back meets the next row of cloaks. The hangers clink like wind chimes. Harry gropes at the coats for leverage. He’s surrounded by the thick, dry, muffled smell of a dozen winter cloaks, and pressing against his front, the scent of Malfoy. Pressed cotton and fresh laundry detergent and the lingering aroma of a masculine cologne. Malfoy’s breath is hot and fast against his face, and Harry feels his senses go taut with it.
as Aurors.”
“Oh, I think we’re both winners in this game.” Malfoy’s teeth glinted as he smiled. “Especially if you properly fuck me.”
Malfoy’s fingers wrap around his in a confident grip.
“Oh.” Malfoy turns his attention to Harry. “I was getting fed up with all the delicious French food, cheese and wine, obviously.”
Draco barks a laugh. It’s laced with bitterness, and he hates himself for it.
“Still dreadfully injured, I think.”
meeting, actually.”
“Merlin, Seamus, please tell me you and I aren’t that gross,” Thomas laughed. His boyfriend closed his arms around him in a tight bear hug.
Harry, who had begun to scratch notes on a piece of parchment, stopped short.
Luna beamed.“Is that all? Oh no, does that mean you’re going to leave already?”
A beat, then, “Yeah.” Voice small, almost embarrassed. Apologetic.
“Which one? Every answer that woman gives me hits a little too close to home.”
“The Headmistress wants me to tell Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy that they are expected in her office,” the small boy announced, quivering with the importance of his mission. “You can join her there now.”
“What do you mean, it would be easier to call me ‘Mal—”
and it has the same heart-stopping effect on Draco. “Jesus, Draco, how thick are you? We’re
!” Spittle flew from his mouth as he waved his arms about.
“Where you are merely average, Potter, I excel,” Draco told him, his amused half-smile cancelling the haughty lift of his chin.
—but mostly for the worst, in all the other times.
They stepped onto the lawn and set off in the direction of the Quidditch pitch. The night was quiet around them, stars twinkling in the black sky. The sounds of music and chatter filtered out from the castle, but the reunion party seemed like worlds away. Next to him, Malfoy was silent, a tense frown on his face.
“Same team?” Malfoy asks, then he repeats, “Same team.” Rubs his fingers along his jaw. He takes a breath, and something settles in his face. He gives Harry an almost imperceptible nod. Once.
enough — more than most people in my profession do. I spent the best part of sixth year following your every move, after all.”
—Harry, this is about showing them that they’re not alone! That even their absolute hero is like them! This is about—about giving people
He shrugged.
“Best if I just introduce you to her, I think.”
“Is it new, or...?”
A wonderfully debauched-looking Draco appears on the threshold, his jaw dropping and his face turning two shades pinker. If Harry had any hope of hiding what they’d been up to the night before, the sight of Draco with messy hair, rumpled t-shirt and jeans and his chin almost scratched raw from stubble burn sends it flying through the window.
There were two black ravens perched on the fence, their white eyes on Draco.
Harry gives his head a slight shake. There’s no way Malfoy collects records. It’s just… darker in here, and Harry’s vision might need time to adjust.
“Why did she come back here, then? Why didn’t she stay in France?”
All of which probably meant nothing now, in the light of day.
They stare at each other, Harry looking for any sign that Draco might be lying — hiding something from him. He doesn’t find it. He never expected to.
Harry
It had started snowing. The sight of the magnificent bridge crossing the wide, sluggish waters of the Thames, Big Ben and the Westminster Palace illuminated in the distance behind curtains of fresh snowflakes, took Draco’s breath away. His feet came to a halt of their own accord.
There was a small boy standing by their table. First or Second Year, Draco thought. Had he ever been this tiny? The boy was red in the face, his eyes flitting between Draco and Pansy as though he couldn’t decide which one of them was more intimidating. He fidgeted, wringing his hands. He obviously had something to say.
They stared at each other for a moment that seemed to stretch and stretch, Luna’s expression of placid earnestness unchanging. Eventually, Draco lifted his eyebrows, perplexed.
“The air stinks,” Draco muttered but let Harry pull him by the hand towards the stairs.
“Yes,” he said. “I want to be with you today.” He took a breath. “I love you too.”
“But…?”
It’s like he told Malfoy, that night: he’s not ready. He wants to take his time.
“You and the Weasley girl aren't together anymore?”
“Goodnight, Harry. You’ve already spent too much time with us tonight.” She holds him by the shoulders and take a step back to give him a meaningful look. “Now go find your man.”
Harry grabbed the teapot Luna had left on the counter and aggressively poured himself a cup of tea.
“To Juvence,” Pansy lifts her glass with a smirk, and Blaise clinks his glass to hers.
“Malfoy,” he hisses. “What are you doing here?”
Caduceus’ massive profits had also allowed Malfoy to start various charities: rehabilitation of inmates fresh out of Azkaban; funds for war orphans; several charities that provided information and support for autistic wizarding children and their families.
Let’s see each other again. Preferably as soon as humanly possible. Please?
“Impressive,” he murmured. Draco canted his head to look at him. Harry was gazing at him, green eyes intense and melancholy. Draco swallowed.
He still doesn’t know what it means that he wants Malfoy that way. He’s never thought about his needs and wants and the teenage fantasies he’d kept at bay with a steady routine of blank-minded wanking. He’s never thought of himself as — Merlin forbid —
Avada Kedavra
“How near?”
This is
Draco looks at him, his eyes pained and piercing.
” He smiles, a mixture of nostalgic and rueful. “If only they’d known how magic it truly was.”

Harry had the habit of making Draco’s ribs feel too tight for his lungs, sure. Yet making a fool of himself just wouldn’t do.
Look, I don’t want to sound like a wet blanket, but participating teams are supposed to win bets all on their own.
He looked around frantically.
Draco’s throat was tight. “You got all this from a career-choice formula?” he croaked.
Harry was waiting for him, radiant and so bloody irresistible under the moonlit snowflakes.
Pansy,” Draco had said through gritted teeth. Pansy had ignored him, as was her habit when Draco said ludicrous things about Potter — which he had to admit was probably the case in that moment — and had turned to call out for her husband with a shrill, “Blaise! Come over here,
“Yes. And I’m sorry I had to find out the way I did, but…” Harry glances at him. “Maybe I feel the same,” he admits, barely above a whisper.
“We’re just going through the hypotheses, Draco,” Hannah Abbott says, lifting her eyebrows. “If you weren’t snogging, then judging by the abused state of our poor office door it was either a rather vigorous fistfight, or—”
it said.
His colleagues start practicing. There’s a lot of giggling and cursing going on as Draco walks past the bent forms of Lavender, Parvati, Matilda, Hannah, and Gabrielle. He catches Penelope’s eyes across the office and smiles at her half-annoyed, half-affectionate expression.
Draco hoped to Lucifer he could keep his blush in check. Turning to McGonagall, he nodded.
“Yes, Mistor Draco,” the house-elf says. “Mistor wants to come and see?”
Until last night.
The office is silent, save for his own heartbeat ringing through his skull.
Draco has a few hours free on a Sunday afternoon. Draco, Harry and Scorpius take Balzac for a long walk in Hyde Park. It’s a cold, overcast, calm February day. Enough that Scorpius doesn’t get sensory overload. Draco and Ernestina learned about the value of this kind of weather for Scorpius through trial and error and Dr Dawson’s directions, but Harry seems to understand it instinctively, suggests they go out.
is he thinking about sex right now, anyway? Not sex, exactly. Girls. Girls and the fact that he hasn’t had one in over a year, and he doesn’t even miss it. He doesn’t miss not having a girlfriend. He doesn’t even miss not snogging girls. But… but it’s weird. He misses sex, he thinks. Yes, he does. He misses being close to someone that way. The before, and the after, and not just what’s in between. He misses having someone who cares about him enough to make him feel good, and take pleasure in Harry in turn. Not that… not that it’s really been his experience of sex, so far. There had been little give-and-take, little generosity in it. His nightly romps with past girlfriends felt utilitarian and cold, somehow. They’d felt good, very briefly, but afterwards Harry was left feeling empty, dirty, used. Harry can’t wrap his head around that particular paradox of his: that he wants to be with someone, and yet isn’t actively seeking companionship, isn’t drawn to any of the girls he’s met. Not since Ginny. Maybe, if he’s entirely honest, not even since before her.
“You don't care.” His question comes out flat.
Cardiarchy, a brew that restarts the heart of a victim of cardiac arrest.
-Draco
He stands, brushing clammy palms against his jeans.
“Hey, Malfoy,” he said, placing a reassuring hand to his shoulder. “It’s going to be alright.”
“This is Scorpius’s and Ernestina’s floor,” he tells Harry. “They’re out at the moment, so you can take your time if you want to look around. It’s a rare opportunity — neither of them like having uninvited strangers in their rooms.”

“Party’s over,” Blaise shrugs.

than anything he’d ever done. It felt like a point of no return, and Draco relished it, bringing his face close, letting the soft skin of Harry’s erection stroke the soft skin of his cheek. Harry’s cock spurted another trickle of precome and Draco laughed quietly.
Draco followed at a much less enthusiastic pace.
“God, Draco…” Harry’s fingers close around a fistful of hair. “I want you so much.”
He stands in the middle of his office, hands in his hair, breathing hard. Now, why was he looking for a box of quills again…? Ah, yes. Draco slides his hands down his neck, shakes himself out of the emotions swirling in his head. He’d broken the tip of his quill and needed it for —
Harry exhales a small laugh. Draco wonders if Harry is as relieved as he feels. Harry rolls off him. He slides a palm down Draco’s belly, traces the rivulets of come on Draco’s skin, down along the inside of his thigh. Draco squirms under his touch. When Harry looks up at him again, the question clear in his eyes, Draco can do nothing but nod.
He gives the door to the DLF a perfunctory knock before barging in.
Harry flipped him two fingers but smiled grudgingly.
I prefer the term ‘consultancy’.
Could
“And it works?” Hannah challenges, chin lifted up.
In response, Draco pushes his face into Harry’s palm, breathes him in. Licks along his lifeline, and Harry’s breath hitches.
“You shouldn’t say that.”
“Fuck, I’ve wanted you for hours,” he moaned as he attacked Draco’s mouth with hungry, desperate kisses.
It was a cruel twist of fortune that Draco had seen Harry more times in the past month than he had since that ill-fated night two years ago.
Malfoy’s answering smirk sends a wave of warmth through Harry. Malfoy holds out a pale, elegant hand, and Harry takes it.
The Minister usually sends him a few cases via owl whenever Harry’s in-between missions. The fact that he requested an appointment means it’s something important for Kingsley, or he wouldn’t be discussing this in person first.
You’d be keen?
Retrospectively, those few years of adolescent passions and frantic lovemaking felt like the pinnacle of carefreeness. Then it all went to hell.
“Potter…? Why is he already here?”
“Books and quills... this might be a bit too obvious. I bet half of Hermione’s trunk is packed with those already.”
“You know you’re not.”
Harry thinks, unbidden, and bites his lip.
The way prodding at a neglected, painful muscle can feel oddly soothing.
The thought of it hits him as he’s arranging his things into the wardrobe and chest of drawers. The two attic rooms are going to be his home for the duration of his employment — or, more truthfully, the duration of his
when I was five.” Harry felt him swish his wand. When he turned to look at him, a second sphere of light was floating above them, just as dim and dismal as Harry’s.

On the floor, on their left, Harry sees the immobile form of Balzac, eyes wide and terrified, trapped under a Petrificus Totalus
“You know,” Potter said through gritted teeth, “there’s one way we could settle this once and for all.”
Anyway! Sorry, sweets. I’ll admit it’s fairly hard to beat me. Or Millie. I’ve a renewed respect for my cold hearted, strong-willed colleague.
Harry doesn’t feel ready. He just knows that— “If I don’t get my cock inside you right this minute, I might die.”
-Harry
At Pansy’s thoughtless comment, Draco freezes next to Harry. Slowly, all eyes turn to him. Pansy’s hand lifts, as if in slow motion, to cover the quiet
“Will you show me the rest of the house? If I’m going to be living here… and I’m protecting you… it makes sense to know the place.”
Like he’s finally going to fuck a man, and he’s breathless with it.
He wants to know if he’s succeeded.
“And if I don’t?”
“You are on, Potter.”
And you swore to me. Instead…” Draco casts a meaningful look around the study to make his point. “...instead your little friends barged in here, into my home, where my child lives.”
“Hear, hear!”
It was a chore and a half.
“May I help you?”
Harry met his pale grey gaze. His eyes were worried, so different from mere hours ago when they had glinted dark with passion.
Greg sighs, his mouth curling slightly. It’s almost unnoticeable, but Draco knows him well enough. Greg is moved. He holds out a hand as big as the house-elf’s head, and Ernestina wraps her long fingers around his and leads him out of Draco’s office.
Harry pulled back just a bit more. Draco stared. What a sight Harry made: mouth open, lips pink and wet, eyes dark with need. He was the most mind-blowing thing Draco had ever seen. It wasn’t just the way he looked, but just the fact that he was who he was. Harry Potter.
Fortunately, the area around Draco’s house is mainly Muggle, which keeps it under the wizarding journalists’ radar. It’s heavily protected by repellent spells and charms in case the Muggle parameter wasn’t enough, which means Harry can come and go without being bothered.
Once they’re home — once they’re in
“Draco. Oh, Draco,” Mephistopheles said with an ugly, carnivorous grin. “They think you’ve been off the hook long enough now. They think you can take on more responsibilities, Draco. They definitely think you–ah,
“Oooh, I
“It’s fine,” Luna repeated. “I said I trusted you. I fully consent to this interview.”
“Shall we move, Potter? Or did you plan to set camp here for the night?” Malfoy’s haughty drawl resounded yards ahead. He had stopped and turned to scowl at Harry, hands on his hips, imperious.
“In what world could I possibly need you, Potter?”
he wants to be anything else.
His throat is tight all of a sudden, and his hands shake slightly when he rests the folder in his lap. He hasn’t seen Malfoy or heard anything about him in years. As far as he knows, Malfoy fled England shortly after the war. Harry has been abroad on missions most of the time. He’s kept away from the press. He’s never asked anyone about what happened with Malfoy. He just can’t comprehend where the visceral shock comes from, seeing Draco Malfoy’s picture among papers that clearly document a case where he’s considered the prime suspect by the Ministry.
with the Minister’s secretary. If Harry ever made Dewey feel like he was used for sex, the young man could make his life hell—and his visits to the Ministry ten times more unpleasant than they already are.
“Limping. Looks like his chest still hurts. But he’s with Scorpius now.” Harry watches Draco, the way he still seems to hesitate on the threshold. “How are you? Ernestina?”
Harry sighed. His exasperation wasn’t directed at Draco, however. “I want you to know once and for all,” he said, “that I will
“Oh, we should keep him! Can we, Ginny?”
Draco studies him for a long moment, the light of the day’s sun slowly fading from red to a pale blue. Harry holds his breath and waits, hoping, wondering. Draco nods eventually, but the glint in his eyes doesn’t soften. “I’m starting to
“You were staring,” Malfoy says flatly, very much not a question.
“He’s fine… He’s resting. He’s going to be okay.”
“Leaving so soon?” asks Hermione, who’s just slid in the spot next to Harry. She sounds more teasing than surprised.
Draco snorted, a bitter sound that he instantly hated. “Okay, now you’re just describing
reads the line underneath it.
“A new breed?” Draco asked, interest sparking.
“See,” Hermione's saying, gesturing so enthusiastically with her fork that Ron has to lean back. “I think the next step would be to have Caduceus approved as a supplier for the Ministry. That would help the exchange of information and research tremendously.”
Try as he might, Harry hasn’t managed to forget about the heat and want that transpired between them in that cloakroom. He doesn’t care to find out what it means that he can’t. What it means that he let it happen in the first place. That he
Pansy had commented with a smirk. Draco had huffed and harrumphed, but he hadn't been able to deny that Pansy’s teasing remark had had a ring of truth to it. He was a screamer, wasn’t he? Though he hadn’t had much opportunity to scream, if one got his meaning, in the past year or so.
“Yes, Headmistress?” he said. With her, he always had a respectful, deferential tone that Draco wouldn’t have thought possible of Harry Potter.
Draco snorted before he could help himself. “I seriously doubt it, Potter. Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that it wouldn’t be
Ernestina goes, and Harry is left alone in the bright foyer, a large, friendly Bernese wagging his tail against his ankles.
Draco does. It’s a scramble, hands fisting in hair, eyes scrunched closed, tongues and teeth and the small thrusts of hips against hips, innocuous at first, unnoticed, and it’s almost too late when Draco realises he’s not going to be able to stop this, to stop what comes next. Harry's thigh has slid between his open legs and he's rutting against him.
He nodded towards the trapdoor, and Malfoy gripped his wand in his fist, his face shining with excitement.
They would both have to get used to it.
But what do you think would be best for him?
“Oh, please. When I went back to our room that day, you were
The kettle boiled. An awkward silence settled as Luna filled the teapot and fetched them all milk.
I have. You
The rest of Harry is starting to ache for this man, this hardworking and patient and… kind man.
“Yeah, I want… to feel things,” Harry confesses quietly. “I want…”
When he walked into the office, Harry was already sitting in one of the chairs across the Headmistress, a cup of Lapsang Souchong placed in front of him on the desk. He took the teacup’s handle between index and thumb. His blunt fingers held the small porcelain cup with a delicacy Draco wouldn’t have expected from him. The smoky aroma of the tea drifted to Draco. Mixed with the scent of firewood in the hearth, the presence of Harry, and McGonagall’s kind expression, the scene indicated a casual conversation more than a telling-off.
Draco pulled back with a smirk. He wet his lips for the next bit. “Can I lick you?”
Granger,” Draco says, his crooked smile making it sound like a friendly jab rather than a rebuttal. “We can be partners, and that’s the best I can do.”
Something
And Draco wouldn’t give him the pleasure to look impressed. Not until the locker room door closed behind them.
Inside, things had become ever more cheery than the last time Draco and Harry had been there. There was an entire herd of reindeer ornaments frolicking around the imposing desk and along the bookshelves lining the walls. Floating golden baubles sprinkled enchanted glitter everywhere, and a Christmas tree had been squeezed in the corner where Dumbledore’s magical instruments used to be displayed. In this cheery decor, the hard-nosed Headmistress made for quite a startling sight.
“No, Penelope, I’m genuinely curious.” He puts his hands on his waist, tilts his hips, gives Potter a defiant glare. “Potter here appears to believe I live as a personal insult to him.”
Harry let go of his cock and pushed him up against the door again, pressing impossibly close. He grabbed Draco’s face and kissed him, unconcerned with the spunk lingering on his fingers and his clothes. He kissed his lips, his cheeks, down his neck, whiny little breaths escaping him as he did. He finally rested his forehead against Draco’s shoulder. They stayed like this for a long time, catching their breath.
Malfoy — and god knows what the blond git has been up to since the war and the trials. Since narrowly escaping a sentence in Azkaban.
Malfoy pulls back a fraction and considers Harry.
“I know,” Harry teases, following Malfoy down the last flight of stairs. “I’m a terrible employee. Insubordination, insolence, tardiness… you should see my recommendations.”
She stepped back, a hurt look on her face. “I refuse to apologise for actually having done the maths on the night of the Battle! Give away one person, save hundreds. I’m not saying it was an easy conversation, but Neville understands. And so does Harry, incidentally. I’m not the only
Harry turns around, all fake bravado gone, and Draco opens his arms. Harry burrows against Draco’s body with a soft whimper, instinctive, like a small animal looking for warmth.
Harry thinks about his own best friends, and how he would share Saturday breakfast at home with them without a second thought. They’re
Harry
Harry’s mind provides him with the memory of the photograph on Scorpius’s bedside table, the pretty woman with a hand on her round belly, Draco pulling her close. The pang of unexpected sadness brings him back to the moment: Ernestina is staring at him again.
around the room. Draco relaxed and pulled Harry by the back of his neck into another fiery kiss. As always, the first soft, wet touch of Harry’s tongue to his made him painfully hard within seconds, eyes rolling back as his head hit the door. He tilted his head more, letting Harry explore his mouth, caress his tongue, the kiss turning slower, more tender as it lasted, bodies slotting against each other, hips grinding against hips. Harry’s fingers slid along his cheekbones, into his hair; a hot, filthy version of the first time he’d done this. The memory hit Draco like a spell: Harry wrapped in a garland of fairy lights, a puff of smoke passing from his mouth to Draco’s, from his breath to Draco’s, initiating him...
The door to the boys’ locker room was on the side of the pitch. It was almost too dark to see it, but Harry—and Malfoy—had walked to Quidditch practice so often, he was certain they could have found it in their sleep.
Harry looked pleased. Even a little smug. “Yep.”
he realises. As Harry stares at the picture, photograph-Malfoy winds an arm around his wife’s shoulders, pulling her closer to him with a fond smile as she laughs. They look bright, carefree. Happy. The photograph loops again and Harry snaps out of it. He puts the frame back where he picked it up and quickly walks out of Scorpius’s room.
for lack of a better adjective. It’s neat, lively, and house-elf-sized. There’s a small bed tucked in the corner, along the wall where a large window overlooks the garden. Red-and-white checkered curtains hang on either side of the window, matching the bed covers and the thick burgundy rug covering the floor almost entirely. On the other side of the room, there’s a bulky chest of drawers that Harry can tell is almost full to bursting, a squashy armchair, and a small coffee table stained with old condensation rings.
“Both,” Malfoy said, and Harry felt his deft fingers fumble with his belt.
“Honestly,” Hermione had said sternly. “I know how Harry can be, but I expected better behaviour from you, Draco.”
Oh god, I know what happened.
Then realises his feet are taking him in the opposite direction. Towards the place where he knows the intruder will be. You
“It’s really not that selective,” Harry grinned. “You’re going to hate it.”
“There’s a shelter nearby,” Harry told him. “If we run fast enough…”
“Potter…” he whispers, and Harry pulls him down and kisses him.
Draco’s eyes flicked to the spot where his gaze had kept returning since they’d sat at the Library table.
You love it.
He took the seat next to Harry. The Headmistress gave him a thin-lipped smile.
Like you
want to be found.
“Harry?” Lavender asks, all innocent wonder, and a few gasps echo around her.
“It isn’t one for me, either,” Harry said, just as softly.
“Good morning, Dewey,” he says. “I’ve a meeting with Kingsley. Ten o’clock?”
however—and rub them in his face.
Jeff smirked slowly. When his lust for shiny things didn’t blind him, he was actually quite good at detecting weaknesses. And it seemed Draco hadn’t been good enough at hiding his.
“The Barbican firecalled. Their conservatory is having trouble with a couple of Ginger Lilies. Apparently, they’re not as Muggle as they’d believed.”
things.”
The curious looks on Draco’s friends’ face morphed into something that resembled
Harry had laughed. “Happy birthday, you git.”
The truth of what they’re doing, of what they’re about to do. He blushes again, hides his face into the cushions, embarrassed by his own innocence. On top of him, Harry holds still, his lips against Draco’s shoulder, trying to control his breath. God, the feel of Harry’s body covering his is like a revelation. The pliant weight of him is like water to a man dying of thirst. Draco is suddenly glad for his years of chastity; suddenly glad Harry gets to be the first one in such a long time. The last person he got to touch like that was Astoria… he lets his mind rest on the thought for a second, wonders if she'd be happy for him, if she'd poke good-natured fun about Harry —
Luna’s face lit up. She clapped her hands together. “Oooh, how adorable! People are the funniest. It’s understandable, though. Neville and I met in the most romantic way.”
“Draco…” Penelope warns, without lifting her eyes from the forms she’s filing at her desk.
“How is Scorpius?”
Dear Drake (fine, I’ll play by your rules, you stubborn git),
Holding the fence, he walked clumsily to the skating rink gate. He hadn’t skated in a long time. His Sixth and Seventh Years hadn’t really afforded him this kind of lighthearted fun. There was a good chance he would make a fool of himself.
Harry cringes at the innuendo, but Draco gives his mother a benign smile.
“That’s… madness.”
Luna stared at him. Her eyes were unsettling. “Do they? Well. You asked how I felt about people looking up to me for being a war hero. I don’t...
“I know,” Draco whispers back.
Harry’s exploration of the Eldridge House leads him to a dimly-lit corridor that ends with a tall door made of beautifully carved wood. The door’s slightly ajar. It piques Harry’s curiosity: all the other exhibition rooms are wide open. He’s not sure if it means this one is private, but he sees no sign on the door that confirms it, so he pushes it open wider and steps in.
Last night was… Harry is at a loss for comparisons. He’s never had anything like it. He studies Draco’s calm, sleeping face as his eyes adjust to the darkness. They had honest-to-god made love until the fire had died in the hearth of Draco’s study. Until Harry had felt like he’d shown Draco all the overflowing desire he felt for him, and then reached within himself to find more. Yeah, he’d always find more. He doesn’t think he can ever reach the bottom of it. He sees it now: it’s been there since he was a teenager — dormant under layers of antagonism too intense for comfort.
A detail that wasn’t mentioned in the DMLE files.
Draco smelling like him.
We’re allowed to relax.”
Dear Drake,
“Luckily, we have plenty of material, see?” Draco picked one of his books and opened it at the page he was interested in, placing it in front of Harry.
Harry wants to yell at Draco, petulant and pointless.
“Is that what you’re playing?”
Draco leant over to get a closer look. He scrunched his nose up at the smell of brimstone. “Hagrid. I should have known.”
It’s not that simple. I did have a choice—a choice that would have estranged me from my entire family and put my life at risk, certainly, but a choice, nonetheless. The tragic reality of it is...I
Harry looked up into eyes which glittered like granite. He knew that look and his cock jumped to attention, stiffening within his jeans.
Draco’s scowl softens. “Hello, Greg. Take a seat.”
Harry stares at her, at a loss for words. He continues to stare long after the front door has opened and closed behind his friend.
Draco watches him, Harry’s words having seemingly stunned him into momentary silence. Then he makes to leave. “Maybe this has gone too far.”
Draco can’t blame him, even if he knows it’s far from the only one. Ernestina’s cooking is bloody phenomenal.
*~*~*
“I want you.” Harry’s rasp reverberated from his chest to Draco’s. “I want you—” he thrust his hips forward, and Draco fought not to let his eyes roll back at the heavenly friction. “God, Draco,” Harry growled, “I want you to fuck me. Now.”
“That’s hardly a fair competition,” Draco said. “You’re a professional Seeker. All you’ve done for the past ten years is train for this every day.”
“We’re clearly not in bed right now.”
Malfoy had accepted, much to his astonishment. Thank god Harry was wearing his shirt untucked. If he pulled it down a bit, nobody would notice the erection that threatened to pop the buttons of his jeans open.
He pointed his wand at the book and waved it in a slow, complex motion, holding still and visualising the thought he hadn’t quite dared forming until now: ‘This is what I’d like to be...’. The questionnaire on the page started filling itself, ticking the boxes that matched what Draco’s answers would have been. At the bottom of the page, a score of 98 percent appeared in dark green ink.  Draco lifted it up to admire his wand-work. He wasn’t surprised by the test’s result, even though it was comforting to have his intuition validated. Harry had moved close behind him, looking at the result over Draco’s shoulder.
“I never thought he was your type.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ve got to trust me, though. Both of you. I’ve seen him. He’s… no longer the person we used to know. He’s clever and funny and passionate about his job and a brilliant father for his little boy and he… God.” Harry gives his head a shake. Thinking of Draco is painful and bittersweet. “He’d probably kill me if he heard me say that, but he’s gone above and beyond to atone for the stupid, dangerous shit he did when he was a kid. Which is crazy, right? It’s
“I’m going to play some music now,” he murmured, too close to Draco for comfort. “It’s Muggle, and it’s brilliant. Not a word about my musical tastes. Understood, Malfoy?”
Their little group had gathered in the living room after dinner with cups of spiced mulled wine. His mother and Andromeda had taken the loveseat in front of the fire. Teddy had climbed on Draco’s lap and had promptly fallen asleep, much to Draco’s helpless astonishment.
Do we need to have that conversation again? There's no ‘on’ or ‘off’. It's not
He unbuttons the top buttons of his shirt as he walks to the wardrobe, and pulls it up and over his head, throwing it on the floor. He grabs a long-sleeved t-shirt and turns, bare skin exposed to the cool air and to Harry’s appalled gaze.
“Draco,” she growls. “You’re the only one having brilliant fun on the weekends these days.” She’s deeply involved in her task of taking various objects out of a box sitting on her desk; an old combat boot, a toy Firebolt (vintage, 1986 edition, Draco remembers it from his birthday that year), a tube of lipstick missing its cap, an autographed picture of a young Gilderoy Lockhart putting a stake through a vampire’s chest with a bright grin on his face. When she taps the items with her wand, they turn into pieces of parchment; certified Ministry forms that fly to meet their predecessors on Lavender Brown’s desk.
Good thing Draco had already set his glass on the table, or he would have dropped it at the sight of Potter. And that wasn’t the way he wanted his re-introduction to Potter to go. At all.
“Harry,” Kingsley interrupts with his deep, steady voice, “if Malfoy is involved in laundering Death Eater money or drug dealing on a massive scale, then
“Hush now,” interrupted Harry. “Put your hands out.”
The girls giggle behind their hands as a furious blush creeps up the side of Potter’s neck and he swallows helplessly. Draco glides out of the pose and turns to face him, arms crossing against his chest, fists pushing his biceps into a more prominent position, still smirking. Penelope is the only one with the presence of mind to put Potter out of his misery.
“I know. And you weren’t allowed to show us kindness, or your punishment would have been worse than
“Why?” he asked, relishing the Niffler’s anguished look immensely. That should teach the sneaky little beast to spy on his, er,
contacted me for the interview. I thought it was because of my work as a Magizoologist. It’s a line of work I would have fallen into no matter what, but the war just consolidated my aspirations. Voldemort’s despicable speciest ideology left so many creatures on the brink of extinction. So many natural habitats were destroyed in Britain. This is how I dealt with the aftermath of the war, Draco. I saw an opportunity to be useful before it was too late. I wanted to avoid ever having to say in the future, ‘Gather ‘round, little ones, and let me tell you how I grew up at a time when centaurs and dinosaurs were still populating the forests of the world.’”
Harry mutters a lubricating charm and slides his slick fingers along Draco’s crease, slathering lube between his cheeks, unmindful of the mess dripping down Draco’s thighs. Draco feels him move away from him a fraction of a second, then, without a warning, the tip of Harry’s cock is pressing into him. Harry puts his hand on the back of Draco’s neck and keeps him down, face against the glass desktop, almost mean. He doesn’t give Draco time to adjust to it: with a grunt, he slides all the way in. Draco cries out, squirms under Harry’s hands, but Harry doesn’t relent. Draco asked him to fuck him rough, and Harry’s nothing if not a man of his word. Harry starts thrusting in and out, groaning, already lost in it. His cock feels so fucking fat, taking Draco from behind with barely any preparation, and Draco starts pushing back onto Harry with needy little whines. It hurts, just a bit — but that’s what he’d asked for, wasn’t it? He closes his eyes, his cheek hot against the cool glass, Harry’s hands sliding to grip his hips tighter and move him up and down his cock. It’s dirty and raw and unlike any of the sex they’ve had before, and when Harry comes, Draco’s still so tight he can feel the heat of Harry’s come as his cock throbs, filling Draco’s arse with it. Harry’s thrusts slow down then, his fingers loosening their grasp on Draco’s hips. He rocks into Draco, once, twice, leans over his back, his hot breath caressing Draco’s sweaty nape. Just when Draco’s certain Harry is going to try to kiss him again, start whispering sweet, mindless confessions of love again, Harry stands and pulls out so fast Draco gasps.
It’s the only thing we should aspire to in life.”
“Mmh, stop it. I don’t think I have a drop of spunk left in me,” Malfoy pushed Harry’s hand away. Harry could hear the grin in his voice. “You wrung me out, Potter.”
“A project with you?” Harry's astounded.
Malfoy raised his eyes to meet his. His expression shifted with a lopsided little smile. “You’ve been on my celebrity to-do list for a long time, Potter,” he said. His eyes sparkled with humour and mischief, and when he saw Harry’s exasperated eye-roll, he laughed.
He put his hands on Harry’s shoulders and pushed him back lightly. Harry blinked at him in the semi-darkness of the room, as if brought back from a dream. His lips were wet and swollen. Draco wanted to scream with how much he wanted him.
“There's nothing for you to
“Not yet,” growled Malfoy, marching up to Harry. He grabbed him by the shirt, rammed him against the lockers, and crashed his mouth to Harry’s.
With furious caws, Charybd and Scylla took flight, a far less ominous pair than when they were both black, white-eyed ravens.
; and a few photographers from less reputable publications — some of which would delight in catching Harry disgrace himself tonight, one way or another. They’ve never bothered with respecting his private life in the past, have they?
Narcissa Malfoy who is
Harry grimaces. “I told him I was the best case scenario for his predicament?”
Harry’d managed to school his features into something that he hoped projected calm, casual confidence, although he felt sweaty-faced and guilty. Ron had appeared at the end of the aisle. He’d narrowed his eyes while he’d taken in Harry’s disheveled state. His clothes were rumpled, his shirt tails untucked, but his flies were done up, thank Merlin and Morgana. Yet Ron must have read something out of the ordinary in the scene: he’d watched Harry, lips pinched, a sure sign that ‘Senior Auror Weasley’ was mentally cataloguing the sight for future examination.
He touched his lips to the tip, feeling the silky skin and the wetness underneath the cotton, and Harry’s legs trembled.
“Yeah.” Harry leans in again. Draco can feel his erection through layers of clothing. It hasn’t wilted, and neither has Draco’s. His eyes want to roll back in his skull, but Harry takes his chin, turns his face, and whispers in his ear. “Confident. Dauntless. But — you know that, don’t you? You look like you’re daring the world not to
Harry laughed. “Getting sentimental on Christmas, Malfoy?”
“That’s true, but…” Draco closes his eyes, the next words leaving him in a rush. “It’s also thanks to them that you landed on my doorstep in the first place.”
5 o’clock is perfect. Looking forward to eating out.
she says, thoughtful, and Harry realises he never thought to ask.
Neither Draco nor Scorpius seem to be awake when Harry walks down the stairs, barefoot and dressed in clean jeans and a soft grey t-shirt. The house is quiet, the soft hush of early morning only disturbed by the chirping of blue tits in the garden and the distant clanks of pots and pans in the kitchen — Ernestina getting breakfast ready, no doubt. On the landing of the first floor, Balzac limps out of Scorpius’ room to meet him, tail wagging.
Luna blinked behind her goggles. “I’ve seen it before. My dad’s aura was all kinds of bonkers after my mum died. But it will come back,” she said confidently. “And then you two will look so pretty side by side with your auras matching.” She smiled at him. “I can’t wait.”
“Oh, really? Ickle Dwaco is unhappy with his mission? Whatever shall Mephisto say, should he find out?”
“No you haven’t, you absolute bastard,” Draco whines. His hands tighten in Harry’s hair, and just the hair pulling feels so fucking good Harry’s quivering with anticipation. And, by the feel of Draco’s trembling thighs under Harry’s hands, so is he. “Merlin fuck—” Draco squirms again, his cock giving a faint throb and leaking a drop of precome. “What’re you waiting for?”
“Draco hasn’t mentioned it until this afternoon,” Harry says.
“He said he was going to think about it.”
“You waits here, Mistor Potter,” she says, in a tone that makes it clear the favour she’s doing him isn’t for her benefit. “Ernestina is letting Mistor Draco know.”
How dare you.”
“This is real!” Harry shouts back. “This is as real as it fucking gets!”
“I’m sorry, Narci—erm, Mrs Malfoy. Hi.” Harry aims for the most normal, casual tone he can muster. “I didn’t know you were visiting.”
“I like you already, Harry,” she purrs.
Now it is all he can think about.
“Let me— let me show you,” he mumbles in Draco's hair. Draco arches into him with a whimper. Harry's hands are soft on his sides, his lips tender against the shell of his ear. Draco can feel his reverence. He understands the way Harry wishes they'd do it this time: slow, looking into Draco's eyes and stroking his hair as he comes. Like they've got all the time in the world.
Harry looked at Draco then, hurt, defiant.
So, yeah. No wonder he’s glowing.
“Come in,” he says.
“Is somebody there?” asks one of the guests. The voice sounds far away — they’re at the other end of the cloakroom. At least he doesn’t sound like a journalist, thank god.
Harry was watching him, worried and amused, his lifted eyebrows taunting Draco. He had his elbows on the fence of the skating rink. The rest of the Eighth Year group zoomed past him on the rink, bursts of laughter and the occasional helpless yelp reaching Draco before they moved further down the ice.
He folded his wings around him so briskly he scared Jeff the Niffler. With a squawk, the creature jumped out of his pocket and ran to hide in the dark undergrowth at the foot of the red oak tree. After a visible attempt to calm himself, Mephistopheles lifted his hands. “Fine.
Heat flares in Harry’s gut at the words. “What do
when you’re off teaching all week.”
He nearly jumped out of his skin when Longbottom burst into the kitchen from behind him.
“You did?” Malfoy asks his son. He sounds softer than Harry has ever heard him. “That’s brilliant, Scorpius.”
McGonagall surveyed them from above her square spectacles.
“I know.”
“Can you blame me?”
“I will,” Harry smiled.
He didn’t know he was demisexual, back then.
He half expects Malfoy to jump in fright. Half expects him to draw his wand and attack.
“Don’t you fucking dare call my son that word ever again, you miserable piece of shit,” Draco growls, paying no mind to the three Aurors pointing their wands at him.
“Ernestina—” Harry stops her. She’s turned her back on him and she doesn’t look.
“It’s done now. They won’t bother me again — until the next fiscal year, that is.” Draco grins. “I survived. We won!”
either! This is bigger than us. This is about talking to the public for the first time since the fucking war, Potter! This is about showing people like you, people who went through hell like you, survivors of
He’s as pale and strikingly blond as Harry remembers, but his hair now curls lightly around his ears and above his collar, more relaxed than the sleek style Harry had known him to favour at Hogwarts. He’s pointy and lanky but he’s obviously filled out in the last decade. He looks like a man, and no longer like the gaunt, desperate child Harry remembered from the last years of the war and the trials.
“That pushchair is a bloody feat of engineering,” he says.
You did the other night, when I was bending you over the bathroom sink and you—”
His gaze falls on Harry’s lips. Just like that, they’re close. So close, Harry can feel Malfoy’s breath on his face, can feel his chest brush Malfoy’s with every inhale. He leans in first — or maybe it’s Malfoy, it’s hard to tell, everything is starting to blur — and their lips hover over each other’s, not touching, not yet.
he was? Images of the skating rink flashed through Draco’s mind: Harry laughing happily, surrounded by his friends, Draco watching them with helpless envy as he sat alone.
“Sorry,” he tells her quickly. “I don’t doubt it. It’s just… most house-elves I’ve known didn’t share much with their masters.”
Harry pinned him with a weary gaze. “I’m not sure I do.”
end up getting hurt.”
Draco dropped his hand. “It's... not what you think.”
To answer your question, if you did spend more time in the kitchen with me, you'd know.
Draco fought the impulse to cast a
“Get back down here and fuck me,” he croaked. “Right now.”
Harry threw his head back, clawing at Malfoy’s back. Malfoy’s thick cock was slowly sliding inside, breaching Harry with shallow little thrusts that barely left time for him to adjust to the girth of it—
“HahaHA!!” yelled Jeff, pointing at her. “Take THAT, you sightless fiend! Don’t look so scary now huh, FLUFFY?!”
they’d fallen on Harry’s Gryffindor-levels-of-stubborn ears. “Two years we lost because of your
“What do you want?” Draco says, a raw note in his voice.
Draco cast a spell on his right hand, the one with one finger currently engaged in fucking Harry’s hole. The sparks of magic skittered against Harry’s rim, and he felt Draco’s finger slick with conjured lube on the next movement upward. The sensation made him moan and writhe wantonly.
Harry walks to the bed, sits near Draco, just within reach. He doesn’t touch him, just lets him get used to his presence, to the sound of his breathing. Then he says, carefully, “You could have told me.”
“My sex life is private,” he purrs, and his colleagues burst into laughter.
Both Kingsley and Ron look pointedly at Harry, who feels the colour rising on his cheeks.
Malfoy surveys him a moment longer, very still if for the fingers of his right hand, clenching against the fabric of his trousers.
“What are you humming?” she said, and he jumped. Clutching the nearest shelf to catch his breath, he groaned.
Harry rose to his feet. “Exactly.”
Startled, he asks, “Explain what?”
—because we both thought we’d never have this again, and now we do.”
“In your dreams,” he muttered. He wasn’t sure Potter had heard him, but it was for the best. Even he was disappointed by the weakness of his comeback.
“Charming as ever,” Ron rolled his eyes but plopped himself on the chair next to Draco. “You’re a bloody ray of sunshine. To think Harry chose
Harry doesn’t know the first thing about ‘the arts.’ He hadn’t been given the opportunity to learn, had he? The Dursleys’ idea of culture had been the opening credits of ‘Big Break.’ Growing up, Dudley’d had a Walkman and hundreds of cassettes, but Harry hadn’t been allowed to so much as look at them. Hogwarts hadn’t offered art classes, unless you counted Professor Trelawney’s Divination classes as an art form. And anyway, Harry had been too busy thwarting a murderous madman to worry about his lack of education in that area. Maybe that’s why Hermione had thought The Royal Opera House was a good cause to champion. She’d always had Harry’s best interests in mind, and she’d told him the ballet was a good place to start cultivating a more sophisticated mind. Ballets had stories, music, and — Hermione had added that last detail with a wink that had made Harry cringe — nice-looking ladies in tights.
It was also, reportedly, the first time these four had ever agreed on anything. It might have been the reason why McGonagall had given in, more so than their stubbornness. What better example of House unity was there than two former Gryffindors and two former Slytherins organizing a sit-in to get something they all wanted?
Draco clenches his fists as he reaches the second floor, practically marching inside his bedroom. He takes a long, deep breath. He hears Harry’s footsteps behind him, stopping on the threshold.
It’s a simple acknowledgment. For a moment, silence surrounds them, only disturbed by the crackle of the fire and the birds chirping in the garden outside. The atmosphere shifts to something different, and Harry struggles to maintain eye contact with Malfoy.
Draco falls into step with Harry when Scorpius breaks into a run to go see the ducks, followed by Balzac limping by his side. They walk to the pond in companionable silence.
“No,” Luna shook her head, wistful. “Sadly, to this day, I haven’t been able to

“In a hurry, Potter?” he asked. Harry didn’t need to see his face to picture the gloating expression of it. It was all in his tone.
his roommates would joke.) Anthony Goldstein was curled under his usual three blankets and five Warming Charms because he was always cold
Penelope took in all those kids, and then she made them find magical objects that had been lost — one-eyed teddy bears, handkerchiefs still holding their late grandmother’s perfume like a memory locked in a Pensieve, cracked Remembralls, taxidermied Egyptian cacti — and trained them to find the owners of those little treasures all over again.
When he saw Draco, his expression changed from melancholy to bright.
is what makes Draco blush.
Harry’s hand slid across the small space between their bodies on the sofa. It came to rest an inch from Draco’s, lying on the cushion at his side. His hand stayed there. Draco looked at Harry and broke the silence.
Harry’d thought bitterly. He’d knelt near Scorpius, Balzac whining quietly on Scorpius’ other side, and checked his vitals as a precaution. He might not have to go to the hospital this time…
Head Auror Smith closed the file and rested her hand on the red cardboard cover. The air was heavy with finality. Harry squirmed in his chair. Next to him, he could feel waves of restlessness emanating from Malfoy. Malfoy’s hand was clenched around his knee to stop his leg from jiggling.
“Draco…”
You make it sound like I was brainwashed. That wasn’t my impression, at the time.
“Right now we’re considering several leads,” Ron chimes in, and Harry struggles to keep his expression neutral despite his growing wariness. “Old Death Eater ties, obviously. Dark artefacts contraband. Illegal potions and drugs. Money laundering, possibly.”
“Oh, Harry...” Hermione holds her own face, staring at Harry in disbelief.
The grand ballroom of the Wizarding Chamber of Commerce shines bright tonight. As bright as the rows of diamonds glittering around the necks of the pretentious old bags waltzing around with their richly-dressed — and equally old — husbands. Well, not all of them are old: here and there, Harry can spot younger, perkier replacements, rivers of pearls gleaming across bouncy cleavages that leave little to the imagination. Among the crowd of benefactors, Harry spots a few journalists here and there. The page six columnist of the
“You’re the one who doesn’t want to get caught!” Harry hisses, unsure if they’re talking about stealing or about surprise blowjobs between old nemeses. By the amused look on Malfoy’s face, he’s heard the double-entendre too.
— Ron’s words, not Harry’s — but that’s ridiculous. Harry’s learned his lesson, and Malfoy is nothing to
“Alright!” Jeff said and folded his paws over his chest. “Do you have—
Lucifer, could someone remind him why he had agreed to this?
So he said, unthinking:
Tamara stretched her forelegs forward and extended her wings. Her eyes blinked open to reveal shiny onyx irises and she stared straight at Draco as she lifted herself onto four legs with a clinking noise.
Harry suddenly knew what he wanted out of this overrated evening. Knew what, maybe, he’d been chasing all the nights he’d pulled strangers in clubs and groupies on bleachers and fans on autograph tours. He’d been looking for someone who would make him feel that lightening bolt of attraction.
Harry pushed himself deeper. He pressed his forehead against Malfoy’s nape as he thrust inside, inch by inch, the feel of Malfoy’s arse enclosing him almost enough to make him come right there.
Draco held his breath.
“Goodbye, Draco,” Greg says, and leaning forward with surprising agility for someone his size, he envelops Draco into a rib-cracking hug. Draco smiles against Greg’s shirt and pats his back. Then Greg lets him go, slightly awkward after this rare display of affection, and Draco laughs. He snaps his fingers and his house-elf, Ernestina, appears with a pop.
Sitting at the bar next to Harry, Ron does what he always does when Harry’s having a moan: he pushes the whisky tumbler towards Harry with a tired index finger. The glass squeaks across the polished wood of the bar, comes to a quivering stop in front of Harry. Harry takes a long, drawn-out sip. He wipes the back of his hand across his mouth and lifts an eyebrow at Ron.
“Is that why you invented the Prothimioscope?”
And Malfoy had left again anyway.
“You fucking tease, Potter. Is that why you followed me around? Showing up at my interviews? Is that how badly you want me to fuck you?”
“You don’t have to look so disparaging,” Harry laughed softly next to him. “He has his quirks. Doesn’t mean he’s a bad teacher.”
“Yeah.” Harry rubs his hair. It now looks even messier than before. “I mean… I knew that you had…
“Yes. Yes.”
He and Malfoy both go still.
innocent, Malfoy.”
“Harry… I think it was personal before you even started on the case.”
“Daddy!” Harry hears a child’s voice cry from the foyer.
And Harry’s mind is unhelpfully blank.
“I was too shy.”
Harry fights the slow smile that threatens to spread on his face. Oh, this is going to be easy. So easy. Verbal sparring with Malfoy is like riding a broom — you never forget how to fly, no matter how long you’ve gone without it.
“For what it’s worth, I don’t know what they’re talking about, mate,” Ron announces, shrugging.
“Fine. I’ll try not to be so… sensitive. About the topic. Around you. But you —” Malfoy lifts his chin, and it’s like he’s marching on Harry without moving from his spot, "—you’re going to have to watch what you say… the things you say about me. About Scorpius.”
“You’re not — a
Without a word, Draco lifted his hands to Harry’s flies and undid the button and zip, pulling his jeans down around his knees. Harry’s cock was already hard and leaking, a wet patch forming on the dark fabric of his tented boxers. Draco licked his lips and looked up.
As if impressed by Harry’s deduction, Malfoy grins wider. His white teeth gleam, and Harry feels an involuntary thrill zinging up his spine.
Draco walks up to the Aurors, who take his wand and cast a binding spell on his wrists while Harry watches, powerless and horrified. Auror Boyle flicks her wand at Zacharias Smith’s unconscious form and mutters,
“What are you doing?” Harry whispers, a broken sound.

Harry had let go of him with a satisfied little smile.
Harry debates it for a second, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth.
“Nooooo,” Scorpius had breathed, a long, hissing exhale, and started rocking back and forth.
“Alright?” squawked Draco.
“I can’t go out on a limb for ‘I don’t think’.”
Jeff cast him a beseeching look, made even more convincing by his powerless position, dangling from Luna Lovegood’s hands.
To think he’d convinced himself that Lovegood’s interview was going to be the easy one...
“And you, in turn, could stop second-guessing my every word. For the sake of our collaboration. We’re on the same team, after all.”
The parchment.

But this is Malfoy. He’s never been on a case against a former classmate.
Not yet.
He only knows he wants to steal something from Malfoy in return.
“No? It's pure coincidence that you and Potter went missing for the same length of time yesterday, and that I found you in the Library muttering Muggle love songs today?”
But this is just a job. Harry lets out a quiet, rueful snort.
“Was it?!”
Harry shrugs. “He listens to me, too.”
Harry rolls over, debating whether he should get up and leave Draco’s room. He mutters a quiet
Thank you so much to everyone who's read, kudo'd and commented so far. You brighten every one of my December days!
“They know what you did for me last spring, Draco. What you did for me and Ron and Hermione. Even if we weren’t together... there’s no way they’d hate you after that. We wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you.”
Not a group outing with a bunch of ex-Gryffindors, most of whom seemed to only tolerate Draco thanks to his recent friendship with Harry.
“I highly doubt anyone in their right mind would dare make a bad recommendation about bloody
“It’s not the first time they’ve seen each other since the summer,” Harry shrugged.
He’s not supposed to have slowly become Harry’s friend. He’s not supposed to be someone Harry is starting to have feelings for, he who hasn’t felt that way for anyone in years.
Ginny wrapped her arm around her girlfriend’s shoulders and kissed her cheek. “Do we really need another pet, Luna? Especially one that will go through our drawers for shiny new things every once in a while?”
“Then why are you doing what you do?” he asks, hand over his mouth.
“I’m not something to
“A notable benefit. But...it’s a shame. It would have been quite an unforgettable interview.”

At the age of twenty-four, he had married a certain Astoria Greengrass, a witch a couple of years his junior whom he had met while they both lived in Paris. The young couple had moved to London two years later, when Malfoy was starting his company and Astoria was six months pregnant with their first child. They’d moved to a mainly Muggle neighbourhood, in the Sloane Square townhouse that Harry had seen in the pictures that the Minister had showed him.
Then he located the source of the earthy smell.
“Thank you for confirming you don’t have any,” Ron pulled her close and kissed her cheek. Hermione giggled and pushed him off.
He must obey, though. He couldn’t refuse a direct order from the Hereafter, not when it came from the Boss himself. He couldn’t

So easily, so naturally. Like gravity’s suddenly too strong to resist, too strong to fight.

They were being too loud. Around the table, Greg, Blaise and Theo threw them quizzical looks. Even Harry and his friends glanced at them briefly. The red-haired Weasley girl murmured something in her brother’s ear. Harry’s green eyes lingered on Draco’s for a second longer than the rest of them. Draco’s stomach resumed its acrobatics.
Harry met his heated gaze with a triumphant smile. “The first time.”
Don’t get too cocky, Potter.
Harry watches her for a moment, mind whirring. She’s a free elf; she seems to think the enslavement of elves is a preposterous idea; her delightfully melodic accent reminds Harry that he still doesn’t know much about her.
No offense, but
The days following Draco’s emergency visit to the Thickey Ward have sludged by in a listless, bitter sort of stupor.
“You know me so well. I do live for hot men complimenting me,” Draco says, aiming for dry wit when he’s all but holding on to the door for dear life.
Malfoy lifts an eyebrow at Harry's barb. “Touché. Clearly all I do around the rich and famous these days is steal from them.” Malfoy’s eyes drop to Harry’s crotch. Harry swallows hard. “And suck their dicks on occasion.”
“This Ravenclaw isn’t going to contradict you,” Luna smiled.
“You just got to admit, you didn’t expect this event to intermingle so many different people, did you? You had a good chat with—”
“Shut it, Potter, or I’m taking my offer for friendship back.”
“For God’s sake, Malfoy, will you listen? That wasn’t what I meant. I was — I am just. Baffled. Moved. I wasn’t expecting this and… and your son is really something, isn’t he? Taking his piano skills into consideration or not. You’re going to have to stop being so on edge, and actually listen to what I’m saying before you jump down my throat.”
“I’m looking forward to it,” Harry said. He had the same defiant tilt to his head, the same half-smile. His eyes were still sad, but they often were these days. “And I thought I insisted on you calling me Harry.”
“You’ve met him, haven’t you?" Harry asks. "He’s audited Caduceus’ accounts for years without finding a breach. He’s certain that you’re a fraud. He’s made it his mission to expose you. The Aurors tell me he’s never recovered from what he thinks is a personal failure.”
“What the Heavens are you doing here?!” Draco hissed, horrified to be found in this position by Mephisto’s pet. He patted the covers for his wand and hastily cast a few Silencing charms around his bed.
did not come easily in a casual context.
What he’d been programmed to do.
Harry lifted the plate. “Do you want one?”
“A right friend you are. A friend that’s being paid to be my friend.”
The rosy glow of late afternoon is turning Draco’s face softer. It’s almost dusk — Harry didn’t notice the sun starting to set over the line of the buildings beyond his window. The sky is fading to a pale red, Draco is offering him something in this response — a yearning for trust, an admission of some sort — and Harry suddenly feels so relieved he could choke. He considers his answer for a moment.
I never do anything if not wholeheartedly.
Murmuring softly, Draco stepped toward Harry as the lights dimmed. The soft glow of the fairy lights strung around the bedroom twinkled in Harry's eyes and the highlights in Draco's hair gleamed as they embraced again.
PS: Harry says ‘suck it,’ but you know I’d never.
Ignoring the twisting feeling in his gut that wasn’t only fear and adrenaline, he ran faster, hand in hand with Malfoy.
Instead of pumping Harry’s cock erect, he went around Harry’s arse and felt between his cheeks with two fingers. He found his hole on the first try and pushed inside without so much as a warning.
“No,” Draco admitted. “As long as he doesn’t disturb the interview. Think you can do that, Potter?” he called over his shoulder.
The wooden stairs of the back porch creaked under his feet. At the sound, Harry turned.
to improve your level of commitment to the Cause,” Mephistopheles continued, raising his voice, “they’re going to crack down on you and it won’t be pretty.”
“Look…” Harry starts, wanting to avoid Narcissa’s eyes and unable to do so. “It’s not… what you think.”

“Really? I don’t think there’s been one day when you haven’t complained about them and threatened to hex their bollocks to their nostrils.”
He wished he could
“Oh, bugger,” Ron whispers. “It’s the Harrows — current Directors of the Board of Hogwarts. Merlin, I’ve got to be on my best behaviour. But there’s still time for you to run.” He hands Harry his glass of wine.

“He’s incredibly nice and clever and he knows what he wants in life.
“We’re not the same size, Draco,” Harry says. Something in his tone rankles. It’s soft, placating, like he’s talking to an unreasonable, unstable child. Draco wants to wipe that sanctimonious expression from Harry’s face.
And then his breath hitches.
Mrs Weasley greeted Draco and Harry with pink cheeks and chocolate sauce splattered across her forehead.
“Spells fired in legitimate defense!” Draco bursts, and at the sound of his father’s voice, Scorpius whines louder, thrashes under Harry’s grip.
Draco,
Draco nodded jerkily, ignoring the titters coming from his friends. He appreciated them, he truly did, more than he’d ever appreciated humans in the past, but... perhaps in his next life he’d try to pick friends who were actually

“Harry...” Draco deflated, dismay slowly seeping into his chest, weighing down his limbs. “You
“What is it?” Harry smiles at him. “You want me to get you a rasher of bacon from the kitchen, is that it?” The dog lets out a soft woof, lifting his ears. Harry laughs, hand on the dining room door handle. “All right, let me see if Ernestina would be okay with it.”
Calling Potter ‘Potter’ had always come naturally to him. In his youth, he used to spit it out like an insult; he used it to keep a distance, consciously at least. His unconscious had other ideas, and had started teasing him about it when puberty hit around third year. He’d had the misfortune to confess his inconvenient wanking fantasies to Pansy the year after, following which he had to suffer her knowing eyes every time she heard him spitefully mention Potter.
“If you’re talking about
“Boyfriends would be the most accurate term, yes,” Draco conceded. The word still stung, and he chastised himself.
He smirks, and the girls burst into another round of delighted giggles. He gestures for them to come closer. “Gather ‘round and watch, my charm-challenged, flirt-incompetent friends. Welcome to Draco Malfoy’s Stupendous Seduction Seminar. This is something you can practice safely at home, in the office, at the pub. It can look absolutely innocuous or ragingly seductive depending on how interested the targeted party is. That way, if the trick fails, the object of your lust is none the wiser and you haven’t made fools of yourself. But if it works…” He realises his colleagues have actually all stood and gathered around him, and he waggles his eyebrows to stress his point.
He’d called it

So he tries to keep his eyes open.
“Lovesick—”
Draco was the worst demon in the world.
“No. You’ve said it: a mistake. It was a mistake. I know that it is, you know that it is, the people who care about you know that it is. Fuck everyone else.”
“Hi,” he mumbled. “Sorry, didn’t hear you.”
“When have I ever made you feel like I wasn’t?”
Without answering Harry, Scorpius turns on his heels and heads towards the corridor on the right. Balzac leaps to his feet and runs after him with a soft whine.
“Hello, Harry,” the boy tells him, not meeting his eyes.
“It’s… a keepsake,” Harry says. “Give it back someday. Please.”
“Please don’t flatter yourself, Malfoy,” he muttered.
“Mistor?” she asks, and it could be about anything if not for her shrewd eyes on Harry.
They might not know I’ve an open invitation to all of the Holyhead Harpies matches—courtesy of my friend Blaise’s beautiful fiancée. They also might not know that I’m a rather good pastry chef.
Draco had taken the bag, turned it around in his hands. “It’s from
Draco gives him a look like he’s as thick as it gets. “Despite what your dear Ministry says, Harry, not much has changed for house-elves in our country since the war. Ernestina is still an exception — she’s an employee, not a… a
according to some people who call themselves my friends, and your loneliness shines like a fucking beacon. You and I are perfectly suited for this, aren’t we?” He pulled back a second, releasing his grip on their cocks. “How much more nicely do you want me to ask you?”
“Anything!” Jeff squeaked eagerly before clapping his paws on his mouth. He attempted a more casual pose then. This didn’t fool Draco. “I mean—I don’t really care anymore, but I’ll listen to your pathetic propo—”
He pushes himself up from his chair before he does or says anything stupid — or worse, sentimental.
“Harry—”
Unsurprisingly, despite Draco’s instructions, Ernestina positively cooked a feast. The table is sagging under delicious-smelling dishes. Harry spots some of his favourite English classics, but a few plates sport continental influences — French, Spanish, possibly Italian. There’s a tray of cheeses that’s larger than Harry’s coffee table at Grimmauld Place. His mouth waters.
“Umpff, Harry—” Draco gasped, then Harry’s lips were on his, hungry and purposeful, claiming his mouth, swallowing Draco’s moans. Draco let himself melt into Harry’s embrace. He let himself be kissed, opening his mouth at the first touch of Harry’s tongue on his bottom lip. The edge of the countertop dug into the small of his back, but he barely felt it. Harry’s soft, wet tongue was in his mouth, and suddenly it was like someone had set Draco’s blood on fire. Want rushed through him, a wave of lust so powerful his knees almost buckled, and then he was kissing Harry back. Hands in Harry’s hair, he pulled him closer and kissed him, his tongue caressing Harry’s with a slow, teasing intent that was at odds with the way his entire body screamed,
Meanwhile, Malfoy’s company had developed several other medical potions.
“Mmh,” Draco murmured, rubbing his cheek against Harry’s erection. Lucifer, this felt so good; if Draco wasn’t so focused on his goal, he could have come in his pants just from the feel of it, the smell of it, musky and masculine and
“You didn’t?”
In the middle of the room stands a small, olive-skinned house-elf with long floppy ears and huge, inquisitive brown eyes. She’s dressed in actual clothes, not the tea towel or pillowcase house-elves usually wear. Her short-sleeved blouse and pale pink trousers are clean and meticulously pressed. Harry locks eyes with her and she stares at him for a second, an inscrutable expression on her face, her gaze flicking up and down the dark grey Muggle coat he’s wearing over a black suit and burgundy turtleneck jumper.
Harry had held himself over him, sliding his erection between Draco’s arsecheeks until Draco was trembling, grasping at his neck and asking —
Instead, Ron holds out his hand to Hermione and wiggles his fingers.
Ernestina is already busy with her next task, which apparently involves brewing several tins of tea in litres of boiling water.
Because that was what Harry had always done.
“I… wasn’t much of a gentleman in the last few minutes,” Harry says, feeling a fierce blush on his cheeks at the very fresh memory.
A test.
“Alright,” Granger said noncommittally. “What do you need my help with?”
Harry retorts.
I’m not some role model to be put on a pedestal or coddled just because I’ve lived through a war.
There’s no coherent thought in Harry’s mind anymore. Only one word, spinning in vain.
lost track of time!” Draco had protested.
“Put your hands out. So you can hold her. Remember what I said about her nipping though. Just tell her no, firmly.”
“Hullo, Malfoy,” Neville said with a cordial nod and put down the crate he was carrying.
Harry clasps a hand to his mouth before a snorts escapes. He’s fairly certain a seven-year-old Scorpius would object to being called a '
Harry bristles for a second, taken aback by the force of the protectiveness he feels for Scorpius. Ron doesn’t know Scorpius, he reminds himself. He still thinks of Draco as the boy they knew at Hogwarts — not the most positive image one could have of him.
A few days later, Harry Apparates to a Sloane Square alleyway two streets away from Malfoy’s house.
Hermione and Ron linger in the foyer, Hermione taking an inordinately long time to put her jacket on. When she’s done, she nudges Ron. He starts as if he’d forgotten, and throws an abashed glance at Harry.
“Not bad, Malfoy,” he mutters under his breath, an echo to Harry’s first thought, months ago.
“Oh!” Harry said. Pulling out his wand, he hurriedly cast a
Instead… instead, if this is all he’s ever going to get, he’ll take it. For as long as it lasts.
Every single one of Draco’s words is like a blow to the face, and Harry wants to shake him. “I know. I know you don’t need me. But walking away from you now would be as good as giving up, when I know that the Ministry is waiting for the slightest hint I could drop to justify an investigation.”
“How’s your shoulder?”
Draco felt Harry squirm on his seat.
Because that’s another catch, isn’t it? Ron and Hermione might stop speaking to him altogether if he tells them he’d hooked up with the person who’d spent his school years bullying them. Harry might have come to terms with it; might have seen Malfoy in another light. He might have seen the man who’d been forced into a life he had no choice over, and who regretted his actions dearly. But his friends don’t know all that. To Hermione, Malfoy is nothing but the boy who’d been relentlessly mean to her at school. To Ron, he’s the kind of pureblood git the Weasley family despises, in addition to a low-life thief the Aurors still haven't managed to catch.
“Same to you, Potter,” Malfoy says. “You look like a fucking
Ernestina still stares, her unsettling eyes fixed on him. If only she would
“Yes. I noticed Neville right away. He was so passionate about Herbology, it was impossible not to be drawn to him.”
“That’s not what it is.” Malfoy’s eyes are fixed on him, equally predator and prey. “Why are you so cross? I didn’t steal anything from you.”
“What would you do if you didn’t have to steal?” he asks.
Draco stilled, frozen to the spot. Had he—
Harry returns the Mediwitch’s silent question as she gathers the pieces of gauze and empty vials of potions on a silver tray, ready to let Harry get some rest. He’s already had a long visit from his friends and family today. The Healers usually don’t knock and wait. “Come in,” he says out loud, and stops short when he sees Draco walk in.
Malfoy was
When Harry had been...
Harry shuffles off to Draco’s desk. After what they just did —  after having Draco pinned under him against the door, after almost unhinging that door with the force of their — er… Eagerness? Yeah,
He runs until he’s sure running away is vain.
Harry
Potter lowers his eyes. It’s a relief — his stare feels like a burn on Draco’s skin. “Nothing. Whatever you like. You asked me what bothered me and… I was honest. You’ve always felt… inevitable. To me. And now I— I finally understand why.”
For no good reason, Draco couldn’t meet Harry’s eyes. “Fine.”
“Indeed,” Draco says. His smile grows wider.
Harry watches him move away, the toned lines of his back and arse shifting under his tight running clothes. If Draco was a stranger whom Harry ran into while on his daily jog…
“We’ll find something. For the both of us. Okay?” Harry ran his hand through his hair before pointing at the books in Draco's lap. “Anything interesting in there?”
Nestled inside Draco’s left forearm. Faded black and gnarled. A shock of ugliness, branded on Draco’s otherwise spotless skin.
“You okay there?” Ron had burst the bubble of stricken silence after a long, uncomfortable pause.
He needs to get a grip. He’s been on the case for almost two months now. He keeps telling himself he’s taking his time, weaving his web, letting Draco feel comfortable around him until he lets something — anything — slip.
Had Malfoy… no choice but to steal? But Malfoy is old money, has always been old money. And old money doesn’t run dry… does it? Harry realizes he’s never given much thought to what had become of Malfoy after the trials. His father had been sent to Azkaban. His mother had been sentenced to five years of house arrest. And Malfoy… Malfoy had slipped through the net thanks to him being a minor at the time of the events. Thanks to him never committing evil acts of his own volition. Thanks to Harry, who’d testified for him in front of the Wizengamot.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. He gazed at Draco, fond and bashful. “Do you—does it bother you? That we fucked here, after your work was done?”
A light blush creeps up Malfoy’s neck at Harry’s words. If it wasn’t Malfoy, it would be charming.
It no longer feels like a revelation.
“You know I’m right!” Harry laughed behind him, and he heard his footsteps as he followed Draco across the bridge.
“Believe me when I say, that piece of information escaped my notice.”
So he lets Harry take the lead. And Harry rams against him once, twice more and stills with a cry. Draco feels the warmth and wetness through his jeans. Whispers, “Fuck, Harry, that was hot—”
Malfoy,
“Really?” Her eyes were shining excitedly. Harry had warned Draco that Granger was the kind of person who could never turn down a problem to solve. Clearly, he had been right. “It is Professor Vector’s homework? Because I solved the triple equation problem two days ago and I could show you—oh, Draco, you’ll see, it’s simple once you understand how it works—”
“And you?”
The grey light of dawn is filtering through the curtains now. Harry’s senses are still full of Draco — the taste of Draco’s skin, his lips, his sweat, the inside of his thighs, the long length of his cock, lingering on his tongue. He’d been careful with Draco last night like he hadn’t been with a lover since his first times with Ginny, and later, the first time he’d had sex with a man. There was something about this particular first time, about what Draco had revealed to Harry a few weeks before, that made Harry want to commit his every touch, his every move to memory. Draco had felt exquisitely vulnerable last night, open and trusting in a way Harry would have never expected from him if he didn’t know him so well already.
to look at him to know. His cock was thickening by the minute. Draco crossed his legs and strategically placed his hands over his lap.
“You should have seen your face.”
“Malfoy. You know just as well as I do that it’s not. You said it yourself when we entered this cabin: there’s something wrong with it. The anti-Apparition wards. The magic-muffling spells.” He gave him a significant look. “This isn’t a normal mountain refuge.”
That Draco said he’d teach him.
are Harry Potter. You could do almost anything. Isn’t it exciting? Look.”
“I think we are,” Draco tells him. Worry suddenly gnaws at the back of his mind. “Do you… not want to?”
He’d run into Pansy in the kitchen the next morning, his t-shirt rumpled, his hair a mess, his chin and cheeks pink with a tell-tale stubble burn. With a playful, knowing smirk, she’d teased him about ‘finally getting a leg over Potter’. Embarrassed and laughing, he’d waved her off.
“I still can’t quite believe it sometimes, but you are,” Harry smiled. “You can move, you know. He’s not going to wake up. Babies do tend to sleep like babies.”
Of course she is. She’s his mother, isn’t she?
Especially if it’s baked by Ernestina.
“I’m the one who makes you feel this,” he wondered almost to himself.
They grip at each other, pushing each other in the small space of the cupboard, groaning and grinning like school kids. Until Harry’s back hits the door with a dull
Harry’s taken aback. “I don’t know what it is… I don’t know if I can.”
Harry gets Draco naked and pressed down into the sofa cushions and Draco barely notices how it happens. Harry buries his head in Draco’s neck, trailing slow kisses, biting, licking. Everything about it is slow, attentive, like Harry is listening, waiting for Draco’s cues to continue or stop. Draco is so entranced with the thought of Harry — impulsive, headstrong Harry — holding back for his sake, that he forgets about everything else. When the hard length of Harry’s cock slides against his thigh, hot and maddening, Draco’s breath catches. Oh, yes, he’d forgotten… about
“Mistor Greg used to have breakfast with us, Mistor Potter,” she muses.
“I do attract them like Doxies to an old, musty curtain.”
“I told you the truth about me — I’m the spy. I’m only supposed to find information. I’m not the instigator — I’m the Trojan horse.”
“Hmm.” Thoughtful, she tapped a leaf with the tip of her nail. The plant crawled up and wrapped itself around her finger. She smiled, a sad softness to her expression. “‘War survivor’. It’s all in the label, isn’t it? Being constantly labeled ‘survivor’...it permeates everything. Every conversation, every gesture, every new relationship you make. It gave me a certain amount of power, it’s true. People leave me alone, most of the time. I can devote myself to my research. I can be quiet. I can not talk to people for days.
“I always forget about the bloody smog,” he said, wiping his eyes with the back of his gloved hand. “We could have Flooed.”
“I’m making tea for everyone.”
“Fucking warn a bloke?” Harry says, a bit petulantly.
“Harry,” Hermione intervenes, hand on his arm. They’re standing in the middle of the corridor leading to Draco’s study. Harry can hear warm voices, laughter and piano notes escaping from behind the door. “Don’t you know? We can’t do anything here that the house would consider ill-intentioned.” At Harry’s and Ron’s blank looks, she rolls her eyes. “It’s standard house magic! It’s such fascinating magical theory, I can’t believe you never knew that!”
Draco lets go.
Harry wasn’t dating Ginny Weasley anymore.
“The house has four stories,” Malfoy starts telling him in that drawling, posh voice of his. He seems more at ease now that he has control over the subject. “The ground floor, with access to the street on the east side and a private garden on the west side. The garden is protected by Muggle and magic anti-trespassing equipment both. We’ve never had any issue with it.”
“Oh.”
There  were days, though, when Draco was utterly bored of being a Hogwarts student. He didn’t know why the bosses insisted on putting him on wizarding school assignments over and over again. It was true that over time, he’d come to specialise in minor acts of bullying. Whether it was personal preference or force of habit wasn’t clear anymore. He’d lost track of the career path that led him here.
she'd said.
“Write?” Ron asked.
Harry doesn’t envy Kingsley’s job. He’s perfectly content with his own occupation: the fieldwork, the planning, the wait before a big strike. He enjoys his independence, and he enjoys occasionally working with Ron’s team of Aurors and Hermione’s army of Unspeakables.
Draco knew his face was probably redder than a Howler at this point, so he gave up trying to hide. He dropped his hands in his lap with a sigh.
“I wanted to learn more about you.”
Harry
Oh, god. Stop giving me that look. Now who’s being inappropriate?
“Alright.” Malfoy straightens up and nods to Harry. “I’ll be right back.”
Mephisto,” Draco said. To his immeasurable pleasure, the demon turned redder.
He remembered going back to the Tower, in the first days back at Hogwarts. There was a railing now, linking two sections of the ramparts circling the Tower. Between them, the fallen stones left a vertiginous gap, one that seemed to call Draco as much as it repelled him. He remembered taking a step back, the gaping abyss drawing him in, calling at him. A fall wouldn’t kill him, but it would sure raise a few questions from Madam Pomfrey. Worse: upset his mother. He had walked back to the safety of the wall before running down the stairs.
Harry dropped his hand and cupped Draco’s erection through his trousers.
-Harry
Harry looked left and right before leaning forward, face close to Ron’s.
A sick, delighted thrill zings down Harry’s spine.
“Harry…” Draco tells him, lifting his hand to his lover’s black curls, twining his fingers in it, relishing the fact that he can. “Even waiting for you was bloody fantastic.”
“You like me, I like you. Why do we need to make such a big deal out of it? Have you not been with a man before—
Draco's face dropped. “This bodes extremely badly. Last time you introduced me to something unexpected I had a rash on my genitals for weeks.”
“Anyway,” Harry clears his throat. “Can you please behave tonight? It would mean a lot.”
(See the end of the chapter for
but he could half-arse it, like he had half-arsed all of his assignments in recent years. In fact, in addition to bullying, Draco could have added another prideful line on his demonic

“It’s the first Christmas, though.”
“I went looking for information.”

off?”
“Yes, but Ernestina is not most house-elves, Mistor Potter. Ernestina is a free elf, sir,” she announces, straightening her back. Harry’s heart sinks. The words have a painful echo to them.
“Do you need to remind me that you wouldn’t do anything specifically for me?”
Three months later, their son Scorpius had been born, and Astoria had died in childbirth.
“Harry is staying,” Draco tells her, climbing up the steps.
Harry’s eyes flashed.
“I needed a job, and this is my line of work.” Harry shrugs.
Harry wakes up just before sunrise in an unfamiliar bed that still feels strangely safe. In the dark, he can make out the shape of the man sleeping quietly by his side, curled under the sheets, facing Harry in an unconscious display of trust.
Watches as Malfoy’s pupils dilate in understanding. Watches Malfoy’s pale eyebrow lift in a smirking question.
To no one’s surprise but his, Harry was contacted almost immediately after owling his CV to the address indicated in the job listing.
Hi Draco,
“I think you’re doing a pretty good job of it,” he tells him. “Being real. Being a father.” He’s not even lying, and he doesn’t know where the impulse came from.
“Fine.” Harry walks to Draco’s door, puts his hand on the handle. Hesitates. “Can I go in? I need to…”
Fine. You win. By the by, will
I think I could handle it.”
“Oh, if the press were to find out,” Malfoy murmurs. That should stop Harry, but there’s no bite to Malfoy’s words, no malice. Only truth, and a weak tremor that makes Harry close the gap between them.
It was only after Easter, when he came back to Hogwarts after his brief but earth-shattering encounter with Potter at the Manor, that he fell out of his relationship with Pansy and Blaise. Nothing they did could Obliviate the memory of those unmistakable, bright green eyes from his mind, Potter’s body struggling against his in a fight for life where Draco had all but given up his wand to the Chosen One.
Harry’s mind is still spinning the next day, when he knocks on the door of Ron and Hermione’s cottage in the countryside near Ottery St Catchpole.
“These are my rooms,” he tells Harry, the neutral, tour-guide tone back on, as if he hadn’t shut him down a second ago. “Study, bedroom, bathroom,” he enumerates. “You can go have a look. I’ll wait for you here.” He turns to look at Harry expectantly. Adds, “I have nothing to hide.” The words send a zing of disquiet through Harry, but he decides to ignore it, instead stepping inside the study.
Greg stomps across the room and settles on the chair across from Draco’s desk. It’s a beautiful antique that Draco salvaged from the Manor years ago, upholstered with soft, satiny grey silk. Half of the seat and back are covered with drawings of dragons, unicorns, and stars, a reminder of Draco’s son’s first attempts at figurative art and all the more perfect for it.
Draco laughed. The git
His friends grimace and giggle and say
“I thought it was clear. Head Auror Smith gave us the day off. Several days off, actually.”
Potter, Caduceus wouldn’t be the company it is today. You don’t build a successful business on ashes.”
He leans over the desk and grabs the legal documents he was about to sign. The permit for the building of Caduceus’ Romanian factory. He notices the rolls of parchment strewn around his desk. Odd. He doesn’t remember them falling down before going to find the quill. With a perplexed frown, he Summons the parchments into a tidy pile again.
And that his fascination with Malfoy, recently exacerbated, possibly carries an undercurrent of… something more personal, something that’s always simmered between them, something that says more about Harry than he’s been ready to acknowledge until now.
Oh, brilliant, now his friends are having a conversation about him when he’s right here.
By experience, that’s a surefire way to make him look like he belongs, like he’s a normal person just going about his job. It’s always worked brilliantly in making him look inconspicuous.
It’s precisely about survivors of the Second Wizarding War. The interview is mainly about you being a war hero.”
And she likes
They stare at each other, a silent understanding crossing the divide. Harry hears the words unsaid. He knows how lonely an empty house feels like. It’s possible he asked Malfoy to stay as much as a means to fill the void as in hopes of… something… unfolding between them. Even though it looks like nothing’s going to happen. Even though it looks like Malfoy doesn’t want anything to happen, besides a sound night of sleep.
“Have fun?” Harry says, starting to walk away as Ron sends him a forlorn look and lets Hermione pull him into another conversation.
“It’s been a long term for you and Harry,” his mother chimed in with the same mortifyingly knowing smile. “You need your rest.”
Draco felt his face heat. He buried his chin into his Slytherin scarf. “Oh, Merlin,” he muttered.
Harry’s eyes snap to hers. He’s surprised that he never thought about his feelings for Draco in those terms. “I— maybe,” he tells her, as honestly as he can. “Maybe… I could be.”
“Of course not, Saint Potter. Though I seem to remember that you weren’t so perfect either. I couldn’t show up anywhere in this damn school without you and your gang staring daggers at me. It wasn’t so pleasant either, believe it or not.”
Never ones to go without a fight, the former Quidditch players now in Eighth Year had pestered the Headmistress until she’d allowed them one hour of Quidditch practice, every Tuesday and Thursday after class, just to be left alone. Rumour had it that Weasley, Thomas, Greg and Blaise had camped in front of the stone gargoyle until McGonagall had come out in a flurry of tartan dressing gown and yelled
He stands straighter, and Harry backs away a step, as if caught. Draco lifts an eyebrow. A rush of pleased, petty satisfaction runs through him. Being able to fluster Harry Potter will never lose its charm.
-Hermione
After all these years, people still rarely smiled at him spontaneously.
“What do you think about? When you think of the future?”
“But you’re not going to tell me where they’re hidden.”
Potter’s mouth snapped shut. He blinked. He was still close enough for the collar-grabbing Draco envisaged. Close enough to punch. Close enough to kiss…
“And you, Mr Malfoy,” she turned her stern gaze to Draco, “you probably had career plans, too, though I don’t think I know what they were.”
“Come with me. There’s a few people I’d like you to meet.”
Harry appreciates Dewey’s respectful distance all the more for that.
Harry gave him a teasing smile. “I thought we’d agreed to fuck until the world ended. It pretty much looks like the world’s still here. Or… are you forfeiting already?” He brought his face closer to Malfoy’s. “Scared?”
He threw his Auror partner a mutinous glare. The git was already far ahead of him. He hadn’t even noticed Harry had stopped. Rather, he
“Oh, piss off, big brother,” Ginny pushed him lightly. “It
Jeff huffed and looked away. He had his little paws crossed over his chest, deep in thought. His tail swished back and forth on the duvet. Eventually, he eyed Draco again.
He knows what he looks like. The long, raised scars of Harry’s Sectumsempra criss-cross his white chest. They’re freakish and shocking, unlike anything anyone would expect to find marking the body of an aristocratic pureblood. Purebloods didn’t fight — at least never in a way that left physical marks. Purebloods never left a wound unattended long enough for it to scar. Despite this — or perhaps because of this — Draco’s come to like them. A reluctant, disgusted and grudging sort of appreciation, but appreciation nonetheless. A reminder, if he ever needed one, of all the things that set him apart from the witches and wizards who used to be his peers. He relishes the sudden paleness of Harry’s face, those green eyes trying to avoid the scars and helplessly drawn back to them. Oh, Merlin does he relish it. Draco lets a small, wry smile twist his lips. Showing him the way he maimed Draco for life is painful, but also just this side of pleasurable. He never thought he would get that tiny little revenge over the former bane of his existence.
Malfoy pushes his chair back. The legs screech on the kitchen tiles. He stands, grabbing his fork and the empty container of curry. “Oh, I don’t know, Potter,” he says flippantly, passing by Harry on his way to the sink. “I do think I’ve found my vocation.”
“Who said anything about flaunting? If we’re in this together, then why not just — tell me where you stand?”
Malfoy huffs softly. “Tchaikovsky is so…
Malfoy shuffles closer. “Come kneel behind me,” he says, voice strangely soft. “Between my legs. I’ll… guide you through.”
Now I’m taking a break from it all. My friends worry I’m going to turn into some sort of rich layabout if I don’t choose another career path soon. And not even a fun, eccentric one, to make their assumptions even more tragic. They really needn’t worry, though. I have a few ideas already. But, as I said… I need a break. I need to do nothing for a while. Be with my thoughts. Go for coffee in the mornings, have a nice chat with Cecilia, then go for a long walk (London is so bloody lovely in the spring.) Come home, cook, read a book.
When he looked over at Harry, Harry was watching him, hands in his lap. His green eyes gleamed in the candlelight, and Draco wished everything was as simple as holding out his hand, not to grab a piece of dried fruit, but to touch Harry’s fingers, entwine them with his, set things in motion.
~~FIN~~
“I said she might know more about our subject matter than these books.”
Draco laughed. “Fine. No more compliments for you, Granger: insults only.”
Christmas always falls on the same day. December 25th. Every year. I'm not sure I like it. Like birthdays. The kind of day that makes other people happy. A break in the routine, though. Loud. Sounds, smells, songs. Unusual. If I run my piano practice in my head I can tune most of it out.
“You were among the personalities suggested by our readers when we asked who best embodied the Second Wizarding War generation. Did you know that people look up to you like that? How do you feel about it?”
“I’m not staring at him. I just... let my gaze wander,” he muttered under his breath.
Or at least label your explicit correspondence to your boyfriend as ‘PERSONAL’. Please remember I also read the memos. And now I’m scarred for life.

was in print...Oh, but we wouldn’t have needed it. It was so obvious that every word printed in it was freely given.”
“Yes, I’m sure I would,” Malfoy smirks, and there’s a sardonic glint in his eye. “Is that what you think of me?”
he could read in their apologetic glances.
He’d opened up to Malfoy. He’d let Malfoy get to his knees for him. He’d taken Malfoy’s face in his hands and kissed him like one would kiss a lover. He’d gone after Malfoy and showed him his hand — showed him his hand like a lovesick fool.
His tone was carefully neutral. Draco’s hand itched for his wand.
“Draco, honey, you were sixteen, emotionally and sexually repressed, and prone to mood swings and panic attacks. I know this was through no fault of your own, and you’ve had ten years of therapy, amazing friends, and marriage—while it lasted—to become a better person. Let’s face it: you weren’t exactly the hottest eligible bachelor in your last years at Hogwarts—”
He needs… a bit more time.
“I like it.” Harry turned his head to look at the fire. “I never thought I’d live long enough to have a boyfriend, let alone introduce him to the people that matter to me.”
Down on the stage, lithe women dressed in white tutus swirl around a young man with a hopeful face and a leotard that leaves nothing to the imagination. Harry wishes he could tear his eyes away from those muscled thighs and those strong, defined biceps, from the danseur’s dark, expressive eyes. But it’s been three rough, sleepless weeks for Harry. He thinks he deserves that small, guilty pleasure. So he stares at the man on the stage. He pictures his own mind like a swan, sinking in a lake of thoughts and desires that he was no control over, that he can’t explain. The danseur spins and spins, with a controlled abandon that seems to defy gravity.
Harry — I want to watch you as you come.”
Harry takes a minute to comprehend what Draco just told him. Children’s equipment. A small venture that turned into an unexpected business hit. The hints Harry had caught for months of the unlikely friendship between Draco and his house-elf.
And then what? Harry has no idea. The only thing he’s sure of is that he doesn’t want Malfoy to fade into the night like he did last time. To leave him to wrestle with all the questions this encounter raised, and none of the answers.
“Yes…” Harry says. He lowers his eyes. The Mediwitch tied his arm so close to his chest… “... and no.”
“And I assume you’re family, too?” Harry says.
Draco straightens his shoulders, tilts his head back.
“Do you even know how to ice skate?”
Harry thinks wryly. It’s funny how easily he can spot those who overdo Caduceus’ youth potion after working only a few months for Draco. Not fooled by Harry’s discreet scrutiny, Narcissa lifts an eyebrow. “It’s actually reassuring for a mother to witness the skills of her son’s bodyguard firsthand,” she says. And she then proceeds with giving him a once-over, quick but blatant. Harry blushes hard when her eyes come to a stop on the side of his neck. The largest, purplest of the love bites Draco gave him yesterday is there — he forgot to heal it after his shower, and there’s no way to hide it now. He desperately wants the earth to open beneath his feet and swallow him, especially when Narcissa’s thin lips curl into a knowing, almost-salacious smile. “But now I don’t see why I ever doubted your competence, Mr Potter. It looks like you’re quite…
“Fuck yes,” Malfoy breathed, his cheeks colouring. A slow, genuine smile spread on his lips. “Yes. Let’s do this.”
“Draco,” Harry agrees, and then he kisses him.
After his initial meeting with Ron and Kingsley, the DMLE gave Harry all the documentation they had in relation to Malfoy’s case. Four boxes full of folders; thousands of pages of information on Harry’s former nemesis.
lead to Potter.” Pansy heaved a long-suffering sigh. “I wish I could help you.”

She pulled his hand away.
there's a depiction of recreational drug use (a marijuana joint) in a 100% consensual context. If this is a potential squick, you can skip the last 1000-ish words starting when Harry comes back from his dorm room. Other than that... enjoy this one ;)
He deserves someone who’ll stand by him, stand up for him, and not just do the reluctant, half-arsed job Harry’s been doing since January.
“Scorpius—” Draco says.
him to push and bite and take and claim. With one last lick across Harry’s swollen lips, he pulled back an inch.
Scorpius doesn’t move, except for the lateral movement of his fingers on the keys, back and forth, back and forth, as if he’s trying to rub them clean. There’s a frightening intensity in him, his magic rolling off him in waves like an overflowing pool. Harry wonders if this is what he looked to his aunt Petunia when he was seven — this vast unknown of a child, magic spilling around him with so little control that even Muggles felt it. Then again, he wasn’t like Scorpius… he wasn’t autistic, and he wasn’t freakishly gifted—
“I’m ready,” Malfoy breathes, his head hanging low now. “Merlin, I’m ready. Are you?”
He followed Harry out of the Library. They silently walked the drafty corridor leading to the stairwell. It was a normal school night of December; the castle was quiet, save for the occasional students rushing off to join the merry fire and friendly faces of their year’s common room.
“You’re getting paid?” Harry can’t hide his surprise.
jeans seared into his brain.
Hermione swishes her wand and the toys on the sofa fly into the toy box. She goes to sit next to him, looking exactly like she did when she was flipping through books at the Hogwarts library in search for an answer to her questions.
“Nothing. Everything. I don’t know anymore. Two days ago, I thought —” He exhales a frustrated laugh. “I thought it was going somewhere. Draco and I. I was… forgetting myself, clearly. Forgetting what my job was.” He meets Hermione’s gaze again and forces himself to hold it. “But it was all lies. And I was tired of it, Hermione. I could tell he knew something was off about me, so when he confronted me about it…”
Absorbed as he was in the changing shades of grey in Malfoy’s glinting eyes, Harry belatedly remembers he’s got his own container of chicken vindaloo, probably going cold. Yep, definitely cold. Still spicy as fuck.
The first one is Scorpius.
Mmh. The Unspeakables sent me the next challenge. I’m going to need your help. Again. I think?
Harry Potter bursts into their office with all the grace of a rabid Hippogriff.
“I think there’s something you need to explain,” Harry says, unfolding the parchment and holding it out for Draco to see, “about this.”
“What?” he hisses. Harry’s staring at him, wide-eyes and blinking, like Draco wrenched him awake. His Lumos flickers, once, twice. Then the light dies out, leaving them in the dark.
“We’re really doing this,” he said, somewhere between a statement and a question. “The world must really have come to an end.”
“So,” Draco flops down on his chair and makes it spin, landing his feet on the desk. He pushes his hair out of his eyes in a dramatic sweep. “Regale me with your naughtiest weekend adventures, ladies.”
were brilliant. That voice of yours…
Harry’s stomach flips at Draco’s affectionate outburst. He'd forgotten about that… He had added Draco’s name to his St Mungo’s records the Monday after their walk in Hyde Park, Draco, Scorpius and him. He’d felt so close to Draco then… like they could perhaps actually be something besides ex-childhood enemies, besides employer and employee. He’d thought,
“It’s Harry to you, Malfoy,” he grinned, at odds with the moment Draco was having. “And I never thought you were stupid.”
“It’s true! You told me all about your plans and your big project. You both want to improve magical and Muggle cures and it’s… it’s good work, you know? What you’re working on… it shows heart, and passion. It’s not just all Hermione’s doing, also. Even though you’re absolutely brilliant,” Ron adds for Hermione’s benefit, and she beams. “It’s like Malfoy really wants to help create some kind of better future. I’ve been on the job for years, Harry. I can sniff out when someone isn’t genuine about something.”
“Yes,” Harry says in earnest.
“And you dashed off so bloody fast that day, I was certain you regretted our night together. Of course I wasn’t going to firecall you. You see, I usually prefer my men fully enthusiastic about a relationship with me.”
“Why didn’t you use magic?”
“Yes,” Malfoy nodded. “We do.”
Dear Drake,
Harry’s eyes go from the fallen coins to Malfoy’s face. Harry’s hands are fisted at the collar of Malfoy’s elegant shirt. Malfoy’s pale grey eyes hold the ominous calm of a sky before a storm. “What are you?” Harry demands. “A
“Come on, Draco,” he said. “Let’s see what McGonagall needs us for.”
Across the foyer, Malfoy shows Harry a simple and attractive dining room space furnished with a two-metre-long table and eight wooden designer chairs, with bow windows overlooking the hedges of the front yard and the street, and a modern chandelier hanging from the ceiling. At the back of the room, a door leads to the basement, where Harry finds a large and fully-equipped kitchen with a fire crackling happily in the hearth. With a pang of nostalgia, he’s reminded of the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, the only room of the house where he’s ever truly felt at home.
I am sure I don’t know what you mean.
“She’s not
With a sigh, he gets himself ready. He’d been expecting this moment. It won’t be easy, but he won't lose his composure. He may be different from the boy he was twelve years ago, but he’s still a Malfoy.
“Don’t worry about them, Potter. My concealment charms were always better than yours, even back at Hogwarts. I’ve only gotten better since then.”
“I can’t wait for the next lesson.”
he adds, heat creeping up his face. “Draco doesn’t know about this.”
Harry takes a deep steadying breath and closes the folder.
“I had my pride.”
He straightens sharply, hip jutting to the side, arse pushed back. Blowing on his fringe, he takes his enraptured audience in and smirks. “Now
He thinks of Harry’s arms around him, Harry’s chin on his shoulder, Harry’s body against his… and he decides not much else matters.
Harry’s fingers slid under Draco’s belt. “Please,” he ground against his lips. “Can I please do the same to you?”
with your mum and how everything is so much classier there,” Theo scoffed.
Harry. Use it. Buy them a chess set, buy them a new quill, buy them cooking books. Your gifts won’t bring back the dead, but they will remind the living that you’re still here for them.”
“I want you too, Malfoy,” Harry says, frowning. “But we’re not at Hogwarts anymore, and I’m done playing games with you. So what’s it going to be?”
Mephistopheles took a step back and surveyed him.
“Good boy,” Harry had said with a tired smile. “You’ll keep an eye on him, will you?”
“For both our sakes!” Draco seethes. “We’ve the plans of the entire Ministry to thwart, and we’re nowhere near done! Now is not the time for sentimentality, do you not see that?”
Malfoy lifted his eyes to his.
No. You didn’t really have a choice, either.
“With good reason. I mean…
“You could, you know. You
Yet Draco had managed to give Harry as good as he’d got. He’d pushed him into the guest bathroom at the end of the corridor, then into one of the stalls, and—
He’s noticed the way Harry’s eyes always scan the rooms they’re in. He’s listened to Ernestina telling him about Harry’s coming and going at odd times of the day.
Sex just didn’t appeal to him. Not in the way it did for that young man. Not in the way it did for Pansy or Blaise. Not in the way it did for everyone around him, young and less young, no matter their gender or sexual orientation. Everyone seemed to be chasing after sex like it was the Snitch at the final match of the Quidditch World Cup. And Draco felt like he was the one watching from the stands.
then he licked it again, once, his eyes on Harry’s face, his long, pink tongue on display.
Pansy found him in the Magical Careers section of the Library. He was so lost in thought he didn't hear her coming.
Draco cut him off with an open-mouthed kiss, lips closing around the darkening cotton, licking the saltiness into his mouth. Harry’s hand fell in his hair and Draco pulled back.
“Talk to me,” Harry’s voice reaches him. He sounds strained. Wrecked. It’s all Draco’s doing. “Tell me how it feels…”
“I should explain,” he hears Scorpius speak up.
“Like a charm.”
“Careful… that’s her ‘about to give you a lecture’ face,” Harry mutters, and everyone giggles — except for Narcissa who’s trying to conceal her bewilderment behind the most neutral face Harry’s ever seen on her. Hermione rolls her eyes, undeterred, and launches in an explanation.
Three: I’m still waiting for your answer to my question. It’s not very polite to leave a bloke hanging.
Draco felt a blush creep up his neck. “Oh, Merlin.”
There was silence, and then: “Oh.
“I’m happy for me too, it’s just...”
“Potter,” he inhales sharply. “I am
They reached the Great Lake. Dark waves crested with white foam rolled at the surface. The Lake had never looked like a lake to Draco. It looked like a small ocean, downsized to fit in the Hogwarts grounds. It scared him a bit, the way the ocean always did. He remembered the chill he’d felt during the Triwizard Tournament, when Harry had dived into the muddy waters in Fourth Year—
Yours,
“What?” Harry asked. He looked entirely too innocent.
“Harry.” When Draco speaks, the Aurors stop for a second. Draco’s looking at him, his face a pale shade of grey, his eyes exhausted and hollow save for the imploring glint in them. “Please. Take care of Scorpius. Take care of him— until I’m back.” His shoulders slump and he shakes his head, looking empty again. His sneer is bitter and his tone is several degrees colder when he adds: “We’ll talk — we’ll finish this when I come back.”
through the green flames and right under his nose. “DRACO!” she’d cackled, “I can’t believe you hired Potter to be your live-in wet dream!”
before the door even opens, that Malfoy will be the next person to walk in.
Up until two days ago, I thought you’d never worked a day in your life. Not that I care what you do with your life,” he hastens to add, “but it sounds like something the Daily Prophet would have picked up on, doesn’t it?”
who knows who you are,” Draco says with a sneer. “That's not what I call being open about us.”
And he’s been truthful, this time. When Harry walks out of the bathroom stall, Draco is combing his hair in front of the mirror. There’s a square piece of parchment on the counter, with a Floo address scribbled on it.
Penelope folds her arms and nods at him. “Oh yeah? Prove it. What did you do last Friday?”
“Maybe it’s for the best, yes,” Draco tells her, not looking away from Potter. Who keeps staring, abashed but unrelenting.
Harry gapes at Draco, his mind shocked into blankness. “You don’t mean that.”
for days after she leaves. Brought me the chocolates I like from Paris, the ones with whole hazelnuts inside. Texture melty but not too much. Sweet. Crunchy, with a bitter aftertaste.) Uncle Greg is in London for a week, with his wife. (The tall, scary one.) (I really like her.) He asked me if I could draw him a unicorn, but I prefer the piano now. Unicorns when I was four. And dragons.
“Harry.” The movement stops inside the cupboard.
Harry shakes his head. “I could have stayed away from you.”
When Harry didn’t respond, Draco walked around the couch, looking at him curiously. When Draco came across his line of vision, Harry jumped. He wore strange white contraptions in his ears, linked by a cord to a flat round machine, and he pulled them out hurriedly, flushing a little. The little contraptions fell to his lap.
“Yeah.” Harry smiles, and reaches up. He runs a knuckle down Malfoy’s cheek, and a little sound — half gasp, half moan — escapes Malfoy’s parted lips. He leans in just another inch, and he presses his body against Malfoy’s, feeling the heat through layers of clothes. “More specifically… I like you.”
“Maybe,” Harry sighed. “I know what the public sees in me. But at the end of the day, Draco...I’ve dealt with the past the same way all my friends have. The same way
Merlin, it was too gorgeous a sight. The old, all-too-familiar yearning stabbed through Draco. If Potter kept smiling at him like that, he’d need far more champagne to handle the evening. He grabbed the side of the buffet for support.
“You owe me, Hermione,” Ron mumbles, taking a big gulp of wine and wiping his forehead with a paper napkin. “You owe me big time.”
Ron sighs. “You say that every time, Harry,” he says, “and yet you keep showing up.”
“I wasn’t expecting you. Is Scorpius home?”
Hey Draco,
“Probably. All I remember is your sneering, pointy face, Malfoy,” Harry said amiably, playfully.
Scorpius rises from his seat and runs — “Nestine!” he calls, — past Malfoy, and out of the room. Balzac barks and dashes after him.
She narrowed her eyes at him. “Don’t try to be funny, Harry. Unless you know how to do this?”
more,” Draco says, eyeing Harry with an odd mixture of wariness and provocation. Harry’s heart feels full to bursting.
There’s silence for a long while, then he hears Ron shift where he sits. He asks in a careful voice: “You like him, like… you would a good friend? …or…”
I kind of like it when you come back all sweaty from Quidditch practice…
Well... here it is! The last chapter of this little Christmas story.
He caught Harry’s questioning gaze from across the table and smiled. Lucifer, how good he looked. His jet-black hair was in its usual state of disarray, but now Draco knew how soft it actually felt when he carded his fingers through it. He knew how warm and smooth Harry’s skin was under his hands. He knew what Harry’s smile meant.
“Good. Because I have to be honest with you, Draco. The bosses are not happy with you at the moment—”
at the Paris Opera. He turns around to review the room once more. It looks like a small, less-used version of Malfoy’s office downstairs, but Harry’s trained eye doesn’t spot anything out of the ordinary. He walks over to Malfoy’s bedroom, feeling oddly guilty, like he’s snooping around. Which, to be fair, is exactly what he’s doing.
“I wasn’t here the last few days, remember?”
It always was—Draco hated to admit it—a lot of fun. All of them were good players, even Weasley, now that the pressure of performance was off. Often, the other Eighth Year students would gather on the stands to watch. There was also the constant side effect of having Harry Potter on the team: the gawking Potter fans. Students from all years huddling on the stands and cheering loudly if Harry so much as lifted his forefinger to push his slipping glasses up on his nose. The one time Draco has caught the Snitch at the beginning of the year—his first win against Harry ever, which was personal cause for celebration—the student body was so furious they had almost caused a riot. Since then, McGonagall had forbidden access to the Eighth Year's Quidditch for anyone who wasn’t an Eighth Year student, and the games had a much friendlier feel to them.
“Very. I don’t suppose you’d like to do this… sooner?”
Malfoy pulls back, a hand on Harry’s cheek.
“You’ve already been here — the parlour, a waiting room for my personal appointments,” Malfoy tells him, gesturing towards the beautiful sunlit room that was Harry’s first impression of the house. The vase on the table has been refilled with a fresh white hydrangea. “Otherwise, most of my professional meetings take place in my office at Caduceus. You’ll notice a lot of people coming and going into Caduceus in the next few months. Financial auditors from the Ministry. However…
They glanced at each other for a second, and then—
me,” Draco turned to Harry, stunned.
[Editor’s note: Ginny Weasley, Star Chaser of the Holyhead Harpies]
sharp as a warning. The mercurial ebb and flow of his warmth towards Harry,  like he had to continually stop himself from getting too familiar and comfortable around him. The constant glances when Draco thought Harry wasn’t looking. And now… Draco’s eyes on him, almost supplicant.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked. He’d expected Malfoy to jeer at him, not to stay frozen in shock.
“Draco. Do you want this?”
“How did you know where to find me?” Harry asks. He smiles, and Draco smiles back at him. They seem unable to look away from each other.
And underneath all this, the image of Harry remains, lying in a hospital bed with an arm he’d sprained while protecting Draco’s son. Draco’s heart leaps and twists in his chest, his emotions shifting too fast between hurt, anger, sadness, fatalism. Scorpius doesn’t notice the change in atmosphere. Draco is thankful for his son’s obliviousness, even if remembering the circumstances that prevent Scorpius from noticing Harry is gone is like taking a blunt hit in the gut.
Harry from four months ago had repeated, ad nauseam it seems.
“Wait.”
The actual sight of it does nothing to alleviate the feeling. Almost shy, he steps into the sunlit room, eyeing the beautiful four-poster bed that wouldn’t look out of place in their Hogwarts dormitories, if only for the size of it. With what he guesses are king-sized dimensions, Malfoy’s bed is a far cry from the single beds all of them had in school.
“It's instinct, Draco!”
“Right.” Draco exhaled a short laugh.
Draco wondered if his heart was past the point of breaking. Dazed, numb, he listened to her tell him about Blaise, the way he’d reached out during the summer, the way he’d comforted her. The way they’d fallen in love while Draco was shut away, an inexorable series of events and choices he hadn’t made pulling him closer to a darkness he despised.
“Fine,” Draco rolls his eyes, but leans in to kiss him. “A date.”
“Neither did I,” he said quietly.
“Oh, Draco,” he said before Draco had time to feel hurt. “Thank you
He made his way around the dancefloor, pushing through the crowd with soft “excuse me”s. People moved aside to let him pass, and by the time they realised who he was, he was already walking away. The faces all looked familiar, but Harry was surprised by how few names he remembered. It was safer to avoid everyone, rather than spend uncomfortable minutes in conversation with people he couldn’t even place.
“And then I want you to stay inside when you come, Malfoy,” Harry mumbled in a blur, wanking himself furiously, his balls drawing up, his orgasm imminent, “You’re going to pound that fat cock of yours in me and you’re going to fill me with your hot spunk—”
There’s a bit of a shuffle as Malfoy rolls away and onto his stomach, grabbing his wand from the floor where it fell with his clothes. Harry’s eyes travel from the mussed blond hair to the strong, naked back, the jut of those shoulder blades, the swell of that delicious arse, the long, muscled legs. God, it’s like every single fantasy he’s had for the past ten years is coming to life, and Draco Malfoy, somehow, wants to fulfil them all.
he would explain.
“Yes.” Harry holds Malfoy's gaze, unabashed.
for the best.
Without a word, Harry sits across from Malfoy, choosing the grey silk chair. Malfoy follows his movements with a slight lift of his eyebrow. Then he pulls a piece of parchment from a pile on his desk and examines it.
And enjoying anything as basely human as ice skating was unfit of a demon.
Withdrawing his fingers, he settled over Harry, slicked his cock with lube with three pumps of his fist and lined it with Harry’s waiting hole. Before he pushed in, he looked up at Harry with a small smile.
You have?
“It’s my job,” Harry says, but his voice catches in his throat. He’s exhausted, and shaken, and he wants to pull Draco closer and take him in his arms and tell him it’ll all be fine in the end…
“What?” Harry huffed a disbelieving laugh. “No!”
“Draco...”
I want to thank everyone who's read and commented so far (as well as screamed at me for breaking your hearts, lolol). I appreciate every one of you and reading your thoughts and reactions is the best part of my day!
Another thing I’ll have to edit out later, obviously.
she’d probably say with her teasing smile. But it's been so long, and Harry's the one with him now. So he holds Harry’s head in his hands, thumbs bracketing his face. Harry’s cheeks are pink, his eyebrows drawn, his eyes gleaming in the soft half-light.
“You know how recently,” Harry says. He takes a step forward. The kitchen’s not that big; Malfoy’s not that far. Harry moves into Malfoy’s personal space, heart speeding up in his chest. Malfoy drops his gaze to the rim of Harry’s collar. Harry inches closer. “I’m starting to think I like… blokes.”
Feeling uncomfortably moved, Harry fiddles with the handle of his tea mug and doesn’t say a word. Hermione makes a tiny noise in the back of her throat, as if she still cannot quite believe it’s happening — Harry wordlessly admitting that Draco is good for him.
“Not with everyone around—” The words seem to have escaped Potter’s mouth before he could stop them. He stands back, wide-eyed and blushing. Draco stares. All the air seems to have left his lungs.
Draco studied the Niffler’s beady black eyes. He was doing his best to pretend to project a look of solicitude, but his eyes kept fleeting to Draco’s bedside table.
It was horrifically endearing.
When he slid the piece of parchment in front of Draco, Draco squinted to decipher Harry's messy scrawl. He was answering Draco's question.
“Yeah. That’s the point. Well, that, and the fact that you can take your music with you.”
“Alright?” he asked, as much to check that Harry had reacted in surprise and not in repulsion as to make sure he would be allowed to continue.
“Mistor Potter should have breakfast upstairs with us, sir,” Ernestina says, turning unblinking brown eyes towards him.
The door opens to reveal a sliver of corridor and Malfoy standing in the threshold, in a t-shirt and a pair of joggers he borrowed from Harry. His hair hangs in his eyes, still damp from his shower. Harry waits, blood thrumming under his skin.
Draco dropped his hands in his lap. “Now that my entire family knows we’re going to defile each other in the next room, we might as well get on with it, don’t you think?”
the whole thing from his own memory.
Nobody had challenged Harry in ten years, and Harry discovered he’d missed it.
“Oh, don’t play coy, Potter.” Draco had lifted an eyebrow, clearly amused. “You know what it’s about. Granger contacted me several weeks ago. Well.
Please find the bet attached to this memo.
But this was something else: it felt like hitting a wall, like something they wouldn't be able to move past. He’s spent half his life hating Draco; he’s spent the last months falling irrevocably in love with him. He never thought these two emotions could coexist until the moment Draco shut him down for being soft with him and ordered him to defile him on his office desk instead. As soon as Harry let his real feelings slip, Draco acted like those feelings never existed.
Malfoy turns a sharp gaze at him and Harry flinches back.

His cock gives a hopeful lurch at the thought.
Not as clever as

“It can’t be that hard, can it?” Harry said. “Draco has already done the research. And I grew up watching my aunt fill out subscription forms for

Someone yells, and Harry isn’t sure if it was him or Draco, but he shoves Scorpius to the ground and rolls down alongside him, blindly casting a
Next to Harry, Scorpius is rocking under his hand, his face streaked with tears.
I wanted to know if you realised the impact your series could have when you started it.
Draco looked up, his curiosity piqued in spite of himself. The bosses had let him live his lives without too much supervision lately, save for his annual meetings with his tutor. Mephistopheles saw the change in him and grinned. Ugly, yellow, crooked teeth flashed in the dark.
Harry gasps, rocking against Draco again. “God, Draco. That voice of yours – you drive me wild.”
Draco remembered that conversation, indeed.
he chided at himself,
Thank you for your honest answer.
Malfoy must see the question on Harry’s face. He pushes up to his elbows and knees, and Harry’s brain does that weird thing where it catches up and short-circuits at the same time. Hastily, he sits up, scrambling with the covers. He feels about as graceful and certain as a— well, as a twenty-five-year-old virgin. Harry’s afraid to look, yet he can’t look at anything else. The previous times, he could pretend that it was something that he let happen. This time feels deliberate.
“Oh, of course. Is that where you met…”
“Doesn't tell me which class you're studying this for—oh.” Harry's expression turned teasing at once. “Have you been researching for our career choice assignment?”
we were right to accept your invitation for Ernestina’s cooking alone!”

“Let me finish, ‘Mione! I wanted to say, I haven’t seen Harry like this... haven’t seen him like this in ages.”
Harry hates coming to the Ministry.
There was no denying that he was laughing now, and Harry’s insides warmed at the sound.
Daddy and Harry both took me to the same jewelry store. (Five days apart.) They both want it to be a surprise for the other. Picked rings that match in shape and design. (One silver, one gold.)
“Hey, Malfoy?” Ron poked him in the side. He nodded towards the back door. “Harry's waited for your ferret face long enough.” Draco wasn’t sure whether he meant tonight, or much longer than that. With a wistful smile, Ron patted him on the shoulder. “Go get him, mate.”
He looks up at Draco, caution giving way to delight. “Does that mean—”
They walked in the direction of the Library.
He wakes up in the morning to an empty bed.
“What’s a firefighter?” Malfoy asks with a small crease between his brows.
The quiet, however, never lasted.
Slowly, Harry looks back at Kingsley, asking the question he must ask and dreading the answer.
Malfoy sighs, as though Harry is the densest human being he’s ever encountered.
“That was…” Harry’s voice is a lazy murmur. His hot breath caresses Draco’s cheek.
“Down, Balzac,” Blaise is laughing, all the while holding the dog’s paw in his hand and patting his head. “I can’t believe Narcissa hasn’t found a way to poison you yet.” The dog barks and lets go of Blaise to pounce on Pansy, who lifts her hands with a screech.
“Oh, because it’s all
Regards,
“And they make nests,” Harry continued. “They have to guard their treasures.”
“Why do you assume I did something? They’re at the premiere of one of the most beautiful ballets ever played. They’ve got better things to do than pay attention to you. Believe it or not, you’re not that interesting.”
Dinner reaches its end in a more subdued atmosphere than it had started. Ernestina brings an enormous chocolate cake laden with small birthday candles. Someone makes a joke about it being bright enough that they don’t need the lights on. Good natured jabs about Draco’s ancient age ensue, and Draco laughs and gives his friends tit for tat. The cake disappears in less than ten minutes and is replaced with cups of tea, hot cocoa, and, in the case of Blaise, a glass of bas armagnac.
Come up with a more accurate description next time.

“All right,” Greg says at length. “I’ve got to go. Millie must be waiting for me.”

Harry pushes his tongue in his cheek, ponders his next words. “I think… I think I just need to know.”
one last time.
But the truth is, Harry doesn’t know how to. Sometimes he has the feeling that if he ever unclenches his teeth — if he ever lets his guard down — all the terrible things he left behind will spring back to life. He doesn’t know how to be idle, that’s the trouble with him. And yet he can’t seem to figure how to be anything else.
“It was a coincidence, Malfoy,” Harry said between kisses, his hands working the fastenings of Draco’s trousers.
“What about something that we can both— equally enjoy?” Harry asks, panting.
In that moment, her resemblance with McGonagall was so uncanny Harry had to fight down a smile. A quick glance at Malfoy confirmed that the same thought had crossed his partner’s mind. They both lifted their hands to their mouths in an attempt to stifle a laugh.
Draco took a step, then another.
With a breathless laugh, Malfoy took his cock in his hand and pushed the fat head of it inside Harry’s arse.
Harry pulls back as much as he can, head in the pillows. He only left the small bedside lamp on. In the warm, dim light, Malfoy’s eyes glow silver. He’s got something of his old smirk on his face, tempered by the flush of his pale cheeks, his pupils blown wide. Harry reaches up to touch his swollen lips.
Harry gets a whiff of Narcissa’s rose perfume as she leans over Draco. “Happy birthday, baby boy,” she whispers as she kisses him goodnight, but Harry catches it.
had set his quarters at the Manor...I would manage to scavenge day-old newspapers, sometimes. I was just...I was so starved for information. I wanted to know the truth. About what was going on outside of the Manor. Outside of Hogwarts. But it was the same, constant stream of bullshit, day after day after day. I would read those papers, and the press would just write whatever the Death Eaters were feeding them. At first, I read because I needed hope—” Draco realised his hands were clenched in white-knuckled fists. He rubbed his sweaty palms over the fabric of this trousers and laughed ruefully. “Sorry; I need to find a more...politically correct introductory pitch for this thing.”
“Have you… met someone?” she asks at last.
“All right,” Malfoy scowls. He’s still unconvinced. “Is that why I should choose you, then? Because you could have killed me and I could have killed you, and we didn’t? Seems pretty thin an argument.”
I like them. I
She was assessing them with narrowed eyes.

The moment seems to stretch and stretch, but in reality must not last for longer than a few seconds. Malfoy is studying Harry just as intently, an almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips.
“You’re not?” he asks Malfoy.
Because... Harry must have
Please don’t take it personally.”
Narcissa nods. “Draco owes you his life, Mr Potter, perhaps on more than one level,” she says. “However, do not forget than you owe me yours.”
“You nearly killed me in sixth year,” Malfoy averts his eyes and murmurs, as if hoping Harry won’t hear him.
“He looks as though he could be breathing,” Luna mused next to her, “if only it wasn’t this cold.”
“Draco!”
With that, he heads for the stairs and disappears up the stairwell.
“A date?” He asks, careful.
He knows he shouldn’t. But when has he ever been able to resist his curiosity, when it came to Malfoy?
“Okay, first of all, this is a case for the DMLE, not a mission for a private investigator,” he argues. His tone is rising but he can’t bring himself to care. “Second, do you even have a plan, or is it as basic as ‘go to Malfoy’s house and make friends with him and have him spill all his dirty secrets even though you haven’t seen him in a decade and last time you did, he hated you with a passion?’ Because it’s not exactly what I call airtight.”
“Or…” Harry continues and takes a step closer, “you’ve spent too much time in here already, and you’re worried she’ll make fun of you. Which she will, when you admit you could have asked her right away instead of wasting half an hour looking for a quill.”
He glanced at Harry again, as one would glance at his life buoy when lost at sea. Harry caught his gaze and squeezed his knee reassuringly.
“Mate, the

and Harry feels it. He hasn’t dared touch Draco since the guests arrived, and he’s itching to reach out under the table and wrap his hand around Draco’s bony knee. Perhaps sitting next to Narcissa Malfoy, who’s watching him like a hawk, isn’t ideal for that endeavour.
And it would have been so much worse if you hadn’t been there… Scorpius would have been in so much trouble. Thank you,” he says again.
a listen :)
Malfoy is gone without a word in the time it takes for Harry to recover from his orgasm. He adjusts his clothing the best he can, unsure if Malfoy’s concealing spells still hold now that their caster is gone. Then he stays in the dark box, staring into the distance, the ballet coming to a close on stage. He must have missed more than half of it, between the moment Malfoy had sat next to him to the moment he’d licked his lips and risen, slithering out of the box before Harry could grab his wrist and haul him back on his lap and—
“So eager for me, Potter,” he murmurs against Harry’s lips. “To think I almost turned you down tonight… What would you have done if I hadn’t come here?”
“Leave it. It doesn’t matter. I don’t give a fuck why you never sought me out again after that night. I just—I just wish you’d respect my work enough to stay out of it, if you choose to refuse to take part in it. Like Luna’s work, it’s my fucking
“I’ve got a package,” he says, same as last week.
“You said I would bring your son to his therapist appointments.”
“I will not. Ernestina, you know that you, Scorpius, Caduceus… you all come first. And I come second. I’ve always made my decisions in that order.”
Harry’s jaw goes slack. “You… You bastard—!”
Not only would he have to work with Harry on this assignment, but he’d have to convincingly lie about a future he didn’t have. He’d have to convincingly lie about a future he didn’t have to
“So.” Hermione smiles, tentative. Harry sighs and shakes his head.
Just when Harry was opening his mouth to retort, fists clenched and eyes flashing, Longbottom cleared his throat.
So Draco asked, “Do you have more space-related music I can listen to?”
When Draco doesn’t elaborate, Harry takes a step towards him.
of an eyeful, but far from me to complain,” he added, his mouth twisting in a salacious grin.
His eyes widened when he felt the oily slide of his finger against Harry’s hole. Harry jerked forward a bit, startled, nearly choking Draco. Draco pulled away and looked up at Harry in the semi-darkness. There was drool dripping from his chin but he couldn’t be arsed to wipe it.
Fighting a winning smile, Draco said sweetly, “Oh, I understand, Jeff dearest. Unfortunately, Father would be terribly cross if I happened to misplace his family’s signet ring, you see.”
Draco places his hand on Harry’s. On the table, where everyone can see. And Harry’s certain everyone around the table has their eyes fixed on their joined hands, but Draco is only looking at him.
Spurred on by his words, Malfoy dug his fingers into Harry’s hips deep enough to bruise, and Harry felt the first wave of his climax hit him as his cock throbbed in his fist and started to pulse hot ribbons of come on his chest and stomach. “Oh fuck, Harry,” Malfoy grunted and slammed into him faster, deeper, “Oh fuck, I’m coming in you, can you feel it, can you feel me—”
?” Draco’s voice went up several octaves. “

Soon he was under the cover of dark trees. Above him, the naked branches framed the starry night sky, stark and ominous like bad omens. He breathed again. No one in their right mind would follow him into the Forbidden Forest—except perhaps Hagrid if he spotted Draco out on the grounds past curfew. But the light in his cabin was on: Hagrid hadn’t gone out for an unplanned evening patrol.

He just wished working on it wouldn’t constantly paint him into a corner. He had atoned for a lot of his past. He had made his peace with it.
“Hi.”
Malfoy lifts his head. “I will,” he says. He shuffles to the side of the bed and turns to his side, like he’s putting an end to this conversation.
“Be my guest.”
He tilted his head to take more of Harry’s cock into his mouth. He licked it on his way up, closing his lips around the tip and hollowing his cheeks to suck at Harry’s foreskin. He pressed down once more, and then Harry’s muscles clamped around his finger and he pulsed in Draco’s mouth once, twice, as he came with a ragged cry.
approach worked better than the compassionate one. Ron snickered, and Draco smirked.
If he had a choice what to be in his next life, he’d ask for an assignment in Antarctica, scaring off penguins.
and which Draco did not care for.
“What about a visit to the Quidditch lockers, then? For old times’ sake?” he’d dared to ask.
“We cleaned everything,” Harry shrugged playfully. “Their kitchen is as good as new.”
Narcissa turns a mild smile at him. “Well, yes, darling.”
Team Aurors wins, Team Unspeakables LOSES.

It's near impossible to dwell on Scorpius for long. The very thought of his son being hurt again steals Draco's breath — he has to stop, one hand on a tree trunk, another clutching the place where his heart beats painfully in his chest. He hopes Harry found a way to help Scorpius out of his fit, that he managed to tame his magic down enough to avoid another catastrophe. Draco can’t think of what tomorrow will be like, and the days after that. He can’t believe he let it happen — let those bastards force their way into his home, beat up his house-elf, hex his dog, and scare his little boy so badly he literally exploded the room and passed out. He takes a big, heaving gulp of air.
He managed to extricate his foot from the puddle and looked down at it. The seams of his boot were coming apart.

“You know I’m not, Draco,” Greg tells him, his deep, rumbling voice soft as always. When he speaks, his lips barely move. It’s always been that way. Draco was one of the few people who could understand Greg’s poorly articulated words. He knows that to almost everyone else, it accentuated the impression of Greg being slightly dim; someone who’s only good enough to play one of Draco’s cronies.
Harry pushes Malfoy off him, much more gently this time. The look that Malfoy levels on him steaks his breath. A blend of shared amusement and—
Harry took a step back, seemingly realising what he’d just said.
“The intent isn’t.”
Draco looked up at Harry and smiled shyly when he saw the look of love in his eyes. Harry did that sappy heart shape with his hands that always made Draco roll his eyes, but inwardly melt.
He stopped writing, scratched the back of his neck. With one glance at Draco, he continued.
“Not when you’re about to lose your mind over that bloody quill you can’t find, and I’m your only hope of finding it.” Harry narrows his eyes, mock-thoughtful, ignoring Draco's disgruntled expression. “Hmm. So. Tell me everything you know about the missing quills.”
“Oi! Lovebirds! Come and give us a hand, will ya?” Finnigan shouted.
“So you’ve been working for Draco for a long time, then. You stayed, even when they moved back to London?”
It was past eleven when Draco walked into the Eighth Year Common Room, the books he had picked from the Library tucked under his arm. At this hour, he thought the Common Room would be deserted. Students usually didn’t stay up this late on weeknights.
At Harry’s relieved moan, he let out a low chuckle.
“Ha!” Ron points at him. “There! I

part. Just the hiring Harry Potter to be around him 24/7 part. That's idiotic enough. That cannot end well, one way or another. He thinks about stopping it. Actually, he thinks about it too many times a day. It’s hindering his productivity, honestly. Another excellent reason to fire the impossible prat.
“The Minister has so many reasons for coming after Caduceus — after you. Catching an ex-Death Eater. Adding a new catch to his wall of fame. Reminding wizarding Britain of his glory days as an Auror. Replenishing the Ministry vaults with your confiscated wealth.”

That’s how much I want this to happen.”

At that, Malfoy huffs a humourless laugh, eyebrows raised as though he can’t believe Harry’s nerve.
If he had… If he’d even had the image of Draco’s scars in mind when he was going over that moment of his life with his therapist (over and over and over, analysing every one of his thoughts, motives, gestures, the feel of Draco’s hot blood gushing out of the wounds and the freezing water seeping through his trousers... he’d talked about it for weeks before he even started to get a sense of closure) — if he’d had that image in mind, he’d still be sitting in Angelica’s office, tearing his hair out over his own stupidity and blindness.
“Sorry, mate. But you being Harry Potter is exactly why we think you’re the right agent to put on the case.”

Lavender teased.
“I’m applying for a scholarship at St Salena College at Cambridge,” Hermione explained. “They have the best combined Muggle and Wizarding undergraduate degree in History and Spells Archeology. I want to keep learning about magic,” she said, her cheeks pinking slightly, “and how it affects our magic and Muggle worlds.”
Draco smile ruefully. “Clearly, I’m forgetting myself.”
“My status?”
“You crazy sod,” Harry steps out of the lift, rolling his eyes with a smile. “Why do I ever follow you anywhere?”
Harry let out a shaky breath.“Because we waited for it,” he laughed, pushing his arse back against Draco’s cock. He started rocking, slow and breathless, the delicate drag of skin against the sensitive tip of Draco’s cock almost too good to bear. Draco bit his lip to keep from crying out. “Because—
They lay there, almost all their skin exposed. In the near-darkness, Harry could only hear their breathing, loud and fast. He could see the way Malfoy was looking down at him, an almost wistful expression on his face.
There was a hunger in Harry’s staring that alarmed him. He put his fork back in his plate, food untouched. “I didn’t know that—”
Then again, Malfoy wasn’t most people. He just said what he wanted to say and consequences be damned. Whether the one he was talking to was a barely-tamed Hippogriff or the Great Harry Potter, to Draco Malfoy, it was all the same.
“You were?”
Draco slipped his fingers under the waistband of Harry’s boxers and pulled them down, careful when he reached around front to let Harry’s cock out. It jutted, hard and dripping, right in front of Draco’s face, and Draco fought a wave of lust so strong he would have almost given anything to drop his own trousers and wank frantically to the sight of Harry’s prick facing him.

She throws her hands up. “ I’m telling you, girls. And Draco. I don’t know where all the good people have gone, but they’re not in London anymore, I can assure you.”
“All the Christmas decor is a little too much for my taste,” Blaise eyed the large fir tree with a slight moue of distaste, “but if it makes all of you happy...”
Harry, good, strong, kind-hearted Harry, was sacrificing his future for Draco. He was jeopardising the faith the Ministry was putting in him, all for Draco. If anyone other than their friends found out about their involvement… If anyone found out Harry was having a love affair with Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater and current suspect in a DMLE case… that he’d
“It’s alright.” Draco unrolled his scroll of parchment, nudging Harry to do the same. Slughorn had begun his rounds around the classroom. He dictated today’s lesson, still blissfully oblivious of Draco and Harry’s whispered conversation. “I was wondering why you were taking Advanced Professional Potions this year if it wasn’t part of your career plan.”
“Oh, did you mean—” he lifted a paw, “All hail Lucifer, the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Prince of The World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness?” He gave Draco an exasperated look. “I did announce myself properly. You just chose to ignore me and to listen to the call of your knob instead.”
Scorpius lifts his hand, and the lid of the piano slowly creaks open. Harry stops on the threshold of the room. Watches in stunned silence. Wandless magic so controlled and effortless, even a grown wizard couldn’t have achieved it.
Scorpius was a different kind of conundrum. Harry had had experience shielding Scorpius from his own magic on one occasion and Apparating him to St Mungo’s immediately afterwards. He’d never dealt with the actual aftermath of Scorpius’ flares — Draco had assured him they were extremely rare these days, and only triggered by extreme events unlikely to happen.

Harry had snorted and shaken his head. He was in the mood for sarcasm—that was, until Head Auror Smith had told him he would be assigned the case of the disappearances with Malfoy.
Harry nods slowly, and Draco finally lowers his hand. He takes a step back, walks around Harry’s bed to leave but pauses at the last moment, hand ghosting on the side of the bed, fingering the hospital corner loose. Not looking at Harry, he murmurs, more to himself than to anyone else, “I could never refuse you anything, could I?”
I think coincidences are very unlikely. (But this is a case where facts defy logic.)
“I make fun of you and you make fun of me, remember?”
“I remember,” Harry says. The softness in his voice makes Draco ache. Makes him want to spill everything he’s been holding inside to Harry.
Draco laughs mirthlessly. “You don’t even have a warrant.” It’s not the first time he’s said that, judging by his cold resignation. Harry sees the Auror fidget uncomfortably at that. By the looks of it, they didn’t know about it until they got here, either. “You don’t have anything on me. I don’t owe you anything.”
“We could have, yet when I suggested it, you whinged about rumpling your dress robes. Besides, we’re in London! And I
“The Mediwitches at the Ward told me — Ernestina was too upset to think of mentioning anyone but Scorpius.”
Blaise hugs his wife’s shoulders. “Yeah… you kinda did. But your incapacity to unstick your foot from your mouth is why we all love you.”
“What—?”
Draco stared at him, icy dread filling his chest.
“Actually, no.” It’s Hermione’s turn to look slightly guilty, and Harry’s intrigued. “It does concern Draco Malfoy, but not exactly in the way that you think.”
Harry glowered and followed Longbottom out of the room. “Please be careful, Luna.”
I didn’t
It’s only been a couple of weeks since Scorpius' accident. His magic is still unstable, sometimes rolling off him in waves that feel loud against Harry’s skin, sometimes going quiet for hours. He seems unaffected by the magical turmoil, though. Harry, as always, is utterly impressed with the boy’s resilience. Scorpius takes a breath, puts his hands on the keys, and a lilting, melancholy melody rises from the piano. The assembled guests fall silent. Even though Harry has heard it before — Scorpius has been practising ceaselessly for weeks — he still holds his breath while the child plays. Around him, the guests look on, equally mesmerised. Pansy squeezes Blaise’s hand between her own. Hermione has her mouth open. Ron holds a forgotten canapé between thumb and middle finger. Narcissa and Ernestina both discreetly dab at their eyes with handkerchiefs. And behind the sofa, Draco stands with his arms folded and an expression so proud Harry has to look away, like he’s witnessed something hidden, intimate.
“Bitsy?” squeaks Ron.
“Okay,” Draco says, cautious. “So we're doing this.”
“Stop. Calling. Me.
“Oh.” Harry lifted an eyebrow. “So you won’t sneak boastful details about how good a lay I am in your article about Luna?”
“Mmh,” Harry said. For all the many, many times he had almost died—and the one time he actually had—he’d never thought of asking himself this question. Actually, nobody had ever thought of asking him this question. Most people walked on eggshells around him.
“You do? Oh, Harry, that would be brilliant if he did!”
And then… it had all gone up in smoke. Was it something that Harry’d said? Or done? Had Harry been so bad in bed that Malfoy had run away in the middle of the night? But Malfoy had liked it… he’d said it… Harry hadn’t been with a man before, but — not to flatter himself — he didn’t think a man could fake the kind of explosive orgasm that had raked through Malfoy while Harry had fucked him.
On Sunday morning, Draco woke up feeling rested and refreshed. He hadn’t had a nightmare all night, something that hadn’t happened to him since Voldemort had moved into his parents’ house two summers ago.
No. It was because I’m actually gay.
Tsk. Didn’t I mention something about reckless Gryffindors, last time?
“I know,” Harry says softly. “So can I.”
“I’m going to make myself breakfast. Do you need me for the day? Jemima didn’t send me an agenda yesterday.”
“I, er, wanted to ask you something.”
“Your kid… you didn’t tell me,” Harry says.
I hope you take this as the compliment and the peace offering it is.
Draco had ever met—was utterly ludicrous.
My friend Cecilia took me to the play. You don’t know her. She’s a
Harry shakes his head against Draco’s shirt. He knows he won’t go. He knows nothing he can do will make any of it easier.
“I hope they don’t find out,” Harry says. “Not yet, anyway. This is still… so new to me. I need to take my time.”
“You lost people.
“...er, Draco?”
He steps into the dining room, pushing a hand through his wet, messy curls, hoping last night’s activities aren’t too obvious on his ridiculously contented face, when movement across the room makes him stop short. Instinctively, he holds his breath, draws his wand and points it—
and I didn’t. What can I say, I’m a slut for your massive cock. Let’s get dressed, shall we?”
“You don’t have to apologise,” he told Draco, voice low. “I... I know what you’ve been through. I’m not saying you were never awful to me and my friends, but... the war had us all do some pretty fucked-up shite.” He nodded sharply at the look Draco gave him. “Yeah, even me. Mental, huh?” He gave a rueful, crooked little smile. “What I’m saying is... I think you’ve changed. You’ve changed your mind. About me, and about a lot of other things. Am I wrong?”
“I wouldn’t mind,” he tells Harry, softly.
Draco leant in, pressing his lips to the right side of Harry's jawline. “Let me tell you what I’m going to do, Harry.” He nipped lightly at Harry's earlobe before pulling Harry’s t-shirt up over his head, knocking his glasses off. “First, I’m going to put this pesky t-shirt over here.” He threw the t-shirt onto a chair.
Will you
Draco pushed in.
-Harry
“Oh, don’t rush! I’m putting the kettle on!” Luna waved her wand and conjured two tea cups. “Let’s make you a cuppa. And Harry, too. Here.” Luna gave a cup to Draco, and the other one to Harry once he finished drying his hands.
Harry and Ernestina turn around at the same time to find Malfoy standing at the bottom of the stairs leading down to the kitchen.
He lifts one hand from his lap to fiddle with the handle of his mug of tea without looking at Harry. Harry isn’t sure what to say next, or even if he should say anything. Draco looks almost lost in thought, a swathe of blond hair falling across his eyes, obscuring his face. Eventually, Harry leans forward, touching Malfoy’s shoulder with the tips of his fingers.
Malfoy rises to his full height. The light is dim, but Harry doesn’t miss the flash in his eyes.
“I can,” Harry says finally. “I might be making the worst mistake of my career, but I trust you. Whatever goddamned intuition it is… I trust you. Just — let me stay with you.”
“Yes?”
I can’t get you out of my head, Draco Malfoy. I never could.
“When?” Harry asks.
[frowns, gestures]
Harry is quiet for a while, and eventually Draco dares open his eyes again. When he does, Harry nudges his nose with his.
He realises too late that the remark might have been insensitive, because Ernestina throws him a bristling look.
is. Most of all, though, he’s starting to think he’s failing Draco.
“I did some thinking of my own,” Draco said. He picked a piece of napkin between thumb and forefinger and pulled. The paper tore with a satisfying ripping sound. “You know, when I was working on the personality and career tests with Harry. The same results kept coming up, test after test: the same answers, so obvious I barely had time to finish my spells that it already jumped out of the page. This constant appeal of words, of details, of creative thinking. I’m not sure what I’m going to write about. Still, I
“No?” Narcissa’s tone is soft but deadly. A snake among high grass. “Are you going to stand here and insist that you are not actually involved with my son, Mr Potter?”
