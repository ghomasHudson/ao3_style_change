Harry didn’t so much laugh as groan, throaty and low; in a brazen speed, he caught the back of Draco’s neck firmly - not that Draco planned to go anywhere, he’d be quite content tucking his head in the slope of Harry’s shoulder for the rest of his life - and bucked up. They both stuttered a tortured sound.
. Harry’s tongue slipped inside for a taste, catching the burn of vodka, and Draco let out a low growl, a sound meant to
, that he’d forgotten how to do it. Perhaps it would hurt more, but he’d apply enough practice, and soon it would all seem as natural as breathing. Just a few days, yes, a few days where he’d stay primly away from Potter and his friends, and then it would all go back to normal, and he’d analyse this situation with Hermione with fresh eyes, maybe even ask Pansy for advice, and he’d get everything sorted out. Nothing worse had to happen. Nothing that terrible
No more grass nor coarse scarlet swallowing him up: now, slim tender limbs rested on soft white covers. He looked frail, which was an odd look on Harry - beautiful, perhaps, in its vulnerability. Beautiful as the stem of a flower that curves ever so slightly and makes one think of holy things; and as the stem leads the gaze up to an explosion of colour, so did Harry’s body lead to the hypnotizing liveliness of his eyes, bright green against the despairingly tame white, brimming with all the strength that had faded from the rest of him. If he were asleep, he would have looked dead. With his eyes opened, he was the purest illustration of life.
When they were out of the bar, and the music was just a distant murmuring on the cold, lonely street, he huffed:
'You fucking idiot,' he snorted and moved to lace his arm over Ron's hunched shoulders. 'It's alright, mate, I reckon it'll be quite the surprise for Slughorn.'
'Hermione said you ran out as soon as she left,' Potter noted, taking a step further. Draco tensed his jaw, but very pointedly did not look away. Of course Granger had said that - Draco bet they'd all had a good laugh about it. 'You do know we can be in the same room together, right? The war's over, Malfoy. No real sense in being rivals anymore.'
Hermione turned so her shoulder was now against the wall and she was better facing Draco. Her features had crisped into something concerned.
‘You’ve paid me no mind all night,’ Draco retorted. ‘You’re here for one of those insufferable little sun rays, aren’t you?’
Draco hummed, smoothing his hands down Harry’s sides and pretending he wasn’t incredibly embarrassed.
‘Is that so?’ Draco quirked a brow; there was an aura of discomfort around the table now that he was very intrigued to explore. ‘Never have I ever had sex.’
And so, Draco pressed his back against the glass, letting himself be swept into a world of measurements and technique. Behind him, snow began to fall, swaying slowly in the air, painting the window white.
They left in a fit with Dean and Alicia hurrying behind them. The rest of them moved to the living area. Some squeezed into the ragged peach sofa; Ginny took an armchair; Harry and Neville hopped onto a sturdy table; Draco, who hadn’t wanted to intrude in case there was an ordinary sitting arrangement, and Fletchley sat on the nasty rug, leaning against the coffee table.
Harry's laugh shook his entire body; their cocks rubbed against each other through their clothes, and they both bit off a moan.
So he didn’t tense, neither did he waste time with some lame pretense of nonchalance. Instead, he looked down at Harry, eyes soft with fondness, and said:
He looked at Harry, mostly so he’d stop glaring at Ginny, and saw him downing one of his shots - and he knew Potter was, for whatever reason, mad at him, but it was difficult to just ignore him, specially when he was so
Harry got the most innocent of flavours: chocolate, which he revealed to the group with partial bitterness, already glancing at Draco with expectant eyes.
Harry’s laugh was a gentle, ticklish thing against his chest. ‘Yeah, alright. Sob quietly, would you?’
And he was lifting a hand to rub self-consciously at his skin when Harry caught it midway, stilled it on the mattress under the palm of his and leaned in for another kiss. Slower now, since he knew it was welcomed; softer, since they both knew it was real.
‘I like Pansy,’ Harry shrugged. ‘I don’t know about Zabini, though. He always looks like he’s plotting.’
'This really was an excellent idea,' he murmured with a dark smirk, catching an earlobe between his teeth and rolling the little tender nub of flesh with his tongue. It flashed the vision of him doing the same to Harry's nipples, just like he'd done in the Potions classroom, toying with sensitive flesh, showing Harry how pleasant it could be - because Harry would be diligent when he jerked off, Draco
Pansy gave him a discomfited smile, raising her shot high. 'Cheers,' she said, and downed it. It convulsed in her neck, twitched in her lips, and Draco followed suit, letting the liquid burn acid in his mouth. When he put down the empty glass, there was a throbbing between his eyebrows, and Pansy was definitely too close, everything else blurry.
Draco shrugged. He hadn’t helped in anything, really. At best he’d saved some uncoordinated lump of limbs like Finnigan from getting into the storage room.
'What were you doing that was so loud?' Neville asked, something frightened in his eyes. Of course, because everyone, after all this time, still feared the Slytherins.
Hermione, for all her intellectual talents, had never been the best at dishonesty - her expression, as she walked up to them with the Longbottom boy in tow, was the purest form of surprise. Comical, really, all raised brows and slack mouth, gaze skittering between Draco and their surroundings, as if believing them incompatible.
‘You haven’t done much teaching yet,’ Harry snorted, and then he was pushing him away with a hand on his chest and turning back to the neglected potion, arse grazing teasingly against Draco’s growing erection. ‘Quit touching me or we’ll never be done with this.’
‘He’s giving us the wrong instructions?’ Harry asked, eyes burning - most likely wondering how unfair it’d be for his
This time, Harry couldn’t regain control. He tried to grab the broom with both arms, but as soon as the hand from his injured arm circled the smooth wood he withdrew it like he’d been burnt. With only one hand, and less than thirty feet from the ground, there was no way to escape the fall: he seemed to realize this, and he turned in a strange way, contorting his body so that, when he clashed with the ground, he fell with his already battered arm first, a sickening crack echoing through the field.
Draco looked around. The dust seemed like quite a bearable inconvenience now that he was presented with the possibility of Harry sucking him off.
Blaise’s demeanour, on the other side, didn’t waver - never did, the power of the vain. He simply twitched his lips into an amused smile, tone a sardonic singsong when he mused:
. I know you’re unfamiliar with the concept,’ Draco retorted, forcing himself to turn away from Potter and focus on the crammed shelves once more. He was actually being regretfully reckless - he’d drunk too much lobe-blaster in a fit of nerves, and he kept misplacing the jars ever so slightly, too blurry-minded to remember their precise position.
all the time. I was a fucking kid, it’s not because I was in love that I knew what to do with it. If my father told me I should hate Harry, why wouldn’t I believe him?’
‘Don’t be such a prude, then,’ Draco smirked, flicking one of the nubs again to make him hiss. ‘Say it.’
He was answered with a chuckle, and then the door was being closed before him, and Draco was back by himself on the shadowed corner, just a little flushed himself, just a little shaking, because Potter and he had been
‘For Merlin’s sake,' Draco sighed, trying to balance out the flush he felt on his skin, ‘I said I wanted to make you smile - that
'Two shots of firewhiskey. Three, actually,' he told the waiter in the stodgy new pub, Kettle Bottom.
The group had decided to find a comfortable spot at the Three Broomsticks. When they were halfway there, however, Harry halted, yanking at Draco’s arm, and spoke loud enough most of them could hear:
‘How romantic,’ Draco mused. It wasn’t too upsetting a confession: he perfectly remembered the wobble in Harry’s step, the way his eyes had shined as bright as the glitter around them. He wouldn’t dwell over a drunken kiss - alcohol, in some respects, could be a fortunate catalyser.
Harry laughed, and the vibrations down his body, right to where they were locked together, made them both moan.
‘Do you want me to?’ Harry asked - coy behind the tease, Draco could see it in his eyes, and wasn’t that absurd?
Draco, in turn, stared hopeless at the bathroom for a moment, then at where Potter was just starting down the steps.
'He knocked over an armour,' Draco drawled, just to see if Harry laughed. He did, a crooked-lip thing that the others echoed, and that made Ron flush anew.
‘You do look a little green, Draco,’ Neville interjected, eyes so wide, so bloody eager to help that it chipped at Draco’s resolve.
apology in that cramped, noisy, ungodly place, but then Hermione was reaching out for his arm and leading him out the suffocating crowd by the bar. They didn’t head to the table either; she brought them to a corner, next to the narrow corridor where the loos were, less crowded and dimmer, a refreshing break from the hectic energy at the center of the pub. The act felt strangely intimate, seeing as they’d been bickering just a little while ago, and Draco couldn’t quite believe that he was having a private chat with Hermione Granger in a pub, could hardly believe that was his life, but he wasn’t going to complain just yet.
‘Malfoy! Parkinson! Good evening to ya,’ Finnigan greeted. His chin was so low in his smile that it practically dangled from his face. Not drunk, however. Like a violin string, ever tightly wound, now shaken by a careless finger. Sugar high.
'No?' he asked, and he could have said something else - would have, and it would have been unbearably sentimental, by the sickly sweet taste already on his tongue, but then there was a crash, a high-pitched laugh coming from the stalls.
to live in it,’ Harry sighed, squeezing himself closer in the crook of Draco’s arm. Draco smiled, kissing his head softly.
Then again, just like Harry had said, the last time he’d had such a thought Harry had ended up in the infirmary.
He inched away just enough that they could change positions - Draco with the table edge digging in the back of his thighs, Harry closing him in. And then Harry slithered down, shirtless and flushed and panting, that oxymoronic elegance brimming with energy, holding the waistband of his slacks, and Draco’s cock pulsed painfully hard in its confines. Harry was close enough to breathe against it, such an irresistible tease with his red spit-slick lips, and, when Draco brought a hesitant hand to grab at his hair and Harry looked up at him, Draco couldn’t even believe it was real.
‘Well, I did,’ Harry smiled. He tipped his head towards the professors’ table on the other end of the Great Hall. ‘D’you think any of them saw it?’
‘How’d it go for you? I reckon it was stellar, all you Slytherins are cracks at potions,’ Dean laughed. ‘Well, you won’t believe what happened to us. It was the strangest thing - Harry, you know, we were doing some cramming last night, and he comes in with this old book he got in the- well, nevermind where he got it, but he had it, yeah? And we were skimming through it, and it was all these outdated versions of potions - Amortentia, Mopsus,
, an utterly unremarkable casualness - that meant Dean thought of him just the same as always. Nothing had changed. Harry hadn’t told him. Draco reckoned he hadn’t told anyone.
After all, Draco knew he was bad at potions - the bloody idiot couldn’t be bothered to do his measurings twice, even with unicorn hair, which was such a fickle ingredient; he stirred clockwise when the instructions stated counter-clock, because ‘how in the bloody hell will the potion know?’; he got distracted and shook the cauldron with a restless knee, he hardly listened to Slughorn’s explanations and then, when he needed help, he’d ask people like
Back at the table, Harry found two chairs for them and they sat in a little huddle besides Sue and Alicia. It was much easier to return to his prior calm there, immersed in the light, inconsequential chatter, Harry breathing steady and with a small, constant smile right by his side.The topic shifted back to Slughorn’s test and the actual effects of Alihotsy. Dean said he’d wanted to try it, just to see what it felt like, but he’d been too afraid he’d run out of breath and faint right in front of the professor. With a very privately amused smile, Harry mentioned that the Gillyweed would have kept him safe.
He stood, though reluctantly. It made his erection shift uncomfortable and neglected in the confines of his clothes, and he felt unbearably awkward, not knowing what to do, how close he could stand, if he was still allowed to kiss Harry.
He tried to sleep and was overcome with restlessness. He’d look out the frosted window from his bed and wonder if the group was at Hogsmeade that exact moment, walking the streets without him.
After he forced himself to drink a bit more of the wretched liquid, he turned the keys on the small lock. It opened with a smooth click, a straightforward swing of the door inwards. The space was small, cramped, lined with shelves from floor to ceiling. The smell, likely nauseating to some, of conserves and dust and old brews, felt comforting to Draco.
Idly, Draco nodded. He was sure Seamus was lying, though he’d acted convincingly enough. It seemed to Draco a bit impossible that someone
Blaise let out a virtuous laugh that reverberated pleasantly throughout the warm, dimly lit room. He too looked especially aware of his appearance that night: a glimpse of something silk and purple peered through the sides of the cloak, and his skin glistened dark and rich like molten chocolate. He was looking to impress, it was clear.
Draco swooped down immediately. They rushed through the air, dark shadows across the grey sky; the shouts from the other players became louder as they approached, a mess of brooms and limbs and the dangerous hiss from the Quaffle and the Bludger; Harry was a blur, small and curved over his broomstick with that single-minded elegance, that impressive, confident speed Draco had always admired, and he couldn’t quite match it, couldn’t reach him, and he was still a few feet away when Pike, chasing the Quaffle, swerved in front of Harry, making him halt too quickly, too abruptly - he pulled his broomstick up, up, almost vertically; in the sickly slow speed at which one watches a tragedy unfold, Harry couldn’t stop the momentum and fell backwards, still clinging to his broom, pirouetting towards the grass.
Draco could feel Harry’s eyes tracking his hand as he unashamedly picked up his drink, and he smirked against the brim of his glass. Let him wonder who Draco had done that for; let him know Draco was up for that, because he bloody was, because he’d noticed Harry hadn’t drunk and it’d risen in him a surge of curiosity and hunger. Fuck, he wanted to be Harry’s first, Harry’s
‘Weasley, please never tell me what goes on in the bedroom with Granger,’ he said, mainly to distract his mind, and was rewarded with Harry’s laughter.
‘Does Harry?’ he asked at last, just to hear it, just to know more. The name - ‘Harry’, not ‘Potter’ - sounded too soft and too vulnerable coming from his mouth.
As their orgasms approached, so too did their laughter worsen, replacing the usual moans and grunts. Lustful bled into hysterical, urgency spilled from their tongues until they were hoarse and writhing against each other, their stomachs twisted tight, their breaths insufficient wisps through reddened noses. Pain worse than pleasure - then the inverse, ever shifting, maddening.
team, so Potter could dive off his bloody broom and break every bone in his body for all Draco cared. He’d hardly be watching.
They began picking their flavours to the right of Neville. Ginny - and Draco would admit he thoroughly enjoyed the fact - got the taste of a dirty sock, and washed it down quite eagerly with one of the many neon bright shots that had arrived. Fletchley, cursed to be invariably boring, got strawberry. Dean Thomas impulsively asked him the same question: after a tense pause, Finnigan, again, was the response. Someone asked Luna which House she would rather be in if it weren’t for Ravenclaw, to which Luna unexpectedly - and after only one millisecond of thought - chose Slytherin. Hermione risked a greyish one that turned out to be mold; Ron went for a fluorescent green which, according to him, tasted either of sewers or corianders. Draco got the bottom of an ashtray, and squeezed Harry’s shoulder as he downed a shot.
‘Bastard,’ Blaise cried, stepping away from Pike in one of his flourished movements. Pike, the smitten fool, seemed genuinely sad for a moment. ‘Now, Draco, hurry and put on a nicer shirt. Say what you’d like about my sweet Rowena, but at least she’s not spending her night at school.’
Draco very primly pretended that he hadn’t been staring at Harry’s back all class, and that his presence there at least
, only Draco, no one else… He was going to ask it, and have his arm around him the whole time to feel him tense and shiver and hopefully begin to harden at the thought, desperate under the table for Draco to see. He was going to make him regret ever challenging him, and then make it up to him in the bathroom a few rounds later.
As it was, Draco simply hummed around the abused nipple, catching it very gently between his teeth and flicking it with his tongue. The noise Harry made was wrecked, his hips trying to move under Draco's weight. Really, it ought to be quite frustrating - at least Draco got to grind his hard dick against the mattress. Draco didn't let up, however; the point of this, after all, was to make Harry
Ron’s smile was smug. ‘I fucking told you. Come on, drink up, mates. No way that someone survived the war without at least a scar.’
It was unfair, because the question had been designed to make Harry uncomfortable, and now Draco was the one hot and bothered in that table, pressed against Ron’s side and hopeless to imagine all the things Harry liked or not, all the things he’d let Ginny do to him, or did to Ginny, or would let Draco do to him, while Harry was drinking with the overly friendly irish travesty that was Seamus Finnigan, most likely squeezed against him in the cramped bar, and laughing drunkenly at him, their arms laced around each other, those glittery eyelids batting so prettily for that
Harry's smile went utterly warm at that, and his fingers trailed down Draco's arms almost temptatively.
‘I used to sit here at dawn,’ he guided Harry to the exact spot with a soft hold on his elbow. ‘The sun rises over the trees, I liked the sight. And I’d be here,’ they stood over the snow and turned to watch the lake, ‘And Pansy would come find me. I’d brood - about you.’
Goyle, who’d taken a seat at the armchair closest to the blooming flames, looked up with a frown. Blaise’s smile was slow and accusatory.
'A Friday night without alcohol, though,' he mused, words carefully light as he stepped closer to Harry. 'I'm sure it's the first one you've had in a while. Is it too terrible?'
‘Bullshit,’ Draco pushed the treacle tart box onto Harry's hands and shrugged out of his peacoat. ‘Here, before you freeze.’
it, probably didn't think Draco meant anything by it, probably just thought it sweet, and Draco could definitely give him sweet, sicklier than those nasty treacle tarts, and it'd still only be a fraction of what he felt.
Harry's eyes were moving wildly across Draco's face, excited, restless, pupils blown - and what the fuck did that mean? How the hell was it conceivable in any fucking universe that Harry was like this, beautiful and flushed and
'No, you weren't,' he said, softer than he'd spoken before, and delighted in the little smile that elicited.
‘About so,’ Draco conceded. They’d finally reached them by the door - inside, over the sound of gentle music, he could hear the intermittent voices of the rest of the group. He searched for a glimpse of Harry, but only got one of Sue. ‘Dean invited me out.’
Harry’s tone was light; like reciting a mildly amusing fact. Draco walked around his bed, settling, after a second of hesitation, on a chair by its side.
Maybe they did, and Draco didn’t notice - Harry’s lips, for all their unnatural pinkness, like he bit and chewed them at all times, like blood was bubbling just under the skin, were nowhere close to the neon red of Luna’s lipstick. Yes, if Harry’s lips were that red, then his smiles would all shine brighter, always indiscreet, just like with the phoenix glitter, which had made his eyes jump out so impossibly vulnerable, and Draco could catalog them all in his mind, commit them to memory, strive to make them so frequent that his face hurt.
Draco didn’t actually know if that was true. He’d watched, in fourth year - spent the entirety of the Yule Ball ogling Harry while Pansy’s hand dangled from his shoulder, cataloguing his steps, his laughs, the hesitant way in which he’d held onto Parvati’s waist. He’d noticed the shy awkwardness of it: the delicate movements confined Harry, he urged to move wider, surer, he ended up missing steps and grinding teeth. Because he was young - and mostly because he was in love -, Draco had been terribly self-involved, and assumed Harry simply needed a better dance partner. Someone who’d lead until Harry got the hang of it, someone who’d hold him tight lest he go astray, someone who’d perhaps tease, yes, but only to distract themselves from how
It was also something Potter had given him. For the first few days, he’d felt the thrumming of his magic there. A dark bond between them, blood and hurt - something, in any sense. For Draco, in sixth year, when everything else was crumbling around him, it had felt like an anchor to the world.
There was no answer, only another chaste press of lips against his skin and then overwhelming quiet. With his nose buried in Harry’s hair and their limbs entwined, with their breathing in tandem and sleep lulling them both, the tears never did fall. They burnt right at the edge of Draco’s eyes, smoldered by a fire of scarlet and gold.
Harry laughed, kissed him chastely and bid them goodbye again by the door. Then, they were stepping into the night, Harry was turning back into the pub, and it was just Draco, Hermione and Neville, the most stunted of groups under the moonlight. Of course, they were too golden-hearted to look annoyed over the whole thing, and they helped him through every step and corner, into Hogwarts and right down to the dungeons, where they eventually left him alone with unbearably kind,
idea, like Draco was the only one who'd noticed how short Potter was, how fidgety he could be when there was no one to ground him, how much he needed someone's arm around
'Yeah?' Harry laughed, breathless, digging his nails into Draco's shoulders. If Draco had a little more confidence, he could have easily lifted Harry, felt his legs around his waist - but as it was, he was still too unsure of what he was
They counted down and drank their shots. It wasn’t Daisyroot this time; it burnt and itched like Firewhiskey.
'No need to look so worried,' Pansy rolled her eyes and forcefully entwined their arms, pushing him forward so their pace quickened, 'I merely started talking to them, and then, when they were counting heads before they left, I mentioned that we were waiting for you. They're all quite drunk, Draco, no one thought much of it.'
- it was only fair, really, in Draco’s mind, since his own attention was invariably on Potter. Aggression wasn’t an option anymore, however, and there weren’t many other ways to justifiably twist his fingers in Harry’s shirt like he so desperately craved, so he just sat there stewing, bobbing one angulous knee impatiently, and staring as he laughed and spoke so carefree, so breathtaking in his happiness, all tousled hair and crooked glasses, a lovely blush on his cheeks.
'Look who it is,' Pansy smirked, angling her head towards the left corner, where Potter seemed to be in the middle of a riveting conversation with the two younger Weasleys, Lovegood and a few indistinct faces.
‘We could go to Honeydukes,’ said Luna in her usual serene tone. A whispering of excitement spread through the scattered group. ‘It’s closer than Hog’s Head.’
Draco was drunk, and he'd been on edge all night, and he'd been paranoid since birth: the thought occurred to him that perhaps this was a game. Perhaps Harry's fingers would sink into his chest now and pull out his pathetically hopeful heart, all saccharine flourishes and idiotic dreams of love, and laugh at its softness, the way it pumped meek and trusting in his palm.
‘None of your business, Malfoy,’ Ron muttered, at the same time as Seamus bit out a passionate ‘Sod off’.
'Will you let it go? It was in second year,' Harry huffed, obviously impatient, and wasn't that such a lovely sight? 'Besides, it's not like I had time to go exploring.'
'Be patient, Potter,' he drawled, though he was sneaking one hand down to palm his own straining erection. 'We're going to make it last, remember?'
looks. A bloody embarrassing ordeal, and Draco couldn’t stop thinking about it even as he stumbled into the dorms, wrestled out of his clothes and slipped into bed. He almost prayed that absinthe was the type of alcohol that turned nights into blurry, fickle things, so he could forget the entire thing. In the end, though, he couldn’t properly wish it, only because the rest of the night had been so
Draco’s worst, which was really quite too tempting, since Draco was certain Harry was filled with little secrets he’d blush so prettily for if he was made to spill them aloud.
speaking to Draco. At all. And it wasn’t like Draco was entirely shut out: there were other conversations, with Neville for example, whose irises were glistening an eerie red and gold, or those fools Thomas and Finnigan, who had both charmed their skin half of each Gryffindor colour, or Luna, whom he genuinely liked. But every conversation where Harry was involved seemed to swim away from him. He’d take a sip of his drink for courage, intervene with something small and attentive, and Harry wouldn’t quite look at him, nor draw those smiles, and he’d find himself feeling rejected for no explicit reason. He could still feel his warmth and hear him talk and feel his body shake against his with laughter, but he felt distant nonetheless.
he'd make sure every inch of Harry was attended to, skin prickly and overstimulated, pink, sweaty, his nipples sucked red and aching until his eyes were glistening the most delicious shade of desperate. But he didn't have the time, nor exactly the most adequate surface, and he didn't like the thought of taking off Harry's shirt and exposing his already freezing skin to the air.
- Harry Potter on his knees, figuring out how to properly suck him off - and Draco was embarrassingly close to the edge.
Harry was by the Hufflepuff tower, staring at the grass far below him. Behind him rose the dark, striking walls of Hogwarts.
But maybe he wouldn’t get bored of him at all. Draco could allow himself to hope, couldn’t he? They were good together, they were
At the Three Broomsticks, the group was gathered around one of the tables, a circular one that was too small for the lot of them, which meant they’d pulled up some chairs haphazardly around it. Their bags of sweets were pooled in the center, surrounded by a wall of drinks, and mostly emptied. At first sight, they seemed like they’d reached the phase of drunk that ebbs into a dazed lull, and they spoke in hushed, fickle strings.
Malfoy, I think I know where it is,’ Harry urged. Draco flattened against one of the walls with his eyebrows raised, and watched as Harry fiddled with the wooden ladder before climbing up to peer at the higher shelves. He was short; he had to climb quite high, his feet sliding restless on the rung, and Draco had half a mind to steady him with a hand on his calf, but he couldn’t bring himself to close the distance.
He was panting by the end of it. Draco could see the marvel in his eyes - did he honestly think it’d been pure luck? That Potter - devious, dishonest, insufferable,
Harry didn't - he sat at the foot of it, legs dangling, and looked up at him with ill-hidden impatience.
'The rumours seemed pretty convincing, Draco. One too many shots of firewhiskey, is what I heard. Always does you in, firewhiskey. No wonder Potter was down to fuck any living-'
When he heard a hiss of air beside him, he was half expecting - half hoping - it to be Harry. He turned, however, to see ever-infuriating red hair, and Ginny’s eyes regarding him cooly.
to talk to us?’ she retorted, a cold sharpness in her stance, ‘This is none of your business, Malfoy. We’ve done this before, and we were fine.’
Harry laughed, idly nuzzling his cock. At this point, Draco was considering just stroking himself over the edge - just twice, all it would take - and coming all over Harry’s soft, pretty face.
Harry snorted before taking a sip of his own tea. His nose scrunched a little - must have scalded his tongue. But the chamomile was good, rich and calming, a definite improvement from everything else they’d ever drunk together.
The following round, it was Draco who got a harmless flavour. Lemon - awfully similar to the flavour of Harry’s lips.
Still, telling her so would do no good. What terrible things would come of Pansy knowing just how influential she could be to Draco.
And he brought Harry's fingers to the slick, puffy nub. Harry groaned when he ghosted over it, flinched away, Draco guided his fingers back patiently.
I could see your point. Mostly I knew you were wrong, mind you, but sometimes I knew you were right. And it was that… that seeing but not fully understanding...’ Harry’s eyes were digging into him, meaningful, like he knew his own words were unfit and hoped to balance their lack with the sheer intensity of his liquid gaze. ‘I liked that, and I just knew I loved you.’
'Fuck, faster,' Harry gasped, his head dropped to Draco's shoulder. He was bucking into Draco's fist, frenzied, trembling, nearing his edge.
‘I could tell you the same thing,’ Draco scoffed. ‘Don’t do anything stupid. For Merlin’s sake, keep yourself alive.
'What a bloody stupid thing to say,' he sniggered. His step was a little slurred, his cheeks flushed, his glasses askew.
Goyle was the first to spot them. He sauntered towards them in a striped suit, bow tie digging into his broad neck, took one good look at Harry and asked:
'Do you remember the first time I made you come?' Draco asked, almost lighthearted, though his tone was wrecked. He made no move to quicken his strokes. 'Harry? Answer.'
She’d said it so ruthlessly - she’d said it knowing how much it would hurt. And she’d said it with a vicious honesty that made Draco feel so suddenly unfit, like he truly was an intruder there, unwelcome and imposing, some obsessed, ogling maniac Harry would never want around.
plan. He hadn’t been curious, he hadn’t wanted the veritaserum for anything. If Harry wasn’t there, he wouldn’t have done it. He would have stayed behind, most likely with the ever-trembling Neville, and watched from afar. He was never this reckless, this impulsive, this bloody
He found him at last alone in one of the corridors, inspecting a box of treacle tarts with a furrowed brow.
‘You hardly have to beg,’ he drawled, but the little hushed word, uttered so desperate from Harry’s mouth, stirred an obscene darkness in him. They switched positions - Harry straddled him, his eyes frighteningly intense in a mix of lust and hysteria, and pushed Draco’s slacks and underwear down, wrapping a hand around his cock. Before he could press his lips to it, Draco stopped him with fingers curled around his hair.
He was pretty sure Harry Potter was the only person that could make him indifferent to how undignified he looked.
He didn't seem to want to talk about it any further. He finished his first tart and moved on to the second one with equal hunger. In the descending silence, Draco scrambled for words. He found himself speechless, this close to Harry, sitting in the same bed as him, like some fumbling preteen wanting to hold hands, which was just incomprehensible - hadn’t he had his fingers in Harry’s hair less than twelve hours ago? His moans in his mouth, his body shaking against his, he’d swallowed him unashamedly. How could this innocence - completely platonic, nothing at all - bother him now?
‘Are we going then, chaps?’ came a honeyed voice. Harper was leaning against the stone archway leading to the dormitories.
And he was moving forward, like he hadn’t been flying at full speed after all, like he’d been holding back as a
There was a pulse of silence. Then, almost reluctantly, Harry inched closer until their chests were flushed once more.
It made something catch in Draco's throat. That expanse of air that precedes a sob - like the ones he'd choked on every night throughout sixth grade, after Potter had cast Sectumsempra on him -, except the sob never came. It just dug into muscle, its weight a constant ache.
- Harry’s side was rigid now, tense, his arms crossed around himself as if to dispel the notion that one of them had once been linked with Draco’s, and his eyes surveyed the cramped bar from under furrowed brows.
Once more, Harry tried to shrug. The movement came out stunted, his broken arm barely moving under the covers - it seemed to irritate him, a groove digging in between his eyebrows.
Draco couldn't glimpse at a red and golden tie without thinking of him; he'd spot a redhead in the corridors and remember immediately of the Weasleys, and then of him; he'd pass the Fat Lady and wonder where he was; during storms, at night, whenever he heard thundering he was overcome with visions of his skin.
, anything to prolong their time together, to keep his mouth shut regarding Slughorn’s own indiscretions.
Potter styled it - if Potter even touched that bird's nest at all; to be the one Harry leaned against when he had too much to drink; to not have to loiter outside, alone in Hogsmeade, but to be sitting at that seedy booth right next to him, even if that meant enduring his other friends; to get to rest an arm around him, feeling his warm breath against his neck; to be the only one Harry ever wanted to tug toward the dance floor.
were, and Harry’s mouth held the gentle fragrance of lemons, and his fingers were firm on his neck, and Harry Potter was kissing him in a bloody common street in a bloody common night, and Draco loved him so much he was dizzy with it.
Through his reflection in the mirror, Draco could see that Harry was trying not to laugh. He was so close - hadn’t Draco been in one of those stalls a minute ago, determined to never be that close to Potter ever again? Just a while ago he’d been terrified, slowing his breathing while another couple kissed a few inches from him, on the other side of the graffitied stall door. What on
it that your dates get here?’ urged Blaise. It was the third time he repeated the question - his tone grew more and more petulant by the second.
The Gryffindor common room wasn’t quite as cosy as the Slytherin one. Too much light. Scarlet too offensive on the eye. Bothersome, really. Ron led him to the dorms without another word, his back always firmly turned. Draco didn’t quite mind: his confessions had left a bitter taste in his tongue, doomed to poison any further word.
want him there? Should he even go, if all he’d get out of it was a mildly disappointed expression by Harry, and a night orbiting helplessly around him?
Three pairs of eyes settled on Draco as he cut through the conversation. It was Neville who answered:
'That's- Draco, fuck,' Harry breathed, grinding up against Draco's chest. Draco pressed him against the mattress, trapping him where he could hardly squirm. It wouldn't do anyone good to have Harry come so soon, after all. Harry twisted his hair to the right, trying to move his head - his
But it wasn’t like Draco could just lean over the rest of the way and kiss him. The Charms classroom, with its walls stacked with forgotten library books, its desks harbouring perpetual mounts of lost quills and professor Flitwik forever hurrying in and out, wasn’t exactly the discreetest of places.
Draco froze with his lips on the brim of their glass. Slowly, and with his face reddening, he withdrew from it.
‘Can you?’ Harry countered, an eyebrow raised - and Draco couldn’t, could think of little else than leaning over the desk between them and kissing him, pulling him close by the collar, making him arch and moan until the snow had melted off his shoulders. But that wasn’t new. It pulsed with renewed intensity, perhaps, but he’d long ago learnt to tame it. What
It was a solid thing that didn’t intend to move: a silent statement shared between lips. It lingered. Draco pursued it, seeking, reeling, for it’d been the first time he’d tasted Harry with the wind on him, gelid and sure and open. The first time they kissed like others kissed. There came the memory of that faceless couple holding hands in that first night in Hogsmeade, when he’d been bitter and hopeless - now, here he was, here
They each brought the small spoons to their mouths. The hot pink stuff amounted to around a gulp’s worth, precisely like a shot, slipping quick and painful down their throats. Bitter from the Baneberry. Ginger undertones. Giggly somehow - in taste, in texture, in essence, he didn’t know. Like a fragrance from within, spring perfumed, wisping up from the base of his tongue to the inside of his nose, bubbling there in the sudden wish to laugh.
Predictably, everyone drank - even Weasley, who seemed to take it in stride. And Draco looked at this group, half-heartedly irked, stifling their laughter against the edges of their glasses, and was perplexed at the relative lightness of the situation. Here they were, surrounded by brightness and screaming and life, speaking of the war so casually, simple strategy for a drinking game.
Harry was clutching his arm. His glasses had slipped, hanging off one ear, and he wasn’t even holding onto the broom, swinging perilously as his thighs clenched around it. Draco’s heart constricted - why hadn’t the bloody twat listened to him and sat the game out?
‘Well, you confessed first. During sex of all times,’ Harry’s smile was wicked. ‘So yeah, you’re first now too.’
a life composed of perfect first times. Maybe every other first time would belong to someone other than Draco: the morning would come, and Harry would be properly hungover and sensible, and tell him to forget the whole thing, and keep nothing more of this drunken memory except for a newfound confidence - because he'd had Draco Malfoy on his knees, swallowing around his dick - that he'd use to charm a string of girls who'd be more than willing to fill in for Draco in all the next first times. This one, however, belonged exclusively to Draco, and Draco was going to make it unforgettable. He was going to make it so all those flimsy girls could slobber over Harry's cock and Harry would only think of him, on his knees, taking him to the root in the bathroom of the Three Broomsticks.
Draco turned to look at her. There was something in the way she was observing him that unsettled him. He looked away again. ‘I hardly think you should be chitchatting on the field.’
If he wanted to, though, Draco was sure he could have clung to the railing and gotten down the steps himself. Draco could, in theory, walk out on him. Because Draco wasn’t one to surrender his dignity easily, and now, crammed into that sorry little establishment balancing a drunk on his side, he was sure he looked ridiculous.
Pansy was already standing, a little smirk in her lips. By the pinch he got on his neck, Draco figured he was meant to follow her.
'Not discreet,' Harry scoffed. 'Only lucky enough that people thought you wanted to hit me instead of kiss me.'
There was a chorus of grumbles, and Sue was smug as everyone except for Fletchley - how dreadfully boring of him - drank.
Harry's laugh sounded on the edge of delirious. 'I'll compliment you when you- fuck, when you let me-' he trailed off to try and buck his hips up again with a frustrated huff. It was as good as words, in any sense.
Still, the true reality, where Harry was still smiling that disbelieving little smile of his, wasn’t that unpleasant.
Draco raised his eyebrows when Ron’s voice trailed off. ‘Since when?’ he prompted, but the other boy simply shook his head in some secretive amusement. Had he ever been in the Slytherin commons? Had Potter? ‘Are you alone out here?’
And he hadn’t sat next to them. Under the bleak daylight, inside Hogwarts’s walls, it didn’t work like that. Hungover,
, and Draco was sure he’d tease him for it - surely call him ‘mate’ again, or mention goddamn Finnigan, or some other casual imposition of friendship that’d bring Draco’s ego properly down -, but he said nothing of the sort. Instead, he asked, officially dispeling the gentle intimacy:
‘Because,’ Draco breathed, managed a shrug, forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. ‘You wanted them. And I wanted to make you smile.’
But he couldn't. He couldn't, because they didn't exactly work that way; because Draco couldn't talk to him without remembering how acutely inferior he was; because Potter was all perfection and smiles, and Draco was the ghost with the Dark Mark on his arm, spending cold dawns by the lake.
'I do sometimes,' he sucked a patch of skin below Harry's collar, 'when there's better things to do.'
She smirked, because she knew the effect that would have on him - that the idea that Potter had agreed to wait for him, even after parting ways inside the pub on such a cold note, would fucking
'Well, you ought to be more subtle, then,' Harry said, a teasing darkness in his eyes. 'The way you look at me - it's very obvious you want to fuck me.'
‘I can’t believe Hermione and Neville saw me drunk,’ he murmured, to try and dispel the tension. It worked - Harry laughed, resuming his idle tracing across Draco’s chest.
‘I guess we’ll never know,’ Draco shrugged. He didn’t think he would have, in all honesty. He’d always been so frightened before, so aware of Harry’s pedestal - not the one fame had imposed on him, but the one he’d
That had Harry raise a quizzical eyebrow. Draco, emboldened, took hold of his other wrist - and the Great Hall could be damned, the Great Hall could all
'Oh, fuck, Malfoy, fuck, please,' Harry was panting, trying to rock against Draco's body. His eyes were the most delicious type of desperate, red glitter framing blown black pupils that glistened with arousal, and it was the most bloody beautiful thing Draco had ever seen. His own erection was painful in his jeans, and he let their foreheads fall together, still teasing the tips of his fingers down the outline of Harry's length.
‘Well, so that I don’t leave you with any doubts,’ Draco murmured, pulling Harry a little closer into the curve of his side. ‘We’re dating. Exclusive dating. Boyfriends dating, though I hate the term. Which means two things: first, you’ll
Not like he’d say all of this. Even if he were sure Harry would want to hear it, he didn’t know if he
He could hear Ron’s disbelieving laugh in the back of his mind, but all his focus was on the little soft twitch of Harry’s lips. Ron turned to Harry,
They reached the cavernous door of the Hog’s Head at last, and the group entered in a cluster. It was the Weird Sisters that was playing now, lilting and hypnotic in the liquor-scented air. The pub was somewhat crowded, but the patrons were mostly leaning against the bar, or dancing at the back of the pub, under the spiderweb covered beams.
He was laughing - really laughing, and they were laughing with him, huddled in their little table, empty glasses forming a circle in its center. He was laughing with his friends in his world, and Draco did not belong there, could
Draco nodded. He wanted to laugh, something high and hysterical, something insane, because he knew it was: his sight still swayed from time to time, his head still pulsed, he was freezing in the thin shirt of his uniform, and he’d had the hardest time going up the Great Staircase without feeling nauseous. He couldn’t fly, he knew that - but he also knew Harry was feeling as poorly as he was. It was obvious in the way his head rested unstable on his neck, and his gaze flickered wildly from side to side, and his steps were slow and measured. He was faking it with smiles, but if anyone really looked, it was just under the surface. He’d hurt himself. He’d fall. If Draco played, if he was there, he could help.
Dizzy to the point of lunacy, really, because then they parted, and Draco had told Harry in explicit words with Alihotsy, he’d spoken of love by its name then, but now he was breathing out a word which felt incredibly more revealing:
his tie after a long day, to kiss him gentle and share his stress, his pain, his happiness. He deserved to let himself be loved.
Harry’s laugh sounded muffled against the mattress. When he lifted his head to look at Draco over his shoulder, his eyes were wild.
. The greatest. I did get you to notice me, didn’t I?’ Draco mused - and he’d said it lightly, were Harry to see it as a joke, but he didn’t. His smile faltered, then grew wider, then clashed against Draco’s own lips in a sudden kiss.
At last, and quite surprisingly, Harry broke into a small laugh. His voice, when he spoke, was hushed, like he didn’t want the drunken couple to hear.
Keeping his gaze on the short grass, Draco walked briskly to the stands. There stood the problem that there were people there, in the seats with him, indistinct faces he couldn’t bear to try and recognize, who could possibly be Harry’s friends, though Draco doubted any hungover soul would ever wake early to
?’ Pansy’s tone came close to horrified. Draco sighed, then stared out at Harry, whose eyes were alight with some mischievous, childlike enthusiasm as he fronted the group in a quick pace with Luna.
when he’d been so obvious. Of course he loved Harry - how had Hermione not seen it from the start, when he showed up at the antechamber with those bloody treacle tarts, or even before, when he’d nearly had a fit over the thought of Harry asking that girl Leanne out, or even years ago, since first year, when he followed Harry around like a kindergartener with a crush?
'Would you bloody come out. There's a line!' insisted the voice. Draco was opening his mouth to answer when Harry dropped to his knees, all fluid and pliant, right in front of Draco, and the breath was knocked out of him.
He sighed. The Gryffindors scored thirty points while he investigated a trembling of gold that had turned out to be the reflection off a loose nail from the stands. The disappointment settled low in his skull, heavy, pushing him down; he really was tired, and all the spins and turns had left him dizzy, and he might actually throw up. He might actually fall. And Harry, in turn, who was zigzagging through the air, slower now, revisiting places he’d been in before, staying away from the center, where the tornado of Chasers posed a serious threat, didn’t seem much better off. His movements were severely restricted now that one of his arms had been rendered useless. Draco was worried that it might be bleeding - it wasn’t like he’d notice through the vibrant red robes, and Harry would most likely let the arm rot off before seeing the nurse.
‘Fair enough,’ Draco smirked. He looked back at Luna and Pansy on the dancefloor. Luna was twirling under Pansy’s arm, platinum hair whipping the air, bright red lips split into an excited smile. Did Harry ever look that happy when he was with him? Did his own lips stretch so wide, like he could not control them, like his joy bypassed his mind so he couldn’t hope to hide it?
Harry's words, as well as the little smirk that came with them, pulled Draco away from his thoughts.
Draco shrugged. He remembered when he'd suggested it - the silence which had settled. No one had had the heart to change it, even as weeks went past. A safety hazard, an unbearably sentimental one, and still it remained.
‘Oy!’ Neville shouted. His voice was ill-suited for that type of thing; too soft to properly cut through the tension. ‘Ease off, mates. Where’s this coming from?’
to have heard, and he rode his climax out in frantic, hard thrusts before collapsing over Harry’s limp body.
‘What are we doing here?’ Draco whispered. He’d thought the haunted house would bring unpleasant memories.
‘I’m impressed,’ Draco said. He meant it - there was something horrifyingly fascinating about the little bloody fibers dangling from the ragged edges of her skin. She placed her head back atop her neck carefully, and the skin sutured seamlessly. ‘Granger. Hermione. I want to apologize.’
He worked Harry up to a frenzied state, feeling him tighten and tense against him, trying so hard to restrain himself from thrusting into Draco's mouth. Fucking
Harry just shimmied away from the tight space between Draco’s body and the edge of the desk, dragging him by the arm towards his own.
‘Because it’d be a shame for us to get this far only for you to see me cry. We’d have to break it all off, then.’
'You love him, but you don't want to fuck him?' Pansy looked pointedly at him, then gestured for him to hand over the glass, 'For a past Death Eater, darling, you're a wretched liar.'
Ron smiled in pure relief, then promptly dragged himself back to a corner, laying his head over his arms on one of the desks. He stayed like that for the rest of the class.
. It was just fucking selfish to go out into the field, really. Harry was a selfish fucking person, and Draco was tired, hungover and cold, and he’d gone there to focus on the
‘You can’t make decisions for him because you think you know best. Specially when your decisions end like
Draco snapped his hips flush with Harry’s arse again. There’d be marks on Harry’s hips, five pretty dots on each. Draco hoped he’d be able to see them in the morning.
changed, then what’s to stop you from pestering him again? What’s to make me believe you’re not still that bloody bully that hurts the people he likes?’
He was smirking, the bastard, shivering a little as he stared expectantly at him, and Draco could only find it in him to think that one of his friends truly ought to have forced him to bring something warmer - that it was like everyone other than him thought the Boy Who Lived was some kind of higher entity, unbothered by menial needs. Like they didn't see the red in his cheeks when it was cold out, like they didn't know he
'Well,' Draco leered. He was very desperately trying to will away his arousal, 'I did give the Saviour of the Wizardry World the best blowjob of his life.'
There was a rearranging of room as they slid through the leathers, shoving each other with wild elbows and complaining half-heartedly. Draco took a seat at the newly formed space at the corner of the couch. His left side was entirely pressed to Ron’s. He was awfully uncomfortable, and Potter
And that question, which was pitched so innocently and yet, through the dark twinkle in Harry’s gaze, that felt so
'I didn't expect the loo to be so nice,' he commented. It made Draco a little dizzy, the way he was still speaking so normally, like he and Draco regularly engaged in idle chat. It made him dizzy, and it also made him utterly, completely speechless.
'Whatever works,' Draco hummed, and then he was pressing a kiss to Harry's arsecheek, a quick thing that somehow became lost in suction and teeth, and Harry's answering moan made his cock throb. When he let up, the skin had bloomed a dark red, a bruise Harry wouldn't even be able to see, only feel. For the sake of symmetry - for the joy of
He stumbled out the common room and into the dungeons. He’d find Harry - how difficult could it be? There were always Gryffindors pestering the halls, he’d simply ask one of them. It was worth the humiliation of letting them see him grey-skinned and floundering with uncoordinated feet. Yes, fuck them. Let them see him hungover, have a laugh, then tell him where the hell his Harry was.
He put on a condom - those were in a very flashy bowl at the back of the infirmary, a bowl enchanted by Madam Pomfrey never to go empty - and slicked himself up. One hand settled at Harry’s hip, he guided the flushed tip of his cock to Harry’s rim. He was leaking as well, twitching eagerly in his own hand, and it was quite worrisome to think of Harry’s tightness now, for he didn’t really know how long he could
He looked at the lake once more, and Draco’s gaze followed. The snow still twirled lazily in the air, covering the fields in pristine white. Soon it would all begin to melt into the dew of spring.
‘Spring?’ Harry looked back at him with a frown. Draco had the most ridiculous, childish urge to kiss his scrunched nose. ‘Why is everyone being so bloody cryptical?’
Instinctively, he would have answered Harry; if he thought about it objectively, he would have gone with Hermione. But he didn’t want to mention her, didn’t want to be reminded of their conversation, so he just shrugged.
Neville laughed, a tired, gravelly sound. While the teams on the field finished their warm ups, the four of them settled into a silence that wasn't too uncomfortable, their shared hangovers binding them in quiet solidarity. Draco, of course, ought to feel the most inadequate - the others huffed murmured jokes between them, small casual remarks, half asleep in the cold morning air. Draco might have joined in, but
‘Well, it’s true, isn’t it? If you did love him you wouldn’t give a shit about your moral code. You’d want him alive, and that would be that.’
‘You’ll warm up to them, mate,’ Ron assured, then gestured vaguely at the ceiling, ‘Once you get drunk enough to forget the bloody awful lighting.’
-’ Draco stuttered, bucking mindlessly against Harry, who took it in stride, moving with him and humming even lower from his throat, a needy sound that reverberated through the whole of Draco’s length. It was those vibrations that tipped him over: he spilled down Harry’s throat, twitching against hot muscle, a hand on the back of Harry’s head to keep him in place. Harry’s gaze was unfocused, his grip weak on Draco’s hips, his breaths ragged through his nose. Spit and come bubbled down his bottom lip, glistening in his chin and forming a steadily dripping stream by the time Draco’s orgasm subsided.
‘Harry! Harry,’ she called. ‘Here, could you hold my handbag, please? It keeps sliding off,’ she drew an apologetic smile, a little thing too thrilled to be properly humble, handed Harry the small bag and skittered off back to the mess of ghosts with a spring in her step, a rustling of red to the rhythm of the music.
For a long time, Draco repeated this thoughtline to himself, leaning against the sticky door and willing his pulse to slow and his breaths to steady. The lanky Hufflepuff gave one unimpressive groan, then left with a loud snapping of the door shut; the guy in the other stall gathered himself and left as well. Some stumbling pair barricaded itself in the stall adjacent to his and made out against the wall dividing their stalls, which was particularly awkward and only gave Draco the sort of ideas he was most trying to ignore at that moment. The people around him changed, footsteps coming by ever so often, the sound of a faucet running or a stall door opening and closing, the beats of the music outside muffled and entrancing. He was calmer, after a while, and the plan he’d been reciting in a patient, if somewhat desperate monologue was finally starting to sound appealing, and he finally left the stall. He had to find the man who’d checked him at the door and retrieve his coat before he could leave and put that dreaded night past him.
Draco flittered a quick look around. Everyone was still enthralled in the dancing. From past years’ experience, that wouldn’t change for quite some time. Carefully, he opened Luna’s bag and unearthed the little golden stick, popping the lid off to roll the smooth red bar up. He eyed Harry with a challenging eyebrow raised.
‘Just do it here, mate,’ Alicia suggested, though her lips were twisted into a smirk. Finnigan stared down at the striped green wall beside him with an appraising frown.
He ought to have punched him back when he’d had the chance, when the pain had irradiated through his skull and translated so simply into fury. It wasn’t like anyone would have noticed: they could have had an entire fight and the drunken crowd of Kettle Bottom wouldn’t have lifted their eyes from their glasses.
He suspected the moment might mean more to him than Harry, even though it would be Harry’s first time. Harry moaned regardless, eyelids fluttering like he could envision even a fraction of Draco’s fantasy.
They dissolved into laughter again. Draco stared absently at the restless way Harry's fingers thrummed over Ron's shoulder. He wondered if they'd slept at all. If they ever slept, or if they just ran along the castle, hyped on coffee and alcohol and Honeydukes candy, doing all the childish things they hadn't had the chance to do before the end of the war.
‘I wanted a shot,’ Harry said, all fake innocence, the type that doesn’t even try to be believable, that drips teasingly from a sweet smile. He looked like an angel like that, mischief in his eyes, the fiery sheen over them, dishevelled black hair like cinders on his head. Draco hoped he’d die with that picture in his mind.
And he’d said it to tease, the twat, all lighthearted and wicked, like he genuinely didn’t know what those words would do, like he didn’t know Draco would melt at that. But Draco’s breath caught, so dreadfully obvious, so impossibly delirious, because Harry remembered - not just a drunken musing, nor a passing joke, not an idea regretted and discarded. It had lingered in his mind, maybe not a serious suggestion, nothing of the sort, but surely as something. A notion to be explored or teased or asked about - regardless, not to be forgotten. And wasn’t that so entirely hopeful? So ridiculously pink and sweet, conjuring all sorts of domestic dreams in Draco’s head? Wasn’t that perfect?’
Hermione froze. Draco, who before would have kept walking, grateful to be alone once more, turned to regard her now. The anger that had been growing inside him was finally loose, and he wanted to see the hurt on her face.
- he found that fateful little nub, sensitive and barely sticking out, and rubbed over it. Harry's entire body seemed to go into shock.
'Oh, sod off,' Harry groaned, all the anger undercut by a breathless laugh. He did twist Draco's hair in his fingers as revenge. Draco, to match, bit Harry's neck again, right next to the bruise he'd been working on. 'If you insist on biting, could you do it somewhere discreet?' Harry said, starting on the top button of his shirt to try and expose more skin.
. That Harry had stepped down willingly was one thing, but for him to have reached up… no, he figured he’d have died of frustration first.
‘See, was it so hard to guess?’ Finnigan taunted. The shots were poured. They handed some knuts to the bartender; someone to Draco’s right shoved him, and Draco was flattened against Finnigan’s side. He’d never been as close to the boy before - this boy with sticky arms and a loose tongue, dragging Harry to the dance floor, calling him ‘doll’ with that unashamed twinkle in his eye.
it was something else. The thought of Harry being ashamed of him clenched tightly inside of Draco, but he didn’t exactly resent him for it, nor did he plan to throw it in his face. Besides, some little note of insecurity in Harry’s eye, begrudged and soft and so needing to be swayed, made bitterness impossible.
He pushed onto his feet unsteadily, grabbing his coat with an almost hesitant touch. Truly, he had no idea how Harry had bounced back so readily after drinking those shots.
‘Alright,’ Alicia slapped her hands on the table, drawing everyone’s attention, ‘Never have I ever, you all know the rules. Malfoy, you know it, right?’
so he could watch them come together - and then again and again, a careful rhythm which Harry seemed to take in stride. Seemed to
- Malfoy,' Harry gasped, hips straining against Draco's unforgiving hip, 'Don't you- don't you fucking dare stop again.'
Harry shivered when Draco sucked more harshly at his earlobe, then pressed hands into his chest, trying to push him further into the bathroom.
It was more than enough motivation: Draco swatted Harry’s hand away and replaced it with his own, jerking Harry tight and fast, rising from him a ragged sound. Harry, in turn, started stroking Draco in tandem, catching his lips for another laughing kiss.
Loved him, and it was even more painful, even worse to bear, because now he'd seen how it would be to be his friend, to lend him his coat, to talk to him and drink with him and do him silly favours to make him smile.
It was incredibly infuriating, kissing Harry with a split lip. It brought to it an inherent sense of violence that clashed with the gentle moonbeams - it hurt independently of how he moved, pulsed whenever he tried to deepen it, threatened to reopen with each brush of skin. Draco did his best, in any sense. The pain, as petty and high-pitched as it was, didn’t drown the surge of joy at kissing Harry; that emotion controlled him, as did the instinctive wish to meet the rhythm Harry was setting up, all growing urgency and sure softness and thrilling
‘Tutoring from the best in Potions, huh?’ Harry hummed, irresistibly close, that teasing smirk in his lips - lips still slick with stray droplets of spit and come, still raw red and swollen, so bloody beautiful Draco could feel heat pool at his stomach again.
Draco laughed, though it died out bitter in his tongue. Someone pushed him roughly to the side in an attempt to get closer to the bar, and Draco pressed against Pansy as he spoke:
'You truly are daft, aren't you, Draco?' she laughed, sitting across from him at lunch, 'Truly, completely daft.'
He set his jaw. Let it be known, once and for all, so she’d never doubt him again, how devoted he was.
‘I was rude. And though I’m aware you might not find that unsurprising coming from me, I still regret it.'
silence before he was running out the dim corner and sliding into the narrow corridor to their right, disappearing into the men’s loo.
Draco let himself breathe out fully for the first time since Finnigan had shown up. His erection had now completely deflated. He was tired, and frustrated, and bitter with irrational jealousy, and really wishing Finnigan had agreed when Harry had asked him to give him a minute alone, because then, maybe, if Draco let himself hope, Harry would have snuck some sort of goodbye kiss before he’d left.
Oof, alright, I apologize for the brief angst with the argument between Ron and Draco, but I wanted Draco's past to be fully addressed so we could all get closure.
'I bloody well deserve them,' Draco huffed; decadently, he pressed another kiss to Harry's skin. He wondered if Harry could feel them, if he minded, if he
, like it didn’t bother him, even though all the memories of how awful he’d been were now spinning in a whirlwind inside his skull, fueled by Ron’s words, and digging a hole of guilt inside him.
For one tortuous moment, Harry taunted him with silence, eyes twinkling mischievously while he sipped his tea. He very properly set his mug down, entwined his fingers on the table, shrugged with a softer smile.
‘Perhaps you should go back to hating me, then,’ Draco sniped back, and it didn’t even feel like he was trying to hurt Harry - he was hurting
The tower was also never truly silent: there was the incessant ticking of hidden clocks - inexistent clocks, perhaps, but there nonetheless; the whispers of the wind as it whizzed through the cracks and eroded the old, porous blocks of stone. A little soundtrack composed of nothings which played a slow rhythm in the back of Draco's mind as he settled down under the window's archway, intent on studying some advanced formulas for the manipulation of potion scents. It quickly proved fruitless, however, even in the melancholic calm the space evoked; each phrase and diagram served only as a reminder of that day at the start of the year where Potter had sauntered past him, the
He shrugged off his coat and rolled up the sleeves of his charcoal shirt. In each forearm, writhing and coiling languorously around the pale skin, was a snake, magicked in black lines, two bifurcated tongues hissing over the blue veins on his wrists. After days of obsessing over it, it had been the best he could do, refusing to be as flamboyant as he’d heard many people were - some jokesters, he’d been told, charmed their hairs the colours of their Houses - but also dreading being labelled by Potter as unimaginative.
‘Oh, bloody hell,’ Draco groaned, dropping his head so their foreheads clashed together with a slight sting. ‘Are your friends always
He managed to catch up to Harry again. He aimed for casual, even though he could still remember Harry’s glare under the Hufflepuff tower, and the weight of the conversation they were having before the Bludger had hit him.
‘It is. They'll learn,' Harry hummed. His voice, gentle and amused, really did make it feel like it was true.
Draco found himself with nothing to say; he followed, compliant, all the way to the train station and further, to the snowy village.
‘In any case, I doubt you’d want to know about every time we shag,’ Draco mused, making Harry laugh against his side. He wasn’t actually against it, as a matter of fact: as long as every lewd description made it very clear that Draco couldn’t be taken out of the picture, that Harry, quivering and moaning, only happened because of
Draco hummed his agreement and then, emboldened, flicked his tongue into the hole, lips sucking at the rim. It was hot, insanely so, and the thought of how it would feel around his cock had him moaning into it. Harry's entire body shivered at the vibrations. Draco explored further, deeper, his tongue plunging inside repeatedly, getting Harry accustomed to it. It ought to feel strange, having a tongue be the first thing breaching his arsehole - wet, short and warm, twitching muscle licking into him. A finger would feel much different, a cock even more. Would Harry not like it? But he seemed to like it now, slowly rocking into it, his breath heavy and intoxicating,. He was
‘She didn’t say,’ and he didn’t even try to be convincing, simply leaned back against the chair and ignored Harry’s skeptical frown.
impression that she remembered their exchange - until the sun had begun to set, the school had gone calm and deserted, and Draco had just retired to the common room.
‘Of course you have,’ Draco sighed. Really, he should never have presumed he’d be introducing Harry to something new. ‘You and your friends have wormed yourselves into every bloody crevice in this school.’
Draco turned away from the stairs, which he’d been watching with a frown, to properly take in Pansy. She’d curled her hair, which was unusual; curled it in small, tight locks, which was even stranger.

'You're free to start complimenting me at any time, you know,' he mused, his breath warm on Harry's skin. His nipple now looked as swollen and desperate as the other one. Still, Draco licked over it, just for the pleasure of seeing it glisten with spit.
‘I never said she wasn’t,’ Draco retorted. ‘Why are you even going, Pike? I’d think this was a date between those two.’
before -, and there was a bubbling of panic and fear just an inch from the surface, and he couldn’t bear Harry’s expression as his eyes widened in surprise, so he broke the spell at last, stepped back towards the door and gestured vaguely at the vials with his gaze stubborn on the floor.
'Malfoy,' he said, and he seemed pained to hear his own voice. Draco lifted his eyes from his brew. 'Listen, mate, Harry didn't tell us why you ran off, but, hum, we just wanted to say… all of us, but no one else could get out of bed… thanks, is what I mean. Thanks. Aye?'
Draco nodded. He could understand that: it was painful, really, caring for Harry. Constant, overwhelming, with so little return.
Harry stood at the top of the stairs. He was fit in a black suit, white shirt pressed and immaculate, collar straight, jacket sleeves snug around his arms, tie tightly knotted at the base of his neck. Formal, as Draco had asked - and he’d done it perfectly, he
He glanced at the cardboard box that rested expectantly on his lap. He’d been half-heartedly trying to wish it away since he’d gotten it at Hogsmeade - it had a way, somehow, of seeming incredibly less poetic when Pansy wasn’t there.
stayed - dancing and drinking in Hogsmeade? They ought to have had a merry night without him. Honestly, it was just indecent that they could drink so much, that they could drink that vile
them. Because Potter deserved to wear someone else’s jacket when he was cold, and to have someone fuss over his diet, to carry shit for him when he was tired, to do up his tie because the twat could
‘Don’t you dare say that, Malfoy,’ her eyes flashed dangerously. He’d seen them like that once before - in third year, a millisecond before her fist had battered in his cheekbone.
He couldn't even pretend - just for a moment, just like Pansy had. How hard would it have been? Then, Granger would have reported it to Potter - Longbottom, the nervous soul, would have nodded so promptly his neck would hurt - and Harry would know Draco could be pleasant. Maybe he would have invited him over. Among that nauseating group of kindness Draco and Pansy would have sat, and Draco would have played nice all night and hoped to Merlin Potter was looking.
But it wasn’t to be talked about. It was love in its essence, it was felt by both, it was meant to be left unsaid.
Harry was slow to come down, shaking and panting and wobbling a bit unsteady on his feet. Draco, feeling dizzy himself, though for an entirely different reason, kept him supported by his hips, and busied himself taking long, deep intakes of breath. With spit slick lips, tasting deliciously salted from Harry's come, he pressed a myriad of hazy kisses on Harry's quivering thighs. He knew he was being unbearably sentimental, but he had just made Harry come, after all, so he hardly thought Harry would have the heart to tell him to stop.
But her anger didn’t mean Draco was wrong - because Hermione was trying to lecture him about love like he was some inconvenient beginner, but he wasn’t; he’d loved faithfully and devotedly for over seven years, and he knew what he was talking about.
‘He’s-’ Dean glanced back at the crowd. ‘We think he broke his arm. We’ll get him to the nurse. It’s fine, we- we had to wrap up the game before Potions anyway.’
Pansy and he were pressed up against the bar, watching the crimson tinged liquid being poured into the glasses. A group of Hufflepuffs - Hufflepuffs, for fuck's sake - were crowding a little table, perilously balanced on stools as they simultaneously downed their drinks; Blodwyn Bludd rumbled in his baritone, a girl was tripping down the narrow stairwell, fifteen bodies in five square meters - and all was dark, shadowed, and Draco felt, as the vampire's slurred words filled his senses and he and Pansy did their shots in quick succession, like he was drinking blood, red and hot down his throat, weighing him down toward the dusty floor.
Harry took the umbrella, spun the handle in his palm, then smiled that crooked, mischievous smile of his. ‘Thanks, Malfoy. Oh, I forgot - the party, if you go - it’s a House party. You have to bring something to show what House you’re in. Not your tie or something, though, that’s no fun.’
The game went on. Draco had been right: it was entertaining, when it had alcohol. Besides, it was surprisingly informative. Everyone except for Fletchley had stolen something from Hogwarts - even Luna, who, as it turned out, swiped ingredients from the kitchens for her own concoctions; every guy in the group, except for Harry and he, had had a sexual fantasy about one of the professors; no girl in the group had
He gingerly took Harry's cock out. It glistened red and swollen between his fingers, twitching a little. Harry did a broken little noise, nails ruthless on the back of Draco's neck. Not that Draco minded - rather, he hoped that, if he twisted enough in front of a mirror the next day, he'd be able to see the imprints.
Alright, that's it done, standby for the next chapter, in which Draco's going to party at Hogsmeade. Or, you know, party as much as Draco Malfoy can. He really does try.
'Nor are you one to leave without saying goodbye,' Blaise drawled, his eyes settling on Harry. 'Not until you came along, at least. That colour really does suit you.'
‘Obviously with him,’ Pansy rolled her eyes. ‘Otherwise you wouldn’t be looking so pleased. Did you fuck him?’
Harry was still glaring, and Draco dropped his gaze to find his own shirt. He didn’t want Harry angry, didn’t want to dispel the brief sweetness between them so completely. Perhaps he shouldn’t have said anything - but it was so easy to forget loyalties when Harry was near, when he was overrun with the instinct to help
At that, Draco froze. Muscles rigid, and it had to be quite noticeable, for Harry’s side was pressed against his. Blaise’s jaw set almost imperceptibly, a little quirk Draco had memorized after years of knowing him, that subtle, rare thing that meant he knew he’d committed some mistake. And Draco daredn’t look at Harry, and he was opening his mouth to let out some sorry, useless quip to change the subject - to bury the word ‘love’ with some, any, whatever words he could think of, when he was saved by another voice, loud and wavering, spoken right between his ear and Harry’s.
He walked up to him, suppressing his own smile. The air there had the lightly fizzy scent of sherbet lemons.
‘Where else would I get it from?’ Pansy cocked an eyebrow. She looked expectant, like something of interest might actually spill from Draco’s lips, and Draco knew he’d disappoint her. There was little on his mind besides Harry, such was the curse of love, and his words could reflect nothing else.
stupid, isn't it?' Seamus mused, though he seemed curious, not worried, as he sipped on his beer. 'What if we get caught?'
‘Perhaps you should allow them to love you back,’ Draco said, because, yes, Potter did everything for his friends, and Potter’s friends would surely do anything for him, but he didn’t
‘What the bloody hell happened to you?’ Pike asked once he’d finally found the table, taking in his bloodied face.
And he felt so small saying it, so pathetic, like that absent fact, one he'd gathered from the nights he'd spent spying on Potter, presented any hope in his favour.
Draco’s shoulders tensed. He didn’t want Harry guarded; didn’t want to echo his past self, all jokes bereft of warmth, jabbing in the childish compulsion to get Harry to
They huddled at the bar and ordered a butterbeer to share, leaning against the dark wooden frame as they watched the group catch up with Hagrid. It was one of those moments where Draco didn't belong - one of those photographs that could never include him, could never hope to remember him in the future.
For about an hour, the group carried on in conversation. They curled in their seats, bunched their robes together as makeshift blankets and settled amid a dim, buzzed aura, lulled by the sounds of the wind on the old wooden boards. Hermione and the Weasleys were deep into some debate about old Quidditch regulations which Draco daredn’t interfere with, while Harry and Neville were still inaccessible in their little private exchange, attached by the hips on the large table. Draco hadn’t known they were so close. Regardless, he tried not to dwell on it, focusing instead on ingratiating himself into the conversation between Luna and Justin. They were talking about the colour lavender, quite ardently in fact - they had opposing thoughts. Draco nodded along and forewent keeping the frosty beer bottle against his bruised skin in favour of drinking it. It didn’t help much in finding the argument more interesting, but it did make him forget how cold the floor was.
His hand was halfway to his zipper even before Harry had finished his sentence. It stilled there, however. Stilled, for there was something animalistic in his mind, and he didn’t want it. Stilled on account of some lingering softness that fortunately remembered: this would be Harry’s first time. Harry’s first time, which was always frightening and awkward, and which he was entrusting so casually to Draco. Confident that it’d go alright. That it’d feel nice. And it wasn’t a promise, but Draco would never break it nonetheless. He wanted Harry to enjoy himself - selfishly, he wanted him to enjoy himself more than he ever had, so perhaps he’d link the feeling to Draco. So he withdrew his hand and pressed it rather on Harry’s chest, coaxing him lower again, so he was back on his elbows with a little curious frown, and hoped the added distance would be enough to clear his head a little bit.
They braced the cold. Grinded teeth. Harry laboured through his sixth tart while Draco watched the peaceful grey lake.
‘I swear, Pansy, if you’re planning on dragging me to the infirmary…’ he gritted through clenched teeth, pointedly looking away from Longbottom and Finnigan, whose expressions were quite hostile as they followed him out the classroom with their still tired, still bloodshot gaze. Just the notion of seeing Harry’s fierce, restless spirit confined to the minimalistic antiseptic white of that place filled him with rage; and the thought of seeing the damage he’d caused, of then asking for forgiveness, the likely possibility that Harry would
‘D’you not, really?’ Harry asked. His voice was hushed; something in it, a certain rawness, finally persuaded Draco to face him. Harry was already looking at him, his skin an eerie pale from the moonlight.
'Yes. In that flat in London,' he echoed, and hoped to all heavens that his tone had sounded less serious than he felt.
‘Finally, mate, we thought you two had run off. D’you want a drink? It’s the american stuff you like.’
Draco’s smile, which had been growing during his exchange with Luna, fell at once. Hermione had told him, then. Not entirely unexpected.
‘Oh, yeah? Nice and private, Potter?’ he drawled, punctuating the words with a teasing bite at Harry’s lip.
Draco kissed him, long and firm with the hint of despair that lingered from the memory of that Quidditch game, the picture of Harry small and bruised in that infirmary bed. Tangled fingers into the hair at the base of his neck - cold, of course, and Draco was definitely going to get him some warmer clothes; gripped him tightly there and angled his head to properly deepen the kiss. Harry made a low sound, leaned closer for a moment, digging nails into Draco’s thighs with the sweetest sting, then forced himself away, his eyes shining lustful and surprised.
He grazed his lips against Harry's hole - just a little, testing the pink skin, too delirious himself to try anything more.
- Harry oblige; wanted, in turn, to learn what Harry liked when he took himself in hand at night, and what exactly he pictured, and if he’d jerked off to the memory of Draco blowing him; wanted to suck him off again, have him do the same; wanted to hear him moan as he neared the edge and cry out his name when he came - not ‘Malfoy’ like last time but ‘Draco’, sweet and genuine and
‘Did he really? I’ll have to thank him for that,’ Harry mused, digging his chin into Draco’s chest to look up at him with a twinkle in his eye. ‘It was a very pleasant surprise.’
Draco hurried behind her, and they both squeezed between a flurry of people, elbows firmly pressed on the liquor-stained bartop. Pansy caught the busy bartender's attention with one dainty hand and a grateful smile, and soon the shots were poured toxic green with swirls of orange into their glasses. Draco had no idea what it was, but he daredn't speak and ask.
Harry saw right through it - which, admittedly, wasn’t too difficult, since Draco had drunk too much for subtleties - and he pointedly ignored him, looking at Ron instead.
He wouldn't think of Potter. He wouldn't go to Hogsmeade. Draco belonged faded and modest in the background, a slab of stone that composed the landscape.
ready, you’re the one who pulled me off,’ Harry huffed, all stubborn confidence. It made Draco smile.
‘Oh, you’re hilarious,’ Draco’s tone was dry, but he couldn’t suppress a chuckle. ‘Potter, will you do me a favour?’
Harry's cheeks went a little pink, his eyes a little dark, and he huffed a laugh. 'As I said, not romantic,' he looked back at Tracey with a crooked smile. 'I suppose it is our first date.'
‘I hated you, and look how well that turned out,’ Draco mused, swiping a soothing thumb over his knuckles.
'Draco, fuck,' Harry groaned, licking the seam of his lips. He moved his thigh, the little tease, so it brushed Draco's dick. Draco ground down once, the friction through their clothes fueling his growing erection, and muffled a rough sound against Harry's cheek.
And the amount of people who drank was much less than he expected. He himself drank, Sue and Alicia did too, as did Ron and Hermione; Finnigan as well, unsurprisingly, and, after a stunted pause, Ginny, almost as quick as lightning. And Draco, because Ginny would always be to him, no matter how heroic she proved, the little girl who’d snatched Potter first, immediately turned, when he saw her drink, to stare at Harry. But Ginny had drunk, and Harry’s glass was stubbornly on the table, and his glittery eyes on his lap, and he wasn’t
Still, he didn’t have to be obvious to it. No good things would come of Harry knowing just how persuasive his pretty green eyes were.
'Did you see the commons, then?' Harry asked, guiding the bottle, still in Ron's hand, to his own lips, 'Have they changed much?'
Harry looked at him quizzically. Draco, though he was doing a little run to try and catch up with him, feet loud as he crossed the puddle on the floor, tried to look somewhat composed.
‘Shots don’t make you laugh ‘til you faint,’ Draco huffed. Regardless, when Harry offered him a spoon he took it promptly, scooping up some of the nasty brew.
special, the type of memory one cherishes forever, and Draco couldn’t wait any longer. It wouldn’t hurt, he told himself. It wouldn’t hurt, he wouldn’t let it, because he loved Harry, because he was going to make him feel the best he ever fucking had.
'Hey,' Potter said instead, standing halfway between Draco and the pub's door, his hands shoved into the pockets of his flimsy fucking jacket.
Draco’s smile was rueful - because no matter how clear Draco made it, how painfully obvious he was, how bloody openly in love he was, Harry would never see, and Draco would never have the courage to say it, and the torture would never end.
Harry sighed, stepping a bit closer, so he was between Draco and Hermione and Neville, who were staring strangely. His hand pressed soothingly at Draco’s upper back.
Harry, which Draco couldn’t even hate him for, because Harry was frustratingly attractive and a brilliant Quidditch player and a better person and the only bloody human whose silences were
It still hurt, however. Especially now. Everyone else glowed with optimism for their new lives after the war. It was contagious, and Draco found himself unwittingly hoping for change in a fact that had been set in stone years ago: Potter didn't want anything to do with him, and never would.
And he was coming, hard and with flashes of white, leaning over Harry in erratic movements, hips trembling and fingers punishing on his black hair. Harry gagged a little, an ill-contained cough as his throat worked around Draco's cock, milking him dry.
‘We love each other,’ he repeated, lips twitching into a smirk like it was a joke between them. ‘Get me some treacle tarts, would you? I want to go walk in the snow.’
Draco was overwhelmed with the urge to follow them. He felt like a child - why shouldn’t he, when they were playing a game, and Harry had broken the rules? Did it mean he had that particular kink? No? A worse one, or one even more common? When he’d been with Ginny, what had he thought of them doing? What did he like? What brought him to the edge?
It took an hour. Draco dutifully focused on his own brew; though he dallied, he still left ten minutes early. Harry had looked at him when he headed out - didn’t smile, barely lingered past a nanosecond, but it’d been there nonetheless. His potion simmered over low heat, the right shade of pink. Closing the door behind him, Draco allowed himself to smile.
‘Bloody hell, Neville,’ Ron’s tone was a mix of impressed and mortified. Seamus and Dean looked at each other, dissolved into a fit of laughter and drank. Hermione, Sue and Draco - who was trying to suppress that very awkward time in the dorms with Blaise, for the sorry sake of experimentation and forgetting a certain bespectacled twat - also took a valiant gulp of their firewhiskey.
There was a slight rumbling to their left - a strange thing without preamble, enough to break the moment, to make them turn and see, through the translucent dance pairs that were already swaying together, the ghost orchestra set up a little way off, purring with the low notes of two ethereal cellos. A violin shrieked, a bone white piano began to play, and suddenly the music began loud and fluid in an eerie symphony. The ghosts danced with practised ease, impossibly light on their incorporeal feet; Pansy and Luna swept by them in a rustling of fabric; Draco led a hand to Harry’s hip by instinct, saw flashes of Harry’s hand around
'Yes, but they do look fantastic,' Pansy hummed non-commitaly, 'Now hurry, Draco. It's  dreadfully boring to wait for you.'
After a while, however, it itched, Potter’s presence so close. Itched like it had always itched, ever since he’d met him: he’d solved it with aggression, before, with sharp words and cold eyes, because the only way to have Harry close to him without being too telling had been to shove him against a wall. The habit crept up on him, now, the compulsion to have Potter’s attention all to himself at least for a
years; excruciating in this kindness Draco could never give back. Agonizing, harrowing, heartbreaking.
‘Good,’ Harry nodded, ‘Now, if you hadn’t decided to be a complete prat and you’d let Hermione speak, you’d have known she wanted to invite you to a party this Friday, at the Three Broomsticks.’
He’d finally managed to put such thoughts away and concentrate on transplanting his infant Bouncing Bulb into a fresh pot when Ron walked up to him.
‘You could say that,’ Draco nodded, looking idly around the room. ‘Your friends all fancy each other, you know?’
‘So, are you going to apologize or not?’ Hermione asked, one expectant eyebrow raised. Next to them, on the other side of the bar, the bartender filled their glasses.
Harry gave him a sly smile, and they headed towards the exit. They didn't get very far - Blaise, the inconvenient pest he was, quickly intercepted them.
He left with a twirl of his wet robes, umbrella unfolding over his head. As Draco watched him go further and further into the rain, he seemed to blur in the softest watercolours, until he was nothing but a blot of grey and black.
'Come on, I want to,' Harry rasped out, already reaching for Draco's clothes. 'Been wanting to all night.'
‘What on earth is this?’ he managed to ask, though his voice was rough, scratching painfully at the back of his throat.
‘Don’t be daft,’ Pansy drawled, tugging him through the halls. ‘We’re not going to the infirmary. At least not yet. We’re going to Hogsmeade.’
around his eyes, red, yellow, orange, golden - thick on his eyelids, quirking towards his temples, Phoenix wings like fire on his pale skin, neon bright and hypnotizing and
