He is dead, Draco thought, willing it to be otherwise, willing the whole world to bend and make his desire reality. Who am I now is who he called me into being; he brought me to life though he may despise us both for what I become. He will always be a hero but when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of who he really was, who we both were, will speedily vanish.
"I what, Potter?" Malfoy asked when Harry couldn't quite finish his sentence. His tone had turned silky, his demeanour more confident and Harry had a bare split-second of warning before Malfoy was smashing his mouth onto Harry's.
"I have no doubt," Zabini said, still looking at Harry. "Do join us this evening, Mr Potter, it will make it quite the party."
Draco looked at him over his shoulder. “If your father kept telling you how much you disappointed him, would you not do everything you could to rectify it?”
Harry flashed him a rueful look even as Edmund Burke, another one of the pureblood supremists got to his feet. “This bill will be crucial to ensuring that we wizards are able to rediscover a number of artefacts misplaced over the protracted period of the witch trials. It has now been long enough since Muggle brutality necessitated the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy for us to claim reparations for the lost estates, for one, and to seek specific items known to have been lost.”
"I do," Draco said. "I know you will feel strangely about it. But Potter, I feel my skin will flay itself from my flesh and I know but one way to solve it."
The measurements and bank visit had taken until three. That only left Draco 2 hours to do something about Terry Boot and get to the Auror office.
"I cannot live without you," Draco told the body on the slab as he poured more of the elixir down its throat. The Elixir of Life would have kept them alive forever but it wasn't enough yet, because the body, this assembled body had never really been alive. The Hallows weren't enough because the Resurrection Stone brought him forth but couldn't bind him to the body. Voldemort's ritual it would have to be.
Harry swallowed hard. “If he says things like this to the wrong people – the right people… Draco, what we do is still illegal.”
It also meant that the trial was likely to be arranged quickly, to avoid having to draw out this unusual arrangement. “So you shouldn’t have to be here too long.”
"Lord Malfoy has done much to try and discredit my father," Ginny said, frowning. This was news to Harry – he knew that Arthur had faced some opposition at the Ministry but he had not known until this moment that Lord Malfoy was behind it.
Draco reared up at once to bite at the lips; there was a soft click in Harry's new throat as he gasped, the same reaction Draco had always been able to elicit. Desire flooded Draco and he reached to touch all of Harry's new flesh, colder than he remembered but pliant all the same. He had to screw up his eyes against the urge to cry, overwhelmed with the joy and the ecstasy replacing the loss and the silence.
Sirius patted his hand. “You will see, Harry. The Malfoys will always have their supporters but as long as you are respected as a hero, Lucius can do nothing more than spread rumours which your allies will dismiss as spite.”
At ten minutes past the hour, Harry checked his appearance in the looking glass above the fireplace. He had tried to straighten his hair as much as possible, present himself neatly. For the first time in his life he wished he was more handsome.
It took a while, several fingers and a great deal of oil before Harry was relaxed enough to allow Draco to slip inside him. When at last Harry was open enough, Draco rolled on top of him, pressing their faces together, kissing him as he pressed inside. Harry hissed at the pressure and the sting of it. He wriggled, uncomfortable, but never asked Draco to stop. This was the closest he had ever felt to another person – completely different to any other experience of his life. The pain and pleasure bound together and Harry moaned even as Draco bottomed out and gave an animalistic cry of his own.
Harry looked at the boys and looked back at Malfoy. His stomach lurched. "You brought me to a bawd-house? You brought me to invert whores?" He had
Harry didn't want that, didn't want that at all. "Would one be enough," said Harry, bracing himself, "if it were mine?"
Sirius nodded. "Well, I shall have to attend of course – and it would be terribly poor if I were not to bring any guests after having Mrs Bones extend the invitation."
“Always so plebeian, Potter,” Draco teased. Somehow Harry knew that it was intended this time to soothe him, and to some extent it worked.
"It's a great profession," Harry said, his mind focused entirely on something else. "I meant to ask, did you not have a chance to respond to my letter?"
Harry sighed. "Sirius, you know that is not it. And you are welcome to visit us at any time. I will be glad to return to normalcy, that is all. I have always favoured the quiet life as you know." So many half-truths; Harry wondered how many of them Sirius could see through. "Let us speak with Ginny to arrange a date and a time for the ball, and then we will depart."
"It was a long time ago," Harry said, trying to encourage Draco to leave the past behind. "I do not ignore you now, do I?"
"I am," Harry said. "I am sorry to impose, I should have sent an owl at the very least but I'm afraid my thoughts were somewhat in disarray. Can we talk?"
“Run away?” Harry blinked his disbelief. It was as incredible to him now as it had been when Draco suggested it. “I am an Englishman! I fought to prevent this country falling into darkness and you would have me, what? Leave the Wizengamot to Lucius and the others who will put us back a hundred years? I have a duty—”
When he opened it, to his shock it was not breakfast – or rather, not just breakfast. Beside the porter stood Harry’s wife.
Now that he was no longer fighting himself, he had thought he would be able to meet Malfoy without fear. He had confronted the dark heart within himself and believed it would cease to have power over him.
There was, however, one awkward moment at the dinner table when Ginny mentioned Harry's visit to the Bones. Considering the frosty silence which had met word of his going, she was quite nonchalant when she mentioned, "Harry visited the Bones last week and saw Susan there."
The Weasley family arrived first, of course. So many of them all at once and Harry remembered how much he had in turn loved and looked up to them all, the family he had always wanted to be part of.
Apparently that satisfied Potter, as he withdrew his fingers and lined himself up against Draco’s body.
Draco was waiting for Harry to turn back to meet his eyes when he finally did. “Don’t rise to it,” he said. “Father always wins.”
“No.” Goyle reached out a meaty paw which clutched a piece of paper. Harry took it mutely. It was a letter, in Draco's hand.
Harry was sick with himself. He had compromised so much already to have Draco: his marriage, his belief in fidelity, his relationships with the people he held dearest. Now he had used his magic against a boy whose only crimes were foolishness and greed.
"Sirius would be delighted," the man himself said, appearing on the podium to join the conversation. His eyes lit on Remus with that happiness that the two friends always seemed to find in one another's company. "It has been far too long, Moony."
“Is that so?” Harry said again, his whole body tightening as he made ready to spring into whatever action necessary.
Draco gave an incoherent snarl, and reached for the cloak he had just discarded. "I tell you no such thing," he snapped. "I tell you only that you ask if you are mine and then you prove that you are not."
“So you can imagine – well, Pansy won’t let me go anywhere near the men she’s dated, never mind if I were actually her brother! Ugh, that woman has harangued me no end about how disrespectful that kind of thing would be to her. You’re lucky Ginny is a more reasonable sort of girl.”
The words seemed to bring Draco up short. He studied Harry’s face for a moment and whatever he saw there convinced him to nod. “I won’t. Never again.”
"So tell me," Draco said, his breath tickling Harry's ear. "What tribulations did the day bring?" His hands came up to rub at Harry's shoulders, soothing the tension from his body.
Malfoy hummed in something that might have been pleasure and might have been triumph, and moved his head toward Harry's face again. At that Harry at last found the will to jerk himself away, but he had somehow been turned so that his back was to the wall and there was nowhere to go as Malfoy pressed his lower body into Harry's, slipping his thigh between Harry's legs.
"I want you. I want you to touch me. I'm so tired of denying it, Draco. You're beautiful. I always saw that but I didn't understand why it disturbed me so much.”
It was inevitable that this was the moment when his eyes should land on Malfoy. He must have spoken briefly with Sirius, or perhaps even Ginny. Harry's stomach turned to ice.
Draco relaxed a little at that, but Harry's mind had made the next logical step. "There have been many for you, I suppose." In fact he knew; it could hardly have been more obvious.
Marble did not come back that night. Harry imagined Draco reading it. Maybe he needed time to think. Maybe he had no interest in Harry any more, had already moved on. Harry had no way of knowing.
The day before had shocked him to his very soul. He had been so ready to believe that Zabini had been right to warn him off, that Draco had turned on him out of fear of his father, perhaps, or spite, or heartbreak… Draco lashed out, certainly, but Harry knew him and his absence – that wasn’t who Draco was. If he wasn’t here to either rub Harry’s face in his indifference or try to save him, it wasn’t of his own doing.
"I told you no, Hermione," said Harry firmly. "No, you do not know what happens between Ginny and I. You and Ron have your own children and your lives to attend to but I had barely seen you for months before this happened and with Ginny so ill and everything focused on the children, I was lonely."
Harry crossed to the left, looking carefully at a fixed point on the wall behind the designated area. It was a nice wall, he told himself. Lovely wooden panelling.
"I don't know what you want," Malfoy said, his shoulders seeming to tighten inwards. "You… I don't know what you want."
"There's a fairly small sitting today," Sirius said as the lift lurched to a halt. "Just the committee on experimental charms and the committee on Muggle relations."
"I wonder indeed," Lucius said, eyes boring into Harry's and then all at once he was benign and amused again. "My apologies, my dear, you are perfectly right. Let us not dwell on such things. Lord Potter, I will see you at the Wizengamot." And with a small bow that was in truth the merest nod, Lord Malfoy took his wife's hand and led her to a seat. Mercifully it was on the other side of the box.
"Indeed, where would we be if we could all defend ourselves?" Draco said, finally dropping his sleeve and looking at Harry with his left eyebrow forming an ironical arch.
He did, however, remember her Bat-Bogey Hex from school and reflected that a foul temper was evidently a quality he looked for in a lover.
Ginny nodded briskly; there was a flash of pain across her face but she did not falter. "I had thought to change the children's surnames to Weasley. Everyone will still know whose children they are, of course, but it would perhaps insulate them from the worst of things. I had also thought of taking them to the continent. Sirius has offered a place in his Italian villa, to which he also will be removing himself." Her tone made it clear that she knew why. "I have not yet decided whether he remains a suitable influence for the children."
"Are you sure you will not accompany me?" Sirius said for what felt like the hundredth time. "You have seemed quite out of sorts for weeks."
Malfoy gave a huffing laugh, his eyes snapping fire. "I see. So guilt has pulled you back to the straight and narrow, is that it, Potter?"
Harry reached out to cup Draco’s cheek, his fingers caressing the tips of his white-blond hair. “It’s a fantasy, Draco. You know it. Lucius would come for you.”
"Oh?" Draco was the picture of nonchalance at this, save for the way his fingers twitched. He had a nervous habit of fiddling with his cufflinks; Harry had noticed that they were charmed to sit perfectly in place, meaning that the only time Draco needed to reach for them was when he was desperate to give his hands something to do. "And what was he arguing today?"
Harry sighed inwardly, disappointed that Sirius' response did not offer him any solution. But what had he expected? Sirius fought the symptoms, not the disease.
In the memory, Blaise only hummed and sipped his drink, his attitude as blasé as if Draco was telling him that he intended to purchase a new book. “That is ambitious indeed, Draco.”
Harry kissed him, couldn't help it, kissed him again. "I wish I had a whole day with you," he said, unable to believe that he was daring. "I wish I could spend whole hours looking at you. Touching you."
The lump moved and Draco’s messy hair poked up from beneath the sheets. “I see. I had no idea you cared so much for Percy Weasley, of all people.”
The knowing look on Lord Draco's face sent Harry into a panic; he could barely bring himself to shake the man's gloved hand.
Harry saw the thought land and slowly sink in. "Well," he said, motioning to rise. "I think I should retire for the evening."
Harry dressed with particular care for the party that night: the finest of his dress robes with a white shirt, cravat and waistcoat. Dobby tied the cravat, chattering away to himself and Harry tried not to remember Malfoy's habit of matching his robes to his waistcoat.
Crabbe Senior hovered behind Lord Malfoy, a grim smile on his face. Another Death Eater who had dodged Azkaban by the skin of his teeth and the application of considerable gold and influence. Harry eyed him for a moment before turning back to Lord Malfoy. "Quite."
“Oh,” Potter said, and then he smiled again, rather shyly. “Well, that’s ok then. I was just a little afraid you would have been put off by all that stuff they write in the papers, you know.”
Malfoy was there with Zabini and his other usual companion, the man with the protruding teeth. Malfoy himself was dressed in powder blue and looked as luminous as ever. It seemed he was in the middle of losing a great deal of money at the card table; Harry took a deep breath and crossed the room, telling himself that this time, he could not falter.
Blaise had never reacted to Draco’s temper that Harry could remember, and he didn’t now, saying merely, “Malfoy! What an unexpected delight. May I offer you a brandy?”
"I love you," he told her over and over again, fiercely trying to imprint it on her so that she would be certain of him in the way he had always been certain of her. "I love you."
Malfoy did not speak again until they were at the Potter's townhouse and Harry was stepping from the carriage. Able at least to appear composed once more, Harry looked back to Malfoy and asked, "You will send for me?"
Pansy shrugged. “Neville knows I tell you everything he tells me, and I didn’t have time to extort it out of him with sex. He’s still passed out dead drunk at the moment,” she said with a sniff.
"Token?" a gruff voice said. Draco reached into his pocket and held up what looked like a plum carved from iridescent stone.
After watching the Pride of Portree positively smash the Holyhead Harpies, Ginny was disappointed by her team's loss but excited to have been to her first match in several years. Harry had shaken off most of the unease of Lucius' words and was now listening to his wife recount some of the highlights of the match as though he hadn't been there.
At length, Sirius had calmed himself enough to speak. "You are right, I did not marry. I did not take on the responsibility of a wife or children. You did. I have duties of my own which come with their own joys and demands. You have many demands upon you and you must find your own joy in your duty. We are English, Harry, and first and foremost an Englishman does his duty."
"Any like this?" Harry made himself ask. "Any with whom you would spend your days and nights? Any others with whom you have lived?"
Draco had already pulled the one Harry thought could be Hastings into his arms, pushing back his shirt and encouraging the boy to tug his own.
“Be seated. Lord Malfoy, you are here to act as prosecutor in the case against Harry Potter, is that correct?”
Draco had celebrated by levitating Harry into the air and peeling his clothes from his body; Harry had laughed and let him and Draco had touched him everywhere, mastering him at last and feeling less triumph than he had imagined, more affection, more delight.
“Isn’t that against the law?” Harry asked as Hermione made circular motions with her wand, muttering to herself.
"He might," Harry acknowledged. "He hates the conventions that restrict him but he knows it is important that moderate voices such as his remain on the Wizengamot – otherwise the blood purists might pass further restrictions. Your father, for example…"
If it were anything else he could talk to someone – Sirius was not always his first choice, but there was Remus or Ron or Hermione. But he had no idea how to tell any of them the lurid things that filled his mind now any more than he could speak to them of the melancholy which gripped him seemingly at random, robbing him of his will to socialise and, in extremis, his appetite and his ease in sleeping.
Harry frowned. He never pressed Draco on the war, and wouldn’t now. He could hardly profess surprise that Draco’s father had encouraged him to support Voldemort.
"I tell you this, Harry, for you must know that the risks you take are not worth the price," Sirius said gently.  "I of all people understand the pain of this kind of love, but to flaunt it is to court disaster."
At this, Draco turned to him fully. “Never that, Harry,” he said softly. “But you know as well as I that we see things differently. This is important to me.”
There was a momentary pause before the courtroom descended into uproar. Lucius was roaring about an attempt to defile even his very son, the crowd, somehow no longer silenced, was shouting
Harry stared at the memory, thinking of what Blaise had shown him. What could the memory be? Had Lucius seen something damning? Would he really involve his son, if the whole point of this trial had been to “save” him from Harry.
"Lord Potter," Lucius responded sardonically. "The title still sits a little ill on your shoulders, is it not so?"
Not a flicker. "He is in town at the moment," Lucius said. "I will see him when I arrive there, assuming he can be roused from his dissolute pursuits."
"The robes are lovely," Harry said, because he was supposed to. The fabric was a dove grey, appropriately modest for a wife and mother though the neckline was still fashionably low. The sleeves were trimmed with
In three abrupt strides Malfoy had crossed the room, walking so close that Harry could smell his breath, full of mead, and the faint scent of soap emanating from his warm skin. "Do you think I don't know why you came with me, Potter?" he said, leaning even closer, far too close for comfort. "Do you think me too naïve to see what you make so clear?"
“She is growing well,” Ginny said. “I did not know you had developed a friendship with Draco Malfoy.”
“Dominic,” said the voice, though it could have been Dominique and frankly Draco didn’t really care that much.
The eyes, though, he knew he could never match. He would never again see that certain shade of green.
There was some undercurrent here that unsettled Harry still further. He felt as though he had been glued in place by the door but Malfoy stepped right in to his admirers, reaching out a hand to one in particular. The boy smiled up at him with something terribly coquettish in his expression and Harry realised with a surge of nausea that he was looking at the boy Malfoy had been touching in the alley. Now, Malfoy smiled as though genuinely pleased to see him and ran a casual hand through the boy's hair. He turned to Harry and as he did so, the way he touched the boy seemed to change, turning from possessive to inclusive.
Harry was confused at being led out onto the street to a carriage rather than to the fireplace through which they had arrived. "We will not travel by Floo?"
The members of the Wizengamot were silent, all looking right at Harry. The public gallery was full again but now had additional guards to keep the peace.
It was the first time he’d been here and it appeared rather plainer than he might have expected. But then, Diggory was not a man given to ostentation and Harry could easily imagine there had once been gold inlay and fabulous artworks which he had seen fit to remove.
“I didn’t exactly appreciate your attempts to force me to stay last night,” Harry returned. He had not forgotten.
Harry smiled vaguely and crossed the room to kiss her goodnight, on the forehead as had become a custom.
Harry bit his lip. His erection was still painfully in need of attention. He was desperate to touch Malfoy everywhere, desperate for this to never end. Once again he felt the presence of a terrible danger but he could not heed it – he desired too fiercely.
I have made her unhappy, Harry acknowledged to himself at last. She loves me deeply and in return I have made her very unhappy.
Harry reached out and took it. “Thank you,” he said softly, hating that Sirius had had to think of how to care for him because he was too weak to do it himself.
Remus smiled at them both before moving away. Harry watched him go, unsure what he was looking for until his eyes fell on Teddy with a group of other Hogwarts students. He was laughing, his face lit up and happy, his hair bright blue. Harry watched him for a moment until Teddy turned, perhaps sensing his gaze. Their eyes locked. Teddy faltered slightly before his smile grew wider, his hand raising in a gesture of greeting. Harry forced himself to smile back before looking away, ignoring the confused feeling in his stomach.
Harry smiled as best he was able; he remembered being hopeful of young love but that innocence seemed very far behind him. "That is marvellous, of course. But-- If I could give you one piece of advice, Teddy –"
"Looks like there might be something of the invert to you after all," Malfoy said, and he was smirking and his cock, now flaccid, was still exposed, and Bertram was smothering a laugh and Kirke was kneeling at Harry's feet with come still on his mouth and Harry thought the shame of it all would burn him alive.
"You said it yourself: I am not your acknowledged lover, nor likely to be. There is too much standing in the way. You wish me to make a better impression on your parents? Understandable if we were courting - but even if they came to accept me as your friend do you sincerely believe that they would welcome a
Ginny spent a moment after admiring herself in the looking glass before placing a delicate kiss on Harry’s mouth. "I am ready. Let them come and see us." Ginny sighed, resting her head against Harry's shoulder. "Let them gawp at little Lily. You know, there are perhaps ten people I will be happy to see tonight? Sometimes I do wish that you were not to be Lord Black."
Harry wondered if that would send Lucius into a rage but he barely acknowledged that his son had spoken, saying only, "Draco, please," as though he had merely spilled tea. "Children are so important," he went on, addressing Harry. "They carry on our traditions. Will yours be taught the traditional pureblood values?"
Draco hasn't slept in days. He hasn't eaten, hasn't washed, hasn't done anything but sip water when he remembers and relieve himself when his body insists. He must smell, he must but he can't tell anymore. The vaults below the manor have always smelled slightly, damp and sweat and human suffering; now the air is stale with decay.
Harry slid his thumb and forefinger beneath the bridge of his spectacles and rubbed his face where they pinched him. "Kreacher, please do not mutter like that. You know it upsets us."
“It’s so much more convenient for Harry, living in the city when he must attend the Wizengamot every day,” Draco said blandly, interrupting Harry’s thoughts. He was occupying himself by pouring coffee, and ostentatiously realised as he did that there were only two cups. “I’ll just ring for another cup. Or do you prefer tea, Ginny?”
Fawley and Smith were standing to one side, waiting for them to finish. Harry almost wished they would tell him to stop, pull him away, so he wouldn’t have to decide for himself when the last time he would hug his friend for two years was over. But they didn’t, and eventually he had to let go.
Sirius swallowed.  "You have felt the presence of the Dementors, so you know.  It is as though all the happiness in the world has been stripped away, as though all the joy and life and everything good turns to ice and pain. Imagine endless days and nights of that, with no respite. Imagine your happiest memories disappearing if you try to revisit them for comfort. In the first month I went to bed at night weeping and rose in the morning wishing I were dead.  By the end of the third, I was merely waiting for the end."
Ron emerged from the shadows to where Harry could see him through the bars. “I know. I know. I’m sorry. Just… he’s my best friend. And I know I can’t see him but I brought his dog.”
"Feed it to me," Draco said, sticking out his tongue. The sight he made was filthy, wanton and depraved, and Harry moaned, opening his mouth to let Draco's come slide from his own tongue to his lover's. Draco sucked on his tongue, pulling it into his mouth and chasing his own flavour. He moaned into Harry's mouth and writhed a little; Harry's still-hard cock ached.
Harry knew it had. A young girl, only just of age, had asked for consent to marry a Muggle, and broke the Statute of Secrecy because she wanted to be honest with him. The Muggle had called her an affront to the natural order and run her though with a sword before setting fire to her parents' home.
It was only after another hour of such greetings that Harry was able to snatch a few moments alone, with the excuse of making sure Morag, the nanny, got the children back to Grimmauld Place before the evening's festivities really began. He took the four of them to the Apparition point, kissed the boys and Lily gently, all three of them very nearly asleep, and watched them Disapparate.
Sirius, Lord Black, had raised Harry for most of his childhood, and it was with pleasure that Harry now greeted him.
Draco sighed. Harry reached out and squeezed his hand, but the pleasure of the day was somewhat lessened.
Harry swallowed; he was doing her a disservice and he knew it. Hermione would never turn her back on anyone who needed her, especially not him, after everything they had been through in the war.
Harry raised her fingers to his mouth, guilt gnawing at his gut. "That is all," he said, brushing a kiss across her knuckles.
Harry should have expected that. Draco had at first taught Harry how to take all his length into his mouth, how to bring him pleasure in this way. He had curled his fingers up inside Harry and encouraged Harry to do the same. But then, one night while their pleasure raged between them, Draco raised his head from around Harry's manhood to ask, "Would you let me now show you the true pleasures of Greek love?"
Reprieved, Harry smiled gratefully at him and they continued their meal. But the world had found them at last, and both were a little subdued - until, that is, Draco pulled Harry through to the bedroom.
"Quite right, Teddy," Harry said, though he was thinking about something else. "I'm sure many would tell you it would be a connection worth fostering, but if you do not care for his company then why seek it?"
A lot of readers angry with Draco at the end of the last chapter! That's part of why this fic sat for so long. But Harry and I both figured out how to handle it, as you'll see ;)
“Seems reasonable to me,” Diggory said before Hermione could reply. “Bailiffs, take Mr Filch back to the waiting room and bring in…”
Draco. Looking at him wide-eyed. “Harry, I’m sorry. I’m too late and I’m so sorry. Please — don't let them change how you feel about me! Not ever!"
“We have to take you through the Atrium to get to the departure point,” Fawley warned him as Smith put cuffs on his wrists. “There are going to be press there, though we’ve cleared the public as best we can.”
“The cheese is French.” When he doesn’t get further reaction, he adds, “it will spoil if we do not eat it today, and there’s too much for just Scorpius and I.”
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Greenhand incident. He’s the son-in-law. The evidence is circumstantial, but it should be enough to get approved for Veritaserum.”
“I have flatmates, but they’re nice,” says Harry, once they duck in a building where it’s no less hot, but where the shade is soothing enough. “Don’t be weird or too posh, though.”
Hermione looks pinched, her hair falling over her forehead in tight coils. Her glass is empty, so she pours more for herself.
Harry’s wedding band sits in the pocket of his jeans, and he feels ten times heavier without it. He cannot stop reaching for Draco’s hand and the reassuring weight of his fingers in his. Draco indulges him with a smile, before diving back into his work with enthusiasm and the desire to get to the bottom of things before dawn.
Draco harrumphs weakly into a pillowcase. He turns to Harry and simply looks at him, doesn’t talk. It’s one of the most enjoyable things he has found about Harry, the way silence is never heavy, always something to repose in together rather than suffer through. His father’s silence was always pointed and disapproving, and Draco has never been able to bear his friends’ quiet. He always used to fill it with everything and anything, glorifying himself and mocking everyone else.
“Listen,” Malfoy says with a quiet wince. “I hate to admit it, but I need help on this case. I’ve been stuck for the better part of six months, and I refuse to drop it.”
Draco swallows, cannot speak. It seems to amuse Potter; he quirks a smile at the corner of his mouth.
Very little people know that Lucius Malfoy died of dementia. That is to say that only Draco, Scorpius and the family healer were aware of this peculiar pickle. When Healer Wiltlittle hears Draco’s worry about losing his head, he swishes his wand with the grace of one who saves lives on the daily and harrumphes tiredly when he doesn’t find anything.
“There would be no reason for the Aurors to be at your house if we did not find Dark Magic artefacts as soon as we stepped in.”
Draco wets his lips and stares at the hand. He slowly brings his fingers to rest on the back of it, brushes lightly but purposefully and Harry looks wildly around and takes his hand off.
Malfoy had big hands which, Harry had learned, were great ear scratches and belly scratches and most especially scratches at this place right at the bottom of his spine. Harry remembers whines and happy pants and tail thumping. So many things that should have been prevented by human embarrassment and understanding of social decency but that his wolf was just too happy to do without.
There’s small tarts on a floating tray at his elbow, courtesy of the Malfoys’ house elf and Harry sighs in contentment.
He enlarges the shrunken record player in his pocket and deposits it on a dry patch of grass. He presses play, almost forcefully because that would be the worst possible outcome of this night if it didn’t work. The music swells and he sighs in relief.
“We would simply like to discuss some details with you and your wife. My partner, here, might offer some new insight to the situation.”
Ron leads him to a room with a huge window that allows them to look upon the interrogation room. Harry expected the werewolf who had attacked him to be big and frothing at the mouth, a terrifying horror. The person sagging in the seat on the other side of the glass is gaunt, waxed white by the artificial light, creased by hunger and fear. Harry falters in his steps and stares. He expected a man.
Harry Potter knows that in films, the hero saves the world and is whisked off to his happy ending shortly thereafter. Nobody ever shows him stumbling up the stairs looking for a bathroom, or eating the dusty remains of a loaf of bread or sitting on a step while friends and acquaintances come to kiss his cheeks as he tries to simply breathe and be.
“Morgana, you’re disgusting,” Draco says, hiding in the pillows while Harry lays biting kisses on his defenceless jaw.
No, he’d rather deal with this alone than bring Scorpius in harm’s ways. He can count on the wards to awaken his son if he’s attacked.
Harry’s tea is strong, almost cutting in sharpness and he smiles around the rim of his teacup, feeling warm and doted over. Draco likes his morning cuppa light and mellow, to begin the day with a small ripple, ease himself into the water. Harry likes to be awakened by the caffeine equivalent of a freight-train. It heats something squirmy in his chest in the knowledge that Draco brewed him a cup of tea he considers vile.
The coffee shop (because it is a coffee shop, and how uncanny is that) doesn’t look as posh as Harry had feared. The bell above the door rings when they push it open, and the interior smells of sugar and coffee. Harry breathes it in, feeling his mouth water. He hasn’t eaten much for lunch, just enough not to require Janice’s intervention and he finds himself ravenous.
“Oh, Merlin and Morgana both,” he whispers. He’s found the Saviour of the Wizarding Word and is half in love with him.
They pass the section of wall that is only drywall and torn wallpaper from where Harry had ripped away the portrait of Walburga Black. Malfoy raises an eyebrow but doesn’t comment further.
Malfoy looks good in his anthracite shirt and black robes, the royal tilt to his head that even the war and the hunger did not succeed in washing off of him. He sneers at Harry; it’s familiar, and he welcomes it gladly.
“Hello,” Harry says again and pulls away to look at Draco’s put-upon face. He smiles when he sees it.
It sounds innocuous enough that it takes a few seconds for Draco to feel alarmed, and when he does, he stops neatly in his tracks and finds himself flooded with the feelings of ants in his fingers, eating away at his control.
Draco takes a sharp breath in. When Harry meets his gaze, it’s cloudy with anger. He smells of betrayal.
James is a small little thing who seems to fit in the palm of his hand. Harry stares in the eyes of his son, wide and blue, looking tired and fussy, and falls in love ten times over. He holds Ginny’s hand, kisses the back of it and feels himself tear up, eyes stinging with the sudden flux of emotions.
In a matter of days, Maybelle Purplestock is sentenced to life in Azkaban. Harry doesn’t know how to feel about that, but he knows what he doesn’t feel: relief.
Harry pulls him in by his shirt, kisses his smile, sharp and purposeful, gathers him close until they’re sharing heat and breath. Draco pushes his wand under the pillows before they roll around on it and closes his hands over Harry’s shoulders.
Harry waits for the silence to settle before turning to Mr Bruegel. “Would you say that you’re an anxious person?”
But what exactly has happened to Astoria Malfoy née Greengrass remains a mystery. Did her husband’s tumultuous past come back to haunt them? Was the Wizarding Justice system wrong for letting him go so easily? Our readers can only wonder.
“I need you to fuck me,” Harry says finally and it settles solid and palpable in his stomach as he voices it. Becomes even more true as it leaves his mouth.
Wolf-Potter is still big and impressive, a canine taller than usual wolves. His dark coat makes him even bigger in the night, shuffling on his four legs, eyes piercing. Even though their last encounter involved significantly more petting than Draco would have ever anticipated, he's still acutely aware that Potter could easily chomp his head off in a clean bite.
Harry snorts but doesn’t comment further. They look over the pavement and the scorn of Aurors trying to keep onlookers away. There’s a new rhythm to Malfoy’s pulse, and Harry naturally turns to him.
After, Harry buries his nose into Draco’s throat and breathes there, damp and hot. He expects Draco to shove him off, but instead he curves a hand around Harry’s skull, nails sharp against his scalp.
Harry closes his eyes and swallows his initial response; he would have screamed if given the choice. But Ginny is worried and certainly doesn’t deserve the worst of his ire. She’s already been through a lot with the public outrage their break-up sparked.
Potter’s warmth and small noises of contentment have lulled Draco in a state of serenity and he feels himself drift in his chair, completely boxed in the soft prison of velvet. He pushes at Potter’s flank with his foot and is immediately alarmed at his own ease with a murderous creature.
Harry sends a surprised look to Draco. He is seated here in his couch, unknowingly rubbing Harry’s scent all over his clothes and it suddenly doesn’t feel as innocent as it was.
He eventually gets him to sit back down at the bar and comes back to their booth; Draco has blocks of ice instead of hands.
Our readers may not be unaware that Harry Potter, saviour of Wizarding Britain, has been under a bit of a strain lately. Between attending the funeral of every victim of the Battle of Hogwarts and repairing said castle back to its glorious prestige, Harry Potter has not known any rest.
“She’s good, very tired of being pregnant, but good.” He turns to Teddy, “She would have loved to come tonight, but her back is giving her hell,” he assures him.
“If you can keep your colleagues in check, I can be cordial with you in front of Teddy. Not before.”
He relaxes back against the grass when he recognizes Pansy and the undignified, crushing hug she’s giving him.
He doesn’t scream when he gets Malfoy on the chin, and he barely grunts when he receives a scratching slap in answer.
They nod at each other and Draco makes a show of putting the food on the night-stand and reaching for his trousers. He pushes his legs in them, tacky with sweat and pulls them snug on his hips, buttons them promptly. It’s scorching to be subjected to Harry’s gaze and not feel confident enough to meet his eyes. Draco is red; he knows it.
Ron looks tired and soot-streaked when Harry stumbles into his and Hermione’s cottage, red hair plastered to his forehead with sweat.
“Oh, I see.” Malfoy articulates slowly. “My life is worth less than theirs? I wouldn’t have expected this kind of discrimination from you.”
There’s a doe, laying on her side. Draco watches her clench, a full body flinch, and it takes him an additional second to understand that she’s giving birth.
Harry has spent the last two hours surrounded by Malfoy’s scent; it’s a heady note traveling in the space between them.
Wandless magic is easier that Harry expected. Everyone had made a big deal out of it, but after two weeks of nonstop practice and too little sleep, he has his dishes washing themselves with the swish of a hand. It makes him wonder if he would not have been actually good in school if he had been a little less threatened by Voldemort.
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
“Oh, she’s doing something very scandalous.” His smile blooms into something bigger and it’s torture for Harry to witness it, and to continue witnessing it when he doesn’t turn away. “She’s on a date with a Muggle man.”
“Oh, come on, Peter, Mr. Malfoy is simply doing the job we’re paying him to do,” says his wife as she strides in with a tray.
Draco finds him later, in the same spot, unmoving. He smiles, big and full of promises that make Harry shiver, slides up to him and tips his head back for a kiss, natural as breathing. Harry gasps, surprised by the immediate heat of it and feels the sharp grin of Draco’s mouth against his.
Malfoy tips his head in acknowledgment, and Harry closes the connection. He hurriedly leaps up the stairs to get ready.
Harry doesn’t have room to move and lays there, panting open-mouthed against the sheets, hands scrabbling to find purchase. Draco is a giant wave that crashes upon his shores in long continuous strokes and Harry struggles to breath through it.
“Oh really? What about the Victorian self-constricting manacles? Do you think I make use of those often?”
When they hear the rise and fall of Albus’ voice, Harry presses them in an alcove, close and sweet and Draco feels like a teenager, clumsy and dry-mouthed. He experiences a sharp longing for a nostalgia he doesn’t get to have, youth spoiled by war. Potter is warm against his front, hand sure and demanding around the fine bones of his arm and his eyes shining in the midday light. Draco stares as they wait for the noise to die down.
But there was no one to sit him down, pat his back and inform him that his wolf-self would turn out to make the dumbest decisions one could ever settle on.
Harry hits Draco; his blood sings with the rush of adrenaline. It’s alcohol spilled on the coals of his anger and blazing in a roaring inferno. Harry punches and he cannot remember why he didn’t sooner. It feels good to hurt Draco. It always has, even when the horror of Sectumsempra tainted him with the shadows of almost-murderer. It’s almost natural at this point, like a basic need. Eat, sleep, punch Draco.
He bends down to recover the package under the bed, where he had shoved it last night. He opens it and gets his hand on an envelope; he had all but forgotten about his Mother after the unending spinning of apparitions. He finds himself robbed of his breath, staring at the cream-coloured paper.
Harry doesn’t think much about Malfoy after their liaison inevitably dissolves with attempted murder. Or he does, but he’s careful to do it late at night, when the world fades into nightmares. He never tells anyone. He keeps it in his chest through the War and through the forest of Dean and and through the Battle of Hogwarts and through the trials after.
Harry knows, but it still hurts him when Ginny tells him that he’s childish. His eyes water when Luna gently presses at a tender spot on his cheekbone.
Harry nods and frees his hands to knot them at the back of Malfoy’s head. Malfoy moves; Harry gasps into it, the rocking of their body like a pendulum, pressure pushing at their skin. He strains his neck to taste Malfoy’s mouth, to lick into it and share his breath, a back and forth of air, a mimicry of their bodies.
When Harry wakes up the next morning, there are two owls hanging out of his window. The first he recognizes as Hermione’s. He grunts at it in annoyance. He doesn’t want to bother with yet another migraine-inducing request to consider getting on the board of the Fund and Aid for Lycanthropy, Lycanthropic Individuals and Communities.
“Hello Mrs Bruegel,” says Draco with a picture-perfect smile, “Thank you for receiving us today. This is the associate I talked to you about.”
When Harry gets out of the bathroom, he finds an exasperated Ginny, a giggling James and a purple Albus. He stays lilac for five days.
He feels like this bonding business should make him more anxious; it doesn’t. This evening is not very different from the ones when Draco decides that he needs answers to a question, let it be Harry’s or his own, as inconsequential as they may be. Harry enjoys the coolness of the high-ceilinged room, the sight of the glittering shelves and the way light reflects in Draco’s hair.
Harry nods and ponders on it. Malfoy slowly sips at his tea next to him, looking at the room over the rim of his cup.
“Hi,” answers Harry, and promptly closes his eyes, squirming closer, until he has buried his head in the crook of Draco’s neck.
“No, you’re…” Draco stops. There’s something more here. He looks over Potter, relaxed in his lean against the wall, hips cocked, arms confidently crossed. Draco swallows. Potter’s eyes follow the movement of his throat. “Oh.”
The smile deteriorates, sours on this lying mouth. Draco gets closer, grabs at the long black robes that cover the intruder and feels the threads dig in the tender skin of his fingers.
Ron and Hermione come and go,replaced by Neville, Ginny, and surprisingly, Seamus. They press in his sides and it digs in the aches there and Harry tries not to wince, but the pain swells and swells, until he cannot bear it any more and he stands and walks away. No one follows him, and it’s a fresh relief rushing through his head.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” He furiously takes Draco’s money from him and shifts through the stack of bills before pushing two under his cup. He then shoves it back in Draco’s pocket for him. “Do you just walk around with a bank vault in your pocket? We’re gonna get mugged. Fucking hell.”
He shows up at the Ministry in a scourgified shirt that might be a bit too creased and trousers that might not be as clean as he had initially assessed. People turn around as he walks through. It might be because he’s Harry Potter; it might be because he has not bothered washing his hair in a few too many days.
Here’s my report for Greengrass. The contraband is still down at the lab, so you can ask there if you need it.
Harry smiles crookedly at him and Draco wants to kiss him right there in front of everyone.. There’s anticipation in the air, and he has no idea if muggles are as accepting as wizards of homosexuality, but he feels the sudden need to grab Harry by his stretched neckline and pull him in his lap.
At the third apparition, feeling a tad dizzy and unsettled, Draco disarms the curses and opens the package, pulling out one of the potions. He gulps it down, sees the downy hair of his arms turn a shade darker, and goes cross-eyed trying to see if it worked on his head too. He walks for a bit to settle his spirits and disappears again, trying to focus on not splinching himself.
Harry hates Hogwarts College on sight. It stands tall and unyielding in the dark night, a block of obsidian on the black sky. He scowls up at it, his sneakers whining on the damp grass, his bag digging uncomfortably into his shoulder.
“No Statute of Secrecy in effect tonight, Auror Potter?” asks Malfoy, leaning against the wall, shrouded by shadows.
The pub serves a large variety of beers and lagers and Draco, who has absolutely no idea of what is good despite his promises, simply orders two different pints and a plate of chips. He checks that his Glamours are still firmly in place in the mirror behind the bartender and brings everything back with him with a delicate swish of his wand.
The build is slow, pulling Harry toward his orgasm in small increments. Harry feels it. It builds and builds and builds, pushing at his organs to leave room for the fire that burns in his loins. Harry almost fears that he will explode; he reaches for Draco, takes a hold of his hand and bites, not viciously, but with intent. Draco moans a strained song in his nape.
“Shall I kiss you then?” Draco asks, deeper than he meant to, and feels pink spill across his cheeks. He wonders where he’s pulling all of this confidence from.
In the living room, Tommy is reading under the yellow lamplight, and Draco clears his throat twice before Tommy deigns to look at him.
“They’ve been used in Wizarding courting rituals for a long time; they symbolize love and honesty and balance and were often used as a medium of proposal.”
Draco despairs; even his chewing is disheartened. He looks at Albus and sees a child that needs care and support, but probably doesn’t get it, because he has a mother dealing with grief and a younger sister stricken in the same manner. There’s no one for Albus, the middle child, the Slytherin Potter.
Malfoy shakes his head and tightens his fingers against his glass. His heartbeat is still a steady thrum despite the pause.
Harry looks at the bottom of his glass, makes the amber liquid twirl against the sides. He takes a sip of it and meets Malfoy’s eyes.
No one dances under the next full moon either, because by then the reporters have gotten wind of where Harry’s proclivities lay and they’re now crowding the Manor’s doorstep, chimneys and windows but not his pipes because Draco is a talented, if vicious, spellcaster.
It seems inappropriate somehow, that Harry Potter’s first meal after returning from the dead is a leftover from the last supper.
Ron blinks a few times, but seems to finally get on with the program. He stands up and goes to coax Harry along with a hand, but withdraws it at the last moment. Harry tries not to bare his teeth at him.
He is considering the pros and cons of getting smashed at his godson’s birthday party, when the french door opens. Harry guiltily looks over his shoulder to see Malfoy, harassed and tired. There’s hair falling over his forehead, and it fascinates Harry. He can count on his fingers the times he has seen Malfoy dishevelled, and they’re always omens of big changes in his life.
On Potter’s first death anniversary, Scorpius anxiously waits by the fireplace all day long and almost collapses in relief when Albus comes through the Floo, looking blurry and sad, like he’s not quite sure where the edges of his body are.
Harry has already left for work, so he stands there for what feels like a minute, but what is actually a good hour, up until Tommy walks in and asks him “Alright, mate?”
Malfoy nods. “Of course I was. I wouldn’t be in this line of work if my connections weren’t useful.” He takes a breath to look at him, really look at him, head tilted in assessment. Harry feels naked under his stare; he wants to whine. “What can I do for you then?”
Harry makes a noise of outrage and sits up in bed, ready to hit back when he realises that he holds a laundry bag. Further investigation teaches him that he is holding his uniform in hand.
“I mean, you have a ridiculous amount of money, but what are you going to do when you run out of it?”
“The special apple tree is what bonded us, show some respect,” he growls teasingly. James sticks his tongue out and Harry looks behind himself, through the window.
“That’s not… That’s not what I’m asking.” And Harry looks a bit scared himself, a bit alarmed at where this conversation is going.
Silently, Potter turns around, tugs on Draco’s sleeve to get him to walk. The cloud churns above, low over the leaves and the wind picks up, sends Draco’s hair in his face, fast and stinging.
Harry reaches out, and his hand closes on air. It feels unfinished. He has to convince himself that Malfoy wasn’t an illusion.
Harry looks gobsmacked. Draco walks away from him, strides long and purposefully fast; if nothing else, Draco has spite on his side and he will use it.
London smells awfully of hot asphalt and piss, but Draco doesn’t have the time to be assaulted by it; he’s walking with great steps to catch up.
Harry enjoys the yield of his mouth against his stomach and watches Malfoy with some difficulty, glasses askew, as he breathes hot desire on his skin. Harry shivers, feeling his need swirl into his chest in the most delicious way.
“Well, he did go too far! He’s trying to bring back the Death Eaters, they are talking about the glory of pureblood supremacy out loud at parties!”
Harry likes being Head Auror. The fact that he complains about it everyday, and the headache he leaves his office with are just minor setbacks. It’s the life he’s wanted since he was eighteen.
Harry doesn’t know what to say, so he keeps quiet, lips firmly pressed against each other. Merlin knows what kind of pitiful noise would get out of his mouth if he didn’t.
Draco finally gets his shirt open and pushes it to the sides. His hands follow the curve of his ribs and Harry squirms, pushing his shirt over his shoulders.
Draco stumbles a few steps back, heaving loudly, fury making his eyes glint sharply in the dim light.
Potter tags along as Draco spells the lights off and makes his way through the cavernous Manor, ignoring the muttering of the portraits.
“It’s not working,” she says. Harry shakes his head, feels the tears cling to his eyelashes. “This marriage is not working.”
“I could have. I wanted to… You’re…” He settles back on the couch, as to ponder more carefully on his next words. “Your wolf is friendly. With me.”
Harry looks properly bored for a waiter and buses tables with neat, practiced movements; whenever he gets close to Draco’s table, he looks him over with a heated weight to his face that makes Draco squirm in his seat.
The silence falls over them, light and undemanding. Harry watches Malfoy curiously, notes the marks of an exhaustion that has sat too long on his face. Malfoy looks frail, run ragged, but he has lost the nervous energy that seemed to be the only thing driving him forward in 6th Year.
Malfoy hums, gliding through the kitchen to Harry, before reaching in the cabinet next to his head for a wine glass. His hair is short again, Harry notes, cropped at the back and brushing his forehead. It looks good, makes him look more settled in his skin.
“That’s awful. Oh, Morgana.” Pansy looks green, like she’s swaying and grasps at his arm to keep herself standing. “Where have you been, then?”
Malfoy doesn’t answer him; he looks back at Harry speculatively. Harry wants to bend his head and lets Malfoy rest his hand at his nape, an echo to simpler communication. It’s a show of trust that Harry is not sure is warranted but that he wishes to give all the same.
Draco pushes the tray aside; the china rattles as it slides on the bed. He pulls himself closer and climbs in Harry’s lap, sweetly tilts his head back for a kiss. His breath is warm and sugar-sweet and Harry arches his neck to meet him, eager to lose himself in Draco again.
“Come on, let’s go to bed,” he says and ignores the way Potter rubs himself against his legs when he stands up.
He pushes at Draco’s hips and slithers his hands under the shirt that rides up here, almost falling over with the shiver that shakes him and the feeling of warm skin under his bare hands. The scent of Draco’s arousal might kill him. Harry presses his nose in the curve of Draco’s jaw, where he smells of need and enthusiasm and wants to live here, never go anywhere else.
He died today, he thinks wildly, and sits down in a fit of giggles. He laughs so much that he’s crying, and he smears grime in his eyes as he wipes them, gets his fingers tacky with black tears.
Harry is shamelessly hiding from the screeching children in the kitchen, opening the fridge to peer at beer labels. Ginny is somewhere with Luna, avoiding the noise together, and Harry doesn’t want to barge in, not when Ginny is too hormonal to withstand his sulking.
Draco is a beacon through the green expanse of the Manor lands, hair gleaming under the midday sun. He looks rather fetching in his modern robes, neat lines highlighting the sharp curves of his body. Harry’s fingers itch with the need to touch.
“What does that mean?” He asks, rising further, posh accent following. “I thought I had the room to myself.”
Due to a last minute withdrawal from Morgan, four years old, James proves that he makes a wonderful flower girl.
Harry falls in Draco’s open arms and feels like he would drown without the desire Draco is pushing under his skin. He’s buoyant with lust, floating over his usual worries and sinking into Draco’s flesh.
“And Potter does hate his job. Don’t let him fool you,” says Malfoy with mirth in his eyes, taking a liberal sip of his wine.
“You madden me,” he breathes slowly over Draco’s collarbones. “I’ve spent the last few years watching you. So close and yet, always unreachable.”
The snake uncoils and slithers up Draco’s finger, until it spools in Harry’s waiting palm and turns on himself once more, becoming a simple ring.
Harry swallows, voice tied by desire, knot pressing against his Adam’s apple with each maddening movement of Draco.
“Listen, my shift is over in a few and I don’t want Becca to have to deal with you and whatever weird business you’re up to.”
“I love children, but I’ve found  that  large groups of them should be enjoyed in small doses,” Malfoy says with an aggravated look. Teddy and his friends can indeed be very loud.
Draco is a bit wary to spell the lights off and close his eyes with a werewolf in the room. But he’s already done it once and he’s too tired to think about it. He drifts.
Harry blinks back at him like he’d momentarily forgotten his existence. Draco tries not to let himself be hurt by it, but there’s a twist in his chest all the same and he bites his tongue to keep his emotion down.
Harry squirms in his seat, has to stamp down on the urge to shrug. His heart is a wild beast in his chest, crashing in crescendo against his ribs.
Draco shakes his head; his hand is fire-hot on Harry’s arm; he wants to let himself burn under the touch.
The United States is a dreadful nation. Wizards here have very little interest in the old ways: our new apartment, closer to the clinic, is equipped with all sorts of ridiculous Muggle equipment. At least Scorpius finds it entertaining: he spends more time in front of the talavision than on the books we ordered for him.
Draco does; Harry closes his eyes on the urgency washing through him. He feels Draco’s breath brushing on his hair, maddening light tingles, and then wet heat, drowning anything else. The ocean roars in his ears, heated waves crashing over his head. Harry is reduced to the sole sensation of Draco’s mouth on him, of Draco’s fingers inside him, pushing him closer and closer, repetitions of stimuli that come and withdraw. Completion is at arm’s reach, and yet has never seemed farther for Harry, it cannot come fast enough, or it comes too fast, he doesn’t know any more.
Malfoy snorts; it isn’t a pretty sound and he looks sheepish for the second it takes to realize he had produced it.
“I just wanted to… Listen, I don’t want to get into details but the wolf just wants company alright?”
The Manor has become a quiet, soothing place for Harry and he doesn’t ignore the irony of it. It’s quiet in the way that Grimmaud place never is, always bustling with people and noise, toys flying overhead in a buzz.
Draco is thinking of Wizarding Britain, feeling both nostalgic and vindicated, when Harry props himself up on an elbow to look at him.
Potter shakes his head and the curls bounce around his head, too long. He looks weirdly childish like that, despite the salt and pepper of his hair. Draco has to look away.
Harry nods and tries not to wince visibly. He stops behind Teddy's seat and ruffles his purple-streaked blond head.
The funeral is an awful affair. Draco goes in support of Scorpius, who himself is there in support of Albus. He stays behind and keeps an eye on his son from afar. Scorpius hangs his head, close enough to touch Albus and lets Ginny Weasley, Potter’s ex-wife, hold him in a long febrile embrace.
“Here we are,” Malfoy says, and lets go of Harry’s arm. There are tingles there, where Malfoy folded his fingers.
Draco stamps out the embarrassment and stretches like a cat in the heat of the bed, exposing himself further. Harry flushes, and it’s only the temperature that keeps Draco from jumping on him, feline and unforgiving. Harry turns back to the ceiling and they don’t talk for a moment.
Draco is silent at that, simply looking at him with a long searching gaze. There is something itching at his consciousness but he cannot quite grasp it yet.
The pints thud on the table and a bit of beer sloshes down the sides but doesn’t spill on the already sticky wood.
“Studying, of course, Professor!” he answers with the sort of cheekiness Harry is used to see in Ginny.
“You’ll get wrinkles if you glower like that,” says Malfoy, looking too cheerful for the discussion.
Harry stands, feels the trip of his heartbeat as his own. He doesn’t have to think about it; that is the sound of a lie.
He reaches Draco’s hand and kisses the back of it, sees him smile and flush, vulnerable in the small hours.
Draco shakes his head, too overwhelmed by the scorching heat of Harry’s palms on his chest, the flickers of his thumbs on his nipples. He tugs at Harry's shirt, slides his hands under, along the ridges of his spine.
Speechless, Draco can’t do much but pant at Harry, and lets himself be rolled off onto his side.They look at each other without touching any more, the heat of the room and the sweat on their skin stealing focus as desire retreats.
By the time they get to the woods, he’s winded. Potter stops him with a hand at his elbow and puts another at his mouth to urge him silent. Draco doesn’t say a word and obey; he bites his lips hard to not complain.
When he straightens out, Harry sees drops of water run down the white length of Malfoy’s throat. Harry doesn’t mean to, but nothing seems real any more, so Harry chases the drops with his fingers bringing water back to Malfoy’s lips. Malfoy’s breath fans on Harry’s finger, and for a second, he thinks he’s mad, Everything is dream-slow, caramel-sticky, and not even his wild heartbeat can bring him back down to earth.
Harry nods soundlessly; he touches at Draco’s forearm with the faintest of touch and sees the shudder that courses through him. Harry wants to press his fingers in the veins here, feels his pulse beat against his thumb. He wants to speak, but doesn’t know what to say, doesn’t know what would preserve the moment. Draco wets his lips and Harry feels himself fall apart.
“No worries. I didn’t think you were the type,” assures Harry, and places a hand on Draco's knee, like he can open his skull and sees what Draco is thinking.
The surf breaks over his body and Harry comes in a beautiful elongated second, pleasure razing under his skin, devouring nerve endings almost painfully.
Teddy turns away to do it; James makes a weird face at him. Harry is sufficiently fluent in his son’s facial expressions to understand something along the lines of “I have no idea why he’s being weird”.
Harry grins and waves at him. Draco turns toward the commotion and Harry sees him smile, slow and fond. Harry gives a small acceleration until he stands by his side, under the spreading branches of the apple tree and the small green fruits it bears.
“Well, I thankfully knew nothing of my father’s sexual proclivities,” she says it with a grimace, “but I knew him well enough to know he would never leave before his time. He found too much satisfaction in making everyone around him slightly less happy.”
“It’s not posh, but it’s an establishment of decent standing. Or used to be, if you listen to my father. But that isn’t the point. These,” he waves his hand over them without touching them, “are only activated when near witches and wizards.”
“What happened to your finger?” ask Ron suddenly and Harry feels his heart trip over itself on his way out of his ribcage.
“Greenhand was rich and mean. He had no friends, his wife passed away ten years ago and he was in France during the War,” Malfoy lists on his fingers. “That doesn’t make him very popular with anyone.”
They get off the bus and Harry steers him around, against the glare of the sun on the white facades of buildings. The day is tipping into evening and so Draco keeps his head down and feels the top of his ears burn red, the heat burning against the nape of his neck.
Harry sits in the large chair in front of the desk. He sinks a little bit into the leather cushion, engulfing him comfortably. It brings him close enough to smell the amusement on Malfoy, a new wave of embarrassment settles over him, hot and red.
Harry sits down next to him, knee touching the outside of his thigh; Draco lets the point of contact warm his whole body.
Harry is not quite sure if he has words to explain it and so he does the first thing that comes to mind, he wrenches his own wedding band away. The line is where it’s always been, sitting dark and menacing under the gold.
He does a load of laundry and makes his drying cords float with a wandless incantation, puts clean socks on, and apparates in the back alley behind Malfoy’s office.
“Okay.” Draco nods to himself; he can do this. “These are charmed toys, used as gifts to toddlers. They are an important ritual in wizarding history; I got one of those on every birthday from my birth to my first year at Hogwarts.”
“Don’t be. It’s my fault… Harry.” She breathes in wetly, Harry looks away because he cannot witness her hurt any more. It’s too sharp, he might cut himself on it. “Harry, look at me.” He does. “I don’t think I like men.”
“Of course, that’s the option you would like to take, Merlin.” He pinches the bridge of his nose. “You really need someone to tell you that you do not have to fix things as they come. You saved us all once, died for it twice. Quitting is all right. You don’t own anyone.” Draco looks at him with burning determination. “You don’t owe anyone your time. You’ve done more than enough already. Let’s someone else fix the mess, for once.”
Draco is at loss for words. He hopes that Potter taking a step back helps. It doesn’t. When it happens, he only feels cold.
“I thought,” Hermione pauses to sigh heavily and swallows half of her glass with a wince. “I thought you would come talk to us if you had issues with Ginny.”
Draco looks down in his cup of tea. No he did not; he spent the night tossing and turning worrying about Potter’s state and Draco suspects that Potter is aware of that, what with his unexpected powers.
You are invited to the retirement party of Gareth Greengrass, Head to the Department of Mysteries, on Friday, 27 of January 2006 at the Department of Mysteries.
“We can’t say that you’re not efficient. Not even twenty-four hours on this case and you’ve probably solved it. You should work for me.”
Draco tightens his hand around his wand and viciously spells his windows shut. He sways out of his office and down the stairs, checking on the wards, who are still dormant as they were earlier. He stumbles out of the garden, and it’s still here, unmovable and standing.
Draco pauses. He’s mildly tempted to call someone, send a Patronus to Scorpius and not be alone in this. He has no idea what he is faced with, but knows that the Aurors cannot be arsed to come over unless under duress.
Ginny is seated on the sofa, feet in Luna’s lap when Harry stumbles in Grimmauld Place, too sweaty and hot to feel alive or responsible. Neither of them lift up their head at first, engrossed in their respective books – Ginny’s, a quidditch magazine, Luna’s something undecipherable from Harry’s point of view. Probably from any point of view.
“I know,” Potter says simply and looks at him from under his dark lashes. “My presence is fickle and you were the only one certain of it yesterday.”
Malfoy looks back at him; there’s still this strand of hair that Harry wants to push back falling over his forehead.
Their clothes unravel around them, stitches loosened. Draco is surprised enough by it that he takes a step back, and witnesses his sleeves fall off his arms, sliding to the floor.
“Ah.” Malfoy sits back down and gestures at him to do the same. “I thought your policy was to not talk about it.”
Draco is sweating through his shirt (Harry’s shirt, but still), wringing his hands in a nervous knot in his lap. The book lies between them, definitely not levitating at all.
“I wouldn't have pegged you for a reheated-tea kind of bloke,” comments Harry, but he takes a sip of it. It sits on his tongue, sweet and warm.
They go home hand in hand; the mark on their skin has curled further in and Harry trips over his feet looking at it.
“Hello you,” Draco says and kisses him with an intensity that leaves them breathless. “You’re not supposed to be here.”
“They’re literally bonded honestly,” James is saying, gesturing with a toothpick where he’s perched on a barstool, “magically bounded! That should count in the eyes of the law.”
“The first cup is enjoyed for warmth, not flavour,” he says with absolute certainty and Harry finds himself nodding along, convinced despite himself. “The second is where you can begin to add sugar; no milk, not yet, that’s for the third.”
Harry cups his face in his hands. They’re dry and a bit rough; they sweep the remaining charms away and Draco sags.
Then they do not have to wait any more and they’re in the master suite. Draco presses against Harry, intent. Harry’s mouth stretch on a laugh, aborted, and they stay there, too close for a casual discussion but not yet willing to cross this peculiar bridge.
“I have no idea. But I have to stay away. For as long as I can. If I’m not around to oppose my father, I’m not around to lose my inheritance and my title.”
Draco feels himself tense, taunt like a bow, ready to draw an arrow. He looks away, shoulders rigid and tries to swallow against the knot in his throat.
Draco raises a pale eyebrow without even looking at him; Harry wants to kiss it. Draco is really hot when focused.
Malfoy blinks and nods, pale eyelashes catching wetly. Harry leaves, fingers burning, heart squirming.
I still have the contact details of the Healer who took care of James. If it reassures you, he’s from South Africa and wasn’t here during the War.
And he flickers back into absence. Malfoy stares at the bark where Potter was leaning. He tries not to shiver, but his teeth hurt with how tense he is. He shudders and cannot stop himself.
“Merlin,” says Malfoy airily, “you would think that Muggles wouldn’t be able to make this much noise without the use of Sonorus.”
Scorpius gleams like a jewel through the garden; blond hair where light ricochets, almost blinding. Albus and him jump around on the grass, agile and young, careless of everything and safe in the knowledge of their parents watching over.
“Yeah.” He draws in a rattling breath, feels his eyes hurt with too much time spent awake. “Yeah, they were in… The resistance, I guess. The Order of the Phoenix.”
Harry is bent at the waist, dry heaving over the pavement before Draco has blinked the effects of apparition away.
Malfoy had taken in the deep blue creases under his eyes, a sharp contrast to himself, gleaming in his dressing robes, looking rich and untouchable, and he had promised to look into it. Harry had hated the pity, but he doesn’t regret getting Malfoy involved. It’s his job, after all.
There’s a shift in Malfoy’s heartbeat; Harry had not registered that he was so attuned to it until it changed. He clears his throat.
“Ah, here you are, hiding yourself,” Andromeda says, poking her head through the doorway. “Harry, darling, I’m afraid Ginny had to go home.”
Then he faces Draco; Draco who looks ethereal in the silver moonlight in a rumpled jumper and ink stains. Harry had imagined it a hundred times since the evening in the study and had never quite pictured him like that. He would have thought that Draco insisted on getting changed into robes or a more modern tuxedo. Instead, he watches Draco smile back at him, tall and beautiful in the middle of a deserted meadow.
Draco has the distinct sensation of tumbling off a cliff; a knot the size of Russia in his throat, and lets his cup rest on his knee, perched here with the slightest pressure of his fingers.
“You know it’s called F.A.2L.I.C, don’t you?” he says, pushing back into Harry’s space and pining him to the mattress with a leg thrown out, going to straddle him.
Malfoy only sighs. They fall into silence, and Harry prepares himself for an uncomfortable night. His arse is already falling asleep on the concrete bench.
Harry pacifies her with a wave of his hand. “I take no offense, ma’am. But I don’t think that’s it.” He takes a breath and leans forward, elbows on his thighs. “Where were you on the day of Mr Greenhand’s death?”
He rubs soothingly at his finger and Draco relaxes back, eyes wary. The small snake coiled there shivers under Harry’s touch. It gives Harry an idea.
Harry takes a deep breath over his cup and tries to focus on the notes of bergamot rather than Malfoy’s proximity. He can hear his heartbeat, a steady and comforting thrum close enough to ease the adrenaline out of him.
Draco takes offence to that, but doesn’t say anything, just stares and watches Harry laugh at him. He has never been that good at comebacks.
Malfoy extends a hand. It’s not gloved this time, and Harry feels the dry warmth of it when they share an awkward shake. Malfoy bobs his head, looking a little dazed.
Harry gapes but doesn’t make another move to obliterate the dragon. Draco slowly opens his hands to release it and doesn’t look at the mess of his reddened flesh, but rather at the long, sinewy flutter of its wings. Harry is mesmerized; he tenses when the dragon gets near him, sending a lick of fire his way, air heavy with the scent of coals and sulphur, but he simply looks.
“And only seeing Scorpius once in a blue moon? No. Draco and I’s relationship is perfectly cordial, friendly even, and the Manor is big.”
The bed is unmade and even easier to fall into for it. Harry pushes his shirt over his head and hears it rip over his shoulder; he’s too mad with lust to care, and the distant thought of torn seams is replaced by the need to get closer to Draco, join him on the sheets.
“A good night, I take it?” asks Ginny, right before she looks his way. Her smirk slides clean off her face as she looks at him. “Oh my God, what happened to you?”
Potter is seating on his desk, one day, bare feet swinging back and forth. Draco pauses in the doorway.
Harry takes it from his hand and smooths his hair back to appease him. He laughs one of his delighted laughs. Harry kisses his forehead and does the same to James when he begins to pout.
“Part of my probation was to help with the Fund and Aid for Lycanthropy, Lycantropic Individuals and Communities,” he says to the ceiling. “I met a lot of werewolves and it was… It was good, honestly.”
“I think you’re right.” Harry swallows, he has to look out through the window to talk, to the white expense outside. “I think we’re already dating.”
“When I gave you your wand back, it was wrapped in newspaper, in a old box I found at Grimmauld. And a muggle newspaper. A recipe of a German cake.”
Morning is not as hard as Harry would like it to be. He’s embarrassed to open his eyes and have the crystal clear certainty of Draco’s body next to him. He would like to throw the blame on alcohol or ill-timed madness, but he knows that it’s not possible. Sex with Draco Malfoy is long time-coming, almost prophetised. It’s the glares above the tables in the Great Hall, it’s the painful punches in times of peace, it’s the knowing look over a cup of tea. Harry could only resist so long.
“I get needing to blow some steam off.” Draco seems to think of it. “Ah, poor Potter, having me torture you again, years after being schoolboys.”
I thank you for your thoughtfulness. Please, pass my gratitude to your son, Scorpius enjoyed the drawing.
He watches it wash everything in fire-bright orange through the windows of his library and takes a sip of his cup of tea, enjoying the first warm day of spring, closing his eyes on it. His fingers follow the edges of the book in his lap, and he preemptively savours the time he will spend reading it. His evening is shaping up to be quite pleasant.
Harry tries not to trip over his feet, floored that Malfoy apparently thinks them close enough to share amusing confidences. Life has been too weird lately; Harry definitely feels like he’s dreaming, moving without purpose from one scene to the next.
“Where the hell have you been raised that you have no idea how to handle money?” Harry asks, as he presses closes in the seat next to Draco. The interior of the bus is hot but the physical touch of Harry against his side is scorching; molten desire suffusing through his skin.
Harry nods, puts his cup back in the tray to link his fingers with Draco, almost painful in their grip.
Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, was seen in Diagon Alley this last Monday after seven years spent without news in the United States. He was accompanied by his only son, Scorpius Malfoy. The staff at Witch Weekly offers all of our sympathies to the young boy for the passing of his mother.
Harry looks up. “Hello to you too, Malfoy,” he says calmly. “Mrs Malfoy,” he adds belatedly to Narcissa Malfoy, who looks regal and untouched by time next to her son.
Malfoy doesn’t act like anything is amiss, but his gaze trails to Harry every few minutes and remains here for a handful of too long seconds; Harry feels them ticking by as his face burns, his stare like a physical brand. He keeps his head down and tries to look like he has no idea that Malfoy is doing it.
Al looks forlornly in Scorpius’ direction who is blearily waking up, but let’s Harry manhandle him in a standing position.
Draco opens his mouth. He doesn’t have an answer to that, so he closes it again. Potter continues on smiling.
“Merlin’s beard, Potter, everyone and their mother know I’m a homosexual and that this marriage is purely decorative.”
“Listen, we don’t even have to talk to each other,” Harry says and brings the fag to his lips once more. It’s good; it calms him down. “Let’s just smoke and go back inside, all right?”
Harry swallows again. He can hear Malfoy’s heartbeat and it’s now a loud drum reverberating through his skull.
Draco would like to say that he’s above such childish antics, but he presses on, faster. The knots in his chest dissolves with his hurried steps.
He begins to walk, out of the alley and on to a busy London street. Harry feels out of place with his red Auror coat, but Malfoy tugs on his elbow and they stride purposefully between people.
Harry carefully picks himself up and hobbles down the halls of the Manor, up until he’s outside the Manor’s gate, feeling even more naked under the blue open sky. He apparates back, feeling himself burn crimson by both sun and shame.
There are holes in the walls of the castle, and Harry looks through them as he wanders. He sees the morning creep through the fog, and the sun lose the bleak quality of murder at dawn.
Harry blinks at him, there are freckles brought by summer on the bridge of his nose and they make a wonderful target for Harry’s kisses; it’s incredibly hard to restrain himself from doing so.
Harry looks back at him, so rattled that Draco wants to reach for his wand and Obliviate it all away, keep him from this reality where his parents are killed once more.
Draco looks down at the pavement; it’s cracked and a small virtuous flower peers back at him, waving cheerily in the light breeze.
“And so I should accommodate you without a complaint. You’re men are beyond overzealous at this point. I call them downright aggressive. ”
Draco is flush with desire by the time he finally presses Harry into the mattress. He bites Harry’s shoulder and repeats it when he’s rewarded with a moan. He rolls his hips, feels twin arousal against his own. He pants down at Harry, feels him bury his hands in the silver of his hair and skim the curve of his back as they move, closer and closer again.
David is tall, has his head in the clouds (ah!), and spends most of the Sunday luncheon looking around with wide eyes at the self-serving silverware.
Harry tugs a few strands of hair back in his hat, only succeeding at making others poke out; Draco does it for him with a long suffering sigh instead.
They stay quiet for a long moment and Harry relaxes back into his seat. He doesn’t tug Draco with him, but opens his arms when he makes a move to join him, lets their bodies fit themselves around each other. The summer-silver of his hair is very soft under Harry’s touch and he buries his nose in it, smells the wonderful and comforting scent of Draco’s pretentious shampoo.
“He needed it,” he answers simply. “And if you really wanted to thank me, you wouldn’t soak me in rain before leaving without a word.”
Fuck Dumbledore for waking up fifteen years too late and deciding that the Dursleys weren’t fit for the education of their nephew. Fuck Dumbledore for not allowing him to stay with Hermione and Ron. And fuck Dumbledore for sending him off to the poshest school he could find this side of the equator.
Draco wrinkles his nose and pinches at the sensitive skin of his ribs. Harry yelps and throws himself away.
Malfoy licks his lips; it makes Harry’s blood sing. He looks away and closes his hands into fists, feels his too sharp nails sink into his palm.
It’s the middle of winter when Draco sees the rose bush. It’s not planted in his rose garden, where his mother had gathered the most wonderful and rich collection of blossom, but further away from the house, tucked in a clearing in the woods.
She unwinds her scarf viciously and strides through Grimmauld to the kitchen. Harry trails after, waiting for his sentencing. Hermione thumps two glasses on the table, so violently they almost tip over; she pours the liquor in an angry slosh and nods at Harry to take a seat. He doesn’t argue.
“What the hell!” shouts Harry from at top of his lungs and crawls backward, away from it. The display would have been amusing if Draco didn’t have to rescue the dragon from being flung across the room with a backhanded slap. He holds it in his cupped hands, feeling the great heaving breath of his burning lungs sear the skin there; he grits his teeth against the pain.
Draco simply toes off his slippers and his robe and turns up his sheets. Potter looks suspiciously calm from his seat at the end of the bed.
The mark sits on his finger, unmoving. Harry is glad that his wedding ring comes to cover it, glad to be still married.
Draco only frowns down at him, which only makes Harry grin harder; he doesn’t avoid Harry’s mouth when he kisses him, morning breath and all, but it’s a near thing.
Malfoy looks miserable the next morning at breakfast. Harry stares and waits for him to stare back. It doesn’t happen.
Draco shrugs (quite undignified for a pureblood heir, if you asked his father) and pats his pocket to make sure that the waiter didn’t distort his clothing.
Draco hesitates for a moment; it feels incredibly intimate to hand his wand to someone else, someone that is not from his family.
“Well,” he clears his throat, “I already told you that the door was tempered with, but according to our investigation nothing was stolen. The body was… Well, I imagine you know what a Strangler does to a body.”
Nobody ever says anything. Harry doesn’t say anything. He can’t when Malfoy shuts him up with a kiss.
Malfoy looks flushed, attractively pink in the early evening light, and the glint of his eyes tells Harry that he too is drunk. They stumble from one room to the next, poking their heads through the living room doorway to find both of their five-year-olds napping, curled around one another on the carpet.
His anthracite eyes look lighter in the mid-afternoon light of the kitchen, blue cabinets shining in their reflection, trapped with Harry in the cloudy sky.
“God, yes. Yes, I would love to,” he kisses all over his face. “I would love to, but…” Draco tenses, Harry props himself on his elbow to look down at him. “The kids have school tomorrow and I promised Ginny that I would get them to school awake and excited for knowledge.”
Harry desperately wants to; he’s reaching for Draco and pressing him back in the mattress in a breath.
Harry feels the snake ring at Draco’s thumb, cold in the early summer heat, and the complete band around his finger, twin to his own. It’s almost burning against his skin.
Malfoy bids goodnight to everyone with a kiss, with the exception of Harry, who watches him walk away, through the door, then through the windows and the rain. The mark under his ring burns, seems to warm the metal. It’s a shock against the rain-cold of his fingers.
It seems to rob the muggle of his voice. He gapes at Draco for a second before shaking himself, red making his skin bloom darker.
Harry raises an eyebrow (and no, he didn’t learn it from Malfoy) and takes a sip of his wine before answering.
Ginny, please. Let me apologise in person. I miss you, and the kids miss you. I’m sorry and I will make time to have dates again. I should have seen that you felt neglected. Please, talk to me.
Harry drops backward and Draco squeaks at the nonchalance with which he drops his wand on the bed covers. He swiftly gathers it back against his chest and welcomes the thrum of magic that chirrups at him when he picks it up. He sighs, holds himself immobile for a second before he flops down next to Harry, closes his eyes to the glare of the ceiling light.
Malfoy is sprawled on his bed, blond-white hair falling over his forehead, looking up at his phone. He drops it when Harry enters the room, sits on his elbows to stare at him.
After long distracted minutes, he finally gets the courage to look up and say, “Can I take this back home?” because he actually wants to read it and have the occasion to close this case. He cannot do it with Malfoy so close even if leaving has him ache everywhere.
“Maybe the beast seated on my couch!” Mr Bruegel growls, trying for menacing. The sounds of his heartbeat has him landing on desperate instead.
“Sure,” Harry says, but doesn’t move. There’s something in Malfoy’s expression that prevents him from doing so.
He stands in front of his dresser and wishes for the formality his Auror robes would automatically provide. He had liked the layers, like an armour against the world. In red, he wasn’t Harry Potter, but another protector. Someone everyone could turn to in need.
“You weren’t risking your life,” he says sharply. “That’s not how I meant that.” Harry deflates, takes a long breath in to settle himself, to swallow back his defensive anger. “It just… hurts. The transformation is loud. I don’t… I don’t want anyone having to sit through that.”
Malfoy leads the way to the front door, climbing the front steps; Harry tries to look anywhere but at him.
“He went to your house, your parents’ house, on Halloween night, and…” He clears his throat. “You’re not supposed to have survived it either. I don’t know much, because it has become more fable than reality at this point, but it’s said that he cast a Killing Curse and it bounced off of you. Dumbledore, the Headmaster at Hogwarts, used to theorize that your mother cast a strong protection on you. A shield only a mother could cast, I guess.” He shrugs and touches Harry’s forehead, right next to his scar.
Albus follows without a word when Draco tugs him in the direction of the kitchen, and stays mute when he pushes an array of cheese and bread under his nose. Draco cuts himself some soft brie and gestures to Albus to do the same.
Draco grips at Harry shoulders, shudders when he feels the wet heat of a tongue at his throat. He closes his eyes, speaks with a wet catch to his voice.
Harry takes the lead and brings them to the front of the restaurant and then outside, casting a shielding charm against the rain. Malfoy follows him with a second of delay, looking cross and ridiculous in his rain-spotted robes.
After three days of this, Draco stops mid-stride to round up on Potter. He corners him between a still-life and the portrait of a slumbering dog.
Harry turns, face serious and neutral, not sure how to answer to this new development. Draco has been particularly tight-lipped about his parents.
“Good. Now that you’ve admitted that, you don’t have a lot of options. You either quit, or you change things around for it to be enjoyable.”
After that, Draco spends most of his free time in the garden, looking over his shoulder when he strolls through the fragrant meadows, in high leather boots against the wild flora.
Draco is not alright. He brings his cereal to Harry’s room, puts it on the night-stand and stares at the floor for another hour, piecing together what he knows of Harry’s life and trembling every time the fog clears a bit.
Malfoy understands the subtext. He nods. “I thought you would want that. I already wrote to her. She’s waiting for us tomorrow.”
“Ah, so it was a conscious effort. I wondered. There’s only so many of Teddy’s events you can miss. You didn’t have to go through the pain of assuring that we would be cordial to each other then.”
Harry walks into the door when he goes. His shoulder smarts but he doesn’t even try to justify himself to Malfoy, he simply bolts out of the building. If he doesn’t, he would sink to his knees and wait for Malfoy to comb through his hair.
“And what? We fuck and you go back to do whatever you’re doing for Voldemort? Was the fucking part of your mission?”
“And I gifted you the first blossom of the year and the last snow on the same day,” says Draco with a short dip of his head, looking down at his hands. “They’re supposed to represent resilience and perseverance in our relationship.”
He rolls his eyes, and Harry feels like Malfoy picked it up from him, from their exasperated encounters in the blue kitchen, hiding away from the kids. The realisation rolls nervously in his stomach.
Harry would let Draco tear through him, bite his way inside with his blunt human teeth if he ever asked for it. He opens his mouth to him and lets him try, containing his shudders by pushing his hands in the soft giving texture of Draco’s clothes.
Draco spares him from further conversation and tugs him by the hand through the winding halls of the Manor, until they’re face with the intricate motif of green olive trees on a door, moving in the breeze and Harry is too awed by it to realize that their in front of Draco’s bedroom.
“And so will I.” He holds Harry’s glass at the stem, with very gracious fingers, looking intently back at him. Very solemnly, he says, “With this hand, I’ll lift your sorrow.” Harry feels himself colour. “Your cup will never be empty, for I will be your wine.”
He shrugs, bony shoulder briskly moving. Draco has spent most of his life trying to look unbothered, too mature to throw a tantrum and he recognizes it in Harry’s posture.
Then silence for a moment. There’s an obnoxiously cheerful song on the radio and Harry bobs his head in rhythm with it. Draco tries not to let himself be pulled along.
The reality is that he missed Malfoy. Harry had not felt such comfort as he had when Malfoy had ruffled his head and scratched his spine with his short nails. He’s almost ashamed to have taken advantage of his canine appearance to bask in the comfort of human touch.
The fabric evaporates between his fingers, mist pouring over his knuckles and Draco stands in front of nothing. The grounds are laid flat and untouched, the grass dark in the moonlight and the roses gleaming like diamonds between their thorns.
“Want to,” Draco corrects with a pained expression. “Fine, Potter, I, alone, will endeavour in making you miserable.”
Harry doesn’t say anything, buries closer into Draco’s scent and tries to ignore the memory that wants to resurface. There’s a tone of embarrassment in Draco’s emotions, and Harry licks at his skin to taste it.
“Oh, yes, fantastically. David is a charming man. I met him, you know. He’s a meteorologist.” Malfoy smiles, small and amused at the corner of his mouth. “He studies weather. Isn’t that fascinating? To study something on which you have no impact whatsoever?”
Draco is at loss. Last time he saw Potter under this canine form, he hadn’t let him in by choice and Potter had categorically refused to leave, tagging along with Draco everywhere, pushing at his hip with his muzzle. He has half a mind to forget that anything happened and go back to his book, but he cannot leave a giant werewolf pacing in front of the Manor, sending pebbles through the gates with the agitated shift of his front paws. Not when the closest muggle village is, in fact, too close. Who knows how Potter reacts to muggles.
“I wouldn’t know what kind of depravities you get up to, Malfoy, I’m not interested in learning about those.” Harry winces. “Don’t put images in my head.”
Harry spends two days on his couch, embarrassed and miserable, before deciding to do something about it.
Draco licks his lips and feels a squeeze of nostalgia in his chest at the memories of Hogwarts; at the warmth and easy camaraderie he’d left, thinking he’d find them again, somewhere else.
Draco straddles him to shed his coat and shirt and Harry laughs at his desperation, fumbles with the buttons until Draco tugs sharply enough to be free of clothes.
The restaurant is quiet in the way that only very posh restaurants are, and the silence of so many people is unnerving. Harry feels like he could cut the tension with a knife as he walks in. He straightens his shirt and wand holster at the wrist and tries to look clean and put-together, not like he has run through the Ministry Atrium to get here on time after work.
Harry looks to his side and there he is, awake but not yet aware that he’s being watched, propped up against two pillows. The noises of the house filter through the decaying Silencing Charms.
David stops staring at the floating plate of smoking poultry long enough to give a hesitant smile back.
Draco has to put a hand on his mouth to stop him and Harry sighs in relief. They don’t speak for a long while, frozen like that.
“Listen, stop, pause. No, I’m not… I mean, yes, I am. I just. I just mean, you’re cool.” Harry looks like he wants to hit himself very, very hard. He takes a big breath. “I like you. And, okay, fuck, I’ve known you for three days, sure, but I like you. And you don’t know what to do with your life, and sure, you have lots of dramatic baggage. But there’s Oxford, where I’m going to be next month, and that’s not a bad city. But I want to know: do you think you would like to move to Oxford sometime? Soon?”
Harry hugs him tight and breathes heavily against his ear and they hurry home, breaking into a jog and scaring families out for a walk. It’s all worth it when Draco pushes Harry onto the bed and has his way with him.
Harry goes. The water burns his bruised knuckles when he passes them under the tap, joints made tender by hits and a vigorous healing. Harry hesitates there, in front of his mirror, blood washed away in pink ribbons of water. He looks at his wedding ring and is afraid to take it off; he feels the mark warm under his consideration.
“I don’t mind you know. David stays here most days. And nights, yes. We’re talking about his moving in.”
“It’s a very respectable…” (pureblood, his brain supplies), “name,” he finishes lamely and sags a little bit. It must sound strange to a muggle, but Draco doesn’t have the faintest idea of what’s a normal muggle name.
“Do you get off on the infidelity, then? Is that it? Is that why you get down to the level of us poofs?”
Harry opens his mouth to biting teeth and the tearing pressure of anger, his hands digging in the furious slant of Malfoy’s shoulders, seeking an anchor here. Kissing Malfoy is so much pain and yet, Harry cannot stop. He licks blood off his teeth and presses in between the furnace of their bodies like every breath is in an implosion, dragging him closer every time.
Harry seems to melt a bit at that and lays a hand on his shoulder; close, but friendly enough not to raise any alarm.
Draco himself very mildly complains when Harry sweeps him off his feet and throws him over a shoulder to destination unknown and just holds on tight for the apparition.
Draco takes it in his hands and freezes. It’s a long moment before he turns his own wrist to compare the two of them. Harry stays silent.
“It doesn’t and that’s why we’re doing this today,” he explains to his son. Harry stops and gives a double-take at James. “Is that a skirt?”
He’s manhandled on his back and Draco lays between his tights, biting kisses in the sensitive skin of them.
By the time tea is ready, Scorpius is back and Albus collapses against his shoulder, not crying but pressing here for comfort. Draco leaves them to it and goes away discreetly.
“Harry,” Draco touches his arm with soft fingers, Harry turns automatically to him. He’s smiling softly. “We are.”
He dances for a long time, pays for another drink, too expensive but sweet as dawn. He kisses a stranger, short and fleeting before letting the crowd take him once more. He dances again, closes his eyes. When he opens them, Malfoy is staring back at him.
Harry expects her, like a bad tempest coming to flatten his garden, and yet it comes a bit as a surprise when she shows up at his front door. Hermione, brandishing a bottle of whiskey in front of her like a weapon, looks the part of a vengeful spirit coming to take revenge upon his body. Harry freezes in place, stops the hug he was about to give her.
Draco gives him the room across from Scorpius’, with the wonderful view to the front gardens and the great fountain at the center of the driveway, where rainbow fish break over the water in great splashes of colour. Albus thanks him with a nod from under his monstrous unkempt beard and settles there.
By the time he has finished his second drink and considering a third, the sounds of hurried footsteps precedes Scorpius; Draco has a armful of upset teenager to comfort and not much space for his feelings on the matter.
Malfoy harrumphs, but Harry doesn’t pay any attention to him. He stands up and goes to the bars, leans on them to see if there’s someone around. Malfoy follows with an outraged gasp. There’s an officer eating a chocolate bar, watching his massive computer there.
“Potter, we will not be going easy on you and your progeny,” he sniffs pretentiously with the familiar royal air.
“Hello to you too.” He peaks between his fingers. “Malfoy,” he adds belatedly, as if calling him by his family name would put some distance between them.
Harry nods, mute. Draco sees his Adam’s apple move as he swallows, a nervous tick he begins to recognize, one of the small things that assures him he knows Harry. It’s certainly not the right time to be mooning over him, but Draco lets himself smile privately, small and personal at the corner of his mouth.
“Potter!” Malfoy hisses, too close for comfort and the budding headache crawling up his neck. “Potter!”
Harry rolls his eyes and sprawls more comfortably in the armchair. The alcohol doesn’t really have an effect on him, but he likes the warm weight of it in his stomach.
Harry sighs and rubs at his temple, tries to ease the tension there. He lifts his hands to his head, but feels his right wrist being yanked down immediately. He blinks at it.
He lifts it away from him the day Malfoy comes ringing at Grimmauld Place and Harry opens the door, baffled.
He doesn’t understand why he cannot be alone with his thoughts for a week or two. Why everyone panics when he stops responding to letters. His friends want him to use his new status as leverage in the fight for werewolf rights; Harry doesn’t. He doesn’t understand why they still bother him when he already said no.
Malfoy clears his throat, after having secured his son at his hip, and Harry is helpless to look up at him.
“I’m not married any more.” Draco brings Harry’s hand to his lips and kisses it. “We signed yesterday,” he whispers between two knuckles.
The gates open and Potter comes barreling in, aggressively sniffing Draco’s crotch in greeting. Draco pushes him away with a horrified gasp.
“A few months before my death, we met in Diagon Alley right as I was out of my Mind Healer appointment. You said to me “trouble in paradise?” and then immediately after: “sorry”.”
“They just…” He bites the inside of his lip, feeling like a great betrayer. “They’re just so entitled. So quick to jump to conclusions.” He sighs and takes a burning sip when Draco nudges his cup toward him. It burns through some of his frustration. “They never do anything truly reprehensible, but they do not hesitate to humiliate, to tear someone’s dignity to shred, I’m…”
Harry is already tipsy when the first course floats in, finally melting in his chair after hours spent tensing in his office. It feels like all weeks are long, lately. At his elbow, James is being properly loud for a seven-year-old, desperately vying for Teddy’s attention, and Harry occasionally passes a hand through his wild hair to get him to settle down, with very little success. Any time he attempts it, he gets a smirk from Malfoy, who sits between his soon-to-be-ex-wife and a very quiet Scorpius. He turns to David to avoid it.
Harry feels it like a fist against his ribs, cold dread in his stomach. He had stupidly hoped that the sex wasn’t such a simple affair; that he could build trust from it and extend that to Malfoy like an olive branch. That he could get him to seek help from the right people. The certainty that Malfoy doesn’t care one bit about him slides uneasily at the back of his throat; Harry doesn’t dare examine why.
“I’m afraid there’s been an emergency. I have to go.” He considers Harry for a second. “We’ll have to cut this pleasant talk short. I’ll say goodbye.”
“I wish,” he says fervently in the cushions. He turns to look at her; she’s blurry and he tries to blink her back into focus, before remembering that his eyesight-correcting charm must have worn off. “Glasses?” he asks hopefully.
Draco blinks up at him and flips them over with a push of his hips, bites at Harry’s mouth with the full burning extent of his desire. Harry feels scorched by it; he opens his arm to the incandescence.
Harry turns to him and takes a step closer; Draco pulls him in closer by the hand. He’s so close that he can feel Harry’s breath on his face and he bends down slightly, until his nose is touching Harry’s cheek, sharing air.
The bloke looks tired and is decidedly scowling down at him from under the most impressively unkempt hair Draco has ever seen on anyone in the service industry.
Draco feels himself tighten with anticipation, sees Harry flush crimson, and deeper again after a few seconds. He squeezes the hand he is holding and feels Harry jump rather than look at him.
“I hate my job,” he says, from the security of his eyelids. When he opens his eyes, Draco doesn’t look triumphant as he would have expected him to be; instead he finds him serious-faced and invested, arms crossed on the table. “I can’t bear to fucking stay there another second.”
Harry hums, taking a bite on the sharp curve of Draco’s jaw. He straightens up, straddling his hips and stretching. Draco’s eyes get dark, pupil big and hungry as his gaze drops to Harry's chest. He follows the hair gathered on his sternum and trailing down in a line over his belly button, and lower, where desire makes him hard and interested. Draco swallows a single bob of his Adam’s apple, and fits his hands to Harry’s hips, thumbs pressing in to keep him steady.
He easily shrugs off his kid and turns to him. He hands him his glass; best not to spill anything on his suit before the ceremony. James takes it with a grimace.
Harry wishes he could walk away on that  perfect parting repartee. As it is, he relaxes in his seat and looks at the ceiling. A stain looks like a dancing horse; Harry almost calls for James to come see it.
It’s a bit easier to be in the same room as Malfoy, now that he’s settled in his seat, further away.
Inevitably, his mind circles back to Potter. The memory of him that comes unbidden is the one of the very few times he has seen him after the War, when he handed him his wand. He remembers the rigid tenseness of Potter’s fingers handing him the rectangular box, the handsome jut of his jaw as he had told him “not to mention it.”
Alcohol sounds like an excellent idea to Harry, a good distraction to his canine desires. He cannot really get drunk unless he empties the bottle (and a few others) all by himself, but he won’t be unaffected.
Harry presses himself against him once more, and Draco opens the circle of his arms to welcome him and kisses him, again, and once more when Harry disentangles himself to lie on the bed.
“Yeah, sure.” He looks at Mrs. Bruegel and she uncomfortably stares back at him. “Your father had many enemies. Do you remember if any of them said anything in particular? Death threats? Even threats of violence?”
“Brilliant idea to come here,” Malfoy says haughtily, and Harry has to grit his teeth to keep himself from commenting that it was his idea. “Come on, let’s get this over with You wouldn’t want to ruin my trousers.”
But now, he gets to go back home and keep Lily with him. He gets to see her tap spots of colours on the couch,  worry how to take them out before anyone comes back home, and feel relieved when they disappear by themselves. Now, he gets to open a book and read for pleasure rather than duty. Now, he can spend hours in the kitchen experiencing on taste and recreating his favourites from Hogwarts. It often means that Luna has to pass after him and whip up something actually edible for everyone, but Harry has the time to learn. He has time to make errors and not let them deter him. He has time to learn how to cook a roast beef to tender perfection, and how to do housecleaning charms wandlessly. He has time to see his children grow day by day.
“Right,” Malfoy says after he has settled on Harry's couch (and doesn’t that make him warm, seeing Malfoy makes himself comfortable in his own scent), “according to my investigation, the Strangler was his own.”
He feels watched. He doesn’t see anyone, but there’s the peculiar prickling at the back of his neck, a familiar sensation that years spent away from Hogwarts had dulled. Draco almost trips thinking that Harry Potter sent a hex his way, but nothing disturb the calm humming of nature around him.
Harry laughs; his heart flutters in a fond arrhythmic beat. He ignores it and turns to the french windows, peer through them at the frozen landscape, endless white all around.
The pub is rowdy, but Draco leads Harry through the crowds with a firm hand at his back. They get a booth at the back, right next to the toilets and he pushes Harry into it with stern instructions not to move.
“Well, if you’ll excuse me,” he says, slipping away from his son’s grasp and breaking into a jog when he tries to follow.
Draco doesn’t answer immediately, simply closes his eyes and touches the back of Harry’s hand with his own.
Harry is too tired to dance, too tired to be standing, really, but he still lets Seamus tug him by the sleeve under the neon lights. The crowd is pressing on him on all sides, and he has the sudden image of Al tightly swaddled, snug and comfortable. He  feels like that as hands and backs and hips close on him and carry him through the club.
He groans, feet and hands cold, body aching. He mildly hoped that everything was a very active, very surrealist dream made up by his canine mind. But no such luck.
Draco sits with it for a few seconds, drumming a slow beat on the table top. Potter keeps silent, looks outside the window and at the gardens beyond, green and sweet in the summer.
He remembers the blood on the tiled floor, and the stark contrast of it with the grey sheen of Malfoy’s skin. Malfoy looks greyer, somehow, almost translucent. Harry feels compelled to touch him, to push his fingers into his skin, and reassure himself that he’s real and alive.
Scorpius is not yet here, still lost somewhere on the grounds for a walk and so Draco is alone to deal with a newly orphaned boy. Draco has experience with one’s recent loss of a parent; he went through it twice after all. The difference being that Draco expected his parent’s death. They were old and made older by the war, rendered sick by the haughtiness British society had turned on them.
Draco swallows. He does not succeed in swallowing down his own guilt, but he does meet Potter’s eyes without recoiling.
Malfoy shrugs his shirt on. Harry feels defenseless where he is, naked and seated on the floor, Cushioning Charms fading under his legs.
Draco, baffled by the muggle currency, just gives a few bills to the man and watches him gape like a goldfish.
It takes him all of five seconds to disarm Mr Bruegel and have him on the floor, writhing in bonds, throwing uncreative insults at Harry. Mrs Bruegel hasn’t even stood from her seat. She gapes at Harry.
The next day, he’s seated at the breakfast table in the solarium, perusing the newspaper but mostly thinking about Potter when he appears again. Between a second and the next, Potter sits in front of him, arms crossed over his chest.
Harry nods through the blooming migraine and tries to relax when Malfoy circles his elbow with his hand, grip sure and gentle. They pull through space, like elastic-bands stretched too thin, travelling too fast when they’re released.
Harry grits his teeth and ignores him. He goes back to their seat, tugging Malfoy along without a word.
Harry is not yet asleep when Draco presses in behind him, too close for the summer, and whispers in the tangle of his hair, almost wishing for the words to lose themselves in the dark curls, get trapped in the locks.
“Nothing to worry about at the moment, some contractions. Her water didn’t break yet, but she thought she would have a bit of a lie-down before the festivities begin, so to speak.”
“Ah,” says Draco and finds enough courage to look in his direction, “I suppose I must ask you to point me to the nearest establishment.”
Harry doesn’t have an answer; he wants to do something stupid like offer the comfort of his fur. The mention of Lucius Malfoy should never translate to to this kind of reaction. He sips his drink.
Harry buries his face in Draco’s neck, presses his mouth there. He feels him shiver under his breath.
“Sleep well?” Draco asks and Harry’s heart jumps. He turns fully on his side, feels the brush of the sheet on his hip.
Draco’s face softens and he straightens up, gets his feet under him to crawl over to where he’s seated. He props his elbow on the back of the couch and smiles at him, soft and very intimate. Harry wants to squirm with the flop his stomach makes.
“Yes, good,” and he carefully puts the letter on the night-stand, precariously standing on Harry’s key. He clears his throat and reaches once more into the package.
Harry frowns; he feels the familiar creases of his worry in his face and thinks back to Ginny telling him to stop, or else.
Malfoy knocks at his door when evening bleeds into night. Harry opens it in the same jeans and shirt he was wearing this morning. He feels underdressed in front of Malfoy’s gleaming worry about his appearance.
Draco sputters but doesn’t get a chance to answer, because Albus barges in and every thing else becomes secondary.
“Muggle London,” he finally answers, when he feels he’s going to implode with all that he’s keeping from her. She seems to get pointier by the word. He cannot tell her about Harry, but he should at least reassure her. “It’s alright, I’ve found people to… Help me.”
Malfoy bats him away, the shadows of his frown accented by the strobe lights. He leans toward Harry but stops himself and shakes his head, shrugs in a clear dismissal and walks off.
Luna perches herself on the arm of his seat, tilts his head back to look up his nose. Harry has learned that it’s best not to interrupt Luna when she’s looking for some grizzly creatures.
Harry knows they come here to see friends, but he cannot fight against the knot in his throat, lodged high enough that he feels it every time he swallows. He has never once come back since the War and the first time Draco shyly betrayed Voldemort. He has dreaded coming here with his kids and dissolving into acrid panic.
A great number of people need to mourn Harry; Draco knows that he doesn’t have a right for grief today. The dirty looks he receive only confirm that.
By the end of his shift, Draco is apoplectic with desire and cannot protest when Harry pulls him in the restroom for quick hand jobs. They get red and disheveled, but no one comments on it, and they’re bade a good evening by the fresh-faced waitress.
Ginny gets her wand out and gets to work. Her wandwork is exasperated, less careful that she is when treating James’s hurt and scratches, but Harry bears it without a flinch, taking it as the penance that it is. When she’s finished, they smile at each other.
He cannot shed it when he kisses Ginny. And he doesn’t either when she inevitably pinches her mouth at his lack of enthusiasm and leaves him alone in her bed, in the heavy night of summer.
Harry follows him back inside, eyes fixed on the glittery bounce of his head. His jaw hurts with the frustration he keeps there.
Harry pants, almost deaf to Draco’s moans. He doesn’t dare move yet; pleasure is a raw wild thing tightening in his gut and he shakes on it, feels only Draco in him and under him and his hands marking bruises on his skin.
He remembers the dark evening that led him to ‘Malfoy’s Private Investigation’, wan and tired from yet another full moon spent raging against the man who had done this to him. The bite was a deliberate attack on him—a clear-eyed wolf charging through the group of Aurors and knocking Harry down with sharp teeth at his shoulder and disappearing just as fast.
And so Draco tells him of the first drink in the ruins of the Hogwarts castle and the ceremonial lay of a weapon at his feet (honestly, Harry, the definition of weapon seems pretty loose here. Whatever could hurt and I have no idea when that could have been). They agree that the blood-sharing and hands bound together happened in muggle jail.
He’s about to jump out of bed and into the shower when he feels the sharp indent of Harry’s teeth on his skin, and the wet heat of his tongue soothing in their path.
“We both know that werewolf bites only have an effect on a full-moon. And you’ve done scarier things than being a werewolf.” At Harry’s silence, he adds softly, “I was talking about killing Voldemort, not…” he trails off. “Sorry.”
Harry feels himself tighten like a bow, rigid with tension. The conversation is getting out of hands and he doesn’t know how to steer them to clearer waters.
“No,” Harry amends in a rush of breath, “I know why I came to you, the first time around. I’m just not sure why I came back to you.”
They stay married. They love each other and James is a wonderful kid. Neither Harry nor Ginny wants to spend any less time with him. It takes them a while to talk about their future together, and the fact that they want more children. Eventually they do, and Albus comes into their life.
Harry tries not to stare at Malfoy. He cannot help but feel on his tongue the citrus scent of his soap, and the lavender cream he puts on his hand. It’s not just the raw smell of him  and it’s a relief to have a part of his scent obscured, hidden under cosmetics.
The children go to bed early and Draco stays in his office, nursing a digestive. The heat of summer is bearable, now that night covers the last warmth of the day. He has spelled his windows open and watches the play of the breeze on his curtains, admires the pattern of fluttering with great entertainment. Alcohol makes him stupidly endeared to such little things.
Draco tries to follow him, tries to overlook the heat already creeping in the room, but the day is going to be hot, and so he closes his eyes and suffers in silence, feels the breath of Harry even out against his Adam’s apple and begs the world for a cooling charm. He has shoved his wand in the pocket of the trousers he wore on the first day here and has not touched it since, but he longs for the relief of it.
“I would not have ruled it as an accident,” Harry says, mostly to distract himself. Malfoy smells familiar and it’s both strange and comforting. “The door was tempered with.”
Malfoy hesitates for a moment, then reaches out to take Harry’s glasses off, slow and uncertain. Harry blinks as the world becomes blurry; he has to look away to push back the emotion welling in his chest.
Harry sits on his couch and tries not to think. He had expected the knot of fury and indignation in his chest to disappear after his aggressor got arrested, but instead it just squirms on itself, pulling tightly at his heartstrings as he follows the proceedings of the trial in the Prophet.
They look at each other. Harry breathes shallowly, knowing that he will bend and take a lick of Malfoy’s throat, right over his Adam’s apple, if he gets any closer.
The ministry announces three days of national mourning on the wireless. Scorpius curls against Draco’s side and sighs, too tired to cry any more.
Draco hums and goes to the window to gives himself something to do. He taps the panes with a distracted fingers, blind to the view outside and acutely aware of Potter in the same room.
He tells himself that’s why he keeps silent about his finger. It’s too late, he thinks, he doesn't want his friends to feel betrayed because he didn’t talk about it earlier. There is a black dot on his left ring finger; it’s been here since the end of the war. Harry rubs at it, waits to see it smudge. It doesn’t.
Malfoy pushes him inside and slams the door behind them. There’s a moment, when they simply look at each other, a silence while the storm is brewing, close enough to share warmth. Harry touches Malfoy’s elbow, tries to be gentle about it and not as brusque and desperate as he feels. Malfoy smiles at him, strained and wanting, and Harry cannot wait anymore.
“Wandlessly? You flirt.” Harry laughs and kisses him again for good measure. It’s not a very good kiss, too sharp because they cannot stop smiling.
The waiter seems to grit his teeth, square jaw tightening with the energy to stay unmoveable. Draco does not understand the trepidation.
“It’s alright, it’s alright,” Harry pets his hair, pushes it away from his face. “We don’t have to ever come back. Regular Britain is maybe not magic, but it’s alright. It’s alright. We can make it work.”
“I’m not excluding it, but that always seemed a bit weird to me. From what I saw of his room, he knew how to use it. He had experience with such dark artifacts. It’s not hard to get out of one, they’re not meant to trap you.”
Draco listens and feels drunk on sensations and noises, feels the muscles of his back strain with the movement, and his thighs burn with his enthusiasm. Harry’s eyes are so very green, so very dark under Draco, and he grips the soft brown skin, feels the tissue resist and push back against his hands, feels the movements of the body under him and cannot keep himself from cresting any more. He spills between them and loses his bearing for a moment. He feels, rather than hears, Harry moan against his cheeks. Harry grabs at Draco’s hips to press him closer, to push himself over the edge with that last bit of friction. He does, stumbles upon it between one gasp and another; Harry seems to flicker with the intensity of his orgasm.
Ron sighs. “Alright. I thought I had stopped doing unnecessary paperwork for you, but it looks like I was wrong.”
The Manor greets them with warm candlelights and Draco makes his way back to the library, a great shadow pushing at the back of his knees and almost making him trip. He plops himself back in his chair with a book and Potter immediately sees the opportunity to worm his head into his lap.
The sun is slanting orange beams over his furniture, lighting his bookshelves in warm colours and the gardens are green and lush in the summer heat, fragrant blossoms spreading to the skies. A too beautiful day to die.
“Alright then, Potter, let’s try to break the Albus-Scorpius coalition,” says Malfoy, tucking his hand at Harry’s elbow.
Malfoy laughs; it spreads damp and hot on the crease of his thigh. Harry shudders. He bites the back of his hand to muffle the groan which wants to spill out.
“I never did thank you for the motion. I shouldn’t really. You only did your job as a Wizengamot seat holder.”
“I think the Wizarding World at large would excuse Harry for missing out on a few funerals. Nobody is paying attention to who is going to those any more. Especially with the (Death Eaters’) trials starting. He could take a break and have a bit of a lie-in,” a witch who wishes to remain anonymous adds.
Harry laughs, feels it spread warm and humid on Draco’s skin. He drops a kiss there and the skin shivers under his lips.
Draco marks bruises on his skin when he comes; he tightens all over and rasps a breath that is more airless awe than exhalation. Harry collapses on him, finding a rest on his chest and feeling the great heave of his ribs move under him. He’s still burning all over, feeling every response of Draco’s body to his own against his skin. He’s raw and hypersensitive. Every twitch of Draco’s fingers make him shudder with need.
Malfoy is smoking,and it reminds him to fill his lungs with smoke. He exhales choppily, tasting fire and ethanol on his breath.
Draco struggles to a sitting position, shirt tacky with sweat and feeling like his couch is swallowing him in its folds of leather. There are ants and needles in his left leg and he stumbles to the windows, pulls them open with relief. The breeze caresses his skin with the promise of cool reprieve.
He strides outside of his office and down the stairs; Draco follows without great conviction. They get outside, sky dark and close, heavy with clouds and Potter doesn’t pause, continues on his way, almost running.
Draco reads about it over his evening brandy, in an exclusive afternoon edition of the Prophet. When he gets to the end of the article, he pours himself a second one.
“What are you doing?” he asks, horrified and vigilant, already looking over his shoulder to see if someone has seen it.
Harry picks himself up and doesn’t answer, squirming to not give Malfoy an eyeful. Malfoy doesn’t seem concerned by matter and placidly watch Harry stumble to a standing position and fly from the room.
“You can tip him back in his box now,” Draco says slowly. Harry looks ashen and shell-shocked, and Draco’s not quite sure how to respond. He knows that his own reaction is flight, not fight. He’s not sure how to reassure Harry and doesn’t think that sex is going to cut it this time.
Draco doesn’t ask Harry if he’s alright; because he obviously isn’t, but he gets closer and nudges his leg with his bare toes. Just an indication that he’ss here, that he’s not leaving.
“Are you only waking up now?” he asks when he finally sees Harry. “Well, way to let go of yourself, Potter.”
“Yes, of course I am. Now, stop feeling sorry about yourself and tell me about James.It always cheers you up.”
In the sweet shadows of his house, Harry tugs a robe over his shivering shoulders and collapses on his couch, pushing his toes between two cushions in an effort to warm them up.
He has trouble identifying what it is. Banshees usually prefer to present themselves shrouded in black. Draco gets the impression of an humanoid shaped under a white sheet, a statue covered from prying eyes. It raises goosebumps along his arms.
Harry feels dizzy with wine, food and proximity. He watches Malfoy and tries not to let himself be swayed by his gravity, pulled in like an asteroid. Malfoy looks back at him evenly, eyes a darker grey than usual, pupils fat and expressive.
Draco slides between the cool sheets and sighs in relief at the bone-deep relaxation that settles over him. He turns on his side to look at Potter and repeats slowly, “No bed.” Potter seems agreeable enough to the idea and lets himself fall on his side, stretched in his entire length on the carpet.
“Obviously. We’re going to bed immediately,” he says and pushes past her with two other boys in tow, stockier and broad-shouldered. The three of them look back at Harry curiously
The conversation is cut short by Albus and Scorpius barreling in the breakfast room, animated by a very loud debate. Albus obviously ropes his father in it and Draco goes back to his newspaper, distractedly listening to the rest of them.
“I may not be young as you are but I’m still a witch in my prime! And Draco will be delighted to assist me.”
Harry wants to greet him with a kiss, but stops himself, as he did for the last few months; their relationship is not one of the kind. Instead, he buries his face in Lily’s hair, with her askew beanie hiding the flame of it and breathes her in. She smells of baby powder and the olive-scented soap they use at home; it settles him before he lets her down to wobble to Astoria.
,” he repeats, grinning and looking scrumptious, relaxed on the bed, pants riding low. “So terribly posh.”
Minerva —Professor McGonagall— is a tall and pinched woman who leads Harry through darkened corridors and steep stairs.
“You know exactly what I’m talking about.” Harry says, feeling stubborn and small. “If you asked for it, Dumbledore would help you.”
“You looked…” Harry picks at a loose thread on his jeans without looking away from him. “Never mind.”
Mr Bruegel raises his wand. Harry is prepared for it, sees the spell flash toward him and bounce against his wandless Protego.
Draco goes for his wand but the man is already pushed away from them, pulled away by someone else. There is dread inching up Draco’s spine, freezing him in place.
Mr Bruegel finally flinches. His fingers spasm at his sides and he crosses them in front of him, sets his jaw in a hard line. The aggressiveness is a rigid tension in the space between them.
"It's good to see you," Sirius admitted. "Will you return to your own apartments at once or will you visit with me a while?"
The boy Bertram made a hissing sound from between his teeth; Malfoy quelled him with a raised eyebrow and turned back to Harry. There was a speculative silence.
All of that in the caldron and poured over the body on the slab. The elixir of life flowing through the body, to render it immortal. The invisibility cloak pillowing its head, symbolising that there was no longer any need to hide from death.
Welcome to Book 3, where things kick up a notch. Coming up we have more filthy sex acts, unsafe in more ways than one. Bear in mind that as the summary says, "Sodomy is a hanging offence": the 1850s were not a good time to be homosexual and this isn't a fluffy AU where real world laws or attitudes are ignored. Triggers for homophobia and violence in every chapter.
"I agree, the names are too similar," he said. He looked at his daughter again, all squashed and misshapen and so very dear already. Harry looked at Ginny and looked at his baby girl and thought,
Something nasty flashed across Filch’s face but he returned to his chorus of “sirs” at once as the boys filed in.
Ginny had gripped his fingers as tightly as she could. "This was not your fault," she'd said. She'd said other things, about how she just needed rest and quiet but all Harry had heard was her absolving him when she had no idea of how callous he had been, how selfish. He could see now that he had been distancing himself from the idea of her – and now he had abruptly been reminded that she was real.
Harry bit his lip, and began an abridged version of events in Strathpeffer – the beauty of the Highlands, his growing discomfort, and his words to Ginny. He did not mention Draco once, saying only that he had been seeking peace and respite.
Lucius kept his face straight though Harry could feel a smirk emanating from him. “Minister, in light of this witness’s refusal to answer questions, I ask that he be recalled under
Ginny seemed surprised by the question. "Not for long. He tried to charm me but it was so obviously insincere that I wonder he went to the trouble."
Harry shifted, uncomfortable at the way Sirius made his love for Ginny sound. It was not a convenience, never had been. In fact it had been quite the opposite at times. Harry opened his mouth to object when he looked for the first time to the box directly opposite theirs and saw Lord Draco Malfoy.
"I would have wished to be an Auror," Harry said, carding his fingers through Draco's hair. "If I had the choice of any profession."
"Of course," Draco spat. "Of course, take a fortnight to visit your wife and your red-headed in-laws rather than taking the time to even try to make yourself known to my social circle."
"Are you still afraid?" Draco demanded, a hint of anger entering his tone. "I told you, you're mine, I marked you. Do you want me to be yours? Fuck me."
Draco said nothing at first. Then he laughed, hollow and hurt. “I knew you’d eventually leave me. I knew you wouldn’t love me enough.”
"I do not know," he forced himself to say as he began to sob. Sirius' arms came around him, and he clung to his godfather, wishing himself far away, into the life of a man who had never been subject to desire or the monstrous whims of his own heart.
Concentrate, Draco. “More something I want to talk about,” he said, choosing his words carefully.  “You know how the world gossips.”
Draco looked at Harry with dark, dark eyes, and stood. His own erection bobbed in front of Harry's face and Harry looked up to see the question, the dare in Draco's eyes.
"Lady Potter, it is so nice to have an evening out, is it not?" Narcissa Malfoy was saying. She was always more outwardly polite than her husband but there tended to be a sting. "When the children are small I know some mothers find it hard to leave them at home, unfashionable though it may be to admit it."
"Harry," Draco called, more concerned with reaching him than the fact that his hand still bled where he had cut off his finger, more concerned with knowing he was alive than anything else in the world.
Hermione eyed Harry askance. "Ron, would you mind fetching my bag? I believe I left it in the other room."
"You are so naïve, Potter," Malfoy sneered. "He looks at you all wide-eyes and smooth body and plays on your desperate need to feel young. You cannot even remember who you were before you married your wife, can you?"
," Draco whined, and Harry could only obey, drawing his fingers out of Draco's body to guide his cock inside in their place.
The door opened, and Draco and Harry stepped into an antechamber. The burly man behind the door promptly closed it behind them.
"Good. Now for Merlin's sake, let us put an end to this. If you embarrass the family tonight it will be in front of the entire wizarding world, Draco, and that will be the end of you. Is that understood?"
"Harry's single and you want to move in on him," Terry said in an accusing whisper. "Well, let me tell you, you don't have a chance with him. Our love is real and once he realises it, there'll be a cottage in Devon, two black Labradors and a rose garden!"
No. He slammed down the thought at once. Teddy was his godson, the son of a man he respected beyond words and Harry would never even consider betraying his trust in such a way.
"If you mean the kind of viewpoint you espouse in committee, then I would think you would already know the answer to that," Harry said as calmly as he could. "Besides, what was it you said? Something about one drop of Muggle blood?"
Harry wanted to step away but then Malfoy said, "Why shouldn't I? You choke down your very nature for her sake one minute and you want to seduce a boy in your care the next…"
"I have never spent so much time in Muggle London before," Draco remarked when they took a picnic by the Italian fountains in Kensington Gardens. They were hidden from view by charms so that their conversation would not be interrupted, and lay down on the grass, lazy in the sun.
“Come now, Draco. I understand it must be galling for you to have a seductee refuse you at last, but it happens to the best of us.”
"Perhaps you should be. I have come to care where I did not care before and that amplifies the pain as well as the pleasure."
Harry looked around all the faces in the room. “I have made mistakes. I am not perfect. I never was. But on the day you all needed me most, I walked out to meet Voldemort and die knowing exactly what my fate would be. Then I came back, to finish what had to be done. I have done my duty all my life.
Hermione did not press the issue, instead saying simply, "Perhaps that is a failing which we need to redress. We miss and love you, Harry. We all want you to come back to us."
“That is what you learned?” Harry asked, his own heart breaking a little. “That love was not worth it?”
He was not going to deny it then. Harry took a long breath to steady himself. “I could use some of that,” he said, indicating the decanter.
Draco shrugged. "The world is the way it is. Pureblood numbers dwindle, the number of half-bloods increases and the mudbloods shall inherit the wizarding world after they have bled all the old ways out of it."
Harry looked away from them and up to the public gallery. It was half-empty now but some familiar faces had stayed. Bill and Fleur waved to him sadly. Luna blew him a kiss. Neville did nothing but stand there, quiet and strong. And Ron had come now. His heartbreak was large on his face and Harry could only look back and shrug, almost helplessly. This is where all his defiance had brought him.
Half past four, and Draco was feeling no pain. Three out of three competitors diverted, giving him a clear shot at getting into Potter’s pants.
"Yes, of course he did, Potter," Draco sighed. "He follows the old ways more strictly than you realise - but he cut deals and saved our family's reputation. And I - well, I was shipped off to Beauxbatons to complete my education. And quite the education it was, too," he concluded with a smile. "Would you like to hear about it?"
.” Harry slammed his fist against the desk, rising to his feet as he did so. Sparks crackled from his fingers and all at once the courtroom was silent as it seemed to occur to everyone at last who he was and what he could do.
Because Harry knew now how he felt. If Lucius was going to win anyway  then maybe, just maybe Harry could have what he wanted.
Harry did not leave Grimmauld Place at all for the first week. He spent his time with his boys or with Ginny, unable to do much except watch them, terrified that if he wasn't there one of them would die. He
Harry reached out and took her hand, stroking his thumb over her knuckles. Usually that would be enough to calm Ginny at least a little but this time her spine stayed defiantly stiff.
Diggory sighed deeply. “I am inclined to agree, Mrs Weasley. Lucius, this story is all rather fantastic and there has been no evidence of any kind put forward beyond contradictory testimony. From the list you submitted, I know you have no other witnesses to call. The evidence is simply not strong enough.”
"This will not do at all, Muffy. Here I am entering a public place and I find a hole in my shawl. Now I want you to fetch me another shawl, in the same hue. While I am out I expect you to mend this, and any other damage done to any item in my wardrobe. And when you are done, report to the Head Elf at the Manor for punishment."
He resolved to do more even as his eyes flickered to the carriage clock behind Snem's desk, counting down the hours until seven o'clock.
Slowly he withdrew his finger and sat up, only to have Draco reach for his shoulder, pulling him on top of Draco's body.
Teddy beamed. "She is still very young but I believe that there may be an understanding growing between us."
“I’ll tell her as soon as you’re formally charged,” Hermione promised. “I can pass on any message you want.”
Draco shrugged out of his smoking jacket and let his shirt slip off his shoulder. “You could start by coming here.” Harry turned to look at him more fully only to see Draco shrugging out of his shirt and collapsing languidly to the bed.
He emerged from the Pensive heartsick and raging. He rounded on the real Blaise at once, reaching for his wand – but Blaise, ever-cool, had anticipated this and raised his own to Harry’s throat. However, Blaise didn’t see the fist coming; wizards often had that weakness, never anticipating actual physical violence.
The foyer was not, however, unoccupied. Harry was up considerably earlier than usual that morning and had managed to time his departure with that of a tall, slender blonde woman giving orders to a house-elf.
"Would you have chosen to love me?" Harry asked, holding his breath slightly. Draco had never actually said the words.
"But that's not why you did it," Harry said, knowing Draco so well, knowing that all Draco had ever wanted was Harry all to himself.
"Indeed not," Draco acknowledged, though he continued fidgeting. Harry reached out and caught his hands to soothe him, but touching Draco always seemed to lead to more touch, more intensity. Always more.
"The Wizengamot will return to session after the Season is over," Sirius had told him. "I must take my seat - perhaps you should come and observe? And of course there is the matter of the property in Hogsmeade and how it should be administered – I know it's tedious, Harry, but it must be done. Just learn about it once and then turn it over to a manager as I did!" Sirius had patted his shoulder and grimaced in an odd kind of resigned contentment, but Harry could not imagine living life as Sirius did, always rattling around in Grimmauld Place with only the occasional visit to a friend breaking the tedium of routine. No wonder Sirius was always desperate for a visit from himself or Remus.
Harry gave a half-laugh. "Oh, it is nothing of consequence. Just that… Well, in town I was desperate for the quiet of home and now I find myself wishing again for the bustle of town."
Hermione stood, confused. “Yes sir, I submitted the witness list before trial commenced as you requested.”
"You are quite right," Malfoy went on as though they had been conversing. "Do you think perhaps we might find other amusement?"
"There is no need to worry," Draco said, face white. He sat down abruptly as though the strength had suddenly left his body.
He need not have worried. Opening the wardrobe for fresh clothes set off an alarm of some kind and Draco appeared a second later, all wild eyes and rumpled clothes.
Hermione sent him an owl the next day with a list of ingredients and a stern instruction to bring them as early in the morning as he could. Harry took a moment to imagine darting around Diagon Alley like a criminal, fearful of whom he might see around every corner and asked Dobby to go for him instead.
“Wanted to make sure it got here without interference,” Goyle replied. “He knows I do what he tells me.”
Harry had rather forgotten himself, but when he looked towards Ron’s feet he saw a familiar, hulking black shape. “Padfoot?”
Harry stood at once as a good husband should. “Boys, I’m going to see your mother -why don’t you play with your cousins and I’ll join you soon.” The two scampered off while Harry crossed the room to take his wife’s hand hand, drop a kiss on her knuckles. "Ginny," he said simply.
In two strides, Harry was across the room with his hands on Malfoy pulling him upright, pulling him bodily into a kiss. Harry's hands found their way down Malfoy's body, curving into the small of his back with a thumb tracing the line of his spine, the other hand resting on the curve of his buttocks. Harry groaned and pulled Malfoy harder against him.
Draco looked at him with scorn. "Curtail my freedom? For what! I can barely even get it up for a woman so what would I do with a wife?"
Hermione frowned a moment before her expression cleared. "Oh! A love potion? And you a married man, Harry! What kind of woman would do such a thing?"
"You should take a holiday!" Molly exclaimed as though she had just thought of it; Harry rather suspected that this had been her agenda in coming. He again strained to meet Ginny's eye but she was frowning.
Not fooled for a minute, Pansy ignored him and went on. “Yes, they split. Huge fight three days ago, both of them keeping it quiet until their publicists can agree on a story.”
"Do not apologise to me," she said at once. "I cannot bear it. I cannot bear—" her voice wavered and she was silent for a moment, her head falling forward to enable her to stare at her gloved fingers until she regained control; Harry watched her trying not to cry and nearly wept himself.
Harry didn't know where to look. He couldn't pull his eyes away from Draco – he kept drinking in the sight of him, his throat, chest, thighs. Harry was so
Harry let himself close his eyes and imagine it for a moment: a villa by the water. His children nearby. “I wonder how long it would take me to learn Italian.”
"Master Sirius is having company," Kreacher said, pushing the door wider. "Is the same company as always. My mistress, my poor mistress, it would break her heart it would, it would."
One night after everyone had gone to bed, Sirius found Harry sitting against the door to Ginny's room, tired and drawn.
Draco was so broken though. All his fire was out. Harry knew that feeling, knew it well. He sometimes felt as though the war had drained the very best parts of him away leaving only a shell who still felt sporadic violent impulses, tightly controlled, and an urge to do good but whose spirit had never really recovered.
Harry always loved to hear such titbits about his parents, but he wished Sirius would not always sound so disappointed when Harry did not perfectly mirror James.
Draco took a chance on the latter. He could hardly turn up uninvited at the Weasley family home after all, but if Charlie was taking some of the kids to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes then Draco would have every reason to be wandering along Diagon Alley and just ‘happen’ to ‘bump into’ him.
"Dumbledore told me– it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live." Harry's voice was gentle now. "When did you last speak to your mother?"
“Solidify any friendships you have in development,” Sirius said at once. “Reconnect with your Hogwarts classmates. Accept some more of those speaking engagements I know you abhor – remind everyone of your past heroics and it will be much more difficult for Lucius to undermine you.”
Malfoy shook his head, his smirk never fading though Harry would have sworn there was a spark of anger in his steel-grey eyes. "Go back to bed, Potter," he said as he walked past Harry and to his own disappointment, Harry let him go.
“Mmph,” came out before Draco’s brain caught up and he started to kiss back. Potter’s hand clasped the back of his neck while his other hand rested on Draco’s clavicle. The hard planes of his body, lithe and muscled, pressed against Draco from groin to chest and Draco sat back on the desk so he could wrap his legs around Potter’s body and pull him closer.
Draco came on an all-but-silent gasp and after a moment's recovery he stood up, smiling his half-smile half-sneer inches from Harry's face. "Harry," he replied, and then they were kissing. Harry could taste himself salty on Draco's tongue and he would have expected to be revolted but instead he felt a fresh bolt of lust.
Harry's eyes narrowed at the thought of all the men Draco must have done this to, to be able to lie there so casually and say something like that. He redoubled his efforts at once, sliding his finger further into Draco's body and when the response came again it was not, this time, so unexpected. Harry kept his head back just a little so that his mouth was never more full than he could bear. Draco's hips jerked back onto his finger, forward into his mouth. Draco's breath was hot on his lower body but he could not seem to catch his breath long enough to resume his ministrations; Harry had made him come undone and all at once his mouth was flooded.
“I would like to be able to live with Remus,” Sirius said. “Teddy is grown up now. The villa is big enough for all of us. It sits by the lakeside, with a view across the clearest water you’ve ever seen. On a clear day you can see all the way to the Dolomites on the northern shore. It is temperate and charming. It would be a nice place for the children, Harry.”
Some emotion flashed in Malfoy's eyes too quickly for Harry to identify it. For a moment it seemed as though Malfoy would say something else but Harry was not stupid enough to wait for the madness to overcome him again; he pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way and yanked open the door, storming out and almost straight into Ron and Hermione.
Kreacher scowled. "Yes Master," he said before turning to mutter to himself all the way out of the room.
Draco looked towards the bedroom door and turned his body toward it, smirking back at Harry over his shoulder. As he walked to the door he slid his waistcoat and shirt from his shoulders, revealing the rippling muscles of his back as the clothes dropped to the floor. Then he was through the doorway and out of Harry's sight, though the sound of rustling fabrics still reached Harry's ears.
“One drop of Muggle blood may not make a Muggle, but multiple acts of perversion do make one pervert would you not agree?"
Blaise raised his hands in a placating gesture. “I mean only that I happen to know he is at the Manor. If I know Lord Malfoy – and rather unfortunately, I have come to know him rather well — Draco will be there for some time and therefore we have an opportunity to speak. Candidly.”
Harry had been present for James’s first steps and Al’s first words. He had missed so much time with his daughter already – he could only hope he would be granted the time to make it up.
When Harry came back to himself, he was lying on his side, his face buried in Draco's neck. Their legs were tangled together, their ejaculate cooling and sticking uncomfortably to Harry's skin. But he would not move for worlds, not as long as Draco was holding him, pressing gentle touches to the nape of his neck, the curve of his ear, the knobs of his spine. He wondered when he had removed his glasses. It didn't seem important.
“I am sure I can find a way to amuse myself,” he replied airily. It did not fool Harry, though, who could see the way Draco was twisting the sheets in his fingers.
Lord Malfoy's tirade ended abruptly as Harry, unable to bear another moment, pulled out his wand and cast the silencing spell. None of the Malfoys had noticed him do it, too absorbed in the battle of wills between father and son.
Harry shoved down the thought at once; Lord Malfoy could not possibly know what had passed between his son and Harry.
He had been given his first opportunity to bathe in several days, and brought fresh clothes by Dobby, who sobbed as he tried to help Harry dress. It had not been the most fortifying of starts to the day.
"But of course I will be Lord Black one day," Harry said with a rueful smile. "Any such career would be beneath the dignity of such a noble house."
Zabini's eyes widened in mock-innocence. "We are merely asking Potter whether he agrees that one should be expected to accept responsibility for all the consequences of one's actions, whether intended or not, whether anticipated or unexpected?"
"Does not always make a Muggle," Lucius said smoothly. "Somewhat to my own regret. But in a sense we have no one to blame for the rise of the half-bloods but ourselves, or at the very least their ancestors. If they would insist on mating with Muggles, what should we have expected but bastard half-base children who would do nothing but pollute our world."
Draco shied away from the topic at once. "It does not signify. Keeping up appearances is the condition of survival in this world, at this time. So I go to lunch with ladies and then I have beautiful boys suck my lobcock. And someday I will throw the lie they make me live in all their teeth."
This, Harry had dreaded, more so even than seeing Ginny again. He knew he should not feel such a way about his wife but he felt certain that he could survive the loss of her much more easily than the loss of Ron or Hermione.
“Ron,” Harry said again, nonsensically. Here he was, his best friend, solid as rock since they were eleven years old. “Ron, Listen. I need to tell you—"
"Not a doubt in my mind," Sirius said gently, before resuming his briskness. "I must prepare for the Muggle relations committee. We're due to begin at half past eleven, though to be frank it will more likely be after luncheon."
Harry looked at him, incredulous. Draco was forever berating him for his bourgeois taste in everything from furnishings to robes.
Which is why when Draco Malfoy returned to his suite that evening, Harry was waiting for him in the hotel corridor.
On the front in elegant script was merely his name, Lord Lucius Malfoy.  On the reverse, a note.  Harry had to read it twice to be certain, but there it was in front of him.  His lover's father had written for all the world to see, <i>For Harry Potter, sodomite.</i>
“And yet, sir, I am quite sure that I could obtain a higher price by placing the letter up for bids. But I didn’t do that – I came straight to you. On account of your reputation as a man of fairness.”
"Ah? So did Mother." Malfoy's eyes flickered between Harry's eyes and his mouth. His face relaxed. "Do I assume you're here to ask me not to speak of your interest in the windward passage?"
"I quite understand. Sirius does not think of these things," she said with a reprimanding look at the man in question.
"Remus? He is a school master now!" Sirius said, shaking his head in disbelief. "Gone back to Hogwarts of all places!"
Draco tilted his head to consider. "Now should I get some for you, or should I watch you suffer? It's difficult to know which will amuse me more, your gratitude or your misery."
That Strathpeffer was beautiful, Harry could not deny. The large hotels in the modern style were at odds with the sweeping hills and gnarled old trees surrounding the town. It was quite the resort, with the pump room and numerous Healers available to suggest the best relaxation techniques. Molly was as good as her word; she took over the care of the children so that the nanny was able to go home to her family for a few weeks, leaving Ginny free to divide her time between them and the sulphuric waters which everyone kept insisting held great restorative properties.
Harry blushed and ducked his head down, but Draco would not permit him to withhold an answer. "Only you," he said at last, and it was worth the embarrassment for Draco's smile.
Draco snorted. "Sirius Black would have you believe that he flouts convention but in truth he is just as conservative as all the other lords."
Draco looked back into Harry’s eyes and said miserably, “We do know. The only thing we don’t yet is how far it will go.”
Ginny sighed and thought for a moment. Then, "Can we go to the Quidditch match at Holyhead? I think the Harpies are playing the Prides, if I remember my fixtures."
"I always defer to your opinions in such matters," Harry said, causing Ron and Hermione both to laugh. He smiled back, glad that they were there, then began urging them into the house. Ron grinned at Dobby, who grinned back. Most people walked right past their house elves but Dobby had always been different. The other house-elf, Kreacher, tended to skulk around muttering to himself all the time.
"They are nothing but trouble," Harry said, holding Ginny tightly. "And tomorrow we will be rid of them."
"The first time, yes, as the act of love is for a woman. But would you say then that a woman must always regret having given herself to her lover?"
“Potter. I will forgive your state of battle-readiness if you forgive the early hour and the unannounced arrival,” he said as he breezed past Harry and into the rooms.
Dobby returned in short order with everything he needed and assured Harry that he had been very discreet; Harry hoped for the best and thanked him profusely.
"Well, of course I was in Slytherin house," Lord Draco said. "We did not often fraternise with the other houses."
That gold, that distinctive glowing gold, could have been nothing but Malfoy's robes, and even as Harry chastised himself, he was turning to look again.
"That is not true!" Harry shouted, forcing down the shame at the part of him that indeed wanted just that. "I am trying to take care of my family and you keep trying to get in the way of that, keep trying to confuse and push me and you…"
"Indeed," Harry conceded. The argument between he and Draco had not been resolved so much as it had been pushed to one side and neglected, but still it weighed on Harry's mind, casting a shadow over their days and nights together.
"Precisely," Draco gleamed. He had chosen gold for this evening's robes and it looked very well against the orange and black carpets. He threw himself down as if on a chaise longue and Harry laughed at him.
Harry ran his hand over the back of his neck. "I have made no arrangements but I hope to stay here for some time. I had hoped…"
Harry glanced over to the Malfoys a few times more. He had known Sirius all his life; the man had virtually no contact with any of his family. Harry had met his cousin Andromeda and her husband on several occasions as a young boy but AFTER Ted’s death, his attention had all been for little Teddy. It seemed incredible now to think that there was a great swathe of Sirius' family of whom he knew next to nothing.
Harry looked at Aberforth in astonishment. "I cannot imagine why you would say such a thing." His mind raced. What had Teddy said? Why was Aberforth saying this to him now?
Without meaning to, Harry had begun to thrust against Malfoy's thigh still lodged between his own. The friction was divine and Harry actually pulled away from the kiss to gasp.
“The Department of Mysteries has already been tasked with the latter, so I must assume the learned gentleman is rather preoccupied with the former,” Ernie added.
it was irrational, but he could not stop himself. It was as though the melancholy which afflicted him had been amplified by his failure in this until there was only fear and self-hatred and a gnawing certainty of disaster.
Draco was still spiky and sulking and it only got worse as Harry accepted invitations from Luna Scamander and Seamus Finnegan and all the acquaintances he had been disregarding in his single-minded pursuit of Draco.
Harry had sighed and walked slowly after him, ready to reprimand him further. But then there was a splash and Teddy stood up in the water.
“I would certainly not wish you to bear such costs on my account,” Harry said, angry with himself, with Kirke, with everything and everyone.
Confused and shaking, Harry stood a moment, taking long deep breaths to collect himself. He wondered if Malfoy would look out after him and forced himself to walk away. Whatever that had been, Harry was in no rush to repeat it.
“That’s quite enough, Mr Kirke,” Diggory snapped across the room. “Unless you have more questions Mrs Weasley – no? — Mr Kirke, you are excused.”
Harry tried to dismiss the image from his mind as he roused himself. His bed was empty, his wife sleeping in the confinement bed already, and he neither missed her nor found himself enjoying the space. His stomach felt unsettled, as though some gnawing fear plagued him. He kept thinking of the dream and of Sirius's words:
A small hurt sound from the other end of the parlour had Sirius whirling to shout, "Not even Regulus, Kreacher!"
Malfoy managed to get Harry's cravat untied and open the front of his shirt. The touch of Malfoy's fingers on Harry's bare skin was indescribable, sending white-hot chills through Harry's body. Harry moaned and held on tighter to Malfoy's silk strands of hair.
Sirius frowned. "I do not know if it is something which can come from reason, Harry. Either one sees others as people with value, or one does not. In this regard I fear you are far better than I. I disregarded the feelings of my servants in my younger years and it took you to show me that I should treat house-elves just the same as I should treat a wizard or a goblin or a Muggle." Sirius' lip curled. "They can damage or elevate us just as well as our friends or families.
Harry had taken more Draught of Peace in the last month than was likely healthy, not to mention his recent addition of Dreamless Sleep but he nodded at once: after all, if this potion could end this obsession it would be well worth the flare of melancholy which might arise in consequence. "I have been taking nothing recently," he said simply. "Just tell me what ingredients you need and I will obtain them.
"The length of our stay is not yet determined," Harry said, his mind whirling. Malfoy was here? All the more reason to leave at once for home. But Harry was tired of making nothing but sensible decisions, tired of doing his duty, doing what was expected of him.
He'd had such hopes for their marriage. He'd loved that Ginny seemed to understand him instinctively. He'd appreciated the tomboy in her even as so many of her peers turned into proper 'ladies', who tended to bore Harry to tears. He'd married for love and never imagined lying next to her at night feeling lonely.
Harry knew instinctively that if he were to follow where Malfoy would lead, his life would never be the same. It would be far, far safer to decline politely, return home, kiss his wife's forehead and know himself forever as a man who had denied what he wanted not from any righteousness, but because he was a coward.
Harry would once have apologised. Now he tightened his grip on the back of Draco's neck, licked his shoulder blade. "You are mine, Draco," he said simply, "And I took you."
The thing which had disturbed Harry for so long came to his mind now. "Do you not worry that it is unnatural?"
"Hopeless, Potter!" he snarled as he twisted to resolve the problem. Draco's cock was right in front of Harry then for just a moment as Draco turned, close and mouth-watering. Harry had known that he wanted to touch Draco, that he wanted Draco to use his mouth on him again. He had not expected that he would be so eager to do the same, that the idea would fill him with lust and make his tongue eager to know the flavour. And now with Draco's back to him, he could look all he liked at the beautiful curve of his spine, the lovely supple backside, the strong thighs. He could only look for a moment, though, before his boots and the remnants of his clothing were removed at last and Draco was back on top of him. Their skin was touching from the tops of feet to the press of forehead against forehead before they kissed again, again, again.
How's everyone doing this Monday? Me, I'm still super embarrassed about messing up the posting order. Welcome new readers and anyone sticking with me through the oops.
At once Dobby disappeared and a moment later, Sirius appeared, half-dressed with his smoking jacket thrown over his nightclothes.
“Well, yes, but given the memory we were shown, I would think Draco Malfoy should be required to testify.”
“Steady on, Potter,” muttered Ernie Macmillan, one of Harry’s few supporters on the committee. “One objection at a time.”
"How could I miss the memorial?" Remus said. He was dressed in his habitually shabby robes, his money all going on things for Teddy despite Sirius' best efforts at looking after them both. His face looked thin and tired as always though his eyes were warm, and when Harry shook his hand, it was with real affection. "Your speech went well, I thought," Remus said. Harry grimaced. "Yes, I know you hate having to give them," Remus commiserated, "but you came across very well. I thought you should know."
When Draco had taken his leave, Harry debated with himself for a while before deciding that the easiest thing to do would be to Apparate to Grimmauld Place. The sound did tend to draw attention, so Harry cast a muffling charm before he spun around.
Draco licked his lips. His fingers uncurled and stroked the side of Harry's face. "We have the full night. I believe that was what you wanted."
Crabbe frowned as though that was not the response he had expected. "I will not tell Lord Malfoy that you are a common eavesdropper as it would serve only to embarrass him. You are too old to require correction like a child; show some self-discipline."
"I thought you believed we were the better," Harry said, and Draco's eyes narrowed. "You cannot truly think that change would be the end of things?" Harry shook his head in disbelief.
At seven, Harry was dressed and waiting. Draco only kept him waiting ten minutes this time, and then the two were off to dine at a private establishment, Spelling's, where Nott knew the proprietor.
Harry stared after him, the long white hair and the warm black cloak moving down the corridor at a disconcertingly normal walking pace.
When the bell rang, Harry’s heart lurched – was it the Aurors, already? Diggory had told him it would take a few days to look into the charges.
Sirius appeared right behind him, and, having also divested himself of his outer garments, they followed the butler to be announced, waiting at the entrance to a room almost the size of Harry's entire home at Godric's Hollow, with an enormous fireplace at one end, elaborate chandeliers sending rainbows of light down to the marble floors… Harry barely knew where to look at the display of such opulence.
Harry placed his knife and fork neatly back down and touched his cloth napkin to the corners of his mouth. "Thank you, Kreacher," he said without looking around. "That's all for this evening."
"In any case," Sirius went on, "we should be going. Arrival times are precisely worked out, you know. You remember the Floo address?"
Draco’s memory provided him with a helpful tableau of a Bat-Bogey Hex and he shuddered. “Indeed. Well, none of my business, I know, but…”
Harry sat for what felt like hours in that sterile cell. There were bars and wards everywhere, and everything was painted grey. Harry tried not to think of Sirius in Azkaban or his experiences with Dementors in the past. He instead thought of a shining silver stag and wondered what memory could bring such a creature to him now.
"Of course," Draco said. "But Black is a bachelor. Did he then offer much insight into the subject?"
"Then you should join us for cards tomorrow night," Zabini said. His teeth caught the light as he smiled. There was something of amusement in his expression but Harry did not have enough time to dwell on it as on turning back to face Zabini, his eye lit on the window into the hotel's reading room.
The first meeting of Committee for Muggle Relations took place a mere two days later. Harry had tried to put his encounter with Lucius from his mind, along with that plaintive warning from Draco, but had found it exceedingly difficult.
Harry pushed himself up and looked into Draco's face. He raised his body to let Draco shift the angle. Draco's cock was only half-hard but still beautiful and Harry rubbed his hand over it, feeling it begin to stir.
Draco shifted. "I had a charm. So that I would know when you came back. If you came. I was by no means certain that you would." Draco looked as uncertain as Harry had ever seen him. His robes were winter white and his waistcoat embroidered with snowflakes and he had blue bruise-circles beneath his eyes. He was slightly thinner in the face, too. It had only been a fortnight but Draco weighed barely enough even at the best of times.
"It was felt that were I to receive a taste of the fate that awaits inverts, I would seek redemption," Sirius said bitterly.  "It was all kept quiet – no trial, no official record that I was even there.  It is truly amazing what can be achieved with enough gold.  My father paid some men to drag me out of bed in the night.  I was terrified, and when we arrived there…"  Sirius took a long, slow breath.  Harry could hear the tears in his voice, the terrible pain of what had been done to him.
Harry folded his arms over his chest; he had not yet put on his jacket, and so his linen shirt slid easily along his red silk waistcoat. "Permitting Aurors to use such a spell in special circumstances is hardly the same as indicating to the general population that such tactics should be used freely."
Harry had never felt uncomfortable with Ron and Hermione before in his life; that dinner marked the first and, he hoped, the only time. Hermione had chattered away, encouraging Ron to regale Harry with stories of life as an Auror and Harry had hoped that Ron would chalk up his inability to concentrate to exhaustion from too much socialising in London.
“Into the afternoon, certainly. The committee reshuffle should be announced today. I expect to be appointed to the Committee for Conjuration based on what Sirius told me, so that should at least be a meaty one.”
"No, Harry," Hermione burst out. "No, please don't say whatever it is. I do not wish to be a party to this, not this. You always did the right thing, Harry, always looked after others, always made the sacrifices you had to make. You always thought of duty and what had to be done."
He shifted his weight all at once so that he was on all fours, crawling towards Harry as his eyes burned. "You cannot leave," Draco said, his mouth wetting his lips as Harry stood, transfixed. "Not until I am finished with you."
"They give her something to reread when you are not with her," said Ron, reaching for a glass of his own.
Blaise’s lip curled. He held Harry’s gaze for a moment, coolly assessing, before he finally said, “That’s right.”
The concierge was understanding of Harry’s complaints, though he apparently had no notion that there had been unexpected visitors. Harry could hardly be surprised: although he had chosen a Muggle establishment for the sake of discretion, it had come with a number of compromises on security – there were dozens of ways for a wizard to slip past even the most eagle-eyed of Muggles.
“Ginny!” Harry started before collecting himself. “How nice,” he said, kissing her on the cheek. He found that he meant it; Ginny’s pragmatic toughness had always been a great comfort to him in their early years and he felt a nostalgia for it in light of everything happening with Draco now.
Harry's jaw tightened. "The charm they were talking about could be used to torture people, Draco, or at the very least humiliate them."
Diggory closed proceedings for the day after that; Hermione sat with Harry a moment while his guards were called for to transport him back to his cell. “That wasn’t a bad first day,” Hermione mused. “It’s suggestive but that’s all. Nothing there to really damage you in the eyes of the Wizengamot.”
Draco’s lip tried to jerk itself into a sneer before he mastered himself and replied, “But of course. Potter.” And he returned the way he had come.
Lord Draco Malfoy was walking up to the darkest corner of the alley. Harry frowned, his vision adjusting to the gloom. He could just make out a figure pressed against the wall, Malfoy leaning and pressing his long fingers on the front of the crotch. Harry's eyes widened as his vision grew clearer – it was a
“No, Harry, it’s because you left your wife and have been acting oddly and you two have given rise to speculation. I finally thought to ask a few questions of my own staff and I find that you dined and who knows what else with him beneath my very roof!” Harry had seen Sirius angry before but never like this, certainly never directed at him.
