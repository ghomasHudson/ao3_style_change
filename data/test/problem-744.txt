for crying out loud.
“You are right,” he said, taking a step closer, forcing Harry to look him in the eyes.
“Draco, I want to, but I think we should talk more about this. I don’t want you to feel like-”
Ron started absolutely
But he wasn’t going to say that out loud to her.
“You have a Herbology test tomorrow morning-”
“You’re not a mess-”
He swallowed a gulp as Harry continued. “So, today, um,”
Draco panicked.
drunk-” Ron said as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a flask, pointing it at Draco. “Why, d’ya want some?”
He wanted to turn around and run far, far away from here.
He had missed the name of the game, and all of the rules, too. Where had his mind been?
Harry’s eyes fluttered open as he violently gasped for air, his body shaking when he did so. Ron breathed out a sigh of relief.
Draco managed a nonchalant shrug.“I deserved it.”
“Malfoy? Here? I thought I would never see th’day!” Ron laughed and came over to him, throwing his arm around Draco’s shoulder. “So, who are you,
would
Draco ignored him as he walked over to the couch sitting next to Harry. He sat in silence for a moment, letting Harry adjust to having someone next to him.
“Are you really upset at me right now?”
He flung himself out of bed and scurried across the room, as Harry’s bed was on the opposite side of his. His heart felt a sting every time Harry yelled. The other boys in the room had started to wake up, still disoriented and confused as to what was happening. Soon Ron was on his feet and peering over Draco’s shoulder as he reached Harry’s bed.
Draco had planned to wait up for Harry. He was going to catch him in the common room when he came back. Draco knew he would be exhausted, so even if Harry wasn’t up for conversation, Draco could at least support him from his lesson.
The first years were frozen in terror, but finally slowly nodded their heads. Even the other students around the common room were shocked, Potter’s jaw had dropped.
“Merlin, you think he’d catch on by now!” Ron bellowed, laughing too hard at himself.
Harry laughed, and the sparkle in His eyes made Draco's heart warm. “We’re sort of fucked up, aren’t we?” Harry asked.
“Hey, don’t be discouraged. You were really good in practice,” Harry said as he came over to Draco, handing him his wand back. “Your grip is just too tight. Loosen your fingers, it will help you do the wand movement faster.”
“You know, you could actually
Something was wrong. He was falling back into his chair. Why was he falling? He felt as if his veins were freezing over, he was shivering, yet he was sweating through his shirt.
She blew her whistle, and everyone swarmed to find their positions. Draco, along with everyone else wearing a red shirt, flew over to one set of goalposts. Looking back, he saw the keepers in green at the other. The beaters were in blue in the middle of the field. There was no one wearing yellow.
“What are you doing?” She protested as Draco grabbed her arm and led her into a study room, casting a charm so that no one could hear their conversation. “Draco, no one knows what is going
He smiled. Harry Potter actually smiled at him? He was sure it was first, it seemed forced, it was a small smile that didn’t reach the rest of his face. But a smile nonetheless.
Well, he wasn’t going to be a keeper. He would rather die than sit in the same spot all game. He didn’t really want to be a beater, but he didn’t really want to be a chaser, either. At least with being a chaser, he would be able to score some points.
“No, I-”
I really really love this chapter. Things are finally looking up, and I hope you enjoy it as well :)
I was the one-” he trailed off, not being able to find the right words. He was baffled, hadn’t
enough over the summer as I should have. Library after dinner?”
His smirk grew into a smile. “Yeah, yeah I guess I have.” He felt a weird warm feeling in his chest as he said it. It didn’t bother him as much as it thought.
Dinner had ended at eight. It was not quarter past eight, and Granger had yet to show up.
Drills had gone reasonably well. Draco was definitely the fastest out of all of those after the chaser position. He could dive better than anyone else, and he could pull off the greatest number of tricks, as well as the most complex ones. His aim was not the greatest, but it wasn’t the worst, either. He was sure it was from his lack of upper body strength, but that was something that just a few weeks of training could fix.
“Why is it that you know so much about my family?
youngest seeker in a decade? Just because you got your spot first year does not mean you get to keep it.”
Before this year, Draco had never actually been to the Hospital Wing.
“Thanks.”
He pushed against him a little harder. “And
He should have been.
“No, that’s not what I was saying! You just need to relax. Show me how you would hold your wand, as if you were about to cast the spell.”
I definitely enjoyed this chapter, and hopefully you will too. Yes, it's full of angst again, but hopefully it's all worth it in the end ;)
speaking with him now?” He seemed revolted, his emerald eyes nearly bursting out of his head in disgust, and Draco couldn’t help but scoff.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, well I thought if we turn the heat up twice as hot then we could cut the time in half and leave class early.”
Gryffindor. Really, was that a question?
“What in the bloody hell are the two of you doing?”
Sounds like he’s got a big fat crush on you!”
“Oh, sod off, Potter. We are just doing some homework. At least Granger turned to someone for help instead of just copying off someone else. Judging by your performance in potions today, you could afford to do the same. Maybe then you would not be failing so miserably on your first day back.”
Fifth.
Draco, however, would skip breakfast and instead head to the library. He liked to get in a bit of light reading before class to warm up his mind before the day really began. Today he happened to be reading a muggle book, something he had never done before, but Hermione had recommended it. It was called
kissing him, and he was blessed with the opportunity of letting his fingers explore every square inch of his skin. And it was like he couldn't get enough of him, and he didn't want to stop until the sun came up.
“You do not know what is good for me.” He snapped, suddenly turning cold. “Besides, even though he is not captain, it really is
“Brilliant!” He yelled, tossing Ginny her wand. “Now focus on putting a little more power behind it. Try leaning into it a little, pulling the strength from your legs.”
Draco felt his breathing stop as Harry gently placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder, pushing it down.
Draco stuttered as he tried to defend himself. “I-I know about all the British wizarding families, of course. The French ones too.” He wasn’t lying, he had learned about all of them growing up. He focused mostly on the Sacred Twenty-Eight, but he still knew plenty about the other predominant families, such as the Potters. But he totally didn’t brush up on his Potter knowledge, ever.
But why did she bother him so much? He had heard rumors about what had happened at the end of the tri-wizard tournament. There were so many stories that he didn’t know what was true and what wasn’t. It wasn’t like he was going to ask Potter himself, as he would just shove him away. He did believe that You-Know-Who was back, but he didn’t know what else to believe.
Draco thought to himself. As he scanned the room, he realized that there was one empty bed and it was Harry's. As he pieced everything together in his still fuzzy, dreamlike state, Draco realized Harry must’ve had another nightmare. It made sense, he was probably exhausted from his Occlumency lesson that he had nothing left inside him to put up a fight in his sleep.
And it hurt, because Draco knew that he had hurt Harry, too. He knew that he had been in the wrong, that he had a strong part in them not being able to be friends, but Harry was sitting here and taking all of the blame.
yesterday, it only seems fair that you return the favor.” He crossed his arms over his chest and glared at him.

need to talk to him, he just wanted to make sure he was okay. Draco didn’t think he would be able to go back to sleep without knowing what had happened, without knowing that Harry had someone there to support him. But he
It was the most alive he had felt in a long, long time.
“So that gives you an excuse to run around and be a dick?” She scolded him.
He sighed, knowing that he wasn’t going to get anywhere. He didn’t want to push Harry further than he was comfortable with. “Fine. What do you want to talk about?”
“Oh, uh-” he was flustered. “It was nothing.”
He rolled his eyes, scoffing. “I am not going to be here all night, you know.”
“It is not
Draco frowned. “And it led me to being disowned, to being replaced.”
“You read all of this in one summer?” He was amazed. He had read five books, at most, over the summer, and he was the one who was locked up in a castle.
“I’ve seen him play a thousand times before, I think Malfoy just really was that good.”
The butterflies in his stomach started exploding into his chest. Except this time it was not a dull, warm ache, but it rather felt like his chest was being stabbed by thousands of tiny little knives, the butterflies multiplying exponentially and stabbing at his heart. He was certain that at any moment, the knives were going to win and his heart was going to collapse and his chest was going to implode in on itself, and he was going to die. He must be dying, that’s the only explanation for feeling this way. He was going to die here in the Quidditch locker room and-

They always sat at the same spot in the middle of the Gryffindor table, and sometimes Longbottom would talk to them. Or rather, he would talk to Hermione while Draco pretended he wasn’t there as he picked the crust off his tomato sandwich, but he didn’t mind. He loved eating with someone. The last time he had done so, was, well, never actually. His first feast at Hogwarts, he distanced himself from his house, running away when someone tried to speak to him. Actually talking while consuming food was something foreign to him.
Draco still couldn’t figure out how to play the game, but he had the sense that Harry and Ron were ganging up on him, as the two of them kept piling their cards on top of him, giggling like they were the Hufflepuff girls whenever they did so. Draco was also fully aware that he had lost, as he had already gone through the cup that Ron had just poured him.
“Please just let me go,” Draco pleaded.
after what I did. I should have never thought it would be a good idea to just turn cold and leave you alone in all of this, I’m so sorry. I don’t want to ever leave you, but if you want nothing to do with me, I would understand.”
“It’s bloody eerie,” Ron whispered as the Golden Trio ascended the steps to the new eighth-year dormitory. He stared at the wall of portraits and the unoccupied spaces held within the various frames.
Hermione raised her hand and pushed his mouth closed. “Harry already announced tryouts earlier today in the Gryffindor common room.”
Harry bid his friends goodnight and waited for the room to clear as he took stock of what he was feeling. He sat in disbelief. On the one hand, he wanted Ginny to be happy and to follow her dreams. On the other hand, he’d been counting on her to be there through the year to support and participate in his plans. He gripped the armchair and threw his head against the back of it. Of course, he’d never discussed his plans with her. He’d never included her in any of his ideas. He’d just expected her to be there, and that wasn’t fair at all. He banged his against the back of the chair again.
“She hasn’t said anything.” Ron paused and then clarified, “To me.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said quickly as he strode forward, closing the distance between them. He stopped a few feet away from Malfoy.
When he found his way back to his common room, it was a quarter past eleven, and he couldn’t stop yawning. At first glance, he thought the room was empty, but after crossing the threshold and getting halfway to the dormitory door, something light caught his eye.
“Oi!” Ron shouted and tossed Harry the Quaffle. He’d not caught it a moment before Parkinson rammed into the side of him and knocked it away, Nott racing past and scooping it up.
“The Ministry sent in their best experts and no one can figure out why the portraits have disappeared,” Hermione nodded, her eyes widening. “It’s both fascinating and terrifying that there is still so much we don’t know about magic.”
Harry sighed and stood up and stretched. He headed toward his dormitory door and then for some unknown reason, decided to stop and turn back to Malfoy.  “I assume you’ve started recruiting for the Slytherin Quidditch team?”
McGonagall continued, “You will detail the history of the assigned space, its original purpose, and the evolution of its usage throughout the years. The first half of this assignment is meant to be quite clinical. You are to focus on the task with an academic eye.” She cleared her throat. “The second half will require a more social approach.”
“Really?” Harry burst out. “You included me in all the return plans and dormitory assignments, but you couldn’t give me a heads up on
“Are you alright?” Hermione leaned in and whispered.
“What’s so funny?” Harry called out to Dean.
He found it quite eerie entering Gryffindor Tower through an enchanted maroon curtain.
Suddenly remembering he was wearing nothing but a pair of maroon joggers, Harry felt a blush creep over his skin.
Harry had not planned on Draco Malfoy showing up for the welcome feast.
“I’m fine,” he said.
“Two Chasers, no Seeker,” Harry countered. Malfoy almost sneered. Harry smiled and added, “Better for
“Who stole his chocolate frog?” Dean asked.
“What a surprise that was,” Ron said. “I’d never seen Parkinson or Zabini play before.”
“Are you thinking about asking for a different partner?” he asked as Harry shoved the syllabus into his bag. Ron bent his knees and crouched next to him so he could get close and whisper, “I don’t think anyone else would work with him, you know? McGonagall is counting on you to do it.”
“Out past curfew,” Malfoy said in a low voice.
not partners.”
Malfoy straightened his stance. “I haven’t the faintest idea what you are talking about, Potter.” He dropped Harry’s gaze and trailed his eyes down Harry’s form.
“What?” she smirked. “Weasley’s the one who said you’d never lost a game when you’d been wearing a shirt!”
“I want to learn as many defensive spells as I can,” one third year commented to her friends. “So I can protect my family in the next war.”
“You could forfeit,” came Malfoy’s voice from next to Harry. His eyes were bright and animated, and his hair flapped loose and untamed in the wind. He smirked at Harry and added, “There’s no shame in admitting defeat.”
“What do you reckon he’s up to?” Ron said and then took a large bite from his dinner roll.
“No,” Harry said, shaking his head. He wasn’t sure where she was going with it, but he didn’t like it. “You aren’t a shadow,” he leaned forward and whispered. “You’ve been part of the light.”
“Oh!” Hermione sighed, “Apparently, Malfoy developed this new trans-divergent heating and cooling spell to use instead of an open flame. Slughorn was gushing over him, going on about submitting it to all the magical journals, and saying what great prestige Malfoy has brought back to Slytherin.” She took a breath and lowered her voice, “Then, Michael Corner snorted and said loud enough for everyone to hear, that ‘as long as Slytherin had the likes of Malfoy and Parkinson, it would always be a lost cause.’”
“Those people that you trust are the same ones that have made me the way I am, the same ones that have now replaced me.” His words were bitter and laced with venom.
She shrugged. “No, I really do not care.”
Harry nodded, not making eye contact with Draco. They helped each other up off the floor and walked together, silently, back to the castle.
Draco shot a knowing smirk at Hermione, who returned with a glaring eye roll. “Are you sure he’s up for this?” He questioned.
It had been a great day for Draco Malfoy.
Draco tried to push past Harry again.
He didn’t want things to change too much, though. He liked taking things one step at a time, slowly adapting his normal routine. He couldn’t just jump into a new one, that was impossible. Having one friend was fantastic, but it was almost too much for Draco. To have someone know everything about you, to spend time with you, made him the slightest bit uncomfortable. It made him vulnerable. He could not imagine opening up to more than one person. At least not at once. He was fine with Longbottom joining their group on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays because he really only ever talked to Hermione, it wasn’t like Draco was getting close to him as well.
“Ronald!” Hermione yelled, slapping Ron’s shoulder. “It’s not funny!”
“Expelliarmus!” His wand flew out of his hand, once again. This time it soared over to Ginny, who caught it midair.
He lifted his head, pushing the anguish in his chest into a deep, dark closet somewhere inside of it. He would deal with it later. Along with, everything else. Eventually.
“I do not care!” He shouted, standing back up. “That kind of thinking is severely outdated, to begin with, and that word is very disrespectful, and quite frankly, very racist. If I hear you, or anyone else for that matter, ever use that word again, especially while talking about another student, you will receive a detention, and it will not be a pretty one. Is that understood?”
It was Harry who broke the silence again. “I’m sorry, Mal-
“-but you both didn’t let your family define you, and you went against your families. It took you a while to come around, I will say, but look at you now.”

Thanks so much for reading! I will see all you lovely people again on Sunday :)
team. If I did try out, he would never let me on, not in a million years.”
Potter stepped forward and grabbed his tie, pulling him into his face so that he could lower his voice. “Do all you want to me, I don’t give a shit. But when you hurt my friends, then it’s personal.”
And that was exactly what Hermione had done to him.
Draco was better friends with Hermione than Harry, so he clearly wasn’t talking about their friendship.

“There, try it like that,” he said. Draco turned his head to look at Harry, who was staring into his eyes with a look that Draco couldn’t decipher, causing the knot in his stomach to erupt into butterflies.

“My point is,” he continued, “that family doesn’t define you. And you don’t
The locker room banter had subsided, and with a quick glance around, Draco had realized he was the only one left in the room. He decided to take his time packing up the remainder of his things, trying to bask in the peaceful silence while he still could. Fridays were always too loud in the common room, and he would probably spend the rest of his night in the room of requirement, or perhaps the library if it wasn’t too busy.
Harry’s face was so close to his. Harry was still curled into Draco’s side but had lifted his head away from Draco’s shoulder so that he could talk to him better. Draco still had one arm draped around Harry, the other with his hand resting on his jaw. He was so close, all he had to do was hold him a little tighter and lean in just the smallest bit to close the gap. All he had to do was get himself to do it. Why was he so scared? Harry had been an open book lately, he had given Draco every reason to believe that the feelings he held for Harry were mutual. Even Hermione had seen it. All this fighting and tension was a byproduct of Draco’s stubbornness, and they could move past that all if Draco could just bring himself to close the space between them.
Draco’s lips formed into a crooked smile. “So, you have been doing well at Occlumency after all?” Harry didn’t seem amused. “I’m sorry. I just, I feel like such a fucking
She smiled back. “Don’t apologize. It’s really nice to know what you’re passionate about, you know? Everyone always sees you as this cold and reserved person, but I know you’re not.”
Happy Sunday everyone! This chapter is giving me ALL the feels, I hope you enjoy it! <3
thought we moved past being a cold heartless dick.”
“And second of all, you need to loosen your wand grip a bit. I would suggest,” he felt Harry place his other hand on top of Draco’s his fingers delicately, “loosening your thumb and middle finger just slightly, the rest of your fingers a little more.” His voice was barely a whisper, his mouth just inches from Draco’s ear, as he moved his fingers one by one.
The other boys came into the dormitory, breaking his train of thought. He suddenly felt uneasy, as their usual boisterous voices immediately turned to soft whispers. He turned his head to glare at them, and they all quickly turned their heads away.
He only hoped that Harry could feel it too.
His hands were cold and clammy, and he could barely hold onto his wand. But they managed to complete their potion, along with only five other pairs. Of course, they were awarded ten extra points for their exceptional alteration.
Draco had so much to do.
“You were better that time!” She said. “You got a few more syllables out before I disarmed you!” He wasn’t sure if she was complimenting him or mocking him.
“No, what?”
He smiled. “I just always have. When I was a kid I had a potions set, and it was my favorite thing in the world, next to my broomstick. I just loved mixing everything together to see what would happen. I spent my childhood experimenting, on seeing what would happen if you stirred the potion or if you let it sit still. When I came to Hogwarts, it was the only subject that really came naturally to me. It just makes
Draco.” He sighed, leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I don’t feel safe at Hogwarts anymore.”
Looking down at Harry, he felt a pang in his chest. Here Harry was, with a dark wizard literally manipulating his mind and ashamed that he was unable to defend himself against it. The pain that Harry was probably in, the pain that Harry had felt as a child thrown into a war was
“Snape told me,” he said. When she looked confused, he took a deep breath and continued. “Snape told me about Harry’s dream, about Arthur Weasley. About what it means, and I am sure Harry told you.”
“That’s great to hear,” she said, then paused before  continuing, “Harry feels really bad about what happened.”
He let out a sigh of relief at this, grabbing his towel and drying himself off before he slipped into his school robes. He picked up his neatly folded practice uniform and started to walk over to his locker so that he could pack up his stuff, fix his hair, and go.
He didn’t care about what they had to say about him. It was probably the same as always, about how he’s just so depressing, how he’s a disappointment, a traitor, et cetera, et cetera. But that didn’t mean that the whispers didn’t bother him.
Ron took the flask and pushed it at Draco.
“I mean, I think that’s another reason he doesn’t like you. He doesn’t trust you, since, your parents-” she trailed off.
“It is very long,” he noted. “If I recall correctly, Snape said twelve inches. This has got to be, what, eighteen inches?”
She seemed shocked. “But, but then why wouldn’t the instructions say to stir it like that!”
“Miserable,” Harry muttered just as Ron said, “Bloody brilliant!”
A yelp from across the pitch got his attention and he swerved around to see Nott spiral backwards after a brutal Bludger smashed into his lower back.
“‘Mione then?” Harry glanced at Hermione.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea to make either of us think about that room.” Harry stood tall and adamant, adding, “Or the things that happened there.”
Malfoy blinked and cast his eyes to the ground. “If you’ve reserved the pitch then we are the ones who should be apologising for disturbing you.”
“It just means you’re still stuck in the past, Harry. You still suspect him of something bad at every turn.”
When he turned back, McGonagall was nodding her head up and down slowly, eyeing him with trepidation. “I fear the burden yet again falls on your shoulders. I have faith that you’re capable of setting aside the past and working with Mister Malfoy—”
It wasn’t until Harry was grabbing a towel and heading for the showers that he realised Malfoy hadn’t stayed to chat like the others. He caught the blond exiting the showers and heading for the lockers. “Good match, Malfoy,” Harry said as he passed him by.
“Harry,” Hermione leaned in and whispered, “Everyone deserves a second chance. A chance without the pressures and shadows and terrors of war.”
and Harry hesitated.
From three desks over, he heard Hermione gasp.
“I know that!” Harry quipped. “Unity,” he muttered, and the heavy wood door swung open.
“We’ll see,” Harry answered and stood up. “I’ll meet you on the pitch. Grab my gear, yeah?”
The other Slytherins had made way for Harry’s arrival, but Malfoy took a few steps onto the pitch to meet him, his broom in the air beside him. He leaned against it and crossed his arms, eyes focusing on Harry as he dismounted.
Something tore at his heart, and Harry tried to mask any reaction he’d had. “Hopefully, there won’t be another war,” he said. “You can learn those defensive spells for when you become an Auror.”
“He’s not a burden to be dealt with,” Harry said. McGonagall glanced away. “I didn't mean to imply that he was.”
,” Harry muttered glaring over at Ron. “
After they ate, the trio headed back to the Eighth Year common room. Ron and Harry discussed Quidditch strategy and team management. They agreed on what sort of team they wanted to assemble and the playing style to employ, but they couldn’t pick a captain.
“I noticed it too,” Ron nodded. “I figured it was because of what happened with Michael Corner during Potions.”
Harry eyed him carefully and wondered if Malfoy was actually still upset at not having gotten his way. “I don’t know,” Harry said. “I should think you’d have had a lot of fun with a bat in your hands and license to Bludger me to your heart’s content.”
“Hmm?” Harry blinked. They were standing in front of the entrance to their dormitory.
Harry gripped his broom handle and glanced back at Malfoy who was helping Parkinson put on her shoulder pads.
Ron motioned him over. “Couldn’t find all of your gear. Just your new broom and shoulder pads.”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes and sat down on a nearby sofa. “This is my common room too, I can do as I please.”
“I thought I would have a head start on you,” Harry said.
The warm water from the shower temporarily soothed his bruises, but the heat had not been kind to his sunburn. Ron tossed him a jar of Instant Sun Relief when they dropped their things off at the dormitory. “I don’t have anything for the bruises,” he said as they headed to the Great Hall for dinner.
Harry sighed and shook his head.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, and their eyes met. His gut reaction was to look away, as if for whatever reason Malfoy knew they’d been speaking about him. But Harry held the stare, tried to keep his face as neutral as possible, and then finally offered Malfoy a quick nod of acknowledgement.
With the shadows cast by the candlelight, Harry took in the angular, almost hollowed-out contours of Malfoy’s face. Standing there in his green silk pyjamas, he appeared slender to the point of malnourished, something that his school robes successfully kept hidden.
He didn’t wait for a reply before heading into his shared room, disrobing, and falling headfirst into his bed.
“Godric’s Gobstones,” he muttered, feeling a bit ridiculous. The thick fabric parted down the center. Harry clutched the signup parchment and stepped inside. He wondered if this new set of first years, and all future Gryffindors, really, would ever experience the distinct pleasure of having the Fat Lady as their dormitory guardian. He looked around for Ginny and when he didn’t spot her, he posted the signups and headed back to his desk in the DADA classroom.
“Harry,” Hermione gave him a stern look. “It means she’s leaving Hogwarts.”
“Students do not get to dictate curriculum, Mister Potter,” she replied sternly.
Immediately after, Harry dismounted and stalked toward their gear on the sidelines. He was sunburned, wind chapped, and suffering half a dozen bruises including a rather large one to his ego. Not only had they lost, but they’d been
, scoring just eighty to the Slytherins one-fifty.
The rush of blood in his head and the pounding in his chest drowned out the rest of McGonagall’s explanation. It wasn’t until Ron grabbed Harry’s arm that he realised he’d zoned out for the entire class period.
“What?” Ron exclaimed. “It’s true!”
“But…” he trailed off, unable to really gather his thoughts. Hogwarts without Ginny? Harry had made so many plans, had so many ideas, and he’d figured she would be there through all of them. “I guess I thought she wanted to be here.”
“Ginny got a letter this morning,” Ron explained. “She’s made it onto the reserve team for the Harpies.”
Apparently the game had eased some of the tensions between the groups. A weight lifted from Harry’s chest, and he smiled as the others approached him.
Harry realised he’d been holding his fork over his food without actually eating anything.
They all nodded and smiled back, and for a brief few minutes, Harry beamed with the excitement and hope for things to brighten all their days.
“I need to be here,” Harry said, mirroring her words.
Malfoy threw up his hands. “Fine, you can have it,” he said. He reached out, grabbed his broom, and started walking toward the Slytherins.
Harry had read the letter dozens of times. He’d written notes and ideas and planned out potential dormitory situations. He, Ron, Ernie, and Terry had gotten together at the Leaky and worked out dormitory assignments, which he’d sent off to McGonagall for approval. He’d worked out a schedule for the Eighth Years to offer guidance, tutoring, and mentorship to the younger students, while also giving the older students ample time for meditation, counselling, and free periods. He’d finalised the Quidditch schedule early, so they could work it into their planning and scheduling. He’d even started organising a start of term party for the Eighth Years at the Three Broomsticks.
Harry replied, “That’s not true! I saw him over there and was wondering if something had happened to make him sit so far away.” Harry crossed his arms and worried his lip a bit. “I was being
Harry turned the parchment over, finding the final section of the syllabus labeled
“What?” Ron’s mouth fell open. “Already?”
“This Saturday,” Harry smiled. “I’ll see you there?”
Ginny’s face softened at his admission and she replied, “I know. I’ll miss you, too.” She bit her lip. “I think it’s important for us to figure ourselves out, you know? Now that we aren’t living under the shadow of the Dark Lord.” She gulped, pausing for a moment as if deciding whether or not she should keep speaking. She took a breath and opened her mouth. “That’s all you’ve really known since you got here, Harry. And I’m a part of that shadow.”
“Are you alright? You look pale.”
Seamus roared from somewhere behind Harry, and Ron dove low to catch the loose Quaffle.
“We didn’t—” Harry started but stopped. He wished Malfoy would look at him. He could feel the animosity in the air, something charged and unpleasant that hadn’t been there the last time they’d spoken. He knew it was because of what Malfoy thought he’d heard in the classroom earlier.
“Too much homework?” Harry raised an eyebrow. “You mean paperwork?”
Harry and Ron both looked up and followed Dean’s gaze. On the other side of the pitch, a small group wearing black and green practice gear had gathered, and among them, standing taller than anyone else, was Malfoy. In the bright sunlight, his hair practically glowed a soft, pale white, and made him look almost ethereal, save for the severe stare he was leveling at Harry and the others.
Harry’s eyes shot open and zeroed in on Malfoy standing outside one of the boys dormitory doors.
“Should have played with Seekers,” Malfoy said, frowning.
“Ron, come on, what is going on?”
There was the sound of a chair scraping across the floor, and Harry turned in time to see Malfoy bolt up from his desk in the back and rush out the door.
Malfoy looked almost startled at Harry’s words but quickly gathered himself. “Not aloud, at least,” he said. Malfoy’s eyes dropped to the purple bruises on Harry’s chest and abdomen. He raised an eyebrow and grinned. “Just let us know when you’ve had enough, Potter.” He began flying toward Zabini, shouting over his shoulder, “There’s no shame in it!”
Harry was halfway to the Eighth Year common room before he remembered he was supposed to be at the Quidditch Pitch. He rushed through the castle and down through the grounds, finally arriving out of breath and sweaty to the sidelines.
Harry shook his head. “My problem isn’t with my partner,” he admitted. “It’s the topic.”
Harry blinked. “Got it,” he said quickly and nodded. “Thank you.”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. “Meet at center-pitch in five minutes.” He turned around and called, “Pansy! Theo! Blaise!”
Harry froze. Malfoy’s eyes blinked open, and he focused his sleepy gaze on Harry.
They took their usual spot at the center of the Eighth Year table with Hermione, Seamus, and Dean surrounding them. Harry glanced around for Neville and was a bit surprised to see him sitting with Zabini at the end of the table.
“Heard what?” Harry crossed his arms.
“I’m fine,” he replied.
Harry cast his eyes downward and started gathering his things. “I’m fine.” He glanced over and caught McGonagall at her desk. “Give me a few minutes, and I’ll meet you on the pitch.”
Harry gaped at Ron.
“Is that so?” McGonagall lifted her chin. “And I want four more professors to even out the student-to-teacher ratio, but we can’t always get what we want.”
“Reckon that’s part of why she’s so good,” Seamus nodded.
“I am not trying to loosen something in my—” Harry frowned. “What are you doing out of bed anyway?”
He wanted to object. He wanted to tell her how wrong she was and how right they were together. But he knew that what Ginny had said was true.
Hermione nodded.
“Practise?” Harry asked. He wanted to throttle Malfoy for feigning ignorance about the assignment. He knew Malfoy had heard the beginning of his conversation with McGonagall. How was he supposed to sow the seeds of inter-house unity when Malfoy was under the impression Harry wanted nothing to do with him? He took a deep breath and calmed himself down. If Malfoy didn’t want to address the hippogriff in the room, Harry could respect that.
been a good idea to give Seamus Finnigan and Draco Malfoy Beaters bats. Harry stared down at three Bludger-sized purple welts forming on his exposed chest. The one on his back had come from Seamus, and while Harry was adamant they would have words later, the entirety of his focus was on ending the bloody game.
Hermione and Ron shared a look, and Ron shook his head. “What makes you think she wants to be captain?”
“What is that supposed to mean?” Harry frowned.
“Didn’t I?” Ron asked.
Rolling his eyes again, Harry turned around. “Goodnight, Malfoy.”
Harry walked her to the Gryffindor common room in silence, a solemn resignation heavy in his chest. He kissed her cheek and turned around without another glance, sure that if he saw her face, another piece of his heart might crack. He didn’t want to know if she wore a look of sadness or regret — or worse yet, relief — at their parting.
“Probably not,” Harry replied.
He’d felt as if he had planned for every potential situation, every possible outcome.
“That’s excellent news!” Harry smiled.
Malfoy’s lips started to curve upward, one of his signature smirks imminent, but after a brief moment of pause, his face fell back into a stoic state, and he merely cast his eyes down.
The blond smirked. “It’s my favourite.”
Harry put his fist down on her desk. “What about
“Harry,” Dean said as he flew up to him, “is this really a good idea?”
“What,” Harry said aloud. As soon as he realised what he’d done, he clamped a hand over his mouth.
“What an astute observation,” Malfoy drawled.
Ron frowned. “Neither was Parkinson.”
It wasn’t until supper when he caught a glimpse of silver blond hair across the Great Hall that the familiar feeling of unease returned. Malfoy sat at the Slytherin table surrounded by younger students. From what Harry could tell, he was the only Eighth Year not sitting at their designated table. Harry watched as Malfoy leaned in to whisper to a group of fourth years, each and every one of them hanging on his every word. His hands gesticulated wildly as he explained something and Harry followed the movement, almost as enraptured, his eyes focusing in on the long, thin fingers.
” he snarled through his teeth, his voice shifting to coldness,  as he clenched his fist around his wand. “Just drop it.”
“I don’t want it,” he argued. “I’m fine.”
His sneer fell as he realized Harry had a point. After a brief demonstration, he broke them off into pairs, Draco with Ginny. “I want you to practice with your partner to your comfort level. The point of this exercise is to get the wand movement and incantation as engraved into your mind as possible, so repetition is key.”
Suddenly the door to the room banged open. “I’m so sorry I’m so late, Pince was just so
with Harry, and comforting him after being punished by Umbridge had been sort of a big leap. On top of that, the moment they had shared after Weasley had left felt oddly intimate, and it was a big deal to him.
Draco turned off the shower, listening for anyone else. He couldn’t hear any showers running, and he couldn’t hear any voices or footsteps, either, so he had a good chance of being alone.
“Making friends with the Potter boy, excellent-”
The two of them whipped around to see Potter standing in the middle of the common room, shocked to see the two of them talking together.
Normally he would shove her aside and go himself, but he liked the attention he was getting. First, everyone was talking about how he absolutely
There was a reason he didn’t have friends for the past four years. He was afraid to let anyone in. He knew that if he did, it would leave him weak and vulnerable, and they would leave him the same way his parents did.
It went in.
The week had come and gone, and Draco had successfully avoided Hermione at every cost.
“No, you’re right. It’s just that, no offense,” he paused,  “you’re really not my type.”
“Hi, uh, excuse me?” The three of them turned their heads at a small voice speaking behind them. "I'm so sorry, 'mam. I couldn't help but overhear your conversation, could you help me get onto platform nine and three-quarters?”
He finally turned around to face him. His hair was still dripping wet, making the collar of his shirt damp, which irked Draco. His hair was unruly, and he just wanted to reach out and comb his fingers through it just to fix it. He realized that he had been staring, probably for too long, and coughed and continued shoving his clothes in his bag in an attempt to get out of there as soon as possible. There was that thick air again. That tension. He did
“Oh, please. Did you see the rest of his team? They were just God-awful. I’m surprised Malfoy didn’t break his back carrying them.”
Updates will be every Thursday and Sunday
He struggled to concentrate. He remembered sitting by the fire with her, arguing over who had been in the wrong during their friendship. It was stupid, really. “I remember talking with her, then all of a sudden I just, I think I got really overwhelmed. I- I started shivering, and I felt like I was drowning, and I couldn’t hear anything and I felt like I-”

more intoxicated than he was, but he was still embarrassed.
“But I feel fine. Why am I here?”
He looked hurt. “No need to be such a git, Malfoy,” he scowled, storming off.
“I- I don’t know what to say-”
“Then don’t” Harry cut him off. “You don’t have to say anything, it’s fine.”
though. And even our prefect is one? How could they ever let-”
To his knowledge, he, Potter, and Weasley were the only people who knew about this. How would his classmates protect themselves when they didn’t know what they were up against?
“Harry-”
But the practice was over before he knew it, and they were all crammed in the locker room, everyone joking and pushing each other around. Well, everyone except Draco, of course. He kept to himself in the corner, taking the care to neatly fold his practice robes before he put them in his bag.

This chapter was also a bit longer than usual, do you prefer them longer or shorter? Please let me know! I love all kinds of feedback!
you.” He pulled his fist back as far as he could while still being pinned up against the wall, but Potter was pulled off of him by Weasley before he could get his hit in.
“Draco, he really thinks that there’s nothing wrong with you being gay,” she reassured him. “I swear, we all do. It really doesn’t matter to us, and we will support you no matter what, okay? Besides, I’m glad you told us,” she smiled, “maybe now they’ll stop trying to get us together.”
He immediately recognized it as a calming draught, and gulped it down without complaining. He knew there was no use in fighting Pomfrey, no one ever got their way against her.
my favorite subject, of course.”
“Death Eaters. I know, you do not have to be afraid to say the word. I know what they were.” He leaned back, running his hand through his hair, laughing. “Oh, do not look so scared, Granger. I was disowned by my family the second they found out about me being in Gryffindor. I have not spoken to them, nor seen them, in five years.”
right?”
“I told you so.” Harry stepped on Draco’s foot for his comment.
“Thanks, Draco, for leading me into my first point.” He shot a sickly smile, and Draco kept his sneer plastered on his face. Could he be any more condescending? “First of all, I have literally used this against Voldemort himself a few months ago. But my point here is that you don’t need fancy, intricate spells to protect yourself. We all already have the skills to keep ourselves safe, we just have to learn how to use them the right way. It’s better to find one spell that you know that you can always turn to, that you can use without thinking, than to know twenty spells you haven’t yet mastered.”
“Relax-”

Maybe someone really did need him, after all, and the guilt that he felt was far worse than anything he had ever felt before.
The room was completely silent. It was empty apart from a large, plush armchair, a side table, and a fireplace with a warm, gentle fire.
“No, no a
Harry glanced up to give her a small smile, secretly thanking her, and it made Draco angry. Harry hadn’t even acknowledged his presence this entire time. But isn’t that what he wanted?
Draco laughed. “Excuse me?”
The rest of the day was a blur.
it define you. There are ties stronger than family ones, but you don’t necessarily need to spill blood in order to form them. The friendships you make and the ones who love you no matter what are the real ties. Blood may be thicker than water, sure, but love is thicker than blood.”
Nobody needed Draco Malfoy.
“So,” Ron said, not bothering to fully chew his sausages as he spoke. “I think Harry has a lot to tell us about, don’t you, mate?”
“Stop that,” Harry opened his mouth like he was going to continue, but couldn’t seem to find the words to say as he shut his mouth with an annoyed expression.
no!" She seemed shocked that he would suggest that. Draco was relieved, but also slightly hurt. “Besides, our relationship is purely academic.”
to what we have.”
As he walked onto the pitch, his heart was pounding in his ears. His palms were so sweaty that he could hardly hold onto his broomstick. He didn’t know how he was going to be able to fly it.
“Good, don’t.” She said, thrusting the parchment back at him as she closed all the books around him. “It’s perfectly fine. Besides, you’re Snape’s favorite student, it’s not like he’ll give you a bad grade on anything.”
had begged him not to go to Dumbledore. And he had a point. It wasn’t guaranteed that the Headmaster would be able to do anything about the situation. For fuck’s sake, there had been a bloody
“You replaced them too,” Harry argued back.
Draco chuckled at his annoyance.
“I just can’t do it,” he admitted in a defeated sigh as he collapsed into a chair. He ran a hand through his hair, taking another deep breath. He could hardly come to terms with this by himself, how was he going to have a conversation without breaking down like the absolute mess that he was? How was it that four months ago, he had no emotions at all, and suddenly he was experiencing almost every single one at once?
“Don’t play stupid with me, Malfoy!” He shoved him into the locker. Draco wanted to back up further but he was trapped in the corner. This was all too similar as when Potter had punched him in the nose, and he was not happy about it. No one would believe him if it happened again. It would be a matter of Draco’s words against Potter’s, and who would they believe?
“He hates you because you refused his friendship first year.” Weasley said.
He couldn’t focus on any of his classwork. Even though he felt like he learned everything one could about arithmancy in one night, he was still lost in class. He couldn’t properly transfigure his toad into a chair. Even Snape made a snide comment about how his potion was merely sub-par. He couldn’t focus on anything. His entire mind was occupied by his fears about the quidditch tryouts later that evening.
She waited until his breathing had returned to normal before continuing. “I believe that you and Granger were talking about something that upset you, which is why you got overwhelmed. Sometimes, people can get so overwhelmed that their body can have a physical reaction to their stress, and that’s what happened to you.”
and I have never seen someone try so hard to avoid someone else! Did you know she was up all night crying in the common room last night? She was working on a potions essay and said she was going to ask you for help. But, oh wait! You’ve basically shunned her! And then Ron and I had to sit there trying to put her back together!”
“It’s not like the teachers care,” she said “and you don’t have to drink, you know that. Plenty of people don’t and just go to hang out with their friends. Does that really sound so bad?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “At least I
“What the hell has gotten into you?” Hermione called after him when he left the Great Hall later. Draco was on his way to spend a nice Sunday in the library, and was planning on having approximately zero human contact. He pretended to not hear Hermione as he weaved through the crowd leaving breakfast, but there was no avoiding her when they got to the library. “What are you playing at?” She continued to badger him in a hushed voice as they entered.
That had to have been it. Potter must’ve talked to her before dinner, convincing her to never speak to him again. Or maybe she realized it of her own accord, that she didn’t want to associate with such a-
Potter banged his arm on the side of his head, causing him to jump out of his trance as the lockers ricocheted against his back. “You know exactly what I am talking about!”
He just nodded in response, which just annoyed Draco. Honestly, could the boy even speak?
Seriously, the boy who lived, the only one to defeat Lord Voldemort, and he was scared to run at a brick wall?
“So, back to last names, huh?” He frowned as he stared at his empty cup, sighing when Ron filled it back up. He wasn’t so sure that he wanted to keep playing, let alone keep drinking.
“I just, you had to say it in th’goddamn
you so that you could stop feeling so guilty all the damn time. It’s not a good look on you.”
PLEASE let me know what you think of this story! It is my first Harry Potter work, so it won't be perfect. I'm open to all forms of criticism, if you loved it, if you hate it, if you really don't care, anything!
be allowed to try out!”
“Ron, stop it!” Hermione said. “Harry clearly doesn’t want to talk about it, leave him alone!”
His mornings were still very much the same. He would wake up before any of the other boys in the room so that he could have all of the hot water and the bathroom to himself. He would first shower, then change into his bathrobe and slippers. He would brush his teeth with a muggle toothbrush and toothpaste. He found that it left his mouth with a much more pleasant feeling than a simple spell, and the action was peaceful and let his mind wander. He had only recently adapted shaving into his routine in the past year, and he wished to do it the muggle way, but he wasn’t very well practiced so he would nick himself every time and wouldn’t get a clean shave. So he normally used a spell, but if he was awake early enough he would attempt to use a razor.
“It’s okay, you’re okay. Whatever it was, it’s over now.” He whispered into the top of his head.
He never got that good night’s sleep.
at this.” Harry laughed as he collected the magical deck of cards and spelled them to reshuffle them.
It seemed that Snape was just constantly disappointed with every word that left Draco’s mouth today. “You know I only still keep in touch with them to protect you.”
“Maybe McLaggen really just is that bad.”
After saying his final, formal goodbyes to his parents, it was just him and Potter. “Alright then, shall we find a spot?”
“This is so pretty!”
, huh?” Draco tried to come off as playful and joking as he had been with Harry, but it came off bitter and cold. Part of him was bitter, though, as she had broken a promise.
“Fine,” she said, crossing her arms again. “Then what
He started moving past Harry, refusing to make eye contact with him, when Harry grabbed Draco’s elbow and pulled him back. Draco felt the warmth of Harry’s hand through the sleeve of his robe, which was oddly comforting yet awkward.
“No-”
“Can we change the subject? Please?”
Draco sighed. “I will go talk to him, you should get some sleep,” he said.
“Oh, no,” Draco said. He had to get Potter’s trust, he had to make him like him. “They’re not all bad, just a few, you know? I didn’t
Maybe what Snape had said had resonated with him.
“How is it that the two of you are already drunk?” They were
He scoffed. “Scared, Potter? Scared I am going to take your spot? That I am going to outshine the
“No, mate, there’s nothing wrong with that,” he said as he finally took control over himself. “No, Draco, I’m sorry I laughed like that. None of us here really give a shit about stuff like that.”
Draco sneered as he cut him off. “Isn’t that some pansy-ass spell? You’re really going to waste our time with-”
He didn’t look behind him to see if she noticed his abrupt departure. He didn’t open his ears to listen to any more remarks from Potter or Weasley. He didn’t want to know.
“Okay, so Draught of Peace, should be simple enough,” she said. Draco merely rolled his eyes. They began their potion, working in near silence, Draco grateful for this. While she was very smart, Granger was also quite bossy, even when she wasn’t right. It was very annoying.
don’t even read the instructions!” He protested. “Every time I try to go by the board, you sit here and go
Harry was in the common room, alone, sitting on the couch next to the empty fireplace. He was curled up against the arm of the couch, his head buried in his arms. Draco thought he heard him crying, but Harry immediately tensed up and went silent. He had probably heard someone coming down the stairs and lifted his head ever so slightly to see who it was, enough to where Draco really couldn’t see his face.
And he broke his promise, because he started avoiding being alone with Harry. He made sure that they were never in the dorm alone together, he made sure to always show up late to meals so Ron or Hermione would be there as well, and he made sure to never walk alone in the halls unless he was in a large crowd. When he was with Harry, he made it a point to be as cold and quiet as possible. Whenever he did speak, he would be snappy and snarky, but not in the playful way that they had been in the past month, but in the same way they had fought before they had become friends. He could see Harry getting frustrated. He hated the idea of Harry hating him, but it was the easiest way to end things without hurting him. He knew that he was being a dick, and that it wasn’t a good idea, but once he started he couldn’t stop.

“You know bloody well what I’m talking about! I just don’t know
of the Potter bloodline? He invented Skele-Gro and Pepperup Potion? He basically founded medicinal potions!”
He broke from his train of thought, watching her sit across him, grabbing even more books from her bag and organizing them into near piles.
It also explained why he couldn’t breathe.
Happy Sunday!
Draco chuckled as he nodded. “Yes, yes we are. But we’ll get through it. Together.”
He jumped when he made eye contact with Hermione.
Maybe it was because the word was directed at Granger. Again, he didn’t mind her, but it’s not like he was friends with the girl, either.
To his surprise, the common room was empty after dinner. The only occupants were Draco and Octavia.
behind the table to sign up!” She eventually grew tired and resorted to screaming. “Get in a line
Hermione blushed as Draco shot him an evil eye.
“Do you know how advanced Occlumency is? Do you know how few wizards are able to master it? The fact that you’ve made it through three lessons without collapsing is astonishing,” Draco assured him. “Plus, it’ll take you a while to do it in your dreams. You’re bloody unconscious, for Merlin’s sake.”
Draco smirked. “And it is not my fault that I am the only person in this room who has an ounce of competency in this subject.”
Harry had teased Draco every time it happened, and Draco would shoot a witty insult right back at him. Their conversation felt natural, like they had been best mates for years and they could do this for hours.
“I meant,” she said, “I wanted to apologize for stooping down to your level.”
Earlier I updated twice a week, but I think from here on out it'll just be once a week. I'm planning on updating every Sunday (today is Friday, I just couldn't wait to post this! I might update this Sunday as well, but can't promise anything. Next Sunday will definitely be a new chapter though!), so keep your eyes peeled on the weekends!
“Well, perhaps you could change that. I know I am not exactly the most inviting person, I too enjoy keeping to myself. You know that. But I do have people I talk to, people I trust. People I can go out with and enjoy my time. Just because you live an unfortunate life does not mean you must torture yourself.”
Potter moved across the room as if he were flying instead of walking. His long legs floated his body quickly towards him, until he grabbed him by the collar and shoved him against the wall. He put his face in Draco’s, their eyes staring into each other. His were wide with rage, his nose sneered, his mouth breathing heavily. Draco felt his stomach drop as he stared into Potter’s wild eyes.
to come in and one up me in quidditch, because you’re just so much better than everyone else at everything, huh? You can’t just take your academics and go with that, no! You can’t just let people have their own things, can you?”
“We will talk later, yeah? I promise.”
Hermione had broken her promise.
His eyes burned with rage. “How
“What is your angle, Malfoy?” He whipped around. “Were you trying to fuck with me, or send a message or what? Why would you get so close with my best friend just to hurt her?”
Sure, he disliked the word. He used to always be the one to use it, but once he was disowned by his family, he realized that pureblood ideology was just a load of shit. In fact, procreating with muggles would raise the wizarding population, so why was it so frowned upon? Magic was something to be celebrated, to be proud of, not something to be kept behind closed doors.
sometimes!” He shouted back. “First of all, you keep
Harry groaned and threw his hands up in the air. “Goddammit, Malfoy! Thanks for giving away my hand!” He played an eight, so obviously Draco was wrong.
but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.“I do not know what you are referring to.”
“I do not know what you are talking about.” He said without looking her in the eyes, opening one of the books she had just closed.
He felt trapped. He couldn’t move, no matter how hard he tried, and it caused him to start to panic. Harry was too close to him, so close that Draco couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t think, the only thing he could concentrate on was his head and his stomach and his lungs and his chest all simultaneously screaming at him, but there was nothing he could do about it because he was trapped.
“What’re you thinking about?” Harry raised an eyebrow, catching him off guard.
His shirt clung to him, sticking to the sweat that was beginning to drench his body. His hair was messier than normal, which said a lot, and his hands were gripping Draco’s biceps, his fingernails digging into his skin. His chest rose and fell, quickly at first, but gradually slowed as he came to, his grip loosening and his eyes darting around the room.
“Merlin, Malfoy, you’re absolute
“What are you talking about-”
“Oh, shove it, Malfoy!” Now Potter was the one sticking a finger in his face. “But that’s fine, that’s expected of you. But then
Draco groaned and put his head in his hands. Dear God, Harry Potter was going to be the death of him, in every single way possible.
“He sounds like a real ball-hog, if you ask me.”
“You don’t have to apologize, my dear boy.” She smiled, reaching into the box and taking out a vial. “Here, I think you should drink this.”
He gently moved his hand up and down Harry’s upper arm in a soothing motion. “Do you want to talk about it?” Draco mumbled into his hair.
“Yeah, and now I am looked down upon by everyone who values the Malfoys. I am still technically the heir, you know, but I doubt I will be able to find anyone who would be willing to continue the Malfoy bloodline with
Draco's father cleared his throat and gave a cold, sickly smile. “Of course, my boy. First year at Hogwarts?” Potter simply nodded his head in response, wide-eyed. “The same is true for our boy, Draco. I’m sure the two of you will just be the best of friends.” Potter’s eyes met Draco’s, and he instantly remembered him from the shop as well, though Draco didn’t think he enjoyed their meeting.
Potter? What am I, your
Quidditch practice was a relief.
and that’s mostly on me, and I’m sorry. But I
Draco didn’t know why he liked being in Harry’s presence so much, why he craved it so desperately. A month ago, the two of them could hardly be in the same room as each other. A month ago, he hated Harry Potter with all of his guts. But here they were, talking about friendships and those who loved you no matter what. Why the hell had everything changed so fast?
But when he thought back to his previous encounters with Harry, everything started to fall into place. All of the emotions he had been feeling, that seemingly came out of nowhere, started to make sense. The tension was always there, and now that they had grown closer, it was simply manifesting itself in a different way, in the way that it always had been that Draco had refused to pay attention to.
He leaned over his knees, putting his head in his hands. He didn’t know what to do. He wanted to go to Dumbledore. He didn’t feel safe at a place where teachers tortured their students. She had gone
“That’s quite the understatement.” Snape sneered.
Unfortunately, he seemed to be the only one in his house who thought so, and it was usually a painful class to sit through. He was the only one who Snape was somewhat decent to, but it wasn’t just because he has his godfather. It was because Draco was the only competent person in that class.
He let go and started walking away, but Draco chased after him. “Wait, Potter, I
“You- you do know he has detention, right? With Professor Umbridge? He won’t be there, not for the next two weeks.”
Harry had moved quickly, as if he had been waiting for Draco. Before Draco could realize what was going on, he was pinned up against the locker staring into Harry’s wild and angry eyes.
So he sat by himself, reading his Ancient Runes book for the third time as he pushed mashed potatoes around his plate. But just because he wasn’t sitting with Hermione, didn’t mean he wasn’t listening to what they were saying.
Harry waited a few moments before throwing up his hands. “Well, are you going to tell me what happened?”
“You’re up late,” Harry pointed out.
He looked disappointed. “You know, a name like that has great value to your family-”
“You said you had already edited them-”
“And that’s three drinks for everyone!” Fred called out, causing everyone to groan.
me in front of my own house-”
” Harry had loosened his grip just enough so that Draco no longer felt as if he was trapped, but still enough to keep him in place.
“Is it because you are blaming yourself for something that is completely out of your control and is not your fault at all?”
Harry’s lips had curled into a grin as he chuckled, and it sounded like music to his ears.
He sent him a sympathetic look.
Thanks so much to everyone who has read this story! I appreciate all of your feedback so much, and I welcome even more! I hope you all have a fabulous weekend :)

“I’m glad you’re at least mingling with intelligent people,” he said. “Even if she can be a know it all at times. I’m surprised that it doesn't bother you.”
Potter giggled in response, and a small smile crept onto Draco’s face.
He ran from the room, never looking back at the Great Hall shocked in silence behind him.
“Alright, everyone!” Angelina yelled, stepping into the center of the pitch. “Welcome to the 1995 Gryffindor Quidditch tryouts! We are really excited to see all of you here, and we are even more excited to see what you all have to offer! We’ll start off with some drills for the positions you’re trying out for, and later we’ll have some scrimmages going! We’ll start with everyone’s first choice, so beaters, go along and follow Fred and George, keepers will be with Katie, seekers will be with Alicia, and chasers will be with me! Good luck, and have fun!”
“Is it just for the sake of Hermione?”
He looked her in the eyes before watching her shoulders rise and fall, and he tried to mimic her. He didn’t even realize that he had stopped breathing and he felt the knot in his chest start to loosen. “I am sorry, I don’t know why-”
She seemed taken aback. “I- uh- sure, I guess.”
to build himself back up this year. He worked so hard to come out of his shell, to make friends, and to repair his relationships with his enemies. Here he was, finally comfortable around people, finally comfortable to let all his walls come crumbling down, and Draco had gone and thrown that all away just four words.
“Hm.” He hummed and spun around, walking away, his cape flourishing as he moved.

Draco felt a pang of something in his chest. Sadness? Disappointment? Jealousy? Perhaps it was all three, sad that he couldn’t disarm a fourth-year girl, disappointed that he had done so in front of Harry, and jealous that Harry was giving Ginny all the praise.

Potter’s voice made him nearly jump out of his skin. He had dropped his quidditch shoes and scrambled to pick them up and shove them in his bag. “I- I just, uh- I did not realize anyone was still here-”
Maybe it was just the alcohol, but maybe things were finally changing. Draco thought it was nice, being able to sit and laugh alongside Harry, teasing each other playfully while Ron preceded to do something stupid. It was much better than shoving each other up against walls and throwing punches and breaking noses.
“I mean,
not! Not even
“Stop feeling sorry for me,” Harry said.
Except Draco couldn’t really argue. Potter was an amazing seeker, and with Draco out of practice, Potter was definitely the better of the two.
He looked up and his frizzy-haired best friend was looking down at him, arms crossed, a disapproving look on her face.
The whistle blew.
Happy Sunday! I rewrote the end of this chapter maybe three times, so I hope my work paid off. Honestly, I kinda struggled with writing this chapter and thought it was going to end up being pretty short. But it is officially THE longest chapter (so far)! So yay!
Harry rolled his eyes. “Really, Draco, it’s not a big deal.”
He hadn’t felt this much excitement in such a long time.
“So today we are going to learn, or rather, practice two spells I’m sure most of you are familiar with. We’ll start with expelliarmus-”
“It’s not fair!” Draco protesting. “The two of you were ganging up on me!”
Draco sighed. “I mean, kind of. It’s different from the other side, you know? I knew you grew up with muggles, and you must have really loved your family, but they’re sort of a threat to us. You ever learn about witch trials?”
“Fantastic. And welcome to Gryffindor house, by the way, I hope you have a splendid evening.” And with that he stormed off to his room, leaving a dead silent common room behind him.
He made his way to the middle of the field. He locked eyes with the third year trying out for chaser on the white team, whom he was going up against in the face off. He mounted his broom, flew up into the air, and waited for the start. He was so nervous that he felt as if he were going to fall off his broom. If he couldn’t handle the pressure of playing in front of his house, how could he manage to play in front of the entire school?
“Watch it Potter, your temper is getting out of control again.” It took every ounce of control for Draco to stay calm and not sink down to Harry’s level, as he knew that it would piss him off even more.
are you sorry for?”
“Oh no, this was just for arithmancy.” She corrected. “I also read about six other books, mostly for ancient runes and herbology.”
He took out his parchment and quill and began working on his potions essay that was just assigned, writing it with ease. He only had to write 12 inches on moonstone, but he felt as if he could write miles and miles about it. His thoughts of everyone talking about him had long left his mind, as all he could think about was potions. He let his mind and his quill wander, getting lost in his work.
But it seemed as if the Universe wanted to keep them apart, as they never did get the chance to speak with each other that day. Draco had spent the past few days so meticulously avoiding being alone with Harry, but now when he needed it more than ever, he wasn’t able to.
and he could clearly see that in the way his arms bulged out from his shirt that was just a little bit too tight.
I hope you all enjoy this chapter, I've had this scene stuck in my head since I first fully planned out this fic. It didn't come out the way I wanted at first, but I think I finally did it justice in the end!
annoyed at how they were making fun of him.
“Why are you still here?”
He found that if he sat in the dorm for too long, Potter and Weasley would send him dirty looks. He instead would spend his time in Snape’s office when he could, or would otherwise hide in the Room of Requirement. Hermione would never dare to go down to the dungeons, and to his knowledge, he was the only student in the school who had known about the hidden room.
Draco put up his hands defensively. “I just don’t understand why the two of you hate me so much.”
hey guys! I hope you enjoy this chapter, hopefully you can see things finally looking up and the pace picking up a bit! I am VERY excited for the next two chapters, I can't WAIT until next week!
when you found out about Umbridge, and I was just so confused. And then you went and had a panic attack over it and all I could feel was guilt. You helped us with the DA and somewhere in those few days, I had realized how much you’ve changed. And I’m sorry that it took me so long to realize it, I should have been your friend right alongside Hermione from the beginning, but I was stuck in my old ways like the arrogant bastard and I am
Updates every Sunday and Thursday :)
“Thank you all for coming today.” Harry cleared his throat and spoke as he gazed around the room.
“Seriously, Potter? Do you even realize how many potioneers you have in your bloodline? And you can’t even manage to muster up a simple wit-sharpening potion.”
about it all.
PLEASE let me know what you think of this story! It is my first Harry Potter work, so it won't be perfect. I'm open to all forms of criticism, if you loved it, if you hate it, if you really don't care, anything!
He felt a warmth creep into his heart and spread through his veins at the sound of the boy’s chuckles.
to be the hero in everything, doesn’t he?
“Yeah, okay.”
I’m so sorry this is so late! I was planning on making a double update this past weekend to make up for it, but I rewrote this chapter about three times instead because it just wasn’t turning out the way I wanted it to. It’s still kinda meh :/ so feedback is very very welcome!
going to let you go."
Draco managed to give a soft smile in return. “Yeah, I guess.” He couldn’t bring himself to fully believe them.
She gave a skeptical nod. “Okay, sure. Now I wasn’t exactly sure what you needed help on, so I prepared for everything.” He fought to suppress a chuckle. “Obviously not
After the school year, Professor Snape allowed him to stay at the Castle with him over the summer with the permission of Dumbledore. Draco stayed in a bedroom connected to an unused classroom, originally designed for a previous professor. Dumbledore kept this arrangement under the table, and the only people who knew about Draco Malfoy’s permanent residence at Hogwarts were the professors themselves. His parents had no idea where he was currently living, nor did they ever try to figure it out. Snape regularly wrote to them, being close friends, but never once mentioned Draco.
There it was. He could do this playful banter all day.
could accept that!”
His eyes found his way across the room, locking onto the seventh year Ravenclaw boy whom he had danced with earlier. “Preferably with a penis.”
Ron patted him on the back, just a little too hard, causing him to wince. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”
“I, of all people, would never-”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Draco. No one is going to

At least he wasn’t with Finnigan. God, he’d rather jump off the Astronomy tower than have him burn his hair off.
Draco used to eat lunch alone, but he now ate with Hermione. Potter and Weasley had a different lunch time than the two of them, as they were in Divination and then ate while Draco and Hermione had lunch then Arithmancy.  Draco quite liked this, as he didn’t want to be fourth-wheeling the ever so perfect golden trio.
were the one who threw the punch, and walked off to their dormitory.
He was alone in the room when he closed his eyes, but he opened them abruptly when something had moved. Had he heard the door slam shut? Draco sat upright in his bed, still fully clothed. The motion caused his open book to fall off his chest and onto the floor. It was dark outside and the rest of the boys were asleep in their beads, meaning that Draco had really closed his eyes for a few hours. He cast a quick tempus charm and saw that it was half-past two in the morning.
“Please,” she begged, even tugging on the sleeve of his robe. “Just come for an hour. I won’t be drinking, and you can stick to my side all night, I promise I won’t abandon you.”
Umbridge had already disbanded all student organizations. What would the repercussions be for going behind Umbridge like this, for going behind the ministry? Would it be detention? Expulsion? Draco couldn’t afford to be expelled. Hogwarts had his home, he had nowhere else to go. What would he do, live on the streets?
“So, you are alright, then? After everything?” Normally, Draco would think that someone who asked a question like that would be prying, sticking their nose into his personal life, but he felt Hermione’s genuine tone. His chest felt warm, as it was nice to have someone care about him.
He didn’t ask to be thrown into this situation. He didn’t ask to be standing up to pureblood elitist first years, to be on a first name basis with everyone in his house. And now here he was, trying to fix a friendship that was doomed from the start, comforting his roommate whom he hadn’t spoken to for five years after their teacher was using medieval
He opened his eyes to see her staring right into his. “Well, that’s why we have the DA, we’re going to learn to protect ourselves, and-”
Thanks so much to everyone who has read this! I did NOT expect so many people to read this so quickly! I love all of you so much <3
Draco was cut off by a fist colliding with his nose.
Ah, yes. They were talking about him.
“I received a letter from Lucius last night.”
He squinted at Draco, as if he were trying to see through some sort of veil of lies around him. Eventually, he just shrugged. “Seems fair to me,” and shoved a spoonful of food in his mouth.
Draco knew he was right. He sighed. “Whatever happened to blood is thicker than water?”
"Well," Draco began, "there are four houses. My parents described them as families within Hogwarts. You take classes with them, eat with them, sleep with them, everything. There is Slytherin, who are cunning and ambitious. Ravenclaw, which has all the smart people. Gryffindor, where the brave go. They are all pretty cocky and annoying, though, if you ask me. And then there's Hufflepuff. They're just kind of the leftovers. They are potatoes, really."

It was pathetic, really. It had only been two weeks at school and he had already let someone too close to him. Now, one week later, everything was back to normal but so very different. He could no longer just hide in plain sight. He used to be able to move through the halls with nothing more than a few rotten glances and a push or a hex every here and there, but now he had to dodge through the crowd praying to not be seen.
She gently stroked his hair. “I think you ought to get some sleep, it’s still the middle of the night. There are many ways to approach it, and not everything works the same for everyone. We can discuss it in the morning, but I think that your brain could use a little bit of rest.”
She nodded, with a quiet “thank you,” and they continued their potion in silence. Draco had almost completely forgotten about his outburst the night before until she brought it up.
“No!” He stood up. “You cannot tell me what to do! I will not listen to you! I do not belong in this house, I belong over there,” He pointed at the Slytherin table, “and I do not care what some stupid hat says! I am Draco Malfoy, I am a Slytherin, and I will never,
Harry looked up at him for a brief moment before burying his face in his knees. “If you’re here to be a dick, please just fuck off.”
“I have no family.” Draco snapped, jumping off the table and grabbing his book.
Draco rolled his eyes. He had been partnered with Harry for potions, so naturally, he had taken over and done almost all of the work. He let Harry have some fun, as he made him dice all the ingredients for him. “I think you should get your glasses checked. The board says twenty-four.”
The whispers and murmuring had stopped. There was a collective gasp when Draco was pushed up against the wall, but the common room was now in a shocked silence. He couldn’t see anything apart from Potter’s piercing eyes, but he was sure everyone was frozen in place.
“Yeah, I am doing alright.” He was going to stop there, but he knew she would be restless without more information. “I had, um, a panic attack,” he lowered his voice. “I just, got so overwhelmed that, I, my body had a physical reaction, I guess. Pomfrey helped me with some ways to stop it, and gave me some calming draughts for emergencies. I will be meeting with her again later this week, but I think everything is going to be alright.”
He felt his heart sink. He felt something he had never felt before, guilt, and he didn’t like it at all.“Oh, I- I did not really know she felt that way.”

“Why weren’t you at dinner?”
proud.” His mother’s comment warmed his heart, as he had been nervous about this moment for the past year.
He was right, he had
Harry interrupted Draco’s sentence by picking up the pillow on the couch and whacking him with it.
“Go away,” he mumbled, his voice cracking.
He was suddenly aware of the position he was in. He had slid his back down the lockers so that he was sitting on the cold floor, his hands clutching the front of his shirt in front of his chest. Harry was kneeling in front of him, one hand resting on Draco’s jaw.
“Ron, that’s enough-”
Draco thought.
“Oh, sod off, four eyes.” He rolled his eyes as he picked up his cards, smiling to himself.
him, do you?”
” he sent himself into another uncontrollable fit of laughter.
But first, Draco was just going to close his eyes as he lay in his bed, just for a brief moment. His eyes had grown heavy from reading. Harry wasn’t due to come back from his lesson for another hour, Draco could spare a minute or two to relax.
He tried to understand it, he really did, but nothing made sense. “But, why did it happen? Why tonight? Did I start to do it again just now?” He was glad that he was given the potion, or else he was afraid that he would start hyperventilating again.
His heart sank. He really didn’t know why he did it, and he really didn’t want people to remember that he did it. He just stared at her directly in the eyes and shrugged, hoping she wouldn’t question it further.
Draco didn’t even realize that his eyes were closed. He opened his eyes, blinking away the tears that blurred his vision. “Um, I can see-” The only thing he can focus on is Harry’s face, right there in front of his, the green eyes piercing into his own. Harry’s lips are softly parted in a worrying expression. He thinks for a second that he could lean forward, and-
The mediwitch sighed. “Your friend, Miss Granger brought you in. You had fainted in your common room, do you remember that?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yeah, and you’re the first person to
Draco nodded even though he didn’t believe he could. But he listened to Harry, breathing in until Harry counted to ten, then breathing out while he started over counted back up again. The stinging in his chest was still there, but it was going away.
He felt a hand placed delicately on his chest. Was someone trying to pull him out of the water?
Draco didn’t know how he was going to do this. He couldn’t hurt Harry, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. But how was he supposed to pull himself away? Every time Draco looked at Harry, it was like time had stopped and nothing else mattered, nothing except Harry, and Draco would let himself get pulled into Harry’s gaze. How was he supposed to resist that? He was going to have to do it slowly, and it was going to hurt, but it was the only way. The only thing that he was afraid of was Hermione noticing. And of course, she did.
wanted to be a seeker. He loved controlling the game, he wanted the thrill of chasing the snitch, the pressure for him to catch it, the roaring crowds admiring him when he won the game for his house. But he didn’t think that was really an option, as that position had already been filled.
“Oh, don’t be like that. You’ve come to see this in the past month or two, you just needed someone to

Harry sighed, avoiding eye contact. “I dunno, it’s just that I’ve had like three lessons with Snape and I’m not making
And she was right, he had already rewritten everything on Tuesday. But after taking one glance at his Transfiguration essay, he knew that he had to do it again. He was sure that he would get by just fine on his Potions essay without rewriting it one more time, but he was in a mood where he
That was a lie. He knew
Draco looked down and bit his lip so that Snape couldn’t see him holding back his laughter.
“I saw your storm off in the Great Hall.
“If you feel comfortable, instead of taking turns with your partner, see who can disarm the other faster. Speed can make all the difference in a real-life situation,” Harry called as he circled around the pairs, observing, stopping every now and then to correct someone or give advice.
“Really?” He was shocked. “But- but you hate Divination so much? They are really similar, I cannot see how you can love one but despise the other.”
She nodded, looking down with a small smile. “Thank you, that does mean a lot-”
“Are you kidding me?” He interrupted her. “Do you understand the magnitude of what’s going on? People are beginning to disappear. If Voldemort is really back, and I believe he is, that means there’s a war coming. And do you know what happens in a war?
had been the one to stand
Even so, he didn’t know why he got so angry. He was always great at controlling his emotions, or at least he thought he was. Whenever someone would pick on him or shoot him the wrong look, he would simply make a snide remark and keep walking. He would always be the silent kid in class, in the library. He had never caused a scene like that, so what happened?
Or perhaps it was because he spent all summer locked up alone in a castle with minimal human interaction, and being around a few hundred at once made him so horribly irritable.
He saw the bludger coming for him out of the corner of his eye, twisting his broomstick upside-down to dodge it. It missed the bristles of his broom by centimeters.
“No,” she cut him off, and he felt the anguish seeping back in. She sat down in the armchair across from him. “I want to apologize.”
•─────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────•
Draco yanked the curtains aside. Harry was thrashing his head side to side, covered in sweat, the blankets pooled at his feet. Draco placed one hand on each of Harry’s shoulders and started to gently shake him.
Madam Pomfrey had stepped out from behind a door a box of potions tucked underneath her arm, rushing over to him. “Oh, take it easy my dear boy!”
“You do know that’s not the full idiom, right? It’s really the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.”
“You should, I think it would look nice.”
No one said anything. “I asked a question, and I expect an answer.”
See you all on Sunday <3
He drifted off to sleep, dreaming of a perfect world in which he was the only one.
“You know exactly what I am talking about-”
Wow, I did not expect this many people to read my first chapter! Thanks so much for all your support :)
“I still was being an ass to you,” Harry sighed, “I should have let you go.
Draco shook his arm free, staring at his feet to avoid Harry’s gaze. “Hermione briefly mentioned that.”
tryouts. Then, he was able to infuriate Potter enough for him to throw a punch. Not even a hex or a jinx, but a barbaric, non-magical hit. Now, he had someone rushing to his aid when he was hurt. Even more so, she had called him
The murmurs started back up again.
“Draco! I didn’t think you would show up!” Neville seemed surprised, yet happy, to see him, which put a smile on his face.
Two weeks had passed since their initial meeting in the Hog’s Head, and here they were, finally having their first, practical meeting. Everyone who had been at that meeting was sitting alongside him in the Room of Requirement. He was both relieved and worried that no one had dropped out. He didn’t know everyone there, so how was he supposed to know if he could trust his peers?
“Yeah,” he scoffed, “because that doesn’t make me sound like a loser at all.”
care if he had a panic attack? “If he really felt bad then he would be here right now. Look around.”
“No, I really do not!” Draco yelled, actually pushing him off this time. Potter nearly tripped over the bench behind him, and Draco moved closer so that he could point his finger in his face “What the bloody hell is your problem with me?”
Draco was stunned. He was only expecting Harry to apologize for breaking his nose, but no, he had gone all the way back to the beginning and apologized for every single thing that he had done to Draco, and he was
“Oh, I was just asking Malfoy-”
Draco chimed in, his voice dripping with snark. “Well, for one, I heard she was crying. Really that bad of a kisser, are you, Potter?” There, that was sure to rile him up.
what he wanted, for everyone to see him hanging around with Harry Potter. The boy was famous, powerful. Everyone knew his name, and if Draco spent all his time side by side with him, soon everyone would know the name Draco Malfoy just as well.
do not know what you are talking about-”
“I believed this was common knowledge.” He grabbed his book, not wanting to talk about it anymore. He was already regretting telling her in the first place. “Well this has been lovely, but I do need to sleep. Why do they schedule Arithmancy so early in the morning?” She didn’t respond. “Speaking of, I could use some of your help in that class, as well. I did not read

“Stop it-”

Draco rolled his eyes when Harry spoke up again. “You should have heard him, ‘Mione. He wouldn’t
He seemed surprised. “Oh, um, hi, Draco.”
Harry shrugged. “I guess I know nothing about potions, sorry I’m not a potioneer prodigy like you.”
She nodded. “Nineteen and a half.”
“Because you were not sure that being friends with me was a good idea.” He snapped, coldly.
“What?” Draco lifted his head off his shoulder. “What are you sorry for?”
Over the past few years, Draco realized more and more that blood status was a social construct, that it had no role in a wizard’s magical abilities. He hated that he was spoon-fed all that crap for years. He didn’t know why he had even brought it up.
Draco tapped his quill nervously on the table.
Hey guys! Sorry this is a tad late, I was out of town over the weekend and AO3 was giving me some issues yesterday. I hope this makes up for it! There will still be a regular update on Thursday :)
It was liberating.
“What the bloody hell- Malfoy, you’re such an

“So you are going to go around shoving me into walls again? I thought we moved past that back in October.”
It was the afternoon that the remainder of Hogwarts students would arrive at the castle, but Draco had been here all summer. He had been here every summer, actually. Apart from traveling to Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley, Draco had not stepped a foot out of Hogwarts since arriving in his first year. The morning after the sorting ceremony, he had received a howler from his mother. He can’t quite remember the exact wording, but it was something along the lines of “you have disgraced our bloodline” and “we hope to never see you again.” That meant that once summer rolled around, he was no longer welcome to return to The Manor.
pissed off McGonagall that day), and all he had left to do was edit and rewrite his potions essay. He could also study a bit more for his Herbology quiz, but he wasn’t too worried about it.
“Together,” Harry breathed.
“You mean Sirius-”
She didn’t want him. She didn’t need him.
They glanced over, and sure enough, Potter and Weasley’s cauldron was boiling over with black goop. Granger stifled a giggle.
I hope you enjoy!!
Thank you all so much for continuing your support! It makes me so happy when people continue reading my story :)
He hated having to wake up this early and mess up his routine. He hated that he wasn’t even awake by the time he was on his broom and he hated that he still had to go to class after leaving everything he had out on the pitch.

His hand trailed down the slide of Harry’s head, his thumb grazing over the lightning scar. He traced it with his finger slowly, again and again, feeling an overwhelming sense of sorrow. This wasn’t fair, Harry had never
Draco rolled his eyes at his father’s comment. His mother simply rolled her eyes along with him, gave Draco a small smile, and clutched his hand.
He simply shrugged. “She’s just more vocal than I am-”
It wasn’t long before the sun rose, before the rest of the castle began to awake. He flew gracefully to the ground, dismantled his broom, and walked back to the castle, eager to get the day over with.

He nearly took out one of the twins several times, which definitely made some of the teammates think he was there just to harm someone.

Harry sighed. “Here,” he softened his voice as he moved behind Draco. “First of all, you need to relax your shoulders.”
He shrugged. “Read up on it over the summer. I cannot remember the name of the book to save my life, but it discussed the properties and potency of powdered potion ingredients. I am sure you can find it in the library somewhere, just ask Pince and she should know what I am talking about.”

Draco gasped. “Do you seriously have no idea?” Harry shook his head. “Your grandfather invented Sleekeazy’s hair potion, you at least know that?”
“Draco!”
“Well,” Hermione cleared her throat, talking barely above a whisper. “Harry, Ron and I have been talking about that lately. We can’t just sit around and do nothing, but- we can’t talk about this here.” She cast a nervous glance around her. “We are going to meet in the library tonight, the same room that we have been studying in, Draco, at eight o’clock. Don’t tell anyone. If anyone asks where you’re going, Draco is tutoring us in potions.”
Before long, the other three were through the wall, his mother brushing his hair with her fingers one more time. “Oh, stop moving Draco. I do not want you to look anything but your best for the sorting ceremony.”

The three of them were silent, and Draco went back to pushing his food around his plate, afraid that he had overshared.
He had forgotten about that, but purposefully or not, he wasn’t quite sure. “He was sure that he had something to do with overwhelming you, and, well, he thought if he showed up at the Hospital Wing he might freak you out a bit.”
But of course, Snape just had to torture him by partnering him with Granger, a smirk crawling onto his face when he read off the names.
“What is it, Granger.”

He didn’t know why Harry was doing this. Draco had gone off on him in Hog’s Head, sure, but Draco still had so much to apologize for on his end and he didn’t know where it was all coming from. Maybe it was because they had spent all night together, or that he was drunk and rambling and just not thinking about what he was saying.

I’m so proud!”

The weekend had come and gone, and Draco had not left his dormitory once.
“I- I am so sorry-”
Their mouths moved quickly in sync, Draco letting out a soft moan as Harry slipped his hand through Draco’s hair and tugged at the hair above the nape of his neck.
“Okay, fine. How much potions theory do you know?”
Harry’s face began to turn bright red. “I- uh, no! What? I didn’t mean it like
“It sounds like a textbook. It is not word for word from ours, but it sounds as if it might as well be. Yes, it is supposed to be highly factual, and everything you have is correct. But I can see you are an excellent writer, so show it off a little more.”
“What the hell was that for? What is your problem?” Draco yelled.
“Then you show up this year and everything has changed. Suddenly you were everywhere, hanging out in the common room instead of the library, becoming friends with Hermione, and joining Quidditch. And I was
that this house has! As soon as the house got wind of your detention, it was like everyone knew they had the opportunity to finally show the world how better they are than you, not just at Quidditch, but in everything, quite frankly-”
He coughed. “Um, your glasses are crooked. And your hair is a mess. And I can see your stupid scar.”
Draco found his other hand running through Harry’s hair, his fingers playing with the individual strands, trying to smooth it out before messing it back up again. It made him think back to the last time this had happened, to how the two of them had sat like this for hours before finally falling asleep on the couch together. Draco remembered how
“Hi,” Harry breathed, his lips still close enough to Draco’s that they brushed when they moved.
“And that Sloth Grip Roll to avoid that bludger? Iconic.”
They started walking in stride to the Great Hall, which was on the complete other side of the castle. While he was very hungry, Draco didn’t mind too much, as it allowed them to talk without other people watching them.
But then he followed her eyes and she was watching Weasley. His brief happiness immediately came crashing down. She caught his glance and gave him an over-eager smile and two thumbs up. He smiled back, but it didn’t reach his eyes. It never did. Not in five years.
Draco made it to the station just in time to slip into the crowd of students making their way to the carriages.

That would be ridiculous.

for help. “I just, I know you were talking about how you read that book about moonstone, it was checked out of the library so I couldn’t get it. I don’t think I exactly nailed it- and I, I just-” she trailed off, stumbling over her words.
“It- it was the graveyard.
He heard a faint meow and his head shot up, as Octavia never meowed.
Draco was quick on his feet. When he reached the common room, sure enough, Harry there. He was sitting there alone on the couch in front of the empty fireplaces, his legs curled up to his chest as he hugged his knees.
He had woken up at five in the morning, unable to rest. His nerves for the tryouts were beyond compare, and he decided to try to ease them by flying laps around the pitch before anyone else awoke.
“What do you want?”
Something did dawn on him, though. “Wait,” he yelled, trying to find the right words. “The two of you were ganging up on me because you could see the cards that I had!”
He still had no idea what his feelings were, or where they had come from. They seemed to come out of nowhere and hit him like a truck. He had never felt something like this before, and he wasn’t even good at processing his emotions when they knew what they were, so how the hell was he supposed to know what was going on inside his head? Was he supposed to be feeling this hurt whenever Harry let out another cry? Maybe that just meant that he cared for him, but at what point does he cross a line?
He heard it first in his dream. He couldn't remember what he was dreaming about, but he knew that he was talking to someone when their words slowly morphed into incoherent moans and cries.
Draco felt sick, and it wasn’t from the firewhiskey. He had worked
Potter raised his voice. “Do you not care what other people are saying? People are noticing that you’re spending more time with him than you are with us!”
Draco heard a voice boom through his head. He couldn’t tell if he was the only one who could hear the hat, but he hoped that he was.
“Well, why do you like potions so much?”
He packed up his things and made his way to the Great Hall. He was one of the last to arrive for dinner, but his normal spot at the end of the Gryffindor table was still open, as usual. He pulled out a textbook to read from while he ate, to make things a little less awkward and a little less sad. As usual.
He opened his mouth to ask Granger about it, but she was already saying goodnight and went up the stairs to her dormitory.
He had nowhere to go. He didn’t have class until later that afternoon. He couldn’t hide outside somewhere, it was too nice outside and everyone was there. There were always people in the common room. He couldn’t go to the Great Hall. Snape was teaching a class, so he couldn’t hide in his office. He needed
The line moved quicker than he had hoped. He hoped to stand in this line for hours, and somehow miss his chance at trying out. But soon he was at the front of the line, quill in hand, Angelina glaring at him.
Draco tightened his grip on Harry. “
“Well, thanks fo’ that, mate!” Ron called out excitedly and played a Queen, causing Harry to groan in frustration once again and take a sip from his cup.
He blinked in shock, putting his fingers up to his nose, and felt nauseous when he pulled them away to see them covered in blood.
Harry continued. “But that’s not an excuse. It’s really no excuse for me treating you so harshly and being so hostile. I’m sorry I punched your nose. And then all of a sudden you were so caring and
“You know that things are changing-”
He stopped in his tracks. Why in the
Of course she didn’t want to be friends with him. Why would she? She only approached him that second night in the castle for help with her potions homework, anyway.

what people would say. The Slytherins would belittle him for befriending a muggle-born, just giving them another reason to shun him for all of eternity. Some people would be furious at Granger for ever trying to help such a pitiful person. Half the school would assume they began a relationship. That wouldn’t have been so terrible, it might hurt him inside, but it would preserve his reputation. It was better than if they found out the truth about his sexuality. But worst of all, he feared that people would begin to dislike Granger for hanging out with him.
He was not expecting Harry to move into his embrace, choosing to curl up against his side instead of the couch.
you know? I get things the first time around. As I got older, I would always read potion texts for fun. They just- they can do
He curled himself into a ball, feeling his face grow wet. A piercing feeling shot through his heart, spreading to his chest, which just made it hurt even worse when the eventual sob escaped his lips and shook his body.

“Yeah, I would stop too if I were playing as poorly as you were,” Seamus had called out to him. When the hell did he start becoming friends with
“Well it certainly isn’t yours!” Draco wanted to defend himself, but he didn’t know what to say. Last year, that comment wouldn't have really hurt, but now it made his chest ache just a little bit. “Then, you just
Draco gave an awkward nod as Ron climbed into his bed. Draco took a deep breath as he left the room, not knowing where he was going to find Harry or what was going to happen when he did so.

“Malfoy,” he heard a hiss and whipped his head around. Granger, of course. “Where were you? All the prefects were supposed to be in the compartment-”

Draco didn’t know how to respond. He shrugged. “Fine. Just pretend I was not nice to you. Problem solved?”
for any of this.
They didn’t even speak at breakfast, since Hermione thought it would be best to go over plans for the next DA meeting. During lunch, Alicia had called an informal quidditch team meeting to go over what happened in practice that morning. And Harry had an Occlumency lesson with Snape after dinner, so Harry had rushed to eat as much as he could before it, not speaking to any of them.
She sighed. “I mean, I guess you have a point-”
“No,” Harry said. He was no longer yelling at him, but he was still up in his face, his voice stern.
“But I am right, am I not?” He raised an eyebrow, taking her silence as a yes. He sighed. “I do not blame you, I was being a dick. You had every right to be mad at me, but I had no idea to know that you were upset! How would you feel if
“Did you mean what you said?” Potter blurted out after what seemed like an eternity of silence. “I-in the robe shop, about muggles?”
“Mr. Potter,” Snape sneered as he dragged out the last ‘r’. He had managed to sneak up behind them, somewhere in Draco’s bantering. “Is it your intent to distract your partner, who is only trying to help you?”
Draco rolled his eyes again. Snape didn’t have a
“Hey-” Ron started.
” Draco felt his stomach drop. He felt guilty that he hadn’t noticed it sooner. “That’s-”
He was glad that he had cut himself off. He enjoyed his light buzz, but he did
The five boys stood there in awkward silence, Draco and Ron standing next to Harry’s bed, the others still in their own, rubbing their eyes, trying to go back to sleep.
The crackling of the fire in the mysterious room was replaced with the crackling of the fire in the Gryffindor common room later that evening.
“Wait!” Harry interrupted him. “I’ve actually been meaning to talk to you all night.”
“I meant alone.” He said, staring into Draco’s eyes. Draco quickly looked away, not liking the feeling in his stomach. “I want to apologize.”
“Why?” He snapped. “Is it your savior complex?”
“Are you serious right now?” Draco pushed it away from him. “We have a Herbology test first thing in the morning! What would Hermione say?”
“I corrected myself, I-”
Draco sure hoped so. Harry’s nerves were not helping Draco feel any better.
“He was born last night. Cephus Lucius Malfoy.”
right now?” And Draco thought that
She wiped her mouth with her napkin, nodding. “Yeah, actually. We’ve gotten to know each other quite well over the past week.”
Harry laughed as he picked up his own cards. “Wow, you really got me there. How can I ever recover from such a harsh, original insult?”
“Ready?” Ginny called, and he nodded.
Everything went by so fast, and before he knew it, Draco was standing in the Great Hall, in front of the entire school, in the middle of the sorting ceremony.
Lips barely touching, they giggled into each other. Draco savored every second of it, even the awkwardness, because it made it feel so very
He looked at her in astonishment. He hurried in the room, closing the door with her foot. A stack of books at least seven tall sat in her arms, just covering her face. Her hair was frizzier than usual, sticking out in every which way. Her cheeks were flushed, a bright rosy red, and her forehead was the slightest bit shiny with sweat.
Tearing his eyes away from Malfoy, Harry nodded. “I think getting things back on track is important. We need to establish normalcy again.”
Harry frowned. “What is that supposed to mean?”
The next morning flew by as Harry assisted in three DADA classes before lunch. He couldn’t help but smile at the fresh faces of first, third, and fourth years who sat mesmerised and eager to learn whatever they could.
“Do you mind? If you want to loosen something in that tangled mess of a head, would you please spare that poor armchair?”
The Slytherins smugly offered them a future rematch, which Ron immediately accepted, and they packed up their things to head to the locker rooms.
Harry stepped back and sat on the couch across from him. Adrenaline had spiked in his stomach, and he couldn’t think of anything to say.
He didn’t go back to his dormitory immediately, but found himself in a dark, deserted corridor staring out at the clear night sky. The stars were bright and the moon half-full. He marvelled at the sky and the vast unknowns within it. A sudden sort of peace settled over him at the simple reminder that he was a small, negligible speck of dust in the grand scheme of the universe.
Dropping his bag, Harry started unbuttoning his robes. “It’s alright,” he said, eyes fixed on his new Firebolt. Just the thought of being up in the air was already making him feel better. He pulled off his shirt and undressed down to his pants. He grabbed a pair of joggers and quickly stepped into them. He felt around in the bag for a shirt and glanced at Ron. “Did you grab me a shirt?”
“You haven’t even had tryouts yet!” Hermione interrupted, exasperated with Harry and Ron’s back and forth.
Raising a brow, Malfoy simply nodded.
McGonagall turned to him and sighed. “Do I need to repeat myself?” McGonagall raised a brow and said, “While I know you don’t think the rules apply to you, Mister Potter, the Restricted Section will only be available to you during Eighth Year free periods.”
