A Bludger had rammed into Alice sideways and knocked her off her broom, and she’d lost sight of the Snitch. Faulkner stopped the game, and Harry ran onto the pitch, all the players hovering on their brooms in place as they watched what was going on.
The way Malfoy was looking at the cards was feeding the hope growing in Harry’s chest. “Not at all. I’m keeping one for myself, but the other I’m giving away.”
“Oh? So…you’re done?” Harry faltered, nearly missing the plates Anne was handing him over the counter. Today’s course was roast lamb with mint peas. He grabbed them just in time.
Ron hadn’t understood, at first, but he’d come around, the way he usually did. Harry didn’t know where Malfoy stood—if he was aware, if he cared, if he
Ron was already in the office, legs slung up on the desk. He was slurping soup from a take-out container. “Mate,” he said. “You have something you want to share?”
Harry looked up. Malfoy’s cheeks were pink and he looked both worried and apprehensive, like he wasn’t certain about anything at all. “Yes, please.” The look turned into confusion and Harry hastened to explain, “Sorry, it’s just that you’ve been sharing all kinds of stuff about yourself and I just…I want you to also know me, you know?”
This team he’d put together for the purpose just having some fun and raising money had become an entity of its own. Evolved beyond him.
He eventually uncovered his books in the very last box in the living room. There weren’t many, but they were his. The photo book Hagrid had given him, the battered book about the Chudley Cannons Ron had given him,
,” Gladys said. “But consent is a spectrum, and agreeing to an activity for other reasons than genuinely wanting to engage in the activity isn’t entirely consensual—what do you think about that?”
Most of the morning passed with this Snitch drill, but even the kids got tired of the rain, so the rest of the morning passed indoors with paint brushes and canvases. Harry had ordered them the previous week, as summer was approaching and with it the holidays. He always did end of the year paintings with the kids, to give to their parents or guardians. And this year, Charlie, Alice and Avery wouldn’t be returning in autumn as they’d be starting school.
“Over there,” Harry said, pointing at the shelf. It held several brown paper bags, some open, some not. He started the washing machine, and then the bath.
This was met by cheers all around, so Harry went to the bar. When he came back, it was to find Parvati in deep conversation with Angelina and Lee, while Padma’s hand seemed to have found its way up Pansy’s skirt. That didn’t stop Pansy from giving Harry a searching look, a perfectly sculpted eyebrow raised in question.
Maybe Malfoy liked to read about…love stories? Love stories would probably be nice to read about so long as they didn’t have any dragons in them. The ringing surfaced again inside Harry’s skull, and he stopped in his tracks. He was just outside the shop.
Harry wasn’t sure what to say. He wanted to know, wanted to understand, but it was all very foreign to him. “Thank you for telling me all this,” he eventually said. “Was it hard? To tell me, I mean.”
And Harry wanted to know things about Malfoy, like which way his hair parted in the mornings before he styled it, if it misbehaved at all, and how many sugars he liked in his coffee, if he liked coffee at all, and if he would—could—
“I know.” Malfoy wasn’t looking at Harry. “There’s nothing I can say that will excuse or justify how I and my family treated him. I can’t justify any of it.”
“Okay,” Harry said automatically. He was having difficulties parsing this—did it mean that Ginny had been—that she’d—no, she couldn’t—
There was another jar in the cupboard from Narcissa, orange and rosemary, which was Draco’s favourite. Harry spread it on his second toast.
It sounded suspiciously like Ginny. What was she doing here? Harry dragged himself off the sofa and to the kitchen for a sip of water, ignoring her. The banging and yelling didn’t stop, however, and a headache was blooming behind his eyes.
, this therapist could help. Maybe she had answers. Maybe she could tell him what was wrong with him, why not all of him had come back after he’d died, why his relationship with Ginny had fallen apart.
“The others went ahead to the pub,” Harry said, when she was done, and kissed her again. “We’re going to celebrate your win.”
“I’d like for you to take the rest of the evening off,” she said, before she sent him out the door. “You’re overwhelmed, and you need to process.”
Malfoy gave him a nod, and then started digging into the reports. Harry saw that his little black notebook was halfway to filled out, Malfoy’s hand neat and tidy. He leaned in a little to have a closer look, but was thwarted in his efforts when Malfoy put his hand over the notebook.
It had made him forget, if only for the duration of reading, that he was just Harry, lying alone in a bed he’d shared with another person for years, in an apartment that was meant to be a new beginning.
“Ugh. I don’t know.” Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, glowing with happiness as they were. “I’m not, I don’t think. I mean, I’m not straight, not pretending. You know what I mean.”
“Okay,” Draco said thickly. “Okay. Uh—excuse me—” He cleared his throat. He was also blinking rapidly, looking away.
“Yeah—hey, Gin!” Harry turned, calling out. She was just far enough away she was outside hearing range. “You good with the equipment?”
Shaking himself out of it, Harry took the return trolley and the newly filled out request form down to the strongrooms. The documents in the return trolley returned themselves to their correct places, bar the flagged document which took itself to the conservation inbox tray. The ex libris list wiped itself and returned to a slot in the trolley.
“No, but you have been working tirelessly on becoming a better person than you were since then,” Harry pointed out. “Everything you’ve done since then has been about that. You’ve earned it. You get to have things, now.”
Ron and Hermione were both giving him speculative looks, Harry realised, and he decided to change the topic. “How is Project Baby coming along?”
“In or near Soho,” Harry said. “I don’t actually know for sure. I don’t spend much time in Muggle London. This way.” The store was just around the corner. “So…you don’t want to die anymore?”
“It’s Peony. I don’t go by any of those names anymore,” she responded, awkward and hesitant. “I’m sorry—I’d just appreciate it if you just called me that. P works as well.”
Peony chuckled. “Yeah. Thank you. Hey, I’m glad you called. I’ve been meaning to talk to you, but I didn’t know how to find you.”
“You don’t think Harry gets enough publicity as is?” Pansy commented, in that sharp tone of hers. Harry had learned by now that this was Pansy’s normal state of being; this was a casual remark, not criticism or tart commentary.
Malfoy’s science fiction novel was still sitting on the night stand by Harry’s side of the bed. A wild sprout of hope pierced his heart, and Harry reached out to touch the spine of the book.
therapist thought it would be a good idea to…confront my past, to put it that way. Because, uh, I haven’t told you this, but well, my relatives that I grew up with were, ah, they didn’t treat me very well,” Harry said, floundering a lot more than he’d done in Gladys’ office. “And so tomorrow I’m meeting my cousin.”
He was still struggling with whatever emotions he was having about Malfoy, and the lack of sleep was seriously catching up with him. Looking at twelve kids—
Malfoy laughed. “Well, as far as I know, Muggle robots don’t do that either in real life. As a metaphor, though…you can say a lot about a lot of things by dressing them up as something else.”
She turned her cup round by the handle, fidgeting, not looking Harry in the eye. Eventually, though, she drew in a deep breath and looked up. “I want to apologise,” she said. “I know it’s too little, too late, for everything I put you through, but I
Technically he wasn’t late at all, as he wasn’t required to show up to the archive at a set time to use his study, and he’d never indicated a set schedule to Harry either, but he usually showed up at one o’clock or just a few minutes past, and it was ten whole minutes past one.
“No, wait, sorry, that was rude of me—let me look that up for you,” Harry scrambled to say, already flicking through the ledger, a large leather-bound volume which permanently resided on the desk. “Coroner reports, was it?”
“Okay,” said Draco. “So your relatives abused you. That’s horrible in so many different ways, but…why are you meeting with them? You don’t have to do it just because your therapist said so.”
Maybe he should cancel tonight’s practice? No, better not. Let them run all their steam off instead of keeping a lid on it until Thursday.
The nicest part was Draco, the little satisfied sounds he made, the way he came apart, and that would’ve been enough, but Harry let him have more.
. Harry breathed deeply, trying to calm his nerves. He was going to need all the luck in the world, or so it felt.
“Well, yeah,” Ginny said. “I always love seeing you fall on your face. I'll make us some tea?” She was already heading into the kitchen as if she'd never left, and Harry’s heart sped up irrationally. He followed her in. She didn't make it far, however. “Uhm.” She was staring into the cupboard she’d opened.
“Yes—actually, let’s bring them in here. I could eat.” He turned the water off, put the bath bomb aside, and went with Draco to the kitchen.
“Yeah, I—no, not really. It hadn’t occurred to me that the picture in the Prophet would mean that people would know about me. I mean, obviously everyone who saw the paper would know, but I wasn’t thinking about…
“I think you’re right.” Harry let her help him with the distribution of glue and glitter (and which colours and shapes of glitter to use) until Betty was satisfied his cards were perfect. “I think these might just be the best cards I’ve ever made,” he said, admiring the end result. “What do you think, Charlie?”
The others were filtering out of the classroom, but Harry wasn’t ready to leave just yet. He was staring down at his list, with notes and underlined and circled words, and feeling strange. A hotness spreading in his chest, almost like embarrassment, a lot like disbelief, something reminiscent of promise.
, here—” Harry pulled the stack of papers from Gladys closer and picked the one about Post-Coital Dysphoria out. “Look.”
Harry found a crumpled paper napkin in a pocket. He tapped it with his wand and multiplied it. They were all of them snotty from crying, and Harry set to work on the nearest child, wiping tears and noses. “Is anyone hurt?” he asked, expecting sprained wrists and bruises, at least. “Knee scrapes? How are your arms? Does everyone still have their heads?”
“They’re great!” Harry grinned. He knew now where to take Malfoy on a date. “They make the bathwater nice,” he explained. “I can take you to a Muggle store that sells them, you can see them and pick some out for trying.”
wanted, but Draco seemed like he…needed it. Not like the other day, in the bath. “Are you…ready?” he asked. “You said you weren’t, but—”
“Okay, so…” he said eventually. “How do I…get out of that pattern? How do I get to a point where…it’ll be all right?” It was all getting too much now. “You said sex should be a
“Professor, I-I think, well,” he begins, but finds that he has to restart. Swallowing his nerves, his next words fall out as one. “I think he was almost dead.”
“Really? Hmm,” says Malfoy, “Perhaps you’re going mad, Potter,” and he raises an arched eyebrow. Whether this is an invitation for a challenge, Harry isn’t sure, but he takes it as one anyway.
And it isn’t the satisfying release of animosity that Harry thought it would be. The bitterness in Malfoy’s  low voice doesn’t stoke the fire building inside of him- it puts it out. None of this is what Harry wanted. But what he wanted, he couldn’t say.
Erin snorts and laughs for a second time, in that infectious manner of hers which has Harry joining in, whether he likes it or not, “Where the fuck are you? It’s pissing it down with rain in London.”
They all enter Madame Malkin’s together, shoving each other to get through the door like rowdy third years. You can avoid a new cauldron, and even your new books if you are cheeky enough to just borrow them all year long, but one of the many flaws of adolescence is the perpetual growth that comes with it.
In all the commotion, Harry still doesn’t forget what his goal for the evening is. He heads to his room and contemplates getting his Marauders Map out. Ever since being back, he has been reluctant to use it. It almost feels creepy now, whereas before he just saw it as an obligatory, saving-the-world kind of thing. Hence, why he is currently considering using it again. This could be important.
He and Ron are currently playing a game of Wizard’s Chess in the common room as Hermione reads through her Potions notes. He feels in oddly high spirits after his visit with Hagrid, and he takes in the atmosphere- jovial and animated tonight- with pleasure, rather than with anxiety. That is a start, he supposes, and smiles to himself.
“Okay then,” he whispers, looking at Harry like he can see all the way through him, right down to his thundering heartbeat. Then, he hurries down the steps, out of Harry’s sight.
Frankly, Harry feels immensely uncomfortable. How does one react to seeing their former enemy, whom you and your friends on many occasions were almost murdered by, who bullied you for years, was on the opposing side of the war, yet, at the same time, was someone you couldn’t bear to see dead? It’s a complex and loaded question. Let alone one to tackle in such an intimate situation, as they are currently. Harry never wished to know what kind of pyjamas Malfoy prefers to sleep in. Maybe Ron can obliviate him in the morning.
Justin stirs the potion absentmindedly as he flips through the instructions, trying to find a specific direction.
“Did it hurt when you burnt your Dark Mark?” he asks, and regrets the question as soon as it is out in the open. He has crossed an unspoken boundary, entered new frontiers. Whether Malfoy will deem it too far, or let him across, is a different matter.
Where does that leave him now though, when the only urgency he feels is one to climb into bed? Which direction does he take when he can’t see past the end of the day?
And Harry? He wants to jump up in celebration, fist pump the air and scream with relief. A bubble of laughter rises in him- he feels almost hysterical at how refreshing it is to have the boy he once knew become real again.
Harry reads it over, and over, and over, until it becomes meaningless. Whole words turn into staggered letters. Letters turn into code. On it goes, reducing all the while, until all he is looking at are lines, lines which swoop continuously across the page. Malfoy’s handwriting apparently only turns more elaborate the more messily he writes. Harry rolls his eyes at that. It is just like the git to be so controversial.
Harry waits patiently for him to wrap his head around the words, because he knows that distractions can be excruciating when you are having to read over the same sentence for the second, or even third time, because your brain is having a meltdown. That was him with the takeaway menu over the summer. It seems comical now but it made him feel dumb and useless.
situation, before ditching the false pretence and rolling his eyes in gross exaggeration. The pale and cool bathroom lights wash out what little colour he has, and he appears more ghostly than ever. As he leaves the room, shadows flit across his high cheekbones and jaw, illuminating the sharp angles of his face and he looks bizarrely ethereal. Harry frowns, because he could have sworn that usually the bathroom has warm, yellow lighting. He must be mistaken, because the bathroom simply
Harry looks up at the curly-haired boy beside him, who is smiling timidly, appearing almost afraid, and he suddenly understands that this is that exact same moment for Justin. He needs to be there for his new friend, needs to convey that he
as Justin. Think of all the well-meaning, solid advice he would have to endure and possible take up. Ignorance really can be bliss.
Once he is gone, because of course he leaves, the steps catch Harry as he drops. He burrows his head into his hands, overwhelmed with humiliation. In spite of his plight, one thought wiggles its way to the front, as pathetically incessant as Harry was only five minutes prior.
There are several beats as neither of them say anything. Despite the silence, Harry can tell Mcgonagall hasn’t finished. She is purely giving him the opportunity to mull over the situation. He can tell by the twinkle behind her silver spectacles.
“I’d like a tea,” admits Malfoy when Harry doesn’t expect it, pulling his legs tighter into himself, “Maybe an Earl Grey, or Jasmine.” The way he says it, it sounds like a confession. With how different Malfoy is acting from the last time they spoke, Harry is almost getting whiplash.
Malfoy is alone. To his confusion, he is relieved. And surprised- though he shouldn’t be, considering alone is the boy’s usual state.
“Oh stop it, you,” she elbows his side, “You should really listen some time, both of you. It’s awfully fascinating and it could do you both some good to enrich yourselves with knowledge outside of schoolwork. If only you knew how to pick up a book.”
“That would be a sight to behold,” Harry laughs at the image, and Hermione chuckles with him, “Maybe it would, uh, bring out your bone structure?”
Harry clutches his stomach, feeling the telltale signs. “No, really. I think I’m going to be sick.” His head is still stranded in between all the different images at once, stuck hearing what he thinks is Malfoy screaming. It could be anyone, though; he might have triggered another memory. Whoever it is, the noise pierces his brain and slices through, ripping even harder. He rushes to the railing, barely getting there in the first place for all the tripping up he nearly does.
“Dean and Seamus said they’d be there, Blaise said he’d come, but didn’t say if he’d bring Gilliam, Pansy and Padma will be there, though possibly not until nine, George said he and Lee would be there, Angelina too if they could find a sitter, Percy and Oliver said they’d try to make it, but Oliver is refereeing a Little League tomorrow and then playing for Puddlemere after that, so it might just be Percy.” Harry frowned, counting on his fingers. “I think that’s everyone.”
“No, it’s not…” Harry drew in a deep breath. Malfoy had told him he was writing a book about dying, that he was in therapy for anxiety…and he’d promised to lend him more queer books, he’d…the least Harry could do was answer this one question. “After I served out my prison sentence and community service I was offered a spot and since I had nothing else to do, I accepted it. And everyone else expected me to take it, you know? I was
Maybe Ginny would like the card, after all? It didn’t have to be romantic, it could just be a card, and the kids had signed it…but she hadn’t been in touch since she’d left, even though she still had things at their flat, and…well,
It’d been a long time since Harry had last seen Malfoy, though he’d heard a little about him through the grapevine over the years; apparently he’d been keeping himself busy by restoring Malfoy properties and selling them off. Last Harry had heard, Malfoy had spent the previous winter in Cornwall, fixing up a neglected Manor House and doing repairs on the local inn. It seemed they’d held historical value to Muggles in the area. Something about smuggling alcohol from (or was it to?) France during the Jacobean era (or something, Harry didn’t know who Jacob was or why he had an era named after him), Harry thought. Pansy had said something about it.
“No.” Harry reluctantly returned to the physical space he was in. “I was just thinking. Were you saying something?”
Charlie was on the bench, Rachel keeping the goal in this last stretch, and both Love and Emma were beating Bludgers with a particularly keen vengeance Harry had only ever seen in girls.
, or something—which turned out to be a delicate stew of sorts with chicken in wine and vegetables. Harry perched on the kitchen counter, watching Draco finish it off while he rambled about all his ideas for the future.
Harry had the weird feeling of being back in class. “Well I dunno, his sort-of-fiancée left him, and his parents died, and his friends didn’t want to speak with him…” The mate had picked himself up and married and lived a modest, but happy life, and Edwarde had had his riches, but no one to share them with. “He wound up alone.”
Quaffles were dropped, Bludgers hit shins, Snitches proved elusive. The kids shrieked and giggled and put up a valiant effort, and slowly, slowly, Harry began to register patterns and pick up strengths and weaknesses. Petite little Emma Wyncall, who Harry had set to play Chaser, kept trying to bludgeon the Bludgers with the Quaffle, whenever she had it, so he made a note on the roster to let her play Beater next time. On the other hand, Anthony kept getting distracted by the Golden Snitch whenever it fluttered by, causing him to miss several Bludgers. He fell off his broom, once, but was back on it before Harry could react.
Not the most auspicious start to the morning, but Harry’s insides were a roiling dark sea of mixed emotions. Malfoy had shared quite a lot of himself, lately, and Harry hadn’t answered in kind. No wonder Malfoy didn’t want to come to the pub—no matter that they had a past: they weren’t the same people anymore. Malfoy certainly wasn’t.
Harry discovered a mismatched set of spatulas and stirring spoons in a box with a stuffed animal and a broken lamp. He didn’t recognise the stuffed animal, but it looked old and well loved—Ginny’s? Or did it belong to one of his kids? He set the animal aside, threw out the lamp, and put the cooking utensils in the kitchen. Ginny had already purchased a brand-new set to replace this one, when they hadn’t been able to find it, but Harry liked the blue spoon. They’d picked it out together in a second-hand shop on Direction Alley, the same week Harry had officially moved out from Ron and Hermione’s and in with Ginny and her flat share.
Was this the real Draco Malfoy or had he been replaced with a replica that looked like him, but was otherwise completely unrecognisable?
“Thank you.” Harry looked at the page quickly—the address was in a different Wizarding district in London—and then found a pocket to keep it in. “We’re, ah, here.”
?” Harry asked, unable to hide his incredulity. He fed the phone more coins. “Are you sure you’re my cousin?”
“I cancelled practice,” Harry said, ignoring her question. She didn’t look angry, just confused and Harry realised he must’ve forgotten to duplicate the cancellation note for her. Shit. Another thing he couldn’t do right: avoid the person he actually wanted to avoid. “I forgot to tell you. Sorry.”
Harry went to Draco. “Hey!” He was still bubbling over with happiness and high on victory. “Like the game?”
Draco did the ‘or maybe’ face. “I would have to wonder what that says about me, only I already know it. I think—suspect—that there isn’t any definite proof in the book. I think it’s up to the reader to decide. Do you give her the benefit of the doubt, or do you assume the worst?”
Harry was aware he was staring, so he pulled himself together. Before he could respond to Malfoy’s inquiry, however, Malfoy’s face shuttered.
It was short work to fetch Malfoy his coroner reports and see him installed in the reading hall. The spot below the meadow painting was vacant, so Malfoy chose it for himself again and set to work quietly.
There was no dower house in sight. Harry didn't know much about what kind of house it was, or what they looked like (if they had any particular look at all), or where they were typically situated, but Draco had said they were for a widow to move into once her eldest son inherited the estate, and that she’d usually have a full retinue of servants as well as other family members or friends living with her. That sounded like it’d be a sizeable house, but…there was no other house in sight.
And then Harry didn’t know what to say, or do, so he steered the fizzing bath bomb (half spent by now) towards Draco. The scent of caramel had come out to join the vanilla, along with something woody. The rain hammered against the small window—inspired, Harry turned the light off with a wave of his hand, and with another he summoned two dozen candles from the shelf and set to float in the air. He alighted them with a snap of his fingers and the gloom disappeared, replaced with a warm glow that matched the deep scents of the bath bomb, the heat of the water and the sweetness of the scones.
“No problem,” Emma’s mum said. Wyncall, Harry recalled her name was. Emily Wyncall. “You need an assistant coach.”
“Do you want me to stay?” Draco asked Harry. His hand was on Harry’s arm, squeezing gently. “I’ve brought a book. I can go sit over there,” he indicated an empty chair nearby, “or stay with you. It’s your choice.”
“Nothing really changed,” Harry said. “I just thought it’d be nice. I mean, I don’t always hate it, I just—I thought it’d be nice.” It was easier to talk about it when not looking Draco in the eye, so Harry continued: “I have a lot of complicated feelings about it but right now I’m really happy, and I just want…I feel like maybe I can make you feel what I’m feeling? That sounds stupid, doesn’t it—”
“Right,” Harry said, looking between them. On one level he was genuinely relieved that he and Ginny no longer had to…keep doing what they were doing, but on another there was residual grief and hurt and some feelings he didn’t know how to name. What he did know was that he needed to free himself from Ginny for good. “Right. Er. Gin, can I talk to you for a second?” No time like the present.
Charlie blocked a goal and Harry yelled, next Denise, Dorcas, and Rachel had the Quaffle and shot towards the other end of the pitch, passing it between them and narrowly escaping both Bludgers—and scored. Ten points ahead. Six minutes to go.
“Thank you for coming,” Harry whispered. “I really appreciate it. Dean and Seamus are good folks—I think you’d like them. We should go visit them at the farm sometime.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, and looked at Draco. There was a light in his eyes and a smile on his lips, and Harry’s heart constricted and expanded, until all he could feel was nothing and everything, and at the centre of it all was Draco. There was a future here, promise and potential, and so much love to fill it all up. “When can we start?”
“Er, hello,” Harry said, oddly relieved and disappointed at once not to get Dudley on the phone. “Is Dudley there?”
“I know,” Harry said, not keen to go down this path again. They’d discussed it at length on Wednesday. “It wasn’t technology so much as the people in charge of it, I think. And those kids! I mean…well, if it were magic, it could’ve been us.”
“I do read books,” Malfoy said, as he was folding the new form in two. He did it very carefully, and very neatly, so that the crease lined up perfectly with the column divide in the middle of the form. He didn’t look at Harry as he said it, he was looking at the form, placing it with great care inside the black notebook.
“Oh! Good! Do you want to—” Harry realised he had no idea what he wanted to do. He couldn’t see—or think—past the next few minutes. “Be with me?”
“Oh! Yes—well, depends, I’ve most of my evenings full these days, but I’d love to.” Harry couldn’t help smiling, it’d been a while. Ginny didn’t usually care for babysitting, even if the kids were her nieces and nephews, so Harry usually wound up taking the sits by himself, when Ginny was doing late night practice or overnight stays for games on the Continent.
could have kids.” Harry followed him. Most of the old cow stalls were still in place, but further back there was a more open area and he could see that Draco had put in a large old fashioned wood-burning stove of the kind Harry had only ever seen pictures of in books; it had several latches in front that could open, some of which Harry knew must be ovens and probably one for the fire, and it had a large stovetop for cooking. At least he assumed Draco had put it in—it looked brand new and not like something that usually lived in a barn. Several covered dishes were sitting on the stovetop. “I mean, I always wanted kids—I thought I’d be having them with…well, you know. But we could have kids. We could have a family together.”
Tears welled up in Hugh’s eyes and streamed down his cheeks. Harry dug into the first aid kit for an antiseptic salve and band aids. “Chin up, Hugh,” he said, gently. “Okay. This is going to sting a bit.” He wiped most of Hugh’s tears away with his thumbs, then started applying the salve to the scratches. One looked deep, and Harry thought he’d probably find bits of Hugh’s skin under Betty’s nails if he looked.
When Harry went for his lunch break, Malfoy was still sitting at the desk going through the files. He was still there when Harry came back, showing no signs of having taken a break himself.
“That’s the spirit!” George, sitting on the other side of Percy, bumped his shoulder. “His consolation prize can wait, honestly.” He waggled his eyebrows and Percy rolled his eyes at him, cheeks slightly pink.
. “I—” What exactly could he say? How much was he willing to tell her? “I’m—afraid—” his breath caught in his throat. “—I’ve fucked it all up for good.”
, and Draco had left it alone. Harry had been profoundly grateful, and once home he’d planted his face in Draco’s belly and stayed there for a long time while Draco’s fingers caressed his scalp. They hadn’t talked, but Draco read aloud from the book he was reading, and that was better, it quietened Harry’s brain a little, until all his world consisted of was Draco’s voice, hands, scent, just Draco, Draco, Draco.
The DragonTAMERS were a good team, with skilled fliers and a bigger rota, totalling fourteen players. They’d have an advantage over the Bumpkins, but Harry had faith in his team. They’d forgotten all about Thursday, so caught up in the actual game, and were executing all of Ginny’s game tactics beautifully. “Are you seeing this, Gin?” Harry whooped; Emma and Nathan had effectively tag teamed the Bludgers and sent them all towards the opposite team’s Keeper, exactly the way they’d practised it. “THAT’S HOW IT’S DONE!”
He’d thought a lot about the war, then. About his choices. Both those that led to his sentence and those that hadn’t, all the different ways the war could’ve turned out if he’d only been faster, braver, more cautious, more bold…there’d been a counsellor there, but Harry hadn’t wanted to talk to her at the time. He’d made his peace—he’d taken both his punishment and his accolades, and gone to Pansy’s parties, and put it all behind him.
“In this weather?” Harry blinked. There was outdoors seating connected to the café, overlooking the garden behind the Archive rather than the narrow path leading from Direction Alley to the Square, but nobody used the garden this time of year. “Uhm, sure?”
Draco sipped his tea. Harry pressed a kiss into his hair. “We like our straight friends,” he said. “But sometimes it’s nice to just…”
The last time he’d seen her, really seen her, he’d been pretending to be dead and she’d been lying to Voldemort. Next time he’d see her it might be in a nice sitting room over tea.
“No.” Ginny turned on him. “You can go to the fucking pub if you want to, but I’m going home.” She didn’t wait for him to respond, only slid her wand out of her sleeve, picked up her gear bag, and Disapparated, leaving Harry alone in the foyer of the club.
I’d also written a letter to Sirius about it all. He wasn’t very impressed with me, taking off with Viktor in the middle of the night. I had to return him a promise that I won’t go wandering around at night and that I make sure I keep myself safe. He told me again that my name didn’t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident and that the person responsible is on their last chance of attacking me. He told me to go and practice stunning and disarming spells. And maybe some hexes. His message was clear, focus on the third task and forget all the crazy business with Mr Crouch. He told me again to trust Dumbledore and Professor Moody, and asked me please to not break any more school rules and to keep myself safe.
Quirrell continued his little speech and said it had all been a waste of time from Snape because he was going to kill me that night. He snapped his fingers and ropes sprang out of thin air wrapping themselves tightly around me.
Harry sits back up and bites on his lip. He wonders if he should just tell his little sister. Neville already figured it out. And Harry is pretty sure about it now. There has been a reason why he doesn’t care about all the girls swooning over him. And that’s fine. Only Harry isn’t sure if he wants the entire world to know yet. And telling Iris will make it public knowledge in a matter of days. She’s never been able to keep a secret. Not even when it means she will get in trouble. And Harry wants to be the one to tell his parents. He can’t have Iris beat him to it.
Draco is sure that there should be an easier way for all this. But the other healer from last week assured them that using magic is just too dangerous at this stage of the pregnancy, that the Muggle way is safer and just as efficient. Draco thinks it’s barbaric. The way they shove a plastic rod into his ass so they can make an echo as they call it. But he knows it has to be done, so he lays down on the bed. Harry stands up and takes his hand in his. They look at each other when the healer inserts the rod. Draco can’t stop the tears when he feels the intrusion into his body. He still doesn’t get why he has to go through this again. His baby is already dead, what is the point in torturing him with another scan and the small hope that it was all a mistake and his baby is still alive and healthy.
“I know, sweetheart. I know. It’s all going to be okay. I promise. But I can’t help you. It’s too much for me. You need someone who’s trained for this. You need professional help. And I promise it will work. It helped me to cope with the pain, the losses. It thought me that it wasn’t all my fault, just like all the things you just said weren’t your fault. You didn’t kill any of those people. You never wanted to get addicted, and you didn’t take the potions now. You need to learn that it’s not your fault, none of it is your fault. The only thing you did was try to survive, to keep your mother safe. And you saved me, during the war and after. I know you don’t see it that way, but I don’t think I could have healed the way I did if I hadn’t had you with me every step of the way.”
“Harry, you want us to take you to the hospital wing?” Neville asks. He pushes Harry upright and looks at him with a weak smile. Harry should say something. He should move and go on with his life. Only he doesn’t know if he can.
“I heard they aren’t a couple,” Hermione says. She skips over the fact that she has the hots for Ron. But she thinks that Ron doesn’t feel the same about her, and Ron thinks that he’s not good enough for Hermione and doesn’t want to ruin their friendship. It doesn’t matter how many hints Harry lays out for them, they just won’t confess to each other how they feel.
The rest of December was kind of boring, except for the Yule Ball. Professor Snape told us about it during one of our Potions classes and he held me back afterwards. That was an awkward conversation. It turns out that as a champion I’m supposed to open the ball, and everyone agreed it would be best if I would pick a nice girl that could accompany me for the opening dance. I told him no. You should have seen Professor Snape’s face. I think he was shocked that I point black refused. Blaise joked later that Draco is having a bad influence on me, making me forget all my manners by sucking them out of mine… well, you get the idea. I think we’ll have to practice some more on our silencing charms.
“Keep your voice down,” Harry snaps while he looks around them. Nobody sits close      enough to overhear them, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. “Nobody is to know.”
Hello everyone, just a little note from your author here. I've started a full-time job last week and this will bring down the time I have to write. So updates will probably take a little longer from now on. But don't worry, I've already started reading Goblet of Fire to plot out Harry's next year, so I'm still invested in finishing this mega story. It will just take me a little longer.
Draco blushes and it’s the cutest thing Harry has ever seen. “I didn’t want you to die,” Draco signs.
Harry hates the idea that Pettigrew is still on the loose. It’s been months. James had promised they would have him back in Azkaban in no time at all. And even though James never meant to break that promise, it happened anyway. Harry is angry. His dad is supposed to keep them all safe. That’s why he works for the Auror department. And what does it even mean that they still haven’t found Pettigrew. Are they all incapable of doing their job? Or is Pettigrew that smart that he can stay out of their sight? Did James tell his colleagues that Pettigrew can turn into a rat? Or is he keeping that a secret to protect Uncle Remus?
Draco doesn’t know what to say. He’s happy that they can help out, and he loves Teddy. He’s a fantastic child. And the way Harry is with him, how much it’s brightens Harry’s mood when Teddy is around. It’s worth the pain. Because it hurts more every time Teddy and Harry interact, seeing what an amazing father Harry would be to their children. And every month that passes without Draco getting pregnant is another reminder that it may never happen for them. That they will never be able to make Teddy a big brother.
Ron laughs as he pats Harry on his back. Neville shakes his head and grins. Only Hermione looks behind her to see what Harry was staring at.
I also told Hermione about hearing Malfoy cry the night before. She didn’t know what to think of it either. I just know that he didn’t come out of the dorm all of Sunday and that for the last two days he hasn’t said a word to me. He won’t even look at me, which is weird after all the staring of the last couple of months. And he looks a little pale and doesn’t sit next to Nott anymore, but has started preferring Zabini in class and in the Great Hall. I think Malfoy and Nott might have had a fight about something. It’s frustrating not knowing what about and if it has something to do with me giving Malfoy a black eye. He didn’t get that healed at the hospital wing, which is also strange. I don’t understand why he wants to walk around school with a black eye when it’s not necessary.
Harry takes a better hold of his broom and points it upwards. The Snitch goes into the cloud and Harry follows it. Cold rain slashes against his face, but Harry doesn’t take his eyes off the Snitch. It’s so close. Harry stretches out his arm and speeds up a little more.
Harry raises his wand and shouts Stupefy. Red light flies through the room. Pettigrew jumps out of the way and escapes the spell by inches. Draco looks up from his book. He pushes his chair back which falls to the floor with a loud bang. Pettigrew is on the move. He sprints to the table. He and Draco both reach for Draco’s wand at the same time.
And he keeps talking about how good he is in Quidditch and flying, ever since the notice for our flying lessons was posted on the notice board. He complains all the time that it’s unfair that he’s not allowed his own broom and that he’s not allowed to try out for the Quidditch house team. And don’t get me started about all the stories of how he narrowly escapes helicopters. And after every story he has to remind everyone that I don’t have my own broom and how I’m going to make a fool of myself in front of the Gryffindor’s, shaming the Slytherin house even more.
“Does Draco need Teddy-bear?” Teddy asks. Draco hasn’t heard him come down and into the room. He hopes the boy hasn’t seen much of what just happened. It’s already bad enough that Draco cried in front of him this afternoon without even realising it.
“Do you think that will be enough?” Harry asks. He doubts it will. Who in their right mind will listen to Snape?
“Good to see you again, Malfoy,” Neville says as he stands up and slides down next to Lavender who swoons all over him. Harry will have to thank him later for this sacrifice.
Speaking of Draco, he still isn’t back, so I think I’ll go look for him to tell him what happened during my Deviation exam.
Draco shakes his head. He knows Ron means well, but he doesn’t want anyone to see him like this. It’s already hard enough to see the concern on Harry’s face all the time. He doesn’t think he can manage Ron’s pity next to that.
After some time they get up from the bed and make their way downstairs and start a movie on the television. Draco has no idea what it is about. His mind is blank, and all he can focus on is Harry laying against his chest. When the movie comes to a close, Draco feels sick. His stomach hurts, and he knows it’s starting. The first cramps are manageable and just annoying. But it doesn’t stay that way. Within a half-hour, Draco lays on the sofa with a pillow pushed against his stomach. He screams in pain with every cramp. Harry sits in front of the couch, one hand holds onto Draco’s hand, the other hand keeps sliding Draco’s hair from his face.
Zabini sits down next to Ginny and signs. “You are a fool if you think Draco had anything to do with that engagement. His parents arranged it all, in the hope he will come to his senses.”
Harry takes his time to try to tame his hair. It’s useless, as always. But he’s trying anyway. Malfoy’s hair always looks like he’s just got out of bed, but still stylish. Harry wonders how Malfoy does it. And why his own hair only likes to look like a crows nest. His grandfather was the inventor of an amazing hair potion, so why doesn’t do anything to tame Harry’s hair?
“I don’t know, sweetheart,” Harry answers. “But it can’t be long now. Most of these people came in after us.”
We met up with our friends at the train station and got a compartment that would fit all of us. Hermione, Luna and Daphne talked about girl stuff while we analysed the Quidditch game. Blaise, Greg and Draco all agreed that I would be able to do the Wronski Feint even better than Krum. It was horrible weather outside and I’d curled against Draco’s side, his arm was around me while I looked outside once the conversations had winded down. Blaise and Luna had disappeared, probably off somewhere snogging, Hermione and Draco were both reading the standard book of spells, grade 4, Daphne had the Witch Weekly in front of her and Greg just stared out of the window like me. And then Nott and Crabbe decided to ruin our afternoon by showing up and making sick jokes about me and Draco. They talked about entering something and winning fame and money, but none of us knew what they were on about. Nott went on that Draco most really have lost the grace of his father if he didn’t know. This saddened Draco, he tried not to show it, but I know it still hurts him that his father pretends like he doesn’t exist when he’s at home.
Draco’s father was selling some of his things, saying that it would embarrass him if the Ministry were to call at their place for raids. Mr Borgin didn’t think the Ministry would call on Mr Malfoy. But the man said that Mr Weasley was sure to include him. I don’t think Mr Malfoy and Mr Weasley like each other very much. Well, I’m sure they don’t. They started fighting in Flourish and Blotts, but I’ll get to that later.
And then it happened. A high, cold voice said ‘kill the spare’. The words Avada Kedavra sounded. A green light flashed by me and then Cedric fell to the ground. As he was holding me up I fell with him. I landed on top of his body. I looked into his face and couldn’t believe it. His grey eyes blank and expressionless, his mouth was half-open like he was surprised. He was dead.
“And that’s why he’s here,” Lily says. “You know all your friends are always welcome in our home. Even the ones that give you butterflies.”
It was Dobby who woke me up the next morning. And as soon as I opened my eyes I wished I’d never woken up. I couldn’t feel Draco like I had since that night after the first task. He was gone, truly gone and I was alone. I wanted to die with him. Dobby told me I had to hurry, that I had to go safe master Draco from the merpeople. He gave me some Gillyweed, said it would make me breathe underwater. I tried to explain to Dobby that it didn’t matter anymore, that Draco was already lost. I’d never felt that incomplete in my entire life. I told Dobby to go and let me grieve in peace. But Dobby wouldn’t have it. He said I had to go save master Draco, that I could do it. He pulled me to my feet and dragged me along the corridor until I agreed that I would go to the lake.
“Stay away from us,” Harry begs as the Dementor lets his hand slide just above Draco’s head. Harry cries out as the screams in his head become louder by the second. He needs to concentrate. Get your wand out of your pocket, he orders himself. Only his hands shake and his fingers won’t cooperate. And his mother keeps screaming. Harry’s wand won’t come out of his back pocket. He can’t stop the Dementor.
“Vincent,” Harry answers. Draco swallows and blinks away a tear. It has been years, but the pain of losing Vincent still stings. Just another person that lost their life because of Draco’s misguided actions. If only Draco had been a better friend. Or even better, just let the boy be. All he ever used him for were his muscles. And only when Vincent was gone for good, Draco realised he’d just tried to make Draco proud of him. That all Vincent ever wanted was to be a real friend to Draco.
Thinking of Draco made me think of our fear of Voldemort coming back. Now that the stone is gone he will have to find another way. And headmaster Dumbledore agreed with me that he is still out there somewhere. We had a little talk after that about you, mom. Because Voldemort had said that you had died trying to stop him from killing me and I asked the headmaster if he knew why Voldemort wanted me dead in the first place. Headmaster Dumbledore said he couldn’t tell me why, not now at least. He will tell me when I’m older and ready. I don’t know what that means, but it wouldn’t have helped to argue. The headmaster did tell me why Quirrell couldn’t touch me. It’s because you died to save me, mom.  Your love for me also left a mark on me, an invisible protection in my skin. It had been agony for professor Quirrell to touch a person marked by something so good.
Harry looks at Draco who’s turned back to his homework. He never minds that he can’t follow any of them. He loves the silence. Harry has learnt that by now. But still, it would be great if all their friends would be able to communicate with him without the need for translators or pieces of parchment. But that doesn’t change anything to the fact that Draco will be all alone this Christmas. Harry doesn’t think any Slytherin ever stays over at Hogwarts during Christmas. It will be so depressing. Harry can’t stand it. He has to make sure that Draco has a good Christmas, one he will enjoy.
Afterwards, her head just fell forward onto her chest until it snapped up suddenly. She spoke to me as nothing had happened. It really freaked me out. Did she mean that Sirius Black would rejoin Voldemort tonight and that he will come back? Will he come after me and really kill me this time? I just went back to the dungeon without paying any attention to the people around me. I looked for Draco in the common room, but he wasn’t there. He also isn’t in our dormitory, so that’s why I’m writing to you first. I’m sure he’ll be back soon, and when not I’ll go find him in the owlery. I’m sure he went there to send his letter to his mother.
This Christmas holiday is the best. It’s just me and Draco down here in the dungeons. All the other Slytherins have gone home to their parents for massive dinners and whatnot. Draco told me what Christmas at his house normally looks like. It’s filled with all these stupid traditions and fake cheer. He’s really happy he told his parents he wasn’t coming home this year. I know I should feel bad about the fact that Draco and his father hardly talk any more now he’s with me, but I just can’t. Not after what happened on Christmas afternoon. But I’ll get to that later.
Harry makes it to his office without running into anyone. He pulls off his robes and sits down. He takes one look at the massive pile of paperwork he needs to get through today. The pile never seems to become any smaller. Harry shakes his head and stands back up.
When we (Hermione, Ron, Neville and I) got to Hagrid’s hut all the curtains were closed and Hagrid even asked who it was before he let us in. I asked him about the stone and if he knew what else was guarding it, but Hagrid didn’t know. He only told us, after Hermione flattered him, that some professor’s helped with the guarding. Most of them are fine professors, but Snape was one of them. And I’m still sure he wants to steal the stone. And if he helped with the guarding, he might even know how to get past the other spells and protections in place. But Hagrid promised us that only he and Dumbledore know how to get past Fluffy, so I think the stone is safe for now.
“Shit,” Harry says. “It’s the girlish squad.” He quickly steps forward, in the hope Lavender and Parvati don’t decide to come out and join them.
Malfoy hesitated. “It’s not that I don’t want to come,” he said. “I just…I’ve already bought a ticket.”
Harry froze. There were a lot of things he’d wanted when he was five, but none of them were professions. Alive, his brain helpfully supplied. Anywhere but here. With my parents. “A dentist,” he finally said, latching onto the first Muggle profession he could think of. “Though Little League Quidditch captain is working well for me.”
“I can’t believe you carry around handkerchiefs,” Harry said. “Is it monogrammed? Please tell me it isn’t monogrammed.”
Harry went through the rest of the morning and his lunch break feeling dejected and desperate, tired, panicky, hopeless…cycling through an endless barrage of emotions with every moment that passed without an owl from Draco. By the time Harry turned up at the Archive for his afternoon shift, he was done. Just
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged again. He didn’t say what he was thinking; that he’d needed to keep himself busy and distracted so he wouldn’t have to think about how they were breaking up.
“I love you,” Harry had whispered in Draco’s ear over the din of their mates’ laughter. “I love you,” Harry had said after two hours of browsing the second-hand section, his arms full of books Draco was interested in. “I love you,” Harry had said, untying Draco’s transfigured apron—a blue dish towel with sea shells, this time— and pulling him into a kiss. “I’ll buy you a proper apron for your birthday.” Draco’s cheeks had pinked every time, and he’d given Harry delighted smiles in return.
“Right?” Harry agreed. “It was…I was tired. I was so tired. And after a year of training, I just couldn’t do it anymore. I didn’t want to be a person who fights, you know? I never…I never
Harry left Malfoy to his coroner reports. A flick of his wand and most of the mud on his cloak and shoes was scrubbed off. He put the cloak away and went to see Mildred about cataloguing tasks, since nobody in the study rooms needed him.
“You did choose to fight, though. You could’ve walked away from it all, but you didn’t. Nobody does that just because they have to, not unless it’s because their sense of justice is telling them so,” Draco argued.
Seven children ran onto the pitch, clutching their brooms, and formed a half circle around Oliver. The other team did the same.
Not many had come out this Friday either. Lee was there, as was Angelina (but no George in sight). Hermione and Ron hadn’t come, but Padma and Pansy were there, and Parvati had shown up single again.
“Thank you for finally being honest about it,” she said, sniffling and wiping her face with her palms. “You know, if you’d just said
The bookcase didn’t look any more filled out now, with his meagre collection spread over three different shelves (with three empty shelves still), but it looked nicer, in that way where Harry’s heart was feeling less like an echo chamber and more like a small storage closet.
“Makes you calm?” Malfoy perked up at this. He picked up a bomb from the pile and studied the label. “This is
Harry stopped her, instead escorting her off the pitch. “It’s Anthony’s turn,” he explained, and took the chance to rotate everyone while the game was paused. “And I want the Mediwitch to have a look at you, just in case—”
“What’s the status on the farm?” Harry asked as he joined them. “Got everything sorted yet?” He slid Draco’s tea over, earning a soft thank you in return.
“Thanks.” Harry threw them in with the rest of Alice’s gear. Movement by the edge of the pitch caught his eye and he looked up; Draco was heading over.
Three weekends in a row with no games at all had allowed them to focus on learning new moves and formations and perfecting the ones they already knew, so when they’d faced Hawkins’ Hawks after the break, Harry had on his hands not a team of five and six year olds, but rather…bloodthirsty gremlins. Hawkins’ Hawks had suffered a crushing defeat, and when the following weekend they'd played Just Us, the Butterfly Bumpkins had gone in with all the confidence in the world and had utterly defeated them.
Dean and Seamus were sitting at a large table near the back, Seamus waving to get their attention. Draco had gone all stiff beside Harry, but Harry tugged him gently forwards. This wasn’t the first time they’d met since the war, Harry knew, that wouldn’t be the issue—hopefully. Dean had spent some time in captivity at Malfoy Manor, but neither Dean nor Draco had brought that up to him at any point leading up to this evening.
“Oh,” said Harry. Something in his belly roared up and whispered, tickling his diaphragm. Excitement, and curiosity, and something deeply pleased that Malfoy had thought of him.
“Was that the last box? Oh—thank you, George.” A large cardboard box came floating up the stairs, George following behind it. The box joined the large pile of boxes sitting in the middle of the living room. Ginny gave her brother a kiss on the cheek and ruffled his hair.
Valentine’s Day came around and the kids (and their parents) reported that the cards had been universally adored and thus successful. It’d been rainy all week and Harry was getting really tired of it, between the daycare and Little League practice—though the kids were mostly okay, equipped as they were with cloaks charmed to be toasty warm and waterproof, and happily zipped after Bludgers going at them with bats. Harry usually made a point out of ending every day with a hot bath and a book and had managed to finish one book and had almost finished another, within the week.
“There are spells. And the Muggles make ‘audiobooks’ that you can listen to with special devices. I’ve always wanted to try one of those.” Instead of heading for the counter, Malfoy had led Harry towards the fiction section. They were now standing in front of the Muggle section labelled SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY.
Malfoy sniffed it. “I recognise this scent. You smell like this sometimes.” He looked at the label. “That’s…an eclectic mixture of ingredients. I can’t tell if it’s supposed to be refreshing or relaxing?”
Harry paused as he got the jar of honey for Ginny. The kettle was just starting to boil, and while Harry stood there, trying to will away the pangs in his heart, it got louder. “No,” he eventually said.
“Yeah. Wild house-elves are tricksters. They pop up in Muggle literature, in their myths. They hide things and steal food and can be heard giggling, that sort of stories. In some cultures Muggles leave food out for them on particular holidays. So elves live in Muggle houses too, but they vastly prefer magical homes. Captured elves, that’s…something else. Once you’ve captured an elf, you’ve ruined that elf for the rest of their life.”
“So we can put books in it,” Harry said. “It’ll go over there.” He pointed with the screwdriver at the little wall divide jutting out between the fireplace and the front door. It was just wide enough that he could fit the bookcase there. Harry thought the wall was made for it; the fireplace was awkwardly situated, not quite centred and much closer to the windows on the opposite wall, so the bookcase should balance it out nicely.
! Have fun! Not think about the fucking War or my dead brother or the fact everyone was in prison or doing community service—I just wanted to play Quidditch and have fun and not get serious, and you—you didn’t.”
Harry was sitting in the middle of what looked like an exploded piece of furniture; pieces of wood, screws, and those little circular metal things that go around the screws were strewn around him in a circle. He was assembling a bookcase and had been at it for a while already, unable to wait any longer to get started. Two shelves were already complete and attached to one side of the bookcase to be.
“Do you mean the part about a private research room, or the part about me?” Harry asked, hoping he wasn’t overstepping his bounds. There was professionalism, and then there was…
“It’s an essential part of my personality, Potter.” Malfoy grinned back. “If you want to be friends with me, you’ve got to live with it.”
“We couldn’t wait,” Ron said, beaming. He laced his fingers with Hermione’s and for a second Harry thought they might start making out in the middle of the restaurant.
somewhere. It was entirely absurd to him. And yet, he knew that Draco had turned down his invitation to the pub several times, citing his anxiety, and he’d seen how tense he’d been the evening before when he’d finally come along.
“Why do you always look like you just got off a broom?” Malfoy said in greeting. “The hair is one thing, but the mud?”
“Uhm, not much? They’re slaves to wizards and giving them clothes sets them free?” Harry thought about the decapitated house elves in Grimmauld Place, and Kreacher, and Dobby, and Winky. The Hogwarts elves. “They’re loyal to their masters…and stay with the family? And only the rich wizards have them?”
She didn’t answer that, instead taking in their outfits. “Are you two trying to bring back pointy hats?”
“I should think so.” Harry grinned. “One of the perks of having private study rooms is that they’re untouchable by anyone who doesn’t have authorised access, which means that only the user—you—and the staff here, can enter. So any documents you request up from the strongrooms can stay here for as long as you need them.”
“Sorry,” Harry said automatically, but then his senses caught up with him. “Oh, Malfoy, hi. Were you…leaving?”
“Think about what kind of magic you want your big emotion to be. Like butterflies or flowers or rain. It’s very hard to be scared when one is thinking about butterflies.”
“Maybe.” Malfoy’s eyes slid over every colourful pile in the vicinity and then stopped—Malfoy froze. “Are those shaped like
What was worse than the fact Ginny was breaking up with him, was the fact Harry was irrationally jealous that she could choose to just go home for a break. Harry was stuck in their shared apartment, in the interrupted next stage of their life together, with no parent to talk to.
Harry hoisted his book bag. “Up this way, the store is near the Direction Alley exit.” He glanced at Malfoy’s hand, wondering if he should ask or just casually go for it, but then Malfoy put his hands in his pockets.
Harry bites his lower lip and blinks away the moisture in his eyes. He’d hoped the kids hadn’t notice, but nothing escapes them. Draco has been an emotional mess all pregnancy. It’s worse than the roller coaster of physical and emotional hardship he’d had when he was pregnant with Lily. But Harry had understood that. He’d felt the same fear and been on the same roller coaster. What happened with James was still fresh in their minds and didn’t leave them until Draco was holding Lily in his arms. But it had been better when they had Nathan. Time had helped them heal and Draco was more stable and enjoyed being pregnant. But this time around, he’s been all over the place. Harry wished he knew why. It looks like it’s more than just the hormones, but Draco swears that there isn’t anything else. And maybe he doesn’t even know why this time around it’s taking so much from him to get through his pregnancy.
“Don’t be a fool, Neville,” Hermione says. She doesn’t look up from the paper but skims through the article about Pettigrew.
The pregnant man stands up and waves his hand towards Draco and Harry. “If you think those are faces of people that are happy and expecting, I wonder what you do at the Auror office because if you’re responsible for solving crimes, every criminal will get away with it.”
Draco will be lonely in the Slytherin dungeon. He only has friends in Gryffindor. It’s unfair that he can’t stay with them, just because some stupid hat made him go to Slytherin. Which is a mystery on its own. Draco is more Ravenclaw and Gryffindor than Slytherin. The house doesn’t seem to fit Draco at all. But still, he got sorted into that house.
Draco is here, at Grimmauld Place. Officially he’s staying with his aunt and uncle, the Tonks. You remember, they were the once that took me in before third year started and I had run away from the Dursleys. His mother had arranged it all, to make sure Draco is safe. Mr and Mrs Tonks were at the train station, only Draco refused to go with them. He wouldn’t leave me, so he came home with me. He’s still here. I think he’s scared that if he loses sight of me, something bad will happen again.
That Saturday was a Hogsmeade day, and Draco and I joined our friends on the walk there. It was really funny when we passed the Durmstrang ship. Victor Krum appeared on the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. We all stopped and watched as he dived into the lake. Greg mentioned that Krum most be mad for jumping into freezing water. And Draco responded with ‘but also good looking mad’.  We all laughed at Greg who just shook his head complaining he should find straight friends, that everyone was betraying him. After which Hermione and Daphne pointed out that they were straight. Greg corrected them and told them he needed straight male friends. That the gays and bi’s are taking the overhand. Blaise said he shouldn’t be worried, that he would still drool over girls with him. And Luna agreed she would too.
“I wasn’t talking to you,” Harry answers. “Now go and run back to our bags and get me some parchment and a quill.”
And I still have to work with him during potions. Well, he still does all the work and I just make notes. And somehow that’s better than the other classes because during potions he’s not making my life miserable. I wish Nott and Crabbe would also get the memo that says I should be left alone during potions. But they still manage to point out I’m a horrible wizard, not capable of doing my own potion because I would make poison instead of potions.
James laughs and Harry just shakes his head. Sometimes he hates his dad, no matter how cool and great he is, he’s a tease.
Oh, Ron is fine by the way. Hermione was able to bring him around and bring him to the hospital wing that night. They ran into the headmaster in the entrance hall and said that he had already known that I was down the trap door. That upset Draco. He said that it was terribly irresponsible from the idiot to let me go down there, I could have been killed. But I think the headmaster is a funny man, and that he wanted to give me a chance to face Voldemort. I’m sure by now that he even made sure I found out how the mirror worked so I would be prepared. That didn’t change Draco’s mind about the headmaster, he still thinks the man is off his rocker.
We took a place in the stands and Ron and Neville brought binoculars so we could see even better. Lee Jordan, a friend of Ron’s brothers was giving commentary for the match and it was clear that he wanted Gryffindor to win. It was a very exciting game and my friends around me cheered when Gryffindor score the first goal. I pretended to be outraged about this and we had a good laugh. Hagrid came to join us and he asked me how I was doing. I told him I was good. I didn’t mention that the bullying is still going on and all the others were too involved in the game to tell Hagrid otherwise. Gryffindor got a penalty and scored again. Dean started shouting that they should hand out a red card, making me and Hermione laugh. Ron, Neville and Seamus didn’t understand which made it even more amusing. And when Slytherin scored I cheered for my team. Ron tried to muffle my screams by placing his hand over my mouth, but I just batted it away. It was good fun. Slytherin scored five more times after that and Ron and Seamus were getting upset that I was still cheering them on. But in the end, the Gryffindor Seeker caught the Snitch and Gryffindor won by one hundred and seventy to sixty.
The first day there I helped Ron, Fred and George de-gnome the garden. It was really fun. We had to pick up the gnomes and spin them around in the air before you fly them over the hedge. Fred and George made it into a game to see who could fly them the farthest away. Gnomes look really funny by the way. They are small and leathery looking and have a head that looks like a potato.
“Yes, I was wondering, what is up with that?” Ginny asks. She lays her head on Harry’s shoulder. “Why are you suddenly friends with crazy Malfoy?”
Snape made all of us stop with a simple Finite Incantatem and I could see Ron apologise to Neville for whatever his broken wand had done. Hermione and Millicent looked like they were fine. Only Draco looked worried at Nott like he was afraid Nott had read more in him working with me that there was. And this was the moment that Professor Lockhart decided that it was time for a volunteer pair to teach us all a blocking spell. And of course, Professor Snape volunteered Draco and I. Professor Lockhart showed me some complicated sort of wiggling action before he dropped his wand, expecting me to now know what to do. Meanwhile, Draco was almost fighting with Professor Snape, and when the professor told him he should, Draco just ran out of the Great Hall. I think he was crying and I wanted to follow him, but Professor Snape had already found a replacement for Draco and now I was facing Theo Nott.
Harry draws a breath and then releases it slowly. “The rat traps are stupid,” he says. “They don’t seem to do anything.”
So, when Harry returns from the first Quidditch practice of the year that weekend, he sits down next to his friends during lunch and right away breaches the issue called Malfoy.
“You looking at her,” the man said. His hand pointed to the bones on the floor and Draco understood. The potion had killed her, leaving nothing but her bones behind.
“Yeah,” Harry says. He hangs back on his chair. “Now that Hufflepuff has beaten Slytherin, we have a chance of winning the cup again. Wood wants to analyse the Hufflepuffs game, to see how we can beat them.”
We walked on in silence again after that. The path became almost impossible to follow and the blood seemed to be getting thicker. And when we reached a clearing I could see something bright white gleaming on the ground. We inched closer and saw that it was the unicorn. It was already dead, but it was still beautiful. I took a step toward it and then we heard the slithering sound again. We both froze on the spot and looked to the spot where the sound had come from. A hooded figure came crawling across the ground and started to drink the unicorn’s blood. Draco screamed, it was a terrible sound and I turned quickly to look at him. He was as white as a ghost and he reached out his arm to grab my hand and started pulling me away from the clearing. Before we started running I looked back and saw that the hooded figure had raised its head and was looking right at me. A horrible pain pierced my head then like my scar was on fire. I staggered a little until Draco pulled on my hand, making me turn back to him and we ran.
Professor Snape dragged us to the headmaster’s office when Draco told him that I had a dream again that hurt my scar. (it was funny to hear that the password for the headmaster’s office is Cockroach Cluster). When we reached the big oak door we could hear voices on the other side. The headmaster was having a conversation with the minister of Magic and Professor Moody. Snape shook his head and motioned to us to be quiet. It was a bit strange, listening in on a conversation because Professor Snape wanted to eavesdrop.
And so, the plan is formed. It’s not enough, Harry knows this, but it’s a start. And once Malfoy realises that he needs Harry’s help, Harry can start and teach him how to communicate with others. They’ll become friends and Malfoy won’t be lonely anymore. Harry lays down in the grass and stares at the blue sky. Maybe this year is not going to suck after all.
Just as I started walking someone stepped through the gates. I looked around and saw Draco’s mother Narcissa standing with her arms folded around her. She was wearing a long black jacket and a purple scarf. She asked me if I was leafing already and pointed out that Draco would be very disappointed when he would hear I didn’t even stay to say hello in the morning. I couldn’t help myself, I started crying again at that point. All the tension and fear leaping out of me at once. Draco’s mother was very kind, she hugged me and told me it was all going to be okay. She guided me through the gates, it was very weird, they didn’t open at all, just turned into some black smoke and were back being a solid gate once we passed it. The rest of the driveway was shielded by the large hedge all the way up to the house. It was dark, so I couldn’t see it properly, but I knew it was larger than any house I’ve ever seen before. I hope I get to see it a bit better later today, but for now, I’m stuck in Draco’s wing to make sure that his father doesn’t see me.
I screamed at the professor to turn him back, but the professor just asked me if Draco got me. I didn’t understand and stated again that he should turn Draco back to himself. Draco, as a ferret, ran towards me and I knelt down to pick him up, but the professor pointed his wand at Draco again and he flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor and then bounced upward once more. I screamed for the professor to stop, to leave Draco alone, that he didn’t do anything, that it was just a silly fight, that I love him and that Draco didn’t try to attack me. Only the professor didn’t seem to hear me and just made Draco bounce higher and higher. He was squealing in pain and I didn’t know what to do to stop the professor from hurting Draco.
Lupin came barging into the hospital wing than. He rushed to Sirius to check on him. And maybe there is still hope for them if Professor Lupin is so worried about Sirius. I truly hope so for Sirius. I know he would nothing more than to have Lupin back in the way they were before that faithful Halloween night.
I hope others will start listing to him soon because I hate how everyone looks at me like I’m some dangerous person.
S.P.E.W. is the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, an organisation Hermione has started this year. She told us all about it during our first joined homework session in the Great Hall on Saturday. She explained to us that Elf enslavement goes back centuries and that the short term aims of the organisation are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. The long term aims are to change the law about non-wand use and getting an elf into the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. It cost two sickles to join and until now I think Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna and I are the only members. And Ron only joined because he wants to get back together with Hermione, Neville joined because he’s Ron’s best friend and I joined because Hermione is mine. Only Luna has joined because she thinks it’s a good idea. None of the Slytherins want to join in, saying that he elves like to do their jobs and that they are treated fairly. Hermione is upset about it, but I told her that it’s just that they are used to have elves serve them, that it is how they’ve grown up. I said that maybe over time they would see that they deserve better treatment, but that we have to educate them first.
Pettigrew doesn’t seem to notice that Harry is moving, so Harry risks another step. His eyes stay fixed on Pettigrew’s hand. Draco’s wand inside it, pointing at Draco’s throat. Harry can’t see his eyes, but he doesn’t miss the tears that drip from Draco’s chin.
“You already said that, mate,” Ron says. “Just spit it out.” The game in front of them is forgotten. Both Ron and Neville stare at Harry.
So observe we did. The memory was in a room filled with witches and wizards. In the middle was a chair with chains and everyone was looking at the door in the corner. After some time a man was brought in through the door, accompanied by two Dementors. I shivered and Draco took my hand. He whispered in my ear that they weren’t real, only a part of the memory.
“You’re sure?” Remus asks. He still won’t let go of Harry. Maybe he’s afraid that if he lets go, that Harry will run off after Pettigrew.
Hermione was more helpful. She had researched the subject and had given Harry some advice on what to try. The most difficult part was that Draco wouldn’t be able to utter the spell to make the broom hover. From there on no words would be necessary. Harry never uses words to control his broom, it’s all movement and instinct. Maybe Harry should have asked Professor Flitwick about non-verbal spells, like the ones Flitwick tries to teach Draco in their private lessons. Draco doesn’t talk about those, but he does practice. Harry hates how frustrated Draco gets, as they never seem to pan out. Draco hasn’t managed to cast a single spell. It’s a bad omen for today’s efforts, but Harry will get Draco in the air. Even if it means sharing a broom. Draco will fly today.
It was time to sleep after that and I was happy to see that Draco was also back in our dormitory and we could slip into my bed together. The next morning I woke with his arms around me and the news we would have a feast that afternoon to celebrate the end of the terror at Hogwarts.
I asked Dobby if there were any letters from Draco, but he wouldn’t tell me. He said I could have my letters if I promised not to go back to Hogwarts. But I told him no and that he should give me my letters. And then everything went wrong.
“I know you’re upset still about Draco,” Neville says when they walk beside the water. “And that it’s hard for you to study without him, but Hermione’s right.”
The morning of the 1st of September started really good. I woke up wrapped in Draco’s arms. We kissed some until Dora banged at our door telling us that we had 5 minutes till breakfast. We hurried to get dressed for the day, eat breakfast and hurried to the floo with our suitcases. Hedwig was being difficult, she didn’t want to go into her cage until Draco promised her that we give her treats every hour on the train. We use the floo to go to a special room at King Cross for wizard families to arrive by floo to catch the train.
“It’s going to be a good summer,” Ginny says. “With the Quidditch World Cup. I wish we could get tickets for the final. It’s in England this year.”
A book slams closed in front of Harry. Harry looks up and sees Malfoy stare at him. His lips flatten as he holds his chin high. With force, Malfoy tears a piece of parchment off the bottom of his essay. He picks up his quill and starts to write. Harry follows the movement of Malfoy’s hand with a soft smile on his face.
But me losing points didn’t go well with my Slytherin classmates. They shoved me into the wall when we were walking to our next class. Malfoy said that he would hex me in my sleep if I manage to lose even more points for our house.
“I won’t,” Harry says. He shuffles his foot over the dirt path. “I’ll manage. Exams are still a couple of weeks away.” He has no idea how he will manage it. He can’t open a book without missing Draco. But he also knows his friends are right. If he doesn’t get his act together, he might need to repeat third year. And it will also mean he will have to stop Quidditch. Students with failing grades are not allowed on the team. And that will put a big dumper in his plan to become a professional Quidditch player after he’s done with school.
Harry wrings his hands together and he sits up a little straighter. “What I wanted to say is, that, well… there is something you should all know.”
“Shut up, Hermione,” Neville says. “You don’t know half of it. That man is clever. He’s escaped Azkaban, he’s not going to get caught that easily.”
“You found something more important than beating Slytherin with Quidditch. You can’t be the real Harry,” Ron explains. Neville laughs and then looks the other way when Harry gives him an angry stare.
Harry wanders around the castle for a long time. The moon is out tonight and lights up the corridors. Harry looks out one of the windows and spots the Quidditch pitch. He sits down on the ledge and stares into the distance. Soft tears fall from his eyes. He wipes them away with the back of his hand. He should be done with crying about Draco Malfoy. He’s only thirteen years old. There will be other boys. Boys that will fancy him back and won’t drop him as if their friendship meant nothing the moment they find out that Harry is gay.
“Of course you can. She’s just a baby who wants to meet her uncle Draco,” Hermione tells him. Draco looks at Harry on the other side of the bed. He hopes he’ll take Rose instead. Draco doesn’t know if he can keep the fake smile on his face in place if he has to hold the little one.
After the feast, we had a snowball fight on the grounds and then the Weasleys took me to the Gryffindor common room. The fat lady did protest a little on letting me in, but she caved after some flattery of the twins. The Gryffindor common room is very cosy filled with squashy armchairs. It is decorated in the colours red and gold and on top of the fireplace mantle is a portrait of a lion. The room has a lot of windows that look out onto the grounds of the school. Ron and I set by the fire and I broke in my new chess set by losing to Ron. His brother Percy tried to help me, but I don’t think he’s as good as he thinks.
“Harry, do you know what will happen if you lift your wand too high when casting the Freezing Charm           Glacius?” Ron asks.
Not long after that, a house-elf pops up with some dinner for Harry and James takes his leave, saying he should check in on Iris and Neville and then report back to the big boss (aka mum). He hugs Harry one more time and then he’s off, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts.
The next morning Zabini and Malfoy waited for me before they walked to the Great Hall for breakfast. Hermione gave them a friendly smile before she took my arm and escorted me to the Gryffindor table to eat with them. And either Ron, Neville, Seamus, Dean, Fred or George walk with me through the hallways. And then at the end of the day, Zabini and Malfoy come to take me back down to the dungeon. And it looks like Malfoy is hardly sleeping at night. He has dark circles underneath his eyes and he starts drifting off in class more every day. I think he stays awake at night just to make sure Nott and Crabbe don’t hurt me again.
Again the word guilty rolls of Harry’s tongue. She deserved it. Draco trusted her. Was happy when she reached out to him. But she betrayed him.
Harry turns towards him and places a kiss on Draco’s cheek. “You go do that, while I go find out what kind of beer Bill has brought for us this year.” Then he’s off after Teddy, into the den filled with Weasleys. Draco is glad he can put it off for a little longer and walks into the kitchen. Molly is busy at the stove, preparing the final parts of their dinner. Pansy sits at the table with Vincent on her lap. The boy reaches out for Draco even before he can say hello.
“Fine, I won’t say another word,” Hermione says. She stands up and drops the newspaper on Harry’s books. “You’re such a prat ever since Draco dumped your arse.”
“I,” Draco starts. His eyes go wide. Harry hurries to reach him. Draco shudders and then the tears begin to roll. Harry takes hold of Draco and holds him close. With one swift movement, he apparates them away. He lets the darkness take them home. As soon as they land, Draco moves out of his arms and walks up the stairs. Harry follows him into their bedroom and lays down on the bed next to Draco. Only Draco turns away from him and doesn’t say a word. Harry kisses the back of his head and lets him be. Draco isn’t going to tell him what happened. Harry gets up and walks out of the room. He pulls his phone from his pocket and dials Hermione’s number.
Although, secretly, he deflates a bit inside. He had been getting his hopes up, however stupid that may be.
“Sorry, Harry. Ronald is just being a brute, as usual,” Hermione says but smiles amusedly as a peace offering. The Hippogriff-shaped light twinkles above her, gliding over their heads gracefully. He hadn’t realised at first, but they sometimes move in accordance to the mood of the room. Tonight the lights all seem to be glowing a tender gold, and they slowly sail above them with ease. Over Susan Bones’ ginger head, the Unicorn neighs and gallops in circles as she throws her head back in laughter.
They search around for some free seats and Ron heads over to the bar. Fortunately, they manage to find a booth in a backroom, where the crowds of people are less hectic. Rather than numerous groups of young adults, drunk and booming, they are greeted by what appears to be a knitting group and some elderly men playing a card game. Harry breathes a little easier. From the corner, a lone wizard with hair so untamed it looks like it wrestled a bear- and lost- smiles at him and he returns the gesture.
Although, even as he thinks that, he distinguishes a feeling in his gut that says it isn't what he wants, or can do. Vastly losing every bit of the faint grip he has left on himself, Harry cannot fathom up a single logistical reason for Malfoy to not move. It would make sense. In theory, his transfer would be the best thing for them all. But his gut says
“Uhm..” Not a strong start. “I don’t suppose you’ve, uh, lost any papers recently, have you?” says Harry, deciding he may as well poke the fire, and not daring to take the time to regret his decisions, follows it up with, “Notes or anything of the sort?”
Harry doesn’t reply, not finding anything that will excuse him of his creepy behaviour. His feet are both pointed inwards, and his shoes have a hole in them.
Upon the departure of Ron, Hermione and Ginny for the Burrow, Harry finds himself at a loss. They had offered, even begged, him to come with them but one thought of Molly’s tears had made him firmly decline, despite feeling ashamed to do so. Ron had shrugged despondently and then they had left him, standing alone on the pavement, walking away with their arms wound around each other.
Later, Harry is tucked up in bed, and by tucked, he means constrained. The duvet feels confining and restrictive, and he cannot settle down. When he came in here, Justin was already in bed. It was a great relief, because it would have been just like the boy, warmhearted as he is, to want to try and talk it out. Whatever declaration, apology or grand moment of judgement he has for Harry can wait. Anthony is snoring loud enough to challenge an airplane, and the pillow wrapped around his ears is doing nothing to ease the thunderous sound, despite how tightly it is pressed into his head.
He follows it, and try as he might, he cannot completely settle. There is still a tentative stillness in the air, a pressure that suffocates him. And of course, Harry himself continuously proves to be an issue.
“Hey.” He says, like a clown, in a moment of panic. May as well be civil. It is better than the alternative, and maybe Mcgonagall will be pleased enough to let him switch dorms.
“Four AM,” retorts Harry smartly, and Malfoy’s top lip twitches and quivers. Harry could be wrong here, but it looks like he is fighting amusement. It is a rather odd gesture on someone who still has the air of a spooked lamb. He wants to ask whether Malfoy is actually changing rooms, but practises restraint.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asks, desperate to know but the words tasting wrong on his tongue either way.
He circles cautiously, making sure he has checked over everything. No stone can be left unturned. The hair on the back of his neck prickles, his hands shaking, though he pretends they are not. There is no time to panic.
He roams for hours, he thinks, just going nowhere. Once he starts, he finds he cannot stop. It is at times like this that he realises how expansive Hogwarts actually is. For most of his time at school, it appeared to him as just the Gryffindor Tower, the Quidditch Pitch and the Great Hall. Lessons are lessons, of course, but these three things defined the castle in his mind. Now he acknowledges just how wrong he was. With the halls void of life and the corridors silent, bar the tread of his feet, Hogwarts seems almost limitless. Indeed, he wouldn’t be surprised if it was; if the castle is recognising his need to keep moving, and is just pulling random rooms and passageways out of thin air. The longer he walks, the more weight drops off of his body. Obviously, he is tired- fucking knackered, in fact- but this only serves to power him on, determined to leave the stress of the dorm room behind him.
“I can imagine.” he snorts, “I didn’t realise that Luna was the type to, you know, come to your games. I mean I know she used to watch all of the Hogwarts ones but I thought that was only because everyone did, back then. House pride, and all that.” and he chuckles at the memory of her lion hat, because Luna supported all the houses, not just her own. “But then I guess Luna wouldn’t be the one to do something she didn’t want to just because others were.” Harry loves that about her, erratic as she is.
“You get tonight at a push.” and she nuzzles into the crook of his arm, wound around her. Seeing their love for each other loosens the knot inside of Harry a little, but an ache of loneliness chimes up in replacement.
Harry trudges to the toilet to relieve himself and catches himself with displeasure in the mirror as he does so. Annoyed, he wiggles his eyebrows just to check that the figure staring back at him is not an impostor. He has gotten skinnier over the summer and his skin has an unattractive pale sheen to it, as if he is unwell. At least that would easily explain away to any questioning eyes why, in these past months, he has barely seen the outside of his room.
She has papers strewn everywhere on the desk, and he has no clue what she is even working on. From the looks of it, it has transcended homework and has perhaps entered another realm completely. Rooming with Ravenclaws has been good for her in a lot of aspects, Harry knows; they provide her with the intellectual discussion that he and Ron have never been able to give to her. However, as he eyes the obscene spread of work, he has to admit he feels a little afraid. It looks like it could eat him alive; Hermione looks like she already has been.
In a desperate and admittedly deplorable last shot, he throws himself in front of Malfoy, stopping him in his tracks. Malfoy halts and merely looks a bit peeved at Harry’s presence. Harry on the other hand, feels wildly unstable, like he could say anything.
“I see,” she says, concerned. As she scans Malfoy’s sapless form, she seems to come to a conclusion. “I don’t want to risk moving him until Poppy has arrived. It could do more harm than good in his fragile state. Whatever that abhorrent substance was, I removed the majority of it, but there is no telling what havoc it has already managed to wreak on his body.” Harry nods in agreement and she stands up abruptly.
“Welcome. Don’t worry, I’m not expecting you to return the compliment.” She smiles and moves to a cross-legged position opposite him. Grabbing a bunch of daisies from around her, she starts creating a chain out of the flowers.
than receive Harry’s help. Suddenly, coming here seems more ridiculous than what he first thought- it wasn’t just a reckless move, it was a bad one.
Certainty smacks him in the head. The potion requires Pensieve memories. It is so plainly obvious, Harry feels like a dunce for not figuring it out earlier. Merlin, he always knew he wasn’t the brightest, but now he wholly understands what Hermione means when she says him and Ron weren’t “destined for Ravenclaw” in that tone of hers.
‘And you can teach me to talk with my hands?’ Malfoy writes. He bites on his bottom lip as he waits for Harry to answer him.
Harry, Neville, Ron and Hermione sit in the Great Hall. Study books have been pulled out after breakfast and they all try to finish their homework as quickly as possible. It’s a beautiful day today, and they all want to enjoy the sun and go outside. Nobody looks up when Draco slips in between Harry and Neville. Nobody, except Harry. Their eyes lock for a second. They smile. And then they both focus on their work, all set up on getting it over with as soon as possible. When lunch starts, they are all about done with all the work.
What do I do now? Should I tell him in a letter, or wait till I see him again? Oh, and I hope it’s okay that I like a boy. I think you two would be okay with it, but I can’t really know. I’m sure uncle Vernon and aunt Petunia will be horrified by the idea of me being a poof.
“You need a proper distraction,” Neville says. “We need to get more serious about Pettigrew. That will keep your mind off Draco. And when you’ve forgotten about him, you’ll have no problem cramming for the exams.”
Fourth-year starts with the Quidditch World Cup and the disappointment of no Quidditch at Hogwarts this year. But it brings the Triwizard Cup, where Harry somehow turns into one of the champions. How will he and Draco deal with all the attention it puts on them? And how long can Sirius sit back and let all this happen to Harry?
“Very careful,” Lily says as Nathan lifts his hand to place it next to his sister. “We don’t want to wake daddy.” Lily takes Nathan’s arm and makes sure the little boy doesn’t smash it onto Draco’s belly. They stand for a second and then Nathan giggles.
The next thing I remember is waking up when the train was moving again. The lanterns had come back on and I lay on the seat. Draco was knelt next to the seat, his hand brushing through my hair. I felt really sick and was glad I was laying down. Draco asked me if I was alright and I told him I was fine. I asked what happened and what that thing was. And finally, I asked who screamed. Draco told me that nobody screamed. I stuttered that I heard someone screaming. Draco looked at me with his worried face and kept petting my hair.
“Well, she’s gone now,” Ron says. He grins and leans over the table. “So how do we find Pettigrew?” he asks.
The Dark Lord smiles. “That is good news,” he says. His eyes find Draco again. “There is only one thing that needs to be done before we can siege control. One more enemy that needs to be eliminated.”
Moments later Hermione opens the compartment door. “I’ve got the parchment,” she says before she sits down next to Malfoy like it’s the most normal thing in the world.
It seemed like seconds had only passed when we reached the stretch of wall that was the entrance of our common room. Draco waved his wand and once we stepped in, we were greeted by our housemates. Most of them were cheering and applauding. Miles asked me how I did it and Warrington clapped me on the shoulder, saying he wasn’t that upset about not being a champion knowing there was another skilled Slytherin competing. They had food and were ready to party. Nobody believed I didn’t put my own name in and nobody noticed that I didn’t feel like celebrating. Nobody except Draco, who forcefully pulled me down to the dormitories after a short while.
Once they had passed I took in the room that I was hiding in. It was an unused classroom with a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling and an ornate gold frame. And when I looked into it, I could see myself even though I was wearing the invisibility cloak, and there you were, standing right beside me. I checked the room, but I was alone, but you were there in the mirror. I had never seen a picture of you, so I didn’t recognize you straight away, but when I realized who you where I cried. Mom, you were so beautiful, wild dark red hair and the same eyes as mine. And you cried with me. And dad, you look so much like me. I know people keep saying it to me who much I look like you, but I didn’t know they were right. And there were more people in the mirror, all looking a little like me, all of our family. And you all smiled and waved at me. I wanted to reach through the glass and reach all of you, be with all of you. I stood there for a long time until I heard some noise in the distance and made my way back to the Slytherin dungeon.
“You don’t have to lie and say it’s different, or all in my head,” Harry says. “I know he doesn’t want me. It’s just hard to forget.” He pushes his hair out of his face. “And it fucking hurts.”
But on the train, he was fast asleep and that was good enough for us. Draco pushed me on the other seat and knelt on my lap before his lip found mine. We kissed for a long time. It’s like the world disappears around us when his lips are on mine. It’s the best feeling in the world. We didn’t notice the train slowing down or stopping at all. When we met up with the others again they told us how they fell over each other when the train suddenly stopped and how scared the ladies were when the lights went out. We only noticed that something was wrong when Professor Lupin asked who was there. I opened my eyes and noticed it was all dark around us. Draco wondered out loud if we had been snugging all the way to Hogwarts. Professor Lupin snickered and told him we hadn’t arrived but had made a sudden stop along the way. Draco hid his face in the crook of my neck and I petted his hair. I’m sure his face was just as red as mine, being caught by a teacher snugging is not something you want to do.
Black said that he should have known I would come after my friend, that my father would do the same for him. It made me so angry, hearing him talk about you, dad. And for the first time in my life I wanted my wand back so I could attack, could kill him. I moved forward but was stopped by Draco. Draco stepped in front of me and told Black that if he wanted to kill me he had to kill him first. Black started laughing loudly. Draco shouted at him, asked him if he didn’t hear him. Black calmed down a bit and in a quiet voice he said that there would only be one murder tonight.
I haven’t told Ron or his brothers that I’m bent. They still joke about the fact that Ginny likes me so much and that she’s acting all shy around me since she normally very chatty. I feel kind of bad about not correcting them when they joke I could marry into their family one-day thanks to Ginny. And that it is not their sister that gives me butterflies, but that thinking of Draco makes me feel that way. I don’t know if they will understand or if they would start treating me differently if they know. And I like that they are all so nice to me right now.
The flying lesson is thought by Madam Hooch. She has yellow eyes like a hawk. We had to go stand next to a broom and hold out our hand above the broom and say up. My broom jumped into my hand at once, I and Malfoy were the only ones that managed that. Madam Hooch gave me a friendly smile and I felt proud of myself. Next, we got to mount the brooms and Malfoy got told that he was holding his broom wrong. He complained about that to Nott, saying that Hoochy had no idea what she was talking about.
But, like I was saying, I was just flying around, spinning upside down and enjoying myself when Malfoy started staring at me. And he didn’t stop. He just kept staring at me all day. And when he was lying in bed he didn’t close his curtains all the way, so he could still stare at me. I closed mine as soon as I was ready for bed. Ever since then, he stares at me a lot, but only when the others aren’t around or aren’t looking at us. I don’t know what to think of it. It isn’t like anything else changed. He still makes fun of my inabilities whenever he gets a change and still insists on sitting next to me in most of our classes so he can bump his arm against mine when we’re taking notes.
“It’s a small home. You might be able to,” Draco answers. Teddy nods in conformation and picks up a bright green crayon. He starts outlining a house with his tongue stuck between his lips. Draco looks away, out of the window. The neighbour's house has a garland in front of the window. Draco spotted it this morning, just before he was supposed to go to work. He ended up staying at home. He called in sick and cried half the day away. The garland is still there now, the words a sting into Draco’s heart. It’s a girl, is all it says. And Draco knows it’s insane, but he wants to grab a rock from the garden and smash the window and destroy the garland.
The Dementor doesn’t pay any attention to Harry. And Harry can’t do anything to stop it. He can only watch as Malfoy’s face is lifted off his legs and held by the Dementor.
Harry stares at Draco. At his soft smile. His grey eyes and blond hair. He’s so beautiful. And so strong and brave for facing all his struggles alone for so long. Harry never wants Draco to be alone again.
“Or expelled,” Ron whispers. Hermione gives him a dark look and then shakes her head. She picks up her coffee and snatches the Daily Prophet out of Neville’s hands. “Let’s see what other news there is today,” she says as she opens the paper and starts to scan the headlines.
That was the end of our conversation and Draco and I left to go get dinner at the great hall. Everyone wanted to know if I was fine, as they all had heard I had fallen down screaming during Divination. I told them all that I was fine and we agreed to meet up later at a private spot to discuss what had happened.
After we exchanged our gifts we took a look at the pile of gifts at the end of my bed. Draco had some books about proper behaviour and the importance of pure bloodlines from his father. Like that will make him less gay and less in love with me. Draco didn’t even bother to open them, he just threw them into his trunk. His mother’s gift was better, she had sent him loads of chocolates with a note that he should share them with me.
“Bloody hell, Harry. Don’t tell me you’ve been staring at Cedric and Cho all evening. I’m sorry, mate, but I don’t think your evil eye is going to make them split up,” Ron says.
Draco was sitting next to my bed holding my hand when I woke up after I cut my wrist. He’d been crying, out in the open where other people could see because of me. He is the one that found me that night. If he hadn’t woke up and needed to use the bathroom I would have died. He hasn’t let me out of his side since. I can’t even go shower without him following me to the bathroom. I think he’s scared I’ll try again, even though I promised him I wouldn’t. And he feels guilty about ignoring me for so long this year. He told me what his father had made him promise and how hard it had been for him. He thinks he should have been braver and that he should have told his father he won’t, no matter what, because he loves me. He loves me, mom. Draco loves me.
Teddy runs back into the room with his Teddy-bear in his hands. He climbs on the sofa, pulls off his shoes and pushes his feet underneath Draco’s blanket. His little toes tickle Draco’s feet, and he smiles.
Harry laughs. He never thought about it like that. But yes, he will be part of a minority when he comes out. And Hermione does love to stand up for good causes when it comes to minority groups. “I should tell them,” he says. “But not now. I just want to have a fun day out.”
“He’s great. He started primary school this year and he loves it. I can’t believe he’s already five. And he’s growing. He’ll be taller than me before he even goes to Hogwarts if he keeps growing the way he does now,” Malfoy says as he sits down. “Now, where is my coffee?”
The afternoon goes on. Harry puts away his Snitch at one point and drifts off a little. Ron is already snoring. Hermione flips page after page in her book and Neville’s pencil scratches over his paper. The sun is warm and Harry feels good. It’s been a while since he felt normal. His heart still aches when he thinks of Draco, but it’s slowly healing. Maybe this summer isn’t going to suck after all. Harry will enjoy the good weather, the beach, and hopefully a couple of weeks at the Burrow, practising Quidditch with Ron and Ginny. It will be nice to have Ron join Harry during Quidditch practice. The others are great, but they are all older and still treat Harry as the baby of the team. Not that Ron joining will change that. Ron is older, and about eight inches taller by now. If he keeps growing as he’s done this year, Harry will soon need a step to be able to look him straight in the eyes.
Harry can’t help but grin at that. They both know that Harry is more like James than either of them will ever admit.
“Come on, Harry. We need to speak tactics,” Oliver says. “Your brother won’t die if he has to go see your uncle alone. But you will die if you are late for Quidditch practise again.”
“I’m sorry, I will stop,” Malfoy says. He looks down at his empty plate. “I just thought, but I’m sorry, it won’t happen again.”
Draco smiled and looked back at the potion. He would have loved to have seen how the potion works. For a moment he was tempted to get a spoon and feed it to the man in the cell. But then his father and mother would know he’d been down into the forbidden rooms. Draco let it be and made sure he would follow his father down when he would continue his work.
Harry nods, forgetting that Ron can't see him. He wants to believe Ron, wants him to be right. But the empty look on Draco's face, his pale complexion, and the way he's distancing himself from everyone, even Harry. It's so similar to sixth year, the year Draco started to abuse potions, it scares Harry.
Harry’s hands slide around Draco’s waist and he pulls him closer. Draco can’t stop himself from pushing his own hands into Harry’s hair, in a completely different way then he’s done before. Today it’s not to comfort or just to be close. Today a need to taste Harry and consume him takes over Draco’s actions.
And then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods, and at once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to the field. We made our way to the stadium and up to the top box all the way at top of the stairs. The top box was at the highest point of the stadium situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts. Sirius made sure we got to sit on the front row seats. In the beginning, it was just us at the top together with a house-elf, but soon more people made it to the top box, including the Minister, Cornelius Fudge who greeted me like I was an old friend of his. He introduced me to the Bulgarian minister and introduced himself to Draco, but ignored Sirius, Tonks and Remus the best he could. Remus later said that the minister didn’t want to been seen with a werewolf, a metamorphmagus and a reminder of his failure when it comes to Sirius.
Draco smiles and then looks at their friends ascending the stairs. He takes a deep breath and toys with the necklace around his neck. It is usually hidden beneath Draco’s robes. Harry hadn’t even noticed Draco wore it until a couple of days ago.
Harry blinks and then spots some Hufflepuff students at the end of the hallway. Justin Finch-Fletchley and Hannah Abbott are among them. They all grin at the scene in front of them. A scene that horrifies Harry. How can they laugh at it? But wait a second. Did Justin just say that Draco stopped Neville?
“You still think that Ron having a girlfriend will make him less angry about the fact that you want to kiss his little sister?” Harry asks.
Draco looks confused, unaware of the terror raising inside Harry. He blinks but doesn’t say a word. Harry wants to slap him, wants to hurt him for doing this to them. He said he would never take them again.
The last weekend at school was the best of the entire year. On Saturday morning Draco had to participate in an impromptu Quidditch match against Gryffindor. I went to watch it with all my friends and it was very exciting and fun, having both Gryffindors as Slytherin friends around me, screaming at each other in a friendly manner over the game. Ron and Greg are both very enthusiastic about Quidditch. Hermione and I just laughed at them half of the time for their crazy accusations of foul play. Blaise didn’t seem to be interested in the game at all and was talking with Daphne about summer holidays plans. Halfway to the game, Neville, Seamus and Dean joined us on the stands and joined in with the cheering for their house team.
But that’s not the worst. Since Black had been spotted in the castle, teachers all find excuses to walk along with me to my next class. Draco loves complaining about that, it takes away all our changes to sneak into one of the many alcoves and snug a little between classes. And then Professor Snape called me into his office to tell me that Black might want to kill me. I told him I already knew. He just shook his head and said he should have known. He gave me some new rule for my safety. I’m not aloud to go anywhere after dark without a teacher and I should not spend to much time alone. Not that Professor Snape was worried I’ll be alone much since it seems impossible to separate me from Mister Malfoy. And he assigned Madam Hooch to oversee our Quidditch training. He wouldn’t want Slytherin to lose another match because I can’t train at night.
Harry lets go of Malfoy and Malfoy rests his fist on Harry’s chest again. Softer this time. It seems he’s given up. Malfoy shudders and large tears fall from his eyes. Harry doesn’t think and just wraps his arms around Malfoy’s body and pulls him against his chest.
A soft smile forms on Harry’s face and his cheeks start to heat. He hopes Draco doesn’t see the pink that flushes over them when he confirms.
I’m back at the Dursleys and the summer holiday is not even halfway done and I already want it to be done. As soon as I had come home Uncle Vernon had locked my spell-books, wand, cauldron and broomstick in the cupboard under the stairs. I have a lot of holiday homework I need to get done, so this was a big problem. And don’t be mad, but I picked the lock of the cupboard the first chance I had and grabbed the books I would need to do my homework. And now I study in the middle of the night. At least Hedwig is allowed to fly outside this year, so I can send and receive letters from my friends.
“No, I suppose not. After all, unstable magic does indicate one’s sanity.” And since when had he become so quick-witted? Where is the spoilt and hot-tempered boy of Harry’s school years? Harry knew how to handle him. He feels at a loss with this boy, all blank eyes and flat voice, in front of him.
Malfoy stops about a metre away. He parts his lips, body rearing like the air before a lightning strike. Then, abruptly, he stops in his tracks, and appears to change the course of his sentence. Some of the painful tautness in his body eases to just a recognisable rigid as his walls go up. Nothing in the known universe could explain why this frustrates Harry.
“Harry,” she starts, and the use of his first name shakes him from his somber thoughts, “I know I don’t need to remind you how many options are open to you, but it is worth remembering. Frankly, I’m certain that you could do whatever you so desire. Many people would give a lot to be in the very same position,” and Malfoy, on probation, largely in part to Harry’s testimony, springs to his mind at that. Harry knows it would be smart to take advantage of his good fortune, but truthfully he just wishes he didn’t have any leverage. Because, with it comes jealousy, and therefore, attention; after all that, expectation. Mcgonagall smiles at him with a sad sort of pity in her eyes, “Do you truly have nothing in mind?”
“Great observation, Potter,” Malfoy drones, “So why are you here and not tucked up in bed?” He throws out the question that Harry had wanted to ask back at him before Harry himself has the chance to ask it. Noticing the tinge of pride in his angular features, he thinks that it was intentional.
“Stop,” says Malfoy with finality. His jaw is set like stone and Harry doesn’t know how to reverse this major fuck up of his.
A faint noise comes from the direction of the bathroom, indistinctly resembling a bird squawk. Taking a peek through a gap in his duvet, his eyes dart around the room. There is nothing alive but the dust mites that grab the light of the sun. The numbness that is long settled in his bones begs him to remain in bed,
Asleep, Malfoy isn’t necessarily noisy, but you can certainly detect his presence. The bed frame creaks, and the sheets rustle loudly whenever he moves about, which is frequently. Every now and then he even snores. Harry would’ve thought that with the amount of effort the twat is going through to pretend he doesn’t exist, he would have thought to cast a Silencing spell on his bed, but, hey, it’s none of his business.
. It is covered in painted Phoenixes of all different shades, and they swoop around with as much grace as possible for a crockery decoration. One, a rich and wine-like merlot, rests on the crevice between the handle and the cup and seems to look up at the elderly witch, awaiting her response. It flaps its wings agitatedly; Harry understands.
Mind, his life at Grimmauld wasn’t too different from that- minus the mates, the job, and the housework. Add a strangling layer of trauma and anxiety which cripples him daily, and then you would pretty much have his days.
It’s a modestly sized common room, much less grand than the glorious reds and sweeping tapestries of the Gryffindor counterpart, no matter how cosy it is. Harry presumes that this is due to the fact that, despite it now being law for all Hogwarts students to attend until the age of eighteen, many eighth years are absent, clearly not turning up. Unless they have decided to have a crack at beating Harry and Ron’s withstanding record for ‘latest pupils to the first night of school’.
He gets up, too fast at first. His hands grabble for the railing. From beside him, Malfoy regards the scenery. Ten minutes ago, it was beautiful, but now Harry has had enough.
“It’s complicated,” says Harry, as minimally as possible. However, his mouth betrays him, continuing to move on a motor, even in spite of his will for the opposite. “I suppose I’m just not really right for it anymore, Professor.” He hasn’t said much, if anything at all. The fear that it is still too revealing is loud. The idea that Mcgonagall, the reliable and steady woman that she is- has always been- could come to be disconcerted by him-
to the forefront of his mind. They look up and face him in shock, and Harry is mortified to see that the lack of coverage over Seamus’ genitals only becomes more obvious when Dean moves his head. He stammers an incomprehensible apology, wasting no time before running away at the sound of their embarrassed laughter.
He poses this as a solution now. “Why haven’t they done any Pensieve memory checks, or Legilimancy even?”
The weather gets chillier, and rain starts to fall more frequently. His walks around the castle grounds, however, pursue. Sometimes he remembers an umbrella and he reserves a quick pat on the back for himself. Mostly he doesn’t but it is no matter, because with every splash of rain on his cheeks, comes the appeasing sensation that he is being cleansed. The clouds release their tension and so does he; it is a pleasant company.
It becomes evident that the house doesn’t care for him to feel the sunlight which is attempting to break through the thick material, so he gives up with a huff.
Harry snorts, though without much humour. “Dunno. Feel free to keep trying. Why do you want me to go so badly?” he challenges, unrelenting.
Harry tries to ignore the tension in his chest which strikes him with hard blows to the stomach- once, twice, then three times- at the mention of the war. Just because he is having a better day than usual, doesn’t mean that he is excused from his normal triggers. Oh well. He can’t be too disheartened- miracles don’t happen overnight, he supposes.
“Oh!” She seems shocked, and Harry can tell that she is used to rejection, “Brilliant! Come right this way, sir.”
This causes the boy to retreat into himself a little, taken aback by his own boldness. Harry should rescind his comment, but wouldn’t even if he could. It’s electric- not having to think about his reputation, or about sugar-coating his thoughts for others.
Neville swats at him, laughing and teasing, “Put it away, Justin! I’m not into you like that!” and the sun beams brightly on them all, as Justin jokingly gestures as if to unzip his trousers which elicits screams and yelps from Hannah and Neville. Harry just smiles and tries to ignore that he actually
Malfoy to come near him, and that he only wants to know why Malfoy thinks he is too good to speak to the rest of them.
“Malfoy… please tell me you- that that wasn’t what happened- you didn’t,” he murmurs, unable to open his eyes now, “Did you?”
Malfoy’s eyes widen. He supposes the question doesn't particularly fall in line with their usual tone of conversation. But neither does Harry’s presence here, so perhaps all rules have been hurled out of the window.
“Basically, they still haven’t been identified,” says Ron. “For some bloody reason, nobody seems to be able to give a proper description of their faces. Or at least not one that has led them to them. Nobody is coming forward with names, either.”
It’s about to happen, and Harry would have probably let it, if it weren’t for his sudden moment of realisation. He lurches back and Justin falters, hand hovering from where Harry’s neck had ripped out of it. A wave of nausea washes through him and he walks backwards into his chest of drawers. His mind is spinning and he is confused- so extremely confused. Justin is a man. That is not him.
Lingering over him is Malfoy, dressed in the same blue silk pyjamas that he wore on their first night here. They make him appear so unintimidating that Harry has to smile; he thinks that the point of the expensive silk is probably to boast wealth more than anything, but Malfoy just looks like he belongs in a spa with a bunch of Muggle women. He looks disgruntled and a bit pissed off, as if Harry was the one who woke him up and not the opposite.
“You care,” Harry states, resigning himself to an early demise. He is bluffing; he doesn’t think Malfoy gives two shits about him, other than as much as one would be perturbed by stepping in a puddle. Harry is the puddle, if that weren’t clear. “At least a little bit.”
He doesn’t see Malfoy once, or at least, not in person. There is a constant image of him in Harry’s mind, water droplets from his shower rolling down his icy skin as he stares daggers in Harry’s direction. Getting evermore crinkled in his satchel, the cursed papers feel like the weight of one thousand lead cauldrons. Even Harry after a Weasley Christmas dinner isn’t as heavy.
It is excruciating, watching one of the worst moments of your life unfold in front of you. The shock of it knocks him back from where he had been shaking Malfoy, and he is overwhelmed by the magnitude of what is happening. All he knows is that at a certain point, numbness and pain can coexist; he has both.
“Malfoy?” he says frantically, praying, hoping. He shakes the boy, noticing with alarm how cold he is. His chest is silent and still, and Harry realises he is crying again.  “Can you hear me?”
, is so very disturbing that Harry reckons it would be a wise idea to check himself into a hospital straight away in order to get the image professionally Obliviated. He wouldn’t trust Ron with a task so important.
Malfoy side-eyes him then, his face painted in minute bemusement. “Wouldn’t that be a miracle.” Something flashes in his silver gaze.
“Twat,” he laughs, a little stilted, “Are you going to tell me then, or shall I just die of old age first?”
He dreads what he is about to do even more with every passing second, but he can’t deny himself this one, idiotic thing. One of many, granted. Needless to say that regret will inevitably chase him but he can take it. Knowing that Malfoy is alive, that he will have another opportunity to belittle Harry, leave him tingling-
Also, and more importantly, he thinks that if he spends more than ten seconds asking himself why he truly cares, he might implode with anxiety and unwanted self-realisations. Right now, he doesn’t want to ponder any longer on the reasonings behind his behaviour. He just wants to get through the day and if that measly piece of parchment happens to float his way, who is he hurting by giving it a read?
“Never. If I can defeat Voldemort, I can bloody well beat you in a game of Wizard’s Chess at least once.” And at that, Ron chortles, a deep and earthy sound that, in some strange feat of nature, is actually relaxing to Harry. Most people enjoy the patter of rain, or the crackling of the fire. Not Harry- no. He is unfortunately attuned to Ron and his ungraceful noises.
Falling onto his back, Harry watches the ceiling for a while, with its arching beams and dirty stone, searching for any signs of life. Instead, a part of the left wall crumbles and bounces on the floor, only about two metres away from his hands. The breeze skids across him when he is lying like this, a gushing river of air. He wraps his robes around himself, teeth chattering and fingertips numb. It isn’t peaceful at all, and he isn’t sure why he ever thought it so. Therefore, he musters up all the energy he can find and rolls forward onto his knees first. His mind is so exhausted, his body an ever sorrier state.
He gets a flashback, and sees himself as the two unidentified boys who beat Malfoy up. Harry hadn’t been about to do such a thing,
“So are you planning on ever actually answering any questions? Or are you just going to be a git forever?” mocks Harry, jutting his chin out. Merlin, Malfoy brings out the petulant teenager in him, but he would be kidding himself if he said it didn’t make him feel a little giddy.
you had one of those,” continues Malfoy and Harry assumes he means his Invisibility Cloak. The glare which is shot in his direction doesn’t take someone with eyes to feel. It burns enough. “Pansy always said I was chatting bollocks. I was right, though. Obviously.”
“You, Malfoy. I saw it, all green and scaly, at the foot of your bed this morning. Looked really worn from cuddling.” Harry has completely made that up. In fact, the dragon looked almost brand new when he had picked it up earlier that day, but his insults are lacking and he feels like he is sorely losing whatever battle this has become.
Eating his toast and jam in the kitchen, he smiles sheepishly at Kreacher, who stares at him from across the length of the dining table. Unsure whether he has something on his face, he rubs around his mouth with the back of his hand, but it comes up clean. Outside, the sun is finishing rising and the sky is soaked in golden washes of yellow and orange, the colour spilling throughout the clouds. His kitchen is submerged in the light of it; he regards the soft gold tones covering the entirety of the room, twinkling like stars, with a sense of contentment.
Justin turns to face him then, plump lips smiling sadly. His features are no longer screwed up in enraged pain, but with anguish. It’s different, but it is a mighty pain nonetheless. There is something sparkling in his brown eyes, but this time it isn’t pity. “You think so?”
“Shut up, Malfoy.” Harry can’t help but say, through gritted teeth. He feels weirdly embarrassed, like he has been caught doing something he shouldn’t be.
again. Anything to end this awkward fucking exchange, that could have been completely avoided had it not been for Harry’s idiocy. Shit.
Harry realises he should probably move, and just about manages to force his joints into action to dive around the corner before Malfoy is tip-toeing out of the room. If he were a teacher, he would think that Malfoy certainly looks suspicious- flustered, a bag which is bulging to the brim and clinks with every step, and smelling like the chemicals of the potions lab- so it makes sense that Malfoy seems a bit nervous. His eyes dart back and forth throughout the corridor, somehow missing Harry’s slim body.
Justin seems to wait a little on his bed, perhaps testing the waters to see whether Harry will join him. Harry can just about determine his faint figure through the material of his curtains, drawn up in a silhouette next to him. He knows he should get up. He won’t. Not today. Today is a bad day- he’s aware of it already. The ache in his brain, the freezing over of his mind, the way his limbs have gone soft- they are all indications. And he feels fatigued, despite the fact that he has only just awoken.
Justin’s breath is on his, hot and wet, and his hands move slowly around to the back of Harry’s neck. Each languid stroke of his thumb causes tingles to ripple from where was touched. Their lips are almost touching, just a whisper of air between them.
Collecting the map from where it was, tucked under his broomstick, Harry imagines himself flicking away these pesky thoughts. Logic has never been his friend. He doesn’t care for it.
Arriving at the door, he pulls back. Inside the room, he can hear some clinking of the bottles. He stays like that for a moment, in case some further indication comes to light by sound alone- but nothing happens. Because of this, and because he thinks if he doesn’t go to bed soon, his body might fail on him, he peers round the corner, chancing being seen.
He cannot even be surprised that she already knows his name. If Malfoy was telling the truth and the whole Wizarding World is talking about how he has lost his mind, then his reaction just now would have confirmed it for her. An embarrassed blush on his cheeks, he mumbles, “No harm done. Thank you, Miss Lockwood.”
Harry jolts at the mention of the other boy. All day he has been repressing the need to go and check on him from afar or, at the very least, ask after him. The memory of him, paler than the very ghosts that live among them and unbreathing for the most part, is a stain upon Harry. He sees it even when he closes his eyes, imprinted on his eyelids.
“Nostalgia? Really, Potter?” he says disbelievingly, shaking his head the tiniest amount,“You think that’s funny?”
With the new temperatures, comes Hogwarts infamous woolen season. Harry dons his latest Weasley jumper, noting how baggy it has become on him since only last year. He also takes great joy in unlodging his knitted beanie from the bottom of his trunk, laughing when Justin reveals his own penguin-patterned one. Calling Harry out for his judgemental attitude, Justin demands he must wear it about for the duration of a school day as payment. He caves in and tries to tune out the looks he gets. Frankly, it is some comfort that he gets stared at for the ridiculous, cartoon bird wearing ice skates on his head as opposed to the usual reasons.
now, he guesses- has a habit of making himself scarce just as Harry has worked up the energy to make conversation. He doesn’t really mind- Goldstein owes him nothing, after all- and these days, he prefers to keep to his close friends anyway, lest he has a panic attack. Harry isn’t sure whether he could ever have been considered a social butterfly but he thinks, a little regretfully, that he had certainly been a great deal less closed off than he is now. Perhaps it’s his fault- perhaps Goldstein doesn’t feel welcomed.
. Even more terrifying is that he thinks that Malfoy understands what he is saying. He sees it mirrored in his expression, in his cold eyes which search for something in Harry’s face, though he doesn’t know what. As he shuffles uneasily, Malfoy seems to find what he is looking for and comes to sit up straight.
The Astronomy tower catches Harry’s eye, sticking out like a dark cloud on a sunny day, and history replays in his mind. Dumbledore had let him believe one too many wrong things on that fateful night. It had taken Harry a long time to feel angry. Sad? Sure. Confused? Absolutely. Rage came last, but it didn’t disappoint.
“As if he could, with that massive bloody bruise,” chuckles Ron, “No clue why he doesn’t fix it up. For a Pure-blood, he's not great at using his wand, is he?” And Harry ponders about whether he should give back Malfoy's wand- his proper one- which is dusting away in a trunk at Grimmauld Place. He thinks he might have seen Kreacher crying, fondling it- probably at the sight of something new from the Black family line. Everything in that house has lived at least two hundred years, he is certain .
Harry takes a moment to answer, allowing the lapse in his brain to dominate for a second, and then does no more than grunt and mutter “It’s alright. Not your fault.”
He pays for his book and tips generously. Perpetually on time, Hermione meets him at the door, apparently having paid for her own bloody mini-library at another till in the shop. She has at least four bags full, but when Harry questions the need for such a copious amount, the bloodthirsty hint in her eyes makes him drop the subject.
As Mcgonagall pours herself another tea and helps herself to a buttery shortbread, Harry racks his brain for something he could offer up which would give her some bloody faith in him. Unfortunately, during school he didn’t have many opportunities to develop any hobbies and interests, unlike most of his peers-  another thing he can blame Voldemort for. Who knows? Had he been given the time and space, perhaps he could have become a dragon-trainer like Charlie, mysterious and rogue, or an astute curse-breaker like Bill. Merlin, he could have even gone wild and passionately launched himself into the field of toad-breeding. Hagrid would have been overjoyed, but he will never know.
Hermione grunts and narrows her eyes, but pats him on the knee as a demonstration of understanding before turning to Harry, “What about you, Harry? That was awful for us but I imagine even more horrific for you. Did anyone hurt you?” She scans worriedly up and down Harry’s body.
“Everyone talks about how hard it is for Muggleborns in the Wizarding world, but nobody ever mentions what it is like once you get home!” he exclaims, both eyebrows and lips downturned in agony. Harry gets the feeling that Justin has been bottling this up for a while. “My family don’t understand me anymore. I’ve pretty much lost all of the friends I had as a child because they think I abandoned them, and I don’t blame them. What would you do if, say, Ron left one day and never told you why? If he only came back for a few weeks of the year, with no explanation, and then left again? I would be pissed. It’s a wonder Elliot stayed with me for this long, if I am being honest. It was only a matter of time.”
“Going to hurt me, Potter?” Malfoy says with his chin in the air, and he stares at Harry with the question written on his face. He is shaking.
It is when he is rubbing his eyes, trying to assure himself that he did not just see Dean on his knees,
“Malfoy?” Harry questions, the lack of response irritating him. For some reason, at his voice, Malfoy’s head snaps up.
Moving through the courtyard, he waves awkwardly at the numerous people who greet him. He feels awful about it, but he swears that he has never met at least two thirds of them. Indeed, Neville, Justin and Hannah are sharing a late lunch on an old and crumbling stone bench. Justin signals for him to come over, seemingly desiring to be saved from third-wheeling. Well, never let it be said that Harry doesn’t live up to his title.
“You’re glittery, mate,” says Ron with amusement. He sits up and wiggles his long freckled nose humorously as he scans Harry’s face.
Sauntering over, Zabini seems to say something which agitates him and his face distorts into an irritated expression. His lips curl and Zabini rolls his eyes, turning to walk back in Harry’s direction. They make eye contact. Zabini’s dark stare, sweeping cheekbones and robes which sweep behind him in a manner that suggests their expense, leave Harry fidgeting. What is strange is that Harry’s feeble gaze seems to have a similar effect on the other boy. He frowns and hurries away, tripping ever so slightly. Nobody else appears to have noticed but Harry feels bizarrely perturbed at seeing the Zabini facade slip. He has to remind himself:
Malfoy just hums in agreement. His pale brows are furrowed; everything about him makes Harry wish he was an artist. Never has a person looked so intriguing. Maybe he will ask Luna her thoughts, she draws and he knows she couldn’t disagree. It is an objective fact, nothing more.
All around them, the wind presses in and he feels like they are seconds from being struck by a hurricane. In fact, now that he observes their surroundings, Malfoy seems to be actively whipping up a gale by accident. It scratches Harry’s cheek as he explodes, “Potter, I will-”
Malfoy is sat delicately over a table in the corner of the room. He is writing something onto a piece of parchment, elegant quill, which manages to maintain the same haughty nature as its owner, perched high in the air. Harry reflects that he is not sure whether he has even heard the man say one word as of yet. Good. The more posh drawling he hears, the quicker his life span dwindles.
The stairs creak and the mirage is shattered. It is like a switch has been flicked when Malfoy’s head whips around, clearly nervous, checking whether anyone has caught them in the act. And by
“It’s quite windy up here,” he says, hoping Malfoy might provide an explanation but not feeling like demanding it. A violent gust makes his robes billow outwards, and he wobbles. Still quite unsure whether Malfoy will bite his head off, he tests the waters by moving to sit down opposite. There is no reaction, so he deems it safe and plonks himself down ungracefully.
Boredom- in that his life, his lessons, his conversations, the days which blur into one, feel so exceptionally pointless to him now. Sadness- in quite literally every way possible, and so bloody different to the picture of Malfoy’s beaming expression. And an overwhelming sense of
“No, it’s OK. Thank you though for offering,” says Justin, “I’m probably staying with Elliot, if his parents can stand to be around me after what they said. He thinks they’re embarrassed,” he rearranges his robes and adds, “As they should be.”
Soon, Ron is joining them and following in tow is Ginny. This is only slightly awkward. He’s fine. They smile at each other halfheartedly, Ginny tapping her foot in that impatient manner of hers, and Harry coming close to fainting with each counting second.
As he stands, he rediscovers all the glitter on his body as it falls and flitters to the ground in shimmering gold blurs. Without his glasses on, and in the path of the moonlight, they are stars falling to the earth. He grabs his glasses and definition returns. No longer blessed by ill-sightedness, the glitter just looks like glitter once again. Sometimes he prefers life without all its sharp edges, and will choose to go about his day half-blind. It is certainly softer, and often more beautiful in its simplicity. He finds that if he doesn’t strain too hard, the temporary letup of the harsh lines and mean details of reality is a welcome break. And if he fell down the stairs a few times too many in the process, or accidentally walked into Kreacher as he skulked on the landing, well, every system has its flaws.
“Yeah, no, I think that’s a great idea,” he forces himself to shake off the cold feeling and attempts to bring himself back to the room and the peace of a few moments ago. Only the genial smile on Justin’s face and the inviting warmth of the day manage to dissipate the growing pressure in his chest. He feels frustrated, but that won’t help him now, so he ignores it. “Might try that today, if you don’t mind me stealing your idea. I think it could be good to try and actually get something done rather than sit around on my arse all day.”
Suddenly, a ball of light grabs his attention. It travels through the air until it halts, hovering directly in front of him and beckoning him to come closer. It is curious, appearing to have come from nowhere, and looking suspiciously like the same light Harry had seen the first time he was here. Certainly, it has an uncanny resemblance.
Shit times two. Harry has also apparently forgotten a second thing- this being Erin’s freakish and unprecedented comments about his love life. He thinks back to when they were squatted together underneath that tree, the leaves tumbling into their laps in smooth flurries, as she questioned him about his soulmate. Then, he had considered that she perhaps had Seer blood in her; his mind had been whirling with a tornado, blustering images of Ginny and their relationship gone wrong. Suddenly, he realises that he hasn’t really thought about her in the last few days.
“You know, Elliot and I have a pact. When the weather is sunny like this, we have to do something with our day that we usually wouldn’t. Take it as a chance to be productive, or something. It’s silly really, but it helped me after the war,” comments Justin, sitting up a little in his bed. The duvet puffs up around him, framing his small figure in clouds of linen. “When I just didn’t feel like getting out of bed.”
But Malfoy is nowhere to be seen in the vicinity, and Harry is only partially glad. He came here to get away from his problems, not run into them. Still, he can’t help but feel marginally glad whenever he sees the boy. If Malfoy is anything, it is definitely not a routine. He is unpredictable and unexpected, a puzzle, not unlike life.
. With a panic, he notices the light has disappeared. Without it’s company, he feels more lonely than ever and he yearns for fifteen minutes ago, when it pioneered the route like his guardian angel.
“What!” Hermione rubs at her face, which only serves to spread the ink further onto her forehead and her hands. “Agh!”
At one point, in all his nervous distraction, he bashes into a branch. As he rises, rubbing where it hit him, it flings back with even more vigour and rips his cheek. Pain blossoms, hot and sickly, and he places a hand at the point of injury. When he brings it back down, he sees dark specks of blood on his fingers and feels woozy. It forces memories filled with anguish and fear, all bathed and dripping in red and black, to the front of his mind; he has to sit down and catch his breath.
Harry thinks she’s better off without him. He’s not so sure about himself, but he recognises now that he was devastating her, as if she could have been any more so after Fred’s death. And he could not cope with the pressure and responsibilities of a relationship, not when a trip to the bathroom to brush his own fucking teeth is more uncommon than not. She thought it was disgusting, Ron doesn’t understand it, Hermione tries, and Harry? Well he’s just proud of the days where he does manage the trek along the landing, no matter how heavy his legs feel, and how much he just wants to collapse right there on the wooden floorboards. Kreacher would probably eat him for dinner if he died in the house.
Without thinking about it, Harry locks the paper in the trunk at the foot of his bed with double enchantments, and gets into bed. He wandlessly casts quick cleaning charms over his body, and climbs into bed, not caring for menial tasks tonight. Those are for when he is numb, craving routine- not nights fuelled by stupidity and exhaustion. Justin may or may not come in soon and wonder why the fuck Harry is going to bed when it is not even nine yet, but he doesn’t much care.
Malfoy pauses for the briefest moment before continuing to write, and the falter was so small in nature that Harry could have easily missed it had he not been acutely aware of everything around him. There is a tension in the air that tells Harry that Malfoy has acknowledged his presence, and merely does not give a fuck. As if it is deliberately trying to agonise Harry, the nearest lantern flickers wildly, making Malfoy’s angular features appear even more prominent.
Hermione picks Harry up from Grimmauld Place a week later. He thinks that Ron might have warned her of his need for space, since he was pre-empting a much earlier visit. Either way, he is grateful for the chance to process the upcoming year. All things considered, he reckons he has been handling it pretty well, if you can exclude, well, the crying fit. And the second. And the third. Not to mention that he has been dressed in the same clothes for five consecutive days. Recovery is a work in progress, as Hermione has always said.
this is a bit longer than usual (6k) but i have no idea why because i only managed to fit it in half of what i wanted to!!! i guess you'll just have to wait for the next update to find out how i originally planned to do this chapter ;)
When they find Ron outside Zonkos, they are greeted with quite the spectacle. They can tell that something is wrong from the get-go, because his best mate seems to be whimpering. Upon realisation, Hermione slaps her hand over her mouth, and it only takes Harry a couple of beats to follow. A picture of total despair, Ron is slouched on the bench with his head in his hand. All around him lies locks of ginger.

He and Ron spend most of the day sitting out in the grass. The late September sun makes up for the fact that Harry is feeling spent today, as if the contentment he experienced yesterday has sucked him dry. Harry had been nervous this morning as he brushed his teeth in a tired daze, worrying that a lot would be demanded from him today when he has so little to give. It is a comfortable temperature, hot enough to sit outside but not too hot that they are sticky in their robes. Some crickets chirp cheerfully from the bushes behind them, singing a harmonious tune. Thankfully, the relaxing nature of the coming evening stops him from having to contribute much to any conversation. Harry feels guilty that he is like this, even with Ron. He isn’t sure what has happened to him that he gets panicked about spending an afternoon outside with his best friend. Oh- wait- no, he does. The war. His fucked up brain. What else would it be?
“Yeah I told him last month, once I found out I was coming back to Hogwarts. I put it off as long as possible but he wasn’t taking any more rubbish excuses.”
“A sleeping potion? Like Dreamless Sleep?” asks Harry curiously and with a shudder. He has come very close to developing an addiction to the substance in the past few months. On those nights where the flashbacks and fear just won’t stop flooding through the gates, he feels like Eve must have done with the Apple upon seeing the potion glimmering in his bathroom cabinet. It is a dangerous game, but oh so worth it.
“I heard that someone got a kinda clear one but- get this, it’s bloody weird- they have no idea who the students are. Teachers are shitting themselves because either the Pensieve memory is just not clear enough, or there are some random blokes running around the school beating up Malfoys. Might’ve broken in.” And Ron raises his eyebrows for dramatic effect, blue eyes wide and expectant.
. It defies reason, however he speaks the language of his instincts well, and this is what they tell him. If only his opinion was valued and respected by the twat. Yes- he needs Malfoy to stay. If anything, just so that he has a purpose, even if it is solely figuring out
"Look I'm sorry for asking this again! I know he's a changed man now. It's just sometimes I can't help myself, sometimes I still -"
"Your face!! Hahaha... I know silly! I was just joking! I was trying to break the tension!" She said sheepishly.
"When you feed someone 2 spoonfuls, that person becomes euphoric. Lust clouds his mind completely. He makes a move on feeder, but he can still get control over himself. If feeder wants to stop, he can stop himself & will respect the feeder's choice."
Her facial expressions proved that there was something VERY wrong! She looked like a dear caught in headlights.
"I know I don't even deserve to apologise for what I've done, but I'm really sorry. I didn't think of it Dra- "
"LUST POTION Ginny!!!! & that too WITHOUT HIS CONSENT!! Do you realised it's called RAPE!?!" Draco was nearly screaming. He couldn't contain his anger anymore. He couldn't believe that Ginny was capable of doing something like that!
Ginny sighed. There was no point in hiding anymore. She maybe smart but not smart enough to fool Draco & Hermione!
Turned out, Draco and Ginny didn’t know everything about that potion! 🤦🏻♀️ Maybe Prof Snape Will throw some light on this subject in next chapter!😬
He realised that his downfall was inevitable now. Nobody can save him, not even Harry himself. Once the potion starts it's work, even the gods above can't stop it. He realised that he's going to be destroyed by the man he loves so much! & he was completely helpless to do anything about it. So he waited, waited for the agony to begun.
"Are you crazy Hermione? We have to take potter to madam Pomfrey and prof Snape immediately! We can't leave him alone. He had consumed one of the most dangerous potion, that too wrongly prepared. He'll harm someone when it'll kick in." He said the last line glaring at Ginny.
" ohh Ginevra stop that!” I said that with annoyance. “And well I'm reading it cause it's interesting.”
Yes we've had this conversation merlin knows how many times, & Ron is still not convinced. He's still looking at Draco with suspicion in his eyes, & honestly I don't blame him cause I know that we've had bad history with Draco for all these years (who knows better then me!!) but he's changed now! He isn't the same bloke who he used to be! He's not the same arrogant prick who used to run around in the hallways like he owns the place! No! Now He's a very different person. Very vulnerable & soft human who's very very scared of everything! I don't know why it hurts me to see him this way.. like he's afraid of his own shadow. It makes me want to protect him from all the bad things in the world! It makes me—-
Draco was aware that all the potions in that book were extremely dangerous & very fatal. So the thought of Harry consuming any of that was unbearable to him. His heart was beating faster. He was really frustrated, he was angry at Ginny for being so stupid, but mainly he was very scared for HIS Harry. He just wanted to see him in instant, to make sure that he's okay.
"How about you tell us, where is Potter?" Said Draco. He asked for Harry once again. He didn't understand why he felt so agitated when he didn't see Harry on entering the library. He  remember telling Hermione that he was worried for Ginny and that's the reason why he wanted to come with her, So why doesn't he feel at peace after seeing her??! Why he's desperately looking for certain green eyed boy!
"We're talking about the thing you put in Harry's drink! What was that Ginny?" Asked Hermione in stern voice.
I don’t take this kind of behaviour lightly.. so I blocked him from all my social media & blocked his number & shut him out of my life!
“Ginevra you fool, it gets activated when person you love is near you. He loves you obviously, so it means you must’ve messed this up while making this, that’s why it’s not working on him & 3 spoons is dangerous amount, he’ll completely loose control & harm someone when it’ll kick in ”-Draco.
"Well if you try to use the things on your face called EYES you will be able to see that I'm reading" I said with Sarcasm.
"But I want to know why!? Why are you reading potion’s book of all books, Draconis?” She said with mischief. Did I mention how childish she is!!
"Locomotor Mortis" Draco was the second one to cast a spell at Harry, but just like the last time it didn't work.
Well clearly I am not the one who's being blind! Why can't they see it. There's something fishy going on with Malfoy. I've known him for years! I know how snarky little bitch he is! No seriously,Why can't they see it!!
"Hermione.. it's Ginny we're talking about!! What's wrong possibly she could be doing? Relax love. It's probably nothing. Don't worry your pretty lil head over this." Said Ron smiling.
"What's Ginny & potter doing in the library at this hour? Isn't it closed?" asked Draco with confusion.
Draco was about to reach the door but suddenly Harry's hand grabbed him from behind with immense force.
One person who I know personally, has violated my privacy... despite of me requesting him to stay away from my account, he went so far & finally found this! & he confronted me about it!
"Ohh that would have been funny.. but sadly Hermione caught me last minute... she has sharp eyes Draco , she sees everything!! How does she see-"
I interrupt her. “I know you enough to know when there’s something wrong, when you're hurting & when you're sad! And btw I know that you didn't just stop me reading to tell me how Proff  Trelawney tripped over that stupid fortune telling ball! Or how your roommate accidentally set her curtains on fire & how you tried to prank Ron with roofie filled muffins!!"
"No I wanna stay" I said firmly with tight smile. I don't wanna be alone, not now! I need a comfort crowd!
"well mate how do you know that he was going towards the girl's bathroom!?" Ron asked me skeptically.
"STUPEFY" casted Ginny, but it didn't stop Potter. They were truly terrified now. No magic was working on Harry. Draco & Ginny had no idea about this effect of the potion.
"Harry that's very serious accusation to make! I believe there's something wrong with Malfoy but calling him death eater is going too far!" said Hermione with a frown.
They casted spell after spell! Each one stronger than the previous one, But Nothing worked! That door didn't even budge.
"Yes Ronald he's not so bad when you get to know him! He's very friendly! In fact Me, Ginny and Harry are quite close to him now" she said the last line looking directly at me with a small smile & with a knowing look in her eyes!
"yeah but this place is huge! we don't even know where they are! How are we gonna find them?" Said Draco.
"well why not Hermione!? He's acting very suspicious! He's very quiet, it's like he's trying to avoid any unnecessary attention. He's not even making stupid remarks on us in the classroom & he -"
"Well It's a long story Hermione.. I-I don't know from where to start." Said Ginny in defeated voice.
"What!!? No.. Of course I didn’t! I sneaked this off from the kitchen Draco!! THE KITCHEN!!" She said dramatically.
Maybe I should change the username or story name or something! He already has an account here, so making it private is no use! ( & I don’t even know his account name 😔)
"Ginny we need to break this door!" Said Hermione with Panic. "We have to get him out!" She was really scared for Draco.
Hey guys are you excited for more?? Please please please let me know! I'm dying to know your thoughts! Love you guys! ~ zee
"Well, it's- It's just Ginny borrowed a potion book from me to distract her mind. So when I heard potion I was little shock. But that book is just juicy old tales of potion world. So just a coincidence maybe." Said Draco.
