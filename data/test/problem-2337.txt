Malfoy picks a table at the window on the other side of the café. When they both sit a girl with bouncy blonde curls walks up to them, “Can I get you something to drink?”
“Yes of course.” Harry turns around, “You vanished my clothes.”
But now it’s two months later, and he wishes Draco had just told him yes or no.
“You are? Here?” Potter leans in close, his lips brush Draco’s left ear, “A muggle?”
“Gosh!” Ginny’s red hair catches Harry’s eyes as she and Luna come up beside Hermione, “You guys are so tan now!” Both girls take their turns hugging Harry and Ron. “It must be from all that outside dragon taming you’ve been doing in Romania.” Ginny giggles.
“Draco?” for a second Draco thinks it’s Harry, but then Pansy casts Lumos and walks from the doorway to the bed. “Are you okay?”
Draco toes of his shoes as well and throws his ruined shirt next to the bed. Harry steps in between Draco’s legs and tips his head up with a finger under his chin. He kisses him deeply, Draco actually groans deep in his throat when Harry’s hand roam over his chest.
“I- yes.” Theo’s afraid Blaise is not going to agree to help him with this plan, but then his face breaks into a big smile, flashing his bright white teeth. “I’m in.”
“Well, do it with someone else. Malfoy isn’t interested.”
“There are pictures to prove it, Draco.”
Confused Draco looks at his friend. On his lap Pansy smirks and pats his hand.
“Draco. Malfoy. It really is you.” Potter’s unusual eyes sparkle, “What are you doing here? In this mu- this bar?”
“Merlin,” Draco gasps as he lays back down on his back. “That was amazing.”
“We? Why would you?  Ahh” a look of clarity crosses Blaise’s face. Theo must admit it unnerves him a bit. “You want to get into Granger’s pants!”
Lavender settles down Pansy, “That wasn’t nearly satisfying enough.” She whispers before she shouts at Granger that it’s her turn.
but Harry interrupts. “I know it’s a wizarding place and we both rather not go out in the wizarding world, but the restaurant is really great, and we can both use a glamour so nobody will know it’s us. And besides, it won’t be busy in the restaurant when we’re there, cause I was late with my reservation so we could only get a table at 4.”
“If you don’t ignore me.” Draco says clearly.
“Please just come with me to the three broomsticks. Hermione and Ginny are already there.”
break your heart.
“Yes, just tired.”
“Oh I- I’m so sorry Hermione.”
“He can’t talk for himself anymore?” Blaise asks with a smirk.
Besides our positions don’t really lend to a one on one game. Maybe you should find a chaser, or better yet another seeker to play a game.”
of February
“Don’t play your Slytherin mind tricks on me Zabini.” Ronald says with a smirk on his face.
“He’s both our best man. And he’s the best at it!” Theo waves at guests across the room, “See you two later. Thanks for coming Harry!”
Draco flinches and bumps into the counter.
“I can’t stop thinking about Hermione.”
“So, let me get this straight,” Dan says, demanding Draco’s attention again. “So you were, unfairly handsome, incredibly vain and a bad boy?” Dan whistles.
“Draco,” Harry tries to interrupt his rambling, but Draco continues.
Draco snorts, “Look what’s in the paper, Potty.”
Harry glances at Malfoy then looks him up and down again. He wears tailored blue trousers and a white shirt with rolled up sleeves, showing off his tattoos again. “It was the only thing I had.” Harry shrugs.
“Really Potter?!” Draco says angrily. “When there's a madman living in your house threatening to kill your parents if you don't do what he asks of you then talk to me about choices.”
“I’m not.” Draco says, trying to get his face in his normal scowl.
“Do you think that is a good idea?” Michael looks concerned.
Harry snorts.
“No Harry, nonsense. Please take a seat.” Robards motions to the chair next to Malfoy. “It’s actually great timing.” Robards continues, “Malfoy here is going to be the new Master Healer responsible for the aurors, and with his potion background he’s our go to guy for consults on potions and poisoning cases. Which I hope you will continue to do even with your promotion.”
“I love you Harry. Just don’t go.”
was a good idea.
Harry pushes Draco flat on his back on the soft sheets of his bed and he kneels down, pressing kisses on Draco’s stomach. His tongue flicking just above the waistband, his hands undoing Draco’s trousers and he pulls both the trousers as the pants down at once. He kisses Draco’s inner thigh, before pulling the off entirely. “Harry” Draco murmurs, his hand burying itself in Harry’s hair.
Malfoy smiles at his hands, “Yes well. I worked as a regular healer for a while, but quite a few people refused to let me work on them. So I started working more and more on the background at the potion’s lab of Mungo’s. But I liked the rush of being an active healer, so sometimes I got the work along on the emergency auror cases.” Malfoy shrugs, “they mind the least. When the position of master healer opened, they offered it to me. It’s not as active as I would like but I get to manage a team of healers who respect me and maybe I get to spring in and help in the emergency room every once in a while.” His eyes flick up to Harry’s. He looks hopeful, like he’s asking Harry.
Theo glances over at Hermione studying beside him, a slight smile on his lips.
I ever told ‘I love you’ to. And I – I can’t hurt like this ever again. I really, really can’t. Never again.”
“Excuse me?” Draco crosses his arms over his chest.
"Potter." Blaise looks form Draco to Potter and back again. They're staring at each other. And it all falls into place. Potter going on about a blond git, of course that can only mean one person. And it seems like he is just as infatuated with Draco as everyone knows Draco is with Potter. They're both just too stubborn to make the first move.
“You weren’t so bad yourself.”
This was all I had saved on my computer, so the next chapter will probably take a while.
“How long have you been here now?” Blaise asks.
“No, no that’s not what I meant. It’s just – why?”
“That’s a birthday cake.” When Draco doesn’t say anything but stare Harry pipes up again, “It’s chocolate, your favourite. Do you like it?”
“How is that the same?”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draco pushes past Dan, “What did he tell you?”
Granger looks up, concern clear in her eyes as she clears her throat, “Truth.”
Harry places the camera on the kitchen counter and pulled Draco towards him, pressing sloppy kiss on his temple. “Missed you.” He mumbles. Draco smiles as Harry waves his hand and mutters under his breath. After a couple of flashes Harry grabs the camera and pulls the pictures from beneath it. “This one is nice.” He hands a photo to Draco.
“What the fuck was that?”
“Well because you ask so bluntly,” Draco rolls his eyes, but can’t help the smile that plays on his lips, “Why don´t you come over and join me?”
Harry loses Draco in the crowd as Hermione starts talking about rules and regulations.
“But you didn’t.”
Ron clears his throat and pulls Ginny in a bearhug. “I’m honoured.”
“I’m not!” Draco shouts over his shoulder at Pansy. “I’m not.” He repeats at Harry seriously.
Draco moans and tilts his head a little to the side, Harry leans in and presses sloppy kisses along the length of Draco’s neck. When he finds
He falls asleep with Harry’s fingers messing up his hair.
“Err, make sure you fold the clothes properly.” Draco says, a red flush colouring his pale cheeks.
“Bloody hell.” Ron pushes a hand in his hair, “We’ve really been away too long.”
Pansy all but stormed up to him and pulled him aside. When she was sure there wasn’t anyone looking at them or listening in, she slapped him across the face.
Draco laughs deeply in his throat, “I thought you left.”
Theo makes a face, “But, I’m horrible at quidditch.”
Draco laughs, “How many do you own? Do I even want to know?” Draco thanks the waitress who gives him a glass of wine as well.
“Okay fair.”
Draco shoots up in bed. He’s breathing hard and his sweaty shirt clings to his body.
“I get to join you in the shower.” Draco says with a smile.
“You slept the whole day yesterday!” Pansy says confused.
“I don’t think I can handle having much more sex Harry.” Draco says with a smirk.
Malfoy shrugs, “I think I can speak for us both if I say busy with work.”
“Go on Theo,” Pansy whispers.
“But that’s different.” When Michael raises his eyebrow, Draco elaborates, “You’re muggles.”
Maurice’s face lights up, “Thank you so much mister Potter. Draco told me you would be able to help me.”
“Not at all! Not when we used to see each other every day!” Hermione says.
“He’s definitely going to offer you a job.” Ron says.
“You didn’t tell me you’d set me up with someone this pretty Michael.” Dan says keeping his eyes on Draco.
“Do you fancy birds or blokes?” Daphne asks a smile spreading across her face.
“We just really like quidditch.” Harry says.
“I don’t feel like playing quidditch right now,” Greg continues. It sounds forced and Draco realises he’s trying to continue Pansy’s plan. Probably to get to whatever Pansy said in his ear.
Why are you all so dramatic? It’s kind of romantic.”
Pansy rolls her eyes, “Jeez, I don’t know that Theo.” She says loudly, “That’s a very difficult question maybe you should ask someone who knows about Arithmancy.”
“I'm going to vanish them as soon as possible.” Draco says without looking up. He just keeps grabbing shirts and throwing it on the throw away pile.
“Yeah, I thought you knew. Have you not read the Prophet article about it?”
Harry looks at the paper and frowns, “I was just having lunch with Ginny.”
“Draco? What are you doing here? Alone?” Michael sits down opposite of Draco. “Where’s Harry?”
“Then why are you friends with him?” Draco asks
“No. I’m not marrying Draco, Ronald.” Hermione says shushing Ron, “And don’t call him that! I was just asking him if he could help me pick out an engagement ring for Pansy.”
Robards sighs, “Just say thank you, Harry.”
Pansy stills. “You told him you loved him. That’s huge! You never told that to anyone. Or have you ever?”
“To be fair you did break my nose once.”
“No of course not. Do you honestly think I would break up with one of my best friends just because someone flirted with me?”
He took Draco back home and begged him to take him back. Draco told him he need time and Harry understood. He really did.
Harry nods, but still looks hesitant.
“So, I went out to the muggle world and I like to find unique places with really good food. So, I ended up wandering around one night and stumbled up on this place. And the food is really delicious.”
Draco flusters and adverts his eyes from Harry to his pint.
“Again, it is
“What?!” Blaise whispers, “I thought she was dating Ronald.”
“It’s just,” Draco pauses for effect and can’t help but smirk at Harry’s eager expression, “I don’t know what to wear.”
“Oh, stop it Theo. I expected it from
“A kiss.”
“Malfoy.” Harry says with a curt nod. “I’m sorry I didn’t know you were busy.” Harry says to Robards, “I can come back later.”
“About auroring?” Harry asks amused, looking at Draco once more. For some reason Draco always looks his best at weddings. This time he's wearing a blue shirt with rolled up sleeves, to show off his tattoos. Which he only seems to do at weddings. White trousers that fit snugly over his leg and bottom and expensive looking loafers. His hair falls freely in his face, but he doesn’t bother brushing it out of his eyes. “Yes,” Draco says, “so I’ll leave you two to it.” Draco turns away and Harry can’t help that his eyes follow him across the room.
“I already put it on the agenda.” Hermione tells Ginny when she and Ron pull apart.
“With Potter.” Blaise says grinning.
Ronald looks away from the board at Blaise, “yeah sure.”
“I would love that.” Draco presses his head back against Harry’s neck.
“I- Colin Creevey’s camera. I got it from his brother Dennis yesterday at my birthday dinner at the Burrow.”
Ginny firecalled and asked him to go out to lunch. Harry hesitated, but Ron urged him to go. So, he went. He should have known better then to go against his feelings. Because Merlin it was awful. As soon as they sat down, Ginny started talking about how they were both still single and older and wiser then when they’d broken up. And how she was ready now, that he should be ready now as well. He seemed like he was ready.
Draco raises his eyebrow and Pansy makes a choking noise.
Suddenly Harry’s interest in this conversation has returned, “Did he now?”
Not even half an hour later Weasley gets up with lots of noise. Everyone in the library looks up and at him. He doesn’t even flinch, but Hermione does. Weasley cups her face and presses a sloppy kiss on her lips, then stalks off. Theo rolls his eyes, why does Weasley feel the need to mark of his territory so? He really doesn’t need to worry with a girlfriend like Hermione.
Draco now looks at Harry, “Of course they'll fit, Dominique has your measurements.”
Harry glances over at Draco Malfoy, who’s talking to Parvatti and Lavender his hands waving around as he seems to be elaborately explaining something. Pansy is right, he is handsome. Hermione steers the conversation away from Malfoy even though Harry’s eyes keep trailing back to him. And when Pansy and Hermione say their goodbyes sometime later, Harry and Ron also decide to go.
“Huh?”
“Yes,” Harry says more calmly now, “Yes of course I would have.”
“We could talk to each other,
“Do you like bacon and eggs?” Harry asks.
And Blaise takes his open mouth as an opportunity to deepen the kiss. Ronald grabs Blaise’s bicep to steady himself as he melts into Blaise’s touch. Blaise places his other hand on the small of Ronald’s neck to pull him a bit closer.
“What was that?” Draco asks as he organises the Weasley sweaters in a separate neatly folded pile.
“And Harry do you mind being my best man?” Luna asks a worrying frown on her brow.
Theo realises he’s been looking too long when Hermione meets his eyes over the tables and flushes. Theo quickly looks back to his essay.
Harry pushes in an extra finger and Draco rolls his eyes back in pleasure, “Salazar, Harry! Harry, Harry.
“Err, yeah. I think. Robards wants to see me to talk about what I did in Romania and what I’m going to do now that I’m back in England.”
“So curiosity?”
“Hey,” Draco says softly.
Harry laughs loudly, “Did he tell you about his son’s lost-”
“Well,” Dan finishes his pint, “I bought the first round, so”
“And you don’t?” Blaise asks Pansy.
The next two weeks went by fairly well. He thought about Draco constantly but that is to be expected. Though he tried his best to push it away. He went out with Ginny on two dates, just to see. On the second date she told him that they were throwing a party. When he asked why she told him; “To celebrate us getting back together of course, silly.” Yes, right. Silly. He hadn’t even realised that they’d gotten back together this quick.
“Nonsense mate,” Ron says, “You did brilliant things in Romania.”
Harry clears his throat; he needs to get out of this conversation. “Right, just come in on Monday and we’ll talk about it then.”
Blaise snatches Draco’s glass from him and pushes him up. He stumbles but Harry catches him. When he straightens Draco realises, he’s a few inches taller than Harry, and they’re standing close. Really close. Draco can see the golden flecks in Harry’s green eyes, just before they flatter shut.
“Mhm,”
Draco follows Harry down a narrow street. “Where are you taking me Potter? Should I be worried?” Draco asks not able to hide the humour from his voice.
“Draco…”
“Well if it’s any consolation Malfoy, you were the only player who made me work for it.”
“I have not.”
“Of course, you did.” Harry drops the old t shirt he had pressed against his chest and walks to his floo. “You hungry Malfoy? I'm ordering take out for us since we'll probably be here all night. Harry looks over his shoulder right as Draco vanishes the shirt Harry had held. Harry rolls his eyes and says he'll be right back. He steps through his fireplace and steps out at his favourite Italian place on Diagon. He orders a salad and two different pastas at the counter. Ten minutes later he steps back through the floo with his and Draco's dinner. When he steps back out at home Draco has placed the bags off the couch and the table and sets the low table with some cutlery and plates. He looks up when Harry arrives. “I hope you don't mind that I grabbed this from your kitchen.” He also places two glasses filled with water on the table. “I don't mind at all” Harry says as he places the plastic bag with their food in the middle of the table.
They’re tangled between the sheets, basking in the Afterglow. Still clinging to each other’s lips. The way Harry kisses him is like the religion’s in his lips. Draco thinks they might just get away with this, staying in bed the whole weekend without anyone bothering them. He has cancelled his Sunday dinner with his parents and Harry told him he didn’t have to go to his usual lunch with his Weasleys.
“What?! You can't throw them away.” Bemused Harry watches as Draco grabs his favourite shirt and looks at it disgustingly before putting it on the pile. “That's my favourite shirt!” Harry grabs it off the pile and holds it close to his chest.
“Almost home. Just few minutes’ walk. I need some air.”
“But?” Harry asks eagerly.
“I think I can get some time off around then. It’s never really busy around that time anyway.” Draco says trying to sound casually, but his heart beats rapidly in his chest. Does this mean Harry wants to take their relationship a step further?
Ronald raises his eyebrow and leans over Blaise to look at the cover of the book. His knee pressed against Blaise’s thigh. His throat exposed just inches above Blaise’s mouth. He places one hand on Blaise’s chest to stabilise himself. “Really? Divination? I didn’t know you were into that.” He sits back, his had trailing slightly over Blaise’s chest.
“Besides, that’s not what we were doing,” Harry continues, “We had lunch. This picture is just her kissing me goodbye.”
“Oh, those aren’t the best ones. Not even close.” Greg says.
Draco snorts, “Potter was the star player. His team almost always beat mine and it was always his fault.” Draco pouts.
“Nope, looking at my boyfriend in quidditch gear is the only good thing about quidditch.”
“Of course, I did. Wait here.” Draco runs up the stairs. When he enters the bedroom, he realises that he’s still carrying the picture frame. He places it on the bedside table next to Harry’s side of the bed, next to Harry’s books. Draco has read them all as well now. He reads them when he wants to wait up for Harry. He grabs the scroll from the bed and runs back down the stairs. When he steps back into the kitchen Harry´s still staring at the camera. Draco clears his throat before speaking and Harry looks up at him and smiles. “It isn´t much,” Draco starts as he hands over the scroll, “But it has some sentimental value that I thought you might appreciate.”
“Why'd I have to break what I love so much? Please don’t walk away Harry, I love you. I do; I love you. Please just tell me that you're still mine, tell me that we'll be just fine even when I lose my mind. Tell me that it's not my fault, tell me that I'm all you want even when I break your heart.”
“Draco, I’m still so sorry. I, you. Have you thought about it? What did you decide?” Harry rambles.
“What kind of game?” Dean Thomas asks.
“I didn’t. Not really. Dan told me about Harry and I thought it be fun for us all the meet up. I actually thought Harry sounded more as someone for you then for me. I told Dan that, but I think he saw you and decided to try his luck. That’s what he always does you know. Try his luck.”
Hermione laughs too. “Changed your mind?” Theo asks hopeful.
He points at his friend.
Harry pushes him to the side and rushes inside. He slams the door shut. “Sorry ‘bout that, but I think a reporter was following me.”
Hermione laughs and bumps Theo with her elbow, “Maybe you should start playing quidditch too.”
Suddenly Dan’s weight gets lifted from Draco’s body. A metallic taste spreads in Draco’s mouth. Draco flicks his tongue over his bottom lip. Dan must have bitten on it because it’s bleeding.
“Oh, she does.” Greg says a big smile on his face.
“You alright there Draco?” Greg asks.
“I won’t end up with Ginny. I’ll never officially be a Weasley. And Ginny is not the one for me. Sure, I’d love it if my children go to Hogwarts together with ‘Moine’s if I ever have them. But I want them with you. I want it all with you.
When they reach Draco’s place, Potter pays the taxi driver, as Draco opens his door.
The last thing that Draco things before he falls asleep is that he hopes he never loses Harry. Hopes this never ends. Because that’s the kind of heartbreak time could never mend.
“Please, let me say this.”
“What’s going on Draco?” Greg asks as Pansy and Blaise turn to look at him confused.
“There's always a choice.”
“Dan come on!” Michael pulls him out of the car.
“Please Ron. distract me!”
“I was just trying to get him to join us.” Draco hears Dan say before the car door falls shut.
The other eight-year Slytherins recoil, “I really didn’t need to know that.” Theo says.
“Are you sure you’re going to wear that?” Avery asks nodding at the jacket, “It is quite warm out.”
They slip on either side of Draco and the blond actually glances to either of them, taking his eyes off off Potter. “What do you two want?”
As soon as he saw the sun come up the following morning, he knew he should have waited. He should have told Draco that he was leaving, instead of leaving him to wake up alone. Instead he ran away like a coward because it would hurt too much to say it face to face. But he couldn’t go back now. It wouldn’t make sense; Draco was probably mad at him anyway. It makes no sense to go back to start an argument just to leave him again.
“But, but-”
“Theo!” Blaise shouts astonished. He didn’t think Theo would betray his secrets so easily.
“I know,” Draco smiles. “Remember Dominique’s face when he saw you for the first time. It was spectacular.”
“toad? Yes, yes he did. At least trice. If not more.”
“Don’t hurt your head Potter just follow me.” They step out at the atrium and make their way to the Apparition point. “Side along?” Malfoy asks with a sideward glance.
Draco snorts and sips from his tea.
“Me?” Weasley looks around flustered, his faces turning red. “But I’m not. I mean I never, err I don’t”
Draco slams the evening issue of the prophet on the kitchen counter. He’s had a long and tiring day at the ministry, filing away old auror cases. Aurors kept checking up on him, he doesn’t know what they were thinking. What could Draco possibly do with the old, and then he means old, files.
“A suit?” Harry asks confused.
"I don't know. But now we know let's use it to our advantage." Blaise flashes Theo a smile, who grins back.
“Well there were a couple,” Harry waves his hand, “you know.”
Both of the boys stare daggers at their friends. But Blaise leans in again, pressing his lips more forcefully against Weasley’s. Who, surprisingly leans into Blaise’s embrace and kisses him back eagerly. When they pull apart Blaise walks back with a smile on his face.
“It’s late darling. Should I go with you and settle you in before you go to bed. A good night’s sleep will do you good.”
“What are the stakes?”
“I rent a place on Cornelia street.” Draco says casually in the back of the car. Harry sits next to him. They´re both drunk, but it feels like something stronger than the drinks in the bar.
Weasley nods, probably more to himself than anyone else, before standing up. Weasley is tall, but Blaise is taller, so he has to tilt his head to look into Blaise’s eyes. Hesitantly Blaise cups Weasley’s face and gently brushes his lips against Weasley's.
He knows that it makes his mother sad. That he doesn’t come over nearly as much as she would like. But Draco can barely stand to be inside the manor. The place where Voldemort, his awful snake and Draco’s own horrible aunt tormented him still haunts Draco in his dreams from time to time. Though he hasn’t had as bad night’s sleep since the first night he spent with Harry. The nights when Harry stays over are free from bad dreams at all. When Harry isn’t there, he’s in most of Draco’s dreams anyway.
“No, Pans. He
“You’re welcome,” Draco smiles.
“You bought this much because we need to replace your entire wardrobe,” Draco says as he looks confused at a very old pair of Dudley’s joggers before vanishing them with a huff, “And I went to Dominique today on my day off to pick all the items you would need. I just placed it on your account.”
Harry laughs,  “Once a week was not good enough for you?”
Harry runs up the steps as soon as the taxi drives away. As soon as they step inside, Potter pushes Draco against the door and kisses him, hard. Draco moans into Potter’s touch. All too soon, Potter pulls away. “If we’re going to do this, I think we should start over.” Harry says.
“Yes, but Theo you didn’t break me and Ron up.”
Harry stalks him in his dreams, his thoughts when he can’t find sleep, his daydreams during classes and all the meals. He’s even gone to calling him Harry in his mind. It needs to stop, but as Draco glances at Harry when he laughs at something Weasley says he can’t help the way his heart stutters and how he wants these feelings to never end. The way Harry’s eyes light up. The way he throws his head back, his unkept hair falling back and forth. His hands wrapped around his glass.
Draco scowls, “I don't read the Prophet Potter they only write fiction. Especially Rita Skeeter, who I guess wrote the article.”
Harry shrugs, “I don’t think-”
Ron snickers from further down the row when Harry promises he’ll go shopping.
“I did, thank you Gawain.” Harry tells Robards, but his eyes seek out the other person in the room. He sits in one of the two chairs opposite of Robards desk, his eyes on Harry and his hair in a neater style than that it was at the party. His throat and arms covered with the robes of an master healer. He looks curiously at Harry, “Hello Potter.” He says with a inclination of his head.
“Yes, why
After sitting at the kitchen table, staring in his cold cup of tea. Draco gets up and goes after Harry to the bedroom.
“Wait. Wait!” Theo catches his breath, “You said there were pictures of this.”
Draco shushes him with one of his charming smiles. “I’m still confused, but.”
“What have you been doing in Romania then Harry?” Luna asks curiously.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draco snorts. This guy clearly has no idea how Harry is in bed.
As soon as Draco is outside, he apparates to the first bar he can think of. Of course, it’s the bar he met Harry in all those months ago. But right now, he doesn’t care, he needs to drink. He was about to have a late lunch anyway.
to talk to you. Wait? Are you in bed?” footsteps come closer to the bed.
Harry presses kisses all over Draco’s stomach, before tentatively pressing a kiss on Draco’s prick. Draco can no longer hold back his moan. Which only seems to encourage Harry, who licks the length of Draco’s cock before taking the tip into his mouth and bobbing his head up and down and his tongue swirling the head.
“Do you want me to leave?” Harry catches Draco’s eye, sad confusion clear in his gaze.
“I didn’t think you were serious.” Harry mutters as he comes up on the other side of the pile. Draco seems to be sorting the pile of Harry shirts into two smaller piles. One of these two seems to be growing more steadily than the other. Harry watches as Draco grabs one of his shirts, looks at it and then puts it with the growing pile of shirts. “What´re you going to do with those?” Harry asks as he points to the pile.
“Yeah,”
“I was there yesterday with Seamus and Dean. Why didn’t you come along then?”
Draco ignores him and turns to Theo, “Theo?”
Okay the chapter lenght varies but I promise others will be longer !
“Draco what are you trying to prove?”
“You’re in my house.”
“Did he say bloke?” Weasley whispers a bit too loudly as Blaise stops before him.
“Sure, sure. A toad.” Avery eyes Harry.
Draco makes a cup of tea and leans against the kitchen counter opposite of his friends.
“Yes, you do,” Theo smirks, “You’re staring at the Gryffindor table.  It’s almost a pathetic as Draco over there.” Theo points over his shoulder at Draco a bit further down the table.
They order a large pizza to share from the Italian place on the corner. When it arrives, Harry opens the door and pays the deliverer and Draco grabs a bottle of wine and glasses. It’s still a warm night and they settle on a couple of pillows that Draco keeps there for nights just like these. They eat their food and sip their wine as they stare at the night’s sky and the stars that slowly blink into view.
“Well then Head auror Potter, you better have brought an expensive birthday gift for my girlfriend. Both of you! For the three you boys have missed.” Ginny smirks.
"I think this may be the one time I wish the wizarding world was more like the Muggle world. Nobody can arrest me for holding your hand," Draco smiled sweetly, and grabbed Harry's hand from across the table. Harry was about to respond, when he saw a family of three walk through the open door and his face drained of all colour as he attempted to duck under the table.
"I just wanted to say, I wish that you died when you 'fell off your broom'. Faggots don't deserve to live," he spat. "Now come on, Hermione, I don't want to be here anymore." Hermione then punched Ron square in the nose.
"It's just a bit ironic, really!" Harry grinned and when Draco tilted his head to the side, Harry turned with a pop into a black wolf with sparkling green eyes, a lightning scar barely visible on its forehead, only to be seen if you moved fur out the way. Draco started barking madly and Harry grinned, baring sharp teeth. Draco changed back and it turned out he was laughing.
Draco's face turned into one hug grin as he looked up to see Harry turning around and shoot him a smile. Draco bounded up the stairs to the seventh floor and entered the room, which was for some reason covered in pillows and blankets. Draco grinned to himself. Today he would accomplish something he had always wanted to do as a child....
"Someone has to be sensible here and make sure you all get to bed okay. Plus it wouldn't be very nice to not be able to find my way back to Gryffindor tower because I'm so drunk!" She insisted.
"I- I really thought that it was something real, that we had something, but it was all a foul trick! A fucking- I trusted him! It's mid November and I've already been through so much with him, I fell in love with him! And it was all just some stupid game," Harry growled. "But, what about the encanta bond?" Ginny asked. Harry made the heart appear on his wrist and saw with shock that it was completely black. "Black it goes when one falls out of love or life becomes barely endearing" Harry whispered, reciting what the book had said. "I guess both are true now."
"I lost all hope! Before, I was so desperate to cling onto something or someone worth living for and that was you. Of course, my Godfather came back but it's not the same as- as loving somebody" Harry took a deep breath and sighed heavily and Draco didn't speak.
"Okay, why did you and Ron break up? You two finally got together after years of him talking to us about you at night and then it just stops! Poof!" Seamus asked. Hermione went red and shrugged.
Harry and Draco spent the rest of their day inside the fort, not wanting to go to any lessons after the episode with Barton. Harry found it more embarrassing than anything, anyone would expect the boy who lived to not react in such pain he did.
"This is the monster in you? What about when you punched Dra-Malfoy in third year?" He asked, smirking slightly at the memory. "There's a difference between a monster and a beast, Harry." Hermione replied. They sat in silence for five minutes looking through laws, until Hermione spoke up. "Harry, you are straight, aren't you? I mean Ginny."
"Give the boy some air! Go on, move!" Draco shouted, his voice pumping with authority, and, quite afraid, the crowd dispersed quite quickly. "Thank you- can we- air, please?" Harry whimpered, trying his hardest not to just curl into Draco's side.
The photograph was of the kiss, but Draco's back was turned to the camera, only Harry's face was seen. "Well at least it doesn't show your face." Harry nodded. A letter fell in front of him and started to speak just like a couple of weeks ago.
"And what was interesting was that Harry has the dark heart whilst you have the light heart! The black represents a darkness within you, any kind of form whether it's evil or otherwise. I thought Draco would have had that considering his family and background but I guess it sort of makes sense that Harry has it after all we've discovered this year. And it's only November!" Hermione nodded and Draco looked like he too had discovered something that all made sense now but Harry still had no clue what was going on. "I'm sorry, what's the encanta bond and why do I have a fucking tattoo?" He snarled, agitated at the fact that he still didn't understand and nobody was helping.
"You." Draco smiled. Harry blushed and looked to his side at Draco who was staring right back. The blonde boy sat up and Harry followed these actions. "I have something I need to tell you." Draco said firmly, and Harry immediately started to worry, worst case scenarios playing through his head.
Harry started to head inside, after going to the owlery and writing a letter to the ministry. He needed to know who wasn't there anymore, as much as it killed him. People started throwing him looks, not mean looks, but not nice either. Harry spotted the Weasley's crouched over Fred's body, sobbing into each other. He walked forward a bit, and then sat by Remus and Tonks' bodies. The last marauder and his wife, gone. They had a child together, now orphaned just like Harry was. He pushed the thoughts of his little blue haired Godson out of his mind, and held Lupin's hand, tears threatening to fall.
Harry stared at the anonymous letter, trying to figure out who 'D' could be, before giving up and crawling into bed. Tomorrow would be a Saturday which means Vernon and Dudley would both be home all day. Harry lay there, wondering who could've wrote that letter and what on earth they wanted to talk about.
Draco got out his wand and pointed it at Harry, who didn't even as much as bat an eyelid. 'Do it!' Pansy's voice screeched. "I need to kill you, Potter." Draco growled. Harry opened up his arms as if to welcome the spell like an old friend. But then another voice came inside his head.
There was just one other figure in the courtyard, standing quite close. Draco. Harry looked at the pale blonde boy and didn't struggle as he was pulled into a hug. In fact, Harry just surrendered and burst into tears, sobbing into Draco's top.
"Really? I knew we had a cat, but I didn't know it was him." He admitted. "So where is everyone? Hermione, Draco? Heard you made up with Ron as well. How are things?" Harry nodded and sighed. "Ron and I are working on it. I think he thinks we've completely made up, but I'm still keeping an eye on him and I'm pretty sure Hermione is too. What he did was absolutely horrible. Everyone is in Hogsmeade, but I didn't feel like going."
At once, all of Harry's worries we're back in his head again. "POST!" A third year boy suddenly shouted and all the eighth years nursed their heads again, braving themselves for the screeching of the owls. "Hangovers are the worst," Seamus complained as the owls flew overhead. "I don't really mind them." Harry shrugged as a letter fell onto his plate.
"How dare you show your face here boy! And that- that abnormal stick of yours just lying on the table, out in the open? And holding hands with a boy!" Harry whimpered and Draco leaped up, preparing to drag the man off of Harry. "Should've known you would become a faggot! You're already fucked up enough as it is!" A smaller but still rather large boy snarled, joining his father and taking his place holding Harry up. "Get off of him!" Draco said, letting out an animalistic growl and attempting to grab at the boy.
He opened them when he felt someone sit at the end of his bed. "I'm sorry, I must look pathetic," Harry mumbled. "No, I'm the one that's sorry. I got too carried away. I just get angry." Harry nodded and they sat in silence for a minute.
Food appeared along every table and Harry watched as everyone started to pile their plates up. Harry himself, just took a piece of bread and slowly picked crumbs off of it. Hermione and Ron looked at him with just his bread and shared curious glances. "Is that all your going to eat mate? You do know this is never going to run out, right?" Ron chuckled. Harry just nodded, put the bread back on his plate and drank a couple of cups of water.
Harry sobbed as Mrs Weasley pulled him into a hug. He could feel her sorrow as she hugged him and pushed away. "You don't need to be sorry Harry. I'm just glad your okay." She said, reading his thoughts, then turned back to her son. Harry got up and walked away, unable to watch as they mourned over Fred. He couldn't even bare to look at George, knowing how lost he must feel to have his other half ripped away.
To say Sirius looked shocked was an understatement. "The- the Malfoy boy is your friend?" Harry gulped and stared past Draco. "Yes. But, Sirius, he-"
For a while, Harry had forgotten that Draco was still a part of Slytherin house. For starters, the eighth year tower brought all houses together as they'd have to live with one another for a year. Secondly, Draco wasn't the young school bully he used to be. He was kind and gentle with Harry, and although sometimes he fell back into bad habits, Harry was there to help.
A thin man with long scraggly black hair and multiple tattoos stood in front of the desk. "Y- you- you're supposed to be-" Harry choked. "Dead?" Harry's Godfather, Sirius Black replied.
So when everybody had left, Harry headed towards the library to gather up some things for his potions essay. He found a book that looked like it would help him and flicked through a few of its pages. "Just a recipe book, helpful!" Harry scoffed and was about to put it back when it fell onto a page that made his heart stop.
"Hey!" Harry laughed, and booped Draco's shiny black nose. The two boys sat in silence until Harry started laughing. Draco turned in shock at the sudden outburst but Harry was still chuckling and sort of rolling his eyes. Draco barked as if to say 'What?'
"Wake up you little bastard!" Came the booming voice of Uncle Vernon through Harry's bedroom door. "Get up and make us breakfast!" Harry slowly got up and listened to Vernon's loud, stomping steps die away. He pulled off his pyjama top and looked at himself in the mirror.
Harry sniffled, wiping his eyes and Draco held Harry's hand behind his back, going unnoticed by George. "From then on, it turned into more and more. Breaking too many bones, slaving away for them, getting my food supply cut off for a month at a time. They always found a different way to punish me. Hogwarts was my escape, until the war that is. After the war, my depression consumed me and I had to go back to live with the Dursley's,"
Draco lead him to a fireplace where they were transported to Muggle London. "Harry, look at me," Draco whispered. "I need you to calm down, gem. Focus on your breathing, match it up with mine." He said as Harry slowly nodded and focused his everything on the boy in front of him.
"Ow! What was that for?" He whined, clutching his raw red face. "For being a complete and utter arse! You have some nerve showing your face back here, you have no idea what the impact was on not only Harry, but the rest of us too! Draco got no sleep whatsoever worrying, Hermione spent her nights alone, crying herself to sleep and me- you have no idea." She growled.
"Give it up, Draco. You fooled me once, you aren't going to fool me again. You've had your fun now leave me alone." Harry croaked, his eyes watering slightly. "But- but what about our bond, check your wrist!" Draco said hopeful that this would prove he was telling the truth.
The next day, Harry headed down to breakfast early and by himself, leaving a sleeping Draco behind. He sat by himself in the pretty much empty hall, picking up some fruit. Harry had preferred to go by himself at breakfast when hardly anybody was there, because that is when he had to take his potions.
Harry put his hand in his pocket and felt that it wasn't there anymore. "You carry that around? Are you mental! You told me you didn't have it anymore, that you lost it!" Draco growled. "You knew about this and you didn't help! Of course you didn't help, you're a Malfoy. Get off Harry, now, just because you have to share a room doesn't mean you get to act like you and Harry have been best friends since first year," George snarled.
“What? Why? Don’t you want me to-”
“I-I like you,” Theo hurries out the pounding of his heart against his ribs sounds louder than the words that come out of his mouth. “And I wanted a chance with you so I went to Blaise, who’s been infatuated with Weasley since forever, and I asked him to flirt with Weasley I could get time with you. But then Potter was there all the time either with you or with Weasley, so we asked Draco for help. Because like everyone knows he’s head over heels for Potter and Potter can’t seem to let Draco alone. But then Pansy got involved and we kissed, and Blaise said he and Weasley kissed. And it’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have-”
“What are you on about? You should have taken that hangover potion yourself, Potter!”
“No one is as pathetic as Draco,” Blaise states and Theo looks back at the dark skinned Slytherin.
“Want to bet?”
Draco smirks and takes his hands, “Draco.”
Draco throws on a t-shirt and steps into a clean pear of boxers. He all but runs down the stairs and throws open the double doors. but Harry isn’t there. The kitchen and living room are dead. Autumn air blowing through the open windows.
“If you win, you get to join me in the shower afterwards?”
Good Theo thinks, Blaise’s not denying it, so he read him correctly. Now he can start part two of his plan. But Blaise stands up and stalks out of the great hall.
“Harry Potter?!” Michael squeaks.
“Malfoy don’t let Dan ruin your night. He’s a prat.”
“Yeah,” Ronald narrows his eyes, “I don’t know what you’re on about.”
“Want to play a seeker game?” Draco asks.
him. Sure, Pansy made friends with Lavender Brown and the Patil sisters over their love for gossip. And Theo has found a study buddy in Granger. Greg, surprisingly, has been hanging out with Hufflepuffs. Trying to fill a Vincent shaped hole with Hufflepuff fluff and kindness. Draco however, not so surprisingly, hasn’t made any new friends.
“You okay?” Harry asks, his breath against his throat.
“Yes, it is,” Draco decides to try the same, “Harry.”
“More like 7.”
“Oh,”
“I didn't.” Draco says and Harry sighs in relief. “You did.”
“Oh, yes. Constantly.” Blaise throws Theo a smile over Draco’s shoulder.
“Yeah, is it in good condition?”
Draco frowns and rubs his left forearm.
“Strip.”
“My grandfather is an expert on sedative potions, and Draco had an internship with him for a couple of months. And when he lived in Berlin, we saw each other quite often.”
“It’s just. They are both single,”
“And how exactly do you know
“You know what Draco? Fuck you!” Harry interrupts Draco’s rant and storms out of the kitchen, slamming the door behind him.
In the chair next to him Malfoy snorts, but when Harry looks at him he doesn’t look back and doesn’t say anything more.
He went back to the office, but he didn’t get any work done. He couldn’t concentrate. Ginny’s words circled through his mind. Hers and Ron’s and Hermione’s and Mrs. Weasleys. And all the other Weasley’s who supported their relationship in the past. Even Fred. Though all he could see when he closed his eyes was Draco’s sleepy face looking up at him, his eyes sparkling and his lips pink. His hair mussed, like it only was in bed. Only Harry ever saw him like this, and he loved that. He loved that Draco let himself be seen like this only with Harry around. And Draco was so gorgeous, but when he was like that, sleep ruffled in Harry arms he was the most beautiful.
“Sure I guess.” Harry shrugs, “The Leaky?”
“He’s just so …
“Well he didn’t date perse. But all the guys he did see were all blonde and tall and bossy.”
“What’s this?”
Theo sighs and pulls his Transfiguration essay in front of him again. And he tries not to stare at Hermione. Normally, when it’s just the two of them, he’s pretty good at that. But with Weasley sitting there it’s hard not to. His eyes keep trailing back to the couple.
“I’m never going there again. I’m never walking that street again.”
“Don’t be a wuss Harry,” Granger says grabbing Theo’s arm. “We’re off to the library.” She pulls Theo behind her off through the door.
“You sure you don't want to stay for a drink?” Harry asks as he sits up. He can't explain it, but he feels the need to make sure Draco will stay just a little bit longer.
“No, they broke up,” Pansy who sat down on Blaise’s other side whispers, “weeks ago. You would have known that if you listened to me and showed up earlier.”
“Okay.” Michael stands up, “Okay!” He says more to himself than to Draco and Potter, “Wish me luck.” He says before stalking determinedly to the bar.
“Ah, I guess since you’ve been away you might not have heard. But I’m being promoted to head of Magical law Enforcement and I’ve been tasked with finding my replacement as Head Auror.” When  Harry doesn’t say anything Robards continues, “I’ve picked you Harry.”
, realised Draco. He had hardly thought about what time it might’ve been, and the fact that it was a school morning, and that he and Blaise were currently sprawled out on the two common room sofas with not one item of clothing on between them.
in the bathroom. Would that be so bad?
came pretty easily… when you had your eyes on my arse,’ sniggered Blaise. ‘Fine then. How many people do you think you’ll sleep with before I can coerce Daphne?’
‘Malfoy? What are
,’ she stressed, ‘it’s important that you rest for at least an hour, while the potion wears off.’
‘Take the hand away,’ ordered Draco, taking another step in Fred’s general direction.
‘Harry … Harry … HARRY!’
‘You are
‘Charming. I’ve always wondered how blood traitors like yourself jerk off.’
The blond boy tried desperately to cover himself up.
From across the room, Draco admired his mate’s slightly dishevelled hair; the way the sweaty strands mopped down over his handsome forehead, how they shifted a millimetre every time he parted his lips to exhale. A sleek curtain of tight black curls that brilliantly matched the boy’s armpit hair and pubes. Speaking of which…
Fred looked for a second as though he were going to say something in retort, but then his face relaxed and, very reluctantly, he gave in. With one hand he dropped the bread to the bathroom floor, and with the other he instantly covered up his groin.
‘Who’s the poof now?’ he jeered.
Madam Pomfrey whimpered a bit. ‘Pl- please, little Draco,’ she moaned softly, ‘please do it.’
‘If you don’t want to be here, feel free to skedaddle. I didn’t ask for a bloody audience.’
‘Won’t work,’ muttered the younger boy. He propped himself up on both elbows, downcast. His eyes caught sight of something then, and an idea popped into his head at the same time that it popped into George’s.
‘You needn’t call me that, I’m not a Professor. The potion takes away all sensation from one particular limb; in this case, the arm. Let us say are left alone with your arm completely numb… all alone, Mr Malfoy… what might you do?’
are you doing?’ exclaimed a stunned Draco.
love to know.’
Both dicks were pressed against Fred’s stomach, causing the redhead unspeakable pain that neither of the other two cared much about. They forced themselves in and out, Draco revelling in the pressure applied to his cock from all angles. George could now not only feel Fred’s limp cock pressed against his sweaty body, but he could feel his own cock prodding himself through Fred’s clenched torso. Fred bounced up and down on the two tops, making a strange humming noise, like a muted howl.
He moaned loudly and unashamedly, watching as a fifth glob of cum leaked from his still-hard prick. Now that the overwhelming pleasure had mostly ebbed away, Draco became suddenly aware of the fact that his neck felt strained, and that there was a painful cramp in one of his feet. The noise of students’ footfall and incessant gibbering also seemed to have grown much louder. The first double session must have already ended, he thought. He looked up at Madam Pomfrey.
fucking gay, mate,’ laughed Blaise.
‘Just take it slowly, you know. She’s probably got at least a couple of other guys on the go at the moment, so if you actually want to be her one and only, my bet is you’ll have to get closer first.’
‘By all means, then, wank yourself silly afterwards,’ said George, looking desperately down at his erection.
Draco sat up slightly. ‘What, you’ve never put it inside yourself?’
‘Our brother Charlie gave us the password years ago; he was a Prefect. Fred, Lee and I have been sneaking in and using it for… well, business.’
George scrunched up his eyes and looked down at his throbbing cock. He was desperate to cum. ‘Y- you,’ he admitted, glancing at Malfoy’s washboard abs, and then letting his eyes follow the snail trail of curly blond hairs down to the Slytherin’s beautiful prick.
‘Please, Harry!’
‘Harper.’ The name left Draco’s mouth and he pressed his tongue against the back of his teeth after the last syllable. ‘What’re you doing up?’
. He had not yet realised the extent to which his cock was enjoying itself this morning. Unlike Blaise’s member, which was apparently still serenely fast asleep, his own currently stood at full mast, at a perfect right angle to his body, throbbing eagerly as though it were begging for relief.
‘Blaise, I admire your eagerness, but you do know that I’ll most likely be hooking up with someone before midday tomorrow.’
‘Huh?’
‘Wow,’ said the boy. And then he was stroking his little prick again, much harder and much faster than he had the first time, his eyes gazing hungrily at Draco’s cock. Witnessing the whole scene, Draco felt a strange desire to howl aloud in ecstasy. He glanced at his own member, still stiff as a pole, and wondered for a moment whether he was about to cum without even touching it.
The matron returned a minute later, carrying a large glass phial which held a thick, blueish liquid. She uncorked it and told Malfoy to open wide. The Numbing Draught tasted like cardboard or parchment, the blandness of it stripping Draco’s tongue of all flavour. For a second he thought that it was his tongue that had been made numb. After a little while, however, he began to sense something happening to his arm. A gush of warmth seemed to spread throughout the limb, followed by a fuzzy sensation that instantly put an end to the slight pain he had been experiencing all morning. After three minutes, Draco realised that he could no longer feel anything with his right arm. Even the bedsheets that it was resting on seemed far distant.
‘Oh no, not just yet,’ said Draco. ‘I’m going to have to taste it.’
‘I’ll make it worth your while.’
Draco smiled, but before he had had a chance to say anything, Harper had thrown another question at him.
‘Sorry, Professor. I’ll get them back.’ He reached over to the floor and picked up his wand, purposely flexing the muscles in his chest and arms for her enjoyment. Directing the wand at the pile of robes beside his bed, he said, ‘
of this to anyone, you understand?’
‘Or what, Weaselbee? What will you do?’ Draco retorted, pouting. ‘Personally, I think “Fred the Food Fucker” has a
On his way back to the common room, Draco, knowing that the common room would surely be flooded with students by the time he returned, had ducked into a dungeon classroom that was sometimes used by Professor Burbage and her Muggle Studies class. True to his hopes, in the store cupboard there was an array of mismatched Muggle clothing. Draco had donned an oversized poncho and a pair of board shorts, the least ridiculous-looking outfit he’d sourced from the collection. It felt unbecoming to wear Muggle clothing, and he had faced several stunned looks from fellow Slytherins as they passed him, but he had a strong feeling that it would’ve been more unbecoming to arrive fully naked and painted with the dried cum of a thirteen-year-old.
‘Fuck off you prick,’ retorted Draco. ‘You wanted me to enjoy that, admit it.’
‘Professor Slughorn, if I’m not much mistaken. Your father was lucky. Slughorn was never one for harsh punishment.’
Harper’s body stunned Draco almost into silence. He’d been vaguely aware of the boy’s cuteness back when he was first confronted by him in the common room, but he’d never dreamed that the kid would be so beautiful underneath his robes…
‘I recall many a time when students have taken the potion and have later been discovered touching themselves in classes, or else in corridors, desperate to put their numb arm to good use; too self-assured to worry about the consequences. I believe, from what my predecessor once told me, that your father was one such case. He was unable to resist the temptation in the middle of Hogsmeade, I believe. He’d left straight from the hospital wing in a rush to visit the Three Broomsticks with his friends. I’m impressed to this day that he managed to get halfway there before the trousers were finally unbuttoned.’
‘FUCK!’
. You had your first fuck in
‘Lee’s not here, though,’ Malfoy pointed out.
‘Are you wearing panties?’ he asked smoothly, biting his bottom lip and gazing up at the woman perched on his bed. Madam Pomfrey shook her head. Draco laughed. ‘Good,’ he said, ‘then let’s get on with it, yes, Professor?’
‘I thought it couldn’t have gone better,’ Blaise retorted. ‘I’ll ask her on a date soon. You should hurry up, Draco.’
‘Not that,’ said Harper, ‘it’s just-’
‘Probably not the only thing he’s giving Potter.’
But the older boy felt the position wasn’t quite fun enough for him to end it all here. He lifted Harper off the desk, picking him up by the feet, and held the boy’s legs under his armpits, pulling the boy into wheelbarrow. Without warning, he thrust his length back into Harper, and kept slamming his hard cock in and out of the hole. But no matter how hard or fast he fucked the boy, Harper made no signs of wanting it to stop. Draco kept pounding, and now he was reaching his second climax. He thrust himself in one last time, before slipping his cock out and jizzing all over the boy’s underbelly.
‘More naked, tied up and with their mouths open.’
doing? You’re not a Prefect!’ said Fred.
‘-Anyway, what d’you reckon?’ finished Blaise, coming to the close of a rather long-winded sentence.
fuck yes – cum all over my cock –
‘What d’you mean?’ Draco said, still working his cock.
‘But,’ continued the boy, ‘when- when it’s soft, well… it’s a bit less majestic, isn’t it.’
‘Come on, Weaselbee,’ teased Draco. ‘Tell me… what exactly have you always wanted to do with him? With your brother?’ Draco walked over to Fred’s body and, kneeling down, stuck his forefinger into Fred’s mouth. The older boy sucked on it obediently, and waves of pleasure ebbed and flowed through Draco’s body, allowing his cock to harden again.
‘Mmhm. You should really see someone about it.’ responded Blaise.
Rolling over on to his left side, Malfoy traced a finger slowly between George’s pecs and down to his pale torso. It was almost a romantic gesture, he thought. It didn’t take long before George was thoroughly confused, however. He threw the Slytherin a raised eyebrow. Malfoy decided to take things a step further, and he placed his right leg over George’s, practically spooning him. Pulling a sweetly seductive face, he slowly climbed on top of the redhead.
perceived there was something odd about her being so happily widowed seven times. All the same, because he highly doubted his own mother was plotting to sleep with him and rob him of his petty savings, Blaise had merrily taken on her advice and kept his hair as it was.
‘I don’t,’ he said.
; not to take your robes off!’ she said anxiously, storming towards his hospital bed. Draco couldn’t help but notice that her eyes were glued to his upper body.
Grinning, Draco gripped his cock again, this time with his left hand. With his right, he guided her down towards it. The head of his shaft slipped easily inside of her, and the rest of it soon followed.
screw you, she’ll most likely enjoy it.’
of a slag.’
‘Fuck, I- I can explain,’ spluttered Fred, his face still flushed.
like it, you little poofter,’ said Fred, and Draco felt his arsehole being stretched open by something thick and hard. For all his sexual promiscuity, only once had he ever been on the receiving end like this. Fred thrust his cock deeper into Draco, the younger boy suddenly forced into submission.
‘Mm, you might just have me there,’ laughed Draco.
She turned on her heel and quickly disappeared into her office. Malfoy went to roll up his sleeve: it felt peculiar, the fingers on his left hand brushing his right arm without the right arm sensing it. Before he could push the sleeve beyond his elbow, however, the blond boy changed his mind rather suddenly. Using mainly his left arm, he propped himself up on the pillows and skilfully lifted his Slytherin robes over his head. He reflected for a moment that he’d clearly had too much experience undressing.
‘Exactly. And whilst there are no school rules against students exploring the carnal possibilities that certain medical remedies present, so long as they do it privately, the problem doesn’t stop there. The potion also, you’ll soon find, gives the taker a feeling of extreme confidence. Confidence that all too frequently, I’m afraid, leads to recklessness.’
‘No, don’t be such an arse. We were… experimenting.’
‘Studying to do?’
The matron slid a trembling hand back down his chest, and Draco guided it towards his cock. She twirled her fingers around his curly blond pubes, tugging on them like reins.
‘Malfoy, fu- fuck me,’ George whispered. Draco slid himself into George’s smooth hole and found it more cavernous than he had expected. He was able to thrust forward with much ease, and soon found himself bucking his hips back and forth at a pace that he could only keep up for short intervals of time. George was panting hard, his arse cheeks red from the force of Draco’s flesh slapping against his own. Draco began taking his dick out completely after each thrust and ploughing it back in on the next, but even that couldn’t deliver the resistance that he needed.
‘How was it?’ he said.
‘You look pretty good yourself,’ said Malfoy, and without warning he gently pushed Fred backwards into the water. Fred sat up with his face covered in pink bubbles and spat out a mouthful of liquid.
George came first, making a loud and violent noise as soon as his dick erupted. His balls slapped against Draco’s rigid cock, filling Fred with ropes of cum that covered the younger boy’s cock. Globs of it seeped out between the two pricks, and the feeling of George’s sticky fluid running down his shaft was enough to send Malfoy into his own orgasm. The blond boy upped the speed of his thrusts, panting, ‘You like that, don’t you, you little slut? You little Gryffindor whore.’ He came deep inside Fred, his cum far runnier now on his third load that night. Overcome by pleasure, his whole body shuddered. He got a cramp in his feet. After Fred’s pussy had clamped tight around his cock, squeezing every last drop out of it, he lifted the ginger boy off his softening prick and lowered him to the ground.

‘What the-? Get out!’ spat Fred, spinning around before the door had fully closed behind Draco. Unable to stop himself, Malfoy’s eyes gravitated instantly to the Weasley boy’s groin. Fred had been standing there, stark naked, fucking a…
‘Oh yes,’ said Madam Pomfrey. ‘Broken bones are not a rarity at Hogwarts. The potion has been taken by many students over the years.’
‘Y- yes, Mr Malfoy,’ whispered Madam Pomfrey, her voice silvery.
‘I like feeling my thing up against my robes,’ said Harper. ‘It feels nice.’
The pair of them soon hooting with laughter, Draco grabbed the cushion from underneath his feet and chucked it aggressively across the room at Blaise’s head. Blaise was quick, catching it mid-air and pulling it to his chest. He threw the cushion to Draco, who instantly flung it back in the same direction as earlier. By the time they’d recollected themselves and the laughter had died down, a grin started to spread across Blaise’s face.
‘Found it in the Restricted Section yesterday,’ Blaise said proudly. ‘Got a note from Snape. I put a charm on the writing.’
‘Come, we’ll find a classroom or something.’
The last leg of the journey saw him tiptoe along the fifth-floor corridor, keeping his eyes peeled for the statue of Boris the Bewildered. Boris turned out to be a rather lost-looking wizard with gloves on the wrong hands, and once Draco had passed the statue he took a step towards the door that, according to Cedric, would open to the Prefects’ bathroom. Leaning right up against it, Malfoy whispered, ‘Pine-fresh’. The door did not open, but a word began to appear in bold letters, carving itself into the wood:
In Draco’s opinion, it was well and truly too late at night to be having this conversation. The day prior had been far from relaxing, and for the last few hours now he’d wanted nothing more than to head upstairs to bed, in the hopes of getting a relatively decent night’s rest. The only reason he was willing to ignore these urges was that, to some extent, he actually
He couldn’t keep going much longer. There was a tingling in his cock that felt magical. He pulled out of her just in time and erupted all over the matron’s front, thick strands of cum squirting fountain-like up on to her robes.
yes,’ moaned Draco. ‘Come on, faster.’
‘Malfoy, I-’ began George.
‘Suck on it,’ said the Slytherin boy, and she bent her head down towards his cock. Quicker than he had expected, she took all six inches of him down her throat, and started to bob her head up and down.
‘Who?
And now the satin sheets on which he lay, which rubbed against his supple backside and tickled his toes, grew suddenly softer and warmer. They were no longer emerald like the ones in his dormitory and in the bedrooms at Malfoy Manor, but a deep red that matched the silk charmeuse sheets of Gryffindor Tower. They felt like liquid … innately sensual and physically gratifying, and, in one of the short pauses Potter gave between sentences, Draco found himself wondering how the Gryffindor students ever got to sleep at night without being continuously aroused.
to pass her a frog.’
‘Well, you know. They… up in the Slytherin dorms, in the younger years, they call you… well, they call you the
‘You can stop there. I’m afraid your efforts have been wasted,’ said the matron, and she got to her feet. ‘I cannot have students pleasuring themselves in the hospital wing.’
‘My father took the potion?’ asked Draco.
Draco could not see how he would survive this … every word, every painfully illustrative sentence flashed like a bright light in front of his eyes, pulling him closer towards something that was surely death …
‘D- Draco,’ she wailed. ‘Draco… I’m… little Draco, I’m going to cum… I’m going to…’
‘I want-,’ started Harper, opening his eyes. ‘I want you to cum on me too. Rub it on me.’
She turned away from him but continued talking. ‘I’ve found there is a tendency among boys your age to… well, to get
Draco did as he was told, placing his right arm carefully on the sheets with his palm facing upwards. Madam Pomfrey pulled a wand from her robes, and prodded his wrist gently with the tip of it. Running it slowly along the length of his forearm, she began to mutter the incantations for various healing charms. Draco observed that she was trying very hard to not take her eyes away from where her wand was pointed.
After a minute or so, she lowered her wand and darted her eyes quickly towards Draco’s face, eager not to linger on any other part of his body.
‘Shit, Malfoy,’ said the older boy. ‘Not that it makes me any more into this, but you’re proper fit.’ Draco looked down at his body and nodded. The dancing candlelight only flattered his already well-defined muscles; his abs looked smooth and perfect, his pecs taut and his nipples pink.
Harry gritted out.
‘Listen, it’s not my proudest moment, Malfoy,’ said Fred. ‘Now if that’s all, please piss off and let me get dressed again. And not a
"Now everything is just about me being The Harry Potter, one day I'm gonna change my last name out of pure spite."
"Let me guess, it contains the words Death Eater?"
"They are."
Draco ordered, not bothering to ask how Harry liked his tea he practically knew it off by heart by now.
"How are we getting there?" Harry asked.
"Thanks."
"Are you gonna tell me?"
"You with a muggle phone I never thought I'd see the day." Harry gasped in fake shock.
"Hi Teddy, had a good day?" He asked scooping the boy into a hug.
This chapter contains two references to Draco trying to scrub away at his Dark mark so just be aware of that.
Draco sighed and placed his head on Harry's shoulder, Harry wrapped his arm round Draco and rubbed his arm gently.
Saturn was probably the most well behaved Draco had ever seen him. He'd practiced his piano scales and even asked Draco to play the piano with him which was something very new, he'd set the table perfectly, gone to bed on time without fuss and there had been zero tantrums all week, Draco was considering trying out this bribery thing more often. When Tuesday rolled around he decided he should probably call Harry and check if he was available on Thursday. The phone rang twice before Harry picked up.
Harry was drastically trying to tame his messy hair. He'd never really been able to tame the thick black hair it just kind of did what it wanted and ignored everything Harry wanted it to do. Teddy was sat on the floor next the large mirror playing with Max, honestly for a cat that hated everyone he put up with Teddy extremely well. Harry looked at his watch cursing quietly under his breath, he was supposed to be at Draco's in five minutes and he was still deciding what he was wearing. Ron had been begging him to go out for months, he'd finally agreed to go to a muggle club with him and Hermione although he wasn't really looking forward to it, he knew twenty minutes in he'd be sat at the bar on his own third wheeling his best friends as per usual. He sighed tugging off his shirt, reaching for the black button up strewn across his bed. The shirt was tight, it clung to him almost uncomfortably hugging every curve of his body. He shoved the access of fabric into his tight jeans, he traced the bisexual symbol he had tattooed in the lower left corner of his stomach. Harry had two tattoos, his first had been the small symbol as a celebration of his coming out to himself and his self acceptance, the next was on the right side of his chest, it was of a stag and a doe in black and grey, the two animals were intertwined with each other. He was wearing a black Button up and black skinny jeans with a denim jacket and a pair of black Doc Martin's he examined his appearance in the mirror, content he picked Teddy up off the floor and placed him on his hip then he tossed the child's backpack over his shoulder and moved to the floo.
Harry turned to leave the office, Draco leaning against the door frame.
"It's okay, it's gonna be okay." He played with Harry's curls desperately trying to sooth him.
The red panda exhibition was as cute as it sounded the boys itching to get a look from higher up. Harry almost instinctively picked Saturn up to see the pandas pointing them out to him. Draco smiled to see Harry treating his son almost if he was his own, picking up an excited Teddy to do the same. The four walked around for the rest of the morning the boys holding hands between the two of them. The occasional old lady would side eye the small family but for the most part they went unnoticed. The kids had got hyped up on sugar during the picnic and had run around the field getting their energy out, Draco hoped to Merlin they'd be calm by the time they got back. As he hoped the boys had fallen fast asleep in the car on the way back.
"Yeah he's always been quite shy, he gets it from Astoria."
It was another ten minutes before Harry finally lifted his head from Draco shoulder wiping his tears away with his sleeve.
"And you and It's Ginny isn't it?"
Draco rested Harry's elbow on the table turning to collect a variety of potions from the cabinet.
"Harry, perfect a little late but it's fine shall we go?" Hermione's voice rang through the quiet flat.
"Just once I'd like to not be the bad guy."
Harry showed up at the cottage around twelve.
"Sick of me already?"
"Not that you care."
As if he could hear them Harry appeared through the floo holding Teddy to his chest so the blue haired boy didn't inhale any floo powder.
"Thanks you're easy to talk to."
It'd been two weeks since Harry's encounter with Draco. The two had by no means been avoiding each other and Saturn was regularly at Andromeda's house when Harry was there but he never stayed round long enough to see the blond return from work, he knew from the pale green scrubs Draco wore under his leather jacket the first time they'd met since the war that he worked at St. Mungo's but that was the extent of his knowledge on his former classmates occupation. Just because they didn't cross in paths didn't mean that Draco Malfoy didn't cross Harry's complex thoughts in fact it was a rather regular occurrence, in fact his mind had found itself wondering while Harry was cooking that cold Tuesday morning. Harry's thoughts drifted back to their meeting. Draco's hair had been shoved into a messy bun with his wand jabbed through it, a few strands had fallen loose framing his sharp jawline, he held a less arrogant stance than he had during Hogwarts, Harry assumed he had been greatly humbled by the war. Another small detail Harry noticed was the scar that reached just below his jawline which then dipped under his scrubs and another that peaked out from the v neck of them. The final thing Harry had noticed in his thirty seconds of staring was his eye's, they were a shocking silver at first glance but after a while felt more like a warm grey like the clouds on a cool day.
"I joined the Aurors, it wasn't too bad but everything felt like the war again, hunting down death eaters and all that." He looked towards the blond and mumbled an apology at the Death Eater comment.
"Me and Saturn are going to the zoo on Thursday and he would like Teddy to come."
"Just a bad night, that's all." Harry tried to put on a brave smile for the child.
Andromeda gave him a kind smile before rushing out the house.
Harry nodded as if to say he understood.
"That ass should be bloody illegal." He mumbled, cupping his tea in his now free hands. Pansy picked up her own mug.
"You don't like, like me or anything do you?" Ron said.
Harry downed the potion grimacing at the taste.
"I thought we were talking about you." Draco argued.
"In about two minutes." Draco said looking at his pocket watch. The watch had been a gift from his mother when he turned seventeen, it was a simple silver embellished with a gorgeous dragon, the inside was pure gold with beautiful clockwork behind the glass face.
"Excuse me!"
"It was nice to see you again Draco."
Draco shrugged.
"If it's any consolation the name Malfoy isn't the greatest either."
"I shouldn't, I don't sleep well alone, it's why I got a cat."
"I think I should get this one into bed." He slung his backpack over his other shoulder careful not to wake the boy.
We do not support Jk Rowling.
"You've got to admit they are quite cute." Draco said taking a photo with his phone.
"One more thing."
"Hi biscuit, have you been good today?"
Draco and Harry don't get to enjoy the lie in they wanted to and things go sour when Draco takes a Patient for a head injury.
"Really? Are you actually fucking joking me? I give in, I quit." He raised his hands in surrender and stormed out of the apartment, apperating to the only place he thought he might be able to find some form of comfort. Draco was curled up on his sofa with a book in his oversized hoodie and sweatpants, he'd just put a rather fussy Saturn down for the second time and was taking a moment to himself, the sound of the door being pounded on snapped him away from his book. Harry stood on his doorstep wiping tears away from under his glasses with the side of his sleeve. Silver grey eyes locked forest green tear filled ones when Draco opened the door to the old house.
The boy looked up. ‘Madam Hooch’s tits?’ he said, cocking an eyebrow.
‘Well, now you can,’ Draco sneered. ‘How’d you both find this place, anyway?’
‘More what?’
‘That’s it,’ said Draco, and he allowed her hand to trail down from his pecs to his abdomen, her fingers running over every one of his taut muscles. With a little encouragement from him, she climbed on to the bed, her hand still on his chest. ‘Do you do this often with your patients?’ he asked, and she shook her head.
‘Wait,’ realised Draco. ‘Fuck… no, don’t do that.’
The two boys were submerged fully in the waist-deep pool, wrestling with their naked bodies pressed firmly up against one another. Draco attached his mouth to Fred’s, biting, kissing and sucking. His hands found Fred’s prick and rubbed it aggressively, so that Fred’s moans were audible even underwater. He pulled the foreskin back as far as it would go and vigorously wanked it. The ginger boy tried desperately to push Draco away from him, but Draco’s strength was superior. Together the pair surfaced, wet and coated in bubbles, breathing heavily. Fred tried again, and this time succeeded, at pushing the blond boy away from him. He swam quickly to the edge of the pool, but before he could clamber out, Malfoy had grabbed him around the torso and jumped on his back. Malfoy’s rock-hard member nestled itself neatly between Fred’s arse cheeks, and the younger boy grinded his cock up against them while Fred protested loudly, fists flailing in anger.
She turned towards her office, but Draco wasn’t finished. He had one last proposal to put forward.
Madam Pomfrey raised an eyebrow; Draco continued to speak in the same hushed voice.
‘That’s because he’s
Malfoy picked his black boxers up off the floor and threw them across to Blaise, who lay them out on the sofa beneath him.
‘Now, can you get yourself hard? It’ll help get you in the mood, that’s all.’
‘Oh, heavens no. But it would be painful if I were to mend it straight away… very painful, and knowing how you reacted to that silly little hippogriff attack last year-’
Draco shook his head. ‘I can’t cum. There’s not enough friction.’
. But then the stone wall started to close over the passage behind him, and it was too late.
‘I’ll um… show you, if you want,’ Draco continued.
Draco’s heart leapt. Maybe Potter
‘Yeah,’ said Draco, ‘why not. You look hard enough.’
, or something like that.’
‘Bet you love that, don’t you? All of us boys coming here with Quidditch injuries, begging you to fix us. Bet you wish you could fuck all of us.’
‘Fuck’s sake, Malfoy,’ said the ginger boy, but he did as he was told. Draco marvelled at Fred’s semi-erect cock, licking his lips subconsciously. It was much longer than he had anticipated, but with an impressive girth as well. Probably seven inches erect, he thought, or maybe even eight.
"We should've gone back, just to make sure he didn't do that to anybody else," Harry said quietly. "Harry, you don't need to be there to save the day every time. There are loads of people in there who are capable of fighting back!" Draco argued.
"Hangover effects? I did drink probably more than all of you combined," he chuckled awkwardly. Harry got a few feeble nods but Hermione still stared at him suspiciously. "So, anyone going to say anything about the hickeys, or..." Dean smirked. "I completed my dare," Harry shrugged lightly, whilst Draco pulled up his collar. He pulled out his wand, about to cast a glamour when Harry stopped him.
"I've never told anybody this Harry but... And please don't hate me- I was in love with Remus. As in, the illegal way. Of course I never acted upon it, plus I liked girls too- and I still do, it was just that one boy... And now's he's gone. He'll never know." Harry felt his heart pang with guilt.  "I- I'm sorry, you must think I'm disgusting."
"Now look, you've ruined it!" Draco said, sitting himself down next to Harry. "I've just been given this," Draco muttered, handing Harry an envelope. There was a slip of parchment and a photograph inside. The parchment read 'I will avenge my master, Harry Potter shall finally meet his end!'
"How long have I been in here? What happened?" Harry questioned, trying to recollect the memories of Halloween night. He remembered happily dancing with Draco, then they were up in the forms and Ron came in whilst they were kissing... Oh Merlin.
The Weasley's left the room, apart from George who stayed sitting on Harry's bed. This would be it. The moment that George lashed out at Harry and blamed him of murdering his twin, just like he did in Harry's dreams.
There was a half complete fort in the middle of the room and a shirtless Draco gathering up blankets and pillows. "Having fun?" Harry scoffed and Draco dropped everything he was holding. "I never got to do it as a kid," He muttered, picking things up again. "Neither did I, mind if I help?" Harry grinned and Draco smirked. "Sure!"
Harry took off the cape and took out the fangs then turned himself into Jacob. He took his glasses off, put some contacts in and hid his things away before heading back to the great hall in his new face and tux.
Everybody retreated back to Grimmauld Place for some celebratory firewhiskey and butterbeer. "Here's to Padfoot, a free man!" Hermione yelled and held up her bottle of butterbeer, her smile reaching from ear to ear. "I'm just hoping I can get this veritaserum out of my system soon, I don't want to go spilling all of my secrets!" Sirius huffed, but smiled. Everybody laughed and carried on their conversations and congratulating Sirius over and over again.
He could drop, right now. Make all his problems disappear. He could just let go and everything would be fine. The voices came back into focus as Harry turned around, now facing the trees of the forbidden forest where he should have died in the earlier May.
"You're right, Hermione. This is nice. We don't have to be afraid anymore he's gone." Ron smiled. But Harry was. Afraid that he would lose someone else, afraid that no one would forgiven, afraid that he could never look Mrs Weasley in the eye again. "I, um, have to go now. I'm a bit tired," Harry lied, forcing a smile. "Alright, have a good nights sleep mate," Ron said. "Doubt it," Harry mumbled as he reached the door. "What was that Harry?" Hermione asked. "Nothing. I just said 'you too'." He replied, then walked away.
Harry strolled up to Fudge with an alarmingly dangerous expression on his face. "Draco Malfoy is my friend. He never 'plotted to kill me', that was Voldemort if you haven't forgotten already, Draco was there by force of his father, who by the way, you have done so little to catch since he escaped. So how about you stop holding a grudge against a teenage boy who saved your fucking ass and do something useful with your miserable life. You shouldn't even be Minister of Magic, who even allowed you to take that role after Scrimgeour died and the death eaters took over?" Harry spat. He felt a hand on his back and turned around to see Draco looking at him, his face half prideful and half shocked. "You really would have done great in Slytherin." He whispered.
"So," Nott smirked. "Ready to change rooms?"
"Hermione breathe!" Harry laughed. "And also, that wasn't my patronus. It was Draco's." Hermione stared at Harry, blinked, then got up and ran out the portrait hole. "Mental!" Harry muttered to himself, alone now. He so badly wanted to call to his parents and ask them to come and just stay with him for a while, but he knew they couldn't be there all the time.
Touched by the words, Harry smiled. "Mum, you aren't supposed to scare off my friends like that you know." Lily rolled her eyes but smiled none the less. This was how it was supposed to be before... everything.
Before Harry could talk, Sirius interrupted him. "Do you mind if we head on over to the Gryffindor tower?" Harry blinked at his Godfather, then nodded. They walked over in silence, and once again, the students fled. "I'm never going to get used to that. People used to run to me when I walked in, not away." Sirius frowned.
"Nothing, really. We did share a couple of kisses before the war, but I haven't spoken to her since. It's a little bit awkward if you ask me." Harry chuckled. The only time he had seen her was getting on the train. "Do you still have feelings for her now? I know for sure she does. It's bloody annoying, the only time she speaks to me is about you." Ron said, rolling his eyes.
Harry's head snapped up. "What, what do you mean?" Sirius sighed and his eyes twinkled with sadness. "Your father went through something similar to you, Harry. In our fifth year I think it was, he got diagnosed with an illness and kept it all hidden. He only said anything when we found some medical potions and stuff in his trunk but then, he just said that he had an interest in those things and back then we believed him."
Harry slowly tried to open his eyes, but then shut them again quickly when light blinded him. Instead, he tried to move his fingers and his toes. All of him ached, every little bit hurt.
"You alright son?" James asked, watching Harry closely. "Yeah," Harry nodded. "You know, basically ever adult I have ever had an encounter with have said that I look much like you, but with mum's eyes,"
"Oh," Kreacher said simply, eyes widening and ears drooping. "Dobby always spoke of how highly Master Draco spoke of Master Harry Potter when he is still working for the Malfoy family!" Draco blushed at this and Sirius smirked. "We should be off now boys- don't want to be late to my own trial!" He chuckled and headed towards the fireplace. "Oh, Sirius!" Harry called suddenly and his godfather took a couple steps back so Harry could whisper, "Remus told me he loved you too. You meant the world to him. Thinking about it now, I feel kind of selfish. He had to hold me back from following you through the archway with the veil, when all he probably wanted to do was the same, I'm so stupid, I didn't even think about how bad it may have affected him and now look, I'm making it about myself again, I should just- everybody would be better off- I'm sor-"

"And why ever would I do that? I love sharing a room with Harry, it means I can be close to him all the time without having to make up excuses!" Draco grinned, resisting the eye roll which was urging to pass as his old Slytherin mates gawked at him like headless chickens. "Well, if Harry hasn't imperio'd you, them maybe we can." Pansy grinned, her pug-like face screwing up in mischief. And before Draco could react, the bitch already had him under her charm.
"I'm sorry, Padfoot. It's all my fault they're gone." Harry sighed. "No Harry, it isn't. It's Voldemorts alright? But now he's gone! And I'm here and nobody else is going anywhere." Sirius said, then McGonogall came back in.

"I was using your toilet once and found it there. My plan was to flush it down the toilet, but I wanted to confront you on it first," he smirked, looking at Harry's arms. "But now, I just want to give it back. Use it for the greater good." He hissed, then stormed out.
"I- I don't really know how to explain... So I'm just going to say it in Mauraders language if you will. I... Like my girls like I like my coffee," Harry said, sharing a small smile.
It was a new experience for Harry, he had shared a couple of innocent kisses with Ginny, and there was that kiss with Cho but she was crying the whole time. Harry decided that it was best not to think about his past kisses whilst this amazing boy was kissing him right now.
Harry tried to creep back up stairs but then heard his uncles booming voice. "POTTER! GET IN HERE NOW." Harry stopped mid step and turned back. "Pork burnt, potatoes lumpy, what are you trying to do starve us?" He snarled, and threw his plate at Harry. "Clean this all up and go to your room." Petunia snapped, and took Dudley to the phone to order some food.
He took Harry's hand and placed it under the running tap, washing the cut. He grabbed the first aid kit from under the sink and wrapped some dressing and bandages around both of Harry's wounds. Harry was silently questioning why Draco wasn't just using magic, but the look of concentration on his face was cute, or so Harry thought.
"Weasley, Potter, stop talking else you'll spend your Saturday here with me." Barton snapped. Ron stopped talking, not wanting to ruin his weekend with Hermione. The lessons for the day flew by, and soon enough Ron and Harry were sitting in the empty common room, whilst most of their peer's had one more lesson to go.
"Well, seems as you confessed all this to be, it seems only fair that I tell you. I'm dating Luna," she smiled, and looked as if a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. Harry smiled at her, glad that he had someone to talk to if things got too overwhelming. "As long as you're happy with her, I'm happy for you."
I still don't want to let you go,
"Harry." Harry croaked. His voice was dry, raspy and barely there. "I'm Harry." He gasped. "Okay, Harry. Can you tell me who did this to you?" Harry shook his head again and stood up. He walked over to the sinks and leaned on one, looking at himself in the mirror. Without his glamour, Harry's face looked gaunt, and un-lifely like.
"It's true," Madame Bones spoke, standing up. "I was in Hogwarts at the same time as James Potter and Sirius Black, they were inseparable, as Mr Black implied earlier, like brothers. It was rare that you saw one without the other. In my eyes, Sirius Black could never have done this, never. Cornelius, we have heard from the Potters themselves, surely that should be enough to prove that he is innocent?" There were a lot more nods and agreeing whispers around the courtroom, and Harry caught Draco's eye and grinned.
"What did you actually smell?" Hermione whispered as the professor moved on to the next successful potion. "Hair product, cologne and green apples," Harry admitted, not even bothering to ask how she knew. "Draco." Hermione nodded, and although it went unnoticed by the them, at the mention of his name, Draco looked over at the two. What Harry didn't know, was that another boy had also lied about what he had smelled, and it had just so happened to be his dorm mate.

As the spell hit the blonde, Harry felt himself fall into the same pit of pain as he fell to the floor again. As if by instinct, Harry grabbed Draco and the curse stopped for both boys. "Expelliarmus!" Hermione yelled and Barton's wand flew into her hand.
"I know that you were forced into getting it. The mark. I don't blame you for anything that happened. You never wanted it, I get it." He said, then started to try and tame his hair. "How did you know?" Draco asked. "That night, on the astronomy tower. I was there. I knew that you wouldn't do it. You looked so scared, by the time all the others had come up you had already lowered your wand. Then when Ron and Hermione and I were captured and I had the stinging jinx, it was clearly me. But you didn't tell. You always looked so scared." Draco just stared at the black haired boy, who wasn't even looking back at him.
"Harry Potter, you're up next." The guard said as Lily came back, and he looked at Harry with disgust. Harry ignored him and headed through the large, metal doors to stand by Sirius. His heart thumped in his chest, feeling as though it may explode even more so now than in his own trial.
"Obviously, I wasn't dead and I begged to leave, to protect my Godson but they wouldn't let me go. I know it all sounds make believe Harry, but I'm telling the truth. It felt like I was there for a month or two, tops, but here it's been almost three years."
'Meet me later in the Room of Requirement and we can talk- alone.'
"STOP, STOP!" Harry heard someone yell as the curse broke off again. He was no longer being tortured but his body was still writhing in pain, now in somebody's arms. "Mr Malfoy, first you show up late for my class and then interrupt my demonstration!" Barton snapped.
"It's all great and all, but she's always with Neville, pretending to date him. She spends more time in the eighth year common room than she does in here, where she actually lives! The Ravenclaw tower hasn't been fully repaired yet, so they are staying here for our last year," She sighed, exasperated. "Well, how about you come into the common room with me so you can spend time with her?" Harry asked. Harry had only just realised how much time Luna had spent in the eighth year tower.
"YOU ARE SPEAKING OUT OF BOUNDS POTTER!" Fudge roared and the room went dead silent. "You are going to Azkaban and you are going to rot in there-"
Attention was drawn back to Harry and they looked over at who he was talking to. Umbridge sat there and smiled innocently. "But for what, Mr Potter?" She giggled. "Child abuse! This woman, while she had the role of Defence against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts, made me and multiple other students write with some strange quill that physically wrote with our blood, carving wounds in our hands!"
Harry rolled his eyes and stormed out after Hermione. "Why did you want to know, Harry?" She asked as they headed to the library. "Don't tell anyone, but I saw Dean and Seamus kiss last night. I think they were drunk, but it was still there."
"Your last words before you, um- you know, were that you had always loved me and something just clicked. You remember now I said that there was this one boy who I saw in a new light? That was you, Harry. I've seen every year of being in this school, you always been brave and loving and protecting your friends no matter what the cost. I fell for you. I've always loved you too, Potter." Draco blushed and Harry did too.
Harry nodded and stood there in an awkward silence. "I should go," Petunia frowned and Harry nodded. Draco came into view, leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed and a sour look on his face. Petunia raised her hand and Harry instinctivly squeezed his eyes shut and flinched away. However, Petunia just gave his shoulder a pat and then walked out of the room and left with just the sound of the door closing behind her.
"Wren Wreckland!" She smiled, as Harry shook her hand. "Is it true about Dolores Umbridge and what she did?" Harry nodded and held out his hand which bore the scar 'I must not tell lies'. Harry spotted Umbridge glaring down at him, still sitting in her seat in the stands. "That's just monsterous!" Wreckland gasped. "Thank you for sticking up for me. All of you!" Harry smiled and shook a few more hands before walking out.
Sirius and Harry ran out toward the door where Harry had left his parents earlier, only to find that neither were there. Before he could even begin to question their whereabouts, the door slammed open once more and a flood of people ran in and pulled Sirius into piles of hugs and congratulations. Draco slipped in and pulled Harry around the corner, out of sight. Firm in his beliefs that nobody could see them, Draco pulled him in to a long, tight hug. "Congratulations, emerald. You were amazing up there, and from your performance I simply cannot believe that you weren't placed into Slytherin!" He chuckled as Harry pulled back and poked him in the ribs, laughing softly.
"Well who is it?"
"Always."
"Bloody feels like it." He mumbled into the fabric.
Draco hummed carefully as to say, just a second, cut the gauze and pushed his chair back to his diary that sat on the desk.
Draco didn't have time to ask why he would need to "be nice" he was already running late for work.
"Why don't you go out to a bar Harry, have a good time." Hermione suggested.
It's been two weeks since Harry had slept at Draco's house, the two had seen each other a fair few more times but shared nothing more that a passive conversation at Andromeda's house before one of them would have to hurry off somewhere. Draco was enjoying a mild day at work, he'd been kept on his toes but he wasn't drastically busy. Harry was also at St.Mungos he wasn't injured, he was running a small job at the ministry to keep his time occupied, all he needed to do was collect a few files and sign off a few records his errands were coinciding with the end of Draco's shift so he thought he might loiter for a bit and see the blond after. About ten minutes away from the end of his shift Draco was called to a patient, a seemingly regular deep laceration nothing he couldn't fix up in ten/fifteen minutes and be on his way to see his son.
"We're quite the pair aren't we.' He said, putting out his cigarette on the concrete.
"Daddy!"
"Considering you took three stunning spells to the chest and a nasty fall, shit would be a great way to describe it." Alex said handing Draco a glass of water that downed in one.
"Yeah it didn't last but thats fine just the wrong sort of relationship for me you know."
Draco's mouth fell open.
"Yours."
Harry sat up and cupped Draco's jaw to face him.
"I love you, Draco. I always have." Harry smiled sadly and turned back around. He wasn't looking. Wasn't thinking. All he knew was that he could jump. And so he did.
Draco walked away and got into his own bed. "Draco? Do you support gay wizards?" Harry asked, hoping that Malfoy would say yes. "I do, actually. Wanted to rebel against my father once, so I believed In the opposite of everything he believed in. I learnt to accept all witches and wizards alike." He yawned. "Draco?" Harry asked cautiously. "Yes, Potter?"
Suddenly, there was a click and a flash and the two boys jumped apart, again. Rita Skeeter stood a few miles away from them with a big camera in her hands. "Got you now Potter!" She cackled and ran off. Harry began to sprint after her but it was no use, his body was too weak.
Whilst In thought, harry chopped up the potatoes, boiled them and started to mash them when he smelt a burning. He quickly got the pork chops out and looked at them. They were all black, burnt to the crisp. Harry tried to scrape most of the burnt bits off, but it was no use. "BOY, SERVE UP NOW, DUDLEY IS HUNGRY!" Vernon's voice came from the living room. No starting over now. Harry served up the black chops, extremely lumpy potato and probably under cooked peas and gave it to the Dursley's. Hopefully Dudley would be too fat and greedy to notice.
"I'm taller than you now!" Harry shouted, grinning as he made his way back down to see Draco standing there filming him with a Muggle video camera, watching as Harry monkeyed his way up and down trees.
They would never let Draco off the hook, he was a Malfoy, son of Lucius who served and escaped from Azkaban, who had the dark mark burnt into his skin. Harry only hoped that he could find a way to get his boyfriend out of it.
Just as Harry was about to walk back, he felt a hand on his shoulder. Naturally, Harry whipped his wand out, turned around quickly and pressed it to the persons neck. "Relax!" A male voice came. Harry looked up. It was Draco Malfoy.
"What made you realise you were gay, Harry? It can't have just been seeing those two boys kiss," Malfoy asked. "I don't really know if I'm being honest. I always had this nagging feeling, but I couldn't quite pinpoint what it was. I just ignored it up until fifth year when I had my first kiss with Cho Chang. I thought it would be really exciting and love filled, but when asked I just described it as 'wet'. Wet!" Harry laughed.
