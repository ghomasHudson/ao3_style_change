And, where Draco was closed off and cold, and sometimes even refusing, Matt was open, warm, and straight on commenting how he thought Harry was hot. A little bit less since Harry told him he was married, and only agreed to spend time as friends, but still not shy to express it.
He barely caught sight of a torn “Undesirable Number One” poster and went to find Harry on it - only looking decades older - when he was attacked.
“I’d rather you let us in so we can talk,” Harry said, thinking of Aunt Petunia of all the sudden. “Before the neighbors see two strange men at your doorstep.”
needs you. I can educate him about almost anything he would like to know, but he likes you.”
Except, if he was worried about Severus’ upbringing, seeing Draco like this wouldn’t mess with his head? And if so, and Harry was to tell Malfoy he should be a
“As much as I loved being locked up here with you, maybe we could ask the elves to move your things to my bedroom? I have a bigger bed that could be more comfortable for both of us. Also a nicer tub.”
“Maybe you should tell me what this fantasy entails,” he told Potter, whose eyes grew wide, just by hearing how Draco’s voice dropped, only by thinking about the possibilities.
“It’s no use,” the girl laughed at him.
“That’s how you Malfoys called being naked?”
Which made him wonder if he would be a horrible person if he seduced Harry just to make him want to stay.
“Maybe you could sleep naked every single day,” however, as Harry tended to know what Draco was up to, so did Draco it seemed, wickedly grinning at him. “I’d keep you warm if it was chilly.”
I apologize for Lucius being racist, rude or/and just too much if he is in this chapter. He's great to write with but even I didn't see all of this coming and I have the whole fic planned out.
“I don’t remember giving you permission to argue with me,” Draco snapped, regretting it until he saw how unfocused Potter’s eyes became hearing that.
“We?” Draco only asked.
“Sirius became the other Draco’s foster parent, with Ed and Severus helping him out sometimes, so it’s not such a jump.”
“I told you before, I don’t really care for apologies,” Fayre told him, maybe because she was still angry or because she was no longer? Harry couldn’t decide.
If it would have been Dumbledore, he’d give Draco his bag back while putting a tracking charm on it, if not all of the contents. But Dumbledore had dealt with Grindelwald, not Draco.
good in anything when Draco draped him in new clothing (which he already saw a peek of when trying it out first, even if it wasn't the finished clothing, mostly just materials), and turned him to their mirror.
“The Pureblood families socialize, so their kids are there as well.”
He’d never heard about anyone being immune to magic who wasn’t part Giant or a creature of some sort, but he should have approached Eileen when Tobias wasn’t home first.
change the past, unlike a Time-Turner.
“I don’t think we’ve been introduced,” she offered her hand to Hermione once she was standing next to them, being in level.
“And I feel like even around me you can’t be yourself, as I only except you as Fayre—”
“Admit it. You miss them dearly already, and it’s too quiet, and you don’t have Ed now to teach, so you don’t even have the motivation to get breakfast,” Harry sat down, making the blond wizard only nod.
Fayre did wake up after a while and Hermione and Harry let her go, trying to talk to her, but she wouldn’t listen and kept asking when she can go. So they let her, and after Harry made sure both Hermione and Ron was going to be alright, he followed her.
“I’m sorry,” Harry told the blond wizard in a smaller voice, giving up and sighing. “I’m currently running every spell I can find in 3 wizarding libraries including the one you have in Malfoy Manor, and Draco doesn’t exist according to any of them.”
“Look, little girl, my name is Harry Potter. I’m here to save my friend, Draco Malfoy, or Fayre Black, or Fayre Smith, and it’s really important that I find them. Do you know where they are?”
There was an awkward pause until Lucius didn’t get up from his seat, ready to be escorted back to his cell, keeping his cold blue eyes on Harry.
“It’s not where, but when. We’re supposed to be in the year Severus was born, which would be 1960, but thanks to you, the magic didn’t take us entirely back, so I have no way of knowing…”
“Apparently, the Black Manor thinks I’m an eligible bachelor and tries to help my cause with sending Fayre into my bed every morning. No matter how we always go to sleep in different rooms and where I end up sleeping, even if it’s on the floor, the next morning—”
Not making Draco wish it could be real, of course. Besides, what more could he ask given their circumstances?
“But the thing is, Harry… I can’t help!” and she truly looked like she was sharing Ron’s curse she looked so miserable.
Potter had to come close enough, but luckily, even if wearily, he did.
“You wouldn’t even guess, who are you shagging in this future,” Harry told Draco after he already told most of the important things they needed to discuss first.
So, I decided to finish this fic here. Everything is well and good with all of the characters (or at least hinted that it is heading towards that way), and I didn't want to make it any longer.
There seemed to be no escaping fate, and Draco had pulled Harry into this futile fight for nothing, but Potter just held him.
I'm sorry for the wait, guys! I had this chapter since forever, but I didn't want to post it before I knew where the story from here went.
And as always, thank you all ever so much for reading! XOXO
“I take at least two potions every day,” Lucas told him. “For the heat. I can deal with the sun, but I get weaker because of the scorching weather.”
However, the blond wizard tried to encourage Severus to freely ask him about anything, and once Severus knew it was safe to, he bombarded Draco with questions about everything.
“I know we messed up a lot of things,” Harry admitted. “But-“
Now that they didn’t need to pack up and leave anymore (Eileen or time-travel), he thought maybe he could propose to Draco for real.
Taking Severus out to flying. Listening to Severus when the kid told him about
“We are…?” Harry listened carefully because only Malfoy knew what was going on, but the blond must have thought the same thing as well because rather than answering, he started cursing Harry.
Second chapter today, which I was trying to do quickly not to leave you guys hanging... Our duo only finds a temporary solution first, but at least it's not so cliffy as chapter 12.
“Is it scary to know? That I would even die for you, anytime?” Harry teased, and hell, if his partner wasn’t underage, he’d even kiss Fayre. He figured it out. She loved him back, it wasn’t just him; all along.
“Like you’re any better,” Potter said.
The hatemail Ginny got was, however, totally unacceptable. Harry felt responsible for her, and it hurt him more than his own shame ever could.
Severus looked at his mother for permission, but his stomach gave a large growl. And not even Malfoy could insist to take Severus out somewhere nice, Harry just knew it.
“Just… leave me alone, please,” Harry asked an impossible thing, given that Draco could only leave as far as the bathroom. “It’s not that I don’t understand, it’s just that for a second I thought you were really going to do it.”
“If you think a false memory would fool me-“
It was sometimes hard for Draco to know whether he was expecting too much from a four-year-old, Severus still very young, or doing him a disservice.
“Tomorrow we go together and you’ll apologize to him yourself.”
character,” Draco gesticulated the “this” with some unpleasant expression.
She tried to shake it off, and pretend that she’s okay with it, and went to work trying to turn her surprisingly bad mood around, then this happens.
“Tobias would kill me for taking his magic away, and that’s why you’re here, aren’t you?”
“Alright, so you figured it out,” Potter huffed, suddenly pulling Draco close by the edge of his sweater with a look in his eyes that didn't promise anything good. “I am attracted to you Malfoy, and I care about you just enough that I don’t want to see you die a horrible death. Could you stop constantly teasing me about it and make me understand—“
“Oh, so you don’t want to talk? We could do a lot of things still without talking.”
“I almost sorted into Slytherin. I never even told Hermione and Ron that, but…”
Next, when Harry opened his closed lids, Fayre was holding him for real, even though it was her who was wearing a hospital gown.
“I’m not,” Harry immediately said, although, he couldn’t let Severus put them in the same danger again. “I trust you. But you should also trust us with the matters that only concern us.”
Even if there were decades between this time and Draco’s, nothing seemed to change in their dynamics. And that was the best. Nothing else could have put Draco’s worries to rest any better.
“That it could be always worse?”
After all, Ed only…
of a family who abandoned her?” Tobias took a step toward Draco now. “Do you want a message to take back to them? Tell them she’s dead. She doesn’t need them or magic anymore. And you… you’re so weak! It was stupid of you to come here.”
One day he even bought a cello for Severus, never asking Draco for his permission or money, claiming Severus said he wanted to learn how to play some music ever since they danced together.
Not that it helped when Ginny decided to break up with him. All the country knew the next day, courtesy of some magical wiretapping device, much to both his and Ginny’s shame.
“And?” Harry wondered about that himself.
“I don’t know what to say,” Harry watched as a stranger mouthed the same thing he said in the mirror. “Except maybe that I feel like I shouldn’t be just Department Deputy in these clothes, but at least someone… rich and famous. And I don’t want to take these off. Ever.”
Severus considered.
However, whatever Draco expected to accomplish by tossing his shirt to the floor it wasn’t Potter coming closer, running his fingers along the scars Draco only had because of him.
“Damn, you should be an Auror, Harry,” Ron smirked, and for once, Fayre agreed with the redhead. Potter had all the Defense Against Dark Arts skills one needed for the job.
He even fake bowed with a funny gesture, making Severus straighten his back as if he was indeed noble, which made him smile.
Taking such care to label everything with the funnily-shaped letters children first write with that he didn’t even notice Harry and Draco watching him fondly.
“I thought when you said you’re going to have a day off, it included me, yet you’re hiding away with a book you’ve already read?”
“I’m willing to go with you. You can still attack us both the same after,” Harry wouldn’t forfeit his wand, but at least could make her see reason.
With a change of heart, she felt like she should convince him not to give up, so she kinda went to his table with a drink, originally planning to leave any second she felt like she accomplished that.
Tell me what you have thought? XO
“You both should inherit the house, if not all properties. That’s why Draco could get into the house, although it was only supposed to let Order members in. The wards that were left for the Black family members had overwritten the ones the Order members had set up, granting him access after all.”
Except, nearly nobody was around, and even if someone appeared, their steps were hurried, and everywhere it was dark and too quiet.
“Well, I know it’s nothing you’re used to, your Royal Highness, but maybe we can invite you for tea in our poor home. Only, I’ll have to ask the servants to prepare the biscuits and the tea and update the decorations, so if you don’t mind, we shall have it tomorrow.”
“Only you could be such a troll, Potter, intending an insult and ending up with a compliment.”
“When you took Severus, I promised Tobias never to do magic again, and we decided to live completely as Muggles,” Eileen explained. “But then, I got pregnant, and everything has changed. In ancient China, they sometimes bound important heirs to dragons for longer life, and in Japan, sometimes they sealed away powers of a magical creature they deemed too dangerous into something or somebody else. So I assumed that if someone had a great magical resistance, they can take on magic, even if they weren’t magical before. I wasn’t sure it would work, but as you’ve seen…”
Sometimes, though, it wasn’t easy. Like when he finally got home from Lucius, and Fayre just sensed his bad mood and bought him a Butterbeer without a word, one in front of Harry, on in front of her.
It wasn’t what Harry had expected to say at least, not after their rushed morning, or Draco almost sending him away to a different time alone.
That made Fayre get back from joking to serious as well.
“Have you met me, Potter?” Fayre laughed, but totally not in a happy way. “Death Eaters don’t have pleasant memories! They can’t produce a Patronus. We’re both dead at this point!”
“And look like a ghost if they don’t use the right colors,” Draco added.
“Ed says it’s not a blanket but a ship and he is the Captain.”
“Severus, I know you love your mom,” Harry hunkered down to face the child from his height. “But do you think if she came to take you back you’d want to go with her?”
Someone wasn’t satisfied when Harry won the war. One person on the side of the “Light” wanted to further punish someone “Dark”, yelling it was to revenge a life of a dear relative who was already dead. However, that one curse reignited the battle which turned into bloodshed.
“We couldn’t risk it.”
But that could also go wrong very fast, and Severus deserved better than another fallout. Even now, the small child was underweight, way too quiet for his age, and had nightmares every day.
“I’m only kidding, I don’t have any time for anything but my job at the Ministry, and I don’t need blood sometimes for months or even years,” Lucas said, laughing at Ed cheerfully again. “If it’s not coming from the rat-colony I keep at my basement.”
“Is there anything else you’d like to do?” Harry had no idea what someone like Severus Snape wanted to do with his free time when he was just 4, but maybe the kid had some ideas, and Harry could just leave them with Draco to it.
Even if it was a trait of Harry, a hero of the side of the Light, not even a choice, probably.
“I thought you said this time had to be saved so we have to be extremely careful, and now you’re picking a fight?” he tried to pull Potter away, lowering his voice so others couldn’t hear.
“How about the day after tomorrow then? I have an international Apparation Licence and a day off. And you could invite me for solid food, or not solid food either.”
“It’s not about who is right but about whose suggestion it is, isn't it?” Fayre grimaced. “You won’t hear me out because of the past! Even if it means you’re killing your own husband!”
“For the last time, I didn’t kiss your father, he attacked me—”
“Remember when you bought a Muggle or Wizarding house cheap, I fixed it up with both magic and Muggle ways, you redecorated it and Eileen had found us so we had to sell it quickly to move somewhere else?”
Thank you guys for being so positive with all the comments and kudos you send on my way! XOXO
However, little did he know that surviving the war was not the end of his torture. He was still the boy who lived, and now he lived twice.
“Surely, there is something you’d like to do… Should I tell the elves to make a cake?”
“I don’t understand,” Potter stated.
and for those who don't remember what a manticore is, here:
He didn’t plan to have high expenses, and he also had some money in his pocket that could cover a few weeks of rent. And if he worked, at least he’d get his mind off of memories, keeping busy.
“I hate to say it,” Harry carefully started. “But there is one place where we could go to be safe.”
“I thought you weren’t a Malfoy anymore,” Harry muttered, but his attention was back to Draco and how attractive he was, even as a male. Had Harry been a girl, he would have been over Draco for sure.
They even had a very polite and uneventful dinner next, until it was Severus who refused to go to bed without a bedtime story all three of them acted out, demanding to go to Harry's room, yet left them to take a bath first.
“I need to discuss it with Draco first,” Harry said, but it wasn’t the conversation he feared.
“Malfoys. Good taste and always eager to make more money,” Draco muttered because it wasn’t a bad idea, but from the description only, Harry could have worked with any number of his ancestors.
Harry heard what Hermione said about the curse, yet he stopped listening somewhere after the first “there is nothing to do”.
“Thanks, I feel much better already,” Draco noted.
“But it’s not fitting—”
But for the Pixies’ sake, Draco Malfoy was never this… weak for Harry or anyone else. It must have been the girly hormones, or Furmage forbids, that one night stand, but her day already was shitty when she quickly scanned the other girl in the bed.
“When I had him, he was put up for adoption, and I only kept watch on him from afar because I thought your husband would want to rescue him.”
“If what you’re saying is true, that Eileen from the future didn’t make it back here. She wouldn’t care about what her other self thought, or hear you out if you were to appear knocking at her door. We can’t—“
He just gave himself a minute to adjust - for he never did actually Apparate from a laying down position, it was sort of weird - when unfortunately the certain blond woke up, and the first thing he did was noticing Harry and being vocal about it.
That was when Draco could no longer just watch and burst through the door with a wand at ready.
“You know what, why don’t you stay, and finish dinner with me? I’m quite sure Carlos wouldn’t mind if he knew I asked you to keep me company,” suddenly, Ed just asked the secretary, who was…
Only, then Potter appeared as well, sitting to the other end of the long library table. He researched Time-magic sometimes and even studied some seventh-year materials, so Draco assumed that’s what he was doing.
“It’s been merely a misunderstanding,” a thug seemingly told Draco, while he was clearly provoking Potter for a fistfight, if not a duel.
Then, when they sent Severus to clean up before dinner, Malfoy had grabbed Harry by the hand and pulled him to the closest room, kissing him. What happened with the “one time only, Potter” thing?
a royal then. Maybe some distant cousin. Someone has to be able to tell him if he ate too much cake, after all, since that can’t be the butler,” he said, transforming his clothes to a dress, and his hair long.
“Maybe tomorrow we can have some people over from the Queen’s court,” he automatically chose the other option. “What do
“I need the library of this one,” the woman made a face. “Plus this one has been always my favorite.”
“Or, our meddling causes ripples not only forward but backward in time as well. The mere presence of the spectator watching the experiment influencing the results.”
“Really? Job interview? Paying for our room?” Draco found himself asking. Jack seemed something else, but Harry was only gone for 10 minutes tops.
“Yes, because I don’t own a basement.”
“A lot of people are funny. But some are more worthy. I know what it’s like to marry someone who is below you and it never ends well. Lucas might be young and carefree, but Edwin needs an intellectual partner,” Eileen said. “Just last month I had sent him on a date and he managed to charm—“
“I can’t let you,” Malfoy pointed it at him with such a tone that Harry thought it was better to not risk any sudden movements. “Don’t move!”
“So, you just only had sex? Well, I must congratulate you, although, judging by your reaction, she wasn’t that pretty the next morning as she seemed befor—”
“Eileen with her husband, hand in hand,” Harry announced. “Since you gave her permission for the wards, she could just walk in with him. It’s only lucky for us Tobias probably can’t be Side-Alonged, so I saw them from a distance before Severus would notice.”
It put things into perspective seeing all those terrible fates that could have befallen on them but didn’t.
I planned on Severus doing something with accidental magic in the end, but in the comments, I also got the suggestion to use their elves to help Drarry, so I did (=> which also shows how grateful I am for every comment, and you guys even trying to help me out with ideas, so thank you all!) <3
However, Draco and Severus should discuss that with each other. Just as Harry would then later also talk with Malfoy, advising him to take some breaks with Severus, but not with the kid present.
He feared how she will react. Maybe she would curse him badly…
“I won’t.”
But every time they resolved an issue, Harry could trust the next time they can do the same as well. And since they both had Slytherin traits, the negotiations didn’t always go as straightforward as one could expect.
He already had a naked woman next to him, he already spent a great amount of time with her and she was surprisingly funny and intelligent which wasn’t half bad, but, he was convinced that a woman like that would never even consider dating him so he abandoned that thought quickly.
“What’s wrong?” little Severus stood in the door, making them both fall silent quickly. “What’s happening?”
They weren't any better than Lucius, were they?
“Oh?” Harry turned to face him.
“Then he must have better Legilimency than we’ve thought because we’re here.”
“And what is this?” first, his sleepy mind panicked, thinking they were found again, but they both were suspiciously smiling. “What are you two up to?”
“We won’t. But we needed to buy some time, and look as if we would,” Harry said.
“I have lived in a cupboard for ten years, I think it should be perfectly fine,” Harry said, making Draco stare, so he quickly added. “But I don’t know what could I do.”
“Legilimency. They have a link. Mostly by Severus’ effort, but I also think Edwin needs to let himself be read, and it happens when he talks, even if it’s not any spoken language we’d understand.”
“Can I maybe spend the day with you?”
“Mostly a nurse, but it’s okay as long as I get to help people.”
“What do we usually do if we’re not ‘not talking’?” he rather just wondered.
“Oh, look at who is mentioning hygiene,” Potter just spat back without thinking. “Do they let you shower in this place at all?”
“But I got so close to dying that you were worried about me and the curse took us to a memory you wanted to keep from me all along,” Harry went on. “And you worried sick because you care. About me.“
Harry was worn out, thinking that in the end, it was still a waste because he could look better, but not especially
“It isn’t a false memory, although it’s something that won’t be easy for you to see,” Harry warned her.
“I’m more concerned about his son. I mean Draco is a pampered being, it’s just… not healthy for him to stay hidden for so long, without even financial aid from his mother. Narcissa is as worried about him as me,” Harry admitted the whole truth, something he didn’t even tell Hermione because he was concerned she would find him strange for worrying over their arch enemy, but he did worry.
Potter was the real target for the savage men, and Fayre was just used to get to him. That though beyond angered her, but she was helpless. She hated violence, she truly did. That’s why she became a healer not an Auror for instance, even if she wasn't paid as much as they were.
“It’s unlike you to still be in your PJs.”
“You don’t need different glasses for reading?” Severus asked Harry, while he took away Harry’s book to read the title. “Why are you reading about Time magic? Can I also study it with you?”
read the title with big bold letters on the front page.
Trying to shake these thoughts, he finished the bath quickly and waited, but Potter hadn’t returned. By the time Draco went downstairs, looking for him, to his surprise, Potter was making a scene.
Thank you for all your support guys, it really made me happy to see all the kudos last week!
“So we won’t be meeting them tomorrow then?”
Harry realized he didn’t since the first time he accidentally traveled back.
“And if you die, and your husband wants to kill me?”
Harry, true to his word, avoided the market like plague from then on.
I also didn't expect so many people reading it and giving me feedback! So thank you! <3 Stay safe guys and stay awesome. XOXO
War criminal trials, his testimony recorded, Auror schools accepting him just for fame even though he didn’t finish Hogwarts yet. With his reputation, there was no chance of him returning to Hogwarts either, the students would never leave him alone.
“I have already told you I’m gay,” Harry couldn’t believe that Draco would believe otherwise. “But I’d be happy to prove it to you, except you told me I couldn’t.”
So he decided to act quickly before he’d lose his resolve.
And given the look Potter was giving Draco, it seemed he knew exactly what he was thinking about.
He was in the new Azkaban, where the guards were no longer dementors. Hermione working in the ministry did make sure of that.
But, maybe what was supposed to be a surprise for Draco surprised him better.
“Don’t you dare to laugh at me, ever!” the girl stated, and Harry smiled.
Not only he invited the young man inappropriately to dine with him but forced him to confess something personal.
“And if I order you to answer me for real?” the blond asked, and when Potter didn’t answer, figured he’d pushed it too far. He was about to get off from Harry when the other wizard grabbed him.
When they were finished, he could see the anguish in her face, and had to remind himself not to try even comfort her: she still held Draco hostage.
Harry had never seen Draco still not dressed by seven, but when both Severus and Ed left to school, he found the blond arranging the documents he needed to owl from their bed, although it was almost noon.
“We. We’d be safe from Eileen, all of us.”
“I must admit, I don’t know much about the second one,” Ed concentrated on the detail so badly because he didn’t seem to be wrong, and Lucas seemed to be flirting. But why?
(somehow = with honesty & a newfound way for them to have sex)
Harry could barely forget that night, but he was doing his best. Then this, out of nowhere?
Chapter 2/3 ;)
I read if time-travel was invented, we'd need the time machine to exist
also seemed to appreciate it. Every time.
Well, the “interview” was interesting, given that the owner of the store wasn’t impressed by Harry in Muggle attire, so Harry decided to visit Madame Malkin’s right after. He needed a couple of items of clothing anyway.
“Well then, I guess I’ll just have to wash while you’re creepily watching me getting naked,” Draco huffed, as he’d ever do such thing, but it was important he was believed, so he even pulled off his shirt. It’s not like Potter was into wizards anyway.
It was an emergency, so Severus Flooed to Edwin’s place without a second thought.
However, Fayre was researching healing potions as it was her field of expertise, and quite often asked what Harry thought about it, Harry found that as long as it’s about helping people heal, he can be invested even in Potions. That they had in common with the woman.
“I reported to the Ministry what Eileen and Tobias did to Edwin anonymously, so if anybody, I’m at the fault,” Harry said.
Having spent months if not years in the blond’s head, seeing all the memories, he knew it wasn’t true.
“Or, that’s what you tell yourself.”
date Our-Beloved-Teen-Hero.
“You must understand, it’s not like we see each other every day, we’re both really busy, I’m from a different country, and we haven’t made any promises, just… like to spend time together when we can,” and Lucas must have seen Sev’s furious state as well, making excuses for Ed.
Although, if sharing was a weakness, Potter just became a target himself. Maybe Draco could use it to his advantage, but how?
Thank you all very much for reading! This chapter is already a part of the happy-end XOXO
“I don’t need your apology, Potter,” she told him, and that made him feel even worse.
It made Draco feel guilty because he didn’t deserve it.
“I trust Harry more,” Hermione corrected, but to that Fayre only made a face. “I trust him more than with my life, for Ron means more to me than my own life. And if I’m wrong I’m prepared to live with the consequences. But Harry has good instincts.”
“More like… with possibly a great cock,” Harry went so red it was almost funny seeing it, mumbling something if they were to have sex, how it would be the other way around then Draco initially imagined.
Hermione did shake her hand and muttered something in French, to which Fayre replied with a big smile. That made Hermione smile too, which a little bit irritated Harry for he didn’t even understand a word.
Hell, she told herself she’d just laugh it off later, seeing Potter with a girl…
“What? I—“
“Whatever you think you’re doing, stop,” Harry tried to sound firm but non-threatening. “It’s finally over.
“Nothing else seemed to work, so…” Harry admitted, digging his grave only deeper.
“I don’t think so,” Harry said, and getting light-headed, he sat on the ground. “You can easily prove me wrong though. Just try it once. But don’t cheat and
But, if it was just a calculated Slytherin move, as he would have liked to sell it, why would Severus say he was in pain? Unless…
“Depends on the reward, probably, but I’m listening,” Draco grinned cheekily back.
“Correction, Potter, my father threw me out of it!” it seemed as if no matter what Harry was saying, it couldn’t possibly be right.
“If it’s once a month, yes,” Draco told him with a fake-serious face, but then he chuckled. “Do you even think for one minute I’d be offering to sleep with you and still expecting that we wouldn’t do anything?”
Draco being homeless, nameless and penniless just didn’t fit his profile. Harry couldn’t begin to phantom where he could have disappeared like this.
Now that made Ron go deep red, and help him, while Hermione just smiled at him with a knowing smile. It was as if they were Harry’s family - which they were - and he just got their permission to date Fayre.
“Oh, do not worry, I already have a job!” Malfoy sneered at him unpleasantly. “I’m not as pampered as you thought, after all!”
“I’m really fine. I’m just not the romantic type, and as much I love Sev’s wife, I’m gay.”
“Great,” Draco frowned and rolled his eyes. “So is this other me also dating Lockhart or something?”
Salazar, Draco’s only luck was that he froze on the spot the minute Potter touched him, so at least he was too shocked to show any reaction he might have otherwise had.
Only once Harry was already in Draco’s bed, ready for sleep, did he realize something. Namely, how Mindy could cook for them all day without a problem, even though they should have been low on food.
“’Kay, but I can’t call you Malfoy either since you abandoned that—”
“Not everything was the same,” he then told the blond. “You said Edwin defeated me, so the Dark side won. That’s proof.”
“You have no idea what I’ve been through.”
“I… I’m not seeing them, not yet, but maybe I should! They wouldn’t pretend to be fine with it if they were hurt,” Potter said and hearing that was too much, so Draco sent a curse first.
going in and out of shops, and that he’d have to try on at least 35 types of dragon leather shoes.
Harry was so drawn to research, with this new lead, he only took a break to bake a cake with Severus in the afternoon (Severus’ choice).
“Maybe we could have another tea party,” Harry announced.
“I gave your letter to Fay--Draco. Made sure he read it, as promised. But then she burned the whole thing and told me to tell you she won’t come to visit you even if it would rain Veelas from the sky.”
Death Eaters?
“You know where Harry and Severus are right now?”
“You like to order me around, I don’t think that part would be difficult for us in the bed either.”
“You know perfectly well!” Hermione burst out into tears, probably feeling as powerless in the situation as Harry did, if not more.”Ron had a loving family, true friends, honest relationships. All the things you probably never had! He even had Harry’s friendship, for Merlin’s sake, when you couldn’t even get a handshake, Malfoy!”
Draco, who didn’t have to think about the last one ever for himself, always just repeating Lucius’ ideas whenever he was talking, especially felt the pressure on how important it was what he will tell Severus about it.
One day out of blue, Eileen had bought Severus over with a small pile of neatly-folded clothes.
A small nod and Harry just watched as Draco hugged the kid tightly, and sent Severus packing.
“You should ask them out,” Draco now leveled his cold gaze at Harry. “Before we have to leave. So you can see where it goes.”
Sometimes, Harry felt like Severus grew on them.
Harry had to admit Malfoy was right. He was so preoccupied with his worries that he didn’t even consider searching for an alternative way back.
“I’d rather not waste time telling you,” she said. “So I hope you didn’t have a big lunch yet.”
Despite what people may have thought, Harry wasn’t suicidal.
Who, to his credit, even tried to invite Eileen, but when she didn’t respond, decided to spend all morning with the preparations. He transformed the dining room chairs, decorations, and even the wallpaper to appear more luxurious.
“We can’t hand over Severus-“ Draco started as soon as the elves reported that the Snapes indeed left the property. He wasn’t taking any chances and Harry couldn't help but agree.
It seemed to be a primitive levitation spell of some sort, but wandless and nonverbal, which meant even if it was a simple spell, it had to be working based on magical power none of the Muggles are supposed to have.
“When I think about things I don’t want him to know I do, but it’s not like I could keep Occluding all the time, that requires--“
“I’m married, and also raising a child.”
“I wasn’t talking about your boss, Potter. I was talking about the wizard or witch you’ve been seeing for months.”
That made Eileen look at him funny, just before attacking him with Legilimency. Draco fought her off, but only after she saw too much.
“Father, welcome to the future,” he said, just as his brother did mere minutes ago. “You can rest assured, I’m not an evil overlord in this one.”
“Fine by me.”
“So, I hope you can muster up a breakfast as an apology before I need to leave for work,” Harry didn’t pay attention for only a bit, and now Fayre was standing in front of him.
“I’m talking about how
Then again, Fayre too went ahead and called Harry a virgin as if he was laughable. (Which he was, Lucius did laugh at him a lot when he ran for his life after
“Fayre then,” he said. “I sincerely apologize—”
He couldn’t remember ever playing games as a child, so he didn’t have many ideas, but Severus missed his mother, if not his father as well (which was not a happy thought for Draco, but it could happen).
“I’d like to think Severus is smarter than most of the kids at his age.”
“WAIT, you CAN’T!” Malfoy even stopped cursing him at that second, putting his wand to its holster, holding his empty hands up. “I’ll tell you everything you want to know, and you can verify if I’m telling the truth, but we’ll need the contents of that bag badly.”
Thank you everyone for reading! XOXO
“Ambitious,” Harry couldn’t help but laugh. Some things might have changed, but Severus was still a Slytherin, it seemed. Why else would he pick the son of probably the most important person he knew?
But little Snape was sitting on an elegant chair that was too big for him and seemed just as troubled as in his memories when James Potter was taunting him in front of everyone.
“Youngest to have the title in some time,” Severus proudly added. “But if you and Dad would like to change anything, Father, Ed will be quite smart, but you could also make him more social? He spends most of his time with McGonagall, and while she is a great Deputy, I doubt the age-gap between them is appropriate—“
There. He just said it, and the world didn’t crash and burn into pieces like a Phoenix, despite how he felt saying it. And if anything, Potter seemed to stare back quietly at him, definitely not yelling now.
Nevertheless, hope you guys like it as much I do! <3
“Oh, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to... I mean I just thought you must be hungry… which you can be, but I just assumed - for solid food, you know…”
“Even if I have my way with you every night that you can’t even stand the next day, not promising anything just that I’d use you?” he leaned a bit closer, a bit even surprised by himself.
“It is,” Tobias kissed her face, content.
Part two for today! Thank you, everyone, for reading! Take care! XOXO
And leverage on Malfoy was no longer necessary anyway since they were stuck.
“Edwin was under different circumstances until now, but we’ll take care of him.”
“Mrs. Snape, I don’t know what happened to your son, but if it was this morning, it couldn’t have been Malfoy,” he admitted. “He came home badly hurt yesterday, and hasn’t been up since.”
stupid. Lucius would have to find a way through Potter to outsmart his son.
“So you’re from the future as well,” she noted less furious, which ironically made her look only older. “But if it wasn’t him taking my son, I don’t know where Severus is… you need to help me, or I’ll report you both to the Ministry.”
“And you had everything I didn’t have,” Harry shrugged. “The only common thing we probably have is suffering. We both have seen some shit, but always got over it.”
“I work with only Jack, and he could be a hundred for all I care.”
So he asked to be taken to one of Draco Malfoys.
“Better than I was,” Harry told him. In all his teenage years, and recent adult life, he didn’t know he could break down in front of someone so bad only to then be put together as new, and still feel cared for in the end.
“Do you think it’s Eileen? She somehow brainwashed our elves and she could be here any second?” Malfoy paled, now trying any way out of the room, trying to open the windows, trying to blow up the walls, just as Harry did, accomplishing nothing.
During the next day, Eileen would appear in the MACUSA building with Aurors, telling officials her son was abducted. Claiming she knew he was taken to the US. Demanding papers for the English Aurors with her to investigate the case.
Not to mention, Draco had seen where theories of Pureblood Supremacy had led magicals and not only didn’t want any part of that, the idea that Severus would get into it once again scared him even more.
“No, it’s not!” Severus insisted. “Draco is always with Edwin, saying I can read on my own, but Edwin can’t, and you’re so busy, and mom is always at work, and when not, she invites stupid Clara over…”
“Stay,” Severus brought Draco back from his wandering thoughts when he was ready to take care of some documents the Goblins owled him in the morning. “Maybe we could all learn Time-magic? It’s Harry’s turn to read now.”
Harry took a step up to her, but she took a step back.
Which made him realize the crystal could have worked somehow similarly. If it was using the blood in the Dark Spell to transport the traveler between the crystal in the future and the past, it meant Harry would need an object from the time he wanted to travel to as well.
True, since they officially adopted Severus, rescued Edwin, and Eileen also got a job from Jack, their life had become a bit more chaotic.
“Thanks,” Malfoy muttered, not noticing Pinky who appeared behind his back.
“No, no, my treat. I would like Harry to consider the job I just offered him, so maybe you could send him in tomorrow morning for an interview?” he patted Draco’s back, and even winked at Severus, turning to leave.
“You can have the bathroom first.”
Harry never admitted it, but some mornings Fayre being so close to him, he considered dating her for real.
Or was he just simply so strong? Telling another wizard everything right after they just met because he wasn’t interested in anyone who wouldn’t accept him for himself?
“Tobias might have meant the world to me once, but I had to lose him to get some perspective. All along I thought if I just loved him well enough I could change him,  and we could be happy together, blaming myself. I forgot how strong I was before I met him, but once I had no other choice, I realized I could face everything alone just as fine, if not better.”
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said, and before Draco could ask what for, disappeared in the adjoining bathroom.
“Then what should we do? Is there something you’d like to play?” Draco asked.
They didn’t last more than 3 rounds of clothing before even Draco couldn’t care about the clothes anymore, and they ended up in bed, Draco delivering on his promise in a magnificent way.
Malfoy still eyed him suspiciously.
Draco looked at him not moving but keeping his eyes trained on him.
“I’ll help you, but only because you’re worried about your kid, otherwise I don’t respond well to threats,” Harry warned her. “I need to know what happened.”
Thinking that Lucius could tell that he was in fact, no longer a virgin, made him just drink more.
He thought so too, that Fayre was trying to correct the mistakes Draco has made, conveniently having a spell to change himself into a new person.
“It’s not about that,” Edwin sighed. “He was an intern when I got to know him, and conveniently forgot to mention his age, looking always older, and by the time I figured out, it was too late.”
And third, he knew about the Horcruxes and was willing to learn anything, because it was an interesting topic, not to mention, he also was hoping it would help him research the artifact that had brought them to this time.
Draco didn’t escape from that time just to go back there again, but it was useless arguing about it now when Potter was yet to obtain the crystal he needed for a way back.
“Harry, you have the wand, don’t do anything stupid, remember what happened with Bellatrix—”
And Draco had to admit, he was curious as well. Even if he could only determine whether or not Potter was still in his life almost 30 years later, he wanted to see.
“Yes. I believe that’s what I said. So, what should we read next?”
“Maybe. Do you often make such offers to the guests of your boss?” Ed rather just asked.
“Don’t ever call me that!” she snapped, letting go of her packing facade. “You have no right to call me by my first name as if I was your buddy!”
That’s why she wouldn’t be missing from our past, but if you send her here, we could keep an eye on her, and she could maybe start a new life. See her grandkids, and how well I’m doing…”
Draco Malfoy was pardoned somehow - mainly Hermione’s work behind the scenes, Harry thought - and wasn’t put in jail but then he visited Lucius in prison and told his father that he was gay.
“Probably.”
But hopefully you guys will see why I decided to detail a bit how the Drarry dynamics shifted even before Severus could be brought in. XOXO
But the more they traveled, the less interested he seemed to have any friends whom he'd only know for a couple of months.
“What happened?” Harry asked, trying to plant a row of potion ingredients Eileen suggested they could easily have in the garden, when Severus appeared out of nowhere, hugging him.
“But maybe I could come and visit you in Hogwarts, I think I’d feel much better there,” Lucas went on.
“I’ll need to instruct the elf taking care of him to give him some regeneration potions. His cells might be in pieces for all we know!” Harry tried to not waste time arguing, although it took an effort. No wonder his crude diagnostic spells didn’t show anything wrong with Malfoy when his body could have been damaged in such a low scale.
“But not that we know, we must stop it,” Draco said, and Eileen just nodded. “For Ed’s sake. I bet if I even just hired someone to look into Lucas’s past, we could find something horrifying we could use.”
“You think I should owl Cho and ask her how she’s doing?”
“Fuck, Draco,” was all Harry said in return, taking off his glasses, and covering his eyes with his hand. Surely, he wasn’t upset or crying, right? He couldn’t have been so disappointed that Draco wouldn’t touch him?
“I sent him to his room, I doubt he saw them. But we have company. I also sent Mindy and Pinky to try to hold them up.”
“So, are we going?” Severus asked, already out the door.
“I don’t think I have the power to muster up a Patronus. I can barely stand, Fayre,” he told the blond. He was still dying, even though he wanted to live more than ever. “You could do it, though.”
So that was the reason. Eileen met Matt on the market just after she moved in with them, and invited his daughter over, saying they could get along well with Severus, but so far Sev saw it as the girl stealing his parent away?
“You don’t trust me!” Fayre said, as if she was really upset about that. “After all, you don’t—”
“You should send someone into the future in your stead,” Severus returned, sitting down. “Ed and I have discussed this to a great length, and think it’s the best course of action since we can take care of this person better in this time.”
“Oh.”
“Even if it worked?”
Harry didn’t have to look into the mirror to know he aged, as well as Severus, so he didn’t have to struggle to come up with the first one.
Now, everything should be on track once again for the Malfoys. Lucius went to his cell to furiously brush his teeth next. If he was a girl, he’d probably have giggled and jiggled back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s… I’m not sure if we should have this conversation,” Potter buried his face in his hands.
“Oh, I’m sure he trades all his jail food for hair products at jail too,” Fayre, however, countered him without losing a beat. “He is Lucius Malfoy after all. Having better hair than his wife at all times.”
From this distance and given the already disastrous situation, it was not an easy task. Lucius fell silent, thinking. Maybe Potter would think he’s truly hurt by Draco’s rejection as well when he’s plotting silently, that couldn’t hurt either.
“The spell didn’t work for me, I’m not sure why,” he told the blond, who couldn’t help but hug Potter tightly, just to sense he was warm, alive, and well.
Truth was, he missed the grim future less and less, and he didn’t want to just leave, so he was just contempt not using what he discovered for now.
It was a challenge but Lucius, as any pureblood would, had to ensure his bloodline continued and was not mixed with anything like the Weasleys or the Granger girl.
One day, Tobias came home early and caught Eileen telling Severus Potions was a class in Hogwarts, showing her son a textbook. Tobias in a rage not only burned the book but was about to hurt their son as well, while Eileen pleaded for him to punish her instead.
Given that it was dangerous transforming any human body parts, and strictly forbidden because it could easily go wrong, he seemed almost too relaxed about it.
Rimming Harry next was what Draco never truly enjoyed doing with anybody else, but only hearing the incoherent noises Harry made it worth it.
Maybe because if Potter gave his life to get Draco out, he didn’t want to get caught by the people hunting him, honoring his sacrifice too much?
“Forget I said that,” Harry sighed, noticing how Hermione's expression was obviously worried so he better shut the whole thing down. “I should probably get going anyway.”
attracted to me?” Draco blinked, because it could have been a confession, had it not come from Potter, and with such an angry tone.
“Tell me if you feel up to it for me to start. Then I won’t stop until you tell me to stop, understood?” he was close enough to see Harry got goosebumps just by Draco whispering to his ear.
“Fred, are you sure? I always thought George was more entertaining,” Draco only said, and for just a minute Harry felt a pang of jealousy when the blond cruelly laughed at him. “Gods, you should have seen your face, Harry. That kid is obviously nothing like me. Maybe the only thing common is that we both seem to like Gryffindors.”
“Since you shouldn’t be here, I figured I should take you to one where there is a version of you as well,” the girl told him, examining the scene. “There are more where you are, so we can visit all of them.”
“WAIT! I’m here to help, just hear me out! We’re on the same side here! You know time-travel, and I know from your husband’s mind that your Dark Lord was evil, but nothing like this. And we’re both hunted, and want to undo this, I suggest at least a talk!”
Soon, it wasn’t only Draco listening to Harry talking, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder while watching the kids, but Severus and Edwin joining them with the cauldron.
See? It wasn’t Harry’s Occlumency failure, after all. Rather, his relationship failure with Draco, letting him be hurt.
“That not even the main events are written in stone, and if not, together we can fix it. Edwin is still a baby, and we can adopt him.”
“So what, that girl in your bed was just a one night stand? Do you know how the media will react if they get a sniff off this--”
Fayre even knew about the Longbottoms and had this big project of helping people with illnesses relating to the Crucio, and although she didn’t get far yet, Harry admired her for trying.
"Pvendriache is much more common and likely—”
“I have a lot of work-“
So then Lucius could swoop in afterward, and find Draco a proper Slytherin mate for life and once again, restore the family name.
After one and a half minutes in, he was between two major dark curses, both of which are deadly, but if he’s wrong, the already weakened Ron’s heart will give out during the treatment so he couldn’t risk being wrong.
“I just wanted to thank you. Severus had been missing Eileen, but he had so much fun just now,” he told Harry as if this was any explanation for the kiss. “I want you to spend time with him as well.”
“But?” Harry sensed it coming. Besides how he agreed with Severus, and he also thought Ed shouldn’t be alone.
Draco wanted to hurt Tobias badly if he couldn't Eileen, not with her condition. If Tobias was still immune to curses, and Eileen would hurt or kill Draco in return, at least he wouldn’t have to witness Severus being taken away from them.
Draco tried to answer, to tell Harry everything, but he was so drained magically, every time he regained consciousness, he couldn’t keep his eyes open enough to even start.
“That’s not how you should—“
“I just wish I could find Draco, after all,” Harry found himself saying since it was only Fayre and he trusted her. Maybe even better than Hermione these days.
“You’re killing him! It’s a Krashkalwiat, all the symptoms match!” however Fayre genuinely seemed to be upset.
“You couldn’t have known,” Harry told her, his mind racing. If Ron dies, nor Hermione nor he will ever be right again. After what they have been gone through in the war… but he isn’t supposed to think like that! “Everything is gonna be ok—”
Only, Draco couldn’t help but notice Saint Potter was also ready to jump the other man who was almost as big as the gamekeeper in Hogwarts, completely ignoring Draco who tried to stop him.
But then when Harry got to the Library, Severus was reading by himself, and Mindy was watching over him.
“You can’t expect him not to pick up on if you’re unwell,” Harry went on. “And given that for 3 years, you have been doing nothing but schooling him at home, and working non-stop in the afternoons, making more money than you'll probably ever spend, I’m sure you’re exhausted.”
to show Potter how they might have had a truce, but he was - even if not legally - still a Malfoy.
“Aurors?” Draco grabbed his wand. He didn’t think the Ministry had a way of telling whether they Time-travelled with the artifact or not, but it was possible that some Unspeakables maybe could.
He had read in a random magical theory book he'd need an object that was originally from the time he wanted to travel.
Harry probably enjoyed what they were doing so much he fell asleep when they were done, only to wake up in the tub, and Draco washing him before filling the tub with hot water and sitting both of them down.
But, as the day progressed, he wanted to spend time with the older Harry but also wasn’t sure he should, so ended up in their Library, hiding.
But that was when the troubles also started. Severus barely ate, and almost threw a tantrum when Draco tried to tell him to at least finish the tiny amount he already had on his plate. Severus, who was otherwise reserved, quiet and never disobeyed anything Draco said before.
Before, even if he didn’t know he’d succeed, always had clear objectives. Responsibilities too important to ignore. Expectations, people’s eyes following him.
“You think I wouldn’t accept you with a wizard? After all, our Dads-“ Severus questioned Ed while they were swiftly advancing in the Ministry’s building.
“Wait,” Harry stepped in front of Draco, touching him until he realized what he was doing and quickly let go. “Maybe we could have a game. Me and Severus competing with you.”
Now, instead, his family’s whole reputation and fate were laid in the hands of Potter. Not a result or even sighting of his son, and even Narcissa’s helping the Chosen One - or, as Lucius liked to call Harry in himself, the BGI, standing for Biggest Griffindor Idiot, - yielded any results. Unacceptable.
“Maybe someone at your work,” Malfoy suddenly turned, now facing him with fiery eyes.
Then, not so much after, Harry did end up in bed with her, and being not quite sober, he forgot one crucial detail.
“Lucas. Well,-“
Having probably the best sleep since the war was over, waking up to how Draco turned in his sleep and was now facing him, looking younger without a scowl on, sleeping peacefully.
But, that didn’t make Harry feel better.
and assumed Harry was not only straight but into her as well before Harry could escape her (Jack laughing in the background).
“So, we won’t keep you for long,” Eileen announced. “We’re extremely grateful that you helped us looking after Severus, but we’re here to get him back.”
One minute he was sitting at his desk in the morning, the next, he got a splitting headache, and memories that weren’t his own - yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But we wouldn’t be able to collect said ingredients just a trek away, and meet the donkey my Muggle guide introduced me to when I first went.”
joy,” Malfoy then spoke up in such a sarcastic voice that it could have easily beaten Snape’s usual monologues had the potion master been there. “No matter that I’m no longer a girl and don’t live in this house, we still see each other every morning.”
“You don’t think there is more to you than your good looks and Quidditch moves?” Draco suddenly was leaning quite close again, keeping eye contact, but then turning away. “Anyway, it wasn’t a request. Eileen herself said you’ll have to be involved, and you promised. Plus, I still employ you. So if I tell you to be a babysitter for a couple of hours every day, you’ll do it without as much of as a single complaint.”
“What does it look like? I’m a Potion Master and a Curse-healer. You’re going to need my help!”
“Bloody Baron in Hogwarts, what the Seven Seas of Azkaban are you doing in my room, Potter!”
“I wouldn’t mind either way,” Harry however answered, and that made Draco laugh.
He swore he won’t surrender those memories to anyone, as surely Snape wouldn’t want anyone to see, but in this case, Harry was technically trying to save small Severus from his own future, so he broke the only rule.
“I don’t mind, but I don’t like it if you insult my intelligence by lying about it. I’d rather if you told me and I knew what to expect, given that Severus now depends on you just as much as on me.”
“Drink tea on the terrace, take walks, visit the kids and the grandkids, or take care of business,” Harry listed. “We sometimes even go to Muggle cinema, you seem to like films which are so classy that they need subtitles.”
Severus never saw Ed blush, but now even his ears went slightly pink, and he avoided eye-contact as if his life depended on it.
He was researching searching-spells, performing them all in look for Draco. He was also researching Grimmauld Place’s old magic, trying to have Fayre in the house, but not in his bed every morning.
By the time Harry and Draco got home, the blond seemed to calm down somewhat, so Harry didn’t have to start so carefully around the topic.
Draco only dropped his guard for a second hearing that and understanding what it meant, but it was enough for two nasty curses to hit him on the back as well, and by then Eileen was dead in his arms.
Meanwhile, Fayre was attentive, often joking and could help herself out, didn’t need a house-elf’s help for anything, not even for cleaning the potions dishes or such.
As long as her husband was gone, she was free to use magic and encourage Severus to do the same. If she wasn’t reading him books on magical theory, or try to teach him to read. Singing him to sleep at night, acting out fairy tales with him, always changing every story to have a happy end.
Maybe if Harry didn’t end up in the past because of Malfoy, he would have tried something even more stupid.
“You’re wrong. She was always like this. She just couldn’t act the way she wanted and now she’s free to. Which… makes me want to get there before she kills Lucius. Can you help me get up, Ron?”
“He doesn’t have the knowledge and experiences I have, though,” Fayre insisted. “And I could be a good friend and let you decide and kill Weasley or I could just cure him, for I’m sure—”
He also had access to restricted books and spent every afternoon with reading and Severus, joined by Draco for dinners or when they were socializing.
And he laughed, which coming from this close, made Fayre be even more disgusted with him than before.
“I haven’t been-“
“Look, now that he saw how good of a flyer you were, you don’t need me,” Harry said.
It wasn’t just a future Draco and Harry couldn’t move to, it wasn’t a future that was acceptable.
he did and read during the day, only to compliment him on any small achievement.
“How old?”
For this, Ron, who was up to hold Harry back just got into a fighting position too. Hermione and Fayre’s eyes met, both worried.
“Those creatures, I’m afraid, belong only to fairy tales, not to the royal court,” Draco took a sip from his cup, and Harry was both irritated and amused by it.
“Maybe Draco could take Severus somewhere else while we talk,” Harry proposed.
Draco saw how Severus seemingly learned how to fit in anywhere with the kids, not even the language barrier stopping him, nor was it a problem whether they were magicals or Muggles.
This was good news. The Trio overpowered her captor by both with manpower and magical power. He was over, just didn’t know yet. Only, Harry needed to calm down.
There were so many questions about these simple facts now in Harry’s head he didn’t know which one to ask first. And, that’s when Ed also arrived through the Floo - at least he looked so much like his brother Harry didn’t have any doubts it could only have been him.
“He was trying to teach you as a favor but you behaved like a child. You despise Severus!” she declared, pulling back. “Leave! I’ll fetch my son, I have a tracing charm on him now, and I don’t want you or Malfoy to ever come back here!”
“Are you alright?” he helped Potter to stand, and couldn’t help but feel the thug deserved what he got when he saw the black eye Harry sported now.
“You might be able to go back.”
“Potter!"
And he tried to keep Draco happy while trying to not hit on the blond. But how were they supposed to live their whole lives only having each other as constant, yet acting as if they were divorcees, only tolerating each other for the sake of the kid?
“Let me guess, if you win, we have to get rid of Lucas?”
“I have met someone,” he finally decided to talk with Draco. If he was going to do this, he wanted to do it right, as honest as Matt could be.
But, Lucas just laughed at him.
So he went excruciatingly slow next, but with quite forceful and deep trusts, denying what Harry so desperately wanted to reach, and only picking up some speed once again when he felt like he wouldn’t last otherwise anymore.
Severus told Harry in their heads.
“One time, in seven months, I was attacked by a witch who tried to-“
As if they had an unspoken agreement with Draco over the last few weeks, every task between them was divided.
Then he worked well into the night, completely forgetting about time, so when he got back to his room, he was a bit shocked to find Draco there.
Draco should protect Potter just as much Potter has protected him in the past, even if it was from himself.
Harry almost thought how much like Sirius his smiles were before he tore himself away from the eye-contact.
Two men trying to check in to a Muggle hotel with a child didn’t go well. So Draco put a minor Disillusionment charm on himself and Severus, while Harry went back to MACUSA asking around for magical accommodation possibilities, and returned with an elderly wizard.
First, he didn’t have to depend on Malfoy entirely this way. Even if they trusted each other now, his pride wouldn’t let that happen.
“From what I’ve seen, all I have to do is make sure he’ll never meet your mother and he’d be better off.”
“You might be a convict, but I could still petition for visitation rights as your husband,” he told Draco, only joking. He wouldn’t let anyone lock Malfoy up. He’d rather travel to yet another time again just to avoid that.
Warning, some fluff ahead! XD I guess I wanted to show how Drarry's relationship evolved in an unconventional(?) way, but not even I could see this coming until the first draft.
“My name is Fayre Smith, and I am a member of the Order, recruited from France.”
“This is my daughter, Clara. My partner, Noel, took it on himself to use a highly risky spell to carry her and didn’t survive her birth. I would have done it myself, except I’m almost a Squib, only feeling other’s magic,” he told the little girl to go and buy some sweets, only then adding. “And you have such a magnificent power Harry, it’s makes me wonder what other talents of yours could I see if I could get to know you a little better.”
He could afford it too, but mostly he was opposed to the idea because this way, he could spend more time with Severus.
Draco’s pulse picked up, but he wasn’t going to let it show, not when the topic suddenly turned to this.
Harry did, and in the meanwhile, a very (very!) old Mindy appeared, and bought a tray of food, while Severus directed them to a Library to talk.
Luckily, his hesitation only meant Malfoy transformed Harry’s clothes for him as well, resembling a butler’s, except Harry was sure Draco never really saw one in real life, maybe not even on pictures.
Harry considered how he didn’t even say goodbye to the redhead. He was terrified to lose Ron in the war, but when he didn’t, he automatically thought Ron would live into an old age like Arthur was getting into, with kids and Hermione, and now this…
Harry would have enjoyed staying in his arms pretending to be still asleep, but he wasn't going to.
Then, Fayre was finished with the spell, which took so much effort on her side that she collapsed, leaving Harry and Hermione to get back their wands, and also get Fayre’s, but for Ron, it could have been already too late.
“Let me see,” Harry also tried a couple of spells, and it wouldn’t give. And the magic was familiar. “House-elf magic.”
“Oh, you poor dragon-egg-shell, you must be shocked to lay eyes on a Malfoy with their full grace!” Fayre told him, and Harry couldn’t hold back a laugh.
PWP & M/M Warning!
afford. What a pity.
Harry frowned. Maybe he should move if the situation made him this awkward, but he really considered that place his home, the one he got from Sirius. Plus, with his research for Draco, where would he find the time to move?
And threatening to hurt him if Harry didn’t give up his wand.
“I never killed anyone, but for you, I think I’ll don’t have the problem mastering up a killing curse, you bastard,” Harry said, making Hermione nervous.
“No, it’s not. I guess it leaves one thing,” Lucius concluded. “You must have got a girlfriend!”
All of this work had kept him far away from Library, only to show up when Severus was yelling at Draco, clearly upset.
He had to admit though until he could come up with a better plan, even this arrangement was better than not seeing Severus at all.
“I will also deal with him, if I have to,” Harry just mentally sighed. He hoped Eileen would see a reason to at least negotiate with Draco, but if not, Harry also wasn’t looking forward to policing Malfoy.
And Merlin, it almost sounded as if Draco was jealous for a second, which he couldn’t have been, because A) Harry didn’t have anyone and B) he was Draco Malfoy, ice king of Slytherin, surely better than petty jealousy.
“Oh, how is it my fault?” Draco just hoped the elves made the room soundproof or Severus was sleeping already, not overhearing any of it. “Since when is it a problem if you come home saying you’re seeing someone, and I try to let you, choosing to be civil about it?”
Which wasn’t that smart, after all.
“Oh, I’m most certainly not—”
Investments helped Draco relax, they weren’t making trouble. Nor was schooling Severus, and Draco’s hobby was reading, and books they had plenty.
