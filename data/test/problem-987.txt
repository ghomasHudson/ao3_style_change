Hermione gives him a practised eye-roll. “Please. The last time you completed a case report, Robards said—and I’m quoting here—
Hermione looks like she’s about to object, but then she glances at Harry. “I’ll be up in a minute, Hannah.”
“Well, I for one wish you both every happiness,” Parkinson says. “Would that we were all better at putting childish rivalries behind us.” Her tone is pointed, as if it’s the Gryffindors who are the petty ones. As if anything they lived through as children could be described as
“I wish you’d called,” she says, and from anyone else it would sound like an apology for the state of the cosy little house, with buckets of baby clothes washing themselves on the kitchen bench and piles of tedious-looking books stacked all over the dining table.
Harry can feel his anger like a physical thing, roiling under his skin and making his magic waver and flex. “You misled me,” he spits out, trying to keep himself under control. He should have known she’d do something like this, Slytherin to the bloody core.
killing is his history, really. At least, that part of his history he and Harry shared, that long-ago night at Hogwarts. Harry, compelled to watch in silence; Malfoy, the boy who couldn't cast the curse, not even when he had the chance, when he believed his life, his parents' lives, depended on it. Better than anyone, Harry knows that Malfoy is not a killer.
“I genuinely don’t know enough about it,” she says, and Harry’s heart sinks. “I’m still learning. But you know, Harry, if you don’t want to work with Draco on this, there might be someone else willing to help.”
,” he says, as if that explains everything. “I think the Gryffindors are in the library or doing something equally dull. Except for the Weaselette. Not sure where she wandered off to.”
Draco smiles, stepping into his space and clouding Harry’s judgement by being clad only in a towel. But Draco’s all business, taking the errant blue silk and manhandling it swiftly and carefully into submission, pinning it in place with a silver arrow tie pin.
He’s expecting a negative reaction. For Harry to be incensed and accuse him of manipulating him in some way, the ancestral magical equivalent of dosing him with Amortentia. He’s
“And then we both went upstairs. Luna said she was off to have a bath and unwind, and I was going to find Hermione because she’d been after a book about ancient lycanthropy that Hogwarts didn’t have and I’d seen a copy downstairs and thought I’d let her know. But she didn’t answer her door when I knocked.”
Thinking about the stabilising spells as a prosthesis is useful, he realises. The metaphor is a little clumsy, but he’s worked out that, in order to fix the rings the way he usually would, Lily’s ring first needs a kind of a transplant. If he can
“Yes, yes. Arrest me. You can do that later, I promise.” He pushes past Harry to the door. Harry sighs. They always make a break for it.
Potter scrapes his plate clean. “I don’t really care about the house stuff. My home is in New York, and Godric’s Hollow is destroyed,” he concludes, and Draco thinks for a horrifying moment that he might actually lick his knife, but he eventually just deposits his cutlery on the table. “But I really want the things out of the vault, so. The sooner you can sort it, the better, I guess.”
No one seems particularly hungry, picking at the food the elves have arrayed on the sideboard. They seem to have gone to a special effort, with piles of lavish-looking pastries and steaming chafing dishes full of bacon and sausages. Neville gamely makes an attempt at loading up a plate.
“And then nothing.” He straightens up a little as he says it, trying to imbue the words with a confidence he doesn’t feel. “I had a whole life here before Harry sodding Potter came along. And it will continue after he’s gone.”
where it would injure them or others. Sometimes it’s easy, you know? Repaying money you owed, or fixing something you broke when you fell down their stairs. But sometimes whatever you try might makes things much worse. Open old wounds.”
Harry swallows hard. He doesn’t give a shit about Lucius Malfoy, but Narcissa…it occurs to him he might have wondered before now what had happened to her.
Draco leads them back to the library, and Harry takes a moment to feel warm and slightly uncomfortable at how at home he seems in Harry’s house. As if it’s an everyday sort of occurrence that they have their friends over for toast and eggs and a spot of light research. He busies himself cleaning up the kitchen, and wonders where the hell Kreacher has gotten to.
“It’s beautiful,” she says, running a gentle finger over the surface of a delicate glass bauble, hand painted with spindly silver snowflakes. Then she arches an eyebrow at Harry. “And very familiar.”
Malfoy takes a half-step back as Harry barrels uninvited into his personal space. Harry bites his tongue to stop himself from pointing out Malfoy hadn’t exactly objected the last few times they’d been together. It doesn’t help to think about that, though. Harry shakes his head and tries to focus.
Harry’s still pretty confused. Cheating on an Advent calendar seems like classic Draco Malfoy, but one bit of chocolate is surely the same as the other. He says as much to Luna.
“No!” Harry protests, holding his arms up while she waves her wand at him, but even she only seems to manage to shift the glitter around a bit.
“But it was just a civil ceremony. You made it mean something.” Harry rights himself again and manages to get the jeans up over his arse, leaning over to dig around on the floor for his shirt. He emerges triumphant, tugging it over his head. Draco’s disappointed to see the stag tattoo disappear beneath his sleeve.
“What things?” she asks, and Harry goes to respond but his tongue feels thick and slow in his mouth for a moment and he ends up just shaking his head with a smile. He catches sight of Luna passing in her garishly-coloured healers’ robes and makes his excuses quickly, thanking Dennis for his efforts as he dashes out the door.
The Ravenclaw boys dormitory doesn’t bring on the same flood of emotions he’d felt in the Slytherin rooms. He and Draco move carefully around each other in the dim light, stacking their schoolmates’ belongs into neat piles against one curved wall.
Second, Harry’s finally beginning to understand that maybe it wasn’t the same for Draco. That for him it was — maybe not something more — but maybe the
“She told Ron and Cassie the two of them went upstairs with the last of the wine after dinner. Her wand shows her casting a
“I thought you weren’t really that interested. That you didn’t really care, one way or the other,” Harry says.
“And Neville?” Hermione says, rushing over to the couch as if she can pick up his arm and solve the mystery.
“He’s so fast,” Harry overhears her saying dreamily to Belinda Morgan as they head in from the pitch to get changed one afternoon. “I’ve never seen anyone fly like that.”
The sun is setting when they get back to the farmhouse and Draco says he wants to give him something, walking back to his room. Harry drifts along after him, wondering how poorly George would react if he brought Draco back to Grimmauld Place for dinner. He trips on the floorboard and swears, slamming his weak wrist into the doorframe to right himself.
He reaches into the box and takes out a truffle, popping it into his mouth, and Harry does the same. It explodes in an overwhelming sensation of dark cocoa and orange and it’s so
He’s suddenly absurdly grateful for her. For her calm presence and canny intelligence and her unending optimism.
Harry nods. “The Aurors are confident it wasn’t you, Mrs Malfoy. And they seem equally certain that it wasn’t your son.”
“You know how much I was looking forward to it, is the thing. Being an Auror. Training with you. And when I realised there was no way George was going to be able to carry on without help, it just felt like my choices were taken away from me a bit, is all. And then any time I felt bad about that, I’d think about Fred, and I’d feel even worse.” He sniffs again. “And then I’d see you, all spiffed up in your uniform, front page of the
“This is the guestlist for August,” he says, running his finger down the names one more time. “Can you prepare the invitations?” The elf nods and reaches for the parchment, but Draco pauses, as he does every month, before uselessly adding a final name to the list.
curse breakers, a team of which have fortunately managed to finally re-enter the ballroom at the Langley by the time he arrives.
“He was smothered?” Harry looks up in surprise. Somehow, with all the talk of poisoning and fights, this wasn’t at all what he’d expected.
“Possibly, Potter,” Malfoy drawls from behind him, causing Harry to startle and step quickly to one side so that Malfoy’s able to move past him into the room. “But that doesn’t account for the fact that I apparently know you take your tea with milk and two sugars, and shellfish give you hives.” He smells like the lemon soap in Harry’s bathroom, and some other woody scent that shouldn’t be at all familiar but is. Harry holds his breath for a second trying to keep his balance.
Draco digs around under his pillow for his wand, stretching the bed out a few extra feet. Harry tugs off his jeans and slides under the covers, tucking himself against his chest.
When Teddy’s raced off up the stairs, complaining loudly that his hands are clean and that washing them again is a waste of water and bad for the environment, Draco turns back to find Potter staring at him.
Malfoy certainly seems pretty different from outward appearances, but Harry’s not going to admit that to Ron. He’s not sure he trusts himself to describe Malfoy without using words like
Harry frowns. “I wanted a BLT?”  He always gets a BLT. And he likes them best from here because the bacon is extra crispy.
nonsense! I don’t see why I’m forced to pretend otherwise at my own dining table. What a collection of absolute riff-raff. It’s just as well we don’t have any bloody family portraits in here — our ancestors would be
Malfoy seems unfazed. “I thought we could go back to the Manor. There’s a hill behind the stables that I went sledding on as a child, that should suffice.”
“He goes to university somewhere near here. I think,” she goes on, ignoring Harry’s flabbergasted reaction. “Or maybe his flat is near here, I forget which.”
They eat the sandwiches in front of Harry’s television. Draco apparently got used to the Muggle technology in France but doesn’t have one in the Manor, so he’s content to tuck his socked feet under Harry’s leg while they watch a movie.
The Ministry party looks pretty magnificent, even if Harry’s very tired of ice-skating. The rink is charmed with purple light that seems to come from within the ice itself, and all of the trees that line the square are wrapped with tiny lights dancing like fireflies. Musicians play carols on a low podium at one end, and catering elfs move through the crowd with trays of Christmas cocktails.
—concedes, with a rueful smile. “What would that letter even have said? How could I have apologised sincerely enough, thanked you
“Scarves. I have to get them to drop stitches occasionally,” he admits, flushing a little with embarrassment. “Or mum will realise mine aren’t quite as lumpy as hers.”
“My pleasure,” Parkinson says, her voice dripping in sarcasm, as she gets up and strides out of the room.
Harry feels instantly awkward, like he’s been caught staring inappropriately. “I mean, she’s very talented. It’s not that I think she’s—”
“Hello Draco,” Lovegood says with a warm smile, as if he’s right on time, and hasn’t just been dragged here more or less against his will.
The shrieking seems to go up a notch and is distressing enough that Harry grabs a robe and hurries from the room in the direction of what sounds more and more like sobs and plaintive wails for help.
it’s not Obliviation. And you should count yourself lucky you can go to a hospital in this country at all.”
needs to interact with the spell directly, so there’s no way to protect himself in this, either. Assuming this is successful, Hermione will be very cross with him when he tells her this part.
Draco gives a disbelieving sort of hum, but his hands slide to Harry’s hips and Harry forgets what they were talking about for a bit.
“Here it is,” Hermione finally announces, triumphant. The glass case is dusty, and she fumbles with the ornate lock on it for several minutes, before reluctantly turning to Harry. He touches his wand to the keyhole and it clicks open. The little diary seems unassuming but Hermione handles it with great care, slipping it into a soft-looking cloth bag that she pulls from her pack.
“Well it’s not actually your mail, is it? It’s all part of this sodding scheme. Unless you’re the one who faked being me to open a postbox in the first place.”
Kreacher is waiting for him when he gets home, twitching at the curtains like some sort of nosy neighbour.
“Oh, don’t be dense, Potter. How the fuck do you think I wound up playing unsanctioned games in the first place? You think I left here after the war and just thought that would be a fun thing to try my hand at?” He gives Harry an incredulous expression, as if Harry’s deliberately messing with him.
“Malfoys have hosted the Solstice Banquet for seven generations,” she would say to him each year, as if this was new information. “It is our great honour and privilege to carry on this tradition.”
Malfoy takes it from him and heads out the front door, Harry on his heels. It’s fully dark outside now, and Harry realises his neighbours have already been decorating. An inflatable Santa bobs eerily in the front yard next door, and strings of lights hang from the bare branches of the apple tree on the other side.
Malfoy produces a parchment pad out of nowhere and starts to scribble notes. He looks around the dark, dingy room and back at the calendar, and then scribbles again.
“I couldn’t believe you’d survived. That you’d finally managed to put a stop to it all. I was so bloody grateful for you. I hated you so much and at the same time I was so
Eventually, when the food is gone, the plates put away to wash themselves, and the kids tucked up in their room, Harry runs out of reasons not to talk about it.
They leave the Hall and walk towards the giant doors to the school, pushing them gently out into the sun. Harry takes a deep lungful of air, smiling at the sight of the lake shining before them.
Except that when Draco comes to the Farm the following Monday to send some email and to give Jack copies of the planning consents for the guesthouse, he finds Potter crouching in the sun by the chapel looking at a door that Jack has off its frame.
Draco leans in and kisses him softly. “It’s going to be fine. I know your Weasleys love their Christmases, but you’re ready. The house looks beautiful. Kreacher has made enough food to feed all of Hogwarts twice over.”
“Hmm, let’s see,” she muses, as if she’s giving the question serious consideration, tapping one perfectly-manicured red nail against her cheek. “Could it be the MBA from Harvard Business School? The four years working leveraged M&A for Morgan Stanley in New York? My restructure of the Arena Football League in the United States, or the two separate Quodpot franchises I’ve rescued from bankruptcy? Hard to say, Potter, hard to say.”
He drums his fingers on his knee. “It’s just a bit of fun,” he lies, looking up at the woosh of the carriage rocketing past them, all of the occupants screaming bloody murder. “People can shag without it meaning anything.”
“I…” Harry falters. Everyone in wizarding Britain knows about his bloody leg. He’s never had to explain it to anyone. “I was injured. In my second season.”
Harry decides to Apparate to the Manor grounds and walk up, hoping the fresh air will clear his head. The last thing he needs right now is to step out of a fireplace and find himself immediately in some sort of awkward encounter with Malfoy.
This, of course, is Harry’s chance to back out and save face. He could immediately clarify that, no,
Another uniformed elf circulates through the room with a tray of canapés. Harry stuffs several in his mouth at once, garnering twin looks of disapproval from Hermione and Parkinson. He doesn’t care. If he has to be here, he’s not going to starve, and the food is delicious.
“Merlin,” Hermione sighs. “I wanted to have my bag packed and be through the Floo the moment that breakfast was over.”
Harry heads to the Healers’ station to find out which room Belle’s in. Scary Magda glares at him over her stack of files, so he looks for someone a little more approachable. The other staff are gathered in a huddle discussing something stuck to the wall.
“Let’s get back to the office and make a plan. We can Apparate from around the back of that pub,” Ron says, waiting for a gap in the traffic to duck across the road.
“We should have put a bubble charm on you before we started, like when we coach the Little Harpies over the summer!”
The bartender nods. “Hogwarts lets them Floo down for the evening. It’s an approved extracurricular. Draco over there takes responsibility for getting them back afterwards.”
“It was really the only way, last year. I was sure I’d be able to manage it, once the new concession stand opened.”
Dean squeezes his arm fondly and pulls out a chair, and when Draco looks across the table he sees Potter eyeing them both with something that on anyone else would look like jealousy. On the No Strings Attached Saviour it’s probably just indigestion.
and shuts his eyes, visualising the diagnostic spell lines, running the pad of his thumb around the edge of the ring.
He’s got a decent armful when he hears behind him, “There’s a spell for that.” Suddenly all of the small twigs and bits of dead wood around him float gently up from the ground and drift away from him. He spins around to find them stacking themselves in a tidy pile in front of Malfoy.
“But there’s a significant risk that it will.” It’s not a question. He knows the answer. Knew it the minute he saw the look on her face.
Harry doesn’t have an ounce of sympathy for whatever Malfoy’s been through since the war. He didn’t wind up in Azkaban, and as far as Harry’s concerned, that was mercy enough. Harry hasn’t thought about him since.
Lily died. Her ultimate sacrifice, borne out of her great love for Harry, tore the very magic from her line to defend him.
Harry goes to stand up Seamus’ trunk from where it lies on its side. He turns it the wrong way and the contents spill further out on the floor.
that?!” he hisses, fear turning his words furious. The rest of the group look more startled at Harry’s outburst than Malfoy, who meets Harry’s glare with a cool expression.
It doesn’t seem like the right time to for Harry to broach the fact that he’s planning to invite a dozen people over for Christmas, so he lets him go.
It’s only as Harry reaches the driveway, the crunch of frozen gravel noisy under his boots, that he hears Malfoy call, “Thank you,” from behind him. He gives a little wave, but doesn’t look back.
be feeling faced with a former Death Eater, and the much more confusing sense of curiosity that seems to be winning out. Some part of him ought to be furious that Malfoy is just
It’s an opportunity Harry should take. To explain to them both that it’s not a leave of absence. That it wasn’t even a formal resignation really. Just another foul-tempered fight with Robards; the last in a long line of them. But he’s not ready yet. To talk about how being an Auror proved to be nothing like he’d imagined. All the ways in which nothing about his post-War life has turned out quite the way they planned.
She steps daintily forward, and before any of them can even yell their objections, half a dozen knives have flung themselves directly at her. Neville yanks Luna to the ground, as at least two of the blades slide discouragingly through Harry’s shield and embed themselves shudderingly in the door frame above them.
play Quidditch exactly the way I’d expect from someone who’s spent a lifetime cheating. Daddy had to buy your way onto your first team, you’ve had to resort to underhanded tricks and deception ever since.”
The Weasley family Secret Santa draw was instituted the year Hugo was born and Ginny and Neville got engaged. The sheer number of gifts people felt like they needed to buy had become unwieldy, and even though the family was much more comfortably off than they had been in the past—given the success of Wheezes, and the Order of Merlin stipends—Arthur finally put his foot down. Molly sobbed for two days straight that he’d destroyed the spirit of Christmas, but now seems to have been won over by the ritual of the draw and the chance to host the whole family for yet another occasion.
Malfoy comes to an abrupt halt, staring down at Harry’s hand on his arm with an incredulous expression. There’s an awkward silence, and Harry lets go at once, irrationally hoping he hasn’t wrinkled the cuff in some way.
, look, I’ve already solved your little problem.”  He tosses his quill down on the desk, rounding it to rummage under the top layer of papers for a book, which he passes to Harry. It looks extremely old, and he can barely make out the faded silver title:
When he arrives at the bar, everyone is in high spirits. Draco asks Mei, a soft-spoken Ravenclaw who sometimes plays guitar, to be the emcee for the evening. He likes to share that role around, so that the evening is entirely about the young people and not about him. He doesn’t do anything now, really, except pay for their soft drinks and adjudicate the occasional dispute about who gets to perform when.
. Ron, however, immediately trots after him, starting up a steady stream of conversation, replaying every spell cast in the hunt.
Harry was sure it would be fine to wait until the next day, but when he got home the situation at Grimmauld seemed to have deteriorated further. Harry could see his breath in front of his face, it was so cold inside. He contemplated the one bright spot in the house: his sparkling advent calendar. Even that seemed to have taken on a slightly desperate tint, and he realised he’d missed a day. Door ten was stuck so firmly he wound up taking a butter knife to it to prise it open. The picture behind was of a gingerbread house, but it honestly looked more suited to Halloween than Christmas, with broken windows and sagging eaves. The eleventh door revealed mistletoe hanging over a door.  It looked cheery, but honestly the idea of kissing anyone this festive season seemed so remote that Harry just wanted to laugh. No chance of fulfilling that task. He banked the fire in his bedroom, dragged two more duvets from his spare rooms, and hoped that Malfoy would have some answers for him in the morning. It took him a long time to fall asleep.
He’s not even really sure why Harry is here, sitting on the end of his bed, watching him pack a bag. They’d talked about going to the Wand, but Draco has an early Portkey and he’s not really in the mood, and Harry seems distracted and out of sorts. Like he’s spoiling for an argument.
Andromeda takes Teddy home with promises of Boxing Day lunch, leaving Harry and Draco standing beside the iron railings of the little church.
“Can we talk?” she asks softly, waiting to see if he’ll take off her head. It’s still extremely tempting, but he nods. She climbs the remaining steps and sits, a careful distance away from him.
. But the only thing more scandalous would be to be suspected of murder. He’s hated everything about being caught up in this investigation; I can’t see why he’d have brought it on himself.”
Now that Harry’s not keeping his practicing with Leila to himself, he has her come to the club. They work together in the afternoons, once the team has moved inside to the gym. The days shorten with winter fast approaching, and increasingly by the time they finish, they’ve had to turn the stadium spotlights on to be able to even see each other from opposite ends of the pitch.
“Tell us all about your plans,” she goes on, leaning forward and propping her chin on her hands in an almost-parody of rapt attention. “Have you picked out a dress?”
As they make their way through the concourse after the game Harry convinces Draco to buy him a basket of magpie wings—thankfully actually made from chicken. The queue is long and they have to wait a little, so it’s nothing but bad luck that has them passing the stairs down from the VIP area just as Archie Allsop appears.
Harry pulls out a small Mokeskin bag from which he digs out a broken shard of glass. “It’s part of a pair. I broke mine, unfortunately, but it still works. You just say my name into yours, and we’ll be able to talk to each other.”
Almost immediately he feels worse. Wonders if he can somehow spell Lancelot back to the house. He doesn’t know what to do with himself, and next thing he knows he's rushing out into the back garden, trying to get a proper lungful of air. He just needs something to do with his
Both Harry and Ron glance back and forth between the two of them in confusion, as Malfoy and Hermione seem to have a silent conversation with one another.
As he bounds down the bank steps, back into the sunshine of Diagon, something catches his eye. He swings around to see none other than Draco Malfoy standing outside Madame Malkin’s, chatting with a witch he doesn’t recognise. Malfoy is tall, dressed in Muggle clothes with sunglasses pushed up in his bright blond hair. He says something that makes the witch laugh, gesturing animatedly while he tells his story with pale hands. He looks relaxed and happy, two things Harry can’t ever remember associating with his childhood rival.
“White, two sugars,” Harry responds, setting the coffee cup and the pastry down on Malfoy’s desk. If Malfoy asks, it was definitely the barista who knew his order, and not a piece of information Harry’s somehow come to know through paying entirely too much attention.
The first time they’d slept together was over two years ago now. Harry had been exhausted after three long weeks of trailing around Manchester, proving that a terrible little trickster was bilking war widows out of their pensions. The inn in the wizarding district had been fully booked, so he’d transfigured his clothes and walked into a Muggle hotel, desperate for a hot bath and cool sheets. When he’d seen Malfoy at the bar, his first instinct had been to punch him just for the sake of it. It felt like fate playing a cruel trick.
expensive structural damage, and there’s only so far being the “saviour of the wizarding world” will get you. Harry’s never missed the money—he has Grimmauld Place to live in and enough to get by—but he remembers how completely intractable the bankers were.
Harry feels his face heat for no plausible reason and backs quickly out of the room, dashing up the stairs to his bathroom and stripping out of his damp exercise clothes. Under the water, he tips his face back and tries to calm his thoughts. His brain seems to be stuck in an endless loop of incredulity.
rush to confess to your friends about our late night activities as soon as they opened their investigation?” Draco gives him a mean-spirited glare. He knows for a fact that Harry had kept it to himself until Parkinson had dobbed them in.
Draco tries to get into a routine with the rings. First thing in the mornings he goes to the gym, before working in the vault until he tires his core too much to continue safely. In the early afternoons, he Floos to the Manor to rest and research until it’s time to collect Teddy from school. It’s painstaking work but he has, at least, managed to separate the two rings from one another. James Potter’s ring can wait, he knows how to mend it. So he focuses all his time and attention on the ornate silver band that had been Lily’s.
Hermione glances at her watch, as if to say that mid-afternoon is a little early without saying anything at all.
Harry nods and leads the way, waving his wand to send the memorial sign back to wherever it came from and opening the gate. They force their way through the overgrown garden to the front door, which is still in one piece.
“Look, I want to be clear,” Harry says, suddenly serious. “I want that very much. But you were right just before. Now's not the time, not until we’ve worked out what happened here. You and your mother need to be able to move on from this properly. Isn’t that what we’ve learned? That running away from things doesn’t exactly work?”
The team are crammed around a couple of small tables in the little café downstairs, stuffing their faces with pastry and talking far too loudly for Harry’s delicate constitution. He heads straight for the coffee machine and fetches himself a sizeable mug.
“Did you fight a pile of rocks?” she asks with a grimace, forcing him to sit while she heals the scrapes and washes the dust off his hands.
of a reaction. He keeps turning it over in his mind as he showers and heats Molly’s lasagne for his dinner. Like a sore tooth he can’t stop prodding with his tongue. For the first time in years, he thinks about the Marauders’ Map, tucked away in a box in his closet at home.
He’s still half-convinced based on their track record that the bathroom will try to drown them, but if it does, at least they’ll be together.
Ron is looking much healthier the next morning, but agrees with Hannah that he’ll spend one more day recovering before joining them again.
“Look, you don’t have to like Draco, or even speak to him if you don’t want to. You just have to concentrate on your part of the plan. He’s always been clever, he’ll learn the ritual steps quickly. And there’s absolutely no upside for him if we fail.”
“And you? Last time I spoke to Dromeda she said you were coaching something…” she trails off and waves her hand dismissively. It rankles.
She shakes her head slowly. “No, I … you’re absolutely right. We need to take a much firmer stance. What Kingsley’s proposing is outrageous.”
When he pulls back, he smooths Harry’s hair back gently from his forehead, looking at him as if he’s something precious. Harry’s not sure anyone has ever looked at him quite like this before.
Harry takes them, unable to look Malfoy in the face and concentrating instead on the buttery soft leather and complicated stitching of his gloves. Malfoy turns them both in a slow glide and Harry very much wants the ice to crack open and swallow him, so that he doesn’t have to think about the crisp scent of Malfoy’s cologne or just how close the pale skin of his cheek is. Then he makes the mistake of looking up, and decides it’s Malfoy’s wintery eyes that are absolutely going to be the death of him.
The weather on Friday is beautiful. Draco Portkeys to Hogwarts with Teddy and Andromeda, who are both staying in the castle. The school puts on tours and performances throughout the day, ending with an exhibition Quidditch match, and they wander together around the school grounds. For Teddy, who turns eleven in a year, it’s unbearably thrilling, even given the serious circumstances. He squirms with excitement, trying very hard to sit still while the History of Magic students present their assignments on the war, and he’s absolutely entranced by the moving staircases and the ghosts. Draco is proud of the work the Memorial Trust has done over the years. It’s nice, he thinks, that Teddy will be able to start school here knowing his family's place in the history of Hogwarts. His parents’ legacy is properly honoured, left neither raw and unspoken, nor as mere stories in a textbook.
is, but it had an address on it so.” Malfoy gives a sigh and shrugs. “Nothing else has helped. I thought I’d try here.”
The master bedroom is spacious. A plain oak bed frame sits in the centre, and skylights in the roof overhead make Harry imagine lying here and being able to look up at the stars. While he’s watching, the room seems to give a pleased sort of hum and the paint on the walls turns a restful shade of soft grey.
“A winning team, apparently. Look—I’ve literally just come from an International Portkey. I’m tired. All I know is that she wants me to take a bunch of professional losers and teach them to play properly. She didn’t tell me you’d be in the mix.” He lets out a humourless chuckle. “But somehow that seems completely unsurprising.”
“Well, it’s a little convenient, isn’t it?” Ron’s tone sounds snide and disbelieving. “Your father has a go at you at dinner. You’re in his study later that night and really get into a barney with him, loud enough to be overheard even through the castle-level walls and doors in this place. And in the morning, he’s dead.”
It offends Hermione’s sense of fairness and her fundamental belief in redemption and second chances. He loves her very much for it, but it doesn’t change anything.
If there’s anywhere no one wants to see ten years after the scene of a battle, it’s the place where the wounded and dying were brought. Neville takes charge, using an industrial strength banishing spell he learned at the apothecary to vanish bed linen, bandages, and stains. Harry finds a broom in a closet and sweeps the dust by hand, more for something to do than anything else. Luna comes back from Pomfrey’s rooms with a pile of clean sheets and makes up a bed, before Neville carefully lowers Ron onto it.
“All I’m saying is that Teddy is cautious when it comes to new people in his life. You’d do well to have a little patience.”
He turns and descends quickly to the pitch, letting the pain scream in his leg in order to be gone as quickly as he can. He’s still fuming when Malfoy crashes into his office hot on his heels a few minutes later.
“And the campaign? I have to say Harry, I was so surprised when you announced. You’ve never seemed like the sort for politics to me.” Neville gives an awkward, apologetic sort of shrug and Harry’s stomach sinks a little. The words are there on the tip of his tongue.
Draco turns the tumbler around and around in his hand. “And I’m sorry. For so many things. I’m not sure what your friends have told you about what I’m doing here, but I would like the opportunity to make amends. If you’re willing.”
Teddy hovers about three feet off the ground and flies briskly away. Draco puts his sunglasses on against the glare of the day.
Harry sits at the weight machine trying the new exercises Luna’s given him for his leg. They hurt, but he leans into the pain, waving his wand to increase the amount of weight every second set. It doesn’t take long before he’s beyond fatigued, sweat running down his back and his hip throbbing. He stares at himself in the mirror, face flushed with exertion and his black hair matted to his head. He grabs a clean towel from the pile by the door and heads to the showers. Usually he’d go straight home, but the team’s long gone and he feels clammy and disgusting and just wants to get under some hot water as soon as possible.
“And there are Grindylows. Or at least there were, back then. Unfriendly little bastards. I couldn’t cast properly because I couldn’t speak, but
“You should…I mean,” Neville paused and coughed awkwardly. “There should be a way to contact you to ask for this kind of help. There’s been so much loss and destruction. People want their lives back.”
Malfoy glances at the calendar and back at Harry, and then to Harry’s enormous relief, nods with a long-suffering sigh.
On Sunday the hospital is inexplicably quiet. It’s not ordinarily quiet on the weekends, Harry’s been here often enough to know. There’s usually a press of amateur Quidditch injuries, home improvement accidents, and people for whom Saturday night took a turn. But this afternoon there’s an unexpected lull. Peaceful enough he can hear the repeating chime of heartbeat monitoring charms, a baby crying somewhere in the maternity ward.
Parkinson rearranges her shopping and makes to leave. “Do let us know how you get on with the mistletoe door,” she calls over her shoulder. “Enquiring minds, and all that.”
“No, but we could put everyone back in one place,” Draco says, and everyone turns to look at him. “Let’s throw another party. We’ll say, because you missed your last one and because Neville is now home. And we’ll hint at a “special announcement” so they’ll have to show up for fear that we’ve undone their work. And we’ll send the invitation to everyone who was invited to the last one.”
“If what Ronald is describing turns out to be true, then we’re facing a crime of unprecedented severity,” the Minister says gravely. “But I for one will be very glad to learn that you haven’t meant the things you’ve been saying lately.”
.” Lovegood looks sad as she writes yet more notes on his chart. “Harry’s no longer strong enough to keep breathing on his own.”
“Blue Snakeroot,” Draco says immediately, his professional demeanour partly returning. “In combination with the effects of the curse, and other more harmless ingredients, the effect was magnified. But that was the missing puzzle piece. It simply never occurred to me it could be involved because it’s so hard to get your hands on and so strictly controlled.”
Eventually there’s nothing further to do but wait. The others gather their things and head home through the Floo. Harry thanks Luna profusely for her help.
“Potter,” Zabini says, offering a wry grin and a hand to shake. “Good of you to finally get your head out of your arse.”
Malfoy arches an eyebrow at him. “My subscription must have gotten lost in the intercontinental mail.”
“Okay,” Harry murmurs, and Draco feels the word more than he hears it. He looks around the room, at the newly-stripped floors and the whitewashed walls and the brightly coloured rug. Thinks about Harry coming back here from the Farm each day,
They Apparate to the wizarding section of Hampstead Heath, which appears to Muggles like it’s a heavily wooded area near Kenwood House, but opens out onto a broad expanse of park protected by high charms, where there’s plenty of space for a couple of recreational Quidditch pitches and room for children to play and people to run their Crups.
It happens before he can really process it. Potter’s face turns thunderous and he produces a wand he absolutely didn’t have a second ago.
Draco had tried to make conversation after Robards stalked from the room like a man possessed, leaving Granger to pack away the paperwork.
“I don’t know what we’ll do without you,” he admits. “None of the others are quite ready to step up.”
“So nothing is to be gained,” Hermione leaps in, deciding she’s found an ally in Malfoy. “Ron wants to stay. There’s no reason to overrule him on that. And no reason not to carry on. We were fine getting him up here to the hospital wing, weren’t we?”
Draco levels a look at him as if he’s being a bit dense and waits for Harry to catch up. Harry’s not sure what he’s getting at, unless,
At the head of the table, the owner of Puddlemere United, Archie Allsop, scowls at them both. Harry can’t stand him. He remembers all too well the way his coach at the time had wanted to keep Harry on another season—to give him a chance to work on his rehab—but Allsop had called Harry an “expensive disappointment” and released his contract immediately.
Harry’s replayed the raid in his head almost constantly for days. He feels like the answer is just beyond the reach of the tips of his fingers.
“At Master Draco Malfoy, yes, and also Madame Narcissa,” Holber confides. “Always saying he will disown them. Always shouting about turning them out onto the street.”
“So this is a surprise, isn’t it?” Bill says, as he unwraps the string around Harry’s file and spreads some of the papers out across the desk. “There was so much confusion when these vaults were uncovered. You can imagine how annoyed the Powers That Be here were to discover that their records were incomplete. They think that whole section was blocked off when the Muggles started on their Jubilee Line extension.”
Harry feels a bit guilty. “Yes, there’s something wrong,” he concedes. “But I’m fixing it. Or Malfoy is….Or will be.”
And Harry told her that he really hadn’t known. Just like Ron, he’d had no bloody idea. The trap in Lucius’s study, Draco’s spell, all that had been a last ditch effort. “I just thought if we gave everyone the chance to cover their tracks that someone might take it. If I’d thought for a second…”
Again, Luna’s an absolute master of the understatement. The terms of Malfoy’s exile and subsequent community service are well known to everyone around this table.
They reach their rooms in the Staff Quarters and Harry unwards the door.  Draco hangs his cloak and takes off his shoes. They’ve been living here since Draco closed up his practice in Vienna last month. It’s been a quiet existence. Harry tires easily and sleeps a lot. They keep to themselves, decline interviews with the press, and take Teddy flying every other weekend. They go to the Burrow for lunch on Sundays, and it's still awkward — the people closest to Harry wrestling with their gratitude toward Draco and their feelings about his past — but he knows it's important to Harry.
He expects righteous indignation, a hex, or possibly a punch to the face. He doesn’t expect Malfoy to laugh and say, “I’ll see you ’round, Potter,” as he walks away.
“He was always pretty quick at school,” Ron is annoyingly swift to point out, ladling seconds of a particularly delicious creamy leek and potato soup into Harry’s bowl at dinner on Friday. “I mean he was a cheating bastard, but he was fast.”
Harry remembers the shock of it, like electricity shooting through his leg, but not much else. The Healers did a very good job of treating him, but as Harry knew only too well, Dark magic leaves its scars. Rehabilitation helped, but he’ll never have the balance he needs to fly properly again. All he has left is coaching others.
it would come back,” Malfoy cautions. “And there’s no reason to think the Astronomy Tower will be any more open than any other part of the castle.”
As if to confirm his worst suspicions, Dawlish more or less immediately calls by their office to check on him.
“I think that’s at the core of the Room of Requirement’s magic. The castle will always help if you ask,” Hermione goes on. “Part of the ritual we’re planning is
“My part.” Malfoy gets up and walks over to his own bed, his back to Harry, and doesn’t offer any further explanation.
“Is this about the team?” Draco asks, his jaw clenched and his tone defiant, his eyes fixed on Harry’s hand on his knee. “Do you want me to come back so they’ll win?”
Ginny lets out an audible shudder at that and puts her cutlery down. Apparently she’s suddenly lost her appetite.
“Next year, I’m taking Mother somewhere warm. We’ll do Christmas in the Maldives. Nothing but white sand and clear water and swimsuits with our Santa hats.”
“Hello, Harry,” she says, giving him a kiss on the cheek and pushing a box of chocolate santas toward him. “Have one!”
Blaise loses his internal struggle at that point, laughing so hard he almost falls off his chair. Even Pansy has managed to close her mouth and is eyeing Harry with a surprised and delighted smile.
Harry’s about to object, but there’s something in Malfoy’s expression that makes him pause. Malfoy extends his long legs out in front of him and looks up at the ceiling, staring at the spider-web Harry still hasn’t done anything about. The moment stretches between them, a fragile thing Harry finds himself equally unwilling to disturb.
“Yes, let’s zero in on the important thing: your appetite. Harry, the party’s breaking up in a few hours. We’re no closer to working out what happened, but they’re all planning their escape back to their ordinary lives.”
Belle’s windows still show the low red-painted stables, covered in snow, but today it’s as if there’s been a snowstorm in the charmed landscape, and the panes themselves are covered in icy snowflakes. It’s a beautiful piece of magic, Harry thinks. Much more detailed than he’s ever seen in windows at the Ministry. The light refracts through the icy patterns casting a dancing rainbow of light on the covers of Belle’s bed.
“No, no. Nothing like that,” Harry cuts him off. Malfoy settles back in his chair, relaxing a notch but still frowning in concern.
He needs a hot bath, desperately, and twelve hours of uninterrupted sleep. But even as shattered as he feels, as he rides back to the surface and emerges into the daylight, his brain is racing. The Potter rings are an entirely new mystery, and Draco has always loved a challenge.
Her mouth curls in just the faintest imitation of a smile and Harry feels as though a trap has snapped shut somewhere and he missed it.
Ron nods. The explanation makes sense, but Harry can’t help but feel like it’s only part of the story. Why would Malfoy have kept it from Ron, but told Parkinson and probably Zabini?
He feels like he needs to keep up his momentum, and he doesn’t have any wrapping paper, so he quickly scans the other doors for something he can do. The picture of the couple building the snowman seems straightforward enough, something he can surely manage before work.
“It’s okay,” Harry assures him. “It’s not like I have any leg to stand on, do I? I mean Draco and Parkinson are basically peas in a pod.”
“We may need to rearrange some things,” he suggests gently, pushing an armchair out of the way, and transfiguring the coffee table into a squat, sturdy-looking little step ladder.
“You’ve had too much to drink to Apparate. Why don’t you stay here?” The words are out before he thinks about them too carefully, and Harry’s sudden glance up at him makes it realises how it sounds. Harry looks surprised at the idea, but not shocked. “I don’t live here, but there’s a bedroom made up in case I want to stay. I didn’t have wine with dinner, so I’m fine to get home.”
Malfoy gives his outfit a critical look and seems about to say something, when he gets distracted by the floor behind him.
seat the WWN presenter next to the man he famously cheated on his wife with, and Draco realises they haven’t even talked about whether Harry will be there at the next dinner or not, because obviously he will. He’s been to the last three in a row and that makes Draco feel like something warm and bright is trying to burst out of him and spill all over the table.
Malfoy appears at a loss for words. He stares at Harry for a long moment. Harry feels self-conscious, as if he’s put too much of himself on display. Made himself too vulnerable to someone who, historically, would have only delighted in taking advantage of it. He feels his face heat, and snatches up his clothes, stuffing them back in the bag.
When Harry gets home that night it’s late and cold. Grimmauld Place feels damp and unwelcome, and he heads into the sitting room and casts at the fireplace to light it, opening his curry and a bottle of beer on the coffee table.
In the centre of the room is a low table, absolutely laden with food. Baskets of fresh fruit and bread that smells as if it’s been freshly baked. Harry’s stomach lets out an embarrassing growl but he can’t concentrate on it, pushing back the thick covers. He looks down at the comfortable red and gold pyjamas he’s wearing in confusion. His clothes — cleaner than he’s seen them in days — and his pack are sitting neatly on the chair beside his bed.
Harry lifts his wand and casts his shield, feeling rather than seeing Malfoy do the same. The refuse around them starts to lift as the ghosts burst through the wall screaming. Harry screws his eyes tightly shut, focussing on the spell. He hears Hermione begin to cast, hears the word
“It’s that or accept that your Christmas is probably going to be a disaster,” Alicia shrugs. Harry has a sudden, vivid image of Molly Weasley shivering at his table in the half-dark, exploded decorations draped over the wilted branches of a dying tree behind her.
“The thing about breaking curses, Auror Potter, is that it is often delicate work. You’d do well to perhaps not careen into people’s workspaces like the clodhopper you are, unless you’d like to add an ancient Roman fertility curse to your list of woes?”
he knows what you do, Malfoy. Harry Potter has known about every bloody thing you’ve ever done since the age of eleven.”
Harry approaches him tentatively, kneeling down in front of the stupid gilt chair and putting a tentative hand on Draco’s leg. Draco’s expression is so guarded it’s impossible to know what he’s thinking. Harry hates it. He wants to get back that open joy he’d seen on Draco’s face before he messed all this up.
Luna has obviously taught Malfoy the spell as they step into the room together, scarves around their own faces, and set several quills and other small objects to spinning. Harry feels like he shouldn’t take too deep a breath, but keeping Hermione restrained is harder than he anticipated, and his lungs are burning. He can feel the wind on his face, but in the darkened common room, it’s impossible to tell if it’s working.
Draco decides he’s suffered enough awkwardness for now and leaves them both at the foot of the stairs without saying anything.
Harry feels like he could level the exact same question at Ron in return, given Parkinson’s nonsense about being in Zabini’s room for
Malfoy kicks off his boots, sprawling out on a long blue sofa. In the flickering light from their torches, his expression is thoughtful. He’s grown into his ridiculous aristocratic features. The mean edges of him have softened somehow. Harry keeps thinking about his pale chest damp with bathwater, and the unrelenting irreconcilable urge he has to punch him in the face and kiss him at exactly the same time.
“It’s a simple enough question,” Malfoy goads, and there’s something of his sneering teenage self about it. Enough to break Harry out of his odd reverie.
“This is a bit exciting, isn’t it? I’ve never been to Prague,” she whispers, reaching for the stick beside him. Harry’s not sure that “exciting” is the word he’d use—”harebrained” feels more accurate—but then he feels the familiar and ugly hook behind his navel and doesn’t have time to answer.
“I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Harry says finally, reaching for the wine bottle and changing the subject.
“I think you’re actually cursed, Harry,” she says, as if that should be obvious, and goes back to eating her ham.
The only contact he’s had from Draco himself in the months since he left was an invoice sent from his accountant for his work on the rings. Harry, clearly suffering a rush of blood to the head, thought he’d be amusing and sent the payment back with a note saying “You forgot our first
“Let’s make sure,” Neville says, pushing at an overturned desk to clear a path back to the door. “We’ll search the rest of this floor, and then I vote we go back to the infirmary. Check on Ron, eat, and rest.”
“I mean, this is the end, right?” Neville asks, looking at the rest of them with a confused expression. “Ron’s terribly injured. It’s time to use the Portkey.”
Harry thinks he might be about to suffer the same fate, but the carol changes and Luna wanders off singing loudly.
Narcissa opens the door. If she’s surprised to see them together, she doesn’t let on, waving them in. Her private rooms are decorated with the same tasteful opulence as the rest of the Wing. Translucent drapes flutter in the breeze from the open windows and the furnishings are light: gold, pale blue, dusky pink. It's a stark contrast to the smokey darkness of Lucius’ study. Harry notices the DMLE seal shimmering over the fireplace.
“I was referring to matters larger than your stomach, Harry.” Draco rolls his eyes with a smile. “I’m afraid it’s much too early for food, but if you go down to the Blue Room, the elves will probably have coffee out. You could bring me one back.”
Still, if the bell tower is Kreacher’s only retribution for stealing the Christmas tree, Harry figures he hasn’t fared too badly. Until he goes to bed that night, and discovers the St Mungo’s tree sitting in pride of place against the wall of his room, affixed firmly to the floor with a sticking charm.
Which is how Harry finds himself gathered with his friends and Draco’s around two small round tables, packets of crisps open between them, a bottle of champagne chilling in an icebucket, and Draco’s leg pressed against his own. He’s not sure he’s ever been happier.
Harry shakes his head. “It must have been a one-off.” Neither of them are entirely happy with that explanation, or rather the lack of one, but Harry promises that if there’s any further security breaches he’ll get an Auror team to reset everything top to bottom.
He sends a Patronus to Hermione immediately and then thinks about the fastest way to get off the Hogwarts grounds. In the end he forces the lock on the Quidditch equipment shed, which is closest, and grabs a crappy, half-broken broom. It’s too small for him by half but gets him to the school gates far faster than walking. He briefly considers trying to Apparate straight to the Ministry, but it’s too far in one hop and he can’t be bothered trying to think of the waypoints so he goes straight the Broomsticks and into the Floo.
“You love Luna, and you’re not going to scuttle around helping her plant herbs and asking to borrow her castor oil any more. You’re a very nice man with a lot to offer, and if I wasn’t unreasonably besotted with this idiot next to me I’d have tried it on with you already.”
, with Casey. Two times if you counted that orderly the year before, which he doesn’t because they were interrupted by a medical emergency that resulted in the potions cupboard being flung wide open and Harry Apparating away with his trousers still open.
Harry’s speechless. The idea that Leila was able to fly like that with artificial limbs is more than he can get his head around.
Harry rushes to shower and dress, and it seems like minutes later the Floo is roaring again, filling the house with the sound of laughter and carols and his family.
The situation is more and more familiar: the glint of fury in Malfoy’s eye, Harry himself, poised somewhere between irritation and desire. They each know exactly which buttons to press, how to shrink the whole world down to nothing but the sound of their own, quickened breathing.
He pours the brandy and casts a little flame and the pudding catches fire with a whooshing sound and a pretty blue light that burns for a moment before extinguishing exactly as intended. The dessert is delicious, and Harry would happily just sit there for the afternoon, drinking mulled wine with one of Malfoy’s knees pressed against his under the table, but they have two more dragons to slay.
“At least we won’t need to buy groceries for a week,” Neville mutters. “We can just unshrink all this when we get home.”
Draco immediately gave the money to the Shout Out fund for the Pride float. He didn’t want to keep a single coin.
“Don’t let everyone know how good you are on a broom your first day,” Draco replies. “It pays to keep some things up your sleeve.”
“No, no,” Harry waves his hands in a conciliatory gesture. “I mean, you must be right. I guess it’s just coincidence after all.” He wipes his palms, suddenly sweaty, on his trouser legs and wishes he’d said nothing.
They slide down the hill twice more, toppling on the third attempt into a laughing heap in the snow. When they get back to Grimmauld Place, the twenty-first door is brightly lit.
It’s too hard for Harry to explain that the idea of actually actively choosing to have a pet had always felt like too much responsibility. And that Cassie had more or less adopted him, rather than the other way around. He hopes she’s doing okay.
Ginny bypasses Diagon altogether, rolling her eyes at Harry’s look of surprise. “Please. You want to be hounded by fans all morning? Because I don’t.” Ginny’s starting for the Harpies again this season and attracts almost as much attention as Harry.
Then the last words they exchanged the previous night come back to Harry, and he feels his face heat a little.
Draco tugs Harry towards him by his belt loops, as if to demonstrate. Harry’s suddenly in complete agreement.
He took the pendant, tracing its design with a fingertip, and felt its magic pulse gently, wounded, under his touch.
“Right, yes. I saw it this morning at breakfast. One of the elves has a really distinctive star-shaped rash on his hand. It’s the result of handling starfilger weed.”
“Stop talking,” she cuts him off. “I’m tired of this. Do you really think I had something to do with this, Draco? After everything we’ve been through.” She sounds hurt.
Working in the vault becomes second nature. He’s managed to get Lily’s ring up onto a small table now, illuminated under bright lights, and it makes the whole environment a little less unpleasant. His warming charms hold better during the day and he’s transfigured a slightly more comfortable chair.
Harry reaches out a hand and fingers the hem of Draco’s running shorts. “Or you could let me mess you up a little more.”
Malfoy is alone in his office when Harry gets there, and closes his eyes briefly, taking in a deep breath. “I thought I made myself clear.”
“Of course not,” he sighs. “We were just shagging, Pans. We’re not going to be owl pals.” He wishes it didn’t sound so bitter when he says it, like he’s some jilted teen.
“I’d share,” he says, with an unapologetic shrug, “but I seem to have finished this one. First one back to the picnic makes the martinis. Coming, Weasley?” He turns and strides off through the trees, humming a few bars that sound suspiciously to Harry like a refrain from
Spurred into action, Harry returns to Belle’s room, using a spell Hermione once taught him years ago to duplicate magic. Then he goes back to Malfoy’s office, vanishing the broken Venetian blind and sizing up the dull opaque glass behind it. He casts at the window. “
to get Harry to think about him again. Merlin only knows why. Harry wonders where Malfoy wound up. Probably swilling expensive wine in some chateau in Burgundy. Definitely not in a crowd of commuters heading into the Highbury & Islington tube station, in any event.
Cassie is the first one to move. She gathers all of her notes and tucks them carefully in a thick folder, then steps forward.
Harry looks at Malfoy, who is staring up out the kitchen windows, his face impassive. He seems uninterested by the whole conversation, which is somehow even more infuriating.
Behind him, the Floo roars again, and he turns to find Neville emerging, dusting snow off his shoulders.
Harry knew someone had to have overheard, but he wishes it hadn’t been Malfoy. He feels his face heat and picks at a loose thread on his blanket, refusing to look at him, not wanting to see his expression.
and her magizoologist friend Rolf, and how they plan their trips overseas together to coincide with Ginny’s Quidditch team’s touring schedule. “They’re playing an invitational against the Reykjavik Riptide next month and I cannot wait. Arctic foxes,” she says knowingly to Harry, and he nods as if he understands her meaning. He wants to ask her what it was like, in the beginning. For her and Ginny. How Molly reacted. If Percy was okay with it. But they’re all questions that fizz and dance under the surface of his skin and he’s not really ready to let them out yet.
, but there’s a vicious sizzling sound and an enormous cloud of steam fills the hallway, sending him into a coughing fit.
Malfoy’s mouth opens and then closes again, as if even he’s not sure what to say to that. Curse Breaker Sato spends a few minutes setting up a double layer of protection wards around the door, and then she and Malfoy move within the safety bubble to open the door.
Draco runs through a litany of possible excuses in his mind but takes too long, and Pansy’s expression starts to turn smug, so he does the only thing he can think of and agrees to the date.
New York that first summer was overwhelming in the best way possible. Loud and crowded, filled to bursting with people who had no idea who he was and didn’t care. In those pre-recession years it was a city focussed entirely on making things bigger and better and shinier and new, even in the wizarding sections, where he spent as little time as possible.
” Luna warbles, levitating potion bottles out of a carton and into neat rows on a shelf inside the open cupboard. Today her green robes have tiny wrapped presents dangling off them, a sleigh circling her hem like a toy train.
“All right, Potter,” she says after a long pause. “I’ve got a full day of firing people ahead. You can stick around and hand out tissues, or you can leave me to it. Either way, you’re coming with me to a meeting of the League owners tomorrow at four.”
Teddy’s too young to realise the subject might be delicate, rambling on and on about whatever nonsense Harry has fed him lately, turning up at Draco’s sporting a head of messy black hair. Ron seems awkward and uncomfortable whenever he’s recently caught up with Harry for a beer. Hermione just gives Draco these terrible sympathetic looks that make him immediately want to get up and leave whatever room he’s in at the time.
He thinks again about mentioning Parkinson, but decides that will only make things worse in the current circumstances.
He lets Wood launch into a history of underdog victories in the League from the year 1927 on, until the match steward comes to tell them it’s time.
“You’ve never forgiven her. You don’t believe people can change.” And now it feels like they’re talking about something other than whether or not Pansy Parkinson is a liar. Harry glances down at the tightly fastened cuffs of Draco’s shirt sleeves and tries not to think about what they hide.
“This is fantastic,” Harry enthuses, clapping his icy hands together to warm them up. “What’s next?”
“Well, if Harry’s going, I don’t see why I need to sit here and read a sodding book,” Ron declares, stabbing at the bacon on his plate. Harry wonders how he missed all the good breakfast food.
Draco looks shell-shocked. Harry feels more like he’s been expecting this disappointment—or something like it—all along.
Hermione shows him a series of little checkmarks inside the cover of her notebook. “This is my best guess,” she says. “We were aiming to conduct the ritual on the night of the Solstice because it would amplify its power. We won’t know for sure if it’s the right day, but it will be close enough to have some effect.”
Harry figures he’ll grab a couple of sandwiches and take them with him. It seems rude to turn up empty-handed a second time. If Hermione doesn’t want one now, she can keep it for a snack.
They play for over an hour, Draco letting out a stream of colourful epithets about the state of his now-useless broom. Harry feels the thrill of competition flow through him, causing his toes to curl and his breath to catch. They’re both laughing and shouting at each other, chasing each other from one end of the pitch to the other. Harry catches the first point, Draco the second.
“So you’re just going to play dumb, is that it? Pretend you haven’t been creeping around and messing with me. This is about the election, isn’t it? You’re opposed to my politics so you thought you’d stalk me and harrass me!”
“Come on then,” Robards enthuses, looping an arm around each of them and steering them back into the noisy crowd. He deposits them near the bar and surges off to join the carolling mediwizards.
Instead, Malfoy drew the olive from his martini slowly into his mouth from the pick and eyed Harry up and down in an appraising way.
Ron makes them both sandwiches with thick slices of homemade bread and an onion chutney Harry would happily eat straight from the jar, while Harry gets him up to speed.
“Uh, thank you,” Harry says, and tries not to make it sound like a sigh. He puts the book on the chair beside him and wonders if he can just “forget” it and leave it there when he goes home.
“Muggles used to think mistletoe would protect them from witches,” Malfoy says quietly, staring up at it.
“We had a breakthrough, in the case,” he announces without waiting for Draco to look up. “It might mean we can find Marsden, and then maybe we’ll have more information. For Belle.”
When Harry arrives, the house is already overflowing. Victoire and Rose are chasing each other up the stairs in peals of laughter, and George and Percy seem to be having one of those extremely loud discussions that is one well-timed insult away from an actual fight.
“Look, Harry. Even she can see how wrong she was now.” She gestures over at the sofa, where Hermione is listening to Draco, bright-eyed and attentive, nodding enthusiastically at whatever he’s saying and pointing at something in Rowena’s diary. “Luna’s right, it’s going to work. Those two can do anything they put their minds to.”
“Thank you for your time,” Ron says, clearly annoyed now that he feels like he’s on the outside of some reference he doesn’t understand. “We’ll come and get you if we need anything further.”
“Besides,” he says, as he gathers their things, folding up the picnic blanket he’d been sitting on. “You’ve got the new copy of
“I think you’ve forgotten who I am, Harry,” he says sadly. “I keep rolling up my sleeves to show you, but it’s like you think it doesn’t matter.”
“Would have been good if the Boy Wonder felt the same.” The words were out before he’d been able to stop them. It was impossible to avoid falling back into the ugly rhythm of snapping at each other as children. He’d been very carefully and actively not thinking about Harry Potter for years, but seeing her had made all the old emotions surface at once.
“I’ll arrange to have him taken home this evening. Luna is the Healer looking after his day-to-day care. You can join us there tomorrow. Number twelve.”
It’s a pretty lush looking potluck, Harry thinks, taking in the turkey still snug in its foil Waitrose tray, plastic containers filled with potatoes and stuffing, and a Christmas cake with lopsided iced handwriting spelling
Hermione nudges Ron’s arm with her elbow, and his head snaps to glare at her, but she’s still looking at Harry.
“I was at Malfoy Manor yesterday,” Harry says quietly, as he spells water into the sink and sets the bowls and mixing spoons to wash themselves.
dining room might not have Voldemort or a giant snake, but the house is starting to feel like just as much of a prison as the last time Harry was here.
Malfoy levels Harry with a look that would reduce lesser men to dust, but Harry’s already convinced him to swing him around on ice skates. Anything is possible.
The second part of the ritual begins and the four of them now have to bring their spells into alignment. Draco’s magic knits neatly together with his own, closing the circle far more cleanly than Theo’s ever did during their rehearsals. Harry has to force himself to focus so that he doesn’t get distracted by the intimate clasp of it, as all-encompassing as the feeling of Draco’s arms around him the night before.
The crowd dwindles, and Teddy seems pleased by the unexpected playdate with Rose, so before Draco can think too much further about it, it’s just him and Harry. The silence in the staff room seems oppressive.
for him. A quiet life with a doddery old house-elf who makes his breakfast, and a team of players who love the game almost as much as he does, and a Kneazle that curls against his damaged leg at the foot of his bed at night. He doesn’t
“Brought the potions ingredients down for this month’s delivery. The Hogwarts house-elves usually take care of it all, but they’re run off their feet in the lead-up to Christmas. Plus, the hospital is always a bit depressing this time of year so I like to bring some decorations down.”
It’s a short distance, a few hundred feet at most, but the silence is eerie and feels thick in his ears. The weeds give way to slick, sharp-looking rock as they approach the boathouse. Harry thinks back to his first time here, the way the little boats had carried them across the water. How anxious and excited he’d been, staring up at the castle rising above him like something out of a dream. Now he just feels uneasy.
Harry ignores the warning skulls and pushes open the gate, stepping further along the path inside the brick walls. As soon as he’s past the gate, the air changes: it’s much warmer in here and thick with humidity. Harry looks up, expecting perhaps a greenhouse ceiling, but it’s open to the air, so it must be enchanted. A similar spell to the ones Neville uses over some of the herbology plots at Hogwarts.
Harry frowns, irritated that he didn’t know this, He’s sure Hermione doesn’t either or she would have mentioned it when she went to Malfoy Manor this week. Hermione is thorough that way.
"He did,” Draco confirms. “Several times. Told you he was a rubbish flyer." Harry elbows him in the ribs.
“Harry, why are only some of the doors on your calendar working?” Rose asks, as she clambers up the steps, dragging a long tail of tinsel behind her.
“Should we open a file?” Harry muses, when Ron suggests they go to the Mailboxes, Etc branch in Islington the following morning.
No sooner has Harry opened his mouth to say something complementary about the decor than a terrible creak and a slithering sound starts behind him. Masterson’s face drops into a picture of horror and Harry spins around in time to see the artfully arranged pyramid of decorative gifts tumbling from the sleigh toward the ground like a waterfall. He rushes forward, wand out, in the hopes of stopping the disaster somehow but it’s far too late. The sleigh is empty and a couple of tiny parcels from the very top of the stack bounce off his wand arm before joining their compatriots on the ground.
“Just think. Two more days and we’ll be on our way.” He means it to sound cheering, but Hermione just frowns further and writes faster.
“Um…” He casts his mind back, to the time before his life was a seemingly never-ending diet of shaking hands and giving speeches.
“Oh, yeah. Remember that year George thought he could just transfigure things into extra glasses and Audrey wound up holding a sock with red wine dripping all down her dress?”
). A teenager wearing a Metallica t-shirt. There’s even a neon sign outside Fortescue’s. None of it is what Harry expected. He’ll have to ask Andromeda more about it next time he calls.
“This is bloody delicious, mate,” he says, shoving lasagne into his mouth. Harry laughs. The meal is simple compared to last night. He thinks about the reversed Baked Alaska, cold on the outside and hot in the middle. About sitting in Draco’s study afterwards over whiskey discussing the techniques the chef had used. The animated way he’d gestured as he talked about
Thomas makes shakshuka and Nigel mixes a jug of white sangria that Thomas calls a “foul culinary mismatch” even as he pours himself a large glass. Harry realises how much he’s missed them both, his first friends in New York—his father figures, really. He talks about the job opportunity, and about his friends, and about how wrong he was about everything. He tells them all about Draco.
“Just decorations on trees?” she asks. Alicia had absolutely thrown herself into her studies after the war, determined to put everything she’d learned in Dumbledore’s Army to good use. She was the youngest appointment to the Defence against the Dark Arts post in a hundred years, and thanks to Voldemort’s curse on the position finally being broken, one of its most long-standing.
Hermione’s really gearing up, now. If Harry squints he can almost see the steam coming out of her ears.
Bill’s office is much more spacious than Gasnard’s, filled with a lot less paper and a lot more personality. Harry’s heart clenches when he sees the big black-and-white photo of the entire Weasley clan waving at him from the wall.
“I don’t know how you can eat at all,” Neville says. “Just the idea of a dead body lying a few rooms away was enough to ruin my appetite.” Hermione eyes the triangle of toast again and tosses it on her plate with a sigh.
“I...I wanted to find out how Belle is doing,” he manages, wishing his voice didn’t sound quite so squeaky.
“You don’t need to come. You can follow me later if you want.” She grasps his hand quickly and gives it a squeeze. “When you’re ready.”
“No. Well, yes. But not because she’s an heiress. She’s founded a Muggle startup, working with virtual reality. She has really interesting plans for wizarding entertainment.”
Draco Malfoy is a compelling sight up close, even making an exaggerated show of dusting off his expensive-looking coat as he stands, straightening his hair. Harry is suddenly acutely aware of the sweat plastering his own hair to his forehead, and he takes an abrupt step backwards, hoping wildly that it’s too cold out for him to reek too badly.
that,” she insists. “He comes to the Burrow for Sunday lunch. Or I mean, he did, when he and Ginny were still together. He thinks it’s a bit awkward for now.”
Draco puts his palm gently against Harry’s cheek. Harry very much wants to kiss him, but there’s a room full of people behind him who are probably staring, and mostly he just wants to know that Draco’s okay.
Draco chuckles. If only a fraction of what the tabloids have intimated about Potter’s childhood over the years is true, then he’s not wrong.
“Yes. A No-Maj Integration School on Long Island. It’s to help Muggle-born kids before they reach middle school—Hogwarts age. We work on their accidental magic. A bit of history. That sort of thing.”
in his home. Godric’s sake, how could you bear to set foot in his house, let alone sit down for dinner with him?”
Harry’s tired, but Draco’s a bright light in the dark stadium and he honestly can’t say no. They chase each other around for another ten minutes, the Snitch always tantalisingly out of reach. Harry’s arms and legs ache, and as he tries to put on one last burst of speed he finds himself slipping. He’s scrabbling for his wand to try and cushion himself when out of nowhere, Draco is there, strong arms around him, taking most of his weight.
“Ron, mate,” Harry tries again, “you’ve got to. Nothing is more important than you recovering properly.”
Balham gives an embarrassed shrug. “It’s out of my hands, Harry. They’re not telling me anything anymore.”
“This was supposed to build the team up,” Harry hisses at Malfoy, who is leaning nonchalantly against a hoop, face half-buried against the cold in a thick green roll-neck sweater. He watches the Arrows circle each other in confusion, helpless as Leila tosses the Quaffle cleanly through the unguarded hoop to score. “It wasn’t supposed to
“Starfilger is a Class Four restricted ingredient. It’s poisonous as fuck, and it’s illegal to grow. God knows what else is in here. I can see henbane, opium, hemlock, just for starters.”
No help at all, then. He holds the plate out to the owl, who flaps menacingly at him, shaking off a light dusting of snow before flying away.
Harry drags his feet a little as he heads back to his own office, disappointed in a whole range of ways. Not only does he not have a curse to blame, but also, apparently, he’s so capable of putting his foot in his mouth that he’s ruined whatever little moment he might have had with Malfoy.
Malfoy waves his wand. Dozens and dozens of tiny orbs, no larger than snitches, start to fly out of the chest and up into the sky. They swoop and arrange themselves, following the direction of Malfoy’s spell in regimented little lines, settling themselves on the eaves and windowsills of the house. Harry watches in awe as Malfoy’s spell sends a fresh wave up to the roofline, and another batch to rest in the branches of his front hedge. And then with a final flourish, Malfoy mutters one last incantation, and every single one of the orbs blinks into life, glowing like fireflies.
The gold-edged invite sits propped on the mantel, oddly bright in the dim light of the sitting room, and it catches Harry’s eye every time he walks past. It means he has to keep
Hermione makes a half-hearted attempt at interesting the children in the zoo animals but is immediately drowned out with a chorus of “Rides! Rides! Rides!” And so that’s what they spend the rest of the day doing. Harry has as much enthusiasm as all of the children put together, so Draco and Hermione largely leave him to it, sitting together at benches and picnic tables around the park while Harry queues and screams and then queues again.
He knows this, of course. They’d gone over it in Vienna. But he can see it’s helping Granger to start at the beginning. He pulls a blank piece of parchment towards him and takes a pen from his pocket, beginning to scratch out some notes. She paces in front of the whiteboard.
“Well, it’s just that you only…” Harry’s not really sure what Malfoy had done. His Acceptable in curse breaking extended to only the most basic knowledge of curse diagnostics, but surely you had to do a bit more than a single spell to be certain.
. So much so, Harry had missed his Portkey home with the team and spent a long, extremely hot weekend in Sofia, learning things about himself that he’s never been able to forget.
Ron thanks Neville for his help. Harry says he’ll come with him and leaves Ron and Cassie to wrap up their day together.
“Merlin, all right”, she rolls her eyes, “I’ll transfigure a perfectly good bra and pants into a bikini if it makes you feel like there’s a difference”.
“I think, perhaps, we have this under control now,” Obliviator McMichael says, appearing immediately at Harry’s elbow. “I…uh, thank you for your assistance, Auror Potter. But we could do with creating fewer problems we need to clean up.”
know where he got the poison. He stole the boxes containing Blue Snakeroot from a medical courier company. They didn’t report the theft for fear of the repercussions for their licence and their business.”
There’s a new café on the corner that has long family-style tables with piles of magazines on them and big vases stuffed full of flowers. He pushes the glass door to enter, and it swings away from him softly under a wave of magic. He’s reminded again of how little time he spends in the wizarding quarter in New York, unused to being surrounded by the pulse and energy of magic all the time.
“That’s horrifying, if it’s true,” Harry says, closing another text that has been less than useless. Research has never been his forté. He wishes Hermione had stayed to help.
“Do you know what happened?” Hermione asks. She seems tired and subdued. Harry supposes none of them really knows how to react.
“Well, now we really are nowhere,” Ron says glumly, but Draco seems energised by the outcome, scribbling quickly on his parchment.
Draco opens his mouth and then closes it again. A lecture on magical theory is probably not going to help matters right now.
Draco knows how Potter and his friends escaped the Manor. He’s pretty sure he knows what happened next.
Draco’s so close, is the thing. And the position is suddenly not remotely therapeutic, it’s unbearably intimate. All Harry can think about is the tired ache in his limbs, and all of the blood in his head rushing south, and the way Draco’s bright blond hair is a couple of shades darker when it’s damp with sweat. And Harry’s suddenly mortified, because if Draco pushes into the stretch even a few centimetres more he’s going to know
“Could you tell me who the Auror in Charge is on a file he opened a couple of days ago regarding me.”
Harry will never feel an ounce of sympathy for Lucius Malfoy, but his heart tugs a little when he thinks about Narcissa. And the idea that Malfoy thinks a third party is involved makes him uncomfortable. Why hasn’t he said anything? There are things the Aurors could do, ways to determine if Dark Magic is involved—
Draco stares at him for a long moment and says nothing. Harry’s heart races. Maybe he needs more. Maybe Harry has to lay more of his heart bare and convince him. Draco looks away, glancing around the sitting room.
Jack shrugs, but doesn’t stop smiling, and turns back toward the truck, sliding one end of a thick wooden beam towards him and indicating for Harry to grab the other end. The wood is old and heavy. It has a history to it and feels warm under Harry’s fingertips.
Harry nods. At least the young woman will be getting the best care. Hard enough to learn that your fiancé was a dangerous sociopath bent on poisoning wizarding Britain’s supply of Pepper-Up just in time for the Christmas holidays. Maybe she’s better off asleep for a while.
coverage was a bit alarmist this morning, wasn’t it?” Ron tries again, swallowing quickly as his mother comes into the room, fixing him with a warning stare as she wields a gravy boat in each hand.
Harry hadn’t planned on it, but he needs to get Malfoy on his own, and pinning him to a tree in the woods seems much more likely than getting him by himself in this overcrowded house.
come with me, stand there with us all, and smile,” Harry says, reaching down to take Draco’s hand. “It will be terrible and we’ll both hate it. But this is how it changes.”
In the end he keeps it short and says he’s doing some work on the house that he’d love them to see, and would they consider coming over for dinner on Saturday.
But instead, the wizard draws out a piece of parchment, and locates a quill and begins to scratch out Harry’s name with agonising slowness.
“You’re a shambles. Wandering around here dressed like a rag bag,” Draco gives a wave of his hand to indicate his outfit, which would rankle, but Harry’s pretty sure he has pine needles and glitter stuck to places he can’t even see. “Wheedling your way in where you’re not supposed to be. With your Christmas decorations and your gingerbread biscuits and your …” he trails off, seeming exasperated, though it’s hard to tell if it’s with Harry or himself.
“No, I mean it. What we had was brilliant, but I’m just not wired that way. I can’t have you swanning in and out of my life the way you swan back and forth across the Atlantic. I need someone who has put down roots somewhere. Someone who knows where they belong. Who owns a pair of sodding
So his techniques are more refined now. He has centring rituals and focussing spells. He no longer lumbers into someone’s mind like an unwelcome intruder, but slips in stealthily and without disruption. He’s able to take stock of what his patient is seeing and experiencing before deciding how to proceed. And yet even with all his years of experience, it’s still a shock to see Potter — as young as he was when Draco first met him — sitting under a tree.
Harry fidgets, waiting impatiently in the endless silence broken only by the ticking of the huge antique clock on the wall and the scratching of Gasnard’s quill.
The name rings foreign in Harry’s ears and it takes him a minute. A rogue part of Harry’s brain will always think of Crabbe and Goyle as witless and cruel, mindlessly doing the bidding of the person now sitting in front of him. But all he can really think about is the heat and the smell of sulphur and that paralysing fear.
“Fancy,” Elsa says, admiring the sleek new model. “I thought British wizards didn’t know about phones or computers or
On Saturday, he takes his notebook to the Manor and has breakfast with his mother before disappearing into the Library for the day. His mother has said several times that he’s welcome to move any of the books he needs to his own flat, but the Library is one of the few spaces in his family home where he still feels comfortable, and it gives him a reason to see her regularly. Plus—and this reason he keeps to himself—sitting at his father’s ornate hand-carved desk, surrounded by the smell of leather and parchment, Draco can almost imagine a life in which Lucius Malfoy hadn’t made such appalling decisions. A life in which Draco still had his father around.
The cold water is a blissful relief, even as dark and impenetrable as it is. He blinks a few times, flapping his newly-flippered feet and adjusting to the buoyancy. He waits for the others, keenly aware that with such limited visibility, it would be easy to get lost, even with the rope between them. The gloomy light and forests of tangled black weed are uneasily familiar. He hates being back here again.
It’s a lifestyle piece about three single mothers who moved in together. The witches decided to share child-rearing responsibilities and were financially supporting one another, and the whole thing was entirely practical but just salacious enough for Skeeter to find it interesting.
“I’ve been thinking about this,” Malfoy says, leaning in conspiratorially. “It will be a lot easier with children. Then we won’t sound quite as off-key.”
“And having done your best to undermine my professional reputation, I’m to understand that now you’d like me to come to your house, so that I can look for a cursed object like some glorified, magical equivalent of an airport baggage scanner.”
Harry frowns. “Pass me the parchment, Draco.” Draco pushes it across the table and Harry takes it and starts to read it over slowly, getting up to pace slowly back and forth as he does so.
“So, uh…You can sit in the Owner’s Box, but Pansy Parkinson is in there, and Merlin knows who else.”
Draco steps into the fireplace without thinking about it. Blaise makes him a strong espresso, and they sit at his kitchen island, Draco drumming his fingers nervously on the gleaming black marble.
It startles a laugh out of Harry, and Malfoy gives him a pleased smile. His ears pink up a little and Harry finds himself fixated on the smooth skin over his clavicle. Harry straightens up. Clearly, the pints are going to his head and he should leave. Flirting with Draco Malfoy is an objectively terrible idea. Draco’s tall and lithe and gives the impression of being all coiled power. Like a snake, but probably twice as dangerous. Harry can easily find far less menacing opportunities to pull, with a lot less emotional baggage.
“You could have splinched me,” Harry complains much later, lying warm and content against Draco’s chest, tracing idle patterns over a tattooed vine.
“A wooden one, with little doors. There’s pictures behind each door, of the things you’re supposed to do. To celebrate Christmas, I guess. Baking, decorating the tree, that sort of thing.”
“Now that Lucius is dead,” Harry ventures carefully, “the house and so on pass to him, anyway. Even though you aren’t married.”
lovely, but you need to put poor Neville out of his misery and tell him you have feelings for him too.”
He can picture Ron clearly though, slumped on one of the chairs. Talking. To Harry, or maybe just to himself. “I had no idea. I knew she wasn’t as happy as she could have been, but I had no bloody idea.”
“What, we only do this when it suits you?” Malfoy is smirking now; taunting Harry is giving him energy. “You only want to fuck when
“Well, a Muggle wouldn’t know that unless they knew you, Harry. Do you think this is connected to the Dursleys somehow?”
like you think it is appropriate to speak back to me in my own home. I’ve given my life in service of upholding the purest traditions of our history. And what have you done, exactly? Catch a sword when it flew your way?!”
Malfoy’s gaze narrows. “The day of the Battle? Or before that?” His tone is arch, as if he’s spoiling for a fight.
Harry feels his eyes well. His chest is tight to bursting with pride, watching the team circle in to shake the hands of their opponents. Draco pulls him in close, pressing a kiss to his temple.
“I think you need to give me a bit of background, Harry.” Neville says, sinking into a chair with a sigh. “Why would I be surprised to see you, Draco? You’re usually around—at the pub for lunch on Sundays or having coffee with Harry in that little cafe near work.”
“I’ve taken six months’ leave from the Wizengamot. But policy waits for no one, so I try to keep on top of things even when I’m not technically working. Do you want tea?”
“And even if it’s Gallagher’s, it doesn’t mean they made it into the grounds,” Harry notes. “They could just have easily been drinking here while they cooked up their story.”
Malfoy’s voice cracks a little on the last word, the first real sign of emotion he’s shown since he started talking.
The only person who seems to be having as little fun as Harry is Ginny. She sits back from the group, picking listlessly at a sandwich. Harry sinks to the rug beside her.
The group gathers their things, deciding to pack light and leave their extra food and supplies in the hospital wing with Ron. No one has anything much to say as they retrace their steps through the third floor. Harry feels on edge the whole time, worrying that the ghosts will be back or that new ghosts might appear. He imagines the others are probably feeling the same way. He keeps bracing himself for that eerie drop in temperature but nothing happens.
“He needs to take on less fieldwork,” she shrugs. ”Particularly now, with Hugo. But he’s on track for promotion to Deputy Head this year, so it’s all a balancing act.”
If the extremely intense way Draco kisses him straight into one last Apparition is anything to go by, he very much agrees.
“What are you on about?” Harry asks tiredly, looking around the apartment. It looks the same as ever. Cramped. Desperately in need of repainting. Too fucking hot now the full weight of the New York summer is upon them.
He figures the best way to delay the inevitable bollocking that Hermione has in store for him is to not be where she expects. It won't work for long, and it's certainly never stopped him receiving an incensed dressing-down from an otter Patronus before, but he'll take it. So, on Thursday he Apparates to Andromeda’s house. He’s thinking he might be able to ask her about Narcissa, but he’s surprised to find Teddy answering the door.
Draco looks down at his lean chest, the sheet tangled around his legs, the stag tattoo prancing around on his arm. His heart clenches. He can’t let himself get used to this.
Thank you so much for coming with me on this journey over the last twenty five days. It's been such a delight to get your comments on the way through cheering me on to the end. Thank you also to the organisers, particularly @sassy-cissa who kept this going even when she's been so sick over the last few days.
taken over, I suppose. They’re appointing a new CEO to run things around here. You’ll meet them on Monday.”
He dresses quickly and sends a Patronus to Ron telling him he’s going to be a little late and not to worry. If he tells Ron that Malfoy’s here he’ll be over in a heartbeat with Dawlish and Merlin-knows-who-else hot on his heels. And Harry just needs a little time before that happens. Time to work out what’s going on.
I assume she cast it while she was drinking with Zabini so that his cackles didn’t wake up the entire West Wing.”
“It was in my desk drawer. Do you think someone is pranking me? How would it even have gotten in here.”
. Harry turns the card over in his hand, as if there might be more of an explanation on the back. He hasn’t seen Luna in a couple of months either, which isn’t all that surprising. She’s a great one for dropping off the radar and turning back up with tales of spice markets in Turkey or healing rituals she’s learned from ancient Chinese wizards. What
She happily chats for a while about how well Hugo is doing in daycare before she bluntly swings the conversation around to Harry.
Harry introduces Neville to Elsa, who gives him a broad smile and says, “Ah! The war hero!” which causes Neville to flush and look embarrassed. Harry realised when he was back in Britain that Neville still feels somehow that he’s an impostor who’s assumed Harry’s role in the wizarding world, and he doesn’t seem to be dissuaded no matter how often Harry assures him that’s ridiculous.
Someone, Hermione probably, must have told Potter the girls were a couple, but not that they were married. When Potter catches sight of their matching rings, he seems delighted and demands all the details.
Harry very much wants to kiss him. He finds himself staring at Malfoy's mouth and almost starts to lean in a little, but Malfoy’s expression clouds and he steps away.
After the war, Harry offered Grimmauld Place to Andromeda for her and Teddy to live in, but she’d declined, saying the old house held no warm memories for her and that she’d rather stay in the home she and her late husband had built together. Teddy goes to a local Muggle primary, and this year he won a poster competition that meant he was invited to be a guest of honour at the local council’s annual tree-lighting ceremony. He’s been telling Harry for weeks that means that
Harry would almost be able to enjoy the looks of horrified shock on the owners’ faces, but he suspects his own expression mirrors theirs.
. You’re the one always telling us this whole stupid plan could be dangerous, and now you want to bring
Their friends have all tumbled away and the green flames are empty, leaving them alone. He reaches for the Floo powder and says his address.
disapproving look when he conceded he hadn’t read it in advance, and said his hands were tied. “It’s not as bad as it could have been,” she said, with a scowl. “If you broke it, you’d only have to live as an outcast for a year.” Harry tuned out her explanation of the finer points of wizarding contracts—
Hannah’s working quickly and already has Ron encased in a full-body stasis charm, his skin an eerie green as a result.
The Ravenclaw common room is just as much of a sanctuary as Harry recalls, the wide circular space somehow undiminished by the absence of windows, although Luna chokes up a little at the lack of the view.
Harry concentrates quite hard on not picturing that in his mind. He decides he’s probably better off not asking any more questions, sarcastically or otherwise.
“And where is your young man?” Molly has a twinkle in her eye that looks positively mischievous. Harry feels his face heat.
disagreements, from the moment the Northey family had owled to say a Death Eater was hiding in their basement and trying to contact Harry Potter. The Northeys were terrified. Middle-class pure-bloods who didn’t consider themselves
These letters are difficult to write, and afterwards he feels washed out. Overcome by ugly memories. He goes to find Jack and asks for a mindless task, spending the rest of the weekend stripping purple seventies wallpaper off the bedrooms in the guesthouse. Hot, sticky, and gratefully distracted.
Nigel and his partner, Thomas, had an apartment in a gorgeous brownstone on a street lined with trees, and their friends were magical and Muggle alike. The British obsession with the Statute of Secrecy had melted away in Manhattan. Wizards were careful, but they hadn’t taken themselves completely out of the world like some sort of misplaced aristocratic elite. It was exactly what Harry needed.
Luna doesn’t seem offended. “I know what you’re saying, Harry. I know what Ron and his partner think. But if Draco thought the easiest path to protecting his mother was killing his father, he would have done that years ago. Living with Lucius has been so very, very hard. Draco found another way because he’s a good person. And because he loves his mother. And he knows his mother still loves — or,” she corrects herself, “I suppose now,
The walls are covered with framed portraits of old wizards who always look a little askance at Harry, as if they wished he of all people hadn’t been the one to save the wizarding world. He can’t possibly imagine what they think of Pansy Parkinson striding through their hallowed halls, but he’s enjoying their pearl-clutching looks of disdain being aimed at someone other than him for a change.
“I don’t think I’ll change mine,” Luna says, looking down at her own lacy pink bra and voluminous bow-covered bloomers. She looks like a vintage pin-up. Harry suspects the outfit will not fare well in the lake water and says as much.
“I’ve made it clear time and again my position on this,” Harry yells. “And you make out to my face that you’re taking it seriously and behind my back you’re doing something completely different. You used an illegal spell.”
“What are you doing here?” He doesn’t mean it to sound like an accusation, but he also doesn’t know how to deal with Potter in a threadbare t-shirt and frayed jeans holding a block sander.
“Well, the second time you said you were meeting Pans when I know she’s currently in Paris, I started to wonder what was going on. The third time you did it, I thought I’d see what you were up to. I have to say, I’m disappointed. I was hoping for an illicit affair. This is much too wholesome.”
They trade good-natured insults about the respective teams as the game gets underway, and Draco tries to think of the best approach to take. He turns slightly, so he can watch Potter more closely. He’s about to mock Potter’s wide-eyed hungry stare and suggest that he waits until he and Chang are somewhere more private for that sort of behaviour, when he realises Chang is hovering high off to the right and that’s not who Potter is looking at at all.
“There, Mr Harry Potter, sir,” Banny says, and before Harry can ask anything further, he has scuttled away, back toward the house.
Harry finds his weaselly, defensive stance endlessly irritating. But every time he complains about it to Hermione she tells him off.
Harry feels immediately torn. On the one hand, he wants to see Draco Malfoy like he wants a splinching, but on the other he really needs to know Belle’s going to be okay.
Harry goes to draw his hand back, but Draco takes it and holds it, looking him in the eyes. His expression is sincere and open.
“It isn’t for me to tell you, but I assume you’re asking because you need to know,” she says finally after a long pause. “Yes, he is.”
Neville manages a rock-cutting spell he used renovating the garden at Grimmauld Place a few years back, and cuts some footholds into the wall. But no sooner than he manages to haul himself up out of the water, the rock crumbles away, dumping him unceremoniously back with a splash.
None of the players say anything, stripping out of their leathers and stowing their equipment in their travel bags.
Luna is wearing a short strand of tiny Christmas lights as a necklace and has holly leaves and berries poking out of her hair where it’s fastened up in a bun. She adds another couple of files to Magda’s stack, oblivious to the venomous glare fired in her direction.
“It’s an eggplant. Aubergine. Whatever.” He’s still tripping over the words he’s supposed to use here, which he hasn’t done since he first moved to New York.
“Terribly old-fashioned,” Luna says with a smile. “I never had any trouble visiting my girlfriends.”
Another hour and they’re ready to start practicing, pushing back the furniture to create space and drilling each other over and over again. By the time dinner rolls around, they each have the changes to their spells mastered and they’re all exhausted.
It’s the second time in a day that someone’s used the “L” word with Harry and he chokes on it a little.
Finally able to be touched, they sit quietly in Draco’s palm. They’re at peace for the first time since he encountered them. The magic thrums, unanswered and unresolved, but no longer
“Zabini, Parkinson.” Harry deposits another round of drinks in front of each of them. Blaise looks like someone has told him a particularly ridiculous joke and he’s trying not to laugh. Pansy is just gobsmacked, staring at him like he’s grown an extra head.
“Pack for a week,” Malfoy says abruptly, making no reference to the blow-out with Wood just the day before and certainly offering no words of reassurance or encouragement. “We’re going to go and fix this.”
“I didn’t know you did this,” Draco says curiously, as Harry chases the kids back through the tunnel to where the rest of the parents are waiting.
“My father, everybody,” Malfoy says, downing his own drink. Harry notices his hand is trembling. “I’d apologise, but really. What’s the point? Please make up for his behaviour by drinking as much of his wine as you can.”
Ron fairly jumps at that, shouldering his pack quickly. “We should go then. No need to hang around here.”
“And after, Cambie is seeing that the tapestry in the hallway outside is needing mending, so I thinks it would be good to fix it, and I like stitches. But the work is tricky and Cambie has had a long day and is tired.”
Harry returns to the drawing room to find Ron. He and Cassie look up from their notes as Harry enters.
Harry stomach turns. He’d been so focussed on his defensive magic that it hadn’t occurred to him to actually
off the top of Ron’s dwindling stack, scans the ugly headline, and then, incredibly, tips his head back and roars with laughter. The whisky turns to ash on Draco’s tongue.
Harry says nothing, thinking about everything he’s learned over the last twenty-four hours. How few of his assumptions have turned out to be true.
Hermione tugs off the tie that is largely failing to hold back her messy hair and refastens it, though whisps and tendrils still escape. “I want to update her. I owled her late last night about a programme Ginny may be eligible for. I’ve been working on a new set of sentencing regulations for the Wizengamot relating to post-war trauma and diminished responsibility.” She pauses. “Trauma makes people do extraordinary things, Harry. Ginny isn’t the only witch or wizard who has ended up on the wrong side of the law as a result of what happened to them during the war.
The roar of the Floo saves him at least from having to tell an outright lie. He leaves Ron and Hermione to finish their meals, stuffing another samosa in his mouth as he heads up the stairs to greet the others.
“No point,” Harry shrugs, straightening up. “I’ll be gone in a couple of weeks. They can write whatever they like.”
At this, Harry spins back to him, his mouth a surprised and delighted little O shape. Draco very much wants to snog him senseless, but the Hogwarts regulars have long memories and he will never live it down.
Hermione wasn’t kidding about starting at daybreak. Harry feels like he’s only just nodded off when her voice pierces his dreams, calling through the wall of the tent.
And Harry’s forced to agree, leaving him at home for two days with Kreacher complaining almost constantly about the plans for the party. It’s a relief to have Kingsley and Ron and a cadre of Aurors he doesn’t know well turn up on Wednesday afternoon.
The answer is right on the tip of Harry’s tongue. He’s given it often enough. A humble and self-effacing little tale about how Kingsley relaxing the Post-War Prohibitions was such a
“Right,” Hannah nods. “I mean, you can even come with them if you want, now you know what you’re dealing with, but with back-up.”
a bloody Christmas sampler,” she complains, insisting on her usual black coffee and refusing the barista’s valiant attempts to upsell her to a peppermint mocha.
Draco looks over at him, standing with his hands shoved deep in his jean pockets. He’s smiling. He doesn’t seem offended. But it
He continues in that vein for the rest of the week, making excuses about needing to meet with Parkinson to deal with some administrative matter or other, and dashing off to the park to meet Leila. She’s a diligent, careful coach, never letting him extend himself too far. Within a week, Harry can fly basic patterns again, though he’s sweating and red-faced and tired at the end of it. He comes in for a shaky landing and hears a slow clap behind him.
Any student at Hogwarts knows the set of basic warm-up spells that are tested at the start of any practical exam — a way of making sure a student is at the right level. They each try to cast them:
He could go upstairs and ask Malfoy what kind of sandwich he actually wants. He could tell Ron that Malfoy is even here for starters.
“What the hell is she playing at, Harry?” Ron asks, a little less irritated than he’d seemed moments ago.
The rest of the third floor is desolate and empty. The path of destruction the ghosts left is the only sign that anything has happened there in a decade. As they retreat back to the staircases, Luna quietly closes each classroom door.
“So, what, you were…” Ron is still struggling for an explanation that makes sense to him. “Helping someone? You were trying to get rid of evidence, then. To help someone.”
“Harry will find out what really happened,” Luna says loyally, turning to clutch at Harry’s upper arm, giving him an encouraging smile. “Won’t you, Harry?”
“So when I thought that wasn’t what you wanted—that you were done with the rings, and done with me—I figured I’d just go back to the life I had before all this started. Only, everywhere I looked I realised it wasn’t enough. I
He looks around the impressive room, trying to picture Lucius — the belligerent patriarch — standing here, bellowing at Draco. Draco shoving his father to the ground and leaving without so much as a backward glance.
“And we decided to sleep next to a room full of potions ingredients that haven’t been maintained in a decade,” Hannah concludes, looking even more pale.
Neville has written him letters over the years. Always a little formal. Not cold, exactly, but as if Neville is expecting a poor reaction from Harry. In the intervening decade, as far as Harry’s been able to tell from scattered conversations with Andromeda, Neville’s been the one who stepped into the void Harry had unwittingly created. Giving humble speeches at war memorial ceremonies and attending the opening of public buildings. He looks the part, Harry thinks, seeing him now. Tall and strapping, like a celebrated war hero should be. More than Harry ever did, anyway. Neville’s letters were always carefully-worded invitations for Harry to come back, each May, for the Victory Day celebrations. As if Neville felt he was somehow intruding on a space that was more rightfully Harry’s. He declined every one. Sometimes more politely than others, depending on how much he’d had to drink at the time, a thought that makes him wince a little now when he’s confronted with the man himself.
The silence stretched between them, an ugly visceral thing, and Draco could only see a bird, flapping helpless in the confines of an airless cabinet.
of more. And Harry had missed that completely. He'd spent two years shagging this man and never taken the time to see who he really was, or to reflect deeply, or think at all, about what sex with Draco Malfoy might mean to anyone other than himself. And Harry knows why. Because he had never wanted to think about what it meant to him.
“You need to take the cap off, moron,” Pete sighs, reaching for him. Carl goes to bat his hand away and Robert’s about to intervene, but before he can even think, there’s a sudden
Harry realises he’ll be late if he stands around arguing with an heirloom any longer, so he resolves to just buy some wrapping paper on his lunch break and try that instead.
It was a bad idea, coming here. The house itself looms over them all like a spectre. No magical building can withstand the sort of horrors this place has experienced and not absorb them into every thread of tapestry and every plank of wood. Harry knows. He feels it every time he visits Hogwarts. The scars can’t be painted over.
“Yeah, I got a knock on the noggin on the weekend, but I’m fine. Just visiting a patient who’s involved with one of our cases.”
Hermione bites at her lower lip, looking back and forth quickly between Ron and Harry, but still she says nothing.
“So I’ll see you then,” Harry says, inexplicably picking up a rag and wiping at an invisible spot on the kitchen bench. He’s already as good as gone, the distance between them as wide as the Atlantic.
standing near the kettle casting, but the aroma coming from that general direction has a decidedly astringent sting to it that’s starting to make his eyes water.
They take about another ten minutes to reach the woods. When they do, Malfoy produces a small ornate silver hourglass, and flips it, allowing the sand to start to spill toward the base. “On your marks,” he announces, managing the very smallest of smiles. Then he turns back towards the trees and takes out his wand, muttering a very rapid series of spells with an elaborate series of wand movements. Harry hasn’t seen Malfoy cast very often since they were children, but it always takes his breath away when he does. There’s something both elegant and meticulous about his magic. A total contrast to the unrefined power of Harry’s own. A silvery wisp dances forth from Malfoy’s wand, forming itself into the shape of a unicorn. Harry marvels at the spectral creature. It’s similar to a Patronus and yet somehow much more detailed and substantial. Harry feels like he could reach out and pat its haunches. The illusion is absolutely remarkable.
Ron sucks in a breath and puffs up his chest as if he’s about to object, but Lucius cuts him off with a dismissive wave.
“It’s one of the things I asked Draco to consider for the grants,” she continues, ignoring the way Ron is fidgeting in disbelief beside her. “Muggle techniques for dealing with depression and PTSD. I think we could learn a lot.”
“Can’t you just, I don’t know, take the other things out of the vault and then destroy the rings? I mean, I don’t
The safety wards have been moved in to surround the affected glass case, and yesterday’s angry red fog seems to have dissipated, leaving a pulsing light emanating from the necklace. Malfoy, and another Curse Breaker Harry doesn’t recognise, are both taking turns to cast at it in succession. Malfoy looks exhausted, dark circles under his eyes. His uniform robes have been abandoned somewhere and he’s in white shirtsleeves rolled to the elbows. Harry catches a glimpse of his faded Mark as Malfoy swings his wand hand back and begins the incantation again.
Harry’s anger blows itself out, and he sags back against a locker. He glances up at Draco, who has fallen quiet.
have a way out if we need it.” She produces a teaspoon from her pocket. “This Portkey will take us straight to St Mungo’s if we need an evacuation. Hannah, are you injured?”
“I want to make a statement,” Harry barrels on. “If you’ll let me, of course, only with your permission. I want to say that everything in that article is completely false. And that the charity is above reproach, and that the only reason I’ve been at the dinners more than once is because you want me to help. Because
The first of September dawns bright and clear. And Draco knows this for a fact, because Teddy wakes them up well before dawn, practically bouncing off the walls with excitement. Harry groans, mashing his face back into his pillow and complaining about the cosmic unfairness of the first day of school falling on one of
Bill’s expression remains unreadable. “I’m not sure if you know, but Hermione has just had a baby. Their second, Hugo. She’s at home on maternity leave, and Ron’s away at the moment. She might be grateful for some company.”
And so now he’s the proud owner of a beautiful country property, still being carefully restored, where once a month, a
As the day wears on, Harry can’t tear his eyes away from Leila, who seems more agile on a broom than even Malfoy, her blue braids whipping in the wind as she ducks and weaves overhead.
“Harry!” The bartender is not the same one who served him earlier, and he seems delighted to see him here. “It’s been weeks. What have you and that boy of yours been doing?”
Harry eyes the younger player, still quaking on his broom. It’s not that he disagrees with Wood’s lecture about fundamentals, it’s just not proving to be very productive in Maxwell’s case.
It’s only that evening as Harry’s getting undressed that he realises he still has the parking ticket in his jacket pocket. He should have given it to Dawlish with the papers from the postbox, but he’d forgotten. He’ll find out which Auror’s been assigned the case tomorrow and give it directly to them. Harry thinks for a moment about also mentioning Malfoy, but decides against it. It wasn’t
“I think you should leave.” Draco’s furious. With Harry. With himself for getting into this situation. All twisted up with someone who is
Harry tosses and turns, but there’s no way to get comfortable. That foul man, raging in his decline, jabbing at each of their insecurities, at all their barely healed wounds.
Draco greets his guests at the wide double doors to the Barn, thanking them for coming and directing them to help themselves to glasses of chilled champagne waiting just inside on an oak bar, decorated with jars of fireflies and twisted bowers of greenery.
Draco’s flat has radiators that rattle, and so little insulation that he can hear when the man living above him takes a piss. He sleeps with a hooded Muggle sweatshirt on, snuggled under a pile of blankets warmed with charms that fade too quickly, wishing for winter to end.
As practice ends, Harry’s already working out how he can get through his exercises and get home without running the risk of stumbling across his half-naked colleague again. He’s pretty sure that if he just avoids the changing rooms at all costs, he should be fine, but he’s so busy thinking about it—or rather, trying
He expects to see that familiar flicker of annoyance or confusion, but Harry just smiles more broadly.
“What?” Granger’s on her feet in an instant as if she can do something, rounding the bed to grasp Potter’s hand. “What happened?”
At this, the elf seems to perk up immeasurably, a dreamy little smile taking over his gnarled features. “The engagement of Master Draco and Miss Lovegood,” he says, as if Harry must be a little daft to have forgotten.
She’s wearing a daffodil yellow dress and a necklace made of seashells threaded on red twine, and her hair is fastened up with what looks like matching coloured pencils. It’s a lot for Harry to take in all at once.
wandlessly, pulling forth the strands of his time with Harry over the last couple of months. The wild joy on Harry’s face while flying. The soft expression of concentration as he read to Teddy. Harry slicing vegetables in the Grimmauld kitchen. Harry bounding down the steps from a rollercoaster, eyes bright with excitement. Naked, clutching at the bedcovers as Draco presses into him. Laughing at something Luna said to him. Looking down at Draco on his knees behind the Bent Wand. Handing Draco a plate of scrambled eggs. Sliding into the bath. Bouncing his leg anxiously beside Draco at the memorial ceremony.
Potter looks around the bar, taking it in. “I guess it must be nice to be somewhere long enough to have a local.” He says
He leans to whisper something in Luna’s ear, and she pats his hand gently, a sad smile on her face. For the first time, Harry gets a glimpse of what this might all be about. Malfoy’s home life is clearly impossible. His childhood was probably as traumatic as Harry’s own. His wartime experience was obviously as bad, if not worse. And now, he has no family to speak of other than his mother. And now, strangely, it seems — Luna. Harry feels a faint ache in his chest, a twist on the feelings that have been bothering him all weekend. He can see Malfoy is suffering; and like it or not, he cares.
Ron looks around the assembled group in surprise. “She’s not here? She got an owl late last night and went out. There was a note this morning saying I should meet her here.”
to find the hotel only because these windy little streets all look a bit the same, and also because he’s not sure what colour door the hotel has, because who even looks at the outside of your hotel door as you’re leaving in the morning? Was he supposed to have done that? No one told him he should—
“Hang a calendar, perhaps?” Malfoy asks, arching an eyebrow at Harry, who feels himself go red immediately. Malfoy’s suit today is grey with a wide checked pattern, and a maroon tie fastened in a beautiful neat knot that Harry knows he couldn’t manage in a day of trying.
Harry’s brought up too short by a casually-dressed Malfoy on his doorstep to formulate any kind of response. Malfoy’s expensive-looking cream cardigan and dark jeans make Harry all the more self-conscious about the fact that he’s currently clad in yesterday’s trousers and a jumper covered in reindeer, and frankly, also make his mouth water a little.
Carl is staring at them both, eyes wide, clutching at the strap of the camera bag strung over his shoulder. It holds his father’s wizarding camera, so they can prove they’ve been inside. His knuckles are white where he grips the dark leather.
Opposite him, leaning against the desk, Malfoy’s cheeks pink up a little. Harry tries not to get distracted.
“Did you give them money?” Ron asks, but Harry’s already shaking his head. He’s never been particularly political about his sexuality, and he’s certainly never given any thought to Muggle charities.
Draco looks around. They’re in a field with houses nearby. A small rural village. He racks his brains. This isn’t where Potter grew up — he knows that much from the endless tell-alls in the press.
Harry shrugs uncomfortably. “Quit. Was fired. Take your pick. It sort of happened in one ugly row where it was clear I wasn’t welcome back in any event.”
There’s a horrible violent shuddering around them. Bits of rubble and paper, book bindings, and splintered wood all lift off the floor and are swept up into the ghosts’ wake like a gathering tornado.
“What are you doing?” he calls to Ron, who has inexplicably jumped up onto the Hufflepuff table, kicking some glass out of the way.
Harry is extremely torn between wanting to swing Kreacher around by the ears and wanting to sit beside Malfoy and
He stops at Fortescue’s for ice cream. It’s Monday, and he’s sure Teddy will have done absolutely nothing to deserve it, but Draco feels like
“Well, you’ll sleep better in your own bed.” Neville sounds reassuring, although Harry thinks he might be overselling the comforts of the hospital wing.
“There!” Harry points at the calendar in triumph as the weak light flares and strengthens. Better yet, when he glances down, his festive-wear is back to being one of his favourite hoodies. Unfortunately Malfoy’s now wearing one of Molly’s famous knitted creations: several sizes too large for him and with an enormous yellow H on the front.
Hermione goes up to the attic with him, bending double with laughter when she sees the enormous bell wrapped in a quilt. Harry concedes it wasn’t his best work. Together they dismantle the bell, levitating it into a corner of the attic and removing its charmed clapper altogether. Hermione casts a vigorous set of warming charms and the two of them climb out onto the roof to knit the tiles back into place. It’s a clear night, and the stars seem impossibly close. Around Grimmauld Place Harry’s neighbours have decorated their houses. An inflatable Santa is stuffed into the small balcony of a flat across the way. The bare branches of a tree in the front yard at number eight have been hung with brightly coloured lanterns. Number three has a row of giant light-up candy canes—presumably not the carnivorous wizarding kind—all along the rails of their fence. Everywhere he looks there are fairy lights.
Harry’s endured endless meetings over the years. League briefings and owners’ dinners. He’s sat through flashy presentations from PR flaks and advertising firms about rebranding and sponsorships and competitions to attract the crowds. None of it has made a blind bit of difference. Young witches and wizards these days are just more interested in learning about Muggle sports and pastimes, and their parents are all too keen to support them, desperate to signal that they were on the “right side” during the war. The last time Harry met Hermione, while she was on duty chaperoning Third Years on a Hogsmeade weekend, half the students he saw were wearing Premier League football shirts. Hermione was a bit sheepish when she revealed that the school was even thinking about instituting a football cup.
Harry slumps back in his chair, thinking ruefully that two weeks ago he’d envisaged this whole thing as a straightforward day trip.
“We did it,” Harry murmurs, unwilling to let Malfoy go. He leans in again, but is stopped by a palm soft against his chest.
It sends an ice-cold shudder down Harry’s spine. Whatever spell wrought this is clever and insidious magic. The pictures look real enough, even if they seem oddly frozen compared to the wizarding photographs he’s used to. He’ll need to get experts to analyse them to work out how they’ve been made.
, Draco thinks. Ivy has curled its way in around the window frames, and it seems as though small animals have made their homes in most of the soft furnishings. Through a sagging door he can see into the kitchen, where a tarnished, empty portrait frame hangs askew above a blackened fireplace. The house feels lifeless. A ruin.
“I guess you were right,” Harry says, passing a glass of champagne to Draco and taking one for himself. “I guess literally everyone
“Just for today,” Leila laughs, shrugging back into her coat and picking up her bag. “Give your body time.”
There’s a split second where Harry feels like taking out every ounce of his tired frustration on the weird little creature, but then he remembers Rose is in the room and decides it’s not worth it. He takes her hand and squeezes it. “Come on Rosie, we don’t need his decorations. We’ll make our own.”
,” he manages in disbelief. This odd little man must be pulling his leg. He waits for the chuckle that must surely follow.
“Well, if you’re planning on reading her a bodice ripper, the selection is almost limitless. Based on the title alone, Highlands romance
Maybe, Harry thinks. It makes him heartsore: the tantalising glimpse through the photos and emails of a version of himself that had been so happy.
He crosses the landing to the most damaged corner of the house, carefully opening the door, and sucks in a startled breath. The roof overhead has completely repaired itself. The sagging beams are standing straight and proud and the charred, cursed wood has disappeared. Any sign that this was ever a nursery is gone. It’s a simple, empty bedroom, with a big picture window overlooking the garden. The walls are a pale lemon colour, which Harry recognizes with a shock as the same colour as the walls in Teddy’s room at Grimmauld Place.
“Fuck,” Potter spits out, as if disgusted with himself, and Draco’s heart sinks to the bottom of his stomach.
“A training camp, of sorts,” Harry answers gamely, hoping that if he professes it with enough confidence, the squad will believe him. “We’re going to embed ourselves with Malfoy’s team in Prague. Learn more about new Quidditch firsthand, from the experts.”
“Some of it is straightforward. Things I find in my flat that I don’t recognise and don’t have an explanation for. The photo slip. This.” He plucks at the t-shirt he’s wearing. Malfoy leans forward and rests his elbows on his knees, head dropping and his hair falling forward like a curtain. It suits him, soft and without all the potions he used to smear in it as a child. Harry finds himself fighting an irrational urge to reach out and tuck it behind his ear.
“Based on his symptoms, I’d assumed that Potter thought he was trapped in some way,” Draco continues, rolling his shoulders to ease out a cramp. “That I would find him believing himself to be imprisoned, for example. Or pinned down somewhere. And that I would need to convince him that he was actually unrestrained and could wake up.”
He wants to make excuses for it, or point out that it’s not normally this bad, obviously, but Malfoy seems focussed only on the advent calendar.
“Harry, you can’t protect us from everything. There’s any number of things that might go wrong tomorrow. The roof of this foresaken fucking castle could fall in on us in our sleep — nothing is guaranteed. But I promise you I’m going to do my best to make sure we
Malfoy casts at the door, and then Sato tries it. They put their heads together, conferring for a few minutes, and then try a quick raft of spells in unison. The door still doesn’t open.
“Look!” Hannah calls, pointing at a large canvas hanging on the other side of the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. It’s a pastoral scene depicting a Welsh valley. Wandering down the hillside is a flock of sheep.
“Decorations on trees, tinsel. I’ve also been attacked by a rogue delivery of Christmas mail, and possibly ruined Islington’s annual lights display. Honestly, I think I should just give up. Clearly this is not the year for me to turn my hand to the festive season.”
Harry glances across at Malfoy, expecting him to shoot down the idea of serenading Harry’s ex-girlfriend immediately, but he just shrugs. “They’ll be a sympathetic audience,” he sighs. “Other wizards will recognise us, and Muggles will probably just have us arrested for crimes against Christmas.”
When Draco joins him at the bar, it seems that Potter is delightfully already several drinks ahead of him.
The worst part is that, oaths of secrecy or not, Harry knows for a fact that Malfoy’s found a way to host the most stuck-up version of a Muggle dinner possible.
Draco wakes to the sound of Harry in the shower. A glance at the clock shows it’s still early. He has more than enough time to dress and prepare himself for breakfast in the Great Hall before the more formal ceremonies.
Draco. The thought intrudes on Harry's shock, pulling him back to the present and the implications of the scene before them. How much more damage will this awful man’s death do to his already shattered family? Or will they feel on some level relieved?
“They strap you in your seat! They don’t even trust you to hold on!” Rose says, as if that’s preposterous.
“Harry! Are you decent?” she shouts, clattering up the stairs to his room, her Auror boots making a fierce noise on the polished wood. Harry rubs the sleep from his eyes and sits up, dragging the covers around himself before the door flies open.
Hannah says nothing as she concentrates on her spells for another few long minutes before she rocks back on her heels and exhales heavily.
When he turns slowly around, he sees the impossible. Stepping out of a shadowy corner is Bellatrix Lestrange.
He’s leaning against the wall, arms crossed. Harry’s unreasonably annoyed that he never seems to stand on his own two feet like a normal person. He’s always propping himself up against doorways and leaning over guardrails, and draping his long legs over the arms of chairs.
He thinks about going to the shop, he honestly does. But he then he decides it can’t hurt to try once more and Floos to the hospital instead.
Malfoy pays no attention as he looks around the packed room with thinly-veiled disdain, before levelling one pointed eyebrow at a junior Auror who immediately quakes and vacates his seat, allowing Malfoy to fold his impossibly long limbs into the regulation-issue Ministry chair.
“I don’t understand,” she says. “Even if I believe you were in his head, if he’s in a safe delusion what’s going on? And what do you mean he
Draco doesn’t think his heart can take this today. He reaches for Harry’s hand, lacing their fingers together.
“It’s pathetic,” Malfoy sighs. “When I was a child, the Christmas trees at the Manor would be these enormous, vibrant evergreens. The ornaments were sometimes hundreds of years old. Delicate glass and silver filigree. Charmed lights that danced on the tips of the branches. And a star on the top so bright, I thought someone had actually spelled it down out of the sky.”
“What do you want?” he manages. It seems unlikely that Weasley’s going to pull a wand while carrying a child, but one never really knows.
“Your temper isn’t helping anything.” Malfoy’s tone is icy. Harry looks up to see him sinking to sit on the bed beside him.
Calling it a mess is a bit much, Harry thinks. They’ve just misunderstood each other a bit. Draco wants someone Harry can’t ever really be. He’ll never be settled like Nigel and Thomas, with their season tickets to the theatre and their over-decorated apartment and their friends at the dog park. He pushes a piece of tomato around his plate a little too vigorously and the sauce spatters.
“I know you think we were being a bit hard on him before,” she says. “If Luna does wind up marrying him, of course we’ll … make it work.”
“Stable. But no better.” He straightens up, and wands Belle’s chart to the foot of the bed. Harry can almost feel his armour slot back into place, unwilling to show any weakness, as he strides out of the room without another word.
“No, no, of course not,” Harry soothes. “I just thought it might have been unavoidable. You might have heard something without meaning to.”
Harry stands, stretching out the kinks in his legs that Hermione’s spell hasn’t unknotted. He goes to fetch them both coffees—his with far too much sugar; Hermione’s black as tar, the way she likes it.
“Why are there so many security guards in a grocery section?” Harry asks, looking at one uniformed man still breathing out little puffs of fire, a terrified look on his face as if his mouth has betrayed him.
Harry’s mouth falls open in horror. He’s about to leap to his feet and take matters into his own hands, but Lucius beats him to it, standing abruptly and swaying under the influence of all the wine he’s consumed.
The answering pulse of magic is nothing like the weak, tired exhalation he felt the last time he tried this. Instead, the house feels like it’s leaning toward him, trying to wrap around him. While he watches, two broken cabinet doors fly up and reattach themselves on shiny new hinges.
Hermione gives him a small smile as she walks him to the front door, Hugo’s cries increasing in volume. “Go,” he insists, “I’ll see myself out.”
too much skin on display. Inked across Draco’s shoulder blades, tail feathers fanning down his spine, is a truly extraordinary peacock. The vibrant blues and greens are striking against his pale skin, and the bird seems at home in the lush foliage and colour of the tattoos in Draco’s sleeves. Harry had thought the art on his arms had just been an attempt to distract from the Mark, but now he can see that the beautiful designs are hiding a multitude of sins. A band of pale pink scar tissue extends over his ribcage. Three or four circular marks are grouped together at the base of his spine. Harry can’t help himself and lets out a strangled sort of noise. Draco turns around.
“Safe to touch with gloves on,” the elf insists. “Banny was just foolish and forgot my gloves, Mr Potter, sir.”
Harry glances at the other doors, and remembers the Yule log he’d bought at the Ministry market before all hell broke loose. He fetches it from the kitchen table, where he’d abandoned it along with the rest of his so-far-unnecessary Christmas shopping, and brings it back to the sitting room. He vanishes the remains of the broom, sets the decorative log carefully on the hearth in front of the fireplace, and steps back cautiously, expecting something terrible to happen.
Parkinson cuts a glance in Harry’s direction. His mouth drops open in shock. She can’t possibly be about to suggest that
“Poor Draco,” Pansy says, looking pale and already wearing black. Harry realises with a start that all of Malfoy’s friends are, as if there was some memo he’s missed about coming down to breakfast in mourning dress. There’s a part of him that will always feel like he’s half a step behind when it comes to wizarding traditions. Always a little out of place.
Draco shrugs, his hands shoved deep in his jeans pockets. “I’m going to have a devil of a time catching up before the end of term exams, but the conjured medical records certainly helped. My supervisor is giving me extra tutoring because of my recent
Quite right, Alice. This one does actually have pictures, Belle, so I’ll try my best to describe them to you.”
But then as his eyes adjust, he realises the ceiling overhead is only magically depicting a stormy sky, and the terrible destruction all around them is the windows. The beautiful stained glass that had once soared up the walls has all fallen inwards — the spaces themselves vanished with nothing but stone in their wake — and around them is a catastrophic forest of broken shards, piled high over the floors and tables and benches.
Harry thinks his shocked expression is fully justified, given the last time he saw Parkinson she was trying to hand him over to Voldemort. Ten years have passed and she doesn’t look any less dangerous, given her incredibly high heels, sharp haircut, and blood-red lipstick. Her suit looks like it cost more than Harry’s annual salary.
“How do you even know a sealing spell?” Harry asks, irritated with himself and taking it out on what seems like an easy target. “We know nothing about you and what you’ve been doing for the last decade.”
Draco looks at him like he’s lost his mind, or at least forgotten something important. Harry racks his brains trying to think what. A meeting? A birthday?
He tosses his napkin on the table and lurches out of the room, cuffing an unsuspecting house-elf out of his way as he goes. The little creature stumbles but quickly gets to his feet, smoothing out his uniform and hurrying away as if nothing has happened. A horrified silence settles over the room.
He looks at the guestlist sitting beside his keyboard. It’s good. The heir to the Firebolt fortune, Jock McKenzie. A healer whose advice show on the WWN has made him an instant celebrity. Cynthia Callister, whose photos modelling a risqué new line of robes have everyone talking. Beside the list is the pile of grasping messages that people send him practically begging for invitations. Scions of old families who would never have returned Draco’s owls in the post-War months now write these awful, embarrassing pleas. It’s not that he’s punishing them by ignoring them, he’s just not interested. They represent an era that’s over, as far as he’s concerned.
dangerous for both the players and the crowd. An almighty cheer goes up when a hex goes wide, catching a spectator in the hand and causing him to drop his drink. But he looks excited, waving his briefly-injured hand wildly and hollering, as if he’d just caught a tennis ball off a serve at Wimbledon.
“If I go, then the whole thing is suddenly about me, isn’t it.” He doesn’t really express it as a question. “They want me to give a speech, to
It isn’t that she’s wrong, exactly, but it dawns on him that he can’t work out when all of the important parts of his life crossed the Atlantic, seemingly without him noticing. It feels unsettling. Like he’s the half-repaired bits of Potter Cottage, still with a gaping hole in the roof. Improving incrementally in little fits and starts.
Which is clearly what Molly is thinking as she clears her throat delicately and asks, “Do you mean at Grimmauld Place, dear?”
So what if he’s unwilling now to get his hopes up all over again? To show Draco Malfoy, of all bloody people, his weak underbelly—figuratively
think this is fine. And so they find themselves sitting together on an uncomfortable wooden bench in the
Draco is speechless. His mind is thundering, trying to make any sense of what she’s saying and completely unable to.
“Think very carefully before you make a joke about my feet reaching the pedals, Draco,” she warns, walking past him up the steps. “Did you think we were going to transport six children and three adults in that beat-up old Anglia?”
“You’ve spent the last day thinking this was your fault... Draco,” Harry says, the word feeling foreign and uncomfortable on his tongue. “Now that you know it isn’t, is there anyone else here that might have had reason to want your father dead?”
Neville seems oblivious to Harry’s clear discomfort. “Something you and I were talking about earlier today, about identifying magical children younger. He’s been doing all this work on consanguinal magic lately, for your rings. I suddenly realised I bet he’d be able to help Minerva with it. Reverse engineering the rolls.”
Harry tries to work out if he’s asking because he wants Ron to leave or to stay, but Malfoy’s motives — as ever — remain opaque.
“What are you doing?” Neville asks, clapping Harry on the back as he joins him. Harry feels a bit foolish, but as he loads up his plate, he starts to tell Neville all about his run of Christmas bad luck.
Parkinson raps her carefully manicured nails gently against her knee, as if losing patience with the whole situation even though she’s only been in the room for a few minutes.
He squeezes gently at Draco’s hands, and Draco’s afraid to take a breath, because if he moves even one muscle he’s sure this whole moment will dissolve around him.
“Anyway, I’m in a bind now. I’m not interested in a legal fight with Gringotts—I can’t even imagine what a shitshow that would turn into. I’ve taken some leave from my job and I want to get this sorted. Whatever’s in that vault is all I have left from my mum and dad, and that’s worth more to me than anything. So, I’d like to hire you to,” he waves a hand over the table, “do whatever it is you do.”
Ron sighs. “It must have been a man. Narcissa Malfoy weighs, what, nine stone soaking wet? There’s no way she held a cushion over that man’s face while he struggled for breath.”
“All Ages night tonight,” the bouncer says, by way of explanation, and steps to one side to let Harry in.
“If it wasn’t about him he wouldn’t be hosting a flashy fucking dinner party once a month, would he?”
Luna is absolutely delighted, clapping and singing along with them. Ginny looks like she might be about to have a stroke from trying so hard not to laugh.  Fortunately it is over very quickly, and they get ushered inside for a hot drink and some gingerbread men.
Harry tries to imagine anything like this being possible during his school days and can’t. It took him leaving the country to even understand that the confused knot of feelings he had about his own attraction to wizards was fine and normal and nothing he needed to hide. It certainly wasn’t something they ever discussed in school. Though to be fair to Hogwarts, he supposes, they had quite a lot else on their minds at the time.
He doesn’t express it as a question. Malfoy will only read doubt into that. He blinks up at Harry in surprise, whatever cutting remark he’d planned clearly discarded. But almost as quickly his expression shutters, becoming carefully blank.
Later, Harry carries yet another platter of leftovers into the kitchen, trying to find an unoccupied spot of expanded bench space to slip it onto. He notices an extra place setting, unused, cloth napkin still tucked in its shiny ring.
Harry folds the rest of his clothes and stacks them in a neat pile while Malfoy continues to dither. Harry sits on the lip of the tub before lowering himself into the warm water, letting out an indecent sound.
Harry looks around the room. At the faded red and gold hangings and the little four poster bed in which he spent so many years. He thinks about the agonising nightmares and the fear. About the overwhelming fatalistic sense of obligation. He thinks it might be time to leave some of it here.
Downstairs, Rose’s efforts with the tree immediately lift his mood. Harry glances at the calendar. Yesterday’s picture of candles looks a little miserable. The wax has melted into ugly lumps, and the flames are a dying flicker. He should probably light a real candle at dinner tonight, just to cheer it up. The eighth door has Christmas biscuits behind it, in the shapes of trees and candy canes, iced in bright colours. Well, he has the cutters for it, Hermione’s snarking about his baking skills be damned. Maybe next weekend Rosie can help him with those.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Granger says, gently supporting his head as she holds a glass of water for him. It’s cold and feels soothing against his raging throat. She’s been crying and her eyes are red.
Draco usually keeps to himself on the weekends when there isn’t a game, so Harry’s surprised to find him leaning against a scoreboard watching Harry coach MiniQuidditch on Saturday morning, chatting to Hermione of all people. Harry’s been at it for about an hour, cheering the children on their little training brooms, flying back and forth a few feet off the ground. He’s freshly invested in it now that he’s flying at about the same level as his young charges, including Rose. He has no idea how long Draco’s been standing there and feels self-conscious again. Hermione watching is one thing, Draco watching is something else altogether.
Harry figures he could go to the hospital in the morning, because Belle’s awake and recovering, and the concept of visiting hours is stupid anyway, but there’s something that holds him back.
Harry is fully prepared to immediately return whatever ridiculous get-up she has delivered and damn the consequences, but he finds himself staring at the contents of the garment bag in confused appreciation. The dark trousers are cut to fit perfectly. The shirt is made from a rich black fabric and has a parchment note pinned to it saying “leave open at the collar”, an instruction Harry’s only too relieved to follow given he was expecting something starchy and trussed-up. And somehow the bomber jacket in the Arrows’ blue and silver manages to look dashing rather than ridiculous. A little American, perhaps, but Harry can’t argue that Parkinson has an eye. It’s better than literally anything in their current merchandise range, that’s for sure.
Neville makes the players new wand-holsters, adapting a Brazilian pattern and forming it out of a thin supple leather that sits close to the forearm comfortably and lets them draw much faster. The team still doesn’t have any budget for new brooms, but he and Draco collaborate on advanced speed charms that eke every inch of performance out of the ones they have. Any time he’s not on the pitch, Draco seems to be perched on a bench in Neville’s workshop, poking at twigs with his wand and cursing under his breath.
Harry pushes an armchair into one corner of the drawing room where he can sit out of the way of things. Ideally, he wants Ron to forget that he’s here altogether, if possible. The last thing they need is tension between them in the room.
Neville agrees easily and Harry gets up to give him space to step out of the fire, dusting off a little soot.
“As you know, Lucius Malfoy was found dead this morning in his study. The Medi-Aurors have made an initial assessment of his body and determined that no magic was involved, but the cause of death is, at this stage, still unknown. I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to all stay here so that we can speak to each of you and see if we can get to the bottom of what happened last night.”
When Potter spins around his eyes are damp and his face is flushed and he looks like Draco’s hurt him in ways he didn’t even think possible.
Harry hopes that with the illegal potions case wrapped up neatly he’ll be able to concentrate more fully on the final leg of his campaign, but if anything he finds himself more worn-down and confused. He’s sleeping terribly, tossing and turning and waking in the middle of the night abruptly from vivid dreams of places he’s never been: a country estate where he goes for walks on wild moors; a crowded dance party on a beach, pressed up against a faceless man’s broad chest.
. Give me some Pepper-Up, I’ll be fine.”  His throat does feel thick, and his limbs are tired. The nosebleed is annoying: his sinuses must be inflamed.
“But he wasn’t even really there. I mean, he was, but he was just lying there, on the floor. Asleep. And somehow that was
“Don’t call me that,” Draco mutters, catching the pencil he tosses down before it rolls off the bar. Kyle is a year out of Hogwarts, and as far as he can tell, little more than a socialite—spending the Travers family fortune and leading younger boys astray. He reminds Draco uncomfortably of an earlier version of himself. But with poorer manners.
Nothing. Not even the weak silvery wisps he’d managed when he first tried the spell. Ron stares at him in horror. They each try and fail, including Malfoy. Harry wonders absently who taught him the spell and when. Probably Malfoy’s happy memory involves something ridiculous, like unicorns attending his fifth birthday party. Harry can’t dwell on it though. Now they have a blocked exit and no communication with the outside world.
Harry pins him to the mattress in lieu of an answer. He figures Draco can’t have cause to complain about the linen if he stays on his back.
“Well, no one was more affected than they would have been after a few wines. The chef was very good. He’s from Oregon, in America, where it’s been decriminalised. The early dishes were much stronger, so that the effects started to set in toward the end of the meal. It was a very cerebral experience, Harry. You would have enjoyed it.”
That week, the Arrows’ win is narrow, but convincing. Even Oliver Wood seems overwhelmed, launching into an inspirational speech afterwards that goes on so long all the other players take turns at sneaking away to the showers while he continues to expound on the extraordinary evolution the venerable art of Quidditch has undertaken.
Harry wracks his brains trying to think how to explain reality television to Luna. “He lived in a house with some other contestants, and he lasted the longest.”
Before Potter can respond, the child in question is looping swift circles around the pair of them, cackling like a mad thing.
The boy in question comes out with his class to sing Away in a Manger. He’s dressed as a shepherd, with one of Andromeda’s best tea towels on his head, and a big fuzzy fake beard.
The stately home feels far less intimidating than the last time Harry saw it, with a closed-up, slightly disused air. The gates stand open, and he walks up the long driveway, glancing around for signs of life. Everything is under a thick blanket of snow. The enormous double doors loom above him, dark and imposing, as he knocks.
Hermione looks stricken. “What if...” she trails off. Harry doesn’t need her to finish that sentence. The idea that any of their loved ones are here — Fred, Remus, Tonks — is too horrible to contemplate. Worse, the thought of going back down to Ron and —
When Harry returns to Grimmauld Place from the pub the next morning, he’s relieved to discover the clothing situation has improved a little. At least his underwear is back to normal, and there’s one plain black turtleneck back in his drawers. The rest remains an unhinged collection of mismatched and sparkling festive-wear.
Harry bursts out laughing at his mistake, and offers to take them both for ice cream. Hermione, as expected, has an unending array of questions about Harry’s new spells, but as he eats an inadvisably large bowl of mint chocolate chip, he discovers he’s genuinely happy to answer them.
“Do you want penne arrabiata or not?” he asks irritably, and she holds her hands up in surrender and goes to sit on the sofa. They chat about their students and plans for the coming semester. An Ilvermorny rep wants to visit in a month and so they talk about what they could show her, Elsa taking notes in her giant looping scrawl. It makes him think about Draco’s tiny, neat handwriting.
“Harry, that chef, what she did with the plants was incredible. Wild jasmine flowers, and wood sorrel, and … did you know
“Harry.” She sets down her cup and leans forward in her chair, placing a firm hand on his knee so that he’ll know she’s being serious. “You are the most infuriating person an Auror could hope to be partnered with. Your casual disregard for the rules will only ever be completely exasperating. You always act completely on instinct. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
, Harry thinks with a sigh. He looks for the spell to disable the lights and casts it over his shoulder, unable to look back at the fiercely glowing tree.
“Let’s be clear about what you’re expecting here, Granger. This presents no small risk to me. If I go poking around in there and the war hero dies anyway, you know exactly who will be blamed.”
Draco is buoyed by the quiet progress he’s made. Writing the letters is hard, certainly, but the most difficult part is waiting. For that first moment when he can see the group of guests walking up the garden path from the Apparation point, lit by outdoor lanterns. For that first moment when he can see the person he’s written to and read the conflicted expression on their face.
The little wizard is shocked by his change in demeanor. “Alright, alright. The other one was lovely, no harm done.”
Harry lets the silence stretch awkwardly to fill the room. Balham can do his own dirty work—Harry’s not going to fall on his own sword.
“Oh, don’t worry. Wizards haven’t hunted real animals for generations,” Neville assures her quickly.
The first winter after the war, Harry lived at the Burrow. It was only the following year when he started to try and make Grimmauld Place liveable that he began to realise the full extent of Kreacher’s rigid Advent rituals. He and Hermione would stumble in from training exhausted and aching to find Ron staring in open-mouthed bemusement as the grouchy old elf dragged miles of decaying festive bowers down out of the attic. They ate takeout stacked on boxes of Black family Christmas heirlooms, and ducked under a ridiculously oversized wreath he’d somehow managed to fix over the front door. But even in those early years, with everything covered in dust and grime and a layer of tragedy, by the time Christmas Eve rolled around and Kreacher’s house-elf magic worked its miracles, the house shone from every corner.
“That last passage of play was really swift. Honestly, Morgan and North, you were really quick out there and it showed.”
Malfoy looks at him quizzically, still fiddling with the dark red heart, his pale fingers smoothing over the bauble’s sparkling edges.
So he found himself in Ration Alley, walking all the way to the end for the first time in his life, where the Wynn A. Ellingham Wizarding Library sat. A squat, stone building with wide oak doors that his father had once described as a place only the
Draco hurries past, rushing into the peaceful warmth of the library. In the open space, a group of elderly witches are sitting together knitting, needles clacking soothingly in their laps. He lets his heart slow from a racing trot. There’s no good reason that seeing his former classmates produces such a gut-wrenching response, but he hasn’t had to deal with them in months now, and part of him had hoped he wouldn’t have to, at least for the time being. He catches his breath as he returns the book on bindings, searching out a small pile of advanced charms texts he’s been wanting to read. As he steps back out into the Alley he props the books on one hip as he tugs his scarf tighter around his neck. It’s fully dark now, and the gas lamps have stuttered into life.
As September nears, Hermione agrees to help Draco and Minerva get the final legal sign-offs they need for the registration of the roll magic from the Ministry. He meets her for lunch near her office to give her the paperwork.
Harry seems to contemplate this for a long moment. Then he takes a deep breath and squares his shoulders as if he’s trying to steel himself for something. Draco would recognise that Gryffindor pose anywhere—as if he’s about to throw himself recklessly into danger. Harry turns fully to face him.
Harry decides to go and ask Malfoy more about his mother and his suspicions that her illness might not be natural, but when he gets to his office, Malfoy is nowhere to be seen.
