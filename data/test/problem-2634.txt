"Have I ever once doubted you," he went on to say, anger quickly filling up inside him. "In all of these years, have I ever once not trusted you?"
“I’m not worried about it,” he shrugged, laying more bacon in the pan like instructed. “I am mainly doing it to brush up on my knowledge before my exams. I’m sure I’ll be done in no time.”
"Bloody hell mate," Grayson said in amazement. "Quite literally bloody."
"Someone," Harry replied shortly.
“It is no problem at all,” Molly said kindly, bringing over a few slices of bread. “Hermione will be staying with us over the next month, Harry dear. She will help you with your studies.”
“Correct,” he nodded solemnly. “However, it will be less than a week until you, yourself, will be executing your revenge safely.”
“But that requires searching Hogwarts, does it not?” Harry asked.
Tomorrow Dumbledore would discuss some plans moving forwards with Kingsley, Nymphadora and Alastor about this trip to Azkaban. As much as he hated that he was even considering this, he needed to thanks to that stupid Weasley kid. Only the future would tell if the alternated plans would benefit his desired outcome or absolutely obliterated it. Either way, things were out of his control for the time being. And as much as he would very much like to choke the holy hell out of the two teenage boys - for very different reasons - he knew he needed to try keeping his cool around both Harry Potter and the Weasley family the next time he was in their presence.
“Harry,” Remus injected before Dumbledore could say anything. “Unfortunately that place has been locked down since your Godfather, Sirius Black, went to Azkaban.”
"This is a limited, one time offer," continued Fred, both twins looking serious. "You'll never have the chance to have the Weasley twins at your will ever again."
' nonverbally. Mustering all his magic since he would have time to recover before leaving.
“Occasionally I was looked after by Arabella Figg who is a Squib and part of the Order of the Phoenix,” Harry continued without responding to the comment, making his point.
With an irritated huff, Dumbledore stood up and walked over to the black cabinet off to the side of his desk. He unlocked the cabinet and out came a fragile looking pensive. The old runes and symbols that had been carved into the side looked as if they had only just been professionally done the other day, time not catching up with the centuries old item. The old man looked expectantly at Harry, waiting beside the swirling silverly lights. Walking over to the pensive, Harry swapped his knife for his wand, holding it to his forehead with his right hand. He focused on all of the horrible memories from his childhood. Bringing each memory down and adding it to the many stored memories of past Headmasters and Headmistresses.
Harry brought his own cigarette to his slightly chapped lips, sucked in and blew out a smoke ring as if he was saying “period” after his rant. To be quite honest with himself, Draco was impressed. What couldn't this boy do? He thought to himself and embarrassingly tried to do the action himself. It didn't turn out well, the ring was just like any other ordinary cloud of smoke.
Draco sat up and took a deep breath before saying "I've never.. I've never been in a relationship before so... I don't really... you know, know how things work.."
“Why do you-”
Draco nodded and leaned in again, slower this time. He wrapped his arms around the slightly shorter boy and kissed him. It was gentle this time. His lips were soft while Harry's were slightly chapped. But all in all it was a better first kiss.
All he wanted was Harry to be okay. All he wanted was a call or text or an owl from him telling him that he was okay and that there was nothing to worry about.
“Deny what?”
Draco thought angrily. “Oh please, don't think I didn't catch you staring at me as if you wanted me to be yours in sixth year.” Potter rolled his eyes but was still having trouble with the lighter. Draco's smirk fell.
Harry laughed again. "No I don't know, that's why you have to tell me,"
“You didn't deny it.” Potter smiled his dumb smile that everybody thought was so charming.
I never asked nor wanted any of this.”
Wearing a T-Shirt and jeans, the Malfoy quickly rushed to the car to get to the airport. He checked to see if he had everything and turned on the radio to listen to the news. Finally, he started the car and drove off. There was a beautiful pink sunset hiding in the clouds. It was the perfect mix of orange and pink. The clouds took all sorts of shapes and the sky was beginning to darken.
Steven felt a tingling sensation engulf his entire body. Wondering what had just happened to him, he opened his mouth to ask. Yet he found his vocal cords wouldn't work. He attempted to speak after another second, hoping it was just fatigue. Nothing. Nothing came out of his throat. He tried to hum, to clear his throat, to shout, to yell. He started hyperventilating. What had happened? What had this young man done to him? His world spun as he watched the other lean over and trail the tip of his knife along the exposed skin on his foot.
“You are all dismissed. Now!” Dumbledore shouted and a wave of magic shot through the room accidently, sending chills down the spines of many. “I shall call upon you tomorrow. What has been discussed and revealed tonight must not be talked about outside of this room. Molly, expect me to drop by with Harry later tonight.”
“And you are more than welcome to stay here for the rest of the summer. I’m sure Ginny will be fine if you share her room, right Ginny?” Molly looked upon her daughter with expecting eyes.
“And how did you learn wandless magic?” he asked in wonderment.
The second the door shut Harry allowed himself to slump in his chair. Exhaustion taking over his body after the morning he had had. If today was anything to base the next month off of, he was going to be drained by the end of it. But he knew it was worth all of it since the end goal was to defeat Voldemort. He just had to remind himself that this was all for his family and friends back home. They all relied on him to do this correctly. He had to think of Grayson’s future, he didn’t want the younger growing up in a world that would haunt him.
“That’s very kind of you, Mrs. Weasley,” he smiled at her before slowly looking around the room of six males and one daughter. “It’s very nice to meet you all.”
“But apart from that,” Drew paused as a smirk overcame his rugged features. “Your timing was excellent. I did not know you were awake.”
"Drew," Harry said after calming down. "I don't want it. Having the roof over my head and money in my pocket is more than enough."
“We, or I, might have been compromised,” he whispered with his head down.
A bright, white light illuminated the space near the tip of the wand, allowing Drew on the other side of the mirror to finally see Harry’s face. The two smiled warmly at one another, finding comfort in the presence of a loved one. Drew could tell that Harry was tired just by looking at his face. His usual carefree expressionless face littered with exhaustion. He wondered what was going on to cause him to be this tired. Perhaps it was the task at hand. Or maybe he was emotionally drained already. Possibly he just yearned for some familiarity and security as Drew watched content form on the younger’s face.
“I am not your boy, Headmaster Dumbledore. Refrain from saying that, before I lose any small respect I have for you,” Harry couldn’t help the anger that crossed his face, surprising all three other occupants in the room.
Casting a nonverbal
Harry grabbed the bottle of shampoo, pouring a small amount into his palm as the sweet scent of strawberry filled the air. He stepped out of the stream of the water as he thoroughly rubbed the liquid into his short, messy hair, massaging it into his scalp. Ducking his head under the water, he washed out the soapy shampoo and wiping his face clean of any residue. He decided against conditioning his hair today, instead planning on doing it tomorrow. He turned off the water before he grabbed the body wash. Pouring a large amount in his hand, he lathered up his entire body with the fruity smelling liquid.
“Once again, I don’t really care. I am only going because I have to. My main priority is Voldemort,” he saw her flinch out the corner of his eye. “Attending classes isn’t what I’ll be focused on. It’ll be training and refining my skills so I can defeat him once and for all.”
“Who?” Drew asked, sitting up straighter in his chair with worry.
“He was just sitting in the Headmaster’s office as we returned,” George snorted in amusement.
“No, I’m Fred,” the other twin said in feigned hurt, quickly coming to stand next to his brother.
“How would he have escaped?” Kingsley asked, perplexed with the whole situation.
“Wonderful. I feel like we have enough volunteers to move on creating a weekly schedule now,” said Dumbledore as he leaned forward in his chair, summoning a self-inking quill and parchment. “What days are you free Minerva, Severus and Remus?”
Harry wandered over to the hat, of course knowing exactly what it was, and placing his wand back in its holster on his forearm. He carefully picked up the delicate hat and placed it upon his head, instantly losing sight of the office as its large circumference swamped his head. Staring ahead into darkness, he waited for the quiet voice to speak. And he wasn’t disappointed as seconds later a whisper interrupted his thoughts. Knowing the magical hat uses Legilimency to communicate with its wearers.
To say Dumbledore was irritated that Harry had rejected being called ‘dear boy’ by him twice, yet allowed Minerva to without an issue, was an understatement. The manor in which the boy interacted with each person had not gone unnoticed by the Headmaster of Hogwarts. His attitude towards himself was very cold, controlled and spiteful. Whereas, Harry seemed to be more open to an immediate connection with Minerva, showing emotion and being honest during his communication. While towards Severus, the boy was very controlled in his responses, yet it did not seem like he had anything against the man like he did towards himself.
Harry frowned as he continued to slowly make his way towards the still invisible marker.
Finally she was left with just the quiet family, the Order leaving entirely except for the two Aurors adding and strengthening the wards. Hermione looked over at Ron and tried not her hardest not to laugh at the bright, red face. She always knew that the boy had a loud mouth, liking to contribute to the gossip going around school, but this was a whole new level of idiocy. One would think that if you were walking around with the missing Boy-Who-Lived, then you would keep your mouth shut. But she just assumed he was excited to show him off to her.
“Such a waste of space,” she said with disgust lacing her voice. “You should have died in that car accident with your parents. Ungrateful, disrespectful, little brat. Just as disgusting as your no good father.”
The peaceful stars were sudden replaced by an image of Drew’s softly smiling features. Harry looked over to find an identical mirror begin held up to the others’ face. He looked back down at his own mirror and picked it up to be right in front of his own face. Smiling back at Drew, he waved and laughed softly when he saw both the mirror Drew and the one sitting beside him wave back.
“Harry?” he asked in a whisper, everything hurting to move, to talk, to breathe.
“I never thought of it like that,” she hummed as she thought on it. “I heard you got into the Headmaster’s office on Wednesday night. How did you do it?”
"I said," he said a little loudly before bellowing, "Silence!"
“Is Mrs. Weasley making you stay for lunch for your efforts?” he asked as he set the bag down on the desk beside his book.
“What can I do,” he asked with happiness, glad to not be sitting around doing absolutely nothing for a change.
“McIntyre,” Harry respectfully nodded his head towards the older man.
“For yourself?” she asked, already knowing the answer, but still wanting to know from the man himself. “Or for Harry?”
As the minutes ticked on, the room begun filling out. Order members hastily made their way to the office by various methods, some clearly annoyed by the early morning meeting. No one approached him, even when the whispers begun to circle around the people in attendance. As Harry looked around the room, he noticed the only people missing now were the members from the Weasley family. They didn’t have to wait much longer as the family frantically walked in to the room, eyes wide with panic.
“Do you think these are just nonsense rumours?” Dumbledore asked without turning around. “Do you believe these have a merit to any truth?”
“Since you aren’t willing to share information about yourself right now,” sighed Dumbledore, his patience wearing thin with this boy. “How about we organise a plan for the next month. We, the members of the Order, will help adjust you to the magical world and customs. Train you to be ready for the threat of Voldemort. Catch you up on things you may be behind in so you can begin 7th year with the rest of your peers. And we will do anything to help you during this time.”
“Has there not been conversations between the two of you about this topic?” Harry pressed on after the silence went on too long.
“You little brat,” he shook his head with a fond smile on his face. “Grayson is okay though, to answer your earlier question. He is stepping up his training to help fill in your absence.”
“That’s okay, Molly. No need to worry about that,” she smiled, her cheeks turning bright pink in embarrassment.
“It’ll just take a little longer, that’s all,” he said as he guided the both of them towards the hedges.
That was a good question. Was everything okay? Would it be? Only time would tell. Nymphadora and Remus shared a knowing look before they both sat down at the table. Their bodies and minds fatigued after the long morning. Remus placed the bag of candy he had brought on the table, intending to hand deliver them after talking with Molly.
Gripping the ‘t’ shaped handle in his fist with the blade sticking out between his index and middle finger, Harry imagined someone charging towards him. As he moved around the space, he grasped the TPE material harder, ignoring the pain it caused him slightly. For if he was in an actual fight, the grip on the weapon was more important than any physical pain the awkwardly shaped weapon would cause. He almost scoffed at the image of an opponent knocking the loosely held weapon from his hold, not that it would happen.
Gasps rung around the room for those who weren’t aware or didn’t believe the rumours that had floated around before the meeting started. Harry lifted his hands up and lowered his hood, staring around at all the faces of the Order members. He observed the shock, the wonder, the hesitation, the disbelief. The silence continued on as they all stared at him, and he stared directly back at them. The hand continued to stay on his shoulder, and it took all his willpower not to shake it off in front of everyone.
“How did you go undetected for so long?” Hermione’s eyes were lit with wonder, food forgotten about.
Drew chuckled loudly as he moved his coat to the side. Harry sat up in curiosity, watching as the older male pulled out a squared shaped gift that was covered by a brown wrapping paper. He held it in his hands for a second before he passed it over to Harry. He took the gift from Drew gently as if this was the most precious item his hands would ever hold. He placed it on the ground in front of his crossed legs and slowly unwrapped it, careful not to break whatever was inside. The brown wrapping paper fell aside to reveal a brand new, clean mirror. It reflected the stars above, the well defined twinkling made Harry smile.
“Go back to bed, Harry,” he said quietly but loud enough for the youngster to hear.
Both points Harry had just made sunk in as Remus watched the younger talk. He didn’t know much about blood warding, but would it have been worth Harry staying in an abusive environment just to keep him safe from the threats of the outside world? No. No, anyone else could have raised him just as safely. Heck, the strangers that had raised him did a mighty fine job at that. And he was right, it would have been extremely difficult to look after a child during the full moon once a month.
“Harry!” someone yelled, bring all attention to Harry as he stood at the bottom of the stairs.
Taking his sweet arse time, he lingered underneath the warm water, not wanting to get out. Yet he knew the day waited for him to move on. Turning the taps off, Harry stood still for a few seconds to allow the water to drip off of him. Opening the door, he stepped out into the misty room. The warm air from his shower steaming up the entire bathroom. Holding out his arm, he summoned a towel to him from his clean pile. Making quick work of drying himself down, Harry dried his hair before hanging the towel around his lean shoulders.
"Who were you writing to?" the nosey kid asked.
"What do you want from me," Steven asked in a tired voice, resigned to the situation already.
“Stay here, do not move,” Harry whispered. “You’ll be safe here until I get back.”
“You will be joining us this year, I see. I have a hunch I know which Hogwarts House you would like to be sorted into,” said the hat.
“I’m sorry sir,” Harry’s emotions left his face and voice, a cold front taking over. “I will do better sir.”
"Just take them and leave me alone," he tried to beg. "Please, I just want to go to bed. I don't care what you do with them."
"Think of it as your last official mission before you leave for Hogwarts," he smiled and took a sip of his drink.
“Uh, Harry,” a small blush rose upon his cheeks.
“Stop it!” Ginny loudly whined, looking between the stairs and her brothers with slight panic.
“Arthur, tend to her arm while I have a look in her memory,” he said calmly. “Severus go make some tea for them and put a calming draught in.”
Hermione Granger was just a student at Hogwarts. She was not a part of the Order, she was not a part of the group Dumbledore trusted to keep everything quiet. While he did agree that Hermione was one of the brightest students currently at Hogwarts, he couldn’t see how it would help his agenda. In his eyes, it was just another person that could potentially mess things up. Dumbledore needed to have as much control as he could.
The peaceful moment he had created within him was once again disrupted as a shift in the activity peaked his interest. He could hear two sets of footsteps pass his floor and continue up, followed by a dull knock and then muffled voices. As the two sets of footsteps moved further up to the top level, he heard Arthur rushing around his room getting ready. With a heavy sigh, Harry opened his eyes and stared at his door, just waiting for someone to knock on his door.
Once Harry got to his level, he was expecting them to continue up the stairs. However he heard them follow him at a distance, heading towards his room. He turned around on his heel, surprising the two of them. The twins had been sure to stay far enough back to not been heard. Instead of speaking, Harry merely stared at them with an expectant look upon his face. But when the silence drew on, he gestured with his hand for them to explain what they wanted.
“I’m apprehensive,” he gulped and looked over to his boss and mentor. “I don’t know what to expect when I arrive at Hogwarts.”
The looks on everyone’s faces made it even harder. Especially Dumbledore whom was trying so hard to figure out the place before he needed to ask. Oh how fun this next little conversation was going to be. Oh, all the juicy information he was about to spill. Harry was hoping to create some waves within the Order, and big troubles for Dumbledore. He stared defiantly at the Headmaster as he waited, not bothering to look at the rest of the Order.
A plan developed in his mind quickly. Harry smirked as he grabbed the handle and twisted it slowly, only pausing when it made small screeching sounds. His eyes never left Drew’s form, praying he didn’t turn around while he was daring this new manoeuvre. With his window wide open, Harry leaned out of it and pointed his right hand towards the wall next to it. He concentrated on conjuring his magic to preform the
“What do you want from me?” he weakly pleaded, tired and sore.
A dark glint settled in Dumbledore’s eyes as he turned around and sat behind his desk. If he was to go ahead with this and successfully get Sirius Black out of Azkaban, he could at least hold this over the other’s head for a while. None of this would be possible unless Dumbledore was to help him. Not the three Auror’s, not Harry, no one but himself could free Sirius Black. He could perhaps guilt the imprisoned man into doing his deeds down the track. Yes, perhaps it was worth it in the end.
“What?” Drew asked in shock. “What did you suggest?”
Ignoring everyone else in the room, he continued eating his food slowly. His thoughts briefly turned back to the newspaper article before he thought of the future. He wondered how long until he would come face-to-face with the cold hearted killer that he was destined to either destroy or be destroyed by. He couldn’t also help but wonder what the first encounter would look like.
“I will get the owl once you are done,” she smiled before returning to the food.
“I’m too tired for this shit, Malfoy,” sighed Harry, watching Malfoy carefully. “Just say your piece and then kindly piss off.”
The mouth-watering smell of bacon wafted throughout the lower levels of The Burrow as Molly Weasley skilfully cooked away in the kitchen. Delicious piles of homemade food littered the long, wooden dining table; preserved by a charm to stay at the right temperature. As Molly continued her usual morning routine making breakfast for the entire household, four of her children had already awoken and were gathered around happily eating. Fred and George shared looks between themselves with a cheeky expression evidently on their faces.
"Not really in the mood, Gray," Harry let out a massive yawn as he stretched his arms above his head.
Dumbledore could only stare at the brat before him as his mind processed the words. How did he know? How did the boy know any of this? He could feel his face grow hot in embarrassment. He would be damned if he allowed the boy to spill all of his secrets today. Dumbledore would need to tread through the rest of this conversation carefully, steering in another direction if the boy said something he should not.
“I agree,” Harry nodded. “Shall we head back inside now? I’m quiet cold now the adrenaline has worn off.”
"I wish I could tell you why," he hung his head. "But we need to keep up our efforts. We need to find him and train him urgently. Harry Potter is our only hope."
“Thank you,” said Remus quietly.
The sun had almost completely set, casting the town in darkness. It was now a little safer for Harry to move positions and not become compromised. He slowly came out from behind the chimney, sitting in front of it now. Just as he settled in, Petunia entered the living room with an exhausted expression on her face and collapsing haphazardly. He watched as she didn’t even bother to change the channel, instead choosing to close her eyes and rest her head back.
Drew remained silent as Charlie was busy taking them down, he busied himself in thinking of the next step. His wand subconsciously sliding down in to his hand and ready for action the moment he was given the signal. He luckily didn’t have to wait too much longer as Charlie finally opened his eyes and nodded, staying still and waiting for him to make the first move instead. Not even hesitating, showing he fully trusted the other, Drew begun walking to the front door. The two of them looking over their shoulders the entire time, keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble.
“Dobby is sorry master Draco,” suddenly the elf begun to hit itself in the head repeatedly. “Dobby will make sure to give himself a good punishing.”
Reaching in to his pouch, he summoned up a book to pass the time with. With a small thud, a thick book landed in his hand and he pulled it out. Harry closed the drawstrings of the pouch before placing it on the desk. He looked at the book that had come up and was deeply amused by it. Perhaps his subconscious was thinking about his family back home as he was summoning a book. He ran his hand over the hard cover of the book that Grayson had brought him for his birthday.
“That would be very helpful. However, only if you believe you are up to such tedious task,” said Dumbledore with a kind smile, while inside he was jumping for joy as this would help his plans immensely.
“Why? Why are you treating me so nice after all these years?” Harry whispered after a few minutes of silence.
With a deep sigh, Harry throwed the covers off of him and sat up on the side of his bed. He sat there for a few more seconds, basking in the early morning coldness broken up by the warm sunlight. The dull contents of the room came in to focus as his eyes finally started adjusting from sleep. Harry finally pushed his tired body off of his bed, stretching his joints and muscles before making his way directly to his private bathroom. Turning the taps of his shower on, he firstly unfastened his wand holster and calf holster and placed them on the bathroom sink. He then begun to get undressed from his pyjamas, a plain grey t-shirt and short grey pants, and discarded them in to the clothes hamper in the corner of the bathroom.
Harry nodded, interested in what other opinions the boy would have. He could possibly use this as an opportunity to learn in-depth about the dynamics at Hogwarts before he arrived; however prejudice they may be. Before coming here, he had read up on each person he could interact with; teachers, students, Order members, other public figures.
“My, my, my. I have been awaiting this moment for a long time,” it said quietly. “What an interesting young man you have developed in to.”
“Don’t you
Or perhaps there was already a location that was already suitable enough to fit all of his needs. The only problem was that this property was locked down with the owner being imprisoned at Azkaban. As Dumbledore’s cold, blue eyes scanned the quiet land below him, he thought hard on the option. Would it be worth the trouble? Would it be worth stirring up shit within the Ministry of Magic at such an important time? Could he sacrifice the power he held within the Ministry just to keep his precious pawn safe?
“Shall we discuss our next topic?” Drew asked eventually. “The planned attack?”
“Busy. Very busy,” answered Nymphadora. “Actually, do you mind if I can borrow an owl? I need to urgently send letters to Headmaster Dumbledore and Kingsley.”
It had been just over ten years since Drew and his wonderful team of people had successful removed and transferred the soul fragment out of him. Harry’s magical core healing the scar over the years, each year it diminished in visibility until it was barely detectable. Not only had they discovered the piece of Voldemort had been draining his magical core, but they realised his mind had been tainted. He was infected by strange dreams and hissing sounds, memories and feelings that didn’t feel like his own. That’s when Drew had realised that his connection with Voldemort ran deeper than just a piece of soul within him.
The plan was to follow whoever returned back to Hogwarts, until he could safely break away and quickly make his way into the Headmaster’s office for his big reveal. As Harry settled in behind the bush, he mused about how he hadn’t developed a plan for after the big reveal. Unlike his usual meticulous self, he left the rest of the night to his spontaneous side. He double checked the Disillusionment charm was still active, hiding him from view, as he then begun to rummage around in his mokeskin pouch. Summoning some of his candy supply to munch on while he waited patiently, gazing around the quiet landscape lit by the soft moonlight.
"Please," Steven tried to beg one last time, his voice weak and body tired.
“What are you reading?” asked Hermione as she caught sight of the book in his hand.
Harry nodded and kept his eyes glued to the carpet in front of him which made the perfect excuse for his hair to hide the blush that rose in his cheeks when Malfoy touched his knee. Lifting his cup to his lips, he took a long sip as he glanced at Malfoy out of the corner of his eye and saw that the boy was looking intensely at him.
“This is going to be way harder than I imagined,” Harry huffed, covering his eyes with his arm. “He is infuriating. One of the most manipulative fools I’ve ever met. He expects me to just fall in line like the rest, to not question his words. But boy oh boy, did I show Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall some good childhood memories. Professor McGonagall immediately questioned how Dumbledore allowed that to happen. I could tell he hated me with a passion in that moment. He didn’t even bother responding to her, instead tried to integrate me on my whereabouts.”
After a lengthy walk, the pocketknife had led him to a more secluded part of the town. Along this road were houses that looked to be built in the 18
"Do you think he'll take us up on that offer? Even if we give him some time to think on it?" asked George.
The moment he had been dreading finally arrived late afternoon as a knock on his door interrupted his in depth study session. Sighing in irritation, Harry stood up from his desk chair with book in hand, pausing briefly to stretch his aching muscles before walking over to the door and opening it. On the other side stood Hermione Granger, which was no surprise to Harry. He lifted an eyebrow in expectation as the other remained silent.
Grabbing out the small box in his pocket that held his shrunken broomstick, he flicked open the lid and took out his Nimbus 2000. He knew that if he needed to escape, he wouldn’t be able to apparate without alerting people to his presence and potentially leaving behind his magical residue. Quickly getting his wand out, he casted a nonverbal Disillusionment charm upon himself and broomstick as an extra measure of precaution. Taking a deep breath, he recalled his magical signature that lingered in the air around him, before he trained his eyes upon the Potion Master and begun to concentrate.
“I understand my mission sir,” he nodded, years of training taking over as he spoke and listened. “I will not let my emotions get in the way sir.”
“How was Diagon Alley when you went back?” she asked with a kind smile thrown their way.
It turned out that the decision to evacuate Harry earlier had been for the best. The normally busy street was overpacked with parents and children shopping, as well as adults just going about their own business. As the two of them squeezed their way through the crowd, they couldn’t help but overhear the whispers and rumours as people walked by. Whispers of Harry being spotted in the Alley earlier, rumours he was back, talk he was with a certain red-headed family.
Harry took a deep breath before he finally opened his door and started descending down the stairs slowly. With each step, his heart beat increased as did his anxiety heighten. He reached the bottom step and turned to face the lounge room and kitchen that were full of familiar faces. His eyes roamed the room, unconsciously still on alert for any dangers. He stood there as his presence went undetected for the moment. The room was decorated with party strings, banners with words, balloons pumped with helium floating on the ceiling.
Perched on top of the house across the street from the Dursley’s residence, Harry Potter observed the quiet street that was shrouded in darkness. His eyes wandering over the landscape below as they adjusted to the lower visibility the rising moon permeated. The yellowish glow from lights within households illuminated the street, along with the orange tinge from the many street lamps lined along the paths. Harry’s eyes were trained on the window that looked in to the living room of 4 Privet Drive. Within, Petunia Dursley laid on the couch watching the television. The flickering fluorescent lights emitting from the boxy device illuminated the semi-dark room.
“Excuse you?” Dumbledore asked in shock, the further disrespect from the young man only irritating him more.
“Well shit,” he chuckled darkly. “This changes everything.”
“Come in,” a voice said loudly from within, the door creaking open on its own.
While the rest of the group begun to laugh, Harry stormed his way up the stairs and directly to Drew’s office. That was the last thing he needed after the way the mission had gone.
This time Drew tapped on the lid two times and a new wooden structure arose, holding a range of clothing he used specifically for training and missions. He firstly pulled out two double sided holsters for his weapons. He unclipped the holster already on his leg that held his trusty dagger before replacing it with one of the new ones. Placing the sliver handed dagger and V42 Stiletto on his left leg, he placed the combat and survival knife on his right leg. Drew left the holster he just took off on his desk as he moved back over to the chest. He grabbed out a big black coat with a fur hoodie, swinging the heavy item on and fastening up the first three buttons. Satisfied he had everything he needed, he pushed the wooden structure down and closed the chest once more.
As Harry slept, Draco and Severus discussed what was to happen. Draco learnt of the conversation outside and smiled lovingly down at Harry, swearing to protect his Lion from any further danger. He swore to help his Lion know what love is and how he should rightfully be treated in a relationship.
“So Harry, you never answered me yesterday about where your lightning scar is,” Hermione said after swallowing her mouthful, studying the quiet boy as he ate.
Drew who held his wand in one hand and the knife in the other, carefully walked back towards Charlie while showing off dangerous looking object. Charlie merely shook his head in amusement as he followed his boss back out in to the living room. The two paused near the cupboard under the stairs as they heard movement from above. Drew looked up and saw the marker that had been in a separate room from the others moving around. He watched with intent as the marker came out in to the hallway and moved towards the staircase.
“Can I come this time, please Mum?” he begged, standing up from his seat.
Sitting down on the bed to the left, Harry sighed heavily as he untied his shoelaces on his black boots. He neatly placed them beside the end of the bed, out of the way. Next he took off his leather cloak and untied the thick drawstrings of his mokeskin pouch. Folding the cloak, he placed it inside the pouch before summoning out the two-way mirror. Finding the other side empty, he decided to make himself comfortable by laying down on the already made bed. The second his head hit the pillow and a content sigh left his lips, a familiar face appeared within the frames of the mirror in his hands.
Nothing came out of Vernon’s mouth but gibberish, instantly going in to shock at who the invader really was. It had been many years since Vernon had seen the putrid kid, and it had been the happiest years of his life with him gone. He was thoroughly glad he had kicked the kid out. Even more so thinking it had resulted in the death of the burden child. But he couldn’t ignore the fact this person had the exact same rare eye colour as well as the same uncontrollable, messy mop of hair that his nephew had. The only thing that was vastly different was the absence of the ugly scar that had resided on his forehead.
Only after the older man had entered one of the rooms upstairs did Harry dare to move or breathe. Taking the last step, he was safely on the ground floor. He cautiously walked over to the nearest wall and stilled his movements as he saw the room where Draco and his friends were hanging out in. He needed to be careful with his next few moves. Too much movement or too suddenly, then he would most likely be caught out by them.
“I am here to speak with Sev and I brought Harry Potter with me. Just go tell Sev that I’m here regarding a very important issue,” impatiently spoke Malfoy, his grip on Harry’s hand tightened for a second before relaxing.
The fact Remus was selfishly giving up his time to help a boy he had never met before warmed her heart. Yes, the man felt obliged to help his childhood friend's son, but he didn’t need to. Nymphadora couldn’t help but admire the caring nature of the soft, older male. Her heart clenching as she remembered the emotion in both his eyes and voice moments ago. She saw so many qualities in the other that were rather endearing and attractive. Finding her face growing hot as Nymphadora found herself thinking about the other in that way.
The kitchen sounded very quiet for the first time since Harry had arrived at the Burrow. Curiously peaking around the corner, he found that only Molly stood in the kitchen, cooking away like a mad man. A soft smile graced his face as he quietly walked into the room, not wanting to disturb the woman that was deep in the zone. Harry really appreciated all of the hard work Molly does. She was constantly in the kitchen cooking food for an overcrowded household. If it was him, it would have driven him up the walls by now.
“We both think he knows more about magic and our world then he lets on to,” George mused as he pretended to think hard.
“I’m very sorry, Aunt Petunia. I only had my hands to use,” young Harry softly spoke with his eyes trained on his aunt’s shoes.
But their moment was ruined when the portrait opened and the one and only Severus Snape entered his private quarters, well it was meant to be private. But he found two teenagers- no, young men- sitting on his couch. He walked over to them and sat in his chair that was his, and anyone who sat in it would be damned.
“What? You would have what?” scoffed Harry. “Try and save me only for me to be put back in their care by Dumbledore? You wouldn’t have succeeded in helping me, Remus.”
at him then quickly threw his knife. The tactic seemed to work because just as the older man had disarmed both of the incoming spells, his left bicep was hit instantly by Harry’s unsuspecting knife.
“I would be honoured to be taught by you,” said Harry, turning his head to look at her with a kind smile upon his face.
Dumbledore couldn’t care less if Molly came to visit him or not. However he took a moment to think on the matter some more. Hermione Granger was the same age as Harry, and if he remembered correctly, a muggle born. Perhaps if he surrounded Harry with someone that had experience in the muggle world, instead of all of these people from the wizarding world, it would help him open up more. It could be beneficial to surround him with something familiar instead of all of these new experiences.
Harry watched Steven squirm as he moved to stand over him, one leg either side of his torso. He knelt down and sat firmly on the man's stomach. He could feel the panicked breathing underneath him, see the uncomfortableness on his face. Harry smirked as he slowly leant forwards, sliding his hands up his chest and over the tight ropes. Pausing briefly, he adjusted his grip on his knife before he moved the rope to bunch up on his shoulders as well as down towards his stomach, leaving space for his chest to be exposed. With the tip of his Tatang knife, he gripped the white t-shirt and tore it open vertically. He revealed the pale white chest after ripping the shirt some more.
Not wanting to hurt his back by the heaviness of his uncle, Harry casted a silent ‘
“W-Who are you?” Vernon stuttered in a weak whisper.
“Harry, please don’t be unreasonable. You need to stay with a wizard your age to help you. We are only thinking with your best interests in mind,” said Dumbledore as he placed a firm hand on the young boy’s shoulder.
"A book on spells," he answered.
“How are you feeling about starting your study in a few days?” she asked, watching Harry put a plate of bacon on the table. “Just one more plate of bacon should do, dear.”
“I’ll go if anyone wants to join me,” said Nymphadora as she got up from the chair in the kitchen. “I have the day off after all.”
“I don’t believe you,” said Fred while narrowing his eyes.
The man was way more observant than Harry expected him to be. But to be honest, when there was a knock at his door, he wasn’t expecting Remus to be the one on the other side. Perhaps that’s what he gets for letting his guard down slightly. He hadn’t been here for long but Harry was already getting sloppy. And he knew that training and learning from Remus was definitely going to be interesting.
Before the other two could answer the burning question that hung in the air, the backyard and children disappeared from view. There stood Vernon, looming over the tiny frame of Harry Potter, he looked to be only two years old in this particular memory. A loud smack rung out in the quiet room as leather belt met flesh. Severus closed his eyes at the familiar scene, memories he has suppressed many moons ago resurfacing. Each time the material would harshly hit the child, he inwardly flinched as he felt the pain in his very own torso.
The room watched the interaction, some with intrigue while some were utterly confused. The Headmaster tried to play off the small show of disrespect by walking back behind his desk and sitting down. With a wave of his hand, chairs appeared around the room. He gestured with a kind twinkle in his eyes for everyone to sit down. Harry ignored the order to instead stand off to the side in a pose much like before; arms across his chest and foot propped against the wall.
Finally, his victim started to come around back to reality. It was almost as if he had forgotten where he was as he looked around for a few moments in utter confusion. Well, as much as his facial features could convey that now. Steven started frantically wiggling around, trying his best to loosen the ropes around him. Yet his efforts turned out futile. He simply stared up at the man looming above him, hoping whatever was next would end him there and then.
A young, slender man ran through the dark streets. His long, leather cloak flickering behind him and his black boots splashing on the drenched pavement. He quickly came to a stop outside a two storey house and swiftly got his breathing under control. The young man stood there until he could no longer hear his breathing but just the pitter patter of the rain and the rustling of the trees against each other.
Finally closing the door without any more interruptions, Harry sat down on his bed with a sigh. He gently placed the book on the bedside table, careful not to crease the covers. Everything was frustrating. Being stuck in a house full of strangers, not being able to escape whenever he wanted, being forced to interact, having next to no personal space. He needed to get out and go. He needed to run off some pent up energy.
“Did he apparate?” quietly asked Minerva as she tried to wrap her head around what had happened.
Dumbledore took his hand away from Harry’s shoulder and begun to walk towards the front door. He took in the expressionless face of the younger, getting annoyed he would not give anything away. Knocking a couple of times on the door, he waited patiently as he heard frantic footsteps from within come closer. Dumbledore turned to Harry and gave him a soft smile as a last ditched effort before he would soon be departing. Yet the boy did not even look him in the eyes, instead staring at the door patiently.
The group laughed, all chance of being caught gone for now. Harry kept his eyes trained on the group while warily taking steps to his left and back against the wall.
“Not my house,” he replied as he rolled his eyes and followed her up the staircase.
“Carpe Retractum,” he whispered under his breath.
Drew held his wand and knife out, ready to strike. While Charlie pulled out two short swords from their sheath on his back, their silver metal catching in the blue light and reflecting on to the walls as they both moved closer to the bed. Laying in the bed with their backs to each other, were Vernon and Petunia Dursley. The disgusting, fat husband snored so loudly that water in the nearby glass reverberated. The tiny frame of Harry’s maternal aunt was the closet to the two, she was curled in to herself on the edge of the bed. She obviously didn’t want to be near her husband while he slept, probably afraid he’ll suffocate her.
“And I wouldn’t want to cause such a disturbance to the family that is providing a roof over my head,” said Harry, surprising everyone. “Perhaps to make it easier, I could come to Hogwarts each day and return once the day has finished.”
“Yes, but I don’t see what that has to do with anything.” Draco said, aiming for nonchalance, even as he heard Harry make a squawk of surprise at the information.
She swept out onto the deck, and Harry followed helplessly in her wake.
After the War, Draco had moved to France.
“We had Bill come down to try to break the curse, but he said he couldn’t figure it out. Ron and I tried asking Harry about the curse, trying to pry out any clues we could on how to break it, but Harry just... can’t answer. He always talks around it, like it’s not there. The only things we’ve been able to understand that might be the answer is that... well.
“How the bloody
Just when Draco thought he would go mad with it, already on the edge of coming, but painfully desperate for more sensation, Potter pulled back, just slightly, and got his tongue on the tip of Draco’s cock, and began his next assault.
. You
As he watched, a new text notification appeared, and then another; a rapid succession of blinking lights flashing across the small display screen.
“If you’re so desperate for it, Potter, I suppose I’ll allow you.” Malfoy demurred, still looking flush and innocently chagrined at the thought of it.
Her brown eyes widened as she took in Draco’s form as he reclined back in his chair.
Harry’s brow furrowed, his own eyes turning hard.
Immediately making a beeline for the shower, Harry stripped as he went, unable to resist the need to be free of the constraints of his clothes.
“Breed me,
. It tended to include incredibly well fitting, tailored suits, trousers which always somehow managed to cup his gorgeous bum in an unseemly way, and waistcoats that drew your eye to just how tight his waist was.
“I do apologize, mother, but the situation was all a bit too... sensitive, to convey in letters. I wanted to be able to speak with you in person.”
“Thank you, Narcissa.” He said, truly grateful.
Potter’s hands were harsh and quick as they stripped the rope from him, a pleased growl rumbling out of him at the marks they had left on Draco’s pale skin.
. I’ve been searching for you for months - maybe forever. No one has ever
Now, he was ready to head out on to the water, as it was the night of the full moon.
Harry pursed his lips in a frown, and then went back to pacing, eyes flicking to the door anytime there was the slightest hint of noise beyond it.
To say that Draco craved
Malfoy’s breathing stopped, and he still refused to look at him.
your slutty little arsehole loves being stretched nice and wide, and I want to see you push another one of my eggs out, baby. It looked so fucking
Tears were filling Draco’s eyes, and he covered his mouth with one hand, his silvery gaze wet as he took in the sight of Harry on his knee, recognition blooming on his face as he stared at the rings.
“Hmm, yes. I never quite pictured you lounging about in a dungeon. It does give one thoughts about how noble you really are.” Malfoy replied.
He allowed himself a moment to just bask in the afterglow, but he was nothing if not thorough in his research, so he was determined to confirm if his body was capable of multiple orgasms, which really, was one of the most fantastic things of being in a female body.
When Draco finally rose from a late afternoon nap, the sun hanging low on the horizon, he seemed galvanized, determined.
He was still painfully attracted to anyone possessing a high level of magical energy, as Veela’s preferred to mate with the most powerful witches and wizards, not unlike how a succubus or incubus fed off sexual energy.
He breezed through the door, opening the wards to admit Harry, and carefully took off his heels.
“Harry James Potter!”
“Ah, ah, ah.” The mermaid chided, pulling his arm away, twisting his wrist out of Draco’s clawing grip easily. His skin was apparently thick, for Draco’s sharpened nails appeared to have no effect on the flesh. “Don’t worry little one, I promise not to hurt you, but you have to be good for me. You
One day, a few weeks after Draco had perfected his latest potion, Draco asked him if they could meet a friend of theirs for lunch in town. Harry, ever leery of strangers, and not remembering any of their friends at all, was suspicious, but willing to allow the meeting because his mate asked so sweetly.
Thank Merlin the man was also willing to provide Draco with a crash course on some of the major charms he would need to actually pilot the boat.
“Green.”
“Oh Draco, you
His mate looked beyond gorgeous in the red-tinged sunset, his belly swollen in a way that Harry could sense needed relief.
Draco rolled his eyes, clearly annoyed at Harry’s delaying.
.” The ginger man bit out, sounding disgusted, his blue eyes judgemental.
“Oh Malfoy,” Harry cooed, mouth watering. “I’d rim you for hours if you let me. Your arse was
When Draco finally started to whine in discomfort, Harry withdrew the clasper, and his ovipositor finally felt the relief of jetting out some of its own thick jelly, filling his mate even further, and forming a fresh plug to seal Draco’s cunt up again.
Harry had just gotten back from a long run along the beach when he heard Draco yelling. He sprinted into the house, his magic crackling around him, only to find the man smiling in delight, holding aloft a faint lavender potion, already bottled and sealed, with a handful of others on his bench.
Draco let out a wrecked sound, but felt himself nodding. A tear spilled over, and his vision went blurry.
The ovipositor popped in quickly, easily bullying past what little resistance Draco might’ve still offered. Draco made a little noise, something of a mix between confusion and pleasure, but he lay still, looking fucked out and exhausted already.
“I should check you over first; make sure you’re okay.” She said, pointing her wand at him again. “Can you tell me what happened?”
Draco felt wave after wave of
, his hole flexing and throbbing, clenching around Potter’s probing tongue, trying to suck it in.
He wanted
Movement caught Draco’s eye just out of his field of vision, deeper down below, and he managed to angle his head just slightly to catch a glimpse of what it was.
“Fine. Will a verbal compact suffice, or will we be needing a signed legal document and a notary?”
He strained against the ropes holding him, feeling them tighten and squeeze around his pecks as well, only adding to the fire of sensation that lashed through him.
Instead, he’d been forced to sit in his constricting Auror robes in various squashed, windowless meeting rooms full of Ministry employees.
Next, he pulled a second bundle out of the main jar, staring down at it, biting his lower lip.
“Like a little star.” Harry breathed, and Draco’s heart clenched.
When he finally arrived at Draco’s cock, he found it still half hard, and leered up at Draco with a hungry look in his eye.
. Please!”
He had spent a whole year learning all about Muggle advancement in science and culture; learning about their rich history, and their staggering accomplishments, particularly in recent decades. Draco now truly understood just how
“Indeed.” The Healer agreed, staring at him, trying to give him time to draw the conclusion on his own.
to suddenly adopt muggle fashion as well.
“I’ll insist you call me Harry, then.” He replied, returning an even brighter smile.
“Oh you know me.” Beckett shrugged. “I’m too old for demanding little princesses like that; I need someone more my pace, and this one is too young and fiery for my tastes; too much work to train, and I doubt he’d like my style even then. I picked him up at The Yard Bar last weekend, on account of him being all over me and just about gagging for it, but the minute I got ‘im in the sack, I knew he was more up your alley.”
But Harry was already gone. He’d taken a Curse Breaking job in France, and only Hermione and Ron knew what had become of him in the year since.
“Hush, darling.” Narcissa said, tone soft yet chiding. “Stay seated and drink some tea. I will ask Mipsy to order a special blend I used to drink when I was pregnant with you. It will help settle your stomach. You shouldn’t be overexerting yourself.”
Draco, still baffled, pressed on. “Then what has he done to me?”
Though he’d been nearly consumed by his studies during every waking moment, dedicating himself to two entirely separate educations simultaneously, his passion and determination had driven him. There was something for him to unlock, here, where magic met science.
Blood continued to bloom in the water, and Draco often had to stop to cast minor healing charms on the little lacerations on his fingers and palms.
being able to squeeze himself into a sweet, willing, receptive body. Being able to shove the whole, thick length of him inside of a tight, wet heat.
Draco and Hermione both turned to look at Harry, their brows furrowed at his response.
Draco was so full; stuffed and plugged with Harry’s clutch tucked up safe inside of him. The smaller man was so round and full of eggs that he looked to be well into his second trimester, and Harry moaned at the thought of how Draco would only grow more swollen and round as his clutch quickened.
with all four of his fingers, wedging his hole open, tongue and teeth and lips sucking at him as he was opened wide.
Draco went eagerly as his limbs were manipulated, his body turned onto his front.
Draco keened, awash with sensation as another finger squeezed into him, taking up a brutal pace as he was finger-fucked, Potter still tonguing furtively around his hole where it opened up around his fingers, sucking and lapping, wetness positively dripping.
That dark head pulled back, green eyes flicking up to look at him, a moue of confusion marring his slick lips. “Doesn’t it feel good, sweetheart? You don’t like it?”
had been bringing it up constantly, so he settled back in his own chair, arms crossed over his chest, and sulked.
A flare of white light burst through the room, and Harry felt incandescent with it. He was wrapped with warmth; with safety and happiness and hope and

“I - I intend to cherish him.” Harry said. “I do cherish him. I want to live with him forever. I want to keep him safe, give him everything he needs. He’s going to give me a child, and I... I would give him the world.”
It took only the smallest amount of effort for Harry to work the plug free. He adjusted his grip again, pressing his hips forward against Draco’s arse, sliding his clasper up between his cheeks.
They had prepared a full Tea. Draco had started some baking projects, hoping to make a Victoria Sponge, as was his mother’s favourite, but had had to give up part way through, his stomach getting too much in the way.
“Oh yes, yes
Swallowing, a soft pink tongue came out to run along Malfoy’s lower lip. He cast his eyes down, thinking.
Draco Malfoy.
Hermione arrived in all due haste, and Harry smiled at her, pulling her into a quick hug and muttering “the curse is broken,” into the cloud of her hair. She beamed at him, and watched as Harry took hold of Draco’s left hand in his, showing off their rings. “He said ‘yes.’”
“You remember everything I told you about how to harvest it?” Neville asked, his do-gooder Gryffindor nature prompting him to need to warn Draco over and over again. “Mermaid’s Thistle has to be picked under the light of a full moon -”
His normally lean and flat pecs were just slightly more full, the flesh swelling up from his chest in a plump curve, ending at the peak of his tight, pink nipples.
“Draco!” Hermione already had her wand out, and Harry fought back a snarl as she pointed it at his mate. “I arrived as quickly as I could, but the portkey offices - oh.”
’ Malfoy. Now, will you let me lick your arse? You can always tell me to stop, if you don’t end up liking it.”
It really was the perfect fit.
A gasp burst from his lips as he touched his cunt again. It was slick all between his lips now, and as he trailed his sharp-nailed fingers carefully over the still fluttering hole there, he could feel just how viscous and thick his slick was, perfectly suited for the underwater environment.
“Will you still let me eat you out, sweetheart?” Potter questioned, staring up at Draco, nostrils flaring, mouth open with want. “Let me get you wet and open for me?”
Heaving himself back onto his boat one last time, Draco tucked the last of the flowers into the jar, and stoppered it carefully. Then he looked to the other jar of gillyweed, and bit his lip.
“So good.” Draco murmured, bringing a hand up to tangle in Harry’s hair, pulling him down to snuggle up into the larger man. “So
He looked so -
The other man looked lost for words for long moments, one of his delicate hands coming up to rub at his eye, either to whisk away the remaining sleepiness, or in disbelief; Harry couldn’t tell.
“I am trying very hard to be understanding, Harry.” Draco began, voice somewhat tight. Harry gave into the urge to cup his mate’s face, turning those icy eyes to look into his. Draco managed a weak smile at him, and Harry’s worry flared. “I know it’s not your fault, Harry, but you can’t just - keep me here, and not let me go home!”
‘Then this afternoon he texted me.” Beckett stopped to laugh, pulling his phone out of the pocket of his jeans. “‘
Draco continued to hold him back though, forestalling Harry’s attempt to bury his face back between his mate’s legs, this time with the goal of licking into his cunt and making him come from his clit.
my favourite, as it happens. It’s 9 inches.” He gave Harry an assessing look from under his fair eyelashes, as though challenging him.
The cool air felt fantastic against his bare skin, and it was only a thin amount of restraint that stopped him from stripping completely and running starkers into the woods behind his house.
“Ah - no.” Harry admitted, offering Draco a sympathetic smile. “But that doesn’t matter at all, because you’re
“Sounds like a complete brat.” Harry observed, his cock already having thickened at the description. “And you said he’s coming here tonight? Does he know about me? About kink in general?”
Harry caught Draco’s hand when it tried to reach down to jerk at his hard little cock, pinning it down.
Potter’s tongue was not idle either, and it played languidly along the bottom on his shaft, stroking and coaxing, the only counterpoint to the man’s constant suction.
A camera shutter, a bright flash, and both of them looked over to find a grinning pap smirking at them from behind a nearby bush.
Harry had made a good friend in Beckett, a muggle who he had once picked up in a gay bar just a year after the war, after his breakup with Ginny and after he’d given up trying to find a partner in the Wizarding community.

Draco moaned a long, greedy approval as Harry fed him the rest of his cock, inch after inch sinking into him, filling him up.
Neville gave him a disbelieving look, huffing out a laugh. “‘Minor side effects.’ Yeah, right. Well, I’ve given you all the warnings I can, so don’t come crying to me if your bits go all weird.”
over the bud of his swollen clit, until just minutes later, Draco was shaking through his first orgasm.
outlet for his pent up energy.
“Harry.” Narcissa’s cool voice drew Harry’s gaze down the hall, to where the statuesque woman was gliding gracefully towards them, looking completely composed and put together despite the last minute summons.
He was moaning, loud and desperate, eyes torn between clenching shut at the sensations, and staring, wide eyed as Potter feasted on his flesh, mouth and hands gluttonous as they sucked and groped and coveted.
The sharp prick of nails at his hips, the growing pressure at his clenching hole, and the blinding pleasure of heat at his core were suddenly blotted out by the sharp pain of Harry sinking his teeth into the meat of Draco's neck.
Draco was completely flush with embarrassment as Harry pressed him down into the nest of the floor of the grotto, so shy with it that he even looked away as Harry hooked his hands under Draco’s knees, spreading him wide.
Saliva dripped down his crack, pooling along the leather under his lower back as Potter manhandled his arse open, angling Draco so that he could feast on his hole.
“Are you part Dementor now as well, Potter?” Draco teased, but worked with Harry as he moved to bring the bottle of water to his parched lips.

Harry propped himself up on his elbow, and gazed down at the figure laying asleep beside him, at the man’s platinum blond hair and pale skin, so radiant in the sun’s light.
, how lucky am I that you can come just from your tits? That’s the hottest thing I’ve ever seen, baby.”
“Dunno.”
“I need her to come here, Harry,” Draco continued, “because she is one of the most talented Mediwizards in the world, and you have impregnated me, a male wizard in the possession of a temporary, gillyweed induced vagina, with eggs. Mermaid eggs.”
It wasn’t
There were a few scattered seating areas spread throughout The Griffin, interspersed between all of the fixtures for scenes, including a St. Andrew’s Cross, a few stages, various pieces of specialized sex furniture, cages, and other paraphernalia. It was still early, but as it was a Friday night, the club had begun to fill up, and various couples or groups were already in the full swing of things.

“I can’t -” Harry gasped, voice wrecked. “Oh
Huffing, partially annoyed, partially amused, Harry sat back in his own chair, unrepentantly palming his cock to readjust it to sit more comfortably in his trousers.
In the end, he was too caught up in staring at Malfoy to make a decision. The absolute tosser apparently had another, previously unseen side to his muggle wardrobe.
The man was in his element, completely in control and focused on his task.
Harry grumbled out an annoyed sound, but continued tending to him.
Draco watched, eyes half lidded and mouth open in a soft moan, as Potter began to tie his thighs to his calves, leaving him forced open in a frogtie, exposed.
, when the sound of a door opening drew his attention.
Harry stared at Draco, feeling the tension in the room escalating.
Draco watched, keen eyed and trying to be as thorough as possible in his observations (for future Pensive use), as Potter shoved himself back into his clothing.
when stimulated.
the egg out.
With a great, heaving breath, oxygen finally flooded his lungs, and Draco let himself float for a moment, just breathing, his gills fluttering softly.
Draco allowed Harry to take the lead as he led them towards the Welcome Witch’s desk, and asked after his own personal Healer.
“Of course, and I brew it myself, so I know it is effective.” Draco said, defensive, eyes narrowing in challenge.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Red to stop the current activity, yellow for pause and check in before proceeding, green for all clear.”
them, not the way he really wanted to let loose, not for his own pleasure.
Harry leaned forward, releasing Draco’s legs but muscling his own tail between them, grabbing at his mate’s wrist to pull away his hands, kissing all over his pinked cheeks.
“Let’s get you settled, little one.” Harry murmured, pulling back from their kiss. “Gunna make sure you feel so good, baby, get you nice and relaxed.”
on something as he came. He let out a frustrated moan, and worked his clit harder, determined to come again first and then try to deal with that problem.
Especially Potter.
The Healer nodded, flipping through a few additional spells, all of them incomprehensible to Draco. “It is very viable so far, but you must know that male veela pregnancies are challenging, and require a great deal of care, as well as magical intervention from the father. Should you want to keep it, that is.”
I had the next and final chapter ready to go as a nice wrap up of the plot and ‘what happens next,’ but I’d skipped over some plans for further sex scenes as I was writing it.
It had been one thing when Harry had only had to see the git infrequently in the halls of the Ministry or at various functions and society events, but then he’d started getting friendly with Hermione, a fellow champion of legislative changes in the Department of Magical Creatures, and Luna, who brought him as her plus one to basically every friendly event she attended with their group, giving Draco the chance to prove to them all that he was no longer a complete bastard (and was perhaps even the slightest bit likeable, in a prickly, sarcastic kind of way).
Harry felt like he could be in love already, despite having just met his mate.
“You taste so fuckin’ good, baby.” Potter slurred, tongue thick in his mouth. “I love your sweet little cock. Gunna make you come again.”
“I’ll have to make it up to you.”
“You look - “ Hermione’s eyes flicked from Draco’s stomach to peer at Harry, her gaze as sharp and discerning as ever. “Oh
Even if he couldn’t fit his prick in anyone, he had learned to get his rocks off by doing everything just shy of fucking his subs.
Harry gave him a puzzled look, and the older man clarified; “This is better than foreplay.”
There is a good amount of plot in this chapter as well, and you will finally learn about the curse of the Beastly Mermaid and his Little Beauty.
Potter huffed a laugh, leaning in to kiss him gently, tongue licking soothingly against his own for a moment, before letting Draco suck on it, moaning.

so that he wouldn’t bungle the whole case when he was called on to testify.
right, but you. Oh Draco, you were so perfect last night; the scent of your blood, your
“And you’ll let me come and go freely to visit my grandchild.”
Draco panted, grey eyes full of disbelief, his whole body thrumming with the echoes of his pleasure as his orgasm washed through him.
Sirius, the dog star, which Harry’s godfather had been named after. Draco’s own constellation. Andromeda, who was Draco’s own aunt, who looked after Harry’s godson. Countless others, like Scorpius, Orion, Ursa Major, every star in the sky, mapped and historied.
“I can do a fair bit more than a toy, so you might still end up finding it disappointing.” Harry chided. “Can’t find a toy that can eat your arse til you cry, can you?”
Finally, the man pulled back, his lips as red and wet as ever as he grinned up at Draco, who could barely keep his eyes open, his whole body shuddering with the aftershocks.
‘He was basically homeless, though he spent all of his nights in the sea as a mermaid. We helped him get access to his vaults to buy a house. And we got him access to a Muggle bank card, so he can support himself better.
As Draco’s cries reached a peak, Harry felt the smaller man come, the pressure on his mate’s sweet spots too much, and the slick inside of him ramping all of the sensations up. Harry finally pulled his cock back, sliding the slick red length of it out of Draco’s now swollen hole, leaving it reddened and leaking slick.
“You taste- “ Potter sounded bewildered, desperate, furiously needy. “You’re slicking up for me. You’re so fucking
, his cunt a fluttering, leaking mess between his legs as it clenched up around nothing.
Harry’s eyes softened, his laughter fading, his heart feeling full. “Yeah...yeah, they really are.”
“You already taste so fucking good.” Potter growled into his mouth, before licking back in, all tongue and teeth and dominance. “I can’t wait to taste the rest of you.”
Draco, however, looked nearly frosty with displeasure, and Harry went to him, glad that his mate didn’t shy from the possessive touch that he laid on his lower back, urging his mate to sit with him on the couch.
“Nah, thanks though mate.” Neville said, looking genuinely apologetic. “It’ll be during the first week of school starting back up while the Thistle are in bloom, so definitely not the best time to try to get away.”
.” Draco cut in, going pink with a blush. “Y-you don’t need to
Still sucking eagerly, Harry swallowed it down hungrily, his own cock leaking so much precum he thought he would burst just at the taste, at his mate’s little whimpers of overstimulation.
“Yes.” Harry said. It was simple, a fundamental truth.
“How is he, ‘Mione?” Harry asked, brows furrowed in worry. “Is he alright? I didn’t hurt him, did I?”
Draco stared at his own hand as he reached out to pluck the first Thistle, eyes widening at the sight of his elongated fingernails, and the webbing now spread between his long, pale fingers.
smells so perfect.”
Her discerning brown gaze swept over to Draco, eyeing him with curiosity.
Everything about his transformed body seemed amped up, and the pleasure that coursed through him as he began slowly working over his clit with tight little circles of his fingers against the swollen sweet spot was well beyond anything he’d felt in any other bodies before.
Still frowning and lost in his thoughts, he finally looked back up towards the front of the club where Beckett was just returning.
career changes since graduating Hogwarts.
He and his mother had moved to one of the Black family’s properties outside of Paris, and as part of his parole, Draco was charged to enroll in one of France’s Muggle-Education-Bridging-Programmes, while simultaneously re-writing his N.E.W.T.S by correspondence through Beauxbatons.
“So pretty for me. Took it so well.” Draco let out a sigh of satisfaction as Potter began to touch him again, running his big hands over Draco’s lightly heaving flanks. “Do you like it, baby?”
Harry’s mate was absolutely perfect for him in every way; Draco’s body so ready for his touch. He couldn’t wait to see if Draco could match Harry’s ultra-high libido; to see how often he could make his mate come over the course of a single day.
In scarcely a moment, they were ushered into a room, and told they would only need to wait a few minutes for Healer Preeti Shivpuri to arrive.
Draco’s sweet little cock had become a favourite place for Harry’s clasper to lavish its attentions. Harry had spent the previous few nights playing with his mate’s cock, working and stretching it open with his clasper, trying to fit as much as he could inside of the tight little slit. With time, he hoped he could open Draco enough there to get all the way down inside of him, to be able to play with his mate’s prostate from the inside.
beaters. That had made global headlines, as his teammate had managed to effectively out the Boy Who Lived as the
Ron laughed, walking away to sit down in a chair in the waiting room, and Harry was overjoyed to have his best friend with him to laugh at him at his lowest moments.
“Merlin, I can’t wait to taste your sweet little cock.” Harry breathed. “I’m sorry I didn’t suck you, last night. Though I think you might’ve liked it if I tried - you seemed to really enjoy my teeth.”
Always watching him, undoubtedly suspicious and waiting for even the smallest mistake.
Experimenting with styles and fashions he had never conceived could be possible became a favourite hobby of his, and nearly every time he walked out of his flat, people stared at him; at his bright red lipstick, paired with his slouchy tailored suit draping over his lean frame, paired with the sharply pointed toes of his newest pair of Louboutin heels.
Draco had been settled into a comfy lounge chair with pillows stuck in various strategic places behind his back and under his arse, out on the deck overlooking the sun-bright sea. Waves caught the light, glittering and flashing, gulls cried out overhead, and the air smelled fresh and briny.
“My name’s Harry. Harry Potter.” He said, politely, and Neville goggled at him, then at his hand.
“Thank you for summoning me.” She replied. “And for bringing Draco here. I am glad he will have access to some experts to assist with his delivery.”
“God, you’re perfect.” Potter groaned, giving him an exultant kiss. “I knew you’d like it, but
Suddenly feeling lightheaded, Draco arched into the touch, a keen building in the back of his throat at Potter’s heavy, reverent touches. His scars had always been sensitive, but seemingly at the beck of their master, they came alive, feeling like little arcs of sensation. He gasped as Potter leaned down, sucking at a mark that trailed up over his collarbone, laving his tongue thick and hot over the sensitive line.
Draco gasped, a pained whimper crossing his lips at the wrenching feeling that pooled in his stomach, making it clench.
everything was; the light of the full moon shimmered down through the surface of the sea, scattering little glimmers of silver against the waves, trailing down in beams through the shimmering water below.
His pecs
“As if I would let someone-!”
The other man’s eyes fluttered shut. “I- I’m not sure. It’s thick, maybe 2 inches in diameter?”

“Oh!”
He only knew that he felt the burning need to impress her.
last night, and you
Harry looked bemused, and then his eyes flicked down, likely fixing on the spot where Draco could feel a dull throb along the base of his neck.
The Herbology Professor nodded eagerly. “I look forward to it. I hope you have a great trip, Draco - and watch out for any mermaids; they’re very territorial!”
“It will have to do.” Draco replied, looking over the jar in his hands, just barely able to make out the shifting masses of the gillyweed bundles suspended in pond-water inside. “All of my normal suppliers are completely out.”
At Harry’s look, he rolled his eyes, and offered instead; “Alright, it was fantastic, the best sex of my life, but
, okay, that’s perfect.” Harry noted, feeling his cock throb.
, Potter.” He griped, wiggling further into the warmth of his body, finding the ache in his arse surprisingly pleasant. He clenched again, and felt a gush of warmth fill him. “Now hush, and keep petting me.”
He was getting
Biting his lip and looking unsure, Draco allowed himself to be led into the small pool inside of the grotto, a space that had grown familiar over the last week, as he had joined Harry there nightly.
Malfoy groaned, but managed to pull his hand away from between his legs, and glared up at Harry through heavy lids, cheeks flush and chest positively heaving.
Potter didn’t pull back, didn’t so much as move his head, merely held Draco in his mouth and
inside of him, so hot and thick and alive. Better than anything he had ever felt.
Flipping his fringe back with a haughty toss of his head, Malfoy crossed his arms before him, bringing Harry’s gaze back down to the nearly invisible peaks of his nipples behind his sheer shirt. “And what are you going to do about that, Potter? Take me over your knee and spank me?”
Draco moaned as Potter began kissing his way down his neck, interspersing sharp nips and meaty bites with long, wet sucking against his pale skin, marking him up.
“Knew these would taste so good.” Potter groaned, descending on the other one to give it the same treatment, mouth sloppy and hungry, like a man starved.
“Potter.” Draco hissed, squeezing at his hand. “Stop showing off and make them get your thrice cursed spawn
He knew Ron was mated to Hermione, and that they had a child of their own, but that only just managed to calm him.
. I could smell you from miles away - your blood, at first. That was tasty enough, but then - oh
“Shut it.”
“How is the temperature? Does it feel alright? Not too hot?” He asked, desperate to please his mate.
And so, Narcissa comes to visit their small seaside cottage.
“Introductions?”
Harry pouted, but he stood, reaching for a bar of soap, eager enough to get his hands all over his mate’s flushed, pale skin.
Naked, Draco strode into his ensuite, turning on the shower and stepping in, groaning at the lovely heat against his tired and overused muscles. Potter was quick to join him, allowing Draco to hog all of the spray, and taking up the soap when the blond passed it to him.
But he was helpless, tied wide open as Potter brought those big hands up to cup his cheeks, spreading them open, exposing his hole to that sharp green gaze.
Hermione looked far away, brown eyes shimmering with sadness. “He didn’t remember either of us, when we found him. We had to work to become his friends again. He trusts us now, and let us into his life, just a bit, but he doesn’t
Harry hummed in agreement, kneeling now to soap up Draco’s legs, one hand working over his cock, still soft and sensitive. Draco put a hand on the man’s broad shoulder, feeling weak at the knees.
Magic crackled between them as they kissed, their mouths moving violently together, and Draco was overwhelmed with the taste of that sharp
“Come on, baby.” He cooed, taking Draco’s hand and leading him into the water. “Let me take care of you. Gunna make you feel so good.”
The wizard manning the Welcome Desk at St. Mungo’s looked like he’d just borne witness to the second coming of Christ as Harry strode in, holding Draco in his arms.
make me come more.”
like Harry needed to bend him over his small, cramped desk and eat his arse out until he came.
“Can’t help it.” Harry croaked out, pulling back and smiling up at his mate. “You taste too good. Wanna taste more of you -”
“A great lot of work for a potioneer to go through. I really hope it’s worth it for you, Draco.” Neville said earnestly, still with a bit of worry in his tone.
“Actually, I... lost a bit of control, earlier, uh -”
Molly pulled him into a furious hug, and Harry felt tears well in his eyes at the familiar sight and scent of her. He buried his face in her red hair, just breathing for a moment.
Draco reveled in how those green eyes looked at him, solely focused on him, on how to mark Draco further, on how to mold his limbs into exactly what he wanted.
Done with it all, Harry had eventually elected to try the more anonymous route in Muggle London. It was there, over the last 5 years, and with the help of Beckett, that he had finally found an outlet; a place where he could let loose, and feel comfortable in his own skin.
“Congratulations, Harry.” Hermione said, her own eyes filled with warmth and love. “You and Draco have two, healthy babies. A boy and a girl.”
With only the head of his cock still in Potter’s mouth, Draco was woefully under stimulated, but with the constant battery of that slick muscle against the very tip, Draco was helpless.
“I think that’s enough.”
As a male Veela, he was still in possession of a prostate, which was easy enough to stimulate, but there was another spot,
“Right. Right. Well.” Harry stuttered. “We need Hermione. Fuck,
“Merlin, you’re so tight, milking me so good baby. You just keep coming on my cock, squeezing me over and over.” Harry murmured. “You that desperate for my come? Ready for me to breed this sweet cunt of yours?”
Harry had managed to clean their little area up (with a liberal, surreptitious use of a powerful cleaning charm), and had packed his rope back into his gym bag, by the time Draco had slipped back into his Louboutins.
Harry couldn’t help but lean down to place a series of reverent kisses against that taut flesh, worshiping Draco’s pale skin, shifting to kneel up slightly so he could place both of his palms against his mate’s belly.
“Harry...” Came a breathy voice above him, and Harry blinked up, lips still pressed in a kiss just above Draco’s bellybutton. His breath caught as he looked up into Draco’s bright silver eyes.
“She overheard the call to bring her mum in, and demanded to come along to see Draco. She’s half in love with the git, I swear.”
. I love you
Angling to look beyond Narcissa, Harry blinked as he caught sight of Pansy Parkinson rapidly approaching their small group, flanked on either side by Ginny and Luna.
And they lived happily, ever after.
He wished now he had thought to bring along some toys, a thick dildo, a plug or two, and his favourite; anal beads. He loved stuffing his arse full, and the thought of being able to stuff himself even more completely, cunt
“F-feels -” Draco croaked out. “Feels... like t-too much. Never been so - so
Then he snuggled into his bed with his mate, and slept out the morning.
Blinking his eyes open, Draco was amazed at how
He cried, aching and needy.
Harry kissed along the other side of Draco’s belly, his opposite cheek brushing the man’s pretty pink cock, smearing the pearly bit of fluid on the tip against his tanned skin.
Potter stared at him, hard eyes assessing. Nearly his whole face was wet, his beard drenched, his nostrils flaring. He stared at Draco for a long, searching moment, and then looked back down at where most of his hand was buried in Draco’s arse, dripping with slick.
Harry accepted it with the appropriate level of awe, his mouth parted slightly. “Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy.”
Potter had eventually become a freelance Curse Breaker, and had given up on portraying any sort of image that might please society. Most of the jobs he took were outside of England, so it was months after Draco had returned home before he’d even had a chance to see the man again.
“You can say no, Malfoy.” Harry prompted. “I won’t bring it up again, if that’s not something you like; I’m sorry, I-”
“Thank you so much for coming so soon, Granger.” Draco said, polite and cordial, as though the woman had arrived just in time for tea. There was a hint of sarcasm in the man’s tone, and Harry felt amusement course through him at his mate’s cool attitude, his unflappable calm and humour in such a fraught situation.
Potter was fucking him. His tongue was easing further and further into him, slippery wet, hot, demanding.
is happening?”
think about putting your mouth back down there!”
, that’s so
He made a long, guttural noise as Potter’s lips fixed tight around his hole, sucking, a lewd, wet noise emitting from the other man as he hungrily dived in.
Malfoy huffed a laugh, running a hand through his hair and ruffling it into a slightly disheveled state. He was beginning to look more and more desperate.
“Gunna fuck you now, baby.” Potter rumbled, pulling back from where he had draped himself over Draco’s back. He let his cock lay against Draco’s lower back, letting his precum pool in the dip of his spine. “You look so small under me, sweetheart. I don’t know if your arse will be able to take it.”
make it halfway  - the widest point, before swallowing it back up again, the egg disappearing into his hungry hole.
Harry. You’ve been under a curse, that much is obvious, and Hermione had alluded to it, but is it... broken now? You’re human again, but - was that the cure for it? You just needed to... to breed me?”
Draco arched hard as he came, moaning long and low as he continued to work his clit through it, coming and coming and
Silvery grey eyes widened, and Draco’s mouth dropped open as Harry opened the palm of his hand, holding it up towards his mate, who stared down at the two rings there, one silver and red, the other gold and green.
Harry had tasted his mate again, licking between his legs, sucking cum from Draco’s cock and lapping up slick from his cunt. Draco had enjoyed a careful blowjob with Harry’s dangerous mouth wrapped around his prick just as much as Harry had guessed he would.
Another finger entered him with a squelch, and it happened again. Draco screamed as he came, not from his cock, but from his hole.
he texted back, one hand still squeezing the base of his cock as it twitched and grew.
Draco wanted to cover himself up, suddenly, wrap himself in the limited protection of his shirt again, but suddenly Potter’s hands were there, hot and demanding, one cupping the slight dip of his waist, the other fully cupping one of his pecks, his thick thumbs finding the lines of two of his largest scars, tracing them reverently.
, ah -”
It had been a week since Harry had filled Draco with his clutch, and Hermione had advised, quietly just before she left, that two of Draco’s eggs looked ready to come out; no longer viable, and his body needing more space inside as the other eggs continued to grow.
Harry Potter had been cursed, and Draco was willing to do whatever it took for even the slightest chance that he might be able to help, and get a second chance with the man.
Draco smiled languidly at the dark haired man, finding himself nodding. “It’s... nice.”
Neville was already nodding, but then his vision trailed down to Draco’s midsection, where he must have obviously felt the concealed bump when he’d hugged Draco, and at the arm looped into Harry’s, and up to Harry’s still glowering, possessive face.
Neville laughed. “No, of course. I wouldn’t have expected anything else.”
Draco was sobbing again, desperate, his hole spasming around Harry’s massive, heavy cock, the muscle fluttering as he came and gasped, trying to milk out the come he wanted so bad.
With one last glance at the map and a navigation charm to check that he had the right spot, Draco reached for the jar of gillyweed.
“Oh fuck.” He gasped, “Oh
“Shh, shh.” Harry cooed, bringing his hands up to take a firm hold of the meat of Draco’s slim thighs, easily muscling them open again as Harry pulled his head back slightly, his dark gaze flicking over the overwhelmed, disbelieving look on his mate’s face, and then back down to stare at his cunt.
“I’ll take that as a compliment then, shall I?” Harry asked, and grinned knowingly as Beckett looked him over, gaze heavy as it traced over the tight, white henley that contrasted so nicely with his dark skin tone, and clung to the thick muscles of his shoulders, chest, and back. That, coupled with a pair of well-worn dragon-hide trousers that cupped the sizeable bulge at his crotch, and melded against the muscles of his thighs served as a simple yet effective outfit for when he wanted to impress and draw in potential subs.
“What’ve you done this time, boy?” The woman demanded, and Draco was immediately won over.
“Just a bit?”
Harry had grabbed the man and pulled him away, pressing his wand subtly but threateningly into the man’s gut as he snarled into his face. “Don’t. Touch. Him.”
Malfoy nodded, uncrossing his arms as the Healer aimed her wand at him again, this time directly at his abdomen.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open, his gaze hazy, like he’d been drugged. He smiled up at Harry, his expression punchdrunk.

deign to even look at him in any sort of positive light.
Harry felt himself untense, his muscles relaxing just slightly. He was happy to count this woman as his friend, and was glad that she was apparently his mate’s friend as well.
He’d done it before, probably too often, but he was mostly learning to control his instincts.
“Excellent, thank you again.” Draco interrupted, and then curled a finger at Harry, making his way out of the room. “Come along now, Potter.”
“Fuck me.” Harry breathed, groaning low as his cock perked up immediately. He was already beginning to catch Malfoy’s scent, though the man was now stalled in his progress, clearly interested in getting an explanation from Beckett about the St. Andrew’s Cross, which was currently in use.

“Blimey, look at the size of -” Ron cut off as Hermione shot him a
A week passed quickly like this, but Draco was determined to change up the status quo of Harry’s home, as promised.
“Oh sweetheart, you want me to knock you up? Want me to fill you so full of come that you’re dripping for days? Think I can get you pregnant with just one load, or will I need to keep breeding you all night?”
And then he’d enrolled in a concurrent Potions Apprenticeship in France’s
“Now, before I tell you exactly what I’m going to do to you, and get your consent, is there anything else that you want? Anything you want to try, equipment? Anything else to avoid?”
Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, hands gripping the armrest of his chair so hard that the wood creaked. He took in a few deep, steadying breaths, and tried to get himself under control. He was a dom here, he was in control; absolute, complete, control.
Neville had somehow become a close friend of Draco’s in the past few years, and in fact, had been one of the first of the group to welcome Draco into their fold, after Luna’s first daring steps to reintroduce him to society when he’d come back to England to start his new career.
” The man groaned, turning and running his fingers down through his hair.
If his dates weren’t an immediate failure due to how disgustingly hero-worshipping the person was, things inevitably didn’t work out because of Harry’s cock being too big.
He came, sobbing, and Potter rubbed his thumb back and forth over his oozing slit, then lapped the dripping liquid off of his own hand, green eyes staring, greedy as Draco lay there, exhausted gaze caught.
“I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean.” He shot back, spreading his legs wider, drawing Malfoy’s eyes back down. “You’ll have to be more clear; there are a lot of rumours.”
With a flare of power, Harry drew out his wand, the wards around his house redoubling, tripling in potency. Anti-apparition wards, protection spells, repelling charms; everything he could think of to keep his mate safe - to keep his mate
Draco wanted to scream.
“We only had sex
“You are
“You’d have to ask me nicely for that, Malfoy.” Harry replied, leaning back in his seat, ready to take back the upperhand.
Though Harry was pleased to have it be incredibly obvious that his mate would never, ever deign to touch Ron, he certainly didn’t appreciate Ron’s tone.
“I admit it has it’s uses, occasionally.” Harry admitted, “Though most of the time it drives me up the wall.”
It was-
“I saw... in my research, and over there, when I came into the club...” Malfoy paused, biting his lip, clearly hesitant.
“Look at you. Dressed up all nice for once.” Beckett teased, his warm brown eyes crinkling up at the corners as he assessed the younger man. “I tell you I have a little surprise, and finally that makes you put in some effort?”
“Of course.” Draco ground out, teeth clenching, worry building in his gut.
Harry smirked, looking over at the redhead. “I thought she was supposed to be asleep by now.”
“Draco... “ Harry started, feeling courage he didn’t know he had filling him. “I have been falling in love with you more and more every day since we met. I know what we had before might have been... complicated, but what I feel for you now - it is beyond anything I think I could ever feel for another person. I am so in love with you that I’m mad with it. I know I could never hope to live without you by my side, so...
A spot that made Draco fairly squirm with embarrassment, and a spot that he could only just barely reach with his favourite toy.
“You’ll need to start renovations on Grimmauld place, of course.” Draco noted, unbuttoning his shirt as he went. “It’s still so ghastly, and I’m not surprised you moved out last year, but it
Suddenly, the needless luxury of Harry’s bathroom finally served a purpose, and Harry beamed with pride as Draco let out a pleased noise at the sight of the massive walk-in glass shower. There was a huge soaker tub as well, sitting under a window that overlooked the sea, and Draco seemed to eye it hungrily, before instead heading toward the shower.
That had led him to several incredibly disappointing and depressing liaisons. More often than not when he picked up a Wizard, they were cruel to him, eager to fuck and degrade a former Death Eater, or invaribly turned mean when they couldn’t stop themselves from coming too quickly when fucking him, calling him a slag or whore, defensive and angry about their lackluster performance.
.” The man gasped, his cock bursting out another trail of precum over Harry’s tongue as he sucked the whole length of Draco’s prick into his mouth. “Oh
“Very well.” Draco said breezily, though he was looking slightly red with embarrassment. “Thank you again for your help with this, Hermione. I really don’t know how we’d get on without your assistance. I’m very grateful.”
The distraction lasted only a moment, before Potter pulled back, eyes lit with even more determination as he looked at the rest of Draco’s clothing. Suddenly, he went to his knees before Draco, who’s cock immediately twitched and leaked, eager at the sight.
He was dressed in a light linen suit, his long hair left loose around his shoulders, the silvery blond locks tousled by the warm evening wind.
“I - I can feel them moving around inside of me.” Draco gasped between moans, one hand pressed tight against his stomach, the other clutched in a vice-like grip in Harry’s hair. “Oh

“As lovely as that sounds,” Harry agreed, “I’m what the BDSM community calls a ‘service top’ or ‘gentle dom.’ What really gets me off is getting my

I’ll fuck you.”
“Perfect, yeah - absolutely.” Harry praised, happy with Malfoy getting into the meat of his limits. “I’m not sure if Beckett mentioned, but I’m not that kind of dom at all. I’m not into pain play in any significant sense, and I’m not a true sadist. I would never try to beat you or inflict any significant pain. The furthest I tend to go is some paddling and flogging, but we don’t have to explore that at all today.”
Harry snarled, angered by the very word. “I might not remember much about my past, but I

now; I’ll have all the time in the world to get to know you. And I’m always human in the daytime.”
Harry blinked up at her as she rose to tower over him, all regally controlled fury. Draco looked at him pleadingly, but Harry nodded, and stood as well, heading to the door.

finished, how can that even be
Harry stopped unpacking as she straightened up, casting done, and gave her diagnosis.
With that thought motivating him, Draco sat up and pushed off the ground below him, gliding back up through the water.
He drummed his fingers against the battered leather on the arm of his chair, taking a moment to wonder at how unlikely this would be to work out. Over the past 5 years, he had managed to squeeze his cock into a few apparent “size queens,” but had never managed to actually
Harry dutifully kicked off his shoes, following at Draco’s heels as he made his way to his bedroom, talking all the while.
“Well, if you’re asking so very nicely.” Draco drawled, sliding a hand into Harry’s messy hair. “Who am I to deny a man on his knees.”
Harry’s heart pounded as Draco smiled up at him, and Harry rushed away to the kitchen, waving his hand to wandlessly start cleaning off the table, the dishes rising and being magically scrubbed clean, clattering softly as they sorted themselves into the cupboards.
Handling the thorny stalks proved to be a challenge, so Draco found himself going back and forth, to and from the boat, carefully storing the Thistle in a prepared jar, which he had filled with seawater to suspend them in.
Harry laughed, an easy, carefree sound, and wrapped him up in his stupidly muscled arms, which were now bare. “You love it, Malfoy. You can’t deny it, not after you came so hard that you started getting slick like a girl while I was eating you out.”
“I might have said I’m surprised by this turn of events, but then I would be lying.” Came the posh drawl that Harry was so familiar with after having known the other man for 13 years. He let his eyes open, green meeting silvery grey as Malfoy smirked at him.
‘Will you marry me, Draco?”
“I did some more research on Mermaid pregnancies, and unfortunately there is not much information on the saltwater variety, as they have been criminally understudied due to poor race-relations -”
To say Harry was eager to get his mate fully back into the water, to watch as Draco attempted to push out his first couple of eggs, was an understatement.
He was stopped from proceeding with his plan of touching every inch of Draco’s skin, when his mate grabbed at his wrist.
Draco truly felt repentant, and was determined to show that. He wanted to prove Potter right.
“Malfoy, really I’m so sorry about this, I -” Harry started again, the moment the door shut behind her, coming forward to hover over Draco like an anxious mother hen.
His mate cried, moaning and keening as the slick appendage worked up into his cunt, squeezing in alongside of the eggs still tucked up in there. “Feels so
Struggling and shoving at the other man’s stupid, muscley arms and chest, Draco found himself pinned, staring up into bright, happy green eyes and a sharp, crooked smile.

big cocks.
“You’re still so loose, baby.” The bastard cooed, having shuffled down along Draco’s back, one big hand on his still red arse cheek, holding him open to look. “You used to be so tight and pink, and now you’re all red and fucked out and -”
“You’re mine. My mate. No one else can touch you.” Harry explained, feeling frustrated. “And this is my territory. I can keep you safe here. You can’t leave.”
“P-potter, you’re absolutely filthy -” Malfoy moaned, chest still heaving, his legs squeezing tight together, hand pressing down to grind the heel of his palm against his cock.
“P-please,” Draco whispered. “
He sent out a quick Patronus to his future mother-in-law (what a thought), and settled in beside Ron, listening to Rosie as she peppered him with questions about the birthing process.
“Which leads me to the other important aspect to discuss; what are your preferences? Have you ever tried anything kinky? Does anything spark your interest in particular?”
Potter had then turned back to Hogwarts, apparently looking to try out the quiet life, hidden within the castle’s familiar walls, finally away from the public eye. And sure, he had the skillset to be an excellent teacher, but he had never had to deal with
“Forgive me if I fail to believe -”
All of them, man or woman, invariably, even with advance warning, looked at him like he was a freak after they saw him fully erect-- even the ones who said they
“Sounds too good to be true, if I’m honest.” Harry quipped, giving Beckett a disbelieving stare. “I’m never
“Right, of course.” Draco said sarcastically. “Always human during the daytime. So you’ll be a mermaid again tonight, I expect.”
Turning up his long front drive, Harry’s gait slowed into a light, loose limbed jog, before he stopped entirely in front of the door to his house. Light speckled through the trees surrounding the small cottage.
“H-Harry, fuck. Ngh, too much.” Draco whined, shoving at his head, his other hand coming down to bury into Harry’s hair, trying to pull him back. “Merlin, you’re greedy.”
It was Hermione’s turn to roll her eyes, and she began muttering a series of spells, her wand flicking and swooping in a blur.
“You’re lucky I like you mouthy, Malfoy.” Potter crooned, leaning in to drag his nose up the column of Draco’s neck, breathing deeply, practically panting into his skin. “It’ll be so satisfying when I fuck the posh right out of you.”
it, and hence why I have to go pick it
“Awfully presumptuous of you.” Harry drawled, affecting a tone similar to one Malfoy himself tended to use. “I’m not just some renter to book by the hour, Malfoy.”
“Well I am certainly glad you finally decided to invite me to visit.” Narcissa looked about the room, and Harry felt like the space was definitely not passing muster. Their little cottage looked homey, yes, but was getting a bit cluttered. It looked a bit small, now that Harry was really considering it. “It’s quite a quaint little home. How long do you intend to stay? Don’t you think you’ll be needing a bit more room, rather soon?”
Draco
And then he squeezed it in.
“You’re so fucking beautiful, sweetheart.” Harry crooned, swimming closer to his mate, pulling him into his arms so that he could kiss him, deep and demanding. He brought a hand down to cup over Draco’s swollen belly, making the man moan and shift in his arms. “I can feel how much more swollen you’ve gotten in just the past few days. You’re carrying my clutch so well, baby.”
“You’re talking about needing to hash out our limits, kinks, all that?”

The moon was hanging low over the waves as Draco set anchor near the spot where the Mermaid’s Thistle was purported to be. He still had most of the night to complete his task, but he wanted to start as early as possible.
It looked thin and delicate now, and Harry was even more in awe of this gorgeous creature, at how well Draco had taken him.
Ron snorted, and she shot him another warning look.
Draco looked at it curiously as the other man stood and began unwinding a length, beckoning for Draco to move closer to the bench.
Moving into a flat in the heart of Paris with some Muggle roommates had pushed him well outside of his comfort zone, in all of the best ways.
, Potter. That was...
“Draco is a creature who prefers the finer things in life, Mr. Potter. He deserves the world, as you so eloquently put. He has worked hard to overcome the struggles of his past, and was just blossoming into the flower of his youth. He runs his own department, is at the forefront of his field, and commands the admiration of professionals across the world. He has been accepted back into society.
“W-what - what should I do?” Harry asked, wide eyed.
“And veelas are only… receptive, in very specific circumstances.”
Hermione grimaced, shaking her head.
Subsequently, Rosie had been hanging off of Draco almost all night, and it was driving Harry mental.
“We- “ He choked on a breath as Potter stood back up, maneuvering him to wet his hair, before rubbing at his scalp with strong fingers, making Draco moan. “We’ll aim for a late Summer wedding. Before I start showing. But need enough - enough time for Mother and I to start planning. Ngh. P-pastel colour theme.”
Draco had already somehow successfully managed to ingratiate himself with the rest of the group, including Granger and Weasley. For some reason, they all seemed to
Draco cupped both of his hands around the slight swells, palming his tits and squeezing them, a low gasp bursting from his lips at the sweet, soft feeling of them, and how sensitive they were to his touch.
“What’s wrong? What has he done this time?!” He demanded, staring at the Healer.
Potter’s mouth was searingly hot, his teeth sharp and merciless, and his tongue a soothing balm on his tortured flesh. The man bit and licked at the skin all around his pecks until Draco was red and littered with teeth marks across his pale skin, his scars feeling like cold-fire and liquid pleasure, his nipples tight buds of sensation, hot in Potter’s mouth, cold and exposed when not, and sharp with pain as those plucking fingers squeezed and abused them.
“Er -”
off. Disappear for over a year, come back with a secret baby. Wait til mum finds out - “
He cursed, feeling all of his muscles tense up, immediately on edge. His green eyes widened, fixed and staring like he was watching a trainwreck, unable to look away.
He was tempted to ignore it, but just as his urge to run was making his muscles flex in anticipation, so too was the promise that came with those texts making his cock harden in anticipation of
looked at Draco like he was a moment away from attacking him - those intense green eyes full of an animal magnetism of sorts.
flavour that lit Potter up, the wet heat of his tongue, and the flash of metallic blood as their lips caught on each others teeth.
Well, all work and no play did a dull boy make...
“You shut your
“C'est une pleine lune ce soir. Soyez à l'affût des sirènes. Ils ont tendance à être dans une frénésie.” The man cautioned as Draco set up the required charms, the map of where to find the Mermaid’s Thistle pinned down to the console next to the steering wheel and navigation dashboard.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Eloquent as ever Ronald, but thank you.”
With a grin, Draco shimmied his tight pair of swim shorts down and off his legs, leaving him clad in only his wand holster, the extra jar trailing from his ankle, and moonlight as he hung, suspended in water, pale body almost seeming to glow in the serene darkness.
Draco burst into happy laughter, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders, and Harry couldn’t help but kiss his sweetly smiling face.
Draco went rigid, his heartbeat thundering, and he couldn’t stop himself from reaching up a hand to grab for his wand, which the mermaid still had pointed up under his chin.
it.” Draco said, tone brooking no argument, almost offended. “Please book the necessary follow up appointments with whomever you think is most qualified to assist with my pregnancy, and owl me with a list all of the potions I’ll be needing.”
And then his mouth was back on Draco's chest again, sucking with that devastating pressure, and suddenly his hands had moved as well, forefinger and thumb squeezing one of his nipples in a sharp pinch, making him keen.
“Yep.” Harry confirmed, smiling. He was eager to get Draco back into the water with the moonrise.
The blond made a plaintive noise, his eyes shutting as he pressed down against his cock even harder, “Potter, stop -”
And then Draco had spent the next year trying to very, very slowly, win Potter over.
But Harry would forever be grateful for the chance meeting despite the terrible sex, because Beckett had introduced him to a whole new world, one where Harry could fully escape the pressures of being a recognized celebrity and where every potential sexual partner might end up going to the press with stories about the Saviour’s sex life.
“I need to call Hermione.” Draco said with a sigh, running a hand through his hair. He grimaced, and began undoing his messy braid, apparently displeased with how it had gotten so mussed and tangled during the night. “I wonder how soon she would be able to get here. She
“I was able to learn that they tend to only have 1-2 viable offspring out of any clutch, and that the eggs end up sort of, well, competing, in the womb. The most viable few will feed off of the magical energy of others in the same clutch, until only the strongest remain. The eggs will also feed off the magical energy of the bearer, and the bearer’s mate, requiring very close contact between you two over the gestation period as the eggs develop. You may feel a bit of a drain on your magic, especially as you get closer to your due date.
he wanted everything Potter could give him.
Draco
The older man had taken Harry under his wing, acting as a mentor as he had shown Harry the ropes of what it meant to be a Dom; the rules, the techniques, and the inherent privilege in being allowed to take care of a sub. He had also been integral in helping Harry figure out how to deal with his libido, and the challenge of having a cock so massive that he couldn’t actually fuck most of his partners.
“I think -”
He almost hexed the man’s arms off of his body as the bastard immediately rushed towards his mate, pulling Draco into a tight hug right in front of the restaurant where they had planned to meet.
“Now, I desperately need a shower before she arrives. My hair is a disaster, and the salt is drying out my poor skin.” Draco said with a pout, and tried to lever himself up out of the bed.
The rocking motion of their bodies worked Draco up almost as much as Harry’s touch against his cunt, and he was hard again by the time Harry covered him in his cum. They had enough time for Harry to suck Draco off again after they’d dried off, and Draco’s hot gaze promised that he would eagerly be returning the favour, later.
that I’m... pregnant.”
“Potter -” Malfoy breathed, before stopping himself.
All in all, the wizard had been giving him a worried look as Draco cast off from the dock, clearly unimpressed with Draco’s sea-faring abilities, but happy enough to take his Galleons, with an extra-large security deposit.
Harry growled softly at how distressed his mate was starting to look, and he stood up, stalking around the table to pull Draco up into his arms.
Harry was so besotted, that he of course agrees when Draco suggests that they have his mother over to visit.
“You’re aware of the stop light system?”
The man stared at him, then at Draco, and then back at Harry, and Harry sighed.
With a sly grin, Malfoy looked back at Harry, eyes lighting with a mischievous spark. “Oh,
(See the end of the chapter for
The arms wrapped around his chest and his hips were
With a smirk, Harry watched as Draco’s pupil’s dilated, and the heady scent of his arousal, which had just been a faint but prevalent note before, became vibrant, calling urgently to Harry’s senses.

Hermione sighed, shoving back her chair and standing as well, tucking her wand away.
Draco felt himself teetering on the edge of a thought, his vision tunneling, his eyes fixed on the chart in the Healer’s hands. He barely heard Harry making noises resembling questions behind him.
to know anything about his past. It’s like he can’t process anything we tell him.
have him locked away here, like he’s some sort of - of -
“What’s your colour?” Potter asked, pulling away, trailing a line of saliva between their mouths.
He reopened the gillyweed, plucked out another bundle of it, and swallowed it down, eager.
“Harry, what...”
Draco’s thoughts felt staticky, disbelief clouding him.
Harry once again moved to settle between his mate’s legs, back far enough that he had the perfect vantage point. He brought his hands back up to Draco’s cunt, hooking his thumbs in to spread his lips, eyes fixed on the sight of the white shell just within, winking in and out of sight with each flutter of Draco’s hole.
for healing potions!”
The eggs in Draco’s stomach wouldn’t ever become viable in the inhospitable environment, and would end up being used as supplementary nutrients for the rest of the clutch and Draco himself. His mate needed to eat only sparingly, to keep up his broader nutritional needs and to sate his cravings.
Draco seemed to flush, his body clearly warmed by the hot spray. His mate’s sweet little cock was still half hard, and it was making Harry’s mouth water.
Draco felt weirdly docile as Potter gently pulled his bound arms over his head, bent and tied tight over his head at the front of the bench, immobilizing him.
“Oh my -” Hermione gasped, clearly not having expected so many people to be outside. She looked at Harry, concern clear on her face, but he aimed a still-watery smile at her, and gestured for her to share her news.
“Note from Luna? Luna, who did you send notes to?! How did you even know we were here?!”
Beckett had picked one of his favourite seats in the place - a beaten up old leather chesterfield that suited the Scotsman well.
Draco submitted to her tests, quiet and patient, all while Harry was still pacing back and forth, eyes filled with worry as he watched the two of them.
His eyes were shut, but they opened in a flash as he felt Potter’s mouth back on him, trailing down and getting dangerously close to -
“M’not -” Draco gasped, whimpering as he pushed again, his cock jerking between his legs as the egg
There was a low, comforting rumble coming from the warm body spooned up behind him, and strong, talented hands were running along his tender skin.
“I-” Malfoy seemed to falter, eyes taking in the raw hunger on Harry’s face. “I might’ve done more, when I was younger, but-”
The sun was well risen, high in the sky. Its bright rays filtered easily into his little seaside home. He had bought this house specifically, with his new friend Hermione’s help, because he had fallen in love with the massive windows that covered most of the walls.
His mate looked good, comfortable and swollen and tucked up on the couch, a book resting on the bump of his belly.
The familiar sneer on Malfoy’s face almost transported him back to his hotheaded teenaged rage, but he managed to corral himself.
He wanted Potter to look at him with forgiveness in those discerning green eyes. He wanted Potter to accept him for who he had become. He wanted Potter to acknowledge how far Draco had come, and how much he was doing for the integration between Muggle and Wizarding society now.
“Excellent, now where is my wand?”
As the moon rose, and Harry changed into his mermaid form, Draco gingerly placed the little bundle of gillyweed into his mouth, and transformed as well.
“Fine.” He bit out, dragging his fingers out of Draco. “Fine, but we’re talking about this later.”
“Potter, what in
Draco had tried to talk to Harry, to see if they could work through it, together. To see if the other man would be willing to pursue a relationship with Draco, regardless of the vitriol that would continue raining down on their heads from the public.
like he had made progress, like he had finally overcome the weakness of his hateful upbringing.
“No,” Malfoy interrupted, eyes flicking up to catch his, partially obscured by his hair, which was tangled into his long lashes. “I... I want it.”
“Much.” Draco replied, bringing his own hand down to rest over Harry’s, staring down at himself, and then back up at Harry. “Right, so. What the
Draco let his head fall back, appearing to consider. “Ideally, I’d say at least 4-5.”
Working him through it, Harry latched his lips more firmly around Draco’s clit, sucking and humming against it as he pushed Draco over the crest of his orgasm and kept him there, delighting in his mate’s noises of overstimulation as he kept coming against Harry’s mouth, shuddering and twitching through each ensuing peak of pleasure.
“You had some unusually high hormones present in your bloodwork.” The Healer continued, skimming down through the list. “Ones only present in a veela who is actively in a mating cycle.”
“I’m afraid Potter here is very... virile. And likely satisfied some of those… conditions, under which a veela might be receptive.” The Healer deadpanned, and Draco glared at her. Harry was still staring at him, mouth now hanging open. “May I do some additional diagnostics?”
“Of course. Absolutely.” Harry said eagerly. “I love him more than anything else in the world. I want only the best for Draco.”
Harry hissed as Draco clenched, the blond hissing himself at the sharp stretch of his hole.
“Beckett,” Harry greeted with a nod, sitting in a similar chair beside him, feeling immediately comfortable in the dim light of the club, which had become a favourite haunt of his over the past 5 years.
“Of course, Potter.”
He gurgled, still coming, his hole clenching and squeezing around the cock inside of him, out of his mind with pleasure.
At a wave of Harry’s hand, the shower sprung to life, and Harry eagerly gestured the other man in, following and shutting the shower door behind them both.
He moaned as he settled into position, feeling himself leak more slick, ready and eager to be fucked.
“Well, we still don’t know anything about
Draco had missed all this, having skipped out of town, and feared that the larger group would be reluctant to accept a former Death Eater amongst their ranks. He feared the prospect of their judgement, and what it would be like if they found him wanting.
“A lot of what I want to do to you could be considered ‘
well, though he had apparently had a hard go of it over the last 6 years. Nearly every Wizarding paper in Europe had followed the Saviour’s steps since the War, meaning that Draco had been basically invited to continue his obsession with his former classmate.
“Cocky as always, aren’t you, Potter?” Malfoy breathed, trying to control his rapid breathing, his pulse thrumming, visibly fast in the hollow of his pale throat. His blush was growing, but he looked determined, decided. “I suppose you’ll do, then.”
Smirking salaciously up at him, Potter then began to pull at his leggings, peeling the dragon-hide down his hips, exposing his sticky, wet prick, and then the rest of his long, lightly muscled legs.
“Why don’t we get you checked out while Ron and Harry start unpacking some of your things.” Hermione suggested, and Draco appeared torn for a moment.
Draco starts trying to serve his mother tea, but grimaces as he moves forward, clearly hampered by the swell of his stomach. Harry jumps in, managing to splash tea over the side of the little porcelain teacup, and grimaces himself. He sopped up the mess with a napkin, before he hands the cup and saucer to Narcissa.
The Wizengamot had been lenient, ridiculously lenient really, during his sentencing. Draco had spent months in Azkaban awaiting his trial - the Dementors gone, but the prison itself having left Draco a shell of himself.
Harry’s larger cock, the ovipositor, butted up against the bump of his mate’s belly, and he was only slightly forlorn at the fact that he wouldn’t be able to fuck Draco’s sweet cunt or arse for a while yet, stuffed as they were with his eggs.
“That’s a far cry from your earlier allegations.” Harry commented, amused by Malfoy’s supposition of the dichotomy of his character. “And I’m hardly a saint, else I wouldn’t be into this lifestyle at all.”
coming?”
Harry returned an arch look of his own as he watched Malfoy recline comfortably, looking like a prince holding court as he crossed his long, elegant legs, a flash of red confirming Harry’s suspicions about his footwear.
Pansy looked furious.
Narcissa’s eyes softened at that.
They had taken to floating in the calm water of the lagoon at night, gazing up at the stars. Draco was able to point out all of the constellations, and though Harry vaguely remembered some of them, he didn’t know them half as well as his mate did, and he couldn’t have imagined all of the fantastical stories Draco was able to tell.
the sensation of the eggs popping back out, and wanted to make the experience as pleasurable as it could possibly be for his sweet, perfect mate.
“N-no, I - “ Draco’s heart was beating furiously, and he reached out, unthinking, and found Harry eagerly holding his hand, taking the seat next to him and practically pulling Draco into his lap, making soothing noises. “He can stay.”
‘Also, if you could please let Pansy know that I am still alive, as I was supposed to check in with her this morning. I am certain she has been in touch with various authorities to begin a search for me. I was also forced to leave my rented boat and the collected Thistles out on the water, so if you could direct her to please collect that for me. Sorry for the bother.”
It took barely any thought at all to urge his transformed body into action, the familiar motions of swimming magnified into powerful, graceful strokes as he sheered through the water, easy as flying.
“All of it, obviously.” Draco replied, tone deadpan. “I’m going to be stuck out here for who knows how long, incubating Potter’s spawn -”
His breathing was measured, practiced at this point as he was with distance running. He rarely felt winded anymore, even after an hour of exertion nearing his top speed.
Harry arched an eyebrow at him, remaining in his casual seated position as Malfoy uncrossed his long legs, looking like he was about to stand.
He was wearing a pair of heels, of course - and Harry knew
Draco was about to make a comment about Potter’s various worshipping fans, but the door suddenly opened, admitting a no-nonsense looking older witch, who immediately fixed Harry with a withering glare.
Flushing, Draco bit his lip, turning away in embarrassment.
“They - they’re kind of hideous, actually.” Harry choked out, unable to hold in his laugh as Draco scowled up at him, before he, too, burst into laughter, making the twins gurgle at the unexpected motion. “They look a bit like mandrakes.”
And then, of course, came the
He wanked perfunctorily in the shower to thoughts of what he would like to do to Malfoy if he finally let his instincts take over, taking almost no pleasure from an action that had become so routine as to be tedious. On top of all of his other urges that his new instincts had driven wild, the urge to fuck had increased so dramatically that he typically had to bring himself off at least 3-4 times a day.
He gasped as Harry hit something inside of him with the tip of his cock, butting up against
He blushed as Potter began to work the rope between his legs, shoving his thighs apart as he stood, not stopping when an accidental brush against Draco’s cock made him twitch and try to push into Potter’s wandering hands.
And the
“Hullo Harry.” Arthur said, patting his sore shoulder consolingly. “Congratulations, and all that. It’s quite good to see you again, my boy. We missed you dearly. I hope everything is alright?”
he had.
Harry smirked at him, bringing a hand down to curl around the base of his thick and heavy cock, pumping it twice, eyes still locked on Draco’s even as the other man trailed his gaze back down. “As far as I know.”
“But is that your limit? Could you take more than that? Let me take more than that from you?”
Draco had proven every inch the Potion Master he had told Harry he was. His mate was hellbent on brewing his new potion meant to cure dark curses using the Mermaid Thistle that he had originally been in Harry’s territory to collect. Harry spent fascinated hours listening to his mate describe his work, his whole process, how he actually
“... the breeding bench.” The blond whispered, clearly trying for nonchalance, but failing quite spectacularly as he nearly squirmed in his seat.
Harry was simultaneously focused on staring at the oncoming figure, and wondering if he could get away with apparating where he sat, and obliviating the whole club later, when it was safe to come back.
Draco shivered, his cock hardening fully at the thought, twitching and leaking out a little pearl of precum, which Harry lapped up eagerly, grinning.
“God, look at how gorgeous you are.” Harry praised, nosing along the swell of his growing length. “You’re the absolute perfect size, baby. Just big enough to fit in my mouth - so easy to play with. The perfect little cock.”
Harry brought up a hand to press against Draco’s reddened cunt, his fingers able to slip in oh-so-easily into the fucked out, gaping hole.
Draco had done a lot of great work in the field since he had become a full Potions Master, specifically in R&D; forcing a bit of a paradigm shift in how brewing was viewed through a more modern lens. He had studied in France, achieving his Potions Mastery as well as simultaneously completing an undergraduate degree in Muggle Pharmaceutical Sciences. His work in combining the areas of Potionry and Muggle Pharmaceuticals was truly groundbreaking.
He could just make out the glimmer of moonlight on the waves and the shadowy bulk of the hull of his boat, when suddenly his skin prickled, and his senses went on high alert.
He had meant to meet with his friends for their weekly drinking night at the Dancing Dragon, but he wasn’t entirely sure he could handle another sit down in close quarters with so many people in an environment like a pub. In fact, he was strongly considering heading straight back out for another run, followed up by a long weightlifting session at the muggle gym in the next town over that he had a membership with, and just bringing home takeaway for dinner.
Beckett nodded, “I mentioned that I know a bloke with a sizable cock who might happen to have the patience to handle him, and he almost laughed in my face, but seemed interested enough. Then I mentioned he might be interested in the BDSM scene, and he hadn’t heard of it at all. I gave him a brief rundown of the concept, and suggested I might show him around The Griffin, if he wanted to know more, maybe introduce ‘im to you. He did start drilling into me about the legality of the whole thing, but seemed eager enough. Said he’d think on it, and I gave him my mobile number to reach out if he wanted to know more.’
There was a constant wet squelch where their skin met, the hair surrounding Harry’s cock dark with slick, wet and clinging as Draco gushed a constant rush of come around his prick, keeping him slick and easy to fuck, despite Harry’s massive size.
“Holy
. Love when you fill me up with your cum.
Draco felt himself go boneless, his eyes fixed on Potter’s mouth. “
Draco’s mouth went dry, and he shook his head, flushing. “I’m not a
“Yes, yes, of course. I’d love to marry your son.” Harry jumped in, nodding eagerly. He hadn’t thought of it to be honest, as in his mind, they were already mated, their bond consummated under the full moon. But that was a mermaid rite, and the idea of a wizarding marriage appealed to him greatly. A muggle one as well, now that he thought of it.
“Yes, ‘all that,’ Malfoy. It’s pretty damn important. As a dom, I have a responsibility to anyone who subs for me, and I can only offer that if we’ve firmly hashed out the details, and come to an agreement. Especially if I’m going to do what I’m planning to do to you.”
break any of my things. And be careful, there are some dangerous potions ingredients, and -”
Harry felt just as enthralled tonight as he had the very first night that he had seen his mate; those long, pale limbs cradled by the water as Draco floated just below the surface, his silvery hair a beautiful halo around his gorgeous face.
“Potter, hurry
“Hello Draco, hello Harry!” She called, and Harry had to fight down a flare of territorialism at the sight of another male near his mate.
“Er...”
“Shut up, Potter.” Draco interrupted, turning to him, head tilted up, bringing his lips dangerously close to the other man’s, catching those green eyes with a determined look. “Shut up, and deliver on your promises. Unless, of course, you’re all talk?”
His mate was covered in
The headlines in the
“Shove off, mate.” Ron griped, nudging him with his shoulder, chuckling.
If anything, he was still feeling too pent up with energy, even as he approached the end of his run back home from the Ministry. His muscles all felt tight, an itch pushing him to do
Harry though - he was still buoyed by his happiness. His mate had decided to stay with him. His mate, who was safe and healthy, and his clutch, safe and healthy inside of Draco.
“You gunna come in your pants just from the thought of a dirty bit of rough like me besmirching that fabled Malfoy innocence? I bet you were supposed to keep yourself pure until marriage, and here you are, ready to let me, of all people, into that tight little arse.”
Malfoy looked relieved, and then smirked. “Of course Saint Potter could never bring himself to willingly hurt a poor, defenseless person. It would go against all of your holier than thou morals.”
He felt trapped in that look, and then he remembered.
, you’re so wet for me. I can’t wait to lick it all up after I’m done fucking you.”
Draco shivered at the praise, feeling his cock give another feeble twitch. He groaned as Potter leaned down to bestow a sucking kiss to each of his nipples.
As Harry ushered his mate inside, he felt prickly with a flare of possession so strong that he couldn’t help but nearly snarl.
He was still nearly insensate at the feeling as he felt it - Potter’s hungry mouth pressed right up against his hole.
“Oh sweetheart, look at you.” Harry crooned, pulling Draco’s arsecheeks wide so he could watch that fucked out hole struggle. “Such a pretty sight. I need you to push for me now, baby. Wanna see you work it out of your cute little hole.”
Potter had then tried his luck at professional Quidditch, and had managed to lead the Appleby Arrows through to the World Cup, winning it all for England in the course of 2 short years on the team. That had all gone tits up after he had ended up sleeping with one of the team's
“You’re really trying to spin this to be all about me, Potter?” He challenged, tone sultry and accusatory at once. “As though you weren’t just talking about how desperate you were to get on your knees for me? I’d have rather thought that any fantasy scenarios would include you finally putting me in my place. Lord knows you must be eager to get me over your knee, to spank me raw for all of my past transgressions?’
“I understand, Hermione.” He murmured, reaching out to pat her on the hand. “I would have done the same thing. I can’t even imagine what would have happened if it had been leaked to the press.”
“None of that, sweetheart.” Harry reprimanded, taking a firm hold of Draco’s hips and carefully turning his mate over to his hands and knees, making sure he was settled as comfortably as possible in the nest. “You know we need to make more room for the rest of the clutch as they keep growing. You’ll feel better once we get the next one out.
Harry was groaning constantly now, and had fairly collapsed on top of him, rutting in a thunderous rhythm, hips busily working his cock in and out of Draco’s tight heat in a furious rush.
“Well, it should be.” Neville said with a shrug and grin. “But there’ve been some instances where, well, it was a bit more long lasting than the normal gillyweed transformation period.”
Malfoy gave him a challenging look, shifting again in his chair to try and relieve the pressure on his prick.
What followed was a surprisingly methodical and calm process. Potter easily and confidently bound his forearms tight together, always careful and checking to ensure that the rope wasn’t too tight.
Draco sighed again, and pressed a finger over Harry’s mouth, halting his panicked words.
Draco couldn’t help the needy groan that left him as Potter pulled his mouth away, but was pleased when the other man began to swiftly divest him of his clothes.
Hermione gets here?”
Draco had become more swollen of late, more sensitive to Harry’s touch and the slightest of movements, the eggs inside of him jostling and rubbing at him. Harry was overjoyed with his mate’s response to being so full - Draco nearly constantly demanded Harry’s attentions, and Harry found himself on his knees between Draco’s legs over and over throughout the day, providing his mate relief as he sucked his hard cock or licked out his sweet pussy.
But then Draco collapsed back with a sobbing moan, and the egg was sucked back in.
for my cock.”
Harry blinked at him, meeting his mate’s hard gaze and wondering what was wrong, wanting to fix it.
Harry gritted his teeth. He hated hearing about the stupid curse. He’d always thought Hermione was talking a load of tripe, and he’d gotten annoyed everytime she brought it up, until she’d finally stopped during her and Ron’s more recent visits.
His cock hardened, slightly, twitching in Potter’s grasp.
She rubbed at his back, cooing at him. “There, there dear. It’s a big moment, I know. I’m sure there is probably a good reason you’ve been gone for so long, and why you kept this all a secret, but you know I’ll always be here for you, and for Draco and the baby. You are my son, do you hear me?”
“Merlin, this feels
Hermione and Ron have brought Rosie with them, and the little girl is entranced by Draco, who she thinks is a princess. Rosie has apparently always been obsessed with pregnant people, enthralled by the concept that there was a baby inside of their bellies.
me.” Draco pressed, poking a finger into that firm, hard, furry chest.
He screamed, torn between all eclipsing pain and pleasure, and felt his vision white out, his mind overwhelmed, finally.
Which of the four sex scenes do YOU think was the most lewd?
Harry shushed him, patting at his flanks as he leaned forward again, tucking his pelvis against Draco’s arse, and sliding his clasper back inside of the fucked out opening.
Draco shivered, flushing all over at the sight of Potter between his legs, holding him spread open.
“Yes, Harry,
“Er -”
“Thank
“Immature - !” She spluttered. “Who sold you that! It’s not to be used outside of fertility treatments!”
“What?!” Draco demanded, staring down at where her wand was pointing, feeling where Harry had gone tense beside him.
Potter bit you, and there is no known precedence for the knotting, but that will all take some additional research.”
Draco rolled his eyes again, but felt a slightly pleased flutter in his chest at having this man being so plainly worried for him. He tried to suppress the dopey smile that threatened to bubble up from somewhere inside of him, and crossed his arms, huffing.
"Thought this might be right up your alley," Drew said before turning around and busying himself in the kitchen.
“I am
“Why is it so dark?” Drew chuckled, his face gleaming with amusement.
The silver unicorn bowed to its creator before majestically prancing out of the office window and in to the dark night sky. With a soft smile, Drew made his way to the chest that sat in the far corner of the room. After tapping his wand three times on the lid, it creaked open and a large wooden structure arose from the depths. It held an array of weapons varying from guns, to knives, to swords, and even to a crossbow. Drew carefully pulled off three knives, his V42 Stiletto, combat knife and survival knife. Laying them out neatly on his desk, he pushed the weaponry structure down and closed the chest lid.
“I asked if you are okay,” Nymphadora couldn’t help but smile gently at the other. “Are you worried about him?”
year, therefor I will need some of you to devote your time to prepare him for the exam,” he continued after a few seconds. “Severus will be in charge of Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts classes. Minerva will be in charge of Transfiguration classes. Alastor Moody, Kingsley and Nymphadora will rotate training Harry to duel properly. And if anyone else wants to volunteer to help with any other subjects, please let me know now.”
Harry quickly patted down his body, ensuring he had every piece of equipment with him before he left. He turned and opened the door with a nonverbal '
“Correct,” he nodded his head, giving her a genuine smile.
Everyone couldn’t help but laugh, knowing full well that the two sitting next to each other were unaware of how the other felt. It was painstakingly obvious that Ron had feelings for Hermione. The boy blushing even harder the moment she talked with him or touched him in any way. While Hermione’s feelings were a lot more concealed, there were tell-tale signs. For example she would nervously push her hair behind her ear whenever he looked at her. Or smile brightly the second they made eye contact with each other. All of the Weasley siblings knew it was only a matter of time before they got together.
“Ginny likes Harry. Ginny likes Harry. Ginny likes Harry,” both of the twins whispered in a singsong tune.
“Relatively well,” Harry hesitated to answer.
"Hunt for food," the other man sighed, heading back to the couch while Harry stayed where he was. "They still want me to do more training."
Charlie tried his hardest not to laugh from the comment. If it wasn’t for the training he had undergone for years, he definitely would have been roaring with laughter by now. Drew leaned back with a satisfied smirk and looked up at the ceiling upon hearing the running water from the sink.
Majority of the members raised their hands in response. Severus, Minerva, Arthur, and Dodge were the only ones to not raise their hands. Icy blue eyes looked around the room, pleased that they could get the nerve wrecking expedition out of the way sooner rather than later. Hopefully each person stuck to their word about keeping Harry’s re-appearance in the wizarding world secret until a later point and not before this trip.
“I agree, it will raise suspicion,” nodded Kingsley as he quickly shot a look at the passive kid off to the side. “Leave it with me and I will owl everyone instructions on Thursday.”
“Say hi for me,” turning her head to look up at Remus, Nymphadora’s eyes turned from a dull blue to a shining green colour.
“Of course, I’ll be happy to have you stay with me,” said Ginny as she turned her head to smile at Hermione.
“Oh,” Harry simply said, neither surprised nor shocked.
"Success?" a young male asked from his place on the couch, looking at the young man.
“I was not, Sir,” Harry bowed his head as his furious uncle looked at him.
Wind roared loudly in Harry’s ears, the ground a green blur to his eyes as he whizzed passed on his Nimbus 2000. The polished wood gripped tightly in his hands as he travelled at great speed. His body positioned close to the handle to help him swiftly navigate the property. Swivelling skilfully in and out of the tree line, parting the tall grass as he flew through it, running circles around the entire inside edge of the property line. It was refreshing to fly in the cool summer evening air, nothing to disturb his peace high up there. His mind was empty as he slowed down his movement, coming to a stop above the training grounds.
Looking at the young man with hypervigilant eyes, Dumbledore was trying to figure out the next move before it happened. What surprised him was when the brat turned around to look at him. A wide smirk on Harry’s face, making him anxious at what was to come out of his mouth next. His eyes narrowed as he waited in silence, just waiting for whatever headache he would need to fix now.
“Sorry, I’m uncomfortable right now and I can’t control my feelings and emotions as well as when I was younger,” explained Harry, embarrassed at his outburst.
“If anyone is still there, or if word has gotten out that Harry Potter was seen with the Weasley family, then they could easily come back with you,” he explained, many nodding in agreement.
“Part of me felt bad for Mrs. Weasley; her house is already so crowded. And I knew in the back of my mind that no one resides in that place,” he continued, noticing the shift in the conversation’s tone.
Harry stood still until he heard all of them leave. Sighing in frustration, he closed his eyes and erected the wards once more. He took out his broom, threw up the Disillusionment Charm upon himself, and flew out the window without hesitation. If this is how his time here was going to continue, he thinks he’d rather just abandon the entire wizarding world and let them fend for themselves against Voldemort.
Like had happened every night since the bigger pile of lard had purchased the sports car, the father and son duo got in before noisily taking off to run the same route they always did. Harry narrowed in on Petunia, following her movement as she tried to sheepishly waved across the street at the neighbour who had stuck their head out their door. Inadvertently being the very same house on which Harry hid on the roof of, behind the chimney and safely out of view. He watched as Petunia hastily made her way back inside, seeing her settle in on the couch in the living room. The curtains that were wide open showed perfectly what the layout and future looked like within, a helpful advantage he had over them.
“Have any of you been over?” Dumbledore said with a sense of urgency about him.
“Harry, are you there?” a familiar voice spoke into the silent room.
“Why yes, that’s right,” Dumbledore cleared his throat. “Such a long night, I do apologise for that small slip in information.”
The sun was close to setting in the town of Little Wellington in Surrey. While most of the occupants of the small town had gone home and begun to unwind for the evening, in one particular house on Privet Drive, a family of three had just begun to start their rather loud and disruptive nightly routine. Unaware of their obnoxious actions, the obese father and son duo walked out of the house and to the shiny sports car in the driveway.
“Well,” Harry smirked as he held his hands behind his back, knife still in hand, and puffing his chest out proudly. “I can tell you information only I, Harry Potter, would be able to know.”
“Hello, Sorting Hat,” he smiled as he replied.
"No," he begged in a cry, a blush appearing on his cheeks at the ungodly sound that just escaped him. "No, please. I'll do anything. Just let me live."
“Yes,” some of the people involved answered verbally while others nodded.
It was exactly what he thought it was, a Mokeskin pouch. A pouch made from the skin of a Moke, made to store items that only the owner can retrieve once placed inside. He knew it looked small in size, but if it had an Extension Charm placed upon it, it would allow for extra room. Already thinking of all the precious items he could store in there while at Hogwarts. Harry carefully took it in to his own hands. He felt slight uneasy as he felt the cool scales move in his hands as if it was still attached to the animal it was made from. He opened the top that was closed by thick, black drawstring. Peering inside, he saw the inside was lined with a soft, beige leather material. He ran a finger along the soft leather, loving the sensation of it.
“Severus, I watched as she awoke to Vernon holding the knife soaked in her own blood,” sighing, Dumbledore poured a cup of tea for himself. “Perhaps her fear was so great it caused the alarm to activate.”
The wind brushed through his hair and whistled passed his ear as he sped towards the tree line of the property. Harry couldn’t help but laugh. He felt free for the first time in a while. He could do whatever he wanted, go wherever he wanted, be whoever he wanted. He didn’t need to please anyone by engaging in conversations, nor did he have to put on a facade and act nice. The feeling rushing through his veins was once he had missed, a feeling of adrenaline.
What Harry was not expecting was the red faced Dumbledore that stormed out of the house, yelling and barking orders at his little sheeple. He saw Severus Snape follow closely behind, clearly acting as the perfect right hand man for the manipulative Headmaster. He couldn’t make out the exact words that were shouted directly into Severus’s face, but he knew the angry old man had order the Potion’s Professor to check over the mostly unharmed Petunia and Dudley. Oh, how Harry was thoroughly enjoying the chaos he had caused tonight. The random attack clearly throwing Dumbledore off his game and destroying his usual calm composure.
“But Mum!” a tall, lanky, red headed teen whined as he stepped forwards out of the living room.
Before she could utter a single word or make sense of what was happening, the stranger had lifted his wand to point directly at her. Through the daze Petunia was able to put two and two together enough to realise what was going to happen next to her. Utter terror flashed in her eyes before she squeezed them tightly shut. In this moment Petunia Dursley thought she was well and truly about to die. What had she done to deserve this?
“But for us to get Harry accustomed to our ways and prepared for his first year at Hogwarts, I think a trip to Diagon Alley is in order. It would be better for us to go sooner rather than later, as to avoid the busy crowds getting ready for the school year. I’ll need as many Order members in attendance as possible. You’ll be spread out across the place to cover any threats that may occur,” Dumbledore said as his blue eyes scanned the room.
“I think for now, this meeting can be adjourned. We have covered most of the things that were on my agender. I’m sure most of you have things you need to be doing, work to be getting to,” Dumbledore tried to fake a smile to lighten the mood. “Kingsley will be in contact with you all that are helping with the Diagon Alley trip on Thursday. I will be in contact with a few of you throughout the week as well. But thank you all for coming so quickly to this emergency meeting,” he said standing up.
“Indeed. Well I am sure I’ve finally gotten across to Dumbledore that I am a stranger to him. Not that he wanted to play along with that. He referred to me as his boy multiple times throughout the night,” sneered Harry, not able to help the strong emotions now he was in private.
"Firstly I will ensure no one can hear you scream as what I'll be doing will be very, very painful," he continued on as if it was a normal everyday conversation. "Next, I'll start slicing and dicing. I'll make sure I get creative, don't you worry my kind sir. Lastly, once you have gone to sleep like you wanted, I'll lay out all of these photos around you so whoever finds you first understands why this happened. Your
“We had a situation happen not long into the outing,” Kingsley finally spoke up.
"You two should go into business," Harry said as a genuine smile appeared on his face.
“You don’t seem convinced,” Harry mused out loud, crossing one arm across his chest while the other hand stroked his chin in feigned thought, his knife hanging loosely in his grip. “How about I share some of my memories from my childhood. I give permission, for all three of you in fact, to view them in that pensive of yours.”
“I think everyone agrees that Professor Snape is the worst professor at Hogwarts,” said Ron with a scowl on his face. “Even Hermione has come to agree with all of us; she’s a bit of a suck up to all of the professors. Anyway, back to the Dungeon Bat. Oh yeah, that’s one of our nicknames for Professor Snape. He teaches Potions and is Head of Slytherin. I’m sure you can understand why is the worst now.”
The remaining Order members look around the quiet room. They weren’t sure what to do with themselves now that Harry was back home safely and the rest of the supplies were being organised. There was no point in them staying there and continuing to intrude on the small house of the Weasley’s if there was nothing to do. Some Order members begun leaving silently without saying a word, while others thanked Molly for the cup of tea and wished them all the best until the next Order meeting.
“Truce,” Drew said with a smirk. “For now.”
“What do you mean, Arthur?” Dumbledore came around his desk to stand tall in front of the entire Order.
Drew stopped walking and reached in to his thick, grey, furry coat. He pulled out a small, silvery-green pouch just bigger than the size of both his hands combined. The fragile scales it was made out of looked delicate in the sunlight, shining slightly, almost as if they could fall apart at any time. It looked very familiar to Harry, yet he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. The item reminded him of this rare item he had only read about, since they were so hard to get a hold of. He stared at it curiously for a little more until he looked back up at Drew in wonder, finding a smirk firm on the others face..
A dark glimmer flashed in Harry’s green eyes as a smirk settled on his face. His tired mind suddenly awake and thinking of all the things he could do. All of the revenge he could carry out. He would make sure all three of them paid for what they did to him over the period of almost five years. They weren’t family. They weren’t relatives. They were nothing but horrible people that don’t deserve to live. His mind was overtaken by plans of who he would do what to and with what weapons. It would not be long until their suffering would take place. And Harry Potter could simply not wait for that day.
“Of course, Headmaster,” she smiled warmly up at the old man. “Oh, that does remind me. H-Have you told Harry the news?”
Nodding his head as he took over wiping his own face dry, Grayson stepped back and stood close to Tina who he thought as a mother figure. As Harry stood up, the small crowd begun to exchange hand shakes and hugs. Wishing him a safe mission and to behave as much as he could. The last person to say their farewells was Drew. It made sense. He was the one to take in Harry, he was the one to mentor him, he was the one to bring him up all these years. The two men stood there for a few seconds, green eyes staring into brown eyes, both filled with sorrow. Without a word, the two embraced each other in a strong hug. Drew pulled away after a minute and patted the younger on the shoulder.
“Well shit, this is going to be fun,” he rolled his eyes.
“You helped make breakfast?” Hermione asked with raised eyebrows.
Shaking the anger away, desperate to not let his emotions cloud his judgment, he turned his head in time to see Charlie close the front door. Drew pulled down his hoodie in the safety of the house. He nodded at the other before casting a nonverbal
“Since you missed dinner, both of you, you will eat before you, Dragon, have to go back and you, Potter, can get ready for bed,” Snape order, already getting up and setting up the table in preparation of the house elves placing food at the table.
Drew laughed loudly as he stood up, offering a hand for Harry. He took the hand and stood up, stretching his aching muscles from being on the ground for so long. The two walked side by side along the path back to their house. One anxiously thinking about the youngers near future, while the other imagined of all the different ways he could inflict his suffering he felt at the hands of his relatives. The house came in to view shortly and soon enough they were approaching the door. Drew’s hand hesitated on the handle, not turning it, as he looked back at Harry with a serious expression.
“Is that a book, boy?” snarled Vernon harshly as he reached behind the tiny frame and snatched the book from his grasp.
“As I said to Remus yesterday, either I was in a place where the warding was strong, I was around adult wizards for the Trace to never be triggered or the Trace is only placed on underage students when they first go to their wizarding school,” he shared his theories, knowing which was actually true.
The room was filled with a strained silence as green eyes stared down blue eyes. Refusing to move a muscle, he continued to stand in silence as he waited for the Headmaster to continue. However, movement from in front of him caught his attention. Relenting in the stare down with Dumbledore, he looked over to see Minerva make her way towards the chairs with shaky legs. The old lady appearing to be shaken to the core so much so that she could no longer stand. Without a word, he pushed the chair closer to her so she wouldn’t have to walk as far. A weak smile was flung his way, the witch too shy to look into his eyes.
“Harry, I,” Dumbledore cleared his throat and adjusted his tone from annoyed to a controlled calm one. “We need to know where you have been, with who and how much knowledge you know to help you before the school year starts.”
Hearing those words come out of his mouth, Molly felt a wave of sadness run through her body. She knew that the boy was the only hope of getting rid of the Dark Lord, but she didn’t expect the younger to solely focus on that. He was only a kid for merlin’s sake! He should not be focusing on preparing for the fight of his lifetime. Instead he should be focusing on finishing school and living his life to the fullest.
"Three years have passed Albus," she whispered loud enough for everyone to hear. "Three years of nothing. Yet there was no guarantee that was him three years ago. It was a possible sighting from a person we cannot trust. There was no solid evidence it was him!"
One by one, the room slowly emptied. The mood amongst the Order members was one of grim defeat. They had not achieved much of what they had hoped for. Though to some, it was not surprising with the way the Headmaster had managed to deflect the topic off of himself by the end. However, what did take them by surprise was the way he was treating Severus. It was a vindictive side to him they didn't see at all. His old age must be showing off the cracks in his many layers.
