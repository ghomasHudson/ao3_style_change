"But how come you sat on the Death Eater table for breakfast?"
Harry considered.  “More or less.”
Draco looked at him for a moment, then his eyes drifted to the alter behind Harry.  “I don’t know if I want to go.”  He said softly.
Sometimes, Harry reflected, his favourite obsession could be an absolute bitch.
"Hey, Harry." A sixth year Gryffindor greeted him.  "So you get to boss Malfoy around?" He didn't wait for Harry to contradict him, but pressed on.  "Can you make him do tricks, like a pet?"
“This is your fault,” he told Harry, somewhat unfairly to Harry’s mind, and the dogs snarled.
“Why not?” Draco was more confused than ever.
"You're having a nightmare, sweetheart, wake up." Greg murmured so as not to wake anyone else.
"Oh come on, we notice things.  We can see how you look at him."
Harry wandered through to the common room and found Hermione there, and also Pansy Parkinson, who was presumably waiting for the Slytherin boys.  The girls were sitting on opposite sides of the room and ignoring one another.
Zabini whipped around to face them.  “You don’t have to be a Death Eater to want to curse you into a pile of ashes, Weasley.”
Cold horror flooded Harry.  Draco.  He exchanged another, more loaded, glance with Snape.  They were both running before Harry had made a conscious choice.
Mr Potter was still rubbing his eyes and blinking, and had yet to put on his glasses, but he was awake enough to say “Thank you, Draco. And a cup of tea, if you’d be so kind.”
Lisette tutted good-naturedly.  “She hasn’t done a single thing I’ve asked her since you’ve left.  You’ll have to do some more training with her, Draco, I’m sure I can’t make her behave herself.”
“Then hopefully he’ll be in a good mood.”
“Who can tell why, your Majesty.”  Snape said.  “For greed or for ideology.  Whatever the cause, the culprit is out of our reach.  We must now consider the Dark Lord.”
“How on earth did that get here?”  Malfoy demanded.
"Yes.  I do."
She nodded.  “I think so too.  This situation with your English Dark Lord tries him greatly.”  She looked at Harry sharply.  “And you wish my husband to involve himself with it.”  She had stopped walking, and Harry realised the true purpose of this interview.
“That must be hard for him.”
“I’m sure you’re getting on well with him, he is your stepfather now, after all.”  Slughorn’s joviality sounded rather forced.
"Please, Master, let me come.  Goddess."
Malfoy pouted playfully.  “I can quit any time I like.”
Harry had to smother a frustrated snarl.  “To show me how to do all this stuff.”
Zabini finished his runes and the wall lit up with a grid of white glowing lines.  They blazed for a moment then faded, leaving the room feeling very dark.
"How much is it?"
Harry did not immediately recognise the object Louis deposited onto the table, or at least he didn’t understand its significance.  It was a Rosary made of dark, gleaming wood.  There was a resounding silence for several moments.
Suddenly a calm voice spoke loud enough to cut through the babble.  Everyone to see Neville standing in the doorway, though when he had got there, none of them could say.  "What, Ron?  One minute they're muggle-hating, Death Eater scum.  The next minute you want to be just like them, right down to their insults.  Is that how it is?" Neville regarded the red head coldly.
“It’s over.”  Harry informed him.
Marry Well.
“Tea, Potter?”  Malfoy had moved to the sideboard next to the fireplace.
“If you really want to go to that much trouble, but it’s unusual for a guest.  You'd have to get the King involved, it would be very messy.  You're better off returning barbs of your own.  As long as you don’t say anything that’s demonstrably untrue and you manage your tone you can be fairly unpleasant.”  Malfoy’s own tone was light as he said this, but there was tension in his bearing.  Harry imagined that his summer hadn’t been very pleasant.
“Should Death Eaters enter the castle, this chamber will be sealed.  Mr Bjarnsson knows the incantation to open it.  He will only do so if he believes it to be safe, or it becomes untenable to remain here.  You will be able to communicate with the rest of us through the portraits or by Patronus.”
Severus barely managed to apparate away from the Hogs Head he was so confused.  He was sure he'd heard correctly.  A child born in July would defeat the Dark Lord.  A child who's parents had defied Voldemort three times.  Draco was safe, he was an August baby.  But Lily's child was born in July.  He had to talk to her.
Draco nodded, unable to form any other reply.  Then the Ministry doors swung open and Lucius Malfoy walked out.  He was thinner and paler than when Harry had last seen him, but he didn't seem to badly injured.
"I'll leave that choice to Draco."
Lisette held her hands out and Harry handed her Belle.  Harry and Malfoy both bowed to the ladies and made their farewells.  The Queen continued her slow procession up the gallery, and Malfoy led Harry back the way Harry had come at a much swifter pace.
"Maybe you should have had the guts to stand up to You-Know-Who." Strange that Ron said that when he couldn't even say the name. He was making a fool of himself.
The Queen picked up the ruby Cavalier King Charles that had been sleeping on her lap since Harry had entered the room and put it on the floor.  It grumbled and stretched, blinking its bulging eyes.  It was clear that Lady Florence or whoever had come up with the nickname for Malfoy had not had to look far for inspiration.  Then the Queen stood.
“You’re welcome,” she said lightly, and they began walking again.  “Now, will you tell me how you are finding Versailles?”
“All kinds, really.”  Malfoy passed a hand over eyes.  “Some from Death Eater sympathisers, some from anti-monarchists, some from French purists who don’t like my father’s place in court.  I had hoped it would die down once it became obvious that our position would not alter as a result, but if anything it’s become worse.”
Draco met the younger Slytherin's eyes with his wide, grey ones.  "We're all animals." He reminded him softly before walking away.
"I could do whatever I want to you now, you know that right?" Harry said slowly, considering.  "You wouldn't be able to stop me.  But I bet you love that idea, don't you?"
Malfoy snorted, and Snape gave him a filthy look.  There was no love lost between the two men these days.
"I'm okay, Master."
Malfoy hesitated, realising Harry’s dilemma.  “You can call me Draco.  I will call you Harry.  People will assume we’re close friends, but perhaps that’s for the best.  You’re position is going to be constantly challenged because you’re English, because you haven’t been brought up at court and because you’ll be seen as trying to draw the King into a war that doesn’t concern him.  You’ll have to stand your ground at every turn.”
"It's okay, we don't mind.  Like we said, we trust you.  I'd read up on Magical Submissives, if I were you, there's a lot to know.  Just don't do anything until you're ready."
“You should refer to the King as ‘Your Majesty’ or ‘Sire’.  When entering a room, nobility enter in order of precedence.  As you are a guest, the King may wish for you to assume a particular position, but unless otherwise directed, Marquises come directly after Dukes.  If it’s any comfort to you, you will precede my father.”  The thought did indeed give Harry some satisfaction, but he quickly clamped down on it.  All of this stuff was ridiculous anyway.  “At Versailles, every moment of the day is proscribed by routine.  The day starts with the King’s petit lever in his bedchamber.  It’s now a smaller event than it has been in the past.  Only a privileged few are allowed to attend, mainly those nobles who serve as gentlemen of the bedchamber.  You may or may not be granted access to the King at this time, it depends how well His Majesty likes you.  Then there is the grand lever, when the King leaves his rooms and goes to mass, it is important that every member of the court is present at this time if they wish for advancement.  I would recommend attending both the grand lever and mass if you wish to make headway with the King.  Also there are hunts, parties and dinners that you must be seen at.  On Christmas Eve there will be a ballet, and another on Boxing Day.  There will be a feast at midnight on Christmas Eve, when gifts will be exchanged.  Christmas Day itself will be a day of hunting and repose.  Evenings are spent playing cards and making polite conversation.  Every interaction you will have with another courtier will be political in nature.  Ensure that you show appropriate deference to those above you in the hierarchy.  Address them as ‘sir’ or ‘monsieur’.”
Draco left and Ron turned to Harry. “You do know that you’re the only person in the building to have a secretary and a PA don’t you?”
"As a heart attack."
"I can count on you, can't I, Sev.  To help him become the person he needs to be."
“I don’t know.  I mean, I suppose everything that happens is in the palace is political, right?”
“She dislikes being back in Versailles, she remains in her rooms most of the time.”  Malfoy hesitated.  “And she is most displeased with me at the moment.”
"It is, isn't it, pet."
His curse made contact and Zabini went down, legs twitching uncontrollably.  In the time it took him to mutter the counter-charm, Malfoy had emerged from the other side of the desk.  Malfoy cast Collocorpus, a sticking hex, but Zabini managed to roll out of the way and cast Reducto on his way to his feet.  Malfoy ducked down behind the desk again.  Malfoy proceeded to bombard Zabini with a succession of hexes and jinxes from under and over the desk.  Zabini was hardly able to return any fire in between defending himself.  Harry could read the frustration on his face as his wand work became sloppier, and in the end, Malfoy’s Anteoculatia broke his defences.  A pair of very fine antlers sprouted from Zabini’s head, and his face contorted.
"Oh, right, no problem Harry." Neville left with no further ado.
“Yes.”
Greg looked at him expectantly.  "So you'll do it?  You'll look after Dove for us."
"You can wear it whenever you want, Dove.  I'd like other people to see that you're mine, even from a glance."
"Don't do anything, darling, just let me do what I want to you."
“I’ve decided I’ll come.”
"There wasn't, the mark on his arm and his name was proof enough.  But I warn you, it will not be an easy thing to convince them that they are wrong."
“Well, why don’t I just take you?” Draco shivered pleasantly at the wording. “It’s not like anyone will mistake us for being together.” And the tingling feeling was gone.
“No.  But I don’t think the King really needs my fame, I'm sure he has enough of his own.  And Hermione thinks it might be my only chance to get some support.”  Harry had to admit that Hermione’s argument had made sense to him, and that the thought of finally having someone in power on his side, other than Dumbledore, of course, appealed to him.
“Yeah, just like that.” He heard Harry moan as he sucked languidly.
His manners were still perfect.  As the friar turned and left, he stood calmly before Harry in his plain robes, with his hair long and lose, less formal than Harry had ever seen him.  Not monk’s robes, Harry realised, even as he registered the possibility.  He wouldn’t have put it past Draco to take holy orders, but he was glad he hadn’t.  He still had that quiet stillness about him, not really born from tranquillity, but rather an intense reserve, and the conservation of valuable energy.
Harry laughed.  "Bright's definitely the right word - for the whole house really.  I think it's about the same size as Malfoy Manor, but the decor is very different.  I'm glad you like it so far, it where you'll be living after school if we bond."
"Thank you." If The Lawyer had been anymore smug he would have started purring.  He turned to the prosecution lawyer.  "Your witness."
“Er, yeah, sure.”  Harry was a little suspicious of consuming anything Malfoy have him.
“Your Majesty,” Harry said, as he had been instructed, and inclined his head.
"Yes, Master."
“Oh, my earring, I just felt it drop.”
“No, potions.”  Luna replied.  “Maybe Professor Snape is finally going to teach defence.”
"And by imprisoning him, do you believe that you have neutralised a significant threat to the wizarding world?" It was obvious what she was doing, trying to play off their fear to convince the jury and Wizengamont of her case.
Harry ran a hand through his hair; he could feel nerves and excitement building in him, but he didn’t want to raise his hopes, or Severus’s, unnecessarily.
“Why shouldn’t I just let you make a fool of yourself?”
Harry folded his arms, considering playing his trump card.  “If you came to stay with me, you’d see my other guests.”
Draco nodded.  “At least one doe.”
Harry didn’t have a good poker face.  “Err…”
“I might do.”  Harry knew he sounded petulant, but he felt he’d earned a bit of petulance.  “Anyway, these people,” he put a finger on the newspaper, “are French.  What have they got to do with me?”
“You have other brothers?”  Harry asked, trying to be polite.
Draco found the required item and returned with it.  "Here, Master."
"No worries," Greg gave his favourite lopsided grin.  "We'll put up a silencing charm, okay?"
Severus laughed softly, before turning back to the matter at hand.  "There's a pensive of Dumbledore's in the Headmistress' office which has some useful memories in.  This deception has been going on a long time, if there was one person in touch with every part of it, it was Dumbledore."
Mr Potter scrubbed a hand through his hair. “There is no marriage, except perhaps yours to Goyle.”
Malfoy pushed himself to his feet, yawning again.  “Come on, Potter, I’m knackered.”
Snape placed a hand on his shoulder.  “O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms, so haggard and so woebegone?”  He gave Montespan a little shake.  “Fear not, child, you’ll find your beautiful maiden.”  Then his face returned to its habitual sneer.  “So do pull yourself together.”
“Is there any suggestion that your informant is correct in his identification of this person as Draco, Sire?”  Snape was ever pragmatic, and Harry knew he wouldn’t allow his hopes to be raised easily.
Snape treated Harry to his characteristic sardonic sneer.  “Quite well, thank you.”  He looked at Montespan.  “If you’ll excuse us, Alexandre, I need to speak with the Marquess.”
Once Belle had had enough of her flirting with the bigger dogs, she got to her feet and greeted Malfoy as a long lost friend.  She jumped as far as her diminutive frame would allow up his leg and made pleased little huffs under her breath.  Malfoy scooped her up and held her against his chest.
Then she extended her hand to Harry, and he bowed and kissed it too.  “Lord Dorchester, it’s so good to finally meet you.  We’ve heard a lot about you.”
“But aren’t they friends?”
Back in their dorms that evening there was an odd sort tension, the different houses tiptoeing around each other.
Goyle looked up.  “No worries, man.  Vince and I share.”  He gave another easy grin.
"But I won't be happy if I'm in Hufflepuff." Salem pouted.
“Well there is that,” they both laughed. “C’mon, seriously, Ron, you know he runs my life for me.”
“And they want to use him to draw us out.  For all we know he’s already dead.”  Malfoy countered.
Harry lifted his head for long enough to murmur a quick "come" before he dived back down.  Draco's body went taught, before he came into Harry's mouth.
Snape arrived the next day.  Harry had been awakened by a soft thump-scratch at his door, and once he had thrown a robe over his pyjamas and opened the door, he had found Bors standing there, waiting patiently.  “Er, give me a second.”  He had told the dog, feeling a bit stupid.  He had put his clothes on and followed the dog along corridors and down stairs until he was once again at Draco’s door.
Harry tucked a strand of hair out of Draco's eyes.  "Okay, more than a crush.  I think I'm starting to see why Greg and Vince were so anxious for me to wake up and like you." He gave Draco a cheeky smile.
King Louis XXIII was immediately recognisable from the photographs Harry had seen of him in The Prophet.  He was wearing robes in a gold brocade and his brown hair was long down his back.  Beside him were his wife, also in gold, and Lucius Malfoy in royal blue and silver.  Others also milled around there.  Their murmured conversation ceased at Harry and Malfoy’s entrance and the King stepped away from the group and toward the centre of the room.  Malfoy met him there, Harry at his shoulder, and they both bowed before the King.  Harry held the awkward position Malfoy had shown him until the King motioned for them to rise.  As soon as Malfoy was upright, the King embraced him.
“He’s a romantic,” Snape said dismissively.  “I need to talk to you about your interview with the King this afternoon.”
“And his father?”
Harry returned to the school and drew Draco into their new room.
“But,” Draco continued tightly.
“If you’re finished,” Snape drawled, “but yes, Miss Parkinson is correct.  Having a spell ready and cast before your opponent can complete theirs is one of the most important skills to have.  I hope you will all remember that in your own practice duels.  Now, I’m going to assign your partners, no swapping, no complaining.  Mr Malfoy, Mr Zabini, you’re dismissed.”  They left and Snape began to assign partners, in general, as was his habit, Slytherins and Gryffindors together.  Harry got Theodore Nott, which didn’t impress him.
He had a point.  Harry changed the subject.  “About next week…”
"Make sure he sees you enjoying yourself."
Harry arrived back at the dormitory at lunchtime on Saturday to hear shouting.  It was Ron, he appeared to be shouting to himself, or rather whoever he was shouting at wasn't replying.  Harry felt his stomach lurch.  Draco was the only one in their dorm who wouldn't give as good as they got.
“You suggest we simply continue as usual?”  Snape sounded incredulous.  “They have your son.”
She laughed, sweet and musical.  “Of course, you command great respect, I think.”
“Well that makes me feel better.”  Harry muttered.
"That's lucky, pet, because I think I might be falling for you." Which was all the bond would need, the potential for love.
"You have to show him that you have the means to take care of him, right?" Harry nodded.  "Well then, why don't you show him one or two of the properties you've inherited, that should prove you can provide for him.  Then buy him something nice to flash your money around a bit."
Surprise showed on the woman's face before she recovered herself.  "A necklace or bracelet or something else?"
Harry shook his head.  “They sleep in front of my fire.”
“Do you need some sort of help, Potter?”  Malfoy sounded impatient.
There was a little hitch in Draco’s breathing, the edge of a sob.  “Could I come and see them?”  He asked tentatively.
"Hey," a timid voice sounded from near his shoulder.
Draco had asked him here?  Harry had thought it was the King’s own curiosity behind the invitation.  He swallowed.  He didn’t like the answer he was going to give, so he didn’t see why the King would.  “Well, in my opinion, Sire, there’s no point in accepting Voldemort’s terms.  He won’t keep his word, he likes to play games.”  Harry had found that out the previous year, to his cost.  “If you agree to form an alliance with him, he’ll probably kill Draco just to spite you.”
Harry pushed in until he bottomed out.  He stayed there a while, with Draco thrashing and begging.  Then, when he was almost overwhelmed by the pressure, he pulled out so only the head remained inside Draco.  Harry paused for what felt like an infinite moment.  Tears slid down Draco's cheeks, Harry leaned up and kissed him, then slammed back in.  Draco screamed.
“What do you want?” Harry asked breathlessly, knowing he was teasing.
The Queen was an engaging conversationalist.  Harry sat with her and drank tea as she lightly questioned him about his life at Hogwarts.  A number of ladies sat with them and joined in the conversation at times.  Lady Florence and Lady Charlotte sat with a gaggle of younger girls at the side of the room, and they seemed happy to chatter among themselves.
"Dove, why don't you go find Blaise.  I think he was looking for you." They looked up to see Greg walking over.
Zabini drew his wand and began to trace an intricate pattern on the stone.  In its wake his wand left a bright white line that glowed for a few moments before fading.
Draco was pliant beneath him, no longer pulling against the bindings.  Harry untied him quickly, turning him over.  Draco sighed contentedly and curled up into his usual sleeping position.
"Ha, Malfoy shouldn't bother, that slimy snake isn't worth it, even from him."
"Don't worry, you don't have to be faithful.  It's just the pureblood way of bonding, plenty of people don't really believe." Vince assured Harry.
"Well, you're wrong." Draco pouted.
She smile.  "I think I have something you might like.  What is her colouring?"
The King hurried up behind them as Snape blasted the lock on the door.  He asked, “What’s happening?”  But no one answered him.
Draco looked down at his hands.  "Daddy," he murmured softly.
Harry and Neville took them and the boy scurried off before they could thank him.  “Who’s Professor Slughorn?”  Harry wondered aloud.
“Well, I’ll just give them a bit of cash to make their trip that much sooner.”
“And how did they escape with my brother.”
"Very much so, sir."
Live Fast
"Yes, Master." Draco reluctantly put away his cigarette.
Harry turned to him in disgust.  "You think that's a good thing?" Ron looked nonplussed.  "You just made a guy cry because his dad's about to face a fate worse than death.  That's not something to be proud of.  They've made an effort this year to be decent to us, but you've just behaved worse than they do."
Beside him Lucius was still a little haggard from his time in Azkaban, but was managing to command his audience in the way that only a Malfoy could.  He kept a protective arm around his son for a significant proportion of the time, as if afraid someone would try to separate them.  Severus stayed close to them as well, unwilling to let the mate he'd almost lost out of his sight for even a second.
Ron seemed momentarily at a loss.  Harry was glad the Slytherins were being so reasonable, Ron hadn't exactly been polite.  Someone up there, however, seemed to hate Harry, as Ron was evidently looking for a fight.
“Just now?” Harry pulled out his wand to shed a little light on the situation.
“Thank you, Draco. Could I have a cup of tea, please?”
Harry let out a groan. “I have absolutely no problem with that.”
"Objection," the prosecuting lawyer jumped to her feet, "speculation on the part of the witness."
"Well, I didn't say that, sir.  But I could do with some more."
“I didn’t expect you to find me here.”  Draco said, and Harry wondered if he meant he hadn’t expected anyone to find him in the church, or Harry to be the one to find him, or anyone to be looking for him at all.  His voice was still soft and enigmatic, never offering the emphasis that would make his meaning clear.
The Chevalier de Montespan was tall as well, but more sandy-haired than fair.  And he was very good-looking, Harry had to admit.  He could understand why Malfoy might show more interest in him than Louise de la Fare, whoever she might be.  The Chevalier shook his hand as well and pronounced himself delighted.
"He considers it his place." Greg pulled a face at the phrase.
“Court business.”
"Where are you with it at the moment?"
“Where we met the Grand Condé?”  Harry was still trying to get his head around the geography of the palace.
SLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSL
“Of course, sir.” Draco made his way into the kitchen and easily found the components necessary for tea. Sometimes he thought he knew his way around Mr Potter’s kitchen better that his own.
"Yeah, he observes all the Sabbats.  He stays up all night before Litha - er, what you'd call summer solstice -  and he builds a bonfire for Beltane, that's May Day.  There's loads more, there are eight Sabbats."
"Yes, Harry."
“I don’t think the Wizengamot is going to sentence the King of Frances’ beloved step-father.”  Hermione agreed.  She put the family tree on one side and helped herself to toast and jam.  “It’s probably a good thing you're learning about all of this.”  She observed as she spread the butter.  “You’ll need to know all about it if you take up Sirius’ title.”
“The Prophet?  Not yet.”  Hermione took it from him.
Harry wasn’t sure whether by ‘you’ she meant him, Severus, or them both, so he just nodded tensely.
Harry felt his heart leap.  If Draco wasn’t here, surely this man would have simply shrugged and apologised.
“Henri is the eldest son of the Prince de Condé.”  Malfoy informed Harry.  “And this is Alexandre de Montespan, the youngest son of the Marquis de Montespan.”
“Letters,” Malfoy said dismissively.
Harry scrambled for the lube in the draw of the bedside table and wasted no time in slicking his cock with it. Then he pushed his lubed-up fingers back into Draco’s hole. Draco shook his head against the pillows. “Now, Harry.”
"Yes, I suppose that would be the absolute worse case scenario.  If you were completely different people then things could get quite difficult, yes, but..."
“I think these will do for toady, sir.” He said as he laid them on the bed.
HDHDHDHDHDHDHD
Greg grinned.  "Sorry, we just want it to go well."
“And what about your godfather, Draco?”  Montespan pressed.  “There are some ladies I know who would be delighted to see him again.”
“Yes, he’s my mother’s oldest friend, they were in school together.”  Harry couldn’t imagine the dour professor hob-knobbing it with courtiers.  “Anyway, do you understand what I’ve told you so far?”
"We're going to be late.  Has everyone got everything they need?" There was a chorus of "yes, Dad".  "Harry, are you ready to go?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes but nodded and stepped across the hall.  He opened the door to a classroom, empty because it was lunchtime, and Harry followed him inside.  He turned to close the door, but Goyle caught hold of it.
"We walk the line and try not fall off." Severus informed them with more confidence than he felt.  "We play at being good Death Eaters then go running to Dumbledore with the information he needs."
"With the whole Goddess thing..."
“Safely gathered in the Hall.”  Malfoy nodded and Snape directed his attention to Harry.  “You’re to stay here, Potter.”  Harry frowned, but Snape went on before he could protest.  “Or, Mr Bjarnsson is going to stun you and you’ll stay here.  It’s you’re choice.”
“Very much.  We must have brought down at least five deer.  I think we shall have them for a New Year’s feast.  Are you well.”
"Yeah, usually, but they're all coming down with us to get fitted for robes."
At the end of the lesson, Harry's healing potion was identical to Hermione's, which he supposed he had Draco to thank for.
Blaise frowned.  "Says who?"
Harry eyed them uncertainly.  "What is it?"
Harry looked to Malfoy to intervene, but the other boy met his stare impassively.  “What do you want?”
“How did this happen?”  The King railed.
“It’s a tragedy,” Draco said defensively.
“Thank you three for joining us.”  McGonagall said frostily.
"I'm glad you haven't freaked out or started hating us for lying to you.  We would have told you earlier, but we assumed you wouldn't believe us and would think we were making excuses for what we've done."
“Well why shouldn’t I have?”  Harry was getting irritated.  “Lucius Malfoy has been trying to do me harm for six years.  He gave Ginny a cursed diary.  He’s partly responsible for Sirius dying.  And Malfoy’s been treating me like shit since the day I met him.  Or have you forgotten the Inquisitorial Squad?  I’m not going to play nice with him all of a sudden now that his father’s got cold feet and his half-brother wants to have me over at Christmas.”
Malfoy stepped away sharply and his face went blank.  Harry thought that he’d definitely won this round.  “Do let me know when you’ve made your decision, Potter.”  Then he was striding away down the corridor, sending a group of second years scurrying out of his way.
"So," Greg broke the silence first,  "what's the plan now?"
Neville looked pleasantly surprised.  "Seriously?  Nice one, Draco.  I didn't think you had it in you."
Draco made eye contact with Harry for a long moment, his eyes flat with that familiar blank expression.  “I think perhaps I should speak to the Marquis alone, thank you, Dominic.”
“Right.”
“And are you going to do that? Release a statement yourself?”
The ballet was a beautiful spectacle.  They were, as Draco had warned him was a possibility, outside.  In a grove that Draco had called the Ballroom, a stage had been erected against the backdrop of an artificial waterfall in the guise of a stone amphitheatre.  A lavish throne had been laid out in the centre, with a stool for the Queen to its side.  There were rows of stools arrayed in two wings at a small distance on either side of the throne.  No one could sit in a chair with arms but the King, Draco had told him during one of his lessons.  On the stage the woman dancing as Odette was beautiful, and her dance with her swans was captivating, but Harry was more entranced by Draco’s reactions next to him.  He leant forward, rapt, when Siegfried and Odette met, and tensed at the appearance of the wizard.  Harry didn’t find the dancing particularly helpful in following the plot, and had to rely on his memory of Draco’s summary the day before.  The music was beautiful though, and vaguely familiar.  Harry supposed he must have heard the music to one of the world’s most famous ballets before, even if he hadn’t realised it.  It was enjoyable, even though he wasn’t as enthralled by it as Draco clearly was.  A way to Harry’s right, the King and Queen sat, and to Harry the King looked like a smug cat, satisfied with having his court arrayed around him for his pleasure.  He had inclined his head benevolently when the dancers had come out on stage at the beginning of the ballet to make the obeisance, and now he sat with his wife’s hand in his own and observed languidly.
"And you should think about buying him something to symbolise your courtship.  To show that he's yours."
“That’s hardly an acceptable meal,” Snape remonstrated.
Harry wasn’t sure that was what he wanted at all.  “I usually spend Christmas at Hogwarts, or with the Weasleys.”
“I know,” Snape replied in a remarkably soothing tone.  “But now would not be a good time to forget, particularly for you, Draco.  You know how he is with you.  Anything you want badly enough he takes from you.”
"So what should we do?" he asked her softly.  If Hermione thought there was something wrong, there was something wrong.
"These jeans have so shrunk since I last wore them." He whined as he wiggled his hips to try and get them up past his thighs.
Harry sat down on Draco's bed and pulled the boy close to him without hesitation.  He had to be dominant and in control.  Draco snuggled into his shoulder, still shaking a little.  Calm and caring, he reminded himself.
Being five foot seven and weighing eight stone wet through did not make Draco Malfoy any less of a force of nature. In fact, all his diminutive stature did was lure people into a false sense of security so that he could then bend them to his formidable will. It had been this ability that had kept him out of Azkaban after the war, had kept him from having his wand snapped and his magic bound. No amount of Malfoy will power, however, could keep him in possession of his family fortune, which had been seized by the ministry, leaving him all but destitute. This lack of funds was not a problem Draco had to contemplate for very long. In his efforts to remain unincarcerated, Draco had sat in the ministry holding cells and shaken, and looked fragile, and pouted – Merlin , how he’d pouted – until in the end Minister Shacklebolt’s wife herself had insisted to her husband that they simply couldn’t send such a sweet boy to Azkaban, and didn’t he see how delicate Draco was. Shacklebolt had grumbled and moaned but in the end had prized getting laid too much to protest overly, and really, the Malfoy boy couldn’t be that much of a threat. Still, he thought it best that Draco take some menial job at the ministry, just so everybody could keep an eye on him.
"Thank you, I do always enjoy hearing that.  I'll be better when I have Lucius back."
“What are you doing?”  Hermione asked.
Harry frowned as he realised this was true.  He avoided most people because they had a tendency to hero-worship.  Neville was rapidly taking Ron's place in the Golden trio, which was a relief because it meant an end to having to listen to Ron and Hermione's bickering.
Perhaps the look in Snape's eyes when he had looked at Harry hadn't been hate, but guilt.  "I understand, Professor, I really do.  And I accept your apology."
"Hey Harry, I was just came to see how you were doing." She came and sat on the bed next to where Harry was sprawled.
Hermione frowned.  "Well they are engaged."
"It comprises of several memories, belonging to Albus Dumbledore."
“We should go in.”  Snape muttered, but he still hesitated in front of the door.  Louis’ temper had grown no better since Harry had first met him, and if the news was bad instead of good there was no saying what was waiting for them behind the door.
Draco sighed contentedly. “I suppose that is true.”
Draco rubbed his collar bone absently.  “I don’t know if I can go back to Versailles.”
“In Prague, in the Church of Our Lady of the Snows.  It appears he is a guest of the Franciscans there.”
“Leave him.”  Montespan admonished mildly.
Harry surreptitiously poked Hermione. "Look."
Draco took a breath and stepped over to a cabinet in the corner.  “I am calm.”  He opened the cabinet and took three glasses out, placing them on the gilt top of the cupboard and unstopping a decanter of amber liquid.
Harry did consider it.  He considered it all evening and all of the next morning, through breakfast and Potions with Slughorn and Charms with Flitwick.  He was still considering it at lunch, when Ginny sat next to him and followed his gaze over to the Slytherin table and Malfoy.
"Neville, could you just give us a second?  There's some stuff I want to talk to Dove about."
They looked through the rest of the house.  Another two sittings room, two conservatories, one for the morning sun and one for the afternoon.  They went upstairs.  The first floor was guest suites, the next held the master suite.  The bedroom looked out over the expansive grounds, the bed was massive with pale grey sheets and pillows.  Sheer grey, silk hangings were open around it.
“They can’t hope to get to the King,” Harry motioned at a nearby guard, “not with all this security.”
"No problem," Vince assured him, "we'll take care of it." Greg nodded.
Flosi rolled his ice blue eyes.  “So, you’re going to make sure that if they do find you and we have to fight our way out, there aren’t a hundred defenceless children around to become collateral damage.  Or would you prefer to have an eleven year old here to use as a shield?”
“Tarantallegra!”
"I am suggesting, Auror, that perhaps the 'entire wizarding world' has not been informed of Mr Malfoy's motives.  Perhaps the common knowledge it holds does not cover Mr Malfoy’s true feelings and inclinations.  Is that not possible, Auror Calcare?"
"That's what Greg said as well.  What do you mean by it?" Draco dropped his eyes evasively.  "Dove, what does it mean?"
“Stay.”  Said Malfoy, and at first Harry thought he was addressing him, but then Bors whined and shuffled unhappily, and he remembered the dogs.
“And you always help you… help me, I mean… help me out. Even when you don’t have to. Maybe I should give you a raise.” The man giggled to himself. “Like that time at the Lith-u-anian Embassy… Embassy Ball… when they got pictures of me getting head from the Lith… Lithaynan quiddutch… quidditch player who plays for the Falcons.”
Malfoy treated Harry to a look of utmost disdain.  “An invitation from the King is a great honour.”
"No problem."
"Pansy said so."  She inclined her head in the direction of the other girl.
Harry separated them with difficulty.  "I've scheduled our bonding for Thursday, love, we have to wait till then."
Draco pouted.  "Then I've gotten fat."
Draco closed them in his fist, tight, so the beads must have dug into the soft skin of his palm and made little dents, if only Harry could take his hand and look, and tucked them into some hidden place in his robes.
He'd been sitting for about twenty minutes when Ron came in.  He began to make his way over to Harry, then frowned and changed course for the dormitory.  Harry winced, Ron had been tense around the Slytherins all week and Harry could tell this wasn't going to end well.
“I’m looking for someone, I was told he was here.”  Harry saw the man’s face tighten a little in suspicion, though he didn’t lose his smile.  “My name’s Harry Potter, Marquis of Dorchester.  The person I’m looking for is called Draco Malfoy.”
“We had biscuits.  Didn’t we, Potter?”  Harry was too surprised at being included in their conversation to respond.
"What's what like, sir?" Draco looked up with confusion in his silver eyes.
Harry had to admit that he hadn’t known that.  “Why does nobody tell me this stuff?”
Lily's cool answer served to calm Severus down.  "So what do you want to do?"
“I don’t know,” Luna’s voice had become dreamy again, “all my father said about him was that he liked to collect well-connected or promising students.  I don’t think my father knew him very well.”
Harry tried not to let his surprise show at Nott’s revelation.  “Why not?”
"Oh, of course, sir.  We should certainly not overlook that previous conviction.  Mr Malfoy was convicted by the Wizengamont three years ago, wasn't he?"
“What was so important that you missed dinner?”  Harry asked as they made their way down the darkened corridor.
Harry had never seen any ballet.  “No.”
Hermione smiled mischievously.  "Well, maybe bend them a little.  After all, what's the use of being the Chosen One if you don't get special dispensation?"
"What do I say: I'm planning to court your Godson, I know you hate me, but I hope that's okay."
Montespan laughed.  “Of course it’s your favourite, it’s just as miserable as you are.”
Without further prompting, Draco dropped to his knees.  "I swear obedience to you, my Master, to do your will before my own.  My duty is to you above all others, including myself.  Your care and comfort, pleasure and prosperity are my foremost concerns.  If I am disobedient, my punishment will be yours to decide.  My life is yours to use as you see fit."
“We didn’t do this in class.”  Hermione was immediately indignant.  “Have you been having special lessons?”  She asked Zabini.
“It’s a little early, Draco.”  Snape admonished.
“But my sister will be so disappointed.”  The Duc complained.  “She is so fond of him.”
“Hello, Severus, what can I do for you today?”
"Can we help you?" Crabbe looked at them expectantly.
"Toast with marmite." Vince supplied.  He slid two slices onto Harry's plate.  "I made some up for you the way he likes it."
Harry redoubled his efforts and thrust harder into Draco’s body. He could feel himself reaching his peak, and he made sure to hit Draco’s prostate with every thrust, wanting to bring Draco off before he lost control. Draco was clenching around him uncontrollably, thrashing on the bed and whimpering little strings of nonsense to himself. Harry saw his cock twitch, and then he was coming, streaking both of their stomachs and calling out Harry’s name. Harry wasn’t far behind him, the contractions of Draco’s body bringing him over the edge in just another few thrusts.
“But why would the wizards want a king?”  Harry had had enough trouble with politicians, he couldn’t imagine wanting a monarch.
Malfoy frowned.  “Sir, please, I must implore you not to bestow such a title upon me.”
“You had this all planned.”  Harry belatedly realised.
“Oh right,” Malfoy said belatedly, “you haven’t met them.  Boys, sit.”  The wiggling continued for a moment and Malfoy said pointedly, “Please.”  They sat, heads up and eyes bright.  “Potter, this is Ajax,” Malfoy indicated the more brown-toned dog, “and Bors.”
The statue also swept a bow.  “Your Royal Highness.”
“Isn’t The Nutcracker more usual for Christmas Eve?”  Enghein asked.
Draco rubbed a hand over his face.  The exhaustion that had haunted him for the last few months seemed suddenly palpable.  “His Majesty is not quick to change his mind.  I don’t know how much we can do immediately.”
"What do you mean?  I would've thought that punishing him would prove my dominance, not that I care."
"Fuck my cover, he's going to kill you."
“Can I help you, Potter?”  Malfoy asked coolly.
Harry scowled.  “Wouldn’t you be?”
Harry sat.  “Doesn’t Snape mind us using his office?”
“With whom?”
Harry looked at Malfoy, and there was an endless, weary sadness in him.  He’d been uprooted from his home, suffered under the caprice of court life and the constant threat of Voldemort, and all without complaint, Harry realised.  But he wanted this one thing for himself, and for all his detached neutrality, there was a vein of steel at his core.  Harry wondered what would happen when his brother and his father finally pushed him too far.
“Given that your mother appears to subsist solely on Bollinger and cucumber salad, I don’t think she’ll be handing out nutritional advice in the near future.”  Malfoy’s retort was lost in a wide yawn that he quickly covered with his long fingers.  Snape sneered, but it was softer than those usually directed at students.  “Take him back to his common room, Potter.  I'm not having him fall asleep here.”
“I know,” Hermione obviously took Harry’s question to be an exclamation of shock.  “Before Narcissa married Lucius, she was married to Charles XV.  He wasn’t the king yet, he was the Dauphin, the French heir to the throne.  They had a son, Louis, but then Lucius Malfoy came to the French court, and stole Narcissa away from her husband.  The Dauphin had to go to the Pope and request a divorce, because they’re Catholic, of course.  Then Narcissa married Lucius and they had Draco, but the French demanded that his title be stripped, and the Wizengamot agreed so that there wouldn’t be an international incident.  Even more scandalously she took Louis, the Fils de France, that’s the Dauphin’s son, to live with her at Malfoy manor.  Charles XV remarried, and if he’d had any more children he might have tried to have Louis declared illegitimate, but he didn’t, so Louis took the throne when his father died.”
“I’m speaking French,” Malfoy replied distractedly, “you’re the only one speaking and hearing English.”
The Death Eater laughed himself to death.
"Sev?" Was all Harry could reply.
Kingsley shifted uncomfortably. "Harry Potter came to visit me two weeks ago, he made me aware of new evidence that has not yet been brought to light."
“No, it’s hardly a secret.  Much discussed in wizarding circles, I understand.”  Malfoy gives Harry another long look.
"Hush, you haven't seen it yet."
Ron snorted derisively.  “That’s right, Malfoy, call your dog back to heel.”
"Like I said before, I want your opinion.  I don't ever want you to be scared to tell me how you feel."
Harry straightened.  “Really, already?”
"Dove, I'm sure it was the catnip." Blaise countered.
"That we don't have a part to play anymore, because it's over."
Harry cast his wand over the grass and bent to flash it under the low bushes. There was a glint of something under the shrubbery and Harry dropped to a knee to fish it out. As luck would have it, it was indeed Daphne’s earring.
The meal was served on round tables on the lawn. Harry supposed these would have gone in the pavilion had the weather taken a turn for the worse, but as it was there was nothing more than a light breeze over the lake. Harry chose a simple vegetable soup to start, followed by duck breast in a cherry and red wine sauce, and Daphne only had to kick him under the table once when he almost chose the wrong spoon for the soup. The menu was old fashioned, presumably to please the antiquated tastes of the older pureblood diners. Daphne was having the other main course option, rabbit and spring greens, and offered Harry some, but he couldn’t quite face eating something that had once been so cuddly. When Harry voiced this opinion, Daphne merely snorted and told him that lambs were quite cute too, until you skinned them and roasted them with garlic. An old pureblood housewife to Harry’s left gasped in horror at her uncouthness. Daphne just smiled demurely and launched into a story about how her great uncle, Lord Archibald Swinton, had, when summering in Lyon, left a restaurant in disgust at the appalling quality of the roast lamb with gravy, advertised as an English speciality, only to return the next day and buy the restaurant to ensure a better quality of lamb in the future.
"Enter."
Montespan sighed.  “The King should just settle some nice country seat on him, so he doesn’t have to deal with all the drama here.”
"Yes, sir" Draco reiterated.
“Oh yeah.”  Nott confirmed.  Harry frowned.
“I wanted to talk to you.”  Malfoy motioned that he go ahead.  “In private.”  Ginny was right, Malfoy looked terrible.  There were deep bags under his eyes and his hair was hanging limp, not combed back as it usually was.
Harry chose not to comment.  Instead he unfolded the parchment and read the note.
“You stared at him all through breakfast, and now you look set to stare at him all through lunch.  Did you guys fight on the train?  Do you think he’s up to something?”
Draco sat in the common room, leaning over his homework.  He frowned, pulling Blaise's essay towards him.  "The gillyweed definitely reacts with cowslip, not the catnip."
“It’s nice to meet you too, your, er, Serene Highness.”
“Yes, I’m a friend of Draco’s.”  Harry cut in, answering Lady Florence’s original question before the argument could escalate.  He had to make a conscious effort to call Malfoy ‘Draco’, as he had suggested, and describing him as a friend felt like something of an exaggeration.
“A letter.”  Harry was too confused to take it from him.
“Louis XIV’s brother, Philippe.  Louis XIV built Versailles and he had the longest reign of any European monarch to date.  Philippe was described as clever and attractive, and he was a talented military leader.  But he was always in his brother’s shadow.  His mother didn’t want him to challenge his brother for power, so she dressed him as a girl for a lot of his childhood, and he apparently continued to wear dresses as an adult.  It probably didn’t help his reputation for being effeminate that he was gay, and relatively open about it.  They weren’t terribly enlightened about that sort of thing back then, as you might imagine.  There were also rumours that Louis had an affair with Philippe’s first wife.  You have to wonder what the current King intended when he gave Malfoy that title.”
"Yeah, Dove, one second."
Draco looked up from his place in the middle of the bed.  He sat cross legged with his hair pooled around him.  "They're to remind us how quickly your life can be ruined."
"Harry, there's so much you don't know."
“And?”
“Yes, he did, as Professor Snape suggested.”
"And did you see the top that little fucker was wearing?" Ron's voice cut through his thoughts.  "The pureblood ideal, stuck up tosser."
“Of course, sir.” Draco followed Mr Potter into his office to hang his robe on the peg and then went to fix tea.
Snape seemed to inherit Bors and Ajax, because they were at Hogwarts when Harry returned, with the run of the dungeons, teaching Fang to catch rabbits.  Or perhaps they belonged to Zabini, now, because the flanked him like a canine Crabbe and Goyle when he confronted Harry.
" Yes, Harry, girls are quite sociable."
Harry took it from him.  It was a little silver lightning bolt, with a ring at the top designed to be a pendant or charm.  Harry threaded the ring through the hole in the collar designed for that specific purpose.  It looked perfect, balancing the rest of the collar and adding interest.
Malfoy and Crabbe threw their bags onto a bed and the three of them climbed on another. Zabini and Nott also claimed beds.  Besides from them, Harry was sharing with Ron, Neville, Justin Finch-Fletchly, Terry Boot and Russel Brint (a Ravenclaw Harry had never even spoken to).
“Don’t be silly,” Hermione admonished.  “You’ve just claimed an important title, and you’re already famous in the wizarding world on your own merits.  It would be surprising if the King didn’t want to meet you.”
Harry entered.  The office was dark, but then it did belong to a Vampire.  Snape was sitting at his desk marking what looked to be essays.  He looked tired and defeated.  It was disconcerting for Harry to see his professor in this state.
"So, Harry, Draco told me you want to help Lucius, is that true?" The vampire looked at him seriously, though his tone was light.
Harry entered Kingsley's office flanked by Draco and Severus.  Kingsley looked slightly surprised to see them, Harry hadn't exactly made an appointment.
“Do you remember, Blaise?”  Malfoy said into the silence.  “When we did it at the manor, it shone gold.  It must be something to do with the-” Zabini interrupted him by putting his hand over Malfoy’s, preventing the frantic movement of his rosary.
The man smiled through a mouthful of blood.  “He’s far beyond you now.”  He jeered, and Harry could see the madness in his eyes.  “But you can get him back, your Majesty.”  He addressed Louis, who was standing over Harry’s shoulder.  “All you have to do is swear an oath to the Dark Lord, and he’ll give you your brother back.  Accept him as your lord and you will see your brother again.”
Pansy offered Harry a goblet, he took it, drinking a sip.  It tasted sweet like syrup, or nectar.  Harry held the goblet down so Draco could have a taste, holding the paler boys chin possessively in his hand as he fed him the liquid.  When it was finished Pansy took the goblet from him, which was lucky, there was no way Harry could have put it down.  He could feel Draco, feel him.  Like they had been born joined together.  Maybe there had been something in that drink.  He felt dizzy.  Hands were picking Draco up off the floor, placing him in Harry's arms.  Those hand guided Harry out of the dungeons, towards their rooms, but Harry couldn't really pay any attention, all he could feel was Draco.
Draco gasped in mock affront.  “I am not miserable.”
“He, erm,” Harry wasn’t sure how he should refer to the French king, “He wants me to come to Versailles for Christmas.”
"Yeah, if that's okay with you." Harry was a little unsure, he and Draco had never got on in the past, and even though Draco had changed a lot he might still remember their old animosity.
He gave the class another meaningful look, then disappeared into his office.  Whispers started throughout the class.  Was Snape not staying to supervise them? Why not? What was wrong with him?
Harry held it up to his date. “Here, is this it?”
“No way,” Ron reiterated, looking disgusted.  “No way are you two having sex in here.”
Harry stood looking up at Hogwarts.  It had been well repaired from the final battle and looked much like it had in his sixth year.  He stood at the entrance with the rest of the eighth years.  He, Ron and Hermione had decided to return to get their NEWTs.  Harry and Ron still wanted to be Aurors and Hermione wanted to be a Mediwitch.  There were five Gryffindors, four Raveclaws, two Hufflepuffs and three Slytherins so far.
Theo smiled at Ron, though it didn't reach his eyes.  "Sorry man, we'll turn it off if you're coming in."
“That is understandable,” the Queen began, but stopped when the doors at the other end of the gallery, which she and Harry had almost reached, opened and Malfoy stepped through.
“She came to keep an eye on everything when your cousins were in England last year,” for the war, “she’s quite a lady.”
But it didn’t come to that, and Harry, Malfoy and Flosi were only waiting a half hour after Ron and Hermione left before Professor McGonagall entered.
“She’s made a lot of changes since she became Queen.”  Lady Charlotte agreed from Harry’s other side.  “The old Queen didn’t even have Maids of Honour, just a few ancient companions.  She didn’t even like girls from noble families to come to court until they were married.  Imagine trying to find a husband while you’re cooped up at home.”
When Draco reached them, a little out of breath, his usually drawn face was open and happy.  For once he looked his age, the excursions of the morning and now his pleasure at seeing his godfather had washed away some of his tension.  Harry couldn’t help but admire him, shining like the moon in the pale winter sun.
Lady Charlotte tittered again.  “Has he resolved the matter of his engagement with his father?”  She regarded Harry avidly.
"I will, Master, I promise."
Harry had just arrived back from his lunch meeting when he heard muffled voices outside his door.
Crabbe and Goyle had a similar colour scheme, but their shorts were longer and they wore t-shirts and trainers.  Most noticeably, all three had a strip of black material wrapped around their left wrists.  It was illegal to show the dark mark in public, but the tie made it obvious they all bore it.
"Please, call me Severus, or whichever of the ridiculous nicknames the children have come up that takes your fancy."
Harry stood in the ballroom of Goyle Manor, where the reception was being held.  All around him were his friends from school, as well as family of Greg and Vince's and various politicians and wizarding celebrities.  Not only was this the wedding of two of Harry's best friends, but it was the joining of two rich and powerful families.  The politicians may have assured everyone that old pureblood families had little power after the war, but none of them were about to miss out on the pureblood wedding of the year.
"You know, with Salem and Mercury at Hogwarts now, we'll have the Manor all to ourselves." He used his grip on Draco's wrist to pull the man towards him.
"There was no trial at that time, again, none was deemed necessary."
Malfoy gave Harry a sharp look, but then schooled his face back to its neutral expression.  “My father felt it necessary to try to marry me off.”
"Oh look, there's Theo and Pansy." Hermione quickly changed the subject while Harry and Draco sniggered.
“Oh dear,” Malfoy said seriously to the little dog, and she stopped her squirming to look at him with her huge eyes, “that’s very bad, Belle.  You must do as you're told.”  She regarded him for a moment longer, and then licked him on the nose.  He relented and kissed her head.
Malfoy sneered.  “In what capacity?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes.  “Sorry, mother.”
“Do not expect the courtiers to like you.”  Malfoy said.  He gave Harry a hard look.  “They will treat you with courtesy befitting a guest of the King, but in general they hate the English.”
Skarpheðinn shrugged.  “I strengthened the wards.  If they have enough skill, they will break them, if they do not, they will not.”  There was enough earth-trembling boom.  “This brute force will not work.”
"Most masters would not be so... restrained, Master."
"Are you okay?" He asked Draco softly.
Harry felt happiness fill him.  "Then you must call me Harry."
Malfoy was being unusually forthcoming, and Harry didn’t want to push him back into his shell, so he kept his tone neutral.  “Why not?”
Harry looked at Draco slyly. “But you don’t want to do that, do you, Draco? You’d prefer if we did this.”
“Awful,” Harry replied, mildly stunned by the useless information being thrown at him.  Both girls had a buoyant manner that was unsettling after the genteel welcome he had been given by the King.  They were leading him across the front of the central palace, past windows that overlooked the gardens at the front of the building.
Malfoy’s cousins were a lot of fun.  Just watching them harass Blaise Zabini, with whom they seemed to be well acquainted, into a rage of hissing and spitting Italian made having dinner so much more enjoyable.  Even if Malfoy did have to spoil it by saying something placatory to Zabini in Italian and then leaning across to chastise his cousins in yet another language.
"Yes.  I know some people can use force very effectively in punishing their submissives in a perfectly loving way, and it's quite an attractive idea, but it's not right for Draco.  I want to use the right punishment for him."
“I doubt,” Harry interjected, nerves twisting his stomach at joining this heated debate, “that his Majesty wishes to be remembered as the king who abandoned his own brother.”  Harry remembered what Draco and Snape had told him about the King’s ego, about his temper and his lack of compassion.  Perhaps this was the only way to get him to see sense.
"Ah, yes.  Imprisonment without trial, a high point for our democracy I'm sure." The Lawyer gave a side long look to jury who sat beside the Wizengamont.  They shifted uncomfortably.  "How many of the convicted Death Eaters have received a trial of any kind, Auror Calcare?"
"Yes, pet?"  Harry didn't mind Draco using his given name.
“Severus wants you to keep it.”  Harry said, and saw the relief in Draco’s eyes, the exhale that untensed his shoulders.
“The King is waiting behind those doors.”  Malfoy brushed dust from Harry’s robes and straightened his collar anxiously.  The sudden contact startled Harry slightly, it was probably the closest they had come since their scuffles in previous years.  “Try not to make a fool of yourself.”
“In case I don’t see him again.”  Malfoy finished.
“Or,” Lady Florence suggested, “the Chevalier de Maintenon.”  The two descended into fits of giggles.
“Just ignore them,” Nott advised, “we do.”
His relationship with Snape had improved from his school days, what with their having fought a war together and their joint concern for Draco, but the man still preferred limited small talk.
“Why has he done this?  To take our brother with no thought of negotiation first.”
"Harry you must see that I can't-"
“Quite, Sire.”
“Harry, then. You don’t have to say this to spare my feelings or because you’re embarrassed about what happened before. We can just go home and pretend none of this ever happened.”
Harry broke contact to in order to kiss and nip at Draco’s neck. “We need a bed,” Draco panted.
“And he sent you instead of an owl.” Harry observed.
"Who would have a high opinion of you, Zabini?  You're Death Eaters." Ron snarled.
"And this evidence was enough for you to consider an appeal before the Wizengamont?"
“Yep.”
Harry had to steer his mind in a different direction before he ended up taking the book to bed.  He continued reading.  Hermione had been right about the masters having to prove themselves.  There was an order it had to be done in as well.  First, you had to prove your strength and ability to dominate them.  Then that you were able to provide for them, that you had the money and means to keep them secure.  After the practicalities were dealt with, you had to prove you could take care of them.  See to their needs, but first understand their needs.  As love took time to accomplish, the promise of love was accepted before the bonding ritual.  As the Submissive couldn't be touched sexually until the bonding, proving you could pleasure them was part of ritual.  When they orgasmed the bonding was complete.
As he sat, a figure made its way down the aisle.  The man was wearing a dark robe belted with a rope.  He had been replacing the collection of small candles which could be lit in prayer, but now he made his way past Harry.
"What are you accusing my Godson of this time, Potter?" There was still a bit of the old Snape in there somewhere after all.
This, of course, convinced Ron further that Draco had not changed in the slightest, and convinced Harry of the exact opposite.
“This is the Petite Écurie.”  Malfoy explained.  “The Little barn.  It used to be the Court’s secondary stable, but as we no longer use the Grand Écurie, this is where all of the King’s and courtiers’ horses are stabled.”
“Right.”  Harry chose not to dwell on that.  “Do they understand French?  He growled when you said about being killed.”
The Queen regarded him coolly for many long moments.  “You make your case well, and passionately.”  She said, and Harry blushed, realising he had been a little more enthusiastic than he intended.  “I happen to agree with you, although I do not like the idea of instigating violence.  Lord Voldemort is not simply a rival political force in Britain; he is a terrorist.  More than that, he is seeking to commit genocide.  There may be some even within this palace who have some sympathy with his politics.  I am not one of them.  I am unwilling to allow atrocities to be committed while I could try to stop them, even if they are on foreign soil.  If you wish to petition my husband to aid you in your cause, Harry, then I will add my voice to yours.”
“It’s amazing.”  More than that, but Harry didn’t have the words.
Harry didn’t see Malfoy again face to face until their next scheduled meeting, which fell just four days before their departure for Versailles.  Harry couldn’t fathom how the time had flown by so fast.  Between discussions with Malfoy, meetings with the order, and extra training with Dumbledore and the Bjarnssons, Harry had had very little time to enjoy being at Hogwarts.
“I’m Florence de Rohan, and this is Charlotte Fouquet.”  She indicated the redhead.  “We’re Maids of Honour to Her Majesty.  She requested that we escort you to her rooms, so that she can show you the palace.”
Victory was not a sweet as Harry had hoped.  Mostly because he still had questions that only Malfoy could answer.  He would talk to Hermione, she might be able to help him work out exactly what was going on.
“Yes.”
As if on cue, the little auburn spaniel came shooting past them to greet the other dogs.  Harry turned and saw Gabrielle, the lady Lisette had entrusted her dog to, hurrying down the gallery as fast as her expansive russet robes would allow.
"I don't mind, baby.  I think it's of cute that you had a crush on me when we were younger."
"I mean it." Harry pulled him in for a chaste kiss.  "Now, breakfast."
Enghien frowned.  “Call a servant.”
“Nor will you the next time.”  The statue quipped.  “But won’t you introduce me to your friend?”
Harry’s youth and inability to take part in politics had not prevented Scrimgeour, the new Minister for Magic, from calling at Harry’s new home and attempting a crude political seduction.  Scrimgeour was sure Harry would see the wisdom in the measures that he wished to impose to combat Voldemort’s return.  He elaborated only briefly on what these measures might be, and made it clear that he expected Harry’s very public support of any and all actions he took.  Harry had swiftly disillusioned him.  He might have limited political interest, but he wasn’t going to be anyone’s pawn.
Harry was slightly shocked.  He had guessed from the signs and innuendo around the court, and from Draco himself, that the relationship between the brothers was a difficult one, but he hadn’t heard it so baldly stated.
Harry frowned.  It had been hanging over him ever since Sirius’ will had named him heir to not only all of the Black possessions, but also the Marquessate of Dorchester, the Black’s ancestral title.  “I’m still not sure if I’m going to.”
Enghien snorted.  “That silly chit?  Don’t waste your time on her.”  Harry had to agree with that assessment.
Harry could feel himself starting to loose control, but he wanted Draco to come first.  For some reason it seemed important to watch his submissive orgasm.
"Bonding looks brilliant on you, Dove."
“You will join us for dinner,” Louis broke in, more a command than a question.  “And you, of course, Draco.  I won’t dine without my brother beside me on his first night at home.”  Harry didn’t miss the look the King shot behind him at Lucius Malfoy, who was watching the exchange with a sour expression.
"I was wondering, do you know what's wrong with Snape?"
Harry took a deep breath and pushed the door open.  He had been in this room before, and was familiar with its white and gold opulence.  Louis sat at the head of the large table, and Lucius Malfoy was sitting to his left.  Malfoy had a laconic air about him, as though he and his stepson had been discussing arrangements for the next ball, but Harry could easily read the tension in the King.
“Well, Snape’s his godfather, so I suppose the rules don’t apply to him.”  Ron grumbled.
Harry had been looking forward to taking grim pleasure in following Lucius Malfoy’s trial in The Daily Prophet.  Not that it would bring Sirius back, or bring Bellatrix Lestrange to justice, but it would at least bring him a measure of satisfaction.  But when the first Prophet of August was delivered to Grimauld Place, where Harry had chosen to spend the summer in spite of Professor Dumbledore and Molly Weasley’s protestations, it did not contain news of Lucius Malfoy’s imminent incarceration.  Instead, the front page held a story that Harry could not quite make sense of.  ‘King Louis XXIII of France Sires Heir’ the headline read, and the photograph next to it showed a man richly dressed in embroidered robes with long brown hair standing beside a blonde woman similarly adorned and holding a baby in a long, white shirt.  Harry read the first paragraph, which explained that Louis XXIII, King of France, and his wife, Élizabeth of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, had had their first son, who they had named Jean-Luc.  It promised a full and exclusive spread of pictures of the French royal family in the following ten pages.  This provided something of a conundrum for Harry, because as far as he knew there had been no French monarchy since Napoleon, and while he could not put an exact date on the Revolution, he thought it had probably happened about two-hundred years ago.  He was sure Hermione would know what it meant, and so resolved to ask her when she came over to use the Black library, as she had almost every day since the start of summer.  In the meantime he read further down the column.  It did not provide any more details as to exactly why there appeared to be a French king, but halfway down the page it did mention the very man Harry had initially hoped to read about.
“What precautions?  Has Dumbledore agreed?”  He had agreed to Dementors, so Harry wasn’t particularly surprised.
Harry was ready when the vocal relay spell went off and Draco’s voice resonated through his office. “Mr Weasley’s here to see you, sir. Shall I send him in or ask him to come back later?”
Vince brightened up immediately.  "Oh, not much.  Just give him something to do if he looks a bit lost.  Someone from the younger years will make sure he eats properly.  He just needs to feel he's doing something that someone else asked him to do.  Even if it's just doing homework or playing chess."
"Mr Potter, take a seat." He gestured to an armchair in front of the fireplace.  "Would you like a drink."
"Magical submissives are really rare magical creatures, they pledge themselves to one wizard or witch and are bound to them.  It's barbaric.  The submissive needs permission to eat and sleep and do all sorts of things."
“You would think not, but you must remember, Montespan, Draco may be a Catholic, but his father was a Protestant before he married Madam Malfoy.  They’re much more conservative about these things.”  Harry had been fairly sure that the Catholic Church was conservative about sexuality too, but he didn’t voice his thoughts.
It was not until the pudding, raspberry Pavlova or chocolate torte with Chantilly cream, had been eaten and the wedding cake cut that the evening became eventful. As couples were whirling around the dance floor that stood elevated above the grass, Daphne decided that it was probably safer she and Harry take a turn around the lawn in the summer dusk rather than face the horrors of Harry’s dancing. They were only about halfway round when Daphne’s hand suddenly disappeared from Harry’s elbow and shot to her ear.
“Even more of a reason not to claim it.”
“But you’re my employee, and it’s not like you can just switch jobs if my… advances make you uncomfortable, staying in this job is a condition of your suspended sentence.”
"That's okay, Draco, don't worry about it."
"We'll cast a circle, then you and Draco will be bonded in front of the Goddess.  Pansy will do the honours, she knows the ritual.  All you have to do is say yes to all the questions, Draco already knows his part."
"Woah, slow down, please." Harry was overwhelmed already.
Malfoy took a sip of his tea.  “Yes, he lived with us mostly.  His mother is a difficult woman.”  Malfoy’s tone was neutral but he was frowning.
Malfoy and Zabini turned to face one another and drew their wands.  Zabini smirked sardonically and bowed, Malfoy returned the gesture with an elegant flourish.  Then they levelled their wands at one another.
"Yeah, but don't worry about that.  I don't think he's expecting you to know him inside out, it's enough that you're willing to learn."
"Call me Luc, please.  You're part of the family now."
"And how will I look that boy in the eyes knowing I sold out his parents?"
“You’ve meant Aunt Eleanor?”  Draco was distracted for a moment.
“Don’t be silly, Harry.”  Hermione had admonished.  “No one called Sirius that, did they?  They knew he would hate it.  And nobody calls Malfoy ‘Your Grace’ at school, it’s not the done thing.”
“Lord Dorchester,” he called.
Harry cupped Dove's chin gently in his palm and tilted it up towards him.  "Don't listen to what that kid said.  I don't think of you as a pet or an object, I swear."
Malfoy poured the tea.  It was amber and smelt of citrus and flowers.  “No.”
"You're serious?".
“Don’t let Mrs Black see that.”  Harry advised.  The portrait shrieked at anything she deemed muggle.  Just the day before she had glimpsed Harry’s trainers in the hall when Kreacher had been dusting her frame and thrown the most almighty tantrum.
It was eight o’clock on the morning of Marina Shacklebolt’s wedding to Roger Davies that Draco double-checked his clothes in the mirror and flooed to Mr Potter’s flat. It was not unusual for him to visit Mr Potter before work to ensure that the man was adequately dressed for the ministry. Between that and the office, he spent very little time in his own dingy bedsit, which was all the better really. Today, however, it was particularly important that he was there in a timely fashion; he had to brief Mr Potter on the social etiquette of attending the Minister’s daughter’s wedding. There would be press everywhere looking for a scoop, as well as influential purebloods who resented Mr Potter’s place in the ministry, waiting for him to slip up.
Draco sighed and placed a palm to his forehead. The spell was intended to sober you up if you had one too many butterbeers and wanted to apparate safely, not five too many shots of Russian Snegurka-made vodka and couldn’t sit up safely. “No, sir, you’ll be sick.”

The door opened, and Malfoy stepped through floating a platter of sandwiches ahead of him.  “What are you talking about?”  He enquired.
"Just an essay?"
19 years later
“Thank God you are here,” she exclaimed, “he won’t tell me anything, he just keeps asking for you.”
“It’s a lot of nonsense.”  Malfoy complained.  Then he turned to Harry.  “We can continue this next week.  Curfew is in twenty minutes.”  Harry took that as his cue to leave.  As he closed the door behind him, he saw Snape take Harry’s vacated seat and Malfoy light his cigarette with a flick of his wand.
That was unexpected.  “Oh, well, that would be nice.”
As usual, Hermione’s explanation had raised more questions than it answered.  “Go back to the emperor bit.”
"Can you please describe for the court what this evidence is."
Mr Potter looked outraged. “Won’t regret anything.”
“He could establish a household of his own.”  Enghien agreed.  “Then no one would suspect he has any pretentions to royalty-”
Snape didn’t exactly return the grip.  He stood stiffly and placed a hand on King Louis’ arm.  “It’s good to see you, your Majesty.”  He replied.  “I trust you enjoyed the hunt.”
Harry removed then pensive from his bag and took off the lid.  "There are memories in this from the late Albus Dumbledore, they should prove Lord Malfoy's innocence."
Malfoy lifted his teacup and cradled it in his hands; it was still too hot to drink.  “We will travel to the palace with a portkey, apparition is forbidden in the grounds.  I prefer to arrive at the stables entrance, but if you prefer a more ceremonial entrance, that can be arranged.”  Harry muttered a negative.  “When we arrive, the King may desire us to attend him immediately, or he may wish to wait until dinner.  If he wishes for us to see him immediately, we will be directed to wherever he is.  Most likely that will be one of the Salons or Le Rocher, a folly in the Queen’s estate that is lately his favourite.  When you enter the King’s presence, you will bow.  You will not address the King directly unless he speaks to you.  You will not leave the King’s presence until he gives you leave.  If the King wishes to wait until dinner to meet you, you will be escorted to you rooms upon your arrival.  You will be escorted to dinner, most likely in the Rocaille Grove.  As you are a guest, and, I suppose, a Marquis, you will likely be invited to sit at the table with His Majesty.  You will sit when he sits, you will stand when he stands, you will eat when he eats.  Then there will be dancing.  It will be freezing, dress warmly.  If you aren’t invited to eat at the table, you will stand with the rest of the court and watch the King take dinner.  You will need fine robes, the King likes his courtiers to be decorative.”  Malfoy sipped his tea.  Harry picked up his own cup.  It smelt offputtingly floral, but he took a sip anyway, and found that it wasn’t as highly flavoured as expected.  In fact it was rather light and refreshing.
“You’re suggesting war.”  Louis said, with the most level tone Harry had heard from him that evening.
Greg smiled.  "It's not Malfoy, it's Draco."
“Oh right, that makes sense.”  Harry felt a bit stupid.
“I won’t have this argument with you again, I don’t recall making any headway last time.”  Malfoy responded with wry smile.
Malfoy was curled in his chair with his feet under him, and he looked over at Harry, his eyes sharp, face inscrutable.  “It’s a very sad story, actually.  Allegra Zabini was born Allegra Borgia.  The Borgias are a powerful Italian family, like many others their power in the muggle world has dwindled just as their influence in our world has waxed.  Allegra is the only child of Alfonso Borgia, and she fell in love with a poor count from Sicily, Cesare Zabini, but her father would not allow the match.  They eloped to Venice and were married in secret and had Blaise.  When Allegra’s family found out they had her husband killed.  It changed Allegra greatly.  She had known my mother at court, so she placed her son in my family’s care and went to travel the world.  She takes husbands as she sees fit, but none of them measure up to her first love.  She finds it too difficult to be around her son, he reminds her too much of Cesare.”
Tears were falling freely down Draco's cheeks now, but he nodded quickly.  "Yes, Master.  I'll take whatever punishment you want to give me, Master."
Draco looked surprised.  “Would the King allow that?”
"Do you understand now?" Dove asked Harry quietly.
“What did he teach?  Defence?”  It was the only position Harry knew to be empty.
Harry found himself disconcerted by this glimpse into Malfoy and Snape’s relationship.  “That doesn’t sound like Snape.”
“Then it’s certain,” Louis said, pleased.  “Our brother is in Prague.”  It was the news he had been waiting for, but now that Harry had finally heard it he felt largely numb.  Louis levelled his gaze at Harry.  “You will retrieve him for us.”
“Was Zabini actually going to,” Harry lowered his voice, “crucio Malfoy.”
Malfoy was still tense when he approached Harry on the Monday after Halloween.  “There are some people I want you to meet.”
Daphne took his arm and guided him over to where a smartly dressed waiter was holding a tray of champagne flutes. “Just the one,” Daphne cautioned. She too had been present for the Lithuanian Embassy’s Christmas Ball, and neither she nor Draco would allow him to forget it.
"You almost sound surprised Severus." Mende grasped Severus' hand.
“Thank you,” Harry said, although it did not cover the sudden wave of gratitude he felt at having another ally in this place.
The Dark Lord levelled his wand at Harry, and Harry matched him.
Snape looked away, but couldn’t hide his half-smile at the mention of his godson.  “I’ll accompany you, the King will allow it.”
“His family?”  He sounded surprised.
"And on what grounds did you arrest him?"
“I’ve already told his Majesty about the Dark Lord’s intentions.”  Snape pursed his lips.  “I wrote him directly after my meeting with the Dark Lord.  It seems he did not take me seriously, he does not understand the extent of the Dark Lord’s lust for power.”
They were descending a staircase now to the first floor, and Harry glimpsed the rustle of movement from the portraits that lined the walls.
“I can but hope,” Montespan glanced up at Snape, “and pray, of course.”  He added quickly.
“I’ll… I’ll do my best.”  Harry replied, unnerved by Draco’s stare.
"Thank you, Madam.  Minister, in your opinion, does this new evidence strongly suggest Lucius Malfoy's innocence?"
"Auror Clacare, could you just confirm for me that Lucius Malfoy received no formal trail before either of his imprisonments?"
"I know that's what people think, Dove, but I want it to be your decision too.  I don't want to do anything you're not comfortable with."
When Draco finally got his jeans on, they looked as if someone had painted them on him.  Definitely not appropriate for school.  The teachers never told Draco off for it, though.  They all pretty much ignored Draco, perhaps they knew what he was.  Submissives weren't treated well in the wizarding world.  They were seen as sub-human and treated with contempt, despite how rare and powerful they were.  They weren't human, no, but Harry didn't think they were any less than humans either.  If anything they were more, no human would be able to give themselves up to another person in that way.
Harry frowned.  “You’re right,” he said to Montespan, “that is miserable.”
Harry frowned.  "What's that supposed to mean?"
Grimauld Place quickly became crowded.  All of Draco’s cousins came: Flosi, Skarpheðinn, Ragnar, Gunnar, Grettir and Erik.  Harry was somewhat relieved to have them with him.  Flosi and Skarpheðinn were a welcome reminder of his time with Draco, and he knew that all of the Bjarnassons were as desperate to have Draco home safely as he was.  They were ruthless fighters in the raids and few pitched battles the Order had had with the Death Eaters.  Their father, Björn, came with them, as did their mother.  Eleanor was something of a revelation to Harry.  She was the image of Draco.  Suddenly he could see where Draco got his delicate bone structure, his huge eyes, his mournfully downturned mouth.  Where Lucius was broad and commanding, and Narcissa was pinched and haughty, Eleanor was warm and slight and controlled her unruly flock with soft words and poise.
“And you hope to become an Auror?”  Queen Élizabeth enquired.
“Did you come to fetch me?”  Draco asked.
“Harry,” Hermione remonstrated.  “Were you rude to him?”
"Yeah.  But maybe leave out the hate part." Harry was not amused.  "Seriously, it'll be fine.  Sev knows you can't bond unless you're right for Dove, and he won't do anything to sabotage his Godson's chances."
Harry quieted him, then looked at him sternly.  "I'm not going to Reject you, but you will be punished."
Malfoy’s lips thinned.  “Yes.”
Snape’s lips twitched.  “And did the King shoot something?”
Harry threw up his hands to defend himself.  "Guys please, I can only retain so much information."
Snape sighed and sat at Draco’s table.  “Your father isn’t a fool, Draco.  But he may be misguided.  He wants peace, and an easy life.  And he wants the King to consolidate his power here before he embarks on any foreign adventures.”
He and Neville left promptly.  Harry felt bad about leaving Luna alone, but she merely smiled and produced a copy of the Quibbler.  “I’m sure Ron and Hermione will pop in when they can.  I don’t mind being alone.”  She reassured them.
"Hey, Malfoy." This time it was a fifth year Slytherin.  "How come you're walking?  Shouldn't you be crawling on the floor like the animal you are?"
"We've been allies, Kingsley, and friends.  Let's not ruin that now."
The girls jumped out of their skin and wheeled to face the voice.  Harry turned too, and saw Queen Élizabeth sitting in a chair among a cluster in the corner of the room.  The room, Harry now saw, was one of the most ornate he had seen.  It was walled by white and blue marble, with gold moulding, and the ceiling was extensively decorated.
“His position with the Dark Lord is precarious.  If he has to choose between protecting the students and protecting himself, I know what he’ll choose.”  Malfoy began to click the rosary beads again.
“Yes, he wants to keep on the King’s good side.  We’re all fighting the same war, after all.  And as for the precautions, you’re about to meet them.”  Malfoy led Harry towards the antechamber off the Great Hall.  “His Majesty suggested that my cousins join me here to ensure that the castle is adequately protected.”  He explained as he pushed the door open.  “Potter, I’d like to introduce Flosi and Skarpheðinn Bjarnsson.  Cousins, this is Harry Potter, the Marquess of Dorchester.”
"What are you talking about?"
“Here I am,” Malfoy agreed wryly, “sending out a search party, were you?”
Malfoy pointed at Harry and the dogs turned their attention to him, approaching him with the same lowered heads and wiggling torsos.  Harry took a step back uncertainly.
Kingsley watched Draco take his place with a shake of his head.  "Never thought I'd see the day when a Malfoy-"
Malfoy showed no reaction.  “I’ll relay your decision to His Majesty.”
“It’s Christmas Eve, we should be enjoying ourselves, no?”  He sounded a little unsteady.  “Whiskey, Potter?”
Lucius held his son for a long time before he released him.  "I understand I have you to thank for this, Mr Potter."
"No, neither of those were used."
“I’m sure he wouldn’t have objected to the match if it had been with, perhaps, Antoine de Choiseul.”  Lady Charlotte was almost beside herself.
"It's not my place to guess your mother's motives, sir, but perhaps she knew you wouldn't get any peace until you had done what was necessary.  She knew that the Dark Lord would come for you whether she wanted it or not, so she wanted you to be prepared when he did."
“They’re attacking all the way down by Hogsmeade?”  Harry was shocked.  “But the whole castle’s shaking.”
Harry reached over and slid it open.  On the other side stood a nervous looking boy no older than third year.  He looked at Harry and held a slip of parchment out to him.  “I have a note for you from Professor Slughorn, and one for you.” He held a second slip out to Neville.
Harry guided Draco into the Great Hall with his hand in the small of the blond's back.  Not many people seemed to notice this, they were mostly half asleep and focussed on their food.  But when Harry led them to the Slytherin table it attracted more attention.  He made his way to a space on the table with Greg and Vince flanking him.
“Of course, your Majesty.”  A third woman picked the little dog up and placed it on her lap.  It curled up and snuffled contentedly.
“Harry,” Malfoy said, turning to him, and under that grey gaze Harry immediately felt included in the warmth that Belle’s appearance had engendered.  “Have you met Belle?”
Again, Harry was unsure that Zabini had really understood the boundaries of the duel.  Casting a spell that would turn Malfoy into a werewolf hardly seemed appropriate.  This time, Malfoy took a quick step to his right and ducked under his own vacated desk.  The curse sparked off the classroom floor inches from him.
Harry frowned, Draco’s brother didn’t exactly sound like someone Harry wanted to turn to for help.  He knew he was idealistic, but he preferred his allies to share his desire to help others and challenge evil for its own sake.
“Only Gregory and Vince.  Greg is the son of my father’s groundskeeper and Vince’s father is our steward.”
Draco looked up.  "Sir?"
As Harry bid his children farewell, he reflected that this was definitely a happy ending.  He looked at his husband.  "Home, now."
“He looks awful.”  She said cheerfully.
Draco flinched.  "I wouldn't presume to lie to you, sir."
Harry closed his eyes, imagining Draco under him, unable to come without Harry's permission.  Would he beg and writhe?  What would happen if Harry denied him completion?  Harry shook with the idea, the power would be addictive.  He would have to be careful not to abuse it, but if he got the balance right it would be incredible.
"Please more, Master, please."
Harry leant forward, the only time he had heard Snape talk about his role as a spy was during Order meetings and he was rarely so open.
"I know that.  It just seems to weird.  My own mother wouldn't want to turn me into The Chosen One, she wouldn't want to force me into a life like the one I've had."
One of her ladies nodded.  “There are things in life besides an advantageous marriage and a place on the hunt.”
Draco had also helped him once more in potions since the first lesson, once again catching Harry's hand before he could add the wrong ingredient, averting the disaster.  Which reminded Harry of the other thing that had been bothering him: Snape.  In all the lessons Harry had had so far he had done what he did that first lesson, give instructions and leave.  Ginny told him that Snape did the same thing in the seventh year lessons.  It was so out of character, Harry wondered what was going on.  Harry and Ginny hadn't got back together after the final battle.  Ginny had got back with Dean, and Harry couldn't bring himself to be upset.  Over the summer he had experimented a bit, found out he like both boys and girls, that he preferred to top guys than bottom, that he actually got a bit dominant in bed.  Which brought him, with a blush, back to Draco.  He wondered who would claim him.  Hermione said that they had to love him - but the amount of control they'd have over him, some part of Harry didn't like the idea of someone controlling Draco to that extent.  But then what was he going to do about it? Claim him?  Somehow, Harry couldn't see it.
Today they were studying the theory behind the Patronus charm, which Harry pretty much blanked out as he could already cast it.  Draco sat in the chair beside him, listening silently.  He had been silent since the sixth year had accosted Harry, and Harry couldn't comfort him in the middle of class.
They progressed slowly along the hall.  “And how do you find him?”  Lisette asked.  “Do you think him well?”
“Oh.”  Harry hadn’t known that.
Enghien and the Chevalier de Maintenon also joined him at Grimauld Place, and Enghien in particular impressed Harry at the ferocity with which the previously laconic courtier approached war.  He was in charge of liaising between the Order and the French troops Louis had sent over.  They were garrisoned secretly across England, in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, with the Weasleys in Ottery St Catchpole, with families in Godric’s Hollow and Diagon Alley, to name just a few.  The Ministry was quickly falling to Voldemort, and it had been decided by Harry, Dumbledore and Louis that they could not be trusted with the location of the soldiers.  Instead, the aurors who had chosen to jump ship from the crumbling Ministry, which was most of them, had been absorbed into the Order and mixed with the French garrisons.  The Death Eaters’ numbers had swollen as well in response to the open conflict, with many joining due to either belief or ambition.  In all the two sides were about evenly matched, and the fighting was bitter.
“Too close,” he explained, “I want to come inside you.”
Harry looked over at Malfoy again; he was poking at a bit of pasta with his fork.  “Yeah, I think I have to.”

Harry pulled the paper back in front of him and examined the ten-page spread of photos that followed the article.  Most were of the baby and his parents in rich, gilded surroundings.  ‘The Dauphin and his parents in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles’, one caption read, while another announced ‘Queen Élizabeth and her son in the Grand Couvert’.  The photos were all obviously staged for the press, and while they moved, it was only the King shifting the baby in his arms, or the Queens eyes flicking down to smile at her son.  The baby was uniformly asleep in all of the photos.  On the sixth page the photos changed to family groupings.  Harry saw the familiar faces of Lucius and Draco Malfoy looking out at him.  They were standing next to the King, and on the other side were the Queen and her family.  ‘The King and Queen present their son to the Earl of Wiltshire, his son, the Duc d’Orleans and the Queen’s parents, the Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.  The Countess of Wiltshire was indisposed, and is said to have met her grandson in her own chambers.’ the newspaper informed Harry.  Lucius Malfoy looked satisfied as he stared out from the photograph.  He looked just as Harry remembered, tall and imposing with an angular face and strong jaw, his hair swept back into a ponytail.  Draco Malfoy was also looking into the camera, but his face was expressionless and his eyes held nothing to show how he felt at meeting his nephew.  He was tall for his age, Harry knew he had been one of the tallest in their year before the summer, but he looked slight next to his father and half-brother.   The light blue robes he wore did nothing to hide the narrowness of his shoulders, and his face looked almost shockingly pale and drawn surrounded by the golden opulence of the palace.
It took Harry a moment to remember that that meant him.  He had almost got used to being called Dorchester, though he preferred Harry, but really his title was still unfamiliar to him.
“You can’t wait, can you?”  Ron asked, sounding amused.
Snape seemed to accept this.  His eyes were dark, Harry had no idea what he was thinking.  "Hurt him and I will kill you." The words were simple and deadly.  He lifted his lip in a slight snarl to show one elongated canine.  Harry got the message.
Harry sighed, cutting him off.  "No, it's okay.  You're right, and anyway, it's quite reassuring to see you're not as much of a pushover as I thought you might be."
"About what, Harry?"
Kingsley's eyes widened and flicked from Draco to Harry to Draco again.  "Whatever trouble you've gotten yourself into, I can help you, Harry."
Ginny looked across at Malfoy too.  “You better go and talk to him then.”
"Yes, Master."
"Don't you want to spend a bit more time with your Father?" Harry murmured.
Harry caught Malfoy outside the Great Hall.  He shouted after him and Malfoy turned, as did Crabbe and Goyle.
“Well, it’s not like I get a choice in who sends me letters.  He wants me to go to France for Christmas.”
“Don’t muggles come and visit Versailles all the time?”  Harry asked absently as he examined the space.
Draco shivered.  "No, Master."
“Charming.”  Harry muttered.
The dark-haired man on the floor was wearing black robes and was covered in blood.  It seemed to be his own, as it was clear that one or both of the dogs had attacked him and his throat was all but ripped out.  Snape approached the man and crouched over him.
“Give him a scratch, then.  Merciful Lord, have you never seen a dog before?”
Malfoy made a non-committed noise and Harry felt he hadn’t quite got to the heart of it.  Malfoy walked over to the fireplace and Harry looked at the room he hadn’t been in since his Occulmency lessons had ended so abruptly the previous year.  The room hadn’t changed, the walls were full of jars of ingredients and the desk stood imposingly in the centre, now bereft of the Penseive.  Malfoy directed his wand at the fireplace, and it sparked into life.
All in all, Harry felt refreshed and ready to start the year as he stepped on to Platform 9 and 3/4, although Sirius’ death was still hanging over him.  He knew that it was at least in part his fault, and had spent a great deal of the summer berating himself for not learning occlumency more effectively and for falling for Voldemort’s trick.  His grief was not lessoned by the knowledge that Sirius’ death would undoubtedly not be the last in the war against Voldemort, and over the summer Harry’s resolve to take a leading role in the fight had hardened.  Before he died, Sirius had encouraged Harry in to be involved in the Order of the Phoenix and not leave the decisions to the adults.  Now Harry had heard the prophecy, he knew it was even more important to be party to those decisions.  If fighting Voldemort was going to be his destiny, he needed all the information he could about what the Dark Lord was doing.  To that end, Harry had granted Dumbledore’s request that the Order meetings continue to be in Grimauld Place on the condition that Harry be allowed to attend them.  Not that he had learned very much.  Voldemort was playing his hand close to his chest after his failure at the Ministry.  It was unclear where he had set up a base; Malfoy manor had been shut up since Lucius’ release by the ministry in late July, and the whole family had spent the summer in France.  It was also unclear how many followers Voldemort had amassed, with the Malfoy’s as such prominent defections and many other dark families fleeing the country in order to stay neutral.  On the other hand, Voldemort appealed now, much as he had when he first rose to power, to the disaffected youth of the wizarding community, and so might have picked up new followers to replace those who no longer served him.
“His Council Cabinet,” Condé replied, “he is in a state of great agitation.”
"Don't worry, I was awake already."
"On your knees, baby." He murmured into Draco's ear.  There was something very erotic about ordering someone to their knees, the fact that Draco looked so vulnerable and innocent made it so much better.
“You didn’t have dinner,” Goyle said by way of answer.  Malfoy rolled his eyes.  “Did Potter walk you back?”  Goyle didn’t sound impressed by the idea.
"And Draco doesn't mind."
Malfoy looked surprised.  “French Earl Grey.  Severus keeps some for me.  He won’t touch it himself.”
“I’m fine,” Malfoy rolled his eyes, “they’re not even in the castle.  Are Gregory and Vince in the Great Hall?”
“Alright,” Harry accepted.  Then a thought diverted him.  “Why do you still call him the Dark Lord if you're not on his side?”  He asked Snape.
"But Draco, you have to remember that everyone will know what you are if I court you.  You'll have to submit to me in public as well as private." This wasn't Harry's choice, it was a requirement of the bond.
"Like what?"
“Do you think that’ll help?”
“Blaise is of age now, he’s spending Christmas with his grandfather.”
Draco stood as well and moved to take Mr Potter’s robe from his shoulders. “Good morning, Mr Potter. You have a meeting with Miss Greengrass in ten minutes and lunch with the Secretary for Galleons and Ministry Gold at one-thirty.”
"I'm sorry.  I'm going to do anything I can to help your father."
“I had letters to write.”  Malfoy’s tone was playful in a way it only ever was when speaking to his godfather.
Harry had proved his dominance over the past three days.  Pinning Draco's arms above his head while they kissed, having him kneel next to him during meal times and giving him orders to pick Harry out clothes or fetch things for him.
"I'm fine, still trying to find my feet with this whole courting thing."
HDHDHDHDHDHDHDHD
“Well yeah,” said Harry, feeling a little defensive, “it’s important to practice this stuff, pretty soon we’re all going to need it.”
They still had a few hours before the rest of the school arrived and it would be time for dinner.  Most of the eighth years now sat in the common room.  As Harry chatted to Ron, Hermione and Neville, he saw Crabbe, Goyle and Malfoy enter.  They moved over to what had become the Slytherin section.  There was only a small couch left which Crabbe and Goyle sat on, Malfoy sat at their feet.  The whole thing seemed slightly surreal.  Harry had never thought Malfoy could look so comfortable sitting on the floor, but it seemed second nature to him to sit at his friends' feet.
“He’s so well behaved, what does he even have to confess?”  Montespan pondered.
Snape sighed.  "I do suppose I owe you an explanation, and now seems to be the correct time to set things straight.  I don't know how much Draco has told you, so I will explain all that I can.  I expect you believed me to be hostile to you because I disliked your father." Harry nodded.  "It’s true that I didn't like your father in the least, but your mother was like a sister to me.  When we found out about the prophesy, your mother told me to go to Voldemort.  And I did.  It resulted in their death.  Every time I see you I'm reminded of that.  Lily asked me treat you like any other student, and I'm afraid I've failed her.  I'm not proud of that."  His sentences were staccato and awkward, but then it was an awkward situation.
Harry offered Draco the food with his fingers.  Draco willing opened his mouth and accepted the food.  His lips brushing Harry's skin as he closed them around the toast.  Harry had to stifle a moan as he immediately got hard.  Draco laid his head against Harry's thigh and Harry stroked his fingers through the soft, blonde hair.  Now Harry understood why this was the done thing, it was so intimate.
Harry shook his head.  "I couldn't say.
“He’s in an odd position.”  Hermione observed.  “He’s the King’s brother, but he’s not royalty.  And he’s English, but he has a French title.  And about that,” Hermione lent forward, “do you know who possibly the most famous Duc d’Orleans is?”
"It will go well," Vince asserted, "you guys are gonna do fine."
“Quite alright, my boy.”  Slughorn assured.  “I understand.  Duty before pleasure.”
Then Harry was kissing him again, and it was all mouths and tongues and teeth biting each other’s lips. Harry pulled Draco’s robe off, his own discarded upon entering the apartment, and hoisted the smaller man off the ground. Draco wrapped his legs quickly around Harry to keep his balance and ground their hips together. Their kiss remained frantic as Harry set Draco’s back against the nearest wall. They ground together rhythmically as their tongues played.
Harry knew the real question behind that, so he answered it as frankly as he could.  "I'm going to ask Dove if I can court him."
Harry put his arms around Draco's slim body.  He sat down on the bed with Draco nestled into his shoulder sobbing.  Harry continued to murmur reassurances, running his hand through the long, blond hair.  He couldn't really see why Draco was so upset, they'd got into loads of physical fights in previous years and he told Draco so.
"I have to show him that I can provide for him and take care of his needs."
Draco obeyed immediately.  Harry groaned as he slid past Draco's lips and they sealed around his cock.  He slid further into that wet heat, feeling the head of his cock brushing the back of Draco's throat.  Draco gagged a little but fought to control it.  Harry only moved inside Draco's mouth a little before pulling out.
“Indeed,” said Snape irritably, “might you tell us where?”
The King held out his hand behind him and his wife stepped forward to join them.  “Draco, welcome home.”  The Queen said warmly, and held out her hand for Malfoy to kiss.
"I just did what the Wizengamont should have done, Sir."
The doors at the other end of the balcony were guarded by red-robed sentries standing immobile and imposing.  Malfoy scarcely checked his stride as they stepped out of his way and opened the doors.  Harry was close at Malfoy’s heels as they entered the Salon of Hercules.  It was, unlike what had gone before, not white.  Instead, the walls were decorated in slabs of red or blue veined marble, with gilt moulding and a classical scene painted onto the ceiling.  It was large room, though not in the same league as the chapel, and there were arched windows on two sides making it bright and airy in spite of the imposing colours.  But Harry only took in the décor for a moment before is attention was drawn inexorably to the other end of the room, where a small group of people was clustered before the fireplace.
The Lawyer smiled, or rather smirked, he had to be a Malfoy relative.  "So my client was arrested on the grounds of common knowledge."
Louis smiled.  “Excellent.  In that case, Draco, I chose this room to meet you because I knew how anxious you would be to get to the chapel, so if you wish, then you are excused.”
He turned around to see that Mr Potter had finished dressing and automatically reached out to straighten his employer’s comically lopsided collar and used his wand to flick out the creases the Mr Potter had somehow managed to put in the robes in the two minutes they had been in his possession. “I’ve made arrangements for you to escort Daphne Greengrass to the ceremony and reception, sir.”
"Come for me, Draco." Harry somehow managed to order.
Greg looked at him intently.  "You don't have to do this, you know.  You still have another week to complete the bond."
Tears overflowed a spilled down Draco's cheeks.  "I didn't want to, it wasn't my choice, I didn't want to." He whimpered over and over into Greg's shoulder.  All the Slytherins were talking at once, while Ron was ranting about attention-seeking snakes.  It was rapidly getting out of control.
“Monsieur,” the guard who had accompanied them pounded on his door, “Monsieur, open the door, please.”  He kept pounding, but there was no response.
"Yes, Master." Draco didn't hesitate, as Harry sat down he slipped to his knees on the floor next to him.
“And?”
Draco examined the dark rosary that had been returned to him.  “Severus…”. He didn’t ask, couldn’t bring himself to finish the question, just stared down at the beads.
“Well, start thinking.  Not even I can protect you from your own stupidity.”  Then Malfoy softened.  “Just act like you know what’s going on, Potter, and you’ll be fine.”  He held out the portkey.  “Ready?”
“To play cards, Your Majesty.”
"Yes," he whispered, "sorry if I woke you."
“He seems to like you,” Harry whispered back.
The Order took Voldemort by surprise at his stronghold deep in the heart of the Ministry.  Harry let the others deal with his minions.  While Crabbe and Goyle and Draco’s cousins took care of the Death Eaters that blocked the way, Harry strode through the tumult and into the room in which the Dark Lord was holding court.  There were a few more Death Eaters here, of course, and Harry soon found himself battling the shield they had formed in front of Voldemort.  Harry was not alone, either.  He had Snape beside him, and Flosi and Enghein had overcome their adversaries in the corridor to join Harry.  Battered and bleeding, the four of them managed to remove the final barrier to Voldemort.  He was less than Harry remembered him from when they had last met almost two years earlier.  Then he had seemed all-powerful, terrifying and invulnerable.  Now Harry saw him for what he was, a twisted man whose skill in the Dark Arts and manipulating others had not been enough to defeat the forces allied against him.  His presence still filled the room, brooding and malevolent, and he felt Enghein falter beside him, but it no longer had any effect on Harry.
Harry turned, and was unsure whether he felt relieved or not when he saw his saviour.  “Professor Snape,” he replied, “how are you?”
“Of course.  Allow me to present Harry Potter, the Marquess of Dorchester.”  Malfoy turned to Harry.  “Harry, let me introduce His Serene Highness the Prince of Condé.”  The statue was wearing a broad, feathered hat, high boots and wielded a large sword.  He didn’t look particularly serene.
“No,” Skarpheðinn replied, “the wards have held.  But they’re still trying to get through.”  In the distance Harry could still hear booms and crashes as the Death Eaters tried to break the wards.
“What are you drinking?”  Snape leaned in to smell Malfoy’s cup, and then recoiled.  “Not that swill.”  He went over to the sideboard and pulled a decanter and two chasers from a cupboard.  He poured a decent measure of amber liquid into each.  His approach to dealing with having Harry in his office seemed to be to ignore him.  He took a shallow, rectangular silver case from the top draw of the cabinet.  Opening it revealed a row of white cigarettes with a double silver band between the filter and the tobacco and curling silver script beneath it.  He picked up the two glasses in one hand by pinching the sides together.  He deposited them on the table in front of the fire and held out the open case to Malfoy.
“Is dead.”  Malfoy said shortly.
“Yes.”  That was an understatement.
“So,” Enghien said when Malfoy was gone, “is Draco as miserable at school as he is here?”
“Right.”
There was silence as Ron failed to come up with a reply.  Then Greg looked up and met Harry's eyes.
"I did."
They hurried along the gallery, past the chapel and into the Salon of Hercules, where Harry had first met the King.  From there, there was a seemingly endless succession of Salons, each as richly decorated with paintings and marble as the last.  Finally they left the War Salon and entered the Hall of Mirrors.  Lisette was standing in the Hall in front of the entrance to the Council Cabinet with Belle in her arms.

“He’s been looking too.”  Harry assured him.  “He sent me here as soon as he knew where you were.”
"And you can't take Malfoy with you?"
“As there are so few of you will share a common room and dormitories.  You will not be with your houses.”  There were groans.  “There is no room for you there.  As you know, you will have much more freedom this year.  Curfew does not apply, school uniform is not compulsory, and you may leave the grounds whenever you wish.  I trust you will not abuse these privileges.  Now please follow me to your dorms.”
Draco leant into his Master's side, relieved.  "Thank you, Master."
"Good.  How about we sit down and discuss what I came here to discuss."
Harry and Draco stood outside the Ministry.  Draco shifted anxiously, they had been waiting for almost half an hour.
Greg and Vince watched in surprise Harry led their friend away.  He lead them to their room and pulled the chair away from the desk.  "Sit." He instructed.  Draco sat with trepidation, looking up at Harry with fear in his eyes, tears beginning to shine.  He was wearing the cuffs Harry had given him.  "I told you not smoke anymore and you disobeyed me.  What do you have to say, Draco?"
“Three little faggots,” Zabini said, his affectionate tone belying his words, nodding over at their bed with a fond smile.  “It’s enough to put a straight guy off his food.”
"Being a... what you are." Harry didn't want to take any chances of being overheard.
“What?”  Harry was nonplussed.
“You don’t seem particularly concerned about Draco, Lucius, given that he’s your son.”  Snape squared off against Malfoy, his stance aggressive.
Draco's jaw dropped.  "That... that's your decision, sir."  They were back to sir.
"You have to feed him by hand." Greg clarified.
“Er, sure?”  Harry was starting accept his constant state of mild bemusement.  Draco poured an amber stream into a delicate china teacup and placed it on a saucer in front of Harry.  “Thanks.”
Severus nodded solemnly and turned to leave.  Lily caught his arm.
“For God’s sake!”  Malfoy snapped.  “Will you stop being so ridiculous.  I’m going to bed.”  And he pushed past Goyle into the common room.  Goyle shrugged and followed him.
That made sense and ten other Slytherins were nodding.
Draco shuddered. “Oh God yeah, make me come, I need to come.”
Fascinating was not the word Harry would have chosen.  Mind-numbingly dull would have been more appropriate.  Hermione gathered her parchment and pen back into her bag and left for the library with half a piece of toast in her mouth.
“It’s really fascinating that you’re eligible to claim it at all.  Muggle peerages can usually only be inherited by blood relatives.  I don’t know why being a godchild is so important to wizards, it could have some magical significance, or it might just be a social convention, or one of those odd legal loopholes.  It’s one of the things I'm researching at the moment, actually.”
“So Draco Malfoy is the King of France’s half-brother?”  It didn’t sound very credible to Harry.
“I’m sure their Serene Highnesses would love to have a small portrait of their first grandchild.”  Draco observed.  “Particularly if it’s as masterful as Bonnaire’s usual work.”
“Indeed.”  Replied Slughorn.  “Are you feeling alright, my dear boy?  You look exhausted.”
"Severus? He's mourning."
"Yes, sir."
“This is him, I know it,” Draco hissed, “whispering in the King’s ear.”
Harry looked across at Flosi, who offered him a wide, feral grin, and shrugged his shoulders.  “Fine.”
I would be delighted if you joined me for lunch in my compartment.
The tension in Draco's body and the redoubling of his tears made Harry wonder what exactly Draco expected Harry to do to him.  "I know you will. " He reached across Draco to the desk and pulled out a scroll and a quill.  "You're going to write a foot and a half long essay for me called 'why my Master doesn't want me to smoke', okay?"
“Stand back,” Snape ordered, drawing his wand.
“Now, now, come on, Harry, I want it now.”
"Is Draco really serious about Wiccan?"
The lessons for the rest of the day were normal.  They just carried on from sixth year as if nothing had happened.  As if there had been no war, no deaths.  As if a quarter of their year didn't have the Dark Mark.
“Because, like you said, he runs you life for you. Or the bits you’re too clueless to deal with, like that time…”
“And you’ve explained to them that I didn’t mean to propose?”
“To trap you, Sire.”  Malfoy stated baldly.  “He hopes to strike a decisive blow before you can think to resist him.”
"Harry," Draco repeated with a blush.
That was where Draco’s other skills came in handy. Draco was a natural organiser, and it just so happened that the Minister had a new undersecretary for the new Department of Magical Unity and Togetherness who was in desperate need of organisation. Draco was swiftly assigned as a Personal Assistant to the rather inexperienced new undersecretary, Harry Potter. Draco was none too pleased to discover exactly who his employer was, and he had very nearly refused outright. But, while petty schoolboy grudges and differing sides in a not-so-petty war were all very, not having enough money to feed oneself rather put things in perspective. And really, all he had to do was call the man Mr Potter, and make the occasional cup of tea; and Mr Potter really did look quite delectable in work robes, once Draco had shown him what they were; and really it wasn’t so very long ago that Draco had considered himself rather in love with Mr Harry Potter. So he somewhat swallowed his pride, and put up with Mr Potter’s constant tardiness to important meetings, and gritted his teeth when Auror Weasley dropped in – who only came by to suggest that they just have an inter-house orgy, ‘cause that was togetherness, wasn’t it, while staring absently at Pansy’s breasts, who, as Draco had engineered luck to have it, was Mr Potter’s secretary – and he did his job.
“And you.”
"But you plan to, yes?" Harry nodded.  "Then why not buy the set and give the collar to him at a later date? We can package them for you separately." She was doing the sales assistant thing now, but he could see the sense behind it.
Draco ran straight into his Father's arms.  "Daddy."
"Thank you for allowing us to do this, Professor." Harry addressed the vampire gratefully.
Malfoy frowned.  “They’re my friends.”
Draco smiled demurely as he looked up at Harry.  "And what's your point, Master?"
Harry had felt eyes on him throughout the Welcome Feast.  The other students were understandably curious about the reports they had heard over the summer concerning the Department of Mysteries and a prophecy.  The Prophet had begun referring to Harry as The Chosen One, which Harry viewed as an improvement from the previous year’s allegations of insanity, but it was still not particularly pleasant.  After all, Harry was only ‘chosen’ in the sense that Voldemort had chosen to believe the prophecy referred to him rather than Neville or any other child.  Harry fit two fairly generic criteria, born in July to parents who had defied Voldemort three times, but the aspects that singled Harry out particularly were dictated by Voldemort, not be anything specific to Harry.  Voldemort had marked Harry, as the prophecy promised, and Voldemort had some intrinsic failing that Harry would hopefully be able to exploit when they finally fought.  That was the only information the prophecy provided.  Harry thought that if the rest of the student population knew the limited extent of the prophecy, they would be significantly less interested.  So, probably, would Voldemort.
“No, sir.” Draco replied before Daphne could. “Anything Daphne says will be checked with her parents before it’s published, no one wants to get on the wrong side of the Greengrasses. No, unfortunately in this case Daphne’s actions will speak louder then her words.”
Hermione opened her book to a book-marked page.  “I think you should consider it.”
“Lord Dorchester?”  The blonde asked.
“Don’t,” Harry interrupted him, “mention the Lithuanian Embassy Christmas Ball.”
The man turned.  “I can try.”  He had a warm, pleasant face, and smiled at Harry.  “Good afternoon, my friend.  How can I help you?”
“Excuse me, Friar,” Harry said, hoping his translation spell would hold up, “can you perhaps help me with a small matter.”
"Well, I...." Harry trailed off.
“Yes, thank you Draco. Just tell Pansy to send the report for Emerson in as soon as she’s copied it up.”
“We haven’t much time,” Snape countered. “The Dark Lord is well on his way to infiltrating every facet of the Ministry, and he is already starting to turn his eye to France.  When he called me to him last it was to ask whether the King might submit to his cause.”
"I'll bring him back," Mende looked between Severus and Draco, "for you both.  I won't see you mourn him."
The Auror seemed a little confused.  "He's a Death Eater, he bears the Dark Mark, he's  committed many murders and tortured many people, all this is common knowledge to the entire wizarding world."
"Can we not." Harry cut across him.
"Defence calls Auror Calcare to the stand."
“Yes,” Malfoy agreed, but did not elaborate.  He sat himself down in one of the chairs, Snape’s, Harry thought, and gestured to the other.  “Have a seat.”
"How was he?" Greg asked Harry later that evening.
Ron shook his head.  “All the passageways lead into Hogsmeade, the Death Eaters are bound to have people there.  The wards start just a little way from the village.”
Daphne looked at him as though she thought he was mentally handicapped. “Of course I have, but they don’t care. This is the most advantageous marriage they could have hoped for, and they won’t let it go easily. They don’t see the fact that you didn’t mean to propose as any reason for us not to marry.”
“Come in, come in.”  Slughorn gestured them in good-naturedly.  “Sit yourselves down.”  Harry and Neville sat on the same side as Slughorn, but left a seat free between Neville and the rotund professor.  Harry found himself opposite Malfoy, but the boy did not meet Harry’s gaze.  “Do you all know each other?”  Slughorn enquired solicitously.  “You four are in the same year,” he indicated Harry, Neville, Zabini and Malfoy, “so I expect you do already.”
When he returned to the bedroom, freshly brewed cup in hand, Mr Potter was in the middle of getting dressed. Draco quickly placed the cup on the bedside table and turned away. It was hardly the first time he had seen Mr Potter in a state of undress, it happened most mornings, but it still managed to fluster him. He cursed his pale complexion, which showed the rush of blood to his cheeks so completely.
“I know the Queen supports us.”  Draco agreed.  “Perhaps her voice in the end will outweigh my father’s.”
“Have you seen this?”  Harry brandished the article at her by way of greeting.
"Yes, baby.  What else do you think I bought it for?"
“Tea?”  Draco asked, “It’s Darjeeling.”
Greg touched Malfoy's arm gently.  He looked up.  "Draco, but these guys," he gestured this friends, "call me Dove.  I have no idea why."
"Nice to know you have such a high opinion of us, Weasley." Blaise and Vince had come in behind Harry.  It was Blaise, unsurprisingly, who had spoken.  Could this get any worse?
Harry considered.  “I don’t know.  He looks tired a lot of the time, and stressed.”
“Yes, but the French and English wizarding communities are very close.  British magical aristocracy aren’t welcome in the British court.  There are some great books I can show you about it in the library, if you’re interested.”
Harry gulped, he hadn't realised Snape would interpret it like that.  "I don't want to humiliate him, sir.  Over the last few weeks we've grown to know each other better and I think I could bond with him."
Malfoy gave Harry a rare smile and turned away from the view towards Harry.
There was something weird going on here and Harry didn't like it.  It felt wrong.  Malfoy wasn't acting like he usually would, he wasn't dressed like he usually was, didn't make the same sneering comments or show his usual distain.  Harry knew first hand that people could change, but they didn't just get personality transplants.  He resolved to watch closely to see what was really going on.
“I’m going to see about some lunch.”  Malfoy announced, and stood.
“Quite, thank you, Sire.”  Harry thought of his hard landing on the stable floor.  “I’m pleased to be here.”
By the time Daphne arrived at the office, Mr Potter was happily ensconced in his office with tea and Draco and Pansy were settled back at their desks facing the work pen that housed the rest of the department. The rest of the department that erupted in whispers when their boss’s reputed fiancée arrived.
"A bit more than a crush, Master."
Harry frowned.  Why wouldn’t Lucius Malfoy want Voldemort to be defeated?  Even if he had loyally supported him the first time round, he had fled this time and would surely be in danger if his former master came to power.
Lucius closed his eyes, praying to every deity he knew of.  "Just hand over the prophesy, Mr Potter.  Then you and your little friends can leave peacefully."  And I won't have to fight and pretend to be outwitted by children my son's age, he silently added.
“Draco is very proper about these things.  It was his father that raised him this way, I think.”  Lisette’s voice showed a little distaste at the thought of Lucius Malfoy, and Harry liked her even more.  “And my husband encourages it.  I tell him not to, but he finds it charming – his brother the little duke.”  She tutted.  “Are you close with my brother-in-law, Harry?  I may call you Harry?”
“She’s the only woman for me.”  Montespan said with a despairing shrug.
Harry opened his mouth to ask what the hell a magical submissive was, but Hermione put her hand on his arm.  "Thank you, we won't tell anyone." She said, as if they'd explained everything.
"Lilith don't tease your brother." Lilith just smirked, looking a lot like Draco did whenever they ran into Ron in Diagon Alley.  "It doesn't matter what House you're put in, Salem, just as long as you're happy there."
Draco scowled.  “I know how to deal with him, Severus, I’ve been doing it all my life.”
“Won’t. Do it.” He replied staunchly.
As he tore a piece of toast off for Draco, he realised they had been talking about him like he wasn't there.  It was easy to do because Draco wasn't in his line of sight, but Harry swore to himself not to let it happen too often, he didn't want Draco to feel insignificant or forgotten.
"What's it like?" Harry asked, breaking the silence.
“Please, call me Condé.”
A middle aged man made his way to the stand.  Harry recognised him as the Head of MLE, he had been in charge of the Death Eaters' arrests and subsequent imprisonment.
“I concede.”  Muttered Zabini.
Harry cast a glance at Flosi.  “I didn’t get much of a chance.”  He replied ruefully.
"No they haven't," Greg replied in a long suffering tone.
"Okay, take care, Dove." Greg kissed Draco's forehead.  Vince followed suit.
"What?"
"I'm afraid I don't understand question." Calcare all but pouted.
“Yeah, him.” Mr Potter snuggled more into Draco’s shoulder. “Didn’t want him though.”
"No ma'am."
Harry had waited until after the Feast and the completion of Ron and Hermione’s duties in shepherding the first years back to the Common Room to tell them about the letter.  When they were settled in front of the fire, Hermione with a book and Harry and Ron with a deck of cards, he showed them.   Ron looked just as thunderstruck as Harry felt.
“Blaise.”  Malfoy said with a warning tone.
"No, Draco did."
“What kind of threats?”
“Things are tense at the moment, but there’s nothing to be worried about.  They’re over reacting.”
Harry peered at the table where the flash had been.  It was no longer empty.  “Oh God.”  Harry felt sick.
Harry grimaced, he hated flashing his cash, it was a good idea though.  "Yeah, Greg and Vince suggested that I buy him something to show that I'm courting him." Harry groaned.  "Damn, Draco's not allowed off the school grounds during term-time, though."
"Why do you ask, Salem?" Harry replied.
"Pet?"
"I sort of... well that is to say... I've kind of liked you for a long time, sir." He finished very quickly.
Ron scowled.  "I'm not, but we can hear you in the common room."
"Yeah, that's what people who aren't his friends but know what he is expect him to do."
Harry looked up to see Draco standing timidly next to him.  He looked uncomfortable standing above Harry and shifted from foot to foot.  His wide grey eyes trained on the ground.
To Harry’s surprise, Snape answered instead.  “Lucius has not hidden his opinion that France should not involve itself with the war against the Dark Lord.  The King takes his stepfather’s opinions seriously.”
"Uh, yeah," Harry looked over at Hermione for help.  She gave none.  "We were wondering if there was something up with Malfoy."
"For the way I've treated you in the past, Mr Potter, I'm apologising."
"Mmmmm," was all Draco managed.
"What?"
“We were so worried about you.”  She told him.
Reluctantly, Harry pulled away completely and made led the way to the bedroom. He turned and sealed his lips against Draco’s as soon as the blond had caught up with him. He sucked on the other man’s bottom lip as he slowly divested him of his shirt. Draco began to do the same to Harry, too needy to be shy anymore. Shirts discarded, Harry broke their kiss, this time to back onto the bed and pull himself up to the headboard. Draco took a moment to admire Harry’s defined chest and abdomen and his smooth, light-olive skin.
“He’s a fool if he thinks the Dark Lord will leave us alone.”  Draco muttered darkly, echoing Harry’s thoughts.
“Seems like your gonna be footing a rather hefty bill for all of this.”
Mr Potter shuddered and rubbed his face with his hands. “Oh, God, I hate that.”
Malfoy snorted.  “He’s going to get me killed.”
"I have a lot to learn about his life, don't I?"
Daphne took the seat opposite Mr Potter’s, while Draco hovered near the door and tried not to think about how good his employer’s shoulders looked in the shirt he had chosen for him that morning. Draco always found it hard to concentrate in Mr Potter’s office, seeing the man so scruffy and rumpled, in spite Draco’s best efforts, in stark contrast with the room that Draco kept scrupulously neat.
Draco looked up at him with terrified eyes.  "I didn't mean to, I swear.  It just happened.  Please don't be angry with me." Tears spilled down Draco's cheeks.
"Objection." The other lawyer declared again.  "This is irrelevant to the case."
"I like it." Harry confirmed.  He slipped it around Draco's neck and fixed it in place.  "Now I'm going to tie you to the bed a fuck you, would you like that?"
“Well, what do you expect?”  Malfoy said now.  “My father’s past escapades and current preferment by the King have only stirred up the rivalry that has always existed between us.”
The Chevalier shuddered.  “I don’t envy him that.”
“Don’t worry,” Lisette replied, “she clearly had great motivation.”
"Would you make love to me again, please." Harry was surprised at Draco's boldness, but pleased.  He wanted Draco to feel like he could ask for what he wanted in bed, not like he had to tread on eggshells.  "I mean, if you can handle it, sir." Draco added in mock concern.
Malfoy met it.  “You seem overly concerned, given that he isn’t yours.”
"We'll ask Crabbe and Goyle."  She reiterated.
"Its beautiful, sir."
"The war?"
“You don’t have to.”  Harry said quickly, even though he wasn’t sure that was true.  “You can go back to England,” and then without conscious permission, “or you can come and stay with me.”
Snape’s face was very still.  “It is.  And I gave it to Draco.”  When Hogwarts was attacked, Harry remembered in a rush, and Snape must have never taken it back.
