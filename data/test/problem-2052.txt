“Okay, Harry. I am going to put in an order for some school things for you, so you will have them by Wednesday. I assume you need school robes as well?” Snape asked softly, though he knew the boy couldn't hear.
His godfathers shared a look. “Come on, what’s wrong pup?” Sirius asked, crouching down next to Remus on the child’s other side.
At some point though, Harry got lost in the crowd of people and lost his family and friends. He looked around the crowd of unfamiliar faces and struggled to not panic. He couldn’t find them, but he saw three other children standing with what looked to be their parents and decided to go ask if they could help him. One of the children was a tan girl with shoulder-length black hair, one was an african american boy, and the other was a boy with pale blond hair and skin. He tugged on the blond one’s sleeve. “Um, hi. I lost my family, do you think that you and your parents could help find them?” there was a slight tremor in his voice.
Draco sat down next to him, and Pansy and Blaise sat down in front of them on the other side of the compartment.
Harry looked at the man in shock. He wasn't angry that he was the freak who had gotten his things destroyed by his relatives because he was bad? That didn't make any since. “Y-your getting me n-new supplies? But I don't deserve them.”
He didn't want to disappoint the man who was helping him so much though, so he followed him in silence.
”Thank you.” Harry managed, though it can out even quieter than normal. He couldn't express how grateful he was to his new friends, and to Professor Snape. He had never thought that he would be given the chance to be happy, that he deserved to be happy. That he deserved things like gifts and friends, and that people could even stand to be around a freak like him, because that was always what his aunt and uncle had always told him. He just hoped with all that he had in him that they wouldn't decide that he wasn't worth it anytime soon and prove his relatives right.
Remus fondly shook his head at his little boys antics from where he was sliding on his shoes a few feet away from him, leaning up against a wall. “Just a moment, Harry. Padfoot is trying to get a few things settled for our picnic.”
Hermione pulled away after a moment, and rested both of her hands on his shoulders and squeezed them comfortingly. “Harry, of course it's not going to be exactly the same. Too much stuff has happened there for that to be the case. But, every great home has its scratches, it's what you make of them that affects the way they make you feel. And, if you want it to feel like home, than it damn well will.”
“That Hogwarts won't feel like home anymore. I don't think that I'd be able to cope with it if it didn't…” Harry finished, the familiar subdued expression back on his face.
Definitely not reassured, Harry became even more nervous, and closer to panic, but put on a mask he had learned to master to hide his emotions.
Malfoy was shocked to the point that this time he didn’t even bother schooling his expression and a contemplative expression mixed in with the shocked one. A moment passed, and then he gave him a small smile. “Okay Potter,” he started softly (and maybe even hopefully), “truce.”
“Um, I have no idea what you just said, you talk way too fast and I couldn’t read your lips.” He pointed to his ears shyly, “I’m, um, deaf.”
The Professor stopped the interrogation and instead decided to explain what the answers were. “For your information, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so potent it is known as The Draught Of The Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and will save you from most poisons.”
He grinned at him. “She really likes you. The only other people she ever does that too are Luna and I.”
Harry smiled, eyes getting slightly glassy from how amazing it was to have a friend. “Thank you Draco. I-” Harry didn't get to finish his sentence before Draco’s head suddenly shot up towards the front and he turned around and gave him an apologetic look.
Pansy, Blaise, and Draco were looking at him in astonishment as they walked to Charms. “You actually enjoyed that?” Braise asked him with raised eyebrows.
The man eyed the class again. “Well, why aren't you all copying this down?” he asked in a chilly voice and everyone but Harry hastily scrambled for a quill and began taking notes.
It immediately became apparent to her why Severus had brought him to her. He was far, far to skinny and short for his age and his cheeks that should still be slightly pudgy with youth, were hollow and sunken in. He was slightly paler than he should have been, his skin an almost sickly color and with dark circles under his eyes. All of the signs pointed very strongly towards severe Malnutrition, and she had a strong, horrible feeling that it wasn't the only terrible thing the poor child suffered from.
Harry nodded his head mutely, scurrying into the bathroom and into a hot stream of water. He didn’t care that the water was almost scalding his skin, he didn’t notice the temperature as much as the feeling of tears running down his face and joining the water swirling down the drain.
Dumbledore nodded his head in agreement before meeting Harry’s eyes, “For young Mr. Potter you did well to disarm your opponent and come to the aid of your friend. However, you used excessive force after you had removed Mr. Smith’s wand. I’d still like to reward you with five points for Gryffindor. This is an important lesson, Harry, holding back can be just as important as acting.”
Tony groaned rubbing a hand over his face as he wondered why his apology wasn’t enough, those were in short supply and came at no small deficit to his ego.
“They’re on the ceiling too…” Harry noted, though he had to squint to make out the tiny letters. The group was stunned, all of these dark wizards and witches, there numbers seemed staggering, but so few had ever been confirmed by any Ministry records and court cases. All of these people hiding in plain sight and they had been for centuries while attending classes at Hogwarts then beyond.
The peacock that Ollivander owns is a part of the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone video game from way back in the day. I gave the peacock the name Ijdel, which means ‘vain’ in Dutch. There was an interesting piece of advice that Ollivander gave Harry in the game that I thought could be important
This for their own protection in case they are seen, Malfoy hair and Black family grey eyes are very recognizable so it is better to be safe than sorry. Someone with recognizable traits like Draco would not be able to go out into the wizarding world as he is despite the Malfoys never declaring that they had a child in any public record. The hood and veil are also a symbol of how dark wizards and witches are forced to remain faceless in society for their own safety.
They didn’t demonize the dark, but they had never defended it to Harry either. Of course this would be the result! With the rest of the wizarding world and families like the Weasleys speaking of the dark with only malice, this was the only possible outcome.
Typical Asgardian toys and trinkets were also placed within reach. Soldiers, archers, elves, dwarfs, members of the royal family including the brothers themselves, were carved into intricate stone figures. Soft figures of winged horses, hounds, and other animals that were seen across the nine realms were tucked away. Perhaps they were childish, but some were Loki and Thor’s own from when they were small.
Recently, Draco’s odd behavior had continued. Severus watching with pinched brows as his protege seemed to become obsessive over a random topic at the drop of a hat. For a week, the young Malfoy tore apart the library for every book on runes he could get his hands on. Writing out what Severus assumed were translations in different runic alphabets and groaning when it was not to the long haired boy’s liking.
While the members of the light might not recognize the subtle differences, they screamed blatantly to those with dark upbringing. The position on the hand when shaking, wrist slightly turned out more than normal, this way it would be easy to summon a wand from an arm holster. The way one never bowed with feet together, so a quick escape could be made. Even the way Harry waved was telling of secrets, show both the front and back of the hand to show no hidden vial, weapon, or mark to reveal that here was no intent to bring harm to another.
Hagrid’s words came back to Harry, these creatures were using their own bodies to shield the boy from any threat. They circled tightly around him and their sharp hooves and beaks would do damage to many a creature. Unsure of what to do, Harry hovered his broom higher into the air so he could see into the circle that the thestrals were forming unimpeded. Getting a clear shot at the other still seemed unlikely even at this new angle and Harry was conflicted about trying to send a spell when it might hit a thestral instead. His knowledge about the creatures was still oh so limited. Would a spell bounce off their hides, would it send them into a rage, would it accidentally kill the beasts? The thestrals had done nothing to Harry and if he caused them great harm, what would that make him compared to the ministry run Gatherers?
All the hooded figures bowed their heads in acceptance to the words, the speech was not solemn in tone, no it was only logical, truthful, and welcoming. Harry supposed if he had to compare it to something that he had heard before, he would say that it reminded him of the opening or closing feast speeches at Hogwarts. It might be a little boring to those that had heard it before, but every year it still brings a feeling of nostalgia and excitement for what was to come next in one’s life.
“What a load of waffle.” Ron finally grumbled as he stuffed some steak and kidney pie into his mouth.
Neville was spending more time in the Greenhouses, still trying to study and identify the samples he had taken from dried plants he had found in the shedding room the year before. Professor Sprout seemed happy enough to have his help as the plants were doing rather poorly with change of colder temperatures and effects that the wraith ‘guards’ held on plants, animals, and people alike.
“It’s horrid!” Draco’s declaration didn’t hold much water though as after a few moments, he took another sip of the bubbly drink. This time his throat spasmed only a tiny amount. Peter was smirking as he watched Draco gradually increase his sips to the appropriate guzzling speed that most American teenagers had when drinking soda or pop. The name depended on where in the states you were, Peter didn’t point out such as he didn’t think that Draco would be very impressed by the information anyway.
“What? But I know what I heard, maybe it was someone in a different carriage then,” Harry reasoned, but the others only shook their heads.
Regulus’ held out his hand and smiled as his brother put his right in it unflinchingly. Using the knife, Regulus made a rather deep cut into the tip of Sirius’ right index finger and instructed him to trace along the entire border of the map. Sirius shivered as he repeated the words Regulus whispered, feeling the magic settling into his skin from the map and Severus as the part vampire swiped his wand in delicate patterns in the air.
The majority of the Avengers hadn’t seen Loki in three years. Tony had quickly slipped back into familiar territory of making snide and underhanded remarks, ready and waiting for Loki to return turn for turn. He shouldn’t have been surprised, but he was, that Draco had rose to Loki’s defense. Now Tony realized that not everyone had as shitty a father like he did.
Leather trousers became a pair of black skinny jeans tucked into mid-calf high tastefully weathered dark brown boots with a slight heel. A sleeveless tight, emerald green top under an equally sleeveless long black cardigan shawl that would be light enough to be comfortable in the heat of New York’s summer. The jewelry that Draco wore remained in place, the braided bracelet on his right wrist made of leather and multiple different colored thread like strands, and the necklace with the pendant of the silver and gold intertwined snakes sat just below his collarbones on clear display. His long hair changed from its former style slightly. The strands of emeralds and silver chain that had been weaved into his locks had been vanished from sight, they were still there just charmed to be invisible at the moment.
I catch you outside of the dorm after curfew. I think I taught you how to sneak better than that though.” Remus added with a wink.
“Now, copy down the following, please.” She rapped on the chalkboard with her wand making the words ‘Course Aims’ appear.
The sensation was like breaking through to the surface after being submerged in a cool lake. It made Draco gasp as if his lungs had been deprived of air for far too long. He stumbled, trying to regain his balance as he took in his alien surroundings. The world had gone blurry and muffled moments after Draco had first met eyes with that raven haired man.
“I don’t know, they’re all coming here, but I don’t know if they were attacked or-” Harry’s words were cut off as something bright caught their attention from the left. All eyes and wands turning towards the source.
There was a shelf of high quality cauldrons to one side and an adjoining shelf that had numerous vials of different ingredients. Swallowing Harry lifted a hand to pick one of them up, when no shock or other obstacle tried to stop him he brought the small glass container closer to his eyes. Smearing the dust and grime off he could see in small neat handwriting
going to let Lockhart get away with his horrible deeds and this time I wanted him to pay more for what he did. Smith is not supposed to fill the role of Draco is this story, as my beta said Draco is a level of extra that no other student besides Harry could fill. Smith’s main purpose is to be an occasional pain in the group’s side and to show that even without the presence of the dark magic users in the Wizarding World, there is still discrimination and lack of respect towards muggleborns by many
Kreacher offered a wrapped package for Draco which he took and slipped into one of the pouches hanging from his belt. It was the lunch that the elves had prepared for him that he could eat during his journey through the sprawling forest. His mother handed him a tin of the honey ginger strips, from Severus a pouch that no doubt held various potions and medical supplies, and Regulus gave him a small book that held songs and poems that had been written since last Midsummer by the youths of the coven.
Honestly, Harry wasn’t sure if this would even work, but he suspected that Draco must be in the forest far earlier than nightfall to call the herd to him. The trick was finding him, the dark children seemed to have a schedule to keep to on Midsummer’s Night. If Harry wanted to speak to Draco without the fear of a time limit hanging over both of their heads, it was best to find him as soon as possible.
Both Remus and Sirius were excited to see what the twins would give Harry. However, the twins told Harry as they handed over a suspiciously plainly wrapped package that he should wait to open it at Hogwarts, more specifically in the common room. McGonagall had cleared her throat at the words, but Fred and George only sent her an innocent look.
The God of Mischief grimaced at the other’s words, but remained resolute as he replied with a stubbornly set jaw and flat tone, “That is how
An image of the disfigured, bloody features and mangled ears came back to Sirius’ mind, “As for identifying the house elf, she was hit with a severe stinging hex to the face and probably several cutting charms. Someone wanted us to not recognize her, most likely her killer.”
Harry stared at the words as they appeared, it was a short response. Formal and blunt, a great contrast to the frenzied splotchy messages that had whizzed past Harry’s eyes on the previous pages.
Harry didn’t drink the cocoa, the thought of putting anything in his stomach made him feel nauseous. But the heat worming its way through the ceramic and into his skin was comforting. He glanced around the room, his friends were all sitting in the couches and chairs by him, waiting for Cedric, Seamus, and him to compose themselves before pouncing for answers once more. Charlie and Bill stood in one corner, it seemed that the eldest Weasley was trying to calm the other down as Harry was certain that he heard a whisper of the name ‘Andre’ from time to time.
“Dreadful, I feel that my mother and her mother would have been personally offended at that display.” Draco mocked while running a finger under Thuban’s head.
But for the family he gained and hoped to keep, Sirius couldn’t completely lament his past decisions.
“I take offence to that.” The Black answered, but there was a smile that could be heard in his voice. “But you’re right.”
Black, you have no right to keep me here! I am a pure-blood wizard, I won’t stand here and listen to your lies.”
It was time from presents after they had almost stuffed themselves to bursting with both savory and sweet foods. Harry kind of felt like he was rolling rather than walking back to the parlor, while Harry didn’t find himself wanting for anything in particular he was curious about what laid inside of the many brightly covered packages he found at his feet as he settled on the couch with Ron and Hermione on either side of him.
The trio were in shock, Neville stuttered out as his eyes flashed around the windows of the small hut, making sure that they didn’t have any listeners. “Hagrid, are you mad!? This… this could land you in Azkaban.”
The man was strung-out physically and mentally. His entire world had been shattered on Samhain’s blessed night. The time that should have been one of peace and ritual had been ruined by the screech of the wards Sirius had secretly placed around his dear friend’s home falling.
Severus did not believe what he read in Tobias’ note, that the man committed suicide to rid himself of the taint that Elieen had left upon him and the world.
“But they grew it back. I don’t get what’s the big deal?” Ron asked, head tilting to the side as he cautiously peeled himself from the door and sat on the edge of Harry’s bed. Neville and Harry seemed to be of the same confused opinion as they sat down on their own mattresses, Harry bumping shoulders with his redheaded friend.
The magic around the two was almost palpable with how strong and large their reserves of it were. However, it was the younger that Loki felt he was being pulled towards. Yet he was no more than a
“Yes, though it was Lupin that actually purchased them for me, the wolf is the one that knows his way around Muggle London.” Severus answered, never pausing in his actions.
“Yes, most things are settled, there is only one uncertain variable left.” Snape mused, finally putting his book down and turning to face his old tormentor fully.
So uh, I started a discord server with people from another discord server I'm part of(which is focusing on FrostIron, the pairing of TonyLoki).
The magical object must have busted a few stitches of the centuries Harry finally decided, trying to push the entire event out of his mind. It was early morning and he had risen far earlier than his dormmates who, much to Harry’s pleasure, included Ron and Neville.
The following morning the Avengers, minus Thor and his family, assembled upon the table on the communal floor. FRIDAY had woken them at a time that they would finish getting ready and still be early to the table before the Asgardians. It was done with the purpose of revisiting what had happened the night before and the shitshow they had woken up to.
The journal breathed against his knee and Harry realize a way that he could get his focus on the class. He’d find a way to write Draco a message using only the many runes in his books. See if he could stump the other teen and make him ask for a translation, which Harry would provide… eventually.
Pride, it was easy to see that was what Draco held towards his values and traditions. It was something that Harry could play on, much like how Sirius did with the fools in the Wizengamot with backhanded compliments while scheming to put moral blocks in front of laws they wished to pass. Still Harry knew that Draco wasn’t stupid, the way he tensed up at the suggestion was obvious enough.
a certified potions’ master now, the head of the house of Black had gotten the certificate during the school year. While he wasn’t the youngest to ever have received the title, Sirius did now hold the record for receiving it in the shortest amount of time since submitting his application.
. It’s sickening really, we are anything but, just because we have been forced into the shadows does not mean that we are not proud. That we are not something great.”
The man nodded his head as the students said the word and asked them to say it once more before continuing his explanation as he brought forth his own wand, ten and a quarter inches of cypress with a unicorn hair core.
Draco had taken to walking slowly around the edge of the clearing, most likely to work out any tension that had built up in his legs from the dance. It was when the blond was on the other side of the clearing from Harry’s hiding spot that the watcher saw his plan finally be put into action. The dark wizard had stiffened and took two quick, but long steps backwards head tilted downwards as he stared at something in the grass.
The horse seemed to know where to go turning without prompting towards the north and starting forward with a press from the boy’s legs. The herd moved as one, weaving their way through the darkness of the forest and Harry found himself drifting after them. He was careful to not get too close to the small balls of fire that swayed gently through the air, blessing the pilgrimage with just enough light to see by human eyes. The forest seemed to part before them, the group seeming to know how to pick trails that would never have been found by Harry even after a decade of wandering.
The eyes, those were the most disturbing feature to Harry. They were large and milky with no visible pupil to speak of. A few of the beasts turned their heads towards him and Harry felt like they had no trouble seeing right through his invisibility cloak. They made no move to attack him, no their focus remained on following the voice just like their unwitting human companion.
The boy, Draco, had not moved from his place. His unusual eyes flickering in the direction his guardian had disappeared and where the source of the strange feeling stood hidden. Loki decided that it wouldn’t remain so as he silently melted out of the shadows to step closer to the little wizard. Watching in amusement as the grip Draco had on the book’s spine relaxed.
But Regulus would have been proud of him for these thoughts and that was reason alone that Draco wouldn’t say it aloud. After all, Regulus was also the master poet of the clan and all songs and performances had to be approved by him and a panel of the other masters of music and dance before being shown to others at celebrations. Regulus was the second busiest individual in the coven during these pivotal events, Lucius being the most.
“He is small, brother. A Midgardian does not belong on Asgard with a race of warriors, unlike you, even with the aid of magic. He will age and perish in a blink of our eyes.” Hadn’t Loki said something similar to him an age ago? Warning that he was a fool for growing attachments towards delicate mortals? It had been made painfully obvious to Thor from the events with Jane that certain relationships were doomed to fail between gods and humans.
“There was something odd, you taught us about dementors before and how they affect a person, but…” Harry found his words trailing off, was he crazy? The others in the carriage hadn’t heard a thing. “It was like the world became muffled, there was someone screaming. I know I heard it, but no one else did.”
Despite the loss of their wands, Fred and George still looked pleased with themselves and the compartment slowly quieted once more though giggles still popped up from time to time at Lee’s flushed face and twisted dreads. The wands would probably not be returned until they settled back into Gryffindor Tower, a punishment that the two seemed to silently accept as they didn’t try to steal them back. They knew when to pull back on their teasing, they didn’t want to end up with a tarantula on their faces when they woke up in the morning either.
An infamous and secretive eighteenth-century duelling club, which called itself The Silver Spears, was reputed to admit only those who owned aspen wands. Garrick Ollivander often found that aspen wand owners are generally strong-minded and determined, more likely than most to be attracted by quests and new orders; this is a wand for revolutionaries.
The order prompted a flinch from Harry, but he forced his head to rise and finally met the grey eyes that had been scorching the top his head with their intensity. An audible swallow escaped Harry as he waited for Sirius to strike his way into his mind.
They lapsed into a comfortable silence for a while, the morning was still hours from rising, but it meant little to them. Both of them enjoyed the night as much or more so than the day. Severus knew that Regulus did not have any lessons to teach tomorrow and that he’d most likely sleep the day away after penning a letter of interesting vernacular towards his brother to be popped by Kreacher.
“I believed the jury is still out on that last part, Draco.” Harry answered, Draco was all wit and sophisticated snark and Harry was just beaming under his hood. Still Harry was raised with the clever tongued Sirius who had his very own brand of sarcasm and snippy comebacks for all occasions. Remus was also never one to back down from a verbal battle, though his remarks were always more backhanded and thoughtfully biting if he was truly pushed. Sometimes, the Black household bickered for the sake of exercising their vocabulary and cleverness. When Tonks and Andromeda were added to the mix, things could get even more nasty, the two Black women could leave anyone limping away to lick their metaphorical wounds if they teamed up on the same target. Tonks would provide exaggerated visuals for her quips with her shapeshifting ability. Ted usually stayed silent during those dinners nursing a very large pint of beer.
“Don’t waste your breath, it’s obvious now that we have been too lenient with the youth if they have become jaded towards peace.” The larger rider snapped back, making Draco flinch at the harshness of his tone, then with a click of his heels into Vielantiu’s sides the stallion was off, taking four quick fast strides before lifting himself up into the air with powerful beats of his wings.
“I don’t want to hold something whose neck will break if I move wrong! I definitely don’t want to be held responsible for accidentally dropping the savior of the wizarding world!”
“From your expression, that scream’s cause was something that you wouldn’t just forget ‘either.” Sirius muttered, running a hand through his hair. “I’m sorry.”
“Of course, he does.” Sirius scoffed, not pointing out that experimental breeding was against the law.
Some of the conversation in Riddle House has been taken from the books and the movie, but a lot of it I edited and added to.
The Harry a few years ago wouldn’t have cared or would have declared that it was proof that dark magic users were inherently
The other children had answered: “In order to win, it is pure magic.”. What was the meaning behind these words, did dark wizard truly believe that if given a choice that magic would choose them over magickal folk of mixed blood? What was it that the dark wanted to win? Was it really as simple as genocide as the books claimed?
Draco felt dread as he looked at the pensive, he didn’t want to see what his father was so certain would change his opinion. He wanted to hang onto the dream he had concocted with his friends over late nights and imaginings since they were small. A glance up at his father’s face told Draco that he had no choice in the matter. If he did not face this with bravery, well, Draco felt that he would be seen as not only vacillating, but also a coward.
A chain was easy to replace, the pendant was the true prize and what the dark wizard was so eager to re-obtain.
“Because I can’t even remember doing the impossible.” Harry agreed scornfully, hand reaching up to touch the scar upon his brow. She was right, typically was and Harry was usually in agreement with her findings even, but it was still a bitter potion to swallow, like over seeped betony tea.
Then Harry realized that breathing was not the only thing that Draco was doing, he had begun to sing, voice mixing pleasantly with that of the girl’s still resonating out of the book on what seemed to be a constant repeat with the instruments that kept time with their movements.
The battle was ended abruptly with the sound of a snap echoing and the force of magic that ripped the siblings away from each other.
Tracy the one whom just now lowered the magical barrier, flicked her wand at her own face summoning a wind so strong it threw off not only her hood, but also the veil which she scrambled to catch before it drifted further into the air with a twinkling laugh as her brown curls bounced across her shoulders, green eyes looking back towards the last still hooded figure and the veiled Millicent.
“It has been stated in multiple reports from witnesses from the night before that Lord Black was seen dueling with the attackers and aiding the injured.” Shacklebolt affirmed, not reacting to the stink eye the squat witch sent him.
The thoughts were hitting him like a troll’s club, but he was still pulled out of them by Hermione’s muted shriek at the sight of Thuban slithering out of the right arm of Harry’s sweater.
Sirius’ father had been killed by a Muggleborn wizard who thought that old immediately meant Dark in regards to Wizarding families during the war… That is what Harry had been led to believe anyways, what if the truth was the Muggleborn hadn’t been completely wrong? Were Sirius’ parents truly Dark after all?
do was find a way to deal with the situation while still keeping his familial secret. Thankfully, he found a way that would pass off as a simple birthday present to his godson. That is… if Harry would take it.
It was strange, that at the current moment Severus was holding a child that he practically considered his own with these thoughts rolling through his head. Cradling Draco as the babe’s eyelids were obviously growing heavy he sang the song he had heard from the window of an old washer woman’s home in Cokeworth.
“Is she serious?” Ron asked, confused and disturbed by the idea that they were living inside something that was, in a sense, alive and had hidden motives.
First they focused on just getting Harry used to stepping and prancing about the natural flooring, making him used to how to correct his posture and balance whenever he stepped into a dip or raised patch in the earth. The next step, was murmured into Harry’s ear, though Draco had to lift himself slightly on his toes to do so as he kept his grip firm on the raven, “Now, I want you to
also represents meanings of wealth, extravagance, creativity, wisdom, dignity, grandeur, devotion, peace, pride, mystery, independence, and magic. The color purple has a variety of effects on the mind and body, including uplifting spirits, calming the mind and nerves, enhancing the sacred, creating feelings of spirituality, increasing nurturing tendencies and sensitivity, and encouraging imagination and creativity. Purple is associated spirituality, the sacred, higher self, passion, third eye, fulfillment, and vitality. Purple helps align oneself with the whole of the universe.
Remus and Sirius worried that Harry would become yet another brainwashed member of the light who believed whatever he was told to.
“While that is an act worthy of the courageous Gryffindor, I see that Smith is looking… A little less for the wear.” Dumbledore’s words were kind, but also disapproving as he watched Sprout fuss over her charge. She had an annoyed look on her face but seemed to believe what Longbottom said. Neville had built a large repertoire with the Herbology teacher for his grades, love of plants, and the fact that he spent quite a bit of time outside of class in the greenhouses.
The Nimbus rose a few feet off the ground at the order, before slowly drifting back down to the earth before it finished its journey to Draco’s hand. His head turned towards Harry once more and while he appeared to be composed, Harry could practically taste the dismay that rolled off the other teenager. It was only then that Harry realized how important that this might be for him. Draco said that his kind never rode brooms because of the tight brush, but broomsticks had long been in the history of magic. Reclaiming something that the dark’s youth had lost the opportunity to enjoy or master was a fevered hope that Draco seemed to believe was impossible by his early failure.
“Merry part,” Sirius answered as he watched them disappear into the gloom of the dungeons. He sighed as he knew that he would not be able to provide one on one guidance on his own.
which means "Always Pure" in French. It reflects their dedication to their beliefs, being members of the Sacred Twenty-Eight and following the ways of the Dark from their ancestors. The Blacks, in canon and indeed in this fic, place a great importance on blood purity, considering themselves akin to royalty in the wizarding world and disdaining Muggles, Squibs, blood traitors, and Muggle-borns.
The creatures that had accompanied the dark children that night had been easy to look up and research, but Harry lamented the fact that they would be unable to interact with any of these creatures until they entered their third year of studying with the care of magical creatures class. Obviously beasts like thestrals would not be included in that class since the herd hidden in the forbidden forest was supposed to have been wiped out.
Then Harry was stepping down the stairs, his steps echoing in the silence of the dungeons as everyone else should have gone to the feast. With the frigid bowels of the castle holding one of Harry’s favorite subjects, he’d never felt trepidation in the descent below the earth and Black Lake. That wasn’t the case now as the hair on the back of his neck and arms rose.
. Each name with its corresponding portrait, by either paint or film, wearing the same crest even if the color and style of the uniform changed with the period.
The light that came in through the windows grew ever dimmer and Loki flicked his fingers to light a fire in the hearth along with the candles that dotted the room. The light was soft and comforting, currently the bookshelves that were built into the walls laid barren. Pursing his lips he realized that wouldn’t do, this place was far too empty and cold. The enchanted sleep would most likely last for a few more hours as Draco’s mind and magic stabilized from expressing his Jotun form, adjusted to the atmosphere of Asgard, and dealt with the trauma of what he had learned in such a short amount of time.
The boy snorted at this, muttering as he continued his petting, “Behold the fearsome steed of my godfather.”
“I too have noticed that you seem… distracted as of late.” Severus murmured as he painted another rune on the upper arm of his godson. Narcissa made a soft noise of agreement to their observation. The Malfoy heir had been doing the herd gathering night ride by himself since he was eight, so they didn’t believe that he had a case of sudden nerves of going out on his own into the forest he had grown up in. That meant that there had to be something else on his mind.
?! FRIDAY, he’s trying to kill me.” Stark whined as the doors started to close again, Loki smirked as he heard the AI’s answer before the penthouse disappeared from view, “The attempt has been recorded, boss. However no emergency protocol has been triggered as Ms. Potts has made similar statements.”
“But the Ministry wouldn’t listen ta reason. Ordered the herd ta be culled. I couldn’t let that happen. I just couldn't. So, I led them deeper inta the forest and that’s where they stay. Told the Ministry I killed the lot of them like they said to. Th’y weren’t about ta go inta the forest to check for 'emselves, the ruddy yellow-bellied cowards.”
“I will give you a two part gift.” Draco finally declared, there was a curve to his smile that made Harry believe that the dark wizard had discovered how to use this to his advantage somehow as the other seemed to have calmed down suddenly and immensely, casually brushing down his cloak now without twitching fingers.
“Well, what does it look like? Where is it?” Harry was quick to try and pacify Draco, he was curious, after all, it was just revealed to him that Hogwarts had her own, literal, dark secrets.
“I want Harry growing up in the world of his parents. I know James suspected the truth about me with his mother being a Black herself, but…” Sirius trailed off, fingers trailing through the thick dark fluff that sat on the top of his godson’s head.
There was the feeling of familiarity and peace that one had with the dangers that they knew. With how heavily warded and charmed the forest was from the rest of the world, the idea of an enemy unknown was not likely.
“You’re excused, you have a paper to start writing anyway. You can choose to write in either the library or your room.” Sirius muttered, picking up his own piece of toast as Harry hurried out of his seat and out of the dining room. Neither of the older wizards wanted to watch Harry pout, sulk, and fume.
“What’s so special about a piece of jewelry?” Harry put his hands up in a placating gesture at the venomous expression that he was sent. Impressive that indeed when Harry couldn't see the other's eyes. “Hey, if I’m going to risk detention, expulsion, and house points I wanna know exactly what I’m getting into for.”
Harry shifted a hand over the inner pocket of his robes where the journal sat as he felt it give a small breath. It was a wonder and a complete accident that Harry had stumbled upon Draco four years ago. He wasn’t quite brave enough to bring the journal out into the open. While there were similar ones for sale everywhere, Harry needed time to come up with a lie on who he was sending messages to.
He knew what Draco meant, that he needed to listen as he did when casting. To remain connected to the natural world around them  and have it work with them rather than against them or disregarding it. Those had been Draco’s words a year ago, still Harry was disappointed that he still could not hear magic like the blond claimed to.
Glancing at the display of floors on the side of the elevator, Peter reached forward to press the one that was a few buttons below the currently lit selection.
Silence greeted him as the students looked between themselves, but all eyes eventually drifted towards one person.
“You love us.” Harry reminded as he reached into his pack and threw a chocolate frog box to Ron to appease him for the coming talking of
“There’s not enough proof to say that.” George pointed out, Fred nodded his head as he glanced about the room, “After all, we’re in here and we’re not dark wizards, at least not that we know of. I don’t see anything that has their names on it either.”
“You promise?” Remus sounded doubtful, like he expected Sirius to conveniently forget whatever he was swearing.
Now things were settling down, but unfortunately Draco was not. Both Lucius and Narcissa had finally been chased out of the nursery by Severus when he had witnessed how both fair haired parents were practically swaying on their feet. The potion master had berated them for their carelessness of their own health while giving them the boot to their bed. Narcissa had wanted to argue and tried to turn right back around when she had heard her baby let out another wail, but Severus had braced himself at the door and Lucius finally coaxed her away with some difficulty, promising that she need only take a short bath and nap with him.
The God of Thunder remained in the doorway of the heir’s suite, watching as the boy looked out at the distant stars with a look of pain and sadness upon his face as he was forced to make a choice that would uproot all he had known and believed through his, admittedly short, life. Thor did not want to potentially undo all his brother’s work, but he could not simply stand and watch Draco’s idle suffering.
pity Remus for dealing with the fallout of Sirius realizing that Harry was ‘missing’. While the werewolf had comforted Harry the night before, he was more than a little bitter about the man keeping Sirius’ secret. The festering anger, frustration, and fear from it all; it made Harry feel nauseous. If anyone had asked about his off color, he’d blame it over breakfast not settling well.
This is the Blasting Curse, it causes anything that the spell comes into contact with to explode, and presumably thereafter burst into flame. This spell creates large amount of heat to build rapidly of whatever it is inside. I think that this is definitely a favorite spell of Seamus with his fondness for pyrotechnics.
Sirius has an aggressive and territorial personality which matches to this beast, Black is also fitting for the family is it not?  The white of an Aspen wand hiding inside of it the core of something
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. Potter.” Umbridge corrected with her pouchy eyes on him, still a smile upon her face. “You are right, however, to assume as much.”
Even now, sitting in the overstuffed leather armchair before the fireplace as he was, Sirius hadn’t quite rid himself of the adrenaline induced daze that had engulfed him at the sight of the Dark Lord’s mark twisting upon itself above the quaint little home of the man he had come to see as his brother. James Potter and Lily Potter nee Evans were dead, leaving Sirius to remember how the stars that winked back at him that night seemed so cold and cruel as he stood among the wreckage and bodies.
Draco absorbed all of the information offered, breaking the dialogue from time to time with sarcastic comments and expressions of disbelief or disgust. The blond had a lot of questions regarding the Slytherin house and Harry found himself coming up empty for anything to say about the serpents. He had been at Hogwarts for two years and he hadn’t had any interactions with the green wearing students that extended past handing assignments or parchment over to them during class.
The dark hood cocked slightly, and Harry was certain that under the veil Draco had risen a brow as he spoke, “Was it not you that extended the first word? Rather presumptuous of you, but I suppose that can be forgiven. You clearly are not from around here.”
“Yeah, right then.” Sirius cleared his throat and straightened up while pulling Harry into a quick, but strong hug which was returned in the same style. “Love ya, pup.”
“The house elves, I had read about their existence a few weeks ago. I find their servitude absolutely abominable. They are sold and traded between families with absolutely no regard to the elves feelings, there’s no system in place to ensure their fair treatment either.” Hermione answered shortly, her chin jutting out slightly in stubbornness as she watched the man.
The rest of the gathering gave short cries of alarm as they scattered out of the way, before seeming to relax as the perpetrators were recognized. Some of the coven were laughing as they called greetings as the charge circled the outer edge of the valley before gradually making their way towards the large bonfire in the center.
They had to time their apparating carefully, if someone heard two pops instead of one suspicions might have been rose with so many eyes still on the duo. The coordination was perfect and they ended up just outside the wards of Black Dog Manor. The wards were ancient and highly tuned to let only specific people inside, Remus would not have been able to apparate inside of them while carrying his passenger, he had to walk through the invisible barrier instead with Sirius’ hand on the child’s shoulder.
Now, when they went out after curfew they left the bracelets in their beds while the twins and Lee would sometimes run interference if Remus was in the area they were wanting to explore. It all seemed to be working well since the werewolf had yet to comment or confront the group during their private lessons. Luna and Ginny had joined them, both of the younger girls proving themselves more than able to keep up with their seniors.
In turn, Harry with reluctance told his version of events, his recount of witnessing the Dark Mark being sent into the sky had Sirius paling before he pressed for more details. Frowning as he listened Sirius muttered to himself, “So we have conflicting reports then.”
Nodding to himself, Tony swung towards the arrangement of liquors that sat behind him on the counter and plucked a bottle from the very back. Yeah, this would do nicely.
“Nothing you’d be interested in, surely, Harry. Since we’d had this almost exact conversation at the beginning of the damn year!” Sirius had hoped, desperately he had, that something had gotten through the thick Potter skull that night months ago.
Clothing that they assumed to be Draco’s size was brought in and stored away, fittings would have to wait for a little while longer. For the time being, there had to be something that could fit the child well enough for when he traveled among the populous.
Severus had been left on the grounds as the Gryffindors departed, thinking back, he remembered how for a short moment Sirius’ eyes had met his own before the Black disappeared with his little entourage. Standing alone he had looked upon the sprawling Scottish landscape for hours as the foliage had been tinged with reds, golds, and then purples of the sunset. He knew it was that moment that he had finally lost her. The last link of the rusting chain between them snapping. Perhaps it was for the best, she was fated to take what she saw as the high, moral road. Severus was left to take what was seen as the lower road, the darker road filled with creatures waiting in shadows and blood.
The day after the catastrophe that was Midsummer’s Night, Draco was unsure of what would await him when his father finally decided to summon him into his presence. His short exchange with Hadrian had settled some of his nerves for the fact that he would not be left in complete isolation. Severus knew of the existence of the journals that connected Draco to his friends inside of the coven, however, this new one went without the potion master’s notice.
Manor reacting to Draco's words, I believe that old magical homes like Grimmuald, Malfoy manors, and Hogwarts are at least partly sentient.
In short, pairing up George and Sirius was a poor mistake on Harry’s part. Then again seeing how Seamus and Dean worked together proved to be impressive, but Seamus would have been better as a beater. Unfortunately, Harry suspected that the Irishman’s temper would prevent him from ever actually getting a spot on the team. Seamus could work effectively with one person, but not with the entire group. The weak links of each team were easy to spot with Tonks’ clumsy aim the bludger was just as likely to head back to her own companions than the other team. Luna was also flying in circles looking more at the scenery and distant towering forest than playing the game.
“Lord Black,” Fudge answered, there was a redness to his cheeks and an unevenness to his breath he was obviously trying to hide. Indeed it seemed that the walk had taken its toll on him. His face visibly brightened though as he looked at the teenager, “Harry, how are you? That was a terrible spot of luck you had last night. How are you feeling?”
“And you know this- how?” Umbridge pressed, to Sirius she looked like an engorged fuzzy spider ready to sink fangs into something that was dangling just above her web.
. You were one of the chief lieutenants, you have vast knowledge of strategy. The way you govern the coven is fair and all adore you. Members of other covens respect your power and wisdom. Why should you not take us higher than the Dark Lord?” Draco pushed, relief flooding him as he was finally able to say these words.
-shrugs- Maybe you guys don’t care about horses, but I’m from Kansas, rodeo country, and have been riding most of my life (I miss it while living in Japan). It’s fun for me to think how magical horses breeds may look and have developed.
“Because that is a price higher than some temporary discomfort.” Draco reasoned, the way  his fingers tapped and twisted on his cloaked arms showed his nervousness, no, fright at the prospect of revealing his whole face.
As the students marched into the Great Hall, it was with a far more subdued air than Harry had ever experienced before. There were few teachers at the head table too, many of the chairs notably left empty to stare out at the arriving children. The headmaster, head of houses, and several other faces were missing. There was also something else to note.
But bitching and whining wasn’t going to do shit. Taking a breath, along with a large gulp of the alcohol, Sirius let his head fall back against the wingbacked chair before the fireplace in the main parlor. The burn was pleasant as it tapered down his throat and pooled in his belly, a welcome distraction.
Harry knew that he was not evil and didn’t believe that he could ever become dark. So, if all Slytherins were destined to meet the same fate, why would the hat see him prospering there?
Tony walked onto the stage first, making his way confidently to the podium, dressed in a charcoal grey pinstripe Armani suit and slacks, the vest a darker grey, and a hot-rod red silk tie finishing the look. His sunglasses hanging out the front pocket of his suit, but at least they were not over his eyes. Pepper would have had his ass for that.
“Why does that matter? It’s not like we are planning on reentering this hypocritical society.” Regulus stabbed back, taking the cup of tea that Kreacher levitated into his hands.
Harry felt like driving his head into the nearest tree in frustration as it seemed all too much to listen for. If he did so, Harry suspected that he would probably be ordered to listen to the sound that his skull made against the bark.
Sirius hummed his acceptance, though it was reluctant. Then the man was rocketing up into a sitting position, grey eyes wild as he exclaimed. “Harry and her better not end up together! Just… no.”
There was a scream of pain to their right, and while it was now a hauntingly familiar sound as it rattled around them, Ron and Harry were stopped dead by the fact that they recognized this voice, along with a second one yelling threats and obscenities.
“Hi. I’m Peter Parker, sorry for fighting you! It’d have been pretty cool if that wasn’t our first impression of each other. Well,
Harry shook his head at the other’s reasoning, even if he did know it made sense. If the Wizarding World was exposed… Still those men, or at least two of them, hadn’t been panicked. The leader had cast the spell as calm as if telling the weather and with just as little remorse.
For now though, he couldn’t let himself wonder about that as he moved towards the main drawing room once more. Only to pause as he caught something from the corner of his eye.
As he set the spoon aside, keeping his hands busy with butchering the rest of the toad carefully and bottling its parts, wasting nothing. Severus finally asked while glancing at Regulus whom had returned to his seat. “While I appreciate your aid, I have to ask why it is you offered?”
The Avengers and SHIELD would work closer together once more in the future, but for now the organization was still rebuilding itself from the ground up with Fury still changing much of its fundamental practices from the debacle with Hydra. Tony would always be keeping that man at arms’ length however and keeping his tech from sticky fingers.
of books of muggle fairy tales, myths, and legends. It looked pretty much like something one might read a child at bedtime, but Harry knew what it really was as did all of his close group of friends prompting them to share a glance.
People were always moved by actions that they could see for themselves. While it was well known that Loki had been coerced in his invasion of Earth and that he had tried to kill Thanos, no one had seen that. Only heard the tales after the fact. Tony didn’t doubt that most of the world had, by now, seen Loki throwing that man into a brick wall while Iron Man watched on.
Sirius refused to teach Harry the cleansing rituals as he could not explain them without coming out as a dark wizard himself. His godson was clever, and he didn’t want to give him any pieces that could lead to him to complete a puzzle that painted Sirius in a very… bad light. There were other ways to get rid of access dark magic, to purge the system of it when the castor was too weak to perform the rituals themselves.
Taking a breath, Harry summoned the Granian quill and the ink well to his hand. He didn’t know if he would send a response, but it was better to be prepared. Piercing the pad of his thumb with barely a flinch as it had become a common occurrence over the past summer, Harry swiped a quick bloody streak across the front page as he spoke the incantation.
“If you want proof, then I shall supply it.” Loki answered evenly, striding over to one of the many gold covered walls that had been polished to the point of acting as a mirror. He didn’t have to check to see if he was being followed, he knew without a doubt that Thor would remain on his heels like one of Odin’s hounds. Setting the child on his feet, while keeping both of his thin wrists in one of his own hands, Loki’s tone was firm, but surprisingly gentle.
“Bloody hell, remind me not to get her truly angry.” Ron whispered in awe and Harry couldn’t help but agree. Neville was laughing under his breath even as he used the spell e
“The prophecy said that a child born as the seventh month dies would be the one to defeat the Dark Lord. When I handed off this information, I had no knowledge that Lily was expecting. The seventh month came and passed, revealing that there were only two children that matched the prophecy’s description. The Potters’ and the Longbottoms’.” Severus’ voice had dropped to a mere whisper, but in the silence, there was nothing else to cover up his guilt.
The two former Deatheaters worked in a quick tandem together and it only took a few moments for Sirius to realize their goal. They were removing certain books. Titles flew past his eyes that he recognized as having been forced to study from them under his parents’ watch. It seemed that any volume that dealt even slightly with dark magic or ideals was being packed away.
Don't be shy, I know there are a lot of readers here that have English as their second and third language.
Derrick, one of the biggest and oldest of the lot, spoke first, eyes looking around the crowd, “Sorry, we’re late.”
“I was hoping that the fates would give us one too, little brother.” Sirius sighed, trying to keep his guilt at bay as Regulus’s grey eyes looked out at him beseechingly.
” The god spread his arms to encompass first his body then the landscape around them giving a twirl for dramatic emphasis, “is no curse. This is your birthright. The norns have given you the privilege to be born of my blood. What runs through your veins is not some poison. It is proof to your power, to your claim to the throne, to my tutelage. To knowledge and mastery you would have never gained in your old life.”
“Well, we can’t exactly know that for certain,” Umbridge answered sweetly as Harry looked at her aghast, “Mr. Potter and his friends could have fled into the forest without the use of magic if they had found the proper authorit-”
The young wizard ignored the girl, reaching down and picking something up. As he turned back around it was revealed that he now held a limp squirrel. The apparent victim of the curse. As Blaise walked back to the group he offered it to Hrimfaxi who devoured the rodent eagerly, rewarding the wizard for the treat by letting him touch her and getting a passing brush of his fingers over Enbarr’s flank before the filly skittered away again.
gotten to choose, he had pleaded with the Sorting Hat not to place him in Slytherin four years ago. Did the hat listen to him because he had equally Slytherin and Gryffindor traits while the rest of the Slytherins did not so they could not switch to a different house? Was that fair? He had a feeling that his assumption was correct. The hat was charmed to be unbiased, cared not for anyone’s past or family, had no use for money or anything that a mortal being could be brided with. It saw into one’s mind with complex, ancient magic.
“Try? What’s ‘try’ about it? We know where it is, we just need to get there without bein’ noticed.” Ron asked, taking the napkin away from his sister before she could swat her friend with it for scaring her.
Loki bit back his frustration at the boy’s constant claim that his blood right was a curse: it rang much too close to his previous sentiments.
More students were making their way into the Great Hall now and Remus knew he needed to eat fast, hand out the schedules to his chicks, and then report to his classroom for his first class. He quickly rapped his knuckles against Harry, Ron, Neville, and the twin’s heads sharply, speaking over their yelps, “I have to get going, good luck with your first day. Harry keep an eye out for Adhara, she’ll have Sirius’ response for you.”
Loki was well aware that the Infinity Stones’ destruction had interesting effects on the biology of the Avengers, official and honorary at the time of the battle, some being affected in different ways than others. He was curious just how much had changed, but asking would more than likely bring suspicion. He did not need them thinking that he may be planning to overthrow this world again or something equally ridiculous.
If the stranger was a dark wizard, then Harry worried about sending Sirius into the forest. He loved his godfather, truly, but he was known to fly off the handle. A physical enemy to his family, that was sure fire way to get Sirius rattled and snapping at the end of his leash to get at the threat. There was a good chance that as soon as Sirius learned about the stranger he might go marching into the dark forest to confront him. The stranger had been young and honestly, Harry doubted that he had been alone. There had to be others, either in the distance or unseen that were the guardians and allies of such a young boy.
Once they were out of sight, Harry ducked into a dark alcove. Fumbled with his shoulder bag for a moment to retrieve the Gragain quill to prick his thumb before shoving it back in its hiding place and pulling out a self inking quill instead. While his thumb continued to lightly bleed he got the journal out, swiping the digit across a random page while whispering the incantation.
“Shadow, won’t you stay with me? Nothing’s ever as it seems. Are you wandering just like me? In the endless mist.”
“There, now. That wasn’t too difficult was it? Wands away, children, you won’t be needing them for this class. Quills out.” The demeaning title had some of the students leaving their wands on the desk in silent protest. Harry kept his own in his arm holster. Neville, Hermione, and Ron all had similar ones. The boys, Harry included, had gotten theirs from Ollivander as a gift. Hermione had been given hers by Ron as a surprisingly thoughtful gift last Christmas, though he might have just been against buying another book.
Draco stayed frowning, but his gaze had lost its smoulder, along with the red hue, as Peter continued to list the facts in the prince’s favor. It was obvious that it wasn’t enough for whatever Draco’s problem with Earth and people were. It seemed to have deeper roots than he thought.
Along with their roles in Quidditch, George, Fred, and Lee were busy with the little side business they had developed with selling the contraband they snuck into the castle from Hogsmead and their own creations for both pranks and very creative ways to get out of class. Oddly enough, it seemed that it was George and Lee that were creating the most chaos. Not even together, but in separate actions while Fred smiled with an odd twinkling in his eyes as the two tried to one-up each other.
None of the inhabitants of the Black house seemed pleased as Severus’ comment. After living apart for so long both brothers wanted the chance to reaffirm their bond. The desire had increased threefold now that Sirius was the recognized lord of the family and Regulus was marked as his current heir.
A frustrated frown, but stiff nod showed Hadrian’s agreement. They both knew that there was no way for them to know the other’s intentions or if the words they spoke were the truth. Everything must be seasoned with salt and the fires stroked with an acceptance level of distrust.
“What can I say? The Hat knows best where we belong, it claims to have not made a mistake yet.” Sirius answered coldly, raising his chin as he looked down his nose at the witch, knowing how she detested her minuscule stature. “I found myself quite popular not only in my own house, but with others as well.”
Hermione serves to show how Muggleborn views continued to erode and demonize ancient and sacred traditions of the dark. The light side used the excuse of pandering to Muggleborns to eliminate and target the Dark ways as well. Hermione will learn and develop, but she gives an outside viewpoint compared to Harry, Neville, or Ron's.
He could not move now, couldn’t run away. So, why were they still letting him breathe? Why hadn’t it ended yet?
However it came at no surprise that their group was visited by others. With several recognizable lords, lady, and Ministry officials in their group there were plenty of people that were eager to rub elbows and catch a glance at the potential competition in the gathered heirs.
“Now then, for your homework,” Sirius nodded to Haywood who quickly moved about the room, handing a tome to each student. It was small, just a bit smaller than one’s hand, but three and a half centimeters thick. Many thin pages sat inside, they looked frail, easy to tear, but they were charmed to withstand most ‘accidents’.
“Sorry for intruding,” Harry offered, manners went a long way in first impressions, that’s what he’d always been taught.
Most likely Sirius would be shrugging the issue onto Quirrell, who really was becoming more confident. The Charms professor still seemed content to remain as the Deputy Head of Ravenclaw and not take over, despite it being his school days’ house.
“Is this the thanks I get? I broke so many school rules, found a missing magical item, then saved you from an embarrassing faceplant and I don’t even get a snack for my troubles?” Hadrian groused, though there was a tenseness to his sitting position that showed he was ready to duck or flee if another hex was thrown his way.
Yes, there is still a basilisk hibernating under the school, not sure how I’m going to handle that yet… Ehhhh, crossing that bridge when I get to it I guess.
. For that reason, it was dangerous as the evidence upon the walls stated that others would take shots at the person practicing the steps with more dangerous spells.
Rubbing at his temple and knowing a headache was incoming, Harry couldn’t help but grumble as the memory was stowed away, “Are we done yet?”
In one particular session, the class was flooded with Quidditch players and fans of the sport as Madame Hooch recalled her experiences with Muggle aircrafts and how airspace had been sanctioned for the contrptions by Magical governments across the globe as a result. The referee had retold how one night, during the Great War (1914-1918) or World War I, her Silver Arrow broom was singed by a Muggle anti-aircraft device. Something she found personally insulting much to the amusement of the students, though they would not dare laugh in her intimidating presence.
Harry had the feeling that if he suggested that Draco take both of his hands from the broom he would get something far more powerful than a stinging hex thrown at him.
“Yes, I’ll be your teacher for that. It’s my first year teaching, but after serving as these nuisances’ tutor since they were four I think I can handle whatever is thrown my way.” Chuckled Remus as he ruffled Harry’s hair, much to his complaint as he tried to duck closer to the table to escape the touch causing his nose to almost meet his eggs.
Sirius and many of the Dark were of the opinion that the reason for this was the influence of Muggle culture brought by the Muggleborns. Homosexuality was banned and labeled a sin by many groups in the Muggle world, tacking on the belief that “parents” could only refer to a man and a woman. The fact was, two men and two women could still produce a child through potions and extremely delicate charm work.
The carriages couldn’t fit their entire group, instead they had to space out across three of them. Harry found himself sitting with Hermione, Ron, Neville, and Luna. A glance at his friends’ faces told Harry that they were feeling much the same as himself. Even Luna looked aggrieved as she rung water out of her long locks.
The redheaded twins were grinning, but there was no cheer in their eyes as they kept a tight hold of Smith even as the younger tried to squirm out of their grasps.
“Same to you, Pads. What happened out there?” Harry thought about asking what was so important that the other would speak with Cedric before himself, but honestly, he didn’t want to start a fight after what they had just been through.
In the early years, Voldemort had gathered his supporters by making promises of no longer having to hide their dark magic, being able to prove their worth to society, protecting old traditions, and keeping the magical world safe from muggles that would kill them.
He was surprised that Sirius wasn’t asking to meet him as soon as dinner was over, but after the debacle with the dementors Sirius was probably out for blood. No doubt, Sirius was planning on making both the Ministry and Umbridge feel his fury somehow.
Both eagerness and fear tingled like icy water down Harry’s spine at the words, he had asked for this. That was true, but now faced with the idea of learning and using spells that Deatheaters no doubt did; he felt anxious, wondered if he would still be able to look into the eyes of his friends and family once he returned home. In the end he would have to, because there was no way in hell that Harry was stopping now.
“Silken Haze, so chilly, brushing my skin. Further and further, where shall I find my yearning's goal?” The song had becoming musing once more, before determination was a flame alit with the beat picking up once more and making the teenagers’ steps become faster. “I close my eyes and grow a plumage. I feel the wind already and spread my wings to fly.”
“Umm yeah?” Ron answered, brows pinched as he tried to remember the name of the girl. She seemed to realize this as she continued.
“Katherine Farrel, from the Daily Bugle,” A woman stated as she tapped her pen against the clipboard and pad in her hands. Her shoulder length dark strawberry blond hair was feathery, her painted lips pursed with thinly veiled disdain, “When you say
When the snake had stilled with a put out sigh, Harry reached forward to run a comforting hand down Thuban’s long back, keeping his eyes locked with his
“Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Stark Tower, this conference has been called to discuss the incident that occurred last night and the negative allegations that have been lobbied against Mr. Stark and those involved in the altercation. To clarify, Mr. Stark and his grace, Loki Odinson, shall speak of the events on their own behalf. Questions may be asked after both have made their remarks, be aware that all unsavory or inflammatory inquiries will not be addressed.” Pepper’s voice was crisp, calm, and offering no room for protest. Unflappable even as cameras flashed in her face rapidly and the whispers began as she gave a short nod before walking to the side of the stage.
“I think I’d rather stay here tonight.” Cedric finally answered, head ducking down despite it being a rather ridiculous pose with how tall he was. It was understandable, not yet wanting to return to a home that would forever feel more empty than it had ever been. A hole that would never be able to be filled without a father and husband’s love. Cedric was not ready to face his mother with the news either, not when he was still processing the fact himself.
“Draco.” One word, the other fell silent letting Loki continue, “It is not for your sake that I ask to speak to Thor alone. It is for the good of this city, your presence will only aggravate his bothersome hero complex.”
Harry found it incredibly disturbing how he was able to quote the text word for word, most likely his classmates could do the same now. If one repeated something so many times, did they start to believe it themselves?
There were four figures suspended above the heads of the advancing attackers and Harry knew who, or at least
The two Blacks stared at the scene, Regulus stepping forward to rest a hand on the taller male’s shoulder gently as Sirius watched in awe as Harry lifted his little fingers to brush the tear track running down Severus’ cheek. Those small lips pursed in confusion and thought.
The hand left the curve of Draco’s ass to slide to his front groping at what he found there, “Well I think at least one of us is going to have a good time still.”
Towards the end of Draco’s response, the lines became thicker and the letters further slanted. From this Harry could
If the other boy was knocked out, then it would be all the easier to then take him back to the manor for Sirius and the Aurors to deal with if he was proven to be dark. If Harry didn’t find what he needed he would guard the other until he woke up against any wandering predator.
What will Tony and Loki fine, what retribution will be taken? How will this affect the relations between the Avengers, Peter, and Draco?
“As my brother said, the choice is yours, Draco. Loki delights in creating chaos through mischief, but his words are never without meaning. He has not spoken a lie in your presence. While it might seem impossible considering how little you know of each other, he cares for you greatly.”
“To our new students, I offer Hogwarts’ most warm welcome as you begin your journey down the path of learning what it means to be a witch or wizard. To our returning students, I hope the summer has treated you well and that all are ready to dive back into your studies, but also…” His pale blue eyes looked across the crowd, “perhaps a spot of mischief as well. School never has just one purpose, you see. One does not stop learning once they graduate or have read every book in the library, as impressive as such a feat may be considering ours.”
Pride slowly swelled in Draco’s chest as Loki continued his persuasive speech, but he couldn’t stop the sadness that crept in at the edges of his awareness. Slytherin was his family’s way of life, but it was also his family’s home away from home and it had been for generations, the two were interlinked.
A collection of dried up plants that captured Neville’s interest as he carefully collected a sample of leaves from several of them to study more later. A wall of mirrors whose purpose was unknown to them.  A scattering of splintered and rusting instruments resting on stands.
“They must have done it between lessons.” It only made sense, seeing as Draco was still barred from seeing his friends outside of their studies from the stunt they had pulled on MidSummer’s Night. Lucius was very serious about sticking to the punishments he gave, Narcissa even more so. Severus was snickering now, “It could be worse. They were not belladonna blossoms.”
form. Thinking back, I suppose I noticed the scent before those three even managed the transformation.” The memories, so bitter and sweet now. Ones that inspired laughter and tears in equal measure.
“A handful of decades’ time would not be remiss.” Loki countered, but it was without conviction. Already, the trickster knew that this particular battle of logic and wills was lost to him.
Harry wasn’t quite sure what he was going to say when he did catch up, but all thoughts seized as he was brought up short when two voices greeted his ears as he was about to turn the corner.
The fat cat seemed plenty comfortable in the prince’s arms and had his head resting on Draco’s shoulder, one white mittened paw patting at one of the braids that had come loose from the bun. Murph while not aggressive, was not exactly a cuddly cat as he had been living on the street before being adopted by the family. If Peter hadn’t known Murph before the incident where he had to help Delmar and Murph out of the destroyed deli, then his first costume would have been torn into shreds all the sooner.
It’s a new coat, black and thick looking. When he lifts it out of the box, it falls long and heavy and surely down to his knees at the very least. In the box underneath it is a new hat, scarf, socks, and fur-lined gloves. Draco looks at Potter, slack-jawed and completely speechless.
“What-?” he begins, but as the shape draws nearer and resolves into an ethereal, silvery otter he realises what it is. A patronus.
The librarian catches sight of him and gives him her usual smile. “Hello dear,” she says, as she does every day. Draco returns the smile, genuinely happy to see her friendly face.
Slightly disheartened and determined to cast this line of thought from his mind, Draco picks up the textbook from the sidetable and opens it. He kicks off his boots and tucks his feet under him as he settles in. He’s missed this, losing himself in the study and theory of magic – he’d always been a good student, and the pursuit of knowledge is a challenge that he likes.
Eventually, he needs to piss so he rolls out of bed and pads to the bathroom. He relieves himself quickly and returns to the main room, where he sits on the bed and draws back the curtain, just because he can. The street is busy, for Knockturn standards, and the sun is already high in the sky – it must be nearing noon.
Draco is already fishing his money out of his picket when he registers the price and freezes. Not only is Ugbert not trying to molest him, he’s also charging regular price? He looks up at the other man, jaw slack in surprise.
“Most people don’t,” Draco cuts him off. He himself likely would never have given it a thought were it not for his own circumstances. Worse, his younger self wouldn’t have cared. A lot has changed for Draco, but Potter has never been that selfish.
Potter draws them to a stop then, and he turns to see him watching Draco with a smile. Draco quirks an eyebrow, but Potter merely shakes his head, before turning and gesturing to a tiny shop.
Potter takes his arm as soon as he’s finished putting the book away, half-leading and half-dragging him toward the front of the library. They take a small detour to the section on wizarding law, where Granger is browsing the shelves with single-minded determination, so that Potter can call his goodbyes. He barely waits for her reply before he’s leading Draco away again.
This is the last of what I had written during vacation, so things will definitely slow down now sorry
“Then tell me,” he says earnestly. “Tell me something about you. A story from your childhood maybe?”
Draco shakes his head, tearing his bagel apart and smirking at Potter. “I don’t know,” he replies, “first you bowled me over in the Alley yesterday, and now this.” He sighs dramatically. “I think you will just have to accept the obvious – you are an utter klutz”
Then he rolls his eyes at himself. Wishing is for children, and all it could do is drive home how much he doesn’t have. Sighing, he pushes himself out of bed.
To his surprise, the air around him immediately warms. His and Potter’s breath both catch in tandem and he opens his eyes to meet the other man’s intense gaze, the warm glow of magic fading between them. Then the air starts cooling again, the heat dissipating into the open street.
“Potter, if your grand plan is to fall over and make me catch you so that you may grab me, rest assured that I will let you fall,” he warns. Potter blinks, and then breaks out into laughter.
Potter is still looking at him expectantly, and he burns in embarrassment at failing such a simple task as deciding his drink. “Surprise me,” he hedges. Potter nods, starting to turn away, and Draco adds hastily, “but make it sweet!” He feels his cheeks flush again as Potter chuckles.
He lets in a deep breath, allowing the comforting scent to wash over him, thick with memories. He steps further into the library, and the wizened old librarian shelving books nearby notices him and looks up. “Hello there,” she says, her hands pausing in her task. “Can I help you find anything?”
“Are you ready to go then?” he asks. Potter leans back on the bench and shakes his head, waving a hand in the general direction of the ice.
The story has been on the wireless often in the past few months. The pair have been championing house-elf rights, or some such, and their case has now apparently been presented and the Wizengamot is in discussion. The witch reporting on the news briefly recaps Potter and Granger’s journey on this objective this far, and then Potter is brought on for an interview. His voice is rich and warm, and still sends shivers down Draco’s spine, as he talks about how he is confident that the Wizengamot will make the right decision.
Giving in to that weakness, however, means that his groceries for the week is going to be a loaf of bread again. “Nice work, you thrice-cursed idiot,” he mutters to himself, pocketing the coins.
A shout of “I’ll be right with you!” echoes from the back room, and Draco takes a steadying breath and walks up to the counter. The curtain to the back room is pushed aside and the shop’s proprietor enters. He is a long, spindly man with rich, thick chestnut hair and a well-groomed beard. His dark, sunken eyes dart to meet Draco’s, and a greasy smile crosses his face, revealing several gold teeth.
“Hullo!” He chirps to the librarian, stopping just inside the door to brush the snow out of his hair.
He wants to go right now? Draco looks at him in shock, but he seems perfectly serious, still looking over at Draco’s book.
Draco likes grocery runs, all things considered – it’s something to do other than wasting away in his apartment, and the store will be heated at least. That thought puts him in a pleasant mood as he takes the few steps across the room to the crate at his bedside, where he picks up his money sack and fishes out the measly remainder of his food budget for this period. Just four Sickles. With a dejected sigh, he drops them into the pocket of his coat, where they clink against something.
There’s an exercise here too, walking him through the steps to produce harmless sparkles and then working through controlling the amount, shape, and intensity of them. It’s not a direct, straightforward endeavor, of course, where one simply follows a series of instructions and achieves a result. This is more nuanced, the instructions more abstract, requiring interpretation and creativity to apply them.
Draco stares at him in disbelief. “A Minor Wiggenweld? That’s overkill Ugbert. Don’t you have a simple Healing Potion?”
Potter frowns. “Can you not cast a warming charm wandlessly though? Surely you didn’t leave your wand behind without being able to do it in this weather.” He asks.
How he wishes he could just tell Forsythe what for and leave this ignominious job behind, but the truth is that he’s lucky to have it. When he’d been released from Azkaban, he’d found a world that had no place for him – he was hated from both sides, both for being a Death Eater and for not being a committed enough one. He’d been at wits end, on the brink of starvation, when he’d found Forsythe. The old miser had thankfully been more enticed by the idea of exploitable labour than turned off by Draco’s identity. Forsythe may hate him, treat him like shit, and underpay him, but he’d given him the job and that was more than Draco can say of anyone else.
“Thank you,” he replies, quiet but honest. Potter beams at him, and Draco smiles back as he sips at his drink, which he is delighted to find is hot chocolate.
Potter swallows. “I – uh – no thanks necessary,” he stutters. Draco does blink up at him then, and Potter’s face is bright red.
Ugbert steps closer, moving around the counter so that he can see Draco fully. “Aww, you poor thing. Are you hurt?” He asks, reaching for Draco’s face.
He frowns but takes the box and looks at it dubiously. Potter is practically bouncing on his heels now, so he takes it to a nearby bench and sits down, setting it on his lap so that he can undo the bow. With one final look at an eagerly grinning Potter, he lifts the lid and the thin paper layer that lays directly on top, and his breath catches.
Draco laughs disbelievingly. “You are serious?” He asks when Potter doesn’t laugh along with him. Potter nods, and Draco boggles. “Well, you’ve sounded very confident,” he says.
“What? Why not?” Potter asks with a frown. He looks around, as if Draco’s wand will just appear in front of him.
By this point they’ve left Diagon and have travelled down at least two other streets. The area here is residential, with cute little houses decorated with festive lights lining the street. They don’t look big enough to have backyard ice rinks. “Do you live here then?” he asks Potter.
But his garments still hang too loosely on his thin frame, ragged and torn and not flattering at all. His gloves have so many holes that they scarcely count as gloves, his coat is threadbare, his pants are patched and baggy, and his boots are one hard knock away from falling apart. Draco scoffs at himself and turns away from the mirror. What is he doing, trying to primp himself, trying to look attractive? Those days are long past.
Draco thinks. He flushes. “Decidedly more…masculine,” he says, feeling the flash of nervousness that always accompanies telling someone of his preferences. It’s a remnant from his childhood, when his father had taken him aside and told him kindly but firmly that what he does in the bedroom is his business, but he must be discreet if they are to arrange a good marriage for him.
Head spinning in confusion, Draco quickly retreats back down Knockturn to the relative safety of his chilly apartment. He sits heavily on his rickety old bed and fishes out the contents of his pockets, staring in disbelief at the handful of coins in his hand. What had just happened there? He’d assumed Ugbert was just messing with him – the man has to have recognized him, surely he wouldn’t talk to any old customer off the street like that – but even when he’d gone out without his hood on, none of the people walking by had recognized him.
The night is thankfully not too cold still as he tucks himself in for bed, and he has a deep, uninterrupted sleep. The dream that comes to him is strange – he’s alone in a black place, or at least seems to be alone. His instincts ping though, with the feeling that he’s being watched.
Draco looks up at him, surprised. No traditions – none at all? Catching the look, Potter expounds, “The muggles”, which was no clearer.
Draco can’t believe his luck. Fresh bagels? All he has to look forward to at home is frozen bread – he could jump for excitement at this find. He carries the bag to the back room and tucks it carefully into his coat pocket before returning to the front and double-checking that everything is in order. Seeing nothing out of place, he shuts off the lamps and returns to the back, donning his coat and gloves and stepping out into the Alley, locking the door firmly behind him.
He steps into the warm, dimly lit store, and the bell above his head chimes his arrival. “I’ll be right with you,” comes Ugbert’s familiar call from the back room. Draco reluctantly draws closer to the counter, schooling his features into nonchalance as the curtain is drawn aside.
“I’ll be heading out now Mr. Forsythe,” Draco calls, poking his head out into the front of the store.
Draco blinks. “Bold of you to assume I’ll be waiting around for two years on your skating abilities,” he says, but his cheeks are flushed. Potter, after a moment, goes red as well, and there’s a beat of awkward silence between them.
Draco blinks. A wish made manifest – a child’s tale from his bedtime stories. Merlin, he’s done one good deed and now his subconscious is dragging up a fairy-tale reward for his dreams. He rolls his eyes at himself.
“You’re on Potter,” he says, and darts off. Potter, to his credit, doesn’t try and outdo his own abilities and by the time Draco’s coming up behind him he’s made it a quarter way around the rink and hasn’t fallen down yet.
It’s so tempting, in the mildly warmed room, to just leave it. Though his better sense tells him otherwise, it’s easy to imagine that this time the warming charm will hold, and he won’t need to go out. But he can’t risk it – Ugbert doesn’t keep late hours, and if this day has been any indication then the night will be frigid. If his warming charm wears off in the middle of the night, he may just freeze to death, or else burn his room down trying to warm it.
The owl turns its back on him as soon as he has the pouch, flaring its wings and tail in a dramatic display of disdain, that Draco amusedly appreciates, before it flies out the window. He wrestles it shut again, shivering slightly from the cold wind.
Disheartened, Draco bundles himself as much as he can in his ragged little blanket and climbs into bed. It doesn’t provide much warmth, and he sits there miserably as the shivers keep coming.
Draco wakes to the morning sun streaming through his useless curtains and throwing bright spots across his face. He curses thoroughly but, as that does nothing to dissuade it, fumbles his way to a sitting position and opens his eyes to find himself fully clothed on his bed. He’s not under the covers either, so he assumes that he’d exhausted himself with heating charms the night prior and passed out without meaning to.
“What is the noble cause this time then?” He asks when Potter’s antsiness becomes too much. He doesn’t lift his eyes from his book.
“Good morning,” Draco returns with a polite smile. He makes a beeline, this time, straight to the back where he’d found the volumes on wandless magic yesterday. He’d just reached the section of the book dedicated to harmonizing energy, magic, and intent, when he’d had to leave yesterday, and he’s eager to return to it.
He slips off his coat and gloves and hangs them on a hook on the back wall. Then he pauses, taking a moment to lean his head against the wall – he is exhausted already though the day has just begun - before turning and going up to the door separating the backroom from the front of store. He stops again there and draws a deep, fortifying breath, steeling himself – facing his boss is never a pleasant ordeal – before he raises a hand to rap sharply on the door.
The woman looks up and catches sight of Draco. “Excuse me,” she rasps. “do you have any money for food? Please, we haven’t eaten in days!”
Potter rocks back on his heels with a wide, stunning grin. “Brilliant,” he says. Unfortunately, he doesn’t through his arm over Draco’s shoulders again, and Draco bites down on his lip as another cold gust hits him. He follows behind Potter, hoping that the wool store is nearby.
Draco awakes from his strange dream and, with nothing to do on his first day of vacation, secludes himself in his room. But when an accident forces him to go outside, he finds that people are acting strangely toward him.
“It has been a while, hasn’t it Siri. We should meet under better circumstances next time and certainly not three years later. But of course, you are absolutely welcome for returning your Godson. He kinda already reminds me a bit of my son.” Narcissa’s smile was much larger than most people were used to seeing her wear.
Hi everyone, sorry its been two months since I've updated. I think it's been established that I will never be able to have a concrete update schedule at this point lol.
The next day, Harry was even more excited than the day before as he practically dragged his godfathers out of the door, which the two men previously hadn't thought possible. But, if you were to ask the little boy, he would have told you that it was because he had heard so many great things about Diagon Alley and he was going to get to visit it for the first time with his new friends. So, why wouldn't he be excited?
Harry honestly didn't believe what he was reading from her lips. They weren't going to throw him out immediately? He couldn't believe it. But, rare hope krept inside of him, hope that he hardly ever saw. So, he decided to throw caution to the wind and and answer the nice ladies questions unfiltered.
Harry laughed. “No, not even them. It's kind of funny actually, she doesn't like them much. Especially Ron, it's like she can sense his dislike of cats.”
Harry smiled shyly, “Um you talk slow.” When he said this, Draco looked like he didn’t know whether to be offended or to take it as a complement, but just shrugged it off.
Harry’s eyes widened and as he looked around at was obviously Platform 9 ¾. There was a large, black, red, and gold train titled ‘Hogwarts Express’ and people bustling about in clothes similar to the ones the people wore in Diagon Alley. It looked as though it were full of noise, and it made him anxious. He didn't much like crowds, the amount of people and things going on overwhelmed him and became his form of loud.
Snape’s normally cold, hard eyes softened at the shy boy’s soft and polite tone, further proving to him that this boy was very unlike his father. “No, nothing of the sort. I actually, wanted to-” he cleared his throat, “apologize for being very rude during class today, it was wrong of me.”
(Also if you care, I am also starting another fic that's probably going to be a series called Harry Potter and The Obviously Creepy Professor and the first chapter to that is up, it would mean a lot to me if you read it to!)
Harry wrung his hands together in nervousness as they walked through the doors of the hospital wing. All he could think about the entire way there was about what they were going to find. His aunt and uncle were going to murder him when they sent him back for his freakishness.
The boy’s-Draco’s mom spoke up before he could continue. “What’s your name sweetheart? And what does your family look like?”
They all left the class with a smile on their faces, and headed to potions, which was their final class for the day. Harry, Pansy, Blaise, and Draco were all looking forward to it the most and so eagerly divided up into the same pairs they had in History Of Magic.
With a sigh, Severus set his things to the side once the house elf had disappeared and decided to head to his rooms. He’d had plenty of revelations for one day.
Remus and Sirius watched his joyfilled expression with a smile, happy to see him happy. “Ready to go meet Ginny and Ron?” Sirius asked, amusement gleaming in his eyes.
Hermione quickly hugged him tightly before giving him one last smile and disappearing through the floo.
Draco continued eating as well, but kept sending him worried glances every now and then. They finished eating, and a few minutes afterwards, a person called a Prefect led them out of the Hall.
He was relieved that he hadn’t just shot down his question all together, like he was so used to happening at the Dursleys’, and nodded.
They sat down in the two armchairs in front of his desk, while Snape sat in the desk, looking at him in anticipation.
I started school up in August, and I've been slammed with homework ever since, so I haven't really had a chance to work on this for a while.
Draco did just that, shooting the professor another glare. They waited for the rest of the class to file out of the classroom, before walking up to Professor Snape's desk, Draco with a question in his eyes and Harry with slight fear in his.
"Draco..." he started tugging on the blond boys sleeve and pointing, "what are those?" He made sure to tear his eyes away from the carriages, so he could look at Draco and read his lips.
Snape sat in contemplative silence for a moment, burying his anger at the little boys relatives for the moment and Draco ended up being the one who spoke up next. “Harry doesn’t have any school things, Severus.”
”Its strange that he would do something like that isn't it?” Blaise asked him frowning in confusion, once he had finished the story.
Dumbledore didn’t look much different than he’d had a few moments ago, the only difference being that his eyes were a little less sparkling. “Sirius, we think it would be best if your godson was placed in the Dursley’s home, because of the blood protection-”
“Yeah, you can help us do the squiggle squabbles.” Ginny told Harry with a bright smile and even though said boy had no idea what she was talking about, he automatically jumped out from behind the leg that was concealing him and joined them.
Harry’s smile grew slightly as he went to sit down across from him, and pet the small kitty that had moved down from his shoulder and to his arms when he sat down. A few silent moments passed and it wasn’t until Rena moved from his arms and back up to his shoulder again that he decided to speak. “Malfoy?” he started, trying to get his attention (he had started reading a book.)
After lots of discussion about what they should do for the raven haired boy’s birthday, they had ultimately decided that they would take him to a park in the heart of London. Because no matter how much they wanted to shelter the newly 4 year old boy from the world of fame he was subjected to, he needed some social interaction with kids his own age. Even if Sirius did act like he was actually Harry’s age most of the time, ultimately, he wasn't.
He strapped Harry into the sidecar and mounted the bike, bringing it roaring to life. He didn’t look back at Dumbledore once since he had finally gotten his Godson from him and still didn’t as he flew away.
I know, I know. It’s been so long. I haven’t updated in almost 2 years. I just kinda...got in a funk. Life took over. When I was writing this story originally, I didn’t really know what it was like to socialize a lot and be outside of my comfort zone. I just kind lived forever in my own introverted bubble. And then, I started dating Emily, and life just kinda started to make sense. I got my license, fell in love, and learned what it felt like to really and truly live. To love someone and to be loved. It’s been amazing and a journey. I’m going to do my best to keep updating the story, and I had time to at least update once during this because of self-quarantine during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Hey guys. What’ve you been up to?” Harry asked, sitting down on the bench across from them and idly petting the little kitten still curled up in his arms. Noticing that he was now seated, Rena climbed up into his shoulder and buzzed his cheek, before looking at the other two people in the room with her head tilted slightly to the side.
“I’m Narcissa and this is my husband Lucius. We are going to try and help you find your family, okay?” Narcissa gave him a kind and worried smile.
After the feast, Severus went to his office to finish up some things before classes. But, as he started the prepare the lesson for the next day, his thoughts strayed back to a curious James Potter look-alike.
The twins also didn't notice their parents talking to each other, as they were trying their hardest to get as many smiles on their new friend’s face as they good. They both felt an automatic need to protect him from the harshness of the world that even at four they knew existed. This boy, who they figured out was the Harry Potter their parents told them about, was a living representation of that.
”It’s okay. It was a while ago, I’ve had a bit of time to get over it. We all lost a lot in the war.”
After that, the trios conversation moved on to lighter topics and they each learned a little more about each other (though Harry was doing most of the learning) and they received their timetables from the prefects.
Right now though, he had to start out with reassuring the child before him, then he could possibly consider seeing if he could convince him to take a trip down to Madame Pomfrey's with him. There, they could assess what further damage had been done to him. “Firstly, young man, you absolutely deserved those those things and your relatives shouldn't have done that. Secondly, I will see to it that you get some new supplies and make sure that they don't fall into your aunt and uncle's hands.” Somewhere, in the very back of the man's mind, he noted that he was going very soft for the boy with Lily's eyes, very quickly.
Snape’s normally steely eyes softened. “You’re welcome.” He figured saying that he didn't need to thank him wouldn't go over well just yet. “Also Harry, I was wondering if you would mind coming to Madam Pomfrey's with me for a quick check up.”
Harry got up, and then was devastatingly reminded of the fact that he didn't have a toothbrush or a fresh change of clothes. He sighed, and just picked the robes Draco lent him back up and put them on, figuring that he wouldn't mind if he wore them again. He then, as disgusting as it was, washed his mouth out with soap and water in the bathroom sink, before going back out to see Draco was mostly ready as well.
He made a deliberate point to make eye contact with each glaring person and give them an appreciative look. When he met Pansy's eyes, he instantly felt bad because he hadn’t talked to her much since he sat down. He opened his mouth and was just about to strike up a conversation before he felt Draco tap his shoulder. He looked over at him with a questioning look.
Life seems normal on the night of November 1, 1981 at Number 4 Privet Drive, perfectly normal indeed. The perfectly normal family inside the home sleeps soundly, blissfully unaware of what had just transpired the night before and what was getting ready to occur.
Hermione fixed him with a half hearted glare. “This school year is very important. This is our last year, and we have to study to get our NEWTs.”
He thought back to a week ago, when he, Ron, and Hermione had gone to Diagon Alley. He smiled slightly. It had been a fun time, he had laughed and joked with his friends, and picked up the things on his list of stuff that he needed for Hogwarts. But the main part of his trip that made it so great, was a purchase that he made that wasn't on his list. They had been passing the pet shop, and he had glanced over, and a tiny black kitten with white spots on one of its eyes and two of its feet, ran out of the doors when someone had left. He paused from his walking in shock, ready to quickly stop the runaway kitty, but it had just ran right towards him and climbed up his leg before coming to rest in a sitting position on his shoulder. He remembered, chuckling quietly to himself, that the cat had looked at home on his shoulder, as if it had belonged there. His friends we're looking on at the scenario in both mild shock and amusement, and Harry shook his head and motioned for them to follow him into the store. He had decided then and there that if the little runaway kitten didn't have and owner, than she would by the time he left the store. As it turned out after talking to the store clerk, she was the runt of her litter, but with her adventures tendencies and joyful attitude, you wouldn't have been able to tell. The clerk had joked that if she didn't know any better, she would think that the kitten was muggle puppy. Harry then expressed his interest in adopting her, and the clerk smiled and told him the price and that the kitten was female. Harry smiled and quickly grabbed the essentials for his new pet before thanking and paying the woman. His friends had told him to meet them outside of the quidditch supply shop during the whole ordeal, so he had met them there, officially introducing the kitten the them and smiling the widest that he had in a long time. “Guys, this is Rena.” His friends had smiled at his lit up expression, glad to see him happy. Hermione of course had asked why he had chosen the name that he did, and he had told her that it was because the name meant
“Now that’s not nice, Mr. Zabini is a clever, and I suppose, attractive young man,” Severus further teased, before adding, “It’s not as if he could ever file for courtship with you. He would have to speak with the Head of the Black family and that is highly unlikely to happen in the near future, or perhaps ever.”
The words had Thor lifting his head, obviously startled at having been pulled out of his own musings. One blue and one hazel eye glanced about the mostly barren suite before he murmured his agreement. Summoning ink, quill, and parchment Loki composed a quick list of items that would improve the space. Thor had his own interesting suggestions and Loki was surprised by how many of them he found himself caving to. Thor was eager to fulfill every request, enjoying the fact he had something he could do other than wait for Draco to wake.
That got a few chuckles from some of the audience as Dunn sat down with the tips of her ears still red.
It was a guilt that Sirius expected many of the professors’, including the headmaster, held. Self-doubt must unfortunately go hand in hand with being in a position to shape another’s life.
The scientist didn’t need to continue, the Avengers had all heard the tale of how Loki attempted a double-cross on Thanos in the hope of taking his life. Instead it had cost the shapeshifter his own after Loki traded one of the Infinity Stones in exchange for Thor’s life. While the God of Mischief was far from a hero in any tales other than the most recent, he did seem to have gotten his priorities in the right place.
“Alright, those that I gave the band to, you are going to have to use it to pull back your hair.” There was an eruption of protests around the room, many of the girls didn’t want to ruin their current hairstyles that they probably spent too much time in the mirror arranging rather than using the time reviewing before their first classes. Professor Haywood’s smile turned sharper, still speaking in a friendly tone, “Those that do not abide by the rules for safety inside of the potions’ lab, including those that deal with attire, will be met with detention of scrubbing cauldrons for three nights. Each violation afterwards will result in harsher punishments decided by myself and Professor Black; they’ll not be negated by your head of house.”
Lucius drummed his fingers upon the arm of his chair as he continued, “Such it was before the rise of the Dark Lord. I had graduated before it had reached its height, but Regulus and Severus will inform you it only became worse as they grew older. Severus already rewriting improved recipes for potions, yet no one would give him the time of day, they looked first at the color of his house and nature of his bloodline before anything else. It was the same everywhere for us whom have been whispered to carry shadows in our veins.”
The girls descended into giggles at the mean sentiments. Harry shared a glance with his friends, it was obvious who they were gossiping about. After all, there was only one female not included in the group.
At first, he thought it was because of his pureblood, but looking back, Draco could see the signs that it was really his alien heritage shining through in those moments. His resistance to cold, his absolute hatred of summer and heat. The sensitivity of his eyes to light. His early and more controlled signs of magic than should not be possible. The unnaturally low body temperature and how potions affected him differently than everyone else.
Rue, also known as common rue, is a kind of evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region, Macaronesia and southwest Asia, with a distinctive bitter taste. Rue has healing properties, and is used in wizarding remedies: essence of rue is used to recover after poisoning, and it is also used in the treatment of mad dog bites and used in Felix Felicis.
Harry shivered pulling the hood of his robe up over his head as he and his friends dashed from the train to the waiting line of charmed carriages while the rain pelted them relentlessly. It was the end of summer, but there seemed to be a persistent chill that had permeated the air since they had left London. Lightning cracked across the sky and thunder boomed loud enough to cause some students to squeal in fright.
“Have you even spoken to a house elf before to get their side of the story?” Harry asked, ignoring the surprised expressions Ron and Neville sent his way at his rather combative and harsh tone.
Most people were focused on seeing what the light illuminated and paid no attention to the shadows that were cast as a result. Without the darkness, the complete picture could not be seen.
Harry supposed with a smile that mischief really was hereditary after all. At the same time it made him wonder where Fred and George got it from. He thought about asking Hermione just that when the car came to a stop.
Swinging one leg over the length of wood, Harry checked his grip before taking off into the air, he bit into his lip to keep the whoop of joy inside. He doubted that any of the elves were wandering the grounds, but it didn’t hurt to be careful. First, the broom turned towards the Quidditch pitch that was built on the eastern yard of the manor. Ron, Ron’s brothers, Harry, Remus, Sirius, and even Neville had spent countless hours practicing and fooling around on their brooms here playing mock Quidditch games.
The firelight and waxing moonlight from the windows lit up the room enough for Sirius to see the firm downturn of Remus’ lips, the wand in his hand, and the way amber eyes followed something moving across the grounds below. The Dementors most likely.
Harry was still hesitating, though he took the knife into his hand. Bone, the hilt was made of bone. Of what creature Harry didn’t dare ask, he had a feeling he wouldn’t like the answer.
It was the entirety of the Slytherin Quidditch team. They were older students: 2 seventh-years and 5 sixth-years. Sirius knew there were far more Dark students than this small number and those that were in other houses.
Sirius stood before the crackling hearth, meeting the eyes of each snake before dropping into a sweeping bow as he spoke,
A small hand gripped his nose almost painfully and dragged Severus out of his musing with a small squawk. The little Potter only giggled despite being slightly jostled, Regulus snickering out, “They always go for your nose, don’t they?”
“Well you don’t have to today. We have plenty of time, whenever you want to practice or talk, my door will always be open for you, cub.” Remus reassured as he threw an arm over Harry’s shoulders to draw himself forward into a quick hug. Trying to come up with a lighter topic, Remus smirked as he drew back from the teenager.
“He’s not dangerous, he’ll only bite if I tell him to!” Harry hurriedly explained, hissing when Thuban inched a bit closer towards the sofa the terrified girl sat on,
Harry was still annoyed, but didn’t want to part on bad terms, though his expression and tone remained petulant. “Yeah, I’ll find your little trinket, you can’t get rid of me that easy. Merry part.” The parting was a little odd on his tongue, but it seemed to appease Draco well enough as the blond gave a small nod.
The pink bullfrog was butting her way, intent on making her own speech apparently. Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then lowered himself into his grand chair. He looked alert, like there was nothing wrong with listening to what Umbridge would have to say. Some of the other professors were not nearly so successful in hiding their surprise. Professor Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair and McGonagall’s mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it. Hagrid clumsily dropped his giant goblet, Hooch’s lips were pursed like she had sucked a lemon without the drop, and both Quirrel and Trelawney looked fit to faint.
Draco took them, and quickly skimmed through them. He raised his eyebrows as he recognized the handwriting. He would recognize the flowing handwriting anywhere from the many letters his godfather had sent him over the years.
Harry looked up into the eyes of Draco’s mom, which were much like her son’s. “I’m Harry and um, my Uncle Moony has scars on his face and my Uncle Padfoot has long dark hair and eyes kinda like your’s. They were with a bunch of people with red hair.”
He looked up when Draco slightly nudged him. “Why aren't you eating? You must be starving.” Draco asked in confusion.
Draco chuckled, but it was slightly dry and some of his nervousness began to show. “I'm afraid not, though I wish they had. That information would have been really useful.”
Harry stared in disbelief at the Hogwarts acceptance letter in his hands. He had already quickly read over it, and was standing slightly away from one of the dusty old sitting room windows of 12 Grimmauld Place. Harry, for a moment, felt as if he were thrown back to the summer before his first year, just finding out he was a wizard.The letter he had received, was an official Hogwarts letter stating that Hogwarts was inviting all of its previous seventh years back to attend as eighth years. He had never thought he would go back there. Though, there was never a doubt in his mind when he had first read the letter that he would be going back, back to the place he had considered home for 6 years. He only hoped it would still feel that way after everything that happened, because he needed the feeling of home that Hogwarts gave him more than anything.
Draco spoke before Blaise could, sensing that it was best that he was the one to answer him. “No, not weird. Just different is all, a good different. That way at least one of us will be able to have notes for that class and be able to make sure the rest of us don't fall behind.”
Blaise’s usually constant smile turned into a frown as they followed Draco there (because he had the map) and he voiced his concerns. “Every single adult I've spoken too about Hogwarts has said that this is the dullest class. I mean, Binns is a ghost and he's bound to be tired of his job.”
And, though Harry was having a hard time keeping up with reading all of their lips and figuring out who was speaking, thought it was one-hundred percent worth it to be able to ‘hear' what his friends were saying. “Thank you.” He told them with a million different emotions in his velvet voice that only he couldn't hear.
A few moments later, he saw the door open out of the corner of his eye, and looked over at the people who entered. There were three people, two of them boys and one a girl, who looked to be about his age. In the front of them, was a boy with slicked back, pale blond hair, striking silver eyes, and pristine, nice looking robes that made Harry feel even more inferior. The other boy was dark skinned, and in a simple t-shirt and black slacks, while the girl had loose, curly, dark brown hair, tan skin, and dark eyes and was in light pink robes. Even with the blond boys hair, none of them even came close to resembling the Dursleys or any people they would associate with, and he almost sighed aloud in relief. Harry gave them a shy smile, hoping that maybe, just maybe, these people could be his first ever friends.
He stared blankly at his hand for a moment, momentarily lost in memories of the train first year, before smiling and taking it. “I’m Draco Malfoy. I’m kind of fucked up too and I’ve got this ugly mark on my arm but if you’re willing to look past my shit than I can look past yours.”
Blaise gave him a look that clearly told him that he doubted it, but he just sighed and dropped it as they walked into the classroom.
Severus was really, really, beginning to question what the boy’s homelife was like if he was that shocked over an apology. “Of course, I have wronged you so therefore I have apologized.”
He watched in anticipation as Professor Snape talked to a stern looking woman with slightly greying hair pulled back into a bun that he could only assume was Madam Pomfrey. He was at an angle where he could easily read both of their lips, so he watched them carefully.
Finally, they came back over to him, solemn looks on their faces. He tensed and braced himself for the words he was sure would come next.
The green eyed boy thought nervously as he looked around at all of the watchful eyes. He decided to voice his thoughts aloud. “Padfoot, Moony, why are all of these people staring at me?” he asked softly.
Draco sagged into his chair slightly in relief, glad that he wasn't mad at him. He didn't know what he would have done if Harry hated him for telling Severus. He already cared so much for him so quickly and wanted to stop all bad things from happening to him or around him. “I'm so glad you're not angry with me.” He said with a relieved smile.
Harry couldn't help but frown slightly. “But don't you think that…” He trailed off for a moment, “I'm afraid that…”
“Hey Harry!” Ron greeted, giving him a bright smile, arm wrapped around Hermione’s shoulders, who was of course reading a book.
“Severus, come here for a moment, would you?” Harry read from Pomfrey’s lips, genuine fear seeping into him at the look on her face. She looked a mixture of disgust, fear, and fury. He was certain she was going to send him back to the Dursleys’.
He broke out of his awe when the sudden fear hit him that he would miss the train, and hurried over to an opening and climbed through it. He walked down the long halls of the train, set on looking for an empty compartment. He finally found one towards the end, and slid open the door and sat down. He glanced out the window, and then pulled his wand out of the waistband of his overly baggy pants, and began to twirl the only thing he had left between his fingers.
Harry turned his expression into one of unfeeling, which was much more familiar to him than it should have been. “I don't know sir.”
Though all of this, Harry just kept eyeing them warily, not understanding anything that was going on.
“Padfoot! Moony!” He exclaimed running toward them, relieved and guilty tears falling down his face.
When the boy slowly, fearfully, shook his head  no, Snape cringed. He had been afraid of that. Then a thought struck him. He was a practiced legilimens, and he’d been experimenting with a new strategy.
Harry looked at Draco, slight fear in his eyes. Was this a test? Was Professor Snape going to think him greedy if he asked for a pair of pajamas or a toothbrush?
Harry shook his head vigorously. “No, not at all. As you know, I didn't even know I was a wizard until about a month ago, and I hate when a ton of attention is focused on me when I can't even hear the people."
They shared a look. “I don’t know, pup.” Moony lied (he was too young to hear the truth), “They are just very rude.” he said the last part a little louder so then their audience would hopefully look away. It mostly worked, as most people looked away in embarrassment (the death glare Padfoot gave them may have been a contributing factor.)
Hermione grinned even wider, though he had previously thought that it would be impossible for her to do so. He was glad that his false cheerfulness was ignored for the moment.
They continued walking, following the direction the rest of the first years were going, and were met by Hagrid before they were escorted to several small boats. Harry bowed his head in shame a the sight of Hagrid, feeling guilty because the birthday present he got his was gone, along with the rest of his things. Thankfully, Hagrid didn't notice him and the four of them climbed into one boat, and the rest grouped up and climbed into the others. They all grinned at each other, and looked in the direction they were going, anticipating when Hogwarts, in all its beauty, came into view.
“I love you too, pup.” the two men responded automatically. They smiled when he ran away from them and immediately went towards the toy broomsticks they had.
Harry walked over to the Gryffindor table, and sat next to a gaping Ron and Hermione. Harry cringed mentally.
Sirius and Remus turned to them and smiled. “Hey ‘Cissa, long time no see. Thank you for bringing our Godson back to us.” Sirius said with a grin.
Harry sighed, and gave him a weak smile. “Its okay, I understand.” He couldn't be mad at his friends, especially when said friends intentions had been in the right place.
Harry frowned slightly in disappointment. “Okay,” He continued to whisper, “Umm, can you please put me in a house that is not super you know, um ‘loud’.” Harry finished, slightly afraid that he would do the exact opposite.
Draco looked at him sympathetically. “That's what people do, especially when your famous. Even me, though I'm not as famous as you. They judge me by my last name, because they think that my family did something that they didn't. Not just me though, they judge the whole of Slytherin House because we have an “evil history.”
Hagrid gently picked Harry up from the the little sidecar of the bike and looked at him with sad, teary eyes. “I guess this is g'bye ten.”
It turned out that they only had to walk a few feet before they found the Weasleys, and when they did Harry was immediately almost tackled in a hug by four redheads. He giggled at the two sets of twins antics. “Hey guys!” he greeted enthusiastically.
Draco smiled a large smile back, before motioning back to the professor. “He wants to talk to you again really quick. He told me to get your attention.”
Harry lost his anger practically the moment it was there. Now he had questions, so many of them. He ended up deciding on one he wanted to ask first. “What do they think your family did?”
Harry ran his hand through his already messy hair, thinking about the fact that it was going to be a long next few weeks before he returned to Hogwarts.
Draco gave him a small smile. “Okay. Um, I was going to say that they're going to be calling our names soon, they're in the L’s now, so I'll be going up any minute. When I sit down at the Slytherin table, keep your eyes on me and I'll gesture to you when they say your name. Whichever house you're sorted into, I'll still be your friend, even if you're a Gryffindor. Remember that.”
Harry couldn't believe someone would give him anything. He had to force back his tears of joy so that he could actually see what the gift was.
Poppy sighed, and thought for a moment. Her brows furrowed. After a few moments, she finally spoke. “Are you sure that’s a good idea? Do you know that he knows verbal words well enough from when he could hear to actually understand you and not be freaked out?”
Harry inhaled a breath, steeling himself. “I was thinking… Our old rivalry seems kind’ve stupid and childish now. And, I for one, am done with fighting. So, do you think that maybe, we could have a truce? Start fresh? I don’t know, maybe we could even be friends?” he stopped himself there, knowing he was rambling. He couldn’t help it, he was practically vibrating with nerves.
Blaise, who had been quiet up until now, laughed. "You know, if anyone else would’ve said that to him, he would have exploded. He seems to like you.” With relief, Harry noted that he could understand him perfectly, and he smiled. He looked over at Draco and saw that his cheeks had tinted slightly.
Harry clung to his Uncle Moony as they aparated away, Padfoot following soon after. They landed just outside of the Leaky Cauldron and the toddler’s little hands clung onto one of each of his uncles’ as they walked through the busy area to get to the entrance of the alley.
When Harry read those words on his lips, he gradually unwound himself, before speaking again. “I'm okay. And you didn't do anything wrong, it was my fault. I overreacted.”
“I turned around and a second later you were gone. I’m so sorry my little Prongslet, I should have kept a better eye on you.” Sirius’ voice was muffled from where his face was buried in his little shoulder, but the guilt and relief were still evident.
They made it to the carriages and sat down in one that already had Luna in it. Harry made conversation with Draco and caught up with Luna throughout the ride up to the castle, and the three of them ended up deciding to walk to the Great Hall together before going to their respective tables.
Snape gave a long suffering sigh that Harry of course couldn't hear, and looked about to continue before he saw to look on Draco’s face. His godson was giving him a glare that would have given The Dark Lord a run for his money. And, Snape admitted to himself, he wholeheartedly deserved it. He had promised himself he would give the boy a chance for Lily’s sake.
She got out her wand and pointed it at him, making Harry even more nervous. She must have sensed this, because she explained. “I'm just going to run a few diagnostic charms, don't worry Harry.”
At the sound of his voice, they both stopped what they were doing and ran towards him as well, both of them scooping him up in their arms, so that half of him was being held by each of them. “Oh my god pup we were worried sick.” Remus had relief clear in his voice.
Draco nodded, while Harry just looked on in shock. He thought he was going to get scolded for being greedy.
read his lips anymore after that. Because, it had finally hit him that he wouldn't have to be at the Dursleys’ nine months out of the year. He could potentially, for the first time, have a real home with real friends.
Pansy began talking a little slower after that, and as they talked Harry got to know Draco, Pansy, and Blaise a little better. They talked about each of the Hogwarts houses, Quidditch, what to expect when they got there, and other miscellaneous things. Soon, the time came when they had to change into their black school robes, and Harry looked down at his feet and tugged awkwardly at his tatty shirt.
Harry nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, let’s do that.” It was clearly obvious how much effort it took him not to shout those words in his excitement.
Albus Dumbledore with his long white beard and pointed hat, stands in wait outside of the home next to a worried Minerva McGonagall. If you were to look in the direction that they were, it would appear as if they were only looking up at the stars. But, if you looked long enough, you’d see that they were waiting for the sound and the appearance of a roaring motorbike.
Harry put his book back in his bag and left it for the house elves to put in his room before collecting Rena back from Draco and allowing her to settle back in her usual spot on his shoulders. He smiled at the Slytherin and the two of them exited the compartment side by side. Harry wondered amusedly as they walked what people’s reactions are going to be when they see them being civil-
“What if we went and introduced you? Would that be okay?” Moony asked, giving him a reassuring smile.
The castle was huge and enchanting. All the first years were enraptured by its beauty, and Harry was no exception. But while he found the castle beautiful, he also found it extremely intimidating. It was just so 'huge' and loud. Nothing like he was used too. He wondered if he would ever find his way around, or if he would be able to get to his classes on time. Harry looked over at Draco, Pansy, and Blaise when they were close to the castle, and saw they were staring at it with wide eyes. Draco looked over at him after a moment, feeling his gaze, and smiled. "Beautiful, isn't it?"
The werewolf rolled his eyes. The child could act so much like Sirius every once in a while, but those moments were few and far between. “Come on Padfoot! There is a very anxious little birthday boy here that really wants to go to the park!”
When Harry was put down for his nap when he returned home that evening, it was with the sure thought that it had been the best birthday he had ever had.
The Weasleys sadly had to leave after lunch, but invited them to go to Diagon Alley with them the next day, which after Harry begging his uncles a lot, they agreed to.
The bell signaling the end of the class sounded, and Draco and Harry started to gather their things so they could head out of the room.
“Hello. That's a nice little sculpture you two are making.” Sirius greeted with a smile. “What are your names?”
They reached two large doors which were held open by McGonagall and another creepy looking man who had a cat by his side. The first years shuffled in anxiously, and gathered at the beginning of the loud great Hall and stood in a huge crowd. McGonagall told them to stay there once they all were in and headed up to a front table with a bunch of adults sitting at it. Harry tensed, overwhelmed by the large amount of people. They were all talking, he could see, and wondered how he would ever be able to survive in this school. He wouldn't be able to understand most people when they spoke to him, or hear when someone came up behind him. He nervously ran his hand up and down his left arm in nervousness.
He was saved from further contemplation when Snape spoke again. "I won't be angry, I promise. I just want to find out what happened so I can help you get you some new school things."
Draco glanced at the people in the great Hall, before deciding that they were listening to them. “I'll tell you everything I know when we get into the common room later.”
The raven and blond haired boys made it to the Great Hall and sat across from Pansy and Blaise at the Slytherin table, in about the same spots they were the night before. Harry smiled at them shyly in greeting, and Draco started going into the story of how Harry had found the gift from Snape and that was why they were late.
Harry gave him his first large and sincere smile of the afternoon. He was overjoyed at the thought that his opinion mattered to someone for once.
Before any of the redheads could answer, Sirius did. “How about the Quidditch store they have? We could get you a new toy broom?”
And so, Harry had a early childhood full of the stories of the adventures of the Marauders, visits with his friends, and most importantly, a childhood filled with love.
I was also wondering, should I make this into a series of separate books or should I combine it all into the one?
Severus had to work harder to shove his anger back as he looked at Harry, who didn’t have any idea what Draco said and was fidgeting nervously.
They looked aver at the school again, jumping slightly and their eyes widened  in surprise when the boat gave a slight jolt when they came to a stop. Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise all saw the other students being ushered out of their boats by Hagrid, and climbed out as well and joined them.
“Great! Well, Ron and I are of course going to go back, and I've already called some of our other friends, who also said that they were returning. I'm so excited to get back into the routine of things!”
They apparated shortly after that, Sirius only taking Harry off of his shoulder when he’d tried to climb down himself. When the toddler was set down, however, instead of running straight toward the park like they had expected him to he just stared at it with wide eyes.
They continued on like this for a while, before Hermione continued reading and Ron just started watching her affectionately. Harry felt like he was intruding on a private moment. He distracted himself by playing with his little kitten for a few minutes, before quietly slipping out of the compartment to give them some alone time. He set on finding at least a mostly empty compartment, and made his way towards the end of the train.
Okaay, so, I am so sorry that it took me this long to update! I had a whole bunch of homework and then finals when school was in, and the summer came and I kept getting distracted by a million different things. I also suffered from writers block with this story for a bit and I'm learning how to drive and it's just been a lot. I hope you can forgive me...
Draco smiled. “She probably can, animals are usually pretty good at reading humans.” True to his words, the little black kitten sat up a little straighter from her place on the blond’s shoulders.
Thank you so much for sticking with me if you've read to this point and I really hope that you enjoy this chapter!
Blaise looked at him sympathetically. “Out of all the houses, your in the one that people in it can relate to you most. We've all got a bit of history, as I'm sure Draco here has told you.” He finished the last bit giving Draco a slight nod.
Harry smiled at him softly. “Her name is Rena. I got her over the summer. I wanted another pet, but-” he paused, smile faltering for a moment, “I couldn’t bring myself to get another owl. And then this one practically tackled me outside of the shop she was being sold in, and I had to get her.” He figured he would go ahead and answer the blond’s unspoken question as well.
Harry looked back and forth from the two quickly, his brows furrowed in his sallow face that was far more skinny than it should have been for a boy his age. He was trying his best not to shy away.
They didn't speak as they waited for Professor Snape to arrive, knowing from the other students that he always arrived early and hated students speaking in his class out of turn. It was a really good thing that they arrived as early as they did.
Draco turned to him and gave him a wave, to which Harry grinned and waved back. Harry made sure to keep his eyes on Draco when Draco looked away, to make sure he would be able to see when he signaled.
So, the beginning of the chapter is in third person Severus' POV and then switches back to Harry and Draco's third person POV.
I am so so sorry that this took me so long to post. I've been so busy with school, and in the free time I do have I just couldn't bring myself to write. I hope you can forgive me...
Hagrid began to talk to the surrounding students, but Harry couldn’t understand him from a distance, nonetheless through his beard, so he had no idea what he was saying. A few minutes into Hagrid talking to the students, Harry decided he would just ask Draco what he said later. When the crowd started moving, Harry kept close to Draco and the others and followed them hastily, determined not to be left behind them in the caos. He didn’t know what he’d do if he lost them, they were the only people in the school so far that knew he was deaf, and he was determined to make that number of people as small as possible. He could only imagine what people would do to him when they realized he was a freak, they would probably treat him like the Dursleys did and they’d be forced to kick him out of Hogwarts for his freakishness. Harry’s breath started to become slightly labored with panic and he pushed those thoughts out of his mind like he was so used to doing by now, he had other things to be worrying about right now.
“Are you okay Harry?” Remus asked him, placing his hand on his shoulder and crouching down so he was eye level.
Harry was at a loss about how his new friend could already read him so easily. “I...just...um...its nothing.” He stuttered. ‘Questions are annoying, I’m not allowed to ask questions. Aunt and Uncle said so.’ He thought to himself.
“The note I got says it says it's a self writing quill. I assume it reacts to voices so then it will write down what people say so I can understand my lessons.” He explained when Draco gave him a questioning look, enthusiasm clear in his ever quiet voice.
“Well, I’m Sirius, this is Remus, and this little rascal back here,” he gestured to each person respectively, “is Harry. And, Harry was wondering if it was okay if he played with you?” Harry poked his head out a little further from behind Sirius at this, making eye contact with the two other children.
The boy with the blond hair smiled slightly in turn, and began to introduce himself. “I’m Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, and this is Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson.” Harry’s eyes watched his lips the whole time, and was happy to note that he talked slow enough that he could read his lips and understand him.
In Harry’s slight zoning out, he hadn’t even realized that they had entered Hogwarts and were now standing in front of a very stern looking lady in a pointy hat. Harry tensed slightly, minutely reminded of aunt Petunia. The lady sent slight shivers down his spine.
In turn, Draco tentatively asked him why he didn't have any school things, other than his wand. Harry had turned him down politely at his question, and told him that he didn't want to talk about it yet. Draco reluctantly accepted this, and let the subject drop for now. He would get him to tell him eventually, when he trusted him more. He wanted to do what he could to help him.
exactly what he was going to say. “He needs a pair of pajamas, a toothbrush, and at least one casual outfit for the weekends.”
Inside, Severus was angrier than words could detail, but he didn’t let any of that show on the surface. He didn't want to scare the clearly fragile and jumpy boy. So, he decided to ask one of the questions that had been nagging at him. “How are your aunt and uncle with their own son?”
Pansy gave him a similar smile, though it lacked shyness. “I know so. I think they would all love to tell you about your parents.”
Harry watched in awe as Padfoot tapped at a brick wall carefully with his wand after arriving at it, causing the bricks to roll back, creating an opening in the once solid looking wall. Even after being around magic for all of his 4 years of life it still never ceased to amaze him. “Wow!” he gasped, eyes wide in delight. If he had thought the brick wall was amazing, than the whole of Diagon Alley was breathtaking.
Draco made a face like he was about to say something else, but before he could, something out of the corner of Harry's eye caught his attention.
Harry flew around for a while until he eventually grew tired of it and got down. He smiled at his watching godparents, before surveying the rest of the park. His eyes landed on a redheaded boy and girl that looked to be around his age and appeared to be working together to make something in the sand. He continued to watch the two of them for a moment before Sirius nudged him. “Go talk to them.”
Harry gave a small smile and agreed, taking the robes that were handed to him a second later and quickly changed into them. They sat down and continued talking, and a few minutes later the train stopped. Draco, Blaise, and Pansy all grabbed their things and then Harry followed after them when they exited the compartment. They stepped down the stairs and off the train into a place that Pansy, Draco, and Blaise explained previously, was Hogsmeade. The rest of the years other than first, headed over to the horseless carriages, which harry blinked at, utterly astounded.
When Draco saw that Harry was still watching him, he spoke. “I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Are you okay?”
Harry smiled and then looked at Blaise (who whooped), and Pansy (who just smiled), and motioned for the three of him to follow him out of the Great Hall so they could head to their first class, which was History Of Magic with Professor Binns.
“I don’t give a shit about blood protection.” he spat, interrupting him, “I care about Harry and I care about the fact that Harry would not be loved in that house!” Sirius inhaled a breath, calming himself a little. “I’m in the will, Remus and I get first priority custody of him. So give him to me before I call in the other Aurors.”
Through the whole interaction with the box, Harry hadn't noticed Draco watching him. So,  when he started crying Draco was alarmed and came over and tapped Harry on the shoulder.
This is kinda just a filler chapter. I planned on having them go to their classes for the first time, but that didn't end up happening. I wanted to include where Severus stood so far and include a gesture from him to show that he's a good person.
Harry lifted the kitten from his arms and into Draco’s waiting ones. The look of awe and wonder on his face as he pet the little kitten made him smile. After a few moments of him petting her, to Draco's surprise she climbed up him and curled around his shoulders.
He looked over at Poppy. “What if I tried to use Legilimency? I’ve came up with a new strategy where if I focus hard enough, I can speak in another’s mind.”
“Hey little Harrykins!” Fred and George greeted at the same time with huge grins, Fred ruffling his hair as they finally let him go. (Harry can of course already tell them apart.)
Harry now stood just outside Platform 9 ¾ after having hid behind a post and watched a large, red haired family pass through one brick post in particular. He had none of the items that he had bought with Hagrid with him, other than his wand. The Dursleys had burned the rest as soon as he had brought it back with him to stick out the rest of the summer. Even Hedwig. He had silently cried in his cupboard for hours when it had happened, hating the Dursleys more than he'd ever hated them before.
He had no idea what to say. Did he tell them the truth? Or did he lie? The Dursleys had always said that if he told anyone about their punishments that he would get one worse than he had ever had before. But, his new friends had said that some of the things the Dursleys had said were wrong, so maybe they were about this too? The Professor might be angry with him for being a freak and getting his stuff destroyed...
When they entered the room, they were automatically bombarded with the sent of old books, standing out to Harry the most with his heightened sense of smell. As they looked around, the sent made since as there were books apon book lining every available wall in the room (save the one that has the door and a small area where the chalkboard was). Weird as it was, Harry kinda felt a bit at home in the classroom, reminded of the many times he had snuck away to read in the Library that was a couple blocks away from the Dursleys’.
As if he’d heard his thoughts, he quickly composed himself and his expression took on a more mildly amused appearance, before it turned dark again. “Why would you want to be civil with a Death Eater?” he asked, self hatred evident in his voice.
Poppy smiled kindly at him. She was leaning on the back of the chair she had sitting in front of her facing the child’s bed, greying hair askew and worry lines etched firmly on her face from years of work tending to the wounds of unruly students. She had sweat on her brow from running around the infirmary that afternoon.
Harry watched as the battered old pointed sorting hat was placed on his friend's head (he knew what it was called because Draco had told him on the train). It was on there for only a second before some of its folds moved, and it was quickly removed from his head and Draco walked over to a table that was obviously clapping.
Harry didn't even know how he had known he didn't have a toothbrush, he thought he was careful about hiding that fact. He looked at the professor with frightened eyes as he awaited the man's reaction.
Poppy knew that he wasn't telling the whole truth, and she didn't want to not did she have the strength to push him further at the moment. The way he said the last sentence he said-- like it was ingrained into him… It hurt her to her soul.
Harry was staring intently down at the price of parchment and the writing quill and looking anywhere but at his head of house, while Draco continued to give him the same death glare.
But, finding all of this out wasn't why Harry and Draco didn't go to bed right away. Harry made sure to ask Draco about everything he had missed the adults saying and for explanations of certain things.
Severus wasn't entirely going to rule out him still having some of Potter Sr.’s… oh so charming qualities, however, and planned to keep on his guard around Lily's son until he was positive that wasn't the case. He had a hunch that it wasn't, and his hunches usually weren't wrong.
He was brought back from his memories when a paw batted at his face, and he looked down and smiled at the kitten in his arms before looking back at his surroundings, surprised to see that he had gotten through the crowd and was about to walk onto the train without even realizing it. He got on and started to make his way down the train, looking through the compartment windows to see if he could spot his friends. He finally found them in one of the ones towards the back, and walked in, giving them a small smile.
Hagrid sniffed before slowly handing the child to him and the old man took the bundle with a smile. The headmaster then started to lay the child down on the doorstep of Number 4, but halted when the tell tale crack of apparition was heard.
Pansy gave him a small and sincere smile. “You are absolutely welcome.” She had to resist the urge to tell him he had no need to thank her, because she had a feeling it wouldn't bode well.
Malfoy only looked a little better than he had at he and his mother’s trials. The trials. They were definitely something that Harry definitely wouldn’t forget. The once once proud and smirking blond haired Slytherin had looked broken, a deep and hollow kind of broken. Like he had been through a hell perfectly designed to torture him and then been told that he should be normal again. Harry had felt a severe amount of empathy for him in that moment, a feeling that he knew exactly what he felt like. He had known then that he had to help him. So he remembered the bit that Malfoy and his mother had done to help him in the war, and by reciting that to the jury he managed to get both he and his mother mostly pardoned with minimal consequences. He and his mother were sentenced to six months of community service and the last Harry had heard they’d spent their time in the rebuilding of Hogwarts.
“Oh Harry…” Hermione started, the tears in her eyes a mile away from the excitement that had shown in them just a few moments before. “I'm coming through.” She said, before a whoosh sounded and suddenly she was standing in front of him, quickly pulling him into a tight hug.
Snape had creases on his face from his nose around his mouth, and his eyebrows were ever so slightly furrowed as he tried to hide his worry. He was actually sitting in his chair, the elbow that was attached to the hand that was holding up his head resting on his black cloaked knee. He was trying his best best to give Harry a kind smile.
Harry pressed his lips together as he thought for another moment. This man had said that he wouldn't be angry...truth it is. "My aunt and uncle burned them because I am a very bad boy and I don't deserve things like those.” He looked down at his feet as he said this, voice faint and barely audible, before looking up so he could see what the professor said next.
They walked down some winding staircases and into a darker, grey stone, and picture covered area. They walked a little bit further down the area, until they were led to a moving portrait with a stern looking man. The Prefect said something to the portrait, and then it swung wide open and they were led into a cozy, green coated room.
Some of his resolve to not tell anyone went away slightly at the question. “N-no ma'am.” he lied anyway.
something, was there? And if they had, who would give him anything. Before he questioned any further, he wanted to fully read through the note.
Harry was extremely smart for a four year old, able to process and understand things at least four years above his level. He had been bubbling with excitement before he had gotten there, but now that he was he was intimidated and slightly overwhelmed by all of the color changing playground equipment. But, the biggest of his worries were the other running screaming and giggling children running around the park. He didn’t think they would like him, not really. The little boy was definitely smart enough to notice that the few children he had met were only nice to him because of the scar on his forehead and after he had spoken to them for a little while they got a confused look on their face and walked away.
Malfoy looked at him in surprise, the sneer gone from his face. “Sure.” he said softly, looking away.
The door made a little more noise than he’d meant it too when it opened, and he cringed when Malfoy jumped. In a moment, he made the decision to, if he couldn’t be friends with him (which was probably very unlikely), he could at the very least offer him a truce.
He decided to ignore Malfoy’s initial sneer at his entrance into there, and offered him a small smile. “Sorry about that. Um, do you mind if I sit here? I didn’t really feel like watching Ron and Hermione go at each other and everywhere else was full.”
There was something unusual about the boy though, besides the obvious. He had noticed at dinner that the boy was shocked when the food had appeared. Not only that, but he had to be seemingly coaxed into eating when he was clearly starving. If Severus didn't know any better, he would question what kind of home life the boy had.
Draco gave a tight smile, and had a certain worry beneath his eyes that Harry could only recognize because he had seen it directed at other people, but never at him. “I want too, you’re my friend.”
That was the moment the tears finally fell. This was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for him, and he couldn't even thank them because they hadn't left a name.
"Is this true Harry? Do you not have any school things? I had thought that Headmaster Dumbledore sent someone to take you to get them." Severus already had a feeling that he knew gist of what had happened, but he wanted to see if he could get the boy to tell him himself.
They went to lunch and then transfiguration, which they all thought was going to be interesting. They were proven correct when they were given a briefing over all of the amazing things they were going to learn that year and few things they were going to learn in the next years. Things like changing a mouse into a goblet, a beetle into a button, and a lot more complicated charms. The most interesting however, was the animagus charm that they were told was very difficult. It entailed a person turning themselves into their inner animal via a very complicated process.
A few moments of comfortable silence passed as the two boys occupied themselves with different things--Harry was reading a defence book he had dug out of his bag while Draco entertained Rena--before they heard the train squeak to a stop. They were thankfully both already dressed in their school robes, as they both were surprised that they had already arrived. A quick look out the window told them that yes, they had actually arrived and weren’t stopped by something as they had been in third year (and if Harry let out a quiet sigh of relief, than who was to blame him really because this year just might be the only normal year he ever got in Hogwarts).
When they let go, Hermione was giving him a bright (if a tad bit worried) smile. “Anytime. I'm just glad you talked to me about it, I - we’ve been worried about you.”
The emptiest compartment was at the end of the train and even then there was one person in it. One person who just happened to be Draco Malfoy.
At this, Dumbledore paled slightly and sighed. “Very well.” he said simply and handed him the sleeping child in a such a put upon fashion that in any other situation, Sirius would have snorted.
I am so sorry it took me so long to update! I was suffering from writers block and lack of time. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the chapter!
Harry of course couldn't read his lips to understand what he was saying from the distance he was away from him, and deduced that he wouldn't be able to anyway because of the long white beard the Headmaster was sporting. So, he instead took to letting his eyes roam across the teachers table. When they landed on a strange looking teacher wearing a purple turban, Harry suddenly felt a sharp pain in the lightning bolt scar that rested on his forehead. He gently but subtly rubbed it, smashing down the suspicious feeling he had for now, before his eyes landed on a teacher two seats down from the purple turban wearing teacher. It just so happened, that this particular teacher had his eyes on him. The teacher had dark, almost greasy hair, a crooked nose, and had on black robes. The teacher surprisingly didn't look at him with the malice that adults and the majority of the Great Hall were showing him. He was only looking at him in extreme curiosity. Harry frowned in confusion.
They continued to speak and the Weasleys and Narcissa’s husband also joined the conversation, while the children introduced themselves to one another. Both unlikely groups became fast friends, easily adding in Blaise and Pansy’s parents to the mix when they came out of whatever shop they had disappeared to originally.
He looked up when Draco tapped him on his shoulder. “You seem deep in thought, what’s on your mind?”
Harry gave him a look that said ‘Uh, duh’ and it was so Remus like that they both burst into laughter. Sometimes it seemed unbelievable that the green eyed boy was only just barely 4 years old, with him acting so much older most of the time.
He realized then that he had been standing outside of the compartment a few seconds too long when Rena batted hat his face from his shoulder. He smiled and pet her before quickly opening the door.
Harry followed her as per her instruction, and sat down on the bed when she motioned for him to do so.
”Dumbledore’s speaking.” Draco answered pointing to the front of the Hall where the sorting ceremony took place.
Draco’s eyes widen slightly. He may be 11, but he knows that this is not normal behavior and that something is very wrong with Harry's homelife. “No, no Harry, it's okay. You can cry if you want to cry, whatever your uncle said is wrong. I just wanted to know if you were okay, and what made you so upset, I was never going to yell at you.”
“And if any of them give you a hard time, they’ll have me to answer to.” Sirius added, tickling a clearly cheered Harry.
This was all the go ahead Harry needed to get his own small portion of the large amount of food around him and start eating.
Draco was smiling through the whole exchange between his friends, though he was even more worried about Harry now, but he grinned hugely at the joy filled expression on Harry’s face. Even in the short time he had known him, he knew that the expression didn't grace him often.
Snape admitted to himself that he felt a little guilty, and resigned himself to keeping the two boys after class long enough to apologize to Harry and maybe find out some information about Harry’s deafness. He had done some personal research into the Evans and Potter family lines to find out if there was any history of deafness that ran in the families, but he hadn't found one case in their entire recorded history. It made him wonder…
“My turn.” He said and Harry nodded at him just before Draco quickly walked up to the front and sat down on the rickety old chair.
Balise gave him a warm smile, attempting to reassure him after frightening him. “Hey Harry, you gave the Great Hall a bit of a shock with your sorting ‘ey?” he said, and the way he shock told Harry he was laughing.
When he arrived back at Grimmauld Place that night, he fell straight into Remus’s arms, with a still sleeping little boy cradled in between them. “How are we going to do this Moony?” he asked hoarsely.
The boy’s pale blue eyes were soft, and much like Harry’s, looked wise beyond their years. “Of course. I’m Draco Malfoy, and this is Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini.” he said, motioning to each person respectively. “And these are my parents.” He motioned to a blond haired man and woman that were watching them curiously.
Harry flashed him a huge, breathtaking grin and held out his hand for him to shake. “Hi, I’m Harry Potter. I’m kind’ve fucked up with a lot of problems but do you think that maybe you might want to be friends?”
He decided to elaborate a little further, since she didn't seem angry or like she would throw him out just yet. He figured he could tell a few half truths. “My uncle will beat me when I am bad, and my aunt will yell at me when I don't cook dinner right. But it is always deserved--they say I am a very bad boy and bad boys have to be punished.”  Harry bit his bottom lip after that to stop himself from saying anything more.
Even though Harry nodded, Madam Pomphrey and Severus Snape knew that the boy would need some prompting. So, they both tried their best to look as kind, welcoming, and as enticing as they possibly could to get Harry to speak.
An hour or so later all three of them were called over to their parents (whom they'd just then realized were together) to eat lunch. Once they made their way over there Harry received plenty of birthday wishes and was also introduced to the rest of the Weasley family. The raven haired boy had automatically decided he liked the other set of twins in the family as well and talked animatedly with the four of them for the majority of lunch.
Remus was the one who spoke. “We don’t think you’re stupid pup, you are far, far from it. And, if any of those children think anything less of you or don’t like you because of who you are, than it’s their loss. Because, you are an amazing little boy, Harry and we both love you so much.”
Harry tensed for a moment, before relaxing and resting his head on her shoulder, returning the hug. He didn't cry though, he had decided that he had done plenty enough crying about the war over the summer.
“Malfoy, Potter, stay after class.” Snape said, giving his godson a pointed look, one that clearly told him to tell Harry what he had said because he wasn't looking.
Poppy had heard bits and pieces of the conversation, and she did not like one bit of it. She was finally fully coherent, so she was able to form the words that she wanted to. She made sure she had the boy's attention before speaking. “Listen Harry, I have a few questions for you. I need you to be completely honest with me when you answer them, I promise that neither of us will be angry with you for your answers. Is that okay?”
The family clung to each other for a little while longer, reassuring each other that they were all there. When Harry was finally set down, he was thrown into another hug by his four worried friends, and he hugged them back just as fiercely. When Harry was finally officially let go from the embraces he turned to the Malfoy family and Draco’s two friends, who were smiling at their reunion. He motioned towards them. “They helped me come back.”
Harry tightly pressed his lips together and grit his teeth. He didn't even know these people and these people didn't know him. So who were they to make assumptions about him based on other people that he didn't even know? “These people don't even know me, how dare they pretend that they do.” He said angrily, though still managing to say it in his usual soft spoken voice.
Padfoot laughed. “If you're sure.” his voice dripped in what was clearly mock doubt. He broke the act a second later at the look on the green eyed boys face (it was such a Moony I-am-disappointed-in-you face) and threw his godson over his shoulder as he ran out the door.
He laughed a little to, deciding that he definitely liked Blaise. “Seems like it, I think quite frankly that where I’m sorted is none of their business. But you know, famous and all.” Harry knew the last bit of what was supposed to have a joking tone, held a little bit of resentment, he could feel it.
Dumbledore looked at him with the same cheery expression. “Now, now Hagrid- this isn’t goodbye. You will see him again when he comes back to Hogwarts. The time will fly by in no time.”
Draco thought for moment, before his eyes widened with understanding. “I think I remember him telling me once that he was best friends with Harry's mother when they were children. Maybe he thought that she could be dominant in his personality instead of his father, who its well known he had a rivalry with.”
“Okay class, I am Professor Binns and you are going to be learning the History Of Magic…” he had a dull voice that made everyone but Harry automatically zone out.
Harry turned his attention from his gawking audience to Draco, looking at him in confusion. “Um, why are they all staring at me?” He could feel the slight waver in his voice.
Draco frowned, but couldn't push the question further because class had started and Binns began speaking.
He wrapped it up, deciding to include a small anonymous note. He then gave it to a house elf, telling it to set it at the foot of the young Potter’s bed.
The desks in the room each sat two people, so Pansy and Blaise sat together in one and Draco and Harry sat in another. Harry stared at Professor Binns in awe, still unable to believe that he was seeing an actual ghost and that they actually existed. He shook himself and carefully shifted his new quill pieces the couple pieces of parchment Draco and Professor Snape had given him on the table so it was lined up to his liking. He had to stop himself from asking his new history professor a billion questions about what it was like being a ghost and how he liked teaching the subject that he was.
“Yes you do.” Snape said, leaving it at that for the moment. He didn't think he would be able to say anything more for a few minutes while he reigned in his anger at the shy boy’s awful so called ‘family.’
Pomfrey furrowed her brows together in concern. For Severus Snape to come to her on the first day of classes with his old best friend and rivals son, asking for a checkup for the boy, things couldn't be good. “Of course.” She agreed automatically, turning to look at said boy.
Sorry for the slight cliff hanger, it was the only place I could think of to leave it off! Don't kill me!
Draco’s smile turned slightly crooked. "From what I’ve heard from my parents and godfather, Hogwarts is nothing if not grand."
All three of them jerked around to see who the new person was and tensed when they saw a very angry looking Sirius Black. Sirius, who was typically a very easy going and un-well-serious guy, was not at all a good person to deal with when pissed off. And, right now, he was way past pissed. “Just
Harry was beginning to think that that was not as innocent a question as it seemed to be, judging by the professor's face. He didn't think he could really form words to answer his almost question, but he managed. "I misbehave and Dudley is a perfect angel." his voice came out slightly resentful, and he knew, that by the end of this, he was going to get into so much trouble at the Dursley's.
“Hey, I'm sorry I told him. I just thought that he could help and I wanted you to be able to have what you need.” The blond said, giving him a worried look.
He mentally chastised himself for foolishly not considering that he may have inherited Lily's traits. Lily was the boys mother, and though he may look like James, he did have her eyes.
Harry frowned, confused now. “Uncle Vernon says that I am very stupid and that I deserve to be punished if I don’t know something. You aren’t going to punish me?”
“I am Professor McGonagall, and I am the Transfiguration teacher here at Hogwarts.” When the woman began speaking, Harry was able to read her lips, and he smiled slightly in relief, the slight resemblance to Petunia the woman held, fading. “I will be leading you into The Great Hall where you will be sorted into your houses. So…” She trailed off slightly, “I suggest you smarten up a bit.” She finished, her eyes landing on everyone of their faces at least once as she spoke, eyes deliberately directed at Harry’s hair when they landed on him. He cowered slightly, and attempted feebly to flatten his hair somewhat, a small blush touching his cheeks.
Harry’s eyes widened in wonder and hope. “He knew my parents?” He asked before he could stop himself and then a look of fear crossed his face. “Sorry, Aunt Petunia says never to ask questions, especially about my parents.”
