was the only place he was able to be and wanted to be. When he left the room on said saturday, he forced himself to stop smiling while he made his way from the seventh floor to the Ravenclaw tower. He'd been dreading the start of term because he wouldn't be able to stay in
“’s fine. Probably slept longer than usual anyways. Why are you awake? Is everything alright?”
Harry grinned shamelessly. “Yet!”
The voice in his head sounded a lot like
He gave a last pretentious giggle, let his shiny teeth flash for a last time and whipped his lilac cloak through the air as he turned around to swagger off the pitch. In the centre of the  crowd someone mumbled “finally” causing all of the players to laugh silently until the captain grasped their attention again.
They didn't talk, although Harry always had this one question lying on his lips.
Why did this elf have to be so
When the bell rang Harry did not get up. He knew he definitely should. Hermione and Ron would be waiting for him.
And then:
Malfoy was writing something. For a moment Harry thought it might be the essay they had to do for English class but when he took a closer look, it was another language he was writing in. French. Harry didn’t know anything about that either. Sirius had taught him a few words but those were mostly swears. What Malfoy was doing looked elegant and fluent. Like he had grown up doing it. His handwriting was neat and slightly slanted to the right. Perfect. How Malfoy managed that – with an actual pen at that – was entirely above Harry.
"The question is... wait, I'll just let him repeat."
following someone wearing an invisibility cloak especially so close to curfew.
Harry’s hand found Draco’s naked shoulder by accident and instinctively he broke the kiss to leave a trail of pecks and maybe one or the other hickey all along Draco’s neck, down to his collarbone.
Needed to be alone.
“I don't know. Either Chaser or Seeker probably.”
"But that means if we want to stop Snape we'd be working against
“I hope it’s important, Potter.”
Some Ravenclaw interaction in this one. Sort of.
(See the end of the chapter for
At least that's what they both thought at the time.
She laughed a beautiful laugh before reaching behind her and placing a huge present on his lap. Draco sat up in excitement.
himself and that a monster was supposed to live in it. Nothing more than a legend. And no reason to worry as long as it was closed. But his father had the key and he probably planned on slipping it to a school girl.
"I'm sure he'll be back for your birthday dinner!"

“You and me, one bludger. What do you say? Willing to give it a try?”
Harry and Ron's eyes widened in surprise.
Maybe they wouldn't want him home
"I'll join you tomorrow when you visit him again. Maybe after all Snape hasn't got anything to do with this."
"We should spy on him! We know he definitely is guilty and we need to know it when he acts."
you. Maybe this day means nothing to
This was the first time Harry got an invitation. A warm feeling filled up his chest. He'd finally found friends.
“Don’t you wanna know what Hermione is up to?”
The greasy, small wizard made what some people would call a bow towards each of them and in return received a halfhearted nod from Lucius who still wore a disgusted scowl on his lips.
“Well, what do you expect me to do,” Draco repeated his earlier question.
What a ridiculous story. What
Harry reached into his robe pocket searching for the smooth fabric but apparently he had left the invisibility cloak on the tower. When he pulled his hand out of the pocket again, a Knut got drawn out with it and fell to the floor, soundly bouncing up and down a few times before stirring to a halt in the middle of the corridor.
As if anybody would ever stick to these stupid rules.
“The audacity! You know what? I don’t care, you will come up with an ending to this dream!”
"Where's Ron? He told me that you were staying with his family for the rest of summer. You'll have to tell me everything about what happened later, I'm really -RON!"
With these words Snape left them standing in front of the bronze door knocker.
"Yeah, I mean, we would've outdone them in any challenge. It's not our fault we didn't know about it!",
“Thanks man.”
Neither of his best friends replied, bringing up a frown.
“Woah now that one was below the belt!”
? How are you still alive? And why did she call you `darling`?”
“I’m fine. Don’t worry about me.”
"You're the heir of the Malfoy fortune and you always seemed to be eager for it. I'm deeply disappointed! You're lucky it's Ravenclaw. I wouldn't tolerate a Gryffindor in my house. And a weak Hufflepuff would be inherited in an instant. -"
“Interesting concept.”
A chill was suddenly running down his spine. Not many people dared to threaten his father. When Draco finally left the room, carefully closing the door behind him, he came to the conclusion that he needed to find out more about this
Anthony Goldstein looked up at him and answered.
He didn't know anything about trolls but he was pretty sure that screaming and running around madly would NOT help to solve this. Dumbledore raised his voice and asked them to calm down.
Harry caught himself thinking about how Draco’s legs must look below that veil of fabric. Immediately he tore his gaze away from his legs and instead let it settle on something a little further up. Only a small sliver of his pointy face was visible. His platinum blonde hair was pulled back into a loose French braid, some strands had fallen out and were softly framing his sharply cut jaw.
Harry found himself lying on the floor, next to Ron and surrounded by their belongings. Hedwig was screeching in her cage, which was rolling dangerously close to the edge of platform 10.
George snorted. “Almost done, lazy ass!” He put away the final box of firecrackers and locked the storage room. After he put his jacket on and grabbed his bag, he joined Fred at the back door.
Of course! So would Draco if he had to live with a bunch of muggles!
"Is it...?"
Her voice was barely more than a whisper.
To find another connection between the stone and Snape, of course. She couldn't believe that all he was after was
"Are you alright?"
"Awesome! The Charms teacher is your head of house, isn't he?"
At least
Draco thought back to the events of the previous night and smiled. Full of hope he leaned forward, gently touching Harry’s waist with his right hand. Harry smiled back and met him in the middle. Their mingling morning breath wasn’t particularly pleasant, but the feeling of Harry’s lips pressed against his totally made up for it. After a blissful moment Harry broke the kiss and raised an eyebrow at Draco.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “Being indoors all the time is bad for my flawless skin. Try not to be late, Potter.”
“I’ll also stop going.”
Besides, Pansy was probably even more of a bully than Malfoy was. Okay, maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration. But Harry could only imagine that in combination and close up with them, they would be a nightmare.
Harry grinned. “Yeah.”
There wasn’t anything.
“What were you thinking! Flying a car through muggle London! You are still underage! Of course a Gryffindor would be involved! But Ravenclaw? You are a shame for your house! Not that I ever expected anything else, of course. You are just like your father. Stupid and reckless!”
Just when he was about to leave, he heard a tapping noise, similar to small stones being thrown against the window. He turned around and saw a white figure sitting on the window sill.
Harry snorted.
Memories of Blaise, Theo and him sneaking away from stupid dinner parties, of his mother reading to him, of afternoons with hot chocolate after playing in the snow...
Next to a certain black-haired and scar-faced boy.
Merlin, where did this kid learn to write?
“Are you going to kiss me, or what?”
“Yes, Potter. I’m fine. Stop fretting!”
Instead he found himself in the seventh floor again, after the lesson had ended, knocking on the wooden door across from the tapestry with some stupid dancing trolls. The door swung open soundlessly and Draco entered
"Of course they will. And if I fail something my father will pull some strips at the ministry and I'll be fine. He's more or less the minister's right hand at the moment. Fudge even trusted him with some top secret business which he had to attend to over Christmas. I asked him if I could help but sadly that couldn't be arranged so I had to stay at Hogwarts for the holidays. But he promised if there was a chance coming up in the future I will definitely be a part of the operation."
Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
Therefore he didn't realize when the others had stopped walking and bumped right into Harry's back.
And rejected him!
turned into an hour and he only managed to escape when she went to the bathroom for a few minutes.
“Even if neither of them are home, I just don’t feel very comfortable there. Which is why I’d rather spent my afternoon here. Among people who are either like me or supportive of it.”
“My parents are pretty conversative.”
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
Harry placed his books back in his locker. He didn’t actually need his homework done until after the weekend.
So he decided to go to the library.
Again Draco had lost control over his image. And again it had been Potter's fault. Why was it that those things always happened around
"What are you staring at, Potter? Fancy me?"
But she didn't sound sure at all.
"I don't know."
“Yeah, haha. Well, I think I guessed I would see you here. You weren't exactly shy about your love for the Tornados.”
No snores.
Nonononono SHIT! Okay, act cool! Say something!
"G-Good M-m-morning, f-first years."
"Where's father?"
Draco gulped and huffed a laugh to shake off the weight that had settled on his chest.
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
He opened his eyes in a heartbeat and found himself in a big circular room with five beds.
"How much would i get for 5?"
? Even if Draco could concentrate on stupid planet positions, he still wouldn't bother to pay attention. When the bell rang he left the classroom with an empty parchment.
“Levitate those brooms, will you?”
Harry's face split into a grin and they got to work.
Snape had taken
They kept on discussing all the time during lunch. Harry had to admit, it sounded a bit ridiculous. A teacher trying to break into a guarded room inside the school? But after all, Snape didn't seem like any of the other teachers.
"That doesn't matter right now,"
"How many canaries do you have?"
They left, disappointed.
He looked up at the other man’s face and found him smiling. Harry couldn’t recall ever having seen Draco Malfoy smile like that. It wasn’t like his polite and respectful and sometimes pitiful smiles that he wore at his workplace. It was… fond. Harry’s face started to warm up and he smiled back.
Can't even speak normally. And this calls himself a wizard!
This was none of his business.
“You know Draco, I’m really full, I don’t think I can manage drinking another one of these.”
For a moment Draco kept hesitating, but then he gave in and followed Pansy into the bathroom. Maybe it was time. He’d bought the dress four years ago and up until now he had always chickened out last minute whenever there had been a fitting event. After everything he had done during the war… let’s just say it wasn’t so pleasant anymore to be recognized by other wizards or witches.
It was then, when Harry had spoken, that he realised that he was surrounded by all four of his roommates. Staring at him in shock, with white faces. Feeling exposed he snapped,
lamp to share. You
“The way to our common room is not through there.”
From then on Draco was always on his own when Harry came looking for him. They usually spent the afternoons in the library rather than the cafeteria, especially since that one time Mr Snape had walked in and threatened Harry with detention for ‘lingering on schoolgrounds after hours’. Which was ridiculous, especially since Draco was sitting right next to him and only received a comment on the company he chose for himself.
Draco was shaking like a leaf but this time he wasn't crying. He was sick of tears. He was not weak. And he made a silent vow to himself to never cry again.
"I'm fine, Mrs Weasley! Really!"
Stupid scarface.
"Mister Harry Potter is a great man, even greater than you praised him to be! He offered me to
"You know, we've got this
“The car! We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”
With a wide grin on his face, Draco stretched his neck to steal another kiss from Harry. Then he made himself comfortable in the other man’s arms again.
For a moment Harry wasn’t quite sure where this was going, but it became clear quickly as Draco continued talking.
Harry decided.
“Well, what are you waiting for?”
The asian girl, Cho, gave him a questioning glance. She surely wanted to know why he was being alone all the time.
And if you just so happened to leave a comment that would make me very happy and motivate me immensely to get back into a regular posting schedule for this fic :)
None of his business!
Draco looked up. All this time he hadn't realized that someone else was in the dorm.
And this turban was just ridiculous.
Ron huffed out, sounding rather impressed.
He nodded.
During Dinner they made a lot of suggestions, most of them immediately crossed out by Hermione.
TW: another bad attempt at writing Hagrid’s accent lmao
He repeated his fathers words in his mind,
Suddenly he had the urge to hum along to the music. Immediately he shook it off.
She led him to another broom cupboard and opened it. Then she stepped aside and suddenly all the pieces fell into place. His voice was croaky and tiny as he swore, “Fucking Salazar.”
No, of course he did not want Potter to see him like this. This was ridiculous.
He'd taken a liking to them ever since he’d seen them pulling that prank on their mother.
“I’m just- I don’t know. What if they think I’m not the right one for you? I mean, we’re so different and… yeah. I know it’s stupid.”
“Oh, Percy dear! How are you?”
Draco groaned. What had he gotten himself into? “If you insist, Potter. But only after you’ve made me some breakfast.”
The three friends shared a look. They had just found out that Snape or whoever it was knew how to get past the three headed dog. Apparently the mysterious stranger who gave Hagrid the dragon egg had asked him some questions about Fluffy in return. The only chance to save the stone was if Dumbledore placed it somewhere else. But now that he was gone...
He froze.
It was pure
Harry placed a peck on Draco’s flushed cheekbone.
and you weren't here. You go upstairs and tell him you're sorry,
Draco didn’t acknowledge Harry’s presence at all as he sat down next to him, voicing a greeting. He scanned the other boy’s face for any reaction. Any emotion.
The adressed boy ignored him. Maybe this was childish but his mother was right. His birthday meant something to Draco and his father decided that selling some stuff had been more important, not even talking about how he wouldn't even be apologising if it wasn't for his mother.
would be
"Hey, cool radio! Where have you got it from ?"
Of course he would share his sweets with a friend in a situation like this but Potter wasn't his friend. He'd had his chance. And he'd missed it. So what if no one cared about
When he finally heard the door creak open he sighed in relief and turned over once more to immediately be welcomed by a dreamless slumber.
“Have you decided what position you want, yet?”
the asshole here?”
“What? It’s not that late yet, is it?”
When Harry entered the great hall he was greeted by a great feast. In order to make the tables look less empty only the seats near the teachers table were set.
Hermione said.
Draco had tried his best to avoid the Scarface ever since. Except their detention of course. No Malfoy had ever been forced to do such disgusting, filthy house elf work before. He really was a shame for his family. Potter had worked a lot faster than him but he had looked like he hated it even more. There had been a moment where Draco almost felt sorry - No, there hadn't been a moment!
"Ugh, what a
Stay safe, immortals <3
to get onto the Quidditch team. Sure, Malfoy had much more practice but Harry was doing it to make his father proud and this was the perfect motivation.
- as the sorting hat shouted this out loud, Draco's face went blank in shock.
as well as great skill and good thinking, I award Ravenclaw house one hundred points."
"So you saw the door open and decided it would be a great idea to just check what in there could be so dangerous before closing the the door?"
"Isn't that illegal?",
"Hey, Harry! Remember my brothers?"
“Oh. I thought it was.”
"Wow, that sounds like some dark shit..."
“Harry, mate, some people are just assholes. His father is an asshole, so that’s probably how he inherited that shit.”
It felt ... charmed.
“From the vending machine. I was about to get myself a coke and figured I could bring you something as well.”
“But ‘Mione, that’ll be the third Rom Com in a row! That’s at least one too many!”
He hated giving speeches. God, he hated it so much. It was probably the worst part of his far-from-glamorous job as the head-auror.
The cheers exploding around Harry were so loud, he believed his ear-drums were bursting. Who was able to do basic Math -and every Ravenclaw certainly was- knew that Ravenclaw was now placed in first, while Gryffindor was in second place with only four points less. The faces at the Slytherin table looked dangerously angry; they now had no chance left to win the house cup this year. But Dumbledore wasn't finished.
Again there was a mumble of agreement.
“I never said they were sexy you mutt!”
The soft and warm voice seemed to surround him.
The brothers he all knew from school already, except the very oldest one. But neither Bill nor Charlie were in town as they both worked abroad so Harry didn't get the chance to meet him. He also would've liked to thank Charlie for his help with a certain Dragon Problem. Seemed like he had to do that another time.
And once again fate would prove him wrong.
Draco didn't come to any new conclusions over the following few weeks.
"Wanna share?"
"What's an
“Are you alright mate?”
"Do you think they'll be easy?"

but wanted to see the objects his father wanted to sell first. Also he wouldn't ever buy anything like
“You know, I would offer to teach you how to do it properly, but my rates are probably too high for you. Judging by your clothes at least. Everything from before last season. And you don’t even know how to combine pieces properly.” She faked a shudder, a wide, nasty grin on her face.
After a while he thought maybe he should share something with Harry. If they wanted this relationship to work, they both needed to stop avoiding talking about a certain time period. He would start with one of the better memories though. They had plenty of time to work themselves through to the rough parts.
Seemed like whoever had entered the corridor had just spotted the monster.
I’m very sorry for the long wait. If you’ve been following what else I’ve been posting in the past few months, you’ll know I was a bit preoccupied. However, as soon as August comes to an end I will try to get back to some kind of a regular posting rhythm with this fic!
This chapter is kind of a mess and I’m not sure I did the accent well enough so if you had struggles or thoughts while reading this, please comment!
Cursing, he jumped to his feet and hurried over to his dear owl, picking up the cage and holding onto it tightly. Only then he became aware of all those people, who had stopped and stared at them openly and judging. Harry cast a rash glance at Ron who was still groaning on the floor. Wrecking his brain for a credible explanation he cleared his throat and spoke up.
"What was that thing anyway?"
Then there were barks. Deep, loud barks. He took a step back and started to run again.
Crabbe and Goyle immediately believed his story as well. Only Blaise shot him a weird glance but the expression disappeared when Draco pulled off his trademark smirk.
“Your staring is distracting me, Potter. Don’t you have a Weasel to tend to or something.”
"This... kind of explains a lot!"
"Aww... never earned so much as a single point for your house, did you, dumbass?!"
But here? It was scary.
She raised her wand and Draco hadn’t had the power to complain. He still mistrusted her magical hairstyling abilities a bit, though.
Nononononono! This couldn't be happening. It was his first day at Hogwarts and everything went wrong already.
“Yeah, I’ll just be one more minute!”
“I’m coming over for lunch because your mother and I need to discuss some things about the presentation she will hold for my history 9th graders.”
7:30 am. Way too early to be up and running on a Sunday. Draco frowned. Something about the wand in his hand felt weird. He took a closer look at it and just like that things fell back into place. With a tight throat he put back the wand and turned over.
“You in, Peter?” Sirius’s face was positively glowing, the way it always seemed to when Remus was the subject matter.
When Harry had to go to the Forest, Draco was beside himself. This being, this person who had suddenly meant so much to him was about to be gone forever.
His stare held daggers in their direction, and it was only a moment before they became aware of his position.
Draco’s tone was a shaky indulgence to the fear that gripped his being.
Harry’s brow creased, completely aware of Lucius Malfoy’s conceit and cruel demeanor but lacking in Draco’s observance of it.
“Obliviate!” He called, and then rapidly turned to Severus and Bellatrix. “Obliviate! Obliviate!” And finally to Malfoy. “OBLIVIATE!”
Harry felt a small involuntary sigh emerge from deep within his chest, but it didn’t do much to quell the ringing in his ears or the pounding of his pulse.
The train chugged busily from view as the memory came to a close. He patiently awaited for what was to come next.
“I happen to disagree. The more darkness you feel and experience, the bigger I become. And the more power I receive.”
And then a house full of Slytherins would be ruminating on the fact that Harry Potter was unapologetically gay and that he’d tried to flirt unintentionally with their king.
“Remus? Where are you?” Sirius called, noticing the emptiness before them.
“Of course.”
Black leaned back, studying the leaves on the branches above him. “I wonder if it has to do with how close we’ve all become,” he said thoughtfully. “The more time we spend with Remus, the harder it is to be away from him. I wonder if he feels that, too.”
Draco’s brow was narrowed, clearly wondering the same thing. He remained silent, awaiting the headmaster’s orders earnestly.
When he turned to answer, that warmth radiated straight outward from his body in an invisible pull toward Malfoy. He felt himself blush considerably and prayed that the other didn’t notice.
In the emptiness, he felt the sudden solidity of friendship.
His eyes are prickly again, and he swallows a hard lump in the back of his throat. “I love the sound of that. Of family.”
“Werewolves are usually executed or sent to reservations. They’re not allowed to have an education. And yet... look at them.”
Potter continued to sob, and for once Draco didn’t care that his robes would probably leave stained with snot and the like. This feeling, this completeness; it sent Draco reeling. Was this what he’d been missing all these years?
“Are you sure of your solitude?”
Harry reaches across the table for the peppermint oil, only to be slapped on the hand by his potions partner.
it was to see the positive sides when you are locked in your room with bars in front of your window and getting cold soup shoved through a cat-flap once a day?
“Ah, yes.”
for a quick chat but not only was he sure that his next chat with
"It was Potter. He did something to me that makes me feel weird things and makes me wanna act all
Well, this was maybe his only chance to find out. As Draco went straight towards the desk he spotted an already opened letter lying next to the book. He  scanned it with his eyes fast without picking it up in order to avoid making Lucius suspicious. The contents made him gulp. It was from a shop owner in Knockturn Alley. Obviously a reply to a former letter sent by his father. It said something about how he would accept the
Then he had to make dinner - here he finally got an acceptable amount of food to himself - and do the dishes again.
Confused, he pushed the door open and found his three roommates crouched over something on Corner's bed. It seemed they hadn't even heard him entering the dorm.
Draco wanted to talk to Lucius about getting a new broom for his birthday - which was the day after, by the way- because he wanted to enter the Quidditch team that year. Seemingly Malfoy senior was not available at the moment. Still his son pushed the door to his office open and immediately froze in his tracks. On the desk there was a dark, wooden box. It was open. And next to it was a diary like book with a black leather cover.
After a bit Harry raised his head and locked eyes with Draco. He immediately turned away, towards Pansy.
. The usually rather cheerful big man (well, Draco wasn't even sure that he was an
And somehow he wasn't all that surprised when he arrived there and found none other than Harry Potter sitting on the exact same bed he'd had occupied throughout the previous year. Channeling all the annoyance and hatred he had in him he scoffed and said,
He left the dorm, closing the door behind him quietly and stepped down to the common room.
Anyway, he'd read it on the same day he'd gotten it because although both of his parents had attended this school and his friends would be there he'd been a bit afraid of coming here and wanted to know as much as possible about the castle so there wouldn't be any bad surprises.
"One last thing to say!"
“But I’ve never done anything to him. I just want to know why!” He slammed his own locker door to underline his words. Hermione glared at him and he would probably have apologized if it wasn’t for Ron.
“Okay, we’ll fix that later. Seekers you'll start. Easy task: I'll let off one snitch, whoever catches it has the position. If you don't win, feel free to try out for something else.”
is going on here? Why aren't you in your common rooms?"
Exitedly he sat up and reached for one of the smaller packages on the top. These were most likely sweets. Before he ripped it open though, he glanced over to the bed next to his. It had grown to a bit of an habit to check on H-... Potter.
He had so much stuff planned out to annoy all the Gryffindorks and to make fun of others and now he hadn't even got a chance to pull these pranks with his friends because...
Draco Lucius Malfoy would never betray his name ever again.
"Potter, Harry!"
Cliffhanger? Kind of but actually not as most of you probably remember what happens next.
“Mhm, get back to kissing me, Potter!”
With Hufflepuff.
When they arrived at Platform 9 ¾  Draco hurriedly said his goodbyes to his parents and disappeared into the crowd. During the summer he had become more and more uneasy around his father. The man that he looked up to had most definitely changed a lot. Lucius almost never left his study and when he did he was either “getting business done” or complaining that he was wasting his time not doing exactly that. Of course Draco understood that his father’s business was important.
Snape will most definitely not try and steal the stone! He has our headmaster's trust and I'm standing behind that decision as well. Now if you would please return to your common rooms, I have exams to grade."
He didn't return the wishes but just took off the robes before joining his father at the door. Then they left for the bookshop where Lucius once again left him in order to buy some quills on the other side of the Alley. Draco wanted to look for a new quill himself after he'd picked up the books but he wasn't prepared for the sheer amount of people waiting at the counter. It was horrible and nothing seemed to be moving. When he saw the sign explaining what was going on he rolled his eyes and went upstairs. This could take ages so he might as well just use the time to do some further research on creatures that could possibly be the inhabitant of the chamber of secrets. In the course of the past three weeks he had narrowed it down to creatures with these attributes:
Harry frowned, abruptly realising Narcissa was trying to say something to him. Something the aurors shouldn’t know. The forrest was a dark place? Yes, clearly. Harry had died in the forest.
But Malfoy did not try to take it. He simply lifted his hand, and made Harry point the wand at his chest.
The kind of love where you would die to save them.
If Voldemort had heard what Malfoy had just said, he’d be dead before he hit the ground. The dark wizard would never consider deception such as this. It would be too much like admitting defeat, to admit that there was a possibility of their side winning.
It would take no other master, and so it chose to die with him.
Why was Narcissa willing to give her son up for their cause?
“This is my atonement, Harry Potter. For what I’ve done. I’m not a good person.”
Now he had all the time in the world to stare at Draco Malfoy’ body. It wasn’t morbid curiosity, as much as he wished it was.
Harry had to bite his lip at the blooded slur. He wanted to react, to remind Malfoy he had no right to use that word, but Malfoy was so far away and Harry was afraid to bring him back. Malfoy had obviously thought about this war a lot, and it seemed odd to be so pessimistic about it, since he was on the winning side of the war.
Malfoy scoffed.
He felt it ache, in chest. The part of his soul that ripped when he used that horrible, unforgivable curse. He knew it would ache for the rest of his life.
Without speaking, Ron took and step backwards and Harry took one forwards, Hermione moving to open the heavy wooden door and soon they were stepping out into the wonderful sunshine.
“Harry.”
“Take his arms, Ron will take his feet.” She instructed, voice firm but gentle. When neither of them moved to touch Draco, she gritted her teeth.
“We still have ten minutes. Why are you so eager to die, Malfoy?” He said, still holding his wand up at Malfoy’s chest.
He wished he hadn’t asked, because when Malfoy looked at him, he looked like a stranger. His eyes were dark and sad, deep soft pools of mercury with no fire or spite or any other emotion Harry recognised. His shoulders were curled forward, making himself appear smaller as his hands stayed firmly clasped in his lap. The bruise on his cheek was fully fleshed out, a dark smear against his pale skin. It was faintly red too, from where Harry slapped him. He felt a spike of guilt shoot through his chest. He swallowed heavily, attempting to ease the ache it left.
“This war will be over with us, Potter.” Malfoy whispered, his voice loud in the silence.
He’d die making sure it was.
Their lives had never been theirs. Draco was born to a death eater father and expected to follow, and Harry was painted a hero for surviving a double murder. Both dragged into a war when they were barely able to crawl. Draco wasn’t a villain and Harry wasn’t a hero. This was not a story book, nothing was that simple.
After all, the horcruxes had to be destroyed for them to win. It was a horrible truth, he now realised; but despite its depravity, it was still true. And Harry was a Horcrux.
He was so ready and willing and it was almost too much to bare.
Malfoy was evidently looking for something, but obviously wasn’t expecting to get a knock over the head.
He looked like a scared child in a black suit, rather than a death eater.
He wasn’t sure what he was crying for. Maybe it was the injustice of it all. Maybe it was that now Harry had to sacrifice his morals and kill Malfoy in cold blood.
Trusting him wasn’t.
“I refuse.” He said, and let Malfoy go, turning to walk away.
Harry growled as Malfoy heaved himself to his feet and started running away. Harry reached for his ankle from where he knelt, trying to bring Malfoy down again, but missed. Malfoy darted across the garden, quick as a ferret, stumbling over half-dead plants and barely glancing back at Harry. He darted up the stone steps of the hut as Harry followed closely with red-tinged vision, and yanked the door open hard. Harry raced after him, enraged that Malfoy was going to destroy this once last peaceful place.
Harry felt a lone tear slip from his eye.
“Mate.” Ron called, drawing his sluggish attention. “What was that?”
He climbed off Malfoy suddenly, yanking the older boy off the floor to stand. Malfoy went easily, didn’t fight or push back as Harry dragged him across the room by his clothes and shoved him into the chair at the table. Malfoy sat without complaint, hands placed on his lap as he looked at the floor. Harry had never touched Malfoy without some sort of backlash, and now he was just quiet and complacent even as Harry just manhandled him into a chair.
“I had to. I needed for you guys to live through the war. I needed the war to end.” He whispered, wiping away the influx of tears with his sleeve.
He already knew what their fall from grace looked like on Draco, but it still left a bitter taste in Harry’s mouth to see it on his mother.
“We need to do something, now.” He whispered, and they immediately nodded, faces firm. They were used to doing things quickly, performing urgent tasks with no warning. The firmness of their faces stunned him a moment, because the war has changed them more than he realised.
Harry didn’t really know what to do, how to respond when Malfoy went off script.
Wait. Malfoy didn’t have a wand, because it was in Harry’s pocket. He came here, defenceless, on purpose. Why hadn’t Harry noticed that?
“Voldemort preyed on how close minded the pure bloods were. Used their ignorance as his power, using Mudbloods and muggles as scrape-goats to incite anger and loyalty. There’s nothing that unites a force more than othering.”
So naive.
Harry couldn’t take much more of this. He didn’t recognise the person in front of him, and he didn’t know if he could take knowing why. Was Malfoy always like this behind the front of anger and pride he put on for the school and his father? Or did the war change him?
He wondered if Draco had been scared his whole life.
He wondered what that made him.
Swallow it down.
“You’re an arsehole, Malfoy, but you were good when it mattered. You didn’t kill Dumbledore. You didn’t give me up to Bellatrix. You were cruel and dumb, but you understand your own failings and now you’re trying to fix them.” He reached for Malfoy, gripping his shoulder and ignoring the feeling of Malfoy’s bones under his skin. “I don’t know about you, but that sounds like a good person to me.”
They were pawns to Voldemort. Pawns to power.
Silence suddenly fell, as they both stopped moving, nothing but the sound of their harsh breathing filling the space. The door shut heavily behind them as the moment settled, making the space darker than Harry would have liked. Malfoy’s hair was loose around his face, drawing his attention now as it glowed bright blonde in the dimness of the room.
“You need to swallow you pride and bury the boy we let die for us.”
“Avada Kedavra.”
“I’m a Horcrux, Harry.”
Malfoy looked up at him without moving his head, grey eyes striking through his white blonde hair.
“It’s not like anyone will know what I did today, Harry. Only my mother will, but they probably won’t listen to her long enough to tell.”
Some more than others.
He almost wanted to laugh. It just didn’t feel real that Draco Malfoy sat before him, defenceless, asking to be killed.
Harry realised Draco’s death would have long lasting impacts across their society, signalling the end of pureblood aristocracy and elitism.
Harry fell back in his chair, stunned. All thoughts of manipulation discarded from his mind.
“Maybe, Potter.” He said, but the humour died as suddenly as it came. Malfoy looked at his muggle watch under his tattered sleeve.
Harry wanted to remind her of her history with the Malfoys, when Ron hissed.
Possibly, it could have been his father. Lucuius Malfoy was a master manipulator, one of the reason Voldemort came to power so quickly in the ministry. Malfoy had always been his fathers son, always been the tool Lucius used to get to him or spy on him, but Harry discarded the idea. Lucius would never put Malfoy up to something like this. He was too prideful to make his son grovel to Harry, deception or otherwise.
Ron stumbled slightly as they rose, unprepared for the dead weight of Draco’s legs. Harry didn’t falter, even if it felt like Draco’s dead weight was going to drag him down to hell.
And for some bizarre reason that made Malfoy smile, it was a tiny thing, but it was there.
“Why have you been trying to fight death all day up until now?” Harry asked. “Why couldn’t you jump in front of one of the curses being thrown around if you need to die so bad?”
“Because she’s about to help you win the war.” Malfoy hissed, voice a little quieter but nonetheless angry and upset.
He had hurt Draco more than Voldemort ever could.
“Voldemort treated him like a slave, held my mother hostage and kept me locked up like an insurance plan.”
Draco had paid the ultimate price for them. For their lives.
He cried silently, blinking away the tears as he continued to run a hand through a Draco’s hair, like the affection could somehow reach his soul and...soothe it.
He wanted to leave Hogwarts and never come back. He wanted to go to sleep, bury his head under the covers and not think or feel. He wanted to forget about Draco Malfoy, just as everyone else in the damn castle had done. But he couldn’t. He had to cling to the morals he had left.
Draco’s sacrifice would be worth it.
“I’m sorry.” He said, instead, because it was the only thing he could do.
Harry wanted to scoff, but it came out as a wet choke. He’d seen many good people die to those curses today, so they certainly did work.
Harry dared not breathe, because this was Malfoy with his walls down.
They were just kids trying to survive.
He was so young, and now he would no longer age. His skin was clear of wrinkles, of sun spots and freckles beyond the faint dusting on his cheeks.
“Oh no....oh no....you really are a Horcrux.” He said, and that’s when the tears finally came.
Harry remembered his first time in Ollivander’s, how crazy the man had seemed when talking about the wands making decisions and choosing the wizard. Harry had never quite believed that they were sentient, or could make choices.
He punched Malfoy in the stomach and the other boy’s breath left him in a choking gasp, head thrown back against the soil beneath them. Malfoy stilled, taking a moment to breathe and he gasped in oxygen. Harry hoped the gits hair turned brown from the dirt.
“I have one request.” Malfoy interrupted quietly, just as Harry was mustering the courage to do it.
There was a jagged scar, like a blunt rusted knife had been lashed across the skin down to the bone. Without thinking, Harry’s hand reached out to touch it. Malfoy’s skin was warm, and the scar was angry and raised under his fingers.
And it looked like he took that chance with Draco Malfoy.
“Nobody can know.” Hermione whispered, and Harry just nodded.
The expectations must have been cloying. Harry had only known parents as protectors and overflowing with love. Ones that wanted only the best for him. Both his parents and the Wesley’s had proved that to him.
“We need to get started.” He spoke, and looked to see Hermione already summoning two shovels. “Nobody can suspect what we are doing.”
Harry had taken everything from him.
“Why are you here, Malfoy? What do you need from me?” He asked. Malfoy bit his lip, but when he spoke it was with conviction.
“I need you to kill me, Potter.”
The magic left him, sharply and painful like it ripped part of his flesh away with it. He flinched away feebly at the horrible feeling, but it didn’t leave. He bent over trying to breathe through the stinging pain of casting a unforgivable, clutching where he felt his soul rip.
He wondered what happened to those carefree kids.
He felt Ron’s hand grip onto his shoulder, strong and firm. Harry shoved back the tears firmly as Ron started rubbing his thumb over Harry’s shoulder blade comfortingly.
And in the next second he’d realised what he’d done. He stopped moving, stopped breathing. He kept his eyes closed as the quietness settled in the room. Only his own breathing could be heard.
Harry hoped that Voldemort would drop dead when he killed him. But he knew it wasn’t true, for the snake still lived. Only he and the snake were left, and he knew if given the opportunity; Neville would do his part.
“Malfoy...why is your family like this?” He asked. The Malfoy’s were beyond cruel to the point where they would consume their own for power. Where a mother would lead her son to his death so she could be safe.
“So did my brother.” He replied, and Hermione closed her eyes momentarily.
He blinked, realised he’d been staring down at Draco’s chest, at the place where his spell had no doubt hit the blonde. He wished there was a mark, a scorch, anything. Something to prove how he died, what he’d done.
Harry realised how much of a stranger Malfoy truely was.
They said he’d disappeared into Muggle London, or ran away with a girl to France. The most popular theory was that he was living a life of luxury on a remote island in the Caribbean.
“Where is Draco Malfoy?”
Eye contact was another form of challenge which Malfoy had never backed down on, until now.
Harry wanted to throw up. He squatted down, balancing on the balls of his feet as he rested his elbows on his knees. He pressed his thumbs firmly against his temples, trying to not to lose it in front of Malfoy.
“Like what?” Harry asked, because he didn’t know what else to say. Malfoy was not following their usual script, one of anger and sharp comebacks thrown like barbs at each other.
“I’m sorry.” He said, because what else could he say? He couldn’t change their past.
“How are you here? Wouldn’t he be protecting you?”
It made him feel sick to the bottom of his stomach.
“We know, Harry. We know.” She said, but they didn’t. He gave up more than his own life today.
Harry felt a wave of remorse. Even now, she spoke in code, refused to reveal what Harry did to Draco. Harry didn’t deserve her protection from what he had done.
And Draco’s is a fucking doe.
Draco’s eyes widened with sudden enlightenment. A further understanding of what he already knew.
Harry watched with his mouth agape, feet glued to his spot next to Pansy.
He didn’t dare answer, though he knew immediately what the previous night would have entailed.
Draco kept up, each press of his shoe against the dirt a match to Harry’s. He didn’t have to see Draco’s face in the darkness to know that he was worried. He could feel the emotion rolling off of him as they treaded forward.
At this, Sirius let out a loud guffaw. “My God, Rem. If I didn’t know you better, I wouldn’t question that a damn bit.”
After the wolf led a trail of sniffs down Jame’s back and Peter’s tail, it seemed to move on and accept them as if they’d always been there.
“It IS the right thing! Because muggle-Borns are unworthy! Just like you.”
In his sleep, Remus Lupin smiled.
And then, he was out of sight, and Draco returned to battle.
“I- I don’t know. Sirius never told me...”
“He’s not lying, Ron.”
“But, Evans...”
“I know, Sirius. Me too. My best bet is to make it through the school year, and maybe I can run away or something...”
“Fucking Potter, always being right.” He mutters to himself, wishing he hadn’t ended up here. Wishing he wasn’t thinking about stupid Potter.
It was then that he noticed the soft puff of air emanating from his nostrils, creating a modest whistle as it was expelled. He was breathing.
Harry couldn’t help but smile slightly at the similarity, pressing forward with vigor.
“Are you Alright?” She asked James, who smiled comfortingly.
Wordlessly, Harry and Draco had become inseparable. It was understood that he wouldn’t want to go back to Malfoy Manor and somehow Grimmauld Place had become more like home anyway. His mother visited often, bringing sweet treats and trinkets from the city.
He refused to let this be the end. His brow narrowed, he gripped his hawthorn tightly and focused more energy than he’d ever thrown into a spell before into the one he was preparing now.
This time, Pettigrew and Potter himself were absent. In their place was a relaxed Sirius Black, seated casually next to a laughing Remus Lupin.
A shadow, tall and dark, resting against a shelf less than 100 meters from him. He blinked, readjusting. The figure remained. He began pacing forward, hurriedly hoping that this possible toast to his insanity would hold the answers he yearned for.
“So, I got another apology owl from Pete last week.” Remus spoke as he forked his now second piece.
One was a shorter girl with shoulder length black hair and a sneer that would put you in your place without a word.
“Can you promise me that?”
Lily nodded. “He’s much happier here.”
Draco reveled in their combat, pointing his own wand in his fight for freedom.
They both took a seat, crossing their legs and getting comfortable in front of him.
Moony continued to work on the map, grateful that the focus was off of his own name.
He turned the corner up, inviting him to climb in.
Harry laughed as their attention turned back to the front.
Harry glanced back and forth, taking in the scene before him, trying to comprehend not only what was happening but also what in the fuck happened to Draco.
Harry never realized that Draco Malfoy was perhaps the greatest actor he’d ever met. Self-preserving, self-respecting. Bold. All qualities he’d come to admire.
He whimpered softly, uncontrollably as they disappeared and were replaced again by darkness.
“Today, you will be working with one of my most prized possessions. This,” he tapped his wand against a circular basin that was propped on his desk, “is a pensieve.”
“He liked the stars.” She choked out, before she was grabbed and dragged down the hall, out of sight.
He left quickly, before he could watch Neville’s eyes lose focus on his face as he disappeared into invisibility. He pushed one foot in front of the other, trying to forget the fiercely loyal friend that Neville had become.
He’d never sat with a body before. He’d seen plenty of them, but there was no time to mourn over them. They were a simple and devastating acknowledgement, before he moved onwards to fight the battle that he couldn’t escape from.
He had no energy, but he didn’t dare drop Draco. Ignored his arms complaints, even as they grew louder in his mind, throbbing constantly. He didn’t even let his muscles unlock, or ease for a moment.
It was so empty and exhausted.
“I’m sorry, but it’s true. He was a Horcrux. We knew from the beginning that we had to destroy every single one.”
Harry just hadn’t known that the familiar cruelty could be afforded to his own son.
He was never going to escape Voldemort.
“Oh.” Was all he managed. He felt like all his insides had been scooped out and he was nothing but hollow.
“He was good when it mattered.”
It scared Harry a little.
Hermione stopped, pushing her shovel into the dirt and staring Harry down.
He’d planned this, carefully. Harry realised Malfoy and his mother had risked much for him to be here.
He didn’t have to wonder how much it had hurt her to realise she couldn’t save her son. Harry knew how it felt.
He didn’t want to think about what would happen if it didn’t. That was why he had to do this, for them to have a fighting chance.
“Thank.....Mrs Malfoy...what-“ she cut him off.
He leant forward, and placed it between Draco’s folded hands, pressed against his chest.
“Harry, stop. You can’t go over it again and again. You can’t change what happened.”
This he knew how to respond to. This he understood.
“I think you already know.” Was all Malfoy said in response
But his eyes caught the blank grey ones, staring lifelessly at the ceiling.
Malfoy always met people’s eyes. He never looked away, as though doing so would make him weak. Not once in his life had Malfoy refused to look him in the eyes when they’d been near each other.
It was less about trust and more about fear.
“You didn’t have a choice. I would have done the same if my family was threatened.” Harry tried to be gentle, comforting. Malfoy just shook his head, backing away another step.
Harry was really doing this. He was really doing this. He was going to kill Malfoy and leave him here and nobody would know.
He couldn’t afford to waste any more time on emotions or goodbyes.
Harry reminded himself to breathe.
Harry blinked, looking around. They were in a clearing, in the middle of the forest. He looked up, and the sun shone strongly through the edges of the trees. It wasn’t far from where he had died.
He dug his nails into the palm of his hands, using the biting pain to keep him moving. To walk down the hill to where Hagrid’s hut sat innocently.
Harry ran his fingers lightly through Draco’s wavy hair, perfectly soft and smooth under his fingers. Back and forth over his scalp, tufts of it catching between his fingers. He wondered if Draco had ever been touched like this. If he had ever known the kindness of a soft touch.
He knew he would lose his resolve if Hermione started crying, or watch that horrible dead look take over Ron’s eyes. He couldn’t see them.
He looked up at the sky as he went, avoiding looking into the dark forrest where he would die. It looked like the day ahead would have beautiful weather, warm enough to enjoy the outdoors. He wondered if any of his friends would have time to enjoy it, to breathe in the fresh air and know they were free.
Neville met his eyes again.
Fate had to take another thing from him before he could go.
He had to decide right then what path he was going to take. Was he going to leave Draco there, and never tell anyone what happened; or was he going to honour Narcissa’s wishes?
“You knocked over the rock over there.” Neville said, pointing a dirty and bloody hand to a rock that laid behind Harry, still rocking a little on his sharp edge. He must have knocked it off the pile of rocks and dust with his cloak.
“Sense me?”
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione whispered, her hand coming up to wipe away the tears he hadn’t realised were running down his cheeks.
“I am tired of your sympathy. I know I am beyond that now. I’m tired of this war, Potter. I need this.”
“I laughed when Ginny Weasley and Hermione Granger got petrified.” Malfoy hissed, voice cruel and mean all of a sudden, The tone was familiar from Malfoy, and Harry immediately focused on it, in a sense of self preservation. He prepared for Malfoy to strike in some way. “I hurt Katie Bell. I have bullied you for seven years. Do it.”
“You have no idea, Ron.” Hermione hissed, voice thick with tears. “You have no idea how I feel. I will never forget what his aunt did to me, hell, what Malfoy himself did to me; but he died for us. He gave more than most of the wizarding world for our cause.”
He forced himself to open his eyes, to look at what he had done.
The quietness of the moment was destroyed by the distinct sound of a leaf being crunched under a foot. Harry whipped around, eyes searching as his hand reached for his wand, and felt his breath catch in his throat.
“We need to bury him.” Hermione said, standing to her feet. She beckoned Ron over, before coming and gently guiding Harry towards the body by his shoulders.
“That’s different.” Harry said, and tried to ignore the feeling of Malfoy’s heart beating wildly against his hands. He hid it well, but his heart didn’t lie. He was scared.
“He didn’t stop me from getting the mark, Harry.” Malfoy responded, tone suddenly dry, like he’d attempted for humorous and fell short. There were faint rustling sounds as he did back up his shirt. “My mother didn’t know what he did until it was over, but my Father was happy. He thought it was a honour to the Malfoy’s.”
Harry forced himself to take a step forward, to etch the sight into his memory. He deserved to die thinking about what he’d done to Draco. He’d done what he had to, for everyone else’s futures, but that didn’t mean he could ignore what he had to sacrifice for it to be so. He stepped forward, and tried desperately not to regret it.
Two Auror’s stood next to her, watching and waiting. Harry tried not to look at them.
Voldemort had prepared that they would find the Horcruxes, and made one that nobody would expect. They’d hesitate to kill him, try and manipulate themselves around it if given half the chance. But when it came down to it, they eventually would. They would lose too much if they didn’t.
Harry supposed it didn’t matter, as he arranged Draco laying flat. The worms would get to him quick enough.
Perhaps one day, they would realise what the war had cost after all.
And then, with a smile that was becoming characteristic of Draco Malfoy, he spoke:  “Remus Lupin, you prat.”
“Potter- Are Black and Lupin, are they...” his voice wasn’t disgusted, or spiteful. There was an honest, almost hopeful tone hanging between his words.
The next moment found a quidditch book thrown in their direction. Laughter filled the room, and Harry caught himself smiling.
This was it, this was the end. There was nothing he could do. There was no Draco to save him...
He trotted in the opposite direction, robes billowing slightly at the quickness of his pace. Not a microsecond had passed before an instinct-driven James and Lily were on their feet and calling after him.
Darkness. Everything was pitch black and eerily silent. Peacefully grounding Harry was the soft squeeze of Draco’s hand in his. He took a risk, lacing their fingers as the world settled into the darkest of nights.
“Okay, well, the one you refused to learn Defense from in third year?”
Lily’s look of concern was tight against her face; the expression in Regulus Black’s eyes was nothing short of fear.
“Oh, Draco.” She placed her hands on each of his shoulders. “Butterflies. A whirlwind of emotion. A longing to never let each other go.” She drew her words dramatically, banking on the edges of hopeless romance. And then, she laughed.
His stomach clenches. How has everything he’d known to be true flipped in just a matter of minutes? How did he end up here, begging his arch nemesis to be alive?
“Lupin... he’s... he’s a w-w-erewolf.”
“I think James is right, Sirius.” Lily spoke, eyeing him with genuine understanding.
In the months following the war, it’s Draco Malfoy who quells the nightmares, who pulls up the sheets at Grimmauld Place and holds him when the stench of death hangs heavy. Who helps to re-build the castle, still struggling with the guilt of his former decisions. Who cries into Harry’s shoulder, welcoming an embrace that he’d never known he’d needed.
His fingers traced the spines of several books, feeling the lettering as he desperately looked for an answer.
“How about you all just shut the fuck up?” Sirius moved to step forward, but Remus held a grip to his hand and gazed at him pleadingly.
After enough whining on Pansy’s part, the three were granted permission to leave the vicinity in favor of the garden outside.
They both let out a held breath, somewhat of a sigh that each body used to calm itself. Hearts were still racing, the moment enduring as Sirius smiled and shook his head.
And yet, he wanted to rebel. The constant tug of war that these opposing emotions brought was evident in his anger. He balled his fists before leaving the breakfast table and heading through the entrance of the Great Hall.
Peter grinned before James was elbowed in the gut.
Harry, confused and startled, hit next without thinking.
When Draco approached his unarmed opponent, the rest of the room was highly preoccupied. He rushed forward and came to an abrupt halt, Wand pointed inches from his father’s face.
He approached it rapidly, peering at an unchanged Dumbledore before throwing open the door to reveal white and gray wisps of magic emanating outward. They tangled like snakes through the air, reaching forward in a fashion similar to woodsmoke.
Draco felt a sense of admiration toward Harry’s father, and he was suddenly wishing that he had more in common with him than with the man across the room.
“Maybe. What can we do about that? Join him? Someone is bound to get hurt, mate.”
It was like a movie. It played before him, perhaps in his mind’s eye, and it was all that he could focus on. Like a beacon in the darkness; an outlet for the wiring in his brain.
“Pans, do you ever think that maybe you and me should be together?” Draco asked as their laughter quelled.
A nagging voice has always told him it was bound to end this way. Himself and Voldemort, eye to eye, surrounded by the depths of something dark.
Another moment of silence.
He hasn’t been sleeping properly either.
“I’m sorry things weren’t better between us sooner,” Harry admitted, his own tears running subtly down his face.
Rolling his eyes, he stalked past him and began heading toward the edge of town.
“You’re not real.” The wand lowers. His brow narrows.
His eyes were cold, mouth wound into a frown that accentuated every muscle taut against his sunken face.
They each wore a proud, longing expression, hoping that they’d made their fourth member happy. After a moment, he spoke.
Draco laughs softly. “Because, you idiot, it was always you. Always fucking you. And I fucked up; I ruined my chance to be good. But you… you are what good aspires to be. And I hate that about you, I always have.” He pauses, grinning and shaking his head at his own stupidity. “But it’s what makes you Saint Potter, and you deserve every piece of it.”
“Malfoy,” he puts his hands in his pockets, rocking back and forth a bit on his feet. “What sort of business are you up to these days?”
He wouldn’t ever mention that to anyone. Never.
Draco shot another curse from around the clear magical bubble that separated them from sure injury or death. But it was weakening, and Harry gritted his teeth with determination as Lucius Malfoy forced stronger curses in their direction.
“Please. No.” His response was hushed and desperate, a soft beg for their lips to meet. And then Sirius was even closer, and Remus could already taste him. He licked his lips, eyes flickering down to Sirius’s.
“Before your school year is concluded, I will have expected you to do a most honorable deed in my name. You will be the one to kill Albus Dumbledore.”
Anything would’ve been better than this.
The night sky blended into oranges and pinks as the sun rose over the horizon. He was on the ground, a familiar presence weighted against his chest.
Harry purses his lips, contemplating. He suddenly realizes that Malfoy’s staring at him. A jolt of electricity runs a prickly shock down his spine.
James and Lily held on the others, unaware of what was about to occur. Sirius was angry, Moreso than James had ever seen him. If he wasn’t careful, they really would all end up in Azkaban.
“So, Draco, Who are you going to the Yule Ball with?” A slender girl with dirty blonde hair crossed her legs as she made herself comfortable next to the Malfoy heir. Harry immediately recognized her as Daphne Greengrass, another Slytherin in their year.
It was Potions, his favorite subject, and the look of determination on his face meant that Draco refused to let his house mate ruin that.
A light seems to dissipate the shadows, which morph and expand into unidentifiable shapes before they slowly vanish. Draco’s hands are still clammy, but his mind is on overdrive.
“Bloody hell, are you still onto this Malfoy shit?”
“It’s not,” he snapped, and Lily froze to avoid being caught. She- along with Harry and Draco- we’re gaining on them.
Crestfallen, James joined the rest of the Marauders. Remus too had a book in his lap, thumbing through the pages absently.
Instead, Draco Malfoy stabbed at his dinner but did not eat. And Harry felt a pang of regret stab through the emptiness.
Draco’s mouth falls inexplicably, and he’s unable to make sense of anything that’s happened in the past ten minutes.
They spend the next few hours just like this. Laughing, and smiling, and being everything together.
“I love you, Harry. I love you, so, so much.”
At once, a rainbow of sparks were cast in their direction from each and every Death Eater in the room. Draco instinctively placed a hand on Harry’s back and led them into a duck while Harry performed his strongest “Protego” as of yet.
“Uhm, no, it’s just... it’s just...” Harry suddenly couldn’t spit out the words that were scrambled and fried within his mind. Those lips. Those eyes. The way he moved gracefully and effortlessly in a fashion that opposed his own blunt clumsiness. All at once, he knew. It wasn’t the music. It was Draco. It was everything about him.
Each kiss was just as reassuring as its predecessor, a constant chain of unspoken vows that life would never be the same. Draco smiled against their lips, and Harry felt a blush deepen across his cheeks.
When Malfoy finally responded, after what seemed like a hellish eternity, Harry’s stomach flipped.
Hell, if he hadn’t stopped, he’d have tumbled right into them.
With Sirius and the rest of the Marauders by his side, he was invincible.
Her eyes were wide as fire, and she froze momentarily at the sight of the large wolf before her. It was as if she was placing her own puzzle pieces together, matching certain thoughts and notions to the scene before her. Her fear turned rapidly into acceptance as she stepped forward.
Draco put forth his best smile before leaving himself.
The sound of his own footsteps slamming against the tiled floor echoed against the shriek of Malfoy’s disdain behind him.
When it cleared soon after, the insectile beings were nowhere to be found. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand before they shared an understanding look.
He nods again with a ruminating pause. “Okay.”
Harry’s heart raced. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d run so hard; even the Triwizard Tournament didn’t hold a candle to the determination that resonated throughout him now.
Draco nodded without hesitation. “Yeah, I-I’d like that.”
“Stupefy!” Harry yelled, rash and almost ravenous for revenge. Insulting himself was one thing, but Draco? He felt a beast rise within that could no longer be contained. He would not stand for this.
He’d hid his condition- his life, even, for years, from so many people. Everything was a secret that had to be held. But not here- here, he was raw, and open, and for some goddamn reason... Sirius didn’t look away. He didn’t run, or scream, or fight.
That wasn’t the worst part, though.
He wanted to show him what it was like to love someone, and to feel loved in return. None of the people in his life that were supposed to love him had shown it properly, with the exception of his friends. He needed him to know what that feeling was, and he needed to feel it for himself.
After a while, Harry and Draco followed the quartet up the stairs to the dormitory.
“Yes, father.” Solemn, eyes fixed to his own feet.
“Do you think that cursing your little friend is going to solve your problems?” He gawked. And then, settling into something more serious:  “He is nothing but a player in my game.”
Draco held forward. Voldemort laughed. Harry froze.
He tore open the finest of parchments, fingered the contents of the letter. In the an exquisite and formal cursive were the insincere words of his father.
Harry knew where the vial was, tucked safely away in a sock back in his trunk. Regardless of potion, the aching in his stomach pushed him to follow Draco out the door. He couldn’t hold back any longer.
“What the FUCK, Potter?” He whined, hand cupping the bruise that was already forming on his right mandible.
“As your Minister of Magic, it pleases me to inform you that a very special award has been voted upon and will be given this evening. This witch or wizard has made leaps and bounds in areas of research and discovery that have already, even early in their development, impacted the lives of many. Their cause has required the utmost dedication and commitment from them, and I have personally witnessed several late nights on their behalf. This person is nothing short of deserving a celebration tonight, and they have my utmost respect. Would the crowd please welcome to the stage Mr. Draco Malfoy.”
How wonderful and bright reality must have been for Remus Lupin in the brief period of time that he had regained Sirius Black in his life.
And then Black was gone, and the memory came to a close.
Even in this situation, where he clearly held the advantage, he was a prisoner of his father.
He ran right in front of Lily, diving before her in a gesture of protection greater than any shielding spell. At once, he was doubled over on the ground before her. Green vomit spewed from his mouth, poured onto the floor. Whatever he’d tried to hit her with, it was truly a nasty spell.
The focus of everyone was diverted by the sound of the door flying open.
“No, I’m sure. I’m in.” Harry couldn’t quite decipher his expression. It was as if he was stuck between his own desires and those of the man in prison.
He rubs a gentle caress along his forearm. Draco doesn’t dare move, or breathe for that matter.
“Pathetic, really,” Pansy agreed and nodded for him to continue.
Draco lowered his wand and turned back to the Dark Lord, unable to look Pettigrew in the eye. It was this gesture that assured Harry of his unadulterated innocence.
Was Draco somewhere in another memory? If he was, would this help him find out?
“ I know.” James nodded, and he and Peter exited to Gryffindor Tower.
“Draco, you just wait until I get out of here! You better hope I don’t see your face again!” The irate snap of the Elder Malfoy broke the tranquil mood of the gang as he passed by, levitated by Shacklebolt himself.
Most of his life, he’d felt this way. Out of control and restless, like his fate rested in the hands of those who wanted to play him like a pawn. Of those who consistently mistreated him and broke the promises that he deserved to have kept. If Remus Lupin could be good, bitten into darkness but refusing to into it, then so could Draco. If Sirius Black had been willing to rebel against those who had raised him to become his own person... then so could he. If Harry could consistently defy the Dark Lord in hopes of living in a world without him... then so could he.
He nods subtly.
With curfew minutes away, the landscape was vacant of students. All were in their common rooms, safely bunkered in for the night. All except two.
Suddenly, he could cast a patronus.
He knew that Potter wasn’t lying about the Dark Lord’s return, but he kept his mouth shut while the press beraded him. Even his own house mates turned their back on him; it was disgusting. Second rate friendships at best. Draco would’ve never... he couldn’t finish the thought.
Draco chewed his lips violently, biting back the screams that threatened to dislodge his throat. His fingernails bled as he dug them seamlessly into the concrete, each one bending and breaking beneath the pain. He grunted and groaned but refused cry. Harry couldn’t take it anymore.
He quickly composed himself, expression changing into something more manipulative.
Blonde eyebrows furrowed in momentary confusion before his face contorted into a grimace that held a trace of embarrassment. Harry couldn’t help himself; Malfoy being anything less than right and proper had him grinning.
When her eyes registered the scene before her, she ran past the spot where Draco and Harry were watching intently and went head on into the middle of the confrontation.
The nights where Harry fell asleep soundly, head nestled in the curve of Draco’s chest with a delicate snore were his absolute favorite.
“I will admit, it’s insane. But we have to do it.”
But then all too quickly Draco had straightened himself back into a statuesque Malfoy.
The picture before them is a family, a blonde, a brunette, and a tuft or blue hair between them. There are no spaces, no empty holes between their bodies, and the sky is a vibrant array of purples and oranges.
Draco starts as Potter’s very form seems to appear from thin air beside him.
“Are you sure about that? I’m quite attractive; are you sure you’re not in love with me?” That smirk, that Malfoy sneer that Harry had known since first year tugged snobbishly at his lips.
“Don’t tell me you’re scared, Malfoy.”
She cackled accordingly.
“Care to study with me?”
Harry quickly removed the basin from its post, not pausing long to wonder what in the fuck the implications would be of messing with an object crafted purely of memory.
Crabbe and Goyle’s mouths simultaneously dropped into the most shocked form of the letter “o.”
His face must’ve been dumbfounded, or perhaps just plain dumb, because Malfoy’s contorted into one of concern.
Harry glanced around, suddenly piecing thoughts together and linking each idea into a very long and complicated train... he pointed a finger forward, reminiscent.
The screams were deafening. Even an enemy’s cries sent goosepimples along his arms, raising each hair taut against his skin.
Harry absorbed this information, processing its intricacies as he studied the morphed form of Lucius Malfoy.
Sirius sighed, unable to deny Moony the honest truth.
“I see you’re point, Sirius. But I think it’s up to Remus how the situation is handled, don’t you?” James was now the voice of reason.
He shunned a giggling Peter who insisted upon “Fluffy” and shifted his focus to Remus, who he swore would come up with something better.
“PRONGS! PRONGSY! THAT’S HIS NAME!”
What he witnessed had to be some sort of miracle. Where Draco’s limp body had lay was nothing but an empty space, vacant and wandering before him. He strained to lift his head, desperate to find what the bastard behind him had done with Draco’s body.
Malfoy studies the potion, which has begun to emit spirals of steam.
“When isn’t he weird?”
Pansy laughed as her head of House exited. Draco noticed from the corner of his eye that Dumbledore was finishing up a conversation with one of the aurors.
“What happened, dear?” Pansy pressed as the carriage started rolling. Harry hopped on board and squeezed in next to the substanceless figure of Draco Malfoy.
The snake strikes, and a shower of flames lands around him. His leg, it’s on fire, it’s on fucking fire…
The handle was steps away. Draco reached a hand forward, ready to grasp the knob and throw open the door to their escape. A violent pull on his left shoulder caused him to jerk backward, and Harry spun abruptly to find the culprit.
“You didn’t have to do that, James. But... thank you.” Remus’s sincerity could melt steel.
A smile danced upon his lips, and it seemed to hold the thousands of words that remained unspoken between them. Harry didn’t even realize that the classroom had become empty around them.
Harry shook his head. “Nah, go ahead and keep it. I’ve got as much luck as I need.” He eyed Draco with a sideways glance, a soft blush tinting his cheeks.
He deserved someone like Ginny, whose level-headed continuity was an unending source. She wouldn’t yell like this, or throw bratty temper tantrums when she felt threatened. No, she’d take him by the hands, and pull him close...
Skylines morphed into the Gryffindor common room. Harry was hoisted into the air by his housemates, a celebratory gesture to the golden egg in his hand. This was the day he’d completed the first task of the triwizard tournament. What a gleeful memory, grin plastered across his face as his friends applauded his success.
The bearded man stepped forward, revealing a scowling Severus Snape entering beside him. Pushing through to commence the action were two figures that Draco immediately recognized.
“You seem so sure of that. What makes you have confidence in my ability to pick out a name? Or do anything for that matter?”
Stifling a laugh, he turned to his nemesis with a glint of humor in his eyes.
“Where did you even get the ingredients?!”
“I don’t have time for games right now!” He shouts, eyes darting around the room for his lost object while his wand remains steady. They then come to rest on his form, his bloody and pathetic lower half that trails lifelessly behind him.
He took one more glance, pressing his nose uncomfortably close to the dog’s face. Sirius snapped, but Regulus hopped back in the nick of time. He straightened up, a combination of disgust and ire crossing his face.
“Because when are his ideas not completely mental?” James smirked playfully.
“Elaborate? Please?” His smirk turned into a warm smile that did nothing to help the heat in Remus’s cheeks.
And with that, Lucius Malfoy disapparated.
He’d thought he was a hero. Some hero he was, succeeding on stolen pretenses while Malfoy worked so hard to fail.
In essence, his father requested that Draco speak with him via floo in the Slytherin common room fireplace at midnight. There was apparently an important message that needed to be relayed to him promptly. He also asked that Draco burn the letter upon completing it. The severity of keeping their  meet quiet was present though unwritten.
Harry’s face flashed through his mind. It wasn’t motionless, like he’d last seen it, but warm and full of veracity and... and happy. His cheeks were rosy, like he’d just finished blushing or being a sap. He was beautiful, and his presence changed everything.
“I’m fine, but I don’t think the same can be said for your brother’s face.” His answer was directed toward an approaching Sirius and Remus.
Pansy raised her brows with a smile. “Well, Blaisey, it seems we’ve won over the Gryffindors, have we?”
“Well, boys, you’d better be off to get some rest. It’s been a long and eventful evening.” He nodded before walking past them, trailing after Professor Snape.
“You look stunning.”
They nodded wordlessly as Lily gestured to Regulus, Bellatrix, and Snape. James crossed to Malfoy, who remained incarcerated until he cast a quick reinervate.
Draco face palmed; Harry chuckled lightly.
He paced up and down the aisles, searching for something. But what?
He prayed Malfoy didn’t notice.
Sirius didn’t respond, jaw hanging, hands balled into fists and shaking.
“Awful things happen to wizards who-“
“Perhaps. And I’ll have to find a way to sneak you into the dungeons.”
He was grinning. Draco was barely clinging to his own sanity, and yet he was smiling crudely.
And then, the unthinkable occurred:  Potter shivered. He shivered, and then he leaned against Draco, resting his head against his chest. His breath cought, frozen in his lungs at the sudden contact. It felt good, so fucking good, and Draco realized he’d never felt so whole before.
When they separate, Harry’s smiling. Draco can’t help but smirk playfully.
Harry ducked sideways, narrowly missing the TV remote that was hurled angrily toward his face.
James spit up the last of the vomit curse and hurriedly pointed his wand at Lucius. “Incarcerous!”
But in all of his Gryffindor courage, somewhere he fell short. Scratching the back of his head nervously, he hurriedly switched gears.
There were screams, terrible, horrifying screams. And then... nothing.
Malfoy focuses on chopping the rose thorn into fine segments while Harry leans nonchalantly on his hand.
“God, Why haven’t we been doing that this whole time?” Sirius sighed, and Remus laughed before touching their foreheads.
He needed Felix Felicis more than he did.
He seemed thoughtful, pondering on something that was clearly bothering him. Harry crossed closer for a better view.
And then... a face. He was sitting across the Great Hall, picking at his food as he scraped his plate mindlessly. His eyes were downward, but his focus was clearly elsewhere. His cheek rested in a bent palm that was suspended by an elbow propped impolitely on the table.
His expression softened as he turned to Remus.
And it almost saved him. But in the end, as he tugged Harry into an embrace, he vowed to save himself. To finish the job.
“Just be glad you’ve done the right thing, Pettigrew. Rest assured, I’ll keep this in mind.”
“Even if you can wake him up, he will falter against me.” He called after confidently, but Harry continued forward without quarrel. He reached Draco, desperately throwing himself onto his hands and knees and giving him a quick once over.
“Thanks for being a part of our family.”
“Speaking of the losers!” Bellatrix cackled, turning the group’s attention to the approaching Gryffindors.
“M-me, Peter? You’re talking to me?”
“When you dove in front of that killing curse, your act was immediately etched into your memories. As soon as I saw it happen, I knew what was to come. And I myself wanted to intervene.”
“Harry? How long do you think we’ve been in detention?” Draco asked as the world began to shift.
Draco smiled, exhaling a relaxed breath against the crook of Harry’s neck.
They stuck close, able to see the gang ahead some yards away by the faded light of their own charms. Harry’s heart was pounding with each step, fearful for what would happen to the Marauders.
Voldemort’s expression was sickeningly cruel; like he got off on this specifically. Watching his followers suffer for him in an egotistical competition against himself and his own power.
Harry followed him into the dungeons, through the entrance to the Slytherin common room. He was immediately greeted by Pansy and Blaise, who were joining some of their housemates on a walk to the Great Hall for breakfast.
He sunk deeper into Remus, releasing to him every piece of torn up teenager he had to give. And in return he felt Remus’s tongue lapping at his own.
“If you really want me to,” Draco smiles, “I’m sure that can be arranged.”
He smoothed down his tux, smiling at the sap behind him as he whirled around.
And suddenly, Remus was pulled into an embrace by the Marauders. It was an infinite moment; a memory that would hold for a lifetime. It was happiness and hope, and for the time being it appeared that Remus would never have to worry about his transformations again.
Harry’s tumbling, struggling to find hand-holds in the pile as things get heated. He’s almost to the diadem, and Draco is silently willing his thoughts to persuade his victory. He can hardly move, and in the midst of chaos he notices that his leg is tingling.
“Wow, um... thanks.” Harry mutters, unsure of how to respond. What was once a wintry world has morphed into the warmth of an England summer.
“Even better!” He turned back and flashed them a wide grin. “I’ll catch you guys later!”
“I don’t understand,” Harry said dumbly, turning to face her.
Harry froze at the sound of Severus Snape’s voice, almost inaudible if not for the clear, noiseless night.
“However, your determination and loyalty to protect your friend is what Godric Gryffindor himself would have stood for. You each put yourself in harm’s way at the cost of protecting Mr. Lupin and his secret. And, for that, I commend you all.”
But there was something missing, and he couldn’t quite put his finger on what that was.
His eyes shut. Harry’s did too. And in the next second Draco’s lips were pressed against his. The moment was short, but infinite in its own right.
Draco hurriedly glanced away at Granger’s notice.
“DETENTION. FUCK!” Harry sat up quickly, startling Malfoy as he attempted to figure out the time. As light as it was, it had to be...8:30? 9? Either way, they were late.
“Dare, of course, my Potter-loving friend.”
As they emerged from the whomping willow, frozen by Harry’s doing, a glimpse of McGonnagal and Dumbledore could he seen entering the castle ahead. Harry motioned for Malfoy to keep up, who reluctantly continued to follow.
It’s still better than facing Potter.
And yet, his life depended on it.
“Daddy! Daddy, look! I made a potion! It’s got magic, I swear!”
Next to him, Sirius Black was gazing into the distance. Thinking about anything but transfiguration, it seemed. Settling upon some idea, he turned to Remus with a soft smile and nudged his arm. The boy jumped slightly but relaxed when he realized that it was just Sirius, who was now excitedly scratching a note with his quill.
“The abomination.”
“Actually, it was about your friend, Black.” Lucius stepped forward, a sly smile tugging his lips awry.
“Look at him, Rem,” Sirius was positively glowing. “He’s like a little James Junior!”
He could kill his father. He was strong enough. He was angry enough. He had every intention of putting him in the place he’d been held at himself for too many years.
“I trust you, Rem. Whatever you think is right, I’ll stand by you.”
The group broke into a guffaw, and as things settled between them, the last of the Death Eaters were removed from the Room.
Instantly, Pettigrew hit the floor, writhing in despair. Draco held his wand study, eyes fixed on his target. He didn’t dare flinch, or think about what was happening. Harry could tell he was desperately trying to forget what was happening by the second.
A whisper. He swore he heard a whisper subtly reach to him from behind the maniacal howl of his own personal Devil.
“Fuck you.”
Madam Pomfrey appeared from her office, much younger but no less the same flitting woman who cared infinitely for her patients. She began to dab Remus’s wounds with healing salve, muttering to herself about “broken bones” and “this one will take some recovery.”
“Family?” The word nervously slips his lips. He’s never done this before.
Black and Pettigrew held their breath as the transformation completed, revealing in James’s place a broad stag.
He was bawling, and angry, and desperate in the pictures, but Harry had seen all of these emotions from Draco before. He stood there, wide eyed, staring blankly as the wind continued to twist around them. Harry could only watch as he re-lived his most repressed memories, shaking profusely as the images became more grotesque.
“Fuck the Malfoy family! They’re as bad as the Blacks!” Sirius’s voice was rising, blood pumping loudly through his veins. Remus could hear it whooshing through his chest violently as he continued to rest against it. And then, he gazed downward at the boy who could very well have been sleeping against his body, and he visibly melted.
“There He is!” It was a hoarse whisper (if one could call it that) shoved in the direction of his own friends.
The air only thickened when he hastily shed Remus of his shirt, tossing it carelessly toward the ground in front of Harry. He jumped, jittery with awkwardness and anticipation. Draco (the hypocrite) began laughing heartily at his misfortune, but it was obvious that it was his own giddy attempt at settling the mood.
Harry couldn’t contain himself. “Ah, just... us.” He smiled warmly as their eyes met, Draco’s steel irises beginning to glow at the prospect of such a word.
An eternity stretched. No one fired a curse. No one twitched. And then...a loud clunk against the closed door of the cabinet.
Remus turned to face him, and their eyes met. Still smiling, Sirius settled into something more resolute.
“I can’t believe it. They forgave him.” Draco observed, and Harry shrugged.
“Oh my god, Remus, I have to go.” He stood without explanation, and James groaned.
Sirius raised his brows, not used to receiving such compliments from the redhead. Especially ones of character.
But neither of them moved a muscle. Instead, they locked stares that seemed to migrate across each other, hungrily searching for something that went unspoken.
His mind was empty as his body surfed the waves of peacefulness, a prickly but soothing feeling washing over his skin.
Harry finished the letter, glancing immediately to Malfoy’s face for any sign of what he was thinking.
Harry gulps, then decides that life is far too short to miss chances. Especially during the season of Christmas.
The Savior of the Wizarding World is dreaming about him. Believes in him. Maybe, even...loves him?
“That’s not how this works! You cannot take him! He can’t leave his own mind!”
“Maybe I need your help, you blonde prat.”
Remus turned his gaze toward his feet, which were splayed straight in front of him. He shuffled them restlessly before shrugging.
Why had he called him Draco? And why had it felt so right? So pure? Like he should’ve been doing it his entire life?
And then, in a fit of passion and rage, Sirius Black turned his wand on his brother.
Another nod. And then a loud crack that signaled the appearance of the expected. Unscathed and back in his finest wizard robes stood Lucius Malfoy, standing tall in defiance of his latest sentencing.
Sirius gasped at Peter’s retort, and the charm that radiated from his excitement did nothing to quell the pink of Remus’s cheeks.
And, then, the moment Harry had feared somewhere deep inside of him was occurring. As the burst of green light resonated from Malfoy’s Wand, Draco made no move to avoid it. He simply stood there, resolute, in an act of rebellion against everything he’d ever been taught by the man before him.
A fucking doe. Not a snake, or a dragon, or the sharp fins of a great white. A small deer.
Now, that fuel had been ignited by dark magic and curses that set the turrets on fire. Creatures ran rampant, killing those in their wake. Some of the braver students had stuck around and threw counter-spells from behind posts and make-shift debris walls. In the midst of it all, Draco limps.
“No. You know I don’t feel that way, Sirius.”
Next was James, whose competitive spirit fueled him farther. His body, too, began to change, lengthening at the joints. His wrists buckled uncomfortably beneath him as he fell to all fours. The boys watched intently as mahogany hair began to spout across his skin, spreading across his entire body and face. His nose stretched, and something alarming began to grow from the top of his skull.
Harry wondered how close he was to finding Draco in the array of memories he’d sifted through thus far. The smell of candy and chocolate frogs alerted him to the familiarity of the Hogwarts Express, and he glanced around to find himself amidst the boarded train.
He watched the disappointment cross Malfoy’s face when it was announced that Harry had won.
Before he could ask, the world began to shift again.
Because all at once, everyone’s attention diverted to the two boys on either side of the iPod that was now absolutely blaring the first few lines to Shake It Off by Taylor Swift.
Black was yelping.
“Everything’s so complicated. But we just work. Shouldn’t that mean we’re meant to be?”
Harry refused to lose sight of him in this state and stalked in his direction, praying that the memory would continue. He lacked the knowledge of how to fix him but knew that he needed support. Would he find it in his friends?
It was full.
He gets a bit panicky when requests are made, unable to say no. Draco Malfoy never thought he’d become a push over, but his inherent desire to please, to win, to have a second chance is tumultuous.
This was what he deserved.
“Where is he?”
“SEE, DEAN!? YOU DONT GET TO CUT ME OFF WHEN IM RIGHT!?!?!?”
Harry could almost feel the wind whipping against his face. The freedom permeating the air, the openness of the expanding horizon.
He did nothing to fight it, bringing his own hands to Remus’s temporal bones and holding him close. He weaved his fingers through locks of golden brown hair, gripping as if the moment was going to slip away indefinitely.
“It was nothing.”
Draco Malfoy limps. He fucking drags his leg behind him, pushing forward and sacrificing every ounce of repituity while doing so.
Lily Evans climbed Out of the trap door and into the middle of total chaos.
He caught himself pleading to a silent Draco from a few weeks back, oblivious to Potter entirely.
A skeptical expression crossed his face that prompted Sirius to continue.
He wished he didn’t have to watch him leave.
Sorry? For being an arsehole? Who the hell was this “Draco” and what had he done with Malfoy?
“We can’t all walk in and ace the tests without studying, Black.” Peter chimed with a jealous glint in his eye, and Sirius chuckled.
Harry had never seen his Godfather so blatantly lighthearted, and it was refreshing.
After the cat calls and the clapping (largely from the area of Hermione and Pansy) subdued, they separated and shared soft smiles that meant the world.
Those eyes are peering at him again.
“Now, now, Bella. We’re not here to provoke the poor Gryffindors. We just have some business to attend to regarding the traitor.” His voice was thick as ice, and it sent an involuntary shiver down Harry’s spine. It reminded him all too much of the Department of Mysteries the year before.
The path ahead stretched timelessly, rows upon rows of the same orbs lining each side as far as he could see. It was enough to make him dizzy, and he tried to force his eyes to adjust to the monotony when something eerie interrupted it.
Harry started at his sudden observation, but Malfoy remained calm.
The breeze tickles his cheeks, and there’s a slight freedom that comes from that.
Peter’s nose scrunched. “Aw, really? Why can’t it be something like ‘Proud Pete’ or ‘Radical rat?’”
Draco laughed at his obliviousness. “Come on, we’ve got to follow them.”
Desire overcame all else as he tilted his head into the kiss, allowing Sirius’s lips to part between his own. His mouth was open, and warm, and heavy- and suddenly Remus was grasping Sirius’s robes and pulling him closer.
“It’s a-“ Harry turns suddenly, whipping toward the direction of Draco’s gesture. Sure enough, there, propped against a dusty old mannequin atop a mound of antiquities, was exactly what he’d been looking for.
“You loved it, and you know it!” Sirius called, packing James in and hurriedly rushing off for round two.
“Are you sure this is where they keep him?”
“All of you! Get the fuck out of here! Do you hear me? I’m done being afraid. You don’t scare me anymore!”
Even writing “I must not tell lies” was a hint more embracing than the situation Harry Potter found himself in currently. Well... almost.
He shrugged again, and a wide smile lit up Potter’s face. “I told you we were friends.”
Peter remained behind, pressing himself against the brick wall of the alleyway in a fit of anxious fear.
“Well, Pettigrew, you’ve come to the right place.”
Draco cocked his head wordlessly, tears surfacing at that thought. He was no better than his father. No better than the scum of the earth.
Pansy bore her own wicked grin, a satisfied contribution to a stunning surprise.
The whole scene was rather odd, and Harry wondered just what was running through Draco’s mind.
“Apparently they tried to bestow some kind of idea that he’d have an arranged marriage, and Sirius flipped shit and told them to fuck off. That’s when they threw him out.”
“It was a team effort. I owe much appreciation to young Mr. Malfoy here for confronting their leader.”
As they followed the Slytherins, who were just disappearing beyond the inside of the Willow, it became apparent that Lily Evans had no intention of finishing her prefect rounds that night.
Draco Malfoy, however slightly, was bothered by Harry and Ginny’s kiss. He just wasn’t fully aware of why that was.
He hardly waited for a response, but a series of nods accompanied his question. “Good. Now this will not happen again. Life will continue as if it did not occur. Consider yourselves redeemed under the preface of a second chance. And it is imperative that you use it wisely. You you may go now.”
Suddenly, Harry was faint. His vision clouded as it faded into pieces of darkness, a Smokey black haze stealing his view. He was woozy, he couldn’t think, couldn’t feel...
He heard it. A soft word, stark against his surroundings.
Blaise leaned inward and was whispering something to Pansy. She nodded and slowly began inching her way to the boy on the ground, just enough to remain unnoticed.
“No, you twat. My father.”
“I want to see where this goes, Draco. I don’t care what it takes. I... I want you.”
“What the fuck? Get back here, Black! You don’t get to treat my brother that way!”
Something about it, and Harry couldn’t quite tell what it was, caused his stomach to twist in knots. What an arrogant prat, a goddamn privileged brat, a fucking rude arse...
“Are you- what the- what did you guys do!?” Sirius continued to wag his newest appendage, ears tucked back and chest shaking back and forth with excitement.
At once, Theo flew backward against the surface of the cabinet, hitting his head and losing consciousness on the way down. He almost expected sparks to fly, curses firing in every direction with a chaos that only he could be blamed for beginning.
His hands are tingling; he’s nauseous; the room is spinning. And absolutely no part of that has to do with the injury to his leg.
Malfoy paused, cocking his head with an evil smirk. “Nicely done, Peter. I knew you had your priorities in line.”
Sixth year was no better.
Fifth year Harry Potter was anywhere but invested in the subject before him. Perhaps it was because Umbridge had gotten beneath his skin that day. Or maybe it was because he was Snape’s least favorite student.
Behind him, he heard an angry voice call out.
“Hello?” He asked dumbly as the figure drew closer. He could feel their presence radiating toward him, being drawn as if by gravity. Since when did drunk Harry become such a goddamn poet? And then the body was beside him, sitting with its back against the wall, and Harry could feel his cheeks heating at the sudden closeness. Similar to the way Malfoy’s had.
“He won’t hurt him.” Was all James stated. The rest was obvious to anyone.
Harry tilts his head, brow creased with confusion as he overhears the factual proclamations of Hermione: “I used to smell freshly cut grass, Ronald, but now I seem to only sense a very potent version of you.”
And Draco would laugh, and then call Harry a prat or something before confessing all of his own pent up feelings. Things would be great, things would be wonderful, things would be-
He turned into an oversized puppy. For Remus. And suddenly, he lost the ability to hold anything back. His eyes flickered to the ground one last time before he leaned a bit closer, slimming the gap between them carefully.
When Potter was sorted into Gryffindor, something in Draco’s heart sunk. He’d almost been sorted with him. Why did it bother him that they were now constituted rivals? He swallowed his thoughts and focused on upholding the family name.
From behind him, Regulus was studying the big black dog suspiciously. There was something eerily familiar about its stance. As if he’d known the dog his entire life and not met it only a few moments ago.
"Here's the floo-powder."
Harry froze. He searched for Draco’s eyes. The expression on his face seemed genuine. Was he actually showing emotion? Did he really just
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
Except from lessons, Malfoy was never found near the other Ravenclaws.
Harry turned his head to see the front counter of the library empty. Madam Pince was gone.
"Wanna go down to the lake with us after Astronomy? Fred and George have Quidditch practice at five so we could go to the pitch and watch them afterwards."
His head hurt a bit, probably it was the leftover dizzyness after sleeping for a long time.
Something very, very bad must have happened...
"Malfoy! MALFOY!"
Wait a minute!
“Sorry. I won’t mention it again.”
Some people started complaining and Harry was pretty sure Malfoy was one of them but the captain wouldn't have any of it.
"You may go. But you will never mention this around
And he was just too aware of the angry and confused glares from the Slytherin table and from his childhood friends who weren't sorted yet.
"Good morning, Draco! How was your weekend."
Then he took a look Uncle Vernon's old watch on his bedside table.
“Pansy, I really don’t think-“
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
But Harry, without paying any attention to the curious and expecting glances from the others, went over to his trunk, grabbed his pajamas and disappeared inside the bathroom.
Somebody would've made sure of that, right?
Draco had spent his evening with Crabbe and Goyle in the Slytherin common room. Maybe they were a bit stupid (
) looked rather sad but told them what they had to be careful about and stuff on their way towards the trees anyway.
Meanwhile Harry had no idea how to react.
"Snape is trying to steal it!"
They both groaned as they turned around. It was Colin Creevey. Of course it was. The little wanna-be photographer had been following him around all week, constantly asking for pictures and autographs and while that had been kinda cute in the beginning it was starting to become really annoying.
"Harry Potter?"
"I want you to return once a day to check if anything changed."
"Harry!
The twins played exasperated looks.
Fast forward, fifteen minutes later Draco Malfoy came back down, his right fist clasped around the snitch and triumphantly raised into the air. His smirk was wider than ever. Cho was wearing an angry frown when she joined Harry in the bunch of wanna-be chasers.
He ignored the voice. He had exchanged a few more letters with his mother since Christmas and she didn't once mention something like that. It would be okay.
Ron said.
She was pretty good at Potions, Draco had to admit that, but she was way too nosy. The last time she'd asked him why he was
"I never did anything in Snape's classes that would justify him to take so many points from me, and you know that! Anyway, I wasn't punished for... taking the longer way."
In the meantime Harry had gotten himself his quill, ink and a roll of parchment and was getting comfortable on his bed. For a short time it was quiet and he heard the other boys whispering about something. Then, surprisingly, Terry Boot spoke up.
All this time there had been a voice nagging him in the back of his head and somehow he had managed to ignore it while reading. But having nothing to distract himself with, fatigue made his walls break down for a second and that was when the voice screamed at him:
“Come on now, Potter. No need to be scared. I don’t bite. At least not people like you.”
anymore!"
but it means something to
Suddenly all the gazes were on Harry again.
He looked so different without the glasses. But somehow that made the moment feel even more intimate. Immediately Draco was hit by a wave of guilt. How did he deserve anything as precious as this after all that he had done?
"Mister Potter insisted that he would go to Hogwarts either way but then I made his family angry and they locked him in his room and said that he would never have any contact to wizards ever again."
Strange. If anyone would have seen this door before, there would've clearly been rumours about it. How come he hadn't heard about it? And it also had never been mentioned in
“Shut up, number two. You’re not the hero dad made you believe you are. The scars you collect won’t change anything about that.”
. He had an idea. It was an absolute waste of good quality, but it would work for now. He could still re-sell the brooms later but for now the aim was to put them somewhere where no one, especially not Graves, would find them.
"You call me Dragon, I call you mother."
"We're trying to create a spell that makes you have crush on somebody. We've just had a breakthrough, we only have to try it on someone."
Kind of.
Draco spent Saturday evening and most of Sunday with Pansy, Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle talking about their holidays (Draco didn't utter a word about his own) and insulting some Gryffindorks. Before returning to the Ravenclaw tower on Sunday evening he went to
He wanted to have some silence. Something very rare at the Dursleys, if not impossible.
"He's kinda right, you know.
A woman's voice interrupted the rage but it didn't last for more than a second and the cold, emotionless voice carried on.
It was hard to convince himself that the voice in his head was not one of sympathy and after a few more minutes he gave up and just decided to put his brain on off-mode again. When he came back it was because Loony was scrambling off her seat next to him.
At dinner Draco avoided looking over to the Gryffindor table with all might and concentrated hard on the conversation he was having with his friends, determined to not let his thoughts drift off.
“Hi, Molly. Can I help you with something?”
The captain appeared on the pitch, levitating a large chest and a bunch of school brooms. Lockhart kept talking bullshit.
Half an hour later he said his goodbyes to the Slytherins and started up the staircase that led to the west tower. He came to a halt in front of another one, at the top of which sat a little blond girl. Loony. Draco couldn't resist the urge to roll his eyes.
They finished their breakfast talking about teachers and subjects.
With a smile on his lips Harry entered and found everything in its place. His luggage was sitting next to his old bed. Hedwig's cage was empty. No wonder. She had been even more pissed off after their crash with the tree. Harry made a mental note to make it up to her the next day, right after he'd visited Hagrid. With a yawn he pulled his pajamas from his case and went to the bathroom to get ready for the night. Ten minutes later he finally sat down on his four poster when Draco stood in the doorway of their dorm. The following conversation was way too short and too similar to exchanges they'd had in the past that Harry didn't even bother interpreting Draco's mood swings. Right then he was way too tired for this bullshit.
Seeing the concerned expression on his students' faces he added,
“I know how the machine works. If I wanted anything, I would get it myself.” The posh boy went back to reading.  “Besides, I’m not going to sully my body with filthy soft-drinks.”
"Hey, Mione! Good to see you! How was your summer?"
"Hey, you're Harry Potter, aren't you?"
Amazed, he let his eyes glide over the stuffed bookshelves covering the walls and over a statue of Rowena Ravenclaw, who he'd recognised from an illustration in
Harry didn't get a chance to continue this thought because as soon as he reached the Ravenclaw table he was besieged by about a dozen boys and girls of different age shaking his hands. All of whom were cheering and clapping.
"Happy Christmas, Potter."
their godfather in a school corridor.
Harry nodded while chewing down his bacon. The boy passed him a sheet of paper.
"Ron! Do something!"
“Oh. Well, you have good chances, though. You were one of the fastest, right?”
“Oh, Hermione dear! It’s so good to see you!” Molly made her way across the small kitchen and gave the girl a warm hug. “You could prepare a salad if you want to. And tell Ronald to bring in some drinks from the garage.”
“That was a no, Potter.”
“Um, Harry? Can-can we continue the practice - together?”
"Just forget 'bout it. This is only between Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel... I should not have said that. I didn't say that! See y'all at dinner."
And the two young Ravenclaws went to bed.
He left the two small packages from the top, which had a far more expensive and nicer looking wrapping, for the end.
"Hmmm....very brave....also ambitious....one could find a true friend in you....and you are very eager to learn....very intelligent, in plenty ways....but where to put you? You would fit into all of them. Maybe not Hufflepuff. And it probably wouldn't be wise to put you into Slytherin. Too much pride and prejudice. No, you're full of love. But will it be Ravenclaw or Gryffindor?"
“Please tell me there’s at least a little action involved.”
. Could you believe that?!
managed to get into trouble he would be the very first one to be attacked. He couldn't let that happen.
. Finally I have you back."
Ten minutes later, the last two members of the family arrived as well. Molly’s heart melted when Draco leaned down to hug her without her asking for it. She could feel how the poor, sweet boy finally became comfortable around her and this house in general.
“That's not a nice thing to say. You should be nicer to people!”
Ron went on explaining like it was the clearest thing to be.
“That’s fair I guess.”
"This is 15 pounds then."
"She's got a point there, Harry..."
He had just finished that thought when Malfoy suddenly swerved left. Harry was confused at first but two seconds later followed sue hastily. Apparently, in the heat of the competition, he had forgotten to count the rest of his laps. In the center of the pitch he finally set down. He looked at Malfoy, expecting him to use that opportunity to mock him but the other boy wasn't even acknowledging him. Instead he angrily glared at the only player who had already been waiting there. It was a relatively short but clearly muscular guy who was currently putting his long, ruffled, wavy black hair back into a bun, revealing an undercut. He was good looking. A strong jawline, a small nose and  dark eyes which were covered by eyelids that Harry was pretty sure were typical for people with Japanese ancestry.
Harry smiled sadly at their merry faces. It was nice having something from their past but it also hurt a lot.
He threw himself against it, just to let this anger out.
“What?”
So, while he told himself that he was glaring at his childhood rival he was actually more drinking in the way the dress was falling around Draco’s form silkily all the way down to his ankles, bringing out his best angles and exposing his right shoulder. In the same silver as the dress, he was wearing elegant high heels.
Who did Potter think he was to eavesdrop to this conversation (If you could call a Howler a conversation...).
resonated Mr Malfoys cold voice in his head. And somehow forgetting how Malfoy had treated him in the past few months he wanted to comfort him. To tell him it was going to be alright.
“Fred, George, Percy! You three go first!”
But Harry?
He kept staring at her, mouth agape. But Loony didn't seem to mind all that much. Not having received any reply, she just went back to watching all the people at the different house tables, swinging her legs happily. When Draco realized he'd been staring for more than a minute, he shook his head and opted for paying attention to the ceremony instead. It was almost over and soon the last girl was to be called up.
And with his head raised he made his way to the Ravenclaw table.
Ron blurted out,
Hesitantly he took it and let it fall back against the door again. It didn't even cause a sound. The door just opened a crack.
The Headboy continued his way across the hall and the boys scanned their timetables.
The walk up the stairs was silent. They’d made careful not to be caught (as if they weren’t in enough trouble already) and now that they’d arrived it seemed like another reality entirely. Like they’d entered another memory.
“You’re amazing, Rem. Absolutely amazing.”
Surprisingly, there’s no criticism, only the accidental brush of Malfoy’s hand against his as he begins to stir counter-clockwise. His skin tingles in its wake.
And Harry feels his lips tugging upward, a match to Malfoy’s smile. How ironic; only in death would Harry had ever guessed they’d share a moment like this.
“Awh! But that’s cool! Damnit!” Peter cursed himself for giving Black the idea, and eventually the other tables went back to their normal conversation.
He reached out a hand. “Harry, come on, we’ve got to get the fuck out of here.”
“So, what do we do now?” Harry looks around, trying to make sense of everything. Wondering if this was his new reality, and realizing that he wouldn’t mind so much if it was.
“Should we get out of here?” Harry suggested, and with a wordless nod in affirmation they turned and started for the door.
Sirius yelped and collapsed as Snape threw a nasty hex in the direction of his front leg.
He couldn’t take it anymore. Was he dying? Or was re-living his worst memories going to kill him first?
And that wasn’t Harry’s fault, but it also wasn’t something Draco could change. It was a never ending cycle, and, just as the rain fell from the sky, he would battle his own self destruction.
Harry felt a blush creep up his cheeks but remained persistent.
His own revelation slammed into him as if every book shelf had toppled upon him. He pressed forward as Draco continued to head toward the exit.
“I wouldn’t be here without you, Harry. I love you more than words can entail. You are my past, my present, and my future. And I cannot wait to spend the rest of our lives making memories together.”
He positively melted when Harry’s hands tugged him closer, lining their bodies against one another in a perfect, heated match. He gasped softly against his lips, suddenly very aware of how close they were and unable to control the very real urges that began to rise like fire within.
This time Slughorn stood at the forefront, tapping a bottle of amber liquid with pride. Harry remembered this day vividly.
As Black walked away, James rolled his eyes, and Lupin’s brow furrowed.
Harry immediately recognized her. Pansy Parkinson.
“Where’s Black?” Bellatrix placed both hands on her hips, clearly annoyed that they’d missed him.
There was a spiteful chuckle from the Elder Malfoy as each pair of red eyes landed on them. Harry, frozen with fear and a sudden feeling of dread, remained on the ground with his hands forward. Draco began to back up slowly, his eyes wide with fear and anticipation.
His skin was darkening, losing any and all pigment as it wasted away. And, all at once, Draco knew that he couldn’t leave the dying man here. Not like this. Not if he wanted to be free.
A jerking sensation. A heavy thump of something falling next to him, vibrating the cool ground beneath. Who else could possibly be interrupting his time here? Could it be...?
The pain intensifies. He’s going to pass out soon, he’s sure. His flesh is screaming, but all he can vocalize is a string of choked coughs. His throat is raw, but it’s nothing, nothing compared to the bite of that fucking snake…
Draco’s lips relaxed into a more serious line. “Die? For me?” The words were a whisper, disbelief and shock permeating the air.
Once they were out of ear shot of any stragglers, Blaise removed their prize and wiggled his eyebrows. Pansy lept up and down excitedly; Draco nervously shuffled his feet.
Having Teddy Lupin run through his life is like chasing a tiny piece of dynamite. You never know just when it will explode, and when you’ve got it in your fingers it seems to roll invariably to the floor. Draco’s been waiting now for quite some time for his own destruction, but his regularly timed meetings with Harry (wow- really on a first name basis now) and his cousin had brightened his steps countably.
“Theodore, you can come out now.” From behind the cabinet stepped the fellow Slytherin, wand by his side as he came to the forefront.
Detention with Filch was looking like heaven at this point; polishing the trophy room by hand was much more appealing.
“I have a few memories that you will be sorting through today. It’s quite simple, really. Together, you will enter the pensieve and categorize each one by content. Memories with similar themes will be collected in like vials at the end of the of your detention. You will find that this task is much more easily accomplished by working together.”
“There, look, it’s a trap door. We’ve found it!” Malfoy exclaimed excitedly, making his move to enter the shack. Bellatrix cackled exuberantly, Regulus and Snape held their wands forward. Prepared.
It started out as a subtle cough on the day that he spoke the words “I love you.”
The next few moments were spent stupidly captivated by the bloke against him, wondering if he’d died and gone to heaven. A heaven that would’ve been hell just a few days ago.
His own eyes fluttered shut, and he felt his face, by some gravitational pull that existed between them, come forward. There was barely any space left between them. The air that did exist in the middle of their lips was hot and heavy and full of desire.
Harry caught himself chuckling relaxedly. So much friendship existed between the companions, that much was evident just in the way they talked.
And why was there a small, evil voice in the back of his mind that hoped it would be Malfoy?
It was cold and damp and dark, even more so than usual. It must’ve been the middle of the night.
The boy nodded as he unwrapped his arms from his mother. It was clear that their relationship was much more familial than that of his father’s. Harry was suddenly very grateful for Narcissa’s presence in his life, blinded as she may be by her husband’s beliefs.
“No, please, my Lord, no!” His cries were a pathetic and desperate whine, and for a split second Harry felt he’d gotten what he deserved.
Harry wasn’t sure what had caused him to become so defensive, but his voice dripped involuntarily with poison. Perhaps it was because Malfoy was being so nice, so incomprehensibly caring and kind. Maybe it was because on top of that, Harry had just spent the last five minutes pondering what it would be like to snog him.
“To Draco.”
“Aunt Bella.” Draco’s voice was soft and humble, almost contemplative. His eyes were glued before them.
“Do you think the rest of his little gang will be there? We might want to take precaution-“
The door slammed open. A crowd of eighth years walked in, jabbering as always. Hermione was in the forefront with her newest friend Pansy in tow and a very amused Blaise Zabini. Behind them, Draco Malfoy entered with an almost grateful expression.
“Sirius...”
“Then why did you let Dad beat the shit out of me, Reg? Why didn’t you stand up for me?”
“I’m working on it.”
When he looked up, Sirius was much closer. He placed a hand on each shoulder in a comforting reassurance.
To Remus.
And it was so beautifully un-Malfoy that Harry felt a mixture of admiration and confusion but before he could ponder it... the world was changing.
“No, father. That is the last thing I want. I am going to prove it to you and our Lord. I am working on something, the details of which are discreet. Even speaking them aloud is risky. You must trust me.”
“Fancy a movie?” Harry asks, and something soft flutters in Draco’s chest.
“I dare you to moon Mrs. Norris.”
The summer between fifth year and sixth. Sitting alone at the Dursleys. Hating himself for how he felt. Wishing he could be anywhere but where he was.
“Happy Christmas.”
Harry readied himself to pace back and forth, contemplating with complete focus on finding the Death Eaters. But as soon as they approached their goal, a large set of wooden doors seemed to appear from thin air. Draco eyed them suspiciously, and Harry couldn’t help but join him.
Somehow, as the wolf sniffed out his new companion, it appeared that things were going to be okay. It tilted its head upward, satisfied, before moving onto the stag that held motionless behind him.
It was dark again, and for a moment Harry pondered the possibility of their setting as the dungeons at Hogwarts. The ungodly silhouette of something inhuman, almost serpentlike against the dim lighting had him discarding that theory with an involuntary shudder.
“I don’t have time for half-arses.” He pivoted on one foot haughtily, making to leave.
“Me, too, mate. He sounds pretty torn up about what happened.” James wiped the blackberries from his face before Sirius exploded.
“Harry, I don’t understand.” Hermione pressed, hungry for answers. “What happened?”
“All ears, my friend,” Draco added. It was evident that they’d all been dragged to these social events one too many times.
“Out of those two, you are totally Sirius.” Draco pointed out, unlacing their fingers to pivot and eye him humorously.
His eyes instantly fell downward before they fluttered shut, squeezed tight in concentration. He was holding back some emotion, anger, or sadness, Harry couldn’t be sure. And then, with his right hand he crumpled the note and hid it hastily in his robe pocket. His hands were still visibly shaking; his was skin a few shades pale than his normal hue. He appeared as if he might vomit, and Harry wasn’t quite sure he wouldn’t have felt the same if the roles were reversed.
When the sorting hat touched his head, a thousand thoughts were buzzing through Draco’s mind. His father wanted him to carry on the family tradition of being a true Slytherin. The house of blood supremacy. The house of power. He’d never really understood why, but he knew that his father must be right. His father was his hero, when had he ever been wrong?
“Well, duh! I was going for something less obvious.”
His biggest enemy had faith in his ability to win this war.
It was just the humor, that was all. Seeing Malfoy hold him in a weakened state, it was satisfying. It seemed to feed a part of him that he didn’t know existed until now.
Harry heard the chuckle, low and steady, come from beside him. Malfoy was getting a kick out of the Marauders, just like he was.
“Potter,” he breathed heavily, “I swear to Merlin, when we get out of detention...”
Harry had seen Draco angry, irate even. He’d witnessed a dramatic smirk dance upon his lips while he bullied a lesser witch or wizard. He’d even seen him appear indifferent, bored and apathetic with those surrounding him.
The next moment was both scary and eerily exciting. At once, the boys’ bodies began to change, morphing and breaking into their animagi.
And suddenly Harry’s heart clenched with sympathy. Voldemort had attempted to kill him several times by now, but he’d never been in such as position as Draco was in currently.
With a sigh, Peter shrugged. “If it will help Remus, then of course I’m in.”
Draco took a deep inspiration as every last thing seemed to come to a head. There he was, the world at his fingertips. Revenge, dancing before him like the prize he’d finally been privileged to. A chance at redemption. At freedom.
Sirius was having none of it.
“Ew, gross,” She commented sympathetically, but Goyle spoke up.
Draco glanced around, suddenly feeling the presence of everyone’s gaze boaring into him.
Draco’s head lolled a bit as he tried to pick up his pace, the footsteps behind him booming louder with closeness.
There were women in ball gowns, men in suits and proper wizard robes. At a table in the forefront sat the familiar figures of Pansy and Hermione.
“Jeez, it feels like years. I’m sure it’s got to be getting late, right? Or maybe it’s just the way time flows here.”
Harry followed urgently. But when he broke through the seal of the door, expecting to see the corridor of the first floor, chest heaving with emotion and an irate notion that he’d lost the boy, he quickly realized that he wasn’t in Hogwarts anymore.
“I know.”
The lights were dimmed, but Harry could make out what appeared to be a bedroom. A very elegant round bed protruded from the wall before him, and this was accompanied by furniture of the finest taste.
“Sirius.”
In the next moment, Sirius had reached across the table to take Remus’s hands into his own.
Suddenly, a louder voice pierced the night.
“I can second that,” Zabini stepped forward, arms crossed as he stood comfortably next to Ron. “It’s been a rough year, Draco. Wouldn’t you agree?”
Before him was the boy, tugging on the robes of an adult.
“Hello, father.”
“You know, Mr. and Mrs. Potter sent James an article in the Prophet at breakfast. It spoke of the development of a new potion called Wolfsbane. It’s still under testing, but the idea is that it would be able to help- Maybe even prevent- your transformations.”
“It’s nothing.” He said nervously, and Harry could almost feel the simper on Malfoy’s face beside him.
“I am admitting to a reluctance from your insanity.” He responded curtly, never lowering his wand.
“Fuck,” was Draco’s thought on the matter, and although he was puzzled beyond comprehension he didn’t dare move. Because Harry felt so right- oh my god- Harry...
And, with a wink of his eye, Albus Dumbledore was already halfway down the steps toward the exit.
“Enough,” Draco answered urgently before pressing his lips forcefully upon his own.
Surprisingly, Harry smiled. It felt good, being... associated with Draco. Sensing his emotion, Draco laughed in response.
Rumors began flying that Potter had somehow tricked the Goblet into allowing him to enter. Draco knew it was a lie. He may have disliked Potter but he knew him better than that. The boy would’ve never blatantly gone against Dumbledore’s orders.
Draco was right. They’d have to see how this unfolded all on its own.
Harry seized the opportune moment to trek the last few steps toward the exit. He gripped the handle and threw the door open, but it was no library on the other side. Where an entrance to a memory had once stood was now replaced by the most blinding of lights, protruding with a yellow glow through the open doorway.
“Lucius Malfoy,” Harry declared, his voice a cross between disgust and anger.
Harry was so absorbed in the moment that he almost missed Draco laughing softly beside him.
Draco stood frozen beside him, watching the first years intently. Trying to piece his own puzzle together.
“Come on, you don’t want to come to this lovely room that surrounds us?”
And it ruled everything.
His eyes fell closed as their lips touched. There were no words to describe this moment, no syllables that could do it justice.
This was how their arguments would unfold:  Harry’s genuine obliviousness to any underlying issue would result in his own defiance to anything Draco had to say.
“Cursed Objects and The Danger They Inflict,” was written in a Font that was almost as creepy as the subject it entailed.
“I’m fine, Sirius. As always.”
Borrowing Pansy’s wand turns out to be more of a hassle than he initially believes. He’s forced to do a lot of things the Muggle way, as he can really only use it when she’s not.
It all started when Hermione made friends with that one Slytherin Pansy Parkinson, and boy what a friendship it was. No one could really place what the two had in common, or what it was that kept them giggling at night, but they were a regular Lavender and Parvati and there was no separating them now.
No. Harry wouldn’t have it. Draco Malfoy was alive and breathing and impossibly stuck somewhere in the pensieve. And he needed Harry’s help.
Memory. He perked up as the walls shifted, distorting into another scene.
They were face to face now, James’s breath heavy with anger as he and Lily closed the space between them.
Before he can respond, Harry pulls out the familiar length of hawthorn from his pocket. He extends his hand, and for a moment Draco’s gaze snaps up to meet a set of vibrant green eyes.
Hermione motioned for them to come as the others began making way to the door. Harry yawned before holding up a finger, signaling that he’d be there in a moment. Truth be told, he was exhausted.
Regulus was screaming as Lupin held him down and barked in the air between their faces.
Harry nods, not quite understanding but unable to let this new Malfoy go. He gulps. “Who did this to you?” He asks, and it’s scratchy. Almost as if Harry himself is afraid of the answer.
“Potter! I fucking found you! You’re dead!” The voice belongs to Crabbe, and Draco is just coherent enough to make out his figure. He’s accompanied by Goyle, waving his wand about, attempting haphazardly to bring about some type of spell. Draco raises a weak hand to protest, but flames are already shooting from the tip of his wand toward a pile of rubbish beside them.
The expression on Draco’s face was hopeful. He was talking about becoming a potions master. About following his own dreams.
“I...uh....” Harry faltered, unable to give a good explanation for the change. Right when he was on to something, thoughts lapping at the way they’d somehow become friends over the past few hours, or perhaps even more...
“Draco?”
“You’ve got to go back, Potter. You’ve got to save the world while you still can.”
“Is Draco Malfoy breaking a sweat?” Blaise challenged facetiously as he mashed his ingredients.
“Please, Black. If you think that this-“ the blonde male threw a disgusted glance down the table- “is where you belong, you’re more pathetic than I thought.”
They were cracking up freely, humored by something that Harry had missed. He moved closer to see an empty bottle of fire whiskey propped in the middle of their circle.
The lights beamed, harsh against Draco’s porcelain skin as he smiled into the audience. His eyes, like religion or something equally as practiced, floated to a pair of bright green ones in the front. They met, and it was like electricity all over again.
“Truth.”
This moment lasted forever. And then, as soon as he was done enjoying himself, Voldemort spoke:  “You may stop now, Draco. Very well done.”
Of the desire to please, so much, that if his father pointed a wand at his throat he’d beg for forgiveness. Of pretending to have dignity for so long that he’d lost his own along the way.
“Well, I have. And let me tell you,” he leaned in, his whisper hot and heavy against the shell of his ear. “You are going to be amazing.”
“Please, Draco. I need your help. I’m going to fail transfiguration.”
“First of all, YOU punched me. Are you completely mental? And secondly... are we going... down there?”
In the next moment, several things seem to happen simultaneously. Harry suddenly grabs the diadem. Ron and Hermione have summoned brooms and are hastily mounting their only means of escape. Crabbe and Goyle back away, terrified, as the snake turns on its master and slithers toward them. Draco observes it all, shaking slightly as his muscles contract involuntarily. His leg, it’s burning, and it’s as if the more the flames travel from object to object the more consuming the pain becomes.
His eyes were red, purple circles tracing the hollows beneath.  It was clear that he hadn’t slept much.
“Not Pettigrew. My father.”
If he’d had any doubt in his mind about Draco, it would’ve dissipated in the next moment. His cheeks burned a rosy pink, reflecting the uneasy thoughts that were escalating through his mind.
It wasn’t difficult to see Draco’s mouth drop in the moonlight. “I mean, I knew that he came here, but- but this is where he sleeps once a month? No one deserves this, Potter. Not even you.”
If they would’ve kept to themselves, snorting and hiccuping wildly within their own trio, perhaps the night would’ve turned out differently.
His slate eyes were drowning pools that lacked mercy. Lily hesitated.
“Harry, what are we doing? I mean honestly,” she crossed her legs and arms, perturbed.
“It’s good versus evil. We have to pick a side; there’s no playing the middle here. And, we’ve seen what happens when you disappoint the Dark Lord.” She gestured a hand forward, referring to their conversation thus far.
“Fuck, Malfoy, when did you become such a selfless git?” He’s smiling, and Draco chuckles. It’s a beautiful truce, winding and weaving Draco whole.
He snaps to find Malfoy already staring. His face is red; he looks like he might be sick.
He continued forward as the creature-like man made its way to the middle of the aisle. Fear consumed him, but he pressed forward, like the Gryffindor that he was. He had to know how and why any of this was tied to Draco.
He watched as the Death Eaters infiltrated the castle, hated himself as they set that poor Oaf’s hut on fire. This was bad. This was horrible. For a moment, he feared there was no escape.
“But if you’re the... devil on his shoulder, then where is the angel? You said it yourself! We have light and darkness in all of us.” Harry breathed heavily with excitement at his speculation. He had to be onto something; he could feel it in the marrow of his bones.
Severus peered at him skeptically but seemed to let it go.
Severus Snape immediately had his wand drawn, but Lily was faster. The end result was a showdown between them both that began with Snape’s shocked and hurt expression but continued with Lily’s resolute one.
“You’ve heard correctly, Pettigrew. What is your reasoning for being here?” Lucius peered at him skeptically.
“Wrong. Memories.”
By third year, Draco’s distaste for Potter and his friends had grown to jealousy. If Harry Potter wanted nothing to do with him, that was fine. But why did the rest of the world love him so much? His own father seemed to pay Potter more attention than himself. His longing revealed itself through hate.
What a happy memory.
Draco shrugged as they planted feet on another floor just before the staircases began to shift.
Harry’s brow relaxed, and he allowed his eyes to fall shut. Draco didn’t move. His gaze was somehow involuntarily locked on Potter’s face, admiring subtle details that he’d never been so close to notice. He watched as Potter gave in, shoulders slumping with the conscious decision to believe that Draco wasn’t there to terrorize him. Slowly, he let his guard down.
Cedric’s Death was almost unbearable to watch again. His lifeless, cold eyes seemed to stare straight into Harry, who cried as the words “Kill the Spare” echoed through his mind.
So, instead, he crafted Potter Stinks badges and handed them to the entire school. He knew he was being an arse, but he couldn’t stop himself. His obsession was far too deep.
Pansy giggled. “Of course they wouldn’t have, silly. I’m no healer. I must admit, I did cheat a little bit. Blaise and I have our own story as to how we ended up here.” She turned to the fellow Slytherin, who readied himself to tell the story.
It was purely amazing, what he’d done. Hell, he was amazing, in every way, shape, and form.
Was he finally going to outwardly rebel against everything he’d every known?
“Fuck off, Nott.” He muttered, pulling out his quill.
He dramatically folded himself backwards onto Sirius’s lap before chuckling at his own lightheartedness.
It seemed an eternity had passed before he felt a hard surface come into contact with his face. It was painful, even in the state of a memory. He’d landed on his stomach, head first into a world unknown.
Colors ran, molding and mixing into another memory that displayed itself with unspoken significance.
It was beautiful. He was absolutely stunning, lying peacefully against Harry, and something about it just felt more right than anything else in the whole wretched world.
This time, however, he could make out faint shapes. The ceiling of a room. A mobile that was spelled to spin calmly above his head.
His eyes fell to the sidelines, where a bitter Draco Malfoy stood gossiping with his date.
“Wanna come get ice cream with us?” Teddy’s toothy grin eats at the edges of his impending monotony.
“Malfoy.” He starts, pointing his wand at Draco’s chest. He’s alone, and the silence that ensues is almost unsettling. But this time, Draco doesn’t care.
“What happened is an atrocity,” he stated, and the group held their gazes low.
Sirius and James looked at Peter, than at each other, with an expression of both great awe and amusement.
Remus chuckled lowly. “He’s never going to give up on her, is he?”
In another moment, Peter Pettigrew was gone.
“We’ve got to stop them!” His remark was reactionary, the same heroic tendency that Harry had been known to have. The one thatDraco couldn’t help but admire, stupid and rash and reckless as it was.
“Well, come on, guys, if one of us wins, we all do.” Blaise stated determinedly and flipped open his text book.
“Your leg, Draco! How is it?” He pants, pulling away slightly to examine the wound.
“You- why did you call me that?”
The air around them waved like oceans, the current flipping and flopping as one memory morphed into another. Draco instinctively grabbed Harry’s arm, unfamiliar with the alarming change in scenery.
“Are these all... Draco’s memories?”
“Oh, fuck. Fuck, this is not good...”
Without a word, he laced their fingers together.
Malfoy never looked up from the floor.
“You haven’t cracked that one yet?” He smirked, the white of his teeth gleaming wickedly against a taut upper lip.
“Perhaps you should join the other students in the Great Hall. It would, of course, be safer for you that way. To answer your question, however, I believe they have entered from the somewhere on the seventh floor.”
“Yes, sir.” They answered at the same time, smiling sideways at the sentiment.
The voice belonged to James Potter, who was perched casually on his four poster. The boy unpacking his trunk in the corner jumped, clearly not expecting to be addressed.
Suddenly, Draco had an idea.
“You know, you’d have to actually get out of those restraints first.” He watched as his father continued to wiggle, lacking a witty response as he fought unsuccessfully to beak free.
Ghostly shadows dance along the walls, flickering in the dim light of the TV. The world seems to grow around him, and he is infintismal.
“I can attest to that.” James added his palm forward, and Lily followed with a genuine smile. The group looked to Peter, who placed his hand centrally without a word.
His lips pulled upward in that crooked smile that Harry held dear to his heart. Without another word, Harry reached for Draco’s hand and held it gently as the memory came to a close.
“If you say so.”
His words hung in the air as his chest heaved with emotion. Sirius’s expression relaxed into one of comfort and caring.
Harry pulls away suddenly, and the absence is heavily vacant upon his lips. His stomach twinges as Harry snaps upward. It is all too evident that they are no longer alone.
“Please, Potter. Spare me the mushy gushy crap.”
Harry couldn’t quite explain why those pink cheeks were making his stomach lurch.
It was the light snoring and a subtle pressure against his left pectoral muscle that caught his attention next. His train of thought came crashing as rapidly as it had arrived at what he saw and... felt.
“Is that a threat, Potter?”
“Sure.”
“Oh, please, don’t tell me you haven’t thought about it. You two have a lot more in common now than you ever did before.” She leaned back, crossing her arms and legs with a smug expression that screamed self-satisfaction.
“Yeah?”
“Because... I’m... you were...”
Remus Lupin’s mouth dropped, and for a moment it seemed he didn’t know how to respond. But after another second passed, his instincts won and he reached his neck and hands upward to bring their lips together.
“Did you see the most recent decree from the old cow? Boys and girls not permitted within six inches of each other.” Pansy snorted as she gawked at the ridiculousness of the rule. She looped her arms flirtatiously around both Crabbe and Goyle, who were perched on either side of her.
“It’s quite alright, Potter. I’m just glad my jaw isn’t broken again.”
“My life is different with you, too, Harry. I swear to Merlin, you better wake up. You have to. I love you, you prat.”
“We must make atonement for our loss. This battle will not reflect the conclusion of the war. We will win, Draco, and you are to play a part in that.”
Suddenly, and for some reason that didn’t quite make sense, Harry knew deep down to the core that Draco had been caught up in the moment just as much as he had been. And that fact alone was why he was laughing so hard.
Harry couldn’t help but smirk at Malfoy’s lack of enthusiasm. The whole thing seemed slightly funny, and he felt an odd sense of appreciation for the blonde as his feet touched the dirt floor of the tunnel. If anything, at least this would be entertaining.
“Whatcha been studying?” Peter asked, breaking the moment. Lupin turned to him with an exhausted smile.
“All this talk of myself and Potter got me thinking you might enjoy having a good one on one with Gregory over here.” Draco gestured toward Goyle, who seemed unaffected by the idea. He shrugged.
“It’s comparative to muggle cancer,” the Healer told Draco, who’d refused to move from Harry’s side. “It’s extremely rare. And it seems to affect only Half-Bloods. We haven’t found a cure for this. I’m... sorry.”
And in between those two things was a very determined Draco Malfoy.
“James! Put him down!” Lily cried, and Potter obeyed. Snape’s body hit the ground with a thud, and his wide, exasperated eyes scanned Lily for any sign of forgiveness.
Draco gulped as Pansy and Blaise separated.
For the third time that day, Harry felt his breath catch in the hollow of his chest.
“Yes, I’ve heard the prophecy. Now why am I here?!”
“Our lives.” Pansy and Blaise answered simultaneously.
Peter couldn’t see the smug grin that crossed his face when he finally muttered the word “wait!”
Coincidentally of course, Draco turned and eyed the library as if he’d heard something.
“But you don’t see me getting desperate, either, do you, dear?” She leaned over her book and eyed her challengingly.
With the nuisance out of their way, the group continued onto the whomping willow.
Greengrass hiccuped and rested her head against Blaise’s shoulder; Blaise wiggled his eyebrows at Draco.
Again, louder. “Reinervate!”
“What makes you think that?” Blaise questioned with a single brow raised.
Draco and Blaise froze under the scrutiny of every adult in the room. They had, in fact, been busted.
But at that moment, Remus Lupin let out the loudest noise that Harry had ever heard come from anyone in that situation EVER- not that he’d heard that situation at all, really- but it was enough to cause him to jump a second time and suddenly he realized that he’d hopped straight toward Draco, who was pulled from the sight before them and was now glancing at Harry up and down like he was something he nervously wanted to eat.
Most of those who were sorted he’d never heard of. Draco quickly became bored beside him, tapping his heel at the length of the ceremony. Harry’s eyes were glued on his mother. The way she smiled at her fellow housemates, her shy laugh at something someone had said. It was all so very captivating.
“I know that you two have somewhat of a jagged history. But I do hope that in these dire times you may be able to set aside your differences as you seem to have been doing in detention.” He glanced between the two, and Harry nodded determinedly.
His despair was tangible as the edges of the memory began to blur, fading into nothing. Harry reached forward, placing a translucent hand on his thigh for comfort that he knew wouldn’t be felt.
He avoids him at all costs; ignores his voice shouting down the corridors after him. Studies in his dormitory. Keeps his eyes on the floor, aimed oppositely of those fucking green irises, that smile...
They were outside.
“What’s your problem?” James called before Sirius had a chance to react.
“Having fun yet?” He asked suavely, and Pansy nodded her head at them both, a facetious undertone to her gesture.
Self-appeased, Pansy grinned. “Sounds like a lovely time. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Was he even... alive? The word, even in his thoughts, seemed choked. No, Draco couldn’t go. Not like this. Not when he’d just broken free... not when he’d been given, like the Marauders, his own... second chance...
It was amazing what he’d learned in just a few short looks through the eyes of his former nemesis. His gut tugged at the prospect of what he might see next.
“God, I never would’ve had the courage to tell you that if I wasn’t completely pissed. I’m no Gryffindor.”
There was silence as their eyes held, emotions running high, Remus still processing what they’d done for him. He couldn’t help the tears that blinded him, making his vision cloudy.
“I won’t let you down, Harry. Not now, not ever.”
“I’m- I’m not dying,” he declares, more to himself than anyone else, and Harry’s still beaming as he presses a continuation of their earlier kiss to his lips. It’s war, but in this brief moment, they’re fucking happy, and that’s all that matters.
“I know about you, Draco. I know all about your traitor status; your own personal betrayal to both your family and mine.”
She shared a puzzled glance with Ron, who was busy giving Malfoy his own once over.
If only he’d known the truth.
Draco paused at the door, as if contemplating whether he should open it.
“You’ll never make up for what you’ve done,” he hears his father say, and the words are a gun to his head.
“Fuck, Harry, I’m so sorry.” His words were a whisper, an apology that echoed in the silence. Harry was heaving, trying to catch his breath, and Draco couldn’t help but notice how attractive it was... how fucking beautiful he was...
He chuckled, wrapping his own arms around her. Harry had known that the Slytherins were close, but he had no idea that they’d grown up together.
Harry couldn’t quite hear the details, but in the next moment Pansy was begging her parents for permission to go into the garden as a distraction while Blaise snagged an entire bottle of the finest elvish wine from atop a nearby counter and stuffed it into his robes.
His magic resonated a bluish-white hue that emanated outward and twisted through the air towards its target.
“Git.”
“Well, forgive me, Black, but it appears that Bella and I are a little... preoccupied?” Snape lifted his hands in the air in a gesture of sarcastic surrender.
The other boy was a dark skinned bloke whose demeanor was much more suave than anyone of his age.
At that moment a very human James Potter emerged through the door, wand drawn and pointed resolutely at the enemy. He walked forward slowly to join the side of his friends, eyes never losing focus of each target.
Sirius all but ran to his side, and tired eyes opened to meet the darkest of brown. He immediately placed a hand over Lupin’s, a seriousness settling between them as Black smiled warmly.
It was a prospect he couldn’t pass up, regardless of doubt or fear. And so, with guts he hadn’t known he possessed, he spoke the spell that would come to change everything.
Harry cocked his head at Draco’s uncanny knowledge of just exactly how he felt while dancing.
“So, uh.. Malfoy,” Harry coughed with a grin, taking his hand as if to lead him somewhere.
He gulped down the lump in his throat; he hadn’t even realized it was there.
“Are you going to be able to sleep?” The words were a whisper, an edgeless confession.
But as it seals shut, he’s left in the silence that he suddenly realizes is indicative of his safety. Next to him is Granger, pulling Ron to a standing position. On his other side is Harry, fucking Harry…
As he stopped and turned to view himself a few months prior, his gut sank at the impossibility of his own stupidity.
Draco rounded the corner, clearly making his way past Gryffindor tower and toward the dungeons. When he hastily sped around the corridor, however, the sight of a self-appeased past Harry snogging Ginny Weasley stopped him dead in his tracks.
All of Draco’s bigoted behavior suddenly made sense now. Like pieces clicking in place, Harry saw clear as day through his mind’s eye every insult thrown his way, every sneer sent in his direction. The blood supremacist jabs toward Hermione; the monetary bias toward Ron. Every single one of them was a front. An attempt to win at the game his father was playing, and he never even had a chance.
Before he can answer, Draco points upward. “Potter, look,” He states, his hazy vision landing on the most peculiar glint of sapphire. “It’s a diadem. Isn’t it pretty?”
“Not as much as I enjoy seeing you flustered. Prat.”
This is why Harry was itching to know just what Draco Malfoy was humming, poised elegantly as he always was in a chair while he read. He’d watch as his eyes would scan a book, or a roll of parchment, and his lips would mouth the words of some mystery song softly. And his attention would loll on his mouth, trying to piece together phrases at first, but then... he’d begun to daydream about them. They were the gentlest shade of pink, like rose or carnation or some other sappy color, and they were far from chapped (unlike Harry, who was constantly battling dehydration). He wondered what they would feel like, how they could possibly taste, and before long he began to blame the unknown music for all of his embarrassing yet intriguing thoughts. Sometimes they would come at meals, when Malfoy had his earphones secretly slung through his robes as he ate. And Harry would blush, staring unintentionally until they’d meet eyes and he’d glance away quickly and self consciously. That damned iPod, what could he possibly be listening to? And why was he suddenly so bloody attractive while he did it?
Soon the classroom was full with excited eleven-year-olds.
He shared a compartment with the Slytherins: Theo, Pansy, Goyle, Blaise and Crabbe.
“I-. My classes are over for the day and I’m just waiting up for Ron and Hermione. And I put my stuff in my locker because I wanted to study with Malfoy and Blaise but they’re not in the library, so I put them back here and I’ll do the homework with Ron and Hermione over the weekend and. Yeah.”
They had breakfast at a beautiful café in the Alley and got themselves a huge cup of ice cream at
“Nothing.”
they were the only ones who knew and all the teachers seemed to trust their collegue too much. When they had told Hagrid about their theory that Snape was after the Philosopher's stone, he completely overreacted and insisted that Snape would never do that, he had helped to guard it after all. But their research took longer than expected. Hermione was full on in study mode, panicking that every hour she didn't prepare for the examinations would be the one causing her to fail.

Before joining the Slytherins again he put his trademark smirk on.
He could get a glimpse of the lake reflecting the moonlight through a window nearby.

Draco blatantly ignored
It was long!
Once again Draco was at a loss for words. He just kept staring at him in disbelief. Eventually he too returned to his homework.
Molly didn't seem to have heard him, though. She just continued to brush white ashes off his robes. Mr Weasley meanwhile used this chance to cast
“I apologize.”
He sneaked a glance at Blaise’s textbook. Astrophysics. Harry was glad he didn’t take that. It looked really complex. There was apparently a ridiculous amount of maths involved. Not just pretty pictures of planets and galaxies with latin names.
As soon as Snape was out of the great hall the trio followed, but instead of going upstairs they made their way down into the dungeons. When they finally were out of everyone's eyesight Harry took out his father's cloak and threw it over their heads. Hidden like this they continued walking through the dark and chilly corridors. The only person who came across their way was a fourth year Slytherin walking in the opposite direction. Probably the Slytherin common room was down there, that would pretty much fit the house's image. Then they arrived at the potions classroom door. It was locked, as they had expected.
Not sure how to continue, Harry looked at him and they locked eyes. There were unspoken words of gratitude in the grey ones which were still wide and stirred up.
and it hit him hard when he realised that he wouldn't be able to talk to them for months.
The man smiled as he gave back the book.

"Slytherin won fair and square! Then, he first changed the points so that Ravenclaw would've won but no, that's not enough! He had to give stupid Longbottom ten points for his fat arse being in the way of others! He didn't even deserve half of the points and then Ravenclaw would've won! Only because Gryffindor is his favorite. Probably was a stupid Gryffindork himself!"
always feared."
Oh and her voice. It was like angels singing a symphony. Like pure magic. Something was squirming in Harry's stomach when Cho grabbed his hand, pulling him towards the boy's staircase. Before he had caught on to what was happening she had pushed him inside his dormitory with a muttered "sorry" and closed the door behind him.
And so it was decided that they would take a look into Snapes office. But first they had to work out a plan.
“Hey, Harry!”
And then the Howler came.
got in there, why didn't he? - and rolled his eyes at everyone who ended up in any other house. That was up until a little girl with long, dirty blonde hair, who had just been sorted into Ravenclaw, sat down right next to him. The girl was wearing radishes as earrings and a flower necklace. Well, they didn't lool like flowers usually looked like but he couldn't figure what else they were supposed to be. Her big eyes wandered over every inch of the great hall, taking in all of it, and inevitably landed on Draco, making her soft smile grow wider and her eyes shine brighter.
. And he most certainly did not feel bad when he insulted Langdorn (Ugh, that name practically
“…they also have water?”
“Ah, and there I was thinking you had ‘never sullied your pure body with this filthy stuff’.”
Being sorted into Ravenclaw was probably the worst thing that will ever happen to him!
, he thought to himself.
While he was hearing three boys snoring from the other side of the room, the bed to his left was empty. A short look on uncle Vernon's old watch told him it was not time for breakfast, yet.
Draco sighed in relief.
“Ah, so much wasted time. Even with all that extra practice you were never able to beat me.”
Goldstein asked what Draco was thinking.
Draco panicked. His heart rate refused to calm down and anger overwhelmed him.
Slowly he made his way over to the cabinet, taking a look at some interesting objects but mostly faking his interest in them. His mind was completely focused on the weird reflections on the floor right in front of the small open slit of the cabinet door. Reflections such as the ones only produced by curved glass.
Time passed by very fast.
It had to happen tonight.
First Harry didn't know who to sit with, so he chose to sit down alone at a table in the second row.

“What was it about? Me without a shirt?”
This was going to be the best day in weeks and not even the christmas carol singing armours could get him down.
Someone or something was snoring inside the corridor. Whatever it was, it seemed to be asleep.
McGonagall's lips were thinner than ever. Harry opened his mouth to explain their situation but was cut off by Hermione.

He really wished Blaise were here to start a conversation. On Thursday the two of them had actually been talking to each other pretty decently while Draco was reading and jutting in with some judging noises every now and then.
So Draco had decided to stop Potter from returning to Hogwarts. First he had sent Dobby to capture all his letters before they reached Harry and when that hadn't worked out properly he’d told the house elf to talk to the other boy, to convince him to stay home.
It sounded a bit forced. Probably one of the other two had told him to make the offer. But he was not going to throw that chance away.
At 11PM on the appointed day Harry and Hermione were knocking on Hagrids door who opened it teary eyed. Ron had had to stay behind because the cloak would never be able to cover the three of them
“Are you ready yet? You’re taking ages and we- Holy crap, you look gorgeous!”
When they both agreed they sped up to catch up with the gamekeeper.

With that Malfoy strode off wearing his trademark smirk.
Draco gulped and took a deep breath before he turned back towards his captain.
“I had a favourite. It even returned once or twice.”
“Uh, yeah. Here.”
to be seen and somehow Harry didn't even find that surprising. Although it would be quite interesting to know where that git always ran off to. There was no time for pondering in that moment, though, because a little redhead slid into the seat next to her brother, interrupting his thoughts. He spared Ginny a smile and then let Hermione lead the conversation with the first year.
Her small body started shivering all over.
on first try.
And here they were.
Monday started with double Potions together with Hufflepuff. Draco's favorite subject with his godfather as teacher. But on Friday when they had made their first potion, a cheer-up brew, he'd gotten paired up with a Hufflepuff.
“I'll go for chaser, I guess.”
"Harry? Harry?! Are you alright?"
They were just outside the office when they bumped right into Snape. Just what they had needed in this moment. The potions master said something but Harry couldn't hear a word as he was suddenly boiling with hot
bearing his father’s name. As if it would make ‘Lucius Malfoy’ transform into ‘Harry Potter’ or ‘Albus Dumbledore’ or some other dumbass. Nothing changed. Aggressively he banged the door shut and made his way to Madam Hooch’s office. Maybe she would take them and keep them as school brooms.
“Look, let's pick up our stuff. People are still staring.”
When they had looked through almost everything they finally agreed with her and left after checking that they hadn't left a trace. But even though they were wearing the invisibility cloak they didn't meet a soul. Neither another Slytherin nor a certain potions master. Right before crossing the entrance hall they took off the cloak and Ron immediately started whisper shouting at Hermione.
"what time?"
Malfoy snorted. “I wonder how well
He just responded with an acknowledging
Suddenly he made out a movement to his right. When he turned his head he found an odd-looking door appearing on the wall. It was wooden, like many doors in this castle, but still very different. Not as old. Not as... severe. It almost seemed soft. And in purple color there was a word written across it, right on his eye level. It said:
"Exactly."
Salazar, this girl was way too cheerful by his means. And... wait.
Draco settled down between a fourth year and a sixth year. They were the least likely to start a conversation with him. Everytime Potter looked at him with concern after what had happened, he felt the strong urge to just tell him everything or let himself being hold by him.
“So, we’re done now?”
Marietta, Cho's best friend, had spotted him and indicated to him to join them, where the two of them were sitting on a sky-blue love seat.
It was lucky that he'd decided to go this way after Hedwig had settled in the owlery and that he saw the door to the forbidden corridor standing wide open. Malfoy didn't answer at once.
"But Hagrid..."
After a while, he dared to pull Draco a little closer. He tried to make it seem like he wasn’t doing it on purpose, but Draco immediately caught onto it. He raised an eyebrow and let his smile grow a little wider, his teeth were sticking out against the deep colour of his lips. The next thing he knew, Draco’s arms were circled around his neck. Harry abruptly stopped dancing. His brain couldn’t process all those sensations at once
Draco’s lips twitched into a small smile as well for a moment. “Good morning. Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you.”
Since his fourth birthday, when his father had taken him to his first Quidditch match, he'd been in love with the sport and the idea of becoming a professional Quidditch player was stuck inside his head. The match taking place in front of him was quite eventful. Slytherin clearly had the upper hand, they were leading 50 to 10 after ten minutes, but their seeker almost got hit by a bludger, sent from a Weasley, twice. Not long after, unfortunately, Gryffindor caught up and the counter stayed at 60 to 60 for almost an entire hour. Suddenly Flint made a dirty move, knocking Wood off his broom with a bludger causing angry shouts from the Gryffindor stands. After that, the game came to an end very fast. Without the Gryffindor's keeper it was an easy one for Slytherin to score three more times in a row and before Gryffindor had a chance to return the 'favor', the Slytherin seeker caught the snitch. Deafening cheers erupted around Draco and he left his seat exitedly discussing the match with Blaise and Crabbe.
Harry blushed.
Taking a good guess he went to the infirmary trying to avoid the most used corridors as he wasn't sure if the curfew was still on at five o'clock In the morning. When he arrived at the portal he put an ear against the wood and as the only thing he heard were muffled snores he entered silently. There were two occupied beds. The snoring came from the one with bright red hair sprawled across the pillow. Draco scrunched his nose in disgust.
No one could see.
from the depths of his trunk. He had read all of it before the start of first year, but he couldn’t remember it saying anything about a room that appeared as required. He figured that maybe he had just missed it the first time.
Suddenly a thin hand softly squeezed his in a grateful gesture, took the glasses and pulled back again. For about a minute Draco just kept standing right there, frozen in his tracks but all warm and fuzzy on the inside. Then, pushing these sensations to the back of his mind, he continued to take in all the magical artefacts in the shop until his father calles him to go.
Harry refocused his attention from the conversation he was overhearing behind him to Ron sitting across from him.
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
"Ha, ha, very funny, Malfoy. But seriously, when are we going to learn some exciting stuff?"
Oops, probably a little too much.
He shouldn't like this Potter boy even though he was so nosy!
Due to the feast rule Harry couldn't sit with the Weasleys and Hermione, so he sat down next to Malfoy. At first he kind of expected the other boy to insult him and push him away but the blonde only shortly looked up and then turned his gaze back to his empty plate again. Cho had taken the train back home the day before so he had no one to talk to. This made him think of something.
History of magic was just boring and Snape, the greasy-haired potions professor,
Madam Pince shushed her.
He didn't rip the paper off as carelessly as he did with the others. Putting the "shiny" wrapping aside he held a small black box with silver lettering in his hand which Draco knew contained a
Draco sneered, probably thinking he had won this round, and followed Blaise to a table in the farthest corner.
One of my favourite chapters! Slight trigger warning for child abuse but nothing really physical.
Harry’s head shot around to look back at him and Draco noticed how pale he was. The blue moonlight falling onto his features didn’t make it any better. He had some kind of haunted look in his eyes. Draco felt something like concern welling up in his chest... no,
“I didn't know!”
Draco's eyebrows furrowed in anger and he was just about to tell her off for it when Harry as well as Severus turned up and class started. After they got their instructions on how to continue with their potion the girl - he didn't even try to remember her name - started talking. All the bloody time. And she just wouldn't shut up. Whispering and babbling  about everything and anything. Draco didn't care to listen and concentrated on the potion instead. Every now and then he caught something like :
Harry was ripped from his thoughts when Flitwick instructed them to attempt the tickling charm on their partners. He paired up with Ron while Hermione was stuck with Padma Patil, whose Gryffindor counterpart was already giggling with her best friend Lavender even though neither of them had their wands out, yet.
"Should we sit with Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table ?"
She named the positions while pointing in a different direction each and the players did as told. Truthful to Cho's word the majority grouped in the seekers’ corner. No one went for beater. The captain pulled her eyebrows together at that, but moved on fast.
"On my way, auntie!"
Narcissa asked, trying to lighten the mood.
Caught off guard and confused by the last comment he actually wished her a “good night” and before he was able to take it back he received a blasting grin in return that made him want to smile as well. Then, her blonde head disappeared in the mass of other students and Draco bit his cheek to gain control over his facial expressions again. Getting up and out of the great hall he thought about sneaking off to
