“Well... Maybe... Maybe they ran away, Ron? Because of this? I know that the Wizarding world can be prejudiced when it wants to and... Maybe they were afraid to come out?” She asked, and Ron shook his head vehemently.
Harrys paws were for sure going to make a hole on the floor. Even though he was in his wolf form, his thoughts were very much human, and he couldn’t stop thinking about his mate suffering. Draco’s whimpers were enough to make Harry go near him, lying beside the white wolf and licking his face.
“Harry,” he said, putting his head up, his mouth red and wet from what he was doing to me. “Call me Harry.”
“I have no idea. I’ll tell you once I know. See you at the Common Room,” Harry promised, and rushed to follow professor McGonagall, who was leaving the Great Hall already.
“Yeah, he was… Broken, I think. He wouldn’t look me in the eye. And now he’s spent a whole year doing community service. I really think he has changed.”
Ron looked at the tapestry, not knowing what to say. Everything was getting more confusing, but more than ever, he was sure that Harry and Draco were alive ... And perhaps, more comfortable than Ron Weasley seemed to believe.
“Do you know how to create fire? Water? Do you know how to do a ‘reparo’?” Harry asked, and Draco shook his head.
“I might get you pregnant.” Draco thought maybe Harry was trying to find reason in what they were doing, but Draco was past that. He
I nearly kissed him in front of the whole school. It would be such a bad idea, but I wanted it so much. When he was singing, looking into my eyes as if his moon was me, I melted. I don’t even know how I’ve managed to sing my part of the base when he was looking at me like I held the whole world in my hands.
“I don’t know why you pick on me. Draco hasn’t finished faster just because he’s eating like a bloody starved garden gnome and has repeated dinner twice.”
“Pregnancy cravings are real! Everything tastes better when my mind asks me for it!” Hermione said, and Ron laughed, looking at his wife like she was everything in his world.
“I’ll take the bed on the wall if you don’t mind. I don’t like to wake up with the sun,” Malfoy said, and Harry nodded.
“I don’t hate you, Malfoy. But believe me, it's much easier to feed one person than two,” He said, approaching the first coconut tree. “I'll get some coconuts so we can hydrate and some green leaves of this coconut tree to make a shelter and protect us from the rain. Look for other leaves like these on the floor and sticks, branches or whatever is close to it. Do something useful with your hands,” Harry said, putting the knife in his belt for quick access and easily climbing the coconut tree. He could hear Malfoy complaining, but a quick look down indicated that the blond was doing what he asked. “And watch your head! I'll throw the coconuts down there.” He warned, and set about doing his job.
In the end, when the day came, Dracy seemed much more prepared than Harry. The pains started at night, over dinner. They ate and drank, but Dracy didn't want to go up to the cabin, preferring to stay in the hammock. Harry didn't leave him alone, staying with him and trying to help ease the pain.
“Thank you for coming to me, my love,” Harry responded, and touched his nose to Draco’s nose, their engagement rings touching where their hands met over Draco’s stomach. “I love you.”
James would coo as a reply, and clap his chubby hands. They were expectantly waiting for his first few words, and seeing their baby boy grow as Draco's bump grew at the same time was almost magical.
thirty-five-year-old Draco said, looking down at two pairs of golden-green eyes that belonged to his children. Leo was five and Ursa was eight, but both of them couldn’t ever get tired of listening to the story of how their parents got together.
“Yes, and Castor will be in my arms,” Draco said. “I think if we sit him on my right leg, the baby bump will be visible.”
“Okay. Where is it?” Harry asked, trying not to be nervous. He was going to live with Malfoy in close quarters for a whole school year. It was going to be fine. It was. “I have to talk to…”
“More, if you count Shell Cottage. It’s one of our family properties as well, and Bill inherited it. He’s the oldest kid, you know.” And then he looked straight into Hermione’s eyes. “The other house is going to go to the next kid who marries, so…”
“It makes sense, I guess. No one would try to punch him in his pointy face if you’re there. Not even us.”
Ron bit his lower lip, taking a deep breath and nodding. The Ministry might not even want to expend resources to find the man who saved the lives of all those people, but he and Hermione would never stop trying to find him, especially knowing that he was alive.
“It’s no worry, boy. Melinda here is Muggle-born. She probably knows any song you’d like to sing.” Professor Flitwick pointed to the 6
His small hand touched Harry’s bigger one, and although his long fingers and groomed nails looked delicate, his grip was firm.
“I know. But I’ve called you to eat with me many times. You should just stop what you’re doing at lunchtime and come with me.”
In late June, Harry could clearly see the delicate, round curve of Draco's belly. There was a baby in there. Harry felt an intense urge to touch and kiss that little bit of himself inside Draco, but he knew that his lover was not comfortable with that part of his body. Draco pretended that his belly didn't exist, and that there was nothing different about himself. It hurt Harry, but he didn't know how to talk to Draco about it without making him even sadder.
Harry sighed, turning his face to the island as they gradually walked away. He and Draco had previously agreed on how to use the oars synchronously, and their willingness to survive made them easily come to terms.
“Later, Harry,” Draco said, although his body said otherwise. Fuck, maybe he’d get another one sooner than later. They’d never used protection, even after Draco got pregnant at their first night together. They were surprised when it took two years after Ursa to Draco to fall pregnant again, and four for their next baby. Maybe destiny was giving them time to enjoy every kid individually before the next came, but they’ve always wanted a big family so it wasn’t that bad. Besides, their house was huge and they could afford it, so the more, the merrier.
With one hand, Draco grabbed Harry’s hard cock, licking the underside provocatively before wrapping his mouth around the glans. Draco closed his eyes, starting to move his head up and down, letting his saliva run the length of it, Harry's taste making him even more excited.
He left the lake, taking off his wet clothes and throwing them on the rocks that surrounded the fire, now extinguished. The sun was almost up when he took a long piece of cloth to wrap the around the baby, another piece of cloth to dry both Dracy and his daughter, and dry clothes for Dracy.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at him, even after all the chaos, even after all the stress, even if the picture wasn’t perfect, even if his boys were little devils full of energy, he wouldn’t trade this life for anything in the world.
Upon reaching the room, however, Hermione frowned. There was something different about the tapestry. The image with Draco's name had moved, along with Harry's, both becoming more centered on the tapestry, and side by side. Between the two images of Harry and Draco, there was an interwoven gold thread, and in place of "Malfoy" there was now "Potter" next to Draco's name.
His whole body combusted, like lightning went inside him through his fingers and all over his body. All the hairs in his body stood on end, and his heart missed a beat. He looked up to Harry and the man was looking down at him as if they’d seen each other for the first time.
“He was okay when we had Castor, wasn’t he?” Sirius nodded, even if he still looked a bit nervous. “He’ll be okay now, too. Just promise me you will take care of your brothers and you’ll do what uncle Ron and aunt Hermione tell you.”
“You are as necessary in that place as I am. Soon they will be here. Come on, we need to make a shelter, find water and food before it gets dark,” Harry reached his hand so Draco could stand, but he didn't take his hand. “Fine, starve yourself.”
“Come on, Potter. We need to sleep. Tomorrow we will have a busy day,” Draco said, turning his back to Harry and settling down to sleep.
“Look, Malfoy, I want to be here as much as you want me to be here. So let’s just pretend the other doesn’t exist and go on with our lives, shall we?” Potter said, looking bored as Flitwick started distributing the pages with the songs we were supposed to be practising that day.
Draco was curious to see the people in the photos, but he stopped in the middle of the living room, his rescuer turning to face him as he took off his hat, mask, gloves and coat.
“They are remedies... Muggle potions.” Harry explained. “This one is for cough, and this one, headache.”
“That’s what you say. You’ve never presented any proof that we are not wasting time and money looking for them.”
thing I could have without the Golden Trio putting their noses into it, but apparently not anymore. When Harry Potter crossed the door of the Choir Room and walked to Flitwick, I didn’t really give a rat’s arse about it. He was the Quidditch star, it didn’t matter why he was here, right?
nobility, a Duchess, but still, I was her prince and she owned me respect. We were together since we were babies, though, and it was hard to actually make her treat me as a prince.
“We should probably have a look at the bedroom,” Harry said, and they both moved to the bedroom door.
After the first month, Draco stopped being news. He was studying all the time with Harry, Ron and Hermione at the Library, and most nights all of them would sit around Harry and Draco’s common room to talk or play some games. Ron found a fine match at Wizard’s Chess in Draco, and sometimes Hermione and Harry would sit beside them and watch them play.
It still scared me a bit, though, to think that my future husband, alpha and breeder was almost 7 feet tall. I didn’t know if he was exactly that size, but it seemed like to me. He was
was big, Harry had to lie and say he was around that size too. He was ashamed of being shorter than Ron and having a 10 inches’ cock. Not that Harry was short. He got fairly tall after the war and he was finally eating properly. But still, it was weird.
I had four months of probation, working my arse off to clean the castle before classes officially started again. It makes you think, when you’re cleaning splotches of dried, old blood from the castle walls.
“And your lady's name?” Roberto turned to Draco. Harry was about to say that Draco wasn’t a girl when he squeezed Harry’s arm tightly.
“Let’s imagine I am your friend – not saying I am, but hypothetically thinking I am. How would the whole thing work? You have your friends and the Weasleys, they
“And now, I’m going to take you home, change your clothes, and leave a letter to your boss telling him you needed a moment after the botched spell. Is that fine?”
“We only have four basses, Harry. Max is not going to be with us, so it goes down to three. Me and Payton are needed here,” John, one of the other basses, said. He and Payton were Slytherins, but we actually became good mates in the past two weeks. It was a bit of an inside joke to tease the tenors and be teased back. The choir had seven tenors, so we were a bit outnumbered, but we formed an union of sorts.
“Yes, because we didn’t feel like it was safe for him. He had suffered attacks before returning to Hogwarts, and most of them came from ex-classmates from his own house – they haven’t returned, but we surely don’t want him to be at their mercy if we can help it. Mr Malfoy is not… The same as he was the last time we’ve seen him.” McGonagall said, and Harry nodded. Yes, it was true. The last time Harry had seen him, he wouldn’t even look him in the eye.
“Mr Donahue, it’s your turn.” Flitwick called, and Maximillian got up, feeling a bit nervous. He walked to the front stage, but instead of preparing himself for his solo, and whispered something in Flitwick’s ear.
“Do you have any other non-deadly ideas?” Malfoy asked, raising an eyebrow and also crossing his arms. Harry noticed when the gray eyes dropped to his bare chest and back to his face. Harry tried not to feel cocky, and managed to keep his face serious for very little.
Harry breathed in, calming himself down and looking at Draco, who had the sweetest, more manipulative smile in the world. Harry sighed, shaking his head and kissing his husband on his lips, making his boys make gagging sounds at them.
“It’s okay, you can call me cute all you want. I mean, I think you’re cute, too,” Draco had his confirmation, and he was blushing hard at the compliment. Harry smiled, and grabbed two bowls and two plates, putting it in the island where Draco was seated. He put some fresh bread on the plates, and stew on the bowls after turning off the fire.
When my fox touched my maybe mate, it would be unstoppable and I’m sure I wouldn’t know how to hold it back. I’m pretty sure we didn’t pick this up before because… Well, one: we were at war. Two: no one actually scents their mates before shifter adulthood, that more of less come around 15 or 16 years old, when we presented and our smell changed slightly to show others what gender we were. Mother said mine got a hint of mint when I presented, and I knew Potter’s scent was mostly caramel before he presented as alpha. And, three: I actually hated what Potter represented, and I know he hated me too. That hatred made his scent nauseous to me, and I got angry every time I scented his caramel smell. I didn’t understand what it meant, but it just got my blood boiling. Maybe it was because my body knew he was ours and we couldn’t have him because of all the hatred around us.
With a flick of his wand, he cleaned them both and started zipping up his jeans. Draco took a little more to start pulling up his trousers and buttoning them. He turned to Harry, heavy, dark eyes, and grinned, tiredly.
“It was just about 200 meters, I couldn’t have hit anything, don’t worry. Most people are smart enough to stay inside,” Harry smiled, showing white, perfect teeth, and Draco felt like punching his smug face. “Let me show you the guest room, and then I can give you a house tour.”
“It’s getting worse, isn’t it? Well, at least you’re safe and inside. Could’ve died outside. Nobody taught you that you shouldn’t get out in a snow storm?”
They were sitting in their settee, Harry reading a Quidditch magazine and Draco trying to draw something for a new client, and he felt tears gathering at his eyes. He couldn’t focus on his art, and the feeling was starting to get overwhelming.
Harry got near her at the door, opening it for her and accepted her simple ‘thank you, Mr Potter’ as they crossed the doors.
The lack of practice made the work take longer. Harry made the shelter as he remembered in training, but Malfoy kept giving his opinion about every little move, even though he wasn't helping that much, and Harry had to control himself not to curse him, because sometimes he needed a second pair of hands and, once he realised the urgency of the situation, Malfoy was willing to help him.
Then, Harry positioned himself in the middle of Draco’s legs, pushing into him slowly, his thick cock stretching him, slick flowing out when Harry pressed inside. It was marvellous, the feeling of being inside Draco without the protective spell. He had to close his eyes so as not to come too fast. It was so hot and slippery and tight, and Harry knew that the first time couldn’t last too long. But he wanted Draco to come first.
“We’re going! Right, Harry?” Draco looked down at him, beaming, and Harry physically felt summer taking over the office.
His saviour went back to his truck, moving forward and stopping in front of Draco’s car. He locked Draco’s car with a chain and then he pulled it forward. It took a few seconds, but it finally gave in, moving with the truck. Draco heard the crunch of the snow beneath his wheels. The man towed him around, and Draco helped a little but decided to let the man do his job.
“Draco, my love,” Harry started as he left the bed to tend for their baby girl. “I’d do it every single night, for the rest of my life. I love you, and I love our babies.”
To be honest, I teased him on principle. He was Potter, I was Malfoy, it just was our thing, being enemies. I didn’t actually hate the bloke, although I did somewhere in the past. Before I knew who the Dark Lord really was. Before I saw a damn snake eat someone on my dining table. Before I realised my family was in the wrong.
King Harry looked a thousand feet tall dressed in his shiny armour with a red cape. My knees got wobbly with how intensely he was looking at me with his shiny green eyes. I could feel them piercing into my very soul. His hair was as black as night, and it wasn’t slick or behaved, but messy, as if he had just stepped down from the back of his stallion. His skin was tanned, and an angry, lightning-like scar adorned his forehead’s right side.
Talking about Draco’s memories with his mother, then seeing pictures of her. They sat between the flowers with albums on their laps, talking and laughing of Draco’s baby photos. He was such an adorable little kid, that Harry just wanted to reach out, grab that baby and cuddle him forever.
, and he couldn’t be bothered right now, when Draco was bobbing his head, with his eyes closed and such a perfect expression on his face, like he was
Draco smiled, kissing Harry on the lips and moving his hips against the Auror's cock, his cunt starting to get wet, slipping over him. Slowly, he went down Harry's body, kissing in the middle of his chest and following the trail of hair towards his navel, and then, lower.
Ron made a face like he was going to barf when seeing Draco pour honey over his sausages and beans, and Draco showed him the two fingers – while still trying to hide it from 2 years old Rosie.
“Yeah, you did,” Ginny answered, and Harry smiled at them as he held Draco’s hand and they all started walking to the Eight Year Common Room. Perhaps they’d have to tell their friends – officially, at least – about their relationship. But for now, they were just enjoying the moment.
“Yeah, but we’re all dressed as penguins and we can’t even play outside. It sucks,” Sirius said, pointing to his own light green wizarding robes, finely pressed and made to perfection to fit his slim body.
you’ll be wearing all black.” I tried to reason with him, patting his knee over his jeans. I thought that would be safe. “Besides, if it gets too hard on you, you can always keep looking at me or at Blaise and Lovegood. It won’t look weird at all.”
Harry didn't realise he had moved. In seconds, he was holding Dracy by the wrist, pulling him hard away from the baby, the berries falling to the floor with the sudden movement.
“I lost a brother, Malfoy,” Weasley said, his broken voice making me look back at him. His eyes were wet, but his face… It was the face of someone who had hardened his heart over the years. “I almost lost my father before that. Harry’s lost his entire family. Hermione spent months looking for her parents. But let me tell you this, and listen well, because I’m only saying it once: you didn’t kill them. You didn’t raise your wand and killed them.”
He moved me to the stage, never ever taking his eyes from me, and nothing else in the world mattered.
But all the kind words, though, weren’t any kind of help at the moment. Draco kept looking around, the snow on the winter side falling thick and deep, more and more flowers and fruits sprouted and bloomed. Even some small crabs were appearing from the summer side.
I’ve heard a lot about the long cold war between the South and North-eastern kingdoms. It was a war started by the South Kingdom – my home and pride, although I could see where we’ve been in the wrong. Being in an eternal winter, the South kingdom lacked a lot, and so they tried hard to manipulate and steal the other kingdoms. Our first King, Salazar Slytherin, had a lot of success. Soon enough we were owners of the Central and North kingdoms. The Northeast was never a problem. Godric Gryffindor was much more concerned with his own people.
“Well, it happened before. Remember that time when I made a stool follow me around while barking? I was kind of thinking I’d love to have a dog because my flat is just… Way too silent. It stopped following me when I got Bubbles.” Draco said. Bubbles was his dog, a white and black Shihtzu. The small dog was bat-shit crazy, but Draco adored the thing. Harry had to admit he adored Bubbles, too. “And when you got into my office yesterday…”
he said he knew where one of the states were,” I concluded, and both my friends looked surprised at me. “So… I was thinking, since we’re going to have some free time after the holidays before we come back to school… If we could go look for it. And, since Malfoy knows where the place is…”
,” Harry whispered against Draco’s ear, biting his earlobe gently. He lowered his mouth, kissing his neck, biting it and licking the spot, making Draco shiver and moan. “Shhh… Someone will hear us…”
“Mama! Aaaaaah!” The girl opened her mouth, receiving a piece of banana as a prize and chewing happily, clapping.
– in front of Harry Bloody Potter, because the git actually accepted me as his friend and was willing to trust me.
Harry always found beautiful the way Draco would change his face completely when he meant business. Draco was so good at his job because he absolutely
I'm sorry I took so long! I'm trying to write an original book at the same time I'm writing this story. I hope you can all understand.
“We need to get the salt out of your body.” Harry said. He didn't know if they needed to, but he knew Dracy must be sore and bruised. “You... Can you heal yourself down there?”
“I like your smell,” Draco mumbled against his shoulder, and Harry had to close his eyes and breathe deeply so he wouldn’t do something he would regret later. Like kissing the hell out of Draco.
“Over the hills and far away, by Gary Moore. It’s a rock classic, with a bit of folk in it. Seamus loves Gary Moore, he's been singing that song every single day for the last 7 years since I’ve known him. I guess that’s why it was the first song in Harry’s mind. We share a dorm, you know?”
That party lasted for two years. At least it was how I felt throughout it, although it must’ve taken a few hours at most. Soon, my maid came at me, saying that I had to prepare for my consummation night. I followed Pansy out of the palace, because of course I still had to travel all the way to the Solar Castle.
My presentation only happened in sixth year, and I thought it was mainly due the whole Voldemort thing. Me and Ginny tried to have a relationship then, but it didn’t work out. We weren’t true mates, and although a relationship worked just fine without us being mates, I didn’t have the strength to work on it as I should, and eventually we decided it was better if we were just friends.
Harry couldn’t help but moan, his cock now fully hard. He grabbed Draco by his waist and closed the distance between them, kissing Draco full on his lips. Draco rocked his hips against Harry’s cock, hugging the Gryffindor by his shoulders and giving all of himself in that kiss. He kissed Harry’s neck, going down to his shoulder and grabbing the hem of Harry’s tank top, removing it.
being changed. Little rascal spit pumpkin juice all over himself,” Harry heard Draco’s voice, who was coming into the room with their smallest toddler, eighteen months old Castor, perched on his hip. His husband was beautiful in his light grey robes that couldn’t hide his cute baby bump. They were hoping for a girl, just one,
what the bloke was doing and we teased him mercilessly. I just didn’t want to be the target of the teasing, at least, not now. They would keep nagging me about having a crush, and I couldn’t tell them it was Malfoy, now could I? Just because he smelt like a wet dream on a stick it didn’t mean he wasn’t a git anymore.
“I’m hungry, okay?!” Draco said after swallowing another mouthful. “And it’s delicious, especially with honey on top.”
Draco turned, getting dressed, and Harry couldn’t stop looking at his back, how soft his skin looked, and the healthy weight he had put on last year. His arse was round and perfect, and Harry licked his lips, trying not to look at him. Fuck, he couldn’t just get the hots for Draco Malfoy, he was supposed to protect him! He pressed his cock down, trying to calm himself, and rummaged through his backpack to look at the subjects they had to study that they.
“Would you rather not come at all?” Draco asked, and Harry held him by his hips, moving him around and pressing him against the other wall, chest against stone.
Anyway, they were living relatively well that month. They talked about how the garden was going, what new projects they were both working on, how many meters of thread Draco thought he had managed to do, among other things.
Harry and Draco loved pictures. That was why every year they had a beginning-of-the-year picture. This one was happening in February, and once again, Harry had forgotten how really chaotic these days were. Not because they weren’t used to it. They had been married for nine years, and had taken a family picture every year since their marriage. No, it wasn’t that. It’s just that Harry had forgotten the challenge of holding down a toddler.
. Yes, I was scared and didn’t want to make it official just now, but I still wanted to be near him, know each other a bit more, get used to him in a different way than I was.
“Fuck, you’re taking me whole, Draco… Yes, take it… Take everything…” Harry moaned, leaving his body almost all the way out and thrusting it all the way in, his skin slapping against Draco.
low in his throat, taking off his pants and showing how hard his cock was. Harry was thick and long, and Draco loved to suck hard on him, but Harry had that type of gleam in his eyes that showed he was a predator seeing his prey.
“I got lost. My equipment stopped working and when I saw the island and you two on the beach... I thought you could help me or go with me.” He said, rubbing his face. “
“Yeah… So good…” Draco mumbled, but he opened his legs, needing Harry inside him. “Please, Harry… I want you…”
“They are... bonded,” Ron muttered, looking even more confused. “How... How can it be? I mean... How do you bond while you’re missing? I didn't even... I didn't even know Harry was…”
“It isn’t bad to ask,” Harry stated. Draco still decided to stay ten to 15 minutes with his bum raised just in case.
He positioned himself behind me and used my own slick to wet his cock. He touched the spongy head on my hole, and pressed in. By body needed him so desperately that it opened up easily. He was still was too big for me, and I felt my body struggling to hold him completely. It looked like he was pressing in for an eternity until he stopped.
“I tried to explain to them, but... They don't believe me. And I can't talk about the tapestry without revealing the location of Harry's home,” Ron rubbed his hands over his face, frustrated. He was bound by magic not to talk about Black’s house. “Do you want to go there with me? Just so we can make sure they're still okay?”
They went to the kitchen, and Harry turned on the burner of the stove again, a big pot over it. He took off the lid, peering inside and using a ladle to mix the stew inside, probably gone stone cold by now.
, I wanted to get pregnant so badly. When I was around 13, I would stuff my gowns with pillows and observe myself in the mirror, dreaming about my babies and how would I name them and take care of them. I still had my baby dolls safely kept in my trunks, and of course I’d use it to decorate my new rooms.
to be friends,” Harry said, and Draco smiled, finding Harry’s hand under the blankets and holding it.
“How come even my fucking botched spell likes you, Potter?!” Draco complained, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh. He grabbed a few pieces of the dry paper that had fallen on the floor and transfigured them into a towel. His spellwork was a bit scratchy since he was no Hermione, but the towel was dry and warm. He walked to Draco, placing the towel around his friend and slowly dried his hair.
“If… If that’s okay? I understand they might not want me there. And…” I swallowed hard. I thought maybe I could do it in a better opportunity but now was a good time as it would ever be. “I want to say… I’m really sorry Weasley and Granger… For… What happened early this year. I know my words would never pay for what I did, but I want you to know that… That I’m really sorry about everything.”
Neither Harry nor Draco wanted to see the wreck of the boat, and Harry rested his chin on Draco's head when he hugged him. Harry opened his eyes a few seconds later, seeing boxes and debris floating, being carried by the waves. IAnd the man.
“It’s okay to be nervous. I get nervous too. But remember you’re not the most important person in the play: Lovegood and Blaise are. People will mostly be looking at them, especially because they will be dancing and it’s going to be emotional. Me and you are there to complement them.
“I... I speak English.” The man said with a strong accent, that Harry couldn’t identify from where. It sounded slightly as if the man's native language was from a Latin branch. “What happened here?”
“Your cock is beautiful,” Harry said, kissing the base where his cock met his balls, and Draco opened his legs even more.
“It's difficult, but I can try.” Harry teased, and Dracy couldn't resist the laugh that came to her lips. “What do you want to talk about?”
was going to put you on check, and it didn’t. I’d expect this type of attitude from Mr Weasley, maybe, but from you…”
“No-no-no, wait, Potter!” I raised my hand so he would stop talking. “I was just a bit surprised. You talked to me as if I were… your friend.”
Together, Harry and Lucy opened the boxes that Roberto had left there. Two of them were medicine boxes, apparently they had just been produced and were in transit to their destination, wherever that was. Harry checked the medicine boxes, looking at the expiration dates and knowing that each box was sealed, still with the label inside. With Lucy expecting a baby, that was more than providential. It seemed like a divine sign, and Roberto was an angel who brought them protection.
“We should keep practicing, Mr Elk. You can’t pull off a decent Sinatra yet, and you won’t be embarrassing me at the play.” I came back to the Victrola, putting the song from the start. We weren’t going to sing it every time, we had to save our voices for the show, but we still needed to practice. We were both in the choir training room, and Flitwick had given us access on Wednesdays to train. Or better yet, for me to train Potter, because although he could sing the song perfectly, he was terrible on the stage.
Dracy was upset that he had not seen the first time Talitha had done magic, but it was no problem. Talitha, perhaps because she was in an environment where magic flowed without wands, albeit in a limited way, learned to imitate her parents. Soon she was floating her doll to herself, or throwing away things she didn't want to eat.
“Oh, Merlin, she’s beautiful!” Hermione said, coming closer and taking another picture of Draco looking up at her with the baby. “But… Don’t get me wrong, Susannah is a beautiful name. But I thought you were going to name her after a flower?”
Having made sure that no caterpillar was around anymore, Draco began to help Harry more actively in the process of building a shelter. Harry looked for long branches, vines, soft pieces of bark, anything that could help them have a safer place to shelter. For now they could drink coconut water and eat the meat inside, but if they were very hungry, Harry believed that the small portions of saltwater in the bay might contain some fish that could be fried in a fire. But he would check that later. They needed to build the shelter and they needed it fast.
“I… I love you, too. I’ve loved you for so long… But I was afraid to tell you because I didn’t want to lose your friendship…”
“Let’s have another one just to be sure,” Harry suggested, and Draco spelled Cygnus’ robes clean, although the boy didn’t want anything to do with the pictures anymore.
Harry smiled, thinking about why cuddling with Draco under a blanket made the Winter go away. Maybe, he just needed a hug. Once they started putting the blankets and pillows away, Harry had to bite his tongue so he wouldn’t say something he shouldn’t.
“Well… I guess we eat your stew, and just… You know… Talk. We’re lucky we found each other… But it doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy. We’re virtually strangers.”
We hadn’t talk much since I started the choir, but I felt like our relationship was less strained. I talked to them about the choir and Malfoy being in it, and how we had agreed that we wouldn’t acknowledge each other.
Draco looked at him in the dark, and smiled, trying not to cry. He was still a bit emotional after all.
“How many days will you be without food and water?” Harry turned, seeing Malfoy hugging himself, looking uncertain.
“All of the families who had any ties with Muggles or Half-bloods were immediately excluded.” Hermione repeated, maybe for herself, and she was looking at Ron like she’d never met him before. Sometimes, it surprised me a little how he could be knowledgeable about certain things me and Hermione were blind about.
“Make love to me, Harry,” Draco asked, looking up to him. “I’m not going to take those potions anymore. I’m tired. I just want to feel you now. Please, take care of me.”
“We have a baby sister. It means we’ll have to be very good brothers to her,” Sirius said solemnly, and looked back at Ron, who was sideways smiling at the boy.
“Well, I suppose there’s no simple way to say it,” she said as they walked together. “It’s Mr Malfoy.”
“Draco, you’ll be sitting in the middle with Harry as usual, I suppose?” Mark the photographer asked, and Draco nodded, trying not to show he was nervous. Sirius had a weird, coy smile on his face, which meant the bucket likely wasn’t the only trap.
From what he could see, there was nothing there but fish, birds, and the occasional bugs. There were no signs of trails or usage of humans in the forest. His auror-trained gaze looked for signs, anything that indicated they weren’t alone, but there seemed to be nothing. He looked to the right, watching the coast. The beach curved inward from his vision, indicating that it wasn’t continuous, and the same on the other side. In the dark, he couldn't see exactly, but his memory helped him. The next day, he first had to look for their food of the day. Then explore the island in search of other people or help. He would need Malfoy's help with this, but he didn't know exactly how to convince him. The day had been tiring enough for the Unspeakable, and even though Malfoy hadn't talked about it, probably out of pride, Harry saw the Slytherin's hands were red with sore calluses.
They spent a good amount of time out in the field, talking to friends and in general being happy with a good game. Harry dragged Draco to the Gryffindor party, and they didn’t even care that there was an intruder in the Gryffindor common room. They got so used to Draco beside Harry by now that they didn’t question it.
“Can’t I just sing from the side? I’ll be narrating so it makes sense I just get to be in the shadows,” Potter tried to reason, and I took of the needle from the disc, looking back at him.
Now he could feel the heat and moisture in his body. There was sand in his mouth, he was sure, and Harry could hear the distinct sound of a seagull, just as the waves came and went.
“You know about the Sacred 28, right?” Ron asked, and Hermione nodded. “All pureblood families were once part of it. The Prewetts, the Longbottoms, the Potters, the Weasleys. After the first war, some of the families were considered Blood Traitors, like my family. We were excluded of it because we didn’t follow the moral standards of the Sacred community. The Weasleys and the Prewetts were, of course, poor, but it wasn’t such a big deal. The real deal was that we protected Muggles, Muggle-borns and half-bloods. The same thing with the Longbottoms. In the Potters’ case, Harry’s dad married a Muggle-born. So you can imagine, right?”
I could see everybody in the seats with their attention glued to Zabini’s song, and the omegas melting listening to his voice. I felt good, singing my parts, supporting his solo, and even more when Luna sang the counterpart solo.
“Why don’t you want to be there? It’s the last song, it’s the moment where the Sun ‘flies to the moon’ and they finally get together. You singing from the shadows is a bit anticlimactic, don’t you think?” I walked closer to Potter, and he sat on the floor, his knees up and his arms resting on top of them. It looked relaxed, but somehow I could see the tension.
“You were towing my car while half-blind?” It was the first thing that came through Draco’s mouth, like an ungrateful whiny little brat, but the handsome man in front of him simply laughed.
Harry caught it, just by luck, his and Draco’s hand side by side. The little stupid thing flew in his direction and he got it half the way in. Gryffindor won by thirty points.
Yeah, I knew. Ron was being Mr Perfect together with Hermione. I felt like there was a canyon between our friendships these days. Since I broke up with Ginny, I was feeling more and more miserable every time I saw Ron and Hermione together, and I knew it didn’t make sense. They were my friends and we’ve been through hell beside each other. I should’ve been more supportive of them, but I just felt bad about myself.
“Ursa!” Draco was slightly shocked, but it only made Ursa and Leo giggle even louder, running from the living room and up the stairs.
This chapter is smaller than the other ones, but it's needed for the transition of the situations in which they are. I hope you all like it.
“Yeah, that would be a dick move,” Ron said. “Besides, Malfoy helped me at potions a few weeks ago and he wasn’t being mean so…”
Draco started to strip, first his shoes and socks, then his trousers, showing off his long and slightly rounded legs. When he was completely naked in front of Harry, he spread his legs, showing how wet he already was.
Harry didn't comment, just looked at Draco, who raised his eyebrows as if to say 'just play along with me'. Harry supposed that, with his breasts growing bigger and bigger, and his belly quite obvious from his pregnancy, that Muggle couldn't just accept that Draco was a man who happened to be pregnant. Harry nodded, taking a deep breath.
Dracy turned to Talitha, placing a piece of banana in her mouth. Dracy had a surprised expression, his mouth open and his eyes wide.
if he says something derogatory to any of us, I’m punching him in the face.” Ron said, and something burst inside of me.
. He knew Draco wouldn’t just say those things to be in his good favour, and he couldn’t help the heat on his cheeks.
“Daddy?” He heard Saturn’s voice from the door, and turned to his big boy. Saturn still wore the necklace his mother had given to him, and looked up at Harry with his big, blue eyes. “Are the babies okay?”
Thinking about it, Harry got up and went into the little cabin, lying in the space that fit him on the other side of the little shelter. There was about a foot between them, but Harry didn't even think about it. Within seconds, he was already in the dream world.
Not all students came back, though. Some parents felt safer transferring their kids to other schools around the world, and others acquired permission from the Ministry to homeschool them.
“Fuck… That was amazing… If I knew you had that weapon between your legs, I would have acted sooner.” Draco said, and Harry laughed, his body still sensitive from his orgasm. Draco looked up at him, kissing his lips and running his hands through Harry’s long hair. “Be my boyfriend.”
Harry was so hard that he thought his cock would explode at any second. With one hand, he stroked one of Dracy's breasts, squeezing it with his hand and pinching the nipple with his forefinger and thumb. With his mouth, he sucked the other hard nipple, surrounding it with his tongue, sucking hard and reveling in the hot liquid that filled his mouth whenever he sucked on it.
After our dance, we came back to the thrones, my body ready to explode. He sat beside me and bent his body slightly – as far as his armour would allow – and I reached slowly so his mouth was close to my ear.
Harry supposed that Draco was already in his second month of pregnancy, due to the symptoms he had. There was no change in the size of his belly, but Draco always looked tired, with dark circles under his eyes and his small breasts were terribly sensitive. Harry had become accustomed to sleeping with his hand on one of them, but in the last week, after discovering the pregnancy, Draco always removed his hand at night, due to the sensitivity.
“Peeves. And I’d rather not listen to his taunts tomorrow morning when the whole school can hear us.”
He held the sweetest smile in the world, and it reached his eyes. I could hear people clapping, but I couldn’t stop looking at him. I wanted to kiss him, claim him, make him mine. My heart was triple its size, and I just wanted my mate, forever.
Harry turned in the direction Draco was looking at, and even with his poor vision, the boat was so close to the island that Harry could see its contours perfectly.
I wasn’t nervous. Okay, I was a bit nervous about the consummation of the marriage part. I, just like the rest of my people, was on the short side. But then I was short
“Our story begin, many, many ages ago. When the world was just starting, and the Earth was just a baby, with it came the Moon. She immediately caught the attention of the Lord of our small Galaxy, and the Sun reached for her, making her shine every time he looked at her. Yet, they could never be together, for she turned her face to him after every day, and she walked hand in hand with Earth, her friend, hiding herself, and yet wishing for the Sun, as much as he wished for her.”
“Dracy?” Harry called, and the blonde looked up, pulling the baby to his chest and out of the water. Harry dried them both and clothed them, wrapping the baby in a clean, dry cloth. They went up to the cabin, and Harry laid Dracy on the bed, taking all the care in the world with the baby. “Do you want to put her in the cot that...?”
They soon got bored and their conversation moved to other places, like Harry’s missions – he was currently out of any because he asked to be assigned to Draco’s spell damage fix. As they talked, Draco started plucking some flowers, making a crown out of them. Harry couldn’t stop looking at his hands, his fingers were long, almost bony, but so beautiful. He loved Draco’s hands, and he longed to hold them all the time.
It was a long 20 minutes, the longest since Harry entered the battle against Voldemort himself. When Harry felt the baby's head at his fingertips, he helped as he could while Dracy pushed. As soon as the head came out, Harry helped pull the rest of the baby's body out of the water. His hands were shaking, and he didn't realise he was crying, even when the baby screamed loudly, their little lungs showing that they were perfect.
“Thinking about getting another one of these?” Harry teased, and Draco chuckled, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“Not fat. Hot as fuck,” Harry mumbled against his skin, and Draco closed his eyes. He felt adored every time Harry touched him, and this time wasn’t different. But Leo and Ursa were very awake, and Scorpie was near waking up too.
They came back home with a booklet of recommendations, a bottle of the hormones Draco should be taking and a ‘good luck’ from the healer.
“I-I’m not sure I can do it, Sir.” I was honest. Yes, I knew the lyrics of the song, but I was used to sing the ending of the chorus when the bass line was needed. Besides, it meant going up there and singing in the spot line together with Malfoy.
Potter looked like he was about to barf for the whole thing. He was trembling so much it looked like he was freezing cold, but he did everything perfectly for the whole rehearsal, following my steps in his solo, even swaying and doing jazz hands with a smile when the time was necessary. Also, he looked so good in a suit I could’ve eaten him on the stage.
“This isn’t a confession, Malfoy, this is a statement.” Harry laughed, and Draco punched him in the shoulder, which made Harry scream in the middle of the laugh.
“Do you want to eat with me? At my table?” He asked, and I felt my face burn. He was actually trying to be seen with me? Confessing our feelings in the empty choir room was one thing. Sitting with him at his table… it was a much bigger thing.
I’ve always thought I knew Harry Potter more than anyone else. I’ve always been obsessed with him, even before we met at eleven in Madame Malkins. He was always greater and more magical. Maybe the hatred I felt was also part of the feeling that I didn’t know him at all; that everything I created in my head was so different from the reality.
Pushing him back, Draco pressed Harry against the wall, and in one swift move, he kneeled in front of Harry, opening his jeans and unzipping it. He lowered Harry’s pants just so his cock was free, hard and angry red at the head. Harry looked down at Draco, heavy-lidded eyes, and held tenderly on his head.
“I’d lick you from head to toe,” Harry mumbled against his ear, and soon they were ready to go at it again.
“It wasn’t you, Harry,” Draco opened his eyes, looking at him, his tears falling down his cheeks. “I’m worried if I don’t do my job properly, I’ll go to Azkaban. I spent a week there. I don’t want to see that place anymore. Harry… I thought I didn’t have a soul anymore.”
“I’m Draco Malfoy. I’m also eighteen and I would like to be a healer. I used to want to be a Potioneer but not anymore. Pleasure to meet you, too.”
“Harry, Draco, it’s been impossible to take this picture today!” Mark complained, his own armpits sweaty with all the action. “Look, baby Castor is chewing on a toy, and Cygnus can’t even look at the cam--”
With the raft ready, they braced themselves, pushing the raft over the water, each carrying a makeshift oar.
“I think we need a prize after all the effort to make our new home.” Draco murmured, kissing him again and pulling him into the room.
And try they did. They had sex every other day, and every day when they knew Draco was more fertile. They read every book they could read on the subject. They considered themselves specialists on pregnancy now, even pointing out what could be going wrong or what they were doing right.
“Ginny will kill you if you teach Sirius to do the same to baby Sue as you did to her,” Hermione said, but the whole thing was lighthearted and amazing.
By the time they started working on Spring, half of Draco’s office was full of flowers. They smelt amazing, and Harry almost felt sorry for getting rid of it. They decided that the flower may have something related to Draco’s mother, who was currently living in France, so they tried a couple of things related to her.
Harry didn’t take much time to grab his own mug. He sat beside Draco and cuddled between the blankets with him. They sipped their cocoa for a moment before Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“We’re sleeping together. You can rearrange this bedroom to your likings, but I won’t be sleeping away from my husband. Unless you didn’t like our coupling? Because I sure as Merlin loved it.”
On that particular day, they were picking fruit for Talitha's birthday. She was finally turning one, and considering that the circumstances of her birth were not the best, Dracy and Harry decided that she should have a special day. They could not make a cake, as they would have done two years ago if they had been in their normal lives, but they would choose her favorite fruits and sing on her special day.
“The whole fucking night. You smell amazing,” he said, and my cheeks burned with pride. I smiled too, baring my neck to him.
“Well… Two reasons. I quite like you,” Draco said, pecking Harry’s lips once, “and… fuck if I’m ever letting that cock of yours go.”
“As soon as we take the picture, you can take it off,” Draco offered, putting Castor into Harry’s arms and proceeding to take care of the other boys’ hair and clothes. It didn’t take long for the photographer to arrive, but at this point, the kids were bored and united in hatred of their clothes. It seemed like if the robes were scratching Aries, suddenly all the other robes were also scratchy, and the kids couldn’t stop whining about it every five seconds.
“What kind of shifter are you, after all? You look like you’re balancing yourself in tiny feet because you can barely hold yourself together,” I asked, although I couldn’t muster to put all the sarcasm in my voice. Potter was sweaty from head to toes with the little practice we had, and he looked utterly miserable. Not even I was comfortable with seeing him like that, especially after the git had saved me.
Harry's head ached as if he was hungover. The feeling was the same, from the incessant throbbing to the sickness. However, he knew this was due to a faulty portkey, not a drunken night. He was trying to situate himself by remembering what happened that day.
Harry stood up, looking around. He went to one of the natural pools and looked inside. There were a few small fish, smaller than the palm of his hand, but they had to work with that at least for tonight. In the morning, Harry would look for something else. He returned to the blond, seriously.
“Well, I hope you are comfortable then,” Harry rolled his eyes, continuing walking towards the coconut trees.
It was September of 1999. Harry had his eighteenth birthday not long ago, but for whatever reason, he felt like he was eleven again, crossing the borders of Hogwarts for the first time after the War. He had gained weight after May of 1998, and he was taller and his muscles were showing. He was finally giving up his skinny and bony self to a more substantial build.
They talked and talked and talked. About their friends and about their favourite tv shows, films and books. Harry spent at least half an hour trying to convince Draco to watch
“Then why are you asking? We’re not going anywhere, Harry. Besides, we are all going to be at The Burrow for Boxing day, are we not?” Ron said, and I nodded, because that was the plan.
triggers: Attemped murder of a baby (doesn't happen and it's not gruesome, nor anyone is hurt. Everybody is just fine.
Draco's hand flew to his belly, and for the first time, Draco seemed to realise he was already showing. He nodded, and Roberto and Harry started carrying the boxes towards the cabin. It wasn't as heavy as Harry imagined, but due to the fact that Draco couldn't help, they made more than one trip. Draco was in charge of taking the sea grapes to clean and remove the parts of the seaweed that didn't taste so good.
I was waiting for the first kiss that often came after the ceremony, but it didn’t happen. It looked like, different from Slytherin, all the loving in the first night was between the Omega and the Alpha only.
“Lucy... It's my feminine side, but exactly the same thing happens when I'm Draco... There's something left out, excluded...
Their official game was to happen before Christmas, and the whole damn school was there. Gryffindor versus Slytherin, a classic. Harry and Draco were smiling when they shook hands in the middle of the field. The game was like thunder and lightning, and Harry felt alive playing against Draco again. His hair on the wind, the cold against his body, the raw, untamed thrill of chasing the snitch.
He growled at my words, ripping off his clothing and getting naked before I could even move from where I was. He held me by my waist, his big hands holding me as if I were a doll, and I had to hug him with my arms and legs so I wouldn’t fall. He sucked on my neck,
Draco was so used to this routine that he even had a small conversation with Hermione about how Castor liked his milk, even though he would grunt and bite his own lips when a contraction hit.
I and the rest of the choir were sitting in the chairs designed for us, separated by voice range. I sat behind the
And I did, my hands trembling when I held the paper with the lyrics, following Melinda’s cue when I started.
“Me neither. I wasn't really thinking about that possibility, but... But it is possible that it’s a real one.” Draco sighed, turning on his back and watching Harry. Draco raised one of his hands, digging his fingers into the beard that covered Harry’s face. “If I'm pregnant... We are... Condemning an innocent life to our destiny.”
“Draco,” Harry moaned, kissing along his jaw and up to his earlobe, biting it softly. “Fuck, I want you so fucking bad.”
“I’m trying! We keep moving around!” I laughed, and it felt good. It felt good that I was actually talking again properly with my friends, and over Malfoy, of all people. The git was helping me in more ways than one, and I couldn’t help but wish he was here with us. “So, I was talking to Malfoy one day when we were training, and he asked me why I haven’t claimed the Potter Estates.”
After a few minutes of throwing leaves and coconuts at the coconut tree's foot, Harry had picked up a rhythm.
But maybe Harry shouldn't have taken his eyes off the water. Maybe he shouldn't have admired the palm trees and woods glistening in the distance, along with the blue water in the sun. Because when he thought the greatest adventure of his life would begin, he felt a wave hit the raft so hard that it rose from the side where Malfoy was, causing it to fall into the water milliseconds before Harry fell as well.
changed. And I’m willing to try and be his friend. I would be really happy if you guys can do it, too.”
I sat beside him, crossing my legs and looking at Potter from the side. I couldn’t help but think how handsome he was, with his jet black hair, long black lashes, tanned skin, full lips. I controlled the urge to touch him, because I knew once I did, I was going to be miserable. My heats were already bad enough, and for the past month, the one I had after scenting Potter was crazy. I could only think about him. Of course nobody teased me for using spells on my bed. I was the only omega in my dorm, and it wasn’t all that weird that I closed the curtains and silenced myself once a month, I’ve done this before. I was just glad they didn’t hear me chanting Potter’s name while I fingered myself.
“Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to fix it season by season so we don’t get overwhelmed. What do you think it’s the worse one?”
“But they can't! Not while Harry and Draco are alive!” Hermione exclaimed, closing the book abruptly and looking at Ron with shining eyes. Hugo's eyes widened with the outburst, but he didn't move much. Hermione no longer cried every day, but the pain continued. Not only her best friend, but a very close to her coworker, had disappeared. Hermione and Malfoy were not necessarily friends, but the Unspeakable worked on many projects with her at the Ministry. Hermione was still on maternity leave, and Ron thanked Merlin for it, as it was possible that she, too, would be missing if she was still working at the time the attack happened.
Malfoy hugged Luna as well, and she whispered things in his ear. Things Harry didn’t hear, and still was a bit curious about it. Malfoy looked even skinnier, paler, his eyes lacking life. He didn’t look up to Harry, he didn’t manage even to talk to him. Malfoy whispered in Luna’s ear, and Luna looked back to Harry.
It was a fair enough agreement, and they settled it with their right hands. Although not much older than me, King Harry looked like a brute. I haven’t seen him closely – of course not. I was the most precious jewellery of my kingdom, I had to be protected at all costs. But I’ve managed to ran away from my maid, Pansy, and spied him through a gap on the Throne room door. He was huge, much bigger and stronger than my father was, although both were alphas. It looked like the genes of the North-easterns ran thicker.
Harry was also noticing how much he observed Draco. His hair, his eyes, his soft skin – because, obviously, Draco acted like he
“No talking, Harry, I’m thinking!” Draco said, turning and walking fast to his office. Harry sighed, but followed him to the office.
“My name is Lucy.” He said, and Harry frowned. “My husband and I went out sailing and... All I remember after hitting the island is the salty taste of water and sand in my body. Unfortunately, there is no way out of here.”
He was surprised when Slughorn asked Draco to be the leader of the Slytherin team. He was there when Draco was asked, and he could see how happy, but scared, Draco was. Harry knew how Quidditch was important to Draco, and he nodded slightly, encouraging Draco to accept.
Harry brightened up, his grin white and cheeky. He pulled me to Gryffindor table, finding his friends who had – surprisingly – left a space for me. Potter sat me beside Granger, and sat on my other side, with Weasley in front of me.
“I’ll teach you everything you need to know about taking care of your younger and only sister,” the man said, and Hermione chuckled.
They weren't far from the edge, and Harry kind of swam, kind of dragged himself and kind of was dragged there. He and Malfoy fell onto the sand, near the water, but far enough away that it wouldn't reach the top part of their bodies.
After they defeated all the seasons except summer, they decided to put Draco’s things back into his office. It was quick since they could do it with their wands, but Harry felt a bit bad for being by himself on his office again.
“To singing Max’s solo, you stupid troll,” Malfoy’s countryside posh accent got even stronger now, and I wanted to… Well, mostly, pin him against a damn wall and kiss him senseless, but maybe give him a spanking before that. Flitwick said 'language, Mr Malfoy!' before I replied.
Harry took off his cloak, tossing it to the side of the rock where the blond was sitting, and grabbed a knife that he kept strapped to his thigh, next to where his wand should have been. He threw sand over his cloak so it wouldn't fly and started walking towards some coconut trees at the entrance to the forest.
When they were all around the fire - that Harry had to create manually - , with the fish roasting and the seaweed washed, Roberto looked around, staring at the hut they had made.
Harry realised that some had a shorter shelf life, and others were potentially dangerous because they had a black label on the box. Those, Harry would throw away. It was unlikely that they would need those drugs (except for one, for severe pain), and in an unstable emotional state that Lucy was in, Harry didn't want to take any chances. He would throw them out when Lucy wasn't looking.
Harry had lost it. And Mark did take the picture, even if he wasn’t smiling, even if Castor had a toy in his mouth, even if Cygnus was looking up at him after his burst of anger. Mark took the picture, and after that, Draco touched his hand, smiling at him as if to say
Each day was a new discovery. At four months, Talitha's teeth started to come out, which made both parents go crazy trying to relieve the pain that her battered gums caused - in addition to the pain that Dracy now felt with the bites on his nipples when breastfeeding.
“Papa’s tired, mate. He really needs to sleep today. Maybe for a few days he’ll be tired. Having babies is hard work and he was really strong today, but now he’s very sleepy.”
He talked to Melinda for a couple of seconds and nodded to Flitwick. He waited for her clue as she started playing a song I didn’t know, and the sound that flew out his mouth was absolutely…
This chapter might be a bit difficult to read, but there's NO cliffhangers. Everything ends up fine. Look at the ending notes to see any triggers.
My eyes were painted with a bit of white on the lids, so they looked a bit more delicate and ethereal, and on my lips was dabbed a bit of pinkish tincture.
I breathed in her motherly, omega scent, and soon I was called to sit beside my husband in the twin thrones. He didn’t say anything for a long time, just observing the people around him. After a while, he looked down at me – because, at his size, it was impossible not to look down at me – and side-smiled.
Younger me would’ve thought Harry would do anything to be the centre of attention. That he would be jumping and screaming for getting the main role in our play. However, after seeing him pale as a ghost, looking like he was about to cry when it was his turn… It made me realise he
If there was something that the Malfoy-Potter household loved, it was photographs. There were albums and albums of those, frames on the walls and over the hearth, small photographs in wallets and books.
Harry to see him. He even stopped putting on his pants inside the bathroom, walking into their shared bedroom in the nude. Harry always looked away, but it was difficult doing so, especially when he started having wet dreams starred by Draco and his amazing bubble butt.
And talk they did. They talked about their life, what they did, what made them happy. Harry had his business figured out and he’d only have to visit the industries once or twice in two weeks. He always analysed how everything was going by the computer, but he had a lot of free time to live exactly as he pleased. He had his house and he helped people around the small town where he lived. During wintertime, like this, he’d help people clean the streets, but the snow was sudden and no one expected it to be so thick.
Dracy looked down at the girl between them, who already had her eyes closed, even though her hand hadn't loosened from Dracy's blond strands.
“You're getting hotter every day…” Draco murmured in his lover's ear, and Harry brought his hands up to Draco's arse, squeezing hard and making the other moan.
“We should dance the first dance,” he stated, and I nodded, standing after him and taking the hand he offered me. My hand looked pale and fragile between his long, callous fingers. The crowd parted for us and, before I knew it, we were rolling around the ballroom in a soft dance. He was so big and hot, his hand capable of crushing my soft body easily, but he carried me with lightness, as if he was afraid of breaking my bones. The top of my head reached the middle of his broad chest, and I
“Well, if we have to try harder to put a baby in your belly, I’m not going to complain. I love hard work.” Harry said, and Draco had to smile at that before letting Harry kiss him into oblivion.
“It’s just… I’m not comfortable being naked in front of people,” Harry said. Maybe the booze gave him a bit more courage.
“So… You’re taking people back to the team?” Goyle asked, and just like that, Harry knew they would have to include a bit of Goyle in their meetings.
At eight months, Talitha learned how to sit by herself, and that made their lives a little easier, as they could leave Talitha sitting under the hut on top of blankets with her doll, which Dracy had made with cotton. She had brown cotton eyes - a variety that Dracy had found lost among his new cotton plantation - and also a dress made from the same fabric, but it had no complex shape and was a little crooked. Talitha didn't care much, and she always bit her doll's legs while watching her parents cook or sew, Dracy often sitting next to her, or helping Harry to pick things up in the distance.
It didn't take long. There was another clearing farther into the forest, with some trees and shrubs. They collected oranges there, but kept away from the small bushes with red berries. Draco - no,
Draco closed his eyes, murmuring a charm Harry didn’t know, then moaning when something happened, although Harry couldn’t see.
I was humming my solo while I packed my backpack after the rehearsal when Potter approached me. He still looked nervous, although we weren’t practicing anymore, and he didn’t look me in the eye. Ha, too much for Gryffindor bravery, hn?
They could barely sleep so much that they were anxious. They lay in the shelter, side by side, staring at the leafy ceiling.
But he did, and pressed two of his fingers into Draco’s hole, preparing him as best as he could with his tipsy mind. When Draco complained about it being ‘too slow’, Harry started to practically fuck him with his fingers, scissoring them and biting onto Draco’s shoulder. He couldn’t wait anymore, though, and neither could Draco.
“Come on, Cy! Look at the camera! Look, Uncle Mark is going to give us chocolate after the picture! It will be fun, Cy!”
“Did you have anything that related you to daddy, papa?” Ursa asked, still curious about this part of the story, which Draco had never told them before.
“How… How did your characters react when they find their soulmates? Because I’m not sure of how to go on for now…” Harry confessed, and Draco smiled.
Draco tried to make himself small, lowering his head and pressing himself against Harry’s back. Harry ran his hands through his long hair, putting it up in a bun while trying to control himself not to punch Eaton in the face.
Before Harry could retaliate, Draco screamed, falling backwards. He was supporting his back on the tree trunk, and out of nowhere, it seemed to disappear. The leaves and branches were moving into the walls like they were receding, and they looked at it until the only thing left was the proof they had eaten.
“She was hungry,” Dracy whispered, laughter in his voice. Harry was still hard, but he couldn't seem to be angry. Those two people were his world now and nothing could make him not want them there.
“Shhh, Ron! It’s not like that.” Harry looked around and Ginny started to laugh. Harry couldn’t help but smile too. Deciding that they were best as friends instead of lovers had been the best choice of Harry’s life. “He can’t sleep in the Gryffindor tower and I can’t go to the dungeons. It just makes sense.”
“Daddy!” She ran into his arms, and Ron held her tenderly, kissing the almost two year old girl on the cheeks. He turned to the woman, who had a book in her hands and baby Hugo held on her other arm, an anatomical pillow helping her to keep him quiet and comfortable. Ron approached his wife after placing Rose on the floor, kissing her thick hair and sighing.
He walked towards the hut, but didn’t take them into it. He took Dracy into the fresh water of the lake, sitting him on the edge.
“Potter states? You mean, houses and stuff? My family home was destroyed when I was a baby. You know the whole thing. I mean, the whole wizarding world knows what happened. I think I might own the lot, but I’m not sure I’m coming back there.”
“How naughty... Walking around without knickers…” Harry commented, making her moan again. He lifted his fingers, touching her entrance and realising that she was soaking wet. He stroked between her big lips, going up and pressing the base of her tiny cock, then coming back down and sticking two fingers in her at once.
but Harry still didn't feel comfortable doing anything about it, not with Draco sleeping in the room next door.
. Going to the rehearsals every Tuesday and Thursday was torture, especially since Flitwick insisted in the seats to be exactly the same every time we practiced. He said it was meant to help the choir, but it only made me confused about everything.
“Maybe your spell wanted to make us date,” Harry said, and Draco smiled, now really sure of how to proceed. He gave a step back, though, looking up at Harry.
Apparently, the half an hour Christmas show had a nice story line. It was a story about how the Moon fell in love with the Sun, and could never get together because of the distance. Luna was the moon, and it was so incredibly fitting that I didn’t even question it. She was a soprano, and her voice was… Well,
. She sang so prettily that her role was a given. Zabini was the Sun, and it was also fitting. Harry had to admit that the tenor had a beautiful voice that complimented Luna’s, and their appearances were so perfect for the roles they interpreted. He did look like the Sun, his dark skin vibrating with alpha energy, his eyes intense as fire.
They got in, and the room was small but cosy. It had a fireplace, a settee in front of it with a table on the corner along with two chairs. The decoration was sparse but was clearly made with Draco and he in mind. There were Slytherin and Gryffindor flags around the room and green and red pillows on the settee.
“Fuck, Harry! So big…! So-so good…”  Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, and at the same time, he wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, pulling him all the way inside. Draco moaned loud as Harry grunted, and even more when Harry started to move faster, in and out of his tight heat.
“Harry, do you think you’ll be okay with that?” Hermione asked, touching his shoulder. He breathed in, nodding.
Draco supported himself with his hands, looking back and frowning. Why was he laughing? What the hell was funny?
Draco moaned loud, his hips thrusting up, his hands grabbing the bedsheets as pleasure run through his body. Harry bobbed his head up and down, his tongue circling the glans and tasting his pre-come.
“You’re moving in with me?” Harry asked, surprise in his voice. “Aren’t you scared? We met just a couple of hours ago.”
“Well, Mr Potter… I was wondering if you could… Take care of him. Take him under your wing. We understand it is not your responsibility, but it’s very unlikely people will try anything at all if he’s near you. Besides, take it as your first…
“What the bloody...?” Hermione murmured, and Ron frowned too, holding Rose's hand firmly without realizing it, causing the girl to moan 'daddy!' before yanking her hand out of his grip.
was Malfoy’s scent, or that I started having wet dreams about the git. It really wasn’t pleasant to wake up with a ranging knot, and being unable to jerk off because I had four blokes sleeping right next to me. Of course I could’ve used magic to block sounds and avoid them opening my curtains, but we
“Don’t need to say it. It was good for me, too. You’re my bonded mate, after all,” Harry said, touching my still sore and tender bite mark. I smiled, biting my bottom lip.
Harry was feeling the same way. Every now and then, he’d come back and look at them, mesmerised by their little pink noses and chubby cheeks. They’ve decided to wait a day before showing their babies to the pack. They were the lead alpha’s babies, after all, and they needed to be presented to society.
“Hm... Basic healing spells, wound cleaning, simple protection and repelling spells, from muggles, enemies... Ah, and silencing charm,” Draco said proudly, puffing out his chest.
“Are you okay? Do you speak English?” Harry asked, and Draco repeated the same question in French beside him.
Draco looked up at him with shining eyes. Harry thought he was crying, but noticed the smile on his lips.
“That’s what I thought. Definitely mates. But I won’t hold it against you, mate. Not all of us have good taste.” Ron teased, and I tried hard not to chuckle, but my Elk understood now that Ron was just joking, and not really risking the life of our omega.
“We're trapped, Potter. No wands, no returning portkey. We are trapped,” Harry could tell he was already with a red nose and was trying to be serious, but his hands were shaking. “Our only hope is that they send someone after us. Or rather,” Malfoy gave a bland laugh. “after Harry Potter, hn?”
As Luna and Zabini prepared to dance accordingly to Malfoy’s solo, and we all get the papers with the
“It’s okay, my love. We don’t have to try anymore. We’ll find another way to have a baby. It’s okay.”
Mrs Malfoy hugged them both after the trials. She cried when she mumbled ‘I’m deeply sorry’ while holding Harry’s face. It was the face of a woman who was finally
He thought for a moment before breathing in deeply and looking directly at me. His gaze was strong and intense, and my legs felt a bit wobbly with his stare.
didn’t like it. And, if I dared to be bold, he liked it even less now after the war. I’ve never seen Harry Potter have a panic attack, even when the Dark Lord was face to face with him. I’ve always thought Potter was as incapable of being scared as I was incapable of being brave.
“Yes, it's a monkey, Tali!” Harry praised her, kissing her cheeks when Talitha said anything remotely recognisable.
“Do you have anything?” Harry asked, fixing his clothes and looking at Draco as if expecting something.
“No, not at all. He’s… actually being fine, he helps a lot, and even when he’s being a git he’s actually… I mean, he’s funny. But that’s beside the point.” Now both Ron and Hermione had their eyebrows lifted, looking at me as if waiting for an explanation. I sighed. “He’s not being horrible. And I can see he’s actually really sorry for what happened. He was one of the people who stayed behind cleaning the castle, you know?”
It was funny how, after getting rid of Voldemort’s piece inside of him, Harry grew taller. He was stronger, both mentally and physically, and he towered over Draco. The other man was not only shorter, thinner and lean. The perfect size to be in Harry’s arms. Harry had to forcefully change his train of thought.
“Good. Now I need you to go completely into the lake and wash yourself well, okay? I'll get you some dry clothes.” Harry said, leaving the lake, but Dracy held out his arms with a desperate look. “Calm down, I'm not going to run away with her.”
” Ron looked like he couldn’t believe it, and I hid my face in my hands, ashamed of being out of control because of a damn joke and just spilling my secrets.
“Fuck me, Harry! Fuck me already! Fuck that monster cock inside me, shove it all!” Draco moaned, and Harry knew he couldn’t deny those urgent pleas.
As soon as his feet were able to touch the ground again, Harry started walking, and soon Draco came to help him pull the man to the dry sand.
“Yes, I do,” Harry smiled, and Draco mirrored his smile, his eyes getting less watery. “And what about the smells? What can you smell?”
Harry was amazed, looking from Talitha to the fruit. Perhaps because she was so small, Talitha was unable to get the mango into her hand, letting it fall halfway. Harry levitated the fruit the rest of the way and handed it to Talitha, who tried to bite the mango peel, but without much success.
“To piss me off, maybe?" Malfoy sighed, licking his dry lips and grimacing in pain. “I am very hungry.”
“Did you give it to her? Tell me you didn't give it to her!” His screams were almost animal, and Dracy started to sob, tears falling from his confused eyes.
. It means that, although we were close to Flitwick, it gave me a bit of a shelter to hide from Potter, and I could hear him perfectly.
Hello! I'm sorry I took long to post, I have a few important projects I have to make and it's been taking all my free time. But here it is!
It was terribly fun, and Draco won all of their rounds, Ron and Millie being the worst ones, Hermione and Harry only doing it for fun, and Pansy coming to a very close to first second.  After a couple of hours, though, they had to come back to their own offices and it was still too hot.
After that, McGonagall stood behind the teacher’s table, in front of the headmistress chair, and cast a
“He has no heartbeat, and doesn’t breathe. His body is... very cold.” Lucy said, looking at Harry with tears in her eyes, which she didn’t drop. “He killed himself.”
“We’re gonna die here, Potter! We are going to die! And no one will find our bodies!” Malfoy shouted, in a desperation Harry could feel deeply, and as much as he wanted to be strong and not succumb, he knew they were lost. Tears fell from his eyes, mingling with the sand that had stuck to his skin, and he let himself cry.
“And when I ask for the next one, you’ll keep it in your pants and talk some sense into me-eeeeAAAAAH! For FUCK’S SAKE!”
After a while, the tears were gone, and I could just focus on him. The way he was rocking me from side to side, softly. The way his big hands were running over my back, the way his head was rested on top of mine.
It was like the whole room was blooming, like all the flowers grew around them, mixing with the sunny sensation of the summer, and then…
Talitha patted Dracy's leg with her little hand, trying to get his attention. Dracy was breaking a banana into small pieces, but Talitha wanted to eat right now. She hit it a little harder, and yet, Dracy didn't look at her.
“I thank all of you that came back to our school this year. It’s with great happiness that we welcome you back to Hogwarts, to give you an opportunity of having a fresh start, in a world free of the Dark Lord and his followers. We are also sad to see our tables are emptier this year. Many heroes gave their lives in the Battle of Hogwarts, and we’ll all be grateful for their sacrifice. You’ll see pictures of them in the halls right outside these doors. The heroes of our Era will always be remembered in this school. Now, I hope you are hungry because we have plenty of food!”
It was what Harry needed to let his orgasm take over, and he came, long spurts of come inside of Draco. Draco rolled his eyes back, coming again a second, small orgasm, just from the feel of Harry’s heat inside of him with no protection.
“No, Potter. Unlike you, some of us have actual talent.” I said, my voice going an octave higher. Fucking alpha pheromones. My nose was filled with his smell, and my omega wanted to sound cuter and smaller for him. Not that my voice was low, to begin with, but I didn’t want to be obvious that my little arctic fox liked the sound of Potter’s voice.
“It does. You bought it for me as a joke,” Harry replied, and he saw Draco’s eyes drooping a little. The other man was completely exhausted. Harry pulled him in for a hug, slowly, and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry like he completely needed it.
“I don’t care if they listen, Potter, just kiss me,” Draco said, and still smiling, Harry did, pressing Draco’s back against the wall behind him. They were in a little alcove they found behind an armour on an empty corridor. They were coming back to their Eight Year Common Room after a party with their classmates on the Room of Requirement.
Dracy turned away from Harry, looking him in the eye with furrowed brows. Finally, he shook his head, crossing his arms and, without realising it, resting them on his prominent belly.
King Harry’s voice was deep, rumbling through my body, making me even more aware of how much I wanted him. I knew nothing of him, of how he was, how he would be as a husband, but at the moment, I would take what I could, and I wanted him in me
“I'm hungry too.” Harry leaned against Dracy, his cock slowly becoming limp as he watched his baby there.
They started waving their arms frantically, shouting 'Go back! Don't come near us!’ to the boat, but it seemed to be in vain. They even threw stones at the boat, which fell uselessly into the water. Soon the boat would be touching the invisible protection around the island and would be engulfed by the magic of the drift.
Harry proceeded to grab two spoons. He shoved one in his own bowl, and offered the other one to Draco. Draco went to grab the spoon, and his fingers brushed against Harry’s…
this child, for one. So yes, your breast tissue will enlarge. And you’ll probably gain fat tissue as well, you may gain some sensibility and your semen levels may decline.” The healer said, and Harry looked at Draco, asking with his eyes if he was sure.
After 10 months since they first started trying, they weren’t trying anymore. Not as they first did. Their sex schedule came back to normal, and although Draco still took his potions out of habit, he wasn’t thinking it was doing any good for them.
“Then have me… All of me,” Draco said, stepping back from Harry and removing his jumper, revealing a white tee underneath. He then removed it too, the chill of the night making his pores stand up and his pink nipples harden, the snake necklace resting in the middle of his chest.
When they didn't want to work in the cabin, Harry learned to make ropes with Draco, and when he was working on braiding them, Draco tried different techniques to turn his little cotton balls into threads. After a few weeks, he discovered an efficient, yet time-consuming process. First he took out the seeds, and then he opened the balls, mixing them together. When the fibers were separated enough, he combed them all with a clean, unscented fish bone, and with the help of a stick - which Harry sharpened so that it resembled a pointed wand - he was able to pull the combed cotton thread, rolling it in a slow and measured way, in a spiral shape so that the cotton wrapped around itself and formed a long and resistant thread.
“It’s my family symbol,” he said, pulling a necklace from inside his jumper. It had a snake pendant on it.
And Harry did. He raised from the settee with Draco in his arms, and carried him to their bedroom, putting him on their bed.
“It’s just a picture, love. It’s just a picture. We’ll be fine,” Harry said, and as he smiled so Mark could take the photo, he heard Sirius say ‘oops’ at his side.
“Hnn… Cleaning and loosening spell,” Draco clarified, then reached for Harry’s hand, murmuring a lubricating spell. Harry’s hand got sticky with clear fluid, and Draco guided his hand to his own arsehole. “Finger me open, Harry. I want to take your huge cock inside me, all of it.”
After a labour of four hours, the mediwitch finally held their baby in her arms, smiling at them as another mediwitch cut the cord and made the baby cry.
I nodded, pretending I really didn’t care about it, but my heart was beating like it wanted to go samba across the walls of Hogwarts castle. Flitwick announced Harry as bass and asked him to sit together with the basses as we went through the songs we were going to sing on Christmas Day. We had about two months to practice, and most of us already knew the songs, and I sure hoped Potter could learn fast.
Harry decided to take a shower for the day, so he grabbed his clothes and went to the bathroom. He brushed his teeth and showered, trying to ignore his huge morning wood. It was difficult because it was
“Fuck me like you promised, alpha… Fuck my pink, little omega-hole like a cheap whore until I come like never before,” that made him move, and I almost wished I didn’t say it, because he then held me and fucked me with all his might. His balls were slapping mine, his cock going straight to my prostrate and making me fucking
As they said it, their respective beds changed colour to their house colour. Harry smiled, magic always something that surprised him out of nowhere like he was still that little boy of eleven. Their trunks were near the wardrobe, and Harry pulled his close to his bed.
Their pleas became even more desperate, and a man appeared at the bow, probably the captain of the boat. He waved at both of them, and Draco shouted a stronger 'No!'. Nothing was effective, however, because just a few seconds later, the boat seemed to hit an invisible barrier, and strong waves, coming from nowhere, hit the hull with such force that it turned it violently.
When Harry got Draco’s memo asking him to go to his office, it wasn’t really a surprise. Draco used to say that, in order to be an amazing curse-breaker, one had to understand magical theory as if it was their own soul and mind. And it might just be true because Draco was the best curse-breaker of the whole department since he and Harry had been partnered together two years ago. With this said, it was also true he was prone to… Accidents. Draco loved to test new spells and charms, and while they had so far never really harmed anyone, sometimes Draco’s magic did have consequences he wasn’t happy with, so Harry was called to help him with those situations.
When Harry awoke, the sun had just risen, apparently. The weather was a little chilly, the drizzle of the night keeping the earth a little damp, the sea breeze and the smell making everything colder. Draco was sleeping fully in his arms, his own arms around Harry, and Harry smiled, letting himself stay like that for a few minutes longer while he considered what to do.
Draco rolled his eyes, softly holding Scorpius by his nappy-covered bum and rearranging him on his chest. He looked up as Harry rested his elbows in the back of their settee, smiling at Draco. There was a patch of white hair where Harry’s scar met his scalp, and Draco wanted to scratch his husband’s head with his fingers, so he could feel the soft strands.
As the man moved, Harry saw, as if in slow motion, the photographer’s foot step down on the little matchbox car that Cygnus was playing with on the floor. Mark went down quickly, and Harry reacted before he could think, holding Cygnus tightly with one arm and grabbing Mark’s arm with his other hand, tugging him so he wouldn’t fall down.
fixing things. It was his talent, and he stood taller, puffing his chest and raising his pointy chin.
We signed all the papers and he took my hand, kissing my knuckles before announcing that the ball would start. Nobles from both our kingdoms were there to see us, dance, eat and drink in our name. My father and King Harry shook hands since the agreement was fulfilled, and my mother gave me a strong hug, whispering in my ear:
Harry was amazed by it, how Draco slowly took it all inside him, down to the balls. The blond stopped, his eyes closed, his breathing evening as he slowly acclimated to Harry's girth.
“I think yes, partially. But it is better than nothing.” Dracy said, hands holding the baby firmly against his chest.
I was then guided to a room – which I assumed was King Harry’s bedroom – and with a soft smile, the servant closed the door and left me alone.
It was so tight that even his fingers had a hard time getting into the hot, wet channel. Lucy moaned loudly, spreading her legs even wider, and Harry didn't give her time to breathe, wrapping the delicate penis in his mouth and sucking, circling with his tongue, feeling it swell in his mouth as he fucked her cunt with his fingers.
“I promised I wouldn't reveal that secret. But I have a reliable source who tells me that they are both alive,” Ron stated again, and the Unspeakable shook his head.
His eyes turned completely yellow instead of the beautiful green, and he held me by my hips, turning me aggressively on my stomach.
“Yes, we've been here for over two months. It has been a considerable time.” Harry commented, making the fire and placing the pot with water on top. He had cut half of his trouser’s legs, making them look like shorts now. He had his legs crossed on the floor, separating the oysters so he could put them in the water after it was boiling.
He heard of these things happening, to other people obviously. He wrote about it in his books, too. People suddenly finding their soulmates and their world twisting upside down, but he never thought… He had never dreamt or imagined that it might happen to him.
Yes, it took him four seasons, but now that he felt like he could say it, he was going to say it again.
“Uh—Yeah, of course. Mum would never forgive me if I let you here alone. Besides, I really want to see you up there like a fancy pants.” Ron grinned, and I couldn’t help but grin back and roll my eyes.
“No, it’s just… It’s weird when you meet someone that has only been a label to you, you know? It’s a bit like getting stuck in snow and being saved by Chris Hemsworth…”
They came to a stop in front of a large house. Though the snow was falling thick and fast around them, Draco could see that  the walls painted white with a terrace around the whole building. Draco turned off the car, sighing and leaving it, at the same time that the man in the truck. Now, out of the car, he could see that he was damn tall. He was a big man, with broad shoulders even broader because of all the layers he was wearing. He came near Draco, his steps confident. Draco still couldn’t see his face, but now the intense green eyes were wide open, and Draco swallowed hard.
