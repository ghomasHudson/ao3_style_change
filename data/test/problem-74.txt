“You think so?” Harry said, turning towards him, and there was something in his face that made Draco realize that this was the crux of the matter – not the revelation of his mark to the people of Great Britain, but the insinuation that it might link him to the Dark Lord.
I haven't. I'm just unsure on how much I want to stress that plot point, given that I want to also rewrite the following years.
The blue robes of the Beauxbatons students had barely disappeared from sight when there was a flurry of activity at the lake. The waters bubbled aggressively for a few moments. Slowly, a mast broke out the surface, long and dark. Then, magnificiently, the rest of the ship rose out of the water, like a sinking wreck having forgotten in which direction the bottom laid. It looked the part, too: skeletal, somehow, as if its sails remembered torns and holes and the depth of the ocean, and portholes like so many glittering eyes through the fog. It glided towards them, and hoisted itself on the bank. It should have listed, no longer buoyed by the deep waters of the lake, but it remained perfectly upright, its prow proud and straight.
“What?” Draco said. “I’m not the one tripping over my own feet everytime I talk with Diggory or his girlfriend.”
“Do you know who she’s going with?” Ron asked again, and when Harry answered negatively: “Damn. We’ll be the only two sods without a partner at this rate. Maybe we should just go with each other.”
The Weasel blinked several times, considering his new clothes with a surprised air, and finally said:
“It would be so very sad if it were true, though, wouldn’t it?” Daphne said, turning beseeching eyes toward Draco.
She was alright, that Granger girl, even without the added benefit of providing teasing material against Viktor.
He was this close to stomping his foot like a kid having a tantrum – like Dudley used to do when Petunia refused to buy him the sweets he had set his eye on, really. Furious – at Draco for his words, at Cedric for causing this mess, at himself for reacting so immaturely – he stormed off in the direction of the Forbidden Forest, or Hagrid’s hut, he didn’t know. He just wanted to be away from Draco before his disappointment and rage came out like bile.
Draco may or may not have been involved in a months-long campaign to ensure no one would help the git until he had missed a certain amount of classes. But that was nobody's business but his, really.
“There’s a difference between being a Slytherin and being a dark wizard. Do you think all those first years are bad just because they want to become someone great in the future? Because that’s what ambition means, Ron. You just want to do the best you can for yourself.”
“What is it?” he asked, squeezing Narcissa’s hand back and avoiding a longing look at his plate. He had been flying over the grounds all afternoon, and felt ravenous.
He had almost managed to push the Durmstrang boy out of his mind. That was one thing he could thank the Tournament, he reckoned: that amount of stress did not leave him much room to dwell on his failed - what? Relationship? Romance? - with Draco Malfoy.
“Oh, come off it, Potter!” Draco exclaimed. “It’s not for another two hours, and my luggage is all ready to go since I had so much time to straighten it this morning while you were off gallivating with Diggory.”
When he saw the door, he fought down the urge to bolt away. He was a Gryffindor, after all, and Gryffindors were brave and didn’t run away from difficult conversations.
The First Task is dragons. Draco really has to wonder about the sanity of all the organizers of this bloody tournament.
Plus, Karkaroff really cared a lot about appearances and reputations, and he was so universally hated by the student body that no one wanted to emulate him. In an ironic twist of fate, Durmstrang was a breeding ground of progressist ideas, where students learnt about the Dark Arts during the day and exchanged muggle novels and political books in secret during the evening clubs. Each time Karkaroff went on another tirade about how every muggle and muggleborn was a blight upon the surface of the earth, a few students took it upon themselves to find out how his ideas could be disproven.
“See you in ten days, Potter,” Draco smirked, so close that Harry could smell the sharp accents of his shampoo.
“Of course I do not want you to participate in it,” his father said, his voice dripping with disdain. “We are Malfoys, we do not need such pageantry to assess our worth. You are too young, anyway. One of the conditions for Dumbledore to agree to the scheme was that all participants be of age. Karkaroff was very difficult about letting you be on the delegation even though you are not old enough to be selected. I had to twist his arm a little.”
“You might find the perspective of Karkaroff’s absence for a year more than enough compensation, but I’ll keep you updated on all the developments during the Tournament, Kaija, I promise. You will feel as if I’ve never left your side,” Draco said. “And you’ll be the first to know about who gets picked as our Champion between Svetlana and Viktor. That will only cost you a tenth of the betting pool.”
I like the idea of them bonding over Quidditch. And yes, Draco plays chaser: no competition with Harry to steer him to the seeker position, and he's not that much of a glutton for punishment that he'd try to compete with Viktor.
Harry had loved last night, which had quite reconciled him with the concept of balls altogether. He had also been hoping for a nice and lengthy discussion with the reason he had spent such a good time, but it was already going on ten and Cedric was making him late. Well, later than he already was.
“Harry doesn’t care about politics,” Draco said with a shrug. “He’s just a kid, and he just wants to go to classes and avoid problems as much as the average student. I don’t think he’s ever given the slightest thought about the interests of pureblood families, positively or negatively.”
“Mr Davies, 10 points from Ravenclaw, and get back to your common room,” followed by the zap of a banishing spell. “Miss McKinnon, Miss Clearwater, 10 points each from Hufflepuff. You should find a better place next time.”
Still, for the occasion, she had worn a silk dress in golden yellow, embroidered in the same color on the sleeves, underneath deep blue velvet robes trimmed with white fur. The sleeves of the robes were split in the Muscovite style, and fell down to her knees. She had foregone any headpiece, though Draco knew they were
He risked another glance at Granger, and saw her clutching Weasley’s arm fiercely. The ginger git was so pale Draco could have counted his freckles from where he stood. Well, at least Potter would get his best friend back, and it’d only take him almost dying.
“Draco, you can’t stay around him,” she said again, and her usually carefully controlled expression slipped away then, revealing her fear.
Harry was still a bit disoriented when he stepped into the common room one hour later, and found Ginny trying to comfort a shaken Ron.
“Sorry, Potter, but zat has to be the least convincing lie I’ve heard since my brozer tried to convince my mozer zat Durmstrang had instaured remote classes,” Rasputin said. “And you seem to be under ze mistaken impression zat I’m leaving you choice. You can come viz me of your own volition, or I can
“How come you are so interested about Durmstrang, anyway?” Ron asked, nudging Harry. “They’re all a bunch of Dark Arts practitionners, anyways. Grindelwald went there, you know.”
“Yes, Drasha, zat. You spent half ze evening spelling zat zing to be as visually loud as possible yesterday. You’re not fooling anyone.”
He even managed to look properly posh wading through the muddy waters of the lake, and wasn't that particularly unfair? Harry looked down at his drenched t-shirt and shorts and grimaced.
Now you'll have to wait until I produce new ones, and I've unfortunately fallen off the NaNo train quite hard. We're on lockdown here, have been for the past few weeks. I'm also unemployed at the moment, so I have very little occasions to step out my house. It's getting tiring and my motivation is very low. I'll be trying my best but the next chapter might take a bit longer to come out.
“I think he used the fact that he vas vat Harry would sorely miss in our riddle,” Viktor said from his other side.
“Oh, you lovesick fools,” Svetlana said, clucking her disapproval. “Could you spare me zis pazetic display?”
"Is that all you had to say?" Harry cut him off. "Because that doesn't sound like something that I care to hear, like I said. If you're only here because you feel guilty, that's okay, I'll live. I don't need to know exactly why you don't want,"
Draco sighed and leaned back against one of the benchtops, pinching the bridge of his nose as if feeling exhausted.
They all winced at that. Hermione opened her mouth, probably to berate him for his superficiality, but couldn’t get a word in when he suddenly turned to her and looked her up and down and said: “Hermione, you’re a girl,” like it had only just occurred to her.
Harry has no idea how Dobby got his hands on gillyweed, but he's not about to look a gift horse in the mouth. At least since Hermione approved of it.
“I don’t think I fancy making a joke of myself trying to speak French,” Ron groaned, plopping down into one of the sofas of the common room. “And what language do they even speak in Durmstrang? No one even knows where it is.”
It was a matter of minutes to take the bindings off, and then Draco was in his arms, limp and unresponsive, but unmistakably solid and warm. Yet none of the other Champions had come, yet, and Harry just couldn't leave the others behind. Certainly not Hermione, but Cho was equally out of the question, and Gabrielle even more. He was trying to argue with the merpeople guarding them, as much as you could argue with someone underwater and without knowing a word of merspeak, when Cedric finally appeared and, in a few moments, had made off with Cho, to Harry's great relief. One less person to worry about.
No one asked him how he knew that: Viktor always knew the most obscure details about Quidditch, which apparently included non-professional players at a foreign school.
There was that. Both Viktor and Svetlana were shoe-ins for Karkaroff’s list, for all that the headmaster was going on about selecting on merit, and no favoritism would be shown, so the seventh years had better give it their all.
“Vell, dragons are pretty hard to hide,” Svetlana pointed out. “And aren’t Hufflepuffs supposed to be all about fairness and loyalty? Maybe he told Harry?”
“A complete sentence would be nice, Potter,” Draco said, but either he had not put enough conviction in it, or Harry was too focused on what he wanted to ask, because that did not get him the glare and sass he had expected.
The black kid had dropped his projectile, and his victim yelped and stood up, squirming to get rid of whatever squishy, sticky substance had gone down his back. In the ensuing mess, Draco met the eyes of that last Gryffindor boy he had noticed, vivid green against the brown skin, as he leaned away from the wild moves of his classmate with a wild laugh. This caused his hair to shift, the curls sliding to the side and parting to reveal the lightning bolt scar on his forehead, at the exact moment when Draco realized he had seen this boy before, in a high room over a stadium full of screaming supporters.
“I really do not have anything for you, though,” the Durmstrang boy said, considering Harry and tapping his index against his cheek thoughtfully. “Ah! How about this?”
It was common in pureblood households to raise their children bilingual. For Draco, it had been French, as the Malfoy line had originated there, and an extant branch had survived there until the revolution had uprooted them to the other side of the Channel. Spending so much time with the Rasputin siblings had taught him quite a bit of German, though, which both siblings spoke fluently. Their mother had been some sort of Bavarian Forest countess. By now, Draco could probably hold a decent conversation in German, though most of his vocabulary consisted of swear words. Russian he had given up on learning. He did remember the insults, though. Antoniy had quite the potty mouth, and the translation spell rather pointedly did not include such words.
“Oh, so you manipulated him into forgiving you?” Svetlana said with a low whistle that could either be in endorsement or in disgust. Sometimes it was hard to tell, with her.
“You look nice,” Harry said, as he joined them down the stairs, his eyes averted from Draco’s face because the kid apparently couldn’t handle giving compliments, or receiving them, or any flirting, really, while making eye contact.
He did, however, relish Viktor’s dismayed face when he announced that he had invited Potter to go to Hogsmeade with them, and that his muggleborn friend would join. Granger, her name was Hermione Granger, and it was great fun watching Viktor try to pronounce her name and fail miserably. There was no way to blame the translation spell for that one.
But as soon as he made a move towards Hermione, there was a merperson barring his way, without menace but with unmistakable firmness. Harry gestured angrily towards his best friend, but no, the merperson shook her head and pointed at Draco, then at him.
It wasn’t that Snape’s announcement had surprised him: since seeing the words on the Prophet at breakfast, he had known his mother would contact him. He had not anticipated it happening quite so soon, though, and certainly not through the Potions Master. Snape had been somewhat close to his father, once upon a time, but the relationship was nothing more than cordial nowadays: a shared understanding based on a common past, which existed between acquaintances rather than friends. To the best of Draco’s knowledge, Narcissa Malfoy had never fit anywhere in this equation. Yet she had contacted Snape directly, and managed to get his help in securing a private conversation with Draco. It spoke of a stronger relationship than what had existed between Lucius and Snape, and of a direct one, too: Snape had not mentionned Lucius at all, and from that Draco gathered that his father didn’t necessarily know about the upcoming Floo call, and that his intercession hadn’t been needed to convince the Potions Master.
“Why don’t we go inside?” Harry exclaimed brightly, grabbing Draco’s arm and starting to drag him toward the Great Hall.
The ball in Harry’s stomach, tight and clenched, exploded, half a second before every vial and flask in the lab followed suit.
This quiet revolt was led, obviously, by the half-blood students at Durmstrang, but few purebloods resisted the pressure of their peers to convert to a new outlook on life much further than their fourth year. Even Draco had succumbed to it over time: both Antoniy and Svetlana had inherited the charisma of their illustrious grandfather, and they made very compelling arguments. The Rasputin clan had always been very enthusiastic about mingling with muggles, though only their grandfather had deemed it fit to even meddle in their political affairs. They did not put much stock in the Statute of Secrecy, and in their domain, the muggle staff had perfect knowledge of their wizarding colleagues’ and masters’ abilities.
When he stopped them, Harry promptly smashed into him, tried to step back, tripped over nothing and stomped on Draco’s feet all over again when rebalancing.
“I’m not participating in it,” he said, his voice much lower. “I’m just accompanying the delegation.”
So of course reality had to turn around and smack him in the face, hard. It happened during the summer holidays, when they were all at the Burrow the day before leaving for the Quidditch World Cup. They were in Ron’s room, discussing the upcoming match, all excited and happy, while changing into their pajamas. At some point, Harry turned to Ron to contradict his opinion on Bulgaria’s chances, shaking the shirt in his hand in mock anger, and Ron’s snort of derision suddenly changed into a gasp.
The night ended more early than any of them would have truly liked, and Harry and Draco found themselves on the grounds overhearing a rather pointless and rather dangerous conversation about giant heritages – really, anyone could see both participants were part-giant, what could be gained by discussing it where anyone could hear? – and feeling embarrassed at Delacour trailing her partner towards the bushes for some more intimate time.
The elbow Harry sent into his side reminded him that he might have gone for a more diplomatic reaction – and damn, if the kid didn’t have some sharp angles on that body of his – but really, he had been too surprised to rein himself in. Weasley turned beetroot red at his remark, and between the hair, the freckles and the appalling maroon colour of his dress robes, that made for a deeply unflattering picture.
He threw his towel on the table and rose: his father caught his wrist as he tried to leave the room.
However, it immediately brought back to memory the fact that he hadn't flied at all since the fight with Draco, which had to be the longest he had been without flying outside of the summer holidays. His mood immediately sank. Ron, sensing this, hurriedly offered a game of Exploding Snap and Harry pushed out any worries of the Second Task and Draco Malfoy, grateful for the distraction. There had to be a point when he wouldn't need to consciously avoid the very thought of him.
My stock of finished chapters is also dwindling, so you might want to brace for longer-spaced updates.
Karkaroff did not put much faith into school breaks, and despised Chritsmas with an intensity only surpassed by his hatred of muggles. Thus, in Durmstrang, the only times classes were interrupted were during the month of February, for their Practicals, group projects that each year proved to be even more intense and insanely difficult than the previous one, and in the summer, when students were allowed to return home for six weeks. Even then, they were assigned a list of spells to practice and master before school resumed, and Trace or no Trace, you had better have become proficient at them, because the professors sure assumed you were.
“We can’t be too careful,” Narcissa said. “With Sirius Black’s escape last year, and the Dark Mark appearing this summer, everyone at the Ministry has been on their toes.”
“Are you going to say something, or do you intend to keep on mimicking a grindylow until you become one?” Draco said acidly.
For a wild moment, he thought about taking Hermione, and being done with it. It even made sense: Draco was friends with Viktor, and could very well have been taken for him, rather than for Harry. Viktor would sorely miss Draco, not Harry. He had been working so hard on not missing him anymore, after all.
“Fine, fine,” Ron said, raising his hands in defense. “Just saying, it’s weird how you’re suddenly all about Slytherins’ welfare. What’s next, house elves?”
To their surprise, it was the Greengrass girl, Daphne, who came to her rescue. She had looked completely uninterested in their conversation so far, and kept glancing at another table when she thought no one would catch her.
“Again?” Draco asked, raising his eyebrow at Svetlana, who returned his expression with a shrug. “You’ve been spending all your time there, is it that interesting?”
Draco loves the summer holidays. It's the only time he gets to see his parents, because Karkaroff doesn't believe in students having breaks.
“A ponce?” Harry suggested, because that had been Ron’s favourite designation for Draco since the first Task.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he said, gathering his wounded dignity and trying very hard not to look in the direction of Gryffindor’s table.
Draco had received a letter from his mother, which explained why he didn’t react when the Great Hall suddenly hushed, as he considered the folded parchment and the Malfoy crest stamped into the green wax distrustfully. There were no reason for Mother to write to him so close to her previous letter, barely four days ago. No reason, except if she had heard about what had transpired of the Second Task.
“You’re a pig,” Hermione informed him. “I stand by what I said. The professors shouldn’t be allowed to punish us in ways that could hurt us. What would you have said if she had ended up with broken bones, or dead?”
“I was ze one who asked ‘im to take me,” Gabrielle Delacour interjected with authority. “I wanted to go, but Fleur wouldn’t take me because she wanted to go wiz a boy,” her voice turned very disdainful as that particular moment. “And I knew Ronald ‘ad no one since Fleur ‘ad rejected ‘im, so I begged ‘im to take me and ‘e said yes.”
Draco will probably end up the Ball terribly maimed, based on Potter's abysmal dance skills, but he can't bring himself to regret it.
“Preposterous,” Draco scoffed. “Soulmarks are for positive influence of great impact between the two persons who share them. There is no way the Dark Lord is soulmarked – no Dark Wizard has ever been, and there is no way he would share a mark with you, of all people, who he tried to kill as a baby.”
And he swooped down and pressed his lips against Harry’s cheekbone. They were soft and delicate, lingering for one, two seconds against Harry’s skin before retreating.
“Zank you for taking my sister to the Ball, Ronald,” Fleur said. “Take good care of ‘er, please. You weell be’ave, Gabrielle, weell you not?”
She seemed to relish being the centre of attention of older students, and from the way the rest of her House looked at her, she had gained a lot of respect for getting three Durmstrang students to sit with her, especially when it included Viktor Krum. Draco would not begrudge her her moment of glory, and the way she was milking it for all its worth.
And that was his first impression of Draco Malfoy. Then there was a Wronski feint, a Snitch caught by the losing team, a celebration, an attack and a Dark Mark in the sky. It was all a big mess, and Harry forgot all about Draco Malfoy.
Svetlana saved the day – and probably any chance Draco might have entertained he had with Harry Potter as well – before the Weasel could step forward and clock Draco in the face as he so obviously wanted to.
Viktor must have sensed the danger, because he left it at that, and prompty walked away. And right before Draco spotted the bushy mass of hair of Potter’s muggleborn friend disappearing through the Great Hall’s doors – what was her name already? She had even sat in the stands once during one of their friendly games, reading an enormous book – too, the spoilsport.
Even that could have been forgiven, however. Draco did not approve of hurting muggleborns, or even muggles, really, and did not subscribe to the ideology that it would be beneficial for him or any other pureblood. Sometimes he wished, incongruously, that his peers would have some more
“I vill not allow you to attend zat ball vearing zis,” she said, just as horrified as Draco had been. “Vy did you not transfigure zem into somezing more appropriate?”
“I didn’t do it,” Harry growled between clenched teeth. “Here, satisfied? You can go back to your friends and tell them there is no special trick, I don’t know how my name got into that thrice-damned goblet because I
“No, I mean, I knew, but it’s not what’s important now,” he said dismissively, like he was chosing each of his word very carefully to snip at Hermione’s every last nerve. “It means you could go with me to the ball.”
Somehow, he really didn’t want to tell Draco, with his posh ways and his sophisticated airs, about the Dursleys.
“I swear, Ron,” Hermione exclaimed, throwing her hands up. “Sometimes you’re just as bigoted as the ones saying my blood’s dirty. You just don’t want to see it.”
“Well, feel free to torture you little mind about it,” Draco said, with a dismissive wave at her. “I, for one, do not care.”
Of course Malfoy was in the potions lab, he spent all his free time there those days, only leaving to attend his classes and meals. Sometimes he even skipped those, too. Not that Harry had checked. Multiple times. Using the Marauder’s map. He didn’t care, after all.
Yep, Svetlana has an accent in Hogwarts that she didn't have in Durmstrang. There's a (possible) explanation coming, as I'm trying to reconcile my headcanons for Durmstrang with the actual canon accents in the books.
Some further lore about Durmstrang interspersed in here. I do enjoy this school, shame we won't be seeing more of it.
The muggleborns and half-bloods might not have understood the depth of the transgression, but for those who had been raised and weaned on wizardry fairytales, it stood different. Soulmarks were private, so incredibly private, that you only trusted those closest to you with the fact of their existence, and most people confined the revelation of its form to an even smaller circle, and generally only once it had settled and they had identified the other partner in the soulbond. To reveal a soulmark accidentally was one thing: to take a picture, of an unsettled mark at that, and publish it in the most highly read publication of Wizarding Great Britain? Unconscionable.
“Fine,” Draco huffed. “But for the record, I’d like to note that I’m not the one who started this whole aggressivity thing.”
Draco could see how such measures would sound ridiculous to a Durmstrang student. Viktor probably owed his flying prowess in part to the training he got escaping the Norwegian Ridgebacks which inhabited the mountains marking their grounds’ Southern limit. Avoiding a forest because of a few centaurs seemed like nonsense, especially when you could just talk yourself out of any problem with them if you showed enough respect.
Viktor quickly followed, though the sight of Harry with Draco in his arms seemed to give him pause. He stopped to look at them, but his transfiguration made it even more impossible than usual to guess at what he was thinking. He made a sign at Harry, then at Hermione, and Harry shook his head, nodding to the blonde head close to his. Viktor made a move that might have been a shrug, and made quick work of Hermione's ties.
Draco was scheduled to spend the remainder of his break at the Manor, and he had never felt less enthused at the idea of seeing his parents. But his mother was already disappointed he hadn’t been able to attend the Yule celebrations with them because of the ball, he couldn’t deny her the rest of the holidays as well.
So they remained on good terms, because Draco did not feel like tickling the sleeping dragon for such a little thing. It was of no import, anyway. His parents had their opinions, and he had his, and there was no use in measuring all the ways in which they differed. It would only invite dissent between them, and it was not like Draco ever intended on shacking up with a muggle, anyways. He might find them interesting, but he couldn’t imagine sharing his life with someone he could not fly with.
It was a different world, underwater. Calm and peaceful, with almost no sounds compared to the surface. The water, who always appeared dark and murky viewed from above, had a greenish quality when you swam in it, and Harry's webbed feet and hands greatly helped. A grindylow tried to stop him, but a well placed kick and a scalding hex got rid of it pretty quickly. Harry regretted not having any way to keep track of the time with him, but he still reached the village of the merpeople in what he thought would leave him with ample time to return to the surface. The village was pretty empty, and the only merpeople he crossed paths with raised their hands and hurried him further on, until he reached what must have been the main square. In the center of it, guarded by merpeople armed with spears and tridents, he easily recognized the four people tied to the tail of a statue of a merperson. The tiniest one was Gabrielle, who couldn't be anyone's but Fleur's hostage. Then he made out the face of Cho, her braided hair flotting behind her softly – but she had to be Cedric's, Harry reasoned, swimming past her. The next one, her hair a wild halo around her, was Hermione – and that had to be it, Harry thought, Hermione was the one he had to bring back, until her hair moved and he caught sight of a flash of pale blond hair and. No. He stopped dead in his tracks, but that was not the way movement worked underwater, and his previous stroke forward had had enough momentum that he was round the tail, past Hermione, and facing the closed eyes and sharp nose of Draco Malfoy. You couldn't weep underwater, Harry thought, and felt desperately grateful for. This was downright cruel.
He was almost to the ship, in front of which a few students mingled, the red uniforms of Durmstrang mixed with Hogwarts’ black robes, most trimmed with green – the Slytherins had taken to the foreign wizards quite well – and even the blue set of one Beauxbatons boy. But a superior power hated him, apparently, because he was waylaid before he could reach his goal, with a hand on his shoulder to stop him.
Draco is still pretty much deciding about where this story is headed, regardless of what I had planned. It is slowly getting back closer to my intended outline though.
“Why are you so focused on the roles, Potter? You’ve been whinging for the past half-hour, and if you put the same energy into remembering the steps, we’d already have moved on,” Draco sighed, and then, firming his hold on Harry’s waist and hand, proceeded to lead them through a perfect example of a simple box set and right turn.
“Krum has more than enough fans already, he can do without me,” Draco brushed her off. “Besides, he doesn’t mind, do you, Viktor?” He nudged the man himself, who was currently absorbed in watching something with the same intent face he always sported during one of his matches. “He would even wear the badge if I made him one, wouldn’t you, Viktor?” he added when that got him no reaction.
His mother found him in his rooms later that evening. He was leaning against the mantel, watching the flames dance as he fed them the ripped remains of some letters.
So, down two friends for the foreseeable future, and unwilling to spend time with others who, while not hostile, still didn’t trust him to tell the truth, Harry grabbed his Firebolt and headed to the Quidditch pitch. His bad luck held, though, and when he got there, he saw it was already occupied. With a jolt, he recognized Krum’s unmistakable form, and the striking hair of Draco Malfoy. They were taking turns with the quaffle, one defending the goals while the others attempted to score. Krum flew with a grace that simply did not translate to the way he moved on the ground, but on a broom, oh, he was magnificient. Malfoy didn’t pale much in the comparison: he was obviously an excellent player, and much more at ease with the red ball than Krum was. He was calling taunts at his friend, his smile wide and uncomplicated, and with the wind in his air and the way his eyes shone, he looked particularly arresting.
So the matter of his mark had always been a matter of solicitude at the Manor, and when Draco announced it had manifested around the end of the summer, it became the main subject of conversation during meals:
“They just don’t do it here because it’s forbidden, but I doubt they have the same drawbacks at home.” Ron crossed his arms, jutting his chin forward mulishly. “They’re good enough at throwing hexes, they don’t even need dark magic anyways.”
“So, how did your parents manage to get Karkaroff to give up one of his precious positions to take you to Hogwarts?” Svetlana asked as they took possession of one of the smaller tables in the dining hall afterwards, and glared the younger students away.
“No. The delegations will only come to Hogwarts at the end of October, and Karkaroff was most insistent you return to Durmstrang as per usual.”
They took their place on the dancefloor, Harry already turning nervous and twitchy. Draco gave his hand a squeeze and, manoeuvering him into the proper position, spotted Weasley’s face in the crowd: the flush was gone now, and he was pale in anger. Following his line of sight, Draco saw Granger and Viktor smiling at each other, and, ah, that was not likely to endear Durmstrang students any more to Harry’s best friend.
Thinking of the Dark Mark brought his soulmark to mind, and he almost broke stance to trace it over his robes. Wasn’t the Dark Mark just a poor attempt to emulate the old magic of the soulmarks, when you thought about it? To impress upon his followers’ skin the Dark Lord’s belief that he was so impactful in their lives as to forever change them? That was the kind of self-aggrandizing thinking he was prone to, after all.
And they all dislike Moody because, even without the creepy impersonation by a Death Eater problem, I always thought the guy was a menace. It didn't make sense to me that so many students liked him when he was basically traumatizing them.
“Nine,” Antoniy said. “Draco’s father got him a spot, just so he can see his precious family this year. Poor Drasha can’t spend a year away from his mother and father, you see.”
“The most Gryffindor to ever Gryffindor,” Zabini said, rolling his eyes. “It’s like the guy was born with the survival instinct of a niffler, really.”
“Don’t you vant to know vy he’s broken up viz you vizout telling you?” Rasputin pointed out. “At least you vill have closure, right?”
Lucius looked as if he wanted to dispute this claim, but Draco’s parents always decided which line they followed before any discussion, and always presented an united front, no matter how much they disagreed with each other privately. They never wanted to appear weak to internal dissenssions.
Draco twisted his upper body to look at him where he laid on the grass. The sun was on his back, with the greyish light of early December colouring his hair even lighter than usual, and Harry couldn’t make out his features properly.
“Oh,” Harry said, craning his neck to watch him. “Er, you’re welcome? The others knew as well, so it would have been unfair not to tell you too.”
“Ron said, back when you asked me to the ball,” Harry messed with his curls, sending them flying in all directions. One of them settled near his left eye corner, which had to tickle. “He said that maybe...”
“I have to go,” Harry said quickly. “But, er… See you tomorrow before you leave?” he asked hopefully.
“It’s my parents. I have to think about them,” Draco said and, when something else broke behind him, added in a frustrated tone. “Merlin’s pants, Potter, control your magic.”
“You have no idea how awful Drasha can be ven he’s having a tantrum,” she said. “If he’s not going to do anyzing to rectify the situation, I vill. You might not be the solution, but at least I vill have tried.”
And he knew Viktor would acquit himself honorably, whatever those sadictic organizers had in store for them, but he didn’t exactly feel the same sanguine confidence for Harry. The boy was only fourteen, Merlin’s beard, and the Tournament was notorious for the grievous injuries sustained by its past participants. Potter deserved a little help, was all that Draco was saying.
All three of them had been more than ready to adore Professor Moody when the twins had come singing his praises and waxing lyrical about their first lesson with him. Hermione, upon hearing about what had happened to Parkinson – alleged victim – had immediately changed her mind. She certainly had no lost love for the Slytherin girl, who had relentlessly mocked her front teeth and bushy hair during their first year:
So he resigned himself: either Draco would come around, and tell him what happened, or Harry would just let it go. They hadn’t been in a relationship, after all, and it was obvious Draco regretted what little things they had done together. Whatever. It wasn’t like he cared, anyway.
That was the extent of his knowledge on the matter, and with two people around him bearing the uncommon soulmarks, of his curiosity as well. It wasn’t something that concerned him, thank you very much, and wasn’t that such a relief? That Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived, with his scar and his destiny and his position on the Quidditch team as a first year, didn’t have anything more to separate him from the crowd?
Harry didn't, before she had told him. She hadn't left him any occasion to read through the chapter itself, what with the way she was hoarding the book for herself.
Dragons. The first Task was stealing an egg from a bloody dragon. A nesting bloody female dragon.Draco would have gotten splinters in his hands had he not been wearing his dragonhide gloves, so fiercely he clutched the guardrail of the stands when the surprise was revealed.
“That’s all you have to say?” Harry asked, his anger sparkling back. “You haven’t said a word to me in three weeks and the only thing you have to say is that I should leave?”
It all meant that Draco was pretty much swamped in work, and he had been a fool to think that Hogwarts was an easy school just because they had breaks and shorter study days than in Durmstrang. There were no Dark Arts or Dueling classes, but Defense against the Dark Arts seemed like a weird mix of the two, and though that tosser Moody seemed to hate him on sight, the class was intense and interesting. Alchemy and Advanced Arithmancy had a curriculum just far enough from what he had been taught that they were kicking his ass, and if he had thought he could relax with Herbology and Transfiguration, he had been severely mistaken. Then after he was done, he had to head to the Potions laboratory to work on his Practical, or to the library to try and catch up with his new yearmates. That usually left him one or two free hours in the evening, and Harry always seemed to randomly pop up in his vicinity around that time.
“That was your big secret?” his roommate whispered furiously, and loud enough that they’d probably end up with detention. Or he would, Draco would have no compunction about pushing him off the broom if the need arised. “A deathly tournament that you’ll take part in.”
“See? This is why I’m leading: I actually know the steps, and I can force you to follow if need be,” he said, controlling his grimace as Harry peeked a panicked look at him from under his curls. The kid was lucky he was so cute. “And I’m trying to teach you the other part because I’m hoping that it will ensure the survival of my remaining toes. Optimistic as that may be.”
“The Ministry believes it can foster some international cooperation, and has been taking numerous measures to ensure the safety of the audience,” Lucius answered with a severe gaze.
"Well, disgusting or not, it will make you able to breathe and swim underwater for well over an hour," Hermione said, taping the drawing of the offensive plant with her index. "Be sure to be take it close enough to the lake, though, because you won't be able to breathe outside of it once the effect starts. Elladora Ketteridge almost died from it, you know."
Standing outside waiting in the cold of October might have dimmed his enjoyment, but Flitwick had taught them warming charms a month ago, and they were all quite proficient at it now. The first to third years, less so, and after watching them shiver and huddle closer to each other, the upper years started casting some on them as well. Harry was reapplying one on a tiny first year – who may or may not have been the younger Creevey, but he could only see the back of his head and wasn’t too sure – when gasps made him look up. For a moment he could see nothing, and then he distinguished the silhouette of an immense carriage, drawn by winged horses, slightly darker against the night sky. They drew down by the lake, and from there could be seen more clearly: the carriage was powderblue, large as a mansion, looming even over the gigantic pale horses, which looked like they would literally bite the head off of anyone getting into their range. Hagrid would love them, Harry had no doubt.
“Really, Weasley?” Draco drawled as he turned back to him. “You couldn’t get the older one, so you went for the sister? Isn’t she a bit young for you?”
The next day, Ron still refused to speak to him, and everyone else wanted to know how he had done it. Hermione, the only one to believe him, promised she would try to find a way for him to step down from his unwanted position as fourth Champion in a
"I don't know," Harry said. "He wouldn't say, and you know Dobby. When he doesn't want to say something, he's not saying it."
“What?” he said, and took a deep breath before schooling his expression. “Are you transferring me? Mother, you know I enjoy Durmstrang, and all my friends are there.”
“Great! We’ll start the dancing lessons tomorrow then. And I’ll need to see your dress robes. I can’t be seen with someone who doesn’t clean up nice, you know.”
Harry turned on his heels when he realized he had been staring. The movement seemed to catch Malfoy’s eyes, and he swooped down to the field, coming to a stop right beside Harry.
“Please proceed to your classes in orderly fashion,” Dumbledore sighed, apparently as aware of how unlikely his wishes were to be obeyed as Draco was.
Draco neglected to answer this, but the words filled him with indignation. He had never been anything other than the dutiful son they had wanted him to be, never stepped out of line, and never voiced his opinion about their outdated views on blood purity, though at least Narcissa knew he no longer shared them as fully as she wished.
And it was all going very well, except that Viktor was so tongue-tied he appeared to be glowering, until they crossed paths with that ginger friend of their two companions in the Three Broomsticks. Weasley – which one was it, already? – had taken one look at Krum, another one at Draco, then a common one of utter betrayal at Granger and Potter and the four butterbeers in front of them, and turned heels to drag the rest of their Housemates out of the pub.
“I am not risking my final evaluation to hold your hand zrough a sevenz year Practical, Drasha,” she had said, and that had been the end of it.
Harry nodded, and a blinding smile overtook Draco's face. It was nothing like his usual grin or smirk, full of confidence and haf-mockery, but rather closer to the rare ones Harry had glimpsed, sometimes, when Draco watched him do some neat trick when they played Quidditch.
: if purebloods were supposed to be so much more superior to the others, why would they need to expand so much energy proving it to the world? But, as both Lucius and Narcissa had underlined it, loyalty to his family came first, even when they were behaving foolishly. They were his parents, and he loved them, and they him.
“There are few things quite as disagreeable as learning things you ignored about your own son through other people’s mouths,” Narcissa agreed, with a slight incline of her head. “Rest assured, though, we do not disapprove.”
“I thought he vould never let go of me,” he whinged as he drew near them. “I vish he vould leave me alone.”
When Viktor entered the arena opposite a Chinese Fireball, all of the Durmstrang students collectively leant forward, their breaths hitched in anticipation. In the true style of their school, Viktor attacked the problem rather aggressively, and his conjunctivis curse hit the dragon with masterful precision. They all winced, however, when the Fireball roared and stepped back, smashing half of her nest under her weight. The loss of what must have been at least three eggs would have gotten them a Distressing To Watch grade at the very least, had they been evaluated on such a task back at school. Of course, Karkaroff’s partiality could always be counted on, and Viktor ended up with the highest rating yet, since he had not been hurt himself, and had retrieved the egg in less time than the previous two participants. Draco spotted his dejected expression as he left the arena, though: no matter his first place, he was disappointed in his performance.
No matter what Draco has to say about it, I remain convinced that Ronald Weasley is just a sweet cinnamon roll who has a hard time dealing with his emotion. No folks, there will be zero Ron-bashing 'round those parts, I just love him so much. Actually there will be no bashing at all because I don't see the point (except, you know, between characters that don't like each other for good reasons).
“Yeah, and Voldemort went to Hogwarts,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes again. “Seriously, Ron, don’t you think it’s a bit easy to put them all in the same bag? We’re not all dark wizards here, they have no more reason to be at Durmstrang.”
It started well enough: the food was good, and Harry tried a few of the foreign dishes mixed in with the usual offerings of the Halloween feast. The cheese soufflés, the burgundy beef and the goulash were nice, but the pickled herrings were atrocious and he declined the offer for bouillabaise. Ron tasted everything and pronounced everything delicious, but they all suspected him of not having the same sense of taste as normal people, based on the weird combinations he was sometimes seen eating.
“Blimey, look at that one,” Seamus said under his breath, and whistled softly. Harry followed his glance and spotted an older version of the girl he had just seen, silvery-blonde, tall and willowy, who had apparently gathered the interest of quite a few of the boys. “Got a drop of Veela blood, she sure does.”
This was confirmed when Snape led him to his office, where a green fire was already roaring, and simply said: “I will leave you to it, then. Let yourself out when you are done, Mr Malfoy,” and disappeared into the next room.
Draco could have screamed, or cried, when they led the Hungarian Horntail into the arena. Trust Potter’s luck to draw the most dangerous, most aggressive species of dragons for his Task. That was just on par with the rest of his life, wasn’t it?
He could hear Draco’s soft laugh besides him, and then felt his hands, smooth and long-fingered, clasping around his own wrists to gently draw them away from his face. Harry’s breath hitched, confronted with a grinning face and eyes full of mirth, right above his.
“Maybe because she’s shocked by the fact that someone, supposedly a responsible adult, was allowed to do this to her?” Hermione shot back. “She’s just as human as any of us, she can get scared and hurt, too.”
“Well, the kid needs all the support he can get, doesn’t he?” Draco flicked the badge and the colors exchanged. “Plus, I had to show them how shoddy their workmanship was. Their Charms teacher must be truly appalling, really, if that was the best they could do.”
“And you still believe in this nonsense? That the Dark Lord will somehow come and restore the purebloods to their former glory? He is dead, dead and gone!” Draco laughed, feeling a bit hysterical.
Taking a look around the Hall, he caught sight of Cho Chang, as pretty as ever with her long, smooth dark hair. The Ravenclaw seeker wasn’t looking in his direction, though, nor at any of her comrades. Following her line of sight, he met Cedric Diggory’s eyes, who smiled and winked at him, making a sign towards the Slytherin first years Harry had been observing. The Hufflepuff made a grimace and sat straighter, puffing his chest out to make himself look self-important. Harry snorted, almost inhaled his pumpkin juice, turned to hide and met Cho’s eyes this time, at which point he promptly dribbled whatever juice had not gone down his respiratory tract onto his robes.
"I wonder how he got it, though, or even got the idea," she mused, still turning the pages as if she didn't already know the whole section by heart now. "It's quite a rare plant, after all. I think it's only studied in Herbology, and maybe Potions, at NEWT levels."
“Then why did he hug Harry?” Hermione pointed out. “That doesn’t make any sense, if he was planning not to have anything to do with him anymore.”
That had been another hard lesson: his father’s name did not carry much weight in Durmstrang. There, Lucius Malfoy was nothing more than a foreign dignitary, one who knew Karkaroff well, to be sure, but with no particular power other than that. Oh yes, he was from the Sacred Twenty-Eight of Britain, but that did not mean much. After all, half the students carried their own pedigree: for example, Draco’s roommate starting from his third year, and his older sister a year above them, were Rasputins. Their grandfather had been a prominent figure of Imperial Russia, as well known across the world as Merlin himself, though perhaps not in quite as positive a light.
He motionned to Viktor to join them and, after a glance showed him that Karkaroff was deep into conversation with Dumbledore and could not prevent his escape, the lumbering fool made his way to them.
“I can see that,” Malfoy said, looking uncomfortable. He suddenly grinned: “Why don’t you fly with us? That’s bound to make you feel better, and you can boast about flying with Viktor Krum, seeker extraordinaire. He can probably give you some tips too, if you can get him to talk. Once he starts, though, he’s unstoppable,” he added, leaning to whisper this in Harry’s ear confidentially, though Krum was much too far from them to hear.
“Good zing you’ve finally realized it,” Svetlana said. “But maybe zat particular epiphany could have happened zree weeks ago, vhen you could have actually done somezing about it?”
It wasn’t like he had grown up hoping he would meet him when he went to Hogwarts, and cried bitterly – and secretly – when his father had decided to send him to Durmstrang instead, robbing him of the chance forever.
“If Vincent had not tried to rip one of the beast’s feathers, he would not have been injured at all,” Blaise sniffed. “And you only believe that because you don’t want to believe that Potter’s godfather is a mass murderer.”
This is pretty much just to introduce some background about this alternate version of Durmstrang and Draco's personality.
“Just on the cheek,” Draco mumbled. “It doesn’t really count. And anyway, you never know, with your Gryffindor types. You’re just too bloody touchy-feely, you probably do it to all your friends.”
“Not as many fans there,” Viktor said, but he was mumbling, which was a sure mark of him lying, and Draco perked up in interest.
“I doubt they vould go zat far,” Svetlana rolled her eyes. “You are not so important as you zink you are sometimes, Drasha.”
The first Task was approaching fast, and still no one had the slightest inkling of what may befall the Champions. Draco had tried to find out about it, even writing to his mother to covertly ask her to interrogate Lucius, but nothing was forthcoming. He was starting to get a bit miffed about it, too. There was no way that, in an event of this magnitude, which involved so many people in its organization, no one was willing to spill the beans for a few galleons. Surely someone would talk, even if just to give him – them, the Champions, he meant – a hint.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, surprised, because he certainly had not the foggiest idea what Draco’s reason for suddenly freezing him out could have been.
That would not work, Draco knew this instinctively. There was no way a school, filled with hundreds of students, some of which had not been raised with the knowledge and reverence that soulmarks evoked in wizarding society, would not make the discovery of the most famous person in the country – and arguably all of Europe – being soulmarked their main topic of discussion, and of many rumours beside that.
Harry opened his mouth to tell her – what, he didn’t know. That they had not broken up, because they had not been together? They had been something alright, even if they hadn’t discussed it. To go to hell? That would have been a viable option, except he found out she was right. He wanted to know. He rather desperately wanted to know, truth be told, and the confusion and sadness had been eating at him so much that even Ron had told him he should talk to Draco, much as he’d rather hex his face off.
“She speculates that I’m sharing my mark with Voldemort,” he spit out, and wow, Draco hadn’t read the article, but he hadn’t thought it could get any worse than revealing an unsettled soulmark to the world. Rita Skeeter lived to surprise, apparently.
He had never been so glad to be a native English speaker. The other students sounded completely different than they used to at Durmstrang.
Harry rolled his eyes, because that was the reaction Draco was expecting from him, and tried not to betray the relief he felt that his gift had been appreciated.
“Are you really mocking Viktor for having a crush on a Hogvarts fourz year? Really, Drasha? Zat’s a bit rich, coming from you.”
“You know, this whole endeavour would go so much better if you stopped trying to maim me every time you move,” Draco sighed.
Harry nodded, peeking up to watch Draco’s expression as he made short work of the wrappings. It was a small brooch, of a silver serpent with green eyes, who sometimes moved to settle its coils more comfortably.
Draco was happy to see his parents. He was. Yet he couldn’t fully delude himself into thinking that there was not a small part of him, in the background of his mind, that thought about going back to Hogwarts a bit earlier, maybe just one or two days, not too much. He wouldn’t do it, obviously, it wouldn’t do to appear too eager, and his mother would be so disappointed. He hated it so when that happened.
“He knew it would be a dragon. That’s not the kind of transfiguration you can do so easily,” he said. “You need to train for it to be so smooth, and there’s no reason to repeat transfiguring a rock into a dog, it’s bloody useless in everyday life. He knew, so he cheated.”
“Your mother has requested a private audience with you with,” here Severus paused, just slightly enough that it was almost imperceptible, yet expressed his immense disapproval as loud as if he had rung a great bell, “some urgency. As such, I will leave you the private use of the chimney in my office, right after the last class tonight, so you may conduct a floo call with her.”
Ah. There laid the crux of the matter, of course. This was something Draco understood pretty well: Mad-Eye Moody had proven to be paranoid and not above considering the crimes of the father as the ones of the son, during classes. His attitude had left little doubt that, if he caught so much as a whiff of illegality from either Draco or his father, he would find immense pleasure in sending either of them to Azkaban. His exact words had been “better to take the whole tree out, when the roots are so rotten”, if Draco recalled correctly. And he had an excellent memory, especially for threat.
Even when the muggle Czar and his family had fallen, the Rasputins had escaped mostly untouched by the revolution. Antoniy and Svetlana’s family fortune outshone the Malfoys’ by an order of magnitude. If their description of their home could be trusted, they lived in a palace which would have dwarfed the Manor, deep into the Ural mountains. And the siblings were not even that exceptional in the social scenery of Durmstrang. That might have been due to the fact that the school had seen quite a number of Rasputins over the years - the siblings' grandfather had apparently been quite prolific, and not all that attached to the concept of monogamy, but what use was it to try and compete with a family whose domain was the size of a small country?
He still felt the niggling suspicion that something wasn't quite right with the situation, and that if he were to know all the details, he would not be quite so happy with Dobby's intervention. It had something to do with the way the elf had refused to give any detail about where and how he had obtained the plant, which bore striking ressemblances to the way he had acted back in second year when Harry asked too many questions. Without the self-harm, obviously, but everything else in his attitude reminded Harry of those first meetings.
On the contrary, Madam Maxim waited until the tables had been cleared, and clapped her big hands to draw the attention of her students. Half of the delegation from Beauxbatons rose and formed a line in front of the Goblet. The first one to put her name in was Fleur Delacour, that part-Veela girl who had such a strong effect on some of the boys, Ron included. When she walked back to Ravenclaw’s table, the young girl who looked so much like her beamed at her, and she returned the gesture by stroking her sister’s hair quickly. It was sweet, especially the way the younger girl glanced adoringly at Fleur. Somehow it softened Harry’s impression of her, of the snobbish girl who had seemed to only find things to sneer at in Hogwarts.
“If anyone has ever complimented on your modesty,” Harry informed him. “I hope you know that they were lying through their teeth.”
“How adequate,” Draco snorted, and immediately pinned it to the lapel of his uniform. “I would probably have been in Slytherin if I had attended Hogwarts.”
They had dessert, and Harry had a hard time choosing which ones to try: on that front he had no hesitation about testing everything, and it all proved immensely good. Treacle tart remained his favourite nonetheless, though he only managed one small piece after stuffing himself with so much food.
The whole Chamber of Secrets fiasco had not gone well for Slytherin. They had been harassed as the most likely suspects for its opening, except for those periods of time when Harry had taken the prime spot, and had closed rank in response.
“You do realize that he’s your rival in this tournament, right? I don’t think he needs your help to beat you. He’s got three years on you, he should be able to handle this by himself. That’s why the bloody goblet chose him, didn’t it?”
“So you will keep your head about you, and not tell the Potter boy of our family’s private affairs?” Lucius said, putting his hands together in front of him. “Including our political inclinations, and any information that may result in negative consequences for us?”
But there wasn’t really anything to fault with the current set, they would go very well with Draco’s own charcoal grey one, and Harry seemed very reluctant at the idea of ordering new ones, so Draco let it rest. He knew how to pick his battles, and teaching Harry to dance would already be an uphill one.
“Mad-Eye Moody? Totally barmy,” Ron confirmed as he set up the pieces to wipe the board with Harry’s arse, as he was wont to do when they played. No matter how hard he tried to teach his best friend the basics of strategy, Harry remained completely impenetrable to the discipline, and only played to entertain him. “Remember what my dad said last time when he said he was attacked? That guy sees enemies everywhere.”
He thrust the small package at Draco’s chest without looking, and only heard the small ‘oomph’ of released air upon impact as he hit too hard, and then the rumble of Draco’s laughter.
The only problems with that arose during the summer holidays. Draco had not become a muggle lover by any stretch of the imagination, but he had never been much of a people lover in the first place, pureblood or otherwise.
“What can I say?” Draco shrugged, looking tall and handsome and without a care in the world. “I always make an impression, wherever I go.”
“No!” Draco protested. “No, I really enjoyed last night.” This time he managed to get a hold of Harry’s hand, and Harry looked at it, the pale white skin around his own brown one, and couldn’t find it in him to escape it. “I really did. I just- I just thought maybe it hadn’t been the case for you.”
“Walk me to the gate?” Draco asked, tugging his hand, and Harry nodded, not trusting his voice at that particular moment.
Viktor did spend a reasonable amount of time in the library at Durmstrang, as any top student tended to do, but he had never been a full on library rat. Two days ago he had even rejected Draco’s offer to go for a fly in favor of books, of all things. Draco had had to go one on one against Potter in a seeker’s game, and the kid had absolutely whooped his ass at it. He even had had the gall to laugh at Draco’s lack of skill at spotting the – incredibly tiny and fast, Draco wished to point out – snitch, like everyone could be genius teenage seekers like him and Krum. At least he hadn’t been brooding in silence about all the woes in his life, which had been really tiring on Draco, really, what with all the negativity, and that was the only reason he had let Potter snort at him without retaliation.
"I might..." Draco said, and he sounded frustrated again, like he was fighting with himself. "I might have mispoken, before. I didn't mean to imply you couldn't relate to my... issues, because your parents were dead, but because we were not raised in the same environment. There are things I can't explain, that would make it very problematic to involve myself with you."
Harry gave him a bright smile and, quick as a Snitch, he darted in and kissed Draco on the cheek before turning on his heels and disappearing into the castle.
“Draco, you were about to start arguing with a first year you don’t even know for the sake of annoying him,” Harry sighed, dropping onto a chair. “I’m not asking you to be nice to Ron, just… maybe don’t antagonize him so much?” He raised hopeful eyes to him, which absolutely counted as cheating.
Harry really had no answer to this one, if his best friend really did not realize what he had said wrong, so he didn’t say anything and shrugged.
“Apparently Karkaroff will announce something of magnitude for this year, according to this inselaffe,” Antoniy said, gesturing at Draco. “But he refuses to tell me anything more than that.”
“They fill people’s, mostly girls, heads with that silly idea that your mark is only about the person who you’re supposed to love romantically for the rest of your life,” she would always lament. “When really, every research done on the subject shows that they’re linked to reciprocal impact of the greatest magnitude on each of the partner’s lives. Lots of soulmates bonds have never been romantic at all.”
Ron had not made much of a secret of his disapproval of Harry’s friendship with Draco. He had become much more tolerant of the Slytherins and Durmstrang students under Hermione’s impulsion, but apparently he drew the line at the Malfoy family. Harry thought it might have to do with the fact that Mr Malfoy still made it its goal to complicate Mr Weasley’s professional life as much as possible, but Hermione reckoned it had more to do with his subconscious fear that Draco might steal Harry from him, especially since they had become friendly when Ron was behaving like a git and ignoring Harry. She said it made him feel inadequate that Draco, who had not known Harry at all then, had been much more supportive than him, who was supposedly his best friend.
"No!" Draco said with some force, his fingers tightening around Harry's shoulder, where they had dropped off. "That's what I wanted to say. I want to be with you, if... if you're still interested."
But Draco loved his parents dearly, and had no wish to fight them for the sake of people he did not even know. So he remained silent, and always managed to switch the conversation to another track when the subject came up. Of course his mother noticed it almost immediately: she had been the one to train him in the art of manipulating the conversation to his advantage. She was too well bred, however, to comment on it, and may have sensed his opinion did not align with hers anymore on the matter. Lucius thought nothing of it, probably because he was too used to being the centre of attention to bother attending to the whims of its periphery.
“Yeah, and we’ll be lucky to see snow in January here. Oh, just take it off, Svetlana,” the boy snapped, snatching the girl’s hat off her head.
“Can you tell me who in Slytherin you’ve seen using dark magic, ever?” Hermione said, snapping her book close.
Harry could feel his face burn, from his throat to the root of his hair, in a mix of deep embarrassment and anger. Was he really that obvious about his crushes? First Ron, now Draco, was the whole school aware of who he fancied, for heaven’s sake?
It was a complete lie. Harry had thought he might ask Cho for the Yule Ball, and when he had finally screwed up the courage, it had only been to see her walking hand in hand with his co-Champion. He had almost faceplanted in his hurry to flee the area, and a lot of people had witnessed it, including Draco and Ron. Ron also teased him a bit about it, but it didn’t have the same undercurrent of meanness that when Draco did it: the Durmstrang student almost seemed angry about it, while Ron simply empathized, since he had not found a partner either yet.
“They are reinstating the Triwizard Tournament this year,” Lucius said. Draco almost choked on a potato.
That said, she stormed off the common room to her dormitory, leaving Ron sputtering in fury. He turned to Harry, his anger leaving place to bewilderment.
“A necessary lie,” Lucius said calmly. “You were so young, and I could not leave your mother alone to raise you.”
“I guess the spell picks up on intention,” she said, before trailing off. “Oh, damn you, Harry, now I’ll have to research this.”
This year, though, Draco had managed to force one sixth year and two seventh years into listening to the whole speech, just so they would not miss the announcement he had hinted at. That took some skill – and prior access to prime information – and he would be sure to brag about it at the Political club later. The club had a standing tradition of trying to trick other students into uncomfortable or humourous situations without ever lying, and this would put him in a good position to win this year’s contest. Older students were worth more points, as they all knew about the competition, and most of them had identified the members of the club, so they took extra care around them. Getting Svetlana, the current president of the club, was a crowning achievement, and Draco had managed it on the very first day. He would no longer be able to compete after the end of October, so he had to give it its best effort until then.
“I can’t believe they are forcing us to dance,” Harry complained. “I thought the Tournament only meant mortal danger, not socially embarassing situations.”
“I don’t care,” Harry said in a hard voice he barely recognized as his own. “I get why you thought I wouldn’t understand. What would I know about having parents, right?”
Plus, you know, of course teenagers are going to track down anything you forbid them from reading. Especially if they're pissed off at a headmaster who abolished school breaks and plays obvious favorites.
“Harry Potter,” she said, her accent making his name sound like it had twice as many ‘r’s as it usually did. “Vy are you and Draco not speaking anymore? He’s being a pain to be around.”
. But when Karkaroff gestured his precious student forward, Harry understood why he was so solicitous to him. And if he hadn’t, the way Ron’s nails immediately dug into his forearm as he breathed an ecstatic “Harry… It’s Viktor Krum!” would have erased any doubt.
Harry shook it warily, glad that they were both wearing their gloves and that Malfoy wouldn’t be able to feel his clammy skin.
Draco was sixteen. Had he not been attending Durmstrang, and soulmarked, Narcissa would have started setting up things during her tea parties to put word about that the Malfoy Heir had started looking. The absence of school breaks at Durmstrang would have pushed things back till he finished his seventh year, but there was nothing to be done about the soulmark, really. No well-bred pureblood would start the lengthy courtship process with an unsettled mark. It was not done.
Harry blushed and looked at his feet, resolved not to say a word more. At least if he stayed silent he wouldn’t be putting his foot in his mouth.
“Well, yes,” Draco said. “Diggory’s pureblood and his parents both have important positions in the Ministry, he’s probably attended his fair share of Ministry functions. Viktor’s mother is a diplomat, she obviously taught him how to behave in good society. Not that you would know it from his conversational skills. And Beauxbatons teaches social etiquette as part of its core curriculum ever since Madame Maxime became the headmistress.”
Lucius frowned mightily at him, but Narcissa laid a long-fingered hand on his forearm and said: “We understand, dear. We are just worried about you. This timing is most unfortunate.”
So it rankled that there would be lies between them, and lies there obviously were. Either Narcissa hadn’t know the truth about Dobby, and Lucius had lied to her, or she had, and that was even worse because then that meant she had lied to
“Listen, Mother,” he said, and took a large inspiration to drive off the edge of desperation from his voice. “You said you would leave me to my own devices, and that I was only required to think of the family before committing too deeply. I went one step further, but it didn’t take. We can just stick to the original plan: I’ll tread carefully, and we’ll play it by ear if it survives my return to Durmstrang.”
“I wouldn’t ‘ave cared,” a soft voice said from behind them. “I’m just so glad I can come to the Ball.”
. Yet even Viktor Krum seemed interested in what she was saying, and Draco Malfoy was listening to her in such a focused way it must have been uncomfortable.
“It is very sad,” Draco agreed, because Daphne was obviously expecting an answer. “But whether Potter killed him, or helped him escape, it sounds like a lot of work for such a young kid. What does that fearsome sorcerer look like, hum? He must be at least twelve feet tall,” he joked.
“The charm work on your badge is really precise,” Granger said bravely, after long minutes of tense silence.
She looked pointedly at his hands, clentched tightly against the rail once again. He let go, and clutched them open and close a few times to get the blood circulating again.
Svetlana’s eyebrows rose so high they could have flown off her forehead, and she looked distinctly unimpressed.
“Oh, well. I mean, we could always get a hold of women’s robes and one of us could wear them, if you really feel that’s an indispensable part of the process,” he said, and Harry could feel his whole face and neck turning hot in response to the smirk overtaking Draco’s lips.
“I-” Harry cleared his throat when his voice came out embarassingly small and high pitched. “Sure, I guess.”
“She doesn’t really hex people without a reason, so I doubt she was the only culprit when she got caught,” Hermione continued. “And even if she had been, that punishment was completely over the top. She could have gotten seriously hurt!”
Rasputin had less qualms: she yanked the door open, pushed Harry in, and slammed the door shut on his back.
He broke the surface a few moments after his gills and webs had disappeared, and took a great inspiration with shaking relief, before checking for his two charges. The sleeping enchantment must have been tied to their presence underwater, because they were waking up, and Harry crossed glances with Draco almost immediately. He recoiled and let go of him, surprised, and tried to think about how to get away, when a great ruckus saved him the burden:
Harry deflated. Of course he couldn’t have known: Harry had only told the Gryffindors, and even they didn’t believe him. The Hufflepuffs thought he was trying to steal Cedric’s thunder, the Slytherins hated him on principle, and the Ravenclaws either didn’t care or sided with the rest of the school, but no one had even asked him what had happened. Of course the foreign students had heard nothing more about it.
“Well, no one knows what happened to Buckbeak, either, and he disappeared at the same time!” Daphne defended herself. “Remember, Mr Crabbe was very displeased that he would not be punished for hurting Vincent.”
“Good,” Harry said, smiling at him, which, unfair, much? “I think they’re calling us for the first dance,” he added, making a face.
Harry feels even more betrayed by the powers that be because of the Yule Ball than he ever did on discovering a Dark Wizard had put him on his hit list before he was even born.
“Draco dear,” his mother said in a soft voice. “He is no friend of the Dark Lord, which makes him unlikely to feel much sympathy for us.”
- Svetlana chewing out Draco for how he dealt with Harry in the previous chapter is a bit of an authorial mouthpiece, but I really don't want people romanticizing this: this is not the way a healthy, respectful relationship should go. Draco and Harry are very young and immature, and it's showing.
Diggory went first, against a Swedish Short-Snout. He took one look around him, spotted a large rock, and transfigured it into a dog. It started barking and jumping wildly at the dragon, who turned her large head to consider this new addition with narrowed eyes and fuming nostrils. Meanwhile, Diggory sneaked around her, careful not to touch the tailwhich curled protectively around the nest as he bent to retrieve the golden egg. He drew back, and was almost far enough to bolt out of the arena, when something must have caught the dragon’s attention, because she swiveled around, spotted him with the egg, and breathed flames at him. A great gasp went over the stands, but Diggory had the excellent reflexes of a Quidditch player, and he jumped sideways, rolling to the floor out of the arena, the egg still clutched in his arms. When he got up, they could see that the side of his face had been burnt, but it was nothing that a good Healer couldn’t fix. He was done with his first Task.
“He went back to his parents for the hols, you said?” Ron said, as if it were a sufficient explanation. When both Hermione and Harry kept looking at him uncomprehendingly, he sighed: “Don’t you remember what I told you about the Malfoys? His dad was a Death Eater, for Merlin’s sake. He probably got chewed out for spending so much time with you and inviting you to the Yule Ball. Now he’s realized that of course you’re You-Know-Who’s enemy, which doesn’t make you a friend of his family, and he’s keeping his distance.”
“Trust me,” he said with a smile and a wink. Then, looking past Harry’s head, he said, his voice colder: “Hello, Malfoy. Don’t worry, I’m finished. He’s all yours.”
Oh. Well, that was much better. At least he would return to Durmstrang for his seventh year. He wasn’t even sure how his curriculum so far would have integrated with Hogwarts’, anyways. The focus of the two schools were completely different.
His worries about Sirius might have returned despite all the convenient distraction the arrival of the delegations provided, but their last class, the one that would be shortened so the whole school could stand in rows and try to look like actual teenagers rather than wild animals – those had been McGonagall’s exact words during Transfiguration – was Potions. There was no greater happiness than a shorter Potions class, and nothing could dim it, especially when Snape had been in such a foul mood and threatened left and right to poison someone so they could learn the importance of brewing antidotes properly. Harry thought he might even be able to use the memory for a Patronus. He would have to try that.
By the time the eleven challengers were selected, Krum was listed as the favorite in Kaija’s betting pool, with Svetlana as a close second. Karkaroff had taken Draco appart to remind him to act in a manner befitting of the scion of two old pureblood lines, probably because Rasputin had been caught reading Marx’ Manifesto to unsuspecting first years, and his excuses that he was researching the history of his grandfather’s downfall convinced exactly no one. And Draco’s soulmark had gone from a vague smudge to something very tangible.
With a few swirls of her wand, she had the fraying ends of the robes all nice and neat, and the colour set to a nice sapphire blue. It was a bit loud for Draco’s taste, but actually worked quite well with Weasley’s skin tone and red hair. Fortunately, the cut of the robes was very traditional in style, which helped mask the little imperfections owing to their obvious age and wear.
The Durmstrang delegation started moving towards the castle at Dumbledore’s behest, and as the group approached them, Harry heard a voice, smooth and jeering:
- some background lore on soulmarks, because we haven't seen them in a while. Might be a little repetitive for those who read in one go, don't hesitate to tell me if that's the case.
Soulmarks could take years to settle into a proper form, and only once they were, would the bond between the partners be effective. It always necessicated large, impactful events involving profund changes in both partners, and sometimes that took the form of life-threatening situations. Rarely, overall, but often enough that it was a major concern for his mother.
Yes, a descendant of Rasputin declaiming Marx is my idea of humor. You might have noticed that I'm not taking this fic 100% seriously.
He could also have told them about how muggle technology sometimes rivaled magic. Not everything, of course, but some. They could message one another instantly with phones instead of relying on owls, and he was sure his mother would have enjoyed that immensely, if it had not been muggle, and if phones worked in Durmstrang. They didn’t, Kaija Krysi had tried, but what an invention. And their flying apparatus looked much more comfortable for long distance travel than any broom. It was no international portkey, to be sure, but there was only so much you could take with you with a portkey.
Draco reluctantly let himself be led away, followed by Ron and Svetlana, Gabrielle chattering about how the two top students of each year had been allowed by Madame Maxime to come to Hogwarts for the year, and she had aced the exam for her year, so she could see her sister win the Tournament now and wasn’t that great?
“I can make you one, if you want,” Draco offered, still trying to catch Harry’s eye, who kept on glowering at the floor.
“No I won’t,” he said gloomily, looking at his upturned hands on his lap. “I behaved like a twat, and everyone saw. No one’s going to want to go with me. And all the pretty girls have already been asked, anyways.”
“No,” Narcissa sighed. “You are not. But you know how important it is for us to stand together as a family. We cannot afford to be seen as divided. Some people don’t know any better than to believe everything they read in the Prophet.”
“Probably means it isn’t, don’t you think?” Harry said venomously. “And you’re still better informed than I am, because he hasn’t seen fit to talk to me since the day he left for the holidays.”
A lot of events from the books won't be described, because you all already know what happens, and, well, I'm only interested in Draco flirting with Harry, basically.
“You told stories about his exploits, dear, you did not say you were spending time with him and taking him to the Yule Ball,” Narcissa tutted. “Obfuscation of the truth is still a form of lying.”
Of course not. People as well connected as the Malfoys would probably have been told before the text had even found its way to the printing press.
“Dumbledore may be a fool,” his father said, “but there is no denying that many professors at Hogwarts are extremely competent. Maybe Severus will have time to tutor you, with any luck.”
In the end, it was Rasputin herself who came to Harry, around the end of January. She cornered him as he stepped out of the library, where he had spent two hours looking for a way to bloody breathe underwater for an hour. He hadn’t found one, and the sound of Krum’s fans giggling had grated on his nerves too much to continue the endeavour.
Harry cheered avidly when Cedric’s name came out for Hogwarts, jumping to his feet with the rest of the Gryffindor table as Hufflepuff gave a huge hurrah. Cedric stood, laughing and golden, and waved at everyone as he made his way to the room where the Champions were to gather.
“No, not yet,” Harry said, who had only opened it once and then not touched it again after getting his eardrums and almost those of everyone in Gryffindor Tower pierced by the high-pitched wails.
Draco had a particular interest in Potions, and the promise of a man of Severus Snape’s calibre teaching him on the subject was more than enough to perfectly reconcile him with the idea of spending a year away from Durmstrang.
None of his students looked in the least in need of being even warmer, and certainly none of them looked
They were much closer to each other than Harry had realized: from such a short distance, Draco’s eyes looked a bit blue, rather than the usual steely grey, and Harry could make out the eyelashes, so fair and fine it almost looked like the Durmstrang boy had none, from afar.
Draco resisted the urge to close his eyes in despair. He had hoped for a few minutes of prevarication before they got to the heart of the matter, but he had obviously underestimated Narcissa’s anxiety on the subject. The very Floo call she was making should have discouraged him of the notion, anyways: his mother hated the practice, which she judged undignified.
One thing he had not anticipated, however, was how hard it would be to hide his nascent relationship with the Boy-Who-Lived from his parents. He rather thought that they would approve of the acquaintance – Harry Potter was a useful connection to have, of course – but a romantic involvement was less likely to be looked upon favorably. If Draco had not been soulmarked, that would have been one thing, but a mark changed everything. There could be no innocent flirting until his soulmarked had been identified, in Lucius and Narcissa’s mind. They had to be sure of the partner, of the bond, before Draco could be sent off courting amongst the pureblood families. There was no fighting a soulbond, only its nature: Draco was expected not to form a romantic relationship with his soulmarked if they were not of sufficiently good standing.
Well, sure, she was beautiful, but not enough to act like a fool, in Harry’s opinion. He exchanged a glance with Hermione, who rolled her eyes and shrugged, mouthing a very judgmental “boys” at him. Sometimes he wondered if she remembered that he was one, too.
“Nozing,” she said. “Zeir translation spell is messing viz our accents and Drasha zinks it is all very droll.”
This is what uncooperative characters look like. I had planned this fic as light-hearted and fun, mostly, then Draco decided he had to be a drama queen.
“But she stopped after a while,” she said when Ron pointed that out during breakfast the next day. “Sure, she was a bully that first year, but ever since second year she’s been mostly focused on defending her House.”
“He’s also fourteen, Drasha,” she pointed out. “You’d better not get used to dealing viz him zat vay, if you really like him.”
Draco beamed at him, and Harry had been a fool to think he would manage to regain his bearings after pushing out his answer. That smile was
The more Karkaroff tried to convince his charges that blood purity and the Dark Arts were the last bastion against the savagery of the muggle world, the more they became convinced that the muggle world was absolutely fascinating.
With his father, and knowing Karkaroff, it could mean anything from a bribe to full-on threats. Well, Draco would certainly shed no tears over his headmaster’s discomfort, that was for sure.
“What? From Beauxbatons, then?” Then, when Harry kept on avoiding his eyes: “Not from Durmstrang, surely?”
The students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang were scheduled to arrive on the 30th of October. Harry had all but forgotten about it when he sat down in the midst of the excited buzz in the Great Hall that morning. Hedwig had just arrived with a letter from Sirius, confirming, as Harry had feared, that his godfather was on British soil once again, or would be very soon. The twins were planning some mischief involving someone outside of Hogwarts, but they were the only one talking about something else than the upcoming arrival. Even the Slytherin table looked agitated, though in a quieter manner than the other three. Some of the younger ones had not yet managed the dignified bearing of the sixth and seventh years, and Harry stifled a laugh watching them try to emulate the behaviour.
Harry mumbled something he couldn’t quite catch but was ready to wager went along the lines of cursing the whole damn Tournament, including Yule Ball and everyone who had ever been involved in its organization. Draco couldn’t fault him for that.
Harry gulped and nodded, raising his eyes slowly to meet Ron’s. His best friend blinked at him a few times before an expression of horror came over his face and he launched himself back in his chair.
"True, that," Ron nodded sagely, though Hermione looked indignant at the way they could so easily let go of an unanswered mystery.
Viktor might have been calm and introverted, but he had a competitive streak that would have easily covered the distance between his home country and Durmstrang. Wherever it was. One did not become the youngest seeker ever to catch the snitch in a World Cup by playing sedately.
“That castle is not so big that we would not cross paths in a whole week,” he said, pointing her fork at her. “He’s definitely avoiding me, and I would like to know how! I had to spend most of my time in the Potions lab to manage this, and he doesn’t have anywhere like that to hide in.”
And I just love Svetlana Rasputin. She's the most over the top bitch out there and she just doesn't give a shit, it's so beautiful.
Harry turned. Draco stood behind them, glowering at Cedric with a hard set to his mouth. The Hufflepuff gave Harry a wry smile and took off in the direction of the castle.
“Oh, him? That’s Lucius Malfoy. He’s some big shot in the Ministry, and in the Board of Governors, I think. Old pureblood family, a bit too obsessed with it. Everyone knows he was a Death Eater, but he managed to get himself out of trouble by pretending he had been controlled by You-Know-Who,” he whispered. “He even sent his son to Durmstrang, because apparently Hogwarts is not good enough for dear Draco. Not enough Dark Arts, you see. Well rid of him, we are. That git’s probably spoiled beyond belief, and he would have been a Slytherin, no doubt. Look at his mum going about him.”
Harry had fled the lab as soon as he had been able to push Draco off him after that, ignoring the damage he had caused. Draco could deal with it, for all he cared. The corridor had been empty: evidently Rasputin had assumed they would be mature enough to actually talk it out without needing her supervision. She had been wrong, about pretty much everything.
The girl obviously did not care a fig about the sport, but if entertaining a Quidditch star enhanced her status, she certainly wouldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth. Draco, who was pretty sure he had seen a redheaded Gryffindor close to fainting when Viktor had walked by him, thought that, even if she did not appreciate the situation for its own sake, she sure understood its sheer social value.
Harry, Ron and Hermione considered the gnarly ball of gillyweed with expressions ranging from disgusted – on Ron's part – to excited – on Hermione's part, who was leafing through
“Really? You lucky bastard, that’s so unfair! So I’m the only one without a date, is that it?” Ron exclaimed. “So who is it?”
had never been accused of anything and almost sentenced to Azkaban. And yet here they were, discussing how
“I’m not sure I’m interested in any of Weasley’s opinions on myself,” Draco said, resisting the urge to push back the curl.
“Blimey. Er, thank you, I guess? I mean, you were pretty insulting about it,” here he glared at Draco, which, hey, unfair, Svetlana had also been quite vocal about her disgust. “But this is much better than before.”
“I don’t know,” Malfoy answered, and then there was the sound of someone running after him. “Potter! Hey, Potter, wait!” Malfoy called.
Harry didn’t feel like explaining that Petunia and Vernon were unlikely to dance at all, that Dudley probably despised the notion, and that even if they had, somehow, known how to, they would hardly have been enthusiastic about imparting their knowledge to him. The only times the Dursleys had taught him anything, it had been so he could do more chores around the house.
“It might have been mentionned once or twice,” Draco said airily. “But you know what your advantage is?”
Draco wasn’t, as it turned out: he simply kept his hand around Harry’s, tugging him slightly to lead him back towards the lake. They stayed on the far end, away from the rest of the students, and talked until it was time for Draco to catch the Hogwarts Express, which he was really excited about.
Draco searched for Harry, but it seemed the trio of friends had used the general chaos of first discovery to abscond, and he could observe none of them. The Gryffindor table seemed to be rallying from the shock – for all that they lacked in precaution, they reacted quickly, and a lot of them had taken to glaring in response to the inquisitive glances turned to them. Was it in solidarity to Harry, or a natural closing of ranks at the perceived aggression, Draco couldn’t have said, but he approved. It made it harder for people to realize that the main object of the turmoil had disappeared.
“Plus, if she was, how come she’s not raising a big stink about this?” Ron said, pointing his fork at Hermione. “She would never pass up the opportunity to cause trouble for a Hogwarts professor.”
There was no good way to explain what had happened in this context, so Harry didn’t try. Seamus would have twisted his words to fit his narrative, and he was too busy being chewed out by Hermione about framing girls as fishes to be captured to attend to any convoluted statement about the truth. Plus, Cho was indeed really pretty. So Harry satisfied himself with patting the front of his robes dry with a towel, half heartedly listening to Dean ribbing Seamus for ever thinking the French girls would be interested in his pale Irish arse, and Neville timidly interjecting that seventeen year-olds were unlikely to even notice their fourteen year-old bunch. This last part made sense, in Harry’s opinion, but both Ron and Seamus vehemently opposed the idea. This brought Lavander and Parvarti into the fray, to cackle at them for ever entertaining the idea, and only McGonagall shooing them out to their first class prevented a food fight.
And there wasn’t: his parents were afraid that he had a soulbond with Harry Potter, of all people, but there would be no knowing it until his mark settled, and that could take years. If he wasn’t, better to let their relationship run its course: they were young, and unlikely to remain together for any significant amount of time. If he was, there would be no avoiding it anyways: the romantic aspect might disappear, but the impact of a soulbond couldn’t be escaped, try as one might. Draco knew his parents would come to the same conclusion quickly enough.
“How did you even manage zat?” she frowned. “Last I knew, you vere closer to being brutally murdered zan silly flirting.”
“I really hate being Harry Potter,” he finally said after a few minutes of staring at his breath puff white before him, while Draco stared at him.
“Well, we do have our fair bunch of nasty tossers in Slytherin, though,” Ron shrugged. “Just calling it as I see it.”
Durmstrang and Beauxbatons arrive, Harry makes a fool of himself, and a fur hat gets stolen. Not necessarilly in this order.
Harry saw his friend’s face close itself at that remark, and knew there was no way this conversation would end up in a nice manner, but Ron was already launched.
Harry doesn't know what happened during the winter holidays. All he understands is that Draco wants nothing to do with him anymore.
“They are,” Narcissa agreed, because she had grown with the stories as well, though no Black had been marked in generations. “But it changes everything.”
“Well, there’s always an exception to every rule,” he said slowly. Harry could see the idea was disturbing him, and Hermione had already given him enough of a chewing. Ron would mull over it and come to his own conclusion if given some time.
“You,” Harry gulped. “You, er, you want to go to the ball with me?” he whispered, his throat dry and clamped.
"I think you said more than I care to hear," Harry replied, unable to keep the bitterness out of his voice even after weeks of mulling over their last conversation, or maybe because of it.
“You’ll live,” the guy said, rolling his eyes. They drew to Harry’s height, and just at the moment where the boy took his own hat off, and his pale blond hair glinted in the moonlight. He recognized it in a jolt of surprise, and then the face under it, slightly turned towards him with a laugh on it as Draco Malfoy, the boy from the top box at the Quidditch World Cup, held the two hats out of reach of his friend’s grasp.
He had just reached the conclusion that he should be done with it and open it, when the Hall erupted into a great brouhaha that penetrated even his suspicion-fuelled trepidation, and he raised his head to take a bewildered look around him. What he saw didn’t really help: students of all Houses were nudging each other and showing themselves a journal, apparently discussing something written large and bold on the front page.
"Zank you, 'Arry," she said tearfully above her sister's hair. "Reelly, zank you. I zought she waz dead, and zey wouldn't tell me aneezing. I waz so afraid."
But Hogwarts it was, which pretty much ensured his partner to be a crony of Dumbledore’s or someone wholly unconnected: after all, Draco had been introduced as a kid to all the people in Hogwarts who could be considered good company, and his mark had never manifested.
"That's what Dobby said," Harry sighed, poking at the herb? algae? dejectedly. "But thank you for the mental image, that's really helpful."
He must have missed the exact moment Karkaroff switched from his usual spiel about Durmstrang’s greatness, and his own, and how their bloodlines made them better than everyone else, to the actual interesting news. The headmaster never made any changes to his welcome speech, and the only one who actually paid any attention to it were the first years, trying their best not to look bored to the point of tears as they waited desperately to be freed to go to the dining hall.
“He’s Harry Potter, Mother,” Draco sighed. “People were always going to do that. It changes nothing.”
“Thank you, Professor Snape,” Draco said in a subdued voice, and then proceeded to compile an exhaustive list of all the swearwords he knew in as many languages as possible – then creating new ones when he started repeating himself – until the time came.
They had warded the whole Task area, so no one could intervene to help the Champions during the trial, except for the jury if worse came to worse. Forget helping the Champions, though, Draco would have hexed the shit out of those five nutjobs, and the only thing preventing him from doing so were the bloody wards.
He would come to rue his words in the upcoming weeks, though neither he nor Harry realized it at the time, even when Hermione’s eyes glittered.
“Plus, it’s no use worrying about it. You’ll definitely meet them and know who they are at some point. That’s sort of the point of it all,” Ron added, gesturing at Harry’s hip.
“No, Harry, no,” he moaned, throwing his arm across his eyes. “Really? That ponce Malfoy?” he added, taking a peek from under his wrist.
“Oh?” Malfoy said with a raised eyebrow and a shit-eating grin, looking very pleased with himself. “Famous, am I?”
“Do not let your students freeze, Olympe,” Dumbledore said with a gesture towards the castle. “Let them get inside before they turn into popsicles.”
“Even if you did,” he stopped as a few bottles started rattling on a nearby shelf. “Even if you did, it wouldn’t change anything, Harry. I can’t be seen with you anymore.”
“What? You’ll be leaving me alone with Rasputin, Draco?” Kaija exclaimed, her hand on her heart. “How will I survive your absence?”
“Erm… I got you something,” he said as Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “It’s not much but… it made me think of you.”
Harry gulped, and Draco had to resist the urge to do the same. That woman was scary. She could even have given Blacklund a run for his money.
“Poor little Antoniy can’t handle curiosity or anything that takes longer than half a minute,” Draco cooed, with a meaningful glance at his roommate unpressed uniform. “And
Harry didn’t know what he had been expecting about Draco’s return, but it hadn’t been Draco stepping off the Hogwarts Express, taking a look at his face and proceeding to hug him while mumbling some curses under his breath. It had been a good surprise, though, right until Draco had backed off, and left without another word, surrounded by a cloud of dark mood. Harry had been left standing on the platform alone, feeling all kinds of lost, and even Hermione and Ron getting down from the train didn’t help as much as it usually did.
Draco didn’t even realize his soulmark had started changing until he was on the ship to Durmstrang. There was no way to know when he had met his future bond partner, which pissed him off beyond reason, and no way to announce it to his parents, which was actually a nice compensation for having missed what would have been, technically speaking, the most magical moment of his life. Not everyone was marked by fate, after all.
It was, indeed, quite big, and filled with Beauxbatons students in silky blue robes. With the Hogwarts students that were following on their heels, the entrance hall, large as it was, was starting to be filled to the brim with excited teenagers.
She was almost animated by the end of her speech. That sounded very much like a good old fashioned crush to Draco’s ears, who considered himself quite the expert on the subject after three years of dealing with Rasputin’s pathetic pining for Kaija Krysi.
By the second week, he had demonstrated the three Unforgivable Curses to half the school, and hadn’t that been a truly pleasant lesson. Now Harry had a spell name to go with his nightmare of green light and motherly pleas, which he felt he could have done without, all in all. Neville had gotten out of the classroom in an even worse state than Harry himself, and quite a few students wore haunted looks in the halls for the last half of September. They all wondered whose brillant idea it had been to allow the mad new teacher to demonstrate curses which had last been employed on a large scale during the Wizarding War, from which quite a few students bore familial trauma. Now they had a much clearer idea of how it had all happened. Such a treat. At least the younger years had been spared the education: Moody must have found something else to teach them, because no one from the first to third year had been subjected to his little sound and light show with the fantastic twitching spiders.
Harry was not having a good day. If he was honest with himself, his bad stroke had started the day before, when Draco Malfoy had smiled and waved at him and instead of returning the gesture like a normal person, Harry’s first reflex had been to dive under the table. He had repressed the instinct, and only averted his gaze, but still, when he had risked another glance back at the Slytherin table, the Durmstrang student had resumed his conversation with the eldest Greengrass sister. Sure, she was pretty enough, if you liked the expressionless sort, but she seemed so
Antoniy elbowed him once again. Draco repressed a wince and turned his head slighty to mouth a “what?” behind clenched teeth.
“Says you,” Harry muttered sullenly, eyes fixed on his feet once again as they went through another repetition. “I’m just going to fall on my ass. I’m sure the other Champions know how to dance.”
“You know the Prefect bathroom on the fifth floor? Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password's
“Maybe we can get him to play a match against us,” Draco said. “We might have enough players to make a team depending on who Karkaroff picks. What do you think, Krum? Want to see if the saviour of the Wizarding World can hold his own against your skill?”
His parents had probably never entertained the idea that his heir could be connected to anything less than a pureblood, or, in an extremety, to a half-blood, and would accept his partner if they fit these categories – Draco shuddered to think of what would happen should his soulmarked be muggleborn or, Merlin forbade, a muggle. If his partner was a woman, he would probably be allowed to marry them, should they feel like it, but a man would never do: you couldn’t produce an heir with a man. You did not marry a man, just like you did not marry women from low social standing: at most, you set them up in a nice little house and visited them quietly after the birth of your first child, while your wife turned a blind eye to it.
in Slytherin ones, up to and including some of Potter’s Housemates. Draco had taken one look at the way the boy’s faced had closed on spotting it, and felt like accio
Harry stopped. It took Draco a few meters to realize the fact, and when he did, he threw a furious glare at Harry, who couldn’t help but take a step back.
“What does she mean by that? I’m not as bad as they are, right? You agree with me, don’t you, that studying the Dark Arts is not a good thing?”
He dearly wanted to remind her that she was talking to the best friends of two of her sister’s rivals, who probably wished for her defeat, but Harry’s glare promised dire retributions if he dared to antagonize the girl again.
So Draco, each year, only had six weeks to spend with his parents. The first years had been very hard in that respect: he loved them dearly, and they him, especially his mother. Narcissa Malfoy had sent him letters, chocolates, sweets and presents almost everyday until he started his fourth year, when she had managed to reduce her frequency to twice a week. Draco suspected his father’s intercession in that matter, and was silently grateful. As much as he enjoyed his mother’s packages, passing for a spoiled child did not fly well in Durmstrang.
Then again, the record track for the position hinted about the kind of pickings Dumbledore was probably confronted to. Their only decent teacher so far had been a werewolf, and Lupin had explained in so many delicate words that werewolves were amongst the most undesirable employees in the wizarding world. How many applicants were there that Dumbledore had to go and ask someone who didn’t have any other option for employment than take the cursed position? Probably none: after all, the previous two tenants of the position had died horribly, and been Obliviated so thoroughly they didn’t even remember their own name. It did not make for a great advertisement.
“Nothing we can do about it,” Lucius said, brusquely. “But I expect you will take care to stay out of harm’s way.”
“Is he a good seeker?” Viktor asked, because of course that was the question that came to his mind first.
Harry can't say he likes the new Defense teacher much. It might have something to do with the fact that he uses curses supposed to send him directly to Azkaban on fourteen-year olds.
He had met the man once, whose head had been as empty as his words were colorful. One had to admire his skill at obfuscating the truth, though, because no one suspected his books as filled with lies. Svetlana agreed with him that at least some of those stories sounded far-fetched, and it was impossible than one man had done it all, if only because some events he described seemed to have occured at the same time but at very different locations. They were part of different books, though, and Draco had only examined them in depth because he was a suspicious grinch, according to Antoniy, and Svetlana because she loved nothing more than looking up obscure details that interested no one else but her – again, according to Antoniy.
“Sophie Parkinson seemed to think you had struck up a friendship with the Potter boy,” she said, watching him over the rim of her wine glass as she took a sip. “You did not say anything about that.”
“Well, get on with it. If you’re not back in the Tower in ten minutes, you’ll get a detention,” she said, walking away. “And Mr Potter?” she added over her shoulder. “I will know.”
“Chess?” Harry proposed, and was glad to see Ron’s relieved smile at the offer. “Isn’t that new Defense professor weird, though?”
Harry was a Gryffindor through and through, though, and a few meters from where the horseless carriages awaited to take the students to the station, he tugged them to a stop.
“You do realize that Hogwarts is hidden as well? Seriously, you should really know at least this about your own school,” Hermione sighed. “Otherwise, we would get muggles wandering around the grounds all the time. The difference is that Durmstrang is even hidden to wizards, and only students and teachers can see it. I think they’ve even got a special way to get there, so that there is no way to track the location by following the people being transported. The books were a bit unclear about this, though.”
The last quote from sadfishkid's illustration of Durmstrang!Draco is coming up next chapter, and peeps, I can't wait for you to see it. There's so much flirting and so much awkwardness, I love my little disaster bi Harry.
After that, that awful article by Rita Skeeter about Hagrid had come out, and Harry had had other things to worry about: it took him one week to realize that he had not seen hair nor hide from Draco Malfoy since that hug on the platform.
He had found the time to dry off and clean himself up, and not a single of his hair was out of place as he frowned at Harry.
Fortunately for him, Draco was nothing if not resourceful – and well connected. It had taken barely more than fifty minutes to convince Severus Snape of taking him as a sort of apprentice for the year, forty of which had been spent proving he could brew a perfect antidote to common poisons in half the usual required time.
“Potter? More like underfed and ungroomed,” Pansy said acidly. “It’s a wonder whether his muggles even fed him anything before he got here. Look at him, a breeze could knock him over.”
It lasted all but a moment, though, before he was suddenly yanked away from her, and he heard Draco's voice, cold as ice, above his head.
"Fair warning," the Durmstrang boy said, some of the more usual undertones seeping back into the smile, as his hand crept closer to Harry's neck, his second one finding a place on his hip. "I'm going to kiss you."
“Draco, I have grand news,” his mother said, all prim excitement as they sat down to dinner in mid-August. She leaned over the table to grasp his hand in hers, and gave it a light squeeze. Draco glanced at his father, who sat very straight at the head of the table with the satisfied air of a kneazle.
His parents, however, firmly believed in the doctrine of pureblood superiority, passed down through generations in the House of Black, and quite enthusiastically, though nowhere near as fanatically, down the Malfoy line. Of course wizards were superior to muggles, they had magic, and of course purebloods were superior to half-bloods, they had had magic for generations longer, and both parents transmitted it. Muggleborns were flukes, random occurrences that were best left ignored and, frankly, never taught magic at all. They were bound to cause problems in the long run, their blood not strong enough to ensure their descendants would inherit magic with each passing generation. Weakening the bloodlines.
They were sitting by the lake, and Draco had cast a warming charm on Harry that was much longer-lasting than his owns. It was also much more delicately balanced, in that Harry could somehow feel the sharp coldness of the air at the tip of his nose and on his cheeks, but he was comfortably toasty everywhere else. It felt like coming in from a snow day and lounging in front of the common room fireplace, and Draco said that was the only proper way to enjoy warming charms.
in her country, and simply braided her long hair as a crown around her head. The overall effect was quite impressive, but, as she told them, quite sober compared to some of her most elaborate dresses back at home.
out, not the other way around. I don’t even care about winning this stupid competition, I only care about finishing it without waking up in the infirmary missing a hand or a leg. He’s very welcome to winning this stupid oversized glass, or maybe Viktor will win it and then he can give it to you, since you care so much about it.”
“It vas snoving heavily vhen ve left,” the girl pointed out, and her tone of voice indicated that she was very, very tired of that argument.
He shrugged his doubt at her. Viktor and Draco were friends, he had no doubt about it, but they didn’t look like the kind of friends that confided their deepest secrets in each other. If anyone was likely to know about the reasons behind Draco’s attitude, he would bet on Svetlana Rasputin: not because Draco was more likely to speak to her, but because she might be able to guess them out. Viktor simply didn’t have this kind of observational skills.
“Nothing to do about it, though,” Draco said, for which he got a glare, because apparently Harry wasn’t feeling very philosophical right now.
- what's the worst nightmare of a Death Eater? Why, your one and only son in a soulbond with your master's enemy and prophesied killer!
“Wasn’t expecting you to,” Harry mumbled, shuffling. “It’s really just because I saw it and, well, it made me think of you.”
The next morning, Harry hurried to the lake as fast as he could, cursing himself for oversleeping. The students who were spending the rest of their holidays would leave at noon, amongst which Draco, and he really wanted to hand him the – small, nothing really, just because he had seen it in Hogsmeade and thought of Draco – Christmas gift he had bought for the Durmstrang student. He had originally left it with the rest of the gifts he had bought for his friends, but the house-elves probably didn’t handle the distribution outside of the castle, and it had been left behind. In the midst of preparing for the Yule Ball, Harry had forgotten about it, and now that was the last occasion to give it to Draco, or it would have to wait until the end of the break. Harry didn’t want to wait ten days to give a Christmas gift – Draco might think he had just forgotten about it and bought it late.
“I, I,” Harry’s mouth was so dry, and he had to lick his lips. He needed, desperately, for Draco to step away, but it was obvious that it wouldn’t happen if he didn’t provide him with a response, and Harry’s brain was drawing a blank. Finally, he managed to articulate: “I. Yes.”
He was out of his red robes, wearing only black pants and a white flowing shirt, and Harry had never thought anyone could look more less like a muggle outside of robes.
“How come no one knows where Durmstrang is located, though? The students must know, surely?” Harry continued. “How do you even hide a school?”
For now, his soulmark looked like a vague shadowy form, of something that could be an animal with a sort of halo around his head, if you squinted at it. But it had looked that way ever since the summer, and not moved an inch since. Draco did not expect it to, had never expected it too: he was unlikely to go through the kind of spectacular events needed for a settling at school.
“Ve’re going to figure out vy Drasha is acting like such a lunatic,” she said. “He should be in the potions lab at zat time, since he vasn’t in the library.”
Harry kept his eyes stubbornly fixed to the ground. It proved to be a mistake, because Draco took it upon himself to place his hand under his chin, and softly raise his head until their eyes met. Harry didn't say anything, couldn't even if he had wanted to. He couldn't watch away, either, because Draco was looking at him with such intent, serious and sad.
Oh. Ooooh. He had thought that Draco sounded like Ron just a few minutes ago, but it hadn’t crossed his mind that the words stemmed from the same underlying clause. Suddenly he felt like giggling: Draco, of all things, was jealous.
“Why would I know?” Ron exclaimed, throwing his hands up. “Those bloody purebloods never make any sense, now, do they? You’re well rid of him, Harry, believe me. They have all those ridiculous courting traditions, like you wouldn’t believe, you’ll be so much better off with anyone else. Now we only need to get Krum to drop Hermione off, and we can go back to how things were before you got bewitched by those Durmstrang gits.”
Harry would have begged to differ on that point, because Dobby had not hesitated to put him in some quite dangerous situations when he thought it would save his life two years before. In this case, though, he could only agree with Ron: there was nothing apparently dangerous about the gillyweed, and it would avoid Harry drowning or standing like a fool on the shore while the other Champions went on with their Task. Even Hermione could see no reason not to follow the house-elf's instructions.
“The grounds are not, and the forest on the edge is forbidden to the students,” Draco said, who had read it in Hogwarts: a History when he still thought he would attend.
They stayed a few more moments like this, lost in thought, while Draco’s thumb absent-mindedly traced Harry’s knuckles. Finally, Draco said:
“You haven’t asked anyone yet, right?” Draco asked, his voice dropping lower as his eyes darted away and back to Harry’s.
He was close to a sugar-induced coma when Dumbledore rose and clapped his hand to call for attention. The ceremony to appoint the three Champions started with Fleur Delacour’s name being called. Harry, who had not been looking at the Beauxbatons champion but at her little sister, smiled when she applauded excitedly. Then the Cup produced Viktor Krum’s name for Durmstrang, and Harry watched avidly as he rose from the Slytherin table, where Malfoy were smirking at him and apparently needling his friend so much the girl who sat with them cuffed him on the head and glared him down when he tried to protest. At least he didn’t look annoyed not to be selected.
“Hello, Dumbledoor,” she said as she shook his hand with a smile. “I didn’t remember the journey as quite so long. I am getting old.”
Svetlana leaned forward, breaking the line, to take a look at her brother. With an aggravated sigh, she flicked her wand at him, and the red robes straightened immediately. She might have even shrinked them a little, if Antoniy’s grimace as he tugged at his collar was any indication. Svetlana had a bit of a vindictive streak.
“But his ideals survive him, Draco. Are you saying you’ll turn your back on us, and refuse to continue the Malfoy line, for the sake of a boy you’ve know two months?” Lucius said, leaning forward. “Will you turn your back on your own family, on so slight a pretext? We are not telling you to throw him away, Draco, we are not even telling you to stop. We simply ask that you treat this as the thing it is: a young love between immature people, and unlikely to resist further than a few months. If it shall go on even after you are back in Durmstrang, and somehow still survive the distance, then we may revisit the matter, and discuss what arrangements could be achieved to reconcile your duty to the family and your feelings. Is that such a hard thing to agree to?”
After all, he had been raised muggle, and soulmarks were, if not extremely rare, at least not so common that people spoke about them incessantly. He had not made the link between the vague grey mark and the tales he had heard in the Gryffindor common room. Plus, Parvarti and Lavande were particularly fond of romance novels which focused on the theme, and somehow, he hadn’t felt that the plots they described between giggles represented anything to strive or wish for. Hermioned always clicked her tongue when the two girls went on about that particular subject. It was no secret that she considered the misrepresentation of soulmarks in literature a personal, and grievous, offense.
She was clearly daring him to finish his thoughts, and Ginny surreptitiously disentangled herself from her brother to take a step back, coming closer to Harry.
“Sure I am. You are just not able to appreciate the brilliance of my wit,” he replied. “Come now, I know a few Slytherins, we can sit with them.”
Antoniy’s sharp elbow to his ribs was a small price to pay for such satisfaction. The insults which followed in Russian only threatened to make Draco smile, but he controlled his expression and kept his impassive attitude and didn’t move an inch. A good little Durmstrang student, he was. Even Blacklund would have found nothing wrong with his posture, and the Duel Professor had been known to use measuring tape and a metal square to teach proper mien.
He followed Harry’s example and laid down as well, on his side, his head propped up on one hand so he could watch Harry. The scrutiny made Harry feel uneasy, like his skin was too tight against his face; he barely restrained himself from squirming.
“Oh no, nothing like that, darling, don’t worry,” his mother reassured him quickly. “No, it is just that a special event will take place at Hogwarts this year, and a delegation from Durmstrang will attend. Your father has arranged it with Karkaroff that you will be part of it.”
“Away from you, since you seem insistent on being a prat,” Harry replied, eyes stubbornly fixed ahead of him as he kept walking. “Don’t you have a train to catch?”
“I’ll try to get you an autographed picture,” Draco smirked, as if the perspective of meeting the kid who had survived the Killing Curse at age one did nothing to him.
By the time they all got to the top box at the stadium, Harry had forgotten all about his soulmark. There was just to much to see and think about, from Mr Weasley’s failed attempts to put the tent up without magic to all manners of decorations – mostly four-leaved clovers, the Bulgarian supporters must have been in another part of the campsite – that Harry just let it slip from his mind. There were too many new people he had met so far, anyway.
It was indeed Harry on the front page, his shirt raised up due to the position of his arm around the French kid, and his shorts riding low on his skinny hips, and there was a mark there which no witch or wizard, anywhere, would have mistaken for anything other than what it was.
“Well, the Dark Lord is gone, so it’s not like it matters, does it?” he said impatiently. “I don’t know what a wizard dead those past thirteen years has to do with my relationship with Harry Potter.”
And he smirked and Harry ducked his head. He had used his whole reserve of daring for a few days on that action, Draco could rightly piss off if he expected anything more right now.
“Draco, this changes everything. Now we really cannot afford for you to be linked to Harry Potter, surely you can see that.”
So Draco had quickly understood it was better to keep his mouth shut about his family. It was accepted, even encouraged, to brag about your own accomplishments in Durmstrang, but using your family name was considered to be in bad taste. People from similarly great backgrounds already knew about it, and did not care, and those from less fortunate circumstances either didn’t know the difference, or envied you.
Draco could have done without all those revelations about his family, which he seemed to be stumbling into every few weeks this year.
words of the House of Black. He had gone to Gryffindor, and trampled his family’s beliefs so thoroughly that Narcissa’s aunt Walburga had burnt his name off the family tree when he had run away at sixteen. It was hard to reconcile this version of Sirius Black with the image of a faithful Deatheater. An allegiance to the Dark Lord would have gotten him his place back on the tree, as well as his inheritance and, insofar as anyone knew, no such measures had been taken. Of course, it wasn’t as if anyone could go and check the tapestry, with Grimmauld Place closed to anyone since the disappearance of Regulus Black.
By the beginning of October, he had started subjecting the students to – thankfully – the only one Unforgivable they could somewhat survive without too much damage, because apparently it wasn’t so unforgivable as long as it was used as an educative tool. Hermione had quite a few choice words to say about this, and threatened to take it to McGonagall, or even Dumbledore himself, but Harry and Ron managed to dissuade her. For all that his lessons seemed to traumatize some students, the rest of the school seemed to idolize Moody, with the obvious exception of the Slytherins. He returned the sentiment: there was something about the way he treated the Slytherin students, from the smallest to the biggest snake, which showed he expected them to attack someone at any moment, and he would be ready for them. He treated them, overall, the same way he treated the dark creatures he introduced to the third years.
“Thank you for pointing out that very obvious point, Potter,” the Durmstrang boy drawled. “I hadn’t noticed.”
While Madam Maxime and Dumbledore went on with the pleasantries, the Beauxbatons students, about thirty of them, were alighting the carriage and arranging themselves in orderly lines in front of the carriage. They wore light blue robes, which shimmered in the moonlight and which, if the way they shivered was any indication, were much too thin for the Scottish autumn weather. They were all very elegant, to be sure, but the tooth-rattling did take away some of the effect. None of them seemed to consider warming charms as a solution, to Harry’s surprise.
“I’ve never been on it, you know, we get to Durmstrang by boat, obviously,” he said when Harry asked why. “And my parents both went to Hogwarts, both to Slytherin, obviously,” which Harry was more than ready to believe. He might like Draco, but it was Draco the foreign student from abroad, whom he hadn’t any past with, or any strong impression on other than what the older boy projected. Harry wasn’t sure they would have been on good terms had they met in Hogwarts, in the middle of the intense inter-House rivalry that opposed the Gryffindors and the Slytherins.
“Stop whinging, the both of you,” Hermione snapped. It had taken three days, which Harry thought was a remarkable amount of time for her tolerance of Quidditch-related topics to dwindle to the negatives. “There will be dozens of international students, you could try and meet them, maybe even learn another language.”
The first person climbed out of the carriage, an immense woman dressed in elegant black satin robes, whom Dumbledore immediately stepped forward to greet as Madam Maxime. She completely dwarfed the Headmaster, and Harry thought she might have been even taller than Hagrid.
Daily Prophet,” Draco gritted between his teeth, immediately furious, and watched the journal jump from the Slytherin’s hands to his. The boy looked ready to protest the theft, but a glare from Draco convinced him to keep his mouth shut and his eyes averted.
“I am not stupid, Father,” he said acidly. “Did you really think I would go around revealing family secrets to Gryffindors? I might not attend Hogwarts, but even I know better than to give away our weaknesses to brash hotheads that wouldn’t know discretion if it danced naked in front of them.”
He caught sight of a pair of Slytherins six years, down a few seats from them: the journal was the Daily Prophet, which no one read at Durmstrang, and certainly didn’t receive with their morning mail, and under it there was a picture of Harry trudging through the lake with Gabrielle Delacour.
“Sure you don’t,” Svetlana said, agreeably. “And, Drasha, vord of advice? You should stop calling him kid, it makes you sound like a pervert.”
And he had buried, deep, deep inside himself, that stupid little hope that maybe Draco Malfoy, met right after his soulmark had started changing, was actually the one person supposed to bring the biggest positive change in his life.
“Zeir translation spell is horrible”, Svetlana said as the Durmstrang delegation made its way in the castle and they all started to realize that if their comrades sounded so strange to their ears, then they probably did as well. “I don’t even vant to know vat I sound like to you.”
“Poor dears,” Svetlana said. “vell at least zey’ve got a grand castle to compensate for the lack of outside space. Look at zat entrance hall, it must be as vide as the Auditorium.”
“None of your business,” she retorted, raising from her sofa. “But he asked me the very day they made the announcement about the ball. You know, when all the
“Why must I learn the woman’s steps?” Harry muttered, his head bowed to watch his feet, his mouth moving silently as he tried to count the beats.
“Did you?” Ron’s face cleared. “Great for you, mate! Who are you going with? Oh, did you finally ask Cho?”
She gestured at the Gryffindor’s table, to a cluster of fourth years laughing and messing about. There was a bushy haired girl who looked about to go off on a sanctimonious rant, the redheaded kid that had almost fainted for Viktor earlier – he had to be the Weasley friend, that was a truly appalling number of freckles –, a blonde girl and an Indian girl with their heads close, and a black boy who was about to drop something down the shirt of his neighbour, turned to talk to a pair of redheaded twins – Merlin, how many were they? – while the rest of the table watched on with an anticipatory gleam in their eyes. And, next to the bushy haired girl, his eyes dancing with merriment at his friend’s antics, there was a cute brown-skinned kid with messy hair and thin wrists peeking out of his dark robes.
“It was not!” Antoniy protested, and, when the Sami girl rose her eyebrow at him, more sulkingly: “It was not.”
“Of course we don’t,” she replied with an impatient jerk of the head. “But there is no need to be a subscriber, when such news come out.”
"It's not like I can prevent them from taking it, anyways," Harry sighed. "And I only have a few days left, I doubt I'll figure it out in that time, if I haven't in the past month and a half."
“Step inside, do not stand on ceremony!” a voice called from behind – Dumbledore, of course, with Karkaroff and the giant Beauxbatons headmistress. Krum was dragging his feet behind them, watching the floor sullenly as if it would provide his deliverance. Draco snickered and waved his wand to send a soft stinging hex to him, just enough to get his attention. Really, that had been done with the best of intentions, no need to glare at him so.
“Sveta, do you know what this little shit is on about? He keeps talking and talking, but will not tell me anything definite,” Antoniy complained to his sister as they joined her in the Auditorium for the headmaster’s welcome speech.
“Gryffindors,” Harry heard his House Head sigh as they all departed, still bickering amongst themselves. That put a smile on his face for the rest of the morning.
Draco managed to get out of this without actually saying he's sorry or he's apologizing which is... very on track for both characters, imo. Let's not forget that Harry is fourteen, and the product of a childhood environment that makes him likely to underestimate his worth - he's not exactly at the point, yet, where he feels like he deserves apologies. Draco's quite lucky he managed to worm back into his good graces, though, because I've never considered Harry as having a very forgiving nature, and such an "easy" resolution will not happen more than once.
Harry shrugged, and hoped it conveyed how much he didn't. He had no wish to go through another round of pain over Draco. Once had been enough for him, and he would make his peace, in time, with the disappointment he still felt over it.
“I know,” Draco said, because he did. His dress robes were made of fairyworms silk and had been hand-tailored by Kognok and sons, a goblin shop so exclusive his parents had booked his appointments before he was even born. He looked more than nice, he looked perfect. Even Svetlana could not find anything to fault with his appearance: even the lack of color in his outfit was compensated by the obvious quality of the costume.
He was wearing black Quidditch gear, but had forgone the overcoat, and it emphasized his lean frame. Harry felt crummy, in comparison, in his Gryffindor gear.
“He has it coming,” one of the girls answered. “Grimhildr takes him, I am sveating like I am cooking in furnace.”
Harry shook his head, his eyes still fixed on Draco’s face, which meant he wasn’t focusing on the steps anymore. It had allowed Draco to lead him through two box sets, one right turn, another box set and even a left turn, so far.
Harry debated running away, but he wasn’t sure he could withstand the humiliation. Plus, he didn’t trust himself not to faceplant, and that would the cherry on top of the shite pie his life had been for the past two days. He walked faster, but Malfoy had the advantage of longer legs and not hesitating in taking this into a run.
Her voice was rich and deep and she talked with a strong French accent, and quite a few students snickered at the way she pronounced the Headmaster’s name. Even Harry barely contained his smile.
And with that, Harry’s worries were somewhat alleviated. Hermione’s confirmation on the next day, as they walked to the portkey, assuaged whatever was left of his fears. She did warn him, however, that if their meeting indeed happened during the mess of the World Cup, it might be some years before he was able to meet his soulmarked. After all, it was unlikely to be someone who attended Hogwarts, otherwise Harry would have already declared his mark. Ron noted that it might be a first year, which, ok, fair, but when he joked that it might be the new Defense teacher, Harry bodychecked him into the nearest tree. They were still squabbling when they met with the Diggorys, and Harry couldn’t control his blush when he met Cedric’s amused eyes. When they got to the campsite, he was quick to walk away from the Hufflepuff seeker. Not as bad as falling from his broom because of Dementors but still – bad enough.
They all turned to goggle at Fleur Delacour and her younger sister, both wearing white feathery dresses. Fleur’s was a floor-length gown, in the French fashion, with a short cape around her shoulders in a metallic sheen. Her sister’s was empire-waisted, and stopped right below her knees, giving her a very angelic appearance. Their veela heritage had never been so apparent.
Her friends corrobated all of her stories, except the one about Sirius Black. Daphne Greengrass seemed to think that the infamous trio of Gryffindor had facilitated his escape by also freeing a hippogriff awaiting execution. Her friends both scoffed at her.
, everyone heard the shock in Dumbledore’s voice as he read Harry’s name. Harry didn’t even know why he even bothered to wish for a normal life anymore.
Barmy didn’t even start to describe Professor Moody. The man was absolutely and irrevocably nuts, so paranoid it was a wonder he even managed to get out of bed every morning. Harry wondered how he had been allowed into a teaching position at all given what could at best be described at a shaky mental health. Sure, he might have been one of the greatest Aurors ever at some point, but nowadays he belonged in a therapist’s office or ten, not in a school.
