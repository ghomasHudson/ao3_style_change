“I have,” said Lucius, as if it were really true.
Eventually, of course, he would have to go to Voldemort.  Either to present him with the book, or to be punished for his failure.  He had known that from the onset; however, he had never really visualized it.  And now that he had the book in front of him, it seemed a horrible thing to turn it over to the Dark Lord.  Although he had not translated every spell, he was sure there were things in here that would be to his liking.  But how else was he to get mandrake juice?
Harry shook his head.  “You don’t have to apologize.”
Sounds raged on below him.  The sounds of a body being torn to pieces. The sounds of his father crying.  The sounds of the Dark Lord’s occasional commands, of the Death Eater’s shouts and insults.  And to think these were the last words that the Great Harry Potter would ever hear.
“What does some looney Black grail have to do with him?” said Lucius.
Voldemort was in the center of the room, Lucius kneeling on the floor by his feet.  Against one of the walls stood Narcissa, a Death Eater to either side of her.  Her hands and feet were apparently bound by magic.  There were another four Death Eaters surrounding Harry, who was still being pinned to the floor.
He also began getting things prepared for the full moon.  He cut down an Ash tree, and hollowed out the trunk, creating something akin to a bathtub.  He would lay down Harry’s remains here, along with the mandrake juice and the other listed ingredients.  He had also determined which part of his bones he would give Harry.  He settled on three fingers on his left hand, hoping that was enough.  He had thought several times of going back to the tomb and examining Cepheus to see what he had given up for his beloved, but he did not like the idea of leaving Harry, and more than that, he had a feeling that Harry did not want him to leave either.
The truth was simpler, and more complex.  Draco had lost his appetite.  No matter what delicious morsels his mother had Diri prepare, nothing tempted him.  And what he did eat he would usually end up vomiting a few hours later.  His stomach was in revolt, and in consequence he grew weak and thin, deep shadows under his eyes.
“I really missed you,” he said as he squeezed it.  “I really didn’t know how to make a life without you.”
They got out of bed together.  Harry was still wearing all his clothes and, suddenly self-conscious, Draco summoned his bathrobe from the other side of the room.  He draped it over himself as they took their places at the table.  Diri bowed and left with another
Panic rose inside of him.  “What do you mean?”
Draco glanced at Harry on the bed.  He was laying on his back, his one eye on Draco, the sheet leaving him bare from the waist up.  His eyes ran down the scars at his neck, at each of his arms, and the redness of his torso where he had been ripped open.  Then he looked down at his own chest, where the marks Harry had left on him still stood out against his pale skin.
From the window of her bedroom she watched the Death Eaters enter her home.  She knew exactly what it meant.  Life as she knew it was over.  They would be despised.  Tortured.  Killed.  They were now the enemy, just as Potter had been.  And no sweet talking, no sickly compliments, could save her.
It was almost noon when Harry finally woke up.  “Draco?” he said, searching for him in the room.
“Yes, you did, my clever boy,” she kissed the top of his head.
, did you?” The words fell foolishly into the silence.  “Maybe I was a bit of a dickhead, but I didn’t know who you were, I didn’t know what you were like.” He ran his fingers over the scars Potter had given him.
“I’m not picky.”
As hungry as he was for the text in Cepheus’s hands there was also deep apprehension within him.  Draco had certainly done many questionable things in his life, but this felt quite different.  He had hurt people, and subjected others to his will, and the consequences of that had furthered him on his trajectory towards Voldemort.  But this – as he looked down at the two wasted remains of his ancestors, Draco knew that if he disturbed them, he was cursing himself.  If he did this, he was starting a different trajectory, one that was unarguably darker, and one that would certainly bring him into cohabitation with magic that both terrified and enthralled him.
Draco’s eyes had gone wide and he shook his head, a nasty feeling beginning in the pit of his stomach.
“But he only did it because he loved her.”
“And hardly said a thing – it’s not natural,” he said, probing his fork hard into the quiche in front of him. “Even his room smells like death.  I really think there is something wrong with him.”
This time, when he moved towards the sarcophagus, he felt no reverie.  He reminded himself that it was only a cave, only an unmarked grave.  This was no place to intimidate a Malfoy, and whoever the dead man was, he was nothing to him.
Some nights, he watched the dancing lights on the ceiling and tried to piece together the story outside: the pale headlights of a car passing, the thin voice of a young girl, singing—comma’d with hiccups and scattered laughter—a bar closing, drunken groans and staggering footsteps nearing and then fading away. Some nights he couldn’t sleep and he thought, quietly,
He didn’t recognize the room. The walls, clean and stained with age, pressed in like they did in the living room. At the corner below the large window sat a wooden table dotted with photographs and quills. Above, thin booklets and thick books with loose spines slumped against one another on the mounted, half-empty bookshelf. Cold morning light slanted through the windows from behind the heavy curtains, illuminating a patch of triangle across the wall, over Potter’s sweater—the one he wore last night, draped over a half-pushed chair.
“The glasses look good on you.”
Harry’s fingers still. The buttery yellow walls fade around him, the bowl of toffees strangely close.
“Sleeps in the master bedroom in the middle of the bed, all by himself.”
Draco lost track of time. It felt like an endless journey, him and Potter: one in front and the other behind, walking. Two silhouettes under the silver moon. At last they arrived at the edge of a forest, but Potter didn’t stop, didn’t make a turn—simply continued. They trudged through the mesh of scattered pine trees, batting away and pushing through needling branches—then, as if in a single breath, the ground cleared. Surrounding them still was the forest they had just passed, but in the middle the sky opened up to a plate full of blinking stars. Baubles of light, tiny and warm—a candle lit in the middle of glass orbs—floated in the air, casting a faint yellow glow over the pine branches whenever they drifted close.
“Because I’ve been working on this for forty-five minutes now, trying to get it to float!”
then.”
“I’ve missed you,” he finally said, voice muffled. Harry combed a hand through his hair, lifted Draco’s face. Draco, adamant, tried to look away but gave in—looked into Harry’s eyes. His face was just as he remembered, his eyes just as green. Just as bright. The corners of his eyes crinkled with a faint smile.
“’m sorry,” he mumbled. He didn’t even know what he was apologizing for anymore. For anything; for everything. Potter squeezed his wrist.
“Um.” Harry strokes the sleeping kitten’s ears. “At least two months?”
Potter whispered, every syllable a hot puff of air. “Should I not…”
“You know. Hagrid wasn’t exactly the best teacher.” Potter quickly glanced at him, his eyes back to the road. “Remember the blast-ended skrewts?”
“Circe, you are such a pain.”
“It’s still the same,” Draco said. “Just different.”
“What do you say?” Draco murmurs. Something rustles between them; Harry looks down, and there is the bouquet of cleomes he’d wrapped this morning, a lovely purple.
Harry opens his mouth. Closes it again. “He doesn’t want to be a human?”
Draco doesn’t wake up, not really. He makes muffled noises when Harry shakes him awake for breakfast, for lunch, for his potions—eyelids half-closed, head drooping—rolls over once Harry is finished and falls asleep again. Harry cooks dinner and eats alone in the kitchen. Takes showers at night, makes coffee in the morning. Listens to the pipes humming in the walls, the coffee machine beeping enthusiastically, marking the passing days.
Then he sauntered off and found a corner and drew, or wandered to the edges of forests, to the backside of fells. He knew his way around the snowy hills now, and could find his way back to the cottage himself.
Harry laughed. Warmth lined his face, lined the crinkles at the corner of his eyes and the folds of his cheeks—the same warmth in Harry’s eyes whenever he teased him about that night, Draco dismantling his bed and bringing the parts to the living room to sleep next to Harry on the couch. Draco had always grumbled in response. Now, however, it made him warm, too, made him want to smile back.
“Oh.” Draco turns a little towards Harry, distracted. “It was nothing.”
“Harry.” A whisper.
Harry sighs faintly and throws all thoughts away. He strokes down the kitten’s back, burying his finger into its silky fur, and drifts into sleep once again.
Draco brought the mug to his lips, numb. The warm liquid slid down his throat, sweet and strong and tangy, the sourness lingering. It warmed him up from the inside. Draco looked, again, to the blizzard raging outside the window. Six months. Was he to stay here with Potter, whom he hadn’t seen nor heard from for the last decade? Who had disappeared from their world without a single word and was now in front of him again, sporting a beard?
Potter’s shoulder, clad in a thick jumper, brushed Draco’s nose. Fractions of memories of last night flashed through Draco’s mind, and he briefly closed his eyes. Accepted the water, sipped. Coughed some more.
The world was white.
advantage. That means you’ve been cuddling him this whole month.”
“How do you know that?” Draco asks, eyes searching. “How do you know?”
“Oh,” he said.
“Of course. Of course I miss them.” Potter smiled tightly, then swallowed. “I do. So we owl, you know, and they visit during the holidays. They can’t always come. They have their jobs, their families...but when they do, it’s—it’s fun.” Potter let out a laugh. “Really noisy. They’re bloody loud all the time.”
In a way, Draco wasn’t surprised. He had noticed all the signs, as though taking them in from peripheral vision: Weasley’s and Granger’s tweets, a local interview with Ginevra, the brochures flying all over the streets, posters covering blocks and blocks of walls in London as though the sky had fallen in patches. Still it wasn’t until Pansy told him the news during lunch that it hit him full force like a train wreck. For a moment his mind blanked. Then, careful not to show emotions on his face, he picked up the remaining half of his Panini.
Three in the morning. Draco paced his room fifteen times, boiled tea twice, washed his face four times before he finally decided to bake cookies.
The kitten gnaws at the windowpane, trying to bite a droplet. Harry chuckles and yawns again. He wonders if Draco does this, too, as a human, if the kitten really is Draco. Not gnawing at the windowpane, exactly, but—does Draco like the rain?
Hermione, who was still cooing the litter of kittens a moment ago, has now appeared in front of her new target.
Potter gently pried the bottle from his rigid fingers. Placed it on the table.
“I know.”
Draco was still staring at the bundle, which was still stuck in the door frame. The thick smell of tomatoes thinned in the cold air by the open door, a hint of warmth. Of tomato soup.
The kitten, despite having already slept, is still tired. It wakes up briefly after they arrive home—drinks some water, eats a small portion of salmon—then crawls back to Harry’s side and falls asleep again. Harry strokes its back lightly, not quite in his mind.
“I, ah,” Draco said, “Can I sleep with you tonight? It’s just, I can’t. Can’t seem to stop, and I thought, maybe—”
So the three hours were spent distracted, with Harry lounging on a chair and watching him—Draco knew he was, he could feel his gaze on him, could feel his teasing grin—and Draco blushing down his neck as he worked through the papers. Michael came once to discuss a research that was to be conducted in two weeks, and raised an eyebrow at Harry. Draco cleared his throat to focus Michaels’s attention as well as his own back to work matters.
Harry played some soft music on the gramophone. They sat, the music adrift around them. Draco held the mug close to himself; warmth soaked through his fingers. They didn’t tremble, then.
Dinner was finished and the rest of the bottle was enjoyed in front of the fireplace. They sat on the floor, Draco’s back against the couch and Potter against the armchair, their feet touching. Draco couldn’t help the chuckle bubbling at Potter’s ridiculous socks. He felt hot on the inside, his cheeks flushed from the wine and the burning fire.
“Do you want to do something? Or should we go back to bed.”
The wand was raised, and Draco closed his eyes – waiting for that silence, waiting for that other world.
Draco smiled at him and gently interlaced their fingers.  The touch was everything.  It grounded him, and it seemed to clear his head.  “Come on we have to get up, we have to get you warm.” He rose on legs that felt as weak as pudding.  “Can you get up, Harry?”
“Thank you,” he said, tugging it into his bag.
The bed was drenched in red, pools of it in the crevices that their bodies made on the mattress.  The sheets soaked it up hungrily, and as he watched he could see the red spreading through the sheets towards him like a disease.  He got out of bed and dashed to Harry’s side.
On the bed Harry stirred and Draco’s attention was diverted.
He guided him towards the bed.  He pulled back the covers, and then went into the spot closest to the canvas wall.  For a moment Harry just stared at him and then he crawled in by his side.  Draco pulled up the blankets over both of them, and underneath searched again for the comfort of Harry’s hand.
In the afternoon they usually went through his bedroom.
There were many similar findings, which he documented with mounting frustration both in the letters he sent his parents, and in the documents that Blacks before him had begun.  A week or so after the fertility stone he came to a ruined fortress, with a graveyard to boot.  He could sense magic in the area, and an excitement began mounting within him.  But this was not the place, as the family buried bore an unfamiliar last name: Gaunt.
He raised an eyebrow. “Is he sick?”
“He might have weeks or months, or maybe a year, but he’s not going to be with you forever.”
His mother spent all her free time nursing him, as if he were a small child again.  She would bring him meal-replacement potions and sit by his bed, telling him old stories, caressing his hair.  It was comforting and embarrassing all in one. He felt like a little boy again.
It was true but absolutely the last thing he wanted to admit.  “Harry? Are you glad I did it?” He wasn’t sure he wanted an honest answer to this, but he had to ask it all the same.
“I know,” said Draco, more sharply than he intended to.  “But the thing is that I’m going to figure this out.  We’re gonna figure this out,” he leaned closer to him and kissed his cheek.  “You’re gonna get better again, we’ll try more things, I’ll steal that fucking book again if I have to.”
He wanted to stay awake, to watch him and make sure that he was alright, but he couldn’t do it.  He couldn’t keep his eyes open.  He couldn’t keep his head clear.  All that he knew was that Harry was besides him, and everything was right in the world again.
Since he started at Hogwarts his world had revolved around the other boy.  Outdoing him where he could, fighting him when he had to, being his counterpart, his rival. Almost every choice he had ever made over the last 7 years had somehow been linked to Potter.  And now what? What was he supposed to do?
The weeks passed, but he only felt them when he wrote his letters home.  Now Lucius had begun to ask him to return, saying that he had been away long enough already.  Narcissa never said as much, but there were hints in her letters, too.  She kept asking him if he wanted to come back for a break, or to gather more supplies, once even suggesting she had some books at home that could be of help to him.  But he knew all that meant nothing.  They were getting anxious about him, that was all.
He shook his head.  “No, just empty.  You don’t feel things, really.”
As soon as they arrived Draco shut himself up in his old room.  He fell into bed, staring up at the vaulted ceiling above him.  His body felt weak and wobbly, and everything in the world was wrong.  He could still remember Potter’s arms around him as they flew together out of the blaze that engulfed the Room of Requirement.  He could still feel the warmth of Potter’s voice, hear his shouts in his ear.  He had gone out of his way to rescue Draco; he had reached out and pulled him from literal hellfire.  And all this mere hours before.  How could it possibly be that he was now dead?
“I know!” said Draco, so angry he wanted to throw something at her. Why had he let that book out of his grasp? Why had he not at least copied the pages?  Why had he just handed it over?
“Let’s hope he’s more successful than old Cygnus,” grumbled Lucius.
Wherever he went Voldemort would know.  He would hear of it and how would Draco justify himself? How would he explain the fact that he intended to resurrect Harry Potter? They would think he was a traitor.  They would not understand that this action had nothing to do with good or evil, right or wrong, that this was not in the least a political act, that it was just his heart he was following, his desire, his devotion.  He missed Harry.  Missed his presence.  Missed the way those green eyes were always looking at him.  And he did not want to live without him anymore than he had already had to.
Ron and Hermione visit and chat as loud as they can. Ron digs out an old wireless and screws the button this way and that, finds a song and lets it play softly in the background. The singer lifts her voice and stays up high, the note hanging like a chandelier, floating in the air.
“Harry,” Draco murmured, pulling back. “I adore you, too.”
Draco didn’t hesitate, didn’t think. Walked over and folded them, his limbs of their own accord; noticed, distantly, the smudges and the dirt, the rough wool at his fingers. He placed the neat pile on Potter’s bed and uncertainly looked around. Again, he made to leave, when this time he caught sight of the photographs on the table.
His flat looked exactly as he’d left it. The stale air was suffused with the smell of sherries and dust. The French windows leading to the balcony were shut tight—the curtains half-drawn, a thin streak of light branded onto the floor. The mugs on the kitchen island, the dishes piled half-heartedly in the sink, the books sprawled all over the living room…Draco sighed, and rolled up his sleeves. Wiped the table with a piece of cloth, dumped the contents in the mug to the sink, washed the dishes. Spelled the coats and sweaters to fold and levitate themselves back to his bedroom as he mopped the floor and dusted the cabinets. Pulled the curtains, fastened them to the side, and pushed the French windows fully open. Wind gushed in, replacing the stale aroma of sherries with the fresh smell of the city: the baked asphalt, the cool air. Draco closed his eyes and inhaled. Up here, it was quiet. Precious sunlight flooded his balcony and bathed him in warmth, tickled his eyelids. Summer was warmer than he remembered, warmer than in Scotland.
“I thought we’ve established you’re the clever one,” Harry said.
“Ah, I get it. So every two days you shout out to the world from your balcony—”
“Shouldn’t you go see him?”
The Healer tries to take over the kitten. It shrieks and clings onto Harry.
he’d said to Astoria, desperate.
In the end, Draco could only watch from afar. Potter sat in the armchair across from him, reading a thin booklet on his lap. The corner of the pages were ruffled with frequent touch, the colors on the cover faded with age, the tiny printed letters crammed against the yellowing paper. Draco thought he’d seen it in Potter’s room, on Potter’s single line of a bookshelf. He wanted to ask about it. Wanted to tease Potter for it, for finally picking up a book for the first time since his arrival, finally reading the poor dusted thing. The words clogged at the top of his throat.
and then fell silent in the dark. They were in their bedroom—empty except for the large bed against the center of one wall and a lamp, placed on the floor close to the windows. Some nights they left it on, casting warm, yellow light over the walls. Some nights they turned it off. It wasn’t that dark, really, the moon and the stars shining outside the window.
Harry thought about it, then shrugged. Draco went and fetched a blanket and draped it over Harry. Harry curled himself into a blanket-covered ball.
“We eat up half of your food storage every time we visit,” he says.
“Lilacs?”
“…When I was six,” Draco echoed, a moment later, “Mother brought me to Aunt Andromeda’s for the summer. Two weeks. Her house was close to the sea, then, and there was a little garden. It was all messy, you know, growing all over the place…the grass was taller than me, and I kept tripping over the vines.” A soft laugh. “Berries and flowers grew everywhere. I don’t think she planted them, even. I think the seeds just landed there and…and no one weeded them, so they just grew.”
He would not lie and say he did not know why he was here, but he would be honest and say he did not know what he was doing here. He didn’t know what he expected. Find Harry and then—what? Apologize? Leap back into his arms and wail? Harry might not even be here.
“You don’t know what I’m here for—”
Draco snapped his head up. Harry was looking at him, tentative—hopeful.
Instead of flushing, as he would have done seven years ago, Harry just looked steadily at him. “A week of Starbucks with her drink of choice.”
It all seemed so clear now, the separate stars shining together, linked.
Harry’s retort is on the tip of his tongue when Draco kisses him. Shuts him up, all blushed cheeks and awkward hands. Harry slackens, opens his mouth. Tilts his head, angling them deeper. Draco’s hips dig into the counter, the fallen apron pressed tight between them, wrinkled.
“They’re always heavy. And my arms stop feeling anything after the third hive. So.”
“I don’t remember her,” Draco whispered. His sooty fingers clutched tighter on the parchment. “I don’t…remember her face.”
“Sorry,” Harry said softly. Turned his head a little, his mouth to Draco’s temple. “Didn’t mean to wake you up.”
Harry laughs and presses their foreheads together. Draco is blushing fiercely down his neck. Harry pecks him again, playful.
“Hey. I’m sorry.”
They had started dating a week or two before that winter. Harry helped him move, carried the remaining boxes of his belongings to the terrace with a Muggle truck, finished with three trips. The first night Draco cooked in his new kitchen they ate together, popping open a bottle of champagne and cheering in celebration. Later they fooled around on the couch, tipsy, hands roaming up and down and kissing open-mouthed, limbs tangled.
“Poor Madam Pomfrey. I have no idea how she managed.”
In the midst of chaos, Draco would stuff the breakfast he’d packed for Potter into his arms with a thermos of hot tea. Potter never paid it any attention, accepting it with his mind reeling elsewhere about sheep. Luna had lambed without incident, two lambs running vigorously in the drizzle. Parvati had taken her time in the barn, breathing heavily and pacing—had taken a twist of Potter’s arms to adjust the lamb into the correct position before it slid out. Cho still hadn’t lambed. Molly had needed a trip from the vet, and after long, agonizing hours, only two of the triplets were saved. She lay in the corner of the pen, tired, licking her lambs dry.
But they couldn’t sleep. More importantly, Draco couldn’t sleep, since he kept insisting they stay at Harry’s, knowing Harry couldn’t sleep in his house.
he wanted to ask, but drifted back asleep before he could.
—before I do. Great, now I am the babysitter. I enjoy it immensely, no doubt—”
“Draco,” Harry said. “I—I adore you.”
“You were cooking strawberry tea,” Harry said, out of the blue.
“Free of charge,” Draco mumbled.
The world stopped. The air stung from the words, and before Draco could feel it tears slid down his cheeks. It seemed to stun Potter out of his haywire rage as his eyes suddenly widened. “No, wait. Malfoy, I didn’t mean—”
“Come on, it’s time for cuppa.”
And Cho, for all her indifference and stubbornness, for all her eyeing about Draco and refusing to move—weakly licked Draco’s hand. Draco broke and sobbed, burying his face into her coarse wool. Trying, still trying to get the comforting words out. In the dark night, the barn was a dim halo. Muffled by the door was Potter arguing with the Muggle vet. Cho was warm underneath Draco’s hands, warm against his face—warm.
cooking stew again.”
“Don’t worry about it. I’ll go get you something to drink, eh?”
“What does it mean?”
The door opens with a faint creak. Music floats in, faint and ebullient and messy, snappy beats muffled by laughter. Falls silent as the door shuts it out again.
“Aw, come on.” Potter patted the space beside him. “Surely you wouldn’t mind my recounting a fond memory?”
Then Potter was gone again. In a faint whirl of wind, the air in front of him cooled. Draco opened his eyes, lids still heavy, and swung slightly forward—as though drunk, out of his own volition. All there was left was the echo of unsteady footsteps down the corridor, the slamming shut of a door.
“Well, I wouldn’t know what you were doing in Scotland, would I?” Potter sat forward to the edge of the couch, and tilted his head with curiosity. “Actually, what are you doing in Scotland? I can’t even see my own fingers out there.”
Harry tells it as much. The kitten yawns and slowly blinks as it lies down on the towel.
Later, they were quiet. They seemed to always be quiet in the aftermath. There was something—the night breeze through the window, the crumpled sheets, the sweltering heat underneath the duvet—that made it feel as though silence meant more than words. Draco put his hand to the center of Harry’s chest, the oval scar. The skin was so oddly smooth that it lured him like dancing fire. He had seen it before, knew what it was. Harry said his death never left a mark, but this felt like it: at the very center of him.
No one steals Ron and Hermione’s thunder. They dance in the middle of the gardens, under the starry sky, Ron in his best robes and Hermione in a dress of snowy white, flowers braided into her hair. They whisper into each other’s ears every now and then, laughing, arms around each other. The scattered crowd cheers and drinks more wine. The music floats in the air like the fragrance of summer flowers.
“It’s alright,” Harry said slowly. “They like you.”
Draco flinched. All emotions reverberated with the blurriness of the world, echoed and amplified until fear swallowed him up, as if a monster he could not name was chasing him. Potter looked guilty, nudged his feet.
That was not what he wanted to hear either.  “Do you know anyone else who might be able to help us?”
He felt that despite the success of the previous night, he had reached a new low as well.  His stomach was aching from lack of regular nourishment.  His head was pounding from the wine.  His back was in agony from spending the night on the floor when he was used to the softest and highest quality feather beds.  To add to it, his clothes were dirty, and smelled of damp and sea and sweat.
The cold was numbing him.  Involuntarily, he was shivering and jittering, his extremities heavy and slow.  This was the last moment that he could change his mind, and he let it pass over him, without a single wisp of a doubt.  When he opened his eyes, he extended his left hand over the grave, palm up.  He wished it would hold steady, but it was shaking badly, from both cold and fear.  He gripped the knife forcefully in his right hand, took a deep breath and then, in one fell swoop, slashed at the flesh from elbow to wrist, right over his Dark Mark.
She was paler than Draco had ever seen her, but even under this pressure and this fear, her eyes said nothing: “It is a mother’s place to protect her children and it is a Lord’s place to punish those who have displeased him.”
Draco peeled the entirety of the wet sheet off of him.  He was wearing underwear and nothing else, his body thin and familiar.  There were no new bruises or markings of any kind. Whatever was happening was internal.  Again, the nauseating image of Harry’s blackened organs floating out of the grave came through his head and he had to stop himself from being sick.
Draco had always been a sensitive boy.  And circumstances had made him grow up too fast, taking on too many responsibilities.  Lucius was not blind to this.   He could even accept that some of that had been caused by his own actions.  But in the end, everything had worked out perfectly – they had won on all counts.  They were back in the Dark Lord’s favor, and yet, the more victories he piled up, the more miserable Draco looked.
One morning Draco woke up abruptly with the sense that something was wrong.  His eyes shifted over to the shadowy figure beside him.  Harry was sat up, his shoulders squared and stiff, one of his hands  up to his mouth.  “Harry?” he whispered, gently laying a hand on the other’s shoulder.  Harry lurched forward violently and vomited all over the sheets.
“I’m here,” he said, going to sit on the bed beside him.  “I was thinking, why don’t we go to gardens today? I think you’ll like them.”
For a few minutes he waited like that, one hand gripping the knife, the other tilted down, blood dripping down his fingers and into the tub.  When he felt a little bit of strength returning, he gripped the knife hard again.  He extended the fingers of his left hand, which was entirely covered in blood.  He took another bracing breath, raised the knife into the air, and then swept it down to his fingers.
“Oh, shut up.”
Harry sighs and pads back to his bed, extinguishing the lights with a flick of his hand. Shuffles underneath the duvet. The air is getting colder and colder now in the night, autumn slithering close.
“I shouldn’t have kissed you.”
“Harry—”
All the difference in the world, Astoria had said. She sat at the dining table like she always did, and yet the familiar flat was a strange place. Everything seemed to have rearranged themselves: the books on his shelves, the napkins on the table, the tins of tea in the cabinet. Her arm on the table—strange.
The vet had to perform a caesarean section in the barn. By the time it was transformed into a surgery room and the vet had arrived it was already two in the morning, and Cho had to be wheeled in on a wagon—too weak to walk. At last Cho’s twins were pulled out. A dead little ram, and a tiny ewe who miraculously survived.
“Relax! I’m trying to give you food!” Harry settles the kitten back onto the counter, trying to shout over its piercing meows. “Merlin.”
“It doesn’t understand you,” Ron calls from the kitchen.
Harry shrugs.
how logic works,
“Shh,” Draco says. Wraps his arms around Harry, murmurs into his hair. “I’m here. I’m sorry. Let’s go home. We’ll sleep together. I’ll let you hog the blankets.” A wet laugh. Draco presses a kiss into the raven locks, strokes. “We’ll wake up together. I’ll kiss you good morning, make you pancakes…”
They’d moved Cissy to the barn just a couple days ago. She was big enough for it, now. Draco sat down with a huff, folded his legs. Cissy lost interest in him a while later, turning her attention to a small beetle on the fence.
In the dusk, the crickets began to chirp.
The next day, he could not focus on a single word in his papers. The letter Harry sent was folded, tucked to the inside of his beast pocket. It pressed against his chest. Inside the office people walked past him, nodded aimlessly at him as he got himself a cup of tea. Faces he couldn’t name. All of them swarming pass him day after day, year after year, and yet he couldn’t name them. Not a single one. He panicked. Not a full force that swept the floor from underneath his feet, but a little nag, faint but consistent at the edge of his mind. Was the man at the tea stand John? Or George? Surely he would have remembered if it was George. Was the woman sitting next to him Camille or Carla? His mind drifted. The tip of his quill leaked ink into the report and blocked, with a stain the size of a dime, a great portion of the second passage. He spent fifteen minutes cleaning it out, and even then threads of blue still lingered. His department manager gave him a thirty minute lecture when he received the notes on the report. Draco stared out of the tiny window.
“Draco,” he murmured, voice thick and muffled. “Am I too late?”
“Well, it’s not like you need to ask,” Harry laughs, dry, “of course they’ll come with you.”
Draco paused. “What?”
“You’re on.”
They reach the Fourth Floor and wait on dull chairs painted mint green. Harry peels the prickled paint and darts his eyes around. The kitten has it worse than him, tail flicking nervously and meowing every now and then, looking up from his lap.
He was clumsy. He never knew he could be, but he was, in his spluttering and flushing as Harry brought him to his bedroom. They stumbled all the way back from the couch, Harry knocking the short table sideways and pushing him into the wall twice. Draco didn’t know anything, only that he wanted. Wanted, with a clear-headedness that startled him through the haze of his mind. They slowed, though, once on the bed. Harry took his time unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, fingers pushing the buttons through, one by one. Took his time tucking Draco’s trousers off, out of his legs. Kissed along his warm, bare arm, his lips a slow drag. Each gentle press like a blossom.
“Bon Appétit,” he says, going back to the sausages. The kitten meows before munching onto the food, busy eating its own brunch.
Potter rolled his eyes and pushed it all the way to Draco. Draco swallowed. Looked at it as though it might explode. Pushed it away.
Potter caught Draco and grinned.
Astoria smiled. “Let’s find somewhere to sit, shall we?”
of the possibilities. There isn’t a fixed definition. I can be the Golden Boy, and I can be a shepherd. I don’t have to be just one. The thing is, there are things that have defined us for such a long time, things that, somehow, shaped how we look at ourselves. So when we lose them, we’re lost. But we don’t have to be.” Potter swallowed. “This is you, too. You’re not lost; you’re still here, just different.”
pain exploding in his bum.
“Wonders never cease, Potter.”
No such person appeared.
Draco’s mind was a tangled mess. There was want, grief, anger—at Potter, at Astoria, at himself—fear. A warm ache, all threaded tightly together. Couldn’t tell one from another.
It was even larger than he’d thought it would be.
Which isn’t a surprise, really. Molly and Fleur decorated it with baby’s-breath, peonies, and stephanotis, so the lush green of the gardens is covered in a thick layer of white as though coated in snow, even though it is mid-June. Luna charmed Lily of the Valley’s to grow at every other corner, tiny bells dangling amidst dotted green.
Draco blinked. “And that is supposed to mean…?”
He never used to like French onion soup. Rather, he’d never had it, but he thought he wouldn’t have liked it much had he tried. But Draco cooked well, which was unsurprising because he had always been good at potions, but at the same time surprising because he cooked Muggle and, well, Harry felt like he should have been the one who cooked better since he had been cooking practically his whole life.
After the day slipped into night, nothing really changed. Draco cooked dinner, and afterwards they moved to the living room. Potter sank into the armchair, cradling a mug of cider on his lap. Quiet, exhausted from the day.
“Why yes Potter, yes I did.”
The words sank into silence as the kiss deepened.
“Did you think I’d still be waiting for you?”
“Yes. We will go over the results when you come back and pick him up.”
They head into her office. The Healer closes the door behind them with a soft click and immediately launches into a series of test results. Harry tries to keep up, but it is like trying to understand someone speaking Arithmancy.
Harry laughed, knocking into Draco’s shoulders. Draco grinned, tipsy and dazed.
Draco pauses. “Do you mind?”
In the midst of life and chaos, spring arrived.
The kitten looks at him with large eyes.
They disappear into the room, the door shutting behind them. Harry stays for one second, two seconds, before turning and leaving the buttery yellow walls.
He scratches a kitten’s chubby bum and pushes himself up, walks to the door for post. Pigwidgeon, knowing the three of them for as long as it has, still has trouble finding the windows. His thoughts wander to whether he should cook kebab or carbonara tomorrow night as he grabs the doorknob and pushes the door open. Ron and Hermione visit every Saturday, and he does have chicken, but maybe if he—
Potter counted them, then visibly relaxed as he fished out little, round cakes from the satchel. The sheep scurried close, nudging his thighs for food.
Draco scrunched his nose. Potter sent a spoonful of stew into his mouth as he watched him. The stew was salty and tasted vaguely of sheep and aside from that…nothing much. Draco ate another spoonful and tried not to ask for water.
“I don’t think you should,” Harry says, kneeling down. “It’s quite loud outside.”
Draco thought to himself, watching Potter anxiously.
Everything was distant. Draco shouted and gripped his hand in the other as Potter bellowed commands for Lettuce to stay down. Draco tried to examine the wound, hissing. Potter gently pried it from his grip.
“You look tired. Is it the traveling? How long have you been back?”
Ron mocks surprise. “You’ve been feeding me stale food all this time?”
does it?” Harry murmurs into Draco’s mouth.
Draco laughs. “Why did you ask, then?”
Stifles a yawn. Rubs his eyes.
Potter snorted. “Am I, now?”
Harry laughed quietly into the space between their mouths.
“No,” Draco said. “Sorry, did I wake you?”
“A souvenir?” Draco perked up, hopeful—then, fearful, “Oh no, no, no, don’t tell me you brought the honey dipper from the European Beekeeper’s Convention—"
Harry looked torn. Draco didn’t know why, only that it was getting on his nerves, too. He stepped closer to Harry. “Hey.”
“I died,” Potter said quickly, swallowing, “in that forest. And then for some reason I came back again. At first everything was alright. But—but then everything changed. It was so…bloody loud, all the time. The press, the people, the funerals…the Muggle traffic. I couldn’t stand the Floo so I shut it down. Ron and Hermione had to walk to my flat to see me.” He laughed lightly, as if to himself. “I hated my job. Four…no, three weeks into the training session I quitted Auror because I couldn’t stand the hexes. All the wands shooting spells, all the people around me…I froze. I was—a liability. I couldn’t make it through a week without taking sleeping potions because every time I didn’t, I…I dreamed. Of where I went after I died. King’s Cross.” He glanced at Draco, then, a smile playing at his lips. “It was all white. Nothing else. Just…white.”
“He’s bound to ask questions next Monday,” Draco muttered as he picked up his light coat. They were ready to leave, Harry waiting by the door. “All the questions he’d come up with after a weekend of brooding. Circe, kill me now.”
Harry was up to something.
It was some obscure holiday that Draco didn’t know of which went on for months.
Draco stared at the door as if from a dream. He had never heard his heartbeat louder, clearer. All around him was the haze of heat, slowly fading, fading—until at last he felt nothing other than the cold air, the bone-seeping chilliness.
Rain starts falling at midnight and descends into a heavy downpour in no time. The sky opens up, and it lets go of the heaviness it’s been burgeoning. Lightning strikes behind the clouds, followed by rumbling thunder that shakes the city. Harry’s eyes are open as he looks out of the window, now streaked with tiny rivers. His glasses on the nightstand reflect the panes and are streaked with rivers as well, droplets racing each other down.
He wasn’t quiet, he didn’t think so. He just…zoned out a little more often. Tuned out of conversations without noticing. He would be tracing over the lines of Molly-the-sheep’s face and pause, his charcoal stilling on the parchment as he stared, unseeing. His mind elsewhere. The charcoal leaving a tiny, thick mark, an indent in the parchment.
Slowly and carefully, the way old men do, they wrap their arms around each other and thread their fingers. Draco’s hand gentle at his shoulder, a familiar touch. They know how much to bend their elbows, how close to hold the other’s waist, know when to lift their feet so they don’t step on each other. Know how much to twirl so they still stay in each other’s arms.
Draco looked around. Then he noticed that he was, in fact, sitting on a couch. A hard one at that, the mattress barely giving; sooty, the edges rubbed raw. What covered him was the ugliest quilt he had ever seen. Blocks of brick red and pear yellow sewed together, and on top were embroidered patterns Draco made out only after straining his head an odd angle: a sun surrounded by exaggerated waves of beaming lights, the thin nail of a crescent moon, winding vines that stretched and thickened and thinned, curling at the tips. On one corner was a patch of wildflowers of all colors: violet, sorbet, icy blue. The edges were held together by a thin thread of silver that was coming loose. Draco rubbed his fingers against it.
“Wager he won’t make it to Easter.”
“He found two dragons and brought them home with him.  It is rare for any wizard to truly tame a dragon, but Cepheus could extend his will over them perfectly.  They obeyed him with the same loyalty and devotion as you’d find in a hound.  But he also came with someone else – can you guess?”
It had been a childish moment, really.  It would have been better to take Harry straight to Voldemort.  So many things would have been different if he had…. But somehow in that instance it had not even occurred to him.  The Dark Mark was already branded into his skin, but he had never really managed to think like a Death Eater.  He had only thought of humiliating Harry, never of truly harming him.
“Well then,” he said savagely. “Find me a solution.”
“I failed you. I know I did.  I failed you over and over again. I went against myself, okay?  But that’s not gonna happen anymore.  I’m not gonna let it.” A sob broke through and his entire chest heaved.  “Do you believe me? Please believe me?”
“I am so proud of you, my darling, you know my father was just your age when he went on this quest as well.”
Harry shook his head. “No, my legs can’t hold me.”
Lucius Malfoy had known that something was
He answered with a  shake of his head.  “I remember the night they died, and his laugh, and the flash of green light, nothing else-” as he finished talking, he reached over and grabbed Draco’s hand, pulling it against his chest.
Although they both tried their best to ignore these little failings, his dreams would not let him forget. Night had become torturous, with vivid nightmares that often left him shaking and vomiting.  Although he never told Harry so, he was sure that he knew his visions had to do with his corpse.  With each mangled limb moving across the night. With the smell of the grave he had dug up.  He even remembered the sensation of diving his hand into the puddle of flesh and organs, trying to dig out his knife.
It made him ache, longing so much for something so terribly impossible.
“Can’t last much longer.”
“Did you sleep?”
Harry traced Draco’s likeness on the page with the tip of his finger and Draco felt a jolt of something.  He remembered himself at 14, angry and scared, masking it oh so well behind a façade of arrogance.  He really wondered what his past self would have said if he could see them at this moment.  If he could have known everything that was to happen.
These days Draco crept around the house like a mouse.  He had no occupation, no friends, no girlfriend. Nothing a normal boy would want.  His life was contained, and he looked increasingly sickly.
“But if you could?”
He barely heard the words; he was already moving towards Harry.
The hallway felt eternal and each time they went through another doorway his head was unceremoniously banged against the wall, until it was ringing.
He knew well enough where Harry was, because he had been the one to lay him to rest.
At first, he paid no attention to their talk about the future, but as he grew stronger, a new idea began to form in his mind.  It was not a clear plan, just a thought, hazy and wayward.  Sometimes it seemed ridiculous to him, the whimsical desires of an overgrown boy.  Other times it was frightening, and malicious, a dark thing that had to be hidden from others, even his parents.
Harry nodded, and then asked in a smaller voice.  “Do I have a stomach?”
At the other end he could see something.  At first he thought it was a sacrificial altar, made of stone, but as he got closer it seemed too small.  He looked at the walls and the floor as he went deeper into the room, searching for symbols or objects, but there were none.  When he was halfway through the room he realized that the object he had spotted was actually a sarcophagus.
Their years together were full of moments like these.  And in his naivete Draco had thought they would have so many more.  That they would always be as they had been – that his life would continue revolving around Potter, even into adulthood.  When they met again in Malfoy Manor or even in the Room of Requirement, it had felt like just another of their innumerable face offs.  He had never quite considered that it would be the last he would ever see of Harry Potter.
“I don’t want you to have any consequences. I’m the one who-”
The Dark Lord released him, and Draco tumbled to the floor again, like a rag doll.  “Your son’s motives were indeed very personal.  How would you describe your own, Narcissa?”
To add to that concern, there was the fact that his extremities would sometimes blacken.  They looked like they had gotten nasty frostbite and his only solution was to soak them in Dittany.  That seemed to solve the problem, but only temporarily.  It was also concerning that the rot seemed to be spreading.  Sometimes, when Harry stretched or scratched at his skin, Draco would get a whiff of the nauseating smell of rotten flesh.
“If you think so.”
When they entered, Harry was flat against the bed.  Diri was by his side.  The blood had all been cleaned off, but he was deathly pale and his eye was closed.  “What happened to him?” said Narcissa as she looked from him to Draco.
Harry said nothing.
Harry had no reaction to this.  Maybe he couldn’t even understand what Draco was saying.
“He’s going to survive tonight, but he’s not stable.”
“I don’t feel anything-” he said, more blood coming out of his mouth with each word.
Again, he was not given the time to answer, instead another spell pulled him forward, bringing him forcefully to his feet as it did so.  He was pulled, almost magnetically, towards Voldemort.  His arms pinned to his side, unable to move.
“Can we go out?” Harry asked.
“Yes,” Narcissa grinned.  “A very beautiful princess, with long blonde hair.”
“Yes, she had died years before, waiting for him.  Cepheus stumbled into the room and collapsed at the base of her bed.  He thought himself defeated.  Castles can be built again.  And new dragons may hatch.  But one’s love is irreplaceable.”
“You don’t feel hunger?”
“Not hungry?”
When Harry had been alive, outdoing and outshining him had been his life’s purpose.  Now it all would be reversed, and he would do everything in his power to bring Harry happiness. To give him rest. To give him peace.  To keep him safe.  He would shield him from everything that was going on in the world. Draco would gladly dedicate his life to him.
It was only in that moment that he really realized that this would be the end for them.
He buried him with magic, and in haste.  It was possible, no, probable that he missed parts.  He knew he had four limbs, and his torso, but there were bound to be digits missing, and internals too.  The fear of getting caught had stopped him from being thorough.  He had dumped him into the earth with no ceremony, no markings, nothing but an old banner over his body.  He had not even taken the time to piece together the bits he had collected.  He dumped them into the earth and sealed it up, covering it as best he could so that others would not come to disturb him.
It was strange that it should look just how he remembered it. Part of him wished that the place had refused to piece itself together after the Battle.  That the magic that had spilled over that terrifying day and night would mark it forever.  But no – it seemed the stone had forgotten – so much more effectively than he himself had.
“On that point we disagree,” said Voldemort.  He took a step back, his eyes moving up and down Harry’s body and then turning to Draco again.  “Have you come up with an answer?”
“It is so good to see you doing better,” said Narcissa squeezing his hand under the table.
At these words, another surge of anger seemed to ignite within the Dark Lord and he crucioed Lucius again.  The second scream was wild, animalistic, more like a howl than any human noise Draco had ever heard.  Lucius flopped onto his back, each of his limbs moving disjointedly, pure, clear sobs rocking his body.  And Draco would feel that same pain again, so very soon, and looking at Lucius felt just like staring into a mirror.
Draco was preparing a retort, when Narcissa stepped in for him.  “My love-“ she said in her most docile tone.  “You make an excellent point-” she got up gracefully from her seat and moved across the grass to stand beside him, one of her hands on his shoulder.  “There are so many opportunities for Draco here,” her fingers caressed his long blonde hair, and Draco could see the tension leaving his shoulders.  “You have made such a place for our family,” her words were dipped in adoration.
The house was quiet, its exterior sad and imposing.  The whole place had dried up since Voldemort had been stationed here, the lushness and beauty that his father had taken such pride in swallowed up into dry, cracked earth.  Maybe when this was over, Draco thought, as he quietly slipped through a narrow opening in the gate, they should find a new place of residency.  Start over somewhere untainted.  Or maybe, like Cepheus, it was time for Draco to leave his old life and start off a life with only Harry to cling to.
Narcissa snapped: “Please refrain from speaking about my family in that way.”
Harry began to say something but just as he opened his mouth the Dark Lord raised his wand.  He spoke no words but instinctively Draco knew was happening to him and flinched at the thought of that pain again.  In contrast to him, Harry did not scream, he did not convulse, his body stayed just the same, and for the first time Draco was grateful that he could not feel anything.
The room was deathly quiet.
Harry’s hand reached out and touched his forearm, just where the Dark Mark was.  Their eyes found each other and, again, Draco had that sense that speech was unnecessary between them, like they were connected. It was not legilimency, or some potion.  This was a true and perfect understanding.  Draco shifted closer to him, putting his head on the other’s shoulder.  “You know.”
The smell of death and rot hit him even before he saw the mangled remains.  It was heavy and vile, and every instinct in his body was telling him to step away, to disengage.  He gagged at the smell, and then, thinking quickly, formed a magical air bubble around his nose and mouth like he would if he were swimming.
“It did not.  No one can cheat death, remember?”
“I felt like that without you.  Everything was meaningless.”  He reached over and grabbed Harry’s hand, intertwining their fingers.  The gesture felt so right, like two perfect puzzle pieces coming together.  “I really couldn’t stand it.”
He almost wanted to cry, to freeze time, to be here, with Harry, forever.
The cold weather began, and with it came rain, and wind, and hale.  In another age the elements would have bothered him, he was, after all, a creature of indoor comforts, but now they came with an odd thrill.  He found a new comfort being out and seeing the rage of nature around him. It was cathartic, and powerful, much like old magic.  He began sensing when storms approached, and instead of shielding himself from them in his tent, he would spend those nights, awake outside, wandering beneath his cloak, letting the wind and the rain beat at him.
“Never trusted
“I have seen inside your head.  If I want you to truly pay for what you did, I must have you live.”  He laughed for the third time, shill, and cold, and loud as thunder.
Now that the barrier to Hogwarts had been forever broken, he could apparate directly to the school itself.  He chose an inconspicuous spot, right at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, and for extra discretion he kept the invisibly cloak over himself.
“I wouldn’t have just let you…”
Sometimes, he really thought he was losing his head.
In truth, Draco was not sure how much Harry remembered of the time before, nor was he certain that he wanted to ask him.  Talking seemed almost unnecessary, like they were in some deep understanding beyond it.  He pushed that thought away as well, grateful that Harry wasn’t arguing about elf rights or anything like that.  Instead he ran his fingers lightly up and down Harry’s forearm, feeling the softness of his hair and the smoothness of his skin.
Outside the day was clear and cold, but he had no time to admire it. A second later he had apparated away.
Harry gave another lurch forward and more blood spouted – too much blood.
“Oh yes, the legend tells us that they lived a hundred years together.  That he learned so much from her, and that he cared for her every day of his life.  He is supposed to be buried somewhere in the mountains of Scotland, and they say there is a spellbook there, buried with him.”
Not for the first time Draco was brought back to something Narcissa had told him as a boy:
“And what was her name?”
An almost academic curiosity took over Voldemort as he surveyed Harry closely.  “It didn’t work properly, I take it.”
“Yes, but you know very well I have loved you my entire life.”
“Mum,” he whispered.
“What was it like?” Draco whispered, finally feeling like it was time to break their silence.
Draco watched them gash Harry’s face, over and over again, with increasing frenzy, the blood spilling and turning his face into an unrecognizable horror. Now, it wasn’t only that it didn’t look like Harry, it was that it did not even look human anymore.  He watched them flail the skin from his arms, with spells that he had never even heard of before. He watched them cut off both of his ears and then make them dance above his head as they jeered.
His parents looked formidable together, like pale marble statues.  He smiled at each of them and then he turned on the spot and apparated away.
Draco would stay awake late into the night, watching him breathing.  Watching this miraculous boy who had survived so much, and had chosen, was choosing every day, to remain by his side.  Draco had always thought he knew what love was.  His parents surely loved him.  His parents surely loved each other.  And plenty of other people had loved him: Pansy, and Crabbe, and Goyle.  It was only now that he was realizing the falseness of this assumption.
“Sometimes I thought I was just really lucky, other times I thought I was just strange.”
At that moment, and for the first time in his life, he found himself without anything to long for.  This was it – this was all he wanted.
He stayed like this for a long time.  Longer than he felt he should have.  He kept counting to a hundred and then telling himself he had to start, but somehow, he could not find the strength.  Many times, he wondered if Narcissa was still here, if she was still watching him, and if she was, why she hadn’t come to his aid yet.  Maybe she trusted in his strength.   Or maybe she knew that this was not for her to interfere with.
“Me neither.”  He ran his fingers through his shoulder length hair. It was greasy at the top and full of knots in the back.   He really needed to take a bath.
For the span of several minutes Draco stayed perfectly still.  He read over his translation again and again, mouthing the words to himself as if they were the enchantment.  When he got down to the small, uneven spell at the bottom he traced the writing with his fingertips.  Had Cepheus been the last to use it? The first to use it? Had he really been so powerful he could create spells for life and death? Was that the ancestry that Draco had coursing through his veins? Was that the greatest legacy of his family?
Ever since he had remembered Narcissa’s tales, he had wanted this to happen. At first it had been a half-formed thought, but everyday it got clearer, it got stronger.  And since he had begun his travels this goal had filled with urgency.  But now he realized this was not going to be as swift or easy as he had anticipated.
Having read through many of his father’s books on Dark Arts Draco was certain of what it required.  He pulled a ceremonial dagger from his robes and pricked his palm with it, watching the cut bleed red.  He smeared it over the symbol, pushing his palm against the stone to get the blood rushing faster. He stepped back when he thought there was enough and a moment later the whole wall vanished, revealing a very dark, dingy passage.
“My Lord-” this time it was Narcissa’s voice that cut through the room.  “My son did wrong, but not for the reasons that you think.  He did not bring Potter back because he is your adversary, he brought him back because – because he is
It was of a sturdy build, the binding thick but supple. It had no title, no markings on the spine, but it bore telltale signs of having been much used.  The binding had the indentation of fingernails, and scorch marks, and something dark that looked like ink at one of the corners.  He pressed his palm against it before pulling it open.
She fell quiet, as if this was the end of her story.  Next to her Draco frowned and pressed a hand to her forearm, pressing against the warmth of her skin.  He needed to hear more.
He began his search within the book as clumsily as he had begun his search for the grave.  He flipped through the pages quickly hoping to see the runes for death or resurrection.  He scanned pages in a few seconds and then turned them over.  The book was mostly written in a crisp slanted hand, but sometimes there were illustrations too, of the moon, or a cauldron, or a sacrificial stone.  Each time he got to one he would pause, admiring its vibrancy despite it having lived through 500 years of darkness.  This way of searching, however, proved futile.  He was far too careless, and after only an hour or so he reached the back of the book, having discovered nothing.
“I don’t have to eat.  You do.”
Within 24 hours his mother had arranged it all.
“We fear your greatness!” exclaimed Narcissa, over the animal noises coming out of her husband’s mouth.  “We fear your power.  As do all, Death Eater or not.”
Voldemort seemed to consider this for a moment.  “The question is: is there anything I need from you?” His eyes went from her, to Lucius crying on the floor, to Draco, suspended above.  “I do not believe so.”  He gave Lucius a kick.  “Your husband is empty now.  Your son is weak.  And however attractive you may be to other men, you do not tempt me.”
“Yeah, it’s me-“ he made a sound that was half a sob, half a laugh.  “Your rival at school, remember?”
“I like them, too.”
Harry was quiet.  “I don’t have to, you know?”
“No, her name is Diri”
What if he had just said something else? What if he hadn’t talked about mudbloods?  What if he had actually asked Harry a question?  What if he had tried to be nice to him despite the fact he looked like a poor boy? Would everything be different, his whole life?
The search and the journey were changing him, both in ways he recognized and ways he was blind to.  For instance, he knew that he had begun the habit of earnestly talking to himself (or to Harry).  And he realized that he was spending the majority of his time, particularly if he was outside of the tent, wearing the invisibility cloak.  This was not only to feel closer to Harry, but because the cloak itself was old magic, and it seemed to be connecting him to his quest.
There were two corpses there.  They were not, as Draco had expected, skeletons: they still had flesh on them, and clothes, and hair.  It made for a ghastly sight.  The one on the left he identified as a woman, but only by the cut of her dress.  Her hair, long and blonde, came streaming across her shoulders and down past her hip.  Her face was hideous, and somewhat resembling an old tree trunk.  Its colouring was dingy and yellowed, with a section of putrid green.  Her arms were neatly folded over her stomach, skeletal fingers intertwined.  The remarkable thing was that whoever had buried her had chosen to leave her eyes open.  Big blue eyes, shinny and blank, like those of a doll.   That was worst of all, because it made the haggard, half rotten remains look human, a little
And then he fell into it again – a dazzling fantasy that was growing in reach every day – an alternate world where he and Harry had been friends.  Where they rode the train together.  Where Draco got to hear Harry’s ideas, his thoughts, his experiences outside of Hogwarts.  Where he told Harry all about his life, all about his parents, and the long legacies of both of his families, and the weighty responsibilities that he bore as the one heir to both.
“Do you think I could find it?”
“We could have had years.”
“I shall,” she gave his cheek a chaste kiss. “You’re very busy with the Ministry of course, it was silly of me to suggest it.”  She looked over at Draco conspiratorially.  “Is that agreeable to you darling?”
It did not surprise Narcissa that her husband returned with an entourage or that the Dark Lord had a wand to his throat.  It didn’t even surprise her that there were seven other Death Eaters surrounding him, their faces hidden behind bone masks.  Oh, no, this was not surprising.  She had warned Draco time and again to be more discrete, to be more cautious, to build a better façade behind which they could all hide.
“Easter?! He won’t make it to Sunday.”
Multiple truths existed for him, simultaneously, in an incomprehensible patchwork of memories, dreams, and thoughts, which he had lost the ability to distinguish from each other.
He moved a little closer, his head right over Draco’s heart.  “Are you okay?”
magic.”
“You don’t know, you don’t understand.”
After that the story of Cepheus faded from his memory once more.  There was so much else happening, and he had to keep his wits about him.  There was no time to be wasted on old fables, even if they did have half truths in them.
“No,” Draco said. “Why?”
“My photos are leaving, not me.” Harry took a deep breath. “I’m tired. Seven years, and I enjoyed every minute of it, but I miss home.” He smiled ruefully at Draco. “There was not a moment that I didn’t miss you. Every place I went, everything I saw, I thought—I thought, if only I could show it to you. If only you could see it now. I wanted to—I guess I thought—I guess I thought that if I came back, then everything would be…”
“It’s okay,” Harry says again. Scratches the kitten’s ear, yawns as he readjusts himself on the pillow. “It’s okay.”
“But we mustn’t open our Christmas presents on Christmas Eve. It’s not tradition.”
“And the blizzards that almost killed me.”
“Oh.” Harry lets out a laugh, nudges their noses together. “You’re still
He hugged his knees close to his chest.
“So,” Astoria said as she poured her tea. Looked up. “You’re back.”
“It doesn’t mean
Harry reassures her that he is going to be alright. Ron wraps his arm around her as they leave, Hermione looking over her shoulder even as their silhouettes become tiny. Harry waves until their backs finally disappear, and then he heads back into his flat.
Harry cracks one open, too, and holds it close to the kitten. The kitten eyes it before looking away, tucking itself into Luna’s belly.
So he was herded into Potter’s room, seated on Potter’s bed. Draco had a mind to say that he could wait in the living room, that it was just a bite, that it didn’t require such fuss—but didn’t, instead watched mindlessly as Potter rummaged through his room. Potter had taken off his coat, had tossed it onto the piling sack on the back of his chair. His sweater hugged his sturdy back. Draco looked at the frames of pictures on the table, at the thin booklets lying flat on their backs, Potter’s words a faint blur at the edge of his mind.
Harry opens his mouth. Closes it. “So he just stays as a kitten? Is there nothing we can do?”
Harry came out, bleary-eyed, just as Draco was about to put the trays into the oven. He blinked. Draco flushed. He had flour smeared across his cheeks, had cookie dough clotted on his apron.
Astoria had signed.
Draco swallowed and walked along the hall. There were pictures of mountains, of seas, of a sky flaring into color; of old houses, a stray cat with its face buried in a can of fish; there were pictures of old men, two middle-aged women with their arms around each other’s waist, young boys grinning and little girls blowing bubbles out of a straw. All the places that Harry had been to; all the people that he had met. They had breathed, briefly, the same air as Harry had breathed. Walked the earth that Harry had walked. Exchanged smiles as Harry would have smiled at them, bright and earnest.
Potter blinked. “I don’t know any jokes.”
A flock of swallows started from their hiding places in the forest, gliding above his head. With each stroke on the parchment the world faded around him until at last, it was just this: his mind, a resounding well. It quieted, the leftover hum of emotions lapping against the wall, echoing and amplifying, throwing wavy lights all over the place. Warmth laced with grief and overlapped with his memories, scattered pieces: of Potter’s woolen sweater rough against his cheek, of the cold lips of a bottle knocked against his teeth. Of the hazel of mistaken-Astoria’s hair. Of the moment the sharp pain stung through his chest and he thought his heart stopped beating but it didn’t—pounding, instead, brimming with life. The strokes became a thing of its own, his sooty fingers guiding the charcoal of their own accord, tracing lines, thickening—
Narcissa paid him no heed and continued.  “I have a gift for you before you go-”  she withdrew something long and silvery from her pocket.
After checking to make sure Lucius was still in bed, Draco and Harry set out.  The day was cold but pretty, with a breeze that fluttered through the invisibility cloak and against their cheeks.  They walked together closely, hidden beneath it, Draco’s arm protectively around Harry’s waist.
He beamed and pulled on the sleeve of her black velvet dress. “What did he do? Did he bring her back from the dead?”
It seemed to him with every retelling the story grew more vivid, more detailed, like a painting, gaining details with additional brushstrokes.
She shoved the house elf out of her way and lay a hand against Harry’s forehead.  Then she lowered her hand checking his pulse at his throat.  She knelt by him, withdrawing her wand from an inside pocket and tracing over him.  It emitted a low blue light as it hovered over his torso.  She turned her head to look at Draco and said: “Has he had pain?”
There was a chorus of agreements from around him, but Draco did not hear it.  He was full of disbelief.  He did not want it.  He would not do it.  He could not stand it.  To live, alone in this house, with his father, forever.  He vomited again at the very idea, and several of the Death Eaters laughed.
“I will,” he assured her.
With the disjointed awkwardness of a toddler, Harry moved his limbs and rose, with help from Draco’s good hand.  Carefully Draco guided him to step outside the tub, till they were standing right next to each other, naked under the moonlight.
Lucius embraced him and kissed his cheek.  Draco was surprised to see fear in his eyes, as if his father thought this might be their last moments together.  When they broke apart Narcissa reached out and grabbed his hand.
From where he lay on the floor, Harry shook his head.
On the afternoon of the full moon he waited around the edge of the Forest, expecting to see the narrow shape of Narcissa in a black cloak.  He was not disappointed.
“Would you like it here?” Draco whispered.  “Would you think it’s pretty?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “We don’t need to trust them; I will deal with them after.”
Harry gave a shrug.
Draco had no idea why, but it was those two words that broke the dam, and suddenly, violently, he was sobbing, gripping onto Harry with all the strength in him.  Putting his head on the other’s boy’s shoulder.  He wanted to say so many things then.  He wanted to say how much he loved him, and how he was not, under any circumstance, going to let him slip away.  That he would not watch him die again.  That they would have more snowy days, more baths, more sunrises.  That they would have decades and decades of time.  But his throat ached and his words were incomprehensible between his sobs.
Other things, he was oblivious to.  Like the fact that he was slowly losing weight.  That his face was gaunt, and the circles around his eyes darker than ever. He had not looked in a mirror since leaving his mother’s house, but if he had, Draco would have been shocked by his own reflection.  There was little of Lucius’s grace and dignity left in his features.  In fact, he was looking more like dear aunt Bellatrix by the day.  There was something new in his grey eyes, something unnatural, something Black.
Draco quickly gave up on the idea of this being simple, or easy, and started from the beginning again.  This time he went painstakingly slowly, rune by rune, even going so far as to pass his wand through the yellowed margins of each word in search for some secret inscription.  He made out entire sentences wondering if Cepheus had concealed this most powerful of all spells in the thicket of something entirely different.  By nightfall he had only gone through a dozen or so pages and he was tired.
It was cold, and perfect, snowflakes drifting in slow motion.  He stopped to take a deep breath of that cold air, which seemed to purity as it touched.  He was just thinking that this had been a very good idea when wham – he was hit by a well-aimed snowball right in the chest.
However, quickly enough other interests took precedence.  Quidditch, and Potter; his studies, and Potter; keeping a dedicated band of followers, and Potter.  It was a lot of work, actually, and the longer he spent away from his mother, the more he saw her stories as nothing more than old wizarding fairy tales.  In reality no wizard, no matter how great, could fly, or transform into any animal, or raise the dead.  That was kids’ stuff.  And Draco had more important things on his mind.
She smiled, serenely.  “The Dark Lord always repays loyalty.” She handed Harry’s cloak over to him.  “This is an old magical artifact, handed down from generation to generation, it belongs with an old wizarding family; it belongs with you.”
Harry gave him a look that was almost pitying and then said:  “I think it’s just part of this whole thing. A consequence.”
He had expected to be anxious in the wilderness, instead he found a sort of peace.  There was no need to pretend anymore, and no one to please.  He spent the first week in a clearing in a forest, looking through the extensive notes and maps that generations of Blacks had left to guide him.  His grandfather Cygnus had been especially good at keeping track of all the places that he had already investigated, which of course would make Draco’s search easier (and hopefully more fruitful).
Just as dusk was coming, she apparated, moving quietly between the trees.  Under the cloak, he went to her.  “Did you bring what I asked for?”
He remembered the question and the look in her eyes as he said it, but for some reason he had no idea what she had answered.  It was just gone.
Grandiose and regal, the Dark Lord slowly rose from his throne.  The room was full of blood and a smell so vile that Draco found himself vomiting all over the carpet.   “Draco-” Narcissa said, her voice breaking.  He could not bear to turn around and look at her. He did not want to see her again.  He did not want to see anything ever again.
“Yes.”
Everything would be different after that.
Draco lay awake for a long time without moving.
There was a small sound, somewhere between a gasp and moan and  Draco shifted his eyes to see Narcissa.
He rolled his eyes. “Nothing you’re not used to,” he muttered under his breath.
And Draco was treated to the bizarre sight of more snow being lifted up by an invisible force and then hurled at him.  Luckily, he moved out of the way just in time to avoid it, scooping up some snow of his own and aiming for where he thought Harry was. They played like this until they were both panting and exhausted, and then they lay down on the snow together, Harry’s lead on his lap.
It felt like he had been awake a million years, or like he had never learned how to sleep.  He moved towards the tent slowly, his trajectory crooked, as if he were intoxicated.  Harry held on to his hand and walked a step behind him, timidly, like a child.
He stepped forward, moving to sit by her and taking her hand, so that she could feel the warmth of him. “I need you,” he said simply.
He remembered shouting something at Harry, something foolish that didn’t sound like him at all.  Maybe he told him to run.  Or maybe he told him to grab the invisibility cloak and vanish.  He really meant those words as he said them, but that was only because he did not fully understand the situation.
“You’re sure nothing hurts? Maybe something happened yesterday that triggered it?”
“I don’t care,” said Draco, his eyes and attention entirely focused on Harry.  “Just help me!”
And all he had to do was nod.
The idea was so ghastly that Draco could not begin to wrap his head around it.  How could he live after this? How could he exist in any form, settle into any kind of normality? It was impossible.  This had to be the end of his life, there could be no after-
