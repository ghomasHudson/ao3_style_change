– and nothing short of that would ever be enough.
“This can wait,” he said at last, stealing Draco’s cruel quote from earlier.  A devious smile played about his kiss-swollen lips.  “After all, we have a date to finish, and you owe me some sweets.”

, Draco thought,
Draco took a moment to size Harry up in the most theatrical way possible.  “Merlin, Potter!  How did you describe me?”
Following his long training sessions, Draco would return upstairs for some supper before gearing up for his match.  Bagman would usually give him some kind of pep talk, telling him which players not to check or how many minutes he should let the snitch escape before getting serious; all of it related directly to the man’s nightly bets.  That was their deal – Draco flew exclusively for him, and so he earned a cut of Bagman’s winnings.

Potter’s eyes finally flicked from the wand up to meet his.  They were shocked and narrowed and furious.
In the week following his realization, Draco tried his hardest to go back to work as usual – he slammed himself against the never-ending tide of potions to brew and unrealistic expectations to meet.  He suffered Morpheus’ snide comments about his accent and slept in two-hour shifts to stir the trickier potions at intervals.  His hands twinged and cramped as he worked, and his knuckles dried and cracked from scouring.  But still, he persevered.
He sat back even further and narrowed his eyes at the man beneath him.  “I got those boots fourth year, and you

This time, they hadn’t even gotten their clothes off before Draco had shoved them into a shower stall.  Harry had only just started on his buttons – a task he quickly gave up when he realized they weren’t stopping.  Draco had pressed him into the spray, smirk sharp and hungry as Harry’s Quidditch leathers quickly began to soak through.

“Fuck,” Harry mumbled, completely satiated.
A shiver ran through Draco.  At the word, but also the trust Harry was placing in him.  He nodded.

“Surprised you?”
“I’m sorry!  Did you…did you sleep at all?”
But then he saw Potter wasn’t moving.

Harry frowned like it still wasn’t getting through to him.
“You just mean you want to nap,” Draco teased, adoration coloring his voice helplessly.
Harry huffed an ironic little laugh.  “That’s right.  I figured it would be less conspicuous than leaving from the front doors of Hogwarts, skipping hand-in-hand.”
The man reached for Draco’s belt, and he pushed him away as an instinctual reaction.  In this game of teasing and dominance, it felt wrong to let Harry undress him.  Too intimate, too revealing of his infinite softness for this man – the weakness he left unguarded now that it seemed things might go his way.

– all for the sake of a man who could never love him back.  Now, he’d be facing Lucius Malfoy within the hour and likely getting a citation from McGonagall – if he wasn’t outright fired due to Howlers from outraged parents – and there’d still been no sign of Harry.  He rather feared that he wouldn’t show up today at all.
“Right,” Harry managed, when he got his face under control.  “See you then.”  His eyes met Draco’s a little wildly, clearly wanting to say more, but not with McGonagall standing right there.
Draco felt his mouth go dry.

But alas, there were more opinions to be added to the pot.

It’s about the permission to dole out absolute

Alright, so he was a bit cross with Harry as he straightened his clothes and entered Honeydukes still uncomfortably aroused, but who could blame him?  A minute ago, he’d had Harry Potter pressing him into a wall and snogging him senseless – who in their right mind would be happy to part with
But, of course, these moments were only temporary.  In the back of his mind, folded carefully under layers of Occlusion, lay his thoughts of his father and what they might mean.  Thoughts that were too often dragged to the surface by well-intentioned urgings by Harry, of all people.
Surprising himself, Draco let out a short, tentative laugh at her joke.  She looked a little shocked as well, though not in a bad way.  “Yes.  Yes, it would,” he said with a shy, somewhat wry smile of his own.
Together, they were adorable.  And suddenly, he found himself wondering if this was more of a “couples costume” than a friendly coordination.
He looked up at Harry, barely daring to gauge his expression.  As yet, it was neutral.

And it certainly wasn’t his latent pitifulness that caused Hannah Abbott – or rather, Hannah Longbottom, now – to sit down at his table with a shy chuckle and a greeting of, “Oh no, who’s stuck on your mind?”
He took dinner in his room and read through some more of

Draco glanced up sharply, blinking in confusion.  Harry’s blush arrested him, making him slide into a smile for real.  “Of course you don’t,” he murmured.
“No,” said his mother, and then the judge turned to him.
He was gratified when she swatted him with a roll of parchment, lip twitching even more dramatically.  “Don’t be insufferable, Mister Malfoy.  I hear you came to ask a favor.”
Draco froze.

McGonagall finished her speech and dismissed everyone, but when he glanced up, he saw her coming straight for him.
He left Morpheus dazed and slumped against the counter and swept into the back to collect his meager possessions and the stack of letters from his mother.  He considered nabbing some ingredients, but then realized they would be useless where he was going.  He didn’t linger further.  Mechanically, he unlocked the back door and slipped out into the night.
Another second of shuffling, and his trousers were tugged off completely.  Harry kicked off his shoes next, stumbling and hissing as the wand dug further into his neck, but the bulge in his pants growing all the while.
FRED and GEORGE: [in unison] Cedric!!!
[Cut to SIRIUS laughing and goofing off with the emcees once more.  In the foreground, a perfect loaf of challah lies cooling on the rack.  We cut again – this time to GINNY, who is staring into her oven with a disgruntled expression on her face.]
Draco chanced a glance at Grant’s face, and the expression he found there was hungry.  The man’s eyes lingered upon his waist, long after the spell was complete, and so Draco wasn’t even surprised when he reached out to grab it.  It felt inevitable.  He’d seen the glances, felt the heat of that gaze on the pitch, in the pub – he’d known the price when he’d agreed to be healed.

) before he had become a teacher less than two measly months ago.  But since then, he’d seen countless incidents of childish clumsiness that had been both dramatic and ludicrous in scope.  Like the time Jimmy had spelled his hands to his broom in an attempt to keep his seat, and not even Madam Pomfrey could undo it after flying class had come to an end.  He’d ended up sitting through Potions and Herbology that day holding a broom, and Longbottom – with infinite amusement – had made him mix the planters with it like an ill-shaped gardening shovel.

She only smirked in response.  “Ready for your debut tonight?”
Frankly, Draco was doing everything he could not to rise to the bait.  But the extreme mortification was getting to him, for sure.
[Cut to an array of puddings – some firm and proud, some sagging dejectedly.  In the corner of the screen, it reads, ‘Week 3: Saucy Puds.’  Down below that text, there is a sub-note, almost too small to read: ‘Contestant Argus Filch was sadly eliminated between weeks 2 and 3 due to multiple food safety violations.’  It cuts to VOLDEMORT, looking very sanctimonious as he professes his expertise on ‘saucy puds.’]
I hope you're enjoying the bits about Draco's past - they're honestly the most fun for me to write at this point, since they're all new material.  Anyway, hope everyone is well and staying safe!
Draco found himself snorting in delight as Potter flipped around to try and escape.  “Potter,” he called.
“No, he can’t,” his mother confirmed, ignoring her husband entirely.  At that moment, with Lucius’ immature comments falling on deaf ears, the dynamic between the three of them seemed to drastically change: without intending to, Lucius had taken on the role of an unruly child – and from the defeated way he slumped in his chair, he must have realized it, too.

“Right.  Yes, you’re going to that Muggle pub you all like so much,” he remembered, trying to keep the bitterness out of his tone.  Harry, Granger, and Weasley still had their rituals – rituals that Draco was not privy to in places he was unwelcome.  He wondered vaguely what it would be like to join them, to have that warm camaraderie wash over him as they joked and laughed and drank.

And once he had noticed
Dear Draco,
He coughed a little at the bluntness, and felt a flush rising to his face.  “Yes...well…” he glanced around the room for inspiration, “Well, it’s not like everyone thinks of it that way, unfortunately.”  His eyes flickered back to Hannah to find her looking at him with a softer expression, like she’d just figured something out about him.  He wasn’t sure he liked it.
of it all, his constant war against shame.
Hey everyone!!  Hope you're all doing well.  I've had a bit of a hard few weeks, but I finally got my shit together to pound out another chapter.
The boy nodded hesitantly, and Draco sighed again.  “That’s probably your issue – this thing is ancient.”
“Oh, so he was dressed weirdly – that’s it,” Pansy huffed.  “You’re not going to find any answers in some sparking metal box.”
Regardless, it felt wonderful to turn his back on the thin line he’d been walking between showing interest and defensively retreating.  He could brush his leg against Harry’s under the table and know that it was welcome.  He could look into his eyes and release that idiotic grin that he’d been prone to since this morning’s desperate kiss.
Draco smiled, holding eye contact through hooded lids as he drew the carrot from the end of his fork.  He let his eyes flutter closed, wondering at the effect it would have on Potter.  If the man was imagining a less wholistic scenario, like he was.
him?  Reaching for him like it was the most natural thing in the world?

Harry was looking vaguely horrified at this point, so Draco wrapped up his thank-you speech there instead of waxing poetic about something awkward and terrible like “being saved.”  After another stunned moment, Harry mumbled, “Don’t mention it.  It was the right thing to do,” which was a dumb enough thing to say that Draco couldn’t help but smile.
“Bye.”  Draco had half of his hand in a glove when Harry turned and disappeared in a panic.  He smiled slowly into the silence, letting the warmth from earlier fill him again.
He watched Harry chew on the passive aggressive comment, no doubt selecting his next words very carefully.  It wouldn’t matter – the topic was already upsetting, so no amount of etiquette could disguise it.
He leveled a furious gaze at the man who had caused him so many problems, and was surprised to see vivid green eyes staring back at him.  Potter looked...
“No, not like that.”  Sam was starting to sound exasperated.  “Like

on Malfoy’s face?  Whatever it was, he couldn’t bear it.  He sped from the room, not bothering to wonder how it looked to their audience.
The “perfect thing” was guyliner, as it turned out.  Guyliner and black nail polish.  Hermione, after giving him a dissertation on why it was really “just eyeliner” because “it’s senseless to assign gender to makeup,” applied both with the steady hand of an expert – something Harry was not expecting – and by the time she was done with him, he wondered for the first time what

His eyes are swimming with the ghosts of puddings past, and you can see the moment the light leaves them and he comes to terms with his fate.]
Since the incident, Malfoy seemed to have gotten over whatever sympathy he felt for Harry too, as he’d been more infuriating than ever.  In the middle of tactical lectures, he would find Malfoy watching him—but whenever their gazes met, Malfoy’s face would morph into a smirk.  A smirk that told Harry he had lost, that Malfoy had beaten him in a game Harry had invented quite by accident.
of himself, and if that was unacceptable, then he would face the consequences head-on.  By removing the mystery from the equation, perhaps he could de-escalate the rumors; if he bore it brazenly, perhaps people would see beyond the shape carved into his skin.
“Oh, please call me Narcissa.  I’ve been well, Harry – and yourself?”
Draco paused, a feral smirk curving his lips.  He couldn’t contain it if he tried.  “Absolutely,” he purred.  “I’m surprised you noticed.”  He began kissing his way down Harry’s neck, marking his path with a destructive, flushed line.  Harry arched into his touch, head lolling to the side so Draco could devour him.
Potter was acting inexplicably weird this morning, and it bothered him that he had no idea as to the cause.  First, he showed up at breakfast with dark bags under his eyes, and now he was sputtering and spilling drinks, and Draco could’ve sworn he had flinched away from him when he had reached across him for a roll.
Draco frowned.  “Well, in a way, yes – however, the whole point is to remain in control of yourself and your situation.”  That’s all he’d ever wanted.  “As it is right now, my potion makes you lie about random things that cross your mind – which, depending on your random thoughts, can get a bit preposterous and would certainly raise suspicions in an investigative scenario.”
There was no use in trying; he had not a shot—
he meant.
When he arrived, he was astounded to find that Potter wasn’t there.

“I…well, no.  I suppose not.”
”  His breathing was coming out raggedly now – possessed as he was by his rage.

Draco kissed him savagely, undone by just the look in his eyes.

.  Yet distant.  And it was the second thought that sent Draco over the edge.  He narrowed his eyes and sneered, doing anything he could to convey his depthless ire.  Fuck mercy.  Fuck gratitude.
And so, he got to thinking.  If the “him” that he’d fought so hard to bring into the world was still unhappy, maybe Father was right about him after all.
For the scrimmage, he told his class to land and take notes of the moves they recognized in a desperate attempt to rein his thoughts back to professionalism.  It was a

As predicted, the man spun around angrily, color high on his face, only to be stunned into silence by the sight of Draco in only his pants before him.
Draco glared at him.  “Yes.”
But if he was to die, it was going to be against Harry’s mouth.  He ducked his head into the kiss, bringing their lips together, finally, in a culmination of that perpetual magnetism he’d felt pulling at him since age eleven.

wanted this – there was nothing wrong with that.
And, because Draco was feeling magnanimous, he agreed rather than provoking him further.  “Of course.  Students can be cruel – an unfortunate truth.”  As he said it, he wondered why he felt compelled to comfort the older man in front of him – a man who, for all intents and purposes, had disliked Draco since he first met him.

He let himself sputter and gasp unrestrainedly on the ground for another minute or two before the humiliation began to set in, and he sat up and tried to slow his breathing while schooling his expression as best he could.  Potter shuffled to do the same – though Draco forced himself not to look at him.  Which was partially why he startled so much when Potter spoke.

It wasn’t until three days later – or nights, rather, as Potter came banging on his door at nearly four in the morning – that his trick was finally acknowledged, and Draco could be openly triumphant about it.  Well, as triumphant as he could be, given the circumstances.

“What?”
[The camera pans to take in the proud, determined faces of HARRY POTTER, DRACO MALFOY, and CEDRIC DIGGORY.  HARRY looks slightly nervous, while DRACO has composed his face into an attentive, expressionless mask.  CEDRIC beams at the emcees, blissfully unaffected by the pressure of the finals.]
Granger paused her furious scribbling in her notebook to peek over the edge of the cauldron.  A little crease knit itself between her brows, and Draco was startled to realize that after today’s long session, it was starting to look familiar.  He’d never imagined he would know anything but Granger’s disdain.
As if reading the thoughts from across his face, Malfoy grinned a wicked, private smile, then drew him into a step backwards, then forwards, then a tight, unanticipated spin.
“What does it

Harry clenched the quill harder in his grip, a muscle in his forehead twitching as he suffered Draco’s incessant teasing.  “Get it yourself, Malfoy.  I’m busy here.”
FRED AND GEORGE: [in unison, turning to face camera] Welcome to biscuits week!
Draco didn’t ever want to leave Harry’s room, and so he didn’t.  He stayed lounging about on the furniture until Harry had the good sense to ask the elves to send up some dinner.  As usual, they demonstrated their fervent adoration of the man by sending the most mouth-watering bowls of stew – ones that Draco couldn’t recall ever being this good in the Great Hall – along with an assortment of freshly-baked rolls and a course of pudding to finish.

but also far too adorable.  That he cared about hygiene at a time like this was endearing, though Draco’s revived libido would say otherwise.
“I came to talk about the article,” Harry said, and the irksome shred of hope that Draco hadn’t managed to crush yet puffed out in his chest.
Draco had never seen a snake feeding before.  The sight pinned him to his chair in both terror and a numb fascination.  Those yellow glittering eyes – their glances pressed into his skin like a cold, maleficent promise.  It was only a matter of time before he, too...
She merely raised an eyebrow in response.

One week blended into two, and Draco spent every second he wasn’t teaching either brewing or reading or cursing the fates for entangling his life’s thread irrevocably with Potter’s.  Days like these, it truly felt like his feelings were coming up in knots – smooth and pleasant in some places, while snarled and unclarifiable in others.  It was maddening, and somehow his mother chose that exact week to show up unexpected at the castle.

Draco stood, grinning like a loon.  “Wouldn’t miss it,” he said – and he wouldn’t.  Not for anything in the world.
“I’d think of those green eyes of your glazing over as I fucked you.
Judge Graddlethorn’s eyes lingered upon him, and he brought the second thimble to his lips after only the slightest hesitation.
Harry stared long and searchingly into his eyes, a flash of that same fear cropping up before vanishing.  Draco wanted to press in, to step deeper into Harry’s mind – but at the same time, he didn’t need to.  Harry’s emotions were so reactive, so explosive, that just standing

Harry met him in Draco’s chambers an hour later, looking morose.
He swallowed away the tightness in his throat and leaned against the stands for a minute, digesting this new information.  Her parents were Muggleborn, he knew.  Were things like being gay more accepted in the Muggle world?  It was something he knew little about and therefore hadn’t considered.  But what if it was true?  What if the world that would accept him best was the one he had reviled as “backwards” and “unbearably ignorant?”
Draco turned to suggest that maybe they head back to the castle early, when-
That hesitant knock came again, and he figured that if it was McGonagall, she would’ve called out impatiently by now.  He walked over and opened the door.

They dove and raced across the pitch.  Draco did some warm-up laps as he bided his time waiting for the snitch to reappear.  The darkness seemed to throw Potter a bit at first, but Draco had long since gotten used to dangerous flying conditions.
He reread a section of “Lions and Snakes,” feeling more than a bit smug having his dirty prose in the same room as the one it was about.  Draco took his time pondering it, knowing another similarity between him and Potter was that the man hated being ignored.  He ignored him for a full count of ten before continuing.

Draco limped home that night, consumed by a kaleidoscope of emotions that overwhelmed him until he shut down.  Apathetic, he burst through the shop’s front door, not even caring to do it quietly.

Draco pushed himself to his feet to cloak the rush of disappointment.  “Yeah, well you fly like a bloody lunatic,” he said quickly, bitterly.  He prodded at the bruise on his lip where he’d bitten it.  It hurt, so he kept dabbing it.

that reduced the brewing period from eight months to six.  Merlin knows that was one of the only worthwhile advancements in the field of preestablished potions for close to a century.”
Draco thought that was kind of bullshit.
But still, he failed to eradicate his doubts.
But it was also because Harry was preoccupied – once again speaking with the younger boy, Sam.  “What were you saying?”
He wrapped his hand around Harry’s hips, pulling him back until he bottomed out.
“Kill me?” Harry guessed.  “Put me out of my misery?”
“Sit down!” Father commanded.  And, because Draco had exhausted himself with his tirade, he complied.
“It’s okay, Harry.  I’m not bitter about it – it makes perfect sense.”  He
Shoutout to my ongoing beta
Draco stood to the side and let the students flow out until it became a trickle, then stopped altogether.  Taking a deep breath, he knocked.
Draco felt himself melting a little at the oblivious mess of a person in front of him.  He cupped Harry’s face in his hand and said, “Of course not.  You were dating Ginny Weasley when we met again – why did you think this would come as a surprise?”  He found himself tracing Harry’s cheek up and down in strokes he hoped were somewhat comforting.  “Also, you’re making a lot of assumptions.
Really, Potter?”  He tried to rein in the hysteria in his voice, stalling by taking a swig of his drink.  “This ‘

[Another montage signals the passage of time, and they are now beginning to pull their trays out of the oven.  FRED announces the 2 minute mark with manipulative camera cuts that make it look like everyone is way further behind than they actually are.  HARRY scrapes some bubbling honey off the bottom of one of his trays and throws it back in the oven with desperate hopes that it will crispen.  DRACO’s hands waver as he drops bits of gold leaf over his fruit rugelach with tweezers.  CEDRIC smiles contentedly as he arranges flowers on the plate around his even batch of biscuits.]
Draco closed his eyes against the onslaught of that emotion, a weak groan bubbling up in his throat.  “

Potter was trying to drive him crazy – it was as simple as that.  And he wasn’t going to take that lying down.  Draco ripped the sheet from his wall and took off towards the pitch.
.  Only Potter was that dedicated to a prank.
His mother paused for a moment, then proceeded to set her cup and saucer on the coffee table before returning her hands, folded, to her lap.  She was suddenly very still.  “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about, Draco.”

“We have no way of knowing.  It could be less than a year, it could be as much as five or ten.  The only thing we know is that it’s affecting his magical core and strength, so the full extent of his lifespan is lost to him.”  For a wizard, that could be upwards of two hundred years, so the loss was significant – if not immediate.
The snake was suddenly encased in a large, protective bubble – and Draco felt his gut wrenching before he even could process
“Wonderful,” the woman deadpanned, sliding two capped thimbles of potion to them across the desk.  “Then, let us proceed.”  She waited until they’d both drunk to get started.  “Alrighty.  First: do you verify that you are indeed as you appear, defendants Narcissa Malfoy and Draco Lucius Malfoy, and that you have not ingested any identity-altering potions (including, but not limited to: polyjuice potion) or performed any identity-altering spells?”
Thoroughly panicked by that latest order, Draco found himself returning to the previous question.  “Erm, what would you like to know?  About my…situation, that is.  I wasn’t trying to withhold anything, I just… the past few years are a bit embarrassing to discuss.”
Harry was arguing that it could go

He finally met Harry’s eyes and found that they were wide and nearly as shocked and delicately hopeful as he felt.  “Wait, you’re not…kidding, are you?”  He

“Shall we?”
“Which brings me to another point,” he said, stepping forward into Potter’s space and smiling when the man’s back hit the wall.  “Why have you been acting
“Aren’t you going to offer tea?”
“Tomorrow’s the next party!” Ron exclaimed.
Then, in panic, his thoughts would slip to wartime or the stubborn set of Mother’s jaw when she announced Lucius was dying, and his sense of comfort muddled with confusion until the light sputtered out.  It couldn’t work – it wasn’t possible; there was no stable foundation for this happiness to build up from.
The man’s clothes were the same, but the rest of his appearance had grown visibly ragged during his time in Azkaban.  His hair was thinner, cheeks gaunter, bags carving deep canyons under his eyes.  Those grey eyes gleamed with accusations he dared not make until Draco’s position was a little less precarious – that was the same too, it seemed.  He still acted like a politician.
“Do tell me more,” Draco said, grinning at Harry’s expense.
“Draco…”  Harry rested a hand on his shoulder softly.  “Have you not learned how to cast a
“Potter?  What do you want?”  His earlier anger was tempered slightly by the shock of seeing the other man here, out of the blue.  “I didn’t know you knew where my office was.”
“So you’re…gay?”  And the look on Harry’s face was so forcedly casual that Draco nearly burst out laughing.

The rest of his miseries clamored to drag him down, but this time – on the Green Flash – he was fast enough to escape them.

Again, Potter was watching him.
“I heard an interesting rumor today.”  He flipped through the pages lazily, opening it to the section he had added.  It really had been an inspired prank idea – even if Potter hadn’t discovered it yet.  A veritable stroke of genius.  He hoped Potter would notice soon.

“I’m not saying,” Draco reiterated, more to keep himself steady than anything.
DRACO: [aside] I’ve done the best I can, and it all comes down to the bake.  If that’s not enough, then I don’t know what I could’ve done better.  [He pauses, then a frown overtakes his face.]  Well, maybe I could’ve chilled the dough a few more minutes.  I did 1 hour and 47 minutes, when I really wanted to do 2 full hours, but Potter had already taken his out, and I figured I’d need the extra 13 minutes at the end to plate them, which is probably more important that the slight texture difference would be… But now I don’t know.  I just don’t know.
His grey eyes gleamed in the dim lighting.  “Just here for a social outing, I’m afraid.  Why, you want to ‘rattle?’”
Jameson’s face soured, and it remained sour when he came pounding on the door with Grant after they’d all ascended into the pub.  Draco opened the door with a frown – but this time, he didn’t step aside to let them in.

Today was finally the day.  Draco was getting his wand back, and he could think of nothing else.
“Yes.”
Draco quashed the disappointment that threatened to spill out of him.
Instead of egging him on like Draco had hoped though, Potter seemed to jolt back to reality.  His eyes widened slightly, and he scrambled backwards quickly – breaking the implicit magnetism of their ever-closing distance.  While this time they held no fear, guilt shone brightly in those eyes.

“We’re fine, Mother.  The same as any other members of the staff.  Could we get the check, please?”
And now, Wednesday was meandering into Thursday, and Thursday was crawling – slow as treacle – into Friday.  Time was betraying him consistently and mercilessly, and by the time Saturday morning came, he felt battered by its cruel expansion.  And then, quite suddenly, there was none.
“Huh?  No, he’s not!  Well, not more than any other subject.”  Seeming to realize what she’d said, she brought a hand up to her mouth.  “I mean-”

Passersby slowed their gait and hushed, so better to take in the spectacle.  Draco cleared his throat with embarrassment, then started again in a whisper.

Draco immediately regretted his choice of words, when Harry glanced up with a self-satisfied smile.  “How

He raised an eyebrow and surveyed the class.  “Are we all good with that?  Doing another relay race?”  Most of the heads nodded – some furiously – but no one seemed bothered by the idea, so Draco relented.  “Very well.  But you’ll have to give me a few minutes to set up the stations.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, but it was more for effect than anything.  “You tell me.  Do you need me to keep tabs on you again?”
If he had fought so hard for

He’d no longer accept ignorance as an excuse.
“Scared, Potter?”
After leading them down the hall into the first available classroom, Draco spelled the door closed and sat Harry gently on a desk.  “Breathe, Harry.  Breathe.”  The man’s fingers remained entangled in his shirt, so he fell into a crouch beside him.  “Look at me.”

He stepped forward, earning a wry eyebrow-raise from his opponent—which quickly turned to a look of shock when Harry didn’t stop when he reached respectable hitting range.

He stepped into the closet behind Potter and shut the door with a muffling charm.  At this point, he knew better than to argue with the Golden Boy in earshot of teachers.
using him to get out of these responsibilities – but like any good Slytherin, he fell victim to flattery.  “I’m honored you think so, Sir.”
Potter had started in on his lecture about dueling now that he’d arrived, and he might’ve laughed at all the important historical details the man was skipping over if his eyes didn’t keep darting to Potter’s lips – and his hands too, as he gestured emphatically about something involving “seconds.”  It was fascinating really, watching him teach.  He didn’t think he’d ever heard the man talk so much at once before, given their typically terse exchanges.
Draco glanced up to see Harry burst into the common room, startling the Slytherins from their languid conversations.  There was a moment in which the man appeared startled himself, like he hadn’t expected anyone but Draco to be sitting there – which was an amusing thought in and of itself.
Every time he came here, Draco promised himself that he’d be strong – that
Harry wanted to tell him – he really did – but the sudden quiet from turning down the radio made him realize the way most of the conversations in the stands had hushed at his entrance.  And he noticed more than one pair of eyes trained on him now that he was just casually talking it up with

ridiculous.
It was a weak distraction, but Harry’s hands flew to Draco’s fly nonetheless.  Like he’d been waiting for exactly that permission.  He tore Draco’s pants down the second he’d gotten them open and took him to the root with one graceless gulp.
good, okay?” Harry retorted, voice rising with defiance.  “What, you want me to wax poetic about how the leather grips your arse?  Hell.”
“I didn’t,” he admitted.  “Hannah told me.”
The next time the peace was disturbed, however, it was by someone shouting his name.

“Mister Jenkins,” he purred, malice dancing undetectable beneath the address.  “How can we help you?”
just didn’t fact-check.”
As he geared up for the match on Saturday, Draco realized he was no longer nervous about refereeing.  After the first match, he’d come to see that people really weren’t focusing on him much at all (which, for once in his life, had been relieving rather than a point of contention).  Furthermore, his regular flying classes had gotten him used to the pitch again and flying with students instead of shady old men.  What he
“Like here,” he jabbed at the first month on the page, “‘
It was these thoughts that consumed him until hours later, when Harry finally stirred.  The man’s hair was messy – messier than usual – and he stretched like a cat before smiling up at him.
“Well, what?”  He bit his lip to keep from cackling at the idea of Harry reading it while Draco chatted on, unaware, at the party.  Perhaps he’d been playing sad music at the time, too.

“Without the sarcasm, but yes.  There’s got to be something equivalent in the Wizarding World.”
It was as if, in this sleep-induced haze, Harry had been able to strip away the complexity of it all, to cast aside the forces of hesitation that usually kept them at arm’s length.  With a simple, normal phrase, he’d erased the distance and made
And Potter?  Maybe the Mark would remind him of what he was getting into.  In a rare fit of clarity, Draco realized that the kindest thing he could do for Potter was to scare him away entirely.
Draco’s breath rushed out of him in a sigh.  He supposed he was past the point at which he could lie and pretend to be okay.  “Not great.”
The words trickled through his ears, taking a moment to understand.  Then, his head snapped up to look.
Harry tugged him back the other way, before he could continue his complaint, and Malfoy spun messily back to face him.  The man’s face was red—likely from rage—and Harry laughed to see his nemesis in such disarray over a battle tactic he himself had chosen.
“-and…and I hadn’t seen you in your gear before-”
He was holding most of Harry’s weight now – the man was nearly

Instead of snapping back, however, Harry simply parked his quill in his inkwell and sat back to offer his full attention.  It made Draco feel even more insufficient and small.

They hit the ground in a messy pile, and the impact was enough that Draco felt nothing for the first few seconds, followed by a rush of feeling
But at least with Grant he could tell it came from a place of commiseration – a self-martyrized call of “the world isn’t fair to those who stray outside the lines.”  With Grant’s

Harry tensed.  “I, um, don’t see the point in rushing these decisions…unless, of course, you wanted to – which would be fine.  Or
“You’re only ‘Professor’ in front of the class, Potter,” he muttered, fantasizing vaguely about calling him “professor” in an entirely different setting.  If Potter would like that.
It was a ridiculous request, and that was reflected plainly in Harry’s eyes.  “What – here?”
,” Father drawled from across the table.  “And, of the two of us, I’m not the one who can’t be helped.”
Potter’s scowl twisted with defiance, and he scrubbed at a cut on his cheek.  “Oh shut up, Malfoy.  You’re just scared you’ll hit a tree and damage your pretty face.”
Laughing, Draco helped him spell them clean.
Harry followed, feeling vaguely sick.
The weight on his chest lightened immeasurably.  “Thank you, Headmistress.”  In her capable hands, Potter would be knocked to his senses.  “It means a lot to me.”
that precedes it.”
Hope y'all are doing well.  Also, WOW, I've passed 100k in this sequel now... and I have a fair bit left still.  How the holy hell did that happen.
It just wasn’t that easy to let go.  On the fourth day since their nocturnal argument, Draco decided to go see Potter in his office.  He’d grown weary of interrogating himself, and he’d be damned if he let the man slip away on some terrible misunderstanding.  So, after dinner, he hoofed it up to Gryffindor tower before he could psyche himself out.

Caught, Harry remained staring down at their mostly-cleared plates.  He was pink to his ear-tips, which was what prompted Draco to lean across the table and whisper and toy with him some more.
A flash of pain in his side.  Fingers skimming his face.  Draco’s eyes flew open to unfamiliar surroundings, experiencing one long moment of blissful confusion before he remembered.
He frowned.  “Well, unfortunately, I have no clue.  I hadn’t even heard.”
Even in the relative darkness, he could make out Potter’s blush.  When the man refused to comment further, he sighed and let it go.  He wouldn’t push.

to him – that much, at least, he could say with certainty.  He still got jeered at and singled out on the pitch and sometimes spit at in the stands, but that was par for the course.  The rapid decline into hostility that Grant had warned about, however, had yet to come to fruition, and Draco – like any good paranoiac – was losing sleep and what remained of his sanity fretting over it.
“Hey Malfoy, do you like going to farmer’s mark-”
Mother, for her part, did not look away from his panic.  “He is still feeling the effects of Dark spells that he cast and ones cast on him.  That much has been the case for a long time, though his time in Azkaban only aggravated it.  He, of course, kept this hidden from you – despite my urgings – out of pride.”

Despite his current leave of his senses, Draco was no idiot.  He knew he was pushing the man too far – Morpheus’ face was mottled nearly purple with fury.  And the man had a wand, when he did not.
Draco turned at the call and saw Kat standing there, locks fashioned into snakes that undulated gently in greeting.  Her makeup was ghastly – green and decaying around blazing red eyes that had been spelled for effect.  Beside her, Marla had her hair pinned up and was sporting a Grecian warrior costume that he could only assume was for Perseus.

Draco let his eyes flutter shut for a moment in bliss – that he’d finally reached this moment.  This moment he’d self-sabotaged and fantasized about for most of his life.  He opened his eyes and considered Harry, to make sure it was real.  “Do you want me to be?”
“Fine,” Harry pulled back with a sigh, releasing Draco at last.  “You’re right.”

Harry swallowed, a shaky jump of his Adam’s apple that Draco tracked with avid interest.  Harry forced out one more sentence: “I’d like you to punish me for it.”
What if Grant was right?  He needed an ally in these games – whether he wanted to fuck them or not.  To Ludo, he was an investment, but to the others?  He was a fancy jewel: one to be collected for status or smashed.  And after his recent arrogance, he could only foresee the latter.

Fenn smiled, allowing the light to glint dangerously off her lip ring.

“Which means?” Harry pressed.

Draco felt the smirk curling across his face and hoped he didn’t look too smug for Harry to forgive him.
“Oh, my little Gemini,” she’d cooed, “there’s no wonder why you’re good at that one.”  As a Black, she’d always been fascinated by star lore.  It was one of the things she’d hidden most fiercely from Father – who thought that such pastimes were “trivial” and “common.”  But it hadn’t stopped her from imparting them on Draco from a young age.
“You alright?” he asked softly.
– that’s why I just came down your throat.”  He caught Harry’s chin in his hand and made sure the man was looking at him when he asserted, “It felt amazing.”
He must’ve pinkened like a sow, because Harry’s next move was to call him over with a little smile quirking his lip.  He patted his lap, and after a beat Draco realized what he was trying to get him to do.

He tried his best not to stamp his foot like a child.  “You.  Bought.  A.  Shirt.  That’s.  Hideous.”  His fingers dug into Harry’s shoulders; if they weren’t still in the middle of the Parisian street, they would undoubtedly be around his
He craved Potter’s attention more than he craved sunlight or a comfortable bed – it was an indulgence he often forbid himself from seeking, even in fantasy, under the cadaverous light of that back room.  But on days he was feeling particularly hopeless, he let himself slip into the fruitless vice.  The pain of coming down from such reveries was always acute enough to prevent its quick recurrence.
He took a swig of butterbeer.  “I ended up leaving after about nine months and found a job.”  His mind slithered over Morpheus’, refusing to linger, and landed on his equally terrible prospects at the Quidditch ring job.  “Several, actually.”
“Must be impressive, to shut your sassy mouth,” he quipped, tugging Harry in by the hair so that his cock rested against his lips.  Harry’s mouth softened into a groan, letting it slip past his teeth with a hum.  He sunk onto it, his hands pulling Draco’s hips closer, which, in turn, kept forcing Draco’s cock deeper.

“Looks a bit sickly to me.”  She scooted the notebook closer with her wand, eyes never leaving the pot.  “Add the horsehair?”
He stewed on the events of the day, not even realizing he’d gotten lost in his thoughts until he felt Harry take his hand gently in his and begin to rub circles against his skin.  “How long do you think he has, then?”

HARRY: [crouched in front of his oven, nose pressed almost to the glass] And now we wait.

He’d promised himself he wouldn’t bring up Potter this time.

Then, mind caught as it was in memories of their first duel, his eyes met Potter’s, a spell rushing to his lips – “

Potter seemed to have no such compunction.  “
But he had told Draco he was going.  And Potter didn’t lie – it was one of those things that made him as stupid as he was charming.  So he was bound to be there.
and from that moment forward, he’d serve to drive him insane.
“Satisfied…with our…rematch?” he huffed.
“Oof,” he grunted, struggling to find his footing (and the natural rhythm of his heart), before Harry could catch him off guard again.  Remembering himself, the man pulled off a moment later – but instead of letting go, tightened his fist around Draco’s tunic and dragged him the distance to the backside of the locker room.
His thoughts were still lost in a swirl of Harry’s intentions.  Perhaps, like a complicated arithmancy problem, he could solve it with enough dogged effort.
“Absolutely not,” Draco replied immediately.  Harry glared.  “Not without my help, that is.  Lucky for you, you’re dating the best event planner this side of Wizarding Europe.”
With a groan, he let his head fall back onto the sweat-soaked sheets.  He’d been having the same nightmare now for weeks.  Time after time, and it was always the same.
In the aftermath, Draco rested his wand tip gently against Jameson’s forehead.  Softly.  The man blinked dazedly up at him from the ground.  In his calmest, quietest voice, Draco said, “I’m asking you again to leave.”
There was an edge to her voice that suggested both pride and belated chastisement.
Draco smiled, slow and vicious.  “So you understand, then, why you need to be punished?”
It didn’t make sense.
Harry wavered.  “I mean…you saw the article, right?”
But instead of laughing, Draco found the sum total of his energies devoted to

His thumb stilled against Draco’s fang, and he realized that Harry had wiped a drop of blood from the unnoticed puncture there.  But he hadn’t drawn away.  And now his gaze was lifting from Draco’s lips to his eyes, and the intensity of it was captivating.
“No problem,” Draco replied automatically, voice strangled and unfamiliar to his ears.  Only as Potter turned to descend did it strike him that he’d actually been expecting a
It was cringey and cliché and adorable, and Draco wanted to break character for a minute to squeeze him in a tight hug.  He didn’t – but Merlin, he was tempted.

Draco watched his muscles work, clenching and relaxing his cheeks in waves of soreness.  Before the final blow, Harry surprised him by sticking his arse out a fraction in anticipation.
“And are you testifying against or in defense of the accused?”
“I’ll kiss you,” Harry offered quietly.

He entered the Manor with a trepidation befitting a prisoner walking to the gallows.  Roddy appeared within instants, taking his coat and grumbling that “Master Draco was ten minutes late!” when it had really only been eight a half – and only that much to annoy his father.

It was only after the man had whirled to walk away that Draco realized the depth of his mistake.  The words had felt so final, and their icy cadence terrified him.  “Potter, wait!” he yelled, but within another second, the hallway was empty once again.
“What does it say?” Harry whispered, his voice breathy in the sudden silence.
“Alright.”
“I’m planning Slytherin’s decorating contest that will be judged the night of the Ball.  The older students somehow convinced the first-years that it’s in everyone’s best interest to do a ‘house of horror’ in the dungeons.”
MINERVA: Good crunch though.  The rolls are a bit messy, but good overall.  Let’s look at the last one.

Harry sank into the seat next to him.  Draco could almost feel the bafflement radiating off of him, which coalesced into a sad attempt at conversation when the silence became unbearable.
something had happened between them.  And Draco wished desperately to understand what.
“Did you mean it?” Harry demanded as soon as Sam had gone.
“Three more,” he murmured, to ground himself more than remind Harry.  “Can you handle that, Potter?”
“Have you heard, Mister Malfoy?  We’re resurrecting it!  It went dormant for years, after all, since they couldn’t garner enough interest.  But that doesn’t seem to be a problem
Finally, Harry got around to the point at hand – asking Sam about his crush.  The boy folded and confessed, describing his more-than-friendly feelings for a classmate he’d been hanging out with.  When asked if he’d told him yet, though, Sam’s reply was immediate:
for extra assurance.  Then, she’d simply positioned Harry along the specific wall in the courtyard where Malfoy would be sure to see him as he finished Arithmancy for the day.  And sitting “bisexually,” too – whatever that meant.
“Or your long, slender legs,” Harry added, looking distinctly mortified.

His heart soared with hope.  “
VOLDEMORT: Be quick.
“Glad to be here,” Draco lied.  “So, where’s the pitch?”
He opened his mouth with an excuse that Draco found he’d rather not hear.  Not now, not this time – after coming so close.
He cast drying and warming charms over the man’s skin, transfixed by the sight of Harry haloed in steam.  His eyes caught on Harry’s, which were tracking him, dark and hungry.
When Malfoy turned, he still had that amused grin playing about his face.  “I’m surprised at the past tense, Potter.  Aren’t I still?”
But Potter was already shaking his head.  “I said no.”
The second they were out of earshot, Hermione pulled him in by the arm.  “Okay, if not here,
“You as well, Harry.  In a ‘charming urchin’ kind of way,” he quipped. It was far too early in the date to be getting
for such presumptuous fantasies.
Malfoy led him on in a series of flashier and more complicated steps, and Harry realized that he’d been foolish to view dancing as inherently opposite of fighting.  They were fighting still—just in new and unexplored ways.
Harry could feel his face heating up, and he looked desperately to his friends for guidance.  Ginny was watching avidly, like this was a semifinals Quidditch game, and Luna looked equally invested beside her.  Ron, on the other hand, was rolling his eyes and groaning something like “please no, Harry; you definitely don’t have to,” while Hermione scanned Harry’s face with concern before raising her eyebrows at whatever she found and visibly relaxing.
When they’d both stopped pumping and twitching, Draco pulled out, leaving fluids trailing down Harry’s thigh.  He stumbled over to his chair, buttoning his trousers messily as he went – for once, not arsed with getting it right.  “Well,” he said, when he’d caught his breath enough to ask, “was it everything you fantasized?”
, now was it?  “I had every right,” he replied.  “I warned you Potter – I said you’d regret it when you messed with my office hours.”
Harry’s hands were gripping his hips now, and Draco let out a hiss before managing, “Careful Potter, that’s worth more than you.”  An obvious lie – but no one could claim that Draco wasn’t playing his part perfectly.

He stood slowly, somehow limber despite the prolonged time spent on his knees – Harry still rather thought his own would give out.  The look Draco was giving him wasn’t helping.
“Not yet, Potter,” Draco hissed as he hauled Harry back onto his cock by the hair.  Harry’s back curved like a bow, and as soon as Draco was fully seated in him, he could feel Harry spasm.  His muscles clenched in tandem, each one stretching and tightening in a constellation of strength and beauty that Draco could watch for all his days.

She appeared at the designated time with burrs tangled in her hair and green eyes wide from having apparently just undergone an ordeal.  “Professor?  You wanted to see me?”
“Seeker, my boy!  The next game starts momentarily.”  He gave him a friendly shove that sent him a few steps onto the “pitch.”  Draco spun in a circle, trying to make sense of the directive under the upswelling cataclysm of noise.  The world didn’t feel real.

Draco deflected.  He tried not to be impressed with that level of wordless magic.
It was the mysterious looks and mixed signals – in short, the obfuscated clarity – that drove Draco crazy.  They allowed his hopes to swell, loud and buzzing in his chest until he almost combusted.
He half-considered saying something pretentious like a five-star restaurant in France, but he was so past that phase of his life, he could no longer even pretend.  “Well, you can never go wrong with Madam Puddifoot’s,” he joked.  Really, he was testing the waters of Harry’s willingness to be seen with him in Hogsmeade.

“Merlin, no!  What if he hates me after?”

Immediately, he switched to the offensive.

“Er, did I say that I was going to clean up the juice?” he replied with a hysterical sounding laugh.  “I meant ‘go to Madam Pomfrey’s.’  Really feeling off sorts this morning.”
His train of thought trailed away into memory fragments: a snippet of his parents dancing at a party, her rolling her eyes at his dramatics over a cozy autumn dinner.  A scene of them all huddled in the gazebo to see the Christmas lights over Wiltshire flare on.
“You were,” Harry assured, making a breathy noise as Draco nipped at his ear.  “You’re always up to something.”
“You’re a dirty bastard, so it’s going to take some effort to get you clean.”

It was infuriating.  Made more so, even, because Draco was unwilling to divulge his actual feelings in front of his father.  Thus, it became an impasse.
Harry held his gaze until Draco couldn’t meet it any longer, and let his head fall back with a strangled-sounding laugh.  “Oh, Harry,” he said at last.  “That’s an unfair question.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed at the seemingly-innocent question.  “Yes.  And you Hufflepuffs better not go stealing our ideas.  Not that I think you

“Just a bit more, I think.  Then, it should turn a healthy lavender and emit clockwise steam wisps, if my predictions are correct.”
“Come on,” Harry urged, fingers following the trouser seam to his inner thigh.

one to have Harry like this – to touch him readily, like he had permission.  To lead him stridently onto a path which he would trust.
Harry sighed, running a hand through his tangled hair before giving up and looking to the ceiling.  “Draco…I know you care-”
“I thought you weren’t allowed to curse,” Harry murmured dreamily, snapping Draco from his mission.
Draco scrambled for Harry’s zipper just as Harry began fumbling with his.  His knuckles bumped against Harry’s as they yanked and unclasped, and they wrenched down their trousers with flies still partially undone.  As soon as their cocks sprang free, Draco wrapped a hand around the jostling erections, stretching his fingers to grip them both in one fist.

it, Harry was clearly also nervous about more than just the beginning of their first date.  They were about to step out into the Wizarding world – together, officially, for the first time.
Harry was fine.  He was totally normal and not at all uncomfortable in what he was wearing – it might even look
Draco stifled a wave of initial disappointment, but then refocused on the feeling of Harry hardening even further beneath his hand.

“Not literally,” Slughorn rushed to add at the expression on his face.  “No – certainly not!  I would never accuse…
So yes, he might have started this with his initial approach, but the subsequent argument was entirely on Potter’s shoulders.  He had been rising so well to Draco’s bait until-…well, until – just like

“How would it work anyway?”

“Better than what?” came the cutting reply.
He startled as Harry yanked his arm forward and revealed the Mark under his sleeve.  “Your Mark, I forgive you for, because it wasn’t a choice.  Voldemort would have killed you like he killed so many others.”  He met Draco’s eyes, solemn.  “I forgive you for Dumbledore, because you couldn’t go through with it.”
He only understood fully when their lips collided and remained.
The desperation with which he said it, cleared Draco’s head of the darker thoughts.  Harry
He must’ve looked pitiful, because Malfoy didn’t wait for his floundering before he continued.  “Alright,

if they skipped all that hesitant-dating bit and went straight for cohabitation.
Harry dunked a Mice Pop into the red marshmallow goo, while Draco unwrapped a chocolate skeleton with precision before dipping.  Everyone knew that Bat’s Blood left a particularly sticky residue if it got on you, and yet all his meticulousness was for naught; he got distracted watching Harry take an overenthusiastic bite and felt the telltale trickle of syrup dribbling down his hand.

He would keep his mouth shut and his head down, if that’s what they wanted.  He had gotten used to that.  He would simply do his job to the best of his ability and pray that no one got him fired for his Dark Mark.
The first few licks were messy in a way that drove Draco dangerously close the edge.  It was clear that Harry had never done this before, and the thought that

The waiting was no good.  It made him deadpan and overanxious in turns, and his last performance had left him most unsatisfied – he’d started off too eager, as it were, having been delighted at the sight of a person, and that had altered the course of the whole event).
It was like the universe had conspired to obliterate his self-control through unrelenting proximity.

It didn’t bring any relief though; in fact, the resulting effect was the opposite.  Draco felt a noxious sense of dread pooling in his stomach as he realized he was walking into a trap.  This wasn’t some one-off where they’d beat him up in the alley; this had been

But he remained resolutely quiet as he floated a stunned bat to the bottom of the wardrobe.  He’d run into it yesterday on a nighttime walk around the grounds and had decided that it would be a suitably festive prank to play at the dawning of October.
HARRY: I’m planning to make some trees out of sugar work as well.  But yes, it’s supposed to be rather simple, so the focus remains on the important part – me with my family.
But Potter’s response broke him from his swirling thoughts.  “What?  No – I just know you’re good at dueling.”
The answer was
Words were getting easier for Draco now.  “Hey, Potter – my students told me an interesting rumor.”  He looked Potter up and down, letting his gaze slide fluidly down that delectable form.  “They said you copied my costume.”
He stormed into the drawing room and felt the slightest jolt of satisfaction when shock flickered across his father’s face at the entrance.  “Mother.  Father.”  He nodded at each in succession.
He would tell Harry someday, he decided.  Perhaps the day he could summon a

Draco couldn’t resist a little cheek.  “See you,
He ripped down the banner, but it did not free him of the snake’s hungry glare.
“And is there any particular reason you couldn’t say something to Harry himself?” she asked, though her expression had softened into concern.
He didn’t look away, and so, neither could Draco.  After a few moments, the tension was unbearable, and Bagman burst in with, “It’s really not so dramatic as all that, Grant!  No need to scare the boy on his first day.  It’s only protocol, to keep things
“Very well,” Draco breathed, preparing himself mentally for the task.  He’d certainly fantasized about it enough, especially after particularly grueling matches.  He wanted to make it good – good enough that Harry would let him do it again.
“Yes, and?” he really
Draco returned to the castle, pondering that statement even as he whooshed out of the Floo.  His mind was almost immediately redirected, however, by Harry’s loud refrain of “Ron wants me to be best man!”
The man was sprawled lazily in his chair, and though Draco couldn’t see his face clearly, he knew it bore a smile.
He laughed, running a hand down Harry’s hip with languor.  “Was I?”
Kat skidded through the door after Marla, eyes sparkling with the news of their discovery.  “They trapped one in the seventh floor corridor!  All the creepies hang around there.”  She sounded so excited when she said it, too, and Draco tried to hide his instinctive frown at hearing the location.
When, at last, Harry awoke, Draco had gone through a lifetime’s worth of grief, anger, disappointment, and disillusionment.  His boyfriend’s consciousness was a welcome distraction.
He’d rather have Potter slicing him open with Dark magic than ignoring him.
After a short pause, Harry began to nod.  “Right.  I mean, I didn’t think you’d have volunteered or anything.  But yeah, that sucks.”
Then everything was dark, and Draco couldn’t see anything at all.
Only once he was gone did Draco finally break into a grin.  If there was something no one had the strength to ignore, it was Peeves’ cruel song parodies.

“You can’t distract me.”

that he’d done that before.
HARRY: Oh my god – I’m so sorry!
“Are you…are you reading my mind?” Harry asked, wide-eyed.

– Potter was
gay.  It was a far cry from gay
Skating his fingers over another fractured rib, Draco tamped down a sob of limitless frustration.
But apparently not to Harry, because his brow was doing that cute little furrowing thing, and he looked quite surprised as he articulated a “huh” and then, “I wish I had known that before I tried it for two years.”
Draco laughed humorlessly.  Had he just left straight after the war – packed his bags the day of the battle and disappeared – perhaps he would’ve turned out less a failure than he had.  But that was the thing about hypotheticals: they drove you crazy with envy and ultimately changed nothing.
Harry chose this moment to pull back and smile, lazy and smug as he asked, “Are you sure you want me to leave?”
Harry’s throat worked as he worked himself up to whatever he was going to say.  “W-well…first I thought of you…sucking my dick.  So suddenly like that…and how it felt so-” he trailed off in embarrassment.
CEDRIC: [confessional aside] Of course I’m excited!  Getting first in the technical is nothing to sneeze at.

My fellow bakers are equally talented – they just had a bit of a rough day.
Then, the world exploded into sound as a bludger crunched into his shoulder from behind.  He pushed up from the ground, blinking determinedly as his eyelids caught with something tacky.  Through the whirlwind of bats and fists descending upon him, he zeroed in on one distant figure sitting as a spectator in the stands.

towards Potter was based in something other than hatred and mistrust.  Something else entirely.  But Potter seemed to have gone through no such transformation.
Harry took a moment to catch his breath.  “For spending two hundred galleons on a pair of shoes,” he finally managed.
His smirk dropped, but she didn’t seem truly annoyed, so he let himself relax a fraction.  “Yes.”
With effort, he extracted himself from Roddy’s grip and walked, even-paced, down the hall.  He refused to be escorted around what had once been his own home.  He had moved past the boy who hesitated on the doorstep, unsure of whether or not he should knock – now, if they called him here, they should bloody well be ready when he came.
She pleaded that things could go back to normal.  He told her “normal” didn’t exist for people like them.  Not now, not anymore.
“Something like that,” the man said, letting loose a malicious chuckle.  “So go ahead and turn in your wand.”

"Come on, snake—let’s rattle.”  Malfoy stepped into Harry’s personal space with the singular confidence of someone issuing a challenge they knew they would win.  His lips were quirked into that infuriating grin of his, the one he leveled at Harry whenever he botched a drill in training; the one that made him want to punch Malfoy in the face.  Which he should have been doing now, except…

McGonagall’s lip twitched in amusement, too, and it comforted Draco that she found Harry’s antics humorous rather than distasteful.  But she schooled her expression quickly and responded with a perfectly neutral face.  “I’m afraid we have a fair amount to discuss regarding safety measures and getting the pitch in order.  It’s probably best if you reconvened to address

Harry scrabbled for Draco’s shoulders, looking for something to hold onto.  His head rose from the pillow in supplication before it fell with a soft
With a sharp tug, Malfoy pulled him in close.  Unprepared for the sudden movement, Harry didn’t even have a chance to steady himself before he was splayed messily against Malfoy’s chest.  The man paused to eye him consideringly.
“I don’t have
But, unable to handle the silence, Harry went on to add, incomprehensibly: “I’m sorry if I’ve caused problems with your family.”

Marla glanced up at him, wide-eyed.  “No!  I mean, maybe?  I don’t know.  I just…I want to be different than the way I am now.  I don’t know about the rest, though.”
Harry drew in a sharp breath that made Draco realize what he’d just said.  About

, which was still – as he’d mentioned already –
“Potter,” he started, causing the man’s gaze to snap up suddenly to meet his.  His eyes were wide and hurt and green.
He saw multiple zombies, a few fake dementors, Veela-inspired costumes with vast, transfigured wings – even a first-year girl dressed up like Ginevra Weasley, complete with her Holyhead Harpies uniform.  That one irked him a little, as a twinge of jealousy surged through him at the name.
“And Professor Potter – of all people – was the one to re-spark interest!”  Draco’s eyebrow might’ve twitched.  “I suppose it stands to reason, since his duel is undoubtedly the most famous of our era – but still,” Flitwick paused, face struggling between pride and envy, “it’s a shame that it took something like
on the door after he latched it, and all the secrecy of it forced another inappropriate bubble of laughter from Draco’s throat.
“Just ‘really good?’  Use your words, Harry.”
What brings you to Hogsmeade today, my boy?”
With a frown, Harry started the lesson.
SEVERUS: Cedric.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, letting his fantasies run wild against the inside of his eyelids. He took a deep breath and looked at Draco. “Well, for example, you see that pudding cup over there?” His heart began to race as he walked over to the chocolate pudding and picked it up. He took out the spoon and licked it clean, letting out the quietest moan. The moan was like the volume a mouse would moan at if they were capable of making a human-like moan, so Draco didn’t really notice it.
Draco felt his vision squeeze down to a single speck, located somewhere between her set chin and empathetic eyes.  His mind reeled.  Father…
His head snapped up to look in the mirror.  He hadn’t been expecting anyone, seeing as this was the staff bathroom for the players to use – entirely separate from the one for the pub’s customers.

Harry’s eyes gleamed.  With agonizing slowness, he slid his hand up Draco’s thigh until he was finally cupping him above the fabric.  He squeezed experimentally at the bulge beneath his palm, and Draco could only hiss softly in pleasure as Harry documented his expression with unblinking eyes.
Literally, he had just asked that.  After confessing to his own feelings of aimlessness, no less.  It was obvious that the two of them were
The man sucked in a breath and held it, green eyes roaming over his face with a new brand of hunger.  Draco shivered under the gaze, hardly believing it was happening, but willing himself to wait – though it was torture.  He imagined his hands were nailed to the ground so as not to weave them through Potter’s hair and make the first move.
can help.”  He looked up at Draco with such resolute, hope-filled eyes that it made him wither with guilt for causing him distress.
Suddenly there is another set of hands entering the frame.  They grip the sliding pieces, and – together with DRACO’s – manage to stabilize the fragile confection.  The camera zooms out, and we see HARRY – huffing like he’d just sprinted over, and cheeks flushed and rosy to match.  His eyes are glued determinedly on the cathedral, where they remain when he asks:]
She took her morning tea in the parlor.  He took his in his room.
“I’m not always glaring!  Only like…
The common room fell into easy chatter, younger students clamoring to confess their drama to Draco and eager to impress him with their stories.  It passed the time nicely, so he found himself almost feeling bad as his mind drifted back to earlier this evening, when Harry had met him after the match.
He crumpled the pages in his hand and forced himself to breathe.
Students hushed as they saw him enter, but he couldn’t tell if it was because of his presence or the furious expression he couldn’t seem to wipe off his face when his eyes landed on Potter.  Potter, who looked disheveled and tired as usual, but not debilitatingly ill.  Not wasting away from some legitimate misfortune.  He looked rather normal, truth be told – if a little weary – and that set Draco grinding his teeth.
“Merlin,” he said – sounding just as awed and wonderstruck as he felt – “I’ve just jacked off

Potter was beet-red and sputtering, and it was a glorious sight.  It sent a thrill through him and also answered a question Draco hadn’t even dared ask himself, despite all the stalking and staring he had endured: Was Potter

In answer, Harry leaned forward to catch his attention.  “Can I touch you yet?” he asked.  His messy hair fell in unruly curls across his forehead, and Draco forced himself to be present.
“Hmm.”  Her mouth quirked downwards in a little frown, and her eyes fell to her papers again, which sent Draco into a panic.

Which was exactly what his father was relying on.  The more diminutive Draco felt, the better chance Lucius had of crushing him.  “Denial – another small rebellion among larger travesties.  I’m warning you, Draco: if you continue to defy me like this, there will be consequences.  You can go on deluding yourself, but you can never delude
Harry blushed, and cried, “I was under duress!”
It was a fruitless endeavor, a pipe dream – for he knew he could not unsee the blood as it soaked into the wood.  Something had changed in him that moment – a realization of a most unsettling parallel – as he saw their heirloom furniture drink in every greedy drop.
He cleared his throat and spelled the door all the way shut.
[At this point, HARRY has most of his gingerbread Weasleys in position across his winter landscape, complete with fiery icing hair and each of their distinctive fashions.  CEDRIC’s is nearly finished as well, and he spends his remaining time icing snow onto his multi-tiered ginger pine trees.  DRACO, however, is nowhere near finished and cements his gingerbread cathedral together at a dizzying pace.  His stress is almost palpable, and we see HARRY glancing back at him at frequent intervals, seeming almost like he’s hesitating to speak.]
The longer he dwelled on it, the more he doubted.
“You look bloody ridiculous,” Draco couldn’t help but shouting down to him.  Potter left himself too open to insults to resist.  “I knew you were a twit, but I never realized you were thick-headed enough to bulldoze a forest with your face.”

But even without looking, he could feel that he was hard – harder than he had any right to be while thinking of a colleague and boyhood rival.  He bit his lip, weighing his options.
She gave him a lopsided grin.  “Why would I mind?
The elf regarded him with narrowed eyes for a long moment, finally murmuring something about “having heard of Mister Potter’s affinity for snakes, yes,” but also of “sneaky Slytherins would ought to stay out of the Kitchens in the future.”

, that it was hard to do anything but bask in that kind of attention.  “Harry.  Hello.”
Harry’s petulance softened, and he leaned in for another quick kiss before drawing away with a sigh.  “Fine.  Go on!  Talk to your parents.”  He met Draco’s eyes.  “But I better see you at dinner.”
And yet.  Here was Potter’s naked torso in front of him – he tried to keep his eyes on the man’s face, he

McGonagall had not looked pleased.
“So – what?” Harry growled.  “You kiss me once, and then you’re going to leave me here pining after you?  Like I’ve been doing for weeks?”
Nothing.
He wished things between them could be simple again – just tea and murmured horoscopes and carefree walks on windless afternoons.  They would never be that way again, he knew, and acknowledging that fact was harder than postponing the confrontation indefinitely.

But Potter was cold to his attempt.  “No,” he said one final time, shoving Draco back so he could shut the door.
He headed to the pitch for a quick fly before dinner.
t/w: more flashbacks to consensual yet uncomfortable sex (not with Harry) and some unnegotiated pain-play in the first section; (later), blowjobs and handjobs in the "present"
Harry leveled him a look that told him he was being ridiculous – something he was already well aware of – and he quieted.  “I was going to say, ‘I know that you care, even though you feel you shouldn’t.’  You don’t have to forgive him – just go and talk at least.  Otherwise, you’ll regret it.”  He paused, fidgeting with his quill, like he still wasn’t comfortable giving advice.  “Also, we don’t have a lot of information.  Your mom could’ve been leaving out details – maybe it’s not as bad as it seems.  I don’t know.  But you owe it to yourself to find out.”

It tore through the air like a stinging hex, and, in less than a second, he had to swerve the handle away to avoid colliding with the ceiling.  He pulled to an unceremonious stop.

In the background, he heard Potter belatedly rushing to strip off his clothes, and – just as he pictured – when he turned, he saw the man’s back turned to him in a precious self-consciousness.  Merlin, the smooth, brown lines of his shoulders and waist just begged for Draco to run his hands down them.
Potter didn’t visit him the next day or, even, the following.  In fact, the most Draco heard as a result of his prank was a flustered McGonagall racing down the hall that afternoon, muttering “Bats!  Who in their
“Potter, wait!”  He reached out a hand to grasp his robe, but the man had already moved out of range.
As footsteps crashed loudly behind him, however, he realized her look had been warning of something else entirely.  Draco set down his drink and hardened his jaw.

No one had been any
“-unable to argue, for once-”
But he found Harry smiling at him in amusement, face still flushed and sweaty as he asked, “Was it everything you dreamed of in Potions?” to which Draco could only laugh weakly into his neck.
It didn’t help matters that they were constantly around each other nowadays – when Draco wasn’t teaching, he was up in Harry’s office, and when Harry

“How-”  He choked on the word.  “How bad?”
This line of questioning made him uncomfortable, which he’d learned usually made it something worth revisiting.  It was part of his self-made mission of change, and he’d have to give himself the opportunity to parse it out when he could.

Potter took off like a shot, and it took all of Draco’s skill to maneuver up next to him, despite their similar speed.  The man threw an elbow, and he elbowed back – but both refused to give up the narrow line of the most direct path towards their goal.
Harry dug his nails into Draco’s shoulders an instant before coming.  He made a choking noise as the orgasm tore through him, sending him clamping down hard on Draco’s imbedded cock.  His back arched, and Draco used that opportunity to press in again to the hilt, allowing that sweet torture to push him over the edge, too.

The weight on his lungs shifted suddenly, and – freed of it - he found he could push himself into a sitting position, and his hand flew to his head to rub at a particularly sore spot.  Finally, he managed to crack open his eyes.
Draco turned, hiding his wariness behind a quip.  “Back to ‘Malfoy,’ am I?”
“You know.  The comment Sam made?”
“We have a lot to redeem our House for,” she mused, eyes still trained on the dancing coals.

He saw Potter’s eyes glow, and then he was swooping down right in front of him, forcing Draco to halt his stampede if he didn’t want to get clipped.  He staggered a bit to avoid him, yet managed to stay upright, and was willing to let it go until Potter had the audacity to smirk at him ghoulishly.  Like a bloody

Even as the old fantasies flowed back into his brain, so too did the darker desires.  The ancient, confused ones – ones that toed the line between pleasurable pain and vindictiveness; how, in some, he’d once wanted to hurt Harry for real.
Harry didn’t mind if he touched him in such a casually intimate way, here in the Great Hall?  Swallowing surreptitiously, he plucked the lint from Harry’s shoulder.
Not to mention the amount of grinning and gazing that happened tonight over dinner.  It’s evident that something is going on.”

He grinned and ruffled her hair – which was still tangled with burrs – before watching her set off down the hall.  For once, he had no doubts he had done the right thing.  His heart felt overfull and tender, and, for an instant, he forgot he’d been thinking of this place as another prison.  In fact, in that moment – it felt like exactly where he needed to be.
In order for the house elves to find him, though, he had to use his real name – so he had no illusions that the food went untampered with.  Some days, his soup tasted more like a bowl of spit than “potato leek” – or whatever they were advertising – and, poor as he was, he just had to eat and bear it.
He cupped Harry’s other cheek and squeezed, watching his whole body squirm at the sensation.  The intensity of it all was confusing him – he was past all those feelings, wasn’t he?  In agreed-upon scenarios like this, was it okay to think thoughts like that?  As long as he drew the line between fantasy and reality?

He turned.  “Yes, Headmistress?”  He only prayed that, if she was going to dismiss him, she wouldn’t do so in front of Harry.  He didn’t think he could bear that indignity.

But Potter started speaking again instead.  “Merlin, I was such an idiot to think that you’d have changed.  You’re still the same evil, selfish prat you were back in school! You-”
Harry set his jaw and pushed his way into Potions class.  A collective gasp went through the students already in the classroom – and a very startled Slughorn, who was now desperately trying to fish out the dragonfly wing he’d dropped into his cauldron in shock.
And then there was that last word:
He supposed he should look away – brush him off, break the silence.  Something to distract from the longing in his gaze.  But, in this moment, he couldn’t bring himself to care about that either.  He looked and looked his fill.
“Did I wake you?” he asked, taking in the rumpled state of Draco’s bed.
HARRY: Err…not really.  I just… [he trails off, mind clearly not on the conversation] If I’m honest, I’d really rather not talk about this right now.
What had happened to that raw, savage magnetism that drew them together again and again?  Potter had surely felt it yesterday at dinner – he
Draco fought back a laugh as Longbottom spoke to Potter, and the man sent him one last vicious glare before turning away and responding.

And he was.  He was clinging to Draco’s trousers with the grip of a madman, body wound up and taut with an un-releasable tension.
They fell into some easy banter that Harry tentatively dispelled when he asked, “Seriously though, how are you doing?”

“And…and it’s not
“Well, well, look who finally got up the courage to come by,” he breathed – forcing himself into his role as the confident “haunted escort” rather than the “starstruck damsel” he’d become.  He prayed his acting was as good as he gave himself credit for.
HARRY: [confessional] Malfoy’s a bit…uptight, to say the least.  We don’t get along at school, no.  There’ve been several incidents in which he’s called me a ‘classless orphan’ or insulted Molly’s recipes, and I’ve sort of lost it at him.  He doesn’t get along with our classmates very well either – I think it has something to do with being raised by a pair of rich restaurant tycoons with the expectation that he will inherit their culinary kingdom someday soon…  It’s
“And now,” the man whispered, “we fight.”  It sounded less of a command than a question, and for a long moment, neither of them even moved.
His hands paused over a sleek grey suit he hadn’t found much occasion to wear.  He’d gotten it in a rare splurge at a Muggle shop back when he thought that Quidditch might drive him out of the Wizarding World altogether, but in the end, he had endured – the way he’d endured the many places and people who’d caused him suffering before.
Harry smiled sincerely and moved closer to him on the couch.  “You’re so difficult.  I lo-” he cut off, continuing rapidly with, “
Draco closed his eyes against the onslaught, drawing in a long, deep breath as he wished to be literally anywhere else.  “This.  Isn’t.  About.  You.”

Draco looked his mother in the eye.  He sucked in a breath to temper the blow.  “You need to leave.”

Then, Harry’s eyes narrowed, and he was dropping to his knees.

Harry had just started to ask him something starting with “Do you-” when a knock broke them from their sappy stares.
“Kat, Marla – your outfits are great.”
He pressed his head against the cool glass and thought instead of the slight smile Gloria had given him when he’d handed his wand over this week.  Her eyes were usually filled with such pity and concern, and the change was startling enough to spark confidence in him.  If the barmaid had trusted that he would be okay now, then he supposed it was his duty to, as well.
impatience for winter holidays.  His students, being first years, had less of the existential crises over the results of their exams, but they also proved to be the class most easily influenced by the stressful chaos surrounding them.
Draco was aware that he was making a fool of himself, saying things he would never normally say.  Things that made him look weak and emotional and every other insult his father had ever thrown at him.  He heaved, hardly seeing Harry’s hands as they hovered in the air in front of him, hardly understanding why the air wasn’t coming fast enough.
Things were not improving.

The song was slowing, and Malfoy dipped Harry elaborately one more time before pulling him to a stop, front and center.  While his nemesis was barely flushed from the exercise, Harry himself was panting.  The realm of “dance” was a formidable battlefield, it seemed.

“Distractions are nice,” he whispered.  “Can you give that to me?”
Draco kept his expression neutral for Harry.
the Savior, after all.”
Draco waited for more.  There had to be more – some deeper explanation for reopening such deep-seated wounds.  There had to be.
Despite his continued misgivings, Draco’s life fell into a tidy routine at The White Wyvern.  In the mornings, he’d wake and be served breakfast downstairs by Gloria – the older woman who’d eyed him worriedly from the bar the first night he’d arrived.  She looked at him no differently now, their pleasant (if not overly long) exchanges colored by her obvious discontent and not-insignificant pity.

Her face twisted into a frown.  “But…what if I’m not?  What if I’m just, I don’t know,

He wet his lips, taking a long look before leaning in by Harry’s ear.  “And how many spanks do you think you deserve?” he whispered, wrapping a hand possessively around Harry’s nape.  When the man didn’t respond beyond a shiver, he offered, “You know, you called me ‘

The five months Draco had spent at Morpheus’ Miscellany had worn him down to someone he could barely recognize in that dirty, dimly-lit mirror.  His skin was sallow and pale from the unpleasant combination of staying inside all the time and the prolonged use of cleaning charms in place of a shower.  His hair was lank; his mouth was grim; and his eyes – well, they were the only part that had remained the same.
it – after years of lusting and dreaming.  It had a good girth to it, and the velvety skin felt even more perfect in his grip than he could have imagined.
And Draco just kept on swallowing.  Each clamp of his throat sent a shockwave through Harry head to toe, and his knees threatened to buckle with each ripple of unbearable pleasure.  He planted his hands more solidly against the opposing wall to hold himself up and prayed he was keeping quiet...
“You think?”  Kat smirked and performed a twirl, which sent the snake-locks snapping through the air.  “I worked for
Draco hadn’t meant to land behind Potter and start an argument – he really hadn’t – but there was something about the ex-hero’s self-pitying body language that drew him there and made him do just that.

He was annoyed, but he also couldn’t argue with her.  If they pushed back the release of their wands, Draco wasn’t sure he could will himself to survive until then.

The man clearly regretted it.  There was no other way to explain the look in his eyes last night when he’d come to his senses followed by his swift, silent retreat.  Draco had been a fool to be drawn in by that almost-kiss at the doors.  It probably wouldn’t have even been a kiss – just Harry leaning in to look more closely at his fangs, then leaning back and saying something perfectly clueless, like “Nice charms work, Malfoy.”

“Are we really doing this right now?” Malfoy asked, after Harry pulled him into a sequence of just-passable steps that he had only seen before in movies.  His voice sounded resigned and wary, and though he’d stopped fighting every movement Harry made, his body was still unbearably tense.  He wished Malfoy would relax a little, so they could—
“Wand magic?” she repeated.  “Hmm, alright.  What
What he truly feared had gone wrong was his disastrous attempt at flirting.  He’d said too much, far too soon – he’d pushed Potter away in reeling him closer.  It was everything he’d warned himself not to do and also what kept him up at night, petrified that it would happen.

Draco relaxed a smidgeon as he came in and shut the door.

The chains pinning him down before an audience.

Ron clapped him on the back, and Harry knew it was time to go over there.  He muttered, “fresh produce, fresh produce, fresh produce” under his breath, and was about ten feet away from Malfoy when the man glanced up and noticed him.
At his obvious reluctance, her lips twitched with amusement.  “Nothing bad.  I simply wanted to see how you’re getting on with your classes.  Everything going smoothly, I trust?”

McGonagall announced the Halloween Ball at that dinner the following night, and Draco was torn between feeling proud and nauseated when she announced he would be taking Slughorn’s place.  On the one hand, it was an honor – he’d be stepping in as Head of House, a position that would reflect well on him if he performed capably.  But, on the other hand, it was a lot of responsibility to heap on a new hire whom had only interacted with first-years in the specific situation of flying class.

Snowmen and reindeer shimmer delicately through the cellophane, and the homey festivity of the scene plays upon the audience’s familial nostalgia.  They peek at each other from behind the biscuits.]
“Maybe it just didn’t hear,” Draco said.  “Stripey jumpers!” he yelled, then “Jumpers with thumb-holes!  What does it mean?!”
“Eventually, my sentence ended, and they returned my wand to me.  At which point, I hoped that I could maybe get a job in something other than just mixing potions or flying.  So I applied to the position at Hogwarts, and-” here, Draco was horrified to feel his throat catching once again, “-and someone was kind enough to give me a second chance.”  Tears burned at the corners of his eyes, startling in both their suddenness and appearance.  “I had honestly applied expecting to be rejected straight off.  But I also knew that if any place would take me, it would have to be someplace run by a sentimental Gryffindor.”  He finished with a wet laugh that did nothing to hide his emotion like he had hoped.
Draco cleared his throat and desperately tried to focus.
Draco drew in a ragged breath.  “Every time I think I have you cornered, you always surprise me,” he murmured, dragging a thumb across Harry’s bottom lip.  And he did – Draco was constantly surprised any time he looked down to find his hands upon this man without the world crashing down.  Without Harry pushing him away out of principle.  Someday, Harry might even surprise him with loving him back – though the simple thought made his chest tight with ill-advised hope.
The question snapped him back to attention.  Pity was the last thing he needed now.  “Why wouldn’t I be alright?”

“They might do something like this.” Harry unzipped his trousers and pulled down his pants. His dick stiffly flopped out, slapping him in the lower abdomen.

Pudding ran down the sides of his thick shaft as pleasure pulsed through his eight-inch member.

A groan.
“Everything,” Harry asserted, a blush rising in his cheeks, but powering on nonetheless.  “I want to get to know you better.”

When he felt safer within the walls of his own more organized mind, he managed to speak again.

still lay open.  The man winced, and the waves of shame practically emanated from him.
“Good,” Draco spat, feeling his mouth twisting into a cruel smile.  “We never got our rematch.”
“Why?”  Now, he was genuinely curious.  What had bothered the Savior of the Universe enough to ask around and find him?
He walked back over to Draco, pudding in hand and said, “With this, you’d probably start with the pudding skin.” He peeled off the pudding skin and rubbed it along Draco’s phat, juicy, pouty lips.
“Are you alright?  Do you want some tea?”  Harry asked, gesturing with the kettle – which was apparently full, as water sloshed out the spout and hissed into steam upon the counter.
His smugness faded in an instant as he noticed the panic settling on Potter’s face.  The way his jaw was working, but no sound was coming out.
He’d messed up the spell—or the incantation’s smooth sway—
Anyway, thanks for reading!  Let me know what you think.
Draco arrived at The White Wyvern the following week with great apprehension.  It was just past nightfall, and he wasn’t sure what to expect – though, he’d brought his Quidditch leathers as requested.  He’d had to write home for them, which had been an ordeal in and of itself.

His shoe scraped on the stones of the dungeon, and he realized he’d been unconsciously backing up.  Remembered that this was a

The question took him by surprise, though Potter’s poorly-veiled interest inspired him to respond as mysteriously as possible.  “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
“I wish to discuss some Quidditch matters with you, if you wouldn’t mind.”
Her mouth twitched into a small smile, though she looked earnest as she responded.  “Well, I wasn’t planning to, but you looked right pathetic over here, and I have a weakness for strays.  You look much less intimidating without your trademark posture and glare.”
“Always?  I notice the change in tense there, Potter.  What – you think I’m up to something, even now?”
After a few moments, Harry opened his eyes again.  At their bewilderment, Draco grinned.  “See you after the match,” he whispered against the man’s lips before standing and turning to go.

Draco could see that Harry was hiding something from him – something to do with that mysterious allusion to “love” – and it needled him in a way that made him even more obstinate than usual.  “Harry, pass me that tome over there, won’t you?  I would get it myself, but I need some sort of sign that you’re as

Draco turned to face him fully.
The second point threw him off more than he cared to admit, as he suddenly found himself with an unobstructed view of those emotional, emerald eyes.
Draco arrived at the room on time, but chose to mess with Potter a bit before going in.  He leaned on the wall outside of the classroom and listened to the increasingly flustered pacing of the man from inside.  It made him smile.
A dark thought crossed Draco’s mind, and he let himself say it.  “I just wish he could be healthy so I could go back to hating him.”  It was the core of his tangled emotions, he realized – the ugly, hidden center.
He clearly
“For wearing clothes that fit me?”  He pressed his knee to Harry’s groin, delighting at the strangled moan it wrenched out of the other man.
“No really – it’s my longest and most elaborate prank yet,” he insisted, actions belying his words as his face inched closer and closer to Harry’s.  They kissed, and it was a cataclysm of hands and cheeks and eyelashes.  Draco pulled Harry in with a firm grip at his nape, while Harry surged against Draco like a wave.  He crowded Draco against the wall with searing hands.
, come true, but also the crushing guilt of feeling like you’d misinterpreted and forced these feelings onto that person you’d come to care about.  And then, you couldn’t even just enjoy remembering the moments you spent together that got you excited, because your perception of them is forever changed by the fact that they didn’t feel the same way.  It’s just…it’s not fair.”
Remembering Harry’s reaction to his earlier order, Draco fisted the hair gently along his neck.  Not too tightly – just enough to show that he was still there.  Harry stiffened for a moment, and then a shiver of pleasure raised goosebumps along his spine.
Right.  Draco jumped up and searched the room for the fastest place to hide – behind the chairs?  Too uncovered, especially if they came in.  Under the bed?  He wasn’t sure he’d fit.  In the wardrobe?  The door was broken, and the thing looked like it would fall apart.  In panic, he catalogued the room again, seeing only a wasteland of open space.
prefer.”
But this was best.  Potter couldn’t know.  This obsession was too unwieldy, it ran too deep.  If he stayed, it would all show on his face; he would have to act disinterested.  That was how seduction worked, wasn’t it?
The barb drove Draco to stand taller, twitching Bagman’s hand from its place on his shoulder.  “I had the Dark Lord in my house,” he said flatly.  “It takes more than a little Quidditch to scare me.”
Harry’s brow furrowed, but he didn’t let go of Draco’s arm.  “No, I really think she would.  But it also feels like something you have to find the courage to ask about first.  Some things are just like that…like the Sorting Hat.”

He slumped back in his seat, relieved beyond measure.
Draco’s heart skipped as his thoughts fell utterly silent.  Potter’s body was mere inches from his, the man’s eyes locked steadily on Draco’s neck.  Widened slightly, like he’d realized something momentous.
…  He raised an eyebrow and cleared his throat in a way he hoped looked more casual than telling.  “And?  What did he want?”
“I’m seducing Draco Malfoy,” he ground out.  “Or trying, anyway.”

If, for whatever reason, you have not answered all of my questions at that time, you can choose either to forfeit your opportunity to regain your wand at today’s meeting and reschedule for another time, or we will administer another drop and proceed in that manner until either you’ve forfeited or completed all the questions.  Do you verbally acknowledge that you understand the outlined process?”
VOLDEMORT: [reluctantly] Yes, this is one of the best gingerbreads I’ve had the pleasure to encounter.  [He eyes the mini Cho and Cedric and seems put out that MINERVA made him try a tree instead.]  And the decoration is well-executed, though it is too cutesy for my tastes.

I apologize that Harry has been largely absent from this/the last chapter 😅  Don't worry - he'll make his reappearance in the next one, I promise.  The boy just gets very angsty sometimes.

would’ve taken it back when he and Harry used to compete.
“I wouldn’t care.”  Hating the anxiousness in Harry’s eyes, Draco cupped his cheek and ghosted gently over the stubble.  They were playing a new kind of game that had cropped up on occasion between them lately – one in which they felt out how serious the other was while always maintaining a layer of whimsy to fall back upon.  If Harry balked, then it would be a joke; if he accepted, then not even Draco knew where they would land next.

Whatever Harry was going to say was lost to a wordless, wandless
“Fine,” he found himself saying.  “Fine.  Just let me go.”
Without waiting for an answer, he hauled Harry to his feet, pressing a kiss that was mostly teeth to his mouth.  He backed him up until Harry knocked into the desk.
Potter lurched forward a step, jaw hardening, eyes flashing.  Some sick part of Draco liked it though – liked it and wanted to make him mad enough to hit him; at least then he could feel some physical proof of this maddening tension.
“Harry-” he warned, realizing that the man, in fact, knew
Give them some love; they are a superhero!
FRED: Hey, George – feeling a little crisp today, isn't it?
“A toast!” Fenn cried, when most of the upperclassmen had drinks in hand.  “To our first win this year, and starting the season out right!”  A cheer went up through the students.  “And to our flight instructor being a Slytherin, who should want to continue seeing his house succeed in the future,” she added with such self-referential nepotism that Draco had to laugh aloud in response.
Draco was so caught up in his thoughts that he nearly ran into McGonagall while turning a corner in the halls.
“Guess you’ll just have to wait and see,” he huffed and turned away.
“I can fucking

“What, do you find this conversation vulgar?  Come Narcissa, you can’t argue with the truth.”

Something like relief shone in those green eyes, and it struck Draco that he had set the bar extraordinarily low for himself if him complying with common decency was so utterly surprising.  For possibly the first time, he found himself vowing that’d he’d try to be less of a prick – though, it was hard when Potter had that unique way of getting under his skin.
The man glared at him for a long moment.  “Yeah, I got it alright.

Thoughts of winning fled his mind as Malfoy’s tongue licked against his, and then he found himself helplessly—
After a while, he looked up at him, eyes sliding past Draco’s as he bit out, “I was wrong, okay?  What do you want – a trophy?”  Then, despite Draco’s silence, “Now, not another word.”

“Oh, you know
Slughorn at least had the grace to look sheepish about it all, but Draco was cursed once again with feelings of sympathy that prevented him from appreciating the situation with the full extent of his pettiness.  Potter would be proud of him for his sudden magnanimity; if Potter ever looked at or spoke to him again, that is.
The official documents lay forgotten now, as the judge leaned forward in her seat.  “And who did you perform this Legilimency on?”
“Well, you forgot it while we were dueling,” the man sassed back – and even looked a little put out by it too.
“How’d you know?” Harry asked, once he surfaced – reluctantly – from the embrace.  He could vaguely hear the cheering of his friends in the background.

Harry looked ready to strangle him, though.  The man wobbled over to where Draco was standing, and – half expecting a punch – Draco was shocked when Harry simply dropped onto his knees without prompting.
Potter was a fucking idiot – that much was abundantly clear.  That he had first ignored him, then pulled his wand on him with some didactic speech on the unchanging evil of Draco’s character, and then had the

Despite himself, Draco let out a dry chuckle, charmed.  “They say your ‘true’ feelings come out in times of duress.”
And just like that, Harry succeeded in playing dumb to seduce his man.  It worked for him countless times thereafter, and – despite Hermione’s disdain – became a favorite technique of his that would last throughout the decades.
