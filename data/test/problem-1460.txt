That being said, I realize that things with Draco and Harry are still not resolved and that we haven't had any more information on the bond between them. Don't fret. We are finally back at Hogwarts in this chapter. More information on the bond is coming soon. Promise. There's a lot going on for the boys these days!
This time Harry couldn't quite keep the snort at bay. "Um, I've been attacked by a Basilisk, Voldemort' soul, Aracnomantula, Dementors, a Dragon, and-" shooting Draco an annoyed look, "-enthusiastic Voldemort supporters during my time here."
Draco was confused, disoriented, and his head was now throbbing. Lifting a hand, he rubbed at the spot that was now throbbing. That was, however, the only spot that hurt. He recalled all of the wounds that had been inflicted upon him and panic began to bubble beneath his normally cool exterior. His hands flashed out, running over his body to all the spots he knew should be wounded, but miraculously they were fine. The knife wound in his shoulder was healed, his jaw was no longer broken or sore, and there was no pain coming from his back. He was fine. Disoriented, but alive.
Rosalind, as she watched, made a nod of approval as the two boys reacted as they should when the process was started. They would remain unaware of the lengthy process that had been started. For them, time currently meant nothing. The older Elves, however, still had much to do. As the boys relaxed, the High Lords directed their element, one by one, to pool around them. Only once Lothair had successfully added his own element, was their strength tested. It was a tense twenty minutes, struggling to maintain balance among the elements and plead their case, but eventually the energy settled and directed it's attention toward the boys.
The moment Harry was laying comfortably on the bed, Rosalind pocketed her wand. Among the Elves, a wand was not a necessity. It eased the strain of accessing one's magical core when simple tasks throughout the day, but for those who had strengthened their connection to the world around them, there was no need to draw on their magical core. In her line of work, Rosalind had grown accustomed with using her tying her magical core with the ever flowing energy of the earth. Jade Manor had not been placed idly. It had been built in the North on that exact spot because there natural lines of magic crossed. It was no difficult task for Rosalind to slip into those streams and gradually draw on the natural healing magic found there.
The sound of tearing fabric had grey eyes snapping back up to watch as the familiar form at the end of the bed used a ripped off piece of Draco's sheet to try and catch some of the blood still stemming from his nose. The voice was familiar, though slightly smoother than Draco remembered. After six years of bitter rivalry, Draco couldn't mistake that voice for anyone. "Potter?" he asked, his voice slightly worried and more than a little incredulous. The last time he'd seen Dumbledore's Golden Boy, he'd been some short, scrawny,bespectacled git. He hesitated for a moment, unsure if he'd been wrong. Perhaps he'd imagined the familiar quality of the voice. This couldn't be Potter.
"Come on, Caligula," she responded dryly, her grip surprisingly strong as she turned him in the opposite direction. "You might as well use that energy for something useful."
Rosalind glanced to Draco, giving him an apologetic look. Spreading her hands in front of her, she shrugged. "There's never been a case like this before," she responded, "It could be any variation of characteristics from enhanced senses, a pack mentality, to eating habits. We just won't know until said characteristics manifest. The only thing I can offer you is an assurance that you will not be able to take wolf form. There isn't enough of the lycanthropy cells to support a full shift between forms."
Somehow, he'd managed to slam his mental shields down and force him out, but not before Potter had seen whatever there was to see in his mind. He had said he hadn't seen anything but that was a lie. Draco knew he had. What exactly Potter had seen, however, was unclear and unlikely to be divulged anytime soon ... particularly since the idiot was doing his best to ignore Draco's very existence.
A brief nod the only acknowledgement Albus received as Severus limped awkwardly in through the door, closing it firmly behind him. Corridors empty or not, he'd learned to take precaution.
His insistence on joining this group hadn't been anything quite so noble as wanting to be a part of it or even wanting to protect that idiot behind him. He'd insisted on going because there was the possibility that Snape would be present for the meeting and he might then get the chance to confront him and determine whether or not he could be trusted.
The demand snapped Gwynn out of her silent musings, causing her to take a step back when he held out the reigns of Ilaria's mount. "No, absolutely not. Ilaria will have my head on a platter before the sun rises. I will not be held responsible for stealing her horse from the Royal Stables."
I do not own Harry Potter or anything in relation to the Harry Potter verse. There has been no monetary gain from the creation of this story. It has been created merely for my own entertainment and that of my readers.
"Harry," he returned, reaching forward to grip the man's forearm as his was gripped in return, his eyes lingering on the winding lines of tattoos that spiralled up the man's forearm from his wrist and the scars that dotted his skin. The latter had Harry wondering if they were earned in battle or courtesy of his work, but he didn't ask.
"No," he responded, slowly, "Why would I need to talk to McGonagall about it? I've only been gone for two weeks. Games haven't even started yet."
Ilaria nodded, before hopping off the display case she'd so casually perched herself atop of. "I look forward to the earful I'll get when Caedmon learns I've bought another sword," she smiled, as she ushered Harry back to the door.
He was so silent and still that for a moment Draco thought the worst before a low moan escaped Harry and his head rolled to the side.
Having only a couple of days to grow accustomed to the idea of being a ruler, it was only natural for him to experience a sharp jolt of embarrassment at the mentioning of his full title. He had grown used to the annoying title of Boy-Who-Lived, but he didn't think he'd ever grow accustomed to being referred to as the Dark Prince of the Elven Realm. Simply thinking the title left him full of apprehension and doubt. It was a significant title that he didn't think he could live up to. He briefly wondered if Dumbledore, himself, could live up to such expectations.
Another few moments of being led through the streets found the two of them standing outside a small shop, the only sign that it might be a swordsmith was the wrought iron sign hanging above the doorway that depicted to swords crossed over a shield. Harry raised an eyebrow at that and turned to look skeptically at Ilaria. "Not very original."
"He'll be fine," she nodded, sitting back, "but he's going to have one hell of a headache when he wakes up."
"I bet," he smiled, blue eyes shifting to Draco, "And you, Mr. Malfoy. I'm glad to see that you're well. It was my understanding that you might have been lost to us."
There was no need to repeat the command. The feet of the second messenger were in motion long before Roland had released him. The order would be given and the Wolves would be dead within the hour. If not, there would be hell to pay.
Draco had to fight the urge not to shift in his seat. Blaise had always had a way of making you feel like he could see right through you and given the fact that the only thing keeping him from seeing the full extent of Draco's changes was a simple glamour spell, Draco was a little less than comfortable.
This news was not something that Molly had expected to hear and it wasn't something she wanted to listen to. She listened not because she wanted to but because she had to. As Dumbledore continued, she began to look as though she was going to explode. Her cheeks flushed, her eyes narrowed, and her mouth formed a very thin line. It was not a look that the occupants of the room were unfamiliar with, which, in part, was the reason that Remus spoke before an angry syllable could fall from her lips.
Silence held for a moment as those around the table took in that information. Even Draco was startled by the claim. Potter sat perfectly still, that same cold mask he'd been showing the past few days locked in place.
"Damn it, damn it, damn it," he muttered, more then a little panic sinking into the tone of his voice. Turning Draco onto his back, Harry did the only thing he could think of. Clearing Draco's airways, he sealed his mouth around the other boy's and breathed air into him. After a brief moment of this, he pulled back and placed his hands on Draco's chest, applying pressure in the hopes he might be able to get his heart started again and the water out of his lungs. After several more rounds of this, Draco still hadn't moved and Harry was starting to lose what little bit of his calm that he had.
Rolling her eyes, Gwynn shoved water in his direction before accepting the fact that Harry really had no idea what he was doing half the time. She knew he hadn't meant to make it look like there was anything going on between the two of them...still, that didn't mean she was looking forward to having to face Terrak and the others in the training room. She just knew they'd jump all over the opportunity to make fun of her. Shifting back until she was sitting on a submerged ledge across from Harry, she pinned him with a curious look. "Is that why you went after that human? Are you attracted to him?"
Whether it was because he honestly knew that he was being terribly self-centered or because of the disappointment in Soren's eyes, Harry wasn't entirely sure but he found himself feeling completely insignificant next to Soren's anger. He'd been lectured in the past but Soren made each and every word feel like the edge of a sharpened blade against his skin.
Turning around, he half expected a similar room to be laid out in front of him, but instead he found himself blinking in surprise. He hadn't been inside this room and, if he was honest with himself, he'd half expected the room to be done in horrifying shades of scarlet and gold. Instead, it was decorated in varying shades of green and cream accented by dark wood furniture. It gave him the sense of stepping into a forest, which had a surprisingly relaxing effect on him. Whoever had designed it, certainly not Potter, had done a rather tasteful job. Further more, he hadn't immediately entered into the sleeping area. Instead, he found himself in what he assumed was a rather large sitting room. Beyond which, there were three separate doors, no signs to differentiate between them.
"Why?" he asked, his hands clenching back into fists as they hung at his sides. Potter had made the decision to save him before the influence of the bond, so what was Potter's reason for it? Why had Potter been so determined to force him into this. Why was any of this happening?
Harry didn't know how his part was very well done, particularly since he'd ended up on his back once again. He didn't even have the excuse of it being Ilaria who had done it. Gwynn was a student just like him; an extremely good student, but a student none the less. Pushing himself up onto his elbows with a raspy breath, Harry shot her a glare. Her amusement wasn't helping the situation, nor was the murmuring coming from the remainder of the class: a mix of awe, fear, and anger.
Lothair motioned for him to use the statue he'd touched, which made Harry feel ridiculous as he stood staring up into the face of a giant snake. Slytherin's decorating expertise was something to be questioned. He starred at the stone for a minute before looking back at Lothair and shrugging.
Harry's eyes snapped open. The sharp sound of something tapping against glass had cut across his mind like a newly sharpened blade, scattering the images of his dream and once again burying the name he so desperately needed.
Harry nodded. There had been times in the past when that would have been an impossible task. It was strange that now it didn't seem so hard. Perhaps it had been watching the blond disappear beneath the rushing current or, perhaps, it had been the fear of finding him dead that had changed his outlook. Whatever it was, Harry no longer saw him as less. He was on equal footing with those Harry had cared about for years. Had it been Ron or Hermione, he would have done the same thing. If saving them had meant being bound to them, then so be it. Somewhere along the way, Draco had taken up a place beside them. He couldn't say when or where, but the deep sense of approval in his chest told him it was the truth.
Soren held up a hand to stop his protest. Confusion was a common aspect when it came to the tutelage of individuals from outside of the realm. There were many aspects that belonged to them alone. "Everything I have said is the truth. Think hard, Harry. Where does magic come from?"
"I haven't abandoned them!" Harry protested, trying to move around Draco, but this time Gwynn had shifted to block his way.
Despite the fact that they had just gained one of the three votes they needed, Harry had a feeling that Kolvar's words were not quite as innocent as they had sounded. He (and the Dragons) were going to be getting something out of this. What that was, Harry couldn't say. He couldn't imagine what either party would want. Still, he supposed, now wasn't the time to look a gift horse in the mouth. His attention shifted to the others. "And you?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
Then why had he been so concerned with whether or not the blond would live? Dislike would not have fed the concern.
Reaching the same conference room they had used before, Harry pulled the doors open and the three of them filed in. "Sorry to have kept you waiting," he apologized, taking his seat beside Soren and leaving the other two to find their own. His eyes didn't stray to Draco, instead focusing on the unfamiliar face at the table. He was young. Or he, at least, appeared young. Younger than both Hendrik or Theodore.
He'd been denying what sort of bond this was from the beginning. Soren had tried to ease him into it. Gwynn had all but called him out from the beginning. It had just been easier to assume it was a standard blood bond with nothing more to it than that, but this growing pain in his chest had slowly deteriorated the lie he'd been telling himself. The flat out rejection had shattered it. Hell, it had felt like it had shattered him. It had taken every ounce of willpower he had in him to put on that mask of anger and prevent the blond from seeing anything but irritation.
"Come on," he muttered, moving forward. As he did so, the torches on the wall began to flicker to life, casting a creepy shadow over the snakeheads lining the tunnel. At some point, the place must have flooded a bit because the splash of their footsteps echoed loudly off the walls.
"We can't ignore his presence at the border," Soren commented, interrupting any bout of bickering that was about to take place. "I, personally, would like to know how they came to know where the border to these lands lay."
Draco frowned, the anger he'd been holding onto rolling around inside of him. He was positive that if his mother were dead, his father would have made a scene of it. Lucius Malfoy, if nothing else, was a showman. He wanted people to look even if his actions made him seem like a madman. Since Voldemort's return, that narcissistic side of his had only strengthened. That being said, if he wanted an audience than the most likely place for her to be was the Manor. That's where the foot traffic was. There were other properties, of course, but none had as much Death Eater presence as the main estate.
Harry only shrugged and continued on. It didn't matter if she didn't believe him. There was a part of him that did want to talk to the blond. That part of him wanted to talk to the blond so badly it hurt, but Harry was done dealing with that part of himself. When Draco had agreed to go back to Hogwarts, he'd been hit with a panic so deep it had nearly knocked him off his horse. It had been a million times worse than when he'd felt him cross the border into the Elven realm because Harry knew what awaited him on the other side of that border. It was pain and it was death.
This time the voice came from further down the table. In the seat beside Draco, an elbow propped on the table with his chin resting casually on the opened palm of his hand was Oriss. His dark red hair pulled back from his face, pinned back to fall freely down his back, gold eyes peering at Harry with a hint of a smirk lingering in their depths. "He is no longer a wizard."
For the fifth time, Harry's sword hit the stones of the courtyard with a resounding clang as a small line of blood blossomed across the back of his hand where Gwynn had nicked him with her blade. It was an amateur mistake and he knew there would be a frustrated look of confusion on her face long before he had a chance to glance up at the obvious physical evidence. It was entirely out of character for him and she knew it.
His amusement didn't diminish as he listened to Draco cursing as he reached the bottom, followed by a much more silent Lothair. The accompanying sounds of the rest of the guard following him before the scraping of stones above indicated that the entrance was closing up after them, another benefit. A moment later, the rest of the guard appeared and he nearly laughed at the disgusted look on Gwynn's face as she brushed off a clump of muck off her cloak.
ALSO...thanks to those of you who submitted reviews. I appreciate all of your opinions and thoughts! Thanks again to
Turning in that direction, he made a sprint for the stairs, startling some poor first year as they were coming up late to dinner. "Sorry," he muttered, shooting down the stairs and ignoring Ron's call for him to wait up.
is stretching the truth," she muttered, shaking her head. "You're the only Elf I know whose hair sticks up out of a bloody braid."
To her right, Oriss unfolded his arms from where they had been crossed. "Seems there is no longer any point to argue. Three had voted in your favour," he commented, his voice smoother than Harry had expected it to be and he had the vague sense that it was quite the useful tool during negotiations. "I shall, of course, be interested in any worthwhile export opportunities."
Harry nodded, the wind finally being blown out of his sails. There were plenty of people on the team who were good players, but he could only really think of one who would take it seriously. "Ginny," he commented, glumly. "Do me a favour though?"
Harry nodded vaguely and glanced down at the bracelet in his hand. It wasn't exactly flashy so it shouldn't stand out too much and he should be able to conceal it with the sleeve of his robes.
With Gwynn still trailing behind him, Harry burst through the main doors, sliding slightly as he attempted to come to a stop faster then he was capable of. He was surprised to find one of the stable hands moving toward him, two horses already in hand: two very familiar and large horses. Erebus and Nyx. He briefly pondered if it was a coincidence that these two were the one he'd find first or if whatever was guiding his senses had led him to this particular junction of time.
Harry was much too annoyed to be overly concerned with his abrupt departure from McGonagall's office. Annoyed wasn't a strong enough word for what he was currently feeling. Rage, perhaps? Very intense dislike that wasn't quite hate? He wanted to go with hate, but the ever-present weight on his chest was a clear indication that he didn't hate the giant blonde git.
The emotions did not escape Soren as he stood there, looking into the eyes of a boy given the weight of two worlds to carry. Soren had plenty of his own responsibilities to contend with, but he would gladly be the constant in Harry's life if that was what he needed to fulfill his destined role. As a High Lord, that was what he'd been appointed for. This was his choice and his purpose. "There is nothing else that can be done to restore the mortal to his former health. He can remain beneath the stabilization spells for another few weeks before his health will begin to deteriorate beneath the magical quality of his wounds. His magic levels are not strong enough to destroy the foreign influence of the wounds inflicted by the wolves."
Harry's partner, whose name Harry kept forgetting, bowed and mumbled his apology. Ilaria, for her part, looked just about as impressed as Harry was currently feeling. She didn't believe that Harry was any different from the other students standing in front of her and she fully expected the others to feel the same way. Personally, Harry felt that they should be more worried about annoying Ilaria then throwing him around. He wasn't the one with the scary glare.
It was a silly thing, but having Potter save his arse stung his pride like nothing else. Falling flat on his face in front of the entire population of Hogwarts, ghosts included, would have been less damaging. Having it thrown in his face like that, only made him bristle all the more. "Add it to the list of things
She was not expecting, however, the red-haired whirlwind who suddenly came blustering into the Great Hall. She jumped slightly when the doors to the Great Hall were flung open with a bang, turning her head to find a wide-eyed Ron making a run straight for her. By the looks of him, he'd just rolled out of bed, which wasn't all that surprising. He usually made it to breakfast with barely enough time to shovel some food onto his plate. By the look of him, he hadn't bothered to take much care in his mad dash out the door. His shirt was buttoned wrong, his tie was missing, and the sleeves of his Robes were roughly three inches too short, which clearly indicated that he'd robbed someone of their robes.
After roughly five days of going to bed tired and bruised, Harry had petulantly snapped that he couldn't be expected to learn anything when he was paired with someone who knew everything. The sarcastic tone that lingered in his voice when he said "everything" had made Ilaria grin in such a way that the young Prince actually felt his skin crawl beneath his light tunic. Whatever she was thinking, Harry knew he probably wasn't going to like it.
Half a day. Twelve hours. That's how long they'd been riding for. Twelve long, bloody hours. They'd stopped briefly several hours ago to water and rest the horse, but the creatures seemed content to continue on. Harry, himself, was not sharing the sentiment. Every jolt and bump had sent a dull ache through him until that's all he could focus on. By the time they reached the edge of the realm and Lothair had ordered them to dismount, Harry practically cried with relief. Sliding out of the saddle, his knees nearly buckled when his feet found the ground.
"Does that mean Remus can cross the border?" Harry asked, his tone held a hint of hope in it that had Draco rolling his eyes.
Draco paused, turning to look at the other man. His eyes flashed with irritation even as he drew up all that reliable Malfoy arrogance and he snapped, "First off, I don't need our help finding sexual partner. Second, I don't sleep with servants. Third, the very last person I want to sleep with is Potter!"
At the look of confusion on Soren's face, Draco rolled his eyes. "A werewolf," he offered by way of explanation. "Bitten. Not born." As he said it, his eyes shifted to Harry and he rolled his eyes at the confusion he saw there as a low murmur swept the group. The prat really had no idea about anything.
Leaving the two to themselves, he headed toward where the other's were gathering. None of them seemed all that concerned about a large amount of tack that was piling up. A moment later, the reason for that became clear. With a few words Draco couldn't quite make out, they all vanished. He shot Lothair a questioning look but the other Elf didn't seem all that interested in answering the unasked question in Draco's eyes.
As he walked, Draco felt the shift in the air before he sensed a second presence. Frowning, he removed his hands from his pocket and half turned to glance back down the hallway. No one else should have been about. Not even the servants were due to be moving around for another hour or so. When he didn't see anyone, he continued on, all of his senses on alert. After another moment, he realized that whatever he was sensing was coming from ahead of him. In fact, it was coming from the exact place he was heading.
The sound of the doorknob turning echoed throughout the darkened room, the slight sound jolting him awake and causing his breath to catch in his throat as his fear held him firmly in place. There was no time to run and his overly stressed mind simply couldn't contemplate a single coherent plan.
"Oh, yeah, sorry!" Before they could add the last ingredient the potion had to remain under a stasis spell for fifteen minutes. Why? He had no bloody idea but he'd learned not to ask questions.
"Skirts, trousers, I don't care," Gabriel responded with a shrug. "Couldn't hurt, could it? It's not like you're going to be barking up the Prince's tree any time soon. I could introduce you to a few of the servants I've met?"
Following her line of sight, he spotted the fork in his hand was now bent at a ninety-degree angle. Flushing slightly, he took it and subtly bent it back into shape. "Well, I was," he argued. "You think we should start on that report Professor McGonagall gave us, but you know well enough that there's no way Ron or I are going to hole up in the library working on it when we still have two weeks before it's due."
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter-verse. This story has been created solely for my own amusement and no monetary gain has been made from its publishing.
"Yes, my Lord. I have several reliable contacts within the Jade Manor who are working on it as we speak."
The moment he was back to himself, Ilaria allowed her eyes to travel over him to take in as much of what she could see. The calculating look made some of Harry's nervousness return. He'd had individuals stare at him in the past but this was something else entirely. It wasn't fascination or even curiosity. This was like having his very soul broken open for easy reading. Harry was sure that if there were some sort of black mark in his past, this woman would be able to see it. She would know his every secret.
As of right now, things seem to be going smoothly on the writing front and I'm pleased with how things are unfolding. As promised, however, I have been working on cleaning up the story. I haven't finished all the chapters cause the ideas are flowing and I don't want to let that go to waste. I've also created a couple of character playlists for Depth of Darkness. They are all a work in progress. They will be continuously updated as I find new songs to inspire me. You can find it under dan1hart1ey. If you have any issues accessing it, feel free to drop me a PM and I'll send you the link.
"What?" she shrugged, "Now that his clothes fit, he's not half bad in that "needs to be dominated" sort of way."
"Let's continue," Soren said, nudging his horse forward. "If we delay further we will arrive late." They would take care not to show any sign of weakness. They had no idea what they were walking into and no matter how much Harry insisted that they were unlikely to be hostile, no one else was taking that chance. They would show a united front with little weakness to exploit. It was the only way to handle this situation with any amount of success. Soren still had some misgivings about this meeting, even if he couldn't deny the fact that it was necessary.
There was a long moment of silence as Lothair studied him, searching for something Harry could only guess at. "I know of an individual who could be helpful."
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter verse. The creation of this story was created solely for my own entertainment. No copyright infringements were intended and no monetary gain has been made.
Harry was pretty sure his head was going to explode. His eye was just going to stop twitching and his brain was going to explode all over the room. Maybe it'd land in Draco's hair and piss him off good. That'd be nice.
"Continue to watch for now," Roland responded, moving to stand. "I'll send him an invitation when I'm ready."
"And? It's cheating! If you don't tell them, I will!" Harry threatened, but Draco just smirked at him.
"We couldn't sense anything, Sir," Gwynn responded instantly. "Harry said there was a humming and then he was hit with a spell. This is everyone who was present in the hallway at the time."
The structure of the Kingdom was shifting. He didn't need to be within the halls of Jade Manor to know the truth of that statement. Despite their best efforts, the three High Lords were failing. Their movements were clearly visible to all those who knew what to watch for. Ilaria was flexing her muscles and the action was causing the leaves of the Kingdom to rustle. The long dead outposts of Galëgori, Zalthorián, and Antölia were beginning to stir. The thick dust that had lain peacefully over the shields of these outposts was even known being wiped clean. By the following evening bronze and silver would be shinning with the pale reflection of the moon. Unfortunately, the Realm's preemptive movements would do noting but help bring the entire Realm to its knees. The Elven Realm would fall before him and he would have his revenge. Of that, Roland had no doubt. No longer would those of the Manor disrespect him and his. The wheels were already in motion and nothing was going to get in the way. Not even the reinstatement of an untrained and useless ruler.
Potter was no Prince, of that he was certain. Potter was a stain on Draco's very existence; a plague. Cool grey eyes remained narrowed as he watched the two interact, his presence going by unnoticed in the long shadow of the entrance way.
It was a pleasing effect, Draco had to admit, in combination with his recent physical changes. He, by all rights, should have felt particularly pleased with his appearance. His frame held more strength, more authority. Gone were the signs of physical abuse suffered at the hands of his father. Gone were the emotional scars and insecurities...at least from the surface. They lingered just out of sight, squeezing his chest painfully as he recalled them; recalled the last view of his Mother and the infuriating refusal of his Father to tell him her fate. Lucius has seen the weakness in his son immediately and had latched onto it with relish. His love and fear for his Mother had become just another tool to slice away at Draco's resolve.
"I'm glad we got that sorted out," He responded, offering her a nod of approval and continued on down the hall, showing absolutely no intent to continue the conversation or do as she had suggested.
Draco was furious. In fact, Draco was so furious that he was certain the word was simply not enough to convey the full extent of his emotions. His life was falling apart around him. He had no family. His mother was likely dead and his father wanted him to be as well. He had no home. He could trust no one. He'd been mauled by a damn werewolf and could very well be on his way to becoming one himself. Then to top it off, he'd nearly died all so perfect, idiot Potter could go and bound the two of them together in some half-baked attempt to save him. He was sure it had more to do with the idiots hero-complex than any real desire to keep him alive. He had no idea the full extent of the bond forced upon him, but it didn't really matter. It likely wouldn't show it's depths until it had fully formed. He did know, however, that it wouldn't end well for him.
The two circled each other for a moment before Harry moved again. In the back of his mind, Draco felt a stab of irritation at having been put on the defensive once again. Each time Harry attacked, Draco deflected the blow, forcing the other man back. His sword seemed to vibrate in his hand, each ring of steel on steel sounded angry and the blade seemed to grow cold in his hand; the sort of cold that burned your skin.
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter verse. This story has been created simply for my own amusement and there has been no monetary gain made from the production of this story.
"Let's hear this wonderful explanation then," she urged, setting the files down in front of her, "for what reason will I be spending the vast majority of my skills and patience on rushing such a bond?"
Gwynn just snorted at the obvious concern Harry had about letting the creatures loose. "They'll return to the Manor," she offered, only further amused when Harry raised an eyebrow in surprise. "They are trained, you know."
Draco glanced back up at the question and offered a lazy shrug. "Given my options, I think the Elves are probably a safer bet than Voldemort or Dumbledore." He didn't offer up any information about his own Elf blood or the irritating bond between them. Keeping that to himself was probably in his best interest for now.
Ilaria, it seemed, had been waiting for just such an opportunity. With a wave of her hand, she suddenly held a lance taller than she was. "Well, what do you say, Lothair?" she teased, the excitement still flowing out of her. "Are you up for it?"
"In a sense," Lothair nodded, ignoring the smug look that moved over Draco's face and the irritation that flashed in Harry's eyes. "That is not the limit, however, elemental magic can be combined. For instance, if you combine your Wind magic with Draco's ice the magic itself will be strengthened. Luckily for the both of you, your elements are quite compatible. Not as strong as Ice and Water, but strong in it's own right."
"Draco?" she snapped, her own surprised morphing into an instant dislike that had been nurtured for years. "What the bloody hell are you doing here?"
The bond between the boys was something born of nature itself. In order to further it's stages, they would need first the approval and cooperation of the elements as well as their heightened strength. The magic at the core of each Elf, while significant, was no substitute for the natural magic of the world.
"Finally," he grinned, guiding Erebus into step beside her chestnut mare and heading back to the group without glancing back to Saeya behind him. "I thought I'd die of old age first."
As Rosalind's magic began to permeate the air in the room, the three High Lords moved to their respective spots around the two young men. It was an impossible task for a single Elf to access all four of the elements. When the elements were combined, there was always the clash of those best suited to be opposite. A single person could not divide their conscious four ways in order to control the instincts and power of each element. Some had managed two elements, but they were never elements at odds with each other. Wind might strengthen Fire, but pushed to far and fire would slip out of control. That was why the others stood around them, each connecting to their own element; Soren as wind, Ilaria as water, and Lothair as fire.
"Though," the man added, "I wouldn't be all that disappointed if you managed to leave Potter behind next time."
There were distinct warning bells resounding throughout his skull, but Harry was far too lost in the pain and anger he'd allow to swell within him. He simply couldn't stop the angry words that slipped through his lips. Growing up with the Dursleys and never knowing what it was like to be loved had left him wishing desperately for place where he belonged. When Hagrid had arrived and revealed an entire world that he could be apart of, Harry had thought his wish had been granted. Of course, that particular gift had come with an extremely sharp set of teeth that continued to rip away pieces of him. Everyone seemed to place him on a pedestal. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't possibly fit in. Now once again he'd been transplanted, only this time he had found himself stuck between two worlds. He knew nothing of the Elven realm that he was suppose to reside over and he no longer fit within the Wizarding world. He was more alone now than he had ever been before and was now being told that this was his predestined place in life. It was a jagged pill to swallow.
"What do you think I'm complaining about?" he snapped back, unconcerned by the look of irritation in Soren's eyes. He had enough irritation for three people so Soren's barely made a dent. "We've got Werewolves living in the castle, the Wizarding world poking around demanding we give them back their precious Potter, and, more importantly, we have a Prince who has no idea about anything and a Consort who may or may not be more Werewolf than Elf."
Steeling himself, he fixed a bored expression onto his face and headed toward the table and the rest of his housemates. As he got closer, his eyes moved over each of them. Pansy was waving him over and Zabini had a calculating look on his face as he watched Draco approach, neither of which was giving him a dangerous vibe. Zabini, he knew, was deciding whether or not he'd be a good investment. The man was intelligent, which was part of the reason Draco liked him. There was an opportunity there. Pansy, on the other hand, more than a little annoying but easy enough to sway. Crabbe and Goyle ... well, they just looked confused, glancing between themselves and Draco. He didn't have much concern there. They'd follow him. They didn't know any other way. Nott, Davies, and Greengrasss, however, were another story. Nott and Greengrass were watching him with narrowed eyes. Their families were right in there with his own when it came to Voldemort's inner circle and he had no doubt that they knew what had happened. Davies ... well, she was an enigma. She hadn't even glanced up to look at him and, frankly, he had no idea where she stood when it came to either side. The older crowd, however, was looking at him with more than enough hostility to know that he would do well to keep a particularly close eye on them.
Draco, having come out of his surprise, sighed. "As cool as this might be, how is this supposed to help us? It's dirty, dark, and sopping wet."
Pushing that thought from his mind, he took another step forward. Despite the cool night air, his skin was clammy and extremely warm. The blood trickling slowly down his chest felt like it was scorching its way over his skin. His strength was waning, making each step more difficult then the last. His entire body screamed at him to just lay down, but Draco struggled against the temptation. If he stopped now, he wasn't entirely sure he'd have the strength to get back up. He didn't want to die alone in some unknown forest, of that he was absolutely sure. He wanted his chance to face his Father again. He wanted to tell him exactly what he thought. He wanted to actually stand up to the man as an individual, not his puppet.
Embarrassment from having been surprised and lingering irritation both with himself for not sensing Potter's approach and Gabriel for his annoying personality, "Looks like I'm finished, doesn't it?"
For a moment it looked as though Rosalind was going to continue arguing, her rigid frame still standing firmly between Soren and Draco, but after several long moments, Harry spotted her shoulders drooping. Whatever Soren had been talking about, she clearly seemed to understand, which only confused Harry all the more. "What do I have to do?" he asked, hoping that they'd finally tell him something that might make some sense. He couldn't help imagining that Draco's life ebbed away with each passing moment as they stood there arguing. Not true, of course, but the urgency within him held firmly to the concept.
The shuffling sound of his feet echoed through the strangely quiet forest as Draco forced himself away from the support of the tree. He hadn't noticed it before, but, now that he was focused more on keeping his body moving and not his internal monologue, Draco was acutely aware of the fact that he couldn't hear any wildlife. There were no birds, no insects, nothing. A slight chill ran down his spine at that, causing the hair on the back of his neck to stand on end. After taking a few more steps he paused and cast a nervous glance around. An entire forest set in silence didn't bode well. It wasn't exactly a sign that everything was as it should be.
Since it was clear that he would not be finishing with his reading, Soren closed the book in his hands and set it down on the table beside him. "It is one Werewolf living in the castle and I think it is an excellent idea. We've simply relied on the pack to maintain the border without any sort of regular interaction. It will be good to have a liason to keep the peace. Second, the Wizarding world is not of any significance. They can not force our hand. Should Harry return for his schooling, they will be notified-"
Harry wasn't sure how he felt about that. He didn't know if he could lie to Ron or Hermione about this. Draco, however, had other matters of interest.
As he moved around to the side, Harry finally turned his head to look at him. Nothing had changed from the ride back from their rendezvous with Dumbledore. His face was still closed off. "
Something was terribly wrong and Harry didn't fight the deep protective desire flooding through him. With barely a thought to consider what he was about to do, Harry turned and started running. His new found strength offered him a burst of speed that Harry, under normal circumstances, wouldn't even think was possible, which left Gwynn struggling frantically to keep up with him. Harry barely registered her footfalls echoing behind them as he ran toward the stables. He wasn't entirely sure why, but he was positive that his entire life depended on him reaching the northern border before nightfall.
"The two of you will now be training together. You've gained enough skill and muscle strength not to be a liability to the other," Ilaria continued, "there is no point in continuing your individual training regimes. In battle, you will be fighting with others if you are not fighting together. Very rarely will you find yourself battling alone."
By the time he had entered the entrance hall, Draco and the others were gone. Focusing on his senses, he listened for a moment before the distinctive sound of Draco's voice reached him from the entrance into the dungeons. Of course, where else would they go?
choose death once he found out? Could he stand by and allow that to happen? Even without taking the time to consider, Harry knew that he wouldn't be able to. Out of all the confusion and fear that was currently wrapped around him, Harry knew one thing for sure: Draco Malfoy was not allowed to die. He couldn't decide why this was, but he knew things would go bad very quickly should Malfoy suddenly cease to live. The blond played some part in this political game, Harry just wasn't sure which role he was suppose to play.
Soren, seeing no further sense to an extended conversation with the wizards across from them, turned back to his own mount. Once back in the saddle, he directed his attention to Dumbledore. We shall make preparations for Draco's return. We shall notify you when he is ready to return.
In the second courtyard, there were a line of stone pillars that ran through the middle of the space. While Draco had never practiced in this particular courtyard, the targets fixed to the pillars told him it was designed to train the archers. That evening, however, it was being used for something else. Sitting atop the middle and largest of the pillars was Harry.
Harry flushed. He'd have liked to argue, but what she'd said wasn't entirely wrong. He was pretty bad when it came to using a bow. He just couldn't wrap his mind around the distance and adjusting for the wind. He still heard Gwynn's cackling whenever he even glanced at a bow, nor could he forget the stinging snap of the bow's release when he hadn't been holding it properly. If he never had to hold another bow in his life, he'd be happy.
"I'm telling him you said that." She commented, opening the door and leaving Harry along in the street to gap after her before quickly following her inside.
"Potter," he called, frowning at the somewhat childish image the other man created. When he didn't get an answer, he called again, but this time louder, "Potter!"
Biting his lip harshly against the pain moving required, Draco rolled from his side onto his stomach and pushed himself up on a severely shaking arm. His injured shoulder didn't allow for much pressure to be applied and, therefore, left him struggling with the use of only one arm. He had to pause to regain control of himself once he was on his knees. The new height allowed him a much better vantage point. The sight that surrounded him, however, did nothing to ease the worry he felt. Had he had the time or the mind to notice, Draco would have found the foliage surrounding him breathtaking. The very trees seemed to stand with pride, their roots stretching out before them before burrowing into the earth in search of pockets of water. The plants at their bases seemed to, rather then fight for the same water, wrap themselves around the roots of the tree quite harmoniously. It was well into the night, but Draco found he didn't have much of a problem seeing his surroundings. The light of the full moon flickered beautifully through the canopy of leaves to illuminate the forest floor. It reminded him strangely enough of the wooded area surrounding the Manor, but Draco knew that he wasn't anywhere near his childhood home. The very atmosphere felt lighter and he didn't recognize any of his surroundings. While the area was beautiful, Draco knew instantly that finding help might be a far harder thing then what he had the energy for.
"Sleeping beauty wakes," Lothair commented, without glancing up from the book he was reading. Harry could only imagine what that book contained to interest him. They hadn't even been there a full 24 hours and Lothair was already gathering what useful information he could. Spotting Gwynn, she offered him a smile and shifted over there was room for him to take a seat.
After several long moments of just blocking her attacks, Harry finally noticed the force behind each of Gwynn's attacks start to slacken. Of course, this didn't mean that her accuracy followed suit. While her swings might no longer cut him through, they would still cause severe and fatal damage. If he was not mistaken, Harry was almost positive that her attacks were getting closer and closer to hitting their target. One clean swipe from her outstretched sword and he'd be in serious trouble. The last thing he wanted to do was start his time in the Elven Realm with an emergency visit to the Healer.
"You did well," Gwynn responded, the same amused smile Ilaria had been sporting tugging at the corner of her lips. "You really shouldn't have lasted as long as you did."
Turning on his heel, Draco headed back in the opposite direction. The royal wing was rather large, designed for a large family and incorporating any extended relatives as well. When he'd been given the choice, he'd immediately taken the furthest room from Potter, which happened to be somewhat of an inconvenience right at that moment. It took him several moments before he reached Potter's door and he glanced around briefly before reaching out to test the handle. When it turned easily in his hand, he couldn't help the roll of his eyes. Of course it was unlocked. It wasn't like there was multiple people out there trying to kill him or anything. What was the point in locking the door? There were plenty of times when Draco couldn't help but wonder how Potter had managed to survive for as long as he had. This was one of those moments. Glancing around once more, he opened the door and slipped inside, closing the door silently in his wake.
"You are an Elf," she started, motioning for him to follow her. Leading him away from the main room, Rosalind stepped back into her professional quarters. Knowing the others would be returning, she did not head for the office, instead turning them toward the conference room. It was a little less personal, she supposed, but it would allow Draco the room to retreat if he so needed it. There was a lot of information to be stowed upon him. "Created as such in an attempt to save your life. I should stress upon you the significance of this. We do not involve ourselves in the affairs of the Wizards and we do not change them to increase our own population. We accept only those who have had Elven blood passed down through the generations and are lucky enough to have it activated upon their inheritance. Harry, as you are aware, insisted that we step in when it came to you. He was quite persistent that keeping you alive was the right course of action."
Had he not been so worried about Draco's condition, Harry might have actually been stunned into silence by the fact that he could actually understand what the wolf was saying. He hadn't heard any yips or barks, but actual words. As far as he was aware, Werewolves, while in their wolf forms, did not speak English … and he most certainly shouldn't have been able to pick up a hint of an Irish accent. "You had best hope, he survives these wounds. If he doesn't, neither will you."
It was not an opinion Harry was unfamiliar with. Gwynn had been trying to wrap her mind around his decision since he'd mentioned it to her an hour or so earlier. She kept trying to see it from different angles only to come up with the same end. Harry was an idiot. With nothing to argue, Harry groaned and sunk back under the water and out of Gwynn's view point.
None of them seemed willing to argue, instead of following after the older Elf with their respective horses in tow. The rest of the group seemed to ignore the tension surrounding the three of them and a part of Harry was particularly relieved by that. He didn't want to have to think about why that tension was there or how he was going to soothe it ... or even the fact that a part of him wanted to soothe it.
"And the High Lords?" Roland watched the image ahead of him flicker momentarily before focusing once more.
"Well," she sighed, gathering up her papers with a resigned look, "I suggest that you prepare yourselves. This is going to be a long and difficult night. I shall need all of your strength."
Harry snorted, a part of him was amused by the fact that he knew Draco wasn't going to like the next part. Served the git right. Moving to the opening, he shot the blonde a smirk before lifting himself into the opening and letting go. Once he reached the bottom, he stood up and wiped off some of the much he'd picked up on the way down. He supposed it'd been years since anyone had been down there.
Draco's own allegiances were currently in a scrambled mess. After his previous failed attempt at escape, Draco knew he wouldn't be able to make it much further on his own. He was tired, weak, and had lost a large amount of blood. He was no longer being fed blood restoratives and without them, the wound to his shoulder was much more serious. He needed to find some help. Muggle or Magically, he really didn't care at this point. He wouldn't have a chance to care if he succumbed to his wounds.
"The almost killed Draco." The anger had flared the moment Soren had reminded Harry that the werewolf responsible for attacking Draco was still within the castle as he had ordered.
"Fine," Ron muttered, some of the colour draining from his face at the mention of Voldemort's name. "What about his Dad? Someone would have known about him!"
Despite the undetermined state of the boys health, the world continued to move forward. Three days had passed and those within Jade Manor were starting to find themselves growing restless. The tension was palpable throughout the castle, as though the very structure was aware of what was happening within it's walls. Even Soren, himself, was finding it difficult to find that inner calm. It did not help that, even now, he was faced with the repercussions of Harry's hasty actions.
Harry grumbled, not bothering to find that familiar sense of irritation he always held for the other Elf. His mind was awake, but his body had yet to regain the same sort of energy. He couldn't remember going to sleep. He remembered the sound of Rosalind's voice, a gentle breeze, and the faint scent of oranges. Those simple memories were enough to trigger a slight ripple of other recollections; the river, blood, Draco. The moment he recalled the blond, Harry moved to push off the blankets that had been covering him. Belatedly, he realized he was wearing different clothes than he remember. Gone was the formal wear, replaced by the soft material of his casual wear. His trousers were black and pooled just slightly over his feet and the tunic covering his chest was a pale blue to rival the morning sky. His hair had been brushed and neatly pulled back into a braid; it was a braid that put to shame all the attempts Harry had made at the same thing.
Ilaria laughed, the sound freer than he'd yet heard it. It was clear that the two had known each other for a long time. Their banter was easy in a way that came from years of practice.
The very last thing Draco remembered was his Father's scream of fury and the smell of fresh grass as his abused body hit solid ground just before his tortured body finally allowed him to slip into the welcomed darkness of his mind.
All the eyes in the room that hadn't already been trained on Harry shifted now to him. He supposed he wasn't surprised by he summons. He'd disappeared from his Aunts and hadn't been in contact with anyone outside of the Kingdom since arriving here. Why he hadn't responded or reached out to them, he didn't know. He'd just been so busy trying to fill this new role and then the whole thing with Draco had taken place. Doing a quick scan of the days he'd spent there, he nearly groaned when he realized.
"Excellent," Lothair responded, joining Draco before disappearing into the room. His own enthusiasm for the room extending past his interest in the other rooms.
I'm hoping inspiration continues for a while, allowing me to put more chapters out. This has been a work in progress for a very long time, so I'd definitely like to see me put out more than I have been. Thanks to all of you for your comments. I appreciate all of your support.
"Understand this, Elf," Roland's tone was low and just as deadly as his temper, "No one is to suspect you. Gain Potter's trust, but stay under the High Lords attention. They will not be so easily fooled." No. Soren, in particular, would be able to sniff out the deceit. Potter was the flaw in the palace. He would be the one to target. "If you fail in your task, beg the High Lords for mercy as you won't find it with me."
Harry frowned slightly at that, but didn't comment. Perhaps Draco would have more in common with this society than Harry, himself, would. Purity seemed to be a big deal. "Hey Gwynn," he hedged, "can I ask you something?"
"What's up with Potter, anyway?" Pansy interrupted, glancing across the hall. "He looks different. Not so ... pauper-ish."
Coming up beside the redhead, Harry nodded in greeting, her intelligent eyes having watched his approached and not missed a single movement. "Thanks for joining us," he started, somewhat awkwardly. "I appreciate your willingness to help."
It had been two days since Harry had seen Draco. When the blond had left, Harry had laid in the courtyard for several long moments before allowing Gwen to haul him to his feet. He'd mumbled a thank you and had wandered back into the castle, leaving her to stare in concern at his retreating back. He hadn't seen her in two days either. He'd returned to his room. Stripping out of his dirt and blood stained clothes, he'd fallen onto bed and remained there until Soren disturbed his morose thoughts.
Soren did not miss the hard glint in Rosalind's eyes. He knew that should he stall, he would not be able to contain the situation. As much as he loved the woman, he knew when not to push her. "I'm sure it has not escaped any of your notice that this human is not what he seems," he started, earning the expected glower from Lothair and the curious expression from Ilaria. "Harry insists that he had no part in allowing the mortal through the wards and as he has not touched that section of his training as of yet, I'm inclined to believe him. The only other individuals who can manipulate the realms wards are sitting in this room."
The Elf across from him was large, and the muscles of his arms told Harry he could still use the weapons he'd carried as a General. Dark hair and eyes. Harry had no doubt he would make a terrible sight across the battlefield, but this wasn't a bloody battlefield and he wasn't going to cower beneath that gaze. "When I left the Wizarding world, we were in the middle of a war."
Soren nodded. "Exactly. This isn't a normal bond. I'm positive that this mortal will become Harry's consort in time. I believe the two are meant to be bound mind, body, and soul. This is why I mentioned the transfusion. Yes, I agree that the bond should, if given the opportunity, flourish on it own. However, we don't have the option of letting it take it's course. If the mortal dies now, Harry will not be able to handle the influx of power he'll receive during his coronation."
Neither, however, were the case this time. There was no memory of a dream left to linger at the peripheral of his mind. He had been comfortable, lethargic, and strangely at peace in the moments before his eyes opened. It was a peace that had him wondering the cause. He couldn't say what had made him open his eyes. All that he knew was that it was time to get up. Something was pressing at his awareness. There was something he needed to do. What that was, however, he couldn't be sure.
"A little?" Harry panted, reaching up to make sure his nose was now straight, careful not to disturb his now delicate nose.
He should feel guilty for the breach and he did, he supposed, a little. Not nearly as much as he should have, however. It was almost distant, like he could barely feel the emotion. In its place was this swirl of energy within him. Perhaps, magic wasn't the right word. His magic had never felt like this before, even when he'd lost control. It was cool and calming. It dulled the edges of his emotions. It dulled the sharpness of the pain in his chest.
"If I may interject, I would like to point out that there has been no history in Harry's family of creature blood intermingling with Wizarding. Lily was a Muggleborn and James was a Pureblood. If either of them had been a magical creature Sirius and I would have known. This isn't something that they could have kept quiet."
"It' strange," Gabriel responded, conversationally as he walked along with the rolling cloud of anger, "A certain level of aggression is to be expected with the lycanthropy but this is beyond anything I've experienced." He paused for a moment with a look of consideration, "Except Hendrik. He's a bit of a dick, to be honest. I mean, he's strong enough to protect the pack, obviously. Makes him a good leader, but his a surly dick. Though, I suppose that could just be my opinion. He'd probably lighten up more if his Beta wasn't always barking at him and just mate with him."
After blocking the third halfhearted swing of his opponent's sword, Harry stepped back with a frustrated sigh. They were supposed to be working on their defenses, but there was no point when the offence was almost non-existent. "This isn't working!" he complained, turning his glare at Ilaria.
The castle. It was both a gift and a curse. A gift because of the sanctuary it had offered him and a curse for the continued demands placed upon him for that sanctuary, demands that were starting to grow far too heavy for him to bear silently. Redemption had certainly come at a cost and he wasn't sure if he'd ever finish paying for it.
McGonagall, being who she was, didn't bother to even try and hide the skeptical snort that escaped her. "Potter," she said dryly, "asking you to hold back on the pitch is like asking you to stay out of trouble."
Soren nodded, hiding his smile as he turned. With Harry's resolve, he was sure that no matter how rocky the next few weeks were, they'd all pull through. He was certain that this was part of the overall plan. Harry could use an equal, someone to strive to do better for, someone who could push him forward more than any of the High Lords could. More importantly, he needed a connection to his old life. Harry would never fit into his role if he couldn't combine the two parts of himself into a coherent single. This mortal, no matter who or what role he had played in the past, would prove to play the most significant role yet.
At first, he didn't quite register the sound but after a moment he could clearly make out snickering before it turned into full-blown laughter. Lifting his head, his eyes widened in surprise. Two rows ahead Draco was laughing. Actually laughing. He hadn't even seen him honestly smile in weeks. His laughter seemed to set others off because a second later, everyone else had joined in ... with the exception of Zabini. He looked like he wanted to murder him. The others who'd had the misfortune of sitting close to them also did not see the humour in the situation.
Even Lothair had to struggle beneath the weight of it before he could fall back into his usual snarky persona. "The wolves have returned."
be able to keep a clear head once the ritual begins. As the magic in the room increases, you'll feel a heavy blanket settle over you. Do not panic. It's nothing out of the ordinary. Most importantly, however, you have to focus on Draco. It doesn't matter what you think about so long as he remains an equal in your thoughts. Do not place him above yourself or yourself above him. It will alter the process and the outcome will not be what was planned for. Understand?"
' was the only thing Gwynn thought as everything seemed to click into place. "I'm assuming the ritual went as expected?" she asked, curiously. There was a million questions she wanted to ask, but in the face of the ones Harry had presented to her, she held her tongue. His unimpressed look told her that he wouldn't be legitimizing her question with an answer. "I suppose so. There's no laws against such a thing. "
"As amusing as the current conversation is, we are needed in the Southern wing. I'm afraid your little get together is going to have to wait."
Taking Draco's advice, Harry promptly found his way to the infirmary with Rosalind. The woman seemed to be pleased enough that Harry had let go of his stubbornness and was allowing her to heal the wounds that should have been healed days before. Sitting on one of the beds, he remained still as she worked her magic on his face, a sense of relief hitting him when he could move his face without a sharp twinge of pain running down his jaw.
Every attempt to logically explain the situation was scattered with every cool brush against his skin. The fingertips that had been exploring the lines of his stomach had moved and become much more substantial as they dipped beneath the edge of his waistline and smooth palms rested securely on his hips, firmly holding him in place. Another low moan escaped with effortlessly as cool lips found purchase on the curve of his neck, sending a pleasant chill throughout his body. The contrasting temperatures, rather than being an inconvenience, made Harry's heart race all the more. It left him breathless and wanting more.
The frown that marred Harry's features was not the result of confusion in regards to Elven classification but, rather, the result of a question that landed a little closer to him. "Why me? Out of everyone what was I chosen?"
"We have found ourselves at a crossroad," Soren responded, showing no sign of having taken offence to having been cut off, "that leaves us reconsidering our standing with the Wizarding world."
"Now that isn't something I can do much about," she smiled, finishing up. "Perhaps you should try wooing him?"
Draco didn't have a chance to respond before a responding crash rattled the door on its hinges. Whether or not Draco had questions, they were out of time. His numb fingers could barely keep purchase on the smooth surface of the locket once Narcissa had removed her hands from his, a warm tickle of magic ghosting over his skin as he sensed the portkey within it. He vaguely recognized the locket as the one that always hung around his mother's neck, but the thought didn't hold for long before another replaced it.
It was the first words to pass from either party and Draco realized the slip a moment after the word had slipped past his lip, the irritation at himself slipping onto his face before he could control it entirely. Bloody hell, he'd clearly been spending far too much time with the Gryffindor to his left. The gits bad habits were starting to rub off on him.
The sharp command was the only thing that halted Draco's sudden move toward them. Even irate, the blond knew well enough not to test Lothair ... particularly when they didn't have Soren and Ilaria as a barrier between them.
going on, Soren?" she asked, her body language stating that she would follow even if he didn't answer her question. Her sense of duty wouldn't allow for anything else. It was her job to maintain peace within the realm and if that meant dealing with a bunch of surly Werewolves than that's what she was going to do. The Kingdom could not afford to divide it's troops between an attack from Roland and an attack from the Werewolf would be a disaster if that's what it came down to, not to mention the fact that Lothair had always had enough of an attitude to deal with. They'd never get anywhere if she allowed her temper and annoyance to rise to the level his always seemed to.
This time it was Draco who responded. "Ilaria used her magic in a steady stream. You let it build up and released it all at once."
The problem with this, however, was that Draco Malfoy was no longer enamored with the idea of following his dear Father's example. Draco had grown up idolizing the man, but with age had come a certain insight into his presumptions. As each day went by it was getting particularly difficult to recall the reasons why he'd idolized the man. For years, Draco had been lectured on what should and should not be condoned as proper Malfoy behaviour. Bowing down to another individual was certainly not condoned and Draco was just arrogant enough to believe it. Since the Dark Lord's return, Malfoy Manor had seen more then it's fair share of darkened doorways on the account of the inner circle and Draco had borne witness to the way in which Lucius Malfoy grovelled at the feet of Tom Riddle. Lucius wasn't the right hand man of the Dark Wizard, for there wasn't any respect shared between the two. One was master and one servant. Lucius was a lap dog, smearing the name of Malfoy with every breath he took. However, Lucius Malfoy was a lap dog that fully intended to place his only heir directly into the hands of Wizarding Britain's darkest individual. It was suppose to be an honour, but Draco only felt nauseated. The way Voldemort's eyes lingered whenever Draco could not escape his presence did nothing to quell his very real fears.
Since then, he'd been meeting with her every day to build up his strength. He supposed there was something to be said about falling into bed every night so exhausted that you forgot to care about anything but the pillow under his head. All he needed now was a dreamless sleep and he might just be able to forget all the things weighing on him.
As he shook hands with the Alpha, he watched Draco leave the room. As the door closed, blocking the blond from sight, Harry excused himself. Opening the door, he didn't immediately spot the blond. Hurrying down the isle, he caught up to Draco as he reached the door exiting the library, "Malfoy, wait!"
Harry shot her a grateful look and nodded his head. "With the whole inheritance thing," he shrugged, "Dumbledore thought it was prudent to take extra precaution." Of course, Dumbledore had nothing to do with the change, but he doubted Ron was going to go strolling up to Dumbledore and demand explanations. "Besides, it's not like we're not in the same classes."
Harry glanced incredulously to Lothair who just raised an eyebrow. In truth, nothing the blonde had said had been a lie. They were supposed to be keeping a low profile. When he didn't get any help from the older elf, Harry turned back to Draco with a dark look. Sometimes he really just wanted to hate him.
Hendrik took the acceptance into consideration, taking a moment to speak quietly with Theodore before straightening his back once more. "I accept your conditions, but I request three days before I send one of my own to the castle."
"Don't worry about me, Draco. I'm a Slytherin as well, don't forget that," she responded, a ghost of a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.
The magic continued to crash over him, making his own magic pulse in response until he couldn't tell whether he was in control of it or Hogwarts was and then as suddenly as it had started, it released him and he stumbled back. There were faint traces of magic in the air, but they brushed against him as though saying good-bye and then disappeared completely.
Harry hadn't expected anyone to be brave enough to interrupt Ilaria's building tirade. He had learned quickly that one of Ilaria's skills was a rather shocking ability to lecture you in such a way that left you feeling like you were roughly three inches tall. At times she had even worked a lecture into running through sword techniques. It was altogether intimidating, to say the least. To have an unfamiliar voice break through the beginning or her newest lecture had Harry's head whipping around to locate the source.

Ilaria's eyes moved from the maps to Lothair, she wasn't one to allow an individual to question her. The fact that it was Lothair doing the interrupting was the only thing keeping him from losing his ears. "Must you always question my judgement, Lothair?" She asked, annoyance clear in her tone. "The Manor overlooks the entirety of our collective lands. It rests at the Realm's highest point. Roland's forces are made up of rogue Elves, Vampires, and Lichen. With the mixture they will not attempt to scale the cliffs on the Northern and Eastern sides. The Lichen do not have the footing of the Elves. To scale would take far longer and draw more attention then they want. It would put them at a disadvantage. They will also avoid the Southern lands because it's the center of our military strength. They're not going to walk right thought base camp. Our weakest point is through the valley on the west side. It's made up entirely of civilian lands and Roland is well aware that we'll take precautions to avoid marching through the communities there."
Pausing as though to take note of the situation, he held the door open longer than he would normally in order to allow Akkar to slip inside. "Professor," he greeted, watching as the wand slowly lowered. He supposed it made sense for the man to be cautious of him.
His gaze moved to Lothair in question but he only gave a slight nod of his head. Behind him, Harry could feel most of the guards break off in various directions to secure positions around the room. Gwen remained directly behind Harry and there was another behind Draco.
Harry laid still, feeling the heavy press of unfamiliar magic surround him. It was strange to feel the press of it, but have a sense of calm settle over him as a result. By all rights, he shouldn't be calm. This was so far out of his comfort zone it was almost unimaginable. A few short weeks ago, he'd been a simple Wizard and now he was a magical creature being prepared to rule over an unfamiliar kingdom and surrounded by unfamiliar magic. By all rights, he should be terrified.
Even to his ears the attempted apology sounded feeble. He hadn't meant to offend Soren. He had wanted to make Soren feel as confused and angry as he, himself had felt. Misery obviously loved company, but it wasn't always misery it attracted.
All eyes shifted from Harry to Draco, catching a brief moment of surprise flicker in grey eyes before that all too familiar wall slammed down over his emotions. Potter's interest in him was starting to drive him crazy. He didn't understand the motivation behind it and it made him uneasy. Still, the consideration was more than he was expecting and it certainly was more than anything his Father had ever offered him.
It had been three days since he'd been in the same room with Potter. He hadn't bothered to seek out the idiot and Potter had not bothered to seek him out. Draco, for his part, hadn't dared to. He had no idea how Potter had managed it, but the brunette had been able to slip into Draco's mind easier and faster than Draco was comfortable with. Living with Voldemort wandering the halls of his home, Draco had strengthened his own mental walls. They were ironclad. Not even Voldemort had been able to pry his way in at the end. Somehow Potter had just waltzed right in as though the door was wide open.
Draco stood, ignoring the shuffling and handshaking going on in the room. He wasn't concerned with what was going on in the room. His part had been played and now he was left to go over everything that he had learned. Was he already experiencing lichen characteristics manifesting? His thoughts drifted to the fight he'd had with Potter. Had these characteristics influenced him? Or was that just an excuse he was going to use?
Harry turned to glance at Ron and raised an eyebrow in question. Ron, for his part, just shrugged and said. "I think overestimating our interest in our education helps her refrain from murdering us in our sleep."
"I would like to, however, speak with Professor Snape regarding my return. He is my Head of House, after all."
The blank look on Ron's face was all that was needed to tell Hermione exactly what she needed to know. Ron had no idea what he was doing. Settling back into her chair, Hermione picked up her book and continued where she had left of. Dumbledore had said Harry would return and she believed him.
"Alright, ladies," Ilaria called, the amusement still lingering in her tone. "Back in line. I think we've had enough hand-to-hand for one day."
"Gwen," the blonde scoffed, the word falling off his lips like it was the most vial thing he'd ever spoken. "Did you bind her to you as well? Did you go behind her back or am I just special?"
"Shut up," Harry mumbled, flipping over onto his back and staring up at the night sky above him. It wasn't that he hadn't improved. He had. He could hold his own, even against Gwen, but right now there were too many things on his mind to fully concentrate on maintaining his stance, let alone, trying to read Gwen's movements. It was precisely why he hadn't wanted to train to begin with. Gwen had insisted that it would take his mind off of things for a while, but he had remained doubtful. For good reason, it would seem. His thoughts weren't in that courtyard. His thoughts had remained several floors above him.
Hermione frowned even as she reached out a hand to take the paper Ron was waving around. Harry's presence hadn't been the only one missing these past two weeks. The Slytherin ring leader had also been surprisingly absent. Pansy had made a huge deal about it at the feast and continued to point out how miserable she was over it.
Another pulse in his left hand and Draco moved instinctively, flipping his sword around and driving it into the ground at his feet. The magic that had built up inside of him flowed through the sword and into the earth below, freezing the ground beneath them. Potter's feet slid beneath him as he tried to find purchase, slowing him down and that was all Draco needed. Stepping around his sword, he swung his foot up and landed a kick to Harry's side that sent him rolling away.
Harry's head snapped up as his eyes immediately searched out the figure of Soren. The instant he spotted Soren's much smaller mate coming through the door behind him, Harry forgotten all about Lothair and his poor attitude. At the moment he was insignificant and would remain so. All Harry cared about was seeing Draco and making sure that the Slytherin continued to breath. Despite his desire to press the matter, he knew better than to go rushing forward. He stayed where he was, his body taunt as he waited for the okay. There were muscles tensing that Harry hadn't even known he possessed and all of them were hell bent on finding their way to the Manor's new ward. It seemed like ages before Rosalind's soft smile told him what he'd been waiting to hear. Draco was alive. It only took half a second for his body to move after that, the tension in his muscles turning to energy and pushing him forward until he disappeared through the doorway. He let the heavy door swing shut behind him and didn't bother a glance back..
Draco hesitated for another moment before giving up his struggles entirely, slumping forward against the pull of his confinement. There really was no point in fighting it any longer. Either Snape could be trusted as his mother had suggested or he wasn't. If Severus weren't to be trusted then he'd be in no worse position then what he was already facing. The fact that the man wasn't causing him any further pain was something to consider and a small flicker of hope began to grow in his chest.
I know. I'm terrible at this updating thing. In reality I haven't had anything pressing going on in the last year, so it's really been only laziness preventing me from going ahead and continuing with this story. I can say that I'm going to try harder to get this story going again, but I won't make any promises. Creativity comes in it's own time...granted, I started this story in 2007...so I think it's about time I finish it. I don't want it to be one of those things I'm still working on when I'm grey haired.
With Harry's back to him, Draco took the moment to study the brunette. He was wearing casual clothes, much like Draco's own but in shades of green rather than blue and his hair was free of its usual braid. It was longer than Draco had expected. Somehow, with it braided back into it's usual braid he hadn't noticed. The light wind blowing through the courtyard ruffled the ends but Harry didn't seem to notice.
Malfoy had made up his own mind, regardless of how it had affected those around him. Harry had risked even more than he'd known in order to save the blond and the Slytherin didn't hold a single consideration for his own life. His place here didn't matter. His life didn't matter. Harry didn't matter and that was fine. He hadn't mattered before. He knew how to be someone who didn't matter. Draco, on the other hand, did matter so Harry would keep them both alive for as long as he could.
Gwynn's eyebrows had risen to meet her hairline for the duration of the entire exchange. She'd often wondered how Harry would manage to rule their Kingdom. However, those fears were beginning to fade the longer she watched him. She'd never seen anything but a friendly smile or a slight look of annoyance and frustration on his face. His features now contained a fierce determination and around his eyes she could see the worry that had taken such a strong hold of him. When he'd spoken his voice was low, authoritative, and held absolutely no room for argument. There was the presence of a ruler within him, but Gwynn wondered if Harry would be willing to embrace this new found side of him.
As Harry studied the sword in his hand, Daemeon moved around Harry with watchful eyes as the younger Elf got a feel for the weapon. His eyes followed the sweeping motions as Harry tested it.
His fists clenched at his sides, his eyes hardening in the mirror. His eyes. So changed now from the grey of his Father's bloodline. He was half grateful for the green flecks that now tarnished them. It set him further apart from the man who had sired him.
A good ten steps behind the brooding Gryffindor, Draco was rather pleased with himself for not only managing to get what he wanted, but also irritating Potter in the process. Was only fair, really. Potter had spent years irritating him. It was high time for a little payback, wasn't it? "You know," he started, a slow smirk settling on his features, "If you only had billowing robes, you'd look just like Professor Snape."
His hair had been another matter. The moment he'd been permitted to address it, he had begged to have it cut. He had never been a fan of the long locks his Father had always preferred and the previous state of his hair was far beyond acceptable. Despite having been informed that many of the Elves in the realm preferred to keep their hair long, bound back within a braid, Draco had still insisted on having it cut. Whether or not he'd suddenly become one of them, he was not feeling generous enough to condone such an appearance. Only with the repeated assurance from the blond had Rosalind agreed to assist him. He had felt nothing as the long lengths had been snipped away until gradually, it began to resemblance some form of semblance. Guiding her actions as only he could, Draco instructed her on how to cut it; short and clean cut at the nap of his neck and around his ears, before gradually lengthening as it moved forward. His hair laid neatly at the back of his head as it had once done, before he took some liberty with the front and let the soft locks be angled forward, leaving them long enough to obscure his eyes as he bowed his head.
For a brief moment, Harry had an image of the Hogwarts Greenhouses flash through his mind. He could almost smell the fresh soil, see Neville's pleased smile as Madam Sprout praised him, see Ron poking their newest assignment with the end of his wand while Hermione scolded him. With it came a certain sense of loneliness. He missed Hogwarts. He missed his friends. Then, as quickly as it had come, the feeling disappeared and a warm hand rested on his arm. Opening his eyes, unaware when he'd even closed them, he found Rosalind standing beside him with a questioning look in her eyes. She didn't need to vocalize the question for Harry already knew what she was asking. "I'm ready."
Ignoring the almost painful desire burning within his overly warm body, Harry put all of his focus on discovering that name. He needed to know who it was. He needed to say it. Harry wasn't entirely sure why, but he did know that only the name was important. His lips parted in a hopeful attempt to let the name slide off of his tongue but the sound that escaped him was not what he expected.
Steeling himself, Harry moved to take the seat beside Zabini, while Hermione moved to sit beside one of the girls whose name Harry couldn't remember. He'd never really had any altercations with Zabini, but the intense stare he was receiving put him on edge and he couldn't quite contain the urge to shift his chair further away from him as he sat down.
He froze, his breath stilling as the words washed over him. Draco had barely heard the sound of it beneath the ringing in his ears. Had it not been for Harry's lips moving, he would have sworn the man beneath him hadn't spoken at all.
He turned his head to glance at Gwynn. " Make them take an oath so they can't speak of this to anyone and send them on their way."
"Of course not," he responded, rolling his eyes as he pushed open the door and led them in. He could hear Myrtle moaning away, but it sounded different and he guessed she was hanging out in the u-bend again. Moving to the sink, he glanced back at both Lothair and Draco before reaching underneath the sink to find the etching of a snake in the pipe. He hadn't thought of this place since the second year and, after everything that had happened, he hadn't been sure it'd still be there.
Spotting them, Lothair reigned in the others. "Let's move. We have half a days ride before we reach the western border," he barked, urging his own horse forward to lead the way out of the yard and leaving Harry to catch up to him. He supposed he was supposed to stay in the ridiculous formation they'd been instructed on earlier, but he brushed that aside.
"As attractive as you are at the moment, I am afraid that there simply isn't enough room for two of me," Ilaria laughed, the sound ringing beautifully around them as a smirk tugged at the corner of her mouth. Raising a hand, she touched his forehead. The simple action caused Harry a slow moment of fascination. He could feel the spell unravel around him, loosening its hold on him before slipping too the floor. As intricate as the spells had seemed when they were being cast, he was surprised to see how easily they fell away. Gone were the blue eyes, the multicolored hair, and the clothing. During the trip he hadn't noticed how strange it felt to be in the clothes of another individual, but now that he was back into his own the difference could no longer be ignored. He was suddenly much more comfortable.
"The death of James and Lily Potter is nothing to be mocked, Mr. Malfoy. Would you not want to avenge your Mother's death should you find yourself in Harry's position?"
Harry wasn't entirely pleased with his response, but the tension seemed to drain out of him anyway. Turning back around, he moved to pick up Draco's unconscious form. Prior to Harry's inheritance, Draco had always been much taller then the brunette, albeit of a slightly smaller build. Now, given the changes Harry had undergone, he didn't have any trouble at all lifting Draco. One arm slid beneath Draco's knees, the other positioned as best he could to avoid the bloodied wounds on the blond's back. It was those wounds that worried Harry the most. He hadn't seen the wolf bite Draco, but that didn't mean he hadn't. Whether or not he'd been bit, there were still going to be repercussions for the wounds.
It was clear, looking across the table to the burly Hungarian, that he was not entirely appeased by the situation. The stress of his position and the knowledge of possible outcomes of his seconds actions weighed heavily on him. This realm belonged to the Elves, the presence of the Wolves was based on the alliance between the two races. At one time, there had been a variety of magical races residing in the area, but as time had passed, they had drifted away. The Fae had left silently in the night while the Vampires had been cast out and isolated to their own territories. The wolves were all that remained. This coexistence between the Elves and the Wolves was crucial to both sides. The Wolves were protected here, away from the fear and violence of men. To be pushed outside of the boundaries would be devastating to their race and Hendrik was well aware of that. The pressure of keeping their pack safe and the full knowledge of what had taken place a few days prior was enough to keep him in his seat, as obedient as any Alpha could be.
"He comes with us!" Harry growled, his narrowed eyes moving to pin Soren with a look that clearly stated any arguments would not be tolerated. With a sigh, Soren took a step back and nodded.
Draco had disappeared into the room across the hall from him and didn't respond. Pulling himself away from the windows, Harry moved across the hall to see what Draco had found. To his surprise the room was done in a more earthy tone; deep browns and cream. He would have expected him to choose something flashier, but Draco seemed content to make himself home.
Draco watched, dumbfounded, as Narcissa Malfoy slipped into his room and warded the door against entry. He wasn't familiar with the spell, but he could see the door shake as the spell settled into the heavy wood. It would hold it's own against forced entry but it wouldn't last forever. With that done, she immediately began moving about the room, picking up a collection of his belongings and placing them inside the bag he hadn't realized she was carrying. Had he been paying attention to which items she'd picked up, he would have realized what she was intending.
Draco hadn't been expecting to be called to any meetings. In fact, he'd expected to be left alone or tossed into some cell after beating the snot out of their
"I never said you weren't good enough," Hermione interjected, her annoyance evident, "I merely stated that outside of Harry we don't have any interests that are remotely similar."
After another moment, the door swung open to reveal the Elf in question. As per usual, he didn't look all that impressed to find Harry standing outside his door. On the other hand, he didn't look all that surprised either. "Finally come to explain yourself, then?" he drawled, arms crossed.
Harry shot the blond a look. He seemed intent on fighting and a part of him was concerned about what Draco was going to do once he returned to the Wizarding world. If he acted before Harry was ready, all hell was going to break loose. There was a part of Draco's mind that was darker than he let on. Harry didn't know how deep it went but he didn't need to be a Seer to know it could be a problem. There was a part of Harry that didn't want Lothair to teach them anything just yet. The larger part of him, however, argued that the stronger they became the harder it would be to kill them. Draco, in particular.
At that, Severus' thoughts shifted to another. Narcissa Malfoy. He hadn't seen nor heard from her since her attempt to save her son. Fresh pain stabbed through him. It was another woman he'd been unable to protect. First Lily and now Narcissa. He'd known Lucius long enough to know he would not forgive her transgression. He'd already discretely searched the Malfoy Dungeons but had found no sign of her. If she was still alive, he wasn't keeping her there. He wanted to hope for her survival but he was starting to lose faith. The longer Lucius had her in his crazed grip, the less chance she had of seeing another day. All of his reasons for his double life were being stripped away from him and a part of him feared he was going to once again face the decision he'd made years ago. It was the light or darkness. He wasn't naive enough to believe in the shades of grey anymore.
Harry glanced up. He'd vaguely heard the others leaving the room from somewhere in the back of his mind, but Draco's voice seemed to cut through the darkness he was exploring like a knife, drawing Harry's attention to him. The blond stood across the table from him, eyes hard and arms crossed over his chest.
Harry's eyes shot back to the blond at that statement. He'd always been so proud of being a Malfoy that it was surreal to hear him talk of his home with such disdain, even knowing a small portion of what had occurred over the summer. "I don't think that's-"
It did not, however, stop the entire student body from gawking at them and Harry could feel the flush creeping up his neck like a warm blanket. His eyes shifted to Draco and the idiot was practically preening beneath all the attention, earning him a dark glare from Harry. He must have felt it burrowing into the back of his head because he turned to look at him, an eyebrow raised with that all too familiar, haughty attitude.
All eyes turned to Lothair in surprise, earning an irritated sneer from the Elf. Always with the surprise.
Some sort of god of protection was looking out for this idiot, Draco was certain of it, because otherwise someone would have killed him already. Draco was pretty close to it now and the only thing keeping him from doing that was the fact that there was an entire pack of wolves ready to tear his throat out if he did. "You're an idiot," was all he said as he turned and continued to stalk down the hallway.
His eyes lifted, narrowing as recognition registered. Potter. Even with the smoother tone, Draco would know that voice anywhere. How many times had he heard it? How many times had it incited his anger? Already that cord of irritation was threatening to wrap around him, joining and fusing with the anger already boiling within him. The last person he wanted to see was Potter, but his steps led me on, closer and closer.
"To be honest, I'm not sure," she admitted, a slight frown on her features. "There could be several reasons. I did find traces of potions in his system, Wizarding variations for the most part, but there were a few that I didn't recognize. One of them may be preventing him from healing, but from what I can tell, the majority of the ones used were to keep the young man alive. Another possibility," she continued, turning her eyes away from Draco's prone form, "is that his body simply doesn't have the strength to do what's needed. He has been through a lot and it wasn't just the Werewolves that harmed him. There were lesions on each of his wrists that signify that he'd been restrained. There was also a large wound where he had almost all of the muscle detached from his shoulder joint. The cut was far too clean to be caused by a set of claws. I cannot say for sure, but I'm almost positive it was an intentional wound. The angle would have been one in a million if it had been an accident."
"And how do you plan to locate the Elven realm? Similar to the Fair Folk, their realm is not exactly located on the same plane of existence as ours."
. He wanted freedom. He wanted the freedom to make his own decision. He wanted the freedom to be the author of his own tale. Even with his misgivings and the worries that constantly plagued his mind, Harry had a strong sense of elation when he considered what he was doing. If he could pull this off, he'd be able to build what he wanted in his life. Although, he supposed it was a very large if.
"I wasn't playing house! We were just training!" he exclaimed, trying to calm Draco down. The accusation that he'd ruined Draco's life had hit him hard, leaving him with a strange numbness spreading through him. It really shouldn't have bothered him. He knew Draco was going to be angry. He knew the other man wasn't going to like having the choice taken from him. It had been Harry's decision and he'd willing robbed the other man of the choice. He deserved the anger, which was the very reason that he didn't raise a hand to prevent the second punch Draco landed.
Harry felt slightly sick as she continued to talk. He could feel that strange protectiveness churning beneath the surface of his skin, waiting for him to embrace it. What could possibly have happened to him before the wolves? More importantly, what had happened to him that had caused him to appear where he had? And why had he been immediately able to sense Draco's location? "What happens if the wounds don't heal?" he asked, his voice rough in an attempt to keep himself calm and detached. It was easier to deal with the entire situation if he didn't care … or at least cared less; something that was far easier said than done. There were too many questions and worries moving through him to do much else. "Is he a werewolf?"
Dumbledore was silent for a moment and Harry thought he might have seen the brightest flicker in the old man's eyes, but it was gone before he could be sure. "I don't understand the problem."
Harry was about to protest when Soren's eyes turned to him. "He is right, Harry. You may not make changes to Elven law without a council taking place," Soren informed him, his eyes moving from Harry's to the individual he held in his arms. "And the stabilization spells will not last forever. Your human needs medical attention."
This whole place was strange and he had yet to get used to the difference. Everything here seemed to run off the natural energy of the realm itself. All the water that flowed into the Manor came from streams and rivers that ran through the land. Even in this room, the water flowed into a small pool at the center of the room before draining out. The entire Manor was built like this, as thought they had built it around nature rather than over top of it. He'd found the greenhouses the other day, but they had not been like any greenhouse he had ever seen. They were a part of the castle, but the entire floor was earth and the vegetation grew directly out of that soil. The walls were made entirely of glass as though giant sheets had been molded around the pillars. His mother would have loved it.
Soren's eyes rose to meet Lothair's as the Elf stepped out of a long shadow cast by one of the many shelves of books. He could not say that Lothair was completely wrong. Clearly something needed to be altered before they could continue. "Call for Ilaria," he sighed, feeling far older than he had in a very long time.
"It's not going to open its great mouth and start talking to you, you fool," he responded, rolling his eyes, "connect to the magic."
"It is our will that creates the difference between us. Free will and the potion of choice cause it. We were all created with the ability to make our own decision. Some, like us, have chosen to remember the Mother. Others, like the Wizarding population, have fallen away from the truth. Wizarding kind has created their own sense of reality in the form of their religions and social practices, but even in these varying religions the dominating gods are all representations of the Mother. They all possess the same abilities and while they not remember the truth, what they create does not stray far from it. It is ingrained in all of us."
Rolling his eyes, he glanced back to Harry who seemed to be frozen in place. His shoulders had relaxed and he seemed to be leaning into Draco's hand. The weight in his own chest had lessened, but the reaction Potter was having was much stronger than his own. Interesting. "Tell them to back down," he commented, tapping his finger against Harry's chest to get his attention.
"Hogwarts," he muttered. Classes had started a week ago. No wonder the Order was banging down his door. Glancing back up, he found Draco looking less than surprised by the news, which sent a flash of irritation through him. "You could have said something," he accused, shooting him a glare.
Lothair rolled his eyes at the question. "This castle isn't simple magic. There are centuries of magic layered on top of each other and it's not just human magic. In order to change the structure of this place, you're going to have to tap into the core of the magic. Rearranging an entire area at the base of the castle isn't as easy as changing the paint colour."
"Fine," he responded, dropping the reigns and swinging himself onto Erebus' back, completely unconcerned with the fact that he'd never before ridden bareback. As though Erebus sensed his impatience the creature shifted powerfully beneath him, his heavy hooves pounding the earth. "Then stay here."
Lothair snorted and helped him up. "She was just saying hello," he commented, pushing him back toward the state. "Try again."
Hermione just snorted and glanced at Neville who turned a bit pink about the ears. "Sorry, Harry," he muttered, looking more apologetic than Harry really thought he needed to be. "She asked how the class had gone."
Soren sighed, glancing up from the book in his lap to pin Lothair with an irritated look. "What, pray tell, are you complaining about this time?" Lothair had seemed to be in a terrible mood for days now and, if Soren was being honest, he wasn't entirely sure which one of them the other Elf was currently enraged over.
"Perhaps they wouldn't be inclined to skip them if you didn't insist on making them look like fools," Lothair responded, an almost warm tone to his voice. It was a tone that Harry had not heard coming from the rigid Elf. It sounded a bit odd.
Gwynn's eyebrow rose at the vehement denial. "So, you're binding yourself to a complete enemy that you're not attracted to," she hesitated, for a moment before rolling her eyes. "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard."
As one might have expected, Ilaria hadn't taken it easy on him. They'd started with hand-to-hand combat, quickly moving on to weapon handling. Harry, much to his delight, had discovered how much his new senses helped him. His movements were quicker, his hearing picked up the smallest sounds, his eyesight narrowed to pick up the most minuscule of movements, and even his breathing calmed. He had the distinct impression that, in the heat of battle, it would be extremely difficult to sneak up on him. Unfortunately, for as improved as his senses were, they simply couldn't compare to the refined skills of the Realms Lady of the Southern Lands.
"B-but, My Lord, this is Lady Ilaria's horse," the poor Elf responded, shifting a very nervous glance between Harry and Gwynn. "Nyx is not to be ridden by any other individual."
Groaning, he twisted his legs around until his feet hit the floor, elbows finding his knees as he rested his head in his hands. He really didn't need new nightmares. He had enough of his own without experiencing other people's. Even that didn't make sense, however. If he was, somehow, slipping into another person's mind how would he even be accomplishing it? It wasn't an ability associated with the Elves and it certainly wasn't something he'd picked up from the wolves. It couldn't be Legilimency. He would have needed to make eye contact with the person in question and he was proficient when it came to Occlumency so it was unlikely someone was manipulating him into seeing these images.
The part of Harry that had grown up as a Muggle felt disgusted at the thought of his open wound being pressed to that of another. Diseases and germs were best passed in such a manner, but the larger part of him was more concerned with the process that was still to come. Nothing that needed four well trained and powerful elves to perform was simple. With every bit of magic used came a possible consequence and Harry couldn't' say one way or another that said consequence wasn't going to cause further problems for them both.
"Oh? So Malfoys sneak into peoples rooms in the middle of the night?" Harry really had no idea what was going on. After Draco had told him to go and heal his face, the two of them hadn't really interacted outside of the lessons that Soren was now making them take together. Harry had been giving the other man his space since he still seemed quite on edge.
For a moment, Soren only smiled, an amused twinkle in his eye. It was a smile that told of things left unsaid and, for Ilaria who had always loved a bit of mischief, it sent a thrill of excitement through her. "All we can do is point them in the proper direction."
Soren really could not argue with the negative outlook of recent events, even though he knew that their discussions had been put on hold due to unforeseen circumstances. Harry did not have to be present for the decision to be made regarding the fate of the Wolves within residence, but Soren was loath to continue without his involvement. It would do little to build his confidence, and more to incite his , despite being misguided, had used his authority within the realm to bring those who harmed his mate to justice. Whether or not he realized that Draco was his mate, was neither here nor there. As an Elf, he was well within his rights to demand punishment. Harry's political position only complicated the matter further.
Hey guys. It's been a while. I know I keep apologizing for it, but I'm sorry. I started this story when I was in my first year of University ... which was literally 12 years ago now ... Merlin, I'm old. Needless to say, since then my life got busy with adulting and what not, and I am a much different person than I was when I started this story. That being said, I just spent the last couple days reading the first thirteen chapters and I REALLY like this storyline. It is MUCH more interesting than I remembered it to be and I'd like to continue with it. I will be going back over the previous chapters and cleaning it up. This will only be spelling errors and such. No major changes will be made so (unless you want to) you won't have to go back and read it over.
"If what that letter states is true than Harry is no longer a Wizard. He is a magical creature and the law will treat him as such. No matter how we may disagree, Harry is no longer bound by either our legal or educational systems."
"Of course, not, Lothair," Soren sighed, growing rather tired with the younger Elf's continued tantrums. He might have the long life of the Elves, but he was certainly getting too old to deal with a bunch of children. "I'm not saying anything of the sort. Though none of us actively assisted him, the mortal still managed to enter into the realm. There is only Harry and yourself, Lothair, who have not bonded. As I doubt that you are interested in the mortal, I'm going to assume that Harry's connection to this mortal was what saved him from being destroyed by the wards. There is already a bond between the Dark Prince and his mortal. Harry assumes it is a rivalry, but that alone would not have saved him. It is something much more than a petty childhood rivalry. There is no other explanation."
This did nothing to impress upon Harry the seriousness of the situation. It only caused him to laugh all the harder. Infuriated by the amusement he found at her plight, Gwynn growled and jumped toward him, knocking him back beneath the water with a startled cry. For a moment, they struggled, Harry attempting to push Gwynn away while Gwynn tried to hold his head under the surface of the water for longer than Harry would have liked.
"Another one of her stories, I expect." The third Elf added, smirking from his relaxed position against one of the stone columns located around the edge of the courtyard. "Perhaps she made it while she was spying on the rouge Elves?"
"Because I need to find my way around this monstrosity and you're going to bloody well help me do it!"
"And you're sure that the disturbance is moving to surround?" Ilaria asked, leaning over the map spread out over the table and considering the options available to them. Covering the map were small pins, a collection of colours dotting the surface and each one having it's own representation.
Harry braced himself for Gwynn's next attack. After blocking the quick movement, Harry followed with a quick tiao cut to clear the center space between them. Ducking her return swipe, Harry used the hilt of his sword to jar her outstretched elbow, resulting in a jerked movement of her arm and a loosening of her hold. Before she had a chance to react, Harry stood, twisting his sword sharply to connect firmly with Gwynn's and successfully dislodging it from her grasp. With the sound of the heavy weapon hitting the floor, Harry felt a bit of pride swelling in his chest. What he didn't count on, however, was Gwynn's quick recovery.
Grey eyes narrowed dangerously at that slight and a hand instantly reached for his wand. Not finding it at his hip where he normally carried it, Draco growled his frustration and grabbed the first thing he could reach. This happened to be the pitcher of water on the nightstand and, in a moment of anger, he threw it at Harry's bloody irritating face. He watched it sail through the air and felt a brief moment of glee when he realized it would hit it's target before the glass froze mid air, half a foot from Potter's face. While the momentum of the pitcher froze, the water had not, splashing out of the container and soaking Harry from head to toe.
If he wasn't so intent of disliking Potter just then, he'd have found the uncontrolled mess of hair and the wide, startled eyes rather entertaining. Hell, he might have even laughed. As it were, however, he wasn't entirely ready to let go of his irritation toward the Gryffindor. "What does it look like I'm doing?"
If he had expected Potter to stay down, that wasn't what he got. Potter was instantly up even though Draco knew he'd be feeling that kick for days. Barely managing to draw his sword up to block Potter's next attack, he used his shoulder to further stabilize his blade and push Potter back. Potter seemed hell bent on attacking and Draco realized the brunette was solely focused on the fight. He doubted the idiot even felt the pain in his ribs or the growing strain on their bodies.
"How do you even know about his plans, anyway?" Harry asked, a deep frown on his face at the not so hidden reprimand. "I barely even know the full extent of what's going on and I'm the one he wants to strangle the life out of." Harry dutifully ignored the very obvious similarity to his situation with Voldemort. Apparently, being kept up to date was a little too much to ask for in either realm.
"I'm not playing quidditch," Draco responded, "I'm sitting here recounting your epic failure for those who missed it today."
Taking a deep breath, Draco shifted his anger to the back of his mind. He would not release it or let it dwindle. It would be what drove him forward until he stood in front of his Father once more. Whether it be in this world or the next, Lucius would stand and face what he'd done.
Harry sighed, giving his tie another tug in an attempt to straighten it out as they hurried through the dungeons toward the Potions class. "I know, I know," Harry responded, already flustered with having started the day out late. "I'm sorry, but Dumbledore called us to his office and I didn't know I wouldn't be staying in the dorms."
Motioning Harry to follow him, Soren guided him toward the far end of the wing and away from the mortal who seemed to attract Harry's attention with relative ease. Once they were out of earshot, Soren turned back to study Harry intently. "You're afraid."
Ignoring the warning, Harry stood and headed for the door. Behind him Hermione sighed and he could hear the scrapping of chairs against the floor as she and Ron stood to follow him. He wasn't concerned about whether or not they followed. He was just as content if they did as he was if they didn't.
In his left hand, his sword seemed to pulse, drawing the magic toward it. It was hungry. That was the only thing Draco could think. The sword
After the fifth time of having to turn around and fetch him from whatever had captured his attention, Ilaria grabbed him by the back of the neck and pushed him along ahead of her. "By the mother, you're worse than an infant," she grumbled, earning amused chuckles from those within hearing distance.
Draco frowned. That didn't necessarily mean that she wasn't there. On the other hand, there were a handful of other properties the Malfoy's owned that he could be keeping her. In the end, the information didn't put him any closer to finding her.
There was a brief flash of irritation that ran through him at the very obvious difference between his own rooms and these before he moved forward. Furthermore, he hadn't entirely been looking forward to a game of hide and seek. Perhaps the git didn't have to lock the door? Maybe the intention was to allow the intruder to find themselves far too irritated to bother once they'd finally managed to find what they were looking for. Opening the first door, Draco glanced in, raising an eyebrow in surprise when he found a smaller version of the Manor's main library. There were rows and rows of books lining the walls and several smaller shelves standing in the center of the room. Rather than the large tables in the library, this room held only plush armchairs tastefully placed around the room. Rather than any sort of work space, it seemed as though this particular collection was more for personal enjoyment than education. Snorting, he closed the door without looking at any of the titles, sure that the room was completely wasted on it's owner.
"The lot of you can eat right along with everyone else next time!" Sheedra commented, shooting them one last glare before returning to whatever work she'd been doing when they had interrupted her.
The fact that she hadn't already tried to sneak a peak was rather impressive, Draco thought. She didn't exactly come across as a patient individual. To his left, Potter held both hands out so his own box could settle on his palms. Turning his attention back to the box hovering in front of him, Draco reached out for it. He'd almost forgotten about the brief trip he'd taken to the swordsmith. It had barely lasted a full five minutes. Daemon had taken a good look at him and proclaimed he already knew what Draco had needed. Hell, he hadn't even picked up a sword. He'd pointed that out to Ilaria when they had left, but she'd only told him to trust the master. He supposed now they would see whether or not that trust had been ill-placed.
"If I relocate this particular individual, it'll solve Draco's problem and draw Voldemort's attention at the same time." Harry hedged. It wasn't that he didn't trust Lothair with the full story but, with everything that was happening, it was better if as few people as possible knew his intentions.
"We will do as Ilaria suggested, but rather than rousing just the three outposts we will also extend envoys to two of the smaller sections. If word reached Roland of our plans, he will not expecting the increase. A single grain of rice can tip the scale and I fully intend to tip it in our favour."
It was at least a relief to know that they did not simply assume that Potter was useful. They at least had the sense to wait and see if he could actually measure up to the standards they needed; something that Draco was still unconvinced off. Potter was not a symbol of hope. He was bloody chaos in everything from his hair to his personality. These thoughts, however, were waylaid as she drew his attention back to the memories of the Werewolves. He'd been terrified when he'd seen the markings, instantly thinking that he'd been affected with lycanthropy and forever doomed to that lifestyle only to find his resolve shaken again when he'd looked closer. He could remember the scars on Greyback's victims. He'd seen them as they'd turned, locked away in the depths of the Dungeons buried beneath Malfoy Manor. These were not the same marking. Those had been bloody and ugly,the skin torn and jagged as it had attempted to mend. These were smooth, barely there.
Gwynn held his eyes for a long, meaningful moment before she responded, "Which makes him the first human to have done so in over two centuries." The meaning behind those words lingered in the air. Something was changing and neither one of them were sure whether or not it would be a change for the better.
The ride back to the Manor had been tense and silent. None of the High Lords had bothered to address him about what he'd been thinking when he had agreed to return to Hogwarts. Draco knew that they had heard his hushed conversation with Severus and, yet, they hadn't asked about that or what he'd been trying to accomplish. It didn't sit well with him. Draco wasn't naive enough to think that they weren't well aware of what going back was going to mean. If the dirty looks Lothair kept shooting him were any indication, he knew the Elf was showing some hard earned restraint.
Beside him, Draco felt Harry tense, but not a sound escaped the brunette and he wasn't entirely sure that was a good sign.
"What about our magical abilities?" he asked, raising an eyebrow. "Our magical signatures have grown drastically. We can't exactly hide that."
"If you're going to bother hiding your footsteps you might want to make sure I can't hear your heart beating."
There were times when Severus Snape deeply regretted the choices he'd made in his life. He regretted having lost his friendship with Lily Evans. He regretted not having been strong enough to refuse the Dark Lord. Lately, however, his regrets had started to shift. He didn't regret any of the good he'd done because of his choices, but he he was starting to regret falling under the control of Albus Dumbledore. There really was little difference between Dumbledore and the Dark Lord. Both expected him to perform on command. Voldemort, at least, didn't bother trying to hide his intentions behind soft words of encouragement and hope. With the Dark Lord what you saw was what you got. Albus Dumbledore had more faces than any one person could keep track of. It was enough to drive a sane man around the bend. Thankfully, Severus had never really fit the roll of a sane man.
"Malfoy Manor has a plethora of information," Draco responded, unaware of Harry's current thoughts. "Once the problem with Voldemort is solved, you can do with it what you will. Use it, sell it, burn the whole thing to the ground for all I care."
Draco closed his eyes. Potter was sorry? Well, he was sorry too. He was sorry about a lot of things but being sorry wasn't going to change anything. It was completely pointless. Shaking his head, he spared a brief glance over his should as he pushed the door open. "Go heal your face, idiot."
With a final glare at the three wolves, Harry turned and made his way to where Erebus was waiting for him, Draco still held protectively in his arms. Placing Draco up on Erebus' back first, Harry swung up afterwards. After making sure his hold on Draco wouldn't allow him to fall, Harry turned Erebus around and immediately headed back toward the manor. Soren had stated the stabilization spells wouldn't last forever and Harry wasn't taking his chances.
"Well done," Ilaria was amused. The sound of her voice made that very clear. "Very well done, both of you."
"Gah," he gasped, jerking backwards and away from the unexpected site of the intimidating blond. "What the hell are you doing?"
"Not necessarily," Rosalind laughed, seeing the concern in Harry's eyes. "It doesn't mean we're replacing you with Draco. Ultimately the two of you will act as one. When it comes to ruling the realm, it doesn't matter which one of you are the dominant."
Draco cast a glance back to Harry's prone form. Saeya had taken up a spot at the end of the table to keep watch, which didn't really put him at ease. Regardless, he turned and followed Lothair back out into the main room. In the middle of the room stood the rest of the group, Elves surrounding them. All of them were pale-faced and tears were streaming down Granger's face. When she spotted Draco, she took a step forward but halted when Gwynn lifted her sword and held her in place.
When Harry moved next it was to unfurl himself from the cross-legged position he'd been sitting in. Standing, he dropped down from the pillar. "
Harry didn't bother wondering about how Draco knew his schedule, he was much too dismayed that he would have to face off against Snape first thing in the morning when he was already two weeks behind schedule.
There was a particular sense of surprise in the room as the sliding of chairs and shuffling of bodies filled the air. Never before had the High Lords requested a strict audience. During the years without a ruler all decisions had been made by means of the group. By the looks and muttering of some members he knew that many did not like the sudden change, but Soren wasn't going to risk the safety of the realm simply because certain individuals believed that they should be included. Once the door had been firmly sealed behind the last elf, a strong locking and privacy spell fell into place. Outside of those in the room, no one was to be aware of what their decision would be.
"A wizarding war with myself at the center," Harry continued, his tone perhaps a little more clipped than he had intended. It was getting harder and harder to control his emotions. The broken bond within him was still screaming at him to acknowledge it and the lack of interest that Aranel was showing was pressing at the edges of those thoughts that lingered on those he cared about outside of the realm. "I am the target."
The dagger was back in Lucius' hands when the other man returned to his spot in front of Draco. "You see," he smirked, trailing the edge of the blade across Draco's cheek, easily splitting the skin and drawing a low hiss from between Draco's lips. "We have plenty of time to discover your limitations, Draco."
"Did you yell at her?" he asked, forcing a serious look onto his face. Of course, the scowl he received from Ron had his feigned seriousness falling apart rapidly.
Of course, with the way Ron was shovelling food into his mouth, it was hard to tell he was anything but devastatingly hungry. Having decided that he wasn't going to tell the redhead about the piece of chicken stuck in his teeth, Harry's eyes shifted across the hall to the familiar head of blonde hair.
"Are you finished with your pissing contest?" Lothair asked, dryly. Frankly, he didn't care what the idiots looked like so long as they looked human.
"Do you feel that?" he asked, his voice hushed as though if he spoke too loud it would cause the energy to explode.
Glancing away from each other, murder still flashing in their eyes, they found the only person such sarcasm could belong to besides, Draco, himself. Lothair stood, arms crossed and looking at them with about as much disdain as Harry was currently feeling toward both of the elves currently occupying the same piece of corridor he was.
"You don't have to cast any magic. The magic that's linked to this place will do the recreation," Gwynn commented from behind him. "You said this "room of requirements" restructures to whatever you need, right? It's sort of the same thing."
"Absolutely not," the woman was saying, shooting the younger Elf an unwavering look, "I'll not have you putting me behind in my work simply because you can't eat at your own home."
Masking the sound of his footsteps, Draco moved closer. Reaching the inner entrance to the grounds, he slipped inside, staying to the shadows. Given everything that had happened to him over the past week, he didn't feel like just waltzing into an unknown situation. He'd had more than enough near death experiences.
It was Pansy who responded, slipping an arm around Draco's waist. "And why would he need to talk to you, Potter?"
Rosalind was surprised that such knowledge was possessed by the blond and the look on her face spoke of it. It had been generations since the Elves had been frequent visitors to the mortal realm. "I was unaware the Wizarding folk still remember a time when we did." This one sparked her curiosity in very different ways than Harry. Harry worried her in the way that most Mothers did. Her own children had long since grown and left home. Harry had instantly reminded her of them in their youth and had her instantly believing that he was in need of protecting. Draco, it seemed, sparked her more intellectual interests.
She didn't have to ask who Harry was talking about. "Like I said before, I can't claim to know what will happen. It's a completely unprecedented event."
His only response was a low growl that had the hair on the back of his neck rising. Harry's attacks where coming faster and faster, which didn't leave Draco with much room to use either his sword or his magic. He could still feel Harry's magic building. He didn't know where Lothair or Ilaria were. He'd lost track of them in their fight. He briefly let his mind shift to locating them and that was all the invitation Harry needed, side stepping Draco's sword, Harry brought his own sword up holding it horizontally in front of him, the flat of the blade pushing back against his outstretched palm. The scent of blood zeroed Draco's attention back on Potter just in time to see the blood well up over the edge of the brunettes blade as it dug into his skin before all that magic Harry had been building within him exploded outward in a wall of air.
Soren nodded his agreement. "If there is one thing we can guarantee it is that Roland has an inside informant and they have obviously been infiltrating our system for a good period of time without detection. Until we can find the leak, everything has to be kept between the six of us."
"You can't be-" Harry scrambled for an argument. He was right. It'd never come up that Draco was an Elf. All they knew was that they'd somehow saved him from being tortured by Lucius. That was it. "Well, you need to quit."
It was Soren. Neither Rosalind or Harry had heard the other Elf enter the room. Ilaria stood silently behind him as he surveyed the prone form of Draco on the bed. His eyes moved from the hospital bed to Harry and it might have been Harry's imagination, but he could have sworn that Rosalind stiffened beside him as he met Soren's gaze. "What?"
There was silence at that. It had been centuries since humans had been permitted in the realm and while Harry had a particular investment in the human population of Britain, he couldn't really fault them for their caution. The moment they order had found out about the Elves and Harry's connection to them, he knew there would have been a push to involve them in this fight with Voldemort. Any advantage was worth the risk. It was bad enough that Harry was already involving them, but to have them enter the realm without permission was going to fracture what little stability he had in this world.
Draco began inching away again as the wolves growled and barked at each other. Whatever they were communicating about was lost on him. Not only did he have no knowledge of how to read the inflation or deflation in the yips and barks, he was much more concerned with keeping himself alive. At least if he reached the water he could allow the river to carry him downstream, which would allow for his scent to be lost in the water and, hopefully, allow him to slip away.
It had seemed like forever, but Soren eventually straightened and turned his attention to Ilaria. "I'd like you to accompany me, Ilaria. The Wolves must not be kept waiting. Hospitality is the only thing we currently have to smooth over the current situation, which is something we must do prior to the council with Harry. It is a complicated matter that neither party completely understands."
Harry flushed brilliantly at that. "Woo?" he spluttered, shaking his head. "I'm pretty sure he'll just make fun of me all the more ... or break my noise again."
Snape simply raised an eyebrow at the younger man's mutterings. "And why, exactly," he hedged, "Are you associating with Potter?"
Harry tensed again, watching as Draco stalked closer and tried to subtly step in front of Gwen in an attempt to keep the blond's attention on himself. "That isn't fair-" he started, his eyes widening slightly as Draco was suddenly standing in front of him. He didn't think the blond even knew how quickly he'd moved. One moment he'd been ten feet away and then the next he'd been suddenly standing in front of Harry, his hands clenched in the front of Harry's shirt.
By the time Harry arrived at the Great Hall for lunch with Ron, having just returned from a rather disastrous herbology class involving Venomous Tentacula. There were little stinging bite marks along his inner arm to prove it. Madame Pomfrey had insisted he go up to see Madame Pomfrey since the venom could be quite potent ... cept it wasn't exactly potent enough to do him any harm. Still stung like hell though.
As the wolf's attention remained distracted by the movement in the trees, Draco began inching again toward about the river. He tried to make as little nose as possible but even with his care, the wolf's eyes zoned back in on him. Draco gulped as he stared into the large, narrowed eyes of the creature in front of him. The only thing he saw in their depths was death and pain.
Moving to one of the stone heads, he placed a hand on the smooth surface and focused inward. After a moment, he pulled away. "It seems somewhat similar to dragon magic, but it's not exactly the same. After centuries, all the magic had found ways to merge. It was amazing really. An entire structure of magic and stone that was separated from any one form of magic.
He could feel the guard arriving in the other room and he moved to the door. "Akkar, Saeya. Lindir!" Three elves appeared immediately and Lothair motioned them into the room. "It's a forbidden curse."
"Daemeon sends his regards and demands that you take proper care of some of his finest work." The smugness in her tone couldn't dim the excitement that was shining in her eyes. The weapons junkie in her couldn't contain her excitement at getting to look at something new. "Well, hurry up and open them!"
At first, Draco hadn't been entirely sure how the hell he was even supposed to get out of the chamber. The ride down had been disgusting and had created the sense of a one-way trip. Given the fact that there used to be a Great deadly snake living down there, he supposed, that for most people, it was a one-way trip. Much to his pleasure, the shifting of the space had also created a different means of entering and exiting the Chamber; a much more convenient means.
Sighing, he steeled himself and quickly reached out to knock before he could change his mind. There were certain things he needed to speak with him about before they headed out of the Realm. With only two days left before their departure, he was running out of time.
Rolling his eyes, Draco let them land on Harry, pinning him with a look that clearly showed just what he thought of this particular line of conversation. "Because you were the closest and you owe me."
For the third time Hermione's warm brown eyes lifted from the page of the thick text she had balancing precariously on her knee, the creases of her forehead but one of the many signs that she was severely annoyed. "Do I think
That thought earned a swift pulse of irritation that he did his best to ignore. It wasn't any different from the Wizarding world. He'd arrived there with no knowledge of himself or what had happened to him. It would be no hard thing to deal with his life being public knowledge. Been there. Done that. Bought the t-shirt. Perhaps, for a moment, he'd assumed that this place would be different. It would seem, however, that Elves - despite their societal superiority complex - were just as interested in rumours as their Wizarding counterparts.
It was not just anger that coursed through his veins. Under all that boiling rage was a steel core of fear. He'd been trying to escape the whole battle between two sides who were equally willing to sacrifice him. His mother had died for it and all he'd managed was to be caught in one cage after another; the last one a more permanent cage than he'd thought was possible. He didn't belong in a cage. He didn't belong in
Sorren nodded his agreement, even as Lothair asked if there was anything suspicious about how or where they had gathered.
As he glanced around, he half expected to find the basilisk lurking around the corner. There was no sign of it's remains anywhere and Harry wondered if someone had come to collect it. House-elves, maybe? It didn't really matter, he supposed, so long as it wasn't still there lurking in wait for him.
Harry didn't know why he did it. It was admittedly childish. As Gwynn released him, he glared at Draco and wrapped his arms around Gwynn like a little boy latching onto his favourite toy and earning a startled squeak of surprise and, perhaps, a little bit of fear from her. Draco looked like he was ready to kill them both.
"I'm not. Sharing your blood with someone, particularly a human, is not something to be taken lightly."
Anyone walking by the infirmary then would have heard the rich sound of Rosalind's laughter echoing out into the corridor.
The sound of his Mother's familiar tone sent such a rush of relief through him, Draco very nearly choked on his response. "Mum?" As the relief lifted, Draco could feel a growing sense of unease clawing away at his chest. His mother hadn't come into his room during the night since he was a child. "What are you doing?"
Draco lungs burned, even after he'd drawn in enough air for them the function. His throat felt like sandpaper and it was difficult to swallow without a certain amount of pain. Despite his eyes being open, Draco couldn't focus on his surroundings, his vision slipping in and out once more. His heart was beating and he was once again breathing, but the wounds his body had sustained had not been healed, nor had the blood been replaced. As the last efforts to remain conscious slipped away, Draco focused on a pair of bright green eyes peering into his own, an unknown emotion radiating from their depths. Those eyes were the last things he saw before slipping into darkness once more.
Ignoring him, Ilaria smiled brightly, making a few motions with her hands and materialized two long wooden boxes. Both smooth and polished. "First, presents!" The first box was shorter than the other and a green so dark it was almost black and wrapped with a golden bow. The second was a blue so soft it bordered on white, a navy blue bow on it. With another motion of her hand, she sent each box to its respective owner; the green to Harry and the blue to Draco.
Harry frowned, glancing away as they continued to walk. He didn't want to let go of the anger that had gripped him. A part of him wanted retribution. The deepest part of him wanted blood and that part scared him. He'd gone through so many changes he had assumed there was nothing left to change, but he was starting to feel like he was losing even more of himself; piece by piece. "What do you want me to do then?" he asked, his tone a little sharper than he had intended.
The comment had not come from any of the men, but contained a soft tone that had previously been absent from the group. Along with this voice came the sound of light footsteps echoing through the hall. Soren, Lothair, and Harry all turned their attention to the new arrival. For Harry, the moment was a bit surreal. His eyes found themselves focusing on identical blue irises surrounded by a delicate line of black eyeliner and thick, dark lashes. Soren had done a proficient job creating Harry's disguise, for he was almost an exact replica of the woman standing before them. As she came to a stop in front of him, Harry's eyes met hers and they shared a gaze that seemed to isolate the two of them for the briefest second. When she looked away, only then was the bond between them broken, leaving Harry with the strange sense that he had just been released from restraints rather than her gaze.
Harry had never been to the suites Lothair resided in when at the Manor. Hell, he hadn't even known if he even chose to reside in the Manor. Not wanting to involve Soren or Ilaria, it left him with little options on how to find the surly Elf. In the end, he found himself having to ask one of the staff to point him in the right direction.
The fact that he couldn't decide why he'd ever started referring to him by his first name to begin with only infuriated him all the more.
Draco raised an eyebrow but didn't comment since Pansy was already cutting in. "He's kind of busy right now, can't you see?"
He'd been himself when he had lost consciousness. His hair had been normal, his appearance had been normal. Now he was waking up with Potter, of all people, standing over him with those bright bloody green eyes and dorky smile. Draco's eyes snapped up, narrowed with suspicion and anger. "What the hell did you do?" he demanded, moving to slide out of bed. His hand shot out to steady himself as he stood on unfamiliar legs and adjusted to the change in his height. The more he focused on the changes, the more he realized had changed. He was taller and much broader. The birds he had thought he'd heard through an open window, he could see flying overhead roughly a quarter of a mile away. "Why the hell am I here and what the hell is going on?"
Harry didn't comment, he just set off, allowing Draco to follow him in silence. Thankfully, he was quite aware of where the kitchen was located. It was one of his favourite places in the Manor. It helped that the food was just as delightful as the food at Hogwarts. He'd even been able to talk the cooks into making him Treacle Tart whenever he wanted it. They weren't entirely happy about incorporating human recipes, but given how happy it made Harry whenever he was served it, they had relented.
"You can't because we're not supposed to be sharing more information with them about us than is absolutely necessary, hence the reason most of us are under glamors when we leave here."
Even with the majority of his focus on deflecting Gwynn's attacks, a part of Harry's mind still had the room to run strategically through the offensive moves Ilaria had skillfully trained them to execute. What he needed, however, was an opening. He doubted he would be given one easily. Returning from the possible list of attacks, Harry's eyes narrowed in on Gwynn's movements. They were almost perfectly executed, her focus intent on their execution. Luckily for Harry, there was but one tiny flaw. When performing an outward thrust of one's sword, Ilaria had made it extremely clear that the amount of space between the extended arm and one's body was minimal. Even on the offensive a warrior needed to protect his person. Gwynn's mistake was a growing gap between her body and her outstretched arm. It was a beginner's mistake that put Harry immediately on edge, but he was running out of time and options.
Harry hadn't even opened his mouth before the injured wolf had started to respond, it's head lowered in shame as it spoke. "I apologize, my Lord. I did not know this human belonged to you."
"I'll partner with him." She repeated amongst the disapproving murmur of their fellow classmates. It was clear that they did not think it appropriate that she willingly offer to play the role, which only added to Harry's annoyance. He might be royalty but he still needed to learn. In this aspect he was just like everyone else and he really wished the majority of the group would accept the idea.
