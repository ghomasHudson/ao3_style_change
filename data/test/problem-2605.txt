“I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know,” Harry chanted the three words like a mantra.
Ron and Hermione exchanged understanding looks, and turned back to Harry, sympathy on their faces. Harry felt quite uncomfortable. If there was one thing he couldn’t stand, it was pity.
Lying on his back, in the comfort of his bed and staring blankly up at the canopy of his bed, he finally was unable to escape his thoughts. Draco Malfoy. He mouthed the name, making sure to stay silent. The darkness of the night enveloped him, and Harry suddenly felt as if he was being held by it. It was a sure, sturdy feeling, and he was comforted.
“I wasn’t going to jump, if that’s what you were thinking, Potter.” Harry was still visibly shaken. He barked out several bursts of joyless laughter as his eyes filled with detestable tears. He would not cry, especially in front of Malfoy. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he just wanted to wrap his arms tightly around Draco, to prove to himself that he was real. They both were.
Draco rolled his eyes and huffed, “Yes Potter, now you know. So glad I could help you along on your journey of self discovery. Just what I’ve always dreamt of.”
“Bloody thoughtful of you. I could have been comatose and you wouldn’t have tried to wake me up.”
The Slytherin common room was, on this particular day, extremely noisy. There were younger kids shrieking about one thing or another, and some of the older ones decided it was a good idea to start a drinking game. Although, being a Friday after class was done, Draco didn’t see the real harm here.
With how busy things had been getting over the last several weeks, Harry had hardly thought about the night with Malfoy in the Room of Requirement. Things were going well with the DA, he was now apparently dating Cho Chang, and he’d managed to keep Umbridge out of his hair… for the most part. It was surprisingly rare that he even thought about Malfoy, which almost surprised Harry. Well, his mind had been pretty occupied as of late.
Neville sighed before speaking, “It’s nothing serious. I just think Harry should know that earlier tonight, Malfoy was watching the quidditch team practicing. Specifically you, Harry.”
Draco could tell that something changed in the conversation he and Potter were having. It had been dare he say, pleasant. And then Potter suddenly grew rigid, glaring at Draco. Wasn’t Potter just grinning and bantering along with him? The Slytherin sighed ruefully, understanding that the moment of civility was gone.
Ah but Potter. That was a pleasant unwanted thought.
Harry briskly walked up and snatched the blond’s wand, which had landed several feet from the slytherin himself. “What was that now?” He asked with a smug face.
Harry couldn’t help but admire the way Draco’s smooth, pale back looked in the light of the fire. He adored the platinum blond hair that was normally neatly manicured, but now was as disheveled as their tryst. He ground into him deeply, hitting all the important areas. At this point Harry knew Draco’s body well. Harry leaned down so that he could talk into the pale, gasping man’s ear.
“Then why did I enjoy it?” Harry blurted without thinking. Draco’s breath hitched, catching in his throat.
“Bet you they got caught up snogging each other and lost track of time,” Pansy hissed, sniggering harshly. Draco would be lying if he said he didn’t feel like throwing up. Just the thought of being close in proximity to the Weasel was enough to make Draco sick. He didn’t want to think of Harry liplocked with the redhead.
The Slytherin whirled around, turning to see exactly whom he expected to see: Harry bleeding Potter.
“I miss you more, Lys.” He gave her an affectionate eskimo kiss, from which she giggled delightedly.
“Well it’s obviously not nothing, Harry. Is it about Umbridge? Cho? Malfoy?”
He did not.
Harry sat, facing Draco with a look of concentration and strain on his face. He looked as if he was deep in thought, like he was perplexed. The light of the fire made it look as if the dark haired man was glowing. Draco felt a pang in his chest as Harry’s green eyes arose to meet his, pain evident in them.
The blond cleared his throat, trying to save the dignity that he had.
Gently, Draco leaned forward and brushed some of Potter’s fringe out of his face, catching a glimpse of the famous scar that Voldemort had left. He felt his breath catch in his throat. The Slytherin wondered if the scar ever hurt Potter. He didn’t really want to find out.
“What are you smiling about?”
Before he could finish, Malfoy had pulled him down onto the couch, against himself, and crashed their lips together.
Harry’s eyes widened. No. Ohhhh no. Malfoy as an acquaintance? Sure. Malfoy as a friend? Doubtful. But Malfoy as a crush? There were multiple layers of wrong in that. First off, Harry wasn’t gay. Second, this was Draco fucking Malfoy! One of the worst people Harry knew! No sodding way.
Potions seemed to pass by rather breezily after that, although Draco still couldn’t quite scrub the image of Potter and Weasly out of his head. Disgusting. But he had to admit, it was better than letting his mind wander to the Astronomy tower, and having a situation of a different sort arise.
“My parents are taking the family to Paris for Christmas,” Pansy said, puffing out her chest with pride, “I can’t wait to see what it looks like covered in snow.”
Pansy was quick to notice this, “What do you say, Draco? Reckon they were heating it up in a broom closet? Getting all hot and bothered?”
“Was it just me, or was Malfoy a lot more of a git today than usual?” Ron mumbled as they headed up the stairs.
“I – I – I…” Harry stammered, disgust for himself welling up, threatening to overflow. What had he… what had he just done? “I don’t know what…” he found himself unable to articulate what he wanted or needed to say.
“Really Harry I’ve already stayed too long here, babysitting you.” Draco felt his voice shake. So preoccupied was he, that he didn’t even notice that he’d called Potter by his first name.
“My friends wouldn’t lie to me, Malfoy. They’re not like yours.” Potter was slowly walking closer to Draco, who was hyper aware of the other boy’s movements.
Draco sucked in his breath as Harry worked his mouth over Draco’s exposed skin. He leaned in close as the other boy wrapped his legs around him.
Draco stormed down the corridors, heading to no place in particular. He felt very strange. His chest felt tight, as if it were being constricted; his heart wasn’t right either, pulsing with bullets of pain. But at the same time, he knew this feeling was good. His body felt like it would explode, but he was undeniably excited. About what? Well, Draco had an idea, but he wasn’t extremely fond of it.
Harry scoffed, “We’re just fooling around Malfoy.”
Draco looked up, hearing the yawn from Potter, “Oh you’re awake.”
Gasping, he stood up and laughed as much as he could have, aiming his wand directly at Harry, “You dense-headed prick, should’ve finished me while you could have. But that’s a gryffindor for you, always have to have the last word.”
“Maybe a sleeping potion would help?” the witch suggested.
“Oh come on, Potter!” Draco exclaimed, “Don’t tell me you don’t see the humor in this?”
The trio was silent for several moments, the intensity of the situation weighing down on them. Finally, Hermione sighed, “We’ll have to think of something. But it will have to be after charms. Malfoy hasn’t told Umbridge yet, so we’ve still got time to sort this out.”
“Miss Granger,” Snape whirled around to stare directly at Hermione, “If you deem it necessary to disrupt my class with your chatter then you may excuse yourself. Ten points from Gryffindor.” Hermione fumed silently after that, nearly breaking her quill as she returned to her notes.
“I want you to explain,” Potter responded, crossing his arms and standing in a contrapasso manner.
“You’re so cold.” A voice beside him said. He was holding a hand much smaller than his own. Draco looked down at the owner of the voice to see a little girl with dark hair looking up at him, squeezing his hand. She was familiar to him, but he’d never seen her before in his life.
“Rum Punch, damnit,” Harry grumbled, and the fat lady sniffed haughtily in response, but swung open nevertheless.
He opened up the book he was supposed to be taking notes out of, and out fell the strip of paper with the name ‘Lysandra’ written on it. Draco hummed quietly, running a finger over the hastily scribbled lettering. What could it mean? The thought of the person behind the name sent warmth blooming throughout his core. He thought back to the dream that he’d had, the dream that gave him the name written down. He just knew that she had something to do with Potter. The thought made him ache, because if she had something to do with him, then Draco would probably never encounter her. Even though the thought of never seeing her again troubled him greatly, his face remained impassive.
Harry looked at him with pleading eyes, desperate for some sort of answer, “Malfoy wait!” The Gryffindor grabbed a hold of Draco’s wrist before he could truly leave. Draco looked down at Harry’s hand with nervous agitation, his brows furrowing. Back to ‘Malfoy’ huh? So soon? He almost chuckled darkly.
Before Draco could properly react to what he was seeing, his stomach did a little summersault as he saw a familiar mop of black hair resting on the table Draco was aiming for. He smirked to himself, forgetting most everything else around him.
I told you there was spice at the end. Like Kung Po Chicken. Mmmm.
Harry let out a shaky sigh of relief that turned into a nervous chuckle. “No, none of that tonight. I’m not that despicable….”
was he going to take down the most powerful group of pureblood wizards in the country?
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Amateur.”
Harry breathed out another laugh. “My methods may be mad, but they’re also successful.”
“No, he doesn’t. It’s shit, Hermione, but it’s the truth.” Harry put his head in his hands with a sigh, but Hermione grabbed his forearm and yanked it away, causing his head to fall sharply. “Ow.”
for Harry, how would Malfoy know what his patronus was? Nothing about it made sense.
Draco pulled him into a kiss, a proper one this time. Harry ran one of his hands through Draco’s hair, and let the other one slip underneath Draco’s shirt and run along his back.
Harry took a deep breath and looked Malfoy in the eyes. “Can I talk to you, Malfoy. It’s important.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, his face becoming almost unbothered. “I thought we were over this fight. Didn’t we just have it last week?”
, he was in the middle of tying his towel when he looked up to see Harry standing there.
weird?” Pansy said, her head resting in Ginny’s lap. “Blaise was getting on rather well with Charlie Weasley.”
Harry nodded. “Our thoughts go out to Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy during this hard time.” He looked at Draco. “That’s all of it.”
“Are you not even going to
“I do?”
had fantasised about him.
He figured they must have slept for a while - after all, they did fall asleep in the middle of the day yesterday - and he felt fantastic. He hadn’t had a full night’s sleep in months, aside from the occasional night out that would end in afters at his flat that someone would bring weed to. But, even that peaceful sleep was tinged by the nausea that followed from his hangover the next day. Harry tried not to think it, but he enjoyed waking up next to Draco, seeing his face so soft and happy. Harry also tried not to think about the fact that he was absolutely fucked. They were never supposed to actually sleep together. But, here he was, realising that, once again, his life was not going to plan. Nothing ever did.
“I love you, too.”
Harry smiled, standing up and putting on his coat. As they walked out, Draco’s hand was on the small of Harry’s back, gently pushing him. He could hear the room go silent, and knew that they would be in the newspapers tomorrow. Hopefully he would have some peace from his younger fans now.
Harry bit his lip, praying to every god that was listening that no one would tell him the truth. Ron looked over at Harry, an amused smile on his face, and he turned back to Arthur.
Harry sat down beside her, and Malfoy took the seat across from her.
Harry laughed. “How about I start by paying for your drink, then?”
Draco nodded back slowly.
“What the fuck did I just walk into?” Came a voice from the living room door, and Harry turned to see George standing in the doorway, a frown on his face.
In the spirit of being civil, Harry was trying to keep his distance from Malfoy. It was the easiest way to prevent any fighting. Except, he had been wanting answers about the tattoo for weeks now. Ever since he had seen the bloody thing, it was all he could think about. So, he decided to start being… nice. To Malfoy.
The three of them laughed at that. Harry was still in his pyjamas, but he didn’t care. He was used to people staring at him, especially when he was with the Slytherins, so it wasn’t much different from usual.
have much else to do.
“Can someone please just speak?” Harry asked, defeated.
“Is it hard for you?” Harry asked, the thought only just occurring to him.
“My patronus is a stag.” Harry said. He could have said it better - nicer, even - but, he was on a time limit and he needed to talk quickly. He watched Malfoy’s eyes widen. “Did you know that?”
He smiled back. “Like a baby.”
She said loudly, her eyes wide. Draco swallowed beside Harry and let his hand slip off of his arm, as though it had never been there in the first place.
Hermione smiled slightly at that. She spoke quietly. “Yeah, I guess he would.”
And with that, he turned around and walked away, going to join his friends elsewhere in the hall.
Harry laughed. “That’s what I said. I have no fucking clue what I’m doing.”
Hermione and Ron nodded.
“Are you?” Harry blurted out. “In the closet, I mean. Or… were you? Before this all happened.”
Harry nodded, and they set back to work.
Harry’s brows furrowed. “Not like what?” His voice wobbled, but it didn’t matter. He was about to be divorced. At 36. That was too young.
“I love you, too.”
“That’s right, sir.”
“Where have you been?” Ron asked through a mouthful of food.
“Not that I knew of.” Harry said. “But, now that you mention it, maybe they did.” He shivered. “I don’t want to think about it."
Theo nodded at Harry, Draco and Neville, and walked out of the Great Hall. After a few moments, Neville shut his book and turned to Harry. “Listen, Harry, I know his family were on the wrong side of the war, but he’s a good bloke. I promise.”
“Odd.” Draco murmured. Harry nodded.
There was an extremely awkward silence where Malfoy’s eyes widened comically before he threw his head back and let out a laugh - a real, loud laugh - and Harry found himself wondering if he had ever seen Malfoy laugh before.
Harry and Malfoy made sounds of protest.
Harry’s friends had all made a no-gift pact for Christmas. They had all agreed that it was far too sentimental. Harry had bought his family gifts, of course, and they had opened them with smiles on their faces, but none of his friends even mentioned presents. It was nice, really. It took the pressure off.
George eyed up the Slytherins, a frown taking over his face. Harry held his breath. George had not been doing well since the war, and three Slytherins in his house could affect him badly. He felt Draco swallow beside him, and Harry instinctively moved in closer to him.
There was a pause where Draco frowned and opened his mouth to speak again, but Harry knew what his next question was going to be, so he spoke quickly before the word, ‘why’ could leave Draco’s lips. “I was almost sorted into Slytherin, you know.”
Harry was shocked at that. “Why?”
to hex him. You could punch him. Or kick him. Anything, really. As soon as possible.”
is going on with you?”
And, of course,
, but upon further inspection he realised it was a travel guide, detailing the most beautiful spots in Britain - both wizarding and muggle - and he found that Draco’s handwriting was all over the book. On the inside cover, he had written, “So you never have to feel trapped again” and he had dog-eared many pages, writing about his experiences of some of the locations, extra information, and adding references to their previous discussions about where Harry had wanted to visit.
“Sort of. After a while, I didn’t try as hard, but at the start, I did.”
Harry trailed his kisses up until he met Draco’s mouth, kissing him hard and slow. “I think,” Harry said when they broke apart, “One of us,” He moved to Draco’s ear and whispered seductively, “Shouldn’t be able to walk tomorrow.”
Hermione rolled her eyes and shoved him towards the bed. “Draw something good.”
Luna was on the other side of Harry, and she greeted him with her usual whimsical nature. “Hello, Harry.” She said, before grabbing his hand and lightly stroking it absent-mindedly as she paid attention to the conversation taking place beside her.
Harry watched with wide eyes as he felt Draco hold in laughter from beside him. “What’s so funny?” Harry whispered, turning to Draco.
He heard the door shut behind him heavily, and then the sound of Malfoy rummaging around was heard, before a muttered, “lumos”, gave Harry his sight back. As the wand brightened and Harry could finally see in front of him, he realised that he wasn’t in a small space at all. In fact, a whole room appeared in front of him; large and open and comfortingly bright.
He heard Seamus’ laughter, reaching him from a few seats down. He rolled his eyes. Even the Gryffindors were talking about it.
“Draco! What the fuck?”
Theo nodded and looked at Harry. “Thanks again, Harry.”
It was… surprising, Harry supposed, to see all of his friends in one place like this. Since the Slytherin game night, they had all been getting on well. They would speak in the hallways when they passed each other, help each other with homework and studying, sit next to each other during meals, and wander into each other’s common rooms as though the war was a distant memory.
(See the end of the chapter for
to go to this thing, she probably meant you had to bring someone, too.”
Harry blinked a few times. “What?”
Luna looked a bit confused but smiled nonetheless and came to join them when they made room for her. “What are you doing here, Harry?”
Harry found that he and Draco were having a much better time than his two friends. They were in the middle of the dancefloor, amidst most of their classmates, drinking and grinding as much as possible. They were in their own world, really.
“I didn’t really sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face, full of shadows and darkness. I told my parents the next day, and they said they believed me, but I could tell they were worried about me. So, that night, I kept my curtains shut. I didn’t want to look outside - I didn’t want to worry my parents. But, as I drifted off to sleep, a gust of wind came from the window. I was sure I had shut it, but it blew my curtains open nonetheless. It was so freezing, it was almost painful. It took me a few minutes to get up.”
Harry nodded. “Yes.” He tried to apologise, but apparently he wasn’t all that sorry, because the Veritaserum wouldn’t let him.
“I’m excited to see them again.” Harry said, though his mind was elsewhere.
“Oh… Well, I see… Wh… What do you want me to…”
“Well…” Hermione said, as though she was about to say something more, but simply left it there.
She frowned and opened her mouth at that, but he cut her off before she could even start.
when you were younger?” The book was thick for a children’s novel - it was the type of thing he would read nowadays.
“It’s part of the set, apparently.” Pansy sighed and rolled her eyes.
“Malfoy!”
Harry nodded so fast his neck hurt.
Harry nodded. “I know. You’re running away.”
would have shagged Malfoy” and everyone started speaking at once. Shortly after he arrived, he shared an awkward conversation with Ginny that he had been avoiding for months, which ended with an extremely clumsy hug that neither of them enjoyed, but she had still smiled at him and said, “see you later, Harry” as though they weren’t living in the same house.
He took a deep breath and started reading. “Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco Malfoy, reveals the truth about his son and Harry Potter to Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Recently imprisoned and ready to tell all, Mr Malfoy has claimed he always knew…” Harry trailed off, reading ahead slightly.
“What the fuck?” He practically yelled, his eyes wide with shock.
Theodore was a much better kisser than Millicent. Not that she was bad, of course, but Harry found himself rather surprised by the way Theodore grabbed him. It lasted longer than his and Millicent’s kiss, but Harry wasn’t complaining, because he

Draco groaned. “That ruins all the fun, Harry.”
He felt Malfoy tug his arm slightly, pulling him along to a wooden reception desk, where a smiling woman stood.
been tragic.
She shrugged. “I mean, I have a few ideas, but they mean nothing if I haven’t looked into them.”
“No questions asked?” Theodore Nott’s interest was piqued.
“I wish he could just… quit his job.” Harry said, a dry laugh escaping his lips. “Or, I wish I could.”
He loved them for that.
“It’s no problem,” They said with a smile, “I’ve heard the stories about you guys, and I’m so glad I could help cover that mark up a bit.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He considered apologising, considered punching Draco in the face, or maybe making a run for it, but he couldn’t help but notice just how close Draco was to his face. He was pressing Harry against the wall, and it was doing things to Harry that he shouldn’t be thinking about right now. But, he just couldn’t help it. He couldn’t help looking at Draco’s lips. He watched them as they moved.
He felt her eyes on him, but he couldn’t take his eyes off of Malfoy’s tattoo. Even when Malfoy pulled his shirt back down, oblivious to Harry’s shock, he kept on staring at the area where he had seen it.
Draco nodded, still smiling. He was often smiling nowadays, Harry realised. “That was what I was hoping would happen. I know you’ve been promoting inter-house unity, Harry, but the rivalry’s still here. If the Gryffindors drink, the Slytherins will, too. At least, this way, some poor fuckers will be spilling all of their secrets.”
“Wait, you’re wanting a favour
The first year, who was a rather scrawny boy, grinned at the answer. “What was it like to die?”
There was a silence that took over the room, but then Blaise smashed a glass and they all burst into laughter at the ridiculousness of the whole thing. Harry felt Draco ease further into the sofa as he laughed.
“I violated the sign, thanks to you.” Pansy said, although she looked like she couldn’t care less about the bloody sign as Ginny shifted closer to her in her seat.
Harry looked at Draco, realising all of a sudden that he wasn’t the only victim here. He was just the new one. “Fuck, I’m sorry.”
“Hey!” Ron said, his smile warm.
“Well,” Malfoy spoke between laughs, clutching his stomach whilst doing so, “It’s just, you must be joking.”
Harry thought to himself.
The three of them laughed at that, and Harry counted it as a win. They were doing well after the war, all things considered. They laughed through the pain and grief and they stuck by each other through it all. But not in the Great Hall. Not ever. The Great Hall was tense and hostile at the best of times and they
She looked as though she had expected that answer, and said, “Yes, I do.” And with that, she left.
And with that, he went on his way, not leaving any room for discussion.
, and he had
They were now practically sharing the same seat, but Harry didn’t mind. In fact, he wanted to move in closer, but before he could, he realised that Malfoy was already doing so. He looked at Malfoy’s face, at his eyes, and noticed that Malfoy’s eyes were focused on Harry’s mouth.
in it for me? A favour? Half the people in this room owe me favours.”
He was distracted as he walked, busy being in his own head. Which is why he wasn’t exactly watching where he was going. And, just as he was rounding the corner to get to the library, he smacked right into someone, and felt his body jolt backwards.
At least, for Draco, being friends with Harry had come with its benefits. Since they had started hanging out with each other, he had only been hexed a few times, and Harry had ensured that none of them would ever do so again, yelling all kinds of threats at them until they practically sprinted away to the sound of Draco cracking up (“You’ll kill them like you killed Voldemort?” He had wheezed to Harry later, his laughing distracting him from saying Voldemort’s name, “Isn’t that a tad far?”)
“Since two minutes ago.” Pansy said and, as though to prove her point, put an arm around Harry’s shoulder and walked him over to one of the sofas. “You’re here just in time, Potter.”
He stormed through the eighth year common room - past the stares and the “are you okay”s and, oh yeah, he supposed he did look quite awful right now - and made his way to Draco’s room. He knocked on the door so hard and so fast that he was sure his knuckles would bruise if he continued for much longer, but luckily Draco answered the door rather quickly. The look on his face was a mixture of concern and annoyance, but he let Harry in without a word anyway.
Because, a completely unexpected outcome of the house rivalry was the newfound civility he shared with Draco. After the war, they had exchanged handshakes and apologies, and Harry was certain they wouldn’t be seeing each other again. But then, they had both returned to Hogwarts, and they had seen their peers fighting over the past, and they had started rolling their eyes at the scenes together, shaking their heads at each other and moving on silently. And, Harry supposed, somewhere along the way, they were no longer Potter and Malfoy anymore. They were Harry and Draco. They weren’t friends, really. Not exactly. They were… acquaintances. And Harry watched as his friends slowly warmed up to the idea of Draco being an acquaintance to them, too.
Harry grinned. “Yeah, I suppose it will be.”
Draco laughed loudly, but kept his hands on Harry’s shoulder, steadying him when he swayed as he got into his clothes. He finally dropped his arms when Harry pulled on his shirt, at which point they made their way over to the sofa.
Draco laughed. “Don’t worry too much about the plan, Harry. When have your plans ever worked out, anyway?”
He hadn’t read to anyone before, but he found it rather relaxing, and he could feel Draco sinking further into the mattress as he spoke. Every so often, he would pause, thinking Draco was asleep, but would look down to see his wide eyes staring up at him, at which point, he would smile and continue reading.
find it funny.” He rolled his eyes. “We’re on Veritaserum, you prick.”
She looked up at Harry with an odd look in her eyes. “Harry, I want to become the Minister for Magic one day. I won’t be able to… I can’t just stay home taking care of a baby.”
“Well,” Draco said, moving in closer until he was next to Harry’s ear, “I own a pair of tight leather trousers that would drive you positively insane.” He whispered, as Harry shivered at the thought.
Slughorn frowned as he saw that there were multiple Gryffindors in the Slytherin common room. “What on earth is going on here?” He asked, his voice rough with sleep and anger.

Pansy smirked. “Just curious.”
Malfoy breathed out a laugh. “Oh, yes. Top secret information, really. What about you?”

Luna nodded, then looked over Harry’s shoulder and grinned. “Draco! We were just talking about you.”
So, he figured it out. He needed something to bitch about. And, luckily for Hogwarts, he had just the thing. In sixth year, there was a
Draco suggested they make a detour to the dungeons for a few moments, which Harry didn’t really question. He stood in the corridor with Pansy, discussing Slughorn’s latest show of favouritism in class, which everyone was painfully aware of. Draco came out quickly, smiling as he did.
He watched as McGonagall cleared her throat and continued walking through the corridors. She passed them, and said clearly, “Curfew is in five minutes, boys,” before turning the corner and leaving their sight.
They both shifted around slightly, before each saying goodnight and falling asleep. Harry found it was rather easy to fall asleep beside Draco. His mind emptied, his breaths matched to Draco’s, and the whole world fell away as he drifted off into a peaceful, deep sleep.
Draco seemed to struggle with this question, his mouth twitching as he worked out how to answer. “Yes.” He finally said. “But, I don’t know if we should.” Harry’s eyebrows rose. “Harry, we’re friends.” Draco said, looking him in the eye. “And, our history is… a lot. I don’t want to ruin anything with… Well, with the truth. You know, the truth can be really shitty sometimes.”
Harry laughed. “I’m really happy for you, Hermione.”
said that… that sort of thing in the past.” He looked as though he was trying not to cry.

“I would have loved to see that.”
Ron nodded in agreement. “They seem pretty nice. We’re getting on well.” He grinned. “They

“Draco, are you okay?” He reached out to squeeze Draco’s arm, but Draco moved away slightly and Harry stopped.
Seamus laughed, and Dean snickered beside him. “What are you laughing for, Seamus?” Dean said. “I’ve only just gotten used to seeing you with eyebrows.”
Hermione gestured to the page in front of her. “Well, it says here that it’s usually done intentionally. It could be used as a way for a wizard to get help, or… well, give help.”
is my real life now.”
They caught up to Ron and Hermione, making small talk, but Harry knew his friends were worried. They knew him too well, and they knew when he was upset. They made their way to the castle together, Harry and Draco walking side by side, but not touching or speaking.
He watched as Draco’s eyes widened and he spluttered. There was a silence where Draco looked utterly lost and Harry burst out laughing.
Harry woke up to the sound of Pansy and Hermione laughing quietly. In the back of his mind, he registered that something heavy was on his legs, and that he was lying on something
And Harry had no choice but to believe him.

“At the last moment, just as I was shutting out the snow and the cold and the light, I saw a shadow. It was him, I knew it. I only saw him for a second, but he was right outside my window this time, staring in at me, and… smiling.”
Draco laughed. As he spoke, he levitated the tray over to the bed. “She didn’t used to be. She used to let the house elves do that, but now she prefers the muggle way. I think, after all the bad experiences she’s had with magic, she doesn’t want to contribute to that, anymore. She still uses it, of course, just a lot less.”
Harry waited for the both of them to finish laughing before saying, “Can I just get my bloody drink now?”
Harry smiled. “Sorry - long day. What is it that you do, exactly?”
They all talked and laughed for a while, each of them growing sleepier as their voices soothed them into the sofas. Harry found himself rather slouched when Ron and Hermione had said they had better be leaving. They had said they were going off to bed, but they left hand-in-hand and it was clear why they were really leaving. Pansy and Blaise groaned as they lifted themselves off the sofas, complaining about their Muggle Studies assignment that had been due yesterday but neither of them had completed yet.
make it through the night shift without lethal doses of caffeine.”
“Why not?” Blaise asked, his brows furrowed.
Hermione and Ginny gasped, turning to Harry, who started to blush furiously.
“She loves women. Worships them, really. She talks about it constantly.”
“Well, this will be interesting.” She said, although the look on her face made Harry want to hug her again.
“Except, this year, the cold seemed to fill the walls. It was like… like a dementor had come in. As though it were living in the floors, never letting the house warm up. The nights had seemed quieter during autumn, like they were preparing themselves for what was coming.”
prefer the dungeons, but this is… cute.”
Pansy narrowed her eyes. “You know I’m wearing underwear already?”
. That left Harry with either Draco or one of the younger Slytherins. Draco was the better option, so he made his way over to the blonde. This was fine. It really was. He just… wasn’t used to speaking to him. At all.
Malfoy’s smile widened, and he looked grateful for the change in subject. “You should. Merlin, it’s been years since I’ve had peanut butter. It’s great in coffee.”
“And my father.” Draco added, sadly.
imagined it. But, as I was lying there, I could have sworn the room got colder, darker, almost. I tried to ignore it, but I eventually had to get up to get another blanket from my cupboard. That was when I saw him again. He was outside my window again, but he was closer this time. I could almost see his face, but it was dark and, when I opened my mouth to scream, he disappeared again.”
He had found him rather quickly, marching through the corridors until he saw a flash of blonde hair. He opened his mouth to talk to him, ready to say something but, before he knew it, the blonde hair was gone and he was left standing on his own.
done the same to protect the people I love. We were forced into two very different situations, Draco. They were both shitty and I wish neither of us had to go through that, but neither of us had any choice. And when it really mattered, you saved my life.”
Harry’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. “You use muggle weed?”
Although their friendship was fake, he found himself genuinely enjoying Malfoy’s company, which he thought was odd at first. Malfoy had actually started to help Harry with his potions work in the past few weeks that they had been spending together, and Harry was grateful for the help.
be ready for this, but instead he just nodded and braced himself. He looked at Draco one last time. He looked at the soft beginnings of wrinkles on his face, and at his unsmiling mouth that Harry wished he could make turn up just once more. He looked at his piercing grey eyes and the single dimple on the left side of his face. He looked at his hair and how the light bounced off it slightly, knowing how soft it was, but also remembering that he would never touch it again.
Harry somehow managed to breathe a sigh of relief and have all the wind knocked out of his chest at the same time as he took in the sight. Malfoy was also wearing a suit, thank god, and he looked better than words could describe. His suit was light blue and fitted him perfectly, and his tie was grey and embellished with little blue flowers to match the jacket. It was delicate, and beautiful, and,
Draco shook his head. “Where the fuck do they live?”
“It is.” Draco whispered back. “Are you tired, Harry?”
He thought about it for the rest of the day, even as Sam left and called out, “Let me know how it goes!”
“Only five minutes late.” Draco said, his voice muffled in Harry’s shoulder. “I’m impressed.”
And so, instead of fixing it, he took a deep breath. “When do you leave?” His voice didn’t sound like his own. It sounded like it belonged to someone else - perhaps to the man in the mirror at the restaurant - but not to himself.
That was the first time he tried to talk to Malfoy.
He seemed to be having a staring contest with the newspaper, but he didn’t have to endure it for long, because Draco woke up with a start after a minute or so.
“What sort of ‘other stuff’?” Ron’s voice was just above a whisper, but he made sure to look around him whilst speaking.
“I’m fine.” He said, before she could even ask the question.
He tried not to realise how close he and Draco were right now. Their bodies seemed to be as close as two people could be without touching each other. Harry could practically feel Draco’s warmth from where he was sitting and he had to stop himself from melting into it. All of the humour of his and Draco’s act in front of Slughorn had turned into something else. Something… stronger. At least, on Harry’s end, it was.
He seemed far away for a few moments, and Harry was finding this conversation
Draco breathed a laugh. “Let’s go to my room, instead.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. Harry wondered why they were allowing him to be here in the first place. Perhaps his recent plan had been more successful than he had realised.
Once the doors to the Great Hall had shut fully, Harry expected Draco to stop and talk to him, but he kept his grasp on Harry’s hand tight and his pace quick. They made their way through the corridors, turning corner after corner until they reached an area of Hogwarts that Harry was sure he had never seen before.
Harry grumbled something unitelligable as he looked suspiciously around the dining hall. Why was everyone so loud this morning? Why was the sun so bright? Why did he get out of bed??
The library was understandably not very busy. No student was going to be studying or doing homework on a Friday unless the term was coming to an end, or they were Granger. Sighing, Draco walked past shelf after shelf, heading towards his favorite study area near the back of the library, where the chance that someone would interrupt him was slim.
The blond spit into his hand, using it as makeshift lubrication as he stroked up and down his shaft. Draco let his head roll back as he grazed over the head with his thumb, only to come down with vigor. He bucked into his own hand, gasping.
Harry wanted to talk to Malfoy again. He didn’t need to – not really; the Slytherin watching him play quidditch wasn’t really a valid reason to accost Malfoy. But Harry being Harry saw no other option than to figure out some way of forcing Malfoy’s attention. ‘It’s logic,’ he’d tell himself as he ignored whatever lesson he was in.
Draco, as well as the rest of the class jumped, startled as Potter and the Weasel entered the room. The Slytherin’s heart leapt as well, but for different reasons. It always did that when Draco saw Potter, even though he’d tried not to think about him since that night in the Astronomy tower. Avoiding thoughts of Potter was impossible for Draco. He mentally sighed, dejectedly turning around when Potter’s eyes met his. None of that, now.
I always update like, super late at night (or super early in the morning teehee). I know this one's a little short, but like, the next one's a doozy. So I guess hold on tight huh? And don't drink grape soda, it tastes like medicine.
“I’d like all of this a lot more if I could get one punch, just one, in on the git,” Ron grumbled, continuing with his food. And that was it on the matter.
Harry was too tired to get pissy with Malfoy. Instead, he elected the best choice of action would be to once again fall asleep using his bunched up robes as a makeshift pillow.
“Have you ever considered that perhaps Longbottom was lying to you?”
“Well then perhaps next time you’ll remember that columns don’t step aside for you. Go back to class,” the healer spoke curtly. Ron once again found himself doubled over with laughter, much to Harry’s chagrin.
“What?” Draco breathed, scratching his palms against the rough stone to wake himself up if this was a dream.
“You can never be sure though, can you?” Both boys’ voices were getting softer, the heat of anger and tension leaving them.
“Piss off,” Harry growled through clenched teeth. At that Draco laughed hollowly.
“Hello,” Harry said, standing with a quiet curious confidence.
He sighed, giving himself one last look in the mirror before gathering his things and walking out of the bathroom.
Pride swelled within Harry’s chest as he thought about how the banter between the two had gone. He’d actually managed to win a conversation with the Slytherin king himself. It was such a moment of secret happiness, that Harry almost forgot about Malfoy casually calling him by his first name. Strangely, he didn’t mind it.
“Can you tell me?” At this the little girl thought a moment. She tilted her head from one side to the other, looking up and humming with a finger on her chin. Her nails were painted bright purple.
“That just means you’ll get hurt all the more once they do lie,” Draco sighed as Potter raised a hand as if to cup the blond’s cheek. He wanted so badly to lean into the touch, his heart swelling. Why did it have to be like this? Why did everything have to hurt?
“It’s quite pathetic, actually,” Malfoy whispered against Harry’s lips, and Harry had to stop himself from whimpering. He licked his lips and Malfoy’s eyes darted down to steal a look at them before coming back up into Harry’s eyes.
“I’d drag you down with me, Malfoy, don’t think I wouldn’t,” Harry bit back, his wild, shaggy black hair falling back into place as the wind died down. He cut his eyes to Malfoy, who was still staring at him. For some reason, this encounter didn’t feel like any other one Harry faced with Malfoy. There didn’t seem to be any malicious intent. But Harry didn’t let his guard down.
Draco chuckled darkly, “Goodbye, Potter,” he said and turned to leave. But before he could, Potter yanked him around and slammed his lips into the Slytherin’s, their teeth clashing together.
For some reason, Draco thought this was obscenely funny, and let out a tilted, piercing laugh that no doubt disrupted the entire library. He caught himself and quickly covered his mouth with his hands, trying hard to subdue his laughter.
Yes, there was absolutely no way that these conditions were caused by Malfoy, unless he hexed Harry or something. Maybe he’d stop by the medical wing and see if he’d contracted some sort of illness. There was one thing that Harry knew, and that was that he didn’t feel good.
The problem was that Malfoy seemed to still be doing his utmost to ignore Harry’s very existence. And he was doing this very well. Not even a snide quip here or there, not even to Harry’s friends! But apparently he still had enough interest to stalk his quidditch practice.
Harry seethed, crumbling up the paper and shoving it in his robe’s pocket. He refused to turn around and look at Malfoy. He really just wanted to hit him.
“What do you want?” The words were cold but tired, dry like a stone. Potter was no doubt grateful when Draco leaned against the table and lowered the impaling brightness that his wand exuded.
“You can’t deny it!”
Feeling Draco’s chilled hands gliding across his skin, Harry shivered, arching closer to the warmth of Draco’s body. When they broke for air this time, the boy with the messy, dark hair immediately found the other’s pale neck, latching on with hunger.
Draco moved slowly until all of Harry was inside of his mouth. Sucking delicately, he pulled up until he reached the head, where he plunged down again. This continued for several turns, each time Draco descended causing harry to groan hoarsely as if in pain.
His heart was beating so hard he was almost sure Potter could hear it. This didn’t feel real, it felt foggy, like a dream. Draco’s breathing became shallow.
Draco bit his lip, concern etched onto every feature of his face. He backed away from Harry slowly, silently collecting himself.
Harry, throwing his inhibition and sense out of the window, pressed himself into Draco’s kiss, into the other boy’s embrace. With this Draco couldn’t help but moan softly, melting into Harry’s touch. Surprisingly, Harry was the one who pressed further, opening his mouth and prodding Draco’s lips with his tongue. Draco more than happily obliged, opening up as the Gryffindor slipped his tongue inside.
Harry nodded. “Okay. Thank you, Hermione.”
Harry stopped her with a smile on his face. “Shut up, I’ve not been begging.” He wondered when this had gotten so fun - joking with the Slytherins.
Draco nodded and took a breath. “Is it weird for you to be friends with Ginny?”
“I hear you’re handing out favours?” She asked, her eyes hopeful.
Harry nodded and grinned. “Are you up to anything right now, or do you want to help me with this?”
Draco swallowed. “You have nothing to apologise for.”
Malfoy scoffed and started walking again, continuing on his path.
“Running away sounds nice.” Harry laughed. “It sounds… peaceful.”
with the other houses? It was madness, and it shouldn’t be compulsory, and… He sighed. He
Harry pulled a face. “I’m not going to that.”
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “My friends?” Draco nodded. “You mean, the Gryffindors?” Draco nodded again. “I’ll… I can check. You want to invite them?”
“No, Draco.” Harry said forcefully, his head snapping up to look at Draco. “You
anymore.”
He couldn’t get it out of his mind. He couldn’t stop thinking about the stag, it’s antlers stretching up Malfoy’s stomach, drops of water covering it, the rest of his chest exposed, and only a towel covering up…
Ron’s eyes were slightly wide, but he responded all the same. “Thank you. How was France?”
Harry looked over at Draco, studying his face, looking at every crease around his eyes and mouth, and thought about how he couldn’t even imagine a single second where he hated Draco enough to not want to look at his face every day.
He was halfway through his iced tea, enjoying the quiet of the shop, when the bell at the front door rang to signal a customer had arrived. He resisted the urge to sigh or groan in frustration at the prospect of dealing with yet another person today, and he quickly made his way to the counter, clearing up his drink as he went and barely looking up as he did so.
“Malfoy,” Harry ground out, “Everyone’s watching us.”
Draco breathed out a laugh. “You’re welcome to sleep in Blaise and I’s room. Our beds are pretty big ever since we figured out how to cast an enlarging charm.”
Neville looked startled. “Not really.” He sighed, the Veritaserum clearly already working. “Why me?”
He lay smiling for a few minutes, looking at Draco’s face. He thought about how young and soft Draco looked when he was asleep, and thought for a painful moment that, perhaps this is how he would have looked all the time if it weren’t for Voldemort and his father. He shook that thought out of his brain just in time to hear Draco groan next to him.
Harry spoke in a whisper. “Do you want me to stop? We can do something else, if you want?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed and Hermione let out a satisfied ‘hmmf’.
“It was definitely a surprise.” She said, smiling. “But, let’s be honest, we should have seen it coming.”
Harry could barely breathe with the feeling, and all of a sudden, he was kissing back, and,
“Feeling bold are you? Are you finished?” Draco’s words were solid and stone, excluding as much emotion as he could. He almost always did it well.
Draco clumsily crashed into an empty table, scattering his things. He drew his wand on instinct, fury and self-preservation fueling him. It was so dark in there, whoever grabbed him must have shut the door. His breathing was labored as adrenaline pumped through his system.
Draco took this opportunity to grab Harry and flip him so that he was lying on the couch, underneath the blond. He didn’t say anything, but looked into Harry’s flourishing green eyes, lust and anticipation swirling inside. He captured the Gryffindor’s lips once again, running a hand down Harry’s side and sliding up his untucked shirt.
“Because you love her, you imbicile,” Harry swung around to see Malfoy sitting in the chair next to the one the little girl sat in.
“You? Best me?” Potter’s laughter rolled off of his tongue as he looked at Draco with mischevious eyes, like that of a cat about to tackle its mate, “I’d like to see you try.” Draco almost felt as if the room was closing in around him. He didn’t like this feeling, but at the same time he was addicted to it. Why did this feel so strange? Did Potter know?? How could he possibly know? Nothing made sense but everything made sense. Draco started to breath a bit faster.
Harry looked apologetically at Hermione before his thoughts were brought back to Malfoy by something fluttering over to his desk. It was a paper crane. He looked back to see Malfoy looking at him out of the corner of his eyes, a calculating look on his pale face. The chattering amongst his group had diminished as Harry turned back around. He unfolded the crane to see a note:
“Like it’s any of your business,” Harry snapped back, making room for Malfoy to sit nevertheless.
“Yes…” Malfoy drawled, a smile on his lips, “She and I both do.”
“Harry. I know I’m being a tad harsh. I’m tired. But really, with everything you have on your shoulders already, do you truly think you need a girlfriend? And I’m not just saying this because it’s Cho, I’d say this if it were any other girl too. Do you really believe that it would suit your best interest at the moment to have to worry about keeping a girlfriend? Honestly….”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize my concern for you was so amusing,” Hermione barked, flushing with frustration.
“I got your bloody note, Malfoy!” Harry pulled out the paper crane note given to him that day during potions. “ ‘Scared, Potter?’? You think I don’t know what that means?!”
“Don’t you hate me?” He asked bitterly.
“Nothing, Potter!! Can’t you see it? I want nothing to do with you. This. Whatever this is. It needs to stop.”
Draco’s teeth were clenched, annoyance evident on his face, “Like you really don’t know, Potter. Perfect Potter, always the golden boy.”
Harry slowly looked up to him, a question on his face.
Draco felt his breath hitch as he inhaled sharply. His face started to burn.
“Because of your eyes,” Harry heard, felt himself say, even though he had no idea the meaning or implications behind the words. He didn’t even know who the “she” that the little girl asked of was.
Harry didn’t really know how to respond. Malfoy had been watching him? He hadn’t even been acknowledging Harry’s existence in the past several weeks. No snide quips or disturbances of any kind. Nothing. So why watch him practice? He suddenly felt very tired.
Harry was hard, so very very hard. It almost ached how badly he wanted to be touched. His desire was so strong that he didn’t have room to feel any of the shame that typically came with being exposed. His libido only grew as Draco spit into his own hand, pausing to give Harry a devilish smirk before wrapping said hand around Harry’s member. He arched into the touch with a shuddering gasp, eyes closed and arms wrapped around the other boy’s neck.
The girl stepped away, a look of pain on her face.
Feeling either brave or careless, Draco hopped onto the railing and sat, one arm wrapped around a post for security as his feet dangled more than a hundred feet above the ground. He didn’t look down though, only up. It was a new moon this night, so the stars had ample opportunity to shine. He smiled to himself, letting his mind wander back to Harry.
Hermione huffed with indignation, “Then just tell us now! What happened Harry? Is Malfoy going to tell Umbridge about the Room? How much danger are we in?”
“You don’t need to cry,” she whispered, “My eyes are my own. So are yours.”
With his glasses askew, Harry looked almost like a lost child. “I need to figure this out. I don’t like not knowing. Please, help me.”
“Must’ve been someone else the idiot mistook for me. I’m not the only blond Slytherin, you know,” Draco sniffed, successfully covering up his panic. This is something that could never be discovered. Not by anyone, but especially not by someone like Longbottom.
“My own descent into madness, I suppose,” was his dour response. Pansy snorted.
Draco noticed this, “Getting sloppy with our hexes are we? How do you plan to defeat anyone if you can’t even land one hi…” Before Draco could finish his sentence, he was thrown onto his back by a spell Harry had cast silently. The wind was knocked out of him, and he fell on is back, groaning.
“I never said you were!” Draco retorted, balling his hands into fists. The situation was just now truly presenting itself to Draco, showing itself to him in clarity. This…this was not good.
When Draco saw Harry moving his things aside for him, he couldn’t help but feel a warmth spread throughout his entire body. He wanted to smile, but kept himself in check enough to sustain a cool indifference on his face.
12 years earlier:
“Good, then it’s agreed,” He turned to leave, but before he could exit through the doorway, he heard Harry call quietly out to him:
“Really Potter, don’t you think that’s a bit pitiful, hm?” Malfoy’s words were incandescently soft as his face got closer and closer to Harry’s. Harry’s lips were parted and his breathing haggard as Malfoy’s face moved closer to his.
“Yes!” she burst out after a moment, almost causing Draco to jump. He waited for her to continue, but she didn’t. Draco sighed, feeling impatience creeping into his mind.
“Excuse me?”
“I’m…so so sorry Draco,” Harry whispered between quiet tears. Draco could only nod and hold him, having forgiven him long ago for the sectumsempra curse.
“But if you did that, the world would no longer be blessed with my incredible eyes. Really, you’d just be damning yourself, Malfoy.” Harry shook his head and looked cooly at Malfoy, an easy smile spreading over the Gryffindor’s mouth.
He knew it was too dangerous to try. He knew nothing would ever come of his feelings, and that they were just a useless, painful fantasy. But still, they were Draco’s and they were real. No one could take his feelings and fantasies away from him; he wouldn’t let them.
He sighed, “I suppose I’m just worrying about everything. Between the DA, Umbridge, and Voldemort coming back, I’m just feeling overwhelmed.” It was a rather decent lie, because it wasn’t a lie at all.
“Yes, this,” he gestured between himself and Harry, “It will go nowhere. Fast. And you know it.”
“Oh! Harry..?” The voice was Hermione’s. Harry breathed out a laugh, undeniably relieved to see her.
“Explain what you meant when you said you wanted nothing to do with me.”
“Who… who was she?” Harry frowned in confusion, quickly forgetting what the little girl looked like. “Why, I can’t… I don’t know who she….”
More comfortable silence followed, the light of the fire casting amber light and dancing obsidian shadows all across the room.
Draco worked him slowly, teasingly deliberately, drinking in the moans and gasps that Harry produced with relish. Never in his wildest dreams did he think he would be hearing these noises. He reminded himself briefly to never forget them, because he’d probably never hear them again.
As the dream faded away, Harry swiftly forgot it, pushing it back into the catalogue of his mind to be lost and forgotten about. In the morning, it would be nothing but a nagging sensation.
“What the fuck, Potter?!” Draco groaned, clutching his ribcage where Potter had grabbed him. He glared at the dark haired boy, confusion written on his face. Potter matched his expression.
“Every second.” Draco had no idea who she was. Lys? Is that what he’d called her? He’d never known a Lys, never even heard the name.
Draco lounged across one of the armchairs that furnished the Slytherin common room, making sure to take up as much space as possible. He wondered how Potter had liked his little note? It may have been subtle, but Draco believed that subtly was much more intimidating than going into vivid details.
The sight of Harry’s tired, satisfied face as he tried to reclaim his breath caused a true smile to grace Draco’s face. A small smile, but a true one. He’d just blown Harry fucking Potter. He suppressed his urge to giggle uncontrollably at the thought.
“Draco, is that a blush I see on your face?” Pansy asked, the mirth dripping from her voice.
“As if. You did that long ago when you decided you prefer blokes instead of all this,” she gestured to her body, earning a playful slap on the arm from Theo.
Harry and Draco brushed their teeth together. Which would be fine, except their reflections in the mirror looked so strangely domestic that Harry felt as though he had to look away. This was
Harry grinned. “Probably. But she never specified.”
, he thought.
“There you are. Where the fuck have you been?”
Draco bit his lip and nodded. “Thank you.” He murmured.
And, once they’d both finished, Draco’s face pressed against the wall, and Harry’s hands on Draco’s hips, they collapsed onto the floor with a sigh. And then, they did it again on the floor. And again, against the window. And again, in Harry’s bed once they had the energy to make it that far, each time moaning “one more time”.
That evening, when he arrived back from dinner, he entered the Gryffindor common room and saw a rather large sign above the fireplace that read:
Harry rolled Draco over gently, and he was lying on top of him now, kissing him, his hands stroking Draco’s face, and Draco’s hands gripping Harry’s waist, but all the while it was slow. He took off his own shirt, dropping it onto the ground beside him, and pulled at the bottom of Draco’s top, but Draco broke their kiss.
Draco smiled. “You know, on second thought, why don’t I invite your friends myself?”
Draco laughed again. “I’ve been spending too much time with you, Harry, because that made perfect sense to me.”
Malfoy had seemed. And that had infuriated him. So, he had picked a fight. And another one. And another one. And another one. And, eventually, it had become a habit.
They sat smiling at each other for a long while.
Harry swallowed.
“No! No, it is. I… Um…” God, where would he even start?
Harry smiled. “You just need to talk to him about it.”
Draco looked exhausted and his voice was raspy as he spoke. “In two days.”
Harry’s heartbeat quickened and his mouth felt dry, but he could practically feel the heat coming off of Draco’s face, so he cleared his throat and smiled.

Draco rolled his eyes. “You know, it’s starting to seem as though you really
He didn’t last long. Neither of them did. They moaned each other’s names in ecstasy -
Despite the time limit that Shacklebolt had enforced, the man took his time to answer. “The Malfoys? I didn’t think you were in the business of talking to Death Eaters.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t help but notice that he didn’t
“Thank you, Professor.” Harry said, grinning. “It won’t happen again.”
Harry frowned. “You will?”
“Draco, we
Harry scoffed at the concept, and was shocked to hear a murmur of excitement spread throughout the Hall. Why would anyone agree to this? He looked over at Malfoy again, watching as his face screwed up in disgust. Harry was sure their expressions were rather similar at the moment.
Harry checked and found himself shocked. “Holy shit, it’s 2am. We slept for, like, 15 hours.”
As the room grew darker, so did their conversation. Harry wasn’t sure how they had gotten onto the topic, but they began talking about the war. Harry listened to what it was like on the other side of it, and he felt himself lean in closer to his friends, as though trying to tell them, “it’s okay, I’ve forgiven you, I would have done the same”, without actually saying it.
“That’s very irresponsible.” Hermione said, though Harry could see the laughter in her eyes.
“Listen, Harry,” Draco started, closing the door and turning to face Harry. “I can’t stay. I wish I could.”
Their second call was after dinner - to check up on each other, wishing each other a merry Christmas again, and hanging up the phone with smiles on their faces. But their third call was when reality set in.
Malfoy laughed. “Yeah, but this stuff isn’t rational. Seriously, don’t worry about it. It’s normal and you’ll be okay.” Malfoy gave Harry’s hand one last squeeze, then placed it down on the table with a smile.
“Oh, don’t worry, Harry. It’s not like it’s one-sided.”
Harry frowned. “I… I wasn’t…”

And, well, Harry supposed that if none of that brought the houses together, nothing would.
Harry and Draco grinned. “That’s easy for
“Hmm… my answer depends on how good this present is.”
blaming you.”
Hermione breathed out a quiet laugh, but Malfoy did not look amused. He rolled his eyes and ran a hand through his blonde hair, leaving it ruffled. Harry tried not to look at it.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “You very clearly have daddy issues, Potter.”
He heard Luna as she realised. She gasped beside him and nudged him. “Harry, look.”
Malfoy was grinning. “I swear, sometimes you don’t even remember that magic exists.” Harry frowned. “This is a magical restaurant, Potter.” Harry was still lost. “Everyone who comes in here is unrecognisable to the staff and the other customers. It’s brilliant magic, really.”
Harry cleared his throat. “I’ve been doing well. But, there’s not much to say, really. Your job seems much more interesting than mine.”
“What does that mean?” Harry had scoffed.
He heard Draco open his mouth, ready to protest again, but Harry wouldn’t let him. Instead, he kissed the scars gently, making sure to touch every single one. He hated himself for doing such awful things, but so did Draco. As unlikely a pairing as they were, they needed each other.
As they talked, the other Slytherins started pouring in, each of them frowning at the sight of Gryffindors in the common room. When the majority of Slytherin had eventually arrived, Draco stood up.
As they pulled away, Harry found himself looking at Draco’s lips again, just for a moment. He quickly looked away, but saw something that caught his eye and grinned.
Draco took the joint from Harry, breathed in and grabbed the back of Harry’s head. He yanked Harry’s face towards his own and breathed the smoke into Harry’s mouth, smirking afterwards at Harry’s shocked expression. Their faces were still so close when Draco put the joint in Harry’s mouth.
He had realised this when he had woken up after the Slytherin game night in Draco’s arms. At first, he had panicked, worried that Draco would be mad about Harry being in his bed and regretting drinking so much. But then, when Draco had woken up, his hair ruffled and his voice rough, and he had said, “Good morning”, and pulled Harry in closer, Harry knew he was in deep. He knew this because, when Draco eventually pulled away and smiled at Harry, saying “That was the best night’s sleep I’ve had in months”, Harry had agreed and wished Draco would hold him again.
“Theo owes me a few galleons.” Blaise said in triumph, which Seamus laughed loudly at.
“I’m sorry, Harry.” Draco whispered, tears falling slowly down his cheek. He turned around to leave, but took a breath and turned back towards Harry. He placed a kiss on his cheek, lingering for a few moments, and then sighed and turned back around, leaving Harry’s flat and placing his key on the table beside the door as he went.
to cry. Because he wasn’t pretending before, and he didn’t know how to pretend now. But, he couldn’t let Draco know that, so he nodded. “Okay.”
It had been a week since Harry and Malfoy’s ruse had started, and since then they had been casting obvious glances when passing each other in the halls, waiting for the rumours to spread. There had already been at least two newspaper articles written about them, detailing their “budding friendship” and questioning if Malfoy was really a “worthy companion of the Chosen One”. However, for once, Harry was enjoying the attention. It meant that soon enough he would be able to travel the corridors in peace, and wouldn’t have to deal with any more adoring first years.

Ron barked out a laugh. “Oh, please. Harry, this is
. He went back and forth in his mind a million times, his feet speeding up, his hand gripping his wand tightly until his knuckles turned white.
Everyone started speaking at once, and Harry sighed as he remembered that they all had to tell the truth. Slughorn looked overwhelmed at the response, and waited until everyone had finished talking to say, “One at a time!”
“You have to hex him.” She said, but thought for a moment. “Actually, you don’t
Draco must have noticed Harry looking at the tattoo, because he said, “My mother loves it. The tattoo, I mean.”

“Just…” Draco paused, and then sighed heavily. “Harry, what are we doing?”
Harry tried to stop his face from heating up, but he failed. He had a good time, but his hangxiety was making it hard to remember the fun of it. “What about last night?” He asked weakly.
She smirked. “I’m supposed to be helping him, if you must know.”
(See the end of the chapter for

As he approached Millicent, he watched as she looked up at him in confusion, her eyes wide.

Hermione cleared her throat and shifted uncomfortably in her seat. “Maybe I should go…”
Harry’s eyes widened. “So, that’s it? You don’t have any theories?”
“It must be.” Ron said, shock still evident on his face. “There’s no other explanation.”
“I’ll be here.” Draco said, his hand never wavering as it combed through Harry’s hair. “You’ll be okay.”
Harry sighed. He knew there was no good option, so he said, “Truth”.
“You know, I was thinking,” Harry whispered, his face still close to Draco’s. “If we want to really sell it, we need to make it look like we’ve been shagging all day.”
Draco shook his head and took a deep breath. “I do, Harry.” Harry tried to interject, but Draco kept on speaking. “Us being together doesn’t change what I’ve done.”
They had all made their way back up to the Gryffindor common room after dinner. The common room was full now, whereas they had basically had the place to themselves before (the common room was mostly empty after classes nowadays - Harry wasn’t sure why this was, but the Gryffindors seemed to be in the mood for a change of scene, finding new areas to study throughout the castle). The Slytherins had gotten a couple of nasty looks, but Harry had simply glared back at the other people in the common room and said something along the lines of, “if you’re not careful, I’ll be taking down that sign outside”, which was usually rather successful.
“You were watching me the other day, yeah? When I was practicing quidditch.”
“Harry, are you alright?” Hermione asked, her drink halfway to her mouth.
“Sod off Malfoy,” Potter grumbled, but there was no real anger in his voice. This made Draco smile.
“No, Hermione, it’s nothing like that,” Harry took a deep breath, controlling his hushed laughter, “It’s just… do you really think Malfoy has the balls to do that on school grounds? With Dumbledore running the place?” Harry was very adept in leaving out choice bits of information. He didn’t lie to Hermione, but he wasn’t telling her everything.
“Lumos,” Malfoy commanded, and once again they had light. Harry saw that there was a tired look in Malfoy’s eyes, but before he could comment on it, Draco continued:
“Come on Hermione, I may be ugly, but I’m not that ugly,” Harry sighed, absentmindedly popping a grape into his mouth.
He waited to open the note until he was in the safety of his dorm and lying on his bed. Draco unraveled it to display the message:
“Harry, you alright mate?” Ron whispered, leaning in towards Harry, concern evident in his voice.
Harry turned sharply on his heels to be faced with none other than Hermione. He huffed out a short breath, blowing his bangs up briefly.
“Enjoying the view, Potter?” The serenity that Harry felt was rudely destroyed by the cutting voice that Harry was all too familiar with. Malfoy. Harry didn’t even want to turn to face him as the blond approached.
The dark haired girl groaned and closed her book. She stared pointedly at Draco, familiar with this game of his. “Ok Draco, you don’t have to tell me. In fact, it would probably be better if you didn’t. I’m simply dreadful at keeping secrets, as you know.” She donned an expression of mock sympathy, putting more whine than was natural into her voice. Hoping that Draco picked up on her sarcasm.
The boy shuddered, suddenly bothered by the cold engulfing him. He needed to get back inside. He needed to stop watching Potter and his entrancing broomwork. He needed to sleep.
Harry was restless. He had been all day since he’d concocted this plan. His legs bounced nervously as he sat on the couch the Room of Requirement had provided him with. He hadn’t known quite what it was he’d be needing, but the room did. The room always knew.
“Who said I’m going to tell Umbridge?”
Draco could barely speak, but he managed to choke out, “Her. She’s gone, Harry.” Potter sat down in front of Draco, grabbing a hold of his hands.
Harry dreamt of someone faceless. He dreamt that someone faceless guided him out of a dark undergrowth into a field, where trees bearing sweet-smelling blossoms grew. He laid down under one of the trees, and the faceless person joined him, gently grasping his hand. The faceless person’s hands were pale and cool, refreshing in the warmth of the dream. The being came closer to Harry until it was leaning over him. For some reason Harry didn’t feel threatened at all, in fact, he couldn’t feel more safe. He closed his eyes and felt the chilling hands of the being brush the hair away from his forehead, gently grazing over his scar. His breath hitched, and as he opened his eyes, more details started to appear on the being’s face. Whoever it was looked so familiar, yet Harry couldn’t place it. Right when the details were becoming clear, Harry awoke with a start.
Once Ron managed to calm down, he helped Harry up and they made their way to the infirmary, just to make sure it was nothing serious. Madame Pomfrey gave them a solemn stare as they explained what happened.
“Relax, Potter,” Draco smirked, “I’ve been told that I’m quite good at this.”
His pants were getting tighter with each twitch of his member. Draco gasped delicately, palming himself over the fabric of his trousers. The way that Potter – that Harry had looked at him earlier was almost too much for Draco. It was as if Harry was a wolf fixing to devour him. There was something deliciously predatory about the way Harry’s eyes had gazed at him.
He heard the sound of tired feet walking down the steps of the girls’ side of the dorms, and tensed automatically. Interaction with a random Gryffindor girl was something he didn’t particularly need at the moment.
Hiya. This chapter is a little bit late because I like to write a chapter ahead before I publish, and chapter six is a doozy. There is also smut in this. Steamy. Yessiree. I went to a bar/club for the first time last night. It was hot and sweaty and sexual and absolutely fantastic.
“I – well I…” Harry stammered, unsure if there was any real danger or not, “I’m not entirely sure.”
“Harry,” Draco said in a tone more firm, sitting up as Harry slowly got off of him.
Draco took one look at Harry and sighed dejectedly, allowing his shoulders to slump ever so slightly. “Look,” He began, “I’m sure that I can understand where your paranoia is coming from. But I still think you’re being a touch ridiculous.”
When Malfoy left the Room of Requirement, Harry let out a breath that he hadn’t noticed he’d been holding. What in the bloody hell just happened? Before he could feel anything else, anxiety overtook him: what if Malfoy was going to tell Umbridge anyway? What if everything was for nothing? Why had Malfoy said he wouldn’t tell in the first place? Harry scowled at the idea of doing anything for the blond brat, much less whatever the ferret chooses.
“Don’t make me puke, Pansy,” Theo retorted, making a foul looking face. This just caused the girl to giggle with even more vigor. Draco didn’t say anything, which was a first, especially with the topic being Potter.
His eyes followed Potter throughout their entire practice. He didn’t even realise he was staring for so long. The breezed rolled easily against his skin, tingeing his cheeks pink.
Harry chuckled as Malfoy draped himself against a column. Yes, this interaction was definitely different. There wasn’t any real aggression on either of their parts. Harry almost wished it could be like this more often. This thought scared him, and Harry reminded himself that Malfoy wasn’t to be trusted. ‘He could be trying to get your guard down. He could be trying to get you not to suspect him. Trying to get your trust.’ With these thoughts and others suddenly taking back control of his mind, he quickly decided to sober up.
“Oh no, you’re crying,” the little girl’s voice seemed to bring him back to himself, and the time around them started again. She reached out to his face, and rubbed at the tears with the heels of her palms.
“Yes you’re truly the worst at it. Which is why I’m not going to tell you a single thing. This is something that absolutely mustn’t be spread about.” Draco seemed to be quite pleased with himself. Until Blaise spoke,
“I suppose, as far as my eyes handling blood goes, it’s all a matter of who the blood’s coming from. From you Malfoy? My eyes would have no problem handling it.”
Draco chuckled darkly, moving ever closer to Potter, “That’s what you’d like to think isn’t it? But I’d make it so quick that you wouldn’t have time to even think.”
“Draco, I’m… I’m close Draco,” was all he could stutter out. He barely had enough energy to breathe. It felt as if Draco was sucking the very life-force out of him. Draco simply hummed in response. The pressure in Harry’s body built and tumbled inside of him, glowing like a white-hot ember, until it exploded.
‘Scared, Potter?’
Harry scoffed, “And can you blame me?”
Draco’s breathing became heavy, the lust and tentative euphoria he normally withheld taking control of him. “I won’t,” he promised before pressing his lips into Harry’s.
“You never come home anymore. I miss you.” Draco felt his heart swell. He swiftly scooped her up into his arms and held her close.
“In the woods?”
Green eyes blinked at him, taking in the sight of Draco’s silhouette.
Pansy had tried to get Draco to join in on whatever drunken maddness was taking place, but he declined, using unfinished homework as an excuse to escape to the library. It wasn’t that Draco didn’t enjoy his fair share of intoxicated endeavors every now and then, it was just that he didn’t trust his drunken tongue during this particualr time. Especially after all the feelings he could barely contain under a sober mind. And seeing everyone else have fun with whatever booze they managed to scrounge up just put him in a foul mood, so he decided the best course of action was to just vacate the entire Slytherin dorm.
“Pansy please, do us all a favor and shut your yapping hole,” Draco whispered harshly, grinding his teeth. The girl reeled back, an offended look on her face. Blaise and Theo could hardly contain their laughter. Snape continued to ignore them.
Lmao sorry it's been so long since i've updated this fic, it's still active though I promise. Enjoy.
“You wound me, Potter!”
“I suppose I do,” Harry murmured, running a hand through his hair. He got his glasses and put them back on unceremoniously. Anything to avoid interacting more with Malfoy.
“Oh nothing,” Draco sighed, recovering from his burst of laughter, “It’s just that the infamous Harry Potter just received head from the son of Lucius Malfoy. That’s all.”
Feeling listless, Draco gathered his things slowly as the class was dismissed, other students swarming to get out of the classroom. He got up and mixed in with the crowd, but startled when he felt something aggravate a pocket of his robe. Immediately he shoved his hand inside, only to feel a crumpled up piece of paper. Draco looked up, and was met with a shocking pair of green eyes, glancing at him knowingly from the room’s doorway. Potter had just slipped him a bloody note. Draco didn’t know the git was capable of such stealth.
Harry glared at Malfoy, daring him to throw a hex his way, “It doesn’t even matter if you tell Umbridge about this room, you lot won’t be able to get in.”
Ginny lazily chucked a pillow at Ron and it hit him in the face. “Shut up. You say that as if Harry wasn’t the one who started shagging all of the Slytherins in the first place.”
Pansy opened her mouth to speak, but she was interrupted by the door to the living room being pushed open and Ginny walking in with a yawn, rubbing her eyes as she went. Her eyebrows raised as she saw who was in the room.
Malfoy was still leading him, and Harry found himself rather impressed by how well he was doing, considering Harry was quite possibly the worst partner one could ask for. “I don’t owe you anything, Potter. I just saved you from expulsion. If anything, you owe me.”
“Just… get to the part where my father speaks.”
Malfoy laughed. “Exactly. Basically all of the Pureblood Slytherins, to be honest.” Wow, there really was a theme here. “And, you.”
“Guess what mum just told me?” Ron said, a look of horror on his face.
“Then my answer is no.”
Maybe it was obvious.
. He heard a few hollers, people gasping and laughing, and then he heard people running to follow him. He made his way out of the common room, running as fast as possible, hoping that if he ran fast enough, they wouldn’t actually
this way. Draco’s friends seemed to clock Seamus and Dean’s relationship in a second, both whispering “fucking finally” and explaining that the Slytherins took bets on who would end up together.
“Neither were these adorable little nicknames we’ve come up with, but it seems those will be sticking,
“You don’t have to drink the Veritaserum if you don’t want to.” Draco said, his voice booming over the chatter in the room. “And for the younger years, I’ll be trusting you to tell the truth without the potion.” He smiled. “I can’t go around drugging children, after all.” He grinned and picked up the bottle of Firewhiskey that Hermione had given him. He spoke as he picked up the vial of Veritaserum and poured it into the whiskey. “I’ll be passing this around. If you want it, take a sip. If not, pass it along.”
But, Harry
Harry’s smile widened. He started to jump into his jeans, but his vision was slightly blurry and he misjudged where he was going. He gasped as he lurched forward, but Draco grabbed his shoulders, steadying him, his hands warm on Harry’s bare skin.
“Who would have thought?” Draco said, his voice slightly rough with unshed tears. “Malfoy and Potter bonding over their trauma.”
“Wait, Harry, leave it on.”
“No problem, Harry.” There was such a fondness in Hermione’s eyes that Harry almost had to look away in fear of crying at the sight of them. “It was so nice to see you tonight. I know it can’t have been easy for you.”
Draco nodded. “They apparently don’t know any. I wonder why that is.” He rolled his eyes. “They’re clueless.”
, and then she said, “For the rest of the year.”
Ron scoffed. “Mate, we’ll choose you every time.” His tone got serious all of a sudden. “He’s different… from what I thought he would be. But, no. It’s fine. I don’t mind.”
Draco smirked, although his face looked softer than it usually did from the booze and weed. “Oh really?” He whispered seductively, his thumb still caressing Harry’s cheek. “And how do you propose we do that?”
“What’s stopping you?”
And Malfoy looked angry.
“He’s working with the guys on the night shift. Seems to be a big deal, too.”
had just happened.
Harry laughed. “Well, this has gone surprisingly well.”
As I'm writing this, I'm realising that there's hardly any angst in here! I honestly don't care, because I'm loving this fluff too much!!
Draco nodded slowly and his hand started moving on Harry’s thigh again, which Harry was extremely grateful for.
She was past the point of being shocked now. Every time Harry sat her down, she would prepare herself for the worst, and anything below that was easy to deal with. So, when he explained the situation, she raised her brows but nodded anyway.
Draco practically jumped with happiness. He almost knocked Harry over as he grabbed him and hugged him,
He had expected a cheaper version of the Yule Ball and most of the seniors to have passed on the event, but he instantly realised how wrong he had been. The majority of the senior years were attending, and McGonagall had clearly gone all out in the way of decorations.
Malfoy’s smile wasn’t polite - it seemed genuine, and open, and he looked more warm and freckled and oh, god, Harry was staring again. “It’s been lovely. You know, the sun and the warmth - you just can’t beat it.”
I'm so excited to post more but I'm still working on the next few chapters!
as he took a bite, and he looked at Harry with such lust that Harry thought he would die right on the spot, and,
They had each started to turn in for the night gradually - some of them yawning and stretching before smiling at the others and going to bed. When Hermione had started to make her way upstairs, he had hugged her and wished her a merry Christmas again.
Draco nodded.
Harry waited another moment and then stood up rather dramatically, scraping the bench backwards and storming off. He slammed the doors to the Great Hall as hard as he could behind him, the resounding
Harry was finding these favours rather fun, really.
Harry’s eyes widened and his heart sped up. Draco was avoiding his gaze, a blush on his cheeks. Harry could feel Pansy’s triumph coming from beside him, but all he could focus on was trying to breathe through this new information.
Harry was on his way back from the Great Hall when he saw him. That flash of blonde hair around the corner.
Harry found himself getting very drunk very fast and, by the time it was his turn to spin the bottle, he wasn’t playing very tactically. He spun without thinking, without judging where it was going to land. And, when it landed on Draco, he could barely hear the yells of excitement over the ringing in his ears.
Harry nodded slowly. “Are you happy?”
Harry pulled away when he heard Pansy’s voice, and his eyes widened.
Draco laughed, but it wasn’t the laugh that Harry had heard so many times before. It was humourless. And sad. “No, you idiot. You’re not listening. I want a divorce, but I still want
Harry nodded. “Yeah, it was definitely a stag.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “You should have seen your guys’ faces. It was pure fear.”
Harry breathed out a laugh, but Pansy looked anything but amused. “You’re not going anywhere.”
“It’s not.”
Harry felt his eyes fill up with tears and he forced himself to hold them back. He swallowed and nodded. “Thank you.” He whispered. “Draco…” He had so much he wanted to say to Draco about how he had forgiven him and how, in his moment of clarity when he was dead, he had also thought of Draco. Of how much he deserved forgiveness. But Draco shook his head before he could continue.
“Come in.” Harry called out.
Harry laughed. “I wonder who it is.”
He tried a few times. But, every single time, without fail, some students would snicker and Malfoy would frown at Harry’s greetings and leave. Which is why Harry had finally reached the end of his patience when it happened.
There was a long silence where no one spoke, but Blaise eventually sighed and said, “Well, fuck, mentioning the war sure does make everyone a bit less
Malfoy’s smile widened slightly as he spoke again. “Shall we go?” He said, offering up his arm for Harry to take.
Tracey raised her eyebrows. “Can you do it?”
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but Harry’s stomach grumbled loudly and cut off whatever Draco was about to say. Harry gave Draco an apologetic smile, and Draco sat up, smirking. “Time to go to breakfast, Harry.”
Harry sighed. It’s not that he minded being naked, really. It’s not like he had anything to hide. It’s just that… Well,
Arthur stood up, smiling as he did so. He nodded to each of them, moving to shake their hands. “I’m glad you’re all here.” He said, and the smile on his face suggested that he really
Harry felt Draco’s smirk as he kissed him again and again, his voice rough as he ground out, “Shut up and take your clothes off.”
Harry and Draco had bid them all farewell, neither of them mentioning the fact that both of them should likely be leaving, too. By this point, the only other students in the common room were sixth and seventh years who were still in the midst of studying.
Of course, Harry had also revealed some things about himself that he would have rathered stayed secret.
“It started when winter did.”
“Where the fuck did you get Veritaserum?” Harry asked Draco quietly as the Firewhiskey was passed around.
Harry was about to tell them that he would leave, but Malfoy spoke first, maintaining eye contact with Harry as he talked.
“Nothing plain, I want the most interesting drink you can think of.” Malfoy smiled. “Just make it up as you go along, really.”
“What is it, Hermione?”
Harry’s voice was basically a whisper as he said, “Yes, I do.”
Ron scoffed. “You want
“It’s worth it.” Harry smiled. “What can I get for you tonight?”
Draco straightened his back and looked up at Harry, looked into his eyes. There was no fear in his eyes anymore… There was nothing in his eyes anymore. He had put his walls back up, he didn’t show any emotion. “It’s okay.” He said, his voice firm. “I’ll be fine. We just… have to end this.”
“Who are you taking to the ball, Harry?”
Malfoy must have sensed what he was about to say, because he held a finger to Harry’s lips, silencing his words (and his breathing) before nodding ever so slightly to his right. Harry followed his movement with his eyes, Malfoy’s finger still against his lips, and realised what was happening.
Draco looked down at his hands, fiddling with his fingernails. No one spoke for a minute.
“What was that?” Draco said, turning to Harry, faux amazement in his eyes. “I didn’t quite catch that, could you say it again?”
Theo was grateful when Harry told him how it had gone, and Neville had given him a pleased smile, beaming from across the common room. They were in the Slytherin common room this time, all lying across the sofas and across each other. The younger years seemed to always leave these sofas free now, saying that was “where the Gryffindors sat”, and Harry wished that they would keep doing this - leaving empty seats for other houses - after the eighth years had left. It was light and warm, and everyone seemed to be smiling as they took in the warmth for the fire. They were soaking up the last few days before the winter holidays. It was their last winter at Hogwarts and Harry was making the most of it.
They played for a little while longer before people started to leave. The seventh years were the first to go, and then the Gryffindors until, finally, only Harry, Draco and Blaise remained. Pansy and Ginny had already left earlier in the evening, both of them making their way to Pansy’s room with smiles on their faces and Seamus cheering them on.
Harry already regretted agreeing to this. Of course Draco would ask for the information that Harry didn’t want to tell him. He took a deep breath and reached for the bottle that was lying on the bed between them and took a sip.
“You guys know there are more seats, right?” Harry asked, with amusement in his voice.
“Don’t be silly, Harry.” Hermione said. “We love you. We just want to make sure you’re okay.”
“You should be on holiday or something, Potter. You need a break. Or at least a day off, for fuck’s sake.”
“Ron!” Hermione whispered harshly at him and Harry knew what was coming next.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and squeezed it tightly. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I’m sorry you had to go through that.”
They shook their head. “No.”

day. He was finally going to tell him. Harry Potter was about to confess his love for Draco Malfoy. For the first time ever.
have a rather significant connection. Because, Harry realised, he could very easily tell when Malfoy was lying.
Blaise tilted his head to the side. “Although, I suppose that could be avoided if we just woke up on time.”
Christmas went by in a blur, full of celebrations, gifts, food and Draco. It was the same as every year, apart from the fact there was one less laugh at the table, one less mouth to feed and one less jumper for Molly to knit. Well, Harry supposed, that wasn’t entirely true. Much to Harry’s surprise, Molly had knitted Draco a Slytherin green jumper with his initial on it and had told Harry to “make sure the Malfoy boy gets it”. Harry tried not to read too much into this, tried not to think about the fact that she didn’t even knit
Harry rolled his eyes, but continued anyway, ensuring his voice was as quiet as possible. “I need you to… pretend that we’re dating.” Harry said it in a rush, trying to stop himself from blushing and ultimately failing.
Draco swallowed and Harry felt it against his skin. “I forgave you the moment you did it. It may not have seemed like it, but that was a… A turning point. At least, in my head, it was. Because, when I was lying on that ground, all I could think about was how much I…” Draco took a deep breath and Harry waited as he exhaled shakily. “All I could think about was how much I deserved it in that moment.” Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Draco said, “Wait,” and he closed his mouth quickly. “I know what you want to say, Harry, but it… It helped me figure things out.” He sighed. “That was the moment that I decided that I would do the bare minimum to ensure my, and my family’s, survival.” His voice was a whisper now, but he was so close that Harry didn’t even have to strain to hear him. “And that was the moment that I decided that, if your side won, I would work on changing. I used to be awful to you, Harry.” He took a shaky breath. “Oh, merlin, I was so awful to Granger. And Weasley. But, when I was lying there, thinking I might die, it was like… a moment of clarity.”
And with that, he walked to the Gryffindor table and sat down next to his friends, who were both looking as though they were about to faint.
, really. And, now that he’s gone, she’s much happier. She would divorce him if it wouldn’t leave us penniless.”
The second time, he had called out his name and Malfoy had turned around, an odd look in his eyes. He had gotten so close to him, prepared to speak, when McGonagall had seen them and told them to be on their way before they started fighting.
Harry smiled. “I’m really happy for you.”
Draco grinned. “Any time, Harry.”
“Have you ever cheated on someone?” He asked, his gaze cold.
Harry, not keep him in bed for another week.” Harry laughed at that. “Let’s go smuggle you some hot chocolate, Harry.”
they were

Draco leaned in closer to Harry, his voice low. “Pansy
Hermione sighed deeply with a frown on her face. “Look, I know neither of you want to admit it, but you
pick the dares, I’m not ‘keeping it PG’.”
Pansy rolled her eyes and swallowed her food before speaking. “Yes, you absolute buffoon. You have to go meet Draco in the Slytherin common room tonight to help him organise the game night.”
So, Harry stood up, holding onto his bed for support, before making his way into the hallway. He knew that Molly had made up a room for the Slytherins, right beside where Harry and Ron and Hermione were sleeping. He also knew that Pansy was in Ginny’s room tonight, and Blaise was still in the living room with Charlie, his soft laughs travelling up to Harry’s ears. Which meant that Draco was alone in his room. And Harry
“What the fuck, mate?” Seamus said, shaking his head.
“Did the rumours bother you?” Harry asked, more for his sake than Luna’s.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Not like that, Pans.” He sighed. “Harry’s been asked to split up the Sacred 28.”
Eventually, they asked Harry what it was like on the front lines. He breathed out a nervous laugh and said, “We were all on the front lines”, and they all rolled their eyes and told him to stop deflecting. He knew he could trust them, but he wasn’t used to speaking about it. He supposed it was good for them all, to realise that they weren’t in it alone. So, he started by telling them about Sirius. He didn’t really know where else to start, and he knew that they could relate the most to him. And then, he told them about Voldemort and how he had survived each time.
“You should be getting back.” Draco said quietly, as though he were trying not to disturb the silence of the room. “Your family will be wondering where you are.”
“Let me guess - surprise you?”
“Sunny.” Draco said. “I’m not used to the rain.”
He looked at Malfoy with his brow furrowed, a question on his lips.
, he said to himself. But then… Then, he saw Draco’s face. He saw the crease between his eyebrows and the way the corners of his mouth and his eyes seem to droop, everything weighed down by… Sadness. “Wh… What’s wrong?” Harry asked, his voice deep with worry.
He turned towards Draco. He decided that if he didn’t say something now, he would likely regret it later. “How are we going to act around them? I mean, are we supposed to just stay silent for the next week around our entire year?”
“I can’t make any promises, Potter.”
Before leaving the Great Hall to go back to the eighth year common room, he gave Malfoy one last glance and, feeling half the school’s eyes on him as he stood up, winked at him, grinned, and began to walk away as he heard a murmur of whispers spread through the hall.
to say,” Harry said, “You weren’t the one who had to go streaking.”
“Wait!” Harry said, and he found himself cursing himself, yet again, for speaking before thinking.
“What do we do?” Draco whispered.
right now. And it took him a further second to realise that he needed to get off of him right the fuck now.
But he didn’t. He couldn’t.
Harry decided not to think too much about this. They might as well have fun this year, considering all their other years at Hogwarts were so terrible. And, if having fun like this felt this good and kept girls from following Harry around, it couldn’t be so bad.
By dinner time, half of Hogwarts had heard about Harry’s recent activities with multiple Slytherins, and the Great Hall was full of chatter. Hermione and Ron’s faces were full of caution at the volume of the room, but they could sense the change in the atmosphere, so they took their time while eating.
“What the fuck?” Harry hissed at him. “You definitely owe me an answer about that bloody tattoo now.”
Harry smiled. “Sounds good to me.”
breakfast people when guests are over.” Narcissa said, frowning and handing a plate of pancakes and fruit over to Draco. “Please, Harry, sit down and help yourself.”
Harry smiled and Ron nodded, his voice surprisingly upbeat. “Yeah, Blaise has been really good to talk to. It’s weird, but, it’s… nice.” He started piling up his plate. “It’s kind of a relief, really. It’s one less thing about this year that’s bad. You know, now we don’t have to fight them.”
Harry didn’t know what to say, or where to look, so he cleared his throat and looked into the blonde’s eyes, trying to ignore his chest and his wet hair and

is talking about. Or
Harry smiled. “Theo. You can call me Harry.”
They both stared at each other for a moment before each breathing out a laugh at the ridiculousness of their use of last names. It was comfortable, and it was…
The door shut behind the two, and the noise from outside quietened slightly. Harry could tell that Draco was rather drunk, too, because, instead of being furious at this turn of events, he started laughing. Rather uncontrollably, really. And Harry had no clue what to do, but Draco’s laughter was quite infectious, so he started laughing, too.
“Sam better have been saying all good things about me.” Malfoy said after their laughs had calmed down.
Harry tried to give Malfoy a small smile, but he couldn’t manage it.
“My place?” He asked breathlessly.
She turned back to face Harry and walked towards him, an odd sort of casual elegance about her. She placed her hands on his shoulders and placed a gentle kiss on his cheek, as though they had known each other their whole lives. Then, she lowered her voice, smiled sweetly and said, “If you hurt him I’ll kill you.”
“When I looked up, I saw the man standing there, in my room, this time. My parents weren’t there anymore - they had likely left once I had fallen asleep - and the man was smiling at me again. His eyes were… crazy. He was about to kill me, I felt it in my bones. I couldn’t scream, his hands were stopping any noise coming out of my mouth.”
He found himself speeding up slightly and had to remind himself that he
Harry chuckled. “Exactly.”
Slughorn seemed at a loss for words. “Right. Umm… well, I see.” His voice was unsure as he spoke. “Oh… Oh, well, all of you should be on your way. Umm… Including you, Harry. Understandable, of course, but… Best be off, now.”
They were both sitting in the library, at Malfoy’s usual table. Although the surrounding tables had started to fill up more ever since they started being seen there together, the library was mostly empty, aside from a couple of other students that were sitting on the other side of the library. It was late at night and only eighth years had 24 hour access to the library. The lights were rather low, bright enough to read the books on the table, but still provided students with a level of privacy that many eighth years used to their advantage (particularly couples).
“Honestly, it’s ridiculous. They’re all acting like children.” Hermione said, rolling her eyes as she did so.
Ron rolled his eyes and grumbled something about “all these bloody Slytherins”, but he didn’t say anything more.
Malfoy shrugged. “Who knows? Maybe you’re more of a creep than you thought.”
happier. She never struck me as the ‘I left you boys some snacks’ type.”
Hermione nodded, a smile on her face. “I’ll be going home. Of course, I’ll be back on Christmas with my parents.”
Draco smiled and ushered them all onto the sofas, sitting next to Harry. “The others should be coming down soon. It’s best to be early to these things, otherwise you end up on the floor.”
“This isn’t safe, Harry. We’re clearly both at risk here.” He pointed to his face, which was bruised and had some nasty cuts on it. At least he had washed off the blood, so he didn’t look so bad anmore. Harry knew that he probably looked much worse right now.
Harry was sure that Draco would be rolling his eyes right now if they were open. “Yes, yes. We’ll keep it in mind.”
Draco pulled away slightly, his grip on Harry’s waist loosening slightly, so Harry gave him a bit of room and sat up slightly, still on top of him.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, said goodbye to Draco, and prepared to visit Malfoy Manor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded, although he still found it difficult to believe that they were talking about Malfoy right now.
Harry turned his head to look at her. “Well, she looks shocked
Except, it
“Yeah.” He said, nodding. “Yeah, it could have been a doe.”
Draco took a deep breath. “Merlin. Okay.” He exhaled sharply and levitated the paper over. He looked at it for a moment, before seemingly deciding that was too much, and held it out to Harry. “Could you… could you read it to me? I don’t think I can do it.”
Death Eater.”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “That was a shit start.” She murmured, a look of disappointment on her face.
Harry sighed. “Well, maybe I’ll get to meet Pansy again, start over once she comes back from France. That’d be nice, I think. And after all, I would love to get along with someone else who likes men and women.” Harry’s eyes widened.
“You don’t need to apologise.” He said against Harry’s hair. “What’s wrong?”
“What?” He exclaimed, the crease between his brows so deep it was starting to hurt his head.
Harry cleared his throat. “I never would have seen that coming.”
Ron and Hermione nodded, both of them frowning.
Harry realised how right Hermione had been. He and Malfoy
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “Really?”
Harry blinked. Draco had never acknowledged the Weasleys as his family before. “Yeah, it’s… it’ll be nice to see them.”
“Not at all, you’re just jealous that you never get to go anywhere,” Pansy snarked back, gathering her things and standing up. Draco followed suit, and wondered how Paris would be at Christmas time. He’d been to Paris plenty of times with his family, but never during Christmas.
Silence followed as Malfoy stood above Harry, a curious stare enveloping the both of them. After several moments, Malfoy spoke:
“…But we both know that this is going nowhere. And it’s going nowhere fast,” Draco continued as if Harry hadn’t spoken, “I think it would be wise for both of our sakes if we just nip this in the bud. If we stop this before it even begins.”
With his confidant mood diminished, Draco sat up, masking his unease with a calculating snarl. “Are you quite finished?”
Devilishly, Draco smirked as he responded, “Oh? What, Potter, were you hoping that I had some sinister motive?” Even in the dark the blond could tell that the other boy was beginning to blush.
“Yes, in fact I think you are,” Draco snapped, growing irritated with where the conversation had gone, “Contrary to what you’ve convinced yourself to be true, I don’t sit in my room all day, wringing my hands and thinking up ways to unnerve you. I really don’t give a damn about Umbridge or that bloody room you slink off to.”
“We need to be all the more cautious still. Things have been going easily so far, and I’d like to keep it that way,” Hermione said with a sniff.
And with that, Draco’s mouth descended slowly onto Harry. In response to the sudden hot, wet pressure that surrounded him, Harry tossed his head back, staring at the ceiling. Since he was without his glasses, it was quite a blurry ceiling, but that didn’t really matter since he wasn’t registering anything but the sensation of Draco’s mouth around his cock anyway.
So preoccupied with his thoughts was he, that he didn’t see the column directly in front of him. He walked into it full force, successfully banging his nose into stone with full force.
He worked his hand up and down Harry’s shaft, illiciting moan after moan from Harry. ‘Who knew the Chosen One was so vocal?’ he thought to himself wryly. Soon Harry started to get impatient, bucking into Draco’s hand. Draco stopped working on Harry’s neck and slowly started to move down the boy’s body, stopping where his hand had been working.
“It’s probably nothing…” Neville had mumbled, eyes flickering nervously over to Harry.
“I did,” Draco whispered. Harry looked at him, his eyes widened. Draco knew the question on his mind. “I knew I loved you, but I assumed you didn’t feel the same way. Especially after everything that ended up happening,” with this, Draco absentmindedly brought a hand up to trace over the scars on his chest. Harry felt his stomach churn.
“Please tell me I’m not about to get ambushed, Potter,” Malfoy drawled, a whisper of a smile on his mouth.
So caught in all the reasons why Potter was deplorable, that Draco didn’t even notice where he was. As he started to round a corner, he spotted a familiar head of black, shaggy hair. Potter. He was looking around cautiously before a door appeared and he entered it. Draco’s eyes widened. So that’s where Potter and his herd got off to.
Draco wanted to scream. He wanted to scream so loudly that he’d never be able to speak again. Fucking Harry fucking Potter. Draco had never wanted to punch the glasses off of someone’s face more.
About a week had passed since Draco had talked with Potter in the library, and he’d managed to keep his emotions in check since then. But here, on the Astronomy tower, with the night wind blowing against his face, it was difficult not to think of those devious green eyes. He wanted so badly to see them up close again.
“I wasn’t,” Draco spoke softly, “Not really. I just wanted to be alone, and you just so happened to be in the middle of quidditch practice. I may have absentmindedly followed you with my eyes but… I didn’t plan on watching you.”
Dinners at the Gryffindor table were always something to behold. There would be loud conversations overlapping and competing with one another, light-hearted arguments that would almost always end with food being thrown around playfully, and obnoxious snooping for who got what on what assignment. Overall, it was a pretty great time if one was in the mood for it.
Admittedly, he relished in being alone at times like these. Here, he didn’t have to worry about blemishing the carefully constructed image he had. He could act however he wanted to. Honestly, it was always in these moments that he felt most reliable within himself.
“Well there’s obviously not nothing-”
“Sod off, Malfoy,” Harry groaned, resting his head in a hand.
Crossing his legs, Draco let out a small breath of relief. Until Pansy added, “For now.” He glared at her, but she was already back to reading her book. He groaned internally, turning to face out the windows of the common room. They looked out into the Great Lake that Hogwarts was built next to. It was always relaxing to stare at whatever happened to be passing the thick glass panes by at the moment, swimming lazily.
Their heated fumblings in the dark continued as Malfoy dropped his wand to the ground and they were left in total black. Somehow, Malfoy’s hand had found its way into Harry’s pants and was stroking his member. Harry was practically mewling, quietly begging Malfoy to keep going.
“I can’t. I’m anxious.”
Harry came with a cry that sounded desperate and mournful and exhausted all at once. Draco didn’t let go until he was finished, swallowing everything in heavy, rich gulps. The dark-haired boy’s body lied exhausted and spent beneath him, slowly recovering from the harsh burst of ecstasy.
Harry narrowed his eyes at the blond, suspicion evident in his eyes. He didn’t trust Malfoy one bit, but there wasn’t all that much he could do to stop him if he decided to tell Umbridge.
Draco whipped his body around to see Potter staring at him, terror written on his face, in his eyes. He ran over to the Slytherin, dropping the homework he’d brought with him. As fast as he could, Potter wrapped his arms around Draco and yanked him off the rail, causing them to fall back onto one another. They landed thickly on the stone floor, neither boy escaping pain.
When Malfoy finally started to calm down enough to speak, he responded: “If you somehow manage to get all my teeth and turn them into a necklace, then I’ll just glue your eyelids shut in retaliation. It’s only fair, you know. And you won’t need your glasses anymore either!” Harry allowed himself a wry smile.
“Oh.” Potter gingerly pulled back. Draco felt as though he had gotten the answer wrong to a question he didn’t even know was being asked.
“Well Ron, I just broke my bloody nose, so no, I don’t think I’m alright.”
Harry blinked, not sure if the interaction he’d just had with Malfoy was real. He felt like he’d done something wrong, even though every logical part of his brain told him otherwise. He’d never had a reason to trust Malfoy before, so why let himself be tricked into starting now?  No, this whole thing was a touch too unbearable for Harry’s taste. Still, there was something that was bothering Harry that he couldn’t quite place. It was as if he was forgetting something that he didn’t even know about.
Draco shook his head gently, a remorseful grin stretched across his face. “Do you remember, Harry? Do you remember everything that happened?”
“Three hours give or take. It’s around nine now.”
Hermione hummed, staring into the fire with a distant look in her eyes.
Harry remained passively silent for the rest of dinner, his mind taking up most of his attention span. He didn’t want to think about this now, not whilst he was awake. He forced all thoughts of Malfoy to the back of his mind and was able to act like his normal self until he got ready for bed.
Pissed off and groaning, Harry gathered his things and made his way up to the Gryffindor dorms, mentally preparing himself for that night’s DA meeting.
“Fuck,” however, was all he could manage.
“ ‘This’?” Harry asked, even though he knew it was a stupid question. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Harry,” Draco started before he was cut off,
Harry knelt down so that he was eye level with her, “They’re your eyes, little doe.” And he kissed her gently on the forehead.
“I could say the same for you,” he finally responded, his eyes locking onto hers. She smiled shyly.
Hermione cast an easy smirk Harry’s way as she added, “Almost.”
Draco’s slumber was not dreamless, as he had hoped. The moment he had faded into sleep, a dream emerged out of the darkness.
“Hello Hermione.”
Draco was frustrated. He had been ever since the night he went to the Room of Requirement with Harry. He’d luckily been able to keep it all inside, under a mask and go about his days like he was just as aloof and disdainful as he always was. He purposely never even looked in the direction of Potter, and he was making it a point not to say anything about the boy to his friends. They would just act like twats about it anyway.
Draco felt his heart beating in his throat. Was…was Potter actually flirting with him? He chuckled almost nervously, trying to collect himself.
Realizing what Draco was about to do, Harry froze, not daring to breathe. He stared down at Draco in shock, eyes wide. At that, the blond boy chuckled.
As his two friends continued on their way throughout the now nearly empty corridor, Harry absentmindedly put his hands in his robe pockets. Upon feeling the crumpled up piece of paper, he remembered the paper crane. ‘Scared, Potter?’ Harry glowered at the thought of Malfoy taunting him. Why did the prick even give a damn enough to torment him? Deciding that he didn’t care, Harry sighed and caught up with his friends.
Draco dragged his hand along the railing of the staircase, hurrying so it wouldn’t change with him on it. His thoughts a little bit scattered, he approached the top, his footsteps a clear sound on the stone steps. Eventually his mind settled on Potter, he thought the name with disdain. He hated him, truly utterly and deeply. Or at least that’s what he’s tried to convince himself. Yes he definitely hated Potter, with his hero complex and evergreen eyes and his outrageously unkempt black hair.
“Frighten you did I, Malfoy?” the Gryffindor replied coolly, soaking in Draco’s anger like a sponge.
Potter wouldn’t give up though, “No Malfoy, he saw you. Why were you there? Why were you watching me? I thought I didn’t exist to you anymore.”
“That’s not exactly what I meant,” Ron mumbled, fiddling with a loose string on the cuff of his shirt, “What I meant was that you’ve been off the last couple of days. Like you’re not you or something. I mean bloody hell, you ran into a pretty large column like it was nothing! Is there anything bothering you?”
“Harry, are you alright?”
“I could say the same for you, you know,” Harry smiled tiredly. After a pause, he spoke again, “I couldn’t sleep. Didn’t want to wake anyone up with my tossing and turning about so… here I am.”
“Yeah, I think so,” Harry responded, getting up from the velveteen chair, “Goodnight Hermione.”
Shortly after Malfoy hurried out of the library, Harry wandered back to the Gryffindor dorms, forcing himself to think of nothing else but the meetings for the DA. Things had been going well, or as well as they could be. Malfoy still hadn’t told Umbridge and that was a relief. Come to think of it, why hadn’t Malfoy ratted Harry out to Umbridge? It wasn’t as if he owed Harry anything.
Feeling the warmth of his lover’s release in his hands, coupled with the overpowering sound his Draco made in euphoria had Harry spilling over the edge. He came with a strained gasp, emptying himself into the other man.
When Draco didn’t get the attention he so sought, he remarked, “I could help you get closer to whatever it is you’re admiring. I could just shove you over and you’d be all that much nearer.” He paused, giving time for Potter to react, which he did not, “It would be easy, Potter. No one would know.”
“I’m fine,” Draco whispered, transfixed with those glossy green eyes.
“Ah, I suppose that’d do the trick,” she sighed, stretching and scooting closer to the fire, “But I wouldn’t be worried about Malfoy. He still hasn’t said a word to Umbridge about the Room of Requirement, and if he hasn’t now, then I don’t think he will.”
Potter moved one of his hands up to cradle Draco’s head, which the boy was entirely too grateful for. “You won’t,” the Gryffindor said, determination and assuredness confidant in his voice.
“What the
Harry’s smile stayed on his face. Draco shifted his head slightly, brushing against Harry’s hand. It was an accident, but Harry saw how Draco sighed into the touch.
Harry’s eyebrows rose. “Wow! Congratulations, Hermione.”
Harry laughed and thought - no,
noticed.
By the end of it all, he had looked at Draco, and said, “Guys, I’m… I’m really sorry. For everything I did to you. I never really… You guys apologised, and I never did.”
“Narcissa!” Hermione looked shocked. “Harry, this could actually work.”
Harry and Draco were getting on rather well. Although, there
a few rumours spreading about the two of them, especially since Harry hadn’t been seen kissing any other Slytherins for a while.
They didn’t seem as though they wanted to elaborate, so Harry said impatiently, “What do you mean?”
Draco sighed again. “This is hell.” He cleared his throat. “Not you, but my father. And… I can’t help but think that maybe… maybe we should start the next stage of our plan a little bit early.”
Harry blinked. “Hmm?”
There were significantly less people in the room now, and Draco didn’t need to stand up to be heard now.
Harry laughed. “‘Eliminating them’? We’re not killing them, Draco.”
When he picked up, Draco’s voice was croaky. “Hello?”
be the headline, I just know it.” He frowned in faux anger. “But, I’m not stripping
“On what?” Ron asked, and there was a pause where Harry tried to come up with an answer and failed. “Look, mate, it just seems like… It seems like you already know what you want.”
And then Malfoy turned around to walk away, the stag going with him, and Harry was left staring at his back.
“It’s never too early for that.”
Draco chuckled and handed Harry the bottle. They each took a few more swigs before Draco declared that he was bored.
“Did you adapt it yourself?” Ron ground out, his skin turning red as he continued to scrub.
“I mean, a fucking bear attack? As if.”
They both started to pull away, very slowly, as though they had all the time in the world. They savoured every moment, and finally, as Harry looked at Draco’s lips, they kissed. And, God, this kiss felt as though it was the first kiss Harry had ever had. It was slow, and perfect. They had always been so rushed, but now, they basked in the feeling, refusing to let go.
Draco breathed out a laugh.
to. How else was he supposed to treat Malfoy? He couldn’t just forget about the seven years of his life that he had spent despising Malfoy. That would be far too easy for everyone involved. And besides, it never got physical. It wasn’t too bad - they would argue, insult each other, one of their friends would drag them away, and they would repeat it a few days later. It wasn’t a big deal.
A slow song started to play, and Harry wanted nothing more than to get out of this conversation. Malfoy seemed too… human. Too genuine. Part of Harry had always thought Malfoy was faking all of the laughter he shared with his friends, but this… It was clear he was being sincere.
He watched as she debated the pros and cons in her head.
Harry tried to resist, he really did, but as he walked past Malfoy he said in a low voice full of malice, “Thanks a lot for getting this fucking ball organised.”
Malfoy sighed but started leading Harry, anyway, turning him around as he went. Harry was an awful dancer sober and after a few drinks he was even clumsier, but every time he stumbled, Malfoy tightened his grip on his waist and kept him upright.
Harry laughed, simply relaxing more and more into Draco’s smell, and the way he felt in Harry’s arms.
He could feel Hermione’s eyes on him as he did so, and he turned to face her again. She rolled her eyes.
Draco smirked and lowered his voice. “Oh, I’m no gentleman.”
been happy. He had fallen in love, for fuck’s sake. And now, he was losing all of it because of Lucius fucking Malfoy. And because, unfortunately for him, Draco didn’t love him enough to fight for him. In fact, he didn’t love him at all. And now, he was sitting at his last ever back-to-school feast, and he couldn’t even enjoy it. That was
Oh, god, now Harry
. He shook the thought out of his head.
Harry breathed out a laugh. “Jesus, that
Draco nodded. “I explained everything to them. I thought it was best that way.” He smiled again. “Otherwise, I reckon they would have tried to kill you. They were pretty fucking angry at you.”
That didn’t sound good. Harry glanced over to Malfoy, who was keeping his features indifferent.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay.” Harry said, nodding.
the charming blonde who came in to check I was doing okay on my own and asked me to ‘surprise him’.”
“Before you make your decision, you should know I have your next present.”
They smirked at Harry when Malfoy came in and greeted them both.
“None of it’s true, you know? Even if he said it, you’re not… sick.”
fully healed - he had seen it. It was the same face after he had cast the sectumsempra spell as it had been before, he was sure of it. But now - now it was clear that he had been wrong. And he didn’t know what to say.
There was a long pause where Draco seemed to be contemplating what to say next.
worked in favour of interhouse unity, which Harry found rather odd. Gryffindors and Slytherins seemed to turn their backs on each other, choosing sides and ruining friendships. It would seem most of them were for interhouse unity, but drew the line at Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, befriending Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater.
Harry sighed heavily, but stood still anyway. “Why did you leave?”
He cast a simple Stinging Jinx on Ben’s friends, catching them off guard and getting them out of the way so he could focus on Ben. He started with one that left boils on Ben’s skin, which he had learnt a few years ago and found rather successful. Then, as the boy reached for his wand, he cast the Jelly-Fingers curse, causing him to drop his wand and watch as it rolled away helplessly. Lastly, he used the Bat-Bogey hex that Ginny had taught him. It worked excellently and he had to hold back his laughter to avoid dropping the cloak.
“Guess so.”
“Oh, God, what?”
He found it hard to focus on any of that, however, because Draco’s hair was so soft on Harry’s face and Draco seemed to have decided that his hands weren’t sufficiently occupied, because he had started tracing the lines of one of the snitches on Harry’s pyjamas trousers, tickling Harry’s knee in such a relaxing way. Harry had noticed that Draco was affectionate with his friends - he supposed that he, Pansy and Blaise were all very affectionate people - he had just never expected to be one of the people that Draco felt he could be affectionate towards. And he had never expected it to feel this right.
us by now.”
“About what?”
Draco shrugged, closing his eyes and shifting around slightly to get comfy. “I was going to see my mother, but she… the Manor is too difficult for her right now. She’ll be in France.” He swallowed, and Harry looked at the way his neck moved as he did so. “So, I’ll stay here.”
“Fine, fine.” Harry said once his cheeks were back to normal. “You win. I agree.”
“The whole of eighth year?” He said, his voice dripping in disgust.
“Oh! I just remembered I have something else in my room that might be fun.” Draco said. His hair was slightly ruffled, as it always was when he was drinking or had been awake for too long, and Harry couldn’t help but think that he should leave it like that all the time.
They pulled away after a few moments, and Harry tucked his forehead on to Draco’s shoulder, which was quickly becoming his new fake favourite spot. After a few minutes of stunned silence and a few hushed whispers, the Great Hall resumed its usual chatter and Harry and Draco ate their breakfast, speaking to each other with adoration.
“Fine. But any information we learn about each other stays in this room.”
Harry laughed, crossing off the Black name as Draco spoke, and writing a note next to the Malfoy name that simply said, ‘Lucius’.
bad day.
want to be your real life.” His words were scattered and Harry was sure he made no sense, but he didn’t care. Because, Draco’s eyes were filled with such hope that Harry could cry just looking at them.
“Oh, shit.” Draco shook his head, sighing.
They lay in silence for a few moments where Harry just cried and breathed and let Draco hold him.
Harry laughed as he looked down at his pyjamas. He had honestly forgotten he was wearing them, and his smile widened as he saw he was wearing his red pyjama bottoms with snitches on them and a Chudley Cannons t-shirt that Ron had given him. “What, these aren’t fashionable?” He said as Draco rolled his eyes and they all collapsed back onto the sofas. Harry found himself sitting in between the end of the sofa and Draco, although they were rather squished together.
“So?” Harry asked, frowning slightly at her reaction. “What do you think is happening?”
He saw it in everything now; on the train home for the holidays, when Malfoy had yawned and laid his head in Harry’s lap; when he had kissed Harry goodbye and told him “think of me” with a smirk; when Harry had greeted the Weasleys at the Burrow and could think nothing but
Malfoy smirked. “I suited it rather well.” He shook his head, his smile widening. “The hair paired with the copious amounts of eyeliner really defined my rebel stage.”
Harry frowned. “What do you wear?”
They both laughed, and decided it was too late to be in the library. They headed back to the eighth year dorms together, speaking as they normally did, and Harry decided to believe that they could go back to their fake relationship. As they went into their dorm rooms (another perk of eighth year - they had their own rooms), they said goodnight to each other and didn’t speak a word of what almost happened.
“So, any idea of when Granger and Weasley will be having little ginger babies running around?”
Harry was in the middle of a yawn when Malfoy next spoke.
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand slightly, but his face was still, as though he was in no pain at all as the tattoo gun buzzed. The tattoo artist had commented on how high his pain tolerance must be (“a lot of people leave in tears - the magical tattoos always hurt more”, they had said), which Harry and Draco pleasantly laughed along with. Neither of them dared to mention why his pain tolerance must be so high, but Harry decided to grip his hand tighter.
“They…” Harry took a deep breath. “They kept me in a… a cupboard for the first eleven years of my life.” His voice was quiet, his words slow, and he avoided Draco’s eyes. “I lived in it. And they wouldn’t feed me much. I would basically cook and clean for them, and in return I would get the scraps. So… my sexuality was, sort of, put on hold for a while. And anyway, if I ever told them, they would kick me out.”
Harry smiled. “Great!”
Ron and Hermione had gotten rather good at cooking. After the war, they used to cook for Harry every day. He wasn’t a fan of cooking and he wasn’t in the headspace to do much of anything, really. But, recently he had been living off of takeaways and the few meals he could make for himself. His visits to Ron and Hermione’s flat were luxury in comparison to his usual food.
Harry and Draco had been dating for almost two months now and it was absolute bliss. He cursed himself for not seeing it before - he could have saved himself a lot of pain over the years - but, he supposed, that if it weren’t for their history, what they had
Harry laughed. “You were supposed to answer in French.”
He cried until he fell asleep, alone and cold on the floor.
“Ask him out.”
Harry sighed. He had no choice now. “You wish, Malfoy.”
Draco looked almost touched at Hermione’s concern for him, but Harry watched as he schooled his features back into that of indifference. “It doesn’t really bother me. I get much worse on the street, anyway.”
“You’re a bastard.” He yelled, but Malfoy didn’t even pause. He kept walking, not reacting in the slightest.
There was a murmur of agreement so Harry flashed Blaise a smile and leaned into Draco slightly, their arms still touching. There was a feeling of discomfort around the room as Harry cleared his throat, preparing to ask the next person. He needed to lighten the mood, so he smiled and looked at Pansy.
Malfoy’s hair was ruffled and his eyes were wide, but his familiar smirk stayed put. Harry trailed his eyes downwards and Malfoy seemed to shudder, even from above Harry. His chest was scarred, as Harry had expected, but what Harry hadn’t expected was how it would affect him. He had expected guilt and apologies, but instead, he felt nothing but pure lust. He had marked him before, and he was about to do it again. This was his chance to swap pain for pleasure and, fuck, was he excited to take it. As his eyes continued downwards, they stopped briefly on the Dark Mark, but,
The room was promptly silenced when Pansy stood up from Harry’s lap and shouted, “Everyone shut the fuck up!”
“Well, that’s a lie, actually.” Draco said, his signature smirk on his lips. “Pansy brought over that insufferable Gryffindor from the year above, what was her name again?”
“No comment.” Harry said, his voice muffled by his hands.
“Harry, have you seen this?” Hermione exclaimed, but stopped in her tracks when she saw Draco in his room. “Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you would still be here.” She was avoiding his eyes.
Harry didn’t answer. He couldn’t. He wasn't sure of the answer, himself. He only knew that he was hurting and Malfoy wasn't, which was unacceptable. Now, all he could do was prepare for the impact. He watched as Malfoy raised his hand, his knuckles white as he held his fist up, ready to hit Harry.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Are you counting
He heard a chant start up from behind him, people yelling, “Harry”, over and over again, and he began laughing as he ran. He went past the potions classroom, running faster, making it past Slughorns’s office, hoping to god he wouldn’t wake up. He ran until he reached the end, stopping for a moment to catch his breath and to prepare for the fact that he would now be
He rolled his eyes and took the potion out of her hand before she could take back her offer. “Not just the noise, Hermione.” He said as he uncorked the vial. “It’s everything. Don’t pretend you haven’t noticed it. It’s… the atmosphere. You know, I even saw some Gryffindor and Slytherin first years walking together in the corridors yesterday. They looked really happy. And that never happens. Not even before the war.”
He smiled. “Bed. I’m exhausted.”
Harry sighed inwardly, wishing she would just reject him already.
“Those are very… you.” He said, a grin on his face.
“I know, it’s truly awful.” Draco smirked as he mumbled into Harry.
“Come sit with me.”
Harry took the food and sat up slightly. “Thanks.”
Harry gave him a slight nod, but he couldn’t help but remember how much he hated when Malfoy seemed happy. And now… now he was finding out it was all a lie.
Harry sighed. “Yes, fine. I’ll do it.”
Luna nodded, her face curling up slightly in confusion. “Of course.”
Harry opened his mouth to speak but Hermione stopped him before he could.
Harry reached out and grabbed Draco’s hand, gripping it tightly.
Draco sank further into the sofa and buried his face behind Harry’s arm. Harry grinned, catching Blaise’s gaze.
Harry couldn’t believe he had never seen it before. Of course he was in love with Draco. He supposed some part of him always had been. From the moment he had met him in first year he had been captivated - he just couldn’t leave him alone. Especially in sixth year, it had been pure obsession and he hadn’t even realised. But now, he
He only took a moment to wake up - a moment to register the knowledge that it was
Harry laughed. “I don’t know what else we would bond over, really.”
“Oh.” Harry nodded, and turned his attention to what Ron was holding. “What is that?”
“Easy, there.” He smirked. “You really ran all that way without tripping once, and yet you fall when you put your trousers on.” He snorted. “Better yet, you battled a Dark Lord and
He and Draco were more in love than ever, and Harry was intoxicated by it. Now that their schedules were aligned, they saw each other non-stop. Draco cooked for Harry, and Harry made him his coffee twice a day, each time trying out new recipes for him and kissing him every time he said, “Harry, this is delicious”. It was good practice for the coffee shop he was in the midst of opening.
Draco handed her a pile of clothes. “We’re having a pyjama party.”
He made his way into the common room and took a deep breath. Malfoy was tucked away in the corner with his friends, laughing loudly, but leaning into them, as though not wanting to be heard.
Harry laughed. “Maybe your friends.”
Harry smiled. He wondered if this was a good idea, but he didn’t have a choice and he was sure that, if Draco had changed, Theo probably had, too.
Sorry for the slow update!!
Harry groaned. “The thought of walking all the way up to the tower right now is nauseating.”
Malfoy looked shocked. “Judge you? For wine? Never. I’ll be ordering a Buck’s Fizz, or course. A bit of orange juice turns alcoholism into a classy breakfast.”
Draco grinned and nodded. “She was a bit surprised, at first, but when I explained what it was and why I got it, she was thrilled.” His smile turned slightly sad. “She never wanted me to get the mark.”
“I thought you didn’t wear pyjamas, Draco.” Harry said, and instantly regretted speaking when he realised how it sounded.
He frowned slightly. “What’s your deal, Potter?”
“Well… this was never in the plan. You know, we were never actually supposed to sleep together.”
Malfoy frowned. “What are
“That’s really good of you.” Charlie said, his eyes bright. “Maybe if there wasn’t such a divide between Slytherin and Gryffindor, Voldemort wouldn’t have been so adamant to win against Harry.” He cleared his throat. “Maybe a lot more people could have been saved.”
“Oh, merlin, no.” Draco said, shock evident in his voice. “With the amount of wine he’s had, I’d bet he’d be willing to
He didn’t really think it through all that much. He never really did with these things, to be honest. But, here he was, all the same, ready to walk into the Great Hall, pull Millicent Bulstrode into the corner and kiss her as openly as possible.
Hermione shook her head and giggled, using her wand to turn up the lights again. “The fact that it’s fake is what makes it fun, Draco. It’s like, even though you know none of it is real, there’s still a part of you that thinks it could be true. When you’re lying in bed, you’ll think that maybe, just maybe, that man could be there with you. And, if you feel a chill, you never know, it could be him. Like I said, it’s the fright of it.”
They made their way back through the corridors, and Harry dropped Draco off at the library before going to find Tracey and telling her it was done. She was so pleased she hugged him, which made the Ravenclaw boy squirm slightly beside her.
Harry supposed he and Draco hadn’t exactly been working hard to prevent rumours going around about them. In the past two weeks, they had been woken up five times by younger Gryffindors in the common room, telling them it was time for breakfast. They didn’t mean to keep falling asleep beside each other, it just sort of happened whenever they were up late talking or studying together. And, if Harry was honest, he hadn’t slept this well in months. Having someone beside him helped to keep the nightmares away and he trusted Draco enough to fall asleep beside him rather peacefully. Although, Harry did find himself to be rather sore after a night of sleeping on a sofa in the common room. He was starting to miss his bed.
Salazar’s Socks was. He turned to Pansy to ask her, but she spoke with a smirk on her face before he could get a word out.
“Hmm… Don’t be so sure about that.”
to go ahead with the break-up tomorrow.”
When they made it into Draco’s room, Harry tried his best to stay quiet, but he and Draco were drunk and they found themselves laughing quite a bit.
Hermione laughed, too. “Well, what about you? Wasn’t Draco supposed to leave yesterday?”
“Ah, lovely, I can’t wait to see them again. Are they keeping well? Are all of their memories intact?”
Harry put his hand to his mouth. “Sorry, I’m so sorry.” He rummaged through his pocket until he felt the parchment and pulled it out. “I spoke to the Minister.” He shoved the rolled parchment into Draco’s face, waiting for him to grab it.
“Yeah, Malfoy’s a pureblood. Purebloods need heirs. And, well, you can’t really give that to him. So, just be careful.” Ron gave Harry a smile and squeezed his shoulder.
“Funny, yes, but nice? Only to people she likes.”
, not giving a second thought to the fact that they were out in the open. Anyone could see them, and Harry didn’t care. In fact, it made it better.
Harry’s eyebrows raised. “Did she cheat on Nott?” He asked Draco and Pansy, his voice low.
Harry’s eyes widened, and they stayed that way, even as Blaise pulled away, pulled Harry upright, and winked at him, saying “no questions asked, yeah?”. Harry nodded, wondering how he used to be able to breathe, because he sure as hell couldn’t right now.
“Wait, you’re giving me shit for doing it in public, but you’ve also done it?” Harry exclaimed.
chirpy. “I just finally understand why you insist on being the one to close up.”
They came rushing in in a blur, and it took everything Harry had to not yell to Hermione from the door. They spotted her instantly, practically sprinting to her table, Harry speaking in a rush.
Draco laughed warily. “Or the worst.”
Harry spent the night at Malfoy Manor, which is something he thought he would never do. When he had realised he would, in fact, be spending the night in Malfoy Manor - when Draco had lay in his arms, his tattoo blooming and his breaths slowing - he had no idea what to think. He had put down the book that he had been reading to Draco, and he had snuggled in, but he hadn’t closed his eyes. Not for a while. He had lay there listening to Draco’s breaths until his eyes shut naturally, and soon enough, he was waking up to the sun shining, the birds chirping and absolutely no recollection of falling asleep the day before.
Malfoy spoke between sips. “Alright. We’ve only just started out, really, and I’m not sure how much I can take of this awful schedule, but it’s pretty interesting.”
They stood in awkward silence for quite a few moments before Harry finally sighed, rolled his eyes and took out his flask. He splashed a rather large amount into Luna’s cup, not caring if it would taste bad, then held it out to Malfoy.
day to drag the three of us out on a walk in the forest, and Pansy and I were livid. It was miserable, trudging through the mud in the rain - we were each using about a dozen warming and drying charms - and I, of course, was complaining the whole time.” Harry smiled slightly at that. “But, after a while, we came across a clearing. It opened out into a huge field that was full of flowers. It was still pouring, of course, but there was a kind of mist in the air, and the sky was a beautiful shade of purple. It was strangely… comforting. For a moment, we all stopped speaking, just looking at the flowers and the sky. Then, Pansy started laughing and dragged us all out into the field, dancing like a mad person. We all dropped our charms and danced for a while, laughing in the rain.” Draco swallowed and Harry felt it against his skin. “Of course, we were soaking by the time we got home, and our parents berated us for staying out so long, but,
“Agreed.” Draco growled.
He smiled. She was going to do it. He just knew it. “I need you to kiss me. Just once.”
Draco’s eyes seemed to light up slightly at the distraction, and the corner of his mouth quirked up. “Shut up, it was only one time and it was a
“So… what? You shagged her in a bush?”
Blaise glared at Harry. “Well, are
Harry smiled. “Likewise.”
“So, how’s the case going?”
, was it incredible. You would love it out there. It’s so peaceful and quiet and, when it rains, it’s the most beautiful thing you’ll ever experience.”
He cast a quick, wandless silencing charm around the fireplace so that the few students who were milling about couldn’t listen in.
Hermione brought her hand to her mouth, trying to stop the giggles that were escaping from her lips. “Harry, why was Draco in your bed?”
Harry gasped. And then laughed. He had forgotten the most important part.
“You too, Harry.”
Harry tried to stop his eyes from widening and his mouth from letting out a laugh. He nodded, attempting to keep a straight face, although he wasn’t sure if it was working.
He pulled out his wand and, with a flick of his wrist, the purple light in the corner of the room vanished.
is a pretty interesting drink. Is that turmeric I taste in there?”
the sign. They want us to make one for the Slytherin common room.”
Harry was sure he had forgotten how to breathe, and as Malfoy turned the pair of them around, his movements graceful, Harry saw hundreds of eyes on them.
“Fine.”
Neville nodded. “We’re getting on really well. He’s… well, he really is good. He just wants to try to move on with his life.”
Draco’s breathing had quickened, and Harry could barely hear anything over his loud heartbeat in his ears.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, casting a Lumos and sitting up in bed quickly.
?” Hermione asked, her tone surprised.
going to do?”
Draco frowned. “What?”
Luna looked at Harry, really looked at him. “Sometimes.” Her voice was quiet. “But, I love you both enough to see past it.”
Harry looked over at the desk. The paper was sitting on it, looking harmless. Harry’s stomach was filling with dread as every second passed, but he didn’t care. Draco needed to sleep - he deserved this last moment of peace.
Draco shrugged. “I just… I see what George means.” He shook his head. “Of
“Trust me, it is. I left as soon as I could.”
Harry didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what to say. He supposed that fantasies could be harmless - after all, Draco had also said he had thought about
So, eventually, Draco spoke quietly. “I’m sorry, Harry.” And then… he hung up.
“Watch it, Potter.” The person he had collided with hissed, and Harry sighed, immediately realising who it was.
it wasn’t for Snape. And, now, he had to wonder what it meant all over again.
“What’s wrong?” Harry kept his voice calm, although he could feel the panic rising in his chest.
Harry nodded slowly. “Okay.”
“It seems to be in the corner up there.” He said, pointing to where a purple light showed up in the top corner of the room. “Why did Slughorn put up a surveillance charm in the first place?”
“So… it’ll shock everyone enough to keep them away from me for a while. And, like I said earlier, everyone mostly ignores you.”
Harry was going to correct him. He was going to tell him that they had seen each other afterwards, when Harry had returned his wand and Malfoy had apologised. He was going to tell him that they shook hands, like they should have done when they first met. He was going to tell him that they saw each other again on Diagon Alley and that they had smiled at each other, as though they were friends. But, Harry didn’t tell him. Because, if Malfoy didn’t remember that, then neither should Harry.
“Thank you, sir. I really appreciate this.”
“You’re welcome to try, Headmistress.” Ginny said, her smile hidden behind her hand.
Harry frowned slightly.
Luna shook her head. “It’s real.”
On top of that, Harry was getting no better at falling asleep and staying asleep. For the past week, he woke up feeling worse than ever - the strange dreams that he couldn’t remember driving him crazy - except, last night was different. Last night, he finally remembered. And it was unsettling, to say the least.
, this was a bad idea, because Harry was sure his legs were about to give out.
Hermione nodded. Harry turned towards her and looked at her. He looked at her bright eyes and her drooping mouth.
Harry winced and said, “It’s not what it looks like, I promise.”
secrets, but she loves dares even more.”
They had called each other in the morning after opening their gifts to thank each other. Draco thanked Harry for his present, a smile in his voice, and passed on his thanks to Molly for the jumper. Harry jokingly asked him if he would ever wear it and Draco, his voice serious, said “Of course, Harry, it’s lovely”. Harry found himself falling all over again, so he made up an excuse of needing to help with the dinner preparations.
Draco laughed, and pulled away from Harry. “As much as I love to hear you beg, I’m saving them for later.” He completely let go of Harry and put on his robe, which Harry felt was just to spite him.
“Right, yeah. Basically, when Voldemort tried to kill me for the first time, he accidentally made me into a horcrux. A part of him was… Sort of living in my head. And, because of that, I had some of his… qualities. Like, I could speak Parseltongue.” Harry hadn’t told many people about this, but he knew he could trust Draco with it. “And, I guess… I don’t know… I assumed that I wouldn’t be able to do that anymore, since he’s gone. But, what if… What if I’m still… Like him?”
“It would seem our previous focus on the importance of each of your houses has not been beneficial in all of the ways we had hoped it would be.”
“Harry, it’s so good to see you.” She said to him, her voice low. She was careful not to attract attention to his presence, and Harry felt that warmness in his chest again.
“I’m so sorry.” He said abruptly, interrupting Malfoy.
“Hi.” Harry said as he sat down.
“What for?” Harry said, his voice soft and as quiet as Draco’s.
When Ron eventually looked in a mirror, he made quite the fuss, yelling about “who did this?” and “why the fuck can’t I get it off?”, which Harry found to be very amusing. Especially when he started scrubbing at his face - more specifically, at the cock that was on his forehead (the balls being his eyes, of course) - and started muttering “you turned me into that noseless bastard”, as he tried to remove the (rather artistic) shading around the nose that resembled that of the Dark Lord.
was wearing muggle clothes. A muggle suit, to be more specific. A light blue muggle suit that was shining and in need of attention.
“Well,” Hermione’s voice was soft and gentle, and Malfoy looked at her with, what seemed to be, a hopeful look in his eyes. “Do you think that you… Maybe asked Harry for help?”
He was about to respond to her, to tell her that, if she’s in the mood, she could always come to him, but he was cut off before he could even begin.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “I didn’t know that was possible on the school beds.”
Harry’s eyebrows rose. “You’re not going to France with her?”
Draco was snuggled into Harry and he mumbled into his Harry’s chest, his voice muffled. “Who’s ‘we’?”
“Excellent. I was just reading about moon frogs. They’re fascinating creatures.”
like a lie. And, now that it seemed as though it could be over, he had no idea how to talk to anyone about it.
sleeping there but, when I woke up, she rolled over and Blaise just so happened to be there.” She looked down at Ginny and Blaise, an odd fondness taking over her face. “It’s cute.” She said, before looking up at Harry with an odd smile.
“But.. he’s in Azkaban. How can he stop you?”
Harry laughed and kissed Malfoy again.
Draco growled and pushed Harry onto the sofa.
He mentally shook the thought out of his brain. That wasn’t fair.
Hermione looked up from her book, a startled look on her face. “What?”
Harry was not prepared for that. ‘Surprise me’s were rare and Harry had never pictured Malfoy as a ‘surprise me’ type. He seemed to be quite a fussy person, if Harry’s memory served him well, and he was
Pansy cackled at this. “Granger!”
“Hope you like waffles, Malfoy.” He said as he took a seat.
Even after he went back into the castle, even after he had fallen asleep, all he could think of was that stag on Malfoy’s stomach.
“I have hangover potions in my desk.” He murmured, still half asleep and making no move to actually go get the potions.
Everyone in the room smiled and nodded, murmuring about how they were in need of one of these before everyone else returned to school. Harry agreed, of course, but it was difficult for him to say much else, because Draco’s hand had found its way onto Harry’s knee and he was tracing patterns onto his jeans.
