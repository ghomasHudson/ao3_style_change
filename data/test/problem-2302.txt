“I know,” Abigail said, leaning closer. “We’ll make history.” She touched his arm and he realized with a jolt that she was
brilliant."
The new customer, a young woman with a Holyhead Harpies t-shirt and lots of very glittery jewelry, was starting to look impatient, so Draco and Harry took their leave and went back out into the crisp fall evening.
“Yeah,” Ron said, “busy giving out detentions to Slytherins."
“Am I quiet? Just enjoying the scenery.”
“Dougie!” it called, imperious and female and muffled, far away, somewhere in the bowels of the house. “Dougie, what’s keeping you?”
"Malfoy reckons he knows who it is," Neville said, wide-eyed. "Said he's trying to figure out the right punishment. I know we did some wild stuff as students, but it looks so much more dramatic from this end, doesn't it? Feel sorry for the kid who did it, I wouldn't want Malfoy angry at me. Been there, done that, no thank you."
"Holly?" she said. "About eleven inches? Ugh I love how you guys just randomly use inches for shit like wands and submarine sandwiches and then you're right back to centimeters like nothing happened."
Neville said, “He was just worried about you.”
"Okay, cool, cool, good. You teach with Draco, right? So you'll be mostly indoors, with a little lawn-tromping here and there. Can I see your wand? That's what she said! No but really can I see it?"
All the candles went out, Draco’s chains exploded, the metal chair exploded, Draco leaped to his feet, the door exploded from the other side, and Negasi shouted, “Harry!” as a surge of Aurors poured into the room.
"You made me into a
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "Do you mean to say you made it up?"
“We are conducting business,” Harry said. “For the school. Very official, professorial business, strictly academic.” As he spoke, he realized that he was only digging himself deeper. Anything he said to these children was immediately seized upon and dramatically misconstrued.
This, too, was not what he meant. He meant that “the great
"How are you only realizing this now?" Draco said. "Are you the only witch in the entire world who's never seen a photograph of him?"
Oh, bloody hell, that explains a lot, actually.”
The pressure of Draco's knee against Harry's was gone, and Harry's leg felt cold where it had been.
“It is not,” Gregory growled, “It’s –” and okay, Harry had seen enough to call this. His wand was out and he was shouting “Expelliarmus!” before Gregory had finished saying “—Harry Potter,” but Gregory’s wand was drawn and he was shouting a spell, too, and jets of light leaped out at the same time. Harry’s spell found its mark first, knocking Gregory’s wand from his hand, and he had a moment of hope before Gregory’s spell hit. It knocked him across the room, his back slamming against the wall, candles guttering in his wake, and only the small size of the room saved him from a concussion as his head thwacked concrete. He’d only been forced back about five feet, not enough momentum to do any real damage, but Harry was damaged already and the pain was so great that black began to creep into the edges of his vision. He was still holding his wand, though, and he had managed to keep his feet under him, and that was all that mattered.
Harry blinked at the bubbles floating gently all around him, and his throat clenched. He was so touched by the gesture, so moved by the simple beauty of a magic that had no purpose other than to please, that he could feel his own furious magic begin to calm and quiet within him. It settled back beneath the blanket of pain and closed its eyes, lulled. This was the closest thing to relief Harry had felt since waking up that morning.
"Hold your arms out to the side for me?" she said. "Let's see that wingspan."
"If you don't mind? I really am slow at the moment."
"Sorry," Harry said, "d'you mind speaking up?"
Harry narrowed his eyes. "You're not a Healer."
“I’m afraid I must object,” said Kevari, stepping forward. “This boy needs rest, and lots of it, as soon as possible.”
“I don’t think your friends like you hanging around with me,” said Draco as he and Harry started off in the opposite direction. He said it lightly, but there was an edge to his voice.
Ron pointed at Harry. “Did he tell you he was coming?”
"That isn't fair, they didn't --!"
“He’s not my minder,” Harry said indignantly, “he’s my – my – my colleague.”
“Are you all right?” Lizzie was halfway down the stairs but she stopped to peer back up at him.
"We made such a beautiful baby," she said tearfully, draping herself into Ron's patient arms.
And with that threatening sign-off, he turned and left. The room was mostly empty, finally, and Harry took a brief, staggering step that must've looked as bad as it felt, because Neville resumed staring at him anxiously.
Absolutely not an option. He hung the cane back on the footboard of his bed and took a few practice steps around the room. His knee didn't seem to want to take his weight today and he put a hasty Locking charm on it, freezing it straight so it wouldn’t buckle, though he knew he’d pay later for holding it one position so long. He pocketed his wand, guzzled a glass of water, looked at himself in the mirror, sorely regretted having done so, and was off.
He'd woken early but it still took him twice as long as usual to get ready, even leaning on the wooden cane that had never left his chambers. Everything was blurry, hard to make out, and he'd smashed a jug of water before he realized he'd forgotten to put on his glasses for perhaps the first time ever. His leg was screaming at him for the hours he'd spent in bed ridding his body of that stupid bloody potion, and for the first time he seriously considered bringing the cane through the castle with him, even if it meant leaving his wand-hand occupied. But his reflexes and intuition were all he had, these days; what if today was the day something happened, and he wasn't fast enough? What if someone took his wand again in the time he spent dropping the cane to reach for it? What if an enemy broke into the castle and into the classroom and forced Harry to watch as his students were tortured in front of him?
Malfoy grinned and opened the door.
He ate his lunch mechanically, without making conversation, and though he did feel a bit better after he'd gotten some food down, he was counting the hours until his last class when he could take dinner in his chambers and not talk to anyone until the next morning. He did manage a, "Sorry, Neville, bit of a grump today," as Neville stood to leave, and was rewarded with a smile and a pat on the arm. Neville was blessedly difficult to offend.
Kevari peered down at him and raised an eyebrow. “You’re looking well.”
This was tricky magic and any interruption could ruin the spell. Harry pushed down the pain thudding through the left side of his body and put all of his focus into murmuring the spell with precisely the right inflection and moving his wand in precisely the right manner. From the quill he slowly and carefully teased out a long ribbon of words, written on the air in Malfoy’s distinctive looping cursive. If he could’ve crossed the fingers of his non-wand hand, he would have.
"Has he been making your potions?" Hermione wanted to know.
“Not too late to change your mind,” Draco said as they stepped into the fire.
He did have an excuse: Malfoy was -- of course -- Head of Slytherin, and one of the Slytherin first years didn't seem to be coming along as well as the others. Her name was Chloé and even apart from her poor performance, she seemed... sad. She rarely spoke in class, not to Harry and not to her classmates, and when anyone did try to speak with her she replied in monosyllables. She didn't seem unfriendly, she just seemed vacant, and Harry was genuinely concerned. Even if he hadn't needed an excuse to speak with Malfoy, he'd have brought this to her Head of House.
Harry didn’t know how to answer that. He felt almost nothing except a deep, deep fatigue. Fatigue from the constant unreliability of his body, and fatigue from being looked at all the time, watched, scrutinized, questioned.
"What?" Harry said. He needed to have a word with George. "What do they sell?"
Harry felt a pang at this, both at the word “friendship” and at the way it made him feel to be spoken of in this manner, as if Harry Potter were a construction of himself but not him
“I didn’t mean give him physio tips,” said Betsy, thwapping Draco on the arm. “I just want to know if it’s the right size or if I need to lengthen it or what!”
"The famous Potter temper graces the Great Hall once more," drawled Malfoy. He put a hand on Harry's shoulder. "Class is starting. Come on, down we go."
Malfoy shrugged, overly casual in a way that made Harry think he wasn't feeling very casual at all. "That's what it feels like. To have left that world. I know how it looks from the outside, but it's -- it's not easy to realize that everything you were taught, everything you were raised to think, was a hateful lie. It cost me pretty much everyone in my life, except mum. And Blaise. We lived together in France for a while."
But Malfoy, to his consternation, was not at lunch.
“You’re a patient today, not a Healer,” said Kevari, but he was smiling, clearly no stranger to Draco’s character. “Yes, show me what you’ve got.”
“I’m getting to the embarrassing part,” Draco said. “I’m just setting the emotional stage so you’ll understand what happens next.”
"Yes."
to save us, ahahahahaha."
“No,” Harry said, leaning heavily on his cane to try and take pressure from his hip. “Why – he’s told you?”
"Potter?" McGonagall said from behind him, and he turned on her, the closest target.
"You look a bit peaky, mate," Neville said worriedly.
“Better, thanks,” Harry said, scanning the room without sitting down. “Have you seen Malfoy today?”
Malfoy shrugged this off with the barest lift of his shoulder and matched his pace to Harry's as they started back up to the castle. It was lovely walk, through a small wood and then up the sloping green meadow, and the early evening sun was taking on a pinkish glow. For a while they walked in silence, each lost in their own thoughts, and then Malfoy said, "Look up."
"I ordered it from Betsy's Chairs 'n' Chairs in Hogsmeade, do you know it?"
“I’ve missed this place,” Harry said, breathing in that old familiar scent.
"No! No, Hanna, please, please step back."
They perked up a bit, and as he went down the list they became more responsive, smiling, then laughing, then chiming in comments on their classmate's costumes. All was going well until Harry reached "Perkins, Timmy."
Neville did as he was told.
"Yeah, that should work."
"The Ministry made me go to counseling," Harry said. Malfoy was tilting the bottle at him and he pushed his glass forward, nodding. "A few times when I was an Auror. I used to -- I'd get very angry, sometimes, and it wasn't productive. They made me go for that. And then, once or twice after I'd been injured. Not this injury; others, smaller ones. I got accused of, er, self-destructive recklessness."
’d set that mad woman on him, did she?” Harry said, horrorstruck.
Say what you wanted about Harry’s defensive tactics (plenty of people had), his expelliarmus was a brutal art by this point. Their wands flew out of their hands and across the room with such force that one of them splintered against the opposing wall, but Phil was already pulling back his fist for a blow, and Harry, knowing he’d be knocked down at the first threat to his balance, decided to get on the floor under his own steam. He threw himself at Phil before the punch could land, ramming him with his good shoulder and sending him crashing to the floor, aiming his wand as they both went down and shouting “Fragore!” at one of hanging lamps over Craig’s head.
“Nice sweatshirt.”
But neither of them did. Instead, they rode back to the castle in silence. Together, apart, they stared out the windows into the velvet, star-streaked night.
Then he was gone, leaving Harry extremely confused about how insulted he was supposed to be.
have was the foggiest clue how to boil water."
“Minerva,” Neville called down the table. “Where’s Draco gone, again?”
"Potter?"
The result was instantaneous.
"Don't be alarmed if I get up every now and then and walk around a bit," Harry said, same as he'd said to his first two classes. "I have trouble sitting for long periods of time."
Malfoy's office hours were after lunch, which coincided with Harry's free period, so he gathered his courage and his energy and hauled himself up two flights of stairs to the Potions office. He was starting to get to know his students, and when they called out to him as they passed he was able to greet them mostly by name, which cheered him. He paused at the top of the second flight and took a moment to lean against a wall, catching his breath and calming his nerves and trying to let the stair-induced pain subside so he could tone down his limp and make a better entrance. He smoothed his robes, tucked his bad left hand casually into his pocket, and knocked on his office door.
"Boo," said Malfoy. He was, to Harry's surprise, grinning outright -- perhaps the first real smile Harry'd seen on him. "I'm going to swim a few laps. Will you -- will you be all right?"
No answer.
They stared at each other, Harry still half-in the fireplace, Draco with his back to the Great Hall, and Harry could see heads swiveling, could see students trying to catch a glimpse of them, no doubt spreading ridiculous rumors amongst themselves, which only made Harry angrier. That’s all they’d ever be: rumors.
He was in pain, and then he wasn't: hell, and then heaven. The change was so disorienting that his muscles briefly gave out and he began to sag like a rag doll before he caught himself. Malfoy was right, it was like no pain potion he'd ever had before -- the pain wasn't dulled, wasn't calmed, it was simply vanished. The relief of it was like a tidal wave, so enormous and all-encompassing that, to Harry's deep embarrassment, his eyes filled with tears. He visored his eyes with a hand and turned away, and nothing about movement hurt, it was as fluid and natural as it had used to be, back in the Before of this never-ending After. It felt so good not to feel bad. He drew a shuddering breath, thumbing at a tear that had forced its way onto his cheek. He couldn't look at Malfoy. He felt flayed open.
“Yeah, I’ll be fine,” Harry said, and glanced guiltily at Kevari, feeling like he was betraying him. The Healer tossed up his hands, looking exasperated but not angry.
"Ridiculous the Floo's taking so long," Malfoy muttered. "How you've been doing this every day, I don't know."
"No, it's only -- it does this sometimes, but not for a while -- it just goes all liquidy and useless. Ah, fuck. It'll be fine, I'll just do a Locking charm. Why don't any fucking stairs around here have a fucking railing?" He realized his voice had gotten far too loud, and he took off his glasses to massage the bridge of his nose.
"Ten points to Gryffindor," he said aloud. Just this once, he could break his own rules.
He went into his empty classroom to use the Floo, but instead of stating "Harry Potter's Bedroom," he found himself requesting the fifth floor, and then, walking down the hallway, and then, somehow, standing in front of Draco Malfoy's office.
together?"
Neville cleared his throat and did a fair approximation of Malfoy’s upper class drawl. “I won’t make it by ten – let’s say eleven? The Ragged Pony will do. Enclosed is the deposit you requested; I’ll pay the rest as soon as I’ve got the venom in hand. Thanks much. DM.”
“You do need bed rest,” Kevari went on, “but not a week of it, I don’t think. A few hours a day should have you on the road to recovery. And lots of heat, as much of it as you can stand. Baths, hot compresses, warming charms… Your curse loves the cold, let’s not feed it. My main concern is your shoulder – did you hit it today?”
"Outstanding," Harry pronounced. "Where did you get it? I need one. No, I need two, in case one ever breaks."
"Yes, I should."
His shit knee buckled again as they were spat out into the Ministry Floo, but he managed to stay on his feet thanks to Draco’s firm grip, and it was the work of only a few seconds to regain his balance. Roberts and Negasi were waiting for them just outside the fireplace, and Negasi, who’d clearly seen him stumble, gave Harry a quick, worried smile as he limped into the hall.
“So green!” Jacob cried.
He had an absolutely massive crush on Draco bloody Malfoy.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, utterly flummoxed. "I don't know. I don't expect so. I use it because I've trouble with the stairs."
"Sorry," he said, rubbing his eyes beneath his glasses. "Sorry. I'm just --" a bitter washed-up git "--tired. Thank the students for the offer, Professor, and give them my apologies." He pushed back from the table and slapped a hand on Neville's shoulder, leveraging himself up with a forced smile. "I'm going to put myself to bed, I think."
What he did have trouble with was the potion itself.
At this Harry could only laugh, thinking of his joke with Kevari, and behind him he heard the Healer chuckling, too. “I’m not,” said Harry, “but thanks all the same.”
“Calm down, it’s right here in your cane.”
I did tag this as a Slow Burn, right? Okay, good, no one can accuse me of false advertising ;)
“That isn’t why we’re fighting,” Harry said, “we’re fighting because –” he paused. “Because –”
Was it nice because he’d enjoyed the company, or just because it was a change from the Great Hall? Was he holding the door because it was a date-like thing to do, or because he was worried Harry did actually need the door held?
“No, come in, but – is everything all right?”
"Yeah, it's grand." He took a sip of whiskey. "Merlin, so is this."
"Wish she'd say that to me," Ron said, patting what was, admittedly, a bit of a belly.
Abigail relaxed and went back to smiling at him. “Oh good. Lizzie did promise Dougie would be the only Muggle, and he’s practically one of us, by this point.”
"You're the one who taught me that spell," Harry said, "you could've done it just as well yourself."
he trying to say? Draco was looking at him, waiting.
Harry had a keen sense-memory of climbing these bloody stairs day in and day out, and it wasn't hard to approximate his daily haul, leaning heavily on the banister, going up carefully step-by-step even though it felt ridiculous to try and accommodate a pain he didn't feel. Malfoy went behind him, not hovering exactly.
McGonagall was rising from the table now, napkin dropping from her lap. When she spoke, her voice was calm, but Harry knew her well enough to see that she was worried. “Should we alert someone?”
“Did Lizzie Debs hire you?”
"Had to run to the office but she'll be here shortly. Let's get you sitting down so you can hold this baby and I can fetch you a drink." Ron turned to the fellow at the next table. "Oy, give us your chair, would you?"
"Yes, she has that effect on people. It's nearly four, we should get you to the Three Broomsticks."
Malfoy didn't have to imagine it, Harry realized. Lucius's imprisonment after the war -- and his subsequent death in Azkaban -- had been salacious gossip for years.
"Bit tame," said Harry, but he was already going inside to explore. Malfoy looked deeply pleased with himself and went immediately behind the bar.
Gibson Ackley and the other two had not been trying to kill Harry. They'd been trying to destroy him. But Harry let this slide.
Harry clenched his jaw. "Malfoy, where's this going? Just tell me so I can yell at you now and save us both time."
They went back out into the main pub and Harry said, “Secure the doors, would you? It wouldn’t do to have any Muggles popping in for a pint right now.”
There:
"Potter," Malfoy said suddenly, with an odd energy. "Let me know if you -- if you need --" He seemed to run out of steam, and finished limply, "More information."
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. This was an old joke between them and it meant, unfortunately, that Harry looked the opposite of well. It meant he looked like shit.
“I’m feeling well,” he answered.
Harry thought of the house elves he'd seen, tiny wrinkled creatures with enormous eyes. It's true her eyes had been very large, and unusually pellucid, but -- "But she's so tall!"
She didn't say anything, just sat by his bed for a while, staring at her knees. Then she rubbed her eyes, stood, and said, "I hope you feel better."
“Good,” she said, and patted both their arms. “Next time you two come down, we can all have dinner together!”
"I'm all right from here," Harry said. "No more stairs between me and my classroom. Good thing or I'd probably shout at the students, too. Merlin, why am I such a tosser?"
“Just let me hang onto your arm – yeah, like that. And tell me if I’m putting too much weight on you.”
“You’re impossible, you know that?” said Draco. “I’m holding your hand because – well, because I want to touch you, because I
spend all your money on liquor and handsome men.”
"Sorry," he said again.
“Bit tired,” he said again. “I think I – I think I’ll have to turn in early.”
But he did feel a more determined interest in Malfoy's idea about the wand-cane. Walking with a Locked knee was difficult and cumbersome, and he had to be helped-down from the carriage by a thrilled Keisha. It was not how he'd have preferred to see Ron and Hermione for the first time in months -- he'd have liked to seem healthy and strong and capable of caring for himself in the way Hermione was always accusing him of not doing, but instead he looked as worn-out and run-ragged as he felt, and his stiff knee made him even slower and unsteadier than usual.
The waiter was by their table suddenly, a quill and parchment hovering in the air next to him as he stood above them, hands politely behind his back. “Gentlemen? May I start you off with a beverage?”
Harry felt his nostrils flare, and he clenched his jaw, both hands curling into fists. He'd had lots of truly shite days in his thirty-one years, but this one was really a contender for a top slot. "I asked Hanna to get Neville."
“What does it do?” Harry asked, trying to work himself into the low lawn chair.
He didn't mean to say it aloud, and at the shocked faces of his colleagues he felt instantly ashamed. He thought he felt the slight press of Malfoy's knee against his own -- a sign of reprimand? Sympathy? Was he imagining it?
"Look, Neville, thanks for coming by, but I'm still not feeling all that great. I need to lie down."
"Professor? Professor Potter?"
“Yes please but gimme the peppermint, if I have caffeine now I won’t sleep a wink. I barely slept last night, either, I was working on this rocking horse for my niece’s birthday, trying to enchant it to make a galloping noise but no matter what I did it just sounded like it was farting.”
Distracted from pouring drinks, Malfoy crossed the room and deposited himself in the chair. He shifted a bit. Extended his legs. Put his arms on the armrest. "Why has no one ever told me?" he demanded. "This chair cost 200 Galleons!"
"Gift from an admirer?"
Harry said, "Wait, you recognized me -- by my wand?"
Oh Merlin, he thought. No. Please let this not be happening. Please don't let me have a crush on Draco. Fucking. Malfoy.
Ron laughed, but Hermione looked anxious.
“You’re blushing,” Ron said disgustedly. “I can’t believe I’m going to have to go on double dates with Draco bloody Malfoy.”
Harry blinked. “A – charger?”
“For your phone. Is it dead?”
The next day, Harry was accosted by a group of Gryffindor third years in the Great Hall. It wasn't an ideal time to be accosted -- he was already late to lunch and he'd missed breakfast due to hangover, and was now both wildly hungry and a bit nauseous, a terrible combination he hoped to remedy with something greasy, like a grilled cheese. He could practically taste the buttered bread and the mild tang of cheese, but now all these students were standing in his way, demanding to know if it was true that he and Professor Malfoy had both been Seekers when they were at school.
Harry didn't want to fly on a bloody armchair. He wanted to fly on a broom. He missed it like he'd miss breathing, the swoop up, the plummet down, the swerves, the wind, the thrill. He hadn't been able to stomach Quidditch since he'd been cursed, and now he was supposed to armchair around like an ancient witch, blowing a whistle at the nimble bodies who could dart and soar to their heart's content.
“Of course they liked you,” said Harry. “They made the mistake of thinking you were
“Stop being difficult, you know I mean her ears. And those eyes... Is she – is she quite – human?”
Fatigue from being cosseted and mollycoddled. He did not want Draco to butter his bread. He wanted Draco to fuck him senseless into next week.
he promised his body.
"But there are others?"
"C'mon, Harry," said Neville. "You're aces at billiards!"
The Floo spit him in out in an old-fashioned fireplace in a hotel room that looked like it hadn’t been used for a century, save for a clean path in the dust leading from the Floo to the door. There was furniture but it was all covered with sheets, and the window had been boarded up save for a tiny sliver at the top, so the light inside was murky and grey. Harry moved forward carefully, wary as always of unknown spaces, wondering how exactly he was supposed to get
Harry showed her and a slowly calming Ron the quick-release mechanism for his wand, and they stood around for a while oohing and aahing, until Harry saw Draco shivering out of the corner of his eye.
In the end, Harry was in the hospital wing for a night and day. That made three days of classes missed, he'd have to reconstruct his whole syllabus around his own stupidity, if he was even allowed to keep teaching. Neville came to see him that evening, pale-faced and guilty and wringing his hands.
"Yes, they've a lovely house. I've spent a lot of time there." Unable to help himself, he fished Rosie's picture out of his pocket and handed it over, beaming.
"Fine, yes. Yes, you're right. Merlin's tangled beard, you know I actually thought I was subtle before I met you?"
“Yeah,” he said. His threshold for chit-chat had been crossed. He let himself glance around and realized with some relief that this basement was a far cry from the one he’d been locked in. It smelled like a basement, yes, but it was carpeted and brightly-lit and there was a billiards table. Harry blinked at the table, confused.
She set her jaw determinedly and began to cross the last few stairs towards him. "I can help you, let me --"
The bartender tilted his head, considering, then turned to one of the only other two people at the bar, a man with a thick blond mustache. “Oy, Phil,” he said. “This bloke look familiar?”
“Absolutely,” he declared.
"Hullo, Potter," he said -- same old drawl, but an octave or so deeper. It was amazing the difference an octave could make.
"Friday at 6, okay."
Harry slammed the letter down on the desk in satisfaction. The students sitting in the first row jumped, including Hanna, whom Harry beamed at. An excellent family, the Seids. This was clearly more than a lead: it was an answer. Draco’s old friend Gregory Goyle had been sending the Howlers all this time.
"Malfoy," he warned, and then he fell asleep.
It was his Healer’s voice, and Harry felt himself bristling out of instinct. But then, remembering their fight, their weeks without speaking because of his own stupid pride, he deflated.
fine,” Harry said, still riding that soothing wave of rage. “That’s bloody obvious to anyone who looks at me. Why you lot have to keep asking when you know the bloody answer…”
He could tell that what she really meant was: Tough shit.
Harry stared. "I think your attempts at humor are even scarier than that mark."
There he stayed for the next twelve hours. It was a deeply unpleasant night. The less said about it, the better.
"I agree," Malfoy said, "but I think that, compounded by actual grief for her father, she's feeling a lot of guilt. Especially where you're concerned. You're the savior of the wizarding world, and she's the child of a man who tried very hard to kill you."
"Fun?" said Malfoy, as if he'd never heard the word before.
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “But I can certainly try.”
“Wait,” Harry said. “Give me the letter.”
"You are very lucky," Malfoy said, speaking slowly, "that we were already on our way out. That I was nearby. If I'd still been swimming, you could've -- it could've been very bad."
The Three Broomsticks was absolutely packed, and Harry stood in the doorway for a moment, shaking rain from his hair and looking around for his friends. It was blessedly dry and warm, and a ceiling of floating candles gave the whole room a bright glow that made Harry want to climb into an armchair and cover himself with a blanket. He caught a glint of bright copper back in a corner, and grinned: he'd know Ron's hair anywhere. Carefully he made his way through the people crowded at the bar and wove through the tabletops to where Ron was sitting at a small, circular table, Rosie on his knee, pint already half-finished in front of him. He was frowning at a newspaper and bouncing his daughter absentmindedly, but he seemed to sense Harry's presence from a few feet away and glanced up, face splitting in a delighted grin.
Harry steeled himself and looked to the door, searching for a skinny, pale, pointed little weasel, but he didn't see anyone familiar. "Where?"
"Harry," Ron said loudly, "we've got a new couch for you to kip on, look. Cubile!"
"If so, they're not in Slytherin," Malfoy said.
"Oh. Yeah, I like seeing, thanks." He was waist deep and gravity was beginning to reassert its hold on him, his arm hanging heavily from his damaged shoulder, his leg protesting the weight of his body. It was an unwelcome sensation, this return to the realities of life on land. He tightened his jaw, trying to keep his balance on the lake floor as he got heavier and heavier, and out of nowhere, he found himself yawning hugely.
"Pass the peas," Malfoy said from down the table, and suddenly McGonagall was trying to hand Harry an enormous silver tureen of buttered peas and he was trying to take it. Instantly he knew it was a recipe for disaster.
“Harry,” Neville called, “could you pop open this filing cabinet?”
"Oh, but if you want gossip," said Harry, "did you know Narcissa Malfoy is living with Muggles?"
“Are you all right?” Harry said urgently.
The two biggest problems Harry faced were:
"Hopefully not. I brewed an
"Yeah," Harry said defensively, expecting some jibe, but Malfoy only cocked his head.
“Well – thank you.” She got a bit pink. “I’m very pleased. And oh, Harry, is that your new cane?”
Startled, Harry started to say, “You do?”, and it was only years of training that had him reacting out of pure reflex when Craig, Phil and the bartender all reached for their pockets in tandem. He had his own wand out before any of them did (he really needed to find a way to repay Betsy) and was roaring “Expelliarmus!” just as the three wands came up to point at his face.
“All right,” Malfoy said. “Been sitting behind a desk all day, I could do with some exercise.”
“It’s just through here,” Lizzie said, gesturing to another door Harry hadn’t noticed. She glanced at her watch, frowning. “You get settled – I’m going to fetch Dougie. We have to start the ritual before sundown, he knows that.”
“And Harry, hello,” said Healer Kevari, coming to stand over the couch where Harry lay. Harry, whose pulse was still pounding in his ears, lips still tingling where Malfoy had bitten them, managed what he hoped was a calm, not-dying-of-thwarted-ardor smile.
There was a chair in front of Malfoy's desk, and Harry would have very much liked to sit in it. But Malfoy didn't offer it and so he stayed standing. He eased his weight onto his right leg, trying to make the movement look casual, and trying, too, to look like he wasn't casing the room. Glass cabinets of visible biological ingredients: feathers, beaks, feet, eyes, etc. Wooden cabinets of who knew what. Filing cabinets, probably of files.
The scenery at that moment was two squirrels avidly fucking. Rather on the nose, Harry thought, disgruntled.
Harry began to stand, reveling at how easy it was even with his Locked leg, and Malfoy said sharply, "Careful! Careful. Is that a Locking charm? I'm going to take it off for a moment, just to demonstrate something, all right?"
“Well, she won’t be glad if we don’t bring her potions professor back safe and sound,” Harry said, trying to steer them back on track.
"Stop," Harry said. "Student interviews? Please tell me you’re making this up."
Draco clenched and unclenched his jaw visibly. “Because we care,” he said. “But don’t worry, I won’t keep making that mistake.”
Malfoy sniffed regally. "Professor Potter. You left this in my office last night."
There was a silence, then a boy in the back called, "Bravo, Professor!", and there was a brief but enthusiastic applause. Harry, heart thudding, lowered himself back behind the desk. Galen Parkinson sneered at him; Hanna Seid, and most of the rest of the class, beamed at him.
The cane with which she emerged was, to Harry’s total delight, ordinary-looking in the extreme. It was just a very nice wooden cane with a flattish, downward-curving handle and a sensible rubber tip – not much different, in fact, than the one he had stowed away in his bedroom at Hogwarts, though this one was clearly made of nicer wood. When he looked closely he could see that the grain swirled and glowed beneath the unobtrusive matte finish.
"And you've got your cane?" Hermione continued. "I really think you might consider using it, Hogwarts is the safest place you could be, it's so heavily-warded -- but it's also
“Negasi and I are off,” announced Roberts. He and Negasi were crowded into the fireplace. “You two’ll follow right behind?”
He woke up on Wednesday morning of his third week of classes with one potion remaining, and knew his time was up. He had to break into the Potions office that very night or suffer the consequences, which would require a bit of reconnaissance work, which would require going into the Potions office during daylight hours, which would require talking to Draco Malfoy, which was another reason Harry'd put this off for so long.
"She's already living up to it," Harry said, voice a bit sharp.
and -- aaaaahhhh. Mona is going to actually keel over and die when I tell her I met this wand."
up for this?” Harry said, suddenly worried. “You’ve had a worse day than I have and they’re going to ask you to relive it for your statement. I know what it’s like, to – to be tied up like that, and –”
"Total?" Harry had said. Jacob had nodded eagerly. "I don't know, actually. There's a public one on every floor, and then one in the Great Hall, and this one here in my classroom..."
“I’m sorry we didn’t find you sooner,” Negasi said.
"Blood traitor," Harry repeated. "How on earth is Malfoy a blood traitor?"
"Right," Draco said (and when had he started thinking of him as Draco? What was happening?). "I'll leave you here. Have a nice time with that gingery child you're so fond of, and his little daughter."
"You're still wearing your glasses."
"Yes."
"All right," she said, "I'm going for help." She turned, then hesitated. "Here," she blurted, "my mum used to do this when I wasn't feeling well." She flicked her wand and suddenly the air was filled with huge, soapy bubbles, each of them containing a soft white glow, like starlight. Then she darted back down the stairs.
“There was that one rumor,” Harry remembered, “about Filch and Madam Pince, but I don’t remember being… you know…
Harry frowned suddenly. “Are you holding my hand, or massaging it?” he said.
“He means it,” Harry told her, leaning on his cane and grinning.
Harry watched him swim out, as graceful on water as he was on land, then turned to the matter of his own undressing. He'd process what Malfoy had said later; maybe. For now, he unzipped his jeans and then cast about for somewhere to sit, but the sandy beach was empty. He used his earth-shaping charm to swell some sand into a semblance of a seat, and managed to get his jeans off. Next was his shirt, and he looked to make sure Malfoy wouldn't see the unbuttoning charm he'd learned at St. Mungo's, all the buttons wriggling magically free of their holes as Harry waited. His shoulder always made this part difficult, but he struggled free of his shirt without too much hassle, then folded his wand in his clothes and stood. He was just in his red Gryffindor boxers, now, and he made his way through the shifting sand, careful not to lose his footing, careful not to look down at the mess of his leg.
“Yeah.”
He used his wand to pour and fill the vials he'd lifted from Malfoy, the only thing he was concerned might be noticed missing, since he'd taken 60 of them, enough for a month, but oh well, vials were easy to come by, he'd put in an order later so he wouldn't have to steal them next month. Then, with utmost care, he packed them into a bookbag, cleaned the potions classroom, and had a mostly pain-free staircase experience to his bedroom, where he fell into a lovely, pain-free sleep.
Negasi blinked very rapidly and Harry was seized with the terrible thought that he might cry, but he didn’t, only pressed his lips together and nodded. “I’m really glad you are. And so’s Hanna.”
"Have you noticed that behavior in your class?" Harry prompted.
"At breakfast, then," Neville said. "Feel better, Harry."
"Yeah, but when I came to Hogwarts they fixed me up the first day. See?" He stood to demonstrate the height equality of his legs. "How come they can't fix you?"
Fatigue from being fretted-after, worried-over.
There was silence, then Malfoy said, "The bigot part, at least. I hope."
“Murdered in a basement by a bunch of Squibs?”
Harry blanched. Negasi was one of the people who'd found him chained up in that basement, surrounded by the bodies of the men who'd taken him, his own body broken beyond repair. The whole extraction team had been put through mandatory counseling, Negasi included. What had he told his daughter?
"I have no sympathy for Gibson Ackley, or the others."
He picked the charm up quickly, and as soon as she'd gone, he murmured, "Astribulla," and filled the air with them, shining and glowing and drifting gently, bouncing off the sheets that served as walls to cordon off his little bed. He heard Madame Pomfrey talking to someone outside, heard her say, "Chloé Barnes? Sorry, dear, if you're not on the list, I can't let you in."
“Harry James Potter!”
Except, of course, for the hundreds of hot-blooded young people slumbering several floors below him. It was definitely the place for them.
That was all Harry needed at the moment. He looked down at Negasi. “We need to find out where the Debs live and get there, fast. There’ll be an address somewhere around here, on a checkbook or on a document, but I’m – I’m not quite up to searching, so if you --?”
over. I could distract at the front door and you could get in the house elsewhere?”
"All right, Potter? Do you like your new hard-won railing?"
"There are canes with swords in them, and daggers, and probably other things," said Malfoy. "If you found a decent craftsperson, like Betsy at Chairs 'n' Chairs, I imagine she could find a way to put your wand in a cane and rig it with a quick release, so you could have it at the ready whenever you needed it."
,” said in such tones, was not a real person – it was a myth, a celebrity. He, Harry, standing here in the flames, was real. He only wanted Draco to see that, to see
"I very much doubt that," Draco said. He was still gripping Harry's arm, as if worried -- or reluctant -- to let him go. "Well," he said, "I--"
Negasi cast the spell quickly and skillfully, and a moment later a wisp of blue light shot from his wand and began to careen around the room, pausing briefly above both Harry and Negasi’s heads and then the head of the man knocked-out on the floor, taking on the vague shape of the number 3 before it shot away into the kitchen.
“It’s only Ron, that man can hold a grudge like no one else. He’ll come round.”
Negasi, bless him, asked no further questions, only nodded and said, “Your lead.”
"No, stay," Malfoy said. "I'll be out there, anyway." He gestured to the lake, then eyed Harry. "That's an interesting -- arrangement. The way the ground's holding you like that, how did you do it?"
Harry told him what he'd observed about Chloé; her performance was poor, she wasn't socializing, she wasn't responsive, she seemed depressed. Malfoy listened with uncharacteristic attention while Harry spoke, even going so far as to nod minutely from time to time.
“Er,” Harry said. “Professional tip, it’s mostly baddies who arrange, you know, attacks and kidnappings.”
The problem, of course, was his own terrible body.
Malfoy didn't say anything, and Harry tried to catch his breath, tried to calm down. They were nearly to the castle now and he was limping so badly he knocked into Malfoy every time he pulled weight off his bad leg.
“Right. So, bad mood, feeling down, I snuck out to the Three Broomsticks to have a drink – just one drink, then right back to the castle.” Draco looked as if he were eating something unpleasant. “I did have one drink – but then I had another. And then another. And another. Perhaps you can see where this is going.”
Harry blinked at him. "Oh?"
For a moment, the name didn't register, probably because Harry had spent the better part of eighteen months trying never to think it. But some part of his lizard brain told him to school his face, and sure enough, when the name clicked, he was grateful for the stony expression he'd already plastered on.
"Can you stand?"
"I think there's a set with a railing in the west wing, I can check for you tomorrow."
She beamed. "You liked them?"
"Oh god," Harry said, thudding back against his cushions. "The post is going to be mental."
a very cute plant. Its buds looked like little cartoon snails with long, friendly antennae, and there was something irresistibly adorable about the cute little way it sat bunched up on the stem. If he wasn’t so excited about sitting down, Harry would have leaned over and given it a little hug.
"Who'd have thought?"
"Gee, thanks," Harry said, spearing a baby-sized bite of pancake with his fork. "Appreciate the gesture, though."
“This is Glen,” Abigail said, squeezing his bad arm, and Harry schooled his face, wildly thinking that maybe Gregory wouldn’t recognize him, maybe he wouldn’t be able to see past the scars and the cane and the days-old beard, though he had of course recognized Gregory right away, despite the many intervening years, the new wrinkles, the new pounds. But even as he met his old classmate’s eyes he knew it was hopeless. It was a minor miracle, in fact, that none of these Squibs had recognized him yet.
But he refused to get his hopes up. If the wand-function didn’t work, it wouldn’t matter how nice the cane itself was.
Then again, neither would he have imagined he’d be clinging to Draco fucking Malfoy because a significant percentage of his limbs no longer quite functioned.
Draco’s thumb began moving again across Harry’s palm, a little firmer this time, though it took him a moment to respond. When he did, he said, “I understand.”
Harry spoke around a mouthful of hot tomato soup. "What do they say?"
Harry laughed despite himself. “On a good day.”
"Sorry," Harry said, refocusing. "No, I am. Just a bit tired. Say it again?"
"Weight?"
"Bring us that chair there, would you Neville?"
Whether the conversation had helped or not remained to be seen, but he propped her card up at his bedside and hoped it had brought her a modicum of relief.
“See you –” Negasi started, but the flames were already shooting up green and the two aurors were spinning and blurring and vanishing in a jet of smoke.
she says.
"Hi, Professor. Thanks for waiting for me."
“Oh, sod off, all of you,” Harry muttered. He blinked at the Dracos who were sauntering over, four arms crossed over two ridiculous Muggle sweatshirts, two black eyes, two nose studs on two perfect noses. Dizzy, Harry shut his eye again and squinted up. Draco was singular again. “Are you all right?”
Murmurs of agreement from his students. He aimed his wand at the fireplace he’d just vacated, intending to start a non-Floo fire, and flames roared up so loud and hot that half the class jumped. Harry winced. His control was shot this morning; most of his effort was going into simply not collapsing.
“Hello,” she said, peering around him. “Was that you at the door, then?”
Harry cocked his head speculatively but Malfoy said, "Are you mad? If this one starts tromping around as if he's an elephant he'll never walk again."
“Aren’t you absolutely freezing?”
“Don’t say my name like that,” Harry said furiously.
It was decided that they would split a bottle of wine, and Harry tried not to read too much into this. But wine, that was date stuff, wasn’t it? If it wasn’t a date, they’d be drinking beer, wouldn’t they? Harry would, at any rate… but probably Draco always had wine, probably this didn’t mean anything, and if Harry had not fully admitted it to himself before, this panicked internal conversation would have convinced him: he
Very gently, Draco set Harry’s glasses on his face, fingers barely brushing Harry’s cheeks. The rest of the pink room crystallized. “I’m fine,” Draco said. “Alive, thanks to you.”
“My point’s not that we’re old,” Neville said, “it’s that I can tell by now when you’ve had a fight with someone. And…” He glanced at Harry with an expression that, on anyone other than Neville Longbottom, might have been almost sly. “I can tell when you’re feeling other things, too.”
"Nearly getting ourselves killed at every turn, yeah, I think I recall." Neville sipped his wine. "You were the mastermind back then, Harry, so go on -- suggest something."
is fun," Neville said.
"Also," Malfoy went on, as if determined to get something out, "I haven't forgotten that you saved my life. In the Room of Requirement. So -- I owe you my life. I wouldn't try and take yours."
Sweet Merlin, this was dismal.
"It may not taste very nice."
Finally, finally, finally, the meal was over, the students had been gathered by the prefects, the professors Harry didn't know had all shaken his hand and introduced themselves, and Harry at last was free to go. It was with some difficulty that he got to his feet, hip stiff as a board, and took an exploratory step before deciding it was for everyone's good if he waited til the room cleared a bit before he tackled those five stairs and the vast expanse of the Great Hall. He didn't even want to think about the five staircases that lay before him and his bed.
"Whatever you've been drinking."
He hadn’t returned since he’d been hurt, and it hit him like a blow.
"Neville says Malfoy's so bad anymore," Ron said.
"So that's... nine, that you know of."
To his surprise, she raised it to her nose and closed her eyes. A moment later, they flew open, huge and clear. She was staring at Harry. "Phoenix?"
"Hanna," he said. "Stay back. Stay back, please." He tried to keep his voice calm. He didn't want to alarm her.
"I'll do it this week," Harry said. "Poor kid, I wish I'd known earlier. Thanks for telling me." A sudden thought occurred to him and he said, "Did any of the other two have kids I'm teaching?"
Getting dressed was always a bit trickier than getting undressed, but he managed it pretty smoothly, he thought. Malfoy didn't seem to notice how little he used his left arm and he didn't try to hide the buttoning charm, or the charm to tie his shoes; better Malfoy think he was lazy rather than secretive, because secretive implied secrets and secrets invited questions. He packed up his notebook and quills and the stack of essays he hadn't even touched and slung his bag over his good shoulder as Malfoy waited.
"I don't -- what are we even looking at?" Neville said, looking round in confusion.
The ceiling was pink.
“Oh, what now?” Draco said, but Harry could see that not-a-smile smile playing around his lips. “Are you going to accuse me again of playing Healer?”
The girls behind her started giggling.
She took out her wand and accio'd a notebook and pen -- not a quill, he noticed -- and sat into a chair across from him. "Mind if I ask you a few questions? Other than the few questions I just asked you!"
Harry rolled his eyes good naturedly and loosened his grip.
“A lot of people.”
"And that's the only side effect?"
George's brows shot up. "Doth my one remaining ear deceive me? Malfoy? Are we talking about
He'd used to like billiards, and he let himself get a bit melancholy for a moment about all the things he'd used to like and couldn't do anymore, but then Malfoy said, "Potter, your turn."
"Yes," said Malfoy. "It's very good exercise."
"See you back at the castle," Draco said, and strode off on those long, long legs.
"Up all night," Malfoy said, languidly reclined with an arm draped casually across the back of the couch. "Does this mean we've had 'fun,' by your standards?"
"The Floo --"
"It – it is true," Harry said, flushing to think one of his students had seen it, and Jacob let out a tiny high-pitched scream, like a teakettle, and fell sideways out of his desk. Harry, who'd been leaning against a wall, pitched forward in such alarm that he almost fell, whipping out his wand. "What's happened? Jacob?"
He put his hand in his pocket for his wand, feeling around in the fabric, fingers groping, searching, and the truth was so extremely bad, so ludicrously unlucky, that it took him a very long time to accept it.
"Bangers and mash?" Ron said, grinning. "With the uncooked frankfurters and instant oatmeal?"
Please, Harry thought, please, please, please don't let it be --
"If you do make an appointment, you can tell Betsy I sent you. She's a good friend."
To his surprise, someone else came to his rescue. "He did defend himself!" said a dark-skinned girl with very short black curls, a Gryffindor named – Harry checked his list -- Hanna Seid. "He killed the wizards who kidnapped him!"
"Good, yeah," Neville gulped, and turned back to his food. Harry would feel guilty later but for now he just felt tired. Tired of everything but especially of himself.
If everything went smoothly, he didn’t add, but Negasi shrugged and nodded. Then, preparing to apparate, he grabbed Harry roughly by his bad arm.
Harry swallowed. “I’m sorry you had to find me at all,” he said. “I mean – I’m sorry you had to see that. What I did to those wizards.”
“Draco,” said Kevari, still looking at Harry, “I’d be glad to administer a much-needed potion to your friend, but I’m afraid I can’t do it until you’re sat down safely in the kitchen being looked-over by Healer Seidman.”
"Did you hear," Neville asked him over lunch the next day, "that Draco's been getting Howlers every morning? It's why he's never got any mail at breakfast, he has it delivered to his room so he doesn't scare the students."
Ron looked up, then, and waved, and Harry turned to see Hermione rushing towards them, holding a glass of wine and looking rather chic in an ankle-length trench coat and silk scarf. She was on them in an instant, swooping down to kiss Harry and then Rosie.
“A chip?” Harry said indignantly. “What chip?”
Harry said, “It took me a while to realize that.”
“That’s what Mum said. Hey, d’you think I could have your autograph?”
"This potion is incredible," Harry blurted.
"It's all right," Harry assured him, following him through the doors of the Great Hall, trying not to get trampled by teenagers, "I won't tell her you told me."
Neville gave him a slightly misty look, and Harry, flushing, tried to distract him by adding, “I’m more like Mad-Eye every day, aren’t I? Paranoid, crippled, half-barmy…”
"I've got to pass," he said. "Not the job for me."
“I’m all right,” Harry said immediately, but even to his ears the lie rang false. Despite his best efforts at denial he was beginning to accept the fact that he was working under a dual timeframe: not only was he desperate to find Draco before anything irrevocable happened, but he was struggling against the ticking clock of his own body, whose hour hand was nearing closer and closer to midnight. He could feel it trying to shut down and this enraged him as much as it scared him. After all they’d been through together, he and his body, this could not be the moment their teamwork dissolved.
So instead he did something he
“Come along downstairs,” she said, then paused as he began to move towards her, seeming to see his cane for the first time. “What --?”
“You too,” Harry said. “But – and don’t take this the wrong way – why’re you here?”
"Yes, eleven."
"Sorry," he said, yawning, "One moment," and put his head on the desk and fell instantly asleep.
the pureblood traitor. Stands to reason she'd want her daughter to get his magic.”
"How'd you kill them?" someone wanted to know.
"You see, the damage, the weakness, it's still there, but you have no pain to warn you about it. So move very cautiously or you'll have more to deal with later."
,” shrieked the Howler, the horrible roar of it echoing through the entire Great Hall. “
Harry, it seemed, was destined to be an unwilling symbol for the rest of his life.
The door flew open. Harry stepped inside.
“I hope so,” Harry said. “I don’t mind if everyone thinks I’m mad and paranoid, so long as Draco’s all right.”
"I feel as if I can't hold a baby and a pint at the same time," Harry said, twitching the useless fingers of his left hand in demonstration. "D'you mind--"
"Actually, no," said Harry. "Believe me, I wish I could sit here and happily tell you how awful he is, but... he's been decidedly... not."
Negasi wasn’t here either, which meant he either hadn’t gotten Harry’s message yet or was busy with something else – though Harry felt certain he’d have sent someone in his place, if the latter were the case. Probably he would be here soon. Meanwhile Harry went to the bar and cleared his throat so the bartender, a heavyset young man in a sportsball t-shirt who was polishing a wine glass, turned around.
Malfoy, have you been spending time with Muggles?"
Malfoy appeared on the stair. All Hanna's beautiful bubbles burst at once. He paused when he saw Harry, his mouth tightening, then continued up until he was standing before him, so tall that Harry didn't have to energy to look higher than his chest. Slowly, gracefully, Malfoy sank to his knees, until he was crouched in front of Harry and looking him straight in the face. His eyes were blue as an ice field.
"Sorry," Malfoy muttered. "It's -- I've tried everything to get it off, but... Well, everyone regrets the tattoos of their youth, don't they?"
"Turned out all right, didn't he?" Neville said. "Come Valentines, all the students send him love notes and he gets horribly embarrassed, it's excellent."
"Do you do that often, come here and swim?"
"I remembered pretty quickly after that," Malfoy said, still giggling, "and then -- then you woke up."
"Potter," said Malfoy. "That's not half bad."
Frustrated, Harry fell silent. Years of coaching from Hermione and still he could never find the right words to talk about his feelings. What
He strode off towards the fireplace, Negasi in his wake, though he kept glancing worriedly back at Harry.
Her eyes filled with tears and she hung her head, clearly trying not to cry. "You wouldn't be mad at me?" she said. "If I were sad about him?"
Harry felt himself grinning. "Oh, absolutely. I seem to remember her admiring you very much. It was my own mother's name, you know -- Lily." What had possessed him to add this?
“See you soon,” Neville said firmly.
"I think she'd let you go tomorrow," Malfoy said. "It's a medical reason, she can't very well say no. Betsy closes shop at eight so you'd have plenty of time after class."
“Better,” Draco said. “And you’ll want to keep it perfectly in line with the ankle on your bad leg, don’t –”
“It’s often used for love potions,” she said. “And it’s integral in the potion to find a good accountant.”
“Here we go,” he muttered. Malfoy gave him a questioning look that Harry pretended not to see, and a moment later, they were in the thick of it.
She was leading him into the basement.
“Why’s it have to be you that goes? Hermione’s in a court session for another hour and a half, but I can Floo her when she’s done and she’ll send –”
“You like me?” Harry blurted out. “I mean, you --
“Well,” said Kevari cheerfully, “now we know what happens when you flout all advice and completely overextend yourself. In bad weather, no less, which hasn’t helped matters at all.”
"Isn't it odd," said Hermione, "how good he is at this? The house-husband thing?"
“So,” Harry said. “Er – how did you meet Betsy, anyway?”
"Here, put out your leg, I'll do it. Bend it just a bit, it'll feel better when you take the charm off later. Yes, like that."
Malfoy waited patiently to see if there was more, then said, "Do you want to yell about other invented slights? Or will you answer the question?"
“I had a shite weekend,” Harry said cheerfully. “But I’m hoping the week will be better. Now, if you could all line yourself up according to height…”
"Honestly?" Harry said. "What I'd really like to do is maybe sit in one place and not move."
“Of course you are,” said Jacob. “We completely understand. Very official.” He winked extravagantly.
Harry crossed the room to the chair, too-aware of Malfoy's eyes on him, trying very hard not to limp more than he had to. The chair was extraordinarily low and aggressively uncomfortable and the moment he'd sat down, he knew he should get right back up, but it was too late to do so without looking very odd. All the cabinets, he noted, had what looked like the same style of lock, which was vaguely familiar. Maybe they'd used them in the auror department?
"How're you feeling today, Professory Malfoy?" Harry asked.
“I did a preliminary examination,” Draco repeated, color high in his cheeks, “while he was unconscious, just to make sure nothing was broken. Or about to kill him, which I’m pleased to report nothing is – not internally, at any rate. If you wish, I’ll share the initial diagnostic.”
He'd been levitated in that basement last year, his body spun in circles as they'd cast their agonizing, well-planned curses, making sure it hurt, making sure it could never be fixed. He'd been levitated at St. Mungo's when he couldn't stand, floated from room to room, helpless. He'd thought of the Muggles the Death Eaters had levitated at the Quidditch Cup all those years ago, puppets hanging from invisible strings. No. Mobilicorpus was not a spell he'd allow on himself if he could help it; he knew from all-too-recent experiments with it that he'd be left shaky and twitching for hours afterwards. The help was not worth the horror.
"I had a group of students wanting to know how many Floos there are in the castle, total," she said. "It's a matter of public record, so I told them: Eleven."
“You were called in just for today, then?”
"We used to go to these Muggle counseling sessions together," Malfoy said. He had a thin gold ring on his thumb that he was clanking nervously against his glass. "For people who'd grown up in -- in what the Muggles call hate groups. A lot of the people there were from very extreme religious organizations and the like, and Blaise and I mostly just listened. But it was good to be around people who... understood how deep such an upbringing goes. People who didn't spit on me when they saw the Dark Mark. Not," Malfoy said hastily, "that I'm asking for sympathy about that. Spit is far better than what most Death Eaters did to people they disagreed with."
Malfoy was indeed making his way towards them, looking as put-together as always but with a bit of a tired blue shadow under his eyes, and Harry found himself grinning. They'd made a rather sizeable dent in the bottle of that catnip whiskey and had ended up in the library at 3am trying to find a book to settle a bet about the origins of the "accio" charm. Harry knew they'd figured it out eventually but he couldn't remember who'd won.
"Did someone assign a project?" Harry wondered, but the professors all looked around at one another, shrugging.
He took a moment to sight his target and aim, then he took a deep breath, and let the cue ball fly. It knocked into the 9 with a satisfying
"No," Neville said. "No one's been able to track them yet."
Ron said something as well, but Harry didn't hear it. He was already asleep.
Harry took another bite of soup, then pushed his bowl away. His appetite was gone. "I'll give you this," he said. "He hasn't poisoned me yet."
“Merlin, is that true? How’ve we gotten so old?”
But Harry didn’t answer. He was grappling with the sight of the hallway, wooden-walled and candle-sconced, the scent of fire and magic and coffee permeating every corner, familiar sounds coming from behind familiar doors: little bangs, big rattles, someone yelling, someone laughing. The Auror department, where he’d come every day for nearly ten years, longer even than he’d been at Hogwarts; where he’d made a place for himself, proven himself over and over, risen through the ranks, had a second coming-of-age – turned into a grownup.
