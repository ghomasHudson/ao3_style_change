hurt the boy I fell for. I will be very glad to see his father behind bars as soon as this war is over and he can rot in there for all I care.
Mcgonagall stood up slowly with eyes alight with flames. "Mr. Malfoy, I think they understand your perspective. Please, calm down."
The shrill tone of Draco's voice only brought a soft pounding inside of my head. My head was already swimming with thoughts and muddled by whispered requests all made by other people. I grimaced, rubbing my temples as I shuffled over to flop on the bed at the back of the center of the room. I could vaguely hear the Slytherin huff in either defeat or distaste, I wasn't sure and I didn't care either way. It would take a bulldozer to move me off of this bed as I sank deep into the cloud like mattress and all of the tension seemed to magically seep from my body into the springs below.
"I said, let me see," I said once again as evenly as possible even if the sight made my heart well painfully in my chest.
There was a desk of chipping oak wood filled with cluttered papers and books opposite the door, a full body mirror hung upon the dark green walls decorated with moving pictures of scenery and multiple different people I had no idea who they were. I suppose they must be idols of some sort considering none of them looked alike (not family) and yet they were well taken care of. There was only one four poster bed which was weird to see since there were supposed to be three others in one dorm room. I was surprised to see a makeshift bookcase made out of stacked crates and jammed full of multicolored books all of different sizes, but all worn down to the last seams. It was also odd to see Slytherin colors instead of a Gryffindor room as well considering members of other houses aren't allowed in other common rooms, so dorm rooms are definitely off the table. The blankets on the bed were dark green with silver and black borders with the large Slytherin snake directly in the middle and the same colors painted the walls with the pillows being white and the rug just beside the bed on the left side, a dark green. There was a wooden chest at the foot of the bed with what looks to be a blanket made of all four houses rather than just Syltherin as you would suspect. I think I was most surprised to see the boy of my obsession standing beside a comfortable looking black chair, looking confusedly around the room as if it changed right under his feet.
Blaise gets up from the couch, “Ronald,” he says steering away the Weasel’s attention from Theo. “Yesterday I bought and antique chess set. Want to see?”
“We were about 8 or 9,” Greg continues, while wrapping an arm around his girlfriend’s waist as she laughs hysterically on his shoulder. “Draco dressed up in one of his mother’s dresses because Vince and I refused to. He had drawn a lightning scar on Vince’s face and the I proceeded to marry Draco Lucius Black Potter to his true love of his life, Harry Potter.”
“I’m fine!” Draco insists when he finally manages to get free from the belt and stumble out of the car.
“That’s none of your business Malfoy. You’re just here to do the research.” Johnson snaps then stalks off.
“He’s both our best man. And he’s the best at it!” Theo waves at guests across the room, “See you two later. Thanks for coming Harry!”
“Well not really,” Harry scratches the back of his head, “I finished my training in England, but I didn’t become an auror in England. When I was in Romania there was a lot of petty crimes that I started trying to stop it and made contact with Kingsley and Gawain telling them we should do something about it. They let me set up a little auror force, which was basically me and Avery, sometimes Ron and Charlie when we needed backup.”
“No of course not. Do you honestly think I would break up with one of my best friends just because someone flirted with me?”
Draco wakes up, ultraviolet morning light coming through the window, he stretches. When he doesn’t feel anything, he shoots up and his eyes snap open. Harry’s not there. And there’s no note, like he leaves when he has an early day.
“As you probably know, I was raised by my aunt and uncle.” Harry explains, “And they didn't really like my parents or anything out of order or wizardingly. So, they made me help with chores, gave me my cousin Dudley’s clothes and made me sleep in the cupboard under the stairs.”
Blaise snickers and they both turn to look at Draco, he’s muttering at Greg and Blaise as he stares over at the Gryffindor table. Like he’s been doing almost every meal since first year. He doesn’t even bother looking down at his plate as he pokes furiously at his chicken breast and potatoes. The looks on Greg’s and Pansy’s faces show that he’s muttering about Potter again. Everyone knows that Draco has a crush on Potter, though he still pretends he doesn’t. Draco is just lucky that Potter is so bloody oblivious, because Theo suspects Hermione knows. Weasley might even know.
Harry puts a hand on Draco’s leg as he leans over to Blaise, “Ron was really flattered you liked him you know. He often thinks he’s not as special. He probably doesn’t know how to show it though, cause he’s never been with a bloke you know.” Harry’s rambling and clearly a bit drunk.
“Yes, sure.” She gathers her books a parchments hastily. “See you later, Theo.” She says with a wistful smile. Then catches up with her boyfriend.
“That’s too bad.” Ronald moves from the bed and Blaise shoots up, grabbing one of Weasley’s wrists. “Where are you going?”
“Malfoy.” Harry says with a curt nod. “I’m sorry I didn’t know you were busy.” Harry says to Robards, “I can come back later.”
Theo hopes the library is the best place to ´accidently´ bump into her. He and Hermione have studied together here a few times. Well not really together but they sat at the same table and exchanged a few smiles. In arithmancy, where there´s no Weasley and no Potter, they sit next to each other and make assignments together. When it´s quiet in the common room or they had a particular hard assignment, they study together. But in the weekends Hermione tends to spend most of her time with Weasley. However, Theo hopes Blaise was able to occupy Weasley so Theo can spend time with Hermione and try his flirting skills.
“Yeah,” Theo says gathering his parchments. “I was wondering, I mean maybe if you’re free. We could, you know, go to the library to answer these questions together?”
His friends are still angry at him for not telling them about Draco and leading Ginny on. He understands it all. He does, but all he really wants is Draco back. To go back to their apartment, make love in their bed, hold each other close on the couch and bicker in the kitchen.
Draco takes that opportunity to pull of Potter’s sweater and undershirt. Then he shrugs of his own, new, sweater. Potter helping him with the last bit.
He takes a deep breath before knocking softly on the door. He pushes it open. Harry sits on his side of the bed, his back to Draco.
“Besides, that’s not what we were doing,” Harry continues, “We had lunch. This picture is just her kissing me goodbye.”
Draco slides on the bench, Michael sliding in after him. Dan sits in the stool opposite of Draco and immediately rubs his feet against Draco’s. Draco recoils not pleased with the casual touches of a stranger.
“But,” Harry continues before Draco gets to say anything. “most surprisingly was that this guy was my worst enemy, my archnemeses in school. And here he was in a place I never thought I’d see him, with muggles! Muggles. I thought he hated muggles. But then again I haven’t seen him in 7 years. So of course I’m curious to know what’s been going on with him.”
But now, seeing this article. Draco doesn’t know what to think. Sure, he knows you shouldn’t trust anything the Prophet writes. But it’s the picture that’s bothering him.
Harry doesn’t say anything when he comes and casts a cleaning charm. Draco crawls into their bed, he looks up at Harry, “You’re still dressed?”
Draco takes a deep breath, “I love you!” he screams for whatever he’s worth, “Isn’t that the worst thing you ever heard?”
“Well I was going to take a good look soak in my bathtub to try and erase all the knots in my muscles.” Draco says glancing at Harry from under his lashes.
“Blaise is not trying to find your weak spot, Draco.” Theo urges. “He’s into Weasley and needs you to distract Potter.”
“I´ve been eyeing your bath since the moment I first saw it. It looked almost like the one from the prefect’s bathroom back at Hogwarts. You know I don´t have a bath like that at my place.” Harry grins cheekily.
He braces a hand on either side of his hips and flicks his tongue against Harry’s stomach. He can feel Harry gasp against his lips. Draco slightly sucks the liquid from Harry’s stomach, and when he hears a moan escape from Harry, Draco can’t help but smirk against Harry’s stomach. With new vigour Draco slowly makes his way up with kisses and licks. When he reaches Harry’s chest and doesn’t taste any more whiskey he pulls away. Harry, however, doesn’t seem to agree with that and pushes Draco over on his back and kisses his lips eagerly. “Merlin,” Harry says as he pulls away slightly to breath, “That was so hot.”
“You really don’t want to know what we heard. Thank Merlin we didn’t see anything.” Greg says walking up to the couch and grabbing Pansy around her waist.
With a switch of his hand Harry cleans up the mess they made and if Draco hadn’t just come, he’d be turned on again.
Harry pushes Draco flat on his back on the soft sheets of his bed and he kneels down, pressing kisses on Draco’s stomach. His tongue flicking just above the waistband, his hands undoing Draco’s trousers and he pulls both the trousers as the pants down at once. He kisses Draco’s inner thigh, before pulling the off entirely. “Harry” Draco murmurs, his hand burying itself in Harry’s hair.
Ginny firecalled and asked him to go out to lunch. Harry hesitated, but Ron urged him to go. So, he went. He should have known better then to go against his feelings. Because Merlin it was awful. As soon as they sat down, Ginny started talking about how they were both still single and older and wiser then when they’d broken up. And how she was ready now, that he should be ready now as well. He seemed like he was ready.
Draco tries to stay positive, maybe Harry’s downstairs in the kitchen, like he was the first morning.
Sunday morning finds Blaise in the quidditch stands on the Hogwarts grounds. A book I one hand, though he doesn’t even bother pretending to read. A friendly quidditch game between the eight years is in full motion on the field. His eyes are trained on the hoops on the right side of the pitch. Ronald’s circling the hoops expertly. He hasn’t let a quaffle through yet. And though Blaise doesn’t like to play himself, he does enjoy making bets on the quidditch league. He likes looking at the game, trying to anticipate who’s going where and who’s going to score. Right now, though, he isn’t paying attention to any of theat. The keeper in Red pulling all his attention. He just looks so damn good, his broad shoulders visible as he circles the hoops waiting for the Chasers to come and try to score. His leg muscles tight around his broom. And when he bends over to speed up Blaise gets a good view of his ass. And that does things to Blaise. Salazar, he looks just so good. Blaise would love to get his hands on him. Or even the other way around, Blaise isn’t picky. He’s seen how touchy-feely Ronald can be. It makes Blaise jealous especially because it seems like Ron’s girlfriend doesn’t seem to appreciate all the attention, he gives her. But if Blaise can’t get Ronald to turn his attention to himself, he’ll just keep on looking. He picked this spot for a reason after all.
“I didn’t think I’d see the day.” Draco Malfoy stalks towards Harry with a glass of Champagne in his hand. He has his suit jacket draped over one arm and his bowtie is hanging loosely around his neck.
They’re tangled between the sheets, basking in the Afterglow. Still clinging to each other’s lips. The way Harry kisses him is like the religion’s in his lips. Draco thinks they might just get away with this, staying in bed the whole weekend without anyone bothering them. He has cancelled his Sunday dinner with his parents and Harry told him he didn’t have to go to his usual lunch with his Weasleys.
Harry follows Malfoy out of Robards office down the auror office to the lifts. “Want to grab lunch?” Malfoy asks casually not looking at Harry.
“You told me he was handsome yes. Which is an understatement. And you told me he spend a lot of time and attention on his appearance,”
Draco knows he and Harry aren’t a public relationship, but he at least thought they were in one. He even thought they were on their way to maybe take their relationship public. Harry is here every night now. His stuff is here, they’re practically living together. Even though they haven’t said it out loud, Harry calls this place home for Merlin’s sake! They even have a planned date night. The only thing their relationship doesn’t have is publicity. They don’t go out together in the wizarding world, at least not without Draco wearing an insane amount of glamours. And they haven’t told their friends, because the more people know the easier it would be for the press to find out. At least that’s what Draco’s been telling himself.
“I know but you’ve completed your training four years ago and you did amazing things in Romania. The skill you’ve shown there has both me and Kingsley convinced you’re the best option for this position.”
Blaise snatches Draco’s glass from him and pushes him up. He stumbles but Harry catches him. When he straightens Draco realises, he’s a few inches taller than Harry, and they’re standing close. Really close. Draco can see the golden flecks in Harry’s green eyes, just before they flatter shut.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Nott, shut your mouth!” Blaise says at the same time that Draco says, “The Weasel? The orange orangutan? Seriously that’s who you’ve settled on?”
The curtains are pulled open and Granger and Weasley stare at them. “You did.” Harry says. Then he turns to his friends. “Hey.”
Harry’s face breaks into a bright smile and wraps his arms around Draco’s neck pulling him close. He kisses him deeply, slowly and Draco savours the moment. “Now about the rest.” Harry starts.
Draco blinks back the tears that form in the corners of his eyes. He though they made up yesterday. He apologised elaborately and Harry kissed him. He fucked him. He can’t have gone after he did that to Draco. Could he?
“Besides Ron and I have been dating since the summer and we’ve always been confused about our relationship. But we’ve wanted to try and at Hogwarts we had more space away from each other and re-met some people and both of us realised we’re just friends.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“I don’t know. I don’t think so.” Harry worries his bottom lip between his teeth, “But that’s not why I’m here.” He looks up at Draco and grins. “Come.” He grabs Draco’s wrist and pulls him to the living room.
Potter leans in and kisses him again. Softer this time. Draco lets himself melt into the kiss and deepens it. He sneaks his hands under Potter’s sweater, trailing over his back, nails scratching. Potter groans deep in his throat and pulls slightly away from Draco.
“Before Luna and Ginny are getting married there’s the wedding from Dean and Seamus and Millicent and Theo and later this year Gregory and Susan are getting married. And then there’s Michael and Padma and Blaise and Lavender. And Parvatti is marrying a guy from Beauxbatons, his names is Pierre if I remember correctly. And of course Neville is marrying Hannah. Oh and Ronald your mother did tell me about Avery you know. Are you guys planning on marrying this year?”
“Yes, like that.” Draco gasps and tilts his head back against the door. And Harry nips on the sensitive skin on his neck, while rubbing their hips together and his fingers work hastily on the buttons of Draco’s shirt. Once he finished the buttons of his shirt Harry pulls Draco from the door and shoves it off.
Harry lingers a little longer near the fireplace before turning around. “Did Mister Malfoy leave, master?”
Harry nods, trailing his hands over Draco’s bare chest, leaving Goosebumps in his wake. “You’re hot. So beautiful like this.”
“At least we can blame it on our jobs.” Malfoy smirks, “Head auror and master healer. We don’t have time for relationships.”
“I swear Draco, I can make you feel so good.” Dan’s face closes in and Draco turns his head just in time, the world spins.
“We’ve decided it will take place somewhere in June. That reminds me,” Ginny says, “Now you’re back we need to get you fitted for robes. ‘Moine?”
“Yeah. He died at the battle of Hogwarts all those years ago. I hadn’t seen his brother in years, but Seamus and Dean ran into him and he told them he wanted to give Colin’s old camera to me. So, they took him along yesterday. Dennis explained how to use it.” Harry looks up at Draco and smirks, “Want to try it?”
Draco downs the potion, ignoring the foul taste. It takes a minute for the potion to work. And when it does Draco blinks a few times at Harry, before taking a deep breath. “What the fuck?”
Begrudgingly Draco does, scowling at Harry’s back. “What’s happened here?” Harry asks, trying for some small talk.
Potter pulls away, loops his fingers through one of Draco’s beltloops and pulls him along to his bed. Potter turns around with a grin and Draco raises his eyebrow in question. With one hand on his chest Potter pushes Draco, not hard but Draco lets himself fall on his back on the bed. He shrugs of his shoes and crawls further on the bed till his head is on the pillow.
Millicent shrugs, “You said you fancy boys. I want to test it. You know all the girls will be sad, but at least we’ll know.”
“You do not.” Hermione and Pansy insist at the same time. “Just ask anyone at the wedding.” Pansy encourages him.
“What?!” Draco asks at the same time as Harry lays down with his hands behind his head, a blush spread across his cheeks and on his throat.
“Well Harry than you are at least less pathetic than one person. Since you’ve had one relationship after Hogwarts.” Ron jokes and Pansy snickers.
Potter also kicks of his shoes then crawls on top of Draco, “Okay?” he asks, his face inches away from Draco’s.
“Draco why are you crying. Don´t be sad.” Harry takes his head in his hand and presses another kiss against his forehead. “Let´s get you to bed.” He takes Draco´s hand and leads him to the steps up to the apartment. He doesn´t let go of Draco´s hand all the way to the bedroom and when they´ve crawled back in bed together Harry holds him close and presses kisses in his hair until Draco falls asleep.
He knows that it makes his mother sad. That he doesn’t come over nearly as much as she would like. But Draco can barely stand to be inside the manor. The place where Voldemort, his awful snake and Draco’s own horrible aunt tormented him still haunts Draco in his dreams from time to time. Though he hasn’t had as bad night’s sleep since the first night he spent with Harry. The nights when Harry stays over are free from bad dreams at all. When Harry isn’t there, he’s in most of Draco’s dreams anyway.
Ronald is a challenge. One that Blaise would love to win. If the redhead just gave a change to play.
“Oh right, I forgot. You always make someone else eat. You don’t like to do it yourself and you shouldn’t have to the saviour, -”
“Oh, come off it Malfoy. I’ve forgiven you.” Harry says with a bright smile. Draco stares at Potter, trying to come up with a response, but all the reasonable thoughts leave his mind. He just gapes at Potter, unable to close his mouth.
Draco tangles his fingers in Potter’s hair. And Potter grabs Draco’s hips pushing them against himself. One of Potter’s hands sneak around Draco’s hips and cups Draco’s bum.  Draco gasps and Potter pulls him even closer. They’re both hard now and their erections rub against each other’s thighs.
"I don't know. But now we know let's use it to our advantage." Blaise flashes Theo a smile, who grins back.
Draco hurries out of the apartment. It’s cold outside and the autumn wind tears at his clothes, before he apparates away.
“Potter will mope about it, trying to get Weasley to stay, because Draco’s here talking to us. But then,” Pansy pauses for effect. “Draco will ask Greg for some one on one Quidditch game. Greg will refuse and Draco will say, loudly, ‘but I wanted to play quidditch so bad.’” Pansy mimics Draco’s voice horribly.
Hermione’s laughing about some joke Theo made about a grammar mistake in their book. A strand of hair has escaped her ponytail and Theo leans close to tug it behind her ear. Hermione stills and looks into Theo’s eyes.
Harry places the camera on the kitchen counter and pulled Draco towards him, pressing sloppy kiss on his temple. “Missed you.” He mumbles. Draco smiles as Harry waves his hand and mutters under his breath. After a couple of flashes Harry grabs the camera and pulls the pictures from beneath it. “This one is nice.” He hands a photo to Draco.
“Ahh,” an awful grin spreads on Draco’s face. The one he always gets when he gathers useful information. “But Potter and the Weaslette broke up months ago.”
“Fuck,” Ronald mutters under his breath, and moves his king, trying to free it from Blaise’s bishop’s grip, a rooky move that he never would’ve made if he wasn’t so flustered.
Draco sighs and starts towards the archives down in the dark belly of the ministry. When he reaches the breakroom, he decides to grab a cup of tea and a sandwich for lunch first. Salazar knows he´s going to be stuck down in Archives all day.
“For Merlin’s sake!” Harry speaks up, “Butt out of my life. I’m fine! Really I don’t need a date to the weddings and Malfoy and I were just talking about work.”
Lavender settles down Pansy, “That wasn’t nearly satisfying enough.” She whispers before she shouts at Granger that it’s her turn.
There’s a picture of them walking with their arms around each other back from Draco’s birthday dinner at the Golden Dragon two days ago. “Because your glamour is shit.” Draco snickers.
“It’s like that time Potter ignored him, remember that?” Blaise nudges Greg with his elbow and they both snickers.
“You’re right. I’ll take you anywhere you want. I won’t keep you hidden away any longer. We can go to the best wizarding restaurants without any glamours. I’ll take you to the burrow for Sunday dinners. I’ll even go with you to the Manor to meet with your parents. And we´ll finally go on that holiday we talked about.” Harry sits down next to Draco and tangles their fingers. “Please Draco. I love you.”
“Okay not the worst.” Harry says and Draco looks triumphant, “But one of the worst without Voldemort's involvement.” Harry can't help but chuckle when Draco frowns.
He pushes himself out of bed and moves to his wardrobe, he grabs a pair of pants, trousers and a shirt. He forgoes socks and shoes when he hears something clattering in the kitchen. Draco takes two steps at a time as he runs down the stairs. He halts in the doorway, when he spots Harry in a pair of Draco’s boxers cooking something in his new kitchen. A kitchen Draco has never used before, but now Harry Potter is making breakfast for two there. “You’re still here?” Draco blurts.
Hermione whose eyes have been ping ponging between Ron and Avery now looks at Harry, “What do you mean ‘Harry’s usual type’? I thought he didn’t date anyone in Romania.”
Right now he’s laying with his head on her lap and she’s trailing her fingers through his hair, just like she used to do back at Hogwarts. Greg is in the kitchen cleaning up after dinner. She tried to pry a name from him, but when he wouldn’t budge, she let it go and settled in on comforting him and force feeding him.
When they parted, on the pavement outside of the lunchroom, she kissed his cheek and said that he should really think about what she had said. That Ron and her parents would love it if he agreed. Ron and her parents that what she said. Not herself. The entire lunch she didn’t mention once that she loved him or wanted to be with him. Not even that she liked him as anything more than a friend. No, she only said that she was ready for a serious relationship.
Draco settles his enormous tap. The many drinks haven’t made Dan more attractive. And yes, Draco might be desperate, but he’s still desperate for Harry. Not for his annoying friend.
“You can mend it in the morning.” Harry says as he pushes Draco down on the sheets and shoves of his own shoes.
They enter the great hall and start toward the Slytherin table. Blaise spots Draco alone at the table, with a perfect view of Potter. Staring at the chosen one like he always does.
Harry throws a dazzling smile over his shoulder, “I promise it’s a really great restaurant. Even though the place is a bit dodgy.”
“Yes, you pillock! Come here!” Harry opens his arms and Draco presses the frame against his chest as he steps into Harry’s embrace. Harry holds him close and presses a kiss on his temple. “Dinner with Ron and Neville fell through, so I thought I’d just come home, and we could order some dinner.”
“Like what? Myself? Now you don’t like me anymore Harry. You’d rather be with your ginger bitch? Make ugly ginger babies? And-”
Draco narrows his eyes and opens his mouth to say something, but Harry beats him to it, “I'm sorry for stalking you, and I wasn't always the nicest to you either. I guess we were meant to be little pricks to each other.”
He heard her reply something about him not looking like he has eaten in weeks, she frowned and went back to her own plate.
"No, thanks I'm just going to hang with people who don't cheat," Harry said, lifting Teddy up in the air and down again. "Isn't that right Teddy, you don't cheat, do you?"
He adjusted his position—anything to keep his legs from folding—and leaned against Draco, just let the throb of his cock pulse against Draco’s ass. An urgent need to move built up inside of him. It felt as though he would explode if he didn’t move, didn’t slip into something velvety warm. He started to move to his own pulsing, started to grind himself against Draco’s ass—shift away, grind, shift away, grind.
"What the hell is that?" Draco Malfoy asked with wide eyes staring at the nearly invisible snake that was still wriggling.
"I am just giving you; your seven o'clock wake up call," Blaise said grinning backing out the room. "Did you?" He whispered and pointed between Draco and Harry.
"Robards had been blackmailing Harry with the photo's and told us that he had sent them to the prophet, so come morning your gay son will be kissing Harry on the cover of every newspaper," Draco said giving his father a venomous look.
"It's not like you have swapped with anyone bad, Daphne is alright," Harry said, trying to make her feel better.
Anabel held open the door to let in his best friend Hermione Granger. Her bushy hair bounced as she walked into the carrying what looked to be a newspaper. Anabel closed the door behind, and Harry could have sworn he saw her smirk.
His hand readjusted around Draco’s cock and matched the pounding rhythm of his cock in Draco’s ass. In, out, up, down—it was a frenzy of fist and hips. Sweat beaded over their bodies, their mouths opened wide in heavy gasps of air. In, out, up, down.
Draco groaned again, so incredibly hard that he could burst. He itched to end the game and just take the brunette, but he forced himself to hold back, wanting to see how much further Harry was willing to go.
Pleased with himself he did a few more chairs, so they were matching, dark brown wood with a red padded seat. The booths would be trickier and required a more experienced hand. As for the walls and floor, he was going to have to get decorators in. He hoped Pansy Parkinson's Fiance still had his business. He hadn't spoken to her in a few years; they hadn't fallen out, they just drifted apart, he was just grateful she had kept his gay secret out of her magazine; Witch Insider, which is now a bigger seller than Witch weekly.
Harry got off the stage and walked over to his red-haired best friend Ron Weasley and got down on one knee. "Will you Ronald Billius Weasley be my best man?"
The door jingled as it opened which made Draco look up over his glasses to see who had entered, it was only the cleaner, he sighed and put his head back down again, maybe he wouldn't he come, he thought. It was getting close to half twelve now, the time he told him to meet him there, but he was confident he wouldn't come.
"Yes, he told me," She replied coldly. "Ginny and Blaise are in the living room; dinner will be ready soon; it won't be the fancy meals you are used to."
Malfoy didn't respond straight away; he could tell he was running it through his head and wasn't jumping to thinking Harry was crazy.
"Yes, your fourth year, in particular," The first twin said smirking. "That was the year you got turned into a ferret wasn't it?"
Draco ignored him as the grand gates opened slowly and they walked with a stride up the pathway to two large back doors with gold serpent knockers. He pushed open the door, still not speaking as he led him to the Ballroom where a roar of "Suprise" greeted them both.
The blonde couldn’t take it anymore. His blood on fire, Draco crawled forward and nestled between Harry’s parted thighs. Quickly slicking up his fingers, he removed Harry’s slender digits and roughly inserted two of his own into the tight heat, making the brunette cry out as pain-pleasure seared through him.
This wasn’t like him. He couldn’t stop himself from wanting to fuck his way into that inebriation. To force his way so deep inside that he swam in a haze with him.
"Yes," the waitress replied defensively. "And she has a million posters of you all over her bedroom wall, it's a bit obsessive really."
Malfoy rubbed the back of his neck and tilted his head at Harry, he could tell he didn't believe him, and there was no use carrying on the act, but he couldn't possibly work with him again after being caught in bed completely naked.
"Well, what would you like us to talk about?" Draco asked irritably locking his fingers together and resting his chin on them.
"I would like to make a civil truce," Lucius started, which caught Harry's curiosity. "I don't want to make a big deal about it, just agree to be cordial with each other."
"Oh, you're not sitting with us," Hermione said to Harry in an annoyed tone reading off a table chart. "You are on one of the VIP tables."
Blaise turned his head around too and waved at Draco. "I didn't think you were coming," He said raising an eyebrow.
"I am pretty sure you have that covered," He replied looking at the mess around the room that Draco had caused. "Why do you need the tracker?"
Draco had been trying to convince himself for the past half hour to go to Potters and beg him to reconsider joining the team; he was practically their secret weapon, other teams know very well how good he is at Quidditch and being the boy who lived was even better. Draco paced up and down the street muttering to himself quietly. "Fuck it," He said finally as he got back to the bottom of the stairs again. He ran up to the top quickly before he could change his mind and rang the doorbell.
He muttered to himself as he flicked through the rails looking for a suit for Harry to wear tonight. He took out the green silk suit for himself and decided to let wear one of his new black silk ones, and as a bonus, it was matching with the green one, which reminded him of their matching suits at Neville and Hannah's engagement party. He slipped one of the masks into the suit jacket and left the closet.
Harry got into the warm shower and washed with the shower gel Draco had left on the side with a note that said, "This one Potter." Harry couldn't help but roll his eyes again. He liked to sing in the shower; he didn't really have a specific song he just made something up and tried to make it rhyme, it annoyed the hell out of Draco.
Fred and George shared a smile. "Yes, it was in the papers this morning, The Malfoy's selflessly decided to take on the Ball because they are so rich they can do that," Fred said rolling his eyes.
Harry exited the fireplace at Andromeda’s home to see Andromeda and Narcissa in the kitchen, playing peekaboo with Teddy while he sat in his high chair. It was odd to see Andromeda and Narcissa together, as Andromeda looked so much like her batshit crazy sister Bellatrix and Harry had only ever seen Narcissa and Bellatrix together before, and not in the happiest of circumstances.
They posed together in front of the flashing lights and smiled. "Your mother invited me; I take it?" She said behind her smile.
"I think I should go now," Harry cleared his throat, picking up his invisibility cloak and moved towards the door behind Draco.
"Hmm, I wonder where I put them?" He paused then gasped dramatically. "Oh, dear, I think I put them in a pile to be sent to the prophet."
"Oh yeah," Harry lied, he thought it would be easier to agree, as him forgetting things seemed to be a regular argument between them recently.
The shower had warmed up when he got inside; he closed his eyes as the water fell down his face, visions of brooms flying zoomed through his head and a little golden snitch fluttering in front of his face made the corners of his mouth lift up. He was going to be a professional Quidditch player.
"Well it shouldn't be that way, she works for you, and she should feel vulnerable in her position and try to better herself for you."
Harry looked up and saw his boss Gawain Robards strutting towards them with his air of arrogance. "Don't do anything stupid," Harry warned Draco as he stood up.
"Okay, I promise," Draco frowned annoyed everyone was trying to put their input in on His and Harry's relationship, they still hadn't even made it official, had they?
"I have been out on a job for your Father," He replied trying to avoid telling him who he has been working with.
Red-faced again from being caught almost naked, he nodded, though he couldn't see it. "Yeah, yeah... I, uh will." He quickly dressed and slipped under his covers. He wanted to apologise to Malfoy for what Ron had said and hoped it wouldn't affect his chances of being taught by him. "Malfoy?
Malfoy's eyes widened with pleasure; he bit his bottom lip and nodded, taking out his Hawthorn wand. Harry wondered if the replacement wand was in its box back in Tonk's old bedroom collecting dust.
First stop was Madam Malkins where he brought five new suits; three were black silk, the other two emerald green, one were velvet and the other silk. He also brought two masks after struggling to come to a decision of which suit he would end up wearing but was leaning more towards the silk green one. He paid her 825 Galleons, 4 Sickles and 22 Knuts after almost an hour of being poked with pins.
"Don't be so dramatic Draco, he knows who you are, he just doesn't like you," Lucius said from the corner of the room.
Harry locked the door behind him and then sat in his leather desk chair with folded arms. "What do you think you are doing talking to my secretary like that."
Harry felt emotionally drained as he flicked through some more of the pages of 2005 he decided to take a break and see if Draco needed anything. He put the album neatly on the table and wandered slowly downstairs towards the kitchen staring at the photos that were hanging on the walls; he had recognised most of them from the albums he had already seen.
He had been trying to make a shepherds pie for himself and Harry and when he saw the green flames in the fireplace out the corner of his eye. His boyfriend had returned and looked tired and stressed but had a faint smile appear on his lips when he saw Draco in one of Mrs Weasley's frilly pink aprons.
Harry sat down nervously in front of Robards confused by the friendliness and un-characteristicness of the of his tone.
"Well done, Harry," his team cheered as they all dismounted their brooms on the ground. He felt hands pat him as they lined up in their two teams.
"Yes well, times change Ron," Draco said defensively. "As Potter's Manager, it is expected that we will be seen together."
"It was all down to Draco, he recruited Hermione and me to decorate though," Ron smiled proudly then folding over when Hermione hit him in the stomach.
He decided when he got home that he was going to go to Draco's and see what's going on, he can't avoid Harry forever, can he? He thought the plan over in his head when he walked through over the threshold and down the hallway. Someone was in his house; he could sense it. He took his wand out of his robes and walked slowly peering through different doors as he did.
"Oh, no Parvati, that wasn't," He was silenced with her lips on his. He didn't kiss back but slowly dodged his head away. "I'm gay," He said loudly to her, and she moved off him. "It was because of Draco, not you."
Harry suddenly found the teapot on the table to be very interesting, and did everything he could to keep staring at instead of whatever was going on with the Weasleys. He wasn't about to get between Ron and his mother.
He didn't want to have to end things with Draco; he was happy with him for the first time in a year he was enjoying himself. He also didn't want to out Draco to his parents if he wasn't ready.
"I don't care, if you want to know something just ask me," Harry said sitting down at the head of the table breathing hard.
Harry slid his hands up the length of Draco’s arms, followed them to his shoulders, to where his neck stretched. He took a moment to trace the length of that long neck with the sides of his thumbs.
"Mister Malfoy this is Richard Brown, he is our Food Critique," The wizard from daily prophet introduced him.
To both of their dismay, Ernie took Malfoy quite literally and raised the bowl to his lips and drank straight from it.
Nodding, Draco parted his lips and took the man into his mouth. Tenderly, he curled his fingers around the straining shaft, squeezing experimentally. A stifled groan from Harry and he hollowed his cheeks; he sucked and squeezed again.
"You used the imperious curse? Draco gasped angrily, as much as he was annoyed at his father, he would rather not have him go back to Azkaban.
The Ministry of Magic Atrium was filled with witches and wizards rushing back and forth to different departments; it looked a lot different from what Harry remembered but oddly the same also. He wasn't expecting all the attention he was getting, as witches and wizards were stopping him to and saying, Welcome back Auror Potter, We have missed you, Mr Potter, It's not the same without you around here, Mr Potter.
"What made you think I would even want to go out with Malfoy in the first place, we never exactly got on, have we?" Harry said truthfully.
Mr Weasley frowned and shook his head a little too quickly. "Nope, I don't think so, blimey is that the time, I have a meeting to go to," He said looking at his bare arm. "If you will?" He pointed to exit behind him.
Draco broke apart from Harry with a broad smile on his face; he was going to do the best he could to make sure he did a better job than Potter. He just hoped he was drunk enough to deal with Zacharias Smith. He gave him a sideways glance and sighed as he was trying to get the rest of the soup with his tongue. He needed an Order of Merlin first class award after tonight, he thought sourly.
Ernie Macmillan was standing in the kitchen when Harry walked down the stairs running his hands through his hair; he hated it being flat. Mrs Weasley was smiling ear to ear at him; he could see Blaise and Ginny whispering to each other again, which put him on edge slightly, what was so secretive?
Harry took out his wand and made two long stem white roses and lay them in front of the white marble headstone.
He broke out of his daydream and looked at Ginny, "Oh yes, just tired, Morty had me up at seven this morning that's all."
Harry shut his eyes willing the subject to change, but when he felt Draco's hands closed tightly around his own, he knew he would have to talk about it finally. "The only way I am going to be able to tell you what happened is by showing you."
Draco shook the hand of the wizard eyeing him up and down, he had read his columns before, and it was nice to put a face to the writer. He was in his late forties with greying brown hair and goatee; he wore large squared glasses and brown robes. He smiled at Draco, but his black eyes were cold and told a different story.
Draco was bothered by the feelings that entered his mind whenever he encountered the chosen one. The messy brown hair, green eyes, and round spectacles shouldn't affect him this much, shouldn't make him want to tear his clothes off him. Harry was the one who rejected Draco, from day one, Draco was the one that held out that hand for friendship, but Harry was the one that had said no. Draco often re-lived that moment whenever he felt the lust and wanting, take over his conscious thoughts.
"Sure, it's all lies, lies and more lies." Draco passed Harry the paper and was shocked when Harry's lips touched his.
After they had finished their desserts, Astoria strode gracefully out of the dining room like she normally did after their family meals to sit and read in the library by herself. She had kissed Draco lightly on the cheek before she had left to which he wiped away out of habit, he was unaware that his mother always noticed this. They moved out of the dining room to the sitting room where they often sat drinking wine after heavy meals.
Pansy relaxed and lowered herself back into the chair after she seemed to have thought his request through. "Fine, but you only get this one chance, or I spin my own story, photographs, and everything."
"It was all down to Draco, he recruited Hermione and me to decorate though," Ron smiled proudly then folding over when Hermione hit him in the stomach.
"Who kept sending you owls last night?" She asked, sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee.
Lucius sat down in his usual chair and crossed his leg over the other. "Haven't we had this conversation before?"
"Uncle Harry," Teddy had run up to Harry with both hands struggling to hold about five cauldron cakes. "Happy Birthday."
Harry has never wanted to hex someone so bad as he had done that moment; he was foaming at the mouth. He had unforgivable curses swimming around the forefront of his mind ready to use one, but he bit his tongue, very hard. "What do you want?"
"Mr Weasley, with all due respect, you know I work alone, I am perfectly capable of defending myself," Malfoy insisted.
He loved the way Draco kissed, thorough and demanding, delving firmly into his mouth. Harry leaned forward, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck as he couldn’t help but kissed back. With one kiss, Draco could bring out his response; drawing him deeper into the web of passion the blonde was weaving around them. When Draco coaxed his tongue into his mouth, Harry just had to follow. He was breathless when they finally broke the kiss, grey eyes glazed with rising passion, his lips wet and kiss-swollen.
"They send the prophet money all the time when they don't want anything said that might slip out," Fred said.
Harry opened his eyes, feeling a weight on his lap; he smiled when he saw Draco Malfoy's handsome face and grey eyes staring into his, smirking. Draco loosened his tie leaning in and kissing Harry with hard passion as though their life depended on it.
A loud voice shook him from his trance; he turned to the fireplace where a ruffled Draco and angry Ron stood.
Harry felt a little caught off guard by the news of the women being Draco's date and felt a weird sense of jealousy kick in. He looked at Draco, who was staring at his glass of wine intensely.
Draco glared at her and heard his father almost choke on his parsnip. He put his knife and fork down and wiped his mouth on a napkin. "When have I ever given you the notion I want children?"
Harry frowned and nodded slowly as though he was processing the new information. He put his finger on the glass pointing at the door handle. "I knew I saw a fucking snake," He muttered angrily.
"37, Harry, I am 34 not bloody 37." Draco flung the paper at the now laughing Harry. "We were in the same year at school, and I am one month older than you."
"If you liked me you wouldn't be blackmailing Draco or me," Harry replied, not knowing what to think about this out of the blue confession.
Harry bent down and picked up Teddy. "Thank you, Tedster," Harry said smiling. "Are you having a good time?"
Hermione gave him a sharp look and then turned to Harry. "As Patient confidentiality, I am not supposed to tell you, but since Ronald won't keep his mouth shut, I will tell you but you mustn't tell anyone or I will lose my job," Hermione frowned. "I have been nursing Astoria Greengrass at St Mungo's she is severely ill."
He moved next to Harry and went to grab for his hand, but as there was no touching, he settled for hovering his hand next to his.
"Good Morning, Auror Potter," The lady at the desk outside the door greeted him, Jane Honeywell her plaque on the desk said. "How is Draco doing? I still miss him in the secretary lounge; he was the life of the party."
Ginny's hands shook as she slid off her engagement ring, "Me and Harry aren't in love anymore," Ginny said letting a tear run down her face.
"Thanks, guys," Harry said frowning slightly, anyone would think he didn't like the attention, Draco thought.
The sun began to rise a lot quicker as time passed and as they sat watching in silence. They didn't need to say anything, but it was like they had been telling each other about themselves for hours.
"Well I don't know about that, I have never played pro before, I read there was going to be deals going on."
Draco looked up at the now black sky and then nodded slowly. "Yeah, I guess we should, do you want me to take you home?"
Draco's side of the bed was empty when Harry had eventually opened his eyes and rolled over; he did, however, see a blurry note try to come into focus on the pillow. Rubbing his eyes with one hand, he grabbed the note and stuck it close up to his face to read; his glasses were too far away, he thought.
"From my side, it looks rather convenient for you to get your name out there a day before the announcement of the Ball being in your Manor," Harry breathed.
Today was a good day though; Harry reminded himself for the third time that morning. Today Harry would be trying out for a professional Quidditch team, Appleby Arrows. He had heard the team had just come under new management and the new owner wanted a fresh team that will match up to his standards, he had no idea who the new manager was, he assumed it would be an ex-manager from another team, but it was all very hushed up.
"This is why you should trust my judgement more," Draco told him revelling in the fact he knew what he was talking about.
"He will have a tuna sandwich," Draco said, cutting him off with a bored tone taking the menu from his hand and passing them both to the waitress. "Also, another two mugs of coffee, please."
"I have missed you so much, Draco," She cried. "I'm sorry I didn't write to you over the summer, I was in Paris with Mum, and she didn't want me talking to anyone."
"I can give you a second chance." Harry shook Draco's hand, blur. "I'm sorry that was inap.." Harry was kissing Draco, blur. "I am asking you if you want to go for dinner sometime not bloody marriage," blur. "Welcome to our new home," Draco uncovered Harry's eyes at the threshold of Grimmauld Place, blur. "It's all lies, lies and more lies," Draco was circling the daily prophet, blur. "Harry James Potter, will you marry me?" Draco was on one knee, blur.
"You shouldn't have come round my house uninvited, and then come to my bedroom while I was naked." He said whispering the last part and glancing at the door.
Harry wasn't expecting Draco to challenge him like this and it was turning him on. Why the fuck was this turning him on? He asked himself bewildered.
All their jaws dropped in surprise and horror which was Harry's reaction when he had seen him emerge from the tunnel.
"It's not... I mean you... It's fine," Harry was nervous and hated that Draco had always made him nervous.
--to grab his dick in one hand and fist him while the other wrapped around and just held on for the ride.
"Draco, Old chap, amazing party." Blaise Zabini had approached him before he could crawl into the corner and have a mental breakdown.
"Just go to bed, you are drunk," Draco said standing in the fireplace, he waited until his father was out of sight and earshot. "Harry Potter," He whispered.
A man raised his hand. "Draco Malfoy is eighteen, which means he has been of age for a year. He is a legal adult  and is to be tried as one."
“Did you not open your letter? Eighth years have their own common room, and we have new dorm assignments. I’m with you, Ron and Zabini.”
He jumped in his seat as he felt something start wrapping around his feet, he let out a yell for help when he saw Potter's giant snake under the table hissing.
"Speaking of Harry, Ginny is freaking out about his birthday; she doesn't want a repeat of last year, but wants to throw him a party."
"Fine," He said, and they stopped dancing, he took his arm back from around Harry's waist, but kept hold of his hand, they followed his mother off the dance floor and towards the ballroom doors, she had managed to grab, Blaise and his father on the way.
Hermione's face cracked into a smile. "Good now that is out the way, what I was going to suggest is we need to put a disillusionment charm on the boxes, and we can always put the Firewhiskey into different containers."
Harry held his broom and bag of uniform as he started walking out of the stadium with his new teammates, but stopped when Malfoy called him back. He said goodbye to Angelina and Jimmy and turned back around irritably.
Harry and Ron stared open-mouthed at Fred and George. Harry had always heard rumours, but he thought it was just that, especially about Katie Bell.
"No, you said lies, lies and more lies, why did you say that?" Draco's tone wasn't angry; it was startled like he hadn't expected it.
"Giving your circumstances," Robards continued. "I think you should take time to consider what's more important, your job where you are next for Head Auror or," He opened his desk drawer and pulled out a photograph of Harry and Draco on his front porch kissing. "Public humiliation."
"Blaise, she obviously didn't have anything to announce," Narcissa said, shaking her head at him. "Anyway, Draco, plans?"
"That is what I am wondering about; he seems to have a hidden agenda. How has he been acting towards you lately?"
"To be honest with you Harry, for me it's always been you. But as for how we became to be it was January 31st, I was with my mother celebrating my new job; we went to Lucinda's, A fancy restaurant in London."
Harry didn't hear the rest of the sentence; he was already inside his office and running to his desk. The tray with the missing Death Eaters files was empty.
"They have heard that I am in a secret relationship with a woman," Harry replied laughing a little. "They wanted to know who it was."
"Draco, leave it's a trap," Harry on the right shouted as Draco walked into the room and faced them both.
"Just drink this," Granger said softly handing him a potion bottle. She turned to Malfoy, "Thanks for getting me."
They ignored him as Nott put the hair into the flask, he held the bridge of his nose as he drank it quickly and groaned in disgust.
"Come with me," Harry purred in his ear. He grabbed Seamus's hand and pulled him down the garden to the back of the marquee.
"Couldn't get back to sleep?" Harry asked her, sitting down on the bench and pulling the tray of toast towards him.
The question stung, he couldn't lie to Harry because it wouldn't be true if he said no. He stepped forward and moved his hands in front trying to feel for the cloak. "Where are you? I feel like a mad person talking to thin air."
"I'm 25 I don't need to get my parents permission," Draco sighed, annoyed that Blaise always thought he should seek out advice from his parents.
"She's a Muggle-born?" Harry asked, looking at Draco when he asked to see his reaction, but Draco wasn't shocked or displeased, he didn't care if people were Muggle-borns or pure blood anymore, he had a lot of time to reflect since the war and realised there was more to life than worrying about who came from what family.
Blaise and Ginny shared secret smiles. "I think you should, Blaise has set Draco up on a date and he was giving it a go, you never know you both might find soul mates."
Draco laughed. "Well, get used to it," He replied, then blushed when he realised what he said. "I mean, shut up, Potter."
"Take it easy," Harry said calmly. "You are hurting; I understand that you can't take it out on other people she wouldn't want that."
"I'm sorry," Hermione began. "I forgot you hadn't any idea who Rose and Hugo were, they were just so excited to see you, and it had completely slipped our minds."
Too far gone, Harry obediently played with the hard nub of flesh, tweaking and twisting it between slender fingers, his eyes closed in pleasure.
"Not so good at the moment I am afraid, the Goblins are getting irritable with wizards that are bringing in Goblin made items for their own vaults, there will be a war over it soon I reckon," Blaise said enthusiastically.
Everyone stood up and mounted their brooms and flew into the air Harry hovered near to where Draco was, He was wearing a navy blue shirt and tie with a black waistcoat covered by black robes, and to Harry's surprise, he was wearing glasses. He was unaware Harry had been staring at him as he had his head down and was fiercely writing. The corners of Harry's mouth turned up as he watched him and then looked away as he remembered he had the practice to concentrate on.
Harry turned to look at the old witch who was beaming at him like so many witches did when they were in his company, even though she has known him since his first trip into Diagon Alley. "Erm, yeah, I guess it won't hurt to try it on," He said unsurely.
He looked at himself in the mirror and was happier in the suit than he expected to be, it wasn't half bad it actually suited him, he had to admit Malfoy looked a lot better in it than he did but, Malfoy looked good in any suit, he thought frowning slightly.
"There has been a lot of talk about me in the prophet and gossip magazines that have been speculating about my friendship with Harry Potter, and I haven't been honest with you all. I will be giving an exclusive interview with Witch Insider later today to tell the whole truth." Draco felt Harry's eyes boring into the back of his head; he hadn't had a chance to tell him about the interview he was going to be having with Pansy. "And regarding the impulsive purchase of the cafe, I can assure I won't be getting bored in two weeks. I intend to run a smooth operation and give Diagon Alley a safe and comfortable place to eat and drink twenty-four seven except for Christmas where I will most definitely be closing so my staff and I can spend time with our families."
The cars began to slow down and come to a stop near where they started from. They got out and left the bumper cars arena.
Draco landed down outside Harry's door, extremely tired and sweaty, he hadn't done that big of a distance that quickly in a while. Harry was nowhere to be seen, which was good because that meant he had won, but he was worried that he had gotten lost on the way back.
Harry wasn't in the kitchen or sitting room when he walked through the house. He couldn't possibly still be asleep; he thought as he stalked up the stairs of the cottage almost knocking a picture frame off the wall. He straightened the picture of Harry, and the small boy who he assumed was Teddy. Draco had only met Teddy once when he was about two years old; he had gone to his Aunt Andromeda's home to return things from Bellatrix's vault that she had claimed as her own. It was part of his redemption tour that he forced his parents into.
"Sometimes," he paused. "I just wish he would finally accept me, and not use me being gay against me."
"Out of control?" Draco stepped forward. "It's literally me and Harry walking out of a bank together; we have been working together all week I hardly see how this is going to affect you three."
He eased himself onto Draco's lap, so he was straddling him, his arms around his neck, moving in until he was up close and personal, heat bleeding through the thin material of his shirt, making his mouth go dry, getting him hard and making his hips nudge up against his without thought. He only wanted to be closer, only wanted more of him. Harry smiled at the feel of him; his pupils were wide and rich. He kissed him, teasing him with light touches when Draco was straining for more, the ropes, hitting dully against the wood behind him.
"Be quiet Arthur, tell me what is going on with you both," Mrs Weasley demanded. "Don't think I haven't noticed something going on."
They all sat around the table eating their plates of spaghetti Bolognese, Harry and Ron were both drinking firewhisky, but Hermione had neglected the glass Harry had poured her and was just sipping on pumpkin juice.
Draco cleared his throat. "Special announcement today as Harry Potter, 34 and Ex-Death Eater, Draco Malfoy, 37 are celebrating their 15th anniversary, on behalf of the daily prophet we wish them both well and congratulations." He slammed the paper down and glared at Harry; he looked clueless as usual.
Draco looked up with one cocked eyebrow."Quite easily, you just brown off the mince in a frying pan..."
The daylight outside the kitchen window glared through, stunning him as he walked over the kitchen threshold. He hurried to the window and pulled the curtains closed, his eyes adjusted to the darkness and felt at ease.
"Yes, typical Lucius, all talk, no action," She sighed, and if Draco didn't know any better, he would have thought there was a double meaning to that statement; He cringed at the slip of the idea of it.
"I am an acquaintance of the person who sent it, and he was stupid enough to send them to me before submitting them to The Prophet, we got the actual copy off him first thing this morning and memory of the picture even existing erased."
“You can either report to me or if you prefer to speak to your own Head of House, I am sure they will be happy to continue to do so.”
"Because Potter. You are watching one of the most important games of the season, and I can see you thinking about work."
"Ron was just telling me what happened at work today, I can't believe it, I mean I can but, I didn't realise there was all that other stuff."
Draco cupped Harry's face with his free hand. "You think we are not going to see each other again if it gets leaked?" He asked still frowning. "You really think that, don't you?"
"Alright, then I am good at guessing," Draco admitted rubbing his hands together relaxing to the boy.
"No, wait, it was an accident, he said the wrong spell, we were trying to get Theodore back to the Ministry, but he messed up."
"You're the fourth lot of Eighth years that have asked for Firewhisky today," Tom said conspiratorially.
"I had suspected, it was only when I saw the photographs a couple of weeks ago that it was confirmed, that's why I tried to pay off the Daily Prophet and agreed to do this whole Ball," Lucius said greyly.
“We would have gotten to that if you hadn’t stopped,” Draco said with more of a snarl than he probably meant.
His eyes widened when he held a stack of business cards in his hand, Draco Malfoy Event Planner: Perfect for all occasions. "You really get me, don't you?" He said smiling.
The Great Hall went completely silent as the doors opened, and Professor Flitwick walked in, followed by the new first years. Usually, it was Professor McGonagall that would be doing the sorting ceremony, but Harry presumed that must mean Professor Flitwick was the new Deputy Head Teacher, which made sense he supposed.
The door jingled open again, and Draco heard Rose greet Ron Weasley, Harry had noticed too. "You can hide if you want I won't mind," Draco whispered even though he knew it would hurt.
The old witch looked taken aback by his reaction to her entering the room. "Excuse me?" She gasped, holding her hand to her chest.
The boy shook his head again and looked at him confused. "What is a festarial?" He asked not be being able to say it correctly.
When he got back downstairs, Teddy was being cuddled by Narcissa. She looked young and beautiful when she was smiling. It was a stark difference from the past few times he had seen her, both when she was on trial, and before that, when she was comforting Malfoy in the great hall after the war had finished.
"Ah hello, Roody, looking well," Slughorn smiled at Ron. "Don't sit down just yet, if you can all stand at the back of the class."
The room cheered as Harry walked with suspicion up the stairs and onto the stage. Draco's heart was beating harder than ever. "Keep it together, idiot," He said to himself.
After an hour of Cotton and Malfoy deliberating with each other they had returned to the benches where the remaining people were sat. Draco had his arms folded again and was smirking again at them all. Cotton's face was in a hard line as he held the clipboard against his chest.
Harry paused and thought before he lifted his wand back up to Draco. "How do I know who you say you are?"
“No, you didn’t; I told you, it’s a fix.” Harry reminded him. “What do you want?” He asked when they stood in front of the burger van.
"How did you stay so close to Ginny and Blaise after she cheated on you?" Draco whispered so quietly Harry had only just worked out what he said.
Harry moaned, arching his body to the skilful touch. His head fell back in pleasure as he tugged Draco’s head forward, directing him to his other nipple. Draco resisted his urging. Instead, he placed a series of nipping kisses along Harry’s collarbone, nuzzling and licking his way up the ivory column of his neck.
Before Mrs Weasley had finished her sentence, the three of them had taken off and were heading to the Apothecary.
"Hello, Harry," A husky voice spooked him from behind, he turned around and saw the ex Gryffindor beater Jimmy Peakes. "Are you trying out too?"
Draco gulps down his fire whiskey. This was a horrible idea. Why did he let Pansy convince him to come to this interhouse gathering?
