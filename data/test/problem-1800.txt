I was faintly conscious of sweat beginning to trickle down my back. My own exertion was taking a toll. I could try to redirect his attention instead of fighting it, but I had no idea of the full extent of his abilities. It was always a risk; if I made a single misstep, my mind would be wide open for him to explore at will.
Chuckling, Shacklebolt turned back to his console. “You know better than me. But be careful. Now that I’m aware of this, I share your feeling that there is much more to this than meets the eye.”
“It’s me, Malfoy,” I said. “Just came to check up on you. I brought some tea.” I hesitated and pushed opened the door.
“Oh?” Now there was definitely a note of interest in Malfoy’s voice. He leaned in, almost stepping into the holographic display floating above the geometric tiles. “Now you’re talking. You said this was found on an Unspeakable?”
She narrowed her eyes, looking for an instant very different from her typical dream-like state. “I suppose I’ll take that. But what’s this research question you have? I wasn’t aware appraisers at auction houses needed to publish like those in academia.”
“Mr. Malfoy. Forgive us for coming at such an inopportune time, but we have important matters to discuss with you. My name is Shacklebolt and this is my colleague Dawlish.”
“It was the first place that ever felt like home to me,” Harry admitted. “I … didn’t get alone with my guardians, and I dreaded the end of every term, where I had to return to their house. That was never home to me. Of course, later I went to stay with the Weasleys at the Burrow or Grimmauld Place. But even then, Hogwarts was always my first home.”
“Yes,” Harry said, startled by the intensity in Shacklebolt’s eyes. He wondered if despite Hedwig’s precautions, she had still somehow let slip Harry’s momentary attraction.
“Kreacher, get some tea. I’ll take Malfoy to the guest room.”
Harry sucked in his breath.
“Draco?” Harry asked hesitantly. “Are you alright?”
“We’ll go in through the back,” Harry said, after speaking to someone on the phone. “Shacklebolt have someone hack into the security so that our entry won’t be noticed.” He looked at Draco. “Are you sure you want to be here? It’s against all regulations, and not only that, this is very dangerous.”
I needed to unravel its secrets and find the location of Slytherin’s Grimoire. Luna’s tale of the secret society took on new meaning: t was no longer an incredible story with elements lifted from the last few years. If the other part of her story was accurate, then the others who were after the Grimoire would not be interested in using it to cure Dragonpox.
Harry shifted closer to me. “Sit a little closer,” he said, his voice switching to a huskier tone.
“He’ll probably hand it over to Riddle at the earliest opportunity,” Shacklebolt said. “It’s likely they’ll come after Draco again too. Here’s what we need to do: I’ll have the analysts track down Dolohov and Riddle’s whereabouts. In the meantime, Harry, stay close to Draco and protect him.”
“I was busy loading yours into the car! Who brings five trunks of clothes for a weekend trip, anyways?”
“And now you say he is proving to be an obstacle.” Riddle’s eyes glittered.
“Wait.” Draco didn’t have gloves or anything that would prevent his fingers from leaving oils that might damage the metal. He wrapped one hand around the flapping fabric of his shirt, and picked it up.
Once again, an uncomfortable premonition nagged at him. The man on the card appeared to be sneaking away from the scene of the crime, like he had stolen those swords. A group of little figures on the left caught Draco’s attention. They were ready for a chase.
Harry managed to return to Grimmauld Place without any further interruptions. It was an older flat, in a less than reputable part of London, but at least it was in the City and comfortable enough for a single man.
Then, after what seemed like an eternity, Potter’s eyes focused. “First ... time ... you used my name.”
I raised my wand, strengthening the charm to provide stronger lighting. I was looking at a broadsword, a claymore to be precise, a two-handed sword favored by the Scots. The hilt was silver, with an onyx set in the pommel, and tiny script inlaid in filigree at the guard. I could not decipher what it said; it was too small and the room too dark. Maybe it was some form of Goblin, though it was none that I recognized. But even lacking that information, I knew that the sword had power.
Draco didn’t believe the first words that slipped out of his tongue were those. Harry blushed and Finnegan looked as if he might burst out laughing.
“Correct.”
“I think I figured out,” Draco said. “What configuration to reset the Decoder at least.”
I wanted to shut my eyes. My head throbbed. I was exhausted. All I longed for was to lie down, to not think, and let sleep take me where it may.
Riddle turned his attention back to the table. Even the most well-grown plants needed some pruning.
“I don’t need anything from that’ll require him to go into hiding or disband his business,” Draco said.  That was also slightly bending the truth: if Draco and Harry failed, it was more likely that Riddle would come after all those who had helped them with a vengeance. “Just some names and an address. It’s much easier work than fencing great big lumps of marbles.”
“And what about you making those ridiculous songs about me and that badge?” Potter attempted to move on from the touchier subjects. “Admit it, you were just as obsessed with me.”
Fletcher snorted. “No. Neither. They’re too easy to track. Cash or nothing.” He gave them a shifty look. “I was cooperative, and you did promise me my fee.”
“That’s too much of a coincidence,” Harry said. Definitely too much of a coincidence. “Is there anything else linking them? Aside from the facts that we just discussed.”
Potter’s business card burned in my pocket. I had turned it over so many times. Black, embossed simply with his name and address. My heart raced, a behavior that I knew did not result from seeing my flat destroyed. I did not want to run to him for help. I had my pride, and somewhere within me, fear pulsed that he might reject me. Though I knew it was unlikely, given Potter’s penchant to play the hero. But humbling myself before someone I had attempted to humble for so long? It left a bitter aftertaste.
Harry scowled. “Nothing gets past you, sir.”
I sighed. I knew how this looked. And as they advanced on me, I knew today was going to be a long day.
“You didn’t have to come along, you know,” Harry said. He was unperturbed by the environment and would not have been out of place as a wax statute at Madame Tussauds’. Only the humorous curve of his mouth betrayed him. “You insisted on coming, remember?”
It was electric. My toes curled at its heatedness as Potter deepened the contact, coming down to sit on my thighs, almost resting on my lap.
“Thank you,” I said. It was a cold reminder that Potter was here, not for a social call, but because my life was at risk. “Someone tried to break into my mind today. There’s definitely a group after the Grimoire. All these attempts targeted at me, they probably came from this group.”
This was even more intimate than their kiss earlier; Draco took in the faint stubble that traced the sharp edges of Harry’s jaw, and the green eyes that flickered. Draco wanted to kiss Harry again, press his mouth, consequences be damned. It was sweet agony to exercise so much self-control.
I took a deep breath and steeled myself as I touched the surface of the Pensieve. It rippled, and suddenly I was falling, falling –
Harry nodded. “I think it’s still safe for you to go out, but you should minimize your exposure. And be careful with your calls. Did you use the burner phone I gave you?”
“They were my parents, Draco,” Harry said with a touch of amusement. “I think I know if taking you to see them is appropriate or not.”
With that in mind, Draco closed his eyes.
The bed creaked. Harry sat next to Draco, not quite touching. They were close; Draco heard Harry’s shallow breaths in the dark.
Draco held his breath. It was Bellatrix.
I tried hard not to take the bait. “This is serious, father, or we wouldn’t be involving you. It’s important. Lives are at stake.” Like mine.
“I am,” Draco said. He smiled genially. “I think you know enough about my background to know I have an abiding love for all antiquities and that I also have the means to meet any price.”
I felt like I had been here before ... there was a familiarity that eluded me, a misplaced piece of a puzzle that I had owned for a long time. The cave, its walls slightly glinting with wetness … the book, ancient and yet somehow timeless … I closed my eyes –
Harry directed a level gaze at Draco. “For work. Kingsley comes here often. It’s close enough to walk and it isn’t somewhere that stands out. Not a very see-and-be-seen place.”
Harry was left weak and bedridden by the curse, but he was slated to make a full recovery in a couple of days, I was told. In the meanwhile, he was irascible, testing even Granger’s patience.
Draco made his way instinctively to them. He reached out his hand to touch.
“Sorry,” I said. “Getting you injured.” The memory of that moment came again, the unexpectedness way the flash had erupted, while I was frozen in shock and confusion as he shoved me out of the way. “Sorry, Potter.”
They must really hold my intellectual ability in high esteem, I thought with grim amusement as I put the book into my safe. The lock clicked as the anti-theft and Disillusionment charm activated. I debated whether to store it in my Gringotts vault, but it was an additional hassle when I still needed to examine it.
Harry showed Draco to where he’d be sleeping. It smelled of mothballs, with a tattered four-post bed with faded velvet curtains. It was something that belonged in a museum, not in a bedroom.
“In any case,” Shacklebolt interrupted, “I think it is time to recall both of them home. Now that the Shield is gone, we need you back in England. Draco, we’ve finished transcribing and organizing your father’s papers. We have our analysts cross-referencing them with his past communications in our database. So far, nothing’s turned up.”
Blood magic – it was outdated and such a cliché, but its power was undeniable. Even as my strength ebbed away, the connection with Harry that my spell had forged took my breath away with its power.
Even after five years, Harry still had that power to affect him.
It must have been a trick of the light, but I thought I saw a blush creep across his face. Whatever it was, he recovered quickly, gesturing at himself. “I didn’t know it was so formal. I mean, it is business, but it’s also with your parents.”
“At least it’ll be easier to take with us,” Bellatrix said. Her voice was musing, like stating a fact.
“You might be trying to trick someone or doing something you shouldn’t be. Or, you could be the victim of someone else. It also means that you need to be strategic going forward. You can’t have it all, not matter how much you try. You need to put yourself first in order to overcome what obstacles you face.” She raised her head to Draco, examining him. “You don’t seem very fond of this card, which is understandable. But do you have any reasons for doubting or rejecting it?”
“You were never a Dark wizard,” Potter said, almost gently. “Everything you did – yes, you hurt people, and it was foolish and misguided, but you aren’t a Dark Wizard.”
Potter snorted. “It’ll take more than a sneak attack to do me in,” he said loudly.
Moral fiber indeed.
“What’s going to happen to them?”
“No,” Shacklebolt said. “Riddle might have an even better picture of your real estate holdings than us, and we know all about your properties in the UK.”
Harry supposed it made sense, given the identity of its owner. Unspeakables were human too; they might occasionally want to work from home.
“Roughly a dozen. No more than fifteen in my line of sight,” reported Harry, doing the same. “We should secure the back too. They won’t be so stupid to forget that.”
The black hit the shields with great force, the black blaze flaring as it fought to overpower our defenses.
“Come in!”
“These recently arrived Bactrian artifacts: where are they coming from? Who is selling them?”
“You are?” Draco had assumed Harry would stay in his flat and occasionally come over to check in on Draco. “You don’t need to do that. I can take care of myself.”
He examined his reflection in the shower door. A face that was a bit on the thin side; a body that was a bit on the thin side, though lean from the mandatory physical training all Aurors did to maintain their effectiveness in the field and aided by the bio-mechanical prosthetics in his body.
Harry forced himself not to roll his eyes. The prospect of some rest tonight was fading ever dimmer, and Harry’s jacket smelled too strongly of singed fabric for him to relax.
He buried himself in the search. Just as he was about to give up, his hand touched something cold.
“So,” Harry said, now that the uncomfortable part of the conversation was finished, “can I have your permission for the SI to give me the list?”
“Why do you care?” Draco said bitterly. It appalled Draco how easily his cultivated mask of indifference crumpled. “Besides, how do you know I’m not changing my mind about my cooperation this very moment?”
Which was why Draco found himself in the waiting area of the Leaky Cauldron, tapping his foot impatiently for his contact to arrive. It was a sleek, aggressively modern gastropub, whose owner had thought hanging bronze pots over the hostess’ desk was the height of aesthetic creativity. Personally, Draco thought it was a hazard and a lawsuit waiting to happen.
“No.” In truth, I probably wouldn’t have asked her if I had not drunk so much. My headache was gone, replaced by a spinning weightlessness that I knew meant I would fall down all the harder tomorrow. But for right now, nothing seemed to matter. “It’s not terminal, is it? Or contagious?”
“And in that time, I think we spent most of it hating each other and fighting each other.”
“Hell?” Fudge waved a hand. “Harry, are you alright?”
Potter grabbed it as he released the hex preventing me from moving. There was an acrid smell of smoke behind me with the overpowering heat of fire consuming wood and books and velvet.
“You should get dressed,” Malfoy said, his eyes averted. “Unless you would like to be the one on show, that is.”
Cross chuckled. His expression was genial as ever. “Dear Draco, don’t you think I would have expected that from you? Of course I would take precautions.”
I let my hands walk free under his shirt. Touching him was nicotine … the firm muscles beneath his skin, the flex and arch of his back as he handled me, his weight on me as we moved to the bed.
Fletcher nodded slowly, a pleased expression creeping across his face. “Very good point. Is that why you’ve decided to, how should I put this, traffic with the likes of me?”
“I thought your parents died in a car accident,” Draco said in a small voice.
Malfoy had an amused expression on his face. “Anything to be of service to the Aurors.” He remained sitting, his gaze on Harry. “Since you’re here, why don’t you stay and have a drink? On the house.”
They left me with Potter. He examined me carefully. “How’re you feeling?”
“What? Yes, I do, and what’s happening? That’s not paint – what have you gotten yourself into?”
Even the crowded skyline of London was more open than the Gringotts Reading Room. It was slightly claustrophobic, despite the high vaulted ceiling, made worse by the hostile stares of the other patrons. I looked glumly at the piles of papers and books I spread out before me. My instinct had brought me here, but where to start? I had no idea why I even brought the book. I had no intention of having a vision in the midst of a hostile environment, and the environment here was hostile indeed.
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “He is. He is also someone who might know something that can be useful to us.”
And it had not been a continental peck or the playful one friends sometimes gave each other. This was one with passion, the type lovers would give to each other.
I jumped up, a roar in my ears, the thudding in my heart vibrating through my entire body. My father – so proud, so strong in my childhood. And even after, he was an ever-present constant in my life – lying on the floor.
“This isn’t natural,” Malfoy said. “Nor did I decide to get a tattoo out of a whim. This was what happened to me that night, this reminder of something that I don’t remember.”
I carefully unstopped it, watching it pour into the Pensieve with one fluid motion. It was a strangely hypnotic sight, the Pensieve growing brighter as the dark liquid spread out in a swirl, slowly filling up the surface of the bowl.
I started at him, keeping my face still. He knew more about this book than he pretended. I had to draw him out.
My head hurt from the speculation. Abruptly, I shoved the Grimoire into Harry’s hands.
“Oh. Sorry, I forgot.” Blaise had usually been the one to cast the charm when we were together, since I usually slept over at his place. I counted with one hand the number of times he came over to mine. Well, now it would be two hands. “It’s been a while.”
The halls of Malfoy Manor equaled the mausoleum in its lack of warmth. Portraits of Draco’s antecedents stared down disapprovingly in their gilt frames as Draco’s footfalls echoed. The peeling wallpapers rustled slightly in his wake. It was musty and smelled of dust; Draco had dismissed most of the staff after he had taken possession. It didn’t matter much; Draco spent most of the time in London anyways, only returning at irregular intervals to the country.
A sheet of paper drifted to the floor, shaken out by Draco’s movements.
Potter laughed. “You did well when you were actually attacked. Take it seriously.”
Then again, I might have accidentally stuck it in while I was distracted. I had a hell of a morning – alarm not ringing, coffee machine broken (I preferred the bitter tang of coffee to tea’s washed-out astringency), misplacing half the papers I needed. On other days, it would have annoyed me, satisfying the cliché of an absentminded academic, but I was too harried to care today.
Draco sighed. “I’ll throw in these too.” He took off his watch.
“The Seven of Swords,” Rosa said. It seemed ridiculous to keep calling her Madam Rosa, at least in Draco’s mind. “It signifies betrayal and deception. The sword is the suite of air, change, and intellect. Its meanings are usually double-edged, just as air can either be a zephyr or a gale.”
Harry stiffened. He thought he was being careful, and that his act was passable enough not to draw attention.
“Really, Potter, stop trying to show me up. But yes, you’re right. But the strange thing about this sword is that only the hilt appears to be goblin-silver; the rest is some other kind of metal. Look –”
Draco wanted to punch something. They had almost succeeded. Damn! So close. He literally had the Decoder in his hands, only for the vultures to swoop in at the last minute.
“None at all?” Malfoy asked.
“Here.” Harry turned on the flashlight. The glare jarred his eyes. “Is that what we’re looking for?”
Draco was still disoriented from the seven-hour flight. The blast of climate control added to Draco’s headache after being outside on the arid landing field.
Riddle’s eyes flared with excitement as he shone the light upon the Decoder. It lit up, reflecting it back, looking like the miniature imitation of the Millennium Eye with its wheels spinning, catching the gleam.
“Still ….” Potter frowned. “Should I change? I don’t want to look out of place.”
Once more, the basement filled with light. Unlike before, it was of a softer cast, and yet no less weak for it. It touched every corner of the room; it was eerier, somehow, than the one created by the curse.
Wormtail complied, his awkward shuffle conveying sulkiness. He dropped them on the table next to Draco without meeting Draco’s eyes.
“And no, I’m not going to tell you why he left,” Granger added sternly, clearly anticipating I was going to ask that next. “That’s his business to share. He’ll tell you if he’s willing.”
“It’s one of your many tidbits of wisdoms that I’ve imbibed in our acquaintance,” Harry said, chuckling. “But I’m game. Let me just finish signing this.” He reached over for his pen, which incidentally laid beyond where Draco was sitting on the desk.
He touched my face. His fingers were soft and supple. “Why didn’t we ever get together?”
“Your skepticism and how you’ve been taking in every detail since you entered the room,” Madam Rosa said with a gentle smile. “But perhaps we should introduce ourselves first. I’m Madam Rosa, as you probably already know.”
I stood to leave. I had no intention of sticking myself in a bureaucratic morass. No doubt they would hand me a book’s worth of paperwork before I even saw an actual officer. I shuddered. I had enough of administrivia in my own work – there was still a pile of unfilled expense forms I needed to complete and return to the office.
“It’s probably protected against it,” I pointed out, restraining the urge to roll my eyes at his stupidity. “I doubt Slytherin would be so stupid not to think of that.”
And stared into the face of Hermione Granger.
“I can trace this to an account in Gringotts Bank,” the tinny voice from Malfoy’s wand said. “And after that, there appears to be a thicket of shell entities that seem to lead to nowhere.”
Riddle shook his head. “There are no backup. Besides, even if they are, they wouldn’t come in without your signal. And you won’t be able to send that in any case.” He smiled, prominent teeth against thin lips.
“Why?” Through the corner of my eyes, I saw a smile threatening to break out at the corner of Potter’s mouth. “Getting you a little bothered?”
Something thumped in my chest at his words. Harry … choose me over arcane knowledge and power? It seemed a poor choice to me.
Draco kicked at the pebbled path. Truth be told, that card, the Seven of Swords, had rocked him. Draco wasn’t sure why, but Rosa’s talk about betrayal and deception and cunning made his blood run cold.
Harry laughed. “Very well put, Professor.”
“The meal has barely started, Mr. Fletcher. Why don’t we save the business talk for later? Or at least, after the appetizer.”
“Are you alright, Draco?” Granger asked. “You’ve suffered two Legilimens attack in one day. You should be resting.”
My father did not seem to like my mother’s suggestion. He glowered at Potter, but wisely did not say anything, lest my he brought my mother’s wrath upon himself.
“If you tell me those plans are world domination, I will laugh in your face,” Draco said. “Nothing sounds stupider or more cliche than when a villain wants to take over the world.”
Perhaps I should have chosen a humbler location, I thought wryly as I greeted the doorman cordially and took the lift up. But unlike some of my colleagues, I didn’t particularly care for scholarly squalor.
Another benefit of these brooms was that they were not chipped to the traffic grid, which could cut in and break a car that it found flouting its rules.
And then there was the gun.
I was still last evening’s robes, having fallen asleep in them. They smelled rank. I wrinkled my nose. It was more than just my robes; I smelled rank.
Their car matches the description provided by our research and I have matched it to the database, Hedwig reported, as though anticipating Harry’s doubts. The owner is one Mundungus Fletcher, having been arrested multiple times on petty crimes
Hedwig? Hedwig?
“My mother – my father – they’re still in there –”
Goyle and I had always gotten along, even if I did behave like a little snot with him. But that year ... with everything my family suffered, the terror on us a shadow that no light would banish, we couldn’t act like nothing was happening. And after the War ... not only him, but all my friends and family, they questioned why I had turned away from all our mutual upbringing and our heritage. They didn’t seem to understand it was that toxic heritage which brought the War in the first place.
“I need to go down and see Hermione and Ron,” Harry said.
“No, I suppose you’re not.” Draco swore he saw a half-smile on Harry’s face.
It was just as well; Draco didn’t know if he could stomach the idea of having his hopes raised and rejected over unpalatable food. They had kept their conversation light, confined to the oh-so-British topic of the weather, though learning about how the spring was like in Afghanistan was infinitely more interesting than discussing whether it would rain back in Wiltshire.
Despite his appearance, however, Fletcher displayed the suavity and bonhomie of a socialite.
“Don’t,” Potter warned. “They’re violently possessive over every object they’ve ever made.”
It caught the attention of a wolfish-looking man. He licked his lips and leered at Draco.
Potter flushed and I wanted to kick myself. I could have worded that rather more delicately.
The sky was clear and the moon hung brilliant, casting the entire base in a pale light. The dust that covered everything added a slight glimmer under its soft glow, and a slight breeze stirred occasionally, picking up the sand.
Harry grimaced. Shacklebolt won’t be pleased to be dealing with this, especially in the middle of the night. Though Shacklebolt’s bio-enhancements had all but eliminated the need for him to sleep, pumping in steroids and stimulating the nervous system to keep the exhaustion at bay, Harry knew from personal experience that the human body could only withstand so much before it broke down from the artificial treatment. Not for the first time, Harry thought it was perhaps foolhardy to tinker with what nature had already provided.
“I’m jetlagged.” And Harry did look exhausted. Dark circles ringed his eyes.
I drained the rest of my glass and motioned for a house-elf to refill it.
I let out my breath. Evidently, I was not meant to have a quiet morning. “About last night.”
Potter looked dubiously at me. I stretched my face in my best smile. Somehow, it did not feel quite up to standard. I wanted him to go, not least so he could bring back news. His hovering was touching, but unwelcome. I could take care of myself. After all, that was what I insisted to my parents every time they pushed me to move back to the Manor.
“That’s not our jurisdiction,” Harry snapped. “Aurors don’t handle matters like those, and even if we did, there is a reason why we can’t –”
Harry emitted a guttural sound. “Yes, like that – harder.”
It was also gothic in its eeriness. Part of that could be attributed the heavy curtains Lucius had favored, and that Draco hadn’t bothered to change. The décor certainly were in want of an update, but even when Draco slept in his own rooms, he woke up in a cold sweat from a subtle rattling.
Draco slanted a glare at Harry. “You know I had to teach those snotty undergraduates as part of my graduate studies. Don’t mock.”
“No.” They weren’t. Even back when they had been dating, they had never been the type of couple to fill the space with empty chatter. Draco tried again. “I miss this. Us.”
“Us. How I wasted my time here disliking you when I could have gotten to know you better.”
Potter shook his head. “I’m alright. I’ll let you rest.” Then, quick as a flash, he kissed me on the cheek.
My mother smiled serenely. “You said as much in your letter, Draco.” She gestured for the house-elves to bring out the next course. My plate was taken away, replaced by another of roasted halibut. “I do hope this time you’ll stay longer. I never see you anymore.” She gave a long-suffering sigh as if I had not just called a week ago. Even if it had been to borrow a house-elf for food.
Hermione smiled. She didn’t look that much different from the one in Harry’s memory. There was still the same bushy-haired, bright-eyed girl in her, though her intelligence was more apparent than before, piercing through in the appraisal she gave both Harry and Malfoy.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Draco, I care more that you’re not hurt over if you had acted by the book,” Granger interrupted. “I trust your story. You’re a magical history, not a thug.”
“What’s wrong? What happened? Is Harry alright? Oh --” Granger rushed into the room.
“Don’t worry about that,” Draco said. “I –”
“Neither of us are affiliated with the Ministry, Mr. Malfoy, but that doesn’t mean our business is any less important,” Potter said.
“Yes.” Harry seemed surprised. “Did Draco tell you?”
Yet his heart knew not what his head did.
Potter laughed. “I’ll have Kreacher bring you some of my old ones.” He looked at me appraisingly, his gaze lingering. I blushed at the intensity. Stop, I told myself.
“Thank you,” Harry said curtly. “I’ll keep looking into this for now, until I’m ordered to stop. Do you have a physical address for any of these shell companies?”
“Oh, I put the key in your bag,” Cross said. “You really should think twice before leaving it unattended. He objected to the plan, but I suppose he got his comeuppance. Stupid fool, getting caught by the Ministry.”
She climbed on with a swift jump. Draco, his arms raised to show that he meant no threat, nudged the Decoder, still resting on its towel, over to her.
It was an awful thought and stirred in Harry pity. Malfoy, now that Harry looked closer, did display signs of illness which elegant clothes and a cool demeanor had previously covered. “Your own father … he made you go through that operation as a child to plant those biomechanical enhancements?”
I shrugged. It seemed to have fallen by the wayside now; next to the events today, writing an academic article with properly supported thesis and citations seemed staid and dry.
“No, you’re not listening. I said the Ministry databases don’t have the information. I didn’t say I didn’t find the information.”
“That’s an understatement,” Granger said. “We haven’t fully plumbed the extent of their activities, but they’re very dangerous.” She looked like she was choosing her next words carefully. “And it’s appearing that they have links to old pureblood supremacy groups.”
A small gasp of air escaped from Potter’s mouth, then a louder cough. He jerked up with great hacking chokes. He looked at me through wide, unseeing eyes as he fought to breath.
Potter chuckled softly. “Post drinks hunger? I ate, but I’ll have some of whatever you decide to have.”
Draco leapt forward, seeing the Decoder sliding inexorably to the edge of the deck. There was a hail of gunfire that forced him to duck.
Then I knew what I needed to do. I slid my wand over the center of my palm; a deep cut appeared. I suppressed a wince at the pain. Already, blood welled up and flowed, uninhibited.
“Well, we’ll keep in touch,” Granger said as she stood up. “Ron and I need to get home. We’ll let you two rest.”
Not ever.
Cross’ expression remained pleasant. “Is that a refusal, then? Have you made up your mind?”
“You’re not hurt, are you, Minister?” With the exception of being bareheaded, Fudge had nary a scratch on him. Like he had was just attending the opera, in fact. Personally, Harry thought it would do some good for these politicians to see some real action and experience the implications of all their talk on being tough on crime.
The next few weeks saw me holed up in my flat. I brushed off several appointments with deans and editors with excuses of illness, and asked my mother to send food from the Manor instead of leaving.
“Dolohov said I was to leave the Malfoy untouched, but he said nothing about you, Potter,” Greyback said, advancing on Harry menacingly.
“Alright,” Draco said. Was he agreeing because, against all his better judgement, Draco wanted to unravel the mystery of his father’s death? And truth be told, Draco was becoming exhausted by the numbing idleness of his current life. “Do I need to do anything to prepare or bring anything?”
“It is.”
“Apparently the Department of Mysteries don’t share your concern,” Malfoy said dryly. “These chips link the SI directly to your biomechanical components to enhance reflexes and strength by releasing certain chemicals on command. They can also be used on drone bodies, to connect a simply constructed body for the SI to control.” He cocked his head. “If the Sentient Intelligence is advance enough, maybe even more than one.”
“I wasn’t aware that any charges had been filed or any crimes had been committed. Other than negligent behavior by a dead Ministry employee.”
“We’re not armed with the kind of firepower they have, sir,” the man who was in the Humvee said in a thick Irish accent. He was crouched, looking over the side. “We’re equipped for stealth; the other teams have the big guns.” He shot a look at Draco. “Finnegan here, sir. It was brave of you coming out here like that to warn us. You’re a civilian, is that right?”
“I’m sorry,” I said quietly. It felt like I was apologizing for more than my faux pas. I was apologizing more my past, for the actions of my family, for the damage of those I had once counted as friends and comrades ….
Potter nodded. “I think about it a lot. I still get angry the way Dumbledore had arranged things. The plan he had for me, the secrets he kept. Every step I took had been made for me already, without me even knowing about it. And then I thought about the context. Would I have made the same choices I did if Dumbledore just let me do what I wanted? Would I have been able to save all those lives? Would I have made the right decisions?”
I watched my father’s face for any signal. I noticed his hand went flat on the table, and he blinked before he looked straight at me.
“That …” Malfoy looked hesitant.
I had it opened to a random page. The words blurred, and I thought the paper shimmered. But that was impossible. More than likely it was my exhaustion — I had stayed up all night to finish my latest review for the Journal on the History of Countering the Dark Arts. It had been a doorstopper of an article, not to mention a week behind deadline.
“Draco!” Harry grabbed me, pulling me back. He severed the sleeve of my robe with a quick slash of his wand, tossing it back.
Harry could barely move a finger, let alone his body. Dancing white spots blinded his vision, and even the gloom became more pronounced. Harry took a deep breath, trying to relax and unclench his locked muscle. He was going to pass out – if it meant sweet release from this agony right now, then –
Harry reached for his wand as the man launched himself at Harry. Harry had just enough time to disable the man with an applied shock from his wand.
“Well, what does that mean?” Harry asked impatiently.
Blaise shrugged. “Who knows. I see it, though.” He inched closer; any more and he’d be on top of me. It was not an unpleasant idea: my fingers itched for contact. Blaise smelled intoxicating, with his mix of soft cologne underlined with a hint of beer.
He looked at Harry. Harry was relaxed, face ruddy from the wind. He showed no other signs of the climate affecting him. Draco guessed Harry was used to much more extreme conditions than this.
They made an odd pair, Draco in his Savile Row suit and Fletcher in an ill-fitted dinner jacket over a white t-shirt. It was hard to believe that the man next to him was the most notorious fence for antiquities and art in London.
He held up the Decoder in the air, the sketch in his other hand.
“There is another matter, my lord. Dolohov reports that the Malfoy boy was involved. He had been instrumental in the plan’s failure.”
“That’s unusual,” Finnegan said. “I understand not having clearance to a Department of Mysteries file, but to not be able to access information that should be available to us in any other typical investigation – that’s extremely odd.”
And there was the stain from my past. The Circle had enormous influence, in society, in government. Gaining their support would be an enormous step in washing it off.
“Only two hours,” Harry said. “I got tired of waiting and went to look around the village.”
“Oh, no, keep it. I have a ton of others. It’ll be my gift to Draco.” Are you sleeping with him? he mouthed at me. He hadn’t missed the fact that we emerged from my bedroom together.
All the same, stay well.
I went down to breakfast much refreshed and feeling not a little dirty after my wank. I had resolved not to be involved with him beyond what was necessary. And yet, here I was, having the best jerk of my life from imagining Potter and his cock.
It was indeed an honor, one that he undoubtedly will put to the best use.
The voice … that face. I recognized that familiar visage that had tormented me when I last touched the book-key.
“By force it is then.” The two walked over, intent on hauling Draco away.
“A preliminary analysis of this situation suggests to me that you are exceeding far beyond the call of duty in this matter, Commander Potter,” the computer said. “From past situations, Aurors have been called in to provide a discreet cover for what otherwise would be a scandal that could bring down the government. This does not involve further examination of the facts.” There was a pause, then the computer added, “Rather the reverse.”
Without missing a beat, Harry swung his rifle. It hit the man squarely in the jaw. There was a pop -- the whites of the man’s eyes flickered upwards for a second before the lids fluttered shut.
“Take cover while I shoot our way out.”
Hot air surrounded me as we fly, wind whipping past us.
Potter frowned in concern. “Are you alright? Did you make a report with the Aurors?”
“What the hell are you thinking?” Malfoy hissed as soon as Tom was out of earshot. “Why don’t you just go up on stage, strip naked, wave your wand, and scream ‘I’m an Auror’ at the top of your voice instead? I assume whatever idiot that brought you down here already told you how most people around these parts hate the Aurors and the Ministry.”
I chuckled. “When I was a grad student, I used to consume buckets. How’re you faring, by the way?”
I left without being excused. On my way, I flagged a house-elf with instructions to inform told Potter I was in the library if he wanted me.
I sighed. Potter had a knack for stating the obvious.  “Yes. Thank you, Potter. We didn’t work out. For … too many differences.”
Malfoy made a little noise. Then he broke into a reluctant smile. “Alright. It’s been two decades, and I might as well tell another living being. But Potter, it’s a gory tale and I hope you’re ready for it.”
“I dunno,” Draco said, sinking back into his seat. The hard wood poked against his back. “It’s like everything is going too well after all the trouble I’ve had to get to where I am, you know? And I can’t deny everything in my life is going well. My father doesn’t approve of my choice of careers. Or my boyfriend.”
They moved on to lighter fare, Draco’s mood improving when the food arrived. He savored the richness of the laksa broth, his worries evaporating as they continued to talk.
“No,” Riddle said. “You’re not. That’s why, ironically, I believe I could trust you. You’re not as mercenary as he is, and therefore, we have much greater leverage over you.”
She gave me a beady look. “Are you ever going to stop pestering me for information?”
My mother sharpened her eyes on me. It was much too knowing for my comfort. “What will you be doing today, Draco?” she asked.
It made sense. The Underground was the site of the former London transit system, overran by the homeless and impoverished of the city driven out of their homes. It had become an undercity within a city for those seeking shelter. It was a haven for criminals, where prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse was rampant. The Ministry tried occasionally to purge and relocate the residents, but it proved easier planned than actually executed, and so there existed only the semblance of order.
“If I weren’t the one stopping my friend here, you’d be dead,” Draco said lightly. It wasn’t true; Draco didn’t think Harry would kill an innocent more than he would sprout gills, but Fletcher wasn’t aware of that. Fletcher also wasn’t aware of Draco and Harry’s affiliations. “Think of that as a goodwill gesture. And I haven’t misrepresented my financial circumstances. I can meet your needs – if you prove cooperative.”
“You’re thinking about your father, aren’t you?” Harry asked, waving his wand. Instantly, the rocky roadstones flattened into to be more walkable. “What he said about you not fulfilling your family duties.”
Draco looked at Harry. Despite that single outburst, Harry had stayed quiet throughout the entire exchange. That wasn’t like him.
The familiar sight of the Manor’s library welcomed me as I stepped in. The tall shelfs and Jacobean décor greeted me as I took my seat. It smelled old: dust and must from untouched filled my nostrils, and I stifled my urge to sneeze. My mother was right; this room was rarely visited. Even the house-elves only occasionally came in, and then just to clean.
I wanted to roll my eyes. One tiny outburst while I was under immense pressure and I was forever the emotionally fragile one. “Yes,” I said with exaggerated patience. “It was just fun. Besides, you know I can’t keep up with your lifestyle of glamorous jet setting. What would people think when they see you dating a boring old historian?”
“You’ll be lucky if they don’t deport you straight away,” Harry said, easing slightly. “You did sneak out of camp without permission, stealing military property to do so.”
“Oh! I remember that incident you’re referring to,” Granger said. “It was in Norfolk, right? I didn’t know it was because the house itself got offended.”
“Friend ….” Malfoy echoed. His eyes were bright as they met Harry’s. “Well, ‘friend’, what are you going to do after I tell you? Run away? Let your Auror self take over? Try to save me? What happened in the past should stay in the past.”
“Did you contact them with news of my request?” Draco asked.
That was impressive. And given how expensive and painstakingly complex these systems were, it would make sense for Malfoy to be as wealthy as he appeared.
Harry laughed and raised the curtains for them to enter the caravan.
I breathed a sigh of relief as nothing happened. Yet even my body relaxed, I was disappointed by the lack of further action. It was … anticlimactic.
I walked along the hallways, feeling the cold seep of paranoia bleeding in. How many others were part of this secret society? What did they want with the Grimoire? What did they want with me? They seemed to think that I knew more than I did. Ironic, since this group, whatever it was, had a much deeper understanding of the background surrounding the Grimoire.
“You know, most people would have closed the case by now.” Shacklebolt gave Harry a searching look. “What is your interest in this?”
We fell together, my legs wrapping around his waist, fully clothed, as we lost ourselves to a flurry of kisses, our hands clutching at each other. I didn’t want to let go, even when we had to stumble up to avoid falling onto the floor.
One answer Draco did have now, however, was that he hadn’t lost his feelings for Harry. It had just been buried under all the resentment and unhappiness that followed. Draco had attempted to shovel those emotions away, but they were rooted too deep and were poking through the dirt again.
Harry sighed. Damn bureaucracy and their layers of paperwork. Pushing against that inertia was too much effort. Hedwig, use the Immobulus Protocol.
“They moved a few years ago,” Harry said, glancing back. He parked. The car gasped to a halt. “We need to move quickly. Just because I don’t see anyone following doesn’t mean they aren’t.”
The Malfoy boy had an affinity to the key. It was why he had dropped it into his bag, after all. It was to be expected; after all, it recognized his blood.
Draco sat on the bed in silence after Weasley left. The shirt was itchy against his skin. With the lights off, everything was magnified. Whatever painkiller they had shot him with worked, but it left Draco restless.
My charm missed by a wide mark, striking the grass uselessly. I winced, hurriedly casting a Protego that his retaliating spell met in a shower of sparks.
“What’s going to happen now?” he asked, once he finally regained his voice.
Sharp pain turned to pleasure as our bodies moved in tandem. I was awash in a sea of bliss, my world shrinking to the slap of his balls against my arse, the gasps we made, my nails scratching at his back.
Perhaps Harry provided the muscle for the operations. He certainly had them, Draco thought with a blush, remembering the breadth of those shoulders, the firm biceps that flexed under Draco’s hands as they pressed against each other –
Harry bowed his leave. As he turned, he swore he saw Malfoy give him a wink.
“I don’t have much memory of what happened, except blurry impressions of hooded men and scalpels and then this burning pain. And then, when I woke up the next day, I saw my mother and father hovering over me. I was in my bed, as though I had dreamt the whole thing.”
He looked at Harry. Yes, he included Harry in that category. He loved Harry.
“Why didn’t you contact me after?” Why Harry was bringing up all this again? Was it to punish Draco in some way, or to emphasize how untrustworthy and how untenable this deal with Riddle was? Draco knew all this.
They broke for a truce of breath.
They were on the hunt. Weeks of surveillance and operational planning for his team to finally have a single lead on the most notorious drug runners in London.
It was around midday by the time Draco finished reading through all the materials. His head buzzed; it was filled with memories, and not the ones he needed. Draco could not help but think about the arguments he and Lucius had had. There were also glimpses of the more tender man Lucius had been: Lucius had written of how much he missed his wife, how he wished his son would move back from London and how he kept Draco’s rooms ready in anticipation for every return.
“Wait ‘til you touch it and get a vision,” I said darkly. “You wouldn’t be saying that so chipper.”
“There might not be a choice. You were the one who pointed out how much of a disadvantage we’re in.”
“Well....” It was my turn to shift uncomfortably. “He was really never that fond of you, even when you were a child.”  That was the understatement of the decade.
I shoved him back. “Please. I would call for a rematch right now, but I don’t think your decrepit arse can handle it.”
“—makes it stronger,” Potter finished.
We engaged in a brief tussle, poking and tickling each other until we were both left breathless.
My father still labored under the illusion that I could be ‘fixed’ if I returned to the Manor and lived under his watchful eye. And a properly dull girl from a proper family that he would select for me.
“Right. A regular Holden Caulfield.”
We looked at each other in an uncomfortable silence. All thoughts at trying to extract gossip about Potter left my mind. This was why I vacillated in coming here – all these reminders of the past …. I had nowhere to escape. At least when I was with my books or my friends, I could forget, just for a while.
“Don’t.” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm. He tilted his chin at the corner of the display case. There was a small red light that pulsed, slow and steadily, its pace almost in tune to some mysterious beat. “And I’m going to bet my life savings that the glass is reinforced.”
Maybe Draco should just leave it at that. It didn’t do any good to raise the subject again, more the reverse. And he and Harry had been interacting like — well, Draco didn’t quite know how to term it, but it was a delicate balance that Draco didn’t know how to maneuver.
“Unless … its provenance is illegal?”
With a final malevolent glance at me, he left.
Draco had forgotten about that episode, overshadowed as it were by the resultant row between him and his father about Draco’s ‘unsuitable job and even more unsuitable lifestyle with that degenerate Potter’.
“Everything good?” Theo asked.
“Didn’t she predict your death?” I asked. “I mean … given the circumstances of your life, it was a relatively safe bet.” I paused. “Sorry. Didn’t mean to be cavalier about it.” He had saved my life too, when he had no need to.
“Look, I’m sorry.” Draco was mature enough to know it was his turn to be conciliatory. “I know you’re worried, but I can take care of myself. I promise. I’m not some helpless waif to be shepherded about.”
“You flatter me,” she said. Her voice was low, melodious, and tinged with the certainty of a fanatic. “I am only a messenger. It is my master that the credit to those works of art must be attributed.”
Cool air caressed my skin. Harry took advantage to touch every apart he could, as he kissed my hair, my mouth, my neck.
Harry slipped, quick as lightning, to the car. He had something in his hand. What it was Draco couldn’t see. It made little difference; Draco watched with trepidation in every breath as Harry moved like a shadow across the construction lot.
I followed his gaze. “They’re not so bad once you get used to them.” I looked around. Every part of this garden exuded serenity, grandeur; a tidiness that tried to evoke both timelessness and awe in the visitors. “When I was a child, I wanted to meet one.”
“Shh.” I was not sure if this was a memory that could interact with the living like the book-key. And in any case, I wanted to hear what they were saying.
They agreed that the best course of action was to search for the Shield. The impulse to run and the curiosity of actually laying eyes on the storied artifact warred in Draco.
Harry shook his head. “I wasn’t invited. I mean, I’m always welcome, but I think she wants to get to know you better. I can come if you like.”
The premise of this came from a random prompt on twitter, and the rest inspired because I was reading Deborah Harkness' A Discovery of Witches at the time. I left the ending relatively open because i feel there could be a lot more to be done with these characters. But I also like leaving things a little unsettled, so who knows?
“Ah, yes.” In the excitement of today, I had almost forgotten. “He’s supposed to come by sometime. I’ve changed the wards to allow him entry before I left this morning.” I had no idea why I did it; it seemed rather presumptuous of me, now that I thought about it.
Draco didn’t trust his intuition often: it was too messy, too imprecise, and it often confused more than clarified. But Draco knew – with certainty – that Harry needed his help. Not in a general sense, nor limited to what he was tasked to do here, but out there, at the exchange on the field.
“That’s ….” Harry didn’t know what to say. The possibilities were numerous, some horrifying. Harry wasn’t sure if it came from his natural ambivalence towards body modifications, but he couldn’t stop an instinctual revulsion at the idea.
The Circle member smiled at the Dark Lord, who raised his wand in anger. I prepared myself to see him writhe on the ground in pain, but nothing happened.
“Wait.” Harry stopped in his tracks. “So none of the alarms were triggered?”
“Long night?” My mother raised a delicate eyebrow. “Mr. Potter’s still asleep. I had a house-elf check on him.”
“What is our plan, sir?” Finnegan asked when Harry continued looking at Draco. “We’re not going to be able to fight out of this one.”
Hearing the truth of it stung. I sighed. “I’m sorry. It’s just – right now, it’s all a mess in my head. I’m not good at dealing with this.”
“But?” prompted Rosa.
Ensconced in a comfortable armchair and armed with a strong cup of coffee, Draco was ready to re-read his father’s papers.
“Suit yourself.” Harry settled back into his new self, the barely perceptible differences of the man he was now springing back into place. “It’s probably for the best. The coffee is awful.”
“Well, typically you use a counterspell or you overpower it with your own magic. Those are the two ways most wizards use.”
He missed this. The quieter moments, as though all of London was asleep except them, so that they could share this time and space between only themselves.
“The same goes for you, sir,” Finnegan said. “You don’t have to stay here, you know.”
“Commander, everything is negative on our side. They must be in your sector.”
“With what? A fork? You need to use shampoo and conditioner when you wash it too. Otherwise it’s going to stick out like that.”
The fear that gripped me, the panic that came over which had wiped all thoughts from my mind when I saw him down –it was fresh and even remembering sent me in a terrified rage. They had almost taken my family away; I would never allow them to take Harry, too. Even as I tried to convince myself that what we had was a casual fling, it was becoming much more than that.
“That doesn’t prove anything,” Malfoy said, gasping for air.
He watched a chicken run out of its coop. It was so carefree; all it wanted for was a handful of grains.
“I think she has charming manners,” my mother said mildly.
“The same might have happened to you! I couldn’t let that happen. I – I –” Draco glanced away. He waited for Harry’s recriminations, his rebuke.
Draco forgot his hand and trousers were still stained bloody.
It was useful in other ways, however, to have a gun in the shape of a rod. Made of light composite material, it was a weapon that had multiple settings, from stun to kill to incinerate.
He said the last few words with such hissed vehemence that the hairs on my arm rose, almost appearing to look straight at us as he uttered them.
“That’s not what I remember.”
“Ate earlier. And I never got the taste for black pudding either. The whole thing just puts me off.”
The librarian bowed –
“New intel from our satellites, sir. There appears to be several Hummers in the vicinity of the area.”
Draco couldn’t have this conversation. Not here, not now.
“Is that what it’s called?” Bellatrix looked at the round, clocklike device with amusement. “It’s not a very creative name, is it?”
We Apparated to a point close enough to walk to the Manor. The road was deserted, which struck me as strange this time of day, but it fitted our purpose that we remained unobserved.
The house was collapsing as wood burned. Plumes of smoke rose to the sky. The roof tilted, one side blackened into coal, before it caved in.
I blushed. “Don’t be vulgar, Pott -- Harry.”
Draco went cold. The mashed-up potatoes was ash in his mouth. “What the hell are you talking about?”
“Neither,” Shacklebolt said. His voice was deep, like a gentle swell of the ocean, that sought to reassure Draco. “We’re Intelligence.”
Two men in plain dark suits were at his father’s desk. Sheafs of paper littered the carpet, books were ripped, the chair overturned, the drawers pulled out and askew.
“It’s the mark of the Death Eaters,” Harry said. He knew that all too well. “The rebels against the Ministry.”
“They’re swamp dragons, right?” I remembered coming across mentions of them in an article about West African shamans and their curses.
He remained standing where he was. The others crowded in, even Harry. Draco didn’t miss that there was two guns that were cocked.
All thoughts of sex vanished when I stuck my head into my flat.
“Neither of us are under a spell,” Potter’s deep voice came from behind me. “Hello, Zabini.”
“So much for loyalty,” Draco snorted. However, this did simplify matters. They didn’t need to rely on Fletcher to be their messenger to Riddle. They could keep watch on the warehouse without Fletcher’s further involvement.
They had been the best of friends at school, from the age of eleven up until their graduation, full of dreams and hopes. Until circumstances intervened, and those dreams were crushed under the brutal heel of reality.
Potter had kissed me.
“What?”
Harry did smile now. “Am I about to learn about the dark criminal past of Draco Malfoy?”
“Well, the Acronium is this source of magical power, you see, and –”
Not to mention my editor was growing increasingly frustrated with me for not finishing my article. She had sent me five owls to remind me of the upcoming deadline; I was certain the next post I would receive from her would be a Howler.
None came. I dared not breathe, body locked in tight suspense. Could he have followed me? The man certainly knew more than enough, but this building was discreet, and an unexpected choice for a wizard.
“If need be, one day my heir will return to the school and cleanse it of all the blood traitors and Mudbloods,” he said. His eyes glittered intently. “And this heir will inherit all my powers, all the knowledge I have accumulated over the years. He will guide our world to its rightful course.”
“Wonderful.”
“Interesting.” Draco set the Decoder down again. “I don’t think platinum was used in antiquity except as an alloy.”
“You’re free to leave if you want to,” Harry answered seriously. “I won’t stop you. But you want to get to the bottom of this as much I do, don’t you? Your father’s death, the people he was involved with, what he was doing? And I know you want to make your own archaeological discovery and name just as much as anyone. The real-life Indiana Jones, so to speak.”
“In my visions, I keep on seeing the book in a cave. Is there a cave around there?”
His back arched. Memory provided what reality could not – the ghostly traces of how Harry used to trail his mouth down Draco’s shoulder as they pulled together firm and tight. Harry always had a streak of teasing, with a tendency to slow down at the most inopportune moments, namely when Draco was gasping and on the verge of losing control.
In the meanwhile, I dug up the issue of the Quibbler that discussed this mysterious Circle. It was old, having been published a few years back, and I had to visit the British Library, Magical Section, to obtain a copy.
Draco fought to conceal his annoyance. “I did warn you the theory was a bit … stretched. Besides, all myth have their roots in truth. People used to think the Trojan war was a myth until someone everyone thought as a nutter actually managed to excavate the site. Granted, his methods did more damage to the discovery, and he did have ulterior motives. But his persistence did end up in revealing Troy as real.”
“You’re a fucking idiot,” Harry said as he stand over Bellatrix. He looked at Draco with concern. “Are you alright?”
“Yes,” Harry said, his voice pitched low. “I think that lesson came to me the hard way.”
Harry picked up the automatic. With a deft movement, he brought it down on Greyback’s head. The twitching ended.
“No, no. It’s fine.” Potter got up. I sat back, fastidiously rearranging my clothes to be more presentation. It was a silly exercise; Granger had caught us en flagrante, and there was no going back.
There was a loud crunch. Harry slammed the wall in frustration.
“I just wanted to visit you,” Blaise feigned hurt as he emerged from the fireplace. “You cleaned up nice. Business meeting?”
And Harry was fit – their sex was great. It more than made up for him leaving his socks all over the flat. Even now, it took all of Draco’s willpower to keep his hands off Harry: Draco loved running his fingers through Harry’s messy hair – tousled, Harry would insist – and pressing against the firm chest, the strong arms.
I gave her a look that had once reduced Eloise Midgen to tears. The receptionist, however, simply glanced down at the thick parchment she had in front of her, unperturbed by my expression. “Yup. I see no one is available until tomorrow. Would you like me to make an appointment for you, sir?”
I withdrew my hand – and knocked over my thermos.
That wasn’t strictly true, as Hedwig reminded him. But it didn’t matter; Harry’s spectacles, switching to avionics mode, displayed the course of the suspect car. It was picking up speed.
“Hmm … well, without more details, I’m afraid we can’t do anything. Maybe our squad on the scene can turn up more details, but I’m afraid the only thing I can offer is a pamphlet on magical self-defense.”
“Where’s your sense of adventure, Harry? As I recall, you seem to be the one who always traipsed around the Forbidden Forest when we were in school.”
There was suspicion in place of old comradery now, and a pang rang in Harry at the thought of it. But Harry was here on business, and there was no room for sentiment. However, he didn’t know where to begin. How to accuse his old friends of … what was Harry supposed to ask?
I thought of the bottle of dark-silver memory that used to be the book-key in my bag. It reminded me of liquid memory. I shook my head. “We don’t have a Pensieve to use.” And I was not sure if I wanted to touch it again. Like liquid mercury, Slytherin’s memory seemed dangerous to approach without safeguards.
Potter chuckled. “I spend most of my days at a desk too, Mrs. Malfoy. I don’t know how much advice I can offer Draco about staying healthy other than eat his greens.” He grinned at me across the table. I aimed a kick at him under and missed.
Perhaps it was due to the excitement at finally having regular habitants again, but Kreacher had been outdoing himself with the cooking, stretching his gastronomical oeuvre, even if we were simply sitting in the kitchen. Two plates of duck confit gave off mouth-watering aromas, and roasted potatoes and steamed peppers took place at the center of the table.
McGonagall noticed the direction of my gaze.
“There.” Draco stepped back finally. The tie was still askew, though a marked improvement from earlier. It wouldn’t pass muster for his father’s dinners at Malfoy Manor, but Draco didn’t think anyone else would give a damn.
“Yes, we get it. You know your protection spells,” I interrupted. Harry mock-glared at me. “But how do we get past it?”
“This is what alerted us,” Riddle said, teeth bared even wider. “This entire room has sensors watching it. We knew you would come eventually. We just didn’t expect it to be that soon.”
“You told me I could come by whenever to inspect your place,” he said, setting down my mug and reaching up the shelf for another one. He wrinkled his nose. That sight should not have looked so attractive. “Merlin, you smell horrible. Did you douse a bottle of whisky on you or something?”
Draco returned his look coolly. “We’re coming.”
The Manor, true to Granger’s word, was mostly undamaged, though the smell of smoke still hung in the air, mostly thank to poor ventilation. Luckily, there were no char marks or any observable traces of the fire that Cross had caused. If I had not been there, I would have almost been unable to tell. The stacks of books I left were still there.
“Alright. We’ll activate the tracker on you. Do you have eyes on the attacker?”
“I do have to concern myself with it,” Draco said. “They killed my father. They tried to kill me. Even if I ignore my altruistic side and say, well, let the police deal with them, I can’t ignore that I have a personal grudge against them now. Nor,” Draco added, “can I ignore the fact that they probably will come after me and my loved ones.”
And more than just his reputation. The strict laws and code of conduct that governed society meant that sexual impropriety at best, an offense that meant financial and professional damage, and at worse, meant involuntary incarceration.
I’m much better than an animal, Hedwig’s silent voice said in Harry’s head. He could sense the pulse of interest as she analyzed the animatronic owl on Malfoy’s arm. Those orange eyes looked back.
“But there are people who believe it’s real enough to pay good money for it,” Shacklebolt said. “Money that directly finances the killing of our troops. So in that respect, it’s real enough.”
Theo gave Draco an alarmed glance. Draco sympathized. If he were the owner of the boat, he wouldn’t fancy having two obviously hardened criminal, one armed with a nasty looking gun, aboard.
“I was a child, and a rather stupid one at that. So I stumbled in, because I saw my father. I thought: ‘Everything should be fine. Father’s just with his friends at some odd costume party.’ The man next to him noticed that I walked in. I still remember his face. It was a hideous face, almost snakelike, with two slits for a nose. But what I remember the most clearly was the man’s eyes. They were red, like two rubies that were set aflame.”
Harry increased power, banking to the left to slip out of the grid. He would be close enough to the suspects soon.
But in this digitalized and interconnected age, it was crucial for anyone who wished to rise in the world to have a SI assistant. The vast influx of data needed the dedicated attention and analysis that went beyond what one man was able to provide, as the SI connected man to all the resources provided by the world wide Web. One that linked everything from the smart-threads in his trousers to the monitors maintaining order for the traffic grid.
He tensed, ready for the car to shudder to a halt from the hail of bullets –
“We know your history, Mr. Malfoy,” Shacklebolt said. “You’ve worked in the Middle East before, trying to track down looted antiquities after the fall of Saddam. By all accounts, you were brilliant at it.”
He looked at Harry. Harry sat with his eyes closed. Draco envied Harry’s state of meditative calm. How Harry managed that, Draco didn’t know.
“Ah.” I didn’t want to point out he could just keep his door locked while his back was turned. I was secretly thrilled to see the rest of his desk cluttered with loose sheaves of papers and a half-eaten sandwich. “Is that how you knew I was here?”
I doused it hastily and glared at Potter. Trust a Gryffindor to goad someone trying to kill you. “You might have experience surviving the Killing Curse, but not everyone has,” I snapped. “And I’m deducting the cost of repairs for that shelf from your pay.”
“Hand over the Grimoire, Mr. Potter.” Cross stood. “I don’t see the pointing of using unnecessary force.”
“I don’t,” Potter said. “But there are some things that I had to learn out of necessity.” I waited for him to elaborate.
Except for the body slumped on the floor.
“How would you know?” Harry snapped, goaded into anger now. “How would you know anything about this?”
I named it. “It had some ridiculous plot involving a Time-Turner, the daughter of a Dark Wizard, and a love triangle.”
“What is it?” Potter crouched next to me. “Nice sword.”
There was a knock at the door.
“I’m glad you came to your senses so quickly,” he said. He gave me what must pass for him a benevolent smile. “You seemed so resistant to the idea that I thought I would have had to wait for a few more days at the very least.”
“What, this?” I twisted one of his nipples again.
So he did the first thing that came to him. He kissed Harry.
There was a tinny hoot of assent.
Harry looked doubtful. “Sounds like a sure way for it to be found.”
Malfoy smiled. “Yes. Metis, show what we found.”
“You need to do better than that,” he said.
“Who else is involved?” Potter asked him coldly. Power emanated from him like fire burning; his features were stern and rough, like hewn wood. “Why do you need Draco to find the Grimoire?”
My footsteps echoed with loud clacks on the marble floor. I had always admired women’s high heels that clicked when they walked; the sound was, to me, an audible evidence of power.
He had the hands of an artist, long and thin, the fingers spreading like the legs of a spider. They tapped gently on the table right now in a pattern: index finger twice, ring finger once, pinky thrice, then middle finger once.
“Ye – yes, master?”
I ran to my safe, quickly dissolving the concealment spell. It was still intact. My chest remained tight as I touched it with my wand.
“How do you know that?” I demanded. I gave Potter an annoyed look. Here I was trying to demonstrate my expertise and experience, and Potter was outshining me in such a casual manner.
Draco’s pulse quickened. “Is that so?”
“Two of the biggest drug runners in London,” Harry explained. Then he wanted to smack himself. Malfoy was a civilian and had no need to know this information. Not to mention he shouldn’t be revealing any facts about the case before the press conference.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I would think you were joking about the cleaning except I remember how much of a nut you were when we lived together.” His mood had improved a little.
Those glory days of Malfoy prestige had passed, and Draco was forced to promise he would never abscond with Her Majesty’s property again and obey whatever orders were issued him in the future.
“What is it, sir?” the manager asked, who apparently was not as worldly as either Harry or Finnegan. “What happened to him?”
“You know, Potter, that was very eloquent of you. But it doesn’t matter what I think here, does it? It matters what our dear Draco thinks. So what say you, Draco? Do you think because you’ve ‘seen the error of your ways’, that you’ll be welcomed by the sheep of society?
“True.” Fletcher’s fingers touched Draco’s shoulders. Draco tried not to shy away from them. “We scum need to stick together.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, thankful for the training that prevented him from showing his alarm that Malfoy could tell, “but that’s not why I came.”
Reinforcements were here now. Aurors in their distinctive red tunic surrounded the Opera House, their wands pointed at the Harry, who now clasped the man’s hands in an iron vise.
A soft chime rang. Cross looked at me, his eyes cold even as his face stayed in that bland smile. “Speaking of friends, your Mr. Potter is here.”
century,” I enunciated clearly.
She held up her hands. “Sorry. I’ll come back.”
“But you’re saying that it could have powers. I heard some of the stories, that it can gift the holder with foresight. How does that play into the myths? Achilles was a warrior, not a seer.”
“Nothing out of the ordinary here,” I drawled before I could stop myself. Relief that my parents were alive overshadowed everything, even my common.
“Draco?” Shacklebolt picked up the phone, sounding deep and reassuring. Draco’s heartbeat relaxed a fraction of a fraction of a second. “What’s wrong?”
Still, one must keep up appearances. And I knew I looked like how I felt: shit. I was tired, my mood irritable and jumpy. And that unexpectedly smooth meeting aside, I had not fully set aside my misgivings working with Potter. The combination of that and an unwanted infatuation made my head spin.
“I think she would like that,” Harry said. He sat down on my bed. “Both of them.”
“I would strongly advise against it.” Potter scrutinized my face carefully. “Given what has happened, it’s best that you remain here. But if you feel you have to ….”
Potter stared at me. “Isn’t she married? To someone else.”
She noticed my gaze. “I had it modified so it works with the interference magical activity produces. It’s basically a machine that combines –”
For one, he was far too impatient, and refused to listen to any instruction from the Healers. After a day at St. Mungo’s, he insisted on checking himself out.
Draco was disappointed.  He had wanted to be involved in the monumental task of cataloging and restoring of them. But that would absorb all his attention and energy. Shacklebolt was right: the key to tracking down Mors Mordre was back in England, hidden somewhere in his family’s secrets.
“It was your idea to come out here,” Draco pointed out. “In this place where there’s not even a half-decent hotel with proper room service.”
“I’m trying to catch him alive,” Potter shouted back as he shot a Stunner aimed at the intruder’s chest.
Then –
“So,” Harry echoed Ron. “How are you?”
Then it shifted and I was in a cave. A book rested on a roughhewn stone round in shape. The book was the one I had seen earlier in the vision. This time, memory and a greater instinct for self-preservation stayed my hand from touching it.
“Really? You can hack the Auror database but not a home console?”
I reeled from his contempt. It came in waves heavy and unfiltered.
It was blank.
Abruptly, I was aware my footfalls were not the only noise in the hallway. There was another, softer click, that accompanied mine.
I stepped closer. Potter shifted next to me.
He was in a sparse space, made out of prefabricated materials. It was all brutal, functional lines, with the only concession to comfort stiff wooden chairs that would probably aggravate Draco’s back ache if he sat in one.
“I’ll … make a cup of coffee for you too, then,” he said.
“No,” I said. “Don’t be ridiculous. I didn’t even take Divination at Hogwarts. I seemed to recall you did, though.”
Damn. And you did that all within a few seconds?
Malfoy sighed impatiently. “You Aurors are all nothing but thick-brained fools with more muscle than sense. To answer my own question: the Cruciatus doesn’t stop working until I fully flush it out of your biomechanical systems and trigger a refresh. This is why I disabled your connection with your Sentient Intelligence.”
“Don’t call him that,” Potter said automatically.
I looked at Potter. It was too late for that now. Besides, my head was not clear enough to be perusing through dense texts of Middle English. “We have a lot of work to do in the morning ….” I began.
“Where did you learn how to do that?” Draco asked. Firearms and Combat was not a course taught at Hogwarts Independent School.
“We spotted similarities in this file’s encryption that matches the signatures of several military projects in the Ministry,” the SI said. “Those were designed in part by a contractor, so it could be that this file’s protection is also created by the same person.”
“He’s polite and has charming manners,” she said mildly. “And this family owes a lot to him.”
“Like Voldemort,” Potter said.
Harry grinned.
Potter looked unapologetic. His hair stuck up in a way that made me want to run my hands through it.
“So, Draco, how are you spending your time these days?” my father asked. “Still wasting your time buried in those books of yours?”
Harry watched Ron and Hermione’s faces carefully. It was the slightest reaction, but it was there: a tiny tightening of the corners of their mouths that gave them away.
“Well,” Harry quirked a smile, “then you’ll just have to stick it out.”
My hand grazed the plinth of my great-great-granduncle Quintus Malfoy, known for his experimentations with Dragon Pox on Muggles. He was lauded in the Magical society for his breakthroughs, but no one mentioned the contributions of his ‘volunteers’.
“Well. Alright.”
“That little thing is all you found?” he asked, not bothering to hide his disappointment. “Nothing else?”
“I suppose you’re right. It’s much simpler and easier, I suppose.” Still, Draco could not shake the sense of uneasy, that everything was too straightforward.
You think?
Cross registered the effects they had on me. “If you help us, you would not have to endure that any longer. Think about it … you’ll be granted the respect you deserve. You and your family will no longer need to live in shame. The Manor, restored to its glory. Your family no longer having to be trapped in that one wing. Your father, no longer tainted with the shame of the past.”
“Seems like we’re going to have a talk at the office tomorrow about your following the regulations, Harry,” he said. “Or lack of.”
“Strangely calm,” he said. “I don’t think I’ll ever stop wondering what life would be like if they lived, but I don’t do too badly now, do I?” He took hold of me as I closed the door to our room and locked it with a firm snick. If the proprietors of this fine establishment did not care for their security, that was their business. I would be certain of ours.
“Book knowledge is no substitute for lived experience,” Potter said. My father’s mouth puckered. “That’s why we came to you.”
“I do,” Draco said in annoyance. “I’m an English aristo. It’s practically a requirement.” The semiautomatic was heavy, though not much more than the shotgun he occasionally used back in the days when he had participated in clay shooting with friends, and even more rare, when his father used to organize game shoots on Manor grounds. Draco didn’t mind the bits of pottery, but to see live animals, even ones noisy and irritating as pheasants, made him gag. Just another mark of failure for Draco as far as his father was concerned.
Harry grabbed me by the cuff, pulling me out through the hole in the wall. We fell in a heap of tangled limbs, hitting the ground with a thud.
Harry’s face shook me out of my daydream. “I don’t know.”
There was a line of shrunken, shriveled things on the wall leading up the stairs. It was too dark to make out much details, though I could have sworn in the reflected light they looked like eyes watching me.
Draco swallowed, his fear intensifying at the sight of yellowed teeth bared lasciviously. ‘
Damn Granger and her sharp mind. “Alright. But at least give me his address.”
“You did a good job cleaning this,” Draco said, professional interest overcoming his terror as he bent to examine the Decoder. “Was everything in working order?”
“We still might have gotten there faster with a military plane,” Harry said, examining the glassware. “This feels … I don’t know, but should we be doing this?”
“No, I don’t,” I said rather tartly. “I’m a Legilimens, not a mind-reader, Potter. I assume you know the difference.”
Nonetheless, they rode the rest of the way in silence, Finnegan typing on his handheld and Harry staring out at the city. It was a stunning spread of crystalline spires mixed with traditional architecture. He allowed his mind to drift into meditative blankness as they crossed the Millennium Bridge, seeing the other hovercars and the hulking ships on the Thames. Overhead, there was the roar of the aeroplane headed to Heathrow.
“I’m hurt, Mr. Potter. Not by your childish name-calling, but by your assumption that I’ll hurt Draco here. I’m not going to do that. He’s a valuable piece of the puzzle.”
“I understand.”
“Alright,” I said, forcing my mind to focus on the matter at hand. “And let me know when you visit next time, so I can go to the wine cellar beforehand and get –”
Malfoy nodded. “You’ve done your research into me.” He gave a quick smile to let Harry know he wasn’t upset. “I assume this means you know my father was arrested and all those gory details.”
“Of course,” Potter said. He sat down across from me. “I’m having dinner with them sometimes this weekend.”
“I’m not worried about that!” Potter all but exploded. He twisted the fabric of the couch in frustration. “I’m worried about your safety.”
“You’re going to need all the help you can get,” Draco snapped. “And I’ve been shooting since I could hold a gun. Do people really forget that I grew up in the country?”
“If I know Riddle, he’d have them in the most prominent place possible,” Harry said. “On display, to show his power and dare others to take it.”
He looked at me. “So why did you want to meet a chimera?”
Malfoy nodded. “Cruciatuses break down the link between your bio-enhanced components and your connection with your Sentient Intelligence. In this case, it manifested in that sharp hearing you were experiencing. I’m surprise you didn’t go mad from it.” He cocked his head. “You withstood its effect for more than a minute. Impressive, Commander Potter.”
“My clothes.” Weasley reddened. “You don’t need to return them.”
“It has.” Harry tried to think of the last time he saw Ron. It was right after their first mission, after the first disturbance with Voldemort’s attempted takeover, when they had both eager green Auror recruits.
“We can’t pretend like we’re working for one of the banks or whatever companies that are in there,” Draco said. “We’re not even in suits.”
I squinted. It was the entrance to a cave. Cold air seeped out of what looked like a giant maw of darkness, and for a second, I quailed at the thought of having to enter into such a place.
“Then it’s a date.”
Potter motioned for me to stand. We followed with more measured footsteps as we entered the house.
“What? But they checked you — checked both of us — when they brought us here.”
“In the short time I’ve been given, as reasonably sure as I can be,” Draco responded irritably. “I worked off the assumption that the Decoder represented the ancient Macedonian calendar, given that the supposed commissioner of the piece, Aristotle, intended this to be a gift to Alexander the Great. The inner ring here,” Draco pointed, “is meant to represent the zodiac. They’re very similar to the modern day ones we use, actually. It became more clear that was the case after I had traced it out. And then –”
“I suggested to Shacklebolt that we bring you here to ascertain the Shield. I had thought – I didn’t expect –”
Draco signed. He never carried over a hundred pounds in cash. He dropped the bills in front of Fletcher.
What would have Harry done? He didn’t know. Thoughts of that gorgeous man – Blaise – had all but been banished when Malfoy was in front of him. Harry wetted his lips. “I don’t know.”
The hideout was a labyrinthine warren of dimly lit passageways. It reminded Draco of Malfoy Manor, with the minor detraction of less expensive furnishings.
They looked through several more crates. Draco was struck dumb by the impressive array of artifacts. The ones in this room must have been the culmination of years of work. Once again, his self-control almost snapped. So much pillaging and looting, and it was clear that the ones who did so gave no damn. Draco saw the marks of careless handling like scars on these objects – they were only out to enrich themselves at the expense of their collective heritage. It would be one matter if these were being sold by those who would starve otherwise. But the money would be going to those who beheaded anyone that flouted their narrow views of their universe, people who used the funds raised from the sales to kill Draco’s own countrymen.
“I’m having tea with Aunt Andromeda next weekend,” I said, changing the subject.
“You’re going to have to get through me first,” he told Dolohov. Bedraggled and even more unkempt than usual, Harry stood between them how Draco always pictured Achilles after defeating Hector: bloodied, bruised – and triumphant.
“Or come with Draco sometime. Now that you two are friends,” my mother said, giving my father another look. Potter, who had reacted to my father’s disapprobation with blithe indifference, now shifted uncomfortably. “I think it would be nice, don’t you think, Draco?”
He looked back at me with eyes bright and face ruddy, his hands reaching down past my waistband. I groaned at the warm fleshly contact, and Harry grinned.
“Malfoys don’t get jetlagged,” Draco snapped. “It’s plebian.”
Instead I aimed another kick at him under the table. There was a thump as my foot connected with his shin. Potter let out a muffled oof as a small thump sounded.
Harry wasn’t sure whether he was simply looking for trouble or that he had actually smelled a crime. The facts were simple and neat. A little too neat, but in Harry’s experience, sometimes the most logical explanation was the reality.
He glanced around. No one seemed to have followed him out of the Leaky. There were a few angry looking men walking around, but they weren’t the one that had chased Harry out.
Potter nodded. “I know I said I didn’t think you needed it, but I’m changing my mind. I think the situation calls for it.”
“No, I’m just about done.” Draco stood up, stretched. There was a slight pop as the spine cracked.
The relief was quickly replaced by anger and a deep sense of violation. I lived here: I ate and slept and fucked here. For someone to stroll in and upend all that, no matter for what, was so deeply wrong; the outrage left me naked and sick. I wanted to throw up.
“Why don’t you take Mr. Potter for a tour of the gardens, Draco?” my mother suggested. The sun already set, and it was well into the evening. I forgot dinner usually ran long, especially the more formal ones. If it had just been the family, I would have had time to finish and skip the rest of the night to visit the library.
“How would you know how to do that? Do you do this a lot?”
Cross laughed. “I own that publication, you know. How do you think I collect that all those objects of power? By the way, you lost me a very substantial collection with your raid. I think we can call it even, don’t you think?”
“I encountered them before,” Potter replied quietly. “Voldemort’s.”
“I can point you to six different headlines in today’s newspaper that argues otherwise.”
“I’m alright.” Harry looked at his watch. “Kingsley’s men should be here –”
Harry swallowed his reply and followed.
He winked at me.
“I don’t need to!” I was excited. This was more exhilarating than flying. “There’s only a few types of magic that gives you visions. What I experienced before – it’s a memory of someone’s. That’s why when I experienced it, it was more than images. It’s like when I use Legilimency into someone’s past. I retain all five of my senses when I touch the book.”
Potter’s sympathetic expression folded in, into a mask of nonchalant cheer. It hit me with a pang at the loss of the rapport I was beginning to feel with him. I should have remembered Granger’s warning to ask gently.
“I haven’t thought about Hogwarts in a while, Mr. Malfoy,” he said. “My brother Colin died in the last battle there ten years ago.”
This was why I insisted on being single, I thought facetiously. Nothing compared to the luxury of an empty bed.
Draco shifted slightly, trying to gain a more comfortable seat.
“Yes.” Harry strapped a holster under the billowy material. “It’s dangerous, Draco. The people meeting are from two of the most dangerous groups on the planet. Who knows what might happen?”
“Why?” Draco asked. “Did you ask me out here because you actually needed my help that desperately?” He didn’t know what he was fishing for, an admission that Harry needed him or that all this was a farce. And even furious as he was with Harry, he recognized that no one expected circumstances to derail so precipitously. It was Draco’s own fault -- if he had only driven faster –
“Yes, I know,” I said with a touch of impatience. Desire spiked at his touch and it made me tetchy. “You’re highly in demand.”
“I promise.” Draco steeled himself, his hand clenching around the handle. In spite of the bravado he had just displayed, his blood chilled at the possibility he might actually be forced to take a life.
“Draco?” Harry’s breath tickled Draco’s ears. “I think you cracked a rib.”
Third: what was it doing in my bag? I had never set eyes on it before today. It wasn’t any book I owned, and I did not take it from the library at Gringotts. So how the hell did I appear in my bag? It wasn’t a coincidence – my intuition told me that much. If I learned anything over the past few years, it was that everything happens for a reason. It was a hard lesson, and one that I resisted, but it was engrained in me.
But now Draco wondered if what Draco saw was related to his father’s ensuing poor mood. Draco and Lucius often argued – it had become their natural state of existence by the time Draco had graduated from Oxford, but that night had been particularly brutal.
I dropped it. Exhaustion flooded me and it was only through the timely intervention of Granger and her sergeant that I did not collapse to the floor.
