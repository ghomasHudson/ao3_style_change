Draco smirked before digging his thumbnails into those candy-pink nipples. “Then it’s a good thing I know how much you like eating arse. Which you will be doing later, in the bedroom that will be the place where we’ll shag many a time.”
“Why a parrot?” she laughed. “Sure, it looks like a bird, but what specifically makes it a parrot?”
Harry’s mind quickly turned to the situation at hand when Draco’s hands spread his cheeks as wide as they could go and pressed his lips to the exposed hole to kiss it deeply. “Oh,” Harry said with a shiver.
“You’ll see,” Draco insisted, picking up on the twinge of fear in Harry’s voice.
“Thanks,” Harry nodded. It was a small party, but somehow these Slytherins made it feel like the center of a much larger one, where they were the inner circle. Harry had never really felt anything like that before, and it was exciting. “Oh, wow,” he exclaimed after claiming a forkful of his cake slice. “This is so perfectly rich.”
But even post-production came to an end. In Harry’s hand was the finished product—season one of MTV’s ‘Catfish’ starring Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.
Draco patted his face dry with a towel and turned around so he could face Harry through the open bathroom door. “No such thing, Harry. On the contrary I like to hear when I’m making you happy.”
Remus forced a nod. “Of course, sweetheart.”
Draco had been working hard to absolve his past, and what better place to do it than the place where it happened?
“Yes, yes. I understand, but I can’t make any promises right now,” Draco said dismissively before trying to dash in escape once more.
“Holy—Draco!” Harry sputtered, red-faced and uncomfortably aroused for being in a public space. “Other people get their mail here!”
Oddly enough, that created one thing in common between Lucius and his son’s roommate: they both didn’t trust Draco’s taste in the slightest. During the few visits Lucius made to the flat, Harry liked to side with him on the issue of marriage purely to piss Draco off.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Harry laughed right back. He loved how they could do that; laugh during sex. After all, Draco’s penis was in his bum. It was all very ridiculous and didn’t deserve as much seriousness as the world seemed to give it.
“Lucius,” Narcissa sighed. “First of all, we are not picking favorite grandchildren like we did pick a favorite child.”
willed them shut again?—but it seemed some time had passed. Harry blinked, rubbing his eyes to reveal the room bathed in the light of late morning. Damn, maybe getting tucked in was the secret thing Harry had been missing all along. He would likely see a return of the nightmares and restlessness soon, but these past two nights had been bliss.
Harry was mildly overwhelmed by all of the products for a moment. There was a whole table dedicated to vibrators on plastic cords that could be sampled before making the purchase. There were restraints of all kinds and most importantly, lingerie in a variety of shapes and sizes.
“You’re disgusting,” Harry said fondly. He ran his fingers through Draco’s soft wispy hair.
“It’s your cock, sir,” Harry said louder as he squirmed in the too-tight underwear. “I only come when you say.”
Conversation continued, staying away from controversial topics like unapproving parents or future admissions this time.
“No!” Theo yelled, but the rest of the tiles flew up from the ground to cover his mouth. Where they had been ripped up, little dirt squares with crawling worms remained. He tried to shout again, but even his eyes were covered.
“Okay then. Well. I’ll be owling you, then. Have a… night.” Ron turned and walked towards the front door, Draco and Harry following behind to shut it. Draco watched out of the peep-hole until the Aurors had all filed out the front gates, the redhead last, and let out a breath when he felt the wards restore from whatever blocking agent the Auror department had used. Bloody fascists. Draco ought to know.
That only seemed to please his husband more. Harry didn’t even clench up like he sometimes did when Draco filled him up; he just let Draco have his way with him.
The girl had thrown a wild fit when confronted with the elderly woman that Hermione had hired to watch their baby. All Ron could understand between the garbled yells of her tantrum that the woman was ‘boe-ring!’ and ‘smellsy’.
Harry had never felt anything so blissfully sharp, not like a blade but still biting. “I’m a whore.”
All of that hope would exhaust someone like Draco after their last disappointment, but Harry held it somehow.
“It was one time,” Harry recalled calmly, imagining himself holding that card tightly in his hand. “And I hadn’t even known you two used to date when I slept with him.”
Sensing his hesitation, Harry looked to Draco and swallowed his bite of potato spiral. “What is it?” Harry asked, voice small.
“We don’t think you’re an idiot,” Draco said as if it were obvious.
Draco left Harry’s shirt on, more focused at the task at hand. There would be countless nights to explore every inch of his body, to see what spots made him whimper and to hear how he liked to be spanked and talked dirty to, but this was a frenzy. Draco was on a mission to make Harry come, to make his eyes roll back into his head and show him what being with Draco Malfoy was really like.
.” Could Draco not cast a corporeal Patronus?
he loathes me,” Harry continued to snark as he sauntered up to the embarrassed blonde. “If he hated me, he’d treat me like trash and purposefully give me lower grades. Oh, wait.”
“Yes, dearest?”
“If I recall correctly you were the one begging for it, ‘pleeeease, Daddy, pleeeeeeease’,” Draco imitated.
“In May at London Pride, he went shirtless. The year before that, he actually hitched a ride on a float and snogged one of the drag queens on it. That was before he and Colin got together, of course. Theo’s a faithful man.”
“The guests of honor,” Ginny greeted them with arms wide open, giving them both a hug. Harry noted when she drew her hand back that she was holding a whip. Merlin’s beard, tonight was going to be weird. “Welcome, welcome.”
Hermione motioned to the plastic sandwich in Rose’s grip with a piece of felt lettuce and felt cheese stuck in there. “We’re having a picnic. Care to join?” Rose’s stuffed bears, dogs, and dolphins were gathered around the quilted picnic blanket Hermione had spread out over the floor.
thinks.”
“Yes, you may.” She picked up the empty tea pot and poured the imaginary liquid into Ron’s cup, careful to also top off the stuffed elephant’s cup.
,” Draco gasped, biting his lower lip in a swirl of pleasure and pain that made his cheeks flush.
Trying to catch his breath, Harry coughed slightly and couldn’t find words from his raw throat.
Draco grinned, saying nothing as he mercilessly ground his hips in deep save the sounds of his groans.
Draco, his pale and angular face aghast, turned to look Harry dead in the eye. “He tried to
“Oh, goodbye Draco! It’s always so good seeing you, and I do hope you’ll bring Harry around more. I know my husband can be demanding of who he thinks would make his son happy, but it’s all because he cares. We love you so much, Draco.”
“None of you can beat what I got them,” Pansy declared proudly. She’d spent way too much on it, as usual.
“Gay? What?” he laughed. “Why wouldn’t I be? That’s not the sort of thing that changes with age, you know. It’s a bit of a permanent fix.”
That last word echoed in his mind like a struck gong. Love, love, love, love.
“You’re going to need to get it wetter than that, sweetheart,” Draco taunted him. “It’s going in your arse after all. Show me some proper respect.”
The creature of realization that had crawled up Draco’s shoulder had gone feral with rage.
They passed by rooms with spanking benches lined up in rows, metal clasps at the bottom of them to bind the submissive’s hands. Harry didn’t say anything but he was very interested in what that would look like, multiple people bent over taking punishment.
“—Two handsome older men like that, Remus and Sirius,” Pansy marveled. “Their sex must be fantastic and—“
Draco and Harry exchanged looks. That was seriously what his album was called? It conjured up the mental image of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis in cat suits robbing a bank.
It was honestly the way the world should have worked, in Colin’s most humble opinion. “Exactly. Maybe you could come up for a potion for that.”
“It went well,” Draco enthused as Harry walked him out of the room and towards the grand staircase. “They’re excited to meet you. Probably too excited, and I apologize in advance for literally everything out of their mouths.”
“I’m eating gold, like, the metal gold?” Harry asked again, eyes blown wide.
Narcissa reached across the table and took the parchment—which wound up being one of those muggle Hallmark cards. “’This card is being held…’,” she read off the sparkly text and held it so Lucius could see the card, too. Then, she opened the card to see the inside. “’By the world’s greatest grandparents.’” For a second she was confused, and then it all made sense. Her hand flew to cover her mouth.
The only one who wasn’t all smiles and pats on the back was Lucius. However, Lucius Malfoy was rarely even semi-smiles and brushes on the back. When Draco noticed his glower, a sigh escaped him. “Father, you’re going to bore a hole in the wall if you stare at it any longer.”
“I am,” she said slowly once the fire in her lungs had died down. “The size of a fucking whale. And you are telling me that you’re having, ‘like’, a hard time?”
Harry had never seen Pansy attended by two collared submissives being hand-fed grapes but he certainly had the image in his mind now. “Well, Ginny, meet Pansy, and Pansy, meet Ginny,” he reintroduced them. “We’re all here for the same reason, to catch whoever sold Draco and me out to the papers.”
“Not in this weather, nah. Last time we tried that, Cooke nearly got electrocuted,” Ginny reminded him. “So, I’ll actually be at the flat with nothing to do.” Ginny wasn’t blind to their recent distance, either.
“M-M-Malfoy!” exclaimed an intern.
Okay this is unrelated but how great would it have been if Voldemort never existed and Remus/Sirius had all these kids who went to Hogwarts and constantly got in trouble with Snape because they would refuse to stop sassing him?? It would be the greatest thing. Parent-teacher conferences would be infinitely more combative and sarcastic. Oh my god. It would be perfect. Anyway, Drarry!
Ron didn’t want to stick his hand in there either, so he cast a perfect Wingardium Leviosa and snatched the note out of the air.
His heart leapt—the scroll case!
“What will you be up to while I’m gone?” Draco asked as he got up, a small nudge of encouragement towards Harry doing something productive.
Narcissa bit back a smile.
Draco’s body tensed and relaxed with each prod of Harry’s tongue before his lips planted down around Draco’s arsehole and started to suck.
Harry raised a brow but let the vagueness be. “You’re more than welcome for that and more.”
How his heart had pumped when he sent the ad in. It had almost scared him to hear it so loud in his ears. Then the approval of the ad came back and this heady, hot feeling came over him again, and once more when the magazine went into circulation and he was able to read his own ‘anonymous’ writing. That intense and sudden physical sensation had been a terrifying mix of fear, shame, desire, sadness, anger, too—it was all emotions at once, and scared this brave Gryffindor half to death. There were so many ways this could go wrong and every time Harry tried to list them—exposed to the press, taken advantage of while in submission, no one responding at all because even anonymously he wasn’t worth shit to anyone—he got panicked like this.
That was when he knew what he would do.
“My pleasure,” Draco sneered.
The charcoal he’d pried from the wall was set to good use, scratching out a message.
“You really don’t have to thank me, but yes, you are most welcome,” Draco told him.
Blaise, on the other hand, was often reminded of his old life of bar-hopping and general promiscuity rather than the one he was currently living with a steady job and a steady woman.
“Yes, several. And use your phone sex voice to describe them.” Draco narrowly dodged the elbow in the gut that Harry threw at him, cackling all the while.
“You first,” hissed the one holding the door.
Rose was at the sitter’s for the afternoon so Hermione could have an afternoon to herself without any fits or fusses, heels kicked up on their coffee table in the living room. Maybe it was the way she had been sitting or the strawberry ice cream she had been snacking on, but suddenly it felt like her baby was making an early arrival right there on the sofa.
He climbed into bed actually looking forward to the coming days of his life, something he hadn’t always been able to do. Wrapped up in his expensive sheets Draco slept better than he had in years.
“Good,” Draco nodded. “Now, what do you say to getting clean?”
Blaise smiled wide. “Good. I’ve forgotten what you’ve looked like out of a uniform.”
Harry admired the optimism Alvaro had and couldn’t help getting caught up in it himself.
Something was wrong. Olivia was a talkative thing; a Ravenclaw, at that.
“Hello, is this Jordan Vora?”
Harry dragged the man’s profile picture into Google. In it, Chris was hidden behind sunglasses and drinking some kind of alcohol through a straw. “Nothing on this one.”
There was a humming in the back of Harry’s mind for the rest of the meal, though. At first it was too quiet and obtuse to understand, a feeling with no shape, a thought with no words. It was a burning truth crawling up his throat, a realization he couldn’t stop having once it dawned upon him. Looking between Draco and Hermione and Ron, Harry realized the most important people in the world to him were all at this table.
Still, the whole thing made Harry’s breath feel short. He shuddered and shook around his cup of tea with phantom chills at the thought that he could meet this wonderful man who was both his age and his type.
“It’s all the books we wanted,” Harry told his husband with a smile. “Goodnight Moon, Velveteen Rabbit, Tales of Beetle the Bard…” Maybe one day he’d tell little Lily what the Tale of the Three Brothers did for her papa in the war, but that was a story he’d save for when she was old enough to understand what a war was.
“Well…?” Lucius finally asked, unable to bear this bizarre tension anymore.
Wide-eyed, he reached forward to clutch the parchment for dear life and read.
“I’m going over to my mum’s tonight. I thought I told you this morning,” Maggie said with a raised eyebrow.
“I do! On the basis of suspected kidnapping!” Ron replied and waved a piece of parchment about. “Harry, do you seriously mean to tell me you’re here because you
*** *** ***
Draco sighed and started sipping while Pansy flounced happily back to her couch.
Hey, everyone! Thank you for the likes, favorites, reviews, and follows. Seriously, you’re all the greatest. I’m at college now and I’m finally happy for the first time in a long time and I wish all that happiness to you guys. Seeing little alerts every day that you all enjoy my story really makes me feel like I’m doing something right. Also, kick my ass if I don’t write any faster on the next chapters—I’m being way too lazy for you lovelies. TW for brief mentions of stalking in a relationship, general unhealthiness (not Drarry, of course).
Harry was on Draco before Draco even got a chance to answer. He kissed him with a ferocity unrivaled, a gusto which he’d thought he’d lost a long time ago.
He put his hands on Draco’s shoulders, looking the blonde dead in the eye.
Draco hummed. “Mmm, so.” He uncrossed his legs. “What about that time in the library?” he asked, tongue darting out to wet his lips. “What was that like for you?”
Harry screamed into his pillow before reaching up to swat the Bible out of Draco’s hands.
“Give her my best,” Harry said noncommittally. He loved Molly, but he wasn’t going to get anyone’s hopes up with false promises he’d be over there soon. Fred’s absence was palpable there even if it had been softened by the years. “How’s everyone?”
After having made millions of dollars off of ‘Same Love’ and having not donated a cent of it to actual queer causes, the community as a whole realized what a singularly bizarre man Macklemore was.
And according to Draco, so did his friends. Every life that Voldemort touched festered with fear in dark corners. The whole world had been affected by him, even the children of his supporters.
“Mm, and it’s the NEWTs you have to worry about,” Harry mused. “Don’t worry, they weren’t so bad. I was out of school for a year chasing down a mass-murderer and not once did I crack open a text book, but hey, I returned for some cram months and everything was alright.”
“I wanted to talk to you about—“
“Oh. Next to the rack of strength potions there’s a door, and the ladies’ room is on the right,” Theo explained as he turned the golden ring over and over again in his hands. Maybe if he dropped it in the fire-breathing potion he was making, then perhaps he could forget entirely about his wanting to marry his boyfriend.
Harry was going to share stories with the world and get answers for people who desperately needed them. It was not only a noble cause in his humble opinion, but an adventure with intrigue at every new twist and turn.
There had been rare, beautiful moments of peace between the Lupins and the Malfoys. It seemed that was coming to an end.
“Fine.” Draco backed down considerably, watching the spark fade from Harry’s eyes. He couldn’t kick the man while he was down. “Then go.”
“I find some of those studies incredibly intriguing. I doubt that many wizards would make up observations on house elves’ feelings.”
Even Draco and Harry had to acknowledge that Kennedy was exceptionally beautiful. Even with a man’s name she was the height of femininity.
Draco groaned, inching ever close to his edge but refusing to give in until he made Harry hit his. He moved one hand from his hips to bury in that raven dark hair, tugging on it to lift his chin up while he fucked him. “Say it,” Draco demanded. “Louder!”
“I know, right?”
“Let’s just open it.”
Kingsley wasn’t the sort Harry expected to work at a ‘hip’ or ‘young’ network—Harry just then caught him pressing the touch screen with his large, clumsy fingers and having to retype a word—but Kingsley knew his demographic surprisingly well.
It was incredible that Harry turned out so compassionate after such a shit upbringing on behalf of the Dursleys. Nobody ever tucked Harry in or patted his shoulder with pride or even told him they loved him, but Harry hadn’t let it embitter him. If anything, it just made him more desperate for that attention from someone else.
The kids around her gasped, and Harry gave them an eager wave. That set them free of the Celebrity Barrier that Harry seemed to have, and the braided woman had to chase after them.
“I know, and we will. Just as soon as Ron leaves.” Harry leveled his gaze at Ron and cocked an expectant brow.
“…Harry, Harry,” Draco called to him, his voice soft and soothing.
Harry froze.
“Ginny,” Harry said in disbelief.
“Good.” Harry brought up Draco’s hand to his lips and kissed it, leaving only a little of the facemask behind on the back of his knuckles. “I want to show you my world as much as you’ve shown me yours.”
“Yes,” Grace answered happily, her ankles crossed under her swivel chair. That pregnancy of hers made crossing her legs at the thighs much more difficult. “You can tell the thing I died in a fire-related accident or a drug overdose for all I care.”
Grace grabbed the spoon she’d used for her breakfast cereal and ripped the lid off of the icing in one swift motion. In an act of defiance against some unnamed force she dunked the spoon into the icing, brought it back up, and lapped up every last drop of it.
It had to be fanciful enough for the reading to be lighthearted, but not something Draco himself would fall asleep reading.
“Er, no, I’m fine. Thank you, though.” Harry turned back to Draco. “We can go back out there, just maybe not down whatever rabbit hole the good Mistress wants to drag us down.”
Colin’s small frame held up a long, white flowing fabric. From certain angles it looked like a dress, from others it just looked like regular robes.
Harry let out a low growl.  “So what’re you waiting for?”
Lucius also knew that Harry was only complimenting his cooking so that he would refrain from using house elves in the future. He cocked an eyebrow, but his wife stepped in first. “Thank you, dear,” she told Harry, all warm smiles.
“Draco,” Lucius quickly stopped him, leaning on the bannister.
Before Theo could open his mouth to attempt articulating his current state of confusion with marriage, weddings, rings, and other things, an owl was heard scratching at Theo’s window. “Oh, fuck.”
Gina.”
Smiling wide, Harry found his way back up to eye level with Draco and collapsed onto the bed.
“I do,” Harry whimpered close to a moan, leaning further into Draco. Their different colognes had been mingling all day and Harry loved the smell. “I’m not,” he clarified softly. “A Drag Queen. I’m a man and I just... like this.”
A pleasant chill ran up Harry’s spine. “I think I might like that,” Harry admitted shyly, hand on Draco’s chest gently caressing him with renewed purpose.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Draco asked and furrowed his brow.
Dolores Umbridge looked at him as if he were some sort of alien. “Don’t you know? Queer runs in the Black family. It’s undoubtedly Sirius’ fault, too. Probably got too close to him one night under the blankets, made Regulus pretend he liked it—“
Harry would then argue that the spotlight was often thrust upon him (a prime example was him being one of the few out gay kids in his small town off of New Hope, Pennsylvania, which his aunt and uncle liked to use to accuse him of ‘shoving his alternative lifestyle down everyone’s throats’ simply by existing) but that argument went on for hours and took so many twists and turns that it made Harry’s head spin.
Draco and Harry make a grand reveal at their weekly dinner with Lucius and Narcissa.
For a second there was no sound at all.
With a bit of hysterical laughter from Remus in the background, Olivia nodded. “I am in need of a brassiere! Is that even what the full word is? I read that in a book once.”
“Tacos are not bread,” Draco claimed as a valid excuse to deny anything she had to say.
“Would the both of you—“ Was that
“Then they can play with Padfoot.” Sirius knew better than to throw up on the soft emerald carpet that would be installed in the nursery. “And they’ll have lots of pictures, and the muggle television to stare at animals.”
Sirius, luckily, heard Harry’s message loud and clear. “I’ve got to get back home,” he excused himself. “Wife and kid waiting. You know what I’m talking about, Narcissa.”
who it was.
Harry didn’t even want to dignify that with a response. He knew where Draco got the sarcasm gene from, at least.
Fuck, fuck, fuck. He was late, again! Not just by a few minutes this time, either. Ronald Weasley, partner of the Head Auror, was two full hours late.
It was then that something sort of wonderful happened.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron shook his head with a stubborn force. “Come on, Harry. It doesn’t gross me out or whatever, so why can’t we just talk about it like a couple of normal men with urges and such?”
They’d done something together that they hadn’t done in a long time. They went on a jog. Half of the reason was because Grace needed to settle into the guest room and they wanted to leave her be after the emotionally draining afternoon, and the other half was that Draco felt like he was getting something done when he ran.
Both Harry and Hermione almost coughed on their food when he said that.
“And you really think that can forgive all that came before?” Draco asked, voice quieter.
Sirius burst into a laugh. “Oh, Moony. What would the army of bras even be at war with?”
“—and I’ve been busy with the deposition but I thought we agreed to not let it go more than a week!”
Harry unglued himself from Draco when he saw the littlest Weasley though. Rosie was playing with Hugo on Hermione’s lap, the faithful father holding his son upright. “Oh, Hermione. Ron. He’s perfect.”
“We will now begin the Sorting Ceremony, our first exercise in noting our differences and our unity. The four Great Houses of Hogwarts: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. We shall see where our first years shall make their homes here at Hogwarts.”
Oh, why did Harry have to be so nice and understanding? It was maddening when Draco was feeling so inadequate. “Right,” he faltered. “Let’s start. First things first—the paint for the library.”
“That was Pansy!”
"My point exactly!"
Draco took off the last piece of clothing on Harry triumphantly. He didn’t hesitate to take Harry’s erection in his hand and begin stroking him, letting out a low hiss as he saw the way Harry grabbed the side of the couch in response.
“Harry,” Draco sighed exasperatedly. The notes were scrambled at best and Draco was really beginning to wonder how Harry ever got hired as an Auror.
Lucius squinted at him. “You killed The Dark Lord.”
“That… That’s really wise, dad.” Draco was shocked. Where had that come from? Had Lucius had all this pent-up dating advice and was letting it free when Draco needed it the most? “But I don’t think he likes me and I don’t even know if I like him anymore. It’s all in this weird limbo.”
“I have my ways,” he reminded his friend and stole a hug from him. “Happy birthday.”
Draco grimaced. “Well.”
Harry pushed off Draco’s shirt from his shoulders, letting it fall to the ground in a heap while his hands and eyes admired his trim waist. “So beautiful,” Harry whispered, and Draco felt his cheeks go pink.
Someone a couple rows back in the audience let out a loud “aw!”.
“It’s not my fault that you really filled out your jeans since I last saw you! I swear, it was like you went in a cocoon and came out a regular Adonis.”
“Both,” Draco mused aloud. “Okay, we can do both.”
Well, if Draco wasn’t worried enough already for that night, his mother’s comment did him in.
“What?”
Those would have to go, too.
Theo at least got an obnoxious laugh out of that one. “They’re a tough crowd,” he nodded understandingly to Harry. At least one of Draco’s friends wasn’t completely insane. “But you survived Lucius’ warnings and will probably survive his inspection later tonight when we come home, so I think you can deal with these liquored up twats.”
“Do you like it?”
Yet when she approached the table, she had no idea who to hand to the check to. How did that work with two men? Thankfully, the blonde one snatched up the check before she could stand there a minute longer as a clueless heterosexual.
The young man looked up, caught between trembling in fear and in anger. “What do you mean, ‘who even is this’? It’s me!”
“Yes,” Draco said, eyes rolled back in ecstasy. “Yes, yes—come in me, love.”
“And your shoulders,” Harry continued, pressing his palms flat against them. “They were made to wear robes and cloaks.”
“I mean it,” Harry pushed on. “They were idiots when they gave up on you, they were idiots when they were unfaithful, and they were idiots when they didn’t treat you the way you deserve to be treated.”
Ruth didn’t get her wish. It took another fifteen minutes of fidgeting at the table for a man in the crowd of New Yorkers relaxing in the park to reveal himself.
“No, no, I’m fine,” Kingsley amended quickly. “I just wanted to ask how you are doing. How you and Harry are doing.”
It made Draco all the more proud. He smiled, stopping the song and gently curling closer so as not to wake him with the embrace. He’d just sung Harry Potter to sleep, and Draco was starting to feel the tug of rest on his eyelids as well.
Draco had never disappointed before, so Harry did what he was told in spite of his throbbing need.
“Oh, Harry, I think this is the beginning of something beautiful, don’t you?” Draco prompted because he wanted to hear it back, now holding both of Harry’s hands again.
This time Lucius and Narcissa were in the foyer waiting for them expectantly. This left the pair of men no more opportunities to prepare or collect themselves. It was showtime.
“What?” he asked. Blaise always did put in a noble effort to play it off as an accidental glance.
The library was perfectly silent when Draco entered with no students to occupy it. Draco immediately sent for seven books, each one a textbook for each year of classes. The textbooks were recently purchased, so none of that ‘finding an ancient diary of a war criminal’ nonsense would be going down this year.
“It might not be magic,” Harry supposed. “It could just be a little camera.”
“Thanks. Draco picked it out,” Harry admitted and looked back to his boyfriend—his boyfriend! Still excited about that one even though the word no longer felt like enough to describe what Draco had done for him in turning his life around. “I know you’ve already met, but I figured I should reintroduce you. This is Draco Malfoy, and he and I are… going steady.” He phrased it in a way he hoped Molly would understand and also distract from the fact that Skeeter had revealed to the world how rough these two ‘steady’ boys liked it.
The next crack of the flogger tails was even harder, and Draco was sure to bring it down across his nipples. “Good boy,” he murmured as he watched Harry arch up into the blow. “I’m going to mark you all up.”
The Wizarding World viewed him as their collective orphan child hero, and Harry flat-out refused to engage with complete strangers as if their advice was an authority for him, asking all the questions Molly asked of Ron. That was Harry’s only real look at parenting beyond how Vernon and Petunia had treated Dudley. Andromeda was doing well with Teddy, as she’d done with Tonks, but that was distant and sometimes too upsetting to face.
“Yes?” Harry looked back up to Draco expectantly, immediately internally rebuking himself for looking so dopey.
Yeah, well, how discrete would this man be if he realized an ex-Death Eater was contacting him? Draco could see the Prophet headlines now—
A chill went up Harry’s spine even though it wasn’t cold. Here on his couch he was wrapped in a nest of blankets and pillows, empty snack bags littered across the coffee table in front of him. Harry brushed crumbs off of his lap and stood weakly.
The episode brought back memories of Ruth and her ‘male model’ disappointment.
“Forever?”
And as the clock on the wall counted down the last minutes of his birthday, Draco knew this was the best one yet.
“Do you have a bathroom?”
“That’s all the more reason to help him. Wesley could be in danger and maybe Vera needs some kind of professional help that we can secure through the network. Maybe she just needs to talk to someone,” offered Harry.
“Oh. Well. Isn’t that a joy.”
“No, no, that’s not what you’re here for. Don’t be ridiculous.”
Draco paled. “You went through my things when I was at Hogwarts?!”
“And you should totally see the spanking room,” Pansy urged, a combination of words Harry had never expected to hear out of anyone in a party setting, or ever. “Oh, wait! Let me introduce you three,” Pansy went on almost in the same breath from how thrilled she was. She tugged on her leashes and the two submissives walked forward and bowed in sync. “These are my subs.” As if it had not been obvious. Harry waited for her to elaborate but she didn’t, and neither submissive opened their mouths.
xxxxXXXXxxxx
“That’s not the voice I hear on the phone,” Lorraine insisted.
Harry crossed his arms. “Don’t be so difficult, Draco. It’s your turn fair and square.” God, Draco could be so fucking annoying.
Draco was glad for whatever resistance his small blue face mask offered him, because there was also about a teaspoon of stomach acid that came with it. At least it hadn’t been a tablespoon.
When Draco began bobbing his head Harry knew he was a goner. Every wet noise, every smack of his lips was the filthiest, most beautiful symphony he’d ever heard. “Draco,” Harry cried out, hands loosely clinging to his hair now so that the blonde could go at his own pace—which seemed to be fast to begin with. “D-Daddy,” he tried next, heat swirling in his stomach. It felt so right to say, but still held so much shame for Harry.
Hermione gave him a look, curious with how they were going about all of this. “And what exactly constitutes as ‘not ready’ for adoption?” she asked. Whatever it was, Hermione hoped they could spot it.
Harry’s eyes were saucers. “
“The person I am seeing is… Harry Potter.”
“Pretty much,” Harry nodded. He’d taken a seat on the bench outside of the interrogation room and Draco had taken to rubbing his back soothingly.
It wasn’t the magic itself that made World of Warcraft so great. Sure, it was fun and had one hell of a plotline, but that wasn’t all there was to it. Harry could run the Black Temple raid all on his own. He was level 90 and he didn’t need to have Draco there to take down Illidan, but he wanted to have him there.
“Then you’ll just have to help me out of it.”
Draco was an adorable baby, too.
“Lucius,” Charlie stated, shocked.
Draco spread Harry’s cheeks with a grin. “Yes, that’s right. Keep thanking me and you’ll keep getting more. I love a grateful whore.” He got up on his knees behind Harry, slipping in two lubricated digits with some effort. “Come on, what do we say?”
suspecting us? Oh, Draco, that’s awful! We would never—!”
—of course I did not plan this! Why in the hell would
“Was that the bloke’s name?” Ron asked absentmindedly. “Muggles are so great.”
Before he could scream out a ‘Yes! Finally!’, the waitress with the shirt malfunction dropped a copy of the Daily Prophet (hot off the presses) in between them, as the diner liked to pride themselves on. Keeping people full of food and information, they said, ignoring the fact that The Prophet wasn’t too keen on facts.
“I’m so in love with you,” Draco marveled, still rubbing the bulge in his crotch. “I can’t stop thinking about you, you’re my every thought. Kissing you, holding you, sucking you off, that’s the only church I need.”
victory?”
Grace shrugged. “If I was a burglar, it would have worked perfectly.”
At first it had been fun. They’d narrowed down the mother’s age and location to wind up with a thousand applicants, so they got to comb through all the pregnant women of London. Some of the testimonials as to why there were giving up their child were funny, some sad, and some both. But five-hundred women later, Harry’s head was spinning.
Draco could care less if he and Harry weren’t the ones pushing out the baby. Draco Malfoy-Potter never passed up the opportunity to host a cocktail party. Never. Such a thought made him pale with worry and would surely give him wrinkles at a young age.
, I know my hair best!” Draco declared dramatically. “I already know gel doesn’t work—I don’t care how fancy your products are!”
Harry snorted. “I’m happy I managed to turn out this humble with you around.”
“Where are you going?”
“I think in some sick way, both Kingsley and we got what we wanted,” Harry pondered aloud.
Wow, Harry had forgotten they were there between Ruth’s talk of Chris and Draco’s… Well. Harry didn’t quite know what that moment was. Draco was objectively attractive so it was probably just a moment of quiet admiration, or at least that was what he told himself.
“We’re men. Men often have worse intentions than lesbians,” Draco told her curtly. “And you really can’t trust anyone but lesbians, so—“
Harry hadn’t had a clue what conversation had gone on in his parlor, which was greatly in Blaise’s favor. Harry would deck the fucker who cheated on his friend.
Could panic attacks stem from boredom?
“Any shocking cases of intrigue? I was hoping for a happy-ending massage parlor bust this week.” His addiction to drama was insatiable, and he had his suspicions about the ‘Healing Touch’ spa near Colin’s studio.
Instead of answering his husband, Harry turned to Grace. The next question would sort of say it all anyway. “Do you still have feelings for him?”
Draco, one hand wrapped around Harry, used his free hand to grab the bottle of lube he kept under the couch. He and Harry had bought it together when Draco ran out of his usual brand, and that had been one hell of a day.
Harry shot up immediately in his seat. “Right, right,” he nodded and clicked the seatbelt off before hopping out of the car and onto a gravel driveway. Compared to some of the small apartments of previous Catfish ‘victims’, this house was beautiful and roomy.
“Waiting,” Draco replied impatiently.
In return Harry locked his legs around Draco, refusing to let him go. “Happy,” Harry said, rocking their hips together still to ride out their orgasms to nothing. “Happy birthday, my love.”
Zeke paused to lean back in the opulent chair of Narcissa’s parlor. He chose his next words carefully. “I think maybe part of that anger is that you lost your mum so early.” Grace froze up, breath catching in her throat. “And I don’t know how it could affect this kid to never know their biological parents. It’s not because Draco and Harry are gay, it’s not because I want to have us both stop our lives and be teen parents, and it’s definitely not because I ‘hate you’. I don’t hate you, Grace. I want the best for this kid and this is me stepping up.”
“You’ve met him before. He’s from school, Hogwarts,” Draco specified as if there were another school they almost all died at. Hogwarts began as the best of times for young, spoiled Draco but had ended in terror. Sheer, naked terror for his life, for the lives of his parents and the fate of this world.
“Hands out.”
With a heavy heart, he watched Harry shuffle out of the room to send a letter to his husband. In that moment, he decided that as Harry’s best friend, he should have probably made more of an effort to get along with Draco’s best friend.
“We can’t ‘just apparate in’, Healer Malfoy,” his boss snarled at him on the other side of a London taxicab. “This process has a strict protocol.”
Much to Ron’s chagrin, they were going in blind.
Since the situation had been broken down for Dudley without too much resistance, Draco considered himself the victor in the encounter. “Your kid is fine,” he reminded Dudley gruffly. “So I’ll be on my way.”
“Shut up,” Harry snarled anyway. “This is about you and—how many other women? Fuck, this is insane.”
“Prove it!”
She’d climbed her way to one of the jagged stones that the mayor of London said would ‘add to the artistic appeal of the park’ and sat down to try and skip stones. Grace had failed miserably at this, which only made her angrier.
Hermione ate her food in a rather aggressive manner when she was angry. She plunged the naan into the masala sauce with a roaring strength and ripped a piece off of it with her mouth. “And what makes a pureblood baby worth more than one that isn’t?”
Harry had to make sure this case was worth pursuing not only for his and Draco’s amusement, but the amusement of an audience. There was no way the audience would believe Macklemore was dating a random woman online, so he needed more if Lorraine’s case was going to be aired on MTV. “You have to know how unlikely that is,” Harry tried slowly, elbowing a cackling Draco out of the frame.
“Perfect! I was thinking a Midnight in Paris theme.”
The silence was more tense than usual.
Fucking Draco. He was bothered by the taste of mint and was irate when servicepeople attempted to give him water in a Styrofoam cup, but personal space was a nonissue with him. Harry would never understand that.
Training. If Draco was going to train him, and oh how Harry hoped he did so roughly, then Harry was also going to train himself. Mind, body, and more on Harry needed at least a quarter of the discipline he’d given it when he thought the world was ending.
“Rude,” one of her fellow posse members mumbled.
“Yes, I’ll be doing that soon. Such an impatient whore.” Draco pinched Harry’s thigh and smiled fondly at how red the mark turned. While his two fingers worked Harry’s walls open Draco was imagining what it would be like for his cock to be hugged by such wet heat. “You’ll get my come soon enough like this.”
“Right,” he laughed. Most people by the end of that month could say the same thing, but Draco did it unabashedly as if he were the only one to ever accomplish a successful Throne of Thunder raid.
Draco rolled his eyes. “We’ll see about that after tonight,” he said before opening the door. He was just about to shut it behind himself when Draco thought of a last minute dig. “And you have a man-child.”
!” Draco’s voice rose in volume and intensity. “The skeptic and the believer trope. I can’t believe I didn’t see it before! He’s made us Mulder and Scully, chasing down freaks and oddities to the ends of the country!”
Draco was surer than ever that their current case involved the work of not one but two Catfish(es?), swapping off this man between one another for laughs. The typing styles were different and both typing styles had told Henry different lies about why they couldn’t meet.
Harry couldn’t see the sense in that at all, but he was satisfied that he would have something to turn in to Trelawney at the end of the hour. “What about my other ones?”
Pye’s petrified eyes burned in Draco’s direction. He knew what he was saying, that Draco was no war hero just because he was shacking up with one. But the insult burned a little less knowing that the Malfoy lawyers were about to take everything this man owned.
Narcissa was smiling, at least. “It’s so good to see you, Draco. And you as well, Harry,” she said, moving forward and embracing them both with an arm each. Draco hugged her back, making tense eye contact with Lucius over her shoulder as he did. “Please, welcome, make yourself at home.”
“They’re usually written on the invitation. Collared submissives that are spoken for aren’t to be spoken to by other Dominants,” Ginny recounted. When Harry realized that meant him he went an even deeper shade of red. “Oh, I’m sorry, Harry! Am I making you uncomfortable?”
“We should film our reactions,” Harry said with no intention of getting up to do that. “I need to gloat about this guy not being a Catfish.”
“Uh, like a week and a half ago? Look, I’ve been busy with the case—“
“You could be partially employed here if you wanted, Harry. In any capacity you wanted. I think you’d make an incredible essayist on the subject matter,” Ginny insisted.
“So he’s the father?”
He could see Harry bolting up in spite of his current state of borderline muscle paralysis and grabbing a towel, a blanket, a jacket, anything to get himself clean before running up the stairs to the nursery.
“I mean,” Harry quickly course-corrected. Had he just gotten himself in trouble with his boyfriend and his best friends at once? New record. “Only if you wanted to, Draco. And only if I could, Hermione, Ron.”
“Draco is a part of my life, and so are you two. If I have to keep those parts separate I’ll be disappointed, but I’ll deal. He’s willing to meet with you, you know.”
Draco considered this and many other such important matters as the day went on. Lunch in the teacher’s lounge was tame and Potter-less with a far-too-long conversation with Trelawney about fate bringing him back to the castle or whatever, and then it was back to the library for Draco.
“It’s not just the mother. We look at the father’s profiles, as well. Some of these women have sperm donors from the national bank, and the men who donate are the cream of the crop.” Ew. “High IQs, tall, thin, and pureblood.”
Draco, on the other hand, was fully prepared to hex the mood and all the Dursleys if necessary. “Those bastards,” he hissed. “Stifling your magic and your sexual orientation—and forcing you to work for them!”
“So bossy,” Draco chastised with a smile before his hands clasped Harry’s ankles so that he could pull his legs up to go deeper with each thrust. His hips worked double-time, pushing into Harry so that he could hit his prostate dead-on.
“Theo is a better man than you,” Harry went on, this time with less desperation. “And he’s so gay. Merlin’s beard, he’s gay. Gayer than me. Gayer than Draco.”
Draco shrugged. “A little.”
Pye narrowed his eyes. “You know what about.” He sighed, shaking his head. “A lot of people stuck their necks out for you to even have this position, you know. Your kind wasn’t welcome here, not after we’d seen the damage you people did during the War.”
People lunged at him. They yelled nonsense about prophecy or hatred or ‘fated’ love that was really obsession. It was all to bait Harry into saying something in return to satisfy them. It had been worse right after the war, when everyone was speculating ‘what he was going to do next’. Harry had just wanted to fucking sleep.
“One,” Draco insisted for naught. He shook his head and cracked a smile, and so did Pansy. “Have a good weekend, Panda.”
“Draco,” Harry said as he embraced Draco and kissed his cheek. “You got the letter?”
Blaise was a sleaze, but he could also be understanding and supportive. When Ginny really needed him, he was there. In other words, he wasn’t decidedly The One (as of yet), but there was no reason to upset a caring relationship with a sweet man.
“It’s Suzy,” Dudley murmured, realizing that he had annoyed his cousin enough with his presence. “She, uh. A couple weeks ago, she made the house flood with cookies. And I mean
“Then in the end, five thousand nine hundred ninety-nine children aren’t yours, whichever way you slice it,” Dr. Hart murmured. “I’ve seen couples disagree on matter like this quite a bit. I’m no purist, but fighting for equal opportunity doesn’t have much of a place in a business like this.”
Oh, for fuck’s sake. Some underclassman girl with bottle-blonde hair was sitting in front of it eating with her group of friends. “Move,” Draco commanded.
!” Draco yelled down at the blur of white. “You horrid rats, I’ll hex you twelve ways into next week!”
“Great!”
Emmett shook hands with the both of them quickly while Alvaro looked to him imploringly. “Well?” he asked Emmett.
Pansy skittered off into the women’s locker room thankfully quickly. Draco and Maggie were close to letting their laughter boil over. “Did you see the look on her face? I think she just pissed herself.”
The Malfoy matriarch held back a laugh. If Sirius didn’t watch it, he would become her favorite blood relative. “Then I think it’s time for us to go, too,” she said as her arm wrapped around Lucius’.
His phone guided him to the nearest one, a hole-in-the-wall named The Pleasure Chest. Ignoring what store exactly the bags Harry carried were from he looked like an important, big spender the second he walked into the mirror-walled establishment.
Would he? Harry honestly didn’t know the answer himself. If this Dragonis really was some other lost London teenager, then he’d surely give it a shot. If he hadn’t been lying, if all of what he’d told Harry had been real—then he would be glad to.
Mutely, briefly, Harry wished his parents could be there with him. Grandma and Grandpa to a brand new Lily, though they probably wouldn’t have named her that if the original Lily wasn’t dead.
“We need to get this off of our minds. Benjy wouldn’t want it to kill us,” he murmured against one of Remus’ scars.
“And what of you, then, Potter? Have you ‘chosen’ my son?” Lucius questioned.
Harry cleared his throat. He and Draco really seemed to be getting to know each other well if he could predict what Harry was going to say. “Well.”
Harry nodded, having resolved long ago to go on with whatever kind of treatment Draco recommended once his true thoughts on the matter of his life came to light. That, and he’d suspected Draco was going to contact her anyway about the hair pulling. They’d talked about getting it under control during his training, and it had been mortifying, so he’d been sparing Harry a little while.
Draco had gone entirely limp, the aromatic candles of rose and lavender shades calming him further. He was putty in Harry’s capable hands.
“Anyway, if they say anything sideways I’ll—I’ll—“ Draco couldn’t say he’d hex these muggles because that was unusually cruel and a violation of the Statute of Secrecy. So what could he do? The only punch he’d ever thrown in his life was getting one in on a paralyzed Harry who couldn’t even fight back.
“Are you missing the part where we wanked off together?”
I’m sorry I haven’t updated in forever, these chapters are a lot longer than I usually write but I don’t want to break them up into tinier installments. Anyway, it’s about time these boys started to warm up to one another, hm? This is for Antonia because we are apparently the only sane lesbians left in New Jersey and more often than not Catfish takes a trip down the lesbian rabbit hole. TW for homophobic slurs.
“Priss,” Harry accused Draco blamelessly.
Draco took a moment as if he were considering it. “Yes, you may.”
There was no easy way to describe what had happened. Plagued by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and stuck with memories of a war Harry had never wanted to fight in, Harry woke up screaming.
“My husband got it as a gift from his last business trip from India,” explained the mother.
The Headmistress gave Jeremiah a handshake and breathed a sigh of relief. That was the last of them. Another successful class. No drop-outs, no (massive) scandals, no new wars, Slytherins and Gryffindors had begun to end their squabbling, and McGonagall hadn’t so much as heard a rumor of parent complaints this year. These young minds were out of her hands now, and hopefully on their way to success. Hopefully.
“What is it?” Harry asked, trying to peek across the table at the card.
Blaise and Ginny had laid down some ground rules, after all.
Theo knew that, but a day with his estranged father had scrambled his brain. “Still.”
“I know why you’re here,” she snarled. Her eyes looked different without mascara and a pound of eyeshadow; they looked sallower. “It’s about one of your Dumbledore’s Army friends.”
He hated that since their son was fucking The Chosen One that they had gotten out of jail. Sure, their relationship technically started three years after Harry defended the Malfoy family in court, but those two pillowbiters probably had the hots for each other for much longer and much earlier than that.
Pansy saw the owl trying to get into Maggie’s kitchen window, so Pansy stuck her hand out of the bedroom one and snapped to get the things attention. It was onyx black, which could only mean one person.
The Dursleys had only taken him to the doctor once in his life, and that was when he had a broken arm.
“Sir.”
He certainly didn’t have to ask Remus twice. Remus pressed the tip of his wand up to light a small, simmering flame to get the smoke to puff up around them.
Draco’s mouth tried to form words. “Grace, Harry and I need to talk about this, this is sudden, and you’re not in the best place emotionally—“
“Room of Requirement, empty dorms, abandoned classrooms, prefect’s bathroom…”
Ron didn’t want to go back to death and decay when he had his family. “An hour,” he lied. “Which is just enough time for me to make you lunch.”
“And watching this muggle ‘video’ of your progress will show me…?” Lucius questioned, droll as ever.
“Is there a night where I don’t rant about consent and misogyny?”
“Touché.”
“I know! I know
Well, working together on live television while unaware that Harry and Draco had meticulously planned for something to go wrong. Harry bit his lip and hoped none of the backstage crew would get the blame.
“Yes, Pye?” Draco asked as if nothing was wrong at all.
“I’m using my laptop this time. Yours is slow as hell,” Draco decided. The door to their room was sealed behind them and while no cameras were currently on, the sooner they shot themselves picking the next Catfish the sooner they could get in a plane and continue to not speak to each other.
“I’ll be back,” Ron reminded him.
Luna offered him a gentle smile. “I forgave you a long time ago, Draco. It is nice to hear an apology aloud though, so thank you for that.
“Thank you, Daddy, thank you for your perfect cock.”
“Draco, turn that thing off.”
The window into the room was smeared with blood. The table had toppled over and one of the chairs had snapped in two while the other remained firmly embedded in the brick wall. A crumpled man was still chained to the table, too.
When his mum tried to show him a picture of himself as a baby, Zeke had fled to his room. When the telly advertised new inventions in baby bowls that wouldn’t tip over, Zeke switched the channel to cartoons just to drown out the idea of children.
“Really, Blaise? You’re gonna call it ‘gay’?”
He headed for hair and makeup, guided mostly by Draco’s voice.
“And look at all the thanks I get for it,” Harry grumbled. “At least your magazine sales are up. Your articles and photography sections, high-quality stuff.”
When Draco was gone Harry was left to mope in bed for a customary hour. He would have went right to working on the greenhouse again, but there was something he needed to tend to first inside beyond wilting without Draco.
He was getting too far ahead of himself.
That was when Harry, wand sliding up and out of his pants pocket, pointed outwards. There was that feeling in the air again, that electricity that spiked when Harry had been surprised by the Aurors raiding the Manor. Pure, unbridled anger rolled off of him. These two were the reason they were a national laughingstock. He could care less who the younger one was, because they were both about to be in a world of hurt.
As Draco’s grip tightened Harry’s heart soared to be told he was doing well, doing good. The world and the corners of Harry’s mind had so much bad that he’d do just about anything to feel good. Lucky him he’d found someone to do it with. “I love how it feels,” Harry rambled on, far past caring what he sounded like. “When it drips out of me.”
“It’s the truth,” Harry stuck to it, mouth hovering over Draco’s stomach. He gave the skin above Draco’s waistband several kisses before moving even further down. “You’re so handsome—how is one person allowed to be so handsome?”
“You are so baby-crazy,” Draco sighed fondly before helping him stand. He gave Harry’s cheek a kiss as he walked him down to Hermione’s room. If they weren’t expecting a kid soon, Draco suspected Harry would be inclined to snatch little Hugo right up.
Ron, flabbergasted in every sense of the word, let out a breath. “Harry, you just told me you’ve considered suicide, how am I supposed to leave you here? I’m—I’m supposed to be your best friend! You’re supposed to tell me things! I—I can’t believe…”
Draco paused to weigh his options. “I could tell them we met again in that bar we went to and it wouldn’t technically be a lie.” It wasn’t as if Draco could say he was searching for sugarbabies to fill the Manor up with and Harry just happened to be the perfect submissive for the job. “I was sitting at the bar when who approaches me but Harry Potter.”
People around them were starting to stare, but most of the gamers were absorbed in the words on their screens with headphones plugging up their ears and protecting them from the real world where two boys who thought they’d had something special were pointing fingers at one another.
“You like this?” Draco moved his hands up in an act of mercy, this time bringing his hands down on the globes of Harry’s arse. A red trail was developing up Harry’s legs that made Draco lick his lips.
“Don’t you talk back to me! To your room!”
Draco gritted his teeth. “Thank you,” he said as courteously as he could manage before returning to the streets of London on his quest for the prodigal daughter. He hoped Harry would appreciate Draco’s bragging about being so nice to strangers when they met after this shitstorm.
“Yeah,” said Draco because magic was always more beautiful next to Harry.
Harry let out a breath of relief. He really wasn’t sure how that would go. “Thanks,” Harry said. “Really, thanks.”
“For your information, no. I have my entire career path planned,” Draco boasted.
“You love to be mine? Oh, Harry, what a romantic you are when you’ve got cock up your arse,” Draco teased, giving a few particularly hard pumps where their skin slapped together. “Tell me more. I want to hear it all, how does it feel?”
“You’re mad,” Harry said fondly before kissing him again, the ice cream from his lips smearing on Draco’s cheek. “But I love the nursery idea. The only trouble will be assembling it.”
Draco’s strokes of his tongue grew longer and more languid, lapping at the edges of his hole before finally circling around it and licking over it. Rimming Harry was pure bliss in any scenario, but having his face well up Harry’s skirts was another feeling entirely. Everything was black lace and tan skin, driving Draco deeper and deeper.
“Wait, wait, wait,” Harry stopped their bickering. “Why are you here and what do you want from us?”
It was sudden.
At least that wasn’t a dead person’s name. “Hm. That sounds admittedly better.”
“They’re here,” Draco whispered with a joking tone of ominousness.
Ron nodded before asking the obvious question. “Are you okay?”
Draco laughed breathily. “I love you too.” And he was finally able to say it liberally.
“Actually,” she told him. “He was the one who dumped me.”
Wow, uh, three years later? I promise I actually had this planned but then lapsed into suddenly hating the story and Fearing writing for it. Paranoia aside I’m glad to bring you the final chapter. Every time I watch Catfish I think of this stupid fic, and everyone whose read it has been really indulgent of me in doing so. Like, objectively, ‘Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter host MTV Catfish’ is the least structurally sound idea I’ve ever had and so many of you still read it. Thanks, everyone. Don’t know where I’d be without you.
Headmistress Minerva McGonagall got up and began her speech.
With a burning face Harry looked bashfully away. Face twisting slightly, Draco pinched his thigh. “Ow!”
Harry rolled his eyes. “If you don’t see a doctor here then you’re going to get me sick, and you know we can get back on a plane to New Hope with you like this,” he sighed.
Harry summoned that mischievous eleven year-old self’s sneakiness and guile, slowing creeping across the room.
“Goodnight, Draco,” Harry whispered in return. He was only a little frustrated that he needed to spend a night alone when he was always alone. Still, he didn’t dare question the method since Draco sounded like he was giving Harry a gift to be able to do this when he announced it over lunch.
With a quiet sigh Harry curled up on his side and imagined it was really happening. He felt the other man’s warm hands against his skin, and imagined the blankets in his bed to be infinitely softer than his own.
With a laugh, Draco shook his head. “You’re a complete madman, but mission accomplished I suppose.” He squeezed Harry’s hand in his under the street lamp. Nobody seemed to be on that quiet corner of the city that night but the two of them in their circle of light.
Draco didn’t even want to know what Harry had told him about the adoption. That man was in for a stern talking-to when he got home. “Your kid will never force my little girl to shun her magic like you did to Harry. And my daughter will have way more Christmas presents.”
If Ruth was bothered by it, though, she didn’t show it. The second the airplane touched the ground her eyes were as big as saucers. Anyone who looked in them could see the city lights as the sun began to set.
of 2008, his first year as a teacher coming fast in the next few days.
“…Daddy?” Harry whispered after awhile.
With a shiver down his body Harry pushed down on Draco’s fingers, lowering himself further on the armchair. “That’s my boy,” Draco soothed, running his free hand through Harry’s messy hair.
Theo shrugged. “I can live with that,” he decided.
“Draco Malfoy likes control,” Harry said, pretending to be surprised. “I really ought to be taking notes here lest I forget that one.”
“You think being high would make someone more interesting,” Maggie sighed before sending the patient off with his furious parents trailing behind him.
Without even responding, Draco snapped it down again and again and again. He fixated on every inch of Harry to make sure he was absolutely writhing. The flogger reddened the head of Harry’s leaking cock, his shaft, his quivering thighs…
SMUT TIME
“Just do it. ‘Brooke’ is lying.” Draco lay on his stomach, camera pointed at the screen. The hotel room they’d been given this time around in Ohio was nice but had considerably less room. No desk, no lounge chairs. The room was bare except for two beds, a dresser, and an old television.
She squeezed his hand and released it so Draco could take it once more. “Be safe, you two. I shall get a subscription to this ‘Quibbler’ and look forward to reading it.”
“I know,” Draco lifted his hand, a twinge of annoyance like it wasn’t necessary and softening out of it. Harry hadn’t thought about how it would scar. “And I am grateful for your role in getting me out of Fiendfyre and Azkaban alike, my family included.” He rehearsed the timeline a lot in therapy and could at least speak about it now. That had been one of his first goals, to be able to speak about it without crying or breaking down.
Lifting the cup to Harry’s lips he drank up, needing to stay hydrated not only from their scene but from the alcohol they’d been sipping on earlier. Harry still felt tipsy, though it clearly hadn’t been enough to stop his arousal. If anything it had fueled it.
Harry wanted to argue that he owed Draco the world but he could see where he was coming from. It wasn’t healthy to pin all of one’s hopes and dreams of happiness on one person, but Draco just made it so easy to do when he was the world’s greatest sugar Daddy.
His favorite was Julian Pino who had been known as Miss Marmalade in his stage days. He sold out every night he performed at his local clubs all dolled up in his highest drag to belt out classics and make dirty jokes that made the crowd cheer.
Even when she walked down the street scooping icing out of its container and eating it like ice cream, she felt solitary. Nobody in this side of town knew her. Nobody would judge her for her messy bun, bare face (she never used to even leave the dorm without makeup), or her giant pretentious sunglasses. Hey, they kept the sun out of her eyes.
Colin gave him a shove before telling his own story. “I met this bloke at a bar and we went out on a couple of dates. His name was Harvey, a real unassuming guy to the untrained eye.”
Lorraine thankfully opened the door to disperse whatever lingering awkwardness there was with the two hosts of the show. “Hello. Oh, I didn’t realize the television crew would be here on the first day,” she laughed nervously, shifting on her feet.
That was what he said every time. “Try harder,” Ginny decided. Maybe that was the only thing that could tame his wandering eye.
As they traversed the teething rings aisle and Draco took over, Harry had a moment to think. “If the kid is gay, or bi, or trans, or anything other than binary and straight, the press will think we did something to them.”
There were people who did not wish to forgive, who were not healed with time but instead only grew in resentment. Draco and Harry getting together was an even worse period of hatemail, and the owlery had to shut down temporarily after the announcement of their engagement as even Harry received Howlers then.
As the Bagley sisters swooped in to guide him through the initialing and signing, Narcissa handed the other biscuit to Gerda. “Here, love.”
“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Harry admitted with French toast crumbs on his chin and a sparkle in his eye for the man who’d tucked him in. “I don’t know what I want most of the time, but what I asked for in that magazine hasn’t changed.”
Draco had no idea what to say after Harry told him all of that. What were you supposed to say to something like that? There was no hand-guide for this just like there had been no hand-guide for overcoming the trauma the rest of the war had left behind it.
“’After weeks of her accusing me of cheating on her when I wasn’t, I got sick of it all and broke up with her. Since my birthday was at the beginning of the relationship, I gave her my address to send a card. And I guess now’s a good time to mention we only live an hour’s drive away. I live in south Arizona and she lives in Kansas. After I ended things with her, weird things started happening around my house.”
Above the rabble of the reporters all shouting their new lines of questions at the couple, Draco could be heard saying: “May I have this dance?”
Harry stopped himself there. He sort of had to meet the bloke first before he went on planning weddings and baby showers.
“Hedwig.”
With a plea like that gracing his ears Draco could hardly hold back himself. “Now,” he commanded, and almost instantaneously he felt the warm splash of come on his stomach. The sticky sensation was exactly what he was after, his own peak hitting on the next thrust in.
The flat seemed almost to be glowing and Harry had to blink to adjust to it. White floors and white walls with gold lacquer detailing shone brilliantly under bright, stylish lights hung from the ceiling that looked like dandelion puffs. The windows were covered in white panels with massive fountains in front of them—was that chocolate?
The war still went on when strange old men gave her dirty looks on the street and mouthed ‘mud’. The bastards couldn’t have gotten away with anything more than that, or Hermione wouldn’t look like the crazy one when she called them out.
“I know we’re a bit behind filming schedule, but—“
The rest of their small table filled with every Death Eater from the Carrows to Yaxley.
“I love you too.” Draco Malfoy-Potter wanted to be with that man forever.
“But I don’t want her to have any ‘mistakes’ that involve drugs!”
you.”
xxxxXXXXxxxx
The bird was finally set free out of a sliding glass door, being released into the wild to sort things out with her new harem of men. If Pansy were there, she would have been proud. “What are you naming her?” Harry tried, watching her waddle away to go investigate her boys.
“Owls will be just fine,” Ron sighed. “Now that I actually know where you are…”
The bright side, Draco supposed, was that at age eight he’d finally got another kid in the house to play with. The old money of London took care of their own, and Narcissa hadn’t hesitated to move Theo right in.
Teddy was born of Nymphadora and a muggle man who she never chose to reveal. Her long-unrequited love for the gay Remus Lupin was a persistent tragedy in Nymphadora’s life, just like being called her first name was. But Andromeda stepped up after her death, took in Teddy with a promise to raise him as her daughter would have wanted.
“Thank you!”
Grace hadn’t decided what animal the other Bagley sister resembled.
“Hullo,” she replied, a little surprised Lily had spoken to her. “Seventh year, right?”
Harry pressed on. “We’re looking for his body. Pieces of it, specifically.”
This hotel wasn’t even a chain operation. It wasn’t any form of Hyatt, Hilton, Sheraton, or Marriott or any of their smaller branches, and it didn’t have anywhere near the crowd of one.
Only in books had Hunter read about embarrassment like this. The whole room—first years, seventh years,
“Grace,” Tiff sighed. “You’re lying to your baby daddies.”
That sounded like a big blow to Draco’s self-esteem. All Harry could image was some unworthy bastard feeling Draco up with firewhiskey on his breath. Had that man even known who Draco was? Had that man known that the boy he seduced was underage? Harry held his anger towards this faceless man tightly in his fist before moving on. “Who was your first boyfriend after the war?”
“My sincerest apologies,” Harry said in the most feminine voice he could. It was nice that Ron got how much Harry hated how people treated him differently because of his sexuality. Like he was suddenly expected to be a dress-up doll for girls and a non-threatening sidekick for guys. “So, how’s Rose and Hermione?”
“And what happens when they find out about these lies?”
In a feat of strength, Maggie yanked Pansy back on top of her. “I know. I’m your knight in shining armor.”
“Alright,” Blaise said cheerfully, giving the girl laying between him and Ginny a pat on the back. It felt a little like when Draco used to pat his back after a winning Quidditch game. “That was fun. You should get home while there are still cabs.”
Ron had almost forgotten how powerful Malfoy was, too. Or apparently it was ‘Draco’ now. The first-name basis these two were on was throwing Ron way off of his game. “That’s, er, generous. I have to extend a formal apology.”
Pansy scrambled to make up an excuse. “I know, I was just… Wondering if we could take her to a bar,” she lied. “You know, show her a good time.”
“Yes, it doesn’t taste like much of anything at all.”
“Emmett,” Harry asserted. “This may be the only time.” That wasn’t entirely true, but it would be the only time that they could meet with MTV’s monetary assistance.
Colin laughed. “No, no. It’s not about you two and your scandalous sex life this time. You have to guess what it’s about.”
“Healer Malfoy?!” the voice rang more urgently this time.
Draco perked up rather than shied away from this question, something Lucius had not expected. “It goes well, actually,” Draco was able to answer. “The second floor is coming along nicely. We just finished the library and one of the sitting rooms, and the Greenhouse is almost built so we can start raising plants for the gardens.”
Once Draco was gone it was time to wash up, apparently. The bathroom was in the same blue palette as the guestroom, but there were much beachier accents in here. Shells on the curtains, for soap dishes, on the walls—Harry could even breathe in and smell the ocean from a charmed conch shell resting on the toilet. So many products, too. He didn’t think he was welcome to them, and used the soap sparingly.
“No,” Harry replied firmly, offended that Draco had offered him the out before he said their safe word for this evening in particular: Toad. “I don’t want out. I’m going to do this right with you. We do things on our own schedule.”
“You know what I can’t wait for?”
They stepped through the Floo and were home at last. Quiet, simple home where things made sense to Harry. He let out a breath he was holding, and as soon as he did so Draco’s lips were upon his. “You are the eye of the storm, Harry,” Draco murmured low. “My life is madness, as you’ve seen, and we’re mad, as you probably know.”
The only real sound Harry could hear was the soft, wet parting of Draco’s lips as they closed around his.
“Because that’s the last say he’ll have in this again,” Harry told her. Draco and he had argued about it for hours after the files were laid out in front of them. “Lucius won’t see any of the fifty candidates. Ever. The woman we choose could be one sixteenth wizard, for all I care. We gave Lucius his nod of respect, and now he’ll have to deal with the lack of further involvement.”
“Ten overall?” Draco asked. He liked those numbers.
“Yeah, I guess,” she shrugged. It wasn’t as if she was a deity of morality, but that was crossing a line.
Harry just sort of groaned.
“Well, summer between fourth and fifth year I was really sick of being out of the loop. I snuck into the adult attic section of a bookstore I had to take two buses to get to. I spent three hours alone up there before the shopkeep found me and tossed me out, but that was more than enough time to read. They didn’t have much gay stuff, but they had a lot, and I mean
“I think you’ll find I can be quite Draconian,” Draco chuckled with a flash of sharp teeth. “But you too, hm? Smaller population to select from but still, you ought to have gentleman fans crawling all over for the rest of your days.”
“Yes, right, buy some games and videos,” Draco nodded, not understanding.
Harry marched back up to his room with the bowl in-hand.
“Grilled cheese on Texas Toast,” the room service attendant dictated, handing the plate to Harry. “And a slice of dark chocolate cake.” That was for Draco, of course. According to him it was the dinner of champions.
“Excellent.” Draco stood so he could gather the sheets and comforter up. Once he had a grip on the right side he moved to do exactly as all those who’d tucked him in over the years had done. Draco tucked in the left side and moved to gather the blankets around the feet for extra warmth. Harry’s circulation was poor from how cold his hands had seemed in the evening.
The windows were blacked out and that was a blessing. He entered to a low R&B song, something smooth. The dancefloors were mostly empty, another thing in his favor. Harry was taking in every factor, eyes darting to search for a bar. This place was big—he’d have to go deeper in. The lights were low, a pink glow set over him. Did that make his shirt look weird? No! Focus, focus Potter.
“Thinking…?” Harry tried to follow where Draco was going. Harry tried to read his face but there was something so unsure about his usually-confident Daddy.
“The man whose ad I responded to, the one who is living at the Manor with me now, is someone we know from school.”
“Doesn’t mean I’m not going through with the plan at the reunion show,” Draco retorted.
Harry blinked. “Yes, yes of course I have.”
Draco’s character reappeared in the town he had been questing in before he had queued in the raid-finder. Everyone from casual players to hardcore gamers used the raid-finder to assemble random groups of twenty-five that would work together to conquer a common enemy.
“Um, we have one thousand three hundred applicants.”
Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder and pursed his lips. They’d vowed to keep each other happy along with compromise on issues, but this felt too wrong. He cared for Draco, his mental wellbeing, and sometimes even his family, but it was true.
Smoothing out her sheets, she offered Harry and Draco a couple of spots at the end of her bed while she sat at the head of it. “Ask away.” The sooner they got all of the song and dance of the television show over the sooner she could see Brooke.
“Hey.” Draco tilted his head back up, fixing his glasses once more. “Look at me.” Draco kept Harry’s eyes looking right at how his fat cock poked out from behind the panty line by hooking two fingers in his mouth. “Now suck on them.”
Carefully, Harry searched for an upside to that. “It wasn’t your fault, at least,” he tried.
“My wife and I made every last dish,” Lucius boasted, but not having touched his utensils yet. In fact, no one had, so Harry kept his hands in his lap.
Mrs. Bowen took a deep breath and held it before going in.
Was that just the sleep talking, or…? “Really?” Colin asked.
Harry half-expected steam to come out of Kingsley’s nostrils. He looked furious, his fiancée’s face buried in his jacket. Behind them, credits rolled.
“Are you more into leather or rubber, Harry?” Ginny questioned with the casualness of someone asking if he preferred cake or pie.
Harry snickered and kissed him through their smiles.
“A blob of people in the world who are indistinguishable from other tolerant human beings. I have to call hotels ahead of time and say ‘yes, we’re two men and yes, we’ll have one bed’, and worry about whether or not they’ll let us go at all. People stare when we walk arm-in-arm. Waiters in restaurants have seen us holding hands and asked us to leave. When Draco came out to his father, they didn’t even speak for months. I feel guilty, okay? I feel guilty that I’m the one causing him problems,” he finished. Harry loved Draco too much to forgive himself for the trouble Draco had gone through.
His thumbs flew to the keys. This was really happening. Harry was really meeting a bloke he liked and who could snog him during the loading screens when he logged on to World of Warcraft.
Draco put the file on the pile of women that made it past the preliminary sweep.
“Don’t tell me what to do,” she mumbled, resigned. Maybe it was a mood swing, but that didn’t make her exhaustion any less real.
“That’s one hell of a ring, too,” Harry said as he gingerly lifted Colin’s hand up to get a better look. “When did he propose?”
Draco winced slightly as if expecting an explosion. Instead there was a long silence.
Draco slid all three fingers out at once. “That’s right.”
Their knuckles brushed together between them as they walked, and Harry wondered if that meant they were supposed to hold hands. Much to his own disgust, he wanted to hold Draco Malfoy’s hand. Draco had thrown his money around and given Harry that cocky smile and all it made Harry want to do was hold his hand.
Those cuffs and the ones on his ankles made Theo feel safe. Protected, at the least.
“You think I’m pretty, Daddy?” Harry asked, swallowing.
Behind them two more people entered the venue. Ginny had to go attend to them, get stamps on their hands, and left the rest of the introduction of the party to Pansy. The hostesses worked well together for once having been bitter enemies. How much the two Hufflepuffs had contributed was also likely a factor.
“That’s morbid, father,” Draco said flatly. “Why is it him leaving me in this scenario, hm?”
Harry squeezed back. “Being outed is never easy, I guess. I have always dealt with the press stalking me but this is a new low, Luna. This is something nobody was meant to see but Draco and I. This was private.”
“Draco, you’ve got to come see this!” Pansy shouted from one of the other rooms. “They installed a new swing in here!”
“I don’t know if this is the best time.”
The Bagley sisters had built a rather tough wall of legal documentation to break down. At least, that was what the lawyer Zeke spoke to said.
“I want to call him Uncle Draco!” said Louis, who just wanted to do what his sisters did.
It was easier that way. “I’m going to head up to my room, I think. Watch some telly. If I write any longer I’ll get a cramp like I’m taking the OWLs or something.”
“I’m just—I’m looking for a starter kit,” Harry admitted. “Something classic-looking, if you can.”
“This cock of yours will do quite nicely,” Draco approved. A small bead of precome had formed on the head of it, and swelled as Draco spoke. “Ready, willing, and thick,” Draco went on, hand reaching out to give it a few preliminary strokes from base to tip.
“You’re cynical.”
“Yes you do. Dig deeper,” she coached him and Harry almost felt his skin tingle. What kind of platonic mind-domination could go on between a bisexual woman and a gay man? “What did you always hope Santa would bring for Christmas?”
Draco, thinking there was an intruder attacking, rushed to his aid with wand in-hand. After the war he’d gone through his own trials and tribulations in being an ex-Death Eater. People vandalized wherever he lived, threw insults at him in the streets, and a few extreme cases involved attacks in darkened alleys.
Harry let out a slow hiss of air. McGonagall would never tolerate a fight in her study hall but that didn’t stop Harry from wanting to start one.
Harry whistled lowly. Their MTV inbox was near full. “Okay, I’m just going to read these rapid-fire. ‘I’m in love with a stranger’, ‘I need to meet this woman’, ‘Homophobia keeping us apart’, ‘Not enough funds to meet’—“
After fourth year the nightmares about Cedric became unbearable. He would mutter his name in his sleep, his older and deeply unrealistic crush who had been killed right in front of him, and Dudley would tell all his crew his cousin was having gay wet dreams right in his house—how disgusting! Harry would weep for hours and then in his sleep about the things they would say, too. Kids could be so cruel.
Harry hummed, letting his eyes flutter shut in the comfort of their home. They would be safe here, far from prying eyes and homophobic postal maniacs.
“I am twisting it.”
“Take me,” Draco whispered.
The school transformed into a massive current of moving students like fish swarming a lake. They were well-enough into the year to know where all their classes were, and they were smart enough to know not to show up late in a strict school like Ghat Rows, named for the proximity to the Thames and the famous steps that led down to the opening of the river.
Downstairs was a young woman who was also invested in their future as a couple.
“Some texts are personal, that’s all!” she defended. “Very personal, if you catch my drift.”
Harry thrust up faster, harder, bouncing Draco on his lap. “Draco,” Harry replied, voice climbing in volume. Draco was giving as good as he got, driving Harry absolutely up the wall.
Harry cut him off with a little snort. “I think I know a thing or two about that, yes.”
Slowly, he moved his lubricated fingers in and out, his own arousal stirring when he saw the way Harry’s body relaxed around him and accepted the intrusion intuitively. That body belonged to Draco, and he knew it then more than ever.
Next came the challenging part.
He hated that feeling. He swallowed it deeper as they welcomed Ruth to the stage.
This young wizard-in-training dashed to the scene of the damsel in distress. After all, he had promised to do right in the future! Here he was, saving an innocent woman from some peril—
“And there was no note with it,” Harry continued, trying to avoid eye-contact. He didn’t want to be the one to disappoint Draco, but it seemed he had to be. “So we have no idea where the skull is.”
Ron nodded, following him without really believing him. They’d just have to be careful, he supposed.
Faces of classmates passed them by—Justin, Blaise, Susan, Daphne—as they worked their way to the center. Draco seemed to have an effortless grace that let him slide through people without bumping elbows or tripping over their shoes, a sort of grace that Harry was just glad to ride on the coattails of.
Narcissa had always wanted a daughter.
The newly-appointed guards had to keep the Death Eaters from running away while they also had to keep them alive, unbeaten, and unviolated.
“That’s a beautiful story, Harry, but I believe you mentioned something earlier about fucking me…?”
“I would hope you know how to use a shrinking charm,” he sighed, walking over to the box that would later be carted upstairs to their bedroom so that they could cover the new mattress. And there it was, the pasta strainer amongst the Egyptian cotton. “Why did I marry you, again?”
“I don’t think you heard me correctly,” Kingsley said, voice rising in volume. “We are starting tomorrow. These people—“ he motioned to the tidy businesspeople around them. “—have children. They have other projects to work on. They don’t care if you hooked up in high school and feel awkward about it. Their time is wasting, my time is wasting, and it’s on you two to sign these papers or walk out the door.”
“Anything you want…?” Draco prompted him to finish the sentence.
“You sound doubtful,” Draco pointed out, turning on the faucet and washing the remaining shaving cream off.
Harry shook his head. “They’re not feeding me. I’m being starved out,” he joked. “All the food goes to Dudley.”
When Draco placed the phone in his hand it was distinctly heavier. And was that…? Was that an Alliance Blue Limited Edition Case?
“Even sort of saw one for awhile, but I felt bad lying to him about where I was all the time. The ‘I have weird, strict parents who were formerly involved in a cult’ excuse only takes you so far. That, and I do not understand cellular phones.”
Looking up at Pansy’s window, Maggie shook her head. That woman was insane in at least twelve different ways.
Following orders without thinking, Harry dropped to his knees in front of Draco’s trouser pants. He stared ahead as he could see the outline of Draco’s member, erect and restrained by fabric.
“Oh,” said Harry, his grip on the pillow tightening. “That feels good.”
Kennedy nodded. “It’s almost exactly like mine. We’re always sending each other funny videos. Not like ‘cat making weird noises’ funny, but ‘two punk boys getting their lips rings caught while making out’ funny.”
“Definitely my best Healer’s visit. Your house calls sure are something,” Harry remarked in hopes of making Draco laugh again.
“Can you drop your politically correct act for a second?” demanded Tiffany. “I’m trying to tell you to forget the damn plan and tell your aunt and uncle; I’m not trying to pick a fight with gay people.”
There would have to be a space with no cameras, like their hotel room at night, to talk themselves into some sort of compromise, for Draco to even attempt such a conversation.
Their shovels hit the hard, untilled ground with difficulty, as expected. Not even the rotting leaves could soften what winter had chilled so many times without being tended to. Still, Harry and Ron dug.
“Fuck the press. It’s a one-in-ten chance based on pure statistics. Those super-religious families who have like fifteen kids are guaranteed a queer one.”
Aside from a few domestics and petty thefts, Ron and Harry hadn’t seen any other action than the damned case the whole week. It was driving Ron up the wall, and he’d even confided in Hermione about the hint. As clever as his wife was, she was busy with work and pregnancy so her best advice wound up being ‘Go to Remus’.
She was a timely young lady, at least. Remus was careful to use the phrase ‘young lady’ since she would be entering third year in the fall. “Walk with me?” Remus asked of her.
At least Grace actually liked DADA, unlike her aunt’s pushing for her to play piano because of her ‘long, shapely fingers’. Those had been cruel hours glued to a piano bench.
Shocked, Harry shifted so that his legs were crossed. “I didn’t realize,” he murmured. “That it was important.”
“Yeah, all I need to see is your boner,” Draco teased and earning another elbow to his arm. “Ow! I bruise easily, you brute.”
“She heard us talking. Grace heard us—“
“Yes, sir,” Harry said shakily. This was not going to be pretty.
If Draco rolled his eyes any harder, they would get stuck in the back of his head. “I can’t hear another word about anybody’s n
“You like that? I could put one in you even without lubricant, I know you could take it.”
. He was supposed to be the one who guided him through his teenage years with a steady hand with advice on girls and his future. When the ‘girls’ bit was revealed to be impossible, Lucius had stammered. He loved Draco all the same, but he had no idea how to proceed.
“I’m chivalrous. I thought you loved chivalry,” Draco teased. Was flirting out of the question when they were both ignoring the fact that they’d had sex? Apparently not.
“Ah, yes. It really does need me.” He basked in the praise.
“He was the first I said the Three Words of Death to.” Those words, of course, being ‘I love you’. “His name was Patrick and he was a florist, so the flowers definitely helped.”
Girls grinded back on their dates, avoiding eye contact entirely as they both swayed to the beat with her arse pressed up against his stiffy. A hundred carbon copies of that exact situation unfolded all around Draco and Harry, who had consequently fled to the dinner tables.
“As do you,” Harry responded, putting his hand in Draco’s. They could do this. Together. The pair exited the alley and make a quick jaunt over to the building. Thankfully, nobody was out at this hour to see them. Except, of course, the couple in the harsh light of the local diner staking out the spot.
Draco was absolutely loving all this attention, leaning into and chasing Harry’s caring touches. “What can I say? I know what I like.”
Draco wasn’t blind to the history of oppression gay teachers had been through, wrongfully accused of ‘corrupting’ children or trying to ‘convert’ them. All nonsense. He would have none of them know about his personal life just to steer clear of that possibility.
“Come out whenever you’re ready,” Draco said, adjusting his belt buckle and fixing his hair.
Harry smiled. “So are you. It’s a big secret, though. You only let me see it sometimes like I’m going to tell someone and ruin it all.” His hand smoothed back Draco’s blonde hair. “I promise your secret’s safe with me.”
“Merlin’s left nut.” At least Lucius was on their side for sure now.
The television lit up with a shot of Harry looking at Draco with dramatic, romantic music framing his gaze.
“There is one thing,” Draco said, thinking of the secret of Nyn Anglewise. “We’re already planning it with a host in mind. You’ll have to work with her.”
“Yes! I’m so going to win!”
The techies decorating the bare stage looked like worker bees, always moving but never colliding.
Harry’s face was still frozen in that stunned look. Draco promptly blamed it on his having grown up poor and being dazzled by money and took over the conversation. “But you’re asking questions now?” Draco pressed Lorraine. “How come?”
It was unhealthy to cling to grudges, or so he had been told as a child by some Hufflepuff Professor. That didn’t stop him from holding them in the slightest, but it distracted him for the moment on his way to the owlery.
Soon enough Ron would show up for his own visit because he worried too, and clearly felt eternally guilty. He had become an Auror while Harry didn’t, and now Auror Weasley’s time was spent protecting the wizarding world. Ron was making some really great changes internally, but Harry could tell he wished they were doing that together. They were meant to be partners.
“I have a man,” Theo corrected, pointing a finger at himself for emphasis as he followed Draco to the door. “You have words on a screen who could possibly be the work of a twelve year-old.”
Harry had pulled him aside to murmur about the Fenwick case, and he’d seen the eyes that were often so full of laughter darken, like they had when Harry had met him in third year.
Draco was filling the cabinet beneath the sink with bathroom cleaning supplies and extra toilet tissue when he heard a metallic hum from the bedroom. He sprang up embarrassingly fast and ran to the scroll casing to see parchment eek out of it inch by inch, a reply to his message. His heart leapt, and he had to remind himself to take a minute to let the whole thing unfurl before reading.
Harry looked over the Scotsman’s shoulder to see just what he was getting into and his eyes found—fancy golden buffet tables? He couldn’t tell what was in them at this distance.
Draco rose to sitting, rubbing his closed eyes with his fists for a moment before reaching for his wand and turning off the music box with a swish.
“Hate planes,” he offered to Draco as enticing conversation when he fell head-first into his own milky-white bed in their suite.
Draco had promised not to judge and so he just nodded. “I’m glad it was good for you. Did you find yourself less frustrated after that night?”
Instead of a look of lust this time around, Potter seemed to be giving him the evil eye. That sensitive little poof.
A little blonde girl approached the stool and sat down, cheeks Gryffindor red from being in front of everyone. “Monica Nichols!” It was a happy turn of events for Draco to hear the hat contemplate and then announce: “You will do well in SLYTHERIN!”
Harry’s manager gave him a look from across the shop in reference to the new customers that had lined up while Harry was having his fun, and Harry quickly realized that he’d let the line pile up quite a bit. They were all staring at him, too.
Harry stood from the stool and stared forward. Was he supposed to act a certain way?
“Let’s.”
Draco wondered if this ‘H’ might want in his room to begin with. It didn’t have to specifically be ‘H’, for if he rejected him Draco would brood but not forever. Writing to this man felt like a catalyst for change. Even if it wasn’t ‘H’ in this room he would find someone to cherish. Pansy was a floozy and a drunk but a wonderful motivational speaker. Her words got to Draco as they always did, the support he needed but didn’t know he wanted.
“My bones feel like they’re in the wrong place sometimes,” Harry remarked a bit miserably. “You weren’t wrong about the pain.”
“Harry,” she addressed him next, the hint of a smile on her lips. “Does Draco bring you peace?”
“Don’t count Grace out just yet, okay?” Harry asked. This wasn’t a deal breaker or anything, but with the opening of her file had come the opening of hundreds more. Something in Harry felt grateful for her lies because of that.
Eek, sorry this one took so long! I also wrote most of it on the day after Donald Trump was impeached because I was so happy I had Drarry dreams all night long. Wishing many Drarry dreams to you, my sweet followers!
The first business of it all had been telling Draco’s parents, which was only slightly less difficult than nailing jam to a tree. Lucius had turned his nose up at Harry, declaring that Draco deserved better, et cetera, et cetera.
As Harry gently floated through the day-crowd that frequented the wizarding bars around the Ministry, he got some nods from bums that recognized him. Harry would probably have to arrest them for riding their brooms home drunk later that night.
“Even in the lilies.”
“My darling housewhore, I would love nothing more.”
“Yes, yes,” Harry chanted. “Yes, yes, yes!”
Blaise motioned to Ginny. “The title’s technically in her name, but we live here together.” Still naked himself, Blaise climbed out of their royal blue sheets so he could grab a midnight snack.
“Yeah,” Blaise laughed right back. “I do. But would it be so awful? I mean, you could be there. And you could sleep with other guys!”
Draco gave him a wry look. “Yes, well, do try not to die again over it. Anyway, where was I…? Yes, being a Dominant. I had always had fantasies. Dreams, waking and sleeping.” He’d had more than a few about Harry when they were both teenagers and the urge to touch himself had been incontrollable some days. All of those hormone-riddled Slytherin kids in one dorm, what were the Hogwarts founders thinking? “Acting on them when I found myself with a willing partner had me hooked, though. I started attending BDSM parties, and getting into the literature on it.”
“Yes, pet, you like to have Daddy watching, don’t you? I see, darling, I see that pretty cock hard for me.” Draco undid his trousers and slipped them off as one with his underwear, no more time to waste on his own pleasure. Draco too was hard as a rock and not afraid to show it off. “I see that hole of yours, too, so sweet and little, but don’t worry, I know how to open you up slowly. Trust me—I’m a Healer.”
“I don’t think anyone has ever called me that before.”
Harry often got so bored, so droopy and wilted, that he conked out on the nearest flat surface. That was just fine considering he didn’t leave the flat much, and even the carpet here could be nice to lay on sometimes. He was doing a lot of laying down these days, and not in the way he wished he was.
“Oh, come here, baby,” Hermione murmured as she held her daughter close.
There was something ever so vaguely threatening about Narcissa grooming Grace like a prized pet. “I know you’re wondering why I brought you here. Dear, I truly am sorry for the trauma you’ve been in,” she said in that soothing voice of hers. “But I’m afraid motherhood is full of trauma. It’s all going to be over soon.”
“No. You’re Head Auror,” Draco said with a quiet desperation. “You can make this go away. It was probably Marcus who killed the man from the Order, and there’s your perpetrator. Case solved.”
Wasting no time of his own, Draco bound his wrists in a tight knot of the silken tie. He needed two hands for that, so he released Harry’s head but Harry didn’t turn it, didn’t dare even look at Draco without permission. Draco took note of that and smiled to himself. What a sweet, obedient thing he had in his house.
“It doesn’t sound like you’re objecting.” Harry’s hand began to go lower when Draco swatted him away.
“Ah, right. Draco Malfoy, the Forever Bachelor.”
He pulled out the chair and sat down, throwing a look of recognition to Professor Potter. He noted the way Potter had bathed his roast duck in gravy to the point where it was nearly spilling off the edges of the plate.
to interrupt.” Pansy liked to hold onto grudges like a hoarder to newspaper. Of course she hadn’t forgotten his little jab. “Just—try with someone who emphasizes being private. If they’re paranoid in their ad there’s no way they’ll sell you out to The Prophet and risk themselves like that.” At least she hoped not—any wizarding newspaper would give buckets of galleons to anyone with dirt on Draco Malfoy.
“Still drugged as all hell. I want to write you poems and you know I’m shite at poems,” Draco snickered. “You’ll have to stay with me until the effects of the love potion wears off. I couldn’t bear to be without you now.”
It was disorienting, yes. Music was changing to cater to younger tastes, movies marketed to teens didn’t appeal to Harry much anymore, and there were new trends he didn’t understand in the slightest. Whatever that book of faces muggles always talked about did, Harry was sure it wouldn’t catch on.
“I know.”
“Harry most of all should know that memories stay.” Lucius waved away his wife’s frustration with a limp swish of his hand.
Harry kissed his aching temples. “Please,” he said, pushing on.
probably still don’t. What’s their number? Did they change addresses? We should press charges, sue them for all they—“
But that wasn’t how Draco wanted to come, not tonight. After a long bout of holding Harry down so he might sputter and choke on him some more he caught a glimpse of Harry’s cock in his pink underwear—still hard. Good. He yanked Harry off of him again. “Fuck,” Harry echoed in a raw voice.
“I promise,” the Slytherin tried.
“Alright. Harry,” Draco turned to his sweet, sweet boy with the emerald eyes and the arms that held him every night. “Bed?”
“Wow,” Harry laughed. “That’s high praise.”
“That he’s going to have a pleasant day where nothing goes wrong?” he tried. Draco next to him snickered.
“Oh, please, call me Molly!” she insisted. “Now, let’s get you all inside. The roast is almost ready and you’re all the last to arrive.”
“I didn’t have much to say,” Harry admitted with a little grin, slowly turning to face Draco. His robes moved with him, his best pair of them, though Malfoy didn’t need to know that. “I’m glad you’ve brought your talents to Hogwarts.”
“Test them,” Draco instructed of the bonds and Harry tried to pull his hands apart and out, finding himself unable to. “Good boy. Look at me.” Harry turned his face to Draco’s, looking up at him through his glasses and eyelashes.
Wait, why did that voice sound familiar?
“I appreciate you speaking with me in what has to be a tough time.”
Harry jumped, surprised by the sting but not repulsed by it.
“Then we’ll have to change that,” Draco insisted, stepping into trousers that matched his jacket in print. Yes, this was starting to look like an outfit. “Even generations ago your family was always considered New Money. Let the Old Money show you how to spend it properly.”
“Aw. You’re sort of bearable to be with.”
Before Draco could pull out, pull Harry to his chest, and litter his face with kisses, a rather inopportune knock pounded at his office door.
Draco pursed his lips trying not to smile. “Oh? And what makes you say that?”
Draco’s way also happened to be Harry’s way, but that was beside the point.
Pansy grimaced. She wasn’t the biggest fan of the former Granger, but birth was one thing she would only wish on her worst enemy. The stretching, the tearing… “Gross.”
“I thought you met at a bar,” Narcissa recalled with eerie clarity and an arched brow.
Warmth blossomed in Draco’s chest to which there was nothing he could compare it with. How could Harry be so sexy while saying an ‘I love you’? Draco grunted and drove his hips harder into him. “I bet I can fuck you right to orgasm, no need to even touch you. You really love cock, don’t you?”
“Don’t look so concerned,” she said with a playful roll of her eyes. “I’ll get plenty of naps and drink gallons of water a day. I wouldn’t want to upset my Healer; he’s a real stickler for pregnancies. I pity the woman that will soon be carrying his bundle of joy.”
“Sweetheart, you’re thirteen—“
“Need to go shopping,” Harry told himself as if that would help get him out the door. He’d spent all day reading messages from men who wanted him, of which there were quite a few. A lot of their messages were short, some just inquiries about his length and girth and how much pain he could take. Harry really didn’t know how to answer the latter question. He’d hooked up with men and his first time had hurt in a surprisingly pleasant way, and he’d gladly let some rough him up and spank him, but Harry had no idea what a practicing Dominant’s pain scale looked like. He wasn’t even really a practicing submissive yet, either.
“What are you two going on about?” Lucius inquired. Draco and Harry were always going on about something, but this seemed of a higher importance than their usual chatter.
The muggle man outstretched his hand. “She’s Suzy and I’m Dudley. Dudley Dursley.”
“I wouldn’t have to get the hang of it if my wife hadn’t
Encouraged by this, Draco began working his tongue along the velvety bottom of Harry’s cock. Positive reinforcement would work well with this one, and he took to his role with an almost amusing ease, like Harry had been waiting for this moment the whole time. Had he expected this when he saw Draco in that bar? Either way, Draco was going to make damn well sure he didn’t regret it.
Draco dragged his teeth across the bump of Harry’s Adam’s apple and bit down to the side of it, sucking the beginnings of a bruise onto Harry’s luscious clean skin. Harry kept his head back so Draco could leave a darker mark, nails digging into his shoulders.
He’d told Dragonis that he would be wearing his navy-blue coat and black jeans, so he really hoped that would be enough of a description.
The strokes were steady and heavy. “Fuck,” Draco groaned, an obscene smile lighting up his face. “That’s it, clench your hand tighter.”
Harry had spent all day in the getup Draco had selected for him, the house the perfect temperature and Draco’s wandering eyes a constant excitement. Their desire was approaching a fever-pitch, interspersed by charm school lessons Draco passed down. Dining etiquette, proper posture practices, everything a man needed to blend in with high-class pureblood society. That was politeness to Draco Malfoy, after all. In that world and his mind titles and commands held power. Seeing Harry fucking Potter the most powerful wizard of their age learn this for the first time was always a little shocking to the system.
Draco’s eyes scanned the room and Harry bloody Potter looked like he belonged here. It was the suit, and the décor, and the way Harry was smiling. Knowing that smile was for him lit a fire in Draco’s chest.
Theo narrowed his eyes. Where did he know her from? “Can I help you find anything?” he asked, leaning over the counter to try and get a better look at Grace. She was in sweatpants and a baggy green shirt as if somebody had dragged her out of bed.
“Yes, my day… Well. Harry, what would you say if I had a plan to catch who I think might have sold us out, but that it was a risky one at best?” Draco asked.
Harry and Draco exchanged looks before Draco outstretched his arm to him.
Draco hummed in agreement.
“I don’t doubt their skills,” Draco answered diplomatically. “I’m sure we’ll have a name and someone to sue very soon.” But it would come from the trap they laid in the Dungeon. “So, father, would you permit I give Harry a tour of this estate? I want to show him the gardens and the peacocks after dinner.”
“I hate you. You’re lucky just to be in my presence.”
Harry’s thoughts were interrupted Draco did something that sent a shock through his whole system. Draco leaned in and pushed his lips to Harry’s emblematic scar. Draco kissed it not once but twice in long, tender intervals before standing up straight again.
The question didn't register with Harry for a moment. "...What?"
“Alright then. Let me up a little; I won’t leave.”
“Yes, please,” Harry requested. As fun as the costume had been it was beginning to pinch in some of the wrong places on his sides and was indeed covered in his come.
?” a woman asked, clearly shocked.
Narcissa clutched her teacup tightly. “Oh, Draco. That’s wonderful,” she soothed, sensing her boy was nervous to say all this.
“Then name a possible scenario. Any, Blaise. Any one where I am not entirely miserable and cross with you,” Ginny suggested in a sarcastic whine.
“That,” she said. “And a picture if you’ll allow it.”
Harry let out a huff. He knew that telling Draco would result in some sort of teasing but he also knew that Draco rarely gave up on things without an answer. That’s why they hosted a show about internet mysteries. “It was Dean Thomas.”
“Will you marry me?”
“Good to see you, mate. Really,” Ron told him, trying not to look too disappointed that Harry’s place was still a mess and his clothes likely hadn’t been changed in a few days. He wasn’t exactly a cleanfreak himself but he was learning to be one from living with Hermione. Worse though than Harry being a little ripe was that he was this way because of a lack of motivation to be anything else.
“Grace?”
“I took care of things. It’s impossible for me to ice this dumb cake on my own, so I’m leaving it to someone else. Well, multiple someone elses. Two. They can ice it, because the thought of raising this thing alone is the stuff of nightmares,” Grace blathered on. The headache, sugar rush, pregnancy, and general emotional trauma all added up to one strong punch to her sanity.
“Your one in Diagon Alley?”
With a breathy moan Harry couldn’t help but voice his agreement. The intrusion of Draco’s cock was searing for a long moment, a kind of pain that Harry had missed terribly from his inactivity. “So big,” was Harry’s response, hips shifting slightly while impaled upon Draco.
“And, of course, I love her,” Kennedy added. It seemed like such an obvious fact that she’d forgotten to say it out loud. “More than anything.”
Harry grinned uncontrollably to be called sweet in return. That made it hard to kiss Draco but Harry swore to try most valiantly to. He gave Draco a few more pecks on the mouth before dipping down below his chin to kiss along his jawline. Draco Malfoy was a vision exposed on his floor, those doubtlessly-designer pants of his a cheery lavender.
.” Nott Sr. was acting like a villain in a fucking superhero movie as if he had some grand plan. It was delusional and Theo didn’t really like superhero movies.
Draco saw Harry slip away at some point during the measuring, but was glad to see him come back when he spoke up about the shoes. “We will find shoes that fit you,” Draco promised him. If not here then at least in magic boutiques later on—was there a later on? Draco was trying not to think about how he was technically on a trial run right now. “And a suit that suits you.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I almost wish I was attending a real party here. It’s nice and private, tucked away from the world and with masquerade masks maybe nobody would recognize us…”
“And don’t let the Ryan Lewis’s bite.”
Aiden snickered. Eric was hilarious. Eric was so cool. Eric had such nice hair.
“Yes, Teddy’s at the age where all he wants to talk about are dinosaurs and dragons. You’ll meet him soon,” Potter recounted with a smile. This year his godson would come to Hogwarts as a first year, and then Harry would shepherd him through the rest of his schoolyears. He was looking forward to seeing what kind of person Teddy became, what house he’d be sorted into playing a small but nascent factor in who he would live amongst. “But, before we get too off-topic again, I should introduce you to some other students you’ll be seeing this year.”
Their luck ran out when they reopened the box (containing a fucking spine), and just when they thought Nott Sr. was getting lazy, he got them good.
“Shotgun,” Draco called, hopping in the passenger’s seat.
“If you have any requests for songs, treatments, food, or drinks, do not hesitate to ask,” she continued, turning a corner where a bubbling fountain stood. “And here we are, Sirs, your changing room.”
Lucius had gone silent. He didn’t like to remember that July.
They were in the comfort of Lorraine’s apartment but Harry still felt the need to rush. He put in ‘Macklemore’s number twice and it rang out right to voicemail, so he tried texting the number.
“Yours,” Harry answered, grip loosening slightly to look over his shoulders. “Draco?”
“Incredible
Harry had eaten worse in college and firmly told Draco to suck it up, which led to another spat.
As the extra camerapeople and producers signed agreement after agreement around the table in the conference room, Harry wished his co-host would hurry the hell up. He’d gathered that his co-host’s plane ride had been a rough one from the whisperings of some interns when he walked in, but that was no excuse to leave Harry high and dry. All of these higher-ups in silk blouses and ties made Harry uneasy.
“Drac
,” he growled.
“Do you think I’m trying to attack you or something?” Draco sighed as he settled in, leaning his seat back far enough to trap the woman sitting behind him. “I’m trying to help you.”
“I don’t,” Harry said seriously. “More of a Quibbler man myself.”
Draco seriously doubted it was ‘all her father’. Brooke was a grown woman; she wasn’t beholden to her parents anymore. “It’s never going to be a ‘good time’,” Draco finally spoke into the phone. “If you wait for a ‘good time’ then you’ll wait for the rest of your life. Kennedy wants to meet
“It’s about the girl,” she finally managed. “Grace. See, I have a son… And they were romantically involved.”
Harry swallowed. Should he ask what was really on his mind?
By the time Harry finished a long hiss of air and reminded himself to be patient with guests on the show like Kingsley had said, someone else had entered the café.
“Oh. Oh, okay.” At least Ron was trying to understand. “Can I ask you something else?”
l.” They cut to a shot of Harry laughing with Draco and then immediately to one of them glaring at one another from their post-sex awkwardness.
“So hurt you scared that poor intern half to death?”
“Remus is smart. Remus is brilliant, really. I’m sure he can figure out the next clues, but, um, they get harder as things progress. There may be a point where he can’t figure them out.”
“And then you proceeded to throw up all over Moony’s favorite sweater,” Sirius informed Harry.
Draco twirled the wine in the glass like he saw his father do with his fancy drinks before taking a sip. “Mmm, floral.”
The second he was free it allowed Draco to get even closer to Harry, wrapping his arms around the man as they lay entwined on the couch. “Who ever said anything about me leaving you?” Draco murmured, smoothing back Harry’s hair to reveal his scar. Draco leaned forward and gave it a big kiss.
Harry descended into the Azkaban interrogation cell with a purpose. “Dolores Umbridge,” he said curtly as if she hadn’t forced him to write his rule-breaking habits hard enough to draw blood. A faint scar still lingered there, but the words were blurred.
Kennedy paused when she recognized the men that had been on her computer screen just hours ago in her driveway accompanied by a whole SUV of camera-toting men and women. “Oh.”
Harry licked his lips. Draco took note.
In a rush, Draco shoved the head of his prick inside Harry. The Gryffindor took it, like, well, a Gryffindor. Harry liked it fast anyway.
“And had me six months after the wedding, uh-huh. I can do maths,” Draco reminded them, earning a dark glare from both parents.
“Your heart is strong,” Draco murmured. “And lungs clear.”
I have no idea why Drarry fanfic pours out of me by the thousands of words but I can never get more than a few hundred out a week of my book. Welp.
.” He motioned to Draco and Harry’s clasped hands.
“I do. I am going to say yes when he proposes, after all.”
?” Harry smirked and nudged their noses together. “Almost half of that episode was me looking at you like you’re my new god or something.”
“Long hours at St. Mungo’s allow my mind to wander, and I wandered over to you. I will admit my shock and horror at first but I couldn’t be happier that ‘H’ is you, and that you’re you, Harry,” Draco admitted with some pain. Sincerity was a risky move in a world like this.
Unlike Draco’s theatric moans whenever someone said something that bothered him deeply, Lucius simply put on a stony face. Sure, in the years after the war he’d gotten slightly better with expressing himself, but he was a man of old money and old society.
“I know.”
“What’s going on down there?” Zeke’s sister shouted from her room. All she wanted was for school to start again so she could be back in her sparkly blue dorms and far, far away from her mother.
“Welcome, Mr. Malfoy and Guest,” the Scottish man from before greeted them. He was dressed in a fine-pressed tuxedo uniform with a cloth hanging over his arm as if he were a waiter. Was he a waiter? “Welcome to Heaven.”
“Quit being so eager,” he muttered. “We’re not going to take away all of the restrictions. This time, we’ll narrow it down by distance, age, parental support…”
“I’ll reset it to Harry’s birthday,” Draco offered.
“Oh, but we do,” Draco replied firmer, eyes narrowing. Harry sat up straighter. “I am deathly serious about my timers, Harry Potter. Time waits for no man.”
“I’ll do it, but if I hear a phone ringing in the distance I’m quitting,” Harry joked.
“To apologize?” Ron laughed, drawing his wand. That was a new one, but it still smacked of a complete lie.
“Mint is disgusting,” she scolded as she pulled out a tub of strawberry. “It’s like an evergreen assault on your mouth.”
“Yes, please.”
Relationships were strange like that. Especially with Draco, Harry would find himself doing absolutely ridiculous, slightly scary things and enjoying them.
“What?” he asked as they thudded back down to the kitchen.
Draco smiled against Harry’s lips. “Yeah, well, I’ve got everything I asked for with you, so you could invite me to dinner with the Dark Lord himself and I’d show up.”
“Aw, meeting the mother,” Draco joined in with an amused look on his face. “You two really are getting serious.”
Zeke huffed. “I get that. That’s justified.” His sister had told him to say that a lot so Grace knew she was appreciated and stuff. “You just… You should have owled me or something. When you made a decision.”
submissive. There are lessons you must learn. Today’s is in decorum—charm, and behavior. When you submit to me you are not permitted to slouch, Harry. You must hold yourself knowing Daddy’s looking at your body.”
“Let’s play a game.”
How Theo ‘was with water’ was always a wonderful source for jokes. The man was like a cat, for fuck’s sake. He wouldn’t go near the stuff other than showers, drinking, and potions. He wasn’t even too fond of baths.
They watched Lorraine pull up the Macklemore and Ryan Lewis fanpage and her chat history with the ‘Macklemore’ who ran it.
With a groan, Sirius walked to the stove to finish their meals.
“But nothing! I will not hear it. We’ve invited Draco here because he is not the same boy he was in school. Can I say the same of you? It was Marcus Nott who hurt my Fred, and he’s rotting in Azkaban.”
“Shoes…” Draco took a moment to think and tap his pointed chin. “Black Oxfords, silk socks. While you fetch that and escort him to his dressing room, my good man, I’ll shop for myself because I need a change of clothes as well.” And Draco didn’t trust anyone but himself with his appearance.
“It won’t.” With that, she rolled onto her side and tried to make the best of the hour-long flight as a nap instead of an interview.
“I think you look best in nothing at all,” Harry countered.
“Can I ask if they know?” Harry followed up at the mention of Lucius and Narcissa.
“I’ll see,” Harry shrugged and sank back into the pillows. He might just stay here all day, breathing in Draco’s scent and feeling listless.
“No! It’s not that! I promise it’s not that, okay? I think I’m not getting my point across well.”
“Oh, I am,” Luna answered wistfully, making Draco and Harry crack up again. “Ah, we have our fun. Don’t worry, I’ll get to him as soon as this new Quibbler is out.” And with a wink Luna sent the recorded transcript off to the press.
Theo narrowed his eyes and brought out the big guns. “For me?”
Draco covered all of his bases with the examination, his wand weaving an image of her beating heart before him. When he was absolutely sure nothing was wrong aside from the sound, Draco put down his wand and the image burst into sparkly flecks, falling at the girl’s feet. Her pudgy little hands reached out to grab them, smiling all the way.
For now though Draco was focused on a tactile experience, rubbing and occasionally spanking Harry’s arse. What made Harry’s toes curl in his heels was when Draco reached between his legs and gently fondled his cock and balls in his hand through the panties.
His mother gently pushed him towards an academic life while his father aggressively pushed him to pursue his Quidditch skill. Hugo didn’t really like either option, to be honest. He wished he could be like Lily and know what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.
Harry nodded. “I don’t want to be something that comes between you as a family. Believe me, I know we have our disagreements on, well, everything, but what we can agree on is wanting the best for Draco.”
Remus burst into laughter at the memory, still stuck on trying to tie his shoes on the couch they’d previously shagged on. The loops were too loopy. How do you fit the loop in the other loop? “Lupin,” he said to himself. “Lup-in, Lup-out. I should know this.”
“Oh, they’re lovely. Mum is always asking after you, and Dad has taken to video games. You ought to come visit them sometime. I think they’d like to hear about all the developments in your life,” Ron motioned to Draco.
“Well,” Draco muttered. He hadn’t really thought about that. “At two years old they’ll be out of nappies, so I’ll put them in the hospital day-care.” Yeah, that made sense, right? That way their baby could make friends.
Maggie laughed. “Something tells me,” she said. “That regardless of sexual orientation, your kid will be a deviant.”
They had
Pansy gave her best pout, arms crossed. “I’m hurt, really, that you would not want to see me.”
“Is there anything you’d like to hang in your room here? I promise I’ll only tease you occasionally about the pennants.”
“Does the stableboy also become a king?”
On the other side of London, two men who had quite literally done all of what Draco and Harry were doing and ten thousand other things were facing a new and vaguely sex-related situation.
“Goodbye, Daddy.”
A loud whimper left Harry at the thought of it alone—even louder than the ones he made when Draco’s skin connected to his in his repetitive drilling.
“The room where us and the Lupins will have hilarious, wonderful, and tasteful dinner conversations over take-out Indian food.” The assurance Draco said it with sounded to Harry like fact. “They’ll impart onto us the wisdom of the ages, and tell us what the sixties were like.”
Draco looked up and scowled at whatever tomfoolery was going on preemptively. He was not in the mood for bullshit. “What?” he muttered after a moment of staring.
“Yes.” That was true, except for the one time Vince flashed him in the locker-room. “And I’ve been told it does pretty fantastic things to a woman,” he grinned before gulping down a nearby bottle of firewhiskey.
“Draco,” Molly said warmly, approaching him on the steps and surprising the living hell out of him. “Welcome to the Burrow. Anyone who Harry loves is more than good enough for us.”
“But you know everything that came after that. Henry cheated, Eric had a drinking problem, Clyde broke it off in fear of meeting my father, Jim kept everything bottled up and was never honest with me, and you know about all the men I slept with in between them. I slept with a bloke last week and had a ‘date’ with Flint today,” Draco told him neatly as if his insane sex life could truly be summed up in a few sentences.
Benjy Fenwick probably would know if he wasn’t dead.
“Yes,” Harry answered honestly before entering the room and all of its perfection.
It had been the last thing to unpack. Harry had been so happy that the move was over that he launched a cardboard box out of the window and onto their verdant-green backyard. That sad little box on the grass had given Draco the inspiration to start searching for a water display to set up there. A bench could go next to the water and some poinsettias from the Malfoy gardens…
Harry smirked and ignored Draco implying Harry had always wanted to be famous. “I’m not sure I’ll be so concerned with clothes if I bring a man home.”
Harry didn’t need to be told twice. He came hard, toes curling under and hips stuttering as always. Still, through his own pleasure he kept a semblance of their rhythm, determined to give Draco his best.
“I can do that.”
“Don’t worry, he’ll be home by eleven—“
“You’re very,” said Draco, pushing his fingers out as wide as they would go and lining up his hips. “Very welcome.” He sank into Harry without warning, drawing a gasp from the other man that he cherished the sound of. “Steady, darling.”
Flushed with embarrassment, Olivia gave him a reassuring nod. “You’re doing just fine.”
,” Harry gasped, voice thin and urgent. He had to take a deep breath before he continued, Draco’s fingers already drawing little groans from the corners of his mouth with each movement. “I want you to, whenever you can, I want you to—to come inside of me.”
“Yeah?” Harry looked up to his boyfriend. He sat on the edge of their bed feeling more than childish about his request. It was embarrassing even though he knew Draco wasn’t laughing at him.
That was a new one. “’Butterfly’?”
Dudley pretended not to be confused. “Oh, that sounds cool. Real cool. How long have you been married?”
“What does he like to eat? I could cook a meal,” Narcissa suggested, hoping that would impress the elven-rights activist in Harry with her ability to survive without a house elf cooking and cleaning for them.
Harry was dumbfounded. He’d expected Draco to tell the whole school some twisted version of their encounter that made Harry look like a monster. He’d prepared insults and everything! Still, he was going to have a hard time trusting this gift. What if there was some kind of tracking device on it or something?
Draco looked down at his father—blonde hair fading with age, crinkles forming around his eyes—and tried not to get his hopes up. “It’s about a boy.” Usually, that would have Lucius running off to go ‘do some work’ or ‘graph some progress’ in his office.
“I get to tell Hermione,” Ron said with a big smile.
“No, it was good,” Harry said, and looked to Draco to confirm.
. Just get to the office, to the office, to the office—
He sincerely hoped hijinks this year were limited to inter-house pranks and raging hormones.
Draco crossed around the table to join his husband in staring at a teenage girl’s midriff. Grace experienced a special brand of awkward that she doubted anyone before her had ever encountered.
“Yeah?” Harry chuckled, focused on each little button so that Draco could be free. “For my homemaking skills, of course.”
“Brush your teeth, too.”
“Very sensitive, then,” Draco said and released the nipple. “Perhaps that’s why you want a bra so badly, hm? Keep those perky little tits safe.” Draco reached out for the right one and pinched it.
Ron nodded, knowing better than to argue with Harry when he was feeling stubborn. “Let’s just get in and get out, yeah?”
Wow. Draco and Grace had been talking for more than sixty seconds and nothing had gone terribly awry. Draco was feeling better about himself by the minute.
He and Harry wound up at Kennedy’s house earlier than even planned.
“Well,” Harry said quietly. “I always thought it’d be nice to have a train set. Like the kind that goes around the bottom of the Christmas tree, with little stops and people and… I dunno.” Harry was redder than he was talking about sex. All he’d had were those tiny soldier toys, and he’d always wanted to give them a nice, open place to live along the rails. “A train, I guess.”
They could be any two men in the world in front of these Wiltshire farming folks, a regular doctor and whatever Harry’s cover story was that day. Just two blokes, clearly romantically involved but nothing else quite standing out about them. Muggles could be so refreshing sometimes.
“I’ve never tried those before,” Harry admitted with a rushed excitement. His hips were swaying gently with Draco in them. “How do they work?”
Tiffany rolled her eyes. “You’re a nutter.”
“Shit.”
Draco’s interest was piqued. “Depends. What does the winner get?”
Benjy Fenwick’s femur bone was in a cupboard in the Shrieking Shack, and had been for thirty years.
Remus looked up to make sure she’d gone into her room. “He tries to kiss her and I’ll kill him.”
Draco let out a whine at the very thought of retelling the story but went on anyway so he could have company in his pity party. “First Flint started babbling about his excruciatingly ordinary job as a financial consultant,” he drawled. “Like I care what to invest in, I’m so rich already, it was really terrible conversation.”
“I’m not. You’d never listen,” he muttered. Zeke wondered if all couples were supposed to fight like this; spewing hate at one another until they tired. He wondered if the two blokes she’d promised their kid to did that. Those guys were married, though. They probably made up afterwards and told each other they loved each other. Grace and Zeke didn’t even love each other.
She’d never seen two elves run to each other so quickly to apparate away.
“And then we—wait, what?!”
*** *** ***
“Merlin’s arse, I was joking,” Draco killed that idea before it could grow legs. “Can’t you just be happy for me? After everything I finally find someone I want to share the Manor with like you always wanted, too. Just because we aren’t wearing rings doesn’t mean we’re not committed.” Draco squeezed Harry’s hand. “I wish I could find a way to show you—show you the house and what we’ve done with it. The gardens are growing in a greenhouse Harry built, and soon the plants will be mature enough to survive outside it.”
“Nope. I mean it’s strange in that there is no trace of the Black family. No books about them, no portraits… The place is completely and one-hundred percent Sirius and Remus. Nothing like the stories about the war said,” she told him quietly. “I guess they really made it their home.”
, 2007.” With Hermione and Ron’s wedding coming up August 5
“What, like a camera affected by a shrinking spell?”
Draco responded by lapping his tongue as far as he could inside, licking in firm and dedicated machinations seeking Harry’s relaxation. Silently he committed himself to doing this until Harry was a simpering mess, the first signs of such a transformation coming with the shaking of Harry’s legs.
Harry gave Draco’s nose a little bop. “And I love your nose, no matter how much you tell me it’s too big. I like the little bump in the middle, and I think it really suits you.”
The door opened to reveal a stout woman in pink. Only when Olivia squinted her eyes could she see that it was Molly Weasley. “Molly!” Remus greeted her warmly, bringing her in for a hug. “Sirius is out shopping.” He’d ranted about starting a ‘victory garden’ for about an hour before running off to buy seeds, more specifically flower seeds, which was not a part of a traditional ‘victory garden’ in the slightest. Leave it to Sirius Lupin to break tradition.
Draco laughed brightly, though not as bright as he could have. “Pretty well, I’ll say,” he said and squeezed Harry’s hand. “But Harry, we absolutely have to talk about—“
“Oh, so now you see that you should probably be there for your best mate’s house warming party,” Colin laughed breathily between kisses. If they had any real time to stay in bed, he would have drawn the white sheets up around them.
On the stove was a teakettle as promised, and Luna took out three mismatched cups to begin filling with hot water. “Father is out doing research in Lithuania on increased Wrackspurt activity in the countryside and how it’s been affecting some wizards and witches, so he won’t be joining us, but I am here. Please, sit.”
“You’re still missing the goddamn fucking point!” Theo reminded them. As Theo became more frustrated, his vocabulary became much more colorful. “Useless, all of you!”
After Draco turned two, Lucius had told her to get on fertility potions. He wanted more heirs, but most of all, Abraxas wanted more heirs. Maybe the old man could sense what a gigantic fag his grandson would turn out to be, but he was never fond of Narcissa’s miracle baby.
“I believe so. Grace was always a looser woman than I preferred for my boy…”
He was a huge softie in hiding.
“I’m sure that phone you just bought him will at least be a conversation piece when you see him next.”
It had taken a week, but Harry and Draco had finally integrated Grace into their home. Everyone involved knew it was temporary, but it was a place for her to lay her head and rest up before the baby came.
“Hey!” Sirius laughed, wrapping an arm around Harry to drag him back into a fatherly sort of cuddling. After all, they’d both grown up without any of that physical affection and intended to make up for that. “I was not the first one to bring Mary Jane to Marauder nights out. That was James.”
“You step with your toes first,” Draco went on, leg out. He demonstrated a casual walk across the room to Harry’s astonishment.
. But I meant what I said when I said that… thing I said.” About love. “It’s in the building.”
“I remember sharpening my pencils for hours in muggle school. There was a sharpener outside of the classroom, and whenever some kid would talk about their parents or make fun of my clothes, I would go outside and pretend I had to sharpen my pencils. That’s why my hands were so cracked and clammy when I was little, you know.”
He darted out across the street, narrowly avoiding being hit by a cab that was forced to screech to a halt.
“I don’t think anyone ever described me as that before you.”
“It’s not a bad thing,” he assured Draco quickly. Draco must’ve not known how vulnerable he looked in that moment or Harry was sure the Great Malfoy would be turning away and hiding his face. “I was thinking about holding hands with you,” Harry admitted.
“Wrong!” Draco yelled. The louder he was, the more correct he was.
“Daddy’ll buy you another,” Draco promised with a smart grin and Harry narrowed his eyes. “Such a beauty you are when you’re cross with me. Don’t you worry, I’ll keep you dressed in all the finest.”
“Why, because I kept you alive?”
“You…? You—!” he sputtered out. “What are you doing here?” Draco knew what he was doing there, but he didn’t want to believe it. He looked around to make sure nobody from school was there to see this. “Please tell me you just walked in here by coincidence.”
Overhead the owlery teemed with the winged creatures, some nipping at one another and creating a ruckus. The small owlery was a public one, a place for the famous witches and wizards of the world to receive letters without giving out a home address.
“Pansy!” Draco looked around to make sure nobody heard that.
“It wasn’t a direct owl,” Draco realized. “It was through—Merlin’s arse. We met through a magazine.”
Everyone laughed, even Percy begrudgingly. Draco told her about the little-known tailor he used and the conversation turned to a pleasant chat about clothes. Phew.
“Theo.” Draco turned around and put his hands on his friend’s shoulders. “I can handle this.” He was the one who had been in control of their fooling around. Draco had started it and he could have ended it whenever he wanted.
Draco couldn’t resist. “Macklemore
“Malfoy,” Maggie’s voice piped up again. “More visitors.”
Draco claimed the bed furthest from the window just as he had demanded, and Harry didn’t put up much of a fight about it. Both beds had the same blue-striped sheets.
“Father, please, I know what I’m doing. I didn’t realize you were so… passionate about real estate, but you’ve made your point.”
“I am going to have to tell them soon,” Draco said softly as if he hadn’t heard Harry at all. “And I will.” He looked up like it was a promise to Ron and Hermione more than Harry, exactly what Harry had been afraid of.
Even the distilled water could drown the old man; that would at least be satisfying to watch.
Draco actually sort of did not suffer as much as he thought he would.
“This isn’t my phone,” Harry said again, completely and utterly oblivious to Draco’s attempt at a good deed.
Just as Harry got to the door, he looked back and saw Dudley following him like a lost puppy. “One last thing. I promise.”
“Fifty,” Harry echoed exhaustedly.
A laugh burst out of Harry. “Of course, Your Grace.” It made sense that Pansy would watch HBO, actually.
While Draco had never used spider imagery in bed before, he was more than willing to make an exception.
She’d even tried to date a woman, once. Farrah had been a bubbly girl with soft hair and an easy smile, and Ginny’s only lesbian experience. It had come after a particularly bitter night running into Harry at a club with Draco draped around him, and there had been some serious drinking involved, but it still happened.
Ravenclaw, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor… It went on like this for a while longer.
I love this little story. :) Thanks so much for coming along with me on it and I hope you enjoy the ending! Prom time, woo!
“I don’t think you can cut opium,” Maggie laughed.
Draco’s face moved closer and closer to Harry’s crotch as if magnetized, eyes searching the deep ‘V’ that led to Harry’s prick. “And yet you’ve agreed not to touch yourself so you can be mine. How interesting.” Draco brought his thumb up, smearing the precome in circles around Harry’s head.
“You bet. See that coffee table-slash-cage? I’ve kept people in there for hours. With their consent, of course,” she said and couldn’t help her own bragging. Harry was a newbie to this whole scene and for once she got to introduce him to new things, no longer just the younger sister of his best mate. She recalled when they were dating thinking Harry was too shy to do much with her before finding out he was gay, but now she realized he was both: gay and a little shy.
At first all Harry heard was tapping. He turned over in Draco’s arms, nuzzling against him and away from the light of morning. It was then he heard the squawking.
The next words to leave Ron’s mouth were hateful ones. “Dolores Umbridge.”
Draco gave his side a pinch before wrapping an arm around Harry. “You haven’t seen them bite. I’m pretty sure I still have beak-shaped scars on my arms from when I was a child.”
“Oh. Shit.”
“No,” Harry said suddenly. “I won’t tell them. They should know. If they don’t know how special you are right from the beginning then you shouldn’t waste your time with them.”
“Nyquil! That’s what I need,” Draco found the right word. “Something to make me sleep through it. It keeps me to the bed so you won’t have me breathing on your things and I won’t be bored and snot-nosed all day.”
“I welcome you, faces old and new, to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As we return to these hallowed halls of learning we are reminded that knowledge takes us far, but can only take us so far without empathy. I remind you all to be kind to one another as we grow together, and know that the capable professors we have selected for this year will enforce this with the House Points system. You will earn points towards the Hogwarts Cup through academic and Quidditch performance as always, but in light of inter-house tensions we will also be awarding points for those who display feats of courage, humility, or decency amongst your fellow students.”
The stained-glass windows let in a flood of light that swept across the floor. People were seated in the pews, but every time Theo looked to see their faces, they turned their head away. Not even the religious figures could face Theo from the paintings hung above the lines of candles. It made Theo uneasy. “Hello?” he tried. All he got back was the echo of his voice off of the vaulted and gilded walls.
Draco chuckled, speeding up his pace so that the slapping noises were erratic now. “You don’t have permission yet, sweetling.” He broke to drag in a ragged breath. “Maybe if you ask nicely enough I’ll give it to you.”
Professor Sinistra was a witch of imposing stature, her long black hair swept back in a ponytail that looked tight enough to hurt. She was in her seventies, but that was relatively young for a Hogwarts professor. Neither Professors Potter nor Malfoy had been her student, having not taken Astronomy classes in their years. Draco hadn’t exactly gotten the warmest welcome from her, but he expected nothing less. She had been there for the Battle of Hogwarts.
He’d run off in such a rush that he’d forgotten all about his precious phone, as beat up as it was.
“We still need to owl the lawyers,” Lucius grumbled.
The fact that Sirius Lupin was amused enough by this to try and apply logic to this ridiculous situation indicated the backwards nature of it. “You’re missing the point,” Remus decided, not wanting to answer with ‘our adoptive daughter’s breasts, of course’! “I’ve been going about this wrong.”
It ran like a beauty.
It had somehow led to Harry giving him a messy kiss in the dark and Draco just going along with it. He was alive, and he’d be damned if he didn’t follow what made him happy after a war that nearly killed him.
“What?”
“Seven, eight… fuck, nine,” Harry strained out, trying to go as loud as he could and hitting a crack in his voice when he shouted: “Ten!”
Harry did a little spin to give Draco a full view of the outfit. The suitjacket was red with black accents and lapels and trousers, no tie but a black ribbon made into a loose bow over a white shirt finishing off the look.
“Do you want to work on filming this project, Potter?”
“I think I’m just going to try and get your godfathers sober.”
Lavender Brown and Cho Chang were amid debate over whether or not the Doctor Who finale was any good right beside Harry and seemed to have no idea he was listening in.
“And sign here, and here, and here… Flip the page over and sign on the line as well,” one of the Bagley sisters commanded Grace on the other side of dining room.
Harry gently put a hand on Ruth’s shoulder. “Ruth, we should walk away for a moment, okay? Let’s just cool down somewhere else,” Harry spoke in a voice low enough for only her to hear. Chris was clearly displeased.
“When was the last time you went out?”
“Let’s keep digging,” Harry suggested grimly. “We need to get out of here in time for you two to pick up Olivia for dinner.” He picked the shovel and started to dig west of the original hole.
“It’s better than nothing—oh, fuck.” Clacking heels were rapidly approaching down the hall. “Harry, you wear it. I’ll distract them.” Draco ducked out of the cloak and Harry crouched down low to the floor just in time for Narcissa Malfoy to come around the corner.
“Fine,” Draco growled. “Intrude away.”
“Aw, he promises,” Draco observed with a wheezy laugh. “You do try your best to be a good boy, don’t you?” His back muscles were tense, sweat dripping between his shoulderblades to keep up the repetitive motion of fucking himself into Harry.
Sirius gave Narcissa a hardy and friendly clap on the back. She wasn’t used to that level of affectionate roughness and the shock in her eyes showed it. “I’m proud of you, Cissy,” Sirius declared before giving her a kiss on the top of her head. It was refreshing to have relatives he liked. “You did the right thing and I believe I’ve converted you to my communist homosexual ways.”
“In my office.”
He’d saved up for his own personal computer in his room after a summer of babysitting, lawn-mowing, dog-walking, and any other odd job he could scrape up. His aunt and uncle would never deign to give his ungrateful nephew a brand-new gaming computer with a hard-drive nerds would drool over and the kind of graphics card that only existed in Harry’s wet dreams before he bought one for himself.
“You cannot seriously mean to tell me that you found the meaning of living life and it’s for Draco Malfoy?” Ron demanded in a softer but urgent tone.
Dinner was a relief when it came next, and Harry could hardly believe how good Draco’s cooking tasted. It made him want to try something, maybe the little things he’d have to make for the Dursleys like pancakes or even just popcorn or nachos. Something filling, to show Draco how he cared without having to say it.
Draco followed him with his eyes, trying to get inside that head of his. “You’re going to tell me that we’re soulmates and keep unpacking the fucking décor?” he asked, amused.
“I believe her,” Kennedy said firmly.
In that day of rest, however, they were allowed a marathon of crime stories in companionable silence. They were able to sit back, relax, and exist together peacefully. If anyone from their home town were able to see them they would have declared it a miracle or at least a divine occurrence.
If only Grace could get in the door, if she could be there, they’d know that they’d have to choose her.
“Yeah,” Harry said bashfully as the room of Weasleys—everyone from his ex-girlfriend to his best friend—smiled at him as if Hermione had definitely told them the story of how she managed to stay awake during the greatest pain a person could experience and how passed out at the sight of it.
Harry beamed. “They’re very comfortable.”
“And why can’t we apparate?” Harry asked quietly.
“I’ll… Keep that in mind.” Ron stepped away from his third-wheel position and towards the door. “Hermione needs me at home,” he said, waving a goodbye to them. “Or, rather, Rose does.” It was his turn to read the bedtime story.
There had even been straight dry-humping as Draco had expected.
“I like you,” Draco started with such sincerity it made Harry’s heart throb. “I like you bent over so I can see your knickers. Wouldn’t that be cute? You scrubbing my floors in black and white while I watch.”
“I have defeated the Thunder King and saved thousands of Pandaren from a lifetime of servitude and soul-shredding,” Draco referenced.
How was one supposed to ask Draco Malfoy out on a date? Or kiss Draco Malfoy? It was
The brunette shifted in her worn black flats. They would have to buy her new shoes, too. “Sorry that I’m early,” Olivia piped up. “I just wanted to make sure we wouldn’t miss the train.”
Draco’s smile doubled in size. “Yeah? Well, we’ve got a whole second floor to build, and I’ll need that input for the whole thing.”
“You,” said the younger man. “Self-obsessed, unrepentant deviant! It’s me! Bleremy!”
Draco licked his lips and considered the question. “I always knew I wanted to be in control, in charge. I think you saw me at my worst in that respect.” Draco couldn’t deny he’d always desired power over Harry especially, and was indeed worse in severity the closer Harry was in earshot for many years. “And then,” Draco pressed on even though his heart was beating faster at the thought of admitting this. “You saw me lose it. All of it. I had no say in what I was to do with my life once it was forfeit to The Dark Lord.” Draco swallowed and when he next spoke his tone was brighter. “I know I’ve done the messy business of apologizing, but have I ever thanked you?”
Sirius laughed, mostly because he had no idea. “We can figure it out! You’re a genius and I’m an ex-con. I’m surprised we’re not already hooked up with a dealer.”
Kingsley wanted plenty of shots of the actual online messages between the lovers, shots of Harry and Draco on the road, and a voiceover of Harry explaining what the show was all about.
Cho frowned. “I do love my Doctor and River dynamic.”
“There’s one specific example,” Harry offered before allowing Draco to put his arms back around him. What were a couple shoves between co-hosts?
As the only Slytherin on staff, it was Draco’s duty to his house and the students in it to watch over them. He was glad the Potions classroom was nearby the Slytherin dorms, just in case he needed to be reached by a Prefect.
This way of living he’d chosen wasn’t perfect, but it felt right. There were things to be done and someone to cherish who cherished him in return.
“You don’t have much to be worried about physically, Harry. You’re near underweight, but not at any risk,” Draco gave it to him straight, figuring Harry didn’t need sugarcoating right now. “I say that as a Healer, I point out, because I don’t want to encourage or give you any kind of complex about your weight. As long as you’re eating healthily,” Draco said with a pointed glare at the fridge. “Your body would carry any weight well. It’s your stress that makes you ache, I can tell you have pains just from the way you’re sitting wound so tight. You’re a handsome man, Harry, haven’t I told you that?”
Harry had a strong feeling that Lucius’ brand of ‘persuasion’ was definitely terrifying and life-altering. He played it safe and minimal like being a rogue in WoW taught him. “Okay.”
He’d been betrayed. The world had promised him a fresh start with a caring mystery man and laughed in his face when he asked nicely for it.
The first thing Harry saw was a pair of black and white dress shoes that made him smile. Shoes had never really made him smile before, but knowing it was Draco Malfoy wearing such trendy spats tickled him in an unexpected way. Things only got better as he looked up. Draco was a dream in green, harkening back to the house color of his youth to make him look all the more powerful and imposing.
