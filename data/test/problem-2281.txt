As he thought about what might be happening to Draco in that bathroom and the lights began to flicker and the music started to skip, he thought that, depending on what he discovered when he opened that door, she might be very disappointed because he was fairly certain that he might've actually reached the level of rage where
"Bloody hell, Malfoy! Are you insane or do you have a death wish?!" Leave it to Weasley to forget to hate him when he was impressed by something. Draco smirked and decided to take what he could get.
Draco rolled his eyes at his stupid friend. He really hoped he wasn't somehow wrapped up in all this but his gut was telling him there might be a connection. Blaise had overshared one too many fantasies about the day that Ginny Potter might finally grow a pair and ask for a divorce... He just could not imagine that she wouldn't have turned to him after what was apparently a shite-show of an anniversary dinner.
"Wotcher, Harry!" Mundungus Fletcher smiled through the bandaging and Harry beamed back as he took the seat opposite him.
it. I want that more than anything, Draco," he said, breathlessly, and Draco felt his own breath catch. "But Draco, if I lose you after that again in a way where you can't come back... I don't know if
Draco looked off into the distance, a million questions rising while a hundred little answers clicked into place.
"Very nice work!" said Hermione from his left. "Hey, Draco? Will you be joining us in the dueling club tomorrow? It's the first meeting of the year and Harry will be leading. You could help get the younger Slytherins involved and maybe help teach them some things!"
"Astoria. I am rich." He blinked, dazed. "I am ridiculously, stupidly wealthy just off of inheritance alone. I simply do not understand why you wouldn't just tell me. I would have paid for the wedding."
"Yea, we thought that great stupid brute was going to kill you!" Wila pouted and crossed her arms, petulantly.
Draco reached out to take his hand in his, leading them to sit side-by-side under a large beech tree.
"Well, forgive me if I had reason to doubt. Ginny, we need to leave. Now," he said, looking around at all the eyes now on them.
" he said as he panicked and wandlessly buried Harry under a pile of pillows. Harry wanted to protest but the voice that followed made him instinctively reach for his wand!
"Shite! What time is it?" He asked, casting a quick tempus and scrambling to stand -- a move he would soon regret as he was forced to haul it to the nearest bathroom and
"What, you think she'd poison you?" Harry asked, eying the tray of food sideways, too, just as relieved as Draco when nothing happened.
"Here! Suck on this!" he encouraged the woman who looked back at him with wide, terrified eyes. "Do it!"
Harry shook his head. "No, I'd had my suspicions that something was amiss long before that. Owl correspondences that I too willingly made excuses for... I'm just very good at avoiding things like that..."
"Shh-shh-shh. It's ok, Harry. You'll be ok. I want you to move on, ok? You'll find someone who can love you in all of the ways you deserve to be loved and you'll have little green-eyed babies with messy hair who grow up to be great like their father and you'll forget all about me."
"It's time to put on a show!" Pansy pointed her thumb towards the stage where the latest group of muggles were butchering a
He groaned at his reflection in the mirror -- he looked like death, too. The bloodshot eyes staring back at him didn't belong there and neither did the stench of stale booze oozing from his pores.
At first, Draco had assumed that marrying into the pureblood (albeit very loosely so) Weasley family meant that Harry would be subject to the traditional soul bonding vows and that thought had served as even further motivation to stay away and let Harry enjoy his life.
he'd said. Draco had thought it all a bunch of rubbish at the time but, maybe there was something to it, after all.
She sighed. "Now I've gotta deal with you getting over a broken heart from Draco Fucking Malfoy." She rolled her eyes. "Well, at least I know I've got one thing that he doesn't."
but, the way Harry stared back at him, as if Draco were his whole world, made him take a deep breath and exhale shakily as he lined up with his hole.
Seeing Malfoy and Narcissa in Madam Malkin's relit a spark in Harry that he hadn't realized had gone out in the first place. Watching Sirius fall through that veil mere weeks before had left him feeling barely there. While being at the Burrow had helped, the constant news of disappearances on top of his grief could barely keep away the numbness that threatened to take over his mind and limbs. He was sure the dementor fog that seemed to constantly permeate the air these days didn't help but, as it were, it just felt too overwhelming to think about the heartbreaking sadness of losing his godfather, the soul crushing guilt that came with knowing that it was all his fault (no matter what anyone said to the contrary), or the monumental weight of knowing that it was all up to him to somehow end it all when time and time again he couldn't even save the people he cared about. Numbness was easier.
They never pushed him past that. He was pretty sure that none of them wanted to hear the real answers to that question because it'd be too hard to pack it all back up.
What? Was he saying he wanted this? Furthermore, was he saying he'd want more than a shag? Draco blinked at him, befuddled and slightly too drunk to think about all these feelings right now.
Draco snorted. "You thought coming back to a literal war zone where you risked your life -- no, excuse me -- sacrificed your life, watched people you knew and cared about be murdered, and killed a man.... would be peaceful?" he asked, incredulously.
"That's correct," he said with a charming smile that only seemed to annoy the gray haired man more than anything but he let him pass, all the same.
"Well, well, well, Borgin, my old friend. What unfortunate business... Now this is clearly enough evidence to send you to Azkaban for a rather...
The sound of footsteps interrupted his thoughts and he was immediately on his feet, wand drawn and raised at the ready.
"How much did you give him?" he asked as she lackadaisically handed him the handful of hairs she'd plucked.
?" he stalled, having no desire at all to be involved in the desecration of Albus Dumbledore's grave. He knew he only had about a 50/50 percent chance of surviving this mess at all, but, the last thing he wanted to think about was what
"Yep, I think so. But how about lunch on me before you and Teddy head off to his playdate with Victore?"
"Nuh-un-un," Harry teased. "You tell me how come you're here first and I'll tell you about the map."
Blaise Zabini," he said as he gathered his searched bag and left the poor boy gawking bemusedly in his wake.
Harry gave him a smirk and a salute as he walked backwards out the bedroom door. Draco smiled, warmly, and shook his head.
"Isn't he great?! It's the Great Ranzuli!" He laughed nervously. "The greatest magician I've ever seen! If you'd like to see his next show, he'll be on in the square at 6 o'clock!"
For anyone that's read Draco Hearts Spice Girls and Harry Potter, you'll see that we've finally reached the point of its epilogue! Hope you're enjoying!
Yes, I've been accepted to 5 different muggle universities with top notch psychology programs. I've also been granted the St. Mungo's apprenticeship for mind healing and plan to do both concurrently with hopes of marrying the 2 in a completely revolutionary form of mind healing.
," he answered brusquely before exasperatedly getting back to matters at hand: "First, I travel all this way and you conveniently leave out the fact that the maniac who's doing all of this is looking for a wand? Then, you tell me that the Elder Wand is
Harry smiled, contentedly, finally feeling like all of the old hatchets were buried, the bridges crossed. They were going to be ok.
Draco smiled wickedly as Blaise ran a hand down his chest before leaning down to nip at his waistband with his teeth.
Potter was blessedly silent for a good 30 seconds while he chewed his artery clogging meal and then: "Malfoy, may I ask what made you decide to become an Auror?"
, possessed the thing! And, now, you summon some old, creepy house elf to fetch us a career criminal?! Potter, explain!"
"Wha--" he started to ask before the ridiculous things they were saying started to click into place. He tried to keep his voice even as a mixture of panic and anger began to bubble in his core. "Are you saying... that the blonde bloke that I was with... the one who was so pissed he could barely stand up proper or string together two full, coherent sentences... Are you saying that he went to the restroom alone with a complete stranger?"
of all people, might be the only person who seems to believe in me on this particular venture. My friends think that I
Draco suddenly felt incredibly stupid for never once considering that Potter, the man he had always labeled lucky and undeserving of all the love and attention and favor that he got since starting Hogwarts, was actually abused for practically all of his life before he met him. He felt like absolute shite.
"I will find her, Ron. I don't care what it takes--" He grit his teeth and fought back the burning tears that threatened to escape. "I promise."
bit of the question. He was just about to press the matter when Draco grimaced, and shot him an apologetic look that did not bode well before he continued.
Harry wasn't surprised at all when the aurors showed up but Draco faltered when the team filed in quickly and with precision, wasting no time surrounding the room despite the darkness.
"Draco, I've been letting you play dress up in my clothes since you were four." And, as if to prove it, she reached into her own hair and removed her ornate, floral crystal hair-comb and placed it in his hair. He stared at himself, awed. A reflection of the most beautiful person he knew. "I never cared that you were gay. That part has always been more of your father's hangup but that's only because he doesn't know that I know what all he got up to in
Yaxley had more control as he fucked Harry's mouth slowly, relishing the way the movement of his cock in Harry's slack jaw made drool dribble out the corner of his mouth and pool on the arm of the chair. He carded a hand through the messy black hair in a way that could've been mistaken for gentle and not mocking were the circumstances not so cruel.
and also ensure that Dumbledore would be the master of his own death and that the legend of the Elder Wand would die with him, and so with it, the destruction, chaos, and greed that has also been known to come with it."
Harry's eyes widened and the heat rushed to his face at the realization. He wanted to melt into the floor but Draco was doing that thing where he bit his lip and his eyes sparkled as he tried his hardest not to laugh and it just made Harry want to laugh out loud. And so he did. And then so did Draco and it was the most beautiful sound. Harry smiled endearingly.
Finally, Harry opened his eyes to watch messy red hair bob up and down, his wife slurping enthusiastically along his length.
Harry bit his tongue. He wanted to point out that of course he had meant to put him on the spot, that's what everyone seemed inclined to do. Instead, he simply said: "It's ok, professor, really."
"Alexandra!" She started and he shot her an apologetic smile as she regained her composure. "I'm glad I caught you before you left--"
Merrywhip looked as if he might press the issue but Draco felt the carefully contained anger that he'd done such a bang-up job of containing all term come to a peak.
He couldn't deny that he was nervous and felt unsure but, somehow, the fact that Draco knew to ask just made him want him more -- even if just a little bit more. "Maybe just the jeans for now," he compromised and pulled his jeans down so that the only barrier was his pants which were already soaked through in one spot with precum. Draco nodded and followed suit, lowering his pajama bottoms to reveal gray, silk pants that were also wet with precum. Harry was about to roll his eyes at the fancy silk but as he lowered himself back down between Draco's thighs with nothing but the thin, wet fabrics between their hard lengths, he was overcome with sensation -- the friction more exquisite than anything he'd ever felt before.
Draco had convinced himself that the odds of encountering the man during his short visit were slim to none, and even still, he'd mentally tried to run down the list of all his long forgotten evasive Auror maneuvers,
Harry and Anavi both turned towards Draco, shocked by both his words and the sudden shift of energy in the room as he paced back and forth. Draco's patience had been wearing thin from the moment the woman had started talking but, now, he looked absolutely livid. Harry was surprised when the furniture began to shake and, for once, it wasn't him doing it.
Snape practically growled. "Draco, I'm not sure what Lucious and those two were up to but the very thought of violating teenage boys is repugnant and unforgivable! I really wish you would have told me. I would have made certain that they met their demise much sooner."
He looked around to make sure they were out of earshot. "Look, I don't have time to explain, but I think I know where Krafft is taking Draco and why." Hermione gasped and Ron shifted into Auror mode, ready to act.
Draco smiled and kissed him on the forehead. "I've got friends in strange places, love. I'm not going anywhere."
Harry shook his head. It was an odd thing to make it out on the other side of a war, fairly unscathed, when so many others had met a fate much worse than one's own. Ron's humor had made him think that he'd somehow been impervious to all of the lingering feelings of survivor's guilt that plagued Harry daily. Now he could see that that had been foolish to think and maybe Ron could relate more than most people he knew. It felt good to know that someone else got it. "Yea, I'll probably spend the rest of my life trying to convince myself that it was all good enough, too. We'll go down in history as heroes but how do we ever convince ourselves that it was all worth it? That it wouldn't have been better to have just lain down and be put out of our misery?"
Harry thought he had prepared himself for this. He'd repeatedly told himself that it was over all week and he had accepted it. He had even just
"It's good to see you back within these walls -- although, I must admit, I hate that it is under such tragic and unexpected circumstances."
Draco shot up, shocked as he took in the full training room for the first time. Ron, Hermione, and a very tired and bedraggled looking Percy Weasley were sat in the viewing gallery while Stevens and Harry's most trusted team of Aurors scrambled to get the tied up Sebastian Krafft into immediate custody. Draco's jaw dropped, aghast, and he punched him in the arm.
Harry frowned as he studied his reflection in the window of the lone empty cart he'd found on the Hogwarts Express. He was still dressed in the ministry PR rep's approved wardrobe since, according to Penelope Periwinkle, he '
"Oh, every day. Not just about surviving but keeping those I loved safe. And I think the scariest part was when I got captured and I was sure it was all over and thought I had failed them all."
"So the black market... Ok everyone, now would be the time to reach out to your CIs and let them know to be on the lookout for any movement of Celestina Warbeck records! Time to catch this guy before anyone else gets hurt -- or worse..." he added soberly to murmurs of agreement as people gathered their things and prepared to disperse for the day to track down leads and wrap up existing cases.
Draco, perhaps sensing his nervousness, took Harry's hand in his again and led him to the bed. He climbed gracefully atop the fluffy bedding, pulling Harry along with him.
Harry had played his role. He had found the horcruxes, rode off with the dragon, bested the evil death eaters, vanquished the villain and saved the world. He had been naive enough to think that it might all end there, only to find that people then needed him to play the role of the war hero and the symbol of hope and change in the aftermath.
you manage to learn wandless magic?" he asked, remembering Harry's earlier unique display of skill. "You never seemed particularly...
"So, it just turned into a 'no magic' household?" he asked, dubiously. "What could've possibly made a wizarding family make such a huge shift?"
"Now that's better," Draco said, appreciatively, as Harry opened his mouth to show that he was good and hadn't swallowed without permission. "Is that what you wanted, Harry? Is that what you really wanted to taste?"
The hairs stood on the back of his neck as the words registered and realization hit: He hadn't heard a peep from Ginny since their row.
He walked quietly past the drawing room, hoping to catch a glimpse of the conversation between the elders. He paused just outside the door.
Draco's eyes gleamed and he bit his lip, amused. "Are you sure you didn't say something else?" He raised an eyebrow.
That Friday morning found Auror Jeffrey Jansen with an extra pep in his step as he apparated onto the sleepy, snowy London side street and headed towards Trafalgar square. Today was the day! The day that Harry Potter finally got his comeuppance!
So far, Sebastian had evaded the Aussie Aurors but it had only been a few hours and, with the prick no longer able to portkey all over the world at will, their odds of catching him quickly were good.
he whispered low over the wand and spun in place as gold dust spun from its tip and covered the length of the street, clinging to three sets of magical footprints.
Potter groaned but Draco just pulled him closer, wrapped his arms around his neck, and began a slow two-step despite the fact that "Baby One More Time" by Britney Spears was hardly the right song for a slow two-step. But it didn't matter. He just wanted Harry close to him.
Harry sucked determinedly, gagging proudly as Draco began to thrust into his throat in rhythm to the fingers stroking his prostate. He was so close! Harry took him as deep as he could go, easing up only when he felt Draco's balls tighten.
He reached inside of his cloak and handed her his ID with the Elderberry address where, for all intents and purposes where the ministry was concerned, was his place of residence.
The little Slytherin girl pushed the boy towards them and Draco watched as the Gryffindor held his head up high and walked purposefully to their table despite the fact his hands were shaking at his side.
"You look beautiful!" he said, holding out an arm for her. She blushed as she grabbed ahold of his bicep and they disapparated.
Ginny shook her head. "Oh, Harry. You don't have to apologize. I wish I would've known what was going on but, Merlin! You've had so much to happen to you on your quest to save the world... And no time to process any of it! How could anyone have expected you to have it figured out?" Harry felt the lump again in his throat. "I forgive you and I love you and I just want you to be happy. I don't know anyone at all who deserves to be happy as much as you do!" she said through a new round of tears and he stopped fighting his own, letting them roll down his cheeks freely.
They had learned that, because of their efforts, his team had moved quickly to arrest Anavi Chopra, Marietta Poles, and, most surprisingly of all, Benjamin Vermont, the waiter at La Sirène, in connection with the kidnapping. The MLE was already in the works with law enforcement in Australia to apprehend Sebastian Krafft who was still at large.
"Right! The beau means we're all business, now, right, Malfoy? You made that much very clear the last time we met. Well that's just great because I'm in the market to
"No it woul--" He grimaced when Harry's elbow met his ribs. "Yes, very happy," he said through gritted teeth.
Hello, lovely readers! I hope that you are enjoying and just wanted to take a moment to let you know that you are all on my mind in these uncertain times. Hope that you are all safe, well, and that all the fanfiction out there might bring you some joy :-).
This chapter is the reason for the E rating 👀. If you've been reading thus far, then you know that I like to create visuals so you might not be surprised that the NSFW bits are very... vivid... If you would really rather not read all the juicy parts and would rather just take a wild guess at what happens, I've used ********** to indicate where you should stop reading.
Anavi Chopra found herself sat in her drawing room that Saturday afternoon with eyes nervously glued to the floo.
"Harry, I'm going to ask you this kindly and I need you to answer truthfully before you really piss me off. Where. Is. Ginny Potter?" he asked, slowly, and the goosebumps spread up Harry's arms as the full reality of the situation hit him.
he know? Regardless, the crystal chandelier was rattling dangerously above their heads and Draco needed to calm down. He reached out and pulled him nearer, squeezing him against his side. "It's ok, love."
Distracted was an understatement. He kept reliving every moment of the previous day on a loop, trying to understand how things had gotten to where they did.
"And of you that can, how many were directly taught how to cast it by Potter?" Since everyone in the room besides the Slytherins were members of Dumbledore's Army, they kept their arms raised. "And those who actually had to use it in the Battle at Hogwarts?" No one put their hands down.
He had felt so compelled to send the invitation after their run-in this afternoon (for which he blamed Teddy and his overwhelming cuteness, entirely. Seriously, what mortal being could resist the pining that comes with watching Draco Malfoy hold a toddler?!) -- but now he was kicking himself for his stupid Gryffindorian impulses as his mind ran through the list of things that could go wrong.
Harry cautiously sat just close enough on the couch that they could feel each other shift without actually touching, the proximity already enough to set Harry's every nerve on fire!
"I don--" He stopped short as the sound of blood curdling wails made him whip around towards the entrance of his office.
Malfoy gaped at her for a moment. Finally, he found his bearings. "No, quite frankly I don't see the point. Apparently all we really need in life is
Draco cradled his chin with his hand, forcing Harry to return his gaze. He narrowed his eyes, recognizing that look that suggested Harry was struggling with the type of thoughts that usually made him consider doing something stupid.
about the calculated way that man turned your life upside down this winter felt remedial! And you mustn't forget that Ginny and Blaise said he put up a real fight. Don't underestimate him, Harry."
Draco's tongue swept at Harry's bottom lip and he parted them to give him entry. He couldn't help the moan that escaped as Draco's tongue expertly explored his mouth and he dared to do the same and he was surprised to find that the man tasted sweet like treacle tart. His cock twitched and he was just about to ask if maybe they should seriously rethink the whole "no sex" thing when the fireplace in the far corner of the room came to life with bright green flames. Draco quickly broke apart.
Harry was shaking with frustration. So he didn't even know this person. Just a rumored cure for potion ingredients that not a single lab test detected from a phantom bloke which -- who knows, could actually make the symptoms worse.
He planted a shy kiss on the tip to get over the hump. It gave him the courage to try open mouth kisses along the shaft and then to finally let his tongue explore the perfect cock in front of him, experimentally lapping up the precum that had already beaded there. Harry looked up to see dark eyes watching him, patiently, mouth slightly agape as if Draco were holding his breath in anticipation. At last, he let his lips wrap fully around his cock, carefully minding his teeth as he took him in further. Draco groaned and slowly thrust deeper, filling Harry's mouth until he touched the back of his throat. He was big and Harry had to work to relax his throat to try and take him in even further. He inhaled the intoxicating musky scent that was Draco as the fine, blonde hair there tickled his nose. The scent, the velvety smooth feel of the hard cock on his tongue, and the exquisite sounds coming out of Draco's mouth as he thrust back and forth were almost enough to push Harry over the edge, alone.
Draco got introduced to Muggle Pop Music in DHSGAHP and discovered he had a surprising affinity for the stuff (pop Divas in particular). Harry burnt him a mixtape as a farewell (it was 2001, people still did that lol).
"And she would also be able to get close enough to Robards to imperius him..." Draco stroked his chin in thought. "Darn, I always liked that witch."
"Potter will wrap this up and, when he does, where will he go? Where is some place he'd expect me to think of to meet him?"
"Yep, and I ordered pizza," Harry said, pointing to the box on the coffee table. Draco eyed it sceptically when he handed him a slice but he took it without protest. Harry chuckled when he nibbled a bit and the look on his face turned from mistrustful to pleased.
Harry twisted up his mouth in thought. "I don't know, but..." He reached out unexpectedly to take Draco by his good hand. "C'mon."
Jansen smiled smugly to himself as he walked into his favorite coffee shop and joined the queue. He was just fantasizing about handing Harry over to the dementors when he was stirred from his thoughts by an annoyed brunette barista.
Hermione placed a hand on his shoulder and smiled, knowingly. "Draco told Pansy about a time when you two carved your initials into a tree on a hill. She took a guess that it might be the hill by Malfoy Manor," she explained.
"Harry, I've never experienced anything like that before in my life! That was the sexiest thing I've ever..." He paused, shaking his head in disbelief. "Merlin, I'm lucky." Awe reflected in his eyes as he stared back into Harry's.
"Is that what that was supposed to have been like?" he finally said when he felt like he'd gained some sense of composure.
A flash of light briefly illuminated a hooded figure among the trees. Moments later, the snap of a twig told him that the figure was coming toward him rather than fleeing. He braced himself and crouched in wait.
" Harry frowned as it clicked but then he chuckled. He waved a hand dismissively. "Whatever it is, it can wait till tomor--"
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
He tried not to dwell too long on the thought as he wound his way through dazzling rows of colorful peonies, geraniums, fox glove, cosmos, and, of course, some of the more eye-catching magical flora and fauna. It wasn't long before he'd made it to the heart of the garden.
"Because we both know that if I go through the front, I can get a better gauge of what's going on in the rest of the house."
He was already trying not to choke on his guilt when a barn owl flew through the open doors and zoomed past them, dropping something green into Draco's lap and abruptly flying away.
Draco suddenly found it hard to feel as annoyed with Walden. All he'd wanted to do through any of it, himself, was to protect mother. The thought of being a 10-year-old on the run, trying to avoid death and protect your mother sounded like a particular type of hell that made his heart beat in his throat.
Draco rolled his eyes and ignored the question about his peculiar muggle wear to get straight to the point:
Draco was just concluding that the boy was taking the piss when Potter looked down at his robes and frowned.
"Well, well, well," a familiar drawl greeted him. "I never thought I'd see the day, Potter! You almost look like a proper wizard!"
She had already chewed her fingernails down to stubs and her carpet looked slightly worn from where she'd intermittently taken to pacing. It had been hours since Robards had informed her of Potter and Malfoy's escape from Appleby and she had been stationed by the floo, hoping for a more
"Not when some of us have been waiting fifteen long years for you boys to sort yourselves out." Harry's jaw dropped when he realized that the cheeky comment came from Headmistress McGonagall. She fixed him with a stern brow in challenge and he smiled back, sheepishly.
There was really only one area left in his life that felt discordant now... Right on cue, his heart jumped with a little jolt of panic at the thought he'd been avoiding for months now. He worried his lip as he looked to the writing desk in the corner and sighed. He'd hoped that he wouldn't be the one to have to make the first move but, of course, there was only one person better at the perpetual game of wizard's chess than he or even his father and, with the wedding ever approaching...
He'd spent the better part of two hours directing all of his will at a loose stone, trying and failing to make it float wandlessly. He would've liked to have blamed it on his hands being bound behind his back but, the fact of the matter was: he was completely powerless without his wand.
The past couple of weeks had gifted Draco so many moments that brought him joy to think about, even if they did now come with a pang of sadness. He now possessed a whole reservoir of memories that he'd never dreamed imaginable: memories of times when he'd made Harry Potter smile, or laugh, or call his name... or cum... The thought of taking away the pure, innate affection that came with those thoughts seemed disturbingly like being emotionally obliviated.
"Draco, what Ollivander said about us both being the possessors of both wands and rewriting the rules of wandlore and it being miraculous that the wand even recognized me as its master when you technically hadn't lost that one to me or that your wand still worked for you without having to win it back but simply because I gave it to you..."
Draco stilled and placed his forehead on Harry's while he adjusted to the cock inside him. Draco nuzzled his nose against Harry's.
Harry swallowed as he realized that he really had put himself into another unnecessary, stupid situation because Malfoy really could take advantage of this situation. He didn't know why, but he really wanted to trust Draco.
He stared back fiercely at the man who had been his mentor but now held so much disdain in his eyes. He had been trying to protect her secrets but if it helped...
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
Harry looked back up to find cautious gray eyes. "You wear glasses?" he asked, immediately feeling stupid that that was the only thing he could think of to say.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Surely you can't be that blind, Potter. But what about you? Tell me about the sexual conquests of the wizarding savior."
Harry palmed at his weary eyes and tossed the latest Australian MLE report aside in defeat. So many pages of unhelpful information, he thought, as he looked around at the explosion of case files sprawled across Draco's froufrou French furniture and covering nearly every square inch of the floor.
He smiled and shook his head at the irony. It had taken him letting go of all of his pride to become a man that he could be proud of. He thought about the unwavering trust that Harry now gave him freely when there was a time when he'd rightfully been afraid to let him out of his sights for more than a class period. Now that he'd earned it, he'd never trade that trust for anything in the world.
Malfoy stared back for a long moment, something intense but unsaid in his eyes. He didn't break his gaze into Harry's green eyes as he lifted the map and handed it over to Harry. He felt goosebumps as their fingers brushed when he reached for the map and swallowed nervously as he felt his dick start to harden. He turned his head to break the spell and pretended to study the flames in the fireplace.
Draco threw in more floo powder and the flames opened up into a dressing room where a number of people in glitter and sequins and wearing a shite ton of makeup and wigs were chatting merrily.
He really did want it to work. Being together was what Ginny wanted and what Ron wanted and what Mrs. Weasley wanted and what the public wanted and what he wanted to want. He was all set to accept a life of faking it when Ginny ended it a few weeks before the start of term. She was right, of course. It wasn't fair for either of them for him to try to force something that wasn't there. "There just are no fireworks between us," she had said.
They walked into a cozy yet dark sitting room. There were shelves full of more ominous looking books and jars around the room. A fire roared in the hearth, an empty portrait frame hung above the fireplace with fresh lilies carefully placed underneath it on the mantle. A pot of tea sat on the coffee table and Harry noticed an abandoned green blanket on a comfortable looking chair with an array of books spread out on the floor before it.
"Surely you've figured out by now why sex requires so many mental backflips on my end now that I could probably medal in the muggle Olympics? Or that I hardly ever initiate because I refuse to feel like your
still haven't figured out how to wrap my head around it, yet." he admitted, looking somewhat dumbstruck.
Harry paused between bites, his brow furrowing as he really took in his fiancé for what felt like the first time since they'd sat down. Draco looked paler and more fretful than usual and, what was worse, he hadn't even touched his fish and chips.
"Gawain, thank you for your support and guidance over the years and I wish you the best in your upcoming retirement. I only hope to make you, the team, and all of you who came out to support me today proud. Thank you."
to know about the blood curse that ties them which could only mean a member of one of the families..."
firsthand, even if muggle, sounded fascinating but THEE question that had plagued him more than he'd ever care to admit over the past few years since his trial was gnawing at him: Why did Potter care? A thought started to niggle at his mind but he squashed it before it could take root and forced himself to stay in the moment.
"Hey, are you getting off or not, mate?" asked a grumpy wizard at the front of the queue waiting to board the lift.
There was one of the whole Slytherin gang in the stands at the first task of the Triwizard competition, laughing and joking and sporting
He sounded so genuine that Draco felt his chest warm. He bowed his head, smiling shyly. He didn't realize he'd wanted Harry to be proud of him but apparently he did. The feeling was better than a warm cup of Rosemerta's finest butterbeer on a cold day.
He peaked into a nearby window display and the face reflected back at him frowned at its own small, blue, close-set eyes and strong, wide, angular chin. He was grateful, however, that the polyjuice
"Harry, I think we've got to talk about sex before you drive me mad," he said from his position atop Harry, leaning in to capture his bottom lip and tugging once more before he sat up. Harry moaned and reluctantly sat up, too. "What do you want, Harry?"
A moment later, a large sledgehammer came smashing through the window, sending glass flying everywhere. Harry belatedly hoped that Bob, his muggle neighbor, wouldn't miss it and silently prayed that his garage door had been open. Oh well -- there was always
"To deliver Potter for his trial," Robards said as he pressed the button. "Potter will face justice."
Harry's heart jumped at the use of his given name but he was more concerned about the lump forming in his throat at the sincerity of the words spoken from the gray-eyed boy. He looked away, mortified, when a strangled noise escaped his throat and his eyes began to burn of their own accord. He hadn't cried through any of this and he was afraid that, if he did, the dam would break and he would drown.
If you're used to just going to the newest updated chapter on posting days then make sure you read the previous chapter as well. I posted twice today since I decided to break the planned chapter into two.
"You can't fall apart right now, Potter. What kind of supposed savior are you? Don't you know you at least have to wait until after the war to crack up? Honestly!" he said, rolling his eyes. Now that sounded more like Draco Malfoy.
Harry stared back at him, pupils blown wide under the bill of his muggle cap and mouth just slightly agape as Draco brought his hand to his front and slowly,
He swallowed around the lump in his throat, "Well... I suppose... You probably know that I am getting married?"
"I thought of you as that fragile boy from right after the war who needed me." Her voice broke again but she pulled it together, glancing around the room and remembering they had an audience. "I didn't think you'd be ok without me and so I ended things with Blaise and came to be with you. But I found out soon enough that I was wrong. You were... different... after Malfoy. Sure, you were hurt but you were stronger, somehow! You could've been ok! You could've healed! You probably could've sought him out and tried again right after he divorced that thieving arse girl! But, by then, things were so complicated for both of us..."
Draco downed the contents of the vial while he stared after the man now sauntering towards the lifts, auror robes draped casually over one shoulder and fitted jeans hugging his arse just right... Steam poured from his ears and he was rejuvenated with a burst of fresh energy just as Potter disappeared from sight.
Draco fought the lump in his throat and croaked out a laugh instead, "Please, the closest my parents have ever come to acceptance was when I told father I had taken up ballroom dancing at the ball houses when I was living in New York. ...Of course, he had no idea that the term means something
He had to give it to his best friend: When he flooed her last night to say that he needed her charm, she didn't hesitate. Not even when he insisted that she only take muggle transportation so that she could avoid the portkeys. He didn't want anything placing her here when shite hit the fan. He'd much prefer the ministry think she was still sitting pretty in Paris.
There was still a hint of pink on her cheeks when she reached Harry but she disguised it with a smug smile.
"We have been giving it a fair go, mate. Got his face out among our lot and in all the muggle papers. Problem is, most of the good samaritans who reach out with tips refuse to dob on him once we get there, ay?" The other man nodded his agreement. "Somehow, he walks away with them thinking he's just some misunderstood larrikin."
"I want my mother back! The one person I could count on during the darkest of times!" he pleaded. "I have light now, mother! I finally have
"Well, sometimes people can surprise you, mate." Sebastian shrugged. "Come on, put that down and let's go inside. You've had a shock, let's get you some more tea -- I know how you Brits like tea."
Draco laughed and then hid his face in his free hand. "Yes, let's just pretend I was preparing you for the world and not just being a complete little shite."
He rolled his eyes. If she thought that was too much then she really wasn't going to like the next ask.
admiration there. Of course, now knowing that he's a sociopathic lunatic, I'm a little wary of whatever the real cause for admiration was, but, it was certainly there."
"Think of it this way, mate," Ron clapped a heavy hand on his shoulder while wrangling the curly, redheaded 8-month-old in his other arm. "You stare down the dark arts every day, what's ten minutes in front of the wizarding elite and a gallery full of press?"
with his posh robes and chiseled jaw -- next to a giggling and fawning Ginny Potter. Harry felt as if ice slowly spread through his veins as he watched the slight linger of her fingertips on his arm as she laughed and the light finally,
Harry was set to have his Wizengamot trial tomorrow afternoon and, as of now, Draco didn't have a leg to stand on in his defense besides:
"What? I'm just saying, The Most Noble House of Black has historically been known as an excellent lay." Harry's eyes went wide and he covered Teddy's ears, pretending to be scandalized. She simply shrugged and walked off casually towards the restaurant.
Draco sighed. "Potter, almost everything you just listed was examples of me being shitty to you. Just because it blew up in my face and ended up with you on top, doesn't mean it wasn't shitty..." There was sadness in his eyes. "Doing
Harry laughed. He would never admit it to anyone but he was really starting to miss their banter. Was Hogwarts really Hogwarts without Draco Malfoy barbs? "Is that the best you can come up with? You're losing your touch, Malfoy."
"But Sebastian still needs the wand and he's not going to give her to you unless you hand it over," she continued. "Why won't you just give it to him already and end this?!"
"Who here, besides our professor, has seen Potter's stag patronus?" he asked the room at large. He raised his hand and slowly all of his classmates followed suit.
Harry felt all at once touched and overwhelmed as he looked out at the loved ones gathered around the scenic knoll that was he and Draco's hill. There wasn't room enough for seating, even. Instead, they stood, beaming, shoulder-to-shoulder, each holding a Weasley Wizarding Wheezes Ever Burning Sparkler in hand. It was perfect.
Harry had gotten so used to thinking of oral sex as something taboo that he hadn't even thought about receiving it! But, now, the thought of Draco's warm mouth on him made his cock grow inexplicably and impossibly harder.
"It's totally wicked!" Teddy agreed with way too much vigor for this hour of the day. Draco grinned fondly while noting that
They sat like that in silence for long moments as the little pile of glass accumulated on the bench as it was removed. When Potter finally spoke again, it was with a gentleness that matched his efforts.
It wasn't until the second time that the snogging turned into frotting that Draco finally pulled away breathless.
She looked a little taken aback but, with another loud sniff, she walked over and sat down next to him. "I was just with Padma and I stopped to talk with Justin and she must've kept walking and gone on to class because when I turned around I couldn't find her..." She put her hands on face. "I sound so silly! Unlike some twins, Padma and I have never had a problem doing our own thing and living our separate lives but... ever since the war and ever since Lavender..." She teared up again and Draco waited until she was ready to continue. "And it's been hard as Lavender's birthday approaches. Every year we'd get really excited for the Halloween feast because it was the kickoff of her birthday week." She stared at her knees.
She stared at them silently and rolled her eyes after a few moments of them waiting for her to speak.
He bit his lip. Draco was one of the most brilliant minds he knew when it came to piecing together obscure puzzle pieces. Of course Harry had thought about asking him to join him on the case a thousand times by now, but... Draco had opted out of this life years ago and, as grateful as he was that Draco had stepped in and essentially saved he and Ginny's lives back in January, it still gave him chills to think about what could've happened to him if his involvement had ended badly. And, right on cue, all the recent dream images of Draco lying cold and dead came to mind.
Harry grabbed a seat in the middle with Draco on his right. Hermione, Ron, and Ginny joined him on his left, and Penelope perched herself daintily next to Draco.
' but, close enough." He picked his head up and flashed Harry a brilliant smile that melted his heart which subsequently seemed to drop down into his groin when Malfoy bit his lip.
The weekend they'd shared had been lovely and perfect, but bittersweet. They'd holed themselves up in Harry's little muggle sanctuary all of Sunday only to be hit with reality come Monday morning. They'd woken up with Harry running late for work and Draco neglecting yet another wedding responsibility and, when it came time to go their separate ways, they left off with an awkward
Ron kneaded his hands in his lap as he spoke. "Harry... I know I'm rubbish at talking about feelings so I guess I get why you didn't tell me, but it really kills me that you didn't think you could talk to me -- that you had to carry it alone." He turned to look Harry in the eye. The care reflected back at him in his best mate's blue eyes was enough to make his chest constrict.
Harry smiled, wanly. He sighed and finally said the thing they were both thinking but too afraid to say aloud: "Do you want to postpone the wedding?"
make it hard to see you every day at work after the fact and pretend like you didn't... do that... huh?"
wand, at that -- that hasn't chosen you and whose allegiance you have not won, Draco? Well, let's just say the results are fairly disappointing, mate. Unfortunately, it took me spending six embarrassing
, arguably, a fit of madness. Draco crossed his arms and fixed him with his deadliest glare. "My point, exactly," he waved towards the vandalism of his precious
"Well... what I reeeally want to do is shag Draco Malfoy." He fought his blush and Bubblykicks just shot him a wry smile and sipped her tea. "Ron says that most pure blood marriages have a bonding ceremony so it's not like I could have anything more than that... But, I mean, if I really am accepting that I'm bent and I want to explore it, it seems stupid not to do that with someone that I care about and feel safe with, while I can... But could I be ok on the other side of that? I don't know..."
Peace. For Harry Potter? And Draco Malfoy? Even the best diviner in the history of divining was probably laughing in their grave at the improbability of it all but, somehow, they were doing a bang up job of pulling it off. Sure, there were a few stumbles in the beginning due to differences in...
"I would hope that means he has some grand knowledge that he hasn't yet shared with the rest of the class," the older wizard proposed.
"I want another one," he said simply as he reached the last song and let it play. He interlaced their fingers as they resumed their slow walk to the apparition point and the soulful notes of Mariah Carey's
Both sets of ginger and brown eyebrows rose in surprise but his two best mates nodded enthusiastically. They were there. They were always there, really. The constant proof that there were people in his life who always managed to both make it through and come through and, gods willing, so would Draco!
"It's all symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder," Draco chimed in and everyone turned to him again. "When people are triggered to past traumas, their bodies respond how they did when it was happening. So you might feel a racing heartbeat or go into fight or flight like you were back in the situation. You might also literally feel transported back to the event and actually being in the same space and under similar circumstances where the traumatic event took place makes it even easier to feel triggered. When I see Harry look triggered, I use what Muggles call grounding techniques. It helps to remind him of the present like where he's at and who he's with and that he's safe." He paused to roll his eyes. "And since Harry has such a hero complex it helped to remind him that everyone else was ok, too. Breathing techniques also help to physically move the body out of fight or flight so that's why I encouraged him to do diaphragmatic breathing." They were all listening raptly, Hermione nodding along as if taking mental notes.
Harry's heart sped and, still dressed in blue flannel pajama pants and a white t-shirt, he hurried to slip on his trainers and grabbed the map. He looked towards his trunk where his invisibility cloak was buried. His stomach dropped and he froze for a moment. He didn't allow his thoughts to linger on memories of Draco Malfoy and the invisibility cloak. Instead, he left it where it lay, snatched up his wand and headed down to the dungeons without another thought.
... I didn't know how it would help." He felt numb and was unaware of the tears that were rolling down his face. Draco squeezed him closer.
He sighed. He bloody hated going back home to England. It had been two years since his last visit and, if Blaise's Bulgarian dialect wasn't so shitty that it left him in serious danger of accidentally insulting Minister Oblansk and blowing the whole thing, then he probably would have told his partner to figure the shite out on his own. Draco's charm, schmoozing, and, believe it or not, reputation had leant itself to a prosperous career in these past five years. Through his work and contributions, he'd managed to transform his disgraced name into one of respect. Now known as an international philanthropist, socialite, and financial genius, he'd even managed to make
"Oh, Harry!" He recognized Hermione's worried voice as he hurried into the classroom just in time. He took his usual seat next to Hermione and looked around to see Malfoy, perfectly sculpted hair back in place and Malfoy mask back on. He was a table back talking to Zabini and the Greengrass girl and very pointedly
"Oh, we are, Dung, which is why I know you well enough to know better." He smiled, smugly. "I just need some quick information about the people you said gave you the Warbeck intel."
And with that, Harry groaned and let go, slamming home into the man who had become his safe space. His head found his chest as Draco used the leverage of the counter to match him stroke for stroke.
Draco had been so confused when Blaise showed up on his New York doorstep two and a half years ago, completely distraught. He had taken a redeye portkey straight there after Ginny Potter had told him that she was pregnant. Blaise had insisted that he and Ginevra had only given in to temptation just the
Draco sighed. He knew that Blaise and Ginny's story had started at the same time as he and Harry's. The exact same week, in fact. At the time, he hadn't even considered that what the red head and his smoldering friend shared was more than a desperate, convenient shag. Now he routinely wondered how things would have been different had 21-year-old him not been so afraid of what he might lose when there had been so much to gain. Maybe then there would have been two more
"Draco, you'll never believe --" he started to call out but came up short when a surprisingly delightful aroma reached his nose. He screwed up his face in both concern and confusion. "Draco? ...are you
"I know, love," he said, sadly. "It wouldn't be fair to you. Which is why I thought you deserved a proper good-bye."
"I guess I deserve that. Buuut... I'm not a big enough dunce to believe that was joke. There's something going on between you and Potter, isn't there? Before you lie -- don't forget, I was there with you two in that dingy muggle restaurant! And even Pansy said you've been acting funny ever since you two worked together." She smirked smugly.
pointy git is up to?" He looked at Harry sideways making the heat creep up his neck. The last thing he needed right now was for Ron to forget his filter, especially in earshot of Blaise Zabini.
"Draco, run!" Harry said as he hit Jansen with a wandless jinx that pushed him over the edge of the bank. They heard a loud splash followed by a string of expletives as he hit the icy waters and they ran in the opposite direction.
Draco flattened out against the bark, wheels spinning madly. The Ministry of Magic's "Light and Shadow Training Simulation #829:
He pulled out his wand and wordlessly summoned an assortment of massage oils. When he found one that reminded him of Harry in their quidditch days, he quickly rubbed it into his hands, heating it with the friction and filling the room with the scent of sandalwood. When he rubbed up his back again, his hand glided easily and long, nimble fingers worked to undo some of the knots as he went. Harry did eventually begin to relax into the touch until Draco finally started to massage his neck and shoulders and couldn't resist anymore: he sat down on the narrow space of the part of the seat not occupied by Harry, pressing up against his bum as he leaned in and slowly licked up the curve of his neck with his tongue.
For some reason, he thought of Harry standing lax and laughing freely, without a care in the world at that counter in his favorite restaurant, chatting with a few blokes who understood the muggle parts of him. Images of himself smiling and happy and free came to mind -- a version of himself that he hadn't seen since long before Hogwarts, back when he and Pansy used to play dress up and put on their little shows. Father had long put a stop to that, of course, but to imagine an adult version of himself that didn't have to be
He had no bloody clue what the ransom note was even on about. He'd confiscated hundreds of wands over the years during arrests but would someone really resort to kidnapping to get their wand back? He hadn't seen anyone act
"And... apparently it's a lot easier for the DMT to follow the full floo trajectory when you know the starting point..."
"It'll calm down, mate," Ron was saying from across the table right before he stuffed his mouth full of bacon. "S'only the sec'nd week."
"It was excellent, Alex -- Thank you, again, for arranging it on such short notice. Harriet Peppercorn from the Department of International Magical Cooperation was actually quite eager to hear about our new Quidditch ventures." Which was true, surprisingly. It was a real testament to the Malfoy charm that he had walked into that meeting prepared to talk out of his arse for thirty minutes and, somehow, walked out of it with a new investor and the door open for future Ministry investments. He silently prayed that this whole kidnapping thing wasn't going to send the whole damn house of cards tumbling because he'd probably have to obliviate Blaise out of his misery and commit him to the Janus Thickey Ward at St. Mungo's, if so. Speaking of Blaise... "Any word from Blaise, yet?"
"Nuh-uh. You know what I want to hear." He bit his lip and stared intently into Harry's eyes as he struck the spot again.
parts and Draco and Pansy wowed the crowd with dance moves that were so in sync it made Harry had to wonder just how often the two best friends got together to do this from the comfort of their own homes.
"Why not? Those memorials we had were bullocks." She looked shocked but he just shrugged. "They were just mass acknowledgements and now we all walk around like it was supposed to be enough for us to move on. Like moving on means we should just accept and forget." He shook his head. "That's not how grieving works. We only truly reach acceptance when we can allow ourselves to remember until the pain and bitterness isn't as strong anymore. And it happens in stages. And sometimes it's complicated..." He looked over to find Parvarti teary eyed but listening raptly.
Potter nodded and searched the neatly lined cases along the wall for any sign of Perseus Parkinson's staff, the next most likely target for the thief. Draco left him to it for he was currently too distracted to give a damn.
Harry winced, remembering how hurt Ron had been last year at the idea of being left out and the tricks that the locket had played on his mind. Guilt surged through him as he looked at his best mate who now looked wounded and angry.
Ron, on the other hand, had been mostly despondent or angry, not much in between. He didn't know what to believe at this point. He had made the mistake of not trusting Harry twice before and the guilt for each still haunted him. But this was different... This time there really were some big things that Harry had kept him in the dark about -- and, for Merlin knew how long! He had retrieved the clock from The Burrow and taken to carrying it around the house with him like his mum used to do during wartime. His little sister's name still sat, unmoving, at

Seeing you, competing with you, dreaming about the far off chance that maybe one day we'll be this hilarious yet intimidating odd couple of a partner duo..." he rolled his eyes. "Borgin and Ollivander were awful reminders of the fact that this job will
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
**August 30th, 2020** As I post this new chapter, I just want to let anyone who came straight to the newest update know that I edited a scene in the previous chapter in case you'd like to read the changes. It won't hurt if you don't and I don't think that it adds too much more to the story but does make it flow better (sorry, it was really bugging me 😂) and now I think it reads more genuinely, too. It's the part written in Draco's POV when Harry starts talking about his fears, if you're interested!
"Excuse me. Excuse me!" came a chorus of little voices and Harry watched as the group of 7th and 8th years were parted. He looked down to see Wilamina pushing her way through the crowd followed by Walden and Ariela and a number of their nervous looking first year friends. The girls hugged Harry and Draco when they reached them and Walden bounced up and down with excitement.
Harry stared into her eyes, hands still on her shoulders. How could he respond to that? Sure, maybe he had developed a tiny boy crush on Cedric Diggory in 4th year... But it was Cedric Diggory, who hadn't?? Remembering Cedric at all came with it's own pain so he didn't like to dwell on it. And maybe he had also started to realize that Malfoy was actually quite fit somewhere around 3rd year but he was... Malfoy! But...... the part he struggled with most in that moment as Hermione stared beseechingly back into his eyes, was how could he tell her that to sit with that question -- to really be open with himself around that question -- would require a deep dive into feelings of shame and guilt around the rape that he just couldn't allow himself to touch, to go near! He hadn't even been able to touch himself in two years without feeling unclean and shameful. He started to feel that feeling of numbness ebbing away at the corners of his mind but, luckily, at that moment the compartment door opened making him drop his arms and his shield.
going to get to... She had been so convinced that the Gods had punished her after the first time that we...
"Yes, a muggle inn," Draco repeated. "Harry, assuming she redirected herself there, why might she think to go to a muggle neighborhood?"
"So you're saying that if we were ever to have sex, then I would get a sappy Malfoy?" He smirked, teasingly.
Harry blinked back, slowly, letting the words sink in. Draco had said it all before in bits but never all at once and...
He shrugged. "I didn't see the point..." he said quietly, suddenly feeling small. "It had already happened, we knew they were death eaters and dangerous and we couldn't do anything about
"No, you're just cute when you're jealous." Harry seemed to have surprised himself with the admission if the resulting blush or the way he rolled his eyes at himself were any indicator. There was that tug again. "Ok, how do we reach these guys?"
"You look like shite warmed over." Draco's mouth dropped open, indignantly, and Harry gave a wry little shrug. "But like, the
"What was the one stipulation that we agreed upon when I adjusted these wards to include you?" he hissed.
He strengthened his resolve and exchanged one last significant look with Harry who nodded before they each reached out a hand to touch the Whomping Willow.
"Thank you so much, Ramona. You've been quite the help!" He nodded as he hurried off towards the lifts.
There was a time when Draco didn't very much care for the light. His parents had always cautioned him to keep to the shade as a lad, thanks to his fair skin. The manor was dark, surrounded by dark decor and dark artifacts. The Slytherin common room, in the dungeons, under the lake was... dark. Of course, there were the dark arts, dark marks, and the Dark Lord that'd all been a part of his world from the moment he was born... And it all came with the dark times that had once convinced him that even his very soul was dark. It had been a very long time before he embraced the light and, now, he found that he sought it and welcomed it with open arms.
He pulled apart and took in the sight of Draco Malfoy beneath him, hair mussed, lips red and swollen... He needed more!
Draco smiled, ruefully, and fought the lump forming at the sudden surge of appreciation for his friend. He cleared his throat and shook his head.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair in exasperation, completely dislodging it from its bun. It would have been a beautiful sight, had he not been so angry at him, the way soft black hair tumbled down past his shoulders and framed his face.
"Yea, that's the one," he said distractedly. He stepped to the side so that Harry could unlock the vault with his wand using the combination of taps that Pansy had given them. The tumblers inside the lock clicked and turned with each tap.
Harry didn't need him to finish the sentence. They all knew what it meant that Fred's hand on the clock had disappeared.
He sighed and placed his head in his hands again, not wanting to see Harry's disappointment or watch the moment that he decided to hate him for the rest of his life. And to think, he'd just had plans to propose.
Andromeda had been right: He needed to move on. No matter how much the brief interaction might've convinced Draco that the flame was still there for Harry, too, the fact of the matter was that the man was married and already had a full life built without him.
A loud pounding filled the room as someone forcefully kicked at the bedroom door. Harry shot up, disentangling himself from Draco as he grabbed his wand and looked around, disoriented. Draco rolled his eyes and reached out a hand to calm him before he could accidentally blast something.
Hermione rolled her eyes for the umpteenth time and Harry was beginning to wonder at what point might they get stuck like that.
Potter didn't even bother waving his wand as he mentally pushed the heavy shelving out of his way and marched off, determinedly, after the suspect.
"Come on, you can swallow, brave Gryffindor." Draco smirked and bent to kiss him on the lips, licking his own, teasingly, after. Harry accepted the challenge, tilting his head back as the gooey spunk slid to the back of his throat.
Harry's smiled waned, however, when his gaze landed on his own wife who sat beside the empty chair awaiting him.
"He's right, you know, Harry?" Harry turned to him with wide, frightened eyes as he registered the wand in his muggle friend's hand. "Why keep fighting it? Do you really want this on your hands?"
He sighed. "No, this is more awkward. Some of these girls make Romilda Vane look sane." He shivered as he remembered and eyed his treacle tart suspiciously. "I'd suggest that no one eat the sweets..."
"Thanks, Stori," he said, distractedly kissing her on the cheek and taking off at a trot, disapparating as soon as he could.
"You're lucky you're so fit," he said before kissing him hungrily. He pulled at the hem of Harry's t-shirt, quickly lifting it overhead and revealing Harry's taut, muscular frame. Harry fumbled with the buttons on Draco's shirt but it wasn't working fast enough!
"Dream root?" His eyes narrowed as his mind unhelpfully began to wonder if all of his strange dreams were a little too strange... But that was the last thing he needed to think about right now and, luckily, Draco served as just the distraction he needed, catching his eye from across the room and nodding towards the restrooms, implying that Harry should follow.
After a few minutes, the cries eased and she finally pulled back from the embrace. She sniffed loudly and wiped her tears with the sleeves of her robes. "Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, Draco. Look at me, I'm a right mess!"
Harry shook his head. He looked thoughtful as he silently examined the staff. After long moments, he finally turned to fix Draco with sincere, curious eyes.
"The TSA agents will run a metal detecting wand over you like so," he nodded to the man ahead. "--And then they'll tell you when to go stand in the big whirring machine, otherwise known as an x-ray machine, which will just take a big picture of your insides to make sure you aren't smuggling anything dangerous."
"Ok, sweetheart. You can fuck me now," he said, hand cradling Harry's chin, possessively. "Fuck me hard!"
Harry chuckled despite himself. "I really hope that's not your going rate for all your consulting work..."
decision to take father's wand was just an act meant to embarrass and punish or if there was something actually wrong with his own wand.
Draco smiled and then tried to force himself to reign it in. He couldn't believe his luck! He was actually being

Draco took a deep breath and braced himself as Harry let go of his hand to knock on the door. A few beats passed before the door swung open to reveal a genial looking woman whom he remembered being at the head the throng of red-headed children during trips to Diagon Alley before each Hogwarts start of term.
To his credit, Malfoy, didn't say a word about Harry's tears as he warred with his emotions. He did, however, bridge the gap between them by outstretching one leg and letting his socked foot come to rest against his hip. Harry found the gesture oddly comforting and endearing coming from Malfoy.
Draco's eyes widened. "Draco. And, really? I'm the first?" He felt inexplicably special but the butterflies that came with the feeling did not mix well with the little seeds of guilt and worry already in the pit of his stomach. Or maybe it was all just hunger since he had stupidly skipped lunch when he was trying to be bougie this afternoon. Right on cue, his stomach growled loudly. "Ah, yes... I would love some of your fish and chips, they were delicious." He said somewhat coyly.
"Quiet down everyone!" called Flitwick from atop the head table, Professor Merrywhip at his side as an apparent aid. "We're going to get started!" The voices throughout the hall came to a hush. "Now, I'm sure he needs no introduction but we should all be very honored that he has agreed to be with us today and lead you in some dueling basics. Harry Potter." He nodded towards Harry and Harry was greeted to a round of applause as he walked up to the head table and faced the room. He was starting to feel lightheaded and he really wanted to get out of the spotlight as soon as possible in case he fainted.
He looked at Harry sceptically as he stood and took his wand. He didn't have to think too hard to find a happy memory. Harry had supplied him with enough in the past 24 hours to last him a lifetime.
"I'll have a vanilla café latte with two shots of espresso. And can you be a doll and add a little extra vanilla?" he winked.
"Take off your pants," he directed as he shimmied out of his own, revealing a beautifully long, pink, thick cock that flushed against his pale abdomen. Harry did as he was told before taking it in his hand, relishing the weight and feel of it as he stroked and cherishing the way it made Draco's breathing hitch, his grey eyes dark with lust. He leaned in to kiss Harry one more time and then made to stand, taking Harry's hand and leading him so that he was sat at the edge of the bed while he stood before him, pulsing cock at mouth level. Harry didn't know why, but it was intimidating. He eyed it, hesitantly, and Draco bent to plant a kiss in messy black hair, his bun having come half loose.
Harry gasped when he realized what he meant. He reached out a tentative hand to undo the clasp on the player and felt his heart warm with all the feelings he had carefully guarded himself against for all this time as the mix tape he'd made Draco stared back at him.
Draco was still about 15 minutes early for his meeting with Harriett Last-name-something-or-another which was just fine because he needed to make a very quick, hopefully inconspicuous, pit stop. So, instead of taking the lift straight up to Level 5, he got off when the melodious voice announced: "
who just put your life on the line to make sure that that man could never have full control of that wand!"
Draco nodded in agreement and then kissed him chastely. "Well I'm here. I'll be right by your side. ...If you want me to."
"Ok. So, I'm bisexual and I'm possibly in love with a man who is getting married in less than two weeks but wants to have sex with me and drunkenly admitted to loving me and seems to think it perfectly alright for us to just make the most of the time we
The declaration still reverberated in his head, the four words comprising, perhaps, the sweetest song he'd ever heard. How tragic for them to also serve as a beautiful requiem.
But, therein lied the problem: It had existed. And within it, Harry had been hurt so badly. What if he opened himself up again only to experience that excruciating pain again? What would happen when Draco ran off to Australia, again?
trusted global wizarding investment banking firm. Blaise was already ecstatically thinking about the next stage of their expansion and fantasizing about becoming the wizarding Barclay's when he left, but something wasn't sitting right with Draco and he couldn't put his finger on it...
until he finally came to a halt at the tiny selection of seemingly seldom used books on Mind Healing.
!" Hermione insisted, wearily. She looked disheveled and was clearly pouring too much of herself into her work, again. They were hovering over her desk -- which was covered in files about house elf rights -- and both fighting to get a word in over the other.
to stave off one while the other he would gladly drown in. Harry wasn't afraid of dying, himself, and it showed in his life, the risks that he took, the job that he loved. Meanwhile, he was so terrified of losing more loved ones that Draco couldn't help but wonder: Would his fear of Draco's death prevent him from trusting the process and loving freely? Could Harry at least trust in
"Yep, I know. Bizarre." He shrugged. "It's supposed to be a joint thing at some muggle bar. You and Harry's closest mates."
"Woah!" he said, awestruck as he reached out to take the map and observe it closer. Harry hesitated for a moment but handed it over. "This is an amazing piece of magic! Where did it come from? Wait... How long have you had this?" He narrowed his eyes as comprehension dawned on him.
Draco apparated to the secluded backstreet and headed, on foot, in the direction that Harry had scrawled out for him. He was preoccupied with a million thoughts that made him both nervous and excited about his rendezvous with the Chosen One.
He looked back towards the over crowded path to his table, full of people eagerly waiting to talk to him. Ahead, that pompous arse, Zabini, was still sat at the bar. Harry detoured left and relaxed slightly when he realized he was mere feet away from a quick exit.
Could he stop this without revealing himself? He still had the trace on him for another year and couldn't risk his magical signature being traced back to this place if he was... What? If he was seriously thinking about acting against the Dark Lord and helping Harry Fucking Potter? Was that what he was doing? Technically he just wanted to stop 2 vile and disgusting human beings from doing something he was sure the Dark Lord himself would surely disapprove of... Who was he kidding? This was tantamount to suicide.
"No, Draco-- that's bloody brilliant!" Harry exclaimed! He had been raised muggle but the idea of leaving the wizarding world for a few years to pursue a degree at uni had never even occurred to him. And to hear Draco, who had once thought of muggles as something less than human, sound thrilled about learning from them was... unfathomable!
"That prick wasn't even trying! Had to threaten to stick my shoe up his arse twice!" He frowned and then shook his head.
Draco listened with rapt attention as Harry told him all about the muggle auror-of-sorts, James Bond; and, when they watched a countdown of top 90s pop, Draco discovered that he had a penchant for classics by Madonna and American queens like Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey (which Harry thought was fitting since Draco
He had been doing arts and crafts with Luna who had gotten really good at enchanting origami beasts.
It didn't help at all that there were large chunks -- years even -- that went unaccounted for in Sebastian's records. Harry turned to the time-line along the wall again, his eyes settling once more on the largest of the discrepancies.
Draco shifted and reached into his bag to pull out the case of potions that Riply had packed. He handed Harry a clear vial full of clear liquid.
They had nearly made it out before Stevens apparated out of thin air to block their path. Draco instinctively raised his wand and pointed it at her but Harry reached out to make him lower his arm. Instead, he fixed her with a determined gaze.
Yes, I slipped "entanglements" in there. Sorry, I couldn't resist that little teeny tiny bit of 2020 Quarantine humor 😂
Draco filled with dread as he looked down into somber green eyes as picture Harry was marched away by Robard, himself, his hands magically bound behind his back. He paled, panic-stricken as he read the headline:
"Breathe, Harry," Draco said, kissing him gently on the corner of the mouth then pulling back and searching his eyes. Harry let out a breath that he didn't even realize he was holding. He took a couple of deep breaths when he realized that the anxiety was building and Draco stilled his hand but didn't remove it. Harry closed his eyes for a moment and again tried to be mindful of the lavender and eucalyptus as he inhaled and exhaled, the sound and feel of the water, and the fact that he was here with Draco, the person he felt safest with in the whole wide world. He opened his eyes and smiled at Draco. The concern in his eyes dissipated as he saw Harry relax and he returned the smile.
" Ron stopped himself and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. "Harry, every time you push people away with the whole
! Harry's eyes went wide as his mouth slowly filled up with stream after stream of something warm, thick, and salty that tasted faintly of bleach.
Draco chuckled but continued. "There's so little info here and I realize that if I really want to understand the psychology of it then I'd need to learn from the experts. So, I've been thinking about it and... I've decided to apply to a few universities for next year with top notch psychology programs..." he finished shyly, two faint red spots appearing over his cheeks.
"Fuck!" Draco growled, furiously reaching for his wand and feeling useless when the bandaging wouldn't let him grip it.
"What?" Draco asked incredulously, a hundred different pieces clicking into place. He put his head in his hands and groaned, reminded of the talk he needed to have with mother. "Why didn't you tell me?!"
"Let me see your wand. I can send Stevens a patronus letting her know that she's the one who imperiused Robards, her role in all this, and that we've got her tied up with a bow for her under veritaserum. Hopefully they can get her to confess while she's still on the stuff and undo the imperius curse."
." She frowned. "An injury that small, you'd think that any magical parent could have easily fixed it."
"Well at least that solves one mystery, I guess," he surmised, walking over towards Draco's bed. "I couldn't for the life of me figure out why you'd be having casual conversations with muggles but, I guess this makes more sense."
Draco gasped and then captured his bottom lip with his teeth and tugged and Harry was surprised by the sounds that escaped his own mouth. They were already both so close. Draco's hands had made their way underneath his shirt and and they were running up and down his front, each time hesitating at his waistband. Harry could tell he was trying really hard to be respectful and not cross any boundaries but Harry wanted to please him, too. He took a deep breath and started to undo the front of his jeans.
Harry watched as Malfoy reached up and caught the little jar with Seeker reflexes. "It's too late to start over but if you put in a pinch of powdered bezoar it should neutralize it and bring you back to step 6." Harry did as he was told and the potion went back to a bright purple. He smiled up at Malfoy.
"Hey!" Reynolds shouted as he turned onto the street. Draco aimed a jelly-legs jinx that left him scrambling to stand upright.
He let his cloak drop to the floor and waved his wand with one hand while he loosened his tie with the other. The muggle CD player with the surround sound speakers that he'd invested in began to play a familiar tune and he swayed his hips as he made his way to his bedroom.
Harry found Ron waiting for him just outside the office door, his tall lanky frame leaned casually against the wall. Knowing Ron, he had expected him to be angry, or hurt even; he was surprised, however, to find that he was actually grinning.
He turned back to Hermione and Ron. "-- and I know you've already technically got the offer, but really it couldn't hurt your chances of making it through Auror training with something like that on your resume."
He turned on his heels to return to his table in the seldom frequented isle behind the Forbidden Section. He had just sat down and started to peruse the chapter index for anything that might be at all useful when he heard that all too familiar voice from behind him.
Never would he have imagined that the one principle he valued most in the world would be in such discord with a profound new desire to
Draco cocked his head to the side and smirked, silver eyes glinting as he studied the man before him. Did he really not know? Sure, he never shouted it from the rooftop back at Hogwarts but it certainly was no secret in the Slytherin house. It was really none of Potter's business but... this could be fun.
Harry's eyes narrowed. "Thick accent? Mundungus mentioned someone with a funny accent giving him intel on the Warbeck case... And, I know the Bulgarians are in town..."
"Mate, watching Malfoy jump into action this morning and even sitting next to you on the couch a little bit ago... It's hard to describe..." He thought for a moment. "You know how he looks in potions?"
", but, imagine his great surprise the first time he'd agreed to let his friend, Candy, in New York dress him up in full drag only for even the bloody wig to turn blonde!
Harry was reluctant to ask this next question. He wasn't sure how Draco would feel about others knowing and it had the potential to open up a can of worms... In the end, his burning desire to talk about at least
"But you aren't..." He felt the heat rush all the way up to his ears as he choked out the words. "You guys aren't angry about Gin and I?"
expect anyone to trust you in a position of power or public service?" Robards scoffed. "OK, BRING IT IN!!!" he called out to the rest of the crowd, making it abundantly clear that he considered that the end of their conversation.
The blonde bit his lip and bounced from foot to foot, feeling ridiculously like an 11-year-old about to enter the Forbidden Forest all over again.
But it was too late. Neither Draco nor Harry looked back as they ran up the steps or through the shop or down Knockturn Alley or even as they pushed carelessly through the crowds of Diagon Alley, covered by the cloak and stopping only when they were breathless behind the Leaky Cauldron.
Narcissa sniffed back tears of her own as she rested her forehead on his shoulder and chortled. "But did the bloke
in case. But, of course, he wasn't prepared when, as was his luck, Harry Potter walked into the dining room where they'd sat for their meeting with the Bulgarians with his wife, Ginevra, in tow.
Harry's brow furrowed as he stared at the bottle, confused. Anavi's eyes widened and she began shaking her head frantically. His eyes snapped back up to see Draco's beautiful, smug smile.
"None taken! You should've been there for the existential crisis Fred had after when he asked if I'd ever wanted to shag you or any other bloke and I couldn't say 'yes'." He chuckled. "He'd thought that was just the norm, too!"
Harry licked his lips, his mouth suddenly too dry as his hooded eyes dropped down to the curve of Draco's, long, elegant neck and he swallowed. He was so close... He could just lean over and...
Harry sat in the big chair behind the desk and kicked his feet up, experimentally. He was surprised to find that there was an array of congratulatory gifts neatly awaiting him on one corner of the desk. He eyed a box of cigars from Kingsley and chuckled when he spotted a basket of dirigible plums. It was an exquisite bouquet of flowers, however, that really caught his eye. Mesmerized by the colorful arrangement, he held his breath and reached out to gently stroke the petals on one of the tropical plants.
Harry laughed in earnest and then kissed Draco passionately in response. "Definitely bent," he concluded.
"Just... little things. Like comments you make nonchalantly about guys without thinking twice about it." His cheeks warmed again. He'd definitely said the thing about David Beckham aloud to Hermione before. "It's actually pretty cute whenever you do it." She smiled.
"And, Mr. Malfoy, the wand has worked for you as it did before? Even without having to win it back?"
"I change my mind! This is a terrible, awful idea!" his words tumbled out as he shook his head emphatically. He had been trying to stave off his simmering panic at the thought of having to face the man that had been held captive in his home for nearly a year and, now that they were actually here... To hell with it all! He wasn't doing it!
"Draco, hunny," he cooed as he frantically pat pale, clammy cheeks that looked even paler than usual in the twilight. He was just checking for a pulse when he heard a groan!
She nodded but paused on her way out. "Oh, and sir? I booked your next eight meetings and managed to make you and your wife a reservation at La Sirène for Sunday."
"You... You did know... didn't you?" Draco seemed uncertain whether or not it was ok for him to ask.
. They weren't prepared for Pansy's paranoid parents and their reinforced steal. He raised a brow at Harry who smirked back, determined and cocky. Draco smiled and nodded towards the door.
Harry frowned as he tried to make sure he was following the bloke's logic. "Surely you aren't suggesting what I think you are?"
"Go get dressed -- I promised you a gay bar!" Draco's eyes widened as he remembered the earlier conversation. "Meet you at your place in an hour? And wear something muggle!" He called over his shoulder as he walked off, giving him no room to argue.
He frowned when he saw the name Blaise Zabini in the 7th year dormitory next to Ginny. He rolled his eyes because of course Ginny had figured out how to get a boy up the slide.
"Well, Oblansk's guys were still outside of the restaurant when Ginny and I left. I didn't think much of it, thought they might be, I don't know, debriefing about the meeting or something. I wished them a goodnight and apparated us to the flat. But, then, we saw them again..."
The man twisted his lips wryly. He looked miffed but he eventually nodded and summoned his shirt and robes before disapparating without another word.
"Firstly, let me just make sure I'm hearing you correctly: Your biggest fear in this is not that I'll leave you, but that I'll leave you dickmatized and bereft?" He raised a lighthearted brow.
?" Zabini looked terrified and doubtful. "Potter, I'm not like you! Or Draco, even... I'm no Auror!"
Draco caught him staring and smiled back at him, warmly. He pulled away and rustled through his bag for something. To Harry's surprise, he pulled out the CD player he had given him all those years ago and placed the headphones on Harry's ears. Harry raised a confused brow as Draco pressed play and skipped through songs by The Spice Girls, Britany Spears, Janet Jackson, and the likes.
"Codswallop! Don't you give me that bullshite, Harry! You're a mess. How about we not pretend otherwise before you do something stupid or drive yourself mental?" He rolled his eyes. But then his gaze shifted to something behind Harry and his jaw dropped as grey eyes went impossibly wide with horror. Harry turned, wand gripped tight and ready for battle, only to grimace. He'd forgotten all about the larger than life time-line he'd hastily scrawled along the length of the wall at some point during the night in what
Harry was surprised when his own eyes started to burn. He hesitated, taking in the sight of the beautiful boy before him. He walked over to Draco's side and carefully tucked him in. He looked so peaceful in this state. Harry took a deep breath, his exhale shaky as he leaned down to gently plant a kiss in soft, blonde hair.
Harry looked around for a glass of some sort but was distracted when his eye was caught by a large floor plant surrounded by the glowing haze of a well cast warming charm and situated in front of the vast picture window that took up most of one wall. Birds of Paradise. His heart warmed as a puzzle piece clicked into place that only added to the complexity that was Draco Malfoy. He looked back warmly and shook his head at the man who, somehow, managed to look angelic even though he was completely pissed. Right. Water.
"Alright, alright, don't get your knickers in a bunch." He thought for a moment about how best to explain the three weeks of nonstop drugs, drinking, and sex that followed his acquittal. "Let's just say I had quite the self-destructive streak after my release from Azkaban. I had a plan to get pissed and be buggered by as many muggle blokes as possible just as a big screw you to my dear father." He laughed darkly.
Harry wrapped his arm around him and kissed him sweetly on the cheek, making said cheeks turn even redder.
"Isn't that something?" Andromeda turned to Harry. "It's like he just senses he's family... Anyways, Draco, darling-- while I appreciate the thought, the kid doesn't need 600 galleon gifts, you're going to spoil him rotten!"
He froze when he realized that Pansy Parkinson was asleep in the overstuffed chair by the fire in the sitting room. He guessed that she'd stayed up waiting for Draco. Just as he had the thought that he
Harry stared into frantic grey eyes and remembered that soft, timid kiss in that club the night Draco had sung him Spice Girls. He remembered the exact moment when he finally understood why people called it making
Harry had been wondering that, himself, all morning. Draco had been noticeably absent from drills today and, considering the state of him when he'd left last night, Harry really hoped that he was ok. If he were being honest though, he was really kind of relieved because -- what on Earth are you meant to say to a bloke after you kiss them, yell at them, tuck them in, and they tell you they love you?
Stevens beamed back at him before nodding. "If we're lucky, the bastard will come wrapped up with a pretty bow. Harry, I think we've got him!"
Harry nodded, breathless and lost in steel grey eyes like a deer caught in headlights. Why was that so hot? Draco took a deep breath and Harry realized that he was grounding himself. "Ok, are there any things that you already know you want to try? Anything you already know you
"Severus, at the time I found out that my father...." He paused and shook his head. "I thought you would've already known. The things Yaxley and Rowle said that day made it sound like torture and rape were a regular death eater practice... And I was just so disturbed and things started to make sense that I'd never understood before... Like why my father always seemed uncomfortable having me around his friends and would tell me that he didn't want me alone with them... When I was younger, I thought that it was because he thought I was too young to be in on the important talks but when I witnessed what they did to Harry I knew that he simply didn't trust them around his teenage son."
His aunt's words rang in his mind. But, hey, this was sort of her fault to begin with! She was the one who jokingly threw out that maybe the little tufty-haired wizard could be bought! She had said it with a wink and a smile but, now that it had actually worked, Draco had to wonder just how much of it really was a joke...
Harry did a double take and his eyes went wide as memories from long ago came floating to mind. Minister Oblansk now had a fair share more grey hairs than black and looked warier than he had when Harry had first met him what felt like a lifetime ago in the ministry box at their very first Quidditch World Cup.
Harry was so incredibly touched. He couldn't remember a time where he had felt more fussed over, more loved, more supported -- not because of his name or anything he'd done or achieved, not because he was doing the proper or expected thing, but simply because he was... loved. It was a lot to take in and he was struggling to get a ahold of his emotions. It turned out to be a lesson in futility, however, the moment Draco and Narcissa's portkey arrived.
Harry nodded and stared off in thought. When his gaze met Draco's again, he bit his lip as if he were hesitant to speak.
"What we talked about! You know, about you needing to find a boyfriend to play with? Harry's really fun so I'm sure he'll play a lot of fun games with you!"
"And I was so close! But then, within the blink of an eye, you and that Potter manage to ruin my hard-earned reputation and literally
on the fucking Dark Lord. Anyone would have to be seriously daft to believe you could kill your wife." He rolled his eyes. "Merlin, you ask a lot of questions for someone--"
"So," Ron said as they walked past a group of dumbfounded Ravenclaws. "The Chudley Cannons or Puddlemere United this year?"
" she cried and looked to Harry with a silent plea for him to put an end to this. Harry opened his mouth to speak but Draco placed a hand on his arm to stop him.
"Nah, mate, it's Pots. You're close though... You know, I suppose Potter could work as a nickname if you really wanted it to," he pondered, realizing that he'd probably never see this kid again in his life so what did it really matter what he called him?
His mouth dropped open and stomach growled in appreciation when he saw that she was carrying takeout.
the Bulgarian Minister for Magic has officially confirmed his attendance." Lucius smirked proudly as they walked along the rows of white roses.
Between the Weasleys, his Hogwarts friends, and the Order, Harry had built his own family over the years long after his family was ripped away from him. He loved all of them dearly, but the little family of misfits and orphans that was he, Andromeda, and Teddy just felt different and so much more important. He and Andromeda had really become close friends in their mission to provide Teddy the best life possible.
"Technically, no..." he said snapping out of his daze, mind finally galvanizing and his eyes searching madly through the article. "This doesn't make sense..."
"I can't say that there was much that stood out and I am certain that she was under the influence of quite a few glamour charms, but I can say that she was a short, twitchy little thing."
Something had been bothering him that he hadn't wanted to think about in fear of dampening the brand new
The man twisted his lips wryly. He looked miffed but he eventually nodded and summoned his shirt and robes before disapparating without another word.
"That's it, love." His voice was low and raspy as Harry's muscles clinched around him. The mellifluous sounds coming from Harry's mouth told him that neither of them were going to last much longer.
"Some people think that being brave means not being afraid. Actually, bravery comes when you are terrified and you still take the risk and do the thing that scares you. Love is an act of bravery because with such joy, such pure love and happiness, comes the potential for great pain and loss and yet, you've always made it look easy. Loving you, wholeheartedly, after all the loss I've had, has probably been one of the scariest things I've ever done, yet, somehow, amazingly --
He gladly took a sip and smacked his lips at the perfect blend of coffee, milk, and sweetness. And there was something else there, too -- a nutty sort of something that he couldn't quite place his finger on but, somehow added to the flavor.
He tried to look nonchalant but his attention was peaked. "Muggle gay clubs, you say?" There was such a thing as gay clubs?
certainly happy!" They turned to see Andromenda smirking smugly. "I think I speak for anyone who's ever had to sit through either of these two's angsty pining: It's about damn time!"
"No, I need you to look at me. Stay with me, now," he commanded. Harry obeyed, reluctantly finding peace in those grey eyes. He felt raw and vulnerable and Draco was standing way too close and it felt suffocating and safe all at the same time. Draco continued to search his eyes until he apparently found what he was looking for and his hand finally dropped to his side.
"Of course," he said with conviction. It didn't matter. Harry needed him. He watched as his shoulders dropped with relief though he still looked nervous. "What do you want to tell them?"
NSYNC berated his ears as soon as he stepped through the door. He searched for the telltale shock of hair that always made him aware of exactly where Draco was in any room. His heart skipped a beat in panic when he realized that he wasn't there. He hadn't seen him walk out so, naturally, he headed towards the restrooms.
happen, I feel this panic and don't know what to do and that's when I start to feel numb and dissociate... Draco's the only one who's ever able to get me out of it."
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
He was sat on the cold, stone floor of the detention area near courtroom 10 awaiting his trial. Robards had moved him here to level 10 early that morning and the chill in the air told Harry that the dementors were already posted somewhere in front of the courtrooms. It must be nearly time.
Harry jogged to keep up with the retreating, polyjuiced form. The pure shock of the situation was wearing off only to be replaced with pure bafflement.
"Do you know how bloody hard it is to change direction mid-floo!" Ron marveled. "Fred and George did it once when they tried to sneak back home at the exact moment mum passed the fireplace on her way for a midnight nosh. Wound up all the way in Upper Flagley, they did!"
Draco's responding smile was rueful. He reached for Harry's hand and brought it to his lips. Harry's heart warmed at the featherlight touch before Draco let their interlaced hands fall into his lap.
Ron threw his head back in laughter. "I'll put it this way, mate... In order for penetration to work, the person who's being penetrated has to be able to relax. I -- who am admittedly not the most patient person in the world -- am dating Hermione Granger, who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'relax'..." Harry screwed up his face against a very awkward visual that threatened to break through. "Let's just say our first time was a disaster... We've had to learn a lot about each other and I've learned how to better read her cues and know when to slow down or pause and attend to her needs or nerves or whatever else might come up for her."
Draco blinked up at the big red and white circle above a flight of descending stairs that bore the words "Underground" and "Public Subway."
"Wait! Do you happen to have any more of these cute little uniforms?" He pointed to her white button up dress.
"I just wanted to say thank you... for what you did in there..." he said, rubbing the back of his neck and suddenly feeling very awkward.
! Yet, from the moment Draco'd stupidly unlocked Pandora's box at that muggle club, Harry had looked as terrified and unsure as he, himself, had felt on the inside. Draco couldn't tell if the fear was because the still 20-year-old was wrestling with his sexuality for the first time (Draco'd had his initial existential crises around that so long ago that it was hard to remember what it felt like) or if it was because Harry, too, was afraid of getting hurt when this all inevitably ended. Either way, this vulnerable side of Harry Potter elicited something in Draco that he very seldom felt. Something that was almost...
Draco began to move his fingers and Harry was surprised when it felt good. Really good! It did burn when he started working him open, stretching him with a scissoring motion, but it still felt more pleasurable than anything.
"Cleansing and protection charms," he clarified before he began massaging again, this time with both hands and gently pulling his cheeks apart.
Harry lifted his feet onto the couch and shifted to mirror Draco. He let his legs outstretch just enough that their feet touched, hoping that the contact might be as reassuring for him as it had been for himself. Draco lifted his head at the touch and continued.
" Ron continued, the anguish in his voice making the building guilt in Harry's gut stir. Ron pulled the chair from in front of Harry's desk and sat down heavily, resting his face in his hands. "I went by the Burrow and checked the clock. It's stuck on
"But there's more that doesn't add up... Sebastian's mother was muggle, he was raised muggle... He's perfectly at ease interacting in muggle spaces... In fact, the most I've ever heard the bloke say about politics was that he thought the Statue of Secrecy was rubbish and that it made no sense that wizards and muggles
"Ron. Love guru. Sealed Harry and Draco's fate," he surmised succinctly. Her eyes widened slightly and she nodded as if that explained it all, grabbing a handful of popcorn and turning to watch in wait.
Harry's eyes widened to the size of saucers as the simplicity of the words rang deep within his core. "Draco! You're a genius!" he shouted, placing both hands on either side of Draco's face and snogging him, hard.
"Well, William, last week the three of us--" He waved a hand to include Lee and Angelina. "--went out drinking with the wee ones and their Auror trainee buddies. Harry and Draco bickered back and forth all night and our dear brother finally got fed up and goes:
"No, we're taking a break right now," he said, still searching through the heirlooms and other random belongings. Draco frowned when he came across a glass box full of Pansy's baby teeth on a small pillow.
"There's lots of ways and, unfortunately, I've heard one too many of them even though I've asked to be spared the details on multiple occasions," he said examining his nails, nonchalantly.
"Apparently it started off with demands for money and then escalated to threats to her safety. Can you meet with her and find out who might have a motive -- other than her husband?"
father had been left wandless during the Battle of Hogwarts then he probably wouldn't have been so desperate to get
"Hey! We missed the gifts?" Ron groaned as he saw Harry and Draco still practically wrestling over their gifts. "Oh, ice cream cones. Is that because after that first field case you two got paired together on you stopped by Fortesque's to celebrate?"
"Yeah, yeah, alrigh'. So this Celestina Warbeck fiasco -- apparen'ly the records are being laced with a potion with a..." He looked up and to the side as if trying hard to remember the exact words to recite. "Somethin' about an 'undetectable amount of bulbadox juice and boomslang' and alls you need is a li'l bit of bezoar and bubotuber pus to stabilize the old ninnis."
Draco pulled back to get a better look at him. "Harry. It might've been stupid to be there but the worst you might've thought would happen was you'd get kidnapped and killed by the Dark Lord or something and that happened all the time, you have cat lives or something when it comes to that." He rolled his eyes teasingly. "Why on Earth would you have ever suspected that you would be brutally raped by two wizards?" Harry winced.
She twisted her mouth wryly. "Well there seems to have been an incomplete floo in the Harpies' locker room on Monday morning."
"I used it to fix my own wand and then put it somewhere where no one would ever find it and haven't mentioned it in nearly ten years." He shrugged. "I wanted the legend and the temptation and the violence that comes with it to die like Dumbledore had intended. Ron and Hermione are the only ones who've ever known I possessed it in the first place and I never even told
"I know, love. I know." He kissed his hair again. "I was there. That night on the tower," he swallowed.
Potter turned a skeptical brow back to Ollivander. "Are you sure, sir? We also believe that these attacks might be happening on the second Tuesday of the month. Does that day mean anything to you?"
be so urgent that you would dare delay happy hour?" he asked as he plopped down on the sofa in the middle of a room with double height ceilings and a panoramic view of the city.
The Granger-Weasley's were having a rough go of it. Hermione kept going between fits of crying -- that definitely weren't helped by the pregnancy hormones -- and trying to convince her husband that all hope was not lost. She refused to even entertain the thought that Harry could do the things that he was being accused of, though, even she had to admit there were some giant sized holes in the story that she couldn't begin to make sense of.
"Yes, you can tell me why you were about to lie to my partner," he said, wandlessly levitating a golden quill and walking back to join them at the front counter. Draco smirked. Partly because of the fast break in the case and partly because of the way
Draco's resulting smile was breathtaking in its shyness. He shook his head and looked up at Harry through blonde lashes.
. He hadn't smoked in 2 years and Ginny would be appalled to know he was even considering it -- one of the many awful vices he'd picked up after the war and, fortunately, one he'd successfully given up. The thought of Ginny made his stomach drop to the floor. He finally shook his head in response to the friendly bloke's offer.
like she had a giant cock. And," He made to get up. Draco only begrudgingly got off of him. Harry stood and readjusted so he sat facing the wrong way in the chair, his feet planted on the floor instead of on the leg cushions, and pulled Draco so that he was straddling his lap. "I'd recognize your touch anywhere."
Draco had made his way through the kitchen and pressed all the buttons on the microwave and was now opening and closing the refrigerator, watching the little light go on and off.
-- to hear. "I haven't stopped, even for a second. And I'll never stop -- not ever." He shook his head, hoping Harry could feel the weight of his words.
came the muffled voices from behind the heavy wood followed by hollow attempts to pull the door back open.
Harry felt his cheeks warm at his blunder even as the weighty request assured him that Draco really did
Draco nearly lost his balance as they landed erratically in an alley that he didn't recognize. There was smoke coming from the vents of a nearby restaurant and the distinct smell of grease from a fryer.
If you've never watched "Sisters of House Black - An Unofficial Fan Film" then you totally should! It's cannon in my head now when it comes to the Black sisters' story and shapes how I wrote them. Here's the link if you're interested or you can type it in YouTube: https://youtu.be/0hrcRtu45TU
The simulation ended and the lights flickered on to reveal the disappointed faces of his spectating peers in the viewing gallery. Draco smiled smugly. They wore that look every time he didn't fail and he simply refused to give them the satisfaction. Instead, he tried to contain his excitement as he turned towards the giant magical timer that now shone green to indicate that he'd beaten his personal best: 5 minutes and 56 seconds flat on a simulation where the average time of completion was nearly 30!
Harry smirked and rolled his eyes when Draco was no longer in sight. Then he swallowed, strengthened his resolve, and headed to the floo.
Draco folded his arms and sighed. Most days he felt like an undeserving piece of shite and the rest of the world did nothing to curb that. The war had been an awful pill to swallow and he'd witnessed so much that made him feel like filth by association. He felt like he was constantly trying to clear his conscious and Potter didn't even know the half of it. Yet, despite his efforts, he felt like he was failing miserably and, at this point, he was doubtful that this stupid job was the answer.
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
! And, all the while, Harry thought he was doing a fairly good job of not letting his wayward thoughts get away from him -- that is, he had been until the point when Draco, fascinated by all the muggle pop dancing, actually stood to follow along with parts of the choreography on the screen. Harry found himself hopelessly captivated by how carefree and joyful Draco looked as he danced, arms thrown wide and hips swaying freely, rhythmically.
"I know you hate all the attention, Harry, but, on the bright side, at least this has to be better than the whole '
Harry was overcome with warm feelings of gratitude. "Thank you, Draco," he said, his voice cracking. "You've no idea how much that means to hear."
Draco leaned in so close that Harry could feel his breath against his ear as he talked. "Harry, are you trying to say that you think you would want to top and are curious about bottoming, but nervous?" Harry nodded slowly, swallowing hard.
Both of Draco's eyebrows threatened to disappear into his hairline. He shook his head emphatically. "No, Harry -- this is
Draco narrowed his eyes at the interruption but continued. "Yes, like Lockhart. Muggles, on the other hand, have studied the human mind and the affects of experiences and trauma on the human psyche for centuries. Wizards haven't really explored how to translate muggle psychology to the experiences of witches and wizards. I'm sure that if we better understood the science," he said, lifting up his book from the coffee table which Harry only now noticed was titled The Neuropsychology of PTSD. "We could combine magic with some of their empirically proven muggle methods for healing to create a completely revolutionary form of mind healing."
"Well I know at least one of them has a residence in the UK so there's a chance they haven't left the area..."
Harry laughed, joyfully, and their friends broke out into more whoops and applause as Pansy joined Draco on stage and pulled him to his feet, singing along as backup. Blaise ran up to sing the
"Potter, you were right. I was a selfish prick to stir any of this up last night. I'm getting married in 10 days and I can't change that," he said in a rush.
Harry opened his mouth to speak but then closed it with a clack. He and Malfoy stared at each other for a long moment before they both dissolved into hysterical laughter.
Ah. There it was, Draco thought. The sound of barely masked contempt. The whole room seemed to be holding their breaths. He crossed his arms and leaned back in his seat with narrowed eyes.
He was so grateful that the DA had agreed to help out. Ron and Seamus demonstrated proper stance and etiquette while he took a much needed breather. He was starting to feel downright dizzy. Hermione instructed everyone to break off into dueling pairs.
"Hey, Teddy," Harry deflected loud enough to catch the young boy's attention. "What do you say we all go out back and fly? I think you might be ready for a real broom!"
The words still sounded so clumsy and out of place in Harry's ears, leaving him far more exposed and lain bare than he'd probably ever get used to, but Draco's eyes darkened at them, hungrily.
mad because he could not help but laugh and laugh and laugh until he was doubled over, belly aching, tears streaming. When he was finally able to pull himself together, he faced his father head on and said:
Draco sat in the back of the class next to Blaise, fiddling with the butterbeer cork necklace that was now wrapped around his neck.
He smiled wryly as Draco bounced on the balls of his feet and he sighed as he gave in and held the door open for him.
" He frowned, knowing full well that he sounded petulant and petty. "Is this really the battle you want to pick right now?" he hissed.
"I'm going to go look for the Trolley witch," said Ron, standing up and making his way towards the door. "I'm starving!"
Draco lifted his knees and wrapped his arms around them. He bit his lip, his glasses somehow making him look almost childlike as he stared back at Harry.
"Did she make it back to your place from work yesterday?" he asked, trying to piece together a timeline.
She scanned her wand over the ID for verification and then waved it through the air. Draco ducked as a file flew across the room and just barely missed his head. She caught it easily and donned a pair of glasses as she flipped through the file until she found what she was looking for.
He felt as though his heart had been pierced and slashed with ice. His eyes burned and he shook his head frantically. His very worst fear confirmed: he wasn't lovable. Nearly everyone in his life couldn't possibly have left him, if he was. Of course she had never wanted him.
Harry turned to Draco with trepidation. Draco kept a straight face and nodded that Harry should follow his friend.
He aimed a spell but the the suspect zigzagged, making it hard to strike. They were almost at the edge of the grounds and still a good 10 feet behind. Draco put his head down and sped up as much as he could.
"Harry, let's get two things straight: Firstly, The Dark Lord was one of the most powerful, most prolific wizards of our time, right on par with Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Sebastian Krafft is a bloke who spent a year begging to eat my--"
"Bulgarian? Are you certain?" Draco asked, mentally calculating the odds that some miraculous deal with the Bulgarians falls into Blaise's lap in the same week that his girlfriend is chased by and, possibly kidnapped by, Bulgarian men.
Draco flexed his newly mended hand, grateful for freedom again! Blessedly, Robards' assistant, Anavi, took pity on him and spared him the trip to St. Mungos. Gawain Robards finally entered the stuffy little office and sat down heavily across from Harry and Draco.
"Face it, Chopra: you're only here right now because Sebastian thinks of you as a weak, easily manipulated pissant. He's right, of course." She flinched at his words. "Yes, yes -- we get it... Robards is an obnoxious pig who deserves every bit of misfortune that comes his way but, you'll have to excuse my lack of sympathy for a whiny little cunt who
Ron finally let go of Malfoy and reached for his wand, having decided that Malfoy had, indeed, lost his bloody mind and, thus, given up on trying to reason with a crazy person.
But Teddy was oblivious to it all as he stared up at his two favorite people in the whole wide world (besides his gram).
Harry laughed and shook his head. "You know what I mean! Also, they have regular whiskey but, sure, we can go get some of that. I'm probably going to need it," he muttered the last part.
Draco cursed himself when a single tear escaped his eye, unbidden. He wiped at it furiously with his sleeve.
Also, earlier, in chapter 2 here, when Harry was dreaming of making love to Draco under a beautiful sunset before he was awoken by Ginny, he was dreaming of a memory of what took place the last time they'd seen each other in DHSGAHP on "Draco's Hill".
for the right price." He shrugged and spun the CD on his finger distractedly. "A few choice changes might have been made. Just in little ways that my parents wouldn't notice, of course, like:
Harry fought to hide his smirk when he looked back to see the grey haired, regal looking witch appearing as unruffled and composed as ever though he caught glimpse of her wand slipping back into her sleeve.
"Harry, it's not going to help if you go all mental again! Then Malfoy is going to have to do the mind fuck mambo jumbo thing again and we're back where we started, mate," Ron said before stuffing his mouth, having somehow found Draco's can of biscuits. "We'll look after him."
There were gasps from a few of the portraits but everyone else in the room was silent. He didn't dare to look at anyone's faces, not sure that he could stand the pity he was sure to find there.
"Sorry, love. Let me just make sure the world's not on fire then how bout you meet me in the shower so we can finish what we started?"
"She apparated us to her home. I had to arrest her in front of her parents and sister but they have no idea that you had anything to do with the investigation. When they found out what happened, they flooed over to the Gobstone game at the Parkinson residence and explained everything to all the elders who had been robbed. They weren't happy, but they agreed not to press charges so long as they get all of their heirlooms returned. We have to take her in to fill out the paperwork but she will walk free in time for your wedding."
Harry turned to find Malfoy stood leaning casually with his arms crossed in the compartment entryway, a smirk on his face as he looked him up and down. He hadn't seen Malfoy since the ministry trial when he testified on his and Narcissa's behalf. He had been a ghost of himself then -- too skinny and guant, his hair long and slightly matted. He stood before Harry now in his posh preppy jumper looking fit and almost back to his old quidditch form. His blonde hair was cut short now and it was perfect and illustrious once more. Harry rolled his eyes but couldn't help but smile.
He felt the vague beginnings of panic start to bubble up but then he squelched it. If Ginny were really in some sort of mortal peril then the whole Weasley clan would be up in arms by now thanks to Molly's clock.
Anger flooded through him as he stopped at the line of sinks. He grasped hard at one of the the porcelain basins, his knuckles turning white as he glared back at the pathetic reflection in the mirror.
were the birds chirping so loudly? He pulled the covers tighter around his naked torso and willed himself to fall back asleep.
Draco nodded and was surprised when it didn't feel like a complete lie. "Have you seen him? We're supposed to be meeting up here again."
"Next thing I know, this place will be crawling with Potter's idiot Gryffindor friends. No respect --" He heard Snape muttering to himself as he closed the bedroom door.
"Well, you are pretty damn fit... And I happen to find the quietly strategic and disruptive type not only brave, but also, incredibly sexy." Draco smiled lasciviously and Harry felt the heat rise to his cheeks as the heat increased between them.
Harry hadn't even had warning enough to duck before the flat of her hand struck stingingly across his face. He stretched his jaw and rubbed his cheek in response. Harry looked around warily when he thought he saw a bright flash.
"How true, Mr. Malfoy." Dumbledore smiled at him kindly and he felt his heart constrict painfully. "I'm so glad that you've found it in your heart to seek healing for others. And I see you've become astute in the great muggle art of psychology. So wonderful in concept and yet, like yourself, often its goodness is left unseen in our world." Draco blushed.
didn't want to have to deal with any more Slytherins today, the deep, yawning voice of Blaise Zabini floated towards them through one of the doors.
Harry followed his gaze to find Savage walking past the display window and, by the looks of it, following
"Now if you're done being a crude pain in the arse, Potter and I are working a case and I'm pretty sure there's a good chance your family's going to be robbed tonight."
kind of arse kisser. He wanted to gag but apparently it was making Potter feel just as uncomfortable: he could see a deep flush creep up the boy's neck from where he sat. Ok, maybe Potter wasn't a fan of this man's groveling.
"Well so long as you have your wand on you you'll still be able to apparate but, otherwise, I can protect you." Draco shot him a skeptical look. "The question just becomes do
Sure, there was the secret entrance through the shrieking shack but hardly anyone knew about that. Not to mention that, without being familiar with the grounds, Sebastian was likely to be devoured by any number of things in the Forbidden Forest or, at the very least, be pummeled by the Whomping Willow without a guide.
"Ooh! Is that the Spice Girls?!" he asked, excitedly, when he recognized the tune, plopping down on the sofa to watch the
"Ha! In your dreams, Malfoy!" he laughed as he made to head to the drawing room to use the floo. He got all the way to the doorway before he remembered something and turned on his heels, bouncing to a stop.
Draco reached up and his hand found its way back to the nape of his neck and he kissed Harry hard. The faint salty, tangy taste of his own cum was still on Draco's tongue but, for some reason, it just seemed like the sexiest fucking thing and he kissed him harder. Draco had begun jerking his own cock but Harry knocked his hand away and took over, relishing the feel of his cock in his hand. He wanted to be the one to make Draco come. Draco whimpered against his mouth and Harry sped up the tempo, knowing he was close. He felt Draco's cock pulse as creamy, warm cum shot from the tip and across Harry's stomach.
"Are you... Is everything... Please tell me what you're thinking," he finally settled on, still eyeing his friend apprehensively.
Draco continued to float. He didn't pressure him to do anything at all, he just continued to float with his eyes shut. Harry started to do some of the deep breathing that he'd learned in the book and he gradually felt the anxiety dissipate.
Draco stayed a step behind, watching his retreating form, deep in thought. He had always shut down his wayward thoughts about the man before him because Harry Potter was off limits. Potter was the savior and Draco a death eater. They had
who'd probably actually like to snuggle after and want to rub his fingers through your hair until you fall asleep and, I swear, I never even knew
"Good luck, mate!" He heard as he closed the portrait and headed to meet Draco on the 5th floor with nervous anticipation. He reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered and counted 4 doors to the left.
in school. How does one go from exceptionally mediocre to being able to do something that not even some of the greatest wizards known to man have mastered?"
Harry settled in, cross legged on the bare patch of floor not covered by case material and retraced his thoughts, hitting the same roadblocks as before.
Draco wanted to bang his head on the table. He looked around the room: Granger sat in the front row, the perfect student, nodding along with rapt attention but nearly everyone else looked slightly bored if not feigning politeness. Weasley was already nodding off, Thomas and Finnigan couldn't seem to keep their hands to themselves under the table when they thought no one was looking (how those two weren't out yet was beyond him), and even the Patil twins, who had spent the first week chattering nonstop about how handsome the young instructor was, seemed to have lost interest.
Harry glared back in response before rolling his eyes. Already caught, he figured he might as well go for the straight forward approach.
"Doesn't matter, you didn't need it anyways," he grinned, mischievously. Draco tackled him and pinned him to the mattress.
He liked that she was usually blunt and to the point. It turned out that Beth Bubblykicks was, herself, a former dragon tamer. When he told her that he didn't think anyone could possibly understand, she'd explained to him that most dragon trainers were really just lost souls trying to find themselves or run from something and it made him think that, just maybe, she might get it.
The office looked much the same as he had last seen it last except with tartan patterned furnishing. Dumbledore's portrait smiled back at them from right behind the large desk while Snape's glowered beside him.
Ron screwed up his face and twisted round, oblivious to the baby happily slobbering all over the lapel of his dress robes. "Is that
" she asked, incredulously, as she took the seat across from him. "I've been trying to get Ron to get us a reservation there for ages! Apparently, there's a six week wait just to get a seat at the bar!"
Harry dropped his face into his hands and massaged his temples. "Hermione, I really don't feel good. Is it too late to back out of this?"
"I wanna make you hollll-er, and hear you scream my name! I'll give you rules to folllll-ow, so you can play my game! Imagine us togeet-ther, me driving you insane! You will give innn to meeee! Don't be afraid to play my game!"
Draco saw the flash of green just as the scene was plunged into deep darkness. He instinctively groped for Harry and spun on the spot, apparating them to the dark shadows of a massive yew tree mere seconds before the curse could collide.
"No, it was. But when you and Malfoy ended... Oh, it's my fault, really, Harry -- I did something so stupid..."
"Maybe not, but I'm just glad you came back. But if I'm being honest, it's scaring the shite out of me because I'm feeling stuff I've blocked out for half a decade... And I have my guards to protect me against loss but when you talk about sex... To have you...
Harry couldn't help but grin ear-to-ear as he nodded and excitement flashed in steel grey eyes. "It's not final yet, but I think we might actually have him!"
Neither he nor Blaise had lived in the London flat for years but they'd held on to it for times when Draco returned (though he usually just preferred to stay with Andromeda) or, for Blaise, whenever he wanted to rendezvous with a certain redhead without fear that the neighbors of his Berkshire estate (who were all very much a part of the wizarding elite) might catch wind.
Some part of Harry's mind registered that this must be what Fawkes feels before she combusts because surely he was on the verge of bursting into flame and turning into a neat little pile of ash if the way his cheeks flamed was any indication.
His heart sped up at this but he kept his mask in place. She was watching his reaction closely and he didn't know what to say. Mercifully, if not embarrassingly, she spared him by just asking the question she'd wanted to ask.
He walked over to the bedroom and sat down at the writing desk with quill and parchment. He stared at it blankly for nearly an hour before he finally wrote a word. He'd thought it'd be a long letter but, when he finished, it was only about half a foot long.
He shrugged. "We'd have to figure out where they're likely to hit next. There has to be some type of connection we're missing."
die in my mind, I wont forget," he promised, his eyes shining with sincerity. Harry smiled weakly. It wasn't that he was worried that he would forget, he was more so worried that he wouldn't be able to feel. If only he could think of a way to ensure that Draco could still
Harry huffed and mumbled about where Sebastian could shove his admiration but Draco simply laughed and carried on before he could brood too long.
"So, is there any connection that you can think of between the five families other than the fact that you all just happen to be neutral?" asked Potter.
find her," he assured. But then his brow furrowed as he tried to make sense of something. "Harry... what wand?"
Draco sighed heavily and privately wondered how unfortunate it would be if he rescued the girl only to still wind up in Azkaban for cursing the lot of them.
They landed in the (thankfully Walburga free, though, still wrecked) foyer just as Mariah sung the last
Fourteen minutes later and they stood facing a packed great hall full of students standing on tiptoes to get a look at him. He fought hard to keep smiling and not roll his eyes at all the yells of "
"Aww!" He placed a mocking hand over his heart. "Were you actually concerned about me, Weasley? I'm touched!"
And just like that, Harry's mind went blank and his pupils were blown! Wasn't there something he'd been excited or worried about only a moment ago? He could've sworn there was...
It wasn't that he was jealous of the bloke -- of course not! ...It was just that he hated that Potter could seemingly do no wrong...
The flash of light flashed again and Draco remembered that they were not alone. There, across the room and scurrying to hide behind an oak tree, was Sebastian Krafft.
"I'm only trusting you because Ginny would have. And, for some reason, Draco does, too." He shot Draco a wary look before he finally softened. "Look, Potter -- I know it's no comfort to hear but I really
Harry sighed. They had been seated for nearly fifteen minutes and she had not said a single word. Not even when the chef personally came out to greet them and
His expression made Pansy reach out and snatch the headphones off of his ears. She only listened to one line before she quickly tossed them back, shaken.
doing here? What did he do to you?" she asked angrily. Draco showed no signs of backing down as he glared back with a raised brow and look of distaste. Harry looked between them warily and rubbed the back of his neck.
