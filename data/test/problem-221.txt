So much Draco had to keep hidden from Potter. He couldn't risk the most important relationship in his life. He wouldn't risk losing Potter's trust. If Potter knew what Draco really was, he would be revolted.
Potter was looking at him. An intensity in the gaze made Draco aware of just how close Potter was. How Draco hands were on his back.
She walked briskly by him, her eye catching on something. Draco took her hand as she made a sharp turn. He dragged her out of the dusty store. "Pick a place to eat," he ordered.
"Since when do you smoke?" Theo interrupted the war that was about to break out, he was speaking to Draco.
Daphne, so strong yet scared. She had been right, Draco had been manipulating her this entire time. He now had enough power over her to ensure his own safety, but she had also gained a dangerous amount of insight into his life. They had their wands raised, both ready to strike if the other steps out of line, a deadly game to play. Trust could get you killed.
The two allowed their giggles to continue as they drifted back into silence. Draco leaned against the brick wall, looking up at the ceiling.
He couldn't. The possibility of just seeing Potter drove him forward with a force of excitement he didn't know he had.
Lucius knew his son better than to take his words for face value. "Don't be coy Draco, it doesn't suit you," he snapped.
"My Lord…" Draco began. His Lord looked down at him with slightly raised eyebrows, still walking leisurely. "I'm sorry," he made his voice break.
Pansy stormed into the room behind Potter and his shadows, looking ready to kill. To kill Draco more specifically.
Draco closed his eyes. His hand tightening around the knife in his pocket. This was the only way. He broke away from his mother's side. If he was going to do this, he would have to do it now.
"There's no need to apologize," Draco acknowledged, "I'm sorry I snapped at you," the apology felt strange on his tongue. "Are you going to tell anyone?" Draco asked, knowing the answer.
Draco raised his eyebrows, resisting the want to rub his shoulder. He tried to remember if he had done anything in recent history to piss the Gryffindor off, but nothing came into mind. Finnigan had his fist clenched at his sides, his chest puffed out in what Draco guessed was meant to be intimidating. Finnigan wanted to fight. Draco adjusted his strategy compared to how he would usually handle a similar situation, Finnigan wasn't worth his time. He relaxed his stature, rubbing his shoulder, keeping his face carefully neutral. "My mistake, mate," he lied. An unhelpful snort came from Draco right, from where Blaise was standing. Theo shifted on his left.
"Now," Dumbledore had stopped with the pleasantries over the summer. They both knew Draco was only here for Potter. He had no loyalty for Dumbledore. "Let's see how useful you can prove yourself. Let me see what you found out over the summer."
Cedric changed to the muggle child Draco watched his Lord kill in fifth year. The child changed to their mother. He swallowed another tooth. The mother changed to Astoria. Astoria changed to Draco's mother, who changed to Bones.
"I'm fine, enjoying the gold start treatment," Draco tried to comfort. He carefully moved his body to one side of the twin size bed. He ignored Potter's protests as he made room for his friend to sit next to him.
"Hi Dracy, how's your morning going?" Pansy greeted him. She had started to style her hair differently. A slight curl softened her usual thick straight hair. The waves framing her face in an attractive manner. How much time did she spend making herself seem soft these days?
"There's a reason why no one has bothered Draco since he won the fight, let's keep that in mind," Theo reminded.
His attention was taken away when Madam Puddifoot took their orders. When he turned his attention back, Cho was crying. Potter was just looking down at his hands as Cho cried, admitting to her feelings of guilt over dating Potter so soon after Cedric's death.
The spot next to him remained cold as no one took Daphne's usual seat. Draco felt the heat from Potter's gaze. They hadn't spoken since their few stolen moments on the train.
Draco sat in History of Magic, dreading the class but looking forward to his nap. Students were already at their tables when he had arrived, having been caught up in the dispute. Each desk was long enough to be accompanied by two seats facing the front of the classroom. He had taken the table in the back with the chair against the wall. This was the best table for gossiping, as he and Pansy had discovered in first year. This was also the perfect table to fall asleep in, the dim light of the back of the room assisting in drowsiness.
Draco allows his mind to drift back to a distant memory, letting his guard down, comfortable in the privacy of his walk. He thought back to a time when his home was not a prison, a time before the Dark Lord entered his life, a time when his home was still a home. The warmth provided as Draco lounged in front of the fireplace, reading while his parents sat in their respected chairs, drinking wine and discussing this and that. The warm breeze that would past during a summertime breakfast out in the garden. Mother and Father listening to him talk on and on about whatever he had to say, nodding and hardly hiding their amusement at their son.
The arch watched them. Draco knew that whatever old magic was seeped into these walls, he did not want a part of.
Potter didn't move to look at him, but his hand didn't stop the gentle touch on Draco's dark mark. "I'm right here, I was just thinking."
A house elf was ordered to Apparate Draco to a clear space a few blocks from the station. Apparently, he was old enough to take himself to school. His parents didn't even say goodbye to him.
No. No. He couldn't let his mother see this. He reached out for the memory, but by doing so he released the wall that had been built by the pain he was going through.
Thoughts like these is what caused Draco to even vary his routine. Go outside, go to one of the towers, whatever, keep everything unexpected in order to not get lost and starve, or get bored. Which is how he was in this very unpleasant situation.
"Your reaction could almost be considered a snap of temper, but you attacked Mr. Finnigan with surgical precision that suggests more thought," Dumbledore challenged. He leaned in his chair now, resting his hands on the armrest.
Severus leaned back in his chair, still breathing heavily in anger. He ran a hand over his face. "Perhaps," he started quietly, "perhaps it is best that I take on teaching Potter."
Merlin, he was shit. How was he supposed to build a relationship with Potter if he couldn't keep the friends he has now?  Potter was different though. He was easy to talk to, he also just…allowed Draco to be. Draco didn't have anyone who he could just be with, he was constantly playing a role; a son, a follower, a heir. Potter didn't need him, he had his friends, he had true friends. Potter was probably only reaching out to Draco out of necessity. If that was the caste, then Draco was determined to be useful to Potter in any way. Draco could be himself around Potter, even if their relationship was built on necessity.
How do you talk to a current outlaw who has been on the run for the last two years? "You have a smoke?" Draco asked. He was about to vomit. His head pounded in his ears.
"Oh, please allow me," Draco insisted, rising from his seat instead of using magic. He carried the tray, pink, over to the desk before placing the tray on the desk. "Now, would you prefer six sugars or ten?" he doted, his teeth hurting.
"Both hands are preferable," Firenze gently guided. The ash was soft and cool against Draco's hands. He guessed about what to do next. He tossed both handfuls into the fire. The second he released the ash, his back shivered as his spine tensed. His neck pricked as if he was being watched in an empty room by an invisible force.
Draco took his usual post behind one of the armors along the hall wall. He enchanted himself so that no one would find him. He had started the habit whenever Umbridge had started recruiting students to help find Potter's mysterious club. He simply jinxed anyone who got too close, or that he wasn't particularly fond of, his aim had vastly improved.
Potter hummed, "Sometimes I wonder what would have changed if I were to have been sorted into Slytherin." Potter rested his chin on his knees.
Draco now had a course of action, thankfully. He would have to tell Potter some version of the truth, but not enough to have the boy pity him. Potter would have to see him as an equal, not as someone to save. Merlin knows Potter didn't need someone else to be a savor to, Potter needed an equal. Draco could be his equal. Class ended, Draco was the first out of the door, acting as normal as possible, as if he was not thinking of making nice with the Dark Lord’s most dangerous enemy.
"Daphne has been acting awfully strange lately, is there any reason why?" Pansy whispered mid-way through the lecture.
"And what?" he snapped. He wanted to be cruel. "What should I do? What you have done?" He raised his hands out to his sides, "what exactly have you done Cho?" She didn't answer him. "You've done nothing. Nothing but mope around for you poor dead boyfriend while self-flogging yourself for having dared liked another boy." Her jaw clenched. He didn't stop. This was the first time he felt something in weeks. "All you do is punish everyone for moving on while you stay behind. Luckily for you, Cedric died before he could leave behind his girlfriend still in school-"
Draco paused, unsure if he heard exactly what Cho had said. One look at Daphne's widen eyes and plastered smile confirmed his suspicions. He glanced at Potter, who was looking at Cho with his mouth agape and his eyes widened.
"Asshole," she laughed easily, pushing off of the sink where she had been leaning. She made to leave before she turned around. "Are you going to be okay?" she asked kindly.
Draco stumbled backwards from the force of the spell that slammed into his shield. His head hit the brick floor as he tripped over the Death Eater he put in a body bind. His feet tangled together over the frozen body. The whip of purple flame flew towards Draco. He rolled to the side. The flames licked Draco's ear. The smell of burning skin in the air.
Draco's chest tightened, "Oh…" what was someone supposed to do in this situation? Draco drew a blank. "Umm…okay," he supplied dumbly.
If only the other houses could see how vulnerable they were. Perhaps Blaise would pull himself out of his depression, perhaps Bulstrode would be less of a target for abuse, perhaps the small, resilient girl could stop being so strong and be a child.
Draco nodded, sipping the water. Lupin didn't mention his father's involvement in getting him fired. He also didn't mention Draco's own involvement in the loss of his job. Nor did he mention the branding of werewolves the Malfoy's dipped into. Lupin was a merciful man. "Wasn't Daphne's boggart a giant cockroach?" Lupin broke into conversation.
She kicked at his shins. She slipped on her own blood. Her nails clawed at his arms, but the warm blood that covered them both made her fingers slippery.
"And you know what he does to those he finds disposable, don't you Draco?" Draco's chest tightened. "You were there when he killed that muggle family, weren’t you, Dracy? How did he do it?" she taunted playfully.
"Pleasure of you to join us, Malfoy," Professor McGonagall scorned him as he entered the class. He promptly handed her the note Severus supplied him before she further scorned him.
He rested his head in his hand, his elbow on the back of the couch. Potter was cute with his brow knitted together in thought, but he only did that whenever there was a problem he really didn't understand. Rarely would you see Potter furrow his brow during class or lessons, or even during a test. No, only when there was a problem Potter had no clue how to go about.
The hoist led them to a small, two person table next to the window. "Do you like the window seat, darling? I requested it especially for you." Daphne thickly acted on his arm.
"Son of a-" Draco gasped. "Potter, what are you doing here?" Potter was a couple of steps behind him. He didn't smile, only motioned for Draco to follow. "Potter, we can't be seen together," Draco pointed out before they slipped out of the Great Hall. Potter pulled out a cloak from his bookbag, covering Draco completely.
"Assuming we're friends," explained Daphne with evil glee. Draco tried to hide his smirk, when he couldn't, Theo punched his arm for laughing.
Maybe it was a dream? A nightmare? This was more vivid than any night terror he had ever had. This had hurt more, so much more, than when he got the mark. Was his mind trying to process what had happened in his sleep?
"You're not going to think my foot is very lady like up your ass," Daphne growled. The crowed room hushed.
If only Umbridge wasn't the first Professor to break up the fight. If only Umbridge wasn't a Professor at Hogwarts. Potter would have been given detention, of course, but not this abuse. Perhaps if this abuse was reported, given to the media, then maybe this would stop.
Blaise poked his head in, "Oh, there you two love birds are." He entered the compartment. Draco removed his hand from Daphne's knee. Theo followed Blaise into the compartment.
He turned to Dolohov, whose back was to him as he stood over an unconscious Longbottom. Longbottom was stunned on the floor. Blood was down his chin from his horribly bent nose. His wand in two on the floor under Dolohov's foot.
With a loud, shrieking laugh his aunt shoved him away. He stepped back from the force, his back hitting the wall.
He let himself relax for the first time since he had gotten off this train a little over a week ago. Just a little over a week ago, and Draco's life had tilted to an impossible angle.
He pushed for his heart to stop thundering in his chest. He needed a clear head to be useful. What was the point of this, of all of this, if he wasn't useful?
No. He wouldn't allow himself to focus of the hypotheticals. He needed to handle the situation he was facing now. The rest will have to wait.
He couldn't move. He heard Daphne gasp. Lucius froze, his hand still in the air. Lucius had never hit his son before. Daphne's breaths were the only thing Draco could hear against his rushing blood. Lucius lowered his hand as Draco faced him. He swallowed his anger down so that it coiled hotly in his stomach.
The glass had cut into her chest, along her arms. Her breath quickened as she spread her arms wide to watch the cuts bleed as she sat up onto her knees.
Draco heard them before he saw them. A snap of twig behind him, he turned only to be met with a giant, horse-like creature. His gasp quieted the class, everyone turned to him, but he only looked at the creature.
Draco easily shoved past the group of Death Eater's, all confused. Draco ran as quickly as his body would allow towards a rushing Potter. Potter and his friends were hurrying to an open door way.
The pair discussed Quidditch, then teams. Draco forced himself to pay attention over the pressure in his head. The conversation turned to Sirius becoming an animagus. He laughed at Draco's joke about fleas.
"Nothing," supplied Draco with a smile. He rose, "Try not to call anyone a frog-faced bitch," he called over his shoulder continuing to hurry away.
"I usually keep to myself," she supplied. The girl blushed as she hurriedly stuffed her supplies back into her bag. Looking at the supplies on the floor, the fact that she was muggle born was obvious. Muggle pens, pencils and notebooks were everywhere. An instant give away. Draco handed her a hot pink pencil case, she snatched it out his hand. Her shame was obvious, or perhaps she wasn't ashamed, but fearful?
Draco closed his book, he was just reading about Doxy venom, he turned in his chair to face Pansy. He reached out for her, taking her hands in his. "Pansy, talk to me," he pleated.
Daphne steadied him with an icy glare, "Just because Pansy was a bitch to you today doesn't mean you get to take it out on me."
"He's ok," Draco interrupted, "all things considering, he's fine." Draco took out a folded letter from his robes, "He even sent word himself."
"Oh, shit." Draco sat up, his cheek wet. He looked around, looking for the apparent danger. Theo just smiled, "You're drooling." Draco wiped his face with the back of his hand. He stood up, he couldn't fall asleep. "Go ask Daphne for help so you can get some sleep," Theo ordered.
Firenze looked up from the circle of ash. His smile didn’t reach his eyes, but Draco didn't think anyone else could tell. "This is the perfect time for me to show you how to relight Omen Fire." Firenze continued the lecture. Daphne stepped back, Draco gently reached out to her, touching her elbow. Daphne nodded at him, a small smile on her lips.
A knock interrupted their thoughts. The door slid open slowly. A short girl with light brown hair stood there. Astoria's knuckles tightened until they were white on the door. Her lips were tight when her eyes fell on Daphne. Daphne, sitting quiet cozily next to Draco, with her feet in his lap.
Draco sighed. This was a very fucked situation, he shouldn't get involved. He had more than enough to handle, they knew what they were getting into, they could handle they own situation. "I won't say anything," was all Draco offered, making his way back to breakfast.
The silence that hit the room sunk into his chest. He froze, he made sure to leave his face blank after the realization. How could he forget? He killed her, and he dared to forget that? Forgetting her, washing her blood from his hands, was the worst sin he could commit. If she was willing to give her life, her memories, her soul, carrying her memory was his sacrifice to contribute.
Draco's posture changed has he heard those words hurled at him. The class turned stony silent as what Finnigan had said traveled. Hot anger curled at the base of Draco's spine. He punched his lips together, putting together a plan.
"What do you want, Potter?" he sneered instantly. He could see Daphne rolling her eyes out of the corner of his eye.
He passed by Blaise, who was supporting a fresh black eye that wasn't their this morning. Blaise simply shared a glance with him, his expression told him everything. Montague. Draco hoped Montague didn't target Theo. Theo always had thin skin, probably due to his father's overbearing personality. Blaise could take care of himself, he had to.
Draco decided whenever Umbridge had turned a frightening shade of purple to intervene. "Professor, please." He gently grabbed the magazine. His gentle grip tightened whenever Umbridge started to hyperventilate. "Professor!" he yelled.
The fire Draco was facing warmed him and provided light for the book he was sure he was destined to never finish. Dinner had been surprisingly uneventful, as Pansy was tensely quiet. Theo had skipped dinner, Draco had assume because his meeting with Blaise in the owlery had gone well, as neither of them had been at dinner. Draco had made sure to steal some bread and cheese for the pair. Crabbe hadn't comment about earlier, Draco doubt he was even apologetic, but Crabbe was never one for social graces. Pansy could be bothered with social graces, but usually not in her anger. She had been unlike herself this semester, unfamiliar in her grief. The pressure she was under crushing her spirit. Draco had hoped, a tiny part of him in the back of his mind, that Pansy would get furious with him. He had hoped that she would fight him, hit him, anything would be better than this void between them.
He was yanked by his ankle high into the air. He gripped his wand with all his might. He moved to cast at the person by the corner, but had to change to shield himself from a stunning spell from the person that had been following him. This was a trap.
"Nothing, I know nothing. That's the problem. I think she's… it's like when she first came to school after her dad died," she warned.
Daphne started to shuffle in between the damn tables. "Cho! I didn't see you there-" she broke into conversation with Potter's date as if they were old friends.
Draco knew Potter's anger, he wouldn't be surprised if this avoidance lasted a week. His chin quivered, he laid his arm over his eyes, needing the pressure. He should've handled Potter better, he just needed reassurance in their relationship, a simple explanation would have sufficed. But what was he supposed to say? After all, Potter's accusations were true. Draco couldn't be seen with Potter, and it was because of his name, but there was so much more at risk for Draco. Why couldn't Potter see the risks Draco was in? Why was he so utterly stupid?
"No, of course not," Draco comforted, "I just thought that after the fight with Finnigan, you wouldn't… want me anymore."
Finnigan glared at Draco, but Draco was careful not to give him anymore reason than he had to be angry. Whatever that reason was. Where was Professor Hagrid? Of course this would be the day that he would be late. Draco, wanting to deescalate the situation, turned away from Finnigan. He glanced at both Theo and Blaise, silently telling them to stay quiet.
He was in too deep, he knew this. He would drown in this and it would be worth it for a second more of this comfort. Eventually, Potter said goodnight with a glance at Draco's lips. He wanted to kiss him.
“Zabini-" Draco comforted, Zabini was harshly gasping for breath, shaking violently, "Blaise…go to the restroom and get yourself together,” Draco placed his hands on the shoulders of the shaking boy, grounding him.
This was for the best. Potter would move on, forget Draco and the darkness within him. The distance would only help Potter, Draco would be selfish to try and mend the relationship that was between them. "We don't have to meet anymore if you don’t want," his voice didn’t shake, but he couldn't meet Potter's eyes. Draco couldn’t make himself see the relief that he would find there. "I understand if this changes things, if you're uncomfortable, I could make other arrangements for someone else to teach you Occlumency."
"Don't let Potter hear you say that," Draco prompted. This was the first time someone has ever spoken badly about beloved Dumbledore. Through his will alone, he made himself investigate over the splitting headache that was bright behind his eyes.
Draco observed as Potter watch Cho leave. Potter blinked, his eyes met Draco's. Draco clenched his fist so he wouldn't reach out to comfort his friend.
"No! This is a beyond idiotic situation," Severus snapped, he turned to Draco, "and you're an idiot for being a part of it. Do you know how dangerous this is?"
"Thank you both. I'm thankful to have such understanding, sensitive acquaintances," he stated, sitting down across the pair.
Draco chewed, thinking back. He almost choked. "Ah, shit, just forget about it," he stumbled. His neck hot.
Thankfully, Draco had worked all summer on researching the cabinet. Keeping his mind clear of any prying eyes was easier if he was focused on a subject every few were interested in. The dry subject manner of his studies kept him steady whenever someone was prying into his mind.
Ice wrapped around Draco. Fear froze his heart. Water in his lungs. Claws down his back. He couldn't breathe.
"Draco, may I apologize?" she asked, her eyes still downcast. The room went quiet, all eyes were on Pansy in her uncharacteristic humility. Draco could count on one hand all of the times Pansy had apologized to him; it was zero.
Sirius steadied him with a glare. "I grew up with my brother, if you want information, don't be a coward. Just ask." He saw right through Draco. Draco would blame the headache for being so translucent.
Draco wanted to follow Weasley's lead, to put his head on the desk to sleep after last night, but he couldn't. Not with Potter sitting so close to him. It's not as if the two had never sat next to each other before. After last night… Draco knew the energy between them had changed. How was he supposed to talk to Potter now? Surely Potter wouldn't try to extend their new relationship outside the walls of privacy, would he?
He wondered what Potter was doing. He wondered what type of teacher Potter was. Potter was probably brilliant at teaching, but what spells was he showing the DA? Had he moved onto more advance defense spells? Perhaps Draco should show Potter what spells would be most often used against him in battle, some of them wouldn't be covered in a Hogwarts education. Draco should make a list.
Potter studied Draco, Draco met his eyes. What was Potter looking for? Eventually, he must have found whatever clue it was, because Potter continued to lead to way.
"I see, there is no reason for that. I've told you, you are not responsible for the actions Daphne Greengrass," his Lord explained.
“Is that a compliment? Are you impressed?” Potter teased. He slowly lowered his weight onto the bench next to Draco, surprised when the piece of furniture stayed intact.
He could make out the words clearly now. Potter was talking. Draco peaked behind the corner, his stomach twisting.
"Necessary for what?" Dumbledore asked. He was leading Draco to the answer he wanted to hear. Draco rubbed his face, thinking of a way out of this. He knew the consequences before he attacked Finnigan, the pros had out weighted the cons. What he hadn't considered, stupidly, was how invested Dumbledore would be to the reasoning. Draco would have preferred for the Professor to look at the problem for the face-value, not looking into the core.
"Merlin…that, doesn't explain anything Potter. But so long as you're not taking me to the forest that students are, for good reason, not allowed in, I think we can manage," Draco teased.
Draco could also admit that Potter was a huge dickhead when he lost his temper, and he had a lot to be angry about.
"Don't," Draco ordered, "I know you're under pressure, but don't. Your family has a solid hold on their standing and you know it. No one is trying to strip your family of their power, while mine is having to claw back into his good graces like whimpering dogs!" he lectured.
"Actually, I'm going to sit here, thanks," he replied nonchalantly, taking out his materials for class.
Draco slipped his hand under his pillow, he pulled out his side of the two-way mirror he had given Potter last year. Potter's green eyes met his, illuminated by the quite white light of his wand. "Are you ready?"
His sob was painful against his sore ribs. He was a monster. "My friend's funeral was a few weeks ago," he explained, his voice wet.
Dumbledore continued, "This does not seem like a reaction to some name calling, would I be correct?"
He was used to entertaining himself. His parents were not the sort of people for play. As a child, he thought all grownups  didn't like to play, as he had gotten older, he discovered that his parents were simply distant people.
Plus, Draco was selfish enough to cling to this as long as he could. How could he not? Potter was his lifeline to knowing there was actual genuine good in this world. And… Potter wanted him. Draco was never wanted before, never sought after. Draco's life had always been a give and take for power, for privilege of being a Malfoy. Potter would like him even if he wasn't a Malfoy.
Potter was nowhere to be seen throughout the day. Where could he have gone? Draco had searched everywhere, Potter wasn't in the infirmary, he wasn't quick enough to avoid Draco the entire day. Where could he be? Draco also noticed that only one of his shadows remained in the halls. Granger, but she seemed tired and wrecked with…worry? Why was she worried? What happened? Was Potter alright? Was he wrecked with an illness so worrisome that St. Mungo's was the only option? Where were the Weasleys? A family matter surely, Potter was a Weasley by proxy. What? What happened?
"Yes, we have an idea," Blaise interrupted. His voice steady for someone buttoning up his shirt. "Where is everyone else?"
"I know," was all he could say, finishing his smoke before putting it out in the grass and leaving with his new, unexpected ally.
Granger and Weasley walked in, not even noticing Draco as they argued about something or another. Potter followed in after them, but instead of following his friends to the front of the class, Potter took the seat next to Draco instead of his usual one. Draco's stomach dropped to the floor.
Amends? Amends for what? "You see right through me, my Lord," Draco played along as he scrambled to put the pieces together.
“Listen to me, you need to dry your face and go to dinner, okay? Can you do that for me? I can help her, I can, but you need to cover for me, okay?” Draco took Zabini’s face in his hands. Brown eyes met grey, panic met calm.
"Daphne, I don't disagree with you but Potter would never teach a group of kids the dark arts, I don't even think he knows them," Draco conflicted.
"Don't play dumb with me!" Severus snapped. "I know what you're going through, what you all are going through. Don't push me away. Let me help you," Severus begged, standing in front of Draco's seat.
Severus had a few choice words to say to that attitude, but Madam Pomphrey sent him out of the room so Draco could rest.
Crabbe and Goyle talked across the table about a topic that Draco didn't bother to follow. Nott was frowning over a complicated Potions Theory book that Draco had read last month and didn't understand, so he naturally recommended the series.
Merlin, Potter's eyes were so green. Draco swallowed, "Well, who else would bandage you up? Really, Potter, you must be Madam Pomphrey's least favorite student."
Her eyes widened, then relaxed as Draco came into focus. Daphne smiled brilliantly. He was enclosed into a tight hug around his shoulders.
Tonks and Potter both stared at him with surprise on their faces. “I was just going to help you with your nose,” Tonks explained with concerned gentleness.
Pansy's eyes searched Draco's, trust was a rare, fragile thing during war. Draco waited, holding Pansy's gaze. Pansy pulled out of Draco's reaching, pulling out a letter from her uniform robes.
"I'm being stupid," Potter faced Draco, but Draco kept his hands on Potter's back. Potter's hands were rested on his shoulders. Green glassy eyes met Draco's, and he was reminded by how close they were.
Draco casted a spell for burns on his arm, but to no avail. He wasn't expecting simple healing spells to work on whatever dark magic Dolohov had wielded.
"It's complicated? So we can be friends here but not in public? Why? Why is it complicated?" Potter stood, standing in front of Draco, his breathing heavy and his brow serious.
Potter took him to the Astronomy Tower. Professor Sinistra lived on one of the main levels, so Draco complained loudly about the stairs, having Potter bent over in laughter. Potter was always quick to a laugh after Occlumency lessons, he needed the pickup.
Standing in the doorway was a woman with bright pink hair and narrowing eyes. “Tonks, we were just-“ Potter stammered over an explication.
She looked behind her, saying something that Draco couldn't hear, before looking down at Draco and miming smoking. He nodded.
“Do I really need a reason?” Draco played back on the earlier response, finishing up the bandage. The girl remained quiet after that, her chain lowering to rest on her knees. Draco watched as the girl flexed her hand against the bandage, testing the stretched skin underneath. He should leave, he has done what he needs to do, but he couldn't talk himself into leaving. He was comfortable here with this small stranger.
Draco allowed the silence carry his answer. He was still shaking. His arms felt overused and tired, but he couldn't go back to sleep, not now.
Dumbledore clasped his hands behind his back. "Malfoy, I want you to be safe. I know you to understand the dangers you are putting yourself, and your family at," Dumbledore explained, as if to a child.
"Your guess is as good as mine," Daphne rose from her seat, her plate not even touched. She turned her back, leaving them in their shame that they all carried, but for different reasons.
"Really? An omen of death and despair; majestic? A little too depressing, even for me," Theo teased.
Draco looked away, closing his eyes, not wanting to get involved, but too curious to move. What could he do? There was no way to appeal to a sense of unity now, the Slytherins had broken into pieces, that much was clear. There was nothing he could do. All he could do was watch. He swallowed passed the familiar feeling of helplessness. 'This is nothing like that,' he reasoned. A coil of panic was swarming in his stomach, he swallowed past the lump in his throat.
His hands were so red against the white of the sink. Draco looked himself in the mirror. There was blood on his cheek, his neck, down to his chest and hands.
"You can't simply be a cat, there's no way you would have been able to see me with the charm on. Perhaps you're part Kneazle? Is that it?"
Draco watched as a masked man grabbed Potter's arm. Potter was pulled to a stop. Granger turned as Potter yelled. The Death Eater shoved his fist into Potter's jaw. Potter's head snapped back.
Pansy didn't say anything to him, but Draco didn't think she was angry with him. He suspected the required return to their homes was the source of many Slytherin's anxieties. The Dark Lord had stolen the safety of their homes away from everyone.
Draco's hand found Ron's ear, his grip tight as he twisted it as his mother used to. Ron's face twisted in the sensation, both of his hands on Draco's wrist, trying to break Draco's grasp. Draco used Ron's momentum and lack of balance to yank him off of Draco's chest by the ear. Ron went to the ground, Draco still had his grip on his ear, twisting painfully. Draco released him, only to be pulled off of Ron by two strong arms on his chest.
He was supposed to meet Potter tonight. He made sure to put on just enough of his cologne. No one asked where he was heading off to so close to bedtime. Everyone tends to mind their own business around him these days.
“You need to go to Madam Pomphrey as soon as possible, she can help with the scarring,” Draco ordered, he continued with, “why didn’t you go see her earlier?”
"No, not this summer," Potter explained before going into his recent adventures with Dumbledore. How Dumbledore used Potter as a carrot on a stick to talk Slughorn into teaching at Hogwarts again. Draco's thoughts, not Potters. "Were you invited to his private dinner?" Potter asked.
Draco took a shaking breath, trying to calm himself so that he doesn't continue to give more information than he means to. "If you have suggestions about how I teach Potter Occlumency, I'm all ears. Just remember, they are just suggestions. Nothing more," he stated.
"Our greatest sympathy for your tragic lost," Lucius shook Mr. Greengrass's hand. The father in mourning just steadied him with a heavy stare.
Dumbledore walked in, appearing regal as always in dark navy robes. A somber look was directed at Draco. Professor Dumbledore sat in the seat where Severus had just been sitting across from Draco. "Well, well, Mr. Malfoy, what are we going to do with you?" Dumbledore's slight tilt of his head, followed by his silence, twisted a knife in Draco's gut. He ignored the steady panic that was pooling at his spine, keeping his sight steadily meeting Headmaster's gaze.
This could be Draco's rebellion, a way to forgive him for his sins, this righteous action. This small action, he could do, he could stand with Potter, if only for a brief moment.
Mr. Weasley's eye widened at Draco's forwardness. He glanced at Lucius before answering in a nervous tone, " Fine, thank you."
Severus's grip on him only tightened, but he didn't say anything. Draco's jaw tightened until it blistered pain into his temples.
Draco's stomach clenched painfully. He could taste the bile gathering at the back of his throat. He gathered his resolve, building a wall of stone around his heart. He would not let Potter see him cry over him.
A hand shot out of the toilet, grabbing Draco's shoulder and pulling. Draco thrashed against the arm, the bubbles erupted in intensity. The entire toilet seemed to shake with the force of the arm. The pipes swelled under the pressure. Draco yanked himself free of the hand, stepping back out of reach.
Potter with his wonderful green eyes, with his unruly hair, with his warm hands, and his pulsing broomstick-
Luckily, someone knocked on the door, interrupting whatever Severus was about to do. "Enter," Severus ordered. The door opened, Dumbledore walked into the blue light. He was dressed in a long silver robes, he appeared to be an eternal spirit. "Dumbledore," Severus greeted, brushing pass Dumbledore as Dumbledore stood in front of Draco. Dumbledore nodded in recognition.
After what the Weasleys had done for Draco, he hope they survived the next stages of a war they knew was coming.
The two shared a quiet moment between them over gentle smiles. Potter reached out and squeezed his hand.
"Malfoy, I trust you have Potter's best intentions at heart. I know the risk you are taking just by sitting here discussing this with us, much less being in the forefront of Potter's training," Dumbledore explained.
"It's okay," Draco whispered, his voice weak. He watched as Potter gently traced the dark scar that was branded into Draco's skin. He didn't look at the mark with any particular disgust, just observance. Potter probably would never have a chance to study a dark mark this close. A shiver ran up Draco's spine. How could Potter be so tender with the scar on Draco's arm? Draco could barely look at the blemish on his skin without his stomach turning.
"Thank you, Professor," he smiled politely. Umbridge patted his hand gently, perhaps in a comforting matter, before continuing her walk around the classroom. He looked over at Potter, who was making faces at Umbridge behind her back. When Potter turned towards Draco, Draco made a gagging gesture while Umbridge was still turned away, much to Potter's glee.
Pansy's face redden, her lips tight. At least Draco had managed to distract her from putting the pieces together.
With that, Draco was pulled by the shoulder to a corner of the room. Lucius kept his grip bruising as he whispered a warning threat into his ear. Draco was shoved away, as if his own father was disgusted with him. He turned, but his parents had their backs to him. They were making their way to mingle appropriately.
Someone in the castle wanted Draco to hurt badly enough that they attacked him. Hurting people is hard, that's what no one had told Draco. That was a lesson he had to learn for himself. Hurting others can hurt you. It gets easier, as time goes on, to numb yourself, to put your heart into a cold place inside yourself for protection.
"Potter. Out of all the people. He isn't even good at potions, is he?" Blaise continued to rub the sore spot.
"You scared me," Potter seemed surprised as Draco by his words. "The way you fought, I wanted to pull you off, but I couldn't stop… watching." Draco let go of Potter's hand. "I thought you weren't going to stop." Draco didn't speak. Potter now knew of the part of him that was twisted. Draco had shown too much of his soul. Potter continued with his work of Draco's hand. "But when you did," Potter went on, "when you did stop you were so… cold."
Draco stood, needing to break this fight before this got bloody. He wasn't the only one, Astoria dived past him. She grabbed two fist of Pansy's long hair, yanking her over the back of the couch. Pansy hit the floor with a painful thrash.
Why did he write that? Of course Potter didn't trust him. Draco considered letting Pansy skin him for his stupidity.
Draco winced in sympathy at Potter's screams. His eyes glazed over as Severus entered his memories. Draco stood, stretching his back as Potter's eyes tightened in concentration. His attempts were futile, there is no point of putting up a wall of hay against a dragon. Draco walked behind Potter's seat over to the large bookshelf. Most of these couldn't be found in the library, not even in the Restricted section, he couldn't stop his curiosity.
Draco pulled him into another kiss before he could say those words. Those words would make everything so complicated, but so very wonderful. Potter melted against him, pulling him in even closer, lacing his hand in Draco's hair. Shivers slipped down Draco spine.
Potter grabbed Draco, "Table!" he whispered hurriedly. The Room supplied a bare wooden table in the center of the room. Potter shoved Draco underneath. "Table cloth!" Draco said, sliding under the table, he quickly Accio'd his book bag to him from across the room. Potter hurried to the door, opening it to let someone in.
"I'm not a shade slut," she swore. Draco yelled in laughter, Daphne snorted while she shoved her hand over Draco's mouth.
"Screw you, Potter," he barked. Merlin, he was an idiot. He shouldered Potter roughly as the elbowed his way in between the group like a proper ass. Potter gave him a face that would be expected in such a situation. Draco took it to mean something along the lines of, 'What the fuck?' Draco gave him a face that meant, 'I'm sorry I'm an idiot, but I have no idea what I am doing.'
"What, don't tell me you don't see it. You think about sucking face too, you shouldn't be so judgmental."
"What can you do to help? Changing the times you meet. Making the times more random would be lovely, actually," Draco concluded.
"How was everyone's break?" Theo asked. Draco took a large bite of his porridge so he didn't have to talk as Crabbe and Goyle struggled for answer.
That would be too much of a fucking privilege, but also the worst sin he could commit in a long line of sin.
The sound of his fist on Finnigan's face dulled, only the sound of Draco heart remained in his ears. Draco's hands were numb in pain, Finnigan looked up at him, bleeding from his crooked nose and split lip.
Draco rolled onto his side, propping his head on his hand while he face Potter, who was lying on his back. "Potter, how could you? You know I can't resist gossip," he fake gasped, an exaggerated hand on his chest.
The two Slytherins continued eating, Blaise remained stonily silent after Draco’s small effort at comfort. The rest of their circle continued with their conversation, allowing them privacy.
"He doesn't have to explain himself to the likes of you," Crabbe supplied, striding over and using his size for intimidation. This forced both Draco and Theo to take a step back to allow room for Crabbe.
Silence cloaked the previous joyful collection of students. "Shows over," snapped Draco, , and the group broke away in silence. Bulstrode stood from the floor, her face bloody and her noise probably broken, but she left the room with a square jaw and strong shoulders.
He was confident that Potter would keep his secret, if for nothing else that Potter had almost no one to tell that could incriminate Draco or challenge his status. Of course, it would still be a huge pain in his ass if Potter had told his shadows. This was less predictable; Potter was inseparable from Granger and Weasley, but lately he had been more withdrawn. Draco was confident he could persuade Potter not to tell their now shared secret if Draco just managed to talk to the boy.
Potter shrugged, playing with his sweater sleeve again. Draco moved closer to Potter, wanting to be in his presence. Potter looked up at Draco, "Daphne Greenglass," Potter stated. Draco rose his eyebrows for Potter to go on. "You two… seem to be spending a lot of time together," Potter prompted.
Draco took the smoke. He leaned into the flame provided by a lighter from the man's pocket. Inhaling deeply as the cigarette was lit.
Draco's hand tightened on the door knob. Maybe if he just runs they wouldn't chase him. Undeniable proof? Who's words would Dumbledore take as truth? Potter. Why would Potter tell Dumbledore and not Draco? Something happened, something bad.
He was late for dinner, of course, but the food was still hot. Daphne sat across from him, Astoria to her right, Pansy to her left. Theo sat next to him, making conversation with one of the Carrow twins. When Draco, Crabbe and Goyal arrived from detention, they were flooded with questions about the fight. Draco, always one to take attention, gave a very detailed, slightly exaggerated, replay of the event.
The pair dispersed into chuckles between them. The cloak of shame Draco had wrapped himself in was lifted from his shoulders as Potter grinned at him.
Potter stared at him, his eyes wide, his back to the window. Draco shallowed, his ears heating. He attempted to pull himself out of Daphne's arm, but she only gripped him tighter with both hands.
"…No. We just have to make sure to play nice. It'll be helpful to be seen together every one in a while."
Severus recommended this book to Draco in person, he probably knew Draco would struggle though the complicated text. "That greasy bastard," he cursed under his breath.
Draco's heart pounded in warning. They were too exposed here. Potter was the only one who could use his wand fully. They had to get out. Now.
He opened his eyes to meet a gaze of vibrant green. The infirmary was dark with no candlelight providing any illumination of the large hall except for a small orb of soft blue light appearing from Potter's wand. Potter smiled, but his eyes were scrunched in concern. "How are you feeling?"
He would be tired, two hours later, if Potter's screams didn't dig into his skull like claws on a chalkboard. He had gone past tired, his brain was buzzing with screams and the contents of the book he had to focus on to stop himself from stepping in. Severus's teaching style was… idiotic. Draco had seen ruthless, he had been through ruthless teaching by the hands of his own mother. Severus was just being petty. Weeks had gone by, Potter's dreams only worsened. Draco had turned to Severus because he had believed in his teaching, Draco himself had flourished under Professor Snape. Flourish under Severus at his best.
"Since you met at the Hog's Head. Really Potter, you’ve only had, what, three meetings? You have to be more careful," Draco showed off.
He could feel his body shake with the contorting he was doing to keep himself from weeping onto the floor.
"Shit, I'm sorry," he said. Mafalda paused, frowning. "That's a shit name," he clarified with a grin.
Draco was an idiot. Why would Potter come here? He had Granger to heal his hand, why would he need Draco. He should just leave, he wasn't needed, so he wasn't wanted.
Shocked yells from behind him made his blood cold. He turned to the distant yells echoing from the only door left ajar.
"Well, if you must know, I was on my way- shit!" he stood up, scampering over Alfie. "Looking for my bookbag," he called over his shoulder. The time for lights out was almost arriving, Draco doubted his Prefect badge would carry much weight after the fight he had gotten into earlier that day.
Astoria was the opposite of Daphne in almost every way. Astoria had taken her father's dark brown hair and eyes, instead of their mother's fair blond hair and blue eyes. Draco couldn't remember ever seeing Astoria in a group outside of her sister's usual crowd. She was only seen with the Harper boy, who stayed clear of Draco's social circle. Draco had also seen her with the muggle girl, Mafalda, a few times.
Her voice was warm, kind, and lovely, much like her entire being. Her hand had remained on his shoulder, a kindness. Draco could feel a pressure move from his stomach to behind his throat, his nose and eyes. He had to get away, now, he couldn't let anyone see him like this. He pulled away from Daphne, her kindness, walking away, he tried to slip into the night so that he could grieve in silence, away from anyone and everyone. Draco hurried away from her, farther into the night, but he stayed close enough to touch the castle's walls with an outreached hand, needing support. He didn't hear any footsteps following him. When he couldn't hold the overwhelming feelings any more, he allows himself to sink to the ground onto his knees.
Potter took his place at Draco's side. Draco couldn't stop himself from staring at him. Potter's face was knitted in concern. "Look, Astoria, I'm really sorry about your sister-"
Children's screams, not truly able to understand what was happening as the Dark Lord raised his wand.
Draco had Potter in a loose head-lock, more like a hug, really, as Potter could stand fully and with ease. Potter had his arms around Draco's waist, which Draco was not thinking about. Thank you very much.
"Ew, no," Draco covered his ears with his hands. Theo kept talking as he started to push Draco out of the room. "This is my room," he argued.
"The Ministry is the highest order, he should be honored that the Ministry as finally decided to step in at Hogwarts," Draco gossiped.
Warmth covered Draco's side as Potter sat closer to him, his arm around his shoulder. "Draco," Potter was so close that his breath brushed against his neck. A hand found its way around Draco's bicep.
"Someone good if you decided to wait until now to tell me," he snapped, a twist off worry settled in his spine.
Draco's hands tightened until his knuckles were white. "If you are trying to explain the risks of my situation, don't bother, I'm very aware of the dangers."
Potter’s hand didn’t move from Draco’s face, “I want to see you soon, can we meet tonight? I have so much to tell you.”
If Draco could just find out what Dumbledore was hiding, then he might have a breakthrough with Potter's lessons. This is how Draco had found himself in the library during his free period.
Draco stared down at the page in front of him. His eyes were sore not from reading, but from trying not to cry. He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He decided to pass the couch for the privacy of the table underneath the stairs. The torches were dimmed for the late hour. Most students were in bed.
Potter shoved him in the shoulder, "Don't give yourself all the credit, Draco, I'm just as argumentative."
"That was costumes! This was music! They are very different," Draco argued, "now punch me in the stomach and make it look believable."
He watched over his breakfast as Potter entered the Great Hall with Mafalda. Potter scanned the Slytherin table before finding him with his eyes, he met his eyes with a nod. At least something is going the way Draco wanted.
Draco was grateful for the lack of other Slytherin students in this class, the other Slytherin students that were in the class kept to themselves, which, at times like these, made Draco grateful for the quite moment. Draco took notice of the charm being reviewed for O.W.Ls, a simple ignition charm they learned in first year. A cauldron containing a small bundle of easily flammable dried grass was on Draco's desk in the back. Draco began to hurriedly take out his notes for the class, trying to appear productive.
Potter sighed as he leaned against the railing. He looked up at the clear night sky. His elbows resting on either side of him. He looked so casual, so easy in his grief. Draco knew something would boil against Potter's skin soon. Boil out and blister and burn him until his chest ached for relief. Draco's did. "I'm tired," Potter didn't look at him. "I'm tired of so much, I'm tired of losing people. I'm tired of being angry all the time. I'm tired of walking around eggshells with my friends. I'm so sick of people dying for me, I never wanted anyone to die for me."
They arrived at Hogsmead. The weather was almost warm, so students lined the outside of shops eating sweets. Hogsmead was a quaint town, but the thought of this place always made Draco feel lighter from the memories. The couples in the street caused the perfect backdrop to his and Daphne's 'date'. Appearances had to be kept, after all.
There was no one here to read a thought that had simply crossed his mind. There was no one here watching him. There was no need for Draco to so carefully force himself to blend in with the background.
Draco took the glass. He took a sip for something to do with his hands. He studied his old professor. The dark bags under his eyes. The deep frown lines that made him seem so much older than his mid-thirties. This war had yet to begin, but the pressure was already wearing people like a heavy cloak.
Draco had decided to count each nail as a pink item for his little game he played in this pink hellhole. "Yes ma'am, this is truly horrible," he swore.
Bad idea. This would be the first time they met in broad daylight. What if someone saw them without the cloak of night to protect them? Draco shouldn't go, the danger was too great.
In the end, Draco let Umbridge decide who was on the Inquisitorial Squad. Now he was stuck working with a bunch of assholes.
Crabbe, in all his social graces, shoved Blaise. Blaise was caught by Bulstrode with ease, and somehow managed stay on his feet. They were starting to gain a crowd.
But he wasn't charming enough to get out of detention, so he had no idea how he managed to get out of detention.
Draco followed Potter in as he smiled. "I don’t mind at…all…" His words trailed off as he entered the main room of the house.
He as shown her too much, she knows what he would do. The humiliation with Montague proved how far he would go. Daphne would be even more careful around him. He had to gain control over the situation.
Daphne rolled her eyes as they walked along the path to Hogsmead. "I'm not some beggar, Draco, your family wouldn't let you marry a peasant after all."
Daphne stepped back, her cool temper knifing through Draco. He wanted to take it back, but he couldn't. Daphne didn't say anything as she turned, walking away.
"Wait," Potter stopped him with a hand on his bicep. He turned, Potter stood close, not moving his hand.
Draco was facing Potter while he was acting an ass around him and his friends, so didn't see Weasley shove Draco in the back with strength Draco wouldn't expect from the thin boy. Draco stumbled several steps forward, almost falling down but managing to steady himself. He turned, "What the ever loving shit are you thinking, Weasley?"
Draco and Daphne had managed to sneak away unnoticed, but they would be needed soon. They sat on a couple of large overturned pots, originally used for plants. Daphne had only plopped down on the make shift stool, unworried about the pale blue cloak she wore so often. Smoke curled along the ceiling as they bitched about their respected families.
“Ah, sorry about that. I would try to patch you up, but my healing magic is all sorts of whack,” Sirius turned back into his human form. Draco wondered if he always turned into a dog when he was surprised.
A fact he had accepted. If he accepted his death, he was less afraid while doing his work. Or so he told himself.
"Only the best I'm sure," Parkinson sat on the other side of Draco. Draco's skin crawled as her hand slid up his arm onto his shoulder. She leaned in closer to his space. He could see each of her lashes as she steadied him with eyes that would peak his interest if he was mildly attracted to women.
What had him in such a strange mood? Why was Severus being cruel instead of comforting whenever Draco almost lost a friend?
The window opened, Daphne narrowly missed the pebble that Draco had already thrown. He shrugged at her raised eyebrows.
The door was smooth and cold against his hand, warning him of the dangers within it. Draco cracked the door open slightly so he could glance into the room.
Draco read until his head hurt and his gaze blurred. The Room wouldn't supply him another text. He didn't know what he did to deserve such horrid treatment. Did he speak badly about the Room? Did he hurt the Room's feelings? Was the Room sentient enough to mind when Draco burns it to the ground for such awful treatment against him?
He arrived to the span of wall which turned into the door, he rushed through the door. The room looked as it always did when he and Potter were alone, ugly orange couch in front of a warm fireplace with two purple chairs on opposite sides of the couch adjacent to the fireplace. The fire had dim sum, but Draco could still make out a figure laying on the couch. Draco walked over to the sleeping person, not surprised to find Potter there, sleeping soundly.
Draco's neck and face was warmed by his blush that travelled down to his chest. The fire behind Potter created a glow about him. The glow was almost has bright as his soul.
Draco tensed, his shoulders tight. "Appearances keep us alive in this world," he glared at the two, "both of you will do what you need to. I'll keep your secret as long as it is convenient, so don't be stupid," his lectured harshly.
Draco caught the box, Potter's face ended dangerously close to Draco's. The pair froze, their faces only a couple of inches apart.
Maybe he was being a fucking drama queen. That's what Daphne would say. Draco thought that’s what she would say.
"Not ones that I can't win," Draco joked, but Mafalda just frowned in thought. "What's wrong?" he investigated.
"Fuck off," Draco dismissed, sitting between the two. Pansy sat across from him, sitting in between Crabbe and Goyle.
Draco was starting to understand just how manipulative the Dark Lord was. No need for formalities one moment. Bathing in blood the next. The Dark Lord walked the line of confidant and executioner. Draco had to gain his trust.
For now, he focused on the problem he needed to fix. Before he could fix the cabinet, he had to understand what was twisted. What was broken. What was bent into a shape that had to be molded back. Magic was complicated.
"Why am I not surprised that it's you getting into trouble?" Severus's familiar voice questioned Draco. Draco turned towards his godfather, only to be met by one risen eyebrow at the sight of his bleeding nose. "Having fun are we?"
After washing, the Slytherin made the walk to his common room. He would see Potter again later tonight, he could achieve his objectives then. The only sound his own footsteps echoing on the tiles of the castle. The school always had an out of world feel whenever there was only one set of footsteps. Thankfully, dinner was still continuing, so Draco made his way in silence.
Draco grabbed Potter's hand, pulling Potter behind him as he ran, following behind Granger and Longbottom.
"Ms. Greengrass!" McGonagall yelled. Daphne froze, still holding Pansy by the neck in the stew. "I think that's enough."
That wasn't good enough. "You don't honestly expect me to believe you would risk Potter's sanity on a well-placed argument?" Draco challenged.
The words were just behind Severus's lips, that much was clear. The door behind him opened, Severus kept silent, his head down.
Draco sighed, he hadn't thought he would be asked all of the hard questions by a twelve year old. "Yes."
"My apologies, please, sit," Umbridge motioned towards the pink chair across from her pink desk. Draco took his place. "Tea?" Umbridge offered, as she raised her wand to the tea set, pink, that laid on a table, pink, across the room.
Draco laid on his bed looking up at the canopy. His room was warm, but only barely. His bedside lamp was the only source of light.
"Not until he makes progress," Severus dismissed, "you didn't make any progress before because you coddled him."
Mafalda did nothing but watch. She eventually pulled out a notebook to write down a short note. Names, perhaps? She crouched down, petting the feline whenever he brushed against her leg. Draco shifted, he was getting stiff behind the armor. This girl must have incredible patience. He watched her watch the hall. Mafalda rested her chin on her knees. Why didn't she bring a book or something? Wasn't she young? Don't young people get bored? Was she bored? Draco was. Probably because he was young. She was young, he was older than she was. He wasn't going to have less patience than someone younger than himself. He would stand here as long as she sat there. Even longer, just to prove his point.
The sound of crying stopped him. Granger started to sob. She covered her face as no tears came. She was lying.
He looked around the room. Catching only glances of two dark figures before more spells were thrown at him with shaking force.
"Well… the fire works in mysterious ways that aren't always comprehensible to us, but perhaps the event foretold is happening sooner for you than the other classmates," Firenze guessed.
His toes blistering in pain, he shuffled with his back to Potter's table. Potter was silent behind him, but Draco could tell his date wasn't going spectacularly.
He turned a corner. The back entrance was opened, harsh yellow light spilling onto the path. Draco's stomach punched into his throat as he recognized the bud of a lit cigarette.
Severus had arrived in a hurry. Draco could almost promise that he had seen actual worry in his expression. Must have been a trick of the light.
He took a seat in the middle of the couch, letting his muscles relax by the warmth of the fire. He laid his cloak along the back of the couch, putting his bag on the side table beside the couch. How long should he wait for Potter? They didn't say they would meet tonight, but Draco just wanted to be sure.
Draco's ribs ached with the laughter. His stomach cramped in a way that wasn't twisting. Potter was laughing just as loudly. Too loud. "Shhh- Shut up, Potter," Draco hushed as he lowered himself into giggles.
"Mr. Malfoy, the fact of the matter is that you fought another student. Now, however regrettable, we are a school for young people, and tempers are sure to run high, resulting in disagreements that may get physical," Dumbledore lectured. "The point that I am most concerned about is the pure level of violence you have shown to be capable of. Violence of this level can be explained only by extreme circumstance, but you managed to channel that darkness for a mild inconvience. If I am being generous."
“I know, I’m sorry. It’s just... you surprise me that’s all,” Potter stuttered, shuffling his feet and avoiding eye contact with the Slytherin. “No one else knows... I promise,” Potter finished, he looked up at Draco to further his swear.
The side exit opened into the Manor's extensive gardens. Draco let himself pause, breathing in the cool night air that only smelt of copper from his body soaked in blood. The gardens were glowing in the pale light of the moon. Blood looks black in the moonlight.
Draco swallowed down the lump in his throat. She was so honest. What was her motivation? Why be genuine now? What did she have to get out of this?
He gathered the items in his pockets, putting them in his hands. He turned on the lavatory light, the harsh white light making him wince. Draco dropped into the sink the; two cigarettes, the cleaned knife, the bloody handkerchief, and Daphne's zippo lighter.
"That's enough," Draco interrupted Pansy's innuendo. Pansy looked down at her plate after deciding not to give Draco a dirty glance. Draco's fight with Finnigan had a better affect than he had been expecting.
The man was suddenly much closer. Draco stepped into the cold brick along his back. The need to run buzzed at the base of his skull, but he stayed.
Mrs. Zabini's smile enclosed her entire face. She rushed to her son, wrapping him in a warm hug. Blaise held his mother just as tightly, his face in her shoulder. They laughed and talked warmly as if they had just been a part for a day. They linked arms as they left to their home.
Draco turned to face Theo. What Theo was doing…how he is, could get him killed. Probably by his own father, the horrid bastard, he had to know that. Was his life worth risking? Draco had to be sure before he took charge of the situation. "Theo, this place, Hogwarts, provides shelter, but only temporarily. You know that," Draco inquired.
He dug into his pocket, trying to find one of the objects he had bought with his mother. "I thought I should get you something you would actually like," he gave the present to Daphne.
The tone of his voice made her flinch. She wrung her hands together so tightly that her knuckles turned pale. "I-"
"Draco," Potter had prompted himself up on his elbows, looking over at Draco with one eyebrow raised.
The silence was heavy between the three of them. Daphne, who apparently was suicidal, just continued smoking.
The tension in Draco's stomach only tightened. Was the Dark Lord only acting out of concern for Draco's feelings? That was a dangerous idea to flirt with. "I do sir," Draco pushed past the warning in his conscience. He had already killed one Greengrass sister, her blood still drying on his hands, did he really have to drag another into this battle with him? Astoria knew too much, he couldn't risk his life.
Draco allowed himself to be stunned into silence. "I can't be involved," he spoke quietly, "Don't rely on me to make any introductions."
"It sucks a bit, yeah," Draco agreed before getting to the subject he was sure Crabbe was checking in on, "I checked in on your father."
He tried to push past her, but Quidditch had made Cho strong. She stepped in front of him with her hands on his shoulders. She made him stop.
Potter stepped out from behind the shadows from the tall trees. Draco’s shoulders slumped. His heart sped up. With one concern look from Potter, he could almost be washed away of this pain of this spring break.
"Of course it is, I always enjoy your company," Draco comforted. Potter's eyes widened, the words having an effect on him. Draco should be embarrassed, but he couldn't find the shame within himself. Potter distracted him from himself, these meetings allowed Draco to escape from his own thoughts. Potter stayed silent, but Draco was steady in his honesty. "I don't know what I would do without you," Draco spoke.
Potter reached a hand out to him, Draco couldn't meet his eyes as he shrugged Potter off, crossing his arms over his chest. Potter's hand remained there, as if ready to reach out to him again, before letting the hand drop. "Draco, don't listen to him, let's just go," Potter whispered. Draco wouldn't move as Potter gently pulled at his sleeve.
"Oh, what are you going to do? Are you finally going to stop hiding behind your older brothers?" Draco baited, Weasley had always challenged Draco verbally.
"Oh…um, yeah…" Potter played with the sleeves on his robe, "I was hoping I could ask for a favor," he pleaded.
"Delicious, is it not?" his Lord commented next to him. Draco just nodded before continuing his meal.
Mr. Weasley tightened his gaze at Draco. Draco suspected that for the first time, he was being seen as himself instead of his father's son. An iron grip found Draco's shoulder as Lucius squeezed him with almost bruising force in warning. There was a cold burning in Draco stomach that wanted to make everyone sweat. He was starving for some form of control. He liked the taste. Despite the grip on his shoulder, and his mother's icy glare, Draco didn't take his eyes off Mr. Weasley. His smile only stretched further across his face.
Daphne let go of Pansy, only to be hit over the head with an empty bowl of stew. Draco flinched in sympathy.
"Professor Snape will discuss your punishment for your actions earlier this year, I think I have gotten my explanations," Dumbledore stood, turning his back to Draco.
Crabbe took the one page letter. Draco waited for a look of disappointment to appear on Crabbe's face, but he just smiled to himself and folded the letter up with much care. He stood up, awkwardly standing at the edge of the table. "Um…thanks," Crabbe said, "I owe you one." He promised to Draco before leaving.
He kept his sight down on the leaves he was chopping, but he could feel the heat of Pansy's glare on his face.
Draco's interest was piqued, Pansy did gossip, but she had an uncanny ability to always find the truth. "My fiancé?" he asked, still not looking over at her.
Draco supposed he went wrong when he brought the Weasley's mother into this, and the song might have too much, but Potter said no to all other forms of mocking. Plus, Draco had spent too much time writing the song to not have every Slytherin student sing along during their match.
"Merlin, shut up," Draco leaned over to take one of the mirrors. "They're two way mirrors, idiot, so that we can talk to each other without raising suspicion," he explained.
The silence between them made Draco stomach turn, "yes, well, I caught them on my Prefect rounds, so I thought you should know, as you're their Head of House. Now you know, so… I'm… going to go… if I may, Professor," he stuttered before shutting his mouth firmly.
Finnigan didn't know what to do with Draco's non-threating demeanor, he had been prepared for a fight, not a conversation. His feet shifted, but he kept Draco at wand point. A shiver went through the crowd as Draco visibly slipped from hot anger to cold calculation. "Yeah, what of it?" Finnigan snapped, his hand was shaking now.
"Mafalda, she's in Slytherin," Draco told Potter. Potter's lips pinched together at the information, his shoulders stiff. He would need some convincing. "She's a muggle born, she's in secound year and no one talks to her," he tried. "She stopped Montague from finding the DA today, she threw a cat at him."
The break from his father's abuse gave Theo the room to grow. He had an easy smile about him, one that was only facing Blaise. The summer only allowed Blaise to become even more handsome, having filled out in his jaw and shoulders. Blaise met his gaze then, and gave a friendly wave.
"Please, we never hang out anymore," Potter pleated. Draco wouldn't say no. Not to the twinkle suddenly in Potter's eye. Not to the easy smile on his lips. Not to the joy in his voice. Draco couldn't say no to Potter, not if what he could give him was within his power. Potter grinned widely as he slowly realized that Draco wasn't going to say no. How could he? "It's not like you're going to say no," Potter leaned in, his nose almost touching Draco's. Draco scoffed. Potter pulled a piece of parchment from his pocket, not bothering with the Invisibility Cloak.
He wished he could love her. He wished he could be the man who wouldn't slit her throat to save himself.
Draco rolled to his side, there was an emptiness behind his closed curtains. Night had already fallen.
The light in the large room was dim, but gentle. Draco's body was tense, waiting for another attack. Nothing. They hadn't been followed. As Draco steadied his breathing, he turned at the sounds of whispers, his wand raised. Potter jumped next to him, his wand raise as well.
"Well, boys, is everyone looking forward to this shit show of a year?" Crabb broke the tension the best he could.
The whip circled around the air, reeling back before lashing at Draco for a second time. Draco rolled out of the way again. Pain screamed across his arm as he barely escaped the fire.
"It's just…this is the only place I can be myself, or, at least, a closer version of myself," Theo didn't meet his gaze.
"I would really like a partner in crime, I can't possibly piss off everyone in the castle all my lonesome," he explained.
Draco reached out for her, tucking a strain of long dark hair behind her ear. "You won't return to your mother's," he explained. Pansy nodded, letting go of his hand. Draco reached over her to collect his things. He could feel Pansy's eyes on his back as he made his way to his dorm.
Draco nodded, his lips tight, "I see, surprisingly Theo, I've known for quite a while now," he prompted.
Bones struggled to get to her feet, but didn't hesitate. He pulled out his Peruvian Darkness Powder out. He threw the powder as far into the hall as possible. If Cho and Bones were careful, this gave them a way to escape without being seen.
"My only way of rebellion," she explained, her voice sore, pulling out a cigarette and lighting the tip with a lighter instead of her wand.  Draco could see her delicate features as the small flame caused light to dance across her face. She inhaled, drawing the smoke in into her lungs with a slow, experienced drag before releasing the breath. She looked out at nothing, everything covered by darkness.
Draco would have to be more careful with Potter. If Potter asked, Draco suspected he would follow Potter to hell with his heart in his hand. Merlin, he was so fucked.
Draco turned to his cauldron, looking for his wand for an embarrassing amount of time before finding it in his robes, Flitwick remaining patience the whole time. Draco found his wand, “Incendio,” he spelled. The contents of his cauldron lit with ease. He turned to his Professor who was observing calmly.
Mr. Nott took his step to walk alongside Lucius. He didn't bother to address Narcissa as they walked. Theo kept his eyes casted downwards, but he started to walk alongside Draco. Draco felt the tension from Theo, who wouldn't speak to him. Draco was too much of a coward to bridge the gap between them now. He wondered if that was the first time Theo had seen someone die. The sounds of the heads of their families accompanied the many footsteps up the hill.
The weather outside was warm as February bled into March. The bleakness of white winter was breaking away for the bright colors of spring. Draco made his way down to Professor Hagrid's hut, where class met. Theo and Blaise both nodded at him in greeting as they all met at the top of the hill that gently sloped downward towards the singular building where their Professor lived.
The bodies kept changing, but Draco didn't stop eating. He didn't stop when they begged or cried, or when his teeth continued to fall out. They left their hearts vulnerable, he enjoyed a feast.
Draco looked at Daphne, for some reason, he had expected for her to look different on their betrothal day, more regal perhaps. Less like a girl and more like a woman about to be engaged. Graceful, like his mother. He supposed that was the naivety of being a man. She didn't seem any different, she was out of her usual school uniform. Besides that, she was simply herself.
Draco looked away when he saw some of his peers. He hadn't expected for his sin to have a known audience. He studied the gardens that could been seen through the large windows that lined one wall. The massive hall of the manor was lit by the large, extensive chandeliers that lined the center of the high ceilings. The moonlight didn't reach the room, as the chandeliers showered everyone in a gentle light. The moon was full, bathing the gardens in an ethereal glow.
“Oi, Malfoy!” someone yelled at Draco, followed by the rush of hurried, loud feet within the hallway.
Dumbledore had taken his seat in a large armchair next to the fireplace. He motioned for Draco to take the armchair opposite. Draco did has he was told.
For all she had claimed to understand, to be aware of, she hadn't met him. She didn't have blood on her hands. Her parents had protected her the best they could. They couldn't protect her now. No one could.
Draco had waited until Blaise went to soothe away Theo's nightmares before he attempted to lay back down. His own curtains had remained tightly shut as Blaise whispered calming words to his boyfriend. As the weeks had passed, Draco hadn't forgotten his own silencing spell around his bed. His nightmares had been deadly.
But what was his comfort worth to the parents of the child he had killed? Daphne's mother smiled, a slow cruel smile that made Draco want to run. He knew the next words out of her mouth were meant to be cutting. She was going to do has much damage to him as she could. He pushed himself into cold detachment. "Well, your concern for our family is a bit late, don't you think?"
"I think you're more than just brilliant," Potter prompt his head on his hand, looking down at Draco.
Granger yelled. Rabastan stumbled backwards. His head hit a jar on the table behind him, the glass cracking.
He took a complicated path to the room. He never used the same path consistently. The sounds of classes beginning filtered out of the rooms as he walked by. Maybe he could skip his next lesson to get more work done on the cabinet. A lot was relying on this to work, he had to make this work. He didn't have a-
Draco walked Potter near his common room. "Let me be a gentleman," he insisted against Potter's complaints. He couldn't walk him all the way, but they could find a room without paintings to cast curious gazes their way.
"She… needs something from me that I don't think I can give her," Potter's voice was quiet, he wouldn't look up.
What the fuck? "Umm… Professor," Draco looked towards Severus, who was rubbing his temples in aggravation, "thank you for the concern-"
Her feet never touched the stairs as she flies to the hard, brick floor. Pansy hit the floor front first, her hands to her chest.
Daphne blinked at him a couple of times. Draco raise his eyebrows. "My chair, darling," she prompted with a chilling smile. He looked at the space between his table at Potter's.
"I know that, but… I don't think it's enough to just defend yourself against the dark arts, you have to know how to use it too."
All of the air left Pansy's lungs, her shock clear on her face. "I want you to help me," she begged.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please forgive me, I won’t cause you anymore trouble-" Potter kept chatting into Draco's shoulder, now wet from Potter's tears. Draco cupped the back of Potter's head, his other arm still wrapped around his waist.
"I think he might kill me," she whispered. Her face strangely calm as she said this fact. Daphne's eyes looked into the distance, she could be seeing the very moment she died and she would still be steady handed while she smoked.
Draco continued down the hall, keeping to the edge while other students milled around him, lowering their eyes and quieting their voices. There was a time when Draco would appreciate the authority given to him, but now he knows that such authority equals unwanted attention. He plays the part well, he knows, but the constant attention sends chills down his spine and makes everything sharp.
Kindness was so easy for Potter. As if this simple movement didn’t make a hot blush flush Draco's face. Draco could smell Potter, was he wearing something? Should Draco be wearing cologne? Did his breath stink? Was his palm sweaty?
"…you being promoted? Fine, I suppose I can promote Daphne instead…" Draco shrugged. Of course Potter didn’t need a best friend, he already had two.
“Can I fix this?” Draco asked gently against the screaming of memories inside his head, loosening his grip on the tiny hand.
This revelation made Draco feel dirty to the core. Simply having thoughts against his family, his Lord, was a betrayal worthy of death. A cold grip in his ribs brought tears to his eyes.
Zabini stopped, visibly losing the breath from his lungs at the sight, Draco could see the color drain from Zabini's face. Zabini went still, not breathing.
Potter opened the door quickly when he knocked, grabbing him and pulling him into the Room. The Room looked different in day than at night. No orange couch, no fireplace. Instead, the room appeared larger to fit all of the students in the DA. There was no furniture, but newspaper clippings and pictures were on one of the walls.
"Well, me. Of course," Draco managed to say with a straight face. Potter and Draco locked eyes, before the pair started laughing. Potter gripped his stomach in his laughter, his laugh joyful and warm, cozy. Draco allowed his laughter to leave him, feeling lighter than he has all week. Potter was still laughing, Draco's chest felt as if there was a bird within his ribcage. "Perhaps I'm not the best example," he joked, causing Potter to chuckle in agreement.
Potter's jaw clenched in defiance, he flexed his hand against the attention, "I'm sure you know where," Potter assured.
Potter pulled his hands away, inspecting them before slowly looking up at Draco. "That's your blood, Draco."
"If I asked for questions, Potter, they are allowed. Surely you can piece that together, or perhaps Quidditch as caused you permanent damage," Severus dismissed.
By the third lesson, Severus had suggested that Draco's presence wasn't need. He was about to agree whenever he had caught Potter's eye, silently begging him not to leave. Of course, Draco then refused to leave. He was grateful to be there, to sooth the tension between them, to buffer whatever fights almost broke out.
"I know," she breathed. Her forgiveness was something he was going to have to earn, but she understood his situation. Draco turned his face toward the fire, Pansy's hand moved from his face.
So, Draco had underestimated what being in a safe environment could do to his tight grip on his emotions. A stupid mistake, but one he could learn from. He could give himself that kindness. He could admit he needed to be kind to himself.
"We could hide you, Dumbledore could protect you. Have you told him? He'll help you, Draco. I know he will." Potter had taken both of Draco hands in his.
"These are my ways, Potter," Draco continued the banter, smiling, an unexpected giddiness dancing in his chest. He leaned back in his chair, relaxed. Potter brought his hand to his mouth, trying to hide his smile, Draco assumed. Deep purples and blues covered his hand, the red markings of Umbridge were unmistakable. Draco didn't say anything.
He kept walking, not even slamming the door behind him so that Severus would have to shut the door himself. Draco kept walking, blood in his ears, his cheeks red in embarrassment. The boiling anger in his stomach turned into shame that seeped into his spine.
When Draco was sure he had calmed down enough to face his jury, he turned to the large crowd. Mr. Nott had brought a tense looking Theo, whose face was as distant as Draco's heart. A large bruise was blooming across Theo's jaw, his father no longer trying to hide his abuse. Crabbe and Goyle stood with their respected families, not as somber has one would expect for them to look. Perhaps their parents hadn't told them what they would witness tonight in a feeble attempt to protect their sons.
Greyback's eyebrows tightened in thought, smoke filing to the air. "My pack and I are heading out soon, I think I'll be back for summer."
"Degree number twenty-six will take effect immediately," Severus sulked, his displeasure obvious as he lectured. "The degree will prohibit instructors and professors from discussing matters outside of the subjects pertaining to our lessons." His chilling stare swept across the dark classroom. "Any questions?" he asked.
Draco was hurried back to his room as soon as he wasn't actively bleeding. Potter had begged Dumbledore to let him stay in the infirmary. Draco had explained that this was for the best. No one would expect him of treachery if there wasn't anything to suspect.
He crossed the doorway of the Great Hall, his head still down. He had to leave. Find a place to breath.
Draco continued to pet Bentley. Mafalda drew her knees to her chest, resting her chin on her knees. "Why did you ask if you already knew what happened?" Draco inquired. When Mafalda didn't answer, Draco spoke in a gentle voice, "What do you want to know?"
Draco looked at the pair, they were still holding hands tightly. "I'm happy for you two, I am," he started.
Draco tried not to physically tense whenever Potter entered Slughorn's class late. Draco sat at the back of the class. He didn’t like the way Slughorn looked at him, like a Death Eater.
He had spilt blood. He had taken the life of one of his only friends while her parents watched. He had begun to actively plot in a war far too large for him to take up a banner. He was so young. He was still so naïve. What was his comfort worth to them? They would push him away no matter what he did. The truly merciful act would be to ensure Daphne's blood had not spilt for nothing. In order for her sacrifice to be worth of any use, he would have to become what everyone thought he was.
Severus released him, Draco turned to the voice, his breath caught in his throat as he met Potter's eyes.
"I didn't mean to- who would want to stay?" Myrtle asked more to herself than to Draco. "I just…was too scared to leave."
The girl shrugged, "the look on her face was worth the detention," was the reply. Draco nodded, understanding the feeling.
"Class is over," Theo stated with a roll of his eyes. Draco looked around, all of the students had risen, gathering their bags to continue to their next class.
Draco helped himself to the cabinet, letting Potter unravel his mind in piece. "Let's get out of here," Potter was standing right behind Draco.
Draco wasn't particularly keen on being a Prefect, but, his Father and his father's Father had been and so on and so forth… blah, blah, blah… duty, family name… bullshit, bullshit and more bullshit. Whatever. The point is that Draco was stuck walking through the halls monitoring other students behavior and wasting his own precious time. This was hardly worth the nice, fancy bathroom and the authority to piss off anyone he pleases. Pansy uses the bathroom anyway, she wasn't even a prefect! Well, she was, but she turned it down by flipping off Severus whenever he tried to lecture her on her new duties within a week of returning to school. Within a month of the father's death. Severus had yet to appoint another Prefect, which meant that Draco had to double on his hall monitoring. Draco had to be the one to escort first years to their Common Room, disgusting little gremlins. Draco had to be the one to… blah, blah, blah…bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
Severus pushed himself off, now pacing behind the desk. "You are going to get yourself killed, and for what? A boy that doesn't even care about you enough to realize what danger you are in?" he yelled.
He was lucky enough to have just flicked the bud out of the open window when the door slammed opened.
Pansy leaned in further, her long hair touching Draco's face. "Her mother wrote to her yesterday morning after you left," she whispered into Draco's ear, "the letter was about Daphne's generous dowry."
Draco turned to Theo, only to be hit over the head with a textbook. Draco stood, following Theo out of the Great Hall, laughing. Draco had to be careful to stay at least an arm's length away, as Theo kept trying to hit Draco with as much force as he could.
"Talk to the toilet, Professor," he said, glaring at Severus. Severus's jaw clenched, he pinched the bridge of his noise.
"Yes, actually," Draco lied. Crabbe wasn't in any of his classes, due to being held back a grade to catch up, so Draco was certain Crabbe wouldn't fact check him.
"I'm glad to hear that, as I understand, there was a bit of a close call?" Draco tilted his head. He was playing with fire. He couldn't make himself stop.
He tossed the watch on his side table before laying down on his bed. He would sleep for a bit then slip into the Room of Hidden Things during lunch. There was no use on working if his work was sloppy and unfocused. He was struggling to focus already. His back ached, the salved helped, but broken bones were easier to heal than burns. He turned to his side. The phantom pain of heat making him shiver.
Draco had quite the predicament on his hands. Potter was aware of his knowledge about his little army. Not only that, but Potter was confident enough not only to confront Draco about it, but also to tell Draco the location of these training sessions, something Potter would only do if he was absolutely sure Draco knew all of the information beforehand. This could only mean that Potter knew Draco had been sitting on the information and had not used this information for his own gain. There was no point in Draco even trying to deny Potter’s accusations.
"Did you mean it?" Potter asked. Draco voice caught in his throat. This was too much. Not whenever he was just about to break Potter's heart. "Draco," Potter reached across the small table to hold Draco's hand for the second time tonight.
"It's not just nightmares! It's-" Potter reached for his scar subconsciously, the movement was stopped as Potter froze. The weight of the scar on his forehead, how this could affect them, sending chills down both of their spines. "He's in my head," Potter whispered. "I've tried to tell Dumbledore, but he won't talk to me. I don't know why. I'm-" Potter gasped painfully, "I'm scared."
Potter sighed, "Look, Malfoy…I shouldn’t have said all those things, I was a jackass. I'm just…" Potter struggled for the words.
Daphne's delicate hands shook as she took another inhale from her cigarette and blew the smoke directly into Lucius's face.
There was a sense to expect his panic to finally boil to the surface of his skin. For the detachment that he had slipped himself into when he stole Daphne's memories to strip away.
Potter lead him down a winding path that Draco wasn't paying attention to. The realization of where Potter was taking him crept up on Draco like a bad chill.
Draco unsure fear quickly turned to a hot rod of anger in his stomach, "And I supposed you would know of unfit coyness, wouldn't you?"
He hurried out of the library. Cho had thought he was a victim, like her. She had offered him kindness because she had thought they had shared grief. If she knew, if anyone knew, they wouldn't have so much sympathy for him.
He stood, he was done with this place. Daphne followed suit, pausing as he paid. Draco didn't bother with his manners, or his appearance as he let Daphne follow him out of the pink shop.
Montague placed a finger on his chin, appearing thoughtful. "What were their names again…?" he pondered. Draco struck.
"Merlin, Professor. There is someone stuck in the pipes of the toilet," Draco explained, frustration clear. He grabbed Severus's cloak sleeve, pulling the slightly taller man alongside him, motioning the urgency of the situation.
"Don't play dumb, it's just us. You can't leech any power of off my name without an audience," snarled Draco, moving into her space.
"Oh my god," Granger gasped. The head turned into a baby's then to an old man's. Again and again. Constantly shifting from smooth to wrinkled. Constantly shifting from crying to yelling in pain.
Potter didn’t say anything for a long time. Occasionally sniffling, but never pulling away from the comforting arms around him.
Potter held his eyes, Potters eyes were so green, even at a distance, before glancing towards the exit. Draco looked away, knowing what to do. He waited a minute before excusing himself to the lavatory.
"Seeing as Professor Slughorn won't allow me to use any of his facilities outside of class, I tend to use Snape's classroom often."
He almost was at the bottom of the page, he almost convinced himself that he had nothing to worry about, when he found the line of initials.
He was sitting in a chair too large for himself. A feast laid out on the grand table that was in front of him. Warm bread filled a plate, a saucer of rich butter was next to it ready to be eaten. A roasted chicken still steamed next to a creamy gravy. A Yule ham was in the center of the table, appearing to have been perfectly prepared. Roasted potatoes, delicate vegetables and minced pies all waited to be enjoyed. His mouth drooled at the sight.
Rabastan was tackled to the ground before he could kill Draco. Potter was rolled onto his back by the larger man. Yells vibrated against the walls.
He was too shocked to be angry. His face hurt too much to yell. Draco watched as Potter turned away from him to follow Weasley down the hall, Granger not far behind. Draco cupped the blood coming out of his nose, his head still buzzing.
An easy smile formed on Draco’s lips, “I’m safe now, we don’t have anything to worry about.” Why was it so easy to lie to Potter? He was so quick to keep the truth from him, to shied Potter away from what he was really like.
Draco thought back to Severus's cruel behavior at realizing his feelings for Potter. "Your suspicions would be correct."
Alfie looked between the two of them. "Um, I think I left my glitter pens upstairs," she explained as she left.
"Simple, but effective," was Draco's answer. All of these spells would be helpful in an attack. "Where did you get that?" Draco motioned to Potter's abused hand.
"Of course it's not," Draco answered quietly, making this moment just for Potter, even if they had an audience. Draco touched Potter's shoulder, resting his hand, trying to steady both himself and Potter. "We're friends, Potter," Draco promised.
He started to play a game. How long could he go without talking to another student? So far, his record was ten days during O.W.Ls.
"Perhaps," her voice was blisteringly loud as she started to mock the Dark Lord, her voice high and shrill. The room froze. "Perhaps this, perhaps that," Daphne spoke from deep in her chest, practically growling. "Perhaps you have no fucking idea of how disgusting you are. Perhaps you're too stupid to see what is right in front of you. Maybe I was 'swept away by the romance,' what sort of bullshit is that?! I knew exactly what I was doing. I only wish I could have done more."
Fire blossomed in Draco's gut. His heart pounded in his chest. Claws of hot fury ran down his back as his wand lengthened into a whip of fire.
Bulstrode and Blaise stood together. Blaise looked at Theo, who looked as if he was about to cry, but he didn't say anything.
He wished he could honestly give Daphne's parents his sympathy without splitting at the seams with his own grief. He wished he could give them the mercy of not forcing them to face their daughter's executioner, her murder, at her own funeral.
Draco moved his hands from the sink to fold in front of him, continuing to press his back against the sink.
"Malfoy," the She Weasel stepped next to her father. She was glaring at Draco with a daring challenge. Draco blinked. Her gaze reminded him of a pair of bright blue eyes and the smell of cigarette smoke.
"I hate you!" Daphne screeched at their Lord. Draco took out his knife. He laced his hand into her long hair, pulling her head back so that she was looking to the sky.
Pansy flinched, but flowed Draco out of the Common Room. She was silent as she walked behind Draco, letting him lead her through the silent halls into an abandon dungeon. There were no torches this deep down into the castle, Draco cast a spell over their heads which provided a clear, yellow light. He then charmed the room to be silent to outside ears. His back was to Pansy, his stomach turned painfully. He should apologize, there are so many things he should apologize for. He doesn't know how.
"Draco, as my future husband I feel like you should know this about me- I. Love. Cake." she explained clearly.
"Just listen first," Draco begged. His stomach coiling, but not from hunger. When Potter nodded in agreement, he continued. "I don't think your connection with the Dark Lord is caused by regular magic," he began. "Frankly, I think I've shown you all that I can with what information I have to work with."
Lucius easily defected the spell. The sounding of breaking glass sent claws down Draco's back. Everyone raised their wands. Potter held a glowing ball to his chest.
"Me too," Draco agreed. Potter stilled next to him. Draco glanced over his shoulder, Potter was swallowing past his tears that had begun to corner in his eyes. So much grief weighing on such frail shoulders. "It wasn't your fault," Draco comforted. "Daphne, she knew what she was doing. She knew of the dangers."
His footsteps pounded on the hard bricks. His heart thumped in his ears. His lungs complained from the sudden activity.
The blast echoed across the room. Reverberating in his bones. Shouts from everyone pierced his ears.
He took that has his cue to leave, making sure to grab the Quibbler on his way out. He smiled as he glanced over the article once again. Pride started rising into his chest. Potter knew how to be a little shit.
The class was ruined whenever Umbridge arrived for Hagrid's observation. Draco stepped away from Potter, taking his place next to Theo and Blaise. Umbridge questioned Hagrid on everything. Draco wasn't particularly fond of Hagrid, but Umbridge's criticism was painful to watch.
"Joke. A joke," he blabbed, "joking. Yes. Huh… Pansy is such a bitch," he crawled out from under the stairs. His neck sweating.
"I was just wishing your father a good recovery. I couldn't imagine losing my father at such a young age," Draco lied with ease. If the Weaslet were to hex him where he stood, Draco wouldn't have been surprised.
"My, ah," Potter was blushing a dark color that Draco could make out even with the dim light, "my friend-"
Draco returned to the sinks to wash his hands, the clear water flowing from the facet onto his sweating hands. Draco had to get a hold of himself in reference to Potter. However, this was new to both of the boys, blunders had to be expected, but, Draco was not used to having less than exceptional social skills. His words had always been his greatest weapon.
Theo uncharacteristically bristled, "I don't have my mother's skirts to hide behind either, but thanks for the reminder."
"Did I see you make Montague, the Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch Team, cry? Yes, yes I did," Potter confirmed, but he didn't seem angry with Draco. Why? Potter grinned, "The guy is a dick, and he started it, he had it coming," Potter shrugged. Draco smiled. Potter continued with, "I'm just worried that he will give you a hard time during Quidditch meets."
“Potter…not here, anyone can walk by and then we would both be fucked. I’ll contact you later and we can talk then...alone! Okay?” Draco negotiated, softening his tone and his grip. The look in Potter’s eyes flashed with anger, before settling into a resolved, cold understanding. Draco’s only warning was a slight nod from Potter, before he was shoved away.
Severus looked towards Draco. Their Lord had Sirius. That's what Potter thought anyway. This was a trap. Potter new this, but he didn't care. He would willingly walk into a trap on the slight chance his godfather was in danger.
Draco hurried out of the library, his stomach twisting. His face hot with worry. What did this mean? Who were S.P.T and A.P.W.B.D? Why was his father researching this? Was he being ordered to by their Lord?
"Cart's taken," his voice was a knife to whatever poor soul happened to open the wrong door. When the door didn't close, Draco glanced at the entry. No one was there. With an irritated flick of his wand the door slammed shut.
Draco bit his lip, he would have to compromise. "Severus can join us for our lessons at my digression, but if he makes Potter regress in his progress he will leave."
"Draco, please," she looked down at her hands, her nails had been bitten to the skin. "I…I can't go back home," her lip quivered.
"Malfoy." Draco didn't look up as his Professor stood before him. He couldn't force himself to swallow the pity he would find in his expression.
The pair sat together across from Daphne and Draco. Blaise had dressed out of his uniform, he was wearing simple robes, green. Theo was in black robes, his eyes were tired. Deep circles under his eyes.
"Fuck!" a voice rang out as Draco fell to the ground. He hit the brick floor with a sickening crack in his shoulder and instantly started to roll himself away from where he landed. His instincts were right, a ball of fire scorched the ground where he had been.
"Legilimens!" Potter's head hit the back of the chair with the force of the spell, his eyes twisted in pain. He didn't even have a chance to prepare himself. "Pathetic," Severus shouted as Potter went slack as the spell stopped.
"I should have expected this from you, fuck I'm stupid," Potter grabbed his cloak, striding over to the door.
Potter faced Daphne, "Don't be late, I know you Slytherins like to make an entrance, but behave yourself."
“You can handle this,” Draco offered lamely. Knowing, deep in his diaphragm, that he would have to decide a course of action. Knowing that Draco did not actually provide any comfort for the stricken boy.
Draco took a shaking breath, he didn't know what to say to her. Daphne simply wrapped her arm in his, locking their arms together as they walked. "I…" he started, but he didn't have anything to say.
The couple of hours alone with Potter made him feel so safe. In that shack amongst cobwebs, mold and the ghost of bad memories, Draco felt warm. They had taken to holding hands while they had their talks, and neither of them complained or even mentioned the new development.
"We would love to show some Gryffindor snobs their places," Crabbe waved his fist in an overly enthusiastic show of support.
The girl stopped her weeping, Draco could feel her eyes on the back of his neck, the silence stops being a comfort in this moment as everyone stopped breathing.
There was no breeze through the tight trees, but the weather was pleasant. Draco made his way to the creek that wasn't too far from the edge of the woods. He had waited for his grief to hit him at the burial, but no tears had come. Not even when Daphne's mother had sobbed through her eulogy. Nothing. He felt nothing.
Longbottom was next, Granger in his arms. Lovegood followed with a tight grip on Weasley. Draco and the Weaslet were last.
The curtains were suddenly pulled back. "Wet dream?" Blaise grinned, leaning against the bedpost. Draco propped himself up on his elbows.
The Dark Lord watched this trembling girl beg for her young life. He said nothing as Daphne worked herself in a panic at his silence. Her sobs scratched against the skulls of the crowd, echoed against the high ceilings. Draco's stomach lurched into his lungs, but he wouldn't allow himself to turn away. He owed her that.
Draco's body felt too warm in his uniform. He was too warm his Potter's embraced. Potter was just staring at him, a blush over his cheeks. Draco couldn't take this anymore, he quirked his eyebrows in acknowledgement of Potter's gaze. Potter's eyes widen, before he pushed Draco to the ground.
"Daphne please," Draco pleaded quietly, "you know what he's like, you know what he's capable of." He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, taking her hand in his, a silent plea.
"You're always sleeping in study hall and history, I've also seen you sleep in the library," Potter countered.
"Explain what, sir? I don't know what you want," Draco played, "Pansy tripped over the doorframe like many students before her, I was too far away to catch her. They was also the unfortunate fact that she was holding a bottle of Doxy venom."
His knees hit the damp grown as he accepted the stones that bruised his body. They hit his arms, his chest, his shoulders. They almost hurt as much as raising his wand to steal Daphne's memories.
The two men glanced at each other. Draco had been correct. They all knew he was able to handle himself from an attack. This wasn't about Draco's safety at Hogwarts.
Draco repeated his attack. He was much more gentle with this retelling however when he told Potter that he didn't see his assailant.
"No Professor, of course not. I just cannot bare to listen to Potter talk badly about our Ministry," he baited.
He turned before he could enjoy the expression on Severus's face. Draco opened the door, only for a hand to harshly slam it shut. Severus was leaning into his space.
Potter didn't seem to blame Draco for getting him banned from Quidditch for life. Which is nice, Draco wasn't sure if he could handle Potter being mad at him again. Potter's anger was unfortunately awful.
"You blackmailed him?" Draco realized out loud. "You forced him to let you join didn't you? Do you know how utterly stupid you're being right now?"
"No, come back!" Pansy reached out, grabbing Draco's hand. "We'll stop, I promise," she confirmed, squeezing Draco's hand.
Someone running past him brought himself back. He jumped at her, wrapping his arm around her waist and pulling her flat against his chest as he backed to the wall. Praying that they weren't seen or heard as he laid a hand over her mouth.
This continued until they had no more books or papers left, then they moved on to pillows and cushions from around the common room, then collected from the dorms as other study groups started to provide their assistance. Hushed giggles filled the room as more people took notice and began to participate. Theo was soon lost in an artful stack of books, notebooks, paper, pillows and a couple of shoes provided by other students.
The hills of the country side lulled Draco into a gentle rhythmic trance. He was so tired of the crushing weight of the Manor.
The fire warmed their bodies that were lying on the floor. They laid on the blankets and pillows that softened the floor. Draco was on his back, his head supported by pillow. Potter was there. His head was propped by his arm, but he was looking down at Draco. He was so close.
"My Lord," he started. He had to pass, he had to gain his Lord's favor. The manor loomed in front of them, casting long shadows. "About my father…" The Dark Lord steadied him with a heavy gaze. Draco's chest was being coiled by anxiety. "I'm not sure of his mission… but I know that he's disappointing you. I won't. I promise."
Astoria's face was wet. She knew what this meant. She thrashed against Draco. "Stop, stop it, please just listen," he hushed her. She gripped his wrist, breathing hard against his hand. "I'm going to let you go," his voice shook as he whispered in her ear, "and you're going to run to the library." She shook her head, he could feel her sobs against his chest. "That is where you've been this entire time, make sure no one sees you." He shoved her away, relieved when she just hurried towards the library.
Snape had honestly given Draco a look when Potter was finished mouthing off. Nothing obvious to the rest of the class, but Draco understood it as 'you talk to him.'
Mafalda smiled, "Trust me, I know," she agreed, she looked ready to leave, but she bent down to help Draco with his bag.
The walls rippled with pale blue light from the torches lined the long hallway. The Department of Mysteries was tiled by black, smooth bricks. The glassy surface of the walls, floor and ceiling caused the light to constantly shift with fluid movement.
"Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore looked down at Draco. A twisting sensation settled inside his stomach, but Draco kept his chilled demeaner. "You would mind explaining to me what happened earlier today with Ms. Parkinson?" Dumbledore asked, "You're not in any trouble, we are just trying to have an understanding of the events."
Pain, so much pain. The taste of blood and dirt in his mouth. His back arching, twisting, twitching painfully.
The young girl took a long, deep drag from her smoke, seeming to enjoy the practice, before offering Draco one from her pack. Draco numbly took one of the cigarettes, holding as he had seen Daphne do as she lit it for him, cupping the tip against the nonexistent wind.
"Oh, please, Astoria. They would have offered me up to anyone to save their own asses," Daphne snapped.
"You were only three feet of off the ground. Just think of the experience as a free Quidditch lesson. I was pretending to be a bludger," Daphne shrugged off, "besides, I did ruin my dress for that tackle, so I think we're even."
"That's amazing, Draco," he heard Potter speak next to him. Potter started to pet the neck of the Thestral, he grinned at Draco. Draco's heart started to beat faster.
Draco clenched his jaw as the fake laughter continued. He should go to bed, but he still had homework to catch up on. The library was going to close soon. He focused on finishing his assignments quickly.
"That's exactly why she would. She's scared, Draco. I'm scared," Pansy explained, the weight of her reality crushing her.
"Over there," Potter motioned to a small table next to the fireplace on the far side of the room. Draco walked over from behind the couch, which was pink tonight. The smell of dinner met him. The table was set for one with his favorite dish, beef stew and scones. He started to drool immediately. He helped himself to fulling his bowl. "You looked like you were about to cry whenever Daphne took your plate at dinner, so I figured…" Potter trailed of, taking the seat across the small table without a bowl in front of him. Potter nibbled on a scone.
Draco watched them go, but they would just be the targets for cruelty if Draco didn't do something. Everyone was watching him, the crowed had been ready for a brawl, now he had the authority along with the audience. Draco turned to Pansy and Crabbe, the pair looking too proud at the situation. "Embarrass us like that again," he threatened in a uncharacteristically cold voice that carried into the crowd, "and I will personally ensure you regret it."
Crabbe and Goyle sat across from him. Draco dulled out their conversation. His skin crawled as they kept glancing at him. They looked at him to make sure he wouldn't lash out, to make sure he wouldn't snap their necks.
Draco enjoyed the pain that blistered from his fist as he punched Finnigan in the nose, who started bleeding with a yelp.
Draco didn't listen to the ghostly professor, but he didn't sleep either. His thoughts were too loud. The Dark Lord wanted to ensure the future lineage of pure blood. Arrange marriages were the best way to promise pure blood. Early pregnancies also promised many children. The amount of pure blood in England had been declining with the recent decades. More children from pure families were needed in order to preserve the culture.
But how? How could she not return to her own home without labeling herself as a Blood Traitor? Her mother would try her best to shield Pansy from any whispers, but whispers would continue.
He worked on his notes for his ideas to fix the cabinet. This notebook would go back into the Room of Requirement whenever he was completed with his research for the day. He was too paranoid to walk around with this information for longer than he had too.
"Oh, let him go," Crabbe had yelled out, he was the only one still in his bed, not bothered by Draco's outburst. Draco  hurried out, only hearing Crabbe's "Maybe we will get some fucking sleep," as he tripped out of the door after hauling it open.
"Blood is blood," his Lord noted in thought. "Draco…" His stomach plummeted as his Lord studied him under his red eyes. His heart rate sped up, begging him to run. Draco held his Lord's gaze, kept his face and mind neutral. Comfortable. Trusting. "Is this your way of making amends?"
He rolled off of her. She started to cough instantly. The whip released her and Draco released the spell where Cho was still struggling to breath. She fell to the floor as she took deep breaths of air, she was sobbing.
There was a cross way ahead in the hall, he could break into a run down a random side. He was faster than he looked.
Potter wasn't looking at him when Draco finally gathered the courage to face him. As Draco continued to look at Potter, trying to remember the sweet calm before the storm, Potter only sighed. "Your friends are assholes," was his great note of wisdom.
The two sat in quiet after that. Draco's eyelids getting heavy without Potter's distraction. He fell asleep more relaxed in this classroom than in his own bed.
Draco puffed out his checks, blowing air out through them. "I've got to go," he said, and dismissed himself with all of his social graces.
Farley proved to be interesting. She wanted to help Draco. She wanted to get him out of this situation they both knew he was in. She didn’t even know him, not really, just a distant cousin of a friend of hers. And yet, she still reached out to him in kindness. Kindness is a discipline, and finding people who take the practice seriously are hard to kind.
Draco had ensured himself a spot close to where the champion was supposed to enter with the help of Crabbe and Goyle and his own biting personality. He had hoped the champion would be Cedric; Draco had even made him a champion pin with his newfound crafting abilities. Cedric would always say hi to Draco in the halls with his charming smile. He would always talk to Draco, thank him for all of his support. He had even listened to Draco when he went on and on about the different strategies Cedric should use when facing his trials in the tournament. That excitement turned into pure dread at the sight of his lifeless body.
Then he wasn't eating Daphne, the meal changed and he was eating Cedric Diggory. Cedric held his ribs apart as Draco enjoyed his twisted meal. He could feel the blood drip down his chin. Another tooth fell out, he swallowed the tooth with the heart.
He waited for the spells to start. For whatever pain that would come. For the fighting to start. He waited for him to loose. For his identity to be revealed. Torture. Pain. Death. Nothing.
Draco dived onto the floor as a spell flew over him. He put up a shield charm as he hit the ground. His shoulder shook with the force of the next spell that hit his shield.
Her death was a sudden to everyone, including her, after he had taken her memories under her command. Her death was sudden to everyone, except him. To a murder, death was never sudden. To him, her death wasn't a surprise, but he still bled from clawing his heart out.
"We'll have to carry her," Longbottom stood over them. Draco nodded, he couldn't speak. What if Longbottom recognized his voice?
Draco lounged across the couch the Room had supplied him. After finding the two books Mafalda had recommended to him in the library, he had spent a couple of hours finishing his homework before leaving to the Room. The couch was soft, comfy, and an awful shade of orange. Similar to the color of the fur coat of its host.
The two left the room without saying another word. The halls were cold compared to The Room of Hidden Things, no lanterns were lit to provide light or heat. Draco turned to Potter, but couldn't say anything. Something had shifted in their relationship, permanently. The weight of this caused silence on Draco's part. Potter seemed to feel the same. The two stood there, feeling this change between them, saying nothing.
Everything being considered, Theo probably didn't do his best on Professor McGonagall's exam. He let both Draco and Daphne know exactly how they were responsible while they left the classroom during switch period, lecturing them both on their shameful acts the night before.
When a letter dropped for Pansy, Draco instantly tensed. The lettering was definitely Pansy's mother, this could not be good. Pansy didn't receive any letters, but she didn't send any either. Her mother would only begin communications if the news was dire. Pansy must have known this, as she just stared at the envelope. Draco reached for her hand, but Pansy snatched the letter quickly. She didn't open the letter, just stuffed the message into her robe pocket. She continued to eat her toast with a slump in her shoulders. Daphne took her hand, Pansy didn't look up.
Draco felt something nudged his elbow. Potter had slipped a large book across the desk. Draco glanced around the room, everyone else had either fallen asleep or was facing forward. Even Pansy was looking the other way. No one would see.
A loud slam on the door made the four look for a place to hide. The room was brightly lit. Clocks lined every surface of the many tables that lined the room. Parchment littered the remaining spaces. Draco pressed himself against the wall next to the door. He would be hidden behind the door once it was opened.
Trees lined the wide path up to the Greengrass manor, providing shade for the many people walking up to the large estate. All dressed in black.
"Okay," Draco whispered. He gently rested his hand on Potter's shoulder, leading him to the door. Potter's feet dragged, Draco thought briefly about carrying him. They made their way out of the lavatory, climbing the stone stairs slowly, their bodies weighted down in sleep. Draco fanatized about his soft bed with deep pillows.
The collective gasp of the students wasn't enough for Severus to correct Pansy's outburst, perhaps Severus was worried about her directing her embarrassment into anger. Perhaps Severus was too busy glaring at Draco to notice.
The blood washed away so easily in the shower. Draco turned the water as hot as would be allowed. His skin begged otherwise, but he let the water turn his skin red in protest as he soaked in the pain. The blood dripped down his body, turning the bottom of the bathtub pink then clear. Draco scrubbed his hair, his face, his body.
Draco swallowed, he had gotten stuck in his own trap, he would have to cut of his own foot to get out. "You don't want to tell me, fine, but," Draco tried not to flinch at the next admission, "but I'm not the best person to help Potter then." Dumbledore turned to Draco then, openly calculating him. He continued, "I can't help him if I don't know what I'm protecting him from, and it seems that you two don't think I'm trustworthy enough to be privy to that information." No one disagreed with him on that point. "I think the best next step would be for Severus to take up Occlumency lessons," he concluded.
Draco gave them a moment alone. The students filed by him, smiles on their faces. Easy goodbyes filled the train as students left to meet their parents and siblings.
Draco sighed, this wouldn't work if Potter was worried. "Come on, help me with this," Draco motioned for Potter to follow him to a table that appeared behind the couch. The Room changed around them has Draco imagined exactly what he needed for tonight. Draco laid his bookbag on the waist-tall wood table, then started to pull the objects out of his bag that had been expanded with an Extension Charm. Potter stood next to him, setting the objects in a more organized manner, although Draco hadn't truly needed help.
A knock distracted Draco form his activity of doing nothing. He ordered the house elf to enter, dinner was probably being served. Draco couldn't bother to remember the names of their house elves. After what happened to Dobby, he couldn't bring himself to without feeling as if he would be betraying Dobby.
Draco had been dismissed early, has he had not be a part of the actual fighting, only a witness. However, he still missed dinner. His stomach complained loudly as he barged into his dorm.
Her eyes squinted at the iciness in his voice, but her grin didn't waiver. "Why… aren’t you a little shit?" she growled.
Draco let Daphne hug him for as long as she wanted, he needed her trust. He needed to seem vulnerable, Daphne knows him, he would have to be convincing. Draco smiled gently when she pulled away. She wasn't crying, but her jaw quivered.
A rough shoulder against his snapped his thoughts back, he stumbled backwards, but managed to stay upright. Finnigan glared at him from where he had purposely slammed Draco out of the way.
Zabini stared, shaking. Any feelings Zabini had been pushing away flood to him, shoving their way up and out.
"Nothing- It's…I…"she ended with a sigh. Her eyes clouded over as she bit her lip. She studied Draco with knowing eyes. "I miss her, that's all."
Potter didn't need coldness now. He needed some kindness, some warmth. Potter would take the responsibility for Daphne's death. There was nothing Draco could do to pull that grief from Potter's hands. He clung to grief by the very tips of his fingers. When would the weight of the death that followed Potter, but had yet to find him, be enough to force him to the floor? How much blood would Draco spill and Potter bare the grief? Was Draco strong enough to carry Potter's grief, as well has his own? Was he worthy?
"I think you're underestimating your Godson, Severus. He has just proven to us that that is a deadly mistake," Dumbledore complemented Draco.
Shit. This wasn't how Potter was supposed to find out. "Our Lord may wish to continue my education with private lessons," Draco explained Pansy's gossip.
A gentle laugh left Dumbledore. "Isn’t there a bravery to meeting Death like an old friend?" Dumbledore asked himself, gazing into the fire.
But what if Potter did come by and Draco wasn't there? Would Potter assume that Draco didn't want to talk to him? Would Potter get angry with him?
Draco's blood ran cold as Pansy went painfully ridged beside him. Her face paled to an almost grey as her eyes rolled into the back of her head, the orbs bulging from her face. Her mouth opened in a scream that turned into a gurgle as black foam bubbled from her mouth.
After Potter entered, Draco motioned for him to remain quiet as Draco placed an Imperturbable Charm on the door. Draco tried to ignore the shaking of his hands, he did his best to appear confident and in control, not as if this very conversation could cost him and his family their lives.
Draco sighed, "It's not that, it's-" he waved at his book "-never mind, better for you if you didn't know."
He pulled his hand away from her, rubbing his face. His eyes glancing at where Potter had been sitting.
"You're shitting me," she responded. When Draco didn't move, but gave her a pleading look, she took her seat on the other end of the couch. Draco carefully placed his feet on her lap, hopefully she wouldn't hex him. Daphne started her daily reading of the paper, making few comments. She provided explanation for Pansy whenever she had a question about whatever subject she was studying. Theo joined their makeshift study group, sitting on the floor instead of one of the chairs next to the couch. Books and notes scattered across the floor. Goyle joined them, but he never contributes much. Goyle, surprisingly wise, just nodded whenever Daphne would try to explain something. Draco would help him study later.
"Surprisingly, I found that out on my own," he retorted to her teasing. "Just think about it," he promoted.
"You don't have any scars, scars automatically make someone seem mysterious," Draco argued, the banter loosening the tightness in his chest.
"Yes," she sobbed, she was standing on glass that was cracking all around her. "Yes, my Lord, I made a mistake. A stupid, stupid, mistake." Tears of terror ran down her eyes. The brave girl that Draco knew was gone, crushed under the probability of her death. She stumbled over her words, unable to say anything clearly through her quivering chin. Her face was hot in color, wet from tears and snot. She was trembling.
The two slipped into a comfortable silence, hidden away from the darkness that they knew was closing in.
"And who can see these creatures? What good is teaching students about a creature that they can't see?" Umbridge demanded, she managed to intimidate Hagrid despite the fact that she barely came up to his waist.
Potter's silence was defining. Cho was still crying silently. Potter seemed to slump with the emotional weight of Cho's grief. "I can't," Draco could barely hear him. "I'm sorry Cho, but I can't."
The burial wasn't for another half hour. Appearances had to be completed. Draco made his way through his peers. The former members of the DA all twisted their faces at him, but said nothing out of respect for the dead. He kept his head high but his gaze low. He didn’t know what he would do if he had to confront one of his peers that had seen him spill blood. Thankfully, everyone gave him a wide distance. The Slytherins wouldn't come near him in fear of the stranger that had replaced their fellow student.
He tore away from that path of curiosity. He needed to double check the type of wood that was used before he attempted this particular spell. Anyone could cast a spell, undoing layers of magic took pression and time. If he got sloppy, he could undo months of his work. He didn't have time for that.
Montague turned the corner, running past Draco's hiding spot. His face was bloody and an orange cat was latched onto his back. Montague spun in circles, his hands trying to grab the cat, but was only met with a hiss. Draco watched in quiet glee as Montague run down the hall while yelling at a surprisingly high note. Montague fell onto his stomach with a quick jinx from Draco, who had to bite his lip to hold his laughter.
"Just studying," Draco busied himself with gathering the books on the table. He jumped when Pansy pressed against him from behind, her front flushed against his back.
He had been almost correct in his initial research of the cabinets, he would need to read into some additional resources that only Hogwarts could provide. This project might not work, but it will help him get some peace and quiet. He felt eyes on him constantly. Teachers and students alike were avoiding him. While people stared, Draco would feel their eyes on him, could hear just the outlines of whispers, could see the fear people were trying to hide.
Love? How could he? How trivial. Unnecessary in his future marriage. At least he and Daphne understood each other on that. They would never love each other, care for each other, respect each other, maybe. Could he love her?
Draco started to do the mature action and proceeded to kick Potter's shins. This, naturally, caused Potter to kick back. When the two boys continued to kick each other with intensity, Potter was pulled out of his chair by his collar by his good friend Weasley.
"Merlin, you're a Weasley?" he realized. "My greatest sympathies." Draco turned to face Weasley. Alfie remained next to Draco. Potter was at his friend's side. Draco couldn't bring himself to meet his eyes, so he focused on Weasley.
How could Severus parade around the fact that…. Draco could even think about what his godfather had been implying, what it meant. Draco's chin quivered, he had to keep looking down in case someone were to walk by.
But what could Draco do? He was powerless. He had no abilities to help Potter, just has he had no say in his own marriage. He was worthless, powerless. Powerless to help Potter, powerless to help Daphne, his Mother, Father. Any move he made could be his last. He was only good for following orders, keeping his head down. Letting other people carry the burden of war and marriage.
"I'm the insufferable git who realized that your date was total shit-" he kept talking over Potter's loud protest- "that I got you a present to cheer you up." Draco pulled out the box wrapped in bright paper, tossing the box to Potter over the couch. Who just stared at the present that landed onto his chest. Draco lifted Potter's ankles before laying Potter's feet back onto his lap once Draco had taken his seat on the couch. The room had stop supplying chairs for them a while ago. Potter's feet only had knitted socks on them, as he had decided to leave his slippers off while laying down waiting for Draco. "Remind me to buy you socks for your birthday," Draco noted the holes in Potter's socks.
Draco didn't say anything as he took in the sight of Potter. He didn't look any different from a week ago when they boarded the train to leave. He supposed there was no physical change to himself either.
"He knows I pushed you down the stairs," Draco told only the half-truth. He suspected Severus was pissed about a number of things Draco had been doing.
How hurt is Potter going to be when he discovers how many people Draco has killed? That he killed Daphne? That he killed many more people over the summer from orders of his Lord?
Draco wasn't keeping track of the weeks as they passed. He was busy with studying for O.W.Ls. He was busy with the Inquisitorial Squad. He was busy with ignoring Potter. If he kept himself busy, he wouldn't have to think about his grief. If he kept himself busy he wouldn't have to think about what Dumbledore told him the night of Daphne's funeral. If he kept himself busy, he wouldn't have to think about what happen to Daphne after she died.
"I want to fight," she confided. Draco stopped, seeming shock by her words. She had taken the bait. Daphne started at him, her own words sinking in. She opened her mouth, before swallowing her apologies. "I will fight," she proclaimed, she seemed shocked by the fire within her. The fire that Draco stoked.
Draco and Daphne sat tightly next to each other, Daphne layered enchantments around them for sure privacy from eavesdroppers. The night was too early to meet in one of the lavatories, but the Common Room and dorms were almost surely empty. Precautions, however, were always a must.
Granger was unconscious. He gently looked through her coiled hair at the trauma to her skull. Concussion. Best if they didn't move her, but what choice did they have?
The doors gently closed behind him with a soft ding. The mechanical sound was the only noise as the elevator traveled back to the main floor. Draco stood at the end of the long hall he found himself in.
"Don't call me that!" Bulstrode screeched from the floor, her face covered in blood from Pansy's abuse.
"It's Valentine's Day," he stated instead of supplying Daphne with an answer. And Potter will be there. Plus, Draco had been meaning to find out what happened to Montague since he had returned last week from St. Mungo's. Daphne's sighed. She looked the part of a respectable betrothal, as she always did. In her usual pale blue, she stood out against the dark greens of the landscape around them, but somehow seemed to belong. "You're now worried about appearances," she was guessing, but Daphne was observant.
He couldn't stop himself. He watched the crowd move and breath around each other. How many would be dead at the hand of this war? In a year from now, in five years from now, how many would be killed? Would the crowds be less full? Would they continue, but with the deep weight of oppression from an enemy they didn't know they had? For now, Draco could only watch.
He reached out for her, taking her hand in his. "We don't have to do this," he whispered through the milling and chatter of the classroom. Pansy shook her head, her answer was clear. She had no other way.
Daphne stiffened beside him. The message was as clear to her as it was to him. Really, this was just a confirmation of their suspicions. Their betrothal ceremony would be over the winter break, in a little over a month.
Dolohov's hand was on Potter's collar. Potter thrashed against the hand at his throat, his eyelids fluttering from lack of air.
"What's it like to be so safe in your name?" she asked, tilting her head slightly, her eye makeup in shrieks down her cheeks. "What's it like to be so fucking unconcerned with other people's problems? Untouchable Draco Malfoy," she stocked towards him, Draco backed away slowly. "My father will hear about this," she mocked. "My Daddy is wealthy, powerful and he only hits my Mommy behind closed doors. My Daddy can make all my problems disappear with a wave of his wand. My Daddy spoils me until I'm a selfish little cunt who only cares about shoving others down so that they can lick the shit off of my shoes," Draco's back hit a wall. His words wouldn't work, he couldn't get away. Draco could feel Pansy's breath against his face, so was so close to him she only whispered.
"Let the man have a break, he did just beat the shit out of Finnigan. He should be rewarded," Crabbe piped up.
"My apologies Professor," Draco lied, "I should have come to you first. Please forgive me." Draco told them what they wanted to hear, he just wanted this to end. He would have rather dealt with Umbridge.
Goyal just stood there with his mouth open. Crabb attempted to contribute with, "Didn't they meet last year?"
Draco ran to Potter, stunning Death Eaters as they focused on Potter. Draco grabbed Potter's hand, yanking him out the doorway. Draco turned, Death Eaters swarming to the exit where they stood.
It was gone. The second he opened his eyes, he realized suddenly, the pain was no more. His adrenaline still ran in his veins. His heart still pounded in paranoia. There wasn't anything to run from, however. The pain had passed, he was fine.
His spine tightened as he walked out of the hall, how obvious were they being? Did anyone notice? Draco made his way to the lavatory, everyone else being at breakfast, so they could possibly talk in private. What did Potter want to talk about? To tell Draco that he was wrong, they shouldn't be friendly? Perhaps to tell Draco to just fuck off? Draco knew he disappointed Potter, but could he save this relationship?
The pair continued to level their gazes. Severus pulled his hand away from the doorway slowly, allowing Potter through. Draco hurried to follow, only to have a cold hand lay on his shoulder.
Greyback steadied him with a heavy gaze, sizing him for his words. Draco just continued to smoke. Greyback gave him a knowing smile as he seemed to have found whatever comradery he thought was in Draco. "How would you know, you probably haven't even been in a fist fight."
The walk to the Great Hall was a quiet one. Lights out was in an hour, most students had taken to their Common Rooms. Draco wasn't feeling patient, so he took a less travel routine, taking the west stairs up to the main hall. The west stairs were narrow with no paintings along the way. Few torches supplied little light. He paused whenever he heard a voice, a quiet, girl voice. Draco poked his head around the corner, Mafalda was sitting on the stairs, accompanied by a familiar orange cat.
The crowd hushed as a chill slipped down their spines. Draco's heart pounded in his chest. His rips burned with the force of swallowing his panic. He watched as a crowd parted for their Lord who was glowingly pale in his night black robes. His blood red eyes were proud as they glided over his followers, a human show of his pure power. Draco was sure that he was Death itself.
Daphne nodded, perhaps she could feel the blood pulsing through veins would soon be dripping onto the ground. Making the town red with something other than Valentine's Day decorations. Perhaps she could tell how he was twisting himself, peeling his own skin off, before the war had even started.
He could admit that he had…underestimated the trauma that he had experience. He could admit that he hadn't thought of every reaction he could have when with Potter. Even if Potter was the object of his affection, he was also the focal point of the Dark Lord's obsession.
"Yes," Draco rolled his eyes, "You've pointed that out, do you have anything useful to say, or are you going to continue to waste my time?"
Upon his way to the Owlery, two giggling Hufflepuff girls came rushing down the stairs. This wouldn't be unusual, however they looked particularly guilty at the sight of him and for the fact that one of their hair turned bright blue. Draco let the pair scurry down the steps as he further investigated. He hurried up the tower, only to be met with a boy whose hair turned from brown the blond right before his eyes after eating something.
Potter was sitting next to him in another desk, Draco didn't dare to look over at him. Potter probably hated him now, he was permitted special treatment while Potter had to watch his friends carve lines into their skin. Draco was almost positive that Potter was also given twice the amount of lines as the other Gryffindors. Plus, Potter and the Weasley twins were banned from Quidditch for life. Potter hated him. Ron definitely did, as he was kicking Draco's desk from behind.
"Your girlfriend just died and you're just acting like nothing happened," she pushed. Draco stilled, his anger a hot rod in his chest. He shoved passed her. She let him, but she was right on his heels. "Your girlfriend was just murdered and you're sitting here acting like nothing happened-"
Draco pushed down his hot anger, he couldn't afford the attention. He breathed through his temper, fighting back the hot spike in his stomach. He wanted to fight.
Draco closed his eyes at the thought. He didn’t have time for panic. He must have a clear mind. Clear waters unmuddied by vulnerability.
Draco continued his lines, bored as all fuck. His head hurt, his lip hurt, his ass hurt. He wondered if Potter was in any pain. His hand would hurt by now, was probably bleeding. Draco would have to make sure Potter properly applied the healing salve and wrapped the wound correctly, he always wraps the bandage too loose. Draco made sure no one tried to fight Potter whenever the Quidditch teams started to fight. However, Potter did tackle Montague, which earned him a bruise on the jaw. Merlin, Draco was destined to be a worried mother, wasn't he?
Potter took the seat next to him. Draco looked out the window. Potter's arm, his thigh, was touching his. His hands itched to touch, to feel something other than pain for this too brief ride back to Hogwarts. He clasped his hands in his lap instead. If Potter knew what these hands had done, he would recoil as Draco reached out to him.
Well, that was exactly what he wanted to hear, but he nodded in agreement. The young girl opened the large door and against his better judgement, he followed her in.
His Lord walked over the corpse in one large step, seeming not to mind the blood on the end of his cloak. He studied the pale girl, as if only now seeing her in death. Draco looked at Daphne's face for the last time. Crimson ribbons braided themselves into the halo of blood hair. Her eyes bright in their blue depths, but lacking without a soul behind them. Their Lord poked her cheek with his toe, gently pushing her face so that Daphne's dead eyes were looking right into Draco's.   "It's a shame… you two would have made a handsome couple," his Lord spoke to Draco for the first time tonight.
He corrected Theo's homework, who was barely paying attention. Eventually, he turned back to his own assignment.
Crabb fell into the table Granger and Potter had been hiding under. Granger scampered away as the table hit the floor.
The heavy scent of Umbridge's perfume had seeped into Draco's skin, he had a stench about him now. Pansy sat as far away from he as possible. Daphne just turned around and walked away from him. Theo pretended to gag anytime Draco stood too close to him. This went on all day, even though he was sure the smell had left.
Draco watched as his mother circled him. Her green dress dirtying from the floor, but she didn't seem to care.
The spell stopped. There was pain, then there was no pain, but Draco knew the cycle would start again. He laid in the dirt, long beyond caring about anything but the shedding in his bones.
"The date was a disaster, thanks a lot. Asshole," Potter greeted him whenever Draco walked into the Room of Requirement.
Him being close to Potter would only hurt him. A twisting knife hit his gut. He just held Potter's hand, enjoying the sensation for as long as he could.
Severus finished grading the paper in front of him. He folded his hands on the desk, finally looking up at Draco. "I wish to discuss your involvement with Harry Potter," he started.
The moment Potter reacted to the words Draco realized what his request sounded like, what he had to look like, with his hands gripping the sink behind him and his chest out. His demeanor could easily be taken as flirtatious…actually, if Potter did not mistake this for flirting he was just a clueless idiot who would never find love even if he had the strongest love potion possible forced upon him. Unfortunately, Potter was slightly more intuitive.
Draco swallowed, his throat dry. Someone was shaking him. Potter, both hands on his shoulders. "Draco, Draco. Can you hear me?"
He would try to be happy for Potter. Of course, Potter would be under the impression that he was nothing more than happy for his friend. He would have to coil his feelings inside of him to hide them, to shield Potter from them. Potter wasn't at fault for Draco's feelings, Draco would take responsibility.
"Draco," Pansy whispered next to him. He glanced at her. She was pale, her appearance hadn't improved from earlier today. Her hair was still un-brushed, her stink had only worsen has the day had continued. She had been crying, she didn't even bother to try and hide the fact. She was breaking.
Severus was next to her instantly, barking orders at terrified children. He was yelling. He was yelling at Draco, Draco realized.
Draco thought of Daphne. Alone. Scared. Standing before death himself before Draco sliced the life out of her. He had taken away her memories of what she was standing there for. Would she have stayed without those memories? Did Draco steal her life only to also chain her to this world?
Theo gently pulled at his sleeve before gently scooting down the bench. Draco picked up his plate, piled high with food to make up for Draco's lack of lunch. He followed Theo down the bench, leaving his bag as the yelling only got louder. Heads from all across the Great Hall turned towards the ruckus.
He didn't. Instead, he turned his back to Daphne. Forcing himself to face Potter, who wasn't looking at him, but wasn't talking either. Draco should look literally anywhere but Potter, but he couldn't. Draco followed Potter's glance, his stomach twisting in a way that Draco didn't want to dissect.
So… naturally Draco did nothing. Allowing Potter to blush and blunder through this awkward experience alone. “Um… sure. Does the, the um, Room of Requirement sound okay? Around midnight?” Potter blundered.
"So… Dobby," Draco changed the subject, putting his bag on the floor and walking away from Potter. He needed to distance himself.
Cold hands gripped Draco's shoulders tightly. "I have lost more than you will ever understand, you do best not to bite a helping hand."
He had even ground now. Spell after spell he sent to his assailants. He spent the summer training for battle, he was sure he could handle two students, but he wanted this to end. The moment he could, he broke into a run down the hall as he conjured snakes to deal with his assailants.
"Let us get you back to the manor. I'm sure it's past your bedtime," the Dark Lord turned down a path that led directly to the manor. Draco stumbled after him. Their conversation had felt so fast, yet Draco's feet ached with the long walk. Should he mention the Greengrass family? Was he in a place to sway his Lord's mind? He owned Daphne, he would protect Astoria, but how? "You're suddenly quiet," his Lord called out.
"She's not your responsibility, you know," Daphne hadn't even looked up to know where Draco's gaze was held.
Draco wouldn’t let himself look anywhere but his Lord's back. He couldn't handle seeing disappointment or pride on his parent's faces.
He didn't have any time to take out his wand as he was forcefully shot into the air. He almost touched the high ceiling of the halls before he started to plummet. His stomach dropped as gravity yanked him to the ground.
They lapped into comfortable conversation, huddled together in the cold. Draco exploded into tease whenever Potter tried to take a drag of his cigarette. His lungs weren't use to the heat, so he coughed violently behind laughter. He squinted his nose at the taste.
After Severus finished his lecture, the class paired up into groups of two to perform the potion. The class broke into their usual groups. Pansy stood to gather the ingredients from the storage closet while Draco began the light the fire underneath the cauldron.
"Yes, I'm…" Potter sighed, "I'm a mess." Pity stabbed Draco's heart. Of course Potter wanted control, there was so much out of his. Draco was only about to take more options away from him. Potter finished with his hand, but Draco didn't pull away.
"He'll meet you in the Owlery just before dinner, now go. Tell no one," he supplied, hoping this was enough to make Blaise leave. Blaise jerked away, shooting Draco a glare, but Draco had guessed correctly. He left without complaint, followed by Bulstrode.
"I was hoping to discuss what happened with you before any punishment is decided," Dumbledore explained.
They walked to lunch. Pansy didn't ask for more clarification, a mercy. Draco had to dodge Pansy's attempt at a healing spell, cupping his pulsing nose as he elbowed Pansy's wand away from his face. Healing spells required a certain softness that Draco was sure Pansy lacked.
Nothing made sense. He wasn't privy to the larger picture. No, he was only allowed to see threads, but never the tapestry. He wasn't told the 'whys' or even the 'hows', he just got what little gossip he was able to pull out from the adults that wouldn't take him seriously. Despite everything, the planning and seaming, the brutality and grit, the disciple and maturity he showed, he was still treated like a...child.
The constant clicking of clocks quieted as they entered the office. Rabastan's screams became almost distant.
"Your doom mates are certainly friendly," Montague called after him, "is that where you go every night?"
This would be the first thing Potter notices when he enters. Perhaps Draco should hide the box to allow for a reveal? Or was that too dramatic?
"Honestly Potter, how many friends do you have? Surely not enough to lose count," Draco mumbled lowly so only Potter could hear. Potter's eyes widened in recognition.
Draco felt as if he knew himself surprisingly well. He could almost always pinpoint the root of his feelings and pull them up like a weed to be disposed of. He knew that his constant need for validation is caused by his Father's constant disapproval and his Mother's cold nature. The pressure of being a Malfoy has caused a certain feeling of ownership over things that didn’t necessarily belong to him, that he tended to view himself as the automatic choice, even if he didn't have any claim to whatever he wanted at the time. He was also starved for genuine relationships, even if the idea of having to take personal responsibility for hurting someone else scared him. This caused him to keep everyone at a distance, keep his relationships superficial as possible. His parents approved of this distancing, which played into his need for approval and validation. This simply repeated the cycle of shitty feelings.
A hand on his bicep stopped him from leaving. Lupin stepped closer, his eyes kind. "My door is always open if you need anything. If you find yourself in a situation you can't get out of-"
The class continued as normal with Professor Sprout instructing the students to begin creating a diagram for their own planter boxes. Draco begins to work on his, sketching with a piece of charcoal on a piece of parchment, and the classroom grows increasingly quiet as the students around him follow suit. Draco allowed his mind to concentrate solely on the task at hand, the diagram began to take shape as Draco planed which plants should go where.
Draco held her as he explained, "Potter's Army gives our people an out, they can take a stand without being alone." The Slytherin students are most likely out of any house to become Death Eaters, to follow in there parent's footsteps. Draco couldn't change that, but Potter and his friends could provide shelter for those within the house that are being most abused.
“Do it for the girl, you can help her, you can do something about this,” Draco continued, “the girl needs help - help me help her,” Draco finished. If Zabini knew he was being manipulated, he didn't care, he was too numb, he allowed himself to be malleable to Draco's orders. Blaise nodded, turning away from Draco's touch, hurrying to the Great Hall to make excuses for Draco.
Potter moved his hand from Draco's face, a smile still on his face. "Are we okay?" Potter whispered, his face still close to Draco's.
A book appeared on the table. Draco opened the book hurriedly, not bothering to look at the title or subject. The book was over potions theory, but Draco could have sworn he read this over complicated text before. Upon inspection of the title, the novel was, in fact, the same textbook that he had been trying to understand for almost a month now. Stupid Room.
Theo was wide eyed, his mouth opened in shock. Blaise had his hand on Theo's arm, perhaps comforting him or holding him back. Draco sighed, Potter's interview was going to be more of an issue than he had originally thought. The abuse would only get worse if he continued to allow Finnigan to challenge him. He would have to fight, but if he did this right, he would only have to fight once.
A small girl in muggle clothing stepped forward and cast an impressive silencing charm around the mountain when the class couldn't keep their laughter to themselves so Theo could keep sleeping. A girl with brown hair and warm light brown skin, the same girl Draco had helped in the corridor.
This wasn't adding up. Why a family that wasn't directly connected to the Dark Lord? Why Daphne, who was so young? Surely there were other fertile women that were older?
Draco looked up from his textbook. Daphne pulled out the chair next to him. Draco had taken to studying at the small table in corner hidden by the stairs, the most privacy could be found here.
Dumbledore took the seat next to the bed as he left the lemon cake on Draco's tray. "Malfoy, I hope you can understand why we are concerned."
"This is no way a WE situation," Draco giggled. The classroom had erupted into laughter after Daphne's snark.
"If Potter took out his broomstick, you'd be the first on your knees," Pansy joked. Daphne laid her head down on the table, her shoulders shaking in joy at Draco's expense.
“But...,” Zabini sobbed. His shoulders were visibly shaking now, too much for the boy, he was gasping for breath in between harsh sobs that shook his entire frame.
Potter grinned, but the smile didn't reach his eyes. They sat on the couch, Draco started to care for Potter's hand, and his bruised face, and his shoulder 'because it's a little sore, if you can look at that'.
When Draco didn’t move Potter drew him into a hug. Draco allowed himself be held, but he couldn’t bring himself to wrap his arms around Potter. His hands almost touched the warmth of Potter's back, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t let himself give into comfort and touch Potter. Potter should only be handled with hands not stained in blood.
"No? Well perhaps Mrs. Parkinson? You did seem rather concern for her whenever she had her nasty accident."
Daphne didn't answer him, only gave him a smile that told him she had him right where she wanted. She nodded towards a shop, letting Draco lead her, as were her manners for a date.
'Hi Potter, so glad to see you. I very much want to kiss you, but I think it would be best if we never talked again because you will probably end up hating me,' seemed a little long winded and too complicated.
Draco stared straight ahead, willing to let Potter have the last word in his embarrassment, his face still hot. Potter elbowed him in the arm, motioning to the parchment.
He blinked, suddenly to aware of his own body. He licked the lip he had just been biting down on. Pulling his hand away from Potter's ankle where he had suddenly found it. "Sorry," he coughed, "you were saying?"
Draco's heart rose into his throat. The back of his eyes itched. This was the plan, he tried to calm himself. "Stabilizing?" he let his voice crack. Sometimes there was strength in the emotions that made you vulnerable.
Potter smiled back, his warm eyes looking into Draco's. Draco allowed the moment to extend between them, comfortable in the private company.
The Greengrass manor loomed over him, cursing him for daring to walk through her halls when he had just ripped a life from her walls. He could feel Daphne in every inch of her home when he took his place beside his family. No one mentioned or noticed his absence.
His father didn't answer quickly. Instead, he pinched his lips, his brow furrowed. "Can we sit?" he finally asked, rubbing his forehead.
He should end this. This wasn't going to end well for either of them. He should do the kind thing, the right thing, and stop seeing Potter.
Draco gave him his arm with ease. Potter was focused when he unbuttoned Draco's sleeve to expose skin. Draco turned his head to look out the window, smoke filed out into the moonlight. He had stared at the dark mark enough. The gentle night was quiet.
"Our daughter was a joy to all," Mrs. Greengrass spoke up. She looked so much like the dead. Her face was pale as if all the blood had been drained from her. Her face was calm as she turned to Draco. His heart ripped apart as he met her eyes. She had the same bright blue eyes that Draco once confided in. She wasn't going to let him forget why they were all here. "She was taken from us too soon."
Potter then grabbed Draco shoulder, he squeezed reassuringly. "Meet me tonight?" he asked, hand still on Draco's shoulder.
"Perhaps since you are looking forward to taking your time, you two and walk to the castle instead of taking the carriage," Severus threatened.
Draco blushed at Potter's smile, "We don't actually celebrate Christmas, most pure-bloods follow the old traditions, but sure. Happy Christmas, Potter."
He would always hurt Potter, Draco realized then. Maybe one day, if they both survived whatever the future held for them, Draco would be able to be someone Potter cares for without harming him.
He sat back down. Stood back up. Sat pack down. This was the danger in arriving early, Draco hated waiting. He laid down on the couch, a pillow appearing as he rested his head. Draco watched the fire swirl and burn.
"I mean, if you are devoted to him he will go through impossible lengths to help you," Sirius walked Draco through is thoughts.
Draco sighed, "Potter, really, you're making this a much bigger deal than it is. Montague has just decided that I'm an easy target, and he has pull with the Quidditch team, so they're probably going to pick his side, but I can handle them. I promise. Don't worry about me."
Draco didn't give him a chance to speak, turning back to Finnigan, but also glancing around quickly for any Professors. They were alone. "Excuse me?" Draco called out to Finnigan, who had begun to walk away. "What did you just call me?"
"Well, I'm glad you two are such good friends, maybe Cho does have something to be jealous about," he lashed out. He needed to change the topic of conversation. Somehow, Potter always manages to drag into light what Draco's keeping in his closet.
