Harry remembers that moment. Lining up outside the Great Hall, everyone looking at each other with a shared sense of awe. They could be Sorted into any house, achieve anything, grow up to be anyone. Their lives awaited them, an unwrapped present. Harry remembers how young Draco had looked then, his face still softened with childhood, robes still slightly too big for him, sleeves trailing. Regardless of how arrogant and pompous Harry considered him at the time, Draco still would have stood outside the doors of the Great Hall and dreamed of the future contained within. Maybe he dreamed of childish pranks, of popularity and admiring friends. Maybe he dreamed of becoming a Quidditch all-star, showing off carefully-practised moves on the latest broom model. Maybe he dreamed of academic achievement, impressing all his classmates and making his father proud.
Harry makes his way across the untouched snow of the pitch, leaving a trail of footprints behind him, and looks at the goalposts. They always look so small, he thinks, when he’s in the air flying. But here, standing at the foot of one of the posts, it looks enormous.
“I thought you'd left me.”
Before he leaves, Harry carves the coordinates for Landewednack into a fence post, hoping that if Draco returns to the spot he will be able to locate Harry. Still, it's a long and lingering departure. Harry keeps thinking, I'll wait just another minute. And then, when the minute passes without sign of Draco, he thinks just another minute. At long last he leaves. But even as he starts the engine and turns the indicator on, he's vainly hoping for Draco to reappear.
She seems to be waiting for affirmation, so Harry gives it. "We do, yes."
All they need is the time-turner.
"I know, but it's just...I don't know." Harry feels terrible. "I don't know," he repeats. "Anyone in their right mind would have told Narcissa and Astoria, and taken Draco to St Mungo's, and — "
* * *
* * *
Harry falls asleep somewhere between Algarkirk and Wyberton, just as they cross a river.
It's like the first journey, or the last one, or every one. All the little familiarities, stepping into his heart like old friends. City lights, going past each side of him, a blur, a long stream of everlasting brightness. But he doesn't need the lights. He doesn't need to see. He knows the way, he'll always know the way home.
They assign new fieldwork on Monday. The dark green folder drops onto Harry's desk with a thud. Ron's head pops over the cubicle divider.
Ron contemplates the remains of a roast potato, reaches for it, then changes his mind and settles back in his chair. “We’ve got some names in mind, anyway,” he says.
"So," she says, "you want to know about the Malfoys."
Harry gives Draco another suspicious look, although a certain nervous feeling is beginning to stir in his stomach. He goes to the area marked by the spell, glances at Draco, and then waits uncertainly.
They’re passing through some small village in Hampshire. There’s a playground nearby, the night dew gathering on the empty swings. Harry pulls into the parking lot next to it. He turns the engine off and waits. Draco is silent for a long time and Harry thinks he’s collecting his thoughts. Draco’s methodical like that. Everything has to be in its correct order.
"Yes."
tact,” Ginny says, frowning at Harry. “You
“No thanks.” Harry gazes into the flames of fire. It’s burned low in the grate and the flames are small, wavering gently over glowing coals. “Draco’s gone.”
"Do you know why he liked the silver snitch, Harry?" Narcissa asks. He half-wishes she called him the far more formal Mr Potter. He's not sure he's comfortable with any Malfoy calling him by his first name.
They arrive in a dizzying rush of magic, and Harry stumbles forwards into deep snow. He notices the darkness first — this is a place untouched by the lights of nearby cities. Above, the stars are so clear they seem to clutter the sky.
It takes the best part an hour to leave London, but soon they're speeding along the M2. Draco speaks only to give directions, and Harry follows them wordlessly. They follow the lines of the land, curving along the wide highways and then breaking away to the smaller roads, the narrow and winding arteries that span the countryside and converge briefly upon a small parish before, once again, dividing and unravelling. They drive alongside a river for a long time. Harry asks for its name.
"Does it take a lot of effort to stay here?" Harry asks, wondering if Draco will suddenly vanish again. "Are you going to leave again?"
"Ron said you've been staying late at the office a lot lately."
Draco opens his eyes, watching the darkness roll past. “It’s quiet. Bigger, somehow. Emptier. The mountains seem to eat the stars.” He closes his eyes again, leaning his head against the cool glass of the window. “It’s better with you.”
"No! Well — just a couple of glasses. Would you like something to drink? Oh, don't worry, I know how you like your alcohol. There's a bottle of oak-aged whiskey in the cellar."
"I will if I don't see you." He terminates the firecall.
Harry waits a long moment, concentrating on the feeling of the steering wheel beneath his hands. Something solid, something real. He exhales slowly.
“Gran said I was developing an unhealthy relationship with it and it was to stay at home.”
Draco's East Devon house, Harry realises with a sudden heartache. Narcissa sold it. And all the furniture had been sold as well. Draco's possessions — four tidy little boxes, sitting in the manor for years — were all that remained.
He pours himself a glass of Irish whiskey and stands on the balcony, looking over the London skyline. He remembers how Ginny's eyes had lit up, the city lights reflected in her pupils, when they first stood at this window and looked at the view.
“No?” he repeats at last, trying to hide the betrayal in his voice, but it comes through anyway.
Harry places his hands flat against the earth, if only to feel something solid beneath him, if only to feel earthed somehow.
The walls are lined with colourful pictures: bright crayon drawings sent in by families grateful for news of long-lost spouses and parents, and a framed picture of the Chudley Cannons on one wall (a joke gift from Ron). Harry, aware that many friends and family of missing people will sit in the office and look around it, has made a concerted effort to hide anything upsetting. Unlike the Auror offices — often with enlarged mugshots on the walls or mind-maps that track motives and suspects — Harry is far more discreet with his file information. It was one of the first thing Holdsworth taught him about being in the Investigative Division.
But a little voice of reason adds,
Harry eases off the accelerator slightly. The autumn rains are becoming more frequent and are leaving an icy chill over the land, like a warning of winter's frosts. They're in the final week of November, and London is already full of festivity: Christmas lights line Oxford Street, and Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland is filled with excited children and bundled-up tourists.
"Yes." Astoria sips her tea. "He said he wanted to see where the British mainland ended."
"Never wanted to. When you're a child...the world is as big as your bedroom, isn't it? The universe is a three-mile diameter around your childhood home. Knowing every river, every field, seems like an impossible task. Let alone conquering the counties beyond Wiltshire."
"Anywhere." Harry studies Draco. "You look tired."
It's odd to remember, Harry thinks, how he used to be infuriated by Draco's arrogance at Hogwarts. That sheer refusal to apologise, or admit wrong, or do anything vaguely resembling moral responsibility.
* * *
There was a faint pop. Somebody had Apparated onto the front porch.
"Oh, very funny! Hey — where are you going?" Harry asks as Draco drops his arms and turns, poised to flee.
It must have been lonely. And Harry knows that loneliness well.
“I'm worried about him,” Draco cut in urgently. “He's never left like this before, without a word or warning, and I'm worried about where he'll go — ”
"People judge you for it," Harry says slowly. Astoria glances away, staring down at her cup of tea.
Draco came back here. It may have been ten, twenty, fifty years ago, but Draco came back here and hid the clasp. Somewhere safe, but easy to access.
“I told her not to forget to water it once a month, and not to forget to tell it how good it’s looking. It has self esteem issues.” Neville shuffled a pack of cards, dropping a few. “So it should be alright.” He dropped a few more. He may have saved the world with Harry, but he still managed to trip on his robes every now and again, knock over an inkwell when he wasn’t concentrating.
"It's crowded," he observes at last, looking out over the sea of sunburned noses and pasty legs.
"Did you have any idea what he wanted to discuss with you?"
Harry is silent. The thin light of the moon does little to show Draco's expression; Harry looks away instead, tilting his head to listen to the rush of waves eddying around the base of the cliffs.
"Oh. I borrowed it." He picks it up and walks toward Harry, holding out the wand. When he's within reach, however, Harry ignores the wand and takes Draco by the wrist instead, pulling him a little closer.
"No, I just...I'm fine," Harry says, clenching his trembling hands around the atlas.
Harry miserably trails downstairs to eat breakfast.
friends. Astoria, tell him.”
"Harry Potter?" a woman asks, stepping into the waiting area. Harry likes the way Muggles say his name, in that blandly polite way. "We'll check your paperwork and take a brief eyesight test, then you'll be ready for the practical."
Harry visits his Investigative Division office before he leaves for the day. No, he thinks for a moment before wincing and shaking his head. No; not his office anymore.
Draco studies him. "I suppose we do have something in common, then," he says after a long moment.
Eleven o'clock. Five hours ago. Harry nods, at last, and slowly turns away from the witch.
“You must try harder,” they said.
He looks up. Draco stands there, holding out a hand. Harry pauses a moment, then accepts it. He stands and steps away from the car, following Draco.
Draco was right. The spell doesn't work when attempted to cast on self.
But there is nothing but darkness and silence, and for a moment he thinks he’s failed completely.
"I'm afraid we destroy records of sale after twelve months." The shopkeeper gives Harry a peculiar look and he realises his hair is slowly darkening to black again; he fumbles for the flask of polyjuice potion and takes another swig. The shopkeeper gives the flask a very suspicious look. "Are you drinking on the job?" he demands. "What's your name? I'll report you, you know."
Harry looks at the photograph. It's a simple portrait of Draco Malfoy. He's unsmiling, mouth turned slightly downwards as though he's contemplating something sorrowful. He's wearing slate-grey robes and a plain black cloak. Harry looks closer; sure enough, the clasp is a small silver snitch.
Time to visit the evidence vaults, then, and use the pensieve.
“I had a favourite uncle called Balbinus Aubrey Greengrass,” Astoria says. “Should I inflict his legacy upon an innocent child? No.”
Such a painful process. One heart at a time, held between tense fingertips.
“Hermione,” he says quietly, but she quickly shushes him with a dismissive hand.
He walked forwards and then he saw him sitting in Snape’s old chair. Slughorn’s, now.
. Sophie giggles as Harry sweeps her off her feet and dances around the room with her. Matthew and Astoria laugh helplessly as they absolutely butcher a foxtrot. Draco watches over the proceedings like royalty holding court, Hermione by his side and chatting about the latest Ministry news.
* * *
Her brow creases, if only for a moment. Then she glances at the file and remembers. "Oh, Harry," she says, looking exasperated. "They didn't assign you
“The longer they’ve been dead, the less accurate the spells are. I can’t give you anything better than that.”
If Harry went missing, who would comb through the possessions of his life, and what would they think? He has nothing in this apartment. Most of his possessions are kept in his Gringotts vault.
“If nobody tells me what a Niffler is, I’ll pour custard into the fireplace and ruin your stupid Floo thing,” Matthew says.
“Get that look off it,” Draco repeats stubbornly. He takes a sip of his coffee and mutters, “Stupid git.”
Then he slowly turns and walks across the field. The wheat rolls away in every direction, an ocean of gold. In the distance, there’s a thin black road cutting across the land like a scar, a Renault Mégane parked along it.
...and start again, every day the same, and he can’t take it anymore. This emptiness, this ceaseless routine, it’s like singing the same song over and over, it’s like drawing lines on maps for journeys he’ll never take, it’s like running on air. He needs to run, run,
be professional, you know," Harry says defensively, and Ron shrugs.
"Yeah, and it'll be worse when you get in an accident because you spent fifteen minutes carefully hunting for the indicator switch."
"Does it start up now?" Harry asks, looking over the car, and the mechanic grins.
Not five minutes arriving in the apartment, he receives a firecall from Butterworth. Unusual, as his colleagues know only to use personal firecalls in urgent situations.
Harry nods and pays. Ron pulls a face.
He'd fetched it from Gringotts on Tuesday afternoon, when Draco had still been sleeping and Harry hadn't started worrying yet. The wand had sat forgotten for years; Harry had meant to return it to Draco after the war, planning to owl it off and spare the awkwardness of meeting in-person, but he'd simply forgotten. Too busy with other things, and the wand had ended up packed away in his crates of possessions at Gringotts after he and Ginny purchased the apartment. He'd never bothered retrieving the crates and unpacking. It took him quite some time to find the wand, and he wished he'd at least organised the crates in some way, or labelled them. The wand was amongst a jumble of other things: stacks of old
Harry bolts upright. “You are
"I'll make up the bed in the guest room," Harry offers, wondering if he's mistaken and Draco's planning to leave, but Draco just nods and Harry disappears into the guest room and takes a stack of clean linen from the dresser. The room is quite small, with a single bed and a matching bedside table. The dresser is currently in use as linen closet of sorts, and one of the drawers is crammed full of old Quidditch gear that Ginny clearly forgot. Still, Harry doesn't think Draco will complain.
"This is terrifying. You're going to kill me."
"Thanks a lot," Ron says, looking exasperated. "I behave like a decent human being and you interrogate my motives. Real nice, that is."
“They should get married or something,” Harry adds, much to Matthew’s amusement.
Draco asks Harry to take over the driving.
But Draco doesn't come back.
chasing
He wasn't wearing a ring. A wedding ring. It wasn't there.
"All those other times when you were going through my memories and possessions."
Draco's frown deepens. Harry, guessing at his concerns, adds, "I won't mention you at all." He shoves the letter toward Draco; he's kept it short and succinct, telling Hermione and Ron that he felt like a short break, he's gone away for a short trip, he's completely fine, and he looks forward to seeing them again soon.
"You're getting rather defensive," Ron says, and Harry narrows his eyes. Ron grins. "All right," he says, "I'll stop winding you up. Got to go. See you at the Mad Alchemist later?"
"Remember when we caught Lucius Malfoy? Everyone wanted to be the one to track down the last Death Eater, but in the end, it all came down to an anonymous tip."
“I got McGonagall’s permission,” Draco says. “No need to worry about the wards.”
Harry Disapparates with a pop.
Ron and Hermione exchange an expression and say nothing.
He knocks on the bedroom door at six, then again at eight, thinking Draco might want a meal. When there's still no reply, he begins to worry.
Of course, there would no doubt be far more outrageous reports if anyone found out he'd gone missing suddenly.
“That’s what the detectives are for,” Harry had argued, and his supervisors had all swapped expressions before saying that a Head Auror — just for example — needed to have a mind carefully honed to the subtle intricacies of each case. People skills, they agreed, was what a Head Auror needed. Not just raw strength and skilled magic.
He takes the file from his desk drawer and opens it up to the first page.
Harry narrows his eyes. He spots the upcoming exit for Birmingham and watches it like a hawk until they pass it by.
"I do read, you know."
“I’ve been reading since four. Budge up, Ron.” She squeezed next to him.
Harry stares down at his glass of rum, then takes a long drink of it. The waiter appears beside the table and Harry is almost relieved to see him.
"Narcissa was very pleased with my marriage to Draco. She dearly wanted a grandchild. And she liked me. My family is wealthy, of good status and pureblood, but sufficiently distanced from Voldemort. We never got involved with that sort."
"No, I was just viewing some memories," Harry says, turning and locking the cabinet. Ron looks at him with sudden interest.
, she had breathed. She always had the ambition and drive to own a place like this. Strong lines, clean forms and bold features. She'd been enchanted with London since she was a little girl, accompanying her father on trips to the Ministry and loving the rush of the city.
Draco wanted summer again.
“Space and time are always unstable when it comes to magic,” Hermione says, drinking her third cup of tea. “Space, yes — that’s why they advise avoiding Disapparating over large distances — but especially time. It’s dangerously unstable. And it works on similar principles to space — travelling over large eras of time is very dangerous.”
* * *
“You could say that,” he admitted. It wasn’t hard to see why; Neville had grown a lot since the clumsy boy who had first stumbled nervously into Hogwarts.
“Aren’t you supposed to be meeting Hermione in the library?” Ron looked at him curiously, clutching several textbooks.
The easy thing about being an Auror, Harry thinks, is that if he looks at a picture and doesn’t see what he wants, he changes the picture. He can start new surveillance, or interrogate a different suspect, or use other informants.
"What, so I should just throw away seven years of training?"
"And yet here I am." She speaks politely, evenly, without a trace of coldness or resentment in her voice, and Harry is hit by the similarity between her tone and that of Draco in the owlery. Both of them have had something struck from their voices since the war, Harry thinks. That polite deference that seems heavy as silence, blank as white walls, like one person in an empty room.
"You're good at investigating, too," Hermione retorts, frowning. "You've solved ten cases in eighteen months!"
"Car yours, is it? Can tell by the look on your face." He nods towards the car. "Go on, then."
They stop in Truro to refuel. Harry suggests an overnight stay. If his guess is correct, they're heading to Landewednack. By the time they arrive in that tiny parish, everything will be closed and they'll have to sleep in the car or remain awake all night.
Somebody was gently tugging the measuring spoon from his hand.
There's a faint click of a handle and, across the room, the door swings open. Harry fumbles quickly.
Ron stands up abruptly and starts pacing. "I don't like the sound of this. Malfoy's playing mind games with Harry?"
...this strange thing between them. Disconnected memories, thoughts racing through a Legilimens spell, driving lessons and a Renault Mégane, a long-forgotten letter written in the back of a calendar diary, stars in a winter sky as the Celtic Sea stormed ophiolite cliffs.
* * *
"Wrong about what?" Draco rests both hands on the steering wheel, gazing at the road on the other side of the crossing.
Harry groans. "I
“Oh, thank Merlin.”
Malfoy had an eagle owl during Hogwarts, Harry recalls. Strange for him to say he’s not fond of them.
When the rain comes low over the fields, misting them grey, Draco and Harry always go for a walk.
* * *
She leaves.
"Oh, come on," Harry protests. "We've been engaged for three years now, and dating for seven!"
"This was his room?"
"All right."
* * *
He wonders if he spoke the truth too directly, but Ginny doesn't seem offended. She tilts her head, thinking.
"Mm," Harry says distractedly, turning the page.
"Wait," Harry says, and Draco pauses. Harry reaches into his pocket and throws the wand to Draco; he catches it deftly, staring at it. "There you go," Harry says, trying to make his voice sound light and casual. "Couldn't give you a time-turner, but I gave you back your wand."
"Wiltshire." He points. "This is where I used to play, as a child."
— young and smiling again. Lucius will always be the strongest person in the world, and Narcissa the most beautiful, and their family is perfect —
Harry grins.“Nothing wrong with spending time with a very good friend.”
There's nothing particularly interesting about Malfoy's hand, he thinks. He glances back up again, but Malfoy's already looking at something else; another owl.
"It's a nice view," Draco continues, as if he hadn't spoken moments before. "But this isn't you, is it, Potter? This is nothing. A concrete box in the sky." He leans so close to the glass, Harry can see his breath mist over it. "You need something grounded. Something real."
He couldn’t look at Harry.
No. It's not.
Harry sat on the edge of the Gryffindor table and Draco on the edge of the Slytherin one, a small stretch of cold stone and darkness between them.
"Oh, really?" Ron says. "Holdsworth's going to be madder than a brooding dragon if you leave without a word. Suppose I'll just go and make some excuses, sort it all out for you, then?"
"Watch your speed," Matthew says.
“Tell me about the roses, Draco,” he said. “The roses. Train tracks. Do you remember the train tracks? The train,” he said. “The train tracks, Draco, oh Merlin — ” And then he'd buried his head in his hands. After a while, Draco had tentatively taken one of Harry's hands.
"I'd like that."
"Did you? Brilliant." Ginny grabs her bag. "Ticket on the table if you can make it to the game. Love you." Then she reaches for the portkey on the bed — an empty Jammie Dodgers packet — and whirls away in the blink of an eye.
Later, they push the table back and play the worst records Matthew manages to find in Astoria’s notoriously terrible collection. They begin with
That night, Harry dreams.
"Tomorrow," Harry echoes, opening the door and stepping inside. He closes the door behind himself and looks across the dark, empty room.
Harry is sure Draco’s setting up an elaborate joke, most likely beginning with the fact that Harry knows the coordinates by heart. He stubbornly refuses to fall into that trap. “Erm, let’s see...I’m not quite sure...”
"I've got something to tell you," she says to Harry.
"I know lots of things about you." Draco grins and Harry's heart seems to stutter for a second. It's an...interesting angle, he thinks — him standing by the bed, Draco lying across it grinning up at him — and he's caught between disappointment and relief when Draco sits up and reaches for the book, setting it onto the bedside table.
Within seconds of pouring the memory into the assigned pensieve, Harry disappears into its depths. A room constructs itself lightning-quick around him, the memory quickly taking form. Half-height walnut panelling, a rich leather chaise, solemn-faced portraits in gilded frames, a marble fireplace — a room in Malfoy Manor, Harry would wager.
"I've only been driving for a couple of months," Harry says doubtfully.
* * *
But Draco was already fleeing.
And he knows it was the perfect thing to say, because Draco's mouth twitches and he almost,
Although he writes an owl on Tuesday, he doesn't get a response until Thursday, when Narcissa Malfoy sends an owl. It's short and succinct: she will receive him at the manor, two o'clock sharp on Friday. Harry can't help but feel slight resentment that Narcissa feels perfectly welcome to turn up at his apartment at any time, but he's expected to practically make appointments to visit her.
Of course, once Harry's returned from his own shower, the window is open again. Draco is already asleep, apparently, despite the noise of drunken singing drifting from the neighbouring room and the lamp on Harry's bedside table casting a glow over the room. For some reason, Harry had always imagined Draco to be a light sleeper.
spouse is a bad influence on
"Truro," Harry says suddenly. Draco turns away from him again, gazing into the dark waves of the Celtic Sea.
"It can't be all of it."
Narcissa. His friends know not to owl him at home — the owls constantly arriving and departing would no doubt confuse or bother his Muggle neighbours.
Draco wanted to say.
"I don't know. I haven't read it yet."
Harry laughed. The noise jolted the Hufflepuffs awake. One of them half-heartedly ate a spoonful of porridge, the others adjusting their textbooks to make better pillows. Draco was silent. As they ate and chattered however, the Hufflepuffs managed to rise and finish their breakfast. As they left, more students began to drift in until the Hall was roughly a quarter full.
The motorway goes on and on. Harry watches the cars go by, thinking of all the other people going places. Going away, coming home. Always leaving.
Harry wishes he could fix the car himself. It seems important, somehow, that he's the one to fix it all. But when he started going through the list with Matthew, it became apparent that the car needed a lot more than a new battery. Brakes, calipers, disks, cylinders, pads, steering joints and track rods...everything would need to be checked and possibly replaced, depending on how well Draco had kept his car and how it had been treated after his disappearance. Then the petrol would need to be properly drained, the engine would need to be flushed...
The Shadow would come for them again.
* * *
Harry frowns. "What?"
The letter fell out. Harry must have shoved it back in his bag somehow.
He'll need to visit Narcissa Malfoy, however.
Ginny looks away. "I thought we could," she says, "until the morning after, when I left for Quidditch practice. We'd just broken up, and I still got up and went to practice. And I realised that it's because to me, practice is more important than trying to fix this. My career is my first priority." She looks up at him, and it feels like they're being honest with each other for the first time in ages, and Harry's suddenly so sick of wearing masks and reciting from scripts someone else wrote, and so he speaks the truth, the thought that he's kept hidden for so long during the last year of their relationship.
Would the car start if he tried it?
Draco considers that. "I don't have any plans," he says.
When they arrived at the Hall they sat down and Ron was silent. Harry knew he was listening for it too, that timid shaking. It sounded like a death rattle.
They arrive at the apartment at nine o'clock. Harry realises he hasn't eaten all day and neither has Draco; Harry's loathe to pester Draco about his lack of appetite but nevertheless sets about making a pot of tea and an enormous stack of toast, too tired to bother with a proper meal. Draco seems in agreement; he eats the toast without comment and disappears into the guest bedroom without another word. No doubt in need of a very long sleep, Harry thinks. Draco started the day easily enough, but it was obvious that he tired throughout the day and, by nightfall, he was clearly exhausted.
“So all I have to do,” he says quietly, “is find the time-turner?”
Strange, that Draco would write such thoughts in his textbooks. But, Harry realises, who else could he have confided in? Towards the end of their time at Hogwarts, it became clear Draco didn't trust even his closest friends. And certainly, he couldn't confide in his parents, both of whom were equally troubled as him.
“Yeah, they’re good, hey? Some quiet before the day starts.” Ron paused. “Malfoy’s always there though. Bit of a downside,” he joked.
"And perhaps a quote, carved into the frame? You'll have to give it some careful thought. Your father selected a Seneca quote about power, if I recall correctly. Perhaps you'll choose something similar?"
"That's the whole point, Molly said what better time than your seven year anniversary? Seven is considered a
"This portrait was painted the day before I left for Hogwarts."
Murderer.
* * *
But then, Malfoy said he never wore the wedding ring, and what was
“Well — a forced disappearance, of course —”
Harry sighs.
Draco looks over his shoulder and smiles; Harry takes another tentative step forward, so they're standing beside each other, and in that moment he realises the stars above are merely mirrored in the still waters of a vast lake. Mountains rise each side of the lake, like cresting waves, and even now — in the height of summer — he can see the pale glow of snow on the uppermost peaks. For a moment, Harry thinks he's standing on the edge of the world. That crisp, clear darkness that rolls on forever until sky and land become one; the forests, the valleys, the thin crescent moon that seems to balance on his heart.
Hermione starts. "What? You saw him?"
"You're on the second floor, on the eastern side," she says cheerfully. "Breakfast is served from seven to nine, and we have maps and brochures available for your perusal. Enjoy your stay."
"I have quite the memory, Mr Potter."
"I read a brochure yesterday."
"Do you have records?"
"Only I will see it," Harry promises.
"Oh, honestly." Hermione sighs. "You'd think they'd have a bit more sense. Well, if you ask Holdsworth for a file transfer, I'm sure — "
On Sunday morning, when Harry wakes, he reaches for his glasses and then his wand. His glasses are exactly where he left them; his wand isn't.
"Alive."
“Narcissa,” Harry says, and Astoria starts and turns to Narcissa.
, a butterbeer next to his elbow. He spares a glance at Harry.
"Yes, that wasn't really a good save, Ron," Harry mutters.
The pale blue colour of the folder denotes it as a cold case, but that could mean anything from two years ago to a 1920s relic. He turns past the index and onto the first page, where detectives first on the case would have summarised the facts.
But if his future wasn't what he dreamed it to be, no doubt countless others felt the same. Seamus Finnigan had clearly imagined a future that, for example, did not include both parents dying during the war. Justin Finch-Fletchley too, spending his final year of education on the run, hiding from Snatchers, his mother tortured to reveal the location of the rest of the family. Or even Millicent Bulstrode, whom Harry heard suffered terrible injuries during the Battle of Hogwarts and ended up in a permanently catatonic state, her life reduced to palliative care. None of these students, when they were eleven years old and first stepped into the Great Hall, alive with nervous excitement and the sheer thrill of it all, would have imagined these futures for themselves.
Harry stares unseeingly at the possessions before him. After a long moment, he reaches for the bottle of aged whiskey. No doubt Draco had been saving it for a special occasion.
They were out by the lake. Harry liked being with them. Hermione and Ron understood. He knew that in her dreams, Hermione screamed as Bellatrix raised her wand once more. And when Ron’s eyes glazed over with the Shadow darkening them, Harry knew he was remembering dueling for his life over the body of his lifeless brother. They understood. When he wanted quiet, when he wanted alone, they wanted it too. When he wanted to remember, so did they. They knew him. Evenings were reserved for them alone but tonight Harry was particularly moody, a darkness that made him silent and unresponsive. Hermione and Ron prescribed him a walk, unaccompanied, by the lake, where he could brew and brood through memories alone.
he’d said, and then Narcissa had murmured something about Lucius that Draco couldn’t quite catch, and then she’d told him to leave the room.
"Obliviate?"
"Well, don't tell her then," Harry says, arriving at his door.
She inclines her head slightly, towards the drawing room. Harry wonders if the motion is conscious or not.
The sun is setting against the dark winter sky when Harry returns to the stables to check progress. The mechanics seem slightly peeved but cheer up considerably when Harry — following advised protocol from Matthew — pays them generously, hands over a case of beer, and wishes them merry Christmas.
, Potter! Are you seriously playing games — "
"He went back to the manor." Astoria's quiet again for another moment. "Merlin, it was awful. Narcissa and I had the biggest row. We wouldn't have argued, normally, but I suppose emotions were running high. I'd promised myself I'd be calm, but I couldn't help but feel angry. I know, it's terrible, but honestly. Three years, and
don’t like it? He was
As the last of the sunlight dies across the land and night slowly settles in, Harry wonders if they'll travel beside a river. He wants to see those stars reflected, falling around him as he drives on into the darkness.
Draco won't say anything, Harry thinks, glancing at him. Always compartmentalising, always in perfect control...the only time he ever let Harry inside his head and heart was when he thought he'd be stuck in the past forever. Harry will need to choose his words carefully, or he has the feeling this moment between them could shatter like glass and send Draco away forever.
“Yes, excellent choice.”
“Yeah, I expect so. The —
"Or at all," Ron says helpfully, and Harry gives him a look.
"Close the door," Ginny says. "It's freezing out there."
— no, he’s master of the house now, so he has to be the perfect son now, and he can’t run away, he has to set all the finances in order and make sure Narcissa doesn’t fade away to nothing and takes care of herself properly, and he has to make sure everything is perfect, he’ll marry someone and they’ll have a house and respectable lives and everything will be perfect —
Six years ago, he stood here and found a silver snitch clasp. Now, he finds the same clasp – but it’s been amended. Now, the silver snitch is set into a simple ring.
Harry looks away, embarrassed that he only involved his friends when it got to this point. "He said he was tired. He's been tired a lot, since he came back Friday night, but he's slept for nearly twenty-four hours straight, now. And he's got a fever."
"You've picked it up quite quickly, though. The only thing that really needs work is your parallel parking. And sometimes your three-point turns become five-point turns." Matthew laughs.
Harry sits on the edge of the bed and listens to the silence. It seems amplified by the white walls, the endless expanse of glossy floorboards, the kitchen in which they never cook.
Draco didn’t see him all day. He wasn’t in Charms. His seat in Defence remained vacant.
But running beneath the torrent of anger at Zeisel is the anger at himself.
"Right."
"Thanks," she says. "Practice ran overtime. The scout left after Saturday's game without a word, which was a little disappointing. Maybe next match, though. Pearson's been scouted before — oh, thank you," Ginny says as a waiter places her glass of wine on the table. Harry accepts his glass with a nod and takes an appreciative sip. "Anyway, the wind conditions weren't too good on Saturday's match, and... "
His fingers grasp at nothing. Draco fades completely.
It never ceases to amaze Harry that people thank him. He spends months interviewing them, asking them to relive painful or difficult memories, sitting and listening to them recall the little habits and hobbies of their loved one. And then he'll find a skeleton in a field, or a suicide note, and have to tell them. And, Merlin help them, they
"So," Harry says carefully, "Draco disappeared half an hour before his appointment with the solicitor, who would have told him that there would be no legal consequences for him if he turned Lucius over to the authorities."
“I don’t like
"Brighton in December, eh? Sounds awful," Ron laughs.
Harry tries to distract himself with his other cases. Two weeks after Draco woke and returned to the manor, Harry closes his ninth case, the Staffordshire witch. In just a few more weeks, his time with the Investigative Division will end.
The Wandsworth Warriors win the Margate match.
"How about Thursday?"
“Yes,” said Draco, and his hands were still.
"Where're the eagle owls?" Harry demands.
Harry doesn't respond. He accepts the plastic keycard from Narcissa and the car unlocks itself. Muggle technology is amazing, Harry thinks. 'Waste of money', indeed. No doubt Draco considered it one of his finest investments.
“We didn’t even do any practice, just read all about the potion and its properties!” complained Ron bitterly.
“He felt it more then any of us,” Ron began, but Hermione cut across him.
Malfoy moves at last, touching a hand absently to the silver clasp on his cloak, before his hand falls to his side again and he resumes gazing at nothing.
"Where are we going?" he murmurs, voice still raspy with sleep. Draco glances at him.
“There's darkness inside my head,” he said. “So there should be darkness outside.”
"Anything else?" Harry repeats, smiling. Draco gives him an annoyed look.
"Well, we can share our news Friday night," she says, smiling. "I've made reservations at a new restaurant, just opened up in Diagon Alley."
Harry groans and sets his cup of tea aside, burying his head in his hands. "It's not about that, either! It's not about obligation or a sense of duty."
"Still got the contact details of that Norfolk bloke," Ron says.
apartments. But if I make the English National Team, who knows? At our next game, it might be — oh, I'm talking about work again." She laughs.
— and Hermione will be there too, looking sympathetic.
It's strange seeing how Draco's handwriting changes over the years. The carefully rounded letters soon give way to a lopsided look and, towards sixth year, the writing develops into a strong and graceful script.
Two minutes later, there was a dull thump.
"The Auror division has certainly been downsized, now that the war is over. However, that doesn't mean your work is any less important," Williamson says firmly. Harry could almost smile, if he wasn't so bitter about it.
For a moment, silence eclipses them. Then Harry speaks, his voice laced with defeat.
He goes home instead.
Draco falls silent.
Harry says his farewells to Astoria and Matthew, flooing to the apartment. Ginny's put a small Christmas tree — no bigger than an owl — on the end of the kitchen counter. Harry stares at it for a moment, remembering the lush pine needles buried beneath the snow drifts of Godric's Hollow. The cheerful pub, decorated with lights, and the distant sound of carols being sung. He could have grown up there. Built snowmen as a child, and when he was older he could've had his first drink in that pub.
, after all."
"Watch out for that car in front of us, if they go any slower you'll hit them," Astoria says, still sounding thoroughly unnerved. Malfoy's eyes flick up to the rear-vision mirror and for a moment, his eyes seem to meet Harry's. Then he switches the indicator on and overtakes the car, his eyes back on the road. "I don't think anyone I know has a Muggle driving licence," Astoria continues. "And now I understand why." She laughs, but Malfoy doesn't. He glances at the rear-vision mirror again, and once more he seems to be looking at Harry.
Or maybe he wishes it was three o'clock in the morning, and if he looks to his left he'll see Draco there.
Harry looks at him, at the sun illuminating his outline, the angle of his jaw, the tilt of his chin, the way the sunlight casts ever-so-faint shadows of his eyelashes over his cheekbones.
Harry was the one to go to Professor Slughorn.
Just him lying on the ground with pieces of his life around him.
“I gave you mine,” Slughorn said. “It’s alright. Just make sure it does not happen again, Mr Malfoy, or I’ll have to fail you.”
“Excuse me,” Draco said. “That’s mine, and it’s private.”
Three long years.
"Mrs Malfoy."
"The furniture was sold with the house." Narcissa hesitates. "There's a set of stables on the manor grounds, when there used to be horses and carriages kept here. The stables were converted to a storage area for the gardener's equipment. Draco's car is kept there too."
"Is that what you told Draco?" Harry asks, wasting no time in going over to the Renault Mégane and pulling the cover away. It feels like greeting an old friend. He smiles faintly and runs a hand across the polished metal.
Harry glances up. "You remember...?"
— takes a minute to notice Harry's return.
“I can’t help it if
"You didn't bring me tea," Draco observes, snapping Harry from his reverie.
"No, actually. Draco had an appointment with you the day he disappeared. September ninth, 2003, at 4:30pm." Harry speaks without preamble. Zeisel doesn't strike him as the sort of person to indulge in light chit-chat.
"What did you find?" Butterworth says, handing Harry the book.
"Yes?" Harry says it uncertainly, bewildered.
He pauses a moment, then gets into the car and shuts the door. It feels strange, sitting in the driver's seat of Draco Malfoy's car. He glances into the rear-vision mirror, half-expecting to see a ghost of himself sitting in the back seat.
When they enter the castle grounds, Hagrid pauses to consult the scrap of parchment Harry's given him, the coordinates scrawled untidily across it. Harry doesn't pause, however. He turns and begins walking to the Quidditch pitch.
"It's all right," Harry repeats.
Harry pauses a moment, listening to the whistling in the streets below, then steps inside and snaps the door shut.
Narcissa shakes her head. "I don't know why he kept the textbooks, but he sold or discarded everything else from Hogwarts."
"Do you have a memory you want to give me?" he asks quietly, careful to sound calm.
"Yes, well, no doubt Muggles would be equally horrified to learn that we ingest insect parts."
"How may I help you?"
It makes Harry feel guilty again. Draco — judging by the letters written in the back of the calendar diary — had never forgotten his original wand and had agonised over the obstacle of asking for its return. But for Harry, the wand hadn't even deserved a second thought. He'd made vague plans to return it, but had been too busy with stupid things, smiling and busy with his friends, his life, and he'd thrown it into a box of other forgotten items and left it to gather dust in a Gringotts vault.
“Even Severus hated his own name.” Draco takes a sip of wine. “Who calls their beloved child
“Well…it’s such a fantastic potion, I wouldn’t mind getting stuck into it right away,” Hermione admitted and Ron raised his hands in victory.
“Here’s the bit where your filthy rich ex-husband thanks us for the dinner we just made for him,” Matthew says, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Are you
“You left people behind, Draco. God, do you ever think about other people? Your wife, Astoria — and your mother, she never stopped searching — damn it! Damn
“Look at what I have to deal with, Draco,” Astoria says with exasperation, waving vaguely in Matthew’s direction. “
, Harry thinks, but he must have spoken the words aloud; Draco looks at him for a long moment before glancing down at the counter, his fingers still tracing meaningless patterns upon its surface.
"Your apartment," Draco says.
"Yes."
The slam of the car door echoes once. He steps forward, making his way along the little meandering path. Past the wildflowers, escaping their beds; past the jasmine plants, glowing white beneath the moon. To the front door, painted dark green, the same colour as the ivy creeping around the sandstone walls.
Maybe nobody's living here at all.
* * *
"Ask me a question, then." Ron pauses. "Or maybe I should be asking you a question." He points the toffee wrapper at Harry. "You and Malfoy. You've got this weird thing going on."
"They already investigated. It was three years ago." Astoria's anxiety is fading to confusion.
to be invincible — and it makes him feel sick to his stomach, it makes him terrified —
"That a mother's love brought about the first downfall of the Dark Lord, and a mother's love ensured his defeat again seventeen years later."
Draco Malfoy had heard all sorts of stories about rain and how romantic it was. The dramatic rain, the sweet smell of wet earth, the tumultuous clouds; but he decided it was the opposite for the single person. He slipped and sloshed through the muddied ground, skidding down a slightly embankment and nearly landing on a surprised Harry.
Harry sits on the edge of Draco's bed. It's a sentence he's trying to avoid thinking about.
He takes his leave then. He'll visit again, and bring up her previous marriage then. Speaking of it now won't get him anywhere, he senses; Astoria has withdrawn from her initial welcome.
He looks so tired, Harry thinks, studying Draco, and then he realises that if Draco's not planning on contacting his mother or ex-wife yet, he's probably planning on staying the night here.
When the last song plays and the record needle rises and stays still, it’s the unspoken end to the evening. Draco and Harry draw apart again. Hermione and Ginny stand up and leave the cosy fireside. Ron puts the last dish away. They converge in the kitchen to say their farewells.
"Fine." Harry tries to smile. "Where's Ron?"
"I know what it is," Harry says, rolling his eyes. "It's just...why have
“I’ll perform the spells, then we’ll be out of your way,” he says tersely. The woman waits, hand hovering impatiently over the shutter release button.
"Oh," she says. "Hullo, Harry."
at the office lately, and you just misheard me."
"What petition?" Harry asks, confused, and Astoria looks at him as if he's just asked which direction the sun comes up.
“So did I.”
Because sometimes, that feels like his intentions. He wanted to hide Draco, just have a moment — maybe a bit longer. Just him and Draco. Driving and speaking about nothing important and falling asleep in the English midlands. Stars and rivers and fields, and if he closes his eyes he can remember the sun-warmed stone of the sea defence wall, solid and real beneath his skin. The breakers rolling in, quiet and constant. The dunes of the beach subsiding into long, smooth plains.
Harry gives her a wry smile and steps into the room, setting the file down on the kitchen table. He may as well get to the point, he thinks. They know each other too well to spend time dancing about a topic.
He takes a deep breath. If he crashes Draco's car, Narcissa would never forgive him. Harry wouldn't forgive himself either. So he carefully adjusts the seat — Draco's just a little taller than him, it seems — and adjusts all the mirrors. He puts the seatbelt on, acutely aware that he's doing the same movements Draco has done hundreds of times before. He releases the handbrake, shifts the gear into drive, and lightly presses the accelerator.
Coming home is easy.
"Like a circle," Harry murmurs. Draco looks at him again.
"You look thoughtful," Astoria observes suddenly. Harry looks up and tries to smile.
* * *
“No, but it will stop you wondering.”
"Of course. That's what people do, isn't it? They judge. My parents adored Draco. If it were up to my mother, I'd be a widow forever, trailing about the place dressed in mournful black. She thought it was awful of me to remarry." She taps a fingernail against the rim of the mug. "I was very close to Draco, of course, and when he first went missing I was a mess." That matches the case officer's description of his interview with her, Harry thinks. "But we learn to pick up the pieces and move on, don't we?"
Harry studies Narcissa for a moment. "You didn't approve of it."
"You're taking the direct route," Harry says somewhere around midnight as Draco drives through Launceston. "I thought you liked the scenic routes."
"The River Medway," Draco says, one hand resting lightly on the atlas. "It joins with the Thames and, eventually, the North Sea."
* * *
The high summer sun has long set, it seems. He's standing on the crumbling stone steps of a small chapel. There's a brisk wind stirring dead leaves along the gravestones. Overhead, the sky is bruised with unshed rain. Someone is standing at a grave, setting a small handful of wilting bluebells upon it, but Harry doesn't recognise them.
“Draco,” she said reluctantly. “It's about Harry.” The way she said it made Draco suddenly rethink his assessment of her. There was a coolness in her voice, a distant look in her eyes. Perhaps he had interrupted something. Perhaps he wasn't welcome as he thought.
"You think me and Ginny are having problems?" Harry says slowly. Hermione coughs.
He looks...
Draco's eyes flick up to the rear-vision mirror, meeting Harry's gaze.
He wonders at what point Draco's loyalty to Voldemort became an informed choice.
Harry drops his gaze to the steering wheel. There's two slightly faded patches on it, where Draco must have rested his hands constantly. Harry lifts his hands and places them over the same patches.
“Me too. I forgot to take my potion last night. Maybe I don’t need it anymore,” Ron said doubtfully.
“You will never beat me in Potions,” he said calmly, certain of this one fact of life, and Harry smiled.
Astoria rounds on him at once. “Honestly, Harry! Does your brain cell ever get lonely in there?”
“In two of the cases, the person placed the time-turner somewhere safe, where it could be found and used by the rescuers in the future.”
But the noise seems to bring little comfort to Narcissa. Her mouth trembles slightly and her head bows slightly, as if her sorrow is a physical weight.
He wakes up as they're driving along some side road in the middle of nowhere. He blinks and slowly draws himself back to wakefulness, watching the fields rush past.
Across the empty stretch of sunlit floorboards, the endless expanse of white wall seems to mock him. That sad little photograph, right in the centre. Hermione and Ron's faces are nothing but pale blurs.
Ron stares at him, mouth agape. "Well," he says at last. "I take back everything I said about you being a terrible investigator, Harry."
Because all day, he's still thinking of the look of agony on Draco's face as he disappeared again. As if a Crucio had just been cast on him. And he doesn't feel like he should be here, celebrating with friends and family, unwrapping gifts and eating sweets while, somewhere in the world, Draco is drifting alone and, in all probability, seriously hurt or exhausted. Hermione catches him deep in thought a few times and frowns at him, and Ron takes him aside.
"Harry," she says, just after the waitress has disappeared, "they'll be doing the big announcement next week, so I wanted to make sure you knew first. But I had to wait for everything to be properly confirmed, of course."
When he's back at his office, Harry pours the memory into the pensieve and wonders whether he should leave it until tomorrow. It's nearing five o'clock now, and he should be going home soon. But the temptation proves too much, and he enters the pensieve.
more reason to be jealous. You and Harry are terribly good friends.
“Think you’re funny, don’t you?” Draco and Astoria say simultaneously. They pause and look at each other while Harry and Matthew laugh harder.
“The Littlest Death Eater!”
was the greatest wizard.”
"I don't know, Harry, but I'm sure he'll turn up at the manor any second. Narcissa will let you know, won't she?"
Harry has no doubt that Draco — in a pique of frustration after trying to pen a suitably formal letter — wrote this particular message with the intention that it would never be read by anyone, ever, let alone Harry himself. There's a strange honesty and directness in the letter and Harry finds it difficult to imagine Draco — with his cold expressions and inability to express himself beyond childish insults — wrote it.
Astoria shakes her head. "I don't know. I think he tried to say something a few times, but I was a bit — angry, really — still trying to ask questions, and Narcissa was speaking over him. She kept telling him he
But to his surprise, she shakes her head. "Astoria says you received your car licence. Much like an Apparation licence, I suppose." She doesn't look at Harry; instead, she stares at the car. "You want to drive it. And I think Draco would like to see it driven again." She glances at Harry. "Sometimes, it seems you genuinely want to find my son."
"Get plenty of rest, you can't afford to take tomorrow off too," she says.
"How awful," Harry teases. "People being nice to you. How
* * *
He turns. Hermione is running through the grass, her robes getting tangled in her legs, her cloak billowing out behind her. She arrives breathless and tousled, her cheeks red with cold.
“Well, if you hadn’t said anything — "
"Very funny, Potter." Draco turns onto the coastal walking track. "My father was quite masterful at appearing cold and aloof, discouraging anybody approaching. I rather hoped to have a similar effect on people."
"No." He wonders if Narcissa will reprimand him for knowing so little about Malfoy, but she seems to be caught in other thoughts, staring down at the photograph with a pensive expression.
* * *
"Good. Closed the Fenwick one."
Warm light spills from around the corner, where the bedroom is. Ginny will be there, reading
"Is this...for work?" Hermione asks after a long moment. "Harry...you know the potion doesn't work like that. It doesn't miraculously give you all the answers, it just offers paths to the best possible outcome. And the side-effects can be very dangerous..."
and that he, too, had known what they had gone through. Death…so quick and easy…
They stay there for a long time, the snow falling and the stars rising.
He Disapparates.
* * *
And with that single word, Harry had been assigned to work with the Investigative Division for the next eighteen months. He hadn’t been very pleased about it and there had been considerable mutterings about ‘missed fieldwork’. His supervisors had been suitably soothing, telling Harry he already outclassed every Auror as far as practical wandwork was concerned and there was no need to worry about his skills growing rusty.
“Did you lie?” Draco said.
"Well, quite frankly — yes. You're pureblood, you said, and...I mean, not that I have a problem with it, of
"Fourth floor. They won't let anyone in," Harry says, and the anger he initially felt bubbles to the surface again. "Those bloody Healers, they're treating him like an experiment. Their eyes lit up like Christmas trees when they learned he'd been splinched in two time eras. They're running every test under the sun, and they wanted to bring in a team of Healers from the Research Division."
* * *
“Draco...Draco never had a time-turner,” she says, one hand reaching for her necklace. “But...Lucius did.”
Behind them, Draco followed, keeping his eyes on the ground. Around him, the voices hissed.
"Look, I know it can't have been fun for him — stuck in the past for three years — but you're not responsible for his recovery, Harry. You did your job, you located him, that's all you needed to do."
“Oh, you know. Chat to it, play music for it, that kind of thing. Helps it grow.”
He turns.
"Didn't realise I needed a reason to spend time with you."
"I suppose we have something in common then." Draco lifts one shoulder in a careless shrug. "Fetch some glasses."
But all he can think about how close he came to never looking back. To never flicking his eyes up to the rear-vision mirror.
He could pretend. That if he turns around, it will be December. All dark inside the apartment, only the glow of tiny lights illuminating the room. Draco will be standing by the tree.
Ron winces again. Harry stares into the flames of the fire.
"...very pleased with your investigative work, Potter," Williamson is saying, but all he can think about is the way she says
Ginny dresses up for the date and Harry thinks she looks beautiful, even if her practice ran overtime and she arrived half an hour late. He orders an oak-aged rum; Ginny opts for a glass of riesling.
"My arrival is ill-timed," Narcissa comments, and Harry quickly shakes his head. Narcissa is already beginning to look doubtful and the last thing he wants is for her to flee, taking any useful information with her.
Harry looks up, barely paying attention. He nods, tries to smile, says something.
She shakes her head. “I’ll need to research it. Perhaps talk to some Unspeakables — they know about this sort of magic. But Harry, you must know that there’s only three recorded cases of this happening. It’s so rare to diagnose because nobody ever knows — someone’s usually secretly using a time-turner, and one day they just vanish and that’s it. But of the three recorded cases...”
He leaves the bedroom instead, walking to the front door, hearing every footstep echo around the empty room.
“Don’t be silly. Slughorn’s still on, I see.”
Hermione had warned him about this, he thinks. She'd specifically mentioned side-effects, but she hadn't gone into any detail. Draco probably needs proper medical care, Harry thinks with worry. People who might actually know about causes and symptoms and that sort of thing. Places that could provide appropriate medication. Or even the manor, where Draco could be surrounded by familiar rooms — luxurious ones, not a tiny spare bedroom in Harry's apartment — and have the attention of his mother, who knows him far better than anyone else, and be doted on by the house-elves.
Later on, after he's farewelled Ron and Hermione and returned to the apartment, he remembers what they said.
He covered the letters with a bit of parchment. The Gryffindor across from him frowned and moved their wand again, trying to carve the letters in.
* * *
* * *
“In the castle? Highly unlikely.” Harry shook his head.
Harry, taught well by now to look at every detail, catches the look of brief surprise that flashes across her face. She's wearing a casual sundress, printed with roses, and her sun-streaked hair is pulled back into a half-hearted ponytail. Not the way she'd present herself usually, Harry guesses, and he smiles apologetically.
There’s a pause, then Harry starts laughing. “Merlin, you really
“Just don’t say the words ‘Death Eater’, ‘Dad’, ‘ferret’, or ‘battle’ around him,” Seamus said, slapping a card down.
"These are my memories, Potter. This is real. September fifth, 2003. I drove to the Cornish coast."
"Maybe he was getting it resized because of recent weight loss," Hermione says, and Harry wishes he'd thought of that.
, he had said.
"I didn't. That's the problem."
"Coming home is hard. Going away is easy," Draco says.
Narcissa is silent.
"I saw." Narcissa descends the rest of the stairs and stands on the last step, one hand still resting on the banister and the other rising to touch at her necklace. "When I saw the car, I thought — for a moment — Draco was coming home."
She seems casual. Never consciously aware of her movements, whether it's tucking her bare feet under the chair or tracing patterns on the mug. Quick to smile, Harry thinks, seeing the beginning of fine laugh lines around her eyes. Her light tan and sun-tinted hair suggest someone who enjoys being outdoors; a stack of books on the corner of the table with titles like
Ron takes a seat in one of the armchairs and helps himself to the bowl of toffees.
“No!”
"Don't start," she laughs. "I hear that all the time from Ron when he needs help tracing a Dark artefact or potion."
* * *
Astoria pours the tea. "I often said that to him, in a roundabout way. I'd joke that he was driving everywhere to try and find a place that didn't exist."
“Yet,” they’d said.
“Ron,” she says, “fetch my copy of
Someone taps his shoulder and the memory dissolves.
Harry nods mutely.
But Harry's happy to leave the past where it is.
"Don't — " he says, just as she opens the door and strides inside.
"I'm here about Draco Malfoy," he says, watching Astoria's face carefully.
"I...no. I..."
he picked up from the stationery shop in Hopper's Crossing. He's read nearly every article twice. There's a page devoted to Ginny in the 'Top Ten Female Players' section. The page is peppered with photographs of her and references to 'Harry Potter's ex-fiancee'. That annoys Harry. Ginny's struggled for years to carve a name for herself, but at countless sports interviews and Quidditch articles, Harry's name has always been dragged in by enthusiastic interviewers. Now it seems even though they're no longer in a relationship, she's still having the same problems.
"Not really. Our winters are quite mild."
And then he remembers that Draco has spent the past three years stuck in the past, where he thought he'd die, unable to touch anyone, his voice unheard, his presence unseen. For three long years. Of course it would all be surreal afterwards, and of course he'd smile at Harry and walk with him along the white cliffs of Dover and share childhood memories. It's only gratitude, nothing more. He only ever initiated contact to reassure himself it was real.
"Hullo," he says. The girl studies him a moment, then takes a bite of strawberry before uttering a messy "ullo" in return and toddling out of sight.
The door opens and Hermione storms in, her hair an outraged cloud and her expression terrifying.
"Well." Hermione reaches for the time-turner and pockets it. "I'll contact the Unspeakables, and I'll let you know when they've completed the spell."
Williamson says nothing for a long moment. "This is a serious decision, best not rushed. Perhaps you should take a few days to consider our offer."
Harry closes the curtains. White, he thinks, staring at the material as he slowly draws it across the window. Why is everything white in this place? He steps into his bedroom. The same bed he and Ginny slept in, neatly made with white sheets and cream-coloured covers. His bedside table, nothing on it except a glass of water and a book.
Hermione sips her butterbeer and says nothing.
"Sorry," Harry says unapologetically. "Is Astoria about?"
"Good," Ginny says, slipping beneath the covers and turning off her lamp.
Something's different.
“I suppose,” said Hermione, sounding slightly taken aback.
“Harry’s sick,” he told him. “Just a cold.”
"Draco's possessions," she says.
Another.
"Well — yes — "
Draco inhales slowly, then exhales. "I hated it," he says. A pause, then he repeats himself. "I hated it. I
The first thing he hears is Draco's voice. Raised and angry.
On and on they go.
There's something soothing about driving at night, he thinks. The road unwinds before him, the headlights fading away into the darkness ahead. Draco sleeps beside him, forehead resting against the window, his breathing deep and even. He sleeps better now, Harry thinks. The tension isn't lining his face now, like it did back at Landewednack.
"Yes, quite," Draco says casually, though there's a hint of gratitude in his voice, and he politely nods at the guide before retreating hastily. Once they're safely out of earshot, Harry starts laughing and Draco frowns.
Nothing seems to happen, however.
"Draco Malfoy — "
She looks at him, then nods once.
Yes, it seems strange to be here while Draco Malfoy may have died three years ago.
Draco looks at him, opens his mouth, then evidently changes his mind and closes his mouth again.
* * *
"You don't look very well," Butterworth says. "I hope you haven't come to work with a cold," he adds disapprovingly. There have been a number of highly contagious colds going around the Ministry.
And maybe, somehow, he's still not doing enough. He found the notebook a month ago, for Merlin's sake, but he'd only just spoken to the solicitor? What sort of investigator was he? He was rubbish.
"Harry."
"Come back."
"Yeah, well..." Harry tries to focus on the cup of tea before him, making sure every last grain of sugar melts away to nothing. "I just don't think we could've been friends."
* * *
Draco sat next to him.
“He's somewhere safe,” Ron said. Draco glanced at Hermione's closed face.
"You know I won't." Hermione straightens up suddenly and glances towards the kitchen. "Oh. Tea's getting cold."
"Oh, there's no need for stuffy introductions," Astoria says irritably. "You're Hermione Granger, who
"Now you're getting it, Potter," he says.
* * *
"Why not?" Draco says, returning the challenge with a raised eyebrow.
Harry ends up with a white-knuckled grip on the edges of his seat, leaning far back and biting his lip to stop from rebuking Draco
He opens the car door and steps out. The wind is fierce now, nipping at his face, lashing at his hair, snapping at his clothes. He holds his wand aloft and whispers.
“Lucius spent nearly all the family fortune acquiring it,” Narcissa continues. “It was madness, but he could not be dissuaded. He had already fled to Crete by then, but he frequently visited us to speak of his future plans.”
, the title announces, but the rest of the page has been torn away. That moment, he realises — Buckbeak attacking Draco — must have been a scene of utter humiliation for Draco. Judging from the lack of notes, Draco hadn't prepared adequately for the lesson and had consequently been thoroughly defeated by the hippogriff. Of course, Harry thought irritably, it had been Draco's own fault — the arrogant prat hadn't been paying attention.
Harry starts laughing. Draco drops the book and rolls over onto his back, looking up at Harry.
"I was thinking somewhere more regional," Harry interrupts. "The Devon and Cornwall Constabulary."
No. The sunlight, he thinks. It's fiercer, as if it's the light of a summer day. And the shopkeeper...his face seems different somehow, as if slightly more lined. His robes, too, seem somehow more worn, more creased.
"This sounds familiar," Hermione says quietly, and Harry's attention snaps to her.
"I haven't got a problem," Harry says, "but Holdsworth might. Confidentiality and all that. Long as you don't tell anyone you saw the memory, I'll be fine."
“Look at them! So disapproving. Identical expressions,” Matthew says. “Like two angry peas in a pod.”
But it's not. It's people's lives, lost family and friends, people desperate to know.
"Those fields," Harry says, awestruck. Fields of bright yellow line the narrow road, stretching away until the brilliant yellow meets the azure sky.
He knows that feeling well. The empathy runs through his veins, threading its way beneath his skin. People wanting something, everything. Throughout the war, that feeling followed him like a distant Dementor, hovering over his thoughts and clouding his days with self-doubt and misery. The worst part was knowing they didn't want the real Harry. They wanted a charade, a false and brittle brightness. A normal person, a confident person who knew exactly what to do.
The textbooks, the notebook. He reads the same lines over and over.
"Oh, is this what happens when I try to do something nice for you?" Draco says. "Now, get onto the M40 and stay on it until you reach Hockley Heath. Then take the M6."
Harry flushes guiltily, thinking how the argument had reminded him of their schoolyard rivalry. He'd been quick to feel defensive and take every remark as an insult. Now that he analyses the entire argument, he thinks that he would have interpreted Draco's comment about Neville as a harmless joke or even a playful jest had Ron or Hermione said it.
"Well," Ron says doubtfully, "doesn't that create a conflict of interest, really?"
Draco opens his mouth and speaks, but the words are silent. Harry bites his lip.
Draco still hasn't woken, a Healer's assistant tells Harry as she fusses about the charts at the end of Draco's bed. There's not much he can do.
Ron drags over a nearby footrest and perches on it, looking worried. “That’s the whole case, isn’t it? I mean, you’ve been searching for months. Not really a revelation.”
Harry wakes early and has a leisurely shower before dressing and considered whether to call Holdsworth and plead sickness again. The white cliffs of Dover await him and Draco, after all.
The witch at Reception has to tell Harry three times. She must think he's especially slow, as he can only stare uncomprehendingly as she smiles patiently and repeats the words cheerfully.
“What do you mean?”
Draco turns and looks at him. "Away from you," he says.
Butterworth shrugs. “Been a slow month. You can leave if you want. I’ll collect the sample and Glassbrook here will finish photographing the scene. Rest of the team will be along soon.”
"Matt's an architect," Astoria says, noticing Harry staring at the blueprints.
“Oh, Merlin. Oh, no,” Astoria says, looking pale and wretched. “No, no. All this time, and Draco’s been stuck in the past somewhere...” She begins to cry. It’s strange to see her cry — bright, breezy Astoria, always smiling — and Harry looks away uncomfortably as Matthew soothes her.
When he was walking down the corridor, they attacked him. Not with wands or fists but with words, which were worse.
When he returns to the room, Draco is dressed and looking out the window, watching the raindrops race each other along the glass pane. Harry is strongly reminded of that day in the apartment, when Draco first spoke to him.
Harry walks up to Malfoy.
"Thanks, Ron."
"I know." Draco rests a hand lightly on the glass of the sliding door again. "I can't tell you where I am."
“Are you practised in the art of Legilimency?”
"You should always take your wand with you, just in case," Harry says quickly. "What if you were attacked?"
Harry went home with his own darkness those nights, as though Draco had broken off a piece of shadow for Harry. Harry never slept those nights. He dreamed instead. About that day.
Harry’s heart drops. He glances away, gazing out into the night. A wind is picking up around the playground, making the swings sway. If Harry listens closely, he can hear the rattle of the chains.
"I'm getting better at that," Draco says. "Telling them apart. Memories and dreams and reality."
"I don't even know where we're going," Harry argues, and Draco picks up the road atlas.
"You're
Draco would like the mountains best, Harry thinks.
"It's interesting," Draco says, "to openly advertise their town as the birthplace of a dictator."
No. Instead, he hasn't said a single word about everything that happened. Just sat in silence with Draco, and gone with him on long car trips that are obviously very exhausting for Draco, and talked about stupid things, like Oliver Cromwell and shipwrecks.
"I...well..." Hermione taps the clasp with her wand and the transfiguration melts away, revealing a time-turner. "Merlin," she whispers. "This is the last time-turner. I wonder..."
, then onto
Ginny leans over and pats Harry’s hand. “Sometimes,” she says fondly, “you have terrible taste. Just

“You look in a Ravenclaw mood,” he offered, but Harry shook his head and took a Slytherin seat. He rested his chin in his hand and reached for the porridge although he made no move to eat it, just poke it around.
“What about Augustus McVicar, the father of modern potions?” Astoria asks.
He can’t.
“What are the coordinates?”
Harry half-listens to Astoria and Matthew bicker. From Matthew's words about messing with people's heads, his thoughts flow like a river until he's recalling his earlier conversation with Hermione. He'd been able to forget it for an hour or so, while he was driving, but now it sits in his head like a heavy rock.
Harry looks up again. “I like to imagine the memories are all here. If you look hard enough. All the ghosts.”
But Ron and Hermione — both perched on the stools by the island counter — look at him with identical expressions of hurt and betrayal.
"Tell me the details of your case," Butterworth says, reading the page.
Harry considered Ron’s suggestion thoughtfully.
," Harry mutters.
Maybe the rain isn't so bad, Harry thinks. It reminds him of all those grey winter days and foggy mornings. All those nights driving, driving, with the ghost of Draco beside him.
That night, the windows rattle in their panes like a restless spirit caught in the winter winds.
Then —
Harry steps onto the shoulder of the road, feeling the loose gravel give way to soft earth. The stalks of wheat bend gently as he runs his hand over them. Summer has bleached the colour from the field; it's a pale gold, almost the colour of bones...
Harry pauses. Draco's voice lilted at the end, morphing the statement into an uncertain half-question.
Draco smirks at him over Astoria’s shoulder.
"All right."
They go to a café for lunch. Harry considers the day's specials; Draco quickly puts a stop to that.
The first few places they try have no vacancies. It's the start of the summer holiday season and Cornwall has proven a preference for many travellers. At last, they find an inn with a room available. Just one, but at least it's a twin share. Harry thinks Draco might make a fuss regardless, but Draco just shrugs and pays the security deposit. When they manage to locate the room — the numbering system has been forsaken in lieu of twee room names — Draco lays claim to the bed nearest the window and immediately opens the window. Harry wonders if it's a habit. At Hogwarts, Seamus zealously left windows open regardless of season or weather, and it often led to quarrels amongst those less keen on the biting cold of Scotland's climate. In the end, Ron had — in a fit of frustration — used a ferocious application of Spellotape to permanently close the window.
“I’m going to propose to you, spend six months planning an elaborate wedding, pay ludicrous amounts for a caterer and live music, go on a honeymoon to Italy, have an amazing time, and
Harry listens to Ginny speak. He's always liked her passion for things, he thinks. It's one of the first things he loved about her. When they were in the midst of the war and she was so full of fiery energy, her eyes bright and her hands steady as she lifted her wand. She never looked as beautiful as she did during the battle, he thinks, with her dirt-smudged face and torn robes, when her strength and spirit shone brighter than ever.
Harry crosses the room after a long moment, opening the sliding door to the balcony. The warm summer air caresses his face and he turns to face the faint breeze, feeling it whisper through his hair. He leans on the balcony railing, gazing at the street below, and after a few minutes he sees the Renault, headlights ghosting along the road as it goes past. He watches it until the red taillights have faded into darkness.
In incepto finis est.
Draco Malfoy stands there.
"All right, calm down. You're working late — it's past six, you know. Saw your light on and figured you'd be here. Seem to practically live in the office these days." Ron frowns. "Everything all right with you and Ginny?"
“What are you lot looking at? Clear off, the lot of you!” he said irritably and the faces stared, then dispersed grudgingly.
“I’d like to see you try.” Harry smiled and Ron grinned, grabbing the chess set as Harry cleared the table of the other things: exploding snap cards, chocolate frogs, a few items from Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes. Things that belonged to another time, another world.
A soft blue glow lights the path before him. There's a sign saying South-West Coastal Walk and he follows the pointing arrow. The wild winter sea is a roar now and the wind is strong and bitterly cold, sweeping straight along the Celtic Sea and licking the crests of the waves before bringing a salted sting to Harry's skin. Even with the wandlight, the path is treacherous in the wet weather and dark night, and Harry nearly falls a few times. If Draco's here, surely he's laughing.
Rain trickled down Draco's collar.
"I'll keep it in the evidence archives."
. The words the Ministry liked to use during Voldemort's reign. It sounded so much nicer than
Harry flips through the rest of the notebook, but the pages beyond September 9 are all blank and —
"I assure you," Narcissa says, setting her needlework aside, "it is."
...or maybe he took the wand and left. Maybe Draco finally came to his senses, realised the complete madness of the entire situation — sleeping in Harry Potter's apartment, taking road trips together— and left. Perhaps Draco remembered their hateful school-years and reminded himself of the hundreds of reasons they could never be friends, and stole Harry's wand in vengeance for Harry stealing his, so many years ago.
“I’ll hold you to that. Oh, speaking of Italy, Neville’s returned. Got some new specimens he wants to show you.”
"Yes." Harry feels as nervous as he did before he faced the Hungarian Horntail.
Harry bites back an angry retort. He didn't realise he'd been invited here solely to act as some sort of Muggle interpreter.
His heart shattered.
At breakfast, Draco could not see Harry anywhere.
Hermione smiles. “Yes. Now go and get some rest.”
It seems strange, to be living in the apartment with its clean white walls and convenience-sized Christmas tree. To be walking along the streets of London, passing beneath the bright and extravagant festive displays: twinkling lights looped overhead, and strings of gold stars, and electric-blue snowflakes. To see the people laughing, crowded in pubs and inns, drinking spiced cider and mulled wine.
"Come in," he says instead because what else can he do, with Narcissa Malfoy standing on his doorstep?
"Sorry. I decided to drive here instead."
Harry hesitates. "No," he says at last.
They continue on, driving into the endless night. The clouds come rolling in over the sky, shrouding the moon, and it begins to lightly rain around midnight. It's almost mesmerising. Harry stares at the silver rain, illuminated by the headlights, and thinks he can see a thousand different patterns. Draco is silent and a few times, Harry thinks he's fallen asleep. Whenever he glances over, however, he sees the light reflected in Draco's eyes as he gazes ahead.
“I’m finished,” he said, and he was. No rough edges now, nothing left wanting. Perhaps some hairline cracks, some shards that had somehow gone astray. But for the most part, he felt everything again. Yes, he could feel now. He could feel every muscle working beneath his skin, the sinew and bone shifting with each other. He could feel his hands, hold them still. He could hold his wand straight. He could pour ingredients — carefully, tensely — but he could.
"I can see you're still worried about him, Harry," she says accusingly. "You look awful. Promise me you'll do your best to relax and take a break, all right? Look after yourself. Go for a drive, you've been enjoying that lately. And I know it's very unmanly and everything, heaven forbid, but please
Harry thinks he won't, just to spite Draco, but despite his best efforts he falls asleep somewhere west of Shrewsbury.
Harry gazes, struck with incredulity, at the observations.
"I've been here before."
If Draco took Harry's wand, surely it was for a good reason. Draco hasn't got a wand, Harry remembers. He'd borrowed his mother's, Harry knows, but he left it behind when he vanished and, Harry realises, he's been wandless since. Maybe he needed to perform a spell, for some reason, and he didn't want to wake Harry so...
, will you?”
He unclenches his jaw and Disapparates to the Ministry atrium.
The train rushes through.
"Never mind," the assistant says meekly, and disappears to find Astoria.
Harry sits on the edge of the bed and removes the wand from his pocket. Hawthorn, ten inches, unicorn hair core.
the sort of childish, petty — ”
And, caught in a seething fog of anger, Harry throws a handful of Floo powder into the fireplace.

The white walls of his apartment greet his gaze.

Harry wakes up the next morning. Saturday, he realises after panicking for a moment and thinking he's running late for work. There's a voice calling from the kitchen. Hermione. She must have Floo'd here.
Astoria nods. "While we were arguing, he went and changed into his clothes. As soon as he reappeared, Narcissa took him down to reception to sign out — just
But Draco sits on the passenger's side and opens the atlas, and so Harry takes his cue and sits in the driver's seat. He readjusts the mirrors slightly and reverses out, half-expecting Draco to say something about his inadequate driving skills. Harry's realised, over the course of their journey, that Draco is indeed a very skilled driver.
He paces his office, mind racing. The memories rush through his head like water.
to come home, to the manor, and everything would be all right."
“It’s annoying, having a bunch of ickle second-years constantly muttering behind you,” Ron added unexpectedly. “So clear off.”
in the fireplace?”
* * *
Harry Apparates back to the apartment while Matthew drives home. Matthew had been keen to celebrate over a few butterbeers, saying that Astoria had offered an invitation to dinner, but Harry politely declined, saying he had to do some work.
The journey back to London is slow and it's seven o'clock when he reaches the apartment. He parks the car, slowly walks up the stairs feeling insurmountably weary, and unlocks the door. The apartment is dark and the curtains open. He gazes across the kitchen, to the view beyond the balcony. He'll miss those trains, if nothing else.
"You don't know what you want, Draco."
She glances up at him. "Well, truthfully...I'm rather surprised. I always assumed Malfoy disappeared to some luxurious holiday destination, just to escape his old life. But this..."
, he'd told Hermione. Not Draco, who was unbearably stubborn — he'd tried for an entire year to fix that damn Vanishing Cabinet, and even when the stupid prat had been pointing a wand at Dumbledore, hand shaking, a look of complete terror in his eyes, he still hadn't admitted he couldn't complete Voldemort's task. Harry remembers that split second before the Death Eaters arrived, when Draco began to lower his wand as Dumbledore offered a different path.

side," Harry says, finding his voice thanks to Butterworth's reassuringly disinterested expression. "The file you've got now — that's a Muggle one."
"Home...?" he repeats.
"They must be freezing," Harry observes. Even in summer, the sea here would hold an unwelcome chill.
Harry does, but so does everyone. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, all of them. All the people who saw friends and family die before them. All those who heard Voldemort's voice echoing throughout Hogwarts, the place they always considered an untouchable haven. All those who watched the castle crumble around them.
“But where would he get a time-turner from?” Ron interrupts. “They were all destroyed by the Ministry, remember?”
"I need a pensieve," he tells her. She yawns, looking unsurprised.
Harry laughs incredulously. "
"It's a Muggle one."
Draco and Harry return to the car and Harry wonders if Draco will ask him to choose another place. Maybe they'll keep driving, until spring melts into summer. A high summer, he thinks, with a propane-blue sky and fields of gold.
* * *
“Pull over.”
She laughs. "Well, I can't do Saturday, we're attending a Holyhead match to take notes, so I'll be gone Friday night too. Sunday I've got debriefings."
"Not impossible," Harry argues.
Maybe he just wishes Draco was here.
And it's a dizzying, devastating realisation, but he can't avoid it. Even now, Draco's voice whispers through his mind like snow.
Harry sits for a long moment, listening to the engine idle, waiting for his hands to steady again. How long will it take Draco to recover this time? What price is he paying right now?
"Have you visited Eeylops?" she asks.
"Why?"
"Missing the old place?" she asks, standing in the doorway. Harry sits in the chair behind the desk, regardless of the faint patina of dust over it.
"Give me a minute," Harry says slowly. He opens the car door; Draco kills the engine.
That was the problem. He had always been prepared for a Before, but never stopped to think about the After. In his mind, there was always a Before. In his head, there would be a war, and — and — nothing.
“It most certainly is. Go away. I’m not getting you out of this.”
Astoria rolls her eyes. “At this point, I feel
* * *
After all, he'd thought the same when the investigation first started. And even further back, when he first heard Draco had disappeared. He had been twenty-three then and his whole life seemed lit up like summer sky. Friends and drinks at the pub and Ginny, beautiful, bright Ginny, and they'd only just bought the apartment and there was so much energy in them. And Draco's disappearance had been nothing but a footnote in his life, a brief read of a newspaper headline, a small snort of contempt as he imagined Draco gloating in an expensive retreat somewhere. Then he'd effortlessly moved on, never sparing the incident another thought until the file landed on his desk three years later.
Astoria answers.
"It is fixed?" she asks.
* * *
And, as he’s learned from this division, a story can be found in the smallest details: a stitch in a robe, a smile across a room, the faint tremble of a hand. He can pick a story out from the bruise dancing across Ron's knuckles, from the droplets of blood on his collar, from the way his knee jitters as he spins his tale.
"You have to deliver the eulogy," Malfoy says. Astoria looks at him, a strange mix of desperation and disbelief on her face.
“No,” Harry said quietly. “That is the Patronus of Seamus Finnigan, and he lives.”
There's a lull in silence and Harry realises Astoria has fallen asleep. The memory should have ended. He glances away from her, then looks up and freezes. Draco's eyes, reflected in the rear-vision mirror, are locked on his.
"Potion for my dragon pox," Harry retorts, and the shopkeeper retreats very hastily.
Hermione looks at him, raises her eyebrows, and then turns round to busy herself with the kettle.
Draco was too scared to ask why, though in his heart he knew. Harry didn’t want to sit where murderers sat. He didn’t want to get too close.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake.” Ron waves his wand at the fireplace. “
Notes and notes of tiny writing in the margins.
"Oh, thank Merlin," Astoria says, sinking into the chair beside Harry. "Oh, thank Merlin. All this time..." She looks around the room, as if expecting to find Draco there, smiling at her. "Where is he?"
He doesn't have to guess. Judging by the amount of Quidditch gear she's shoving into her bag, and looking at the little washbag sitting on her bedside table, her team won their first match of the season.
"It was an observation."
, the heading states, and then written underneath:
Harry departs, thoughts churning like wind-tossed waves.
“Quiet, please,” Slughorn said, and Harry could see the war written across his face. The words hidden in the wrinkles fanning across his forehead, the sag of his mouth, the duels and scars and deaths all written there clear as day.
Some time after sunrise, it begins to rain. Even the warmth of summer cannot deter the low clouds rolling in across the grey horizon. Harry goes for an early morning run, a habit leftover from his Auror training. He comes back, slicked with mud and sweat, and takes a hot shower. Draco is still asleep, he thinks, and he goes downstairs to breakfast. Typical that after Draco's returned, it rains. All this nice weather and all he did was walk moodily along cliffs and think of Draco, and now he's finally happy, it's pouring.
Draco doesn't move his gaze. "Really?" he asks, sounding disbelieving. "You seemed to think otherwise earlier."
"I didn't even notice," Ginny says, and he catches the sadness in her voice and holds her tighter.
Harry nods and tries to think of something optimistic to say.
"No!"
Harry came in and without hesitation sat down at the Hufflepuff table as though he did so every day. Draco looked across at him and caught his eye for a moment. He felt an explanation was needed.
He goes home that night and finds Draco waiting outside his door.
“Where do you go?”
In the evening, Harry drives.
time-turner," Harry tries, but nothing happens. The shopkeeper's eyes grow even wider.
The next day, Harry calls in sick to work. It's unusual for him, and even Holdsworth looks concerned, saying she hopes he'll feel better soon.
"It's all right," Draco says. "It's fine."
"Yeah, well." Harry stops tracing patterns and takes a swig of his butterbeer. "I'm not applying."
* * *
The storm gives way to rain and when Harry wakens the next morning, the sky is a pale grey. It starts to rain lightly during his morning run, and when he trails back into the guesthouse — leaving sodden footprints behind him — the receptionist looks dismayed.
The words were strangely familiar, but Draco let them go. Harry was here again. Everything would be alright.
"Hey." Ron glances at the owls roosting on the hatstand. "All right?"
Unnecessarily cruel, Harry thought, flipping open his
"As have we all," Lucius says sharply. After a long moment, he looks away. "I cannot afford any errors. In three months, make sure Draco comes to Crete with you."
Draco takes over the driving at Birmingham again. Harry isn't sure where they're going, but he doesn't mind.
“I’m afraid I’m not fond of eagle owls,” Malfoy says to the shopkeeper.

The first Hogsmeade visit came up.
groups of people skulking around and hissing,” Ron said and it broke the tension. They laughed.
"He's not mysterious," Astoria says with exasperation.
"My mother would worry endlessly if she found out."
