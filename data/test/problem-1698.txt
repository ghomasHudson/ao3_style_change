Time for a shower, maybe.
“Congratulations on your new position, Malfoy.”  Spinks, Draco’s co-worker in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, sneered as they passed in the corridor on the Ministry‘s fourth level.
“The way the rivers came together in this spot made whirlpools, and a lot of boats were lost,” Harry told him.  “They wanted the Buddha to calm the waters.  It worked.”
“You said to bring every wyvernous thing I owned. It would be cruel not to bring the car.”
with him?”
Draco flushed again and apologized to her.
Draco flushed.  “I apologize if I have been making a nuisance of myself.  I had hoped I could be of assistance or improve communication between our peoples.”
“Good idea, I’ll do that.  The bathroom’s upstairs.  How did you know what kind it was?”
“You can show him how to do my shoulders and arms,” he told Baines.  “And my feet and calves.  That’s all.”
“If your papa agrees.  We can have some tea to go with the biscuits.”
“Well, you don’t need our approval,” said Andromeda.  “I just hope that witch or wizard knows how lucky they are.”
He half expected a comment about werewolves polluting the family blood, but Draco sounded, if anything, eager. “I have a little cousin, then?  What’s he like?”
Not until the birds’ screams were lost in the distance did Draco bring them down to land in a meadow.  “Looks like you got a scratch on your arm.  Did any bite you?”
Living alone on a mountain for years, he had found companionship in the poems of other monks who had lived among those same peaks. One of the poems came back to him now.
He rode the swells of tranquil pleasure and drew Harry back into a kiss of deep sweetness.
He sounds as inarticulate as I usually do, Harry thought. “What are you saying?  What happened?”
Hermione was still reading. “She would have lived at Wilton House, then.”
Dive on in, the water’s fine.
8888888
“It’s a nonsense verse for kids, I used to read it to Teddy!”
Almost as soon as Harry touched it, the spots were gone, and Draco’s shirt was white as the driven snow.  Harry didn’t know how that happened, but he liked it.
“Bill Weasley?  If he weren’t married?” Malfoy tilted his head, considering.  “Well… maybe.  He’s intelligent, adventurous, principled – and he has a certain style, with the earring and ponytail.”
“Yeah.”
“What, is my brave boyfriend getting bashful?” Draco sounded amused. “We might as well warm up in bed. Can’t go out fishing again until the good ship
“What mischief, Potter?  When’s the last time you did anything for fun?”
“Zipper,” Harry said, his eyes unaccountably drawn toward Malfoy’s … waistband.  “Um, Zabini.”
Outside, they began walking and soon left the village behind.  It was a clear mild day, with birds singing.  They walked through a forest until Harry’s feet, in ill-fitting hand-me-down shoes, started to hurt.  He slowed down.
“Literature on what topic, Harry?  Of course I’m familiar with a lot of the medieval laws on magical creatures.  But if you want the literature on, say, medicinal plants, you’d be better off asking Poppy Pomfrey or Neville.”
“Nice dragon,” Malfoy commented.
. Well, why not? He settled down to read.
, Potter.  I was going to bend the earpiece a little – but never mind.  You really don’t trust me, do you?”
“When Bellatrix killed Sirius – she was killing her cousin.”  It was still hard for Harry to fathom.  Not that there was any love lost between Harry and his own cousin – but he couldn’t imagine himself and Dudley actually trying to kill each other.
Draco’s arms came around him. “You’re wet,” he grumbled.
He found Draco preparing to leave.
Then with a surprised cry Potter came, and Draco’s hand was slippery with his come, and he thought
"Ok, I'll go with you," he blurted. He didn't know why he'd said that. His muscles ached and his entire body begged for the bed in his flat; its soft mattress and its flannel sheets were as inviting as the best of luxuries.
It was ghastly.
"What?" Draco frowned.  Usually he was more verbose than this.
Potter half smiles. His eyes are still sad but something akin determination starts to show on his face. He pulls at the cork and moves towards the bed.
Draco stops so abruptly that Potter keeps walking before he realises and turns on the spot, a couple of feet ahead.
"Overwhelming?"
Potter laughs, mirthless. “I wish everything was so easy.”
“Good night, Harry.”
Draco’s hands trembled. This could not be happening.
Draco finishes patching up a ghastly wound and checks that the one Potter was pressing on doesn’t bleed anymore. “Ok, on three, one, two, three.”
-o-o-
“No, I’ve said it just for effect. Of course, I would, just… let me check some things before we make a mess of it.” Draco wants to scream, he is going to spend his day off researching for this dork, and he has volunteered. Great. He quickly takes his phone out of his pocket to capture Potter’s goofy expression.
"Just Harry?"
“But you lived together,” he utters, he is sure of that.
“Ah, the Slytherin way… There is, a reason I mean, but it is none of your business.”
"Easy!" Harry exclaimed. "Are you ok?"
He tries only once to get Liam to drive, but he is more stubborn than anything, and Draco finds himself on the driver seat with Potter besides him, with a determined expression. Draco looks at him briefly and then at the steering wheel. He exhales, his hands are sweating, he even can feel the adrenaline rush that comes with fear.
"Why didn't Seamus tell me?" Harry asked, more to himself than anything, but the insufferable git answered all the same.
"Of course, I did."
He rushed to the coat hanger, grabbed the first thing at hand to put it over his pyjama, and ran outside. He didn’t feel the snow hitting his face nor the one under his bare feet. He didn’t bother with the lift and ran up the stairs to Draco’s flat. To Malfoy’s.
"First," he says indignant, crossing his arms, "I'm not that hopeless, and I'm a fast learner, so apart of some minor missteps, I'm doing fine, thank you. Second," he mutters closing the distance between them, "is not as if there are many options on the wizarding world for a Malfoy. Not anymore.”
"Well, they're going to…"
The potion needs to settle for some days before he can do the final step.
Draco takes his wand and exhales. “Ok, let me help.” When the phial is empty they both stares at the still body. Slowly, Dudley’s breathing becomes less shallow; the heart rate rises slightly, a signal that the body is responding to the potion and trying to get the restoring fluid to every inch of his body.
Harry moved frantically to make the already dead flames catch again. Draco shivered, mourning its absence deeply.
“I never thought I would hear you saying that.”
“Oh.” Draco lowers his head and stares at his tea, frowning, processing the information that Luna has poured over him in the first five minutes of their conversation, greetings aside.
“Yeah, it does.”
It couldn’t be. He didn’t…
He wasn’t in top form to argue and let himself be laid down and covered with Harry’s warmed robes. He wanted to protest for water, but his eyelids felt heavy. Before he could ask for it, he had dozed off.
"And I hit back."
“I’ll leave you two alone to talk,” she said. Harry’s silent protest was futile and he saw himself on the company of that imposing woman.
"Oooff, sorry!" Harry said, trying to remain upright when they collided.
He looked at the time in his phone: 3 in the morning. Of course.
“Can I ask you a favour?” Harry whispers and then bites his lip, looking as if he would like to take back the words.
“That stuff,” Draco snorts and resumes walking. “Of course, we are wealthy enough, but the Wizengamot thought fitting that I did some social service in the muggle world as part of my sentence, so here I am.
"Harry, what happened to…?" He raised his finger to his mouth to silence Hermione, who was seated in an armchair by the fire, a book on her lap, just next to their table; but Malfoy heard her anyway, and turned to face Harry with a smirk, spoon clinking delicately in his cup.
“I’ll deny it, I’ll say you have tampered with it.” When Potter keeps staring at him, he can’t help and asks again, “What?”
“So…”
Potter smiles, relieved, and leads the way inside. It’s visiting hours, and the corridors are full of relatives and friends. Some of them cry in silence, others are with a recovering patient, healthy enough to sit on one of the rows of chairs placed against the wall and they chat quietly.
“Has he been questioned yet?”
He knew he had plenty of time, but he liked to shower quickly using as little soap and shampoo as possible even forgoing conditioner altogether. He really didn't need the man to be suspicious that once or twice a week he was sharing his bathroom. Usually Draco came by in the morning, when the man was at work. But it had rained today, down poured, and no library, restaurant, or shop took him in. His clothes had dried, and his backpack was waterproof, but he was covered in mud.
“Yeah.”
“Before they come in I want to… soften the blow a bit, yeah?” Draco went back to pulling at the window, this time from the top pane rather than the bottom.
“I just want to go.”
She was silent for a bit as Draco finished his crisps.
Harry's eyes widened. He hadn't assumed it would be a muggle. "Which window?"
“No… it doesn’t. But…” Ron made sure to make eye contact. “We don’t think he was looking for you. Suppressants… they cause pain when one gets too close to magic. He wouldn’t have sought you out while he was on them. Not on purpose.”
Once he began crying, it became nearly impossible for Hermione to understand him. She did hear, “I just want my mum. ---Please, I’m sorry. I’ll be good.”
“I need to go.”
Her eyebrows knitted together. “And then what…”
“They were muggles. The potions came from somewhere. But… it doesn’t seem to be targeted to you in any way. And that’s what is important here.”
Draco stayed silent.
Harry was sick of waiting. He was absolutely sick of it. Which is why, beyond his better judgement he’d gone for a walk around his neighborhood. He walked through the nicely lined streets to the nearby parks. And he followed the cigarette butts and graffiti until he arrived at what seemed to be a scattering of abandoned buildings.
Harry nodded, but he had a hard time believing it. Somehow everything was somehow about him.
“Help me! How are they going to help me! They'll take me away like they took my mum!” Hermione noticed the slip.
Now they were separated by a the living room sofa and the low table in the center of the room.  Draco knew there was another exit through the kitchen but he didn’t think he’d make it that far.
“Yes?”
"I'll do anything for you not to call the cops. Anything."
“If you’d gone to school, they would’ve noticed that you were homeless and they would’ve helped you.”
Hermione held out her hand, “A bit, yeah.” He took it and she helped him up.  “I’m sorry, Draco. This is quite confusing isn’t it.”
“The same thing that is happening to me.” Tears began to roll down his cheeks. He seemed resigned. “The police took them and they died.”
“Of course,” he mumbled. “And I was never sick because of it.”
He hadn’t given her the information she’d wanted. Unfortunately, it would be up to the aurors.
Draco shook his head.
Ron waved his wand along one of Harry’s blank walls. His spell was too quiet for Harry to hear, “These were found.” And Harry saw clear images of Draco spread along his wall. He was smiling in every photo; along with either a man or a woman.  Both had dark hair, dark eyes, and a bit of sunken face.
He opened his eyes to find a simple bedroom. It certainly wasn’t a hospital room nor a prison cell. At the door stood dark haired woman from the night before. She held large plate and glass of water. “Can I come in?”
"And you'll tell all of your sewer rat friends where to take a shower. Was it open?" Harry asked.
Draco knew now that he’d made a mistake. He’d thought this man was safe. He’d seen him read quietly on his porch. He’d seen him in his garden tending to flowers. He’d seen him stretching and mediating. And he’d underestimated him.
Mediwizard Johnson replied, “That I am not sure of. I am having trouble locating a magical core and signature. I recommend he comes to hospital, for now.”
When she arrived he was not in his room.  He was being walked up and down the hall in what looked like the same clothes they’d discovered him in. There was a young mediwizard by his side, she looked frightened, and he looked unbelievably around him.
“No… we are going to question him under veritaserum. But he is still reacting badly to most magic that is performed on him or in his vicinity. The medi-wizards are working on removing whatever is blocking them.”
“I — well— I was homeschooled. By my parents.”
Draco woke to a strange room. It looked a good deal like a hospital but it was missing the beeping monitors and the battered TV attached to the wall.  Although the anti-septic odor was unmistakable and lumpy mattress lain atop a metal frame. Perhaps a low budget hospital.  It could be part of the prison, but he didn’t think he’d garner his own hospital room in a prison.
“The repelling spells are only meant for muggles.  He wasn’t searching for you so the unplottable wards are not in effect.  The notice me not spells keep you hidden as long as you're not looking for something specific.  And he was looking for something specific: an empty house.” Harry and Ron continued to stare at her. “He’s not likely to stumble across another’s wizard’s home because this is a completely muggle area. So if he was ever to bump into a wizard, you were likely to the most likely candidate.”
Harry walked out of the front door.  He closed the door behind him. “My name is Hermione.” Draco heard a car door open and close. “What is your name?”
“I’ve not been chucked out!” How dare she insinuate anything about his parents they were the best parents once could ask for. “They… passed away.”
Hermione walked from the small guest room behind the mediwizard, auror and levitated stranger.
He spent the day listening. It was near evening when someone asked about the missing blond. “He probably got picked up at the bridge. He keeps going over there.” “It’s dangerous over there.” “It’s where he prays.” That got a laugh from some of them and then they were back to talking about whose turn it was stay up.
This was not how Harry had hoped to be spending his evening. "What are you 16?"
“Yes, I just need to know what happened. Because, Harry is my friend. And right now he’s in a lot of trouble.”
“I am not doing a Fidelius Charm.”
“I’m 19.”
“I’ve some food for you.” It was probably a trick, Draco was sure. But by now he’d remembered that he’d been caught breaking and entering. Likely, his next stop was a prison cell.
“I… is he famous?”
“Everyone here is bonkers.” Draco interjected. “They think I’m crazy, but this is the nuthouse. I’m sure.”
“Both of them?”
“I -  everything’s dangerous.”
“Loads of them. All over.” Hermione decided to drop it, it wasn’t the information she was looking for anyhow.
Hermione interjected, “Actually it is likely.”
She sounded quite insane Draco decided, “mental blocks? … mind healer?”
“Who sent you!” he shouted. Draco simply stared. “You’re no muggle. Who sent you?” This  time deadly quiet.
“What happened to them?”
“Isn’t medicine for sick people?”
So he kept his eyes closed and feigned sleep. He fell back asleep. He did hear the door open and close a few times, but refused to budge.
“You can leave, soon. I won’t call the police but you… can’t leave just yet. I have a friend coming, she can help.”
"Can I go?" The blonde pleaded once more. "I'm sorry and I'll leave and I won't come back."
Hermione squinted at him, “Draco… where did you go to school?”
Draco had noticed the man leave the house a few minutes prior. He had waited until he was sure the man hadn't left anything behind. The man was young and had dark hair, and was dressed in dark jeans, a white collared shirt, and a blue sweater. He hadn't been wearing that when he entered the house. From this Draco legitimized that this man was going on a date, and would be gone for several hours if not the entire night. This however was not the most important fact. The most important fact was that he often left his second floor window unlocked.
At last, an older gentleman in the same lime green robes as the mental patient entered. “Hello Draco, do you remember me?” he asked.
He returned to the bed and stared at where the TV should be.  He would’ve liked to have watched a program before he was taken to jail, but that seemed to be asking too much.
She set the plate and glass by the bed. Draco sat up to see a heaping sandwich along with crisps. “Thank you.” He went for the sandwich first. He didn’t ask any questions. He was hungry. As he ate, she spoke.
Harry and Ron turned to stare at her.
“I … was only trying to help. I said you wouldn’t go to jail and that has been true.” Hermione stayed by the door as she spoke. “I’m still only trying to help. The … doctors say you’ve stopped speaking to them.”
“Draco, I will need to see your wrists.”
“Which school?”
“I… don’t think that’s a good idea.” Harry squinted his eyes at her. “At least not yet. He’s very confused and we still don’t actually know who he is.”
Ron added, “Now that we know that the security wards are lacking, we can fix them before somebody who is actually dangerous is able to get around them.”
Auror Richardson stepped up, “So he is a wizard.”  Hermione could tell from his eager tone that he wanted it to be true.  He wanted to be the one who apprehended the wizard that broke into Harry Potter’s home. It’s a story he could tell all of his buddies.
“The tea poured itself!” He exclaimed.
Hermione Granger had spoken to the aurors, the healers, and Harry.  And she had put all of the puzzle pieces together.  Well, she had put most of the puzzle pieces together.  Once she spoke to Draco she would have gotten to the bottom of it all. The healers had tried and failed. The aurors had tried and failed. But she was determined to make it work.  So it was 6 days after the break-in that she visited St. Mungo’s once again. This time to find the missing piece.
“NO! I’m saying his story makes sense!” Hermione’s eyes had grown twice as large. “This is no one’s fault!”
“No one, I just… I… saw the house was empty and I …” Draco stopped. His eyes got big as a large tawny owl flew into the room. It landed on the man’s shoulder and held out his leg. The man seemed to quickly move the stick around. A short scroll flew from the owl’s leg and the man seemed to scan it for information, his eyebrows creased. He mumbled to himself before looking back up at Draco.
“And they were alone?”
Draco had climbed up there enough to realize that the man hardly noticed he even had windows. So today Draco crept in the night to the first floor window that opened into the man's living room; a window that Draco had left unlocked the last several times he had been here. Draco climbed in and quickly shut the window and climbed the stairs as quickly as he could. There was a bathroom on the first floor, but he knew if he used that one the man would be suspicious as it was mostly for guests and without any guests it shouldn't be used.
"I've heard all the information I need to hear!" Fudge spat suddenly, his eyes now locked on Harry, squinting in disgust. "Take him to Azkaban."
After Ron had heard about Sirius coming back in the Prophet and his soon-to-be trial for innocence, he started to pack his trunk. Nothing else mattered anymore, Harry's life was being pulled together and quite frankly, Ron wanted to be a part of that too. He needed his best friend back.
"I've been checking the Daily Prophet every day as well as Witch Weekly and even the Quibbler, but there haven't even been any sightings. To be honest with you Harry, I thought that you had forgot and I would have preferred it that way. I don't want my worries to be yours too!"
Ron's ears turned pink and so did Hermione's cheeks as they both looked down. Harry had never saw this coming. He was happy for the two of them, sort of. But now, he would always be the third wheel. That's if he and Ron ever made up. "What ab'out you 'arry? Any girls spotting your eye? Heard one time you was getting close to Ginny Weasley!" Ron looked at Harry cautiously, wanting to protect his sister if Harry said anything wrong.
Draco grinned, obviously proud of his progress with the boy whilst Harry madly blushed. "But really, Harry. Are you feeling okay?" Hermione pondered anxiously. "To be honest with you, no. But I'm better than I was that night. It was something Ron said that triggered something in my head and pushed me over the edge. Literally, I suppose!" He laughed half heartedly but stopped, seeing everyone else's glares.
"I did ask. Now hurry up, my lips are lonely!" Harry whined and with another eye roll, Draco connected his lips with Harry's. Dean and Seamus cooed and Hermione smiled, almost crying with happiness. Her best friend was with someone he truly loved and she didn't see them ever breaking up. But then again, she didn't think her and Ron would break up so soon either. As much as what he did was absolutely foul and evil and UGH! She couldn't help but still feel the smallest sliver of love him.
"In the Muggle world, Harry, the encanta bond is a myth that is known as soulmates. It's extremely rare and hasn't been seen in thousands of years. And now, I think I've discovered why!" Hermione explained, picking up the newspaper clippings. "It was rumoured that Merlin had the encanta bond with someone, but it doesn't say who. And this paper, says that he was seen sharing 'affection' with a man. I think you can only share the encanta bond in very powerful same sex couples." She finished excitedly, leaving Harry and Draco gobsmacked.
MOST CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS AND THINGS BELONG TO J.K. ROWLING (However if you support her views and shit please go away <3)
"Look at you going all father-mode on me," Harry grinned. "I guess you could say I'm being a a good DOGfather! Get it? Dog, God, it's a play on words!" Sirius laughed, but Harry just stood there, shaking his head. "Your humour has died old man," Harry smirked and held in a laugh as Sirius put his hand to his heart in mock offense, but then he grinned.
If Harry had just died as a baby, none of them would be dead. Lily and James may as well have just given Harry to Voldemort when he came that night, and carried on with their lives.
"Wait, so you aren't gay anymore?" Ron asked, now purely confused. "I- I don't know. I've only ever had feelings for one boy and that was Malfoy, but now that's done and dusted... I just don't see anybody in that way anymore." Harry shrugged.
I'm never gonna let you go,
Of course, Anthony was cool and he was so much more chilled out than Mrs Weasley, so Ron listened to him. Ron learned wrong from right and did whatever Anthony told him to. Anthony was chased away by Mrs Weasley, though when she had saw him giving a seven year old some firewhiskey.
"Well, hopefully he was under the imperius curse, because I really don't think that I could handle another year of someone trying to kill me," Harry lightly chuckled. "I love this," Hermione smiled, her eyes watering slightly. "Love what?" Ron asked. "This," Hermione laughed. "Us three, just us three, having a nice conversation again without having to worry about horcruxes and almost dying. I mean, we were talking about Harry's love life! How often have we done that?"
"Is that true?" Harry asked. Draco nodded, then grinned. "I had my food brought to me like I was royalty. Felt right at home!" Harry chuckled awkwardly. He had forgotten that Malfoy had had an easy (ish) life, being treated like a prince every day. Draco Malfoy, the ice prince, sitting here with pathetic Potter who tried to kill himself.
"Um, thank you, I guess. Why did you write that letter to the ministry? Telling them not to put Mother in Azkaban?" Draco asked. He had been curious since they told them at his Mothers hearing. Lucius had already been taken to Azkaban by then. "She saved my life. When I went to the forbidden forest and Voldemort struck me with the curse, it didn't kill me, again. Your mother declared me dead when I told her you were alive. If she had said I wasn't dead, then I wouldn't be here today." Draco nodded again and started brushing his teeth.
Sirius wasn't exactly happy that out of all boys it was Draco Malfoy Harry chose, but he knew that with the way he looked at Harry, Draco would go to the world's end to protect him. Just like he would have done with Remus, if he wasn't such a wimp.
Hermione seemed to argue with it before it finally unleashed a scroll from it’s leg. She scanned it quickly before looking skeptically at Draco.
He did not want to have to move. And he’d already refused the Fidelius Charm; he didn’t want to put any of his friends into the dangerous position of being his secret keeper.
Once he was dressed, he took one of the man's towels and tried to pick up as much condensation from the walls as possible before replacing it. He stuck his wet clothes in a plastic bag before stuffing it into his pack. He walked towards the door in order to make a quick escape, only to have it swing open before him. And there stood the young man with the dark hair, in his fine clothes.
“Okay.”
“I broke into his house. I admit that. And… I wasn’t… under the influence of anything.” There was a quiet knock at the door. Another man in lime green robes entered. He introduced himself as Healer Roberts. And he spoke. But Draco had stopped listening. Nothing they said made sense. The whole world had turned upside down and he couldn’t understand anything they said to him. Eventually they both left. And Draco was left alone.
He refused to take any of the calming draught and wouldn’t let her close enough to put her hand on his shoulder.
“We were able to cleanse your body from the last of suppression potion.  Healer Roberts, our resident mind healer, was able to remove the mental blocks that were clouding your thinking.  He was quite fascinated and even had several students watch, purely for academic purposes of course.”
“He said his name… was Harry.”
“Draco, Harry seems to think you broke into his house on purpose. And he has some valid points. No— keep eating.” He’d tried to put his sandwich down. “The house is protected from …invaders. And actually most people can’t even see the house unless they’re looking for it.”
He walked alongside one of these buildings as he threw his invisibility cloak over his head.
they made it back, an unhelpful voice in the back of his mind supplied. He felt sore and weak, and being stranded without their wands didn't add to his optimism.
As his smile faltered, he attempted to change topics. "And why the backpack?" he asked, trying not to feel morose and failing.
Harry reached their table in few strides.
“What happened to him?” Harry asked at the sight of his scarred right eye. He had half ear missing too.
He looks at Potter. That’s probably what Granger did all the time.
He saw him squirm, shift in his seat and sweat. He even saw him blush.
important protective spell and didn't think it relevant enough to tell me."
Harry went to his flat and tucked himself in bed waiting for sleep to overtake him.
Once inside, the door closes with a soft click, and Draco snorts. “As if we couldn’t keep a door closed.”
He didn't bother with regulating the taps and the water was scalding; when he faced the mirror he was red all over. He tried to domesticate his hair for nearly 30 seconds, but even if he had the time he wouldn't achieved more than a "recently shagged" look (Ron's words, not his) so why bother, really. He had 4 minutes to get dressed and meet the others. He'll be on time just to piss the prat off.
“Who’s waiting with me, then?” Draco bellows back, nervous.
“Oh, that would be good!”
“I may even like you.”
Grey clouds loomed in the darkening sky, a biting cold wind licking at the back of Draco’s neck. It might snow later. Hopefully after their little excursion, when they were home in front of a warm fire — or at a pub, in Harry’s case.
“Hey,” Harry said, “you’re going to freeze to death if you stay still in this winter chill.”
He shifted until he found a comfortable position, ignoring Harry’s glance and regretting his past decisions. Kind of. Maybe a quieter career would have been more practical, but his good choices had made sense: enduring Auror training, abiding by the rules and working alongside the Ministry’s finest, using his magic — his
Once inside the resting room, Draco is unable to relax so he resolves to pick his book and distract himself. Liam is already napping, just in case the night, a Friday one, gets busy.
“I’m not a Hitwizard, not anymore, that is.”
They sipped in silence, Malfoy lost in thought and unaware of Harry observing him. It was understandable, really, that Malfoy liked his life here, wherever ‘here’ was. In all these years, Harry has seen him struggling, isolated… the only times he has seen him out of his shop or in another context outside his job-related interactions (and it’s true, it was always in interrogations) it didn’t go well. People didn’t treat him well; his surname still was a liability.
"A Lethifold."
It was 3 in the morning. Again.
“Shit.” Draco restrains himself from hitting his face with the palm of his hand, or with the nearest solid surface. How can he been so careless?
“If we go back, would you keep talking with me?”
Draco snorts, a strange feeling bubbling in his chest. He’s still nervous, but the irrational fear is no longer there.
And other things he didn’t dare to even put into words in his own head.
Ah, that's kind of easy. "Uhm, that would cost you at least a medium sized box of chocolates from Prestat."
Potter thumped down in a chair. "Say something."
The man pulled his scarf down and snarled at him. "Watch out, you idiot!"
“Yes, for a while. He moved to Hogwarts before Ginny stayed with me. He’s going to be a teacher.” She beams.
. Why would he…? Should he ask if…?
“I thought the Malfoys were still wealthy enough to not need to work, even after the trials and that stuff.”
Draco waved his hand in the general direction of his body, from his head to his toes and all the parts in between. It was easier to tell where it didn't hurt, actually.
They shared a look of confusion and held their wands up, Draco with a stunning spell on the tip of his tongue. Better safe than sorry, he thought. The footprints continued deep into the forest and up to the top of a gentle slope. There, in a clearing covered with purple vines, a tower stood, menacing and imposing.
“I-I thought you were together?” he frowns, he thinks he remembers her saying so.
Potter raised his thick eyebrows and said, smugly, "Nobody messes with my partner."
Potter’s smile remains. “That bad?”
“God Potter, you know how to pique my interest.”
Draco sputters ungracefully, and that seems enough to wake Liam completely.
"Dray, we got another call."
Draco could imagine Head Auror Robards’ recriminatory words when they made it back.
Draco tossed up his hands. "I would have got verbal admonition and maybe a couple weeks of community service! That was all! But
Draco stared at him. That was a first. He raised his nose and basked in Potter’s admission of inadequacy. “Well, you’re stuck with me. Lucky you, I have a brain.”
“Did I?” the idiot asked fooling no one.
When he rose from the table, a paper crane landed on his plate. He picked it up, knowing full well who it was from. He read the note inside with a bit of annoyance.
“Is he?”
“Potter!”
But he wouldn't, right? He might not hold him in high regard but he testified in his and his mother’s favour, so there is that. Surely his Gryffindor pride wouldn't let him do something hurtful or stupid…
“I'm so sorry.”
Harry sat up in his bed, startled.
At around ten o’clock in the morning on his first day off, Draco is standing in front of the table in his potion lab after doing some research. Namely, a four hour research, with a pause for coffee. It is not that he has specifically gotten up early to do this, it is just that his shifts have conditioned him to wake up at the same time, everyday, no matter if he has work or not.
“I almost got sorted into Slytherin,” he says with a mischievous grin.
Harry looked down and his stomach fluttered when he saw Draco through the lit up window. He tried to catch his attention but Draco wasn’t looking up and he soon moved away from the window.
Harry glared at his back for a good couple of minutes before rushing to the showers. Totally worth it.
Draco sits in the driver seat and isn’t conscious of his lack of nerves until they arrive at the hospital and leave the man in hands of the emergency doctors. He has made it. He has driven throughout London without thinking about what could go wrong, just wanting to bring his patient to safety.
He struggled with his underwear, struggled with his shirt and when he struggled with his trousers he paused and narrowed his eyes. Did he grabbed the wrong set of clothing? He shook his head. Who's else's clothes would be?
"Er..."
"Can you believe it?" she asked their involuntary audience. “He can't cast a
“I couldn’t sleep. It seems neither could you.”
“Is this how it’s going to be?”
“Katie.”
-o-o-
“For the love of Merlin, could you lot please be silent?” Harry turned to the voice. There it was the git, peering from the other side of the partition curtain, trying to maintain his dignity in a hospital gown. Harry jumped forward and hold him in a tight embrace.
"You were going to call your nephew," Draco answers.
“I’ll tell you if you tell me,” he says straight faced.
“Whatever.” Draco closed his eyes again, too weak to argue properly. He didn't want to argue at all, not really, but bickering with Harry prevented Draco from succumbing to paralyzing fear. He hadn’t felt so helpless since the trials, when the Wizengamot refused to give him his wand back before they got a verdict. And Salazar, they took their time.
"Exercise."
“Oh, yes, sure, of course!”
Draco looks at Potter, and a sudden sense of mutual understanding startles him. The sunset light might be tricking his mind because he is certain that Potter's eyes weren't so green before. Or his brain might be muddled because he doesn't find the glasses so ghastly. Then, the git speaks and the mirage breaks.
His partner Edith Solomon stormed into the Auror Office like an erumpent in a china shop.
Draco stares, cup held in mid air, her words resonating in his head as if blared with a
“You have been talking to him.”
Potter shakes his head. “They didn't talk about it, actually. Not until I got my letter from Hogwarts. How do we do this?" he asks, changing the subject.
“Mr Potter, you certainly carry the strength of your ancestors.” She paused, looking at him in the eyes. “And the capacity of love from your mother’s lineage.”
When the emergency call comes, Draco is surprised that he hasn’t got to guide Potter’s actions, until he understands that this part is similar to when hitwizards are called to a crime scene, or whatever it is they do on a daily basis.
Draco watches as Potter checks around them and then winks at him before he
"You can do something for everyone who is still here."
Life is a mix of waiting and chaos. At least Draco's life is.
"Oh, er, I'm Harry."
"It would have been in about 50 minutes if some idiot wouldn't have ignored me."
“Can you keep a secret? Well, I suppose you can, given your history but, would you keep a secret? For me? I mean is not a big deal, it’s just… it’s...”
"Infuriating."
"Maybe he's just happy," Hermione suggested.
Draco nodded minutely. "I suppose that may be the case, his condition was severe, and enough time hasn't passed for him to be considered out of danger, even if he's stable. Muggle medicine takes its time, but I assure you, it's effective. And that, coming from me, should be enough reassurance." Potter’s smile is tiny but is there. "Are you so in debt with them that you can't wait to see how it goes?" Draco says, frowning.
And cold, he was terribly cold.
Harry frowned and pursed his lips. Draco watched with a strange sense of detachment. “That bad?” he asked, swaying on the spot.
"I wouldn't expect any less." His smile is bright and his eyes are shining, though, so Draco hasn’t done so bad.
Draco sighed. “Not really. I’m not a people person at 3 A.M. in the morning.”
Waiting and chaos and traffic related nightmares.
“In a muggle university.”
"It wouldn't be the first time that the confidant lied."
“I may even share it with Ron.”
“Then I don’t want to wake up.” He murmured.
“That's brilliant!”
"Really?"
Potter groans. "That's the other reason why Hermione is mad at me. She says I owe them nothing."
"And how did you get the job?" he says with something akin to suspicion.
"And whose fault is that?"
“Harry!" Ron burst into the guard followed by a flustered healer and a smiling Hermione. "We heard you had come to your senses!"
“What then?”
Last he heard about Potter, he was being considered for a promotion in the DMLE. He could have the whole department sniffing his trail, looking for a faux pas… Like him cheating on his driving exam…
“Mmmm, maybe not, but I wanted you in my life, that’s for sure.” Harry embraces him, trapping him against the counter. The kiss doesn’t come, though, and Draco huffs, frustrated. “Wait, no, that may have happened earlier.” Harry adds.
"Let's try some antidotes," she said, spiking Draco’s drink just before he returned.
"Nah, I borrowed it. My transfigurations don't hold for long."
Draco scoffed. "I'm not going to wear some weird amulet from Granger. It would probably hex my bollocks off."
Draco couldn't help the spread of his smile while his rather brilliant partner explained his plan.
On Wednesday Harry left work late again. He definitely should look for another job, this one wasn’t his thing. He looked at his watch; on the bright side, he probably would find Draco taking a walk with Scarhead and could talk a bit with him before crashing on bed. Until the cursed hour when he would inevitably wake up, that is.
The prat has the nerve to scoff. "No, really, what are you doing?"
"Hey."
-o-o-
“Do you think that he would forgive me? That we could forgive each other?” he says softly. Because he realises right then that for all his actions, all his attempts at having a new life, a normal life, without the scorn, and the hate, and the guilt… All his efforts at leaving the past behind are wasted if he doesn’t mend the wound in his very core. A wound that Potter and himself put right there.
“You should have warned me!” Edith yelled from inside the room, like she expected Draco to follow her. Which he did, out of need to defend himself. “You jeopardized the whole mission!”
"Ever so charming," Harry muttered. If Malfoy heard him he surely chose to ignore him. "What do you want, Malfoy?"
Draco stops again, and Potter collides with him, leaving his glasses askew for a second before the stupid moron can compose himself. He finds satisfactory the fact that, even now that Potter looks way healthier and sturdier than back in the day, Draco is still the taller of the two. Not for much, but still.
“Wake up, please, wake up.”
“Wow.” Draco feels the heat creep in his cheeks at that. “That’s..”
"The healers were at a loss," Hermione said, earning a glare from the healer present in the room, “They said that it was like you weren't really here, which is nonsense, really. There were some travel spells written on the floor but it was obvious they weren't activated in the explosion. We feared some substances were interfering, and you wouldn't wake up, but…"
“And it’s technically true but… the thing is… I got my driver's license in a… non exactly regulated way.” Draco looks at Potter, waiting for his reaction.
"Where?"
and whatever, and he said he didn’t know them, and then, he was inexplicably kidnapped and forced to sit for hours in front on a smaller screen than the one that time in Anatomy class (thank Merlin), with  something resembling food and beverages, and was utterly confused when he realised that they must have adopted him as the weird friend who should be educated in
Blimey.
"Chocolate," Malfoy said offering Harry the mug.
“I guessed that much, you grew with them after all, didn’t you? Why haven't you asked Granger?”
"I often find that those aren't mutually exclusive."
Draco hummed.
After a moment of silence Draco burst laughing, “Who is the Slytherin of the two?”
It was then his turn to blush.
“That's what friends do, silly.”
lumos
Draco flushed. “I… don’t know where that came from, honest.”
Saturdays are one of the busiest nights of the week, close after Fridays, so working both nights in a row leaves Draco knackered. He changes slowly and walks at a leisurely pace to the exit, wondering if he should stop to buy some groceries on the way home or go home directly to crash on his bed, when he notices him: an unmistakable, blond, obese man with a big moustache, smoking at the hospital door.
"Stop right there."
It’s impressive how Harry has put all this effort in what seemed a crazy idea at first, a spur of the moment resolution that would dissolve with time. But he was wrong, and Harry is officially an EMT trainee.
"Robards, that's ridiculous!" Potter yelled, his deep voice carrying all the way down the corridor that led to the Head Auror's office.
“Coffee or tea?” Draco asked. “I’m going to make myself a hot chocolate.”
“I don’t know, I found him like this only some days ago. But if I had known he was going to be this problematic, I would have left him where I found him.”
He couldn't remember when he started favouring it, but the first night he woke up covered in sweat wondering where he was and feeling like he was intruding in his own flat, he could only think about how he'd sold his soul for a mug of hot dark cocoa. So that night he put his coat over his pyjamas, wrapped his scarf around his neck and trotted down the stairs and out to the street. It was freezing, and the streets were deserted.
“Mhm,” she confirms, picking delicately at a warm scone.
Harry flushed bright red. He held his face in his hands. Oh god, what was he, a teenager?
“Let me see,” Harry murmured.
The woman startles and stops sniveling, having something to focus on.
He walked all the way back to the castle cursing under his breath and pausing every other step to accommodate himself in his too tight trousers.
“What’s wrong?” Potter says putting a hand on his elbow.
A weak bubble of laughter caught in his throat. He groaned. "We are a pair of idiots.”
Ron groaned.
"Yeah, but that's not the weird thing," Harry said.
"Potter!" Malfoy yelled behind him a moment later.
Draco looked at him with a frown. “Would you care?”
"Potter,” he sighs, the adrenaline rush has subsided and leaves him exhausted, he doesn’t have the energy for this, “it's your saviour complex talking, and maybe some hormone induced high thing. People can die, and knowing you, you'll feel responsible."
“I’m going the cherish this memory.”
Potter smiles, and Draco thinks that maybe it wasn’t a mirage at all, and maybe it wasn’t suspicion what tinged Potter words. It’s definitely not suspicion now. “You studied for, what? Three years in a muggle university? All to get a degree and apply for a work in a muggle hospital?” It’s close to wonder. And admiration. And Draco doesn’t know what to do with that. Not coming from Potter, anyway. So he does what he never does: downplay it.
The alarm pierces the air, breaking the silence that has settled in. Draco startles and mumbles an apology while he stands and all but runs towards the lab. If Luna sees him brushing off some traitorous tears, she doesn't say anything when she sits on a stool next to him and watches while he works on the potion.
“What's wrong?” he mumbled
And then Potter's expression changes to one of surprise. "Did you feel something?" Draco asks, eager.
Draco eyed him sideways. Nothing was simple with
Draco drank, frowned and glowered. It was a change. Harry doubted if a good one.
“Bugger!”
Harry narrowed his eyes. "And you knew where to find me?"
"No, listen, listen, I can drive them here and you can patch them up, it would be like team work. By the time I’ll finish my studies you'll be a doctor, right?"
Their destination is a neighbourhood full of old houses, where an apparently faulty gas installation has blown up. The firemen are already on their way, and they expect two injured people: an old man and his neighbour, who has made the call. Besides them, another ambulance has been called just in case.
"You think it's a trap?” Draco asked, voice wavering at the end.
“He’s… that affected by his cousin’s accident?”
“Well, I only told the truth.” He says, looking at him in the eyes as if daring Draco to contradict him.
He asks the other thing that is nagging him, though. “Then why does he wants to help them?”
“Three years and a half, actually. The first semester was a disaster.” he mutters scuffing a broken tile with his foot.
“Do you know what time is it?” Draco asked.
“Er, uhm, no, he is healthy, he does exercise. He’s in really good shape, my Diddy. Since he and his cousin…” she trails off, “H-he’s never broken a bone.” She bursts into uncontrollable tears. “Oh my poor boy, my poor Dudleykins, Look at you.”
“Ok,” he says so faintly that he’s sure Carl haven’t heard him. He starts to feel the panic as he watches the ambulance drive away. “Shit. Shit, shit, shit.”
With a groan, he got up when the alarm went off for a second time and rushed through his morning routine. He managed to exit the flat in record time, his toast still in his mouth. He was so distracted looking for his car key that he didn’t see the man standing on the sidewalk, waiting for his dog to stop sniffling the lamppost suspiciously.
Draco jumps out of his skin. Is he hearing voices, now?
“You couldn’t have decided you wanted me to live with you that night,” Draco says, his head tilted, his hands holding his cup under his nose, hiding his smile.
"What?" Draco frowns, confused.
Potter’s uncle snorts. “Mind your own business, boy.”
"It's the nerve! Years of ignoring me on the best of days, making it clear that I’m not part of the family, and now asking…" Potter closes his eyes and stresses his next words, "demanding, actually, I do something."
He jumps on the spot, his hands outstretched. "Listen, this is brilliant, I can help people, I can…"
Draco’s expression looked pained. His eyes searched Harry’s before he lowered and fixed his stare on his polished shoes. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to tell something but closed it before he could voice his thoughts.
"Potter." Harry turned his head towards the familiar voice.
? And if that's easy for you, when you finish, maybe you can cast a wandless Patronus and get us some help.”
"That's it."
“Has he been talking about me?” he blurts before he can stop his blasted big mouth. He has to control his impulsivity around Potter. Or when talking about him. Or when thinking about him too, as last night. Damn.
Harry woke up startled. The feeling of being in the wrong place swamped his brain and his senses again.
Malfoy scoffed. “It’s rented. And my benefits go with the abusive price the owner rises now and then. Lucky no one else wants to rent me their place, otherwise, I would have told him to fuck off.”
Potter snorts. “With you? There’s always a reason.”
“You did take the blow directly and fall from a height,” Harry admitted.
But, at that moment Potter’s gaze bore a hole in his pride and, as it had many times before, left Draco feeling inadequate.
“Shut up. It worked before.”
Draco groaned and dragged his feet on the floor until he reached the sofa and let himself drop ungracefully on it. Then, he rested his elbows on his knees and put his head on his hands, messing his hair.
Draco goes back to the resting room, deflated, and finds Liam and Carl there. He doesn’t want to talk to any of them so he picks up his book and tells them he’s going to wait outside for the next call.
Harry sighed, resigned to another bad night, and stood up. He decided that he wanted a hot chocolate. It probably wouldn't help with his insomnia, but at least, he would enjoy it.
“Are you really trying?” Draco asked.
They ended sitting on the sofa, talking and making plans in case the thing didn’t really wear off.
"If you, punk, do something that hurts my son, I'll see you in court."
“Please don’t let yourself be impressed by my parents’ taste in decoration.”
Draco spins on the spot, his eyes wide in shock. “How come?”
"I want to do what you're doing."
The thin woman at his side is in full rant while fussing nervously with her cardigan.
“I mean, it’s small and cramped with stuff but… it’s something you can call your own.”
“I… had to run to get to work on time. Are you sure you’re not angry with me?”
“Right, right. No, he's just allergic to cats."
The mugs clinked and Malfoy turned to look at him but kept silent.
“No offence but you look knackered.”
“That was a weird dream.” He tried to calm himself, tried to make sense of the images that plagued his brain. And then it clicked: a sense of rightness, of belonging. “I’m Harry Potter and I’m a wizard,” he breathed.
Draco’s eyelids fluttered, but refused to comply. He wanted to rest, but the urgency in Harry’s voice prompted him to make the effort.
"And you hexed him."
"Very well," Robards said, his tone dangerous. Draco wished that he didn’t fear expulsion from the MLE for attacking a fellow Auror. Otherwise, a fist in Harry’s face ought to shut him up. "Two weeks of suspension of work and salary! Both of you!"
"But Hermione, do you really need all the details?"
"What for?" Harry grunted.
“Harry?” He turned and saw Draco looking up, frowning.
Draco helps her sit and fasten the belt before knocking on the dividing panel. “Off you go!” As his partner was ready waiting for him, the ambulance jerks forward right away, the loud siren blaring as they ride as fast as possible through London’s streets.
Potter scowled and crossed his arms.
"I would invite you to sit but this is a public space so do what you want. Actually," he says closing his book, "please sit down, you are making me nervous, stalking me in silence from above."
It was Friday, so he arrived home late in the afternoon, after a couple of beers with his peers. He looked at his watch and then up to the windows he supposed was Draco’s flat. Was it too late to say hello and thank him in person? It probably was. There weren’t any lights on the second floor.
Harry frowned. He raised his hand to touch Malfoy’s back but stopped halfway. He suspected Malfoy didn’t want his pity.
Anyway, sometimes the comfort of his magic is enough to reassure him that he’s not going to muck it up with one of his patients.
"I surprisingly agree."
Draco turned to look at the guarded house, mostly to hide his blush. It was true, he knew Potter wasn't stupid, but he wouldn't admit it out loud, lest it go to Potter’s head. Or worse, Potter would think he had Draco's respect.
Dangerous animals aside, he guess it is. “And is Longbottom going with you?”
"Oooh, too much information, mate!"
“Oh no, he’s worried about him, but it’s just… It’s not a recent thing.” She pauses. “Do you think a person may be hurting so much that they can be unable to remember how they were?” she asks, her gaze unfocused when she continues. “I think they can.”
and he answered that he hadn’t talked with them lately, and then they said they meant
Draco spoke, soft and low, but so close to Harry's ear that he heard him anyway.
"Er, that wasn't weird either, well, it's kind of a novelty, but we'd talked about blo—"
“Then I would suggest making yourself comfortable because I don’t know if there is magic or not in this reality; or even if there is if we could find some help.”
Shortly after that, they arrive at the emergency door, and Draco settles into the routine of taking the patient out of the ambulance and to the emergency ward, the pattern already ingrained in his subconscious. He almost falters when he sees him, unmistakable with his glasses and his black bad hair and his scar, but he forces himself to walk through, grateful to the doctor that comes to take care of his patient. Of course, that woman had been speaking to a ‘Harry’, but what were the odds? It’s a very common name. It’s just Draco’s luck that he has to attend Potter’s muggle relative. His only relatives, if he recalls correctly.
Harry became quite flustered at this gesture and was unsure what to do. "You place your hands on my waist," Draco whispered. Harry did as he was told and everything seemed in place for once.

They walked along side the Black Lake and sat under a small cave Harry had no idea was there. "How long has this been here?" Harry asked, lying down on his back, his head poking out of the cave entrance so he could still see the stars. Draco copied his actions and lay down just like Harry had.
Ginny told Hermione and Draco about Luna and her dating her, and the situation with Neville. "But, it's not like Harry and me, you see. Neville actually thinks that him and Luna are dating so he asked her to the party and she said yes. I'm afraid that Luna is going to eventually break up with me for him. The Ravenclaw common room was destroyed and they haven't finished repairing it yet so they're meant to be bunking with us but Luna seems to be spending more nights here than with me," Ginny said as Hermione hugged her.
"Harry, are you alright? How are you feeling! Has Madame Pomfrey checked up on you, I can do it if you want I know all the spells-" Harry laughed at Hermione and she turned light pink.
Harry lay down in his bed, hoping for sleep to come but it never did. Harry spent all night, painfully tossing and turning, but couldn't get the images of death and destruction out of his mind. He so badly wanted to talk to Ron or Hermione, but they probably hated him by now. All the Weasley's probably hated him. You killed Fred. He thought to himself.

'so maybe this was meant to be,
"Well if it isn't the happy couple," a voice sneered from the other side of the tree. Harry and Draco jumped apart and looked up. "You just love to hide behind trees and spy on your students, don't you Barton?" Harry snarled.
The door behind him opened, and Draco appeared. "Defence? Me too. Lets go."
"Why've you done all this for me Draco?" Harry asked, taking a small bite of his ham sandwich. "I realised, after all we have been through, we've never really been on a proper date! And it's not like we can just walk into hogsmeade together." Draco shrugged, rolling his eyes.
It was seven in the evening and Ron announced he was going back to school, and stepped through the floo. He tried to do it rather hastily, as his mother got over excited and emotional at 'her baby finally getting some sense into him'. When Ron fell out of McGonogall's fireplace and saw that the office was empty, he made a run for it, all the way up to eighth year tower. He dropped his trunk by an abandoned sofa and ran straight towards room number seven.
Draco's eyes welled up as they ran along the long winding corridors towards the hospital wing. The castled seemed empty as everybody was still gathered in the Great Hall partying. 'Harry wouldn't have wanted the publicity anyway' Draco thought to himself.
They danced to a couple of songs, before departing from the crowd, greeting various people together along the way and headed to the bathrooms where they split up to change.
"Sorry, he's really drunk!" Hermione exclaimed, jumping up. "Whaaaaatt? No I'm not, stop being a silly potato you bushy haired... Thing!" Harry laughed, almost toppling over before Ginny got up and caught him. "Ginnyyyy!" Harry gasped. "You were my girlfriend!"
But, as he walked towards room number 7, he couldn't help but wonder what it would be like for two boys to kiss. Would it just be like kissing a girl? Or would it be more gentle, more rough? Harry walked straight into the bathroom, thoughts still roaming around his head. He opened the shower door and heard a shout that knocked him out of his thoughts.
"Maybe this will jog your memory," Draco smirked and softly grabbed Harry's cheeks, pulling him into a kiss. It was very dramatic, but the boys enjoyed it immensely, being able to kiss in the common room whilst other people were there.
"I'm sorry, but I just don't approve of my son dating a boy, let alone a Malfoy!" Draco almost collapsed. And he would've if he didn't have an overwhelming urge to shout. "Okay, look, I don't care that you are my boyfriends father and you're just as famous as he is and whatever, but you do NOT get to talk about him like that! Harry can make his own choices without Daddy protecting him and I'm afraid there's nothing you can do about that! So either deal with it and love your son for who he is, or go away." He growled, and Mr Potter looked taken aback.
"Uh, hi Harry. Draco?" She said, watching the two of them. "Can I talk to you please Harry?" She asked. Harry nodded his head and dried his hands. With a quick glance back at Malfoy, Harry walked out with Hermione. "Are you okay Harry? I mean, really. You've seemed really off. We haven't done anything, have we?" She asked.
"We walked in on him playing in third year. He stopped as soon as he saw us though, so we never really heard anything and didn't press the matter," Dean shrugged. Harry wobbled back out, almost tripping over multiple rugs and foot stalls and table legs, saying sorry to each of them.
Harry wrapped his arms around his chest, conscious of the other boy, staring at him, jaw open wide. "Potter, tell me who did this to you? Was it someone at school? Tell me now Potter!" He growled. Harry grabbed his clothes and ran for the bathroom. He shakily got changed and then slid down the wall, cowering in the corner. Tears slid down his face, recollecting the events of what happened at number 4 privet drive and the incident with his now apparent roommate.
Harry was laid down and Madame Pomfrey fixed his wound. In the Muggle world, she said he would've needed these things called stitches and possibly even surgery. It was really bad.
The week went a lot quicker than Harry's Monday morning, and soon he, Ron and Hermione were all sitting on Ron's bed on a Sunday evening, catching up with each other. Even though Harry was speaking with his two best friends again, he still couldn't get rid of that nagging feeling of guilt. He kept quiet for a while and let Ron ramble on. "Mum's a state. Was her first time getting out of bed to drop us off at the train. We had to call Hermione over to help Ginny cook, because none of us had a hope in hell." Ron chuckled, putting his hand on Hermione's leg.
The images of the small family faded away and were now replaced by a wedding ceremony. A bride with a waterfall of red hair and dazzling dress stood opposite a handsome man who had somewhat managed to make his hair to all go in one direction. Sirius stood beside James whilst Remus and Peter sat in the front row. "She's so beautiful." Harry whispered as Lily Evans- soon to be Potter, recited her vows.
I'm too far deep to sing my song to you. This is my never love, never love for you.'
His hair started with black at the roots, then slowly turned blue toward the bottom, but still in his curly mess. His eyes were a deep voilet, matching Draco's eyes. They looked at each other and grinned, then burst out laughing. It was the first time Harry had laughed properly since the war. He was happy, and it was all thanks to the boy stood in front of him.
The six Gryffindors and one Slytherin sat down on the floor, taking advantage of an empty common room. "I'll go first, I'm the bestest!" Harry slurred and grabbed the bottle. He spun it, but then cast a silent spell with his wand up his sleeve so it would land on who he wanted.
"Draco what are you doing?" Harry gasped at the sudden force on the back of his neck. Repeat after me. You are filthy scum and I want nothing to do with you!  "You are filthy scum and I want nothing to do with you," Draco repeated, Pansy's own disgust at the relationship edging into his voice. "W-what?" Harry choked, eyes widening at the sudden confession. "I hate you, I always have. I just wanted to make a fool out of you, and it worked. I'm in love with Pansy, I always have been! You are just some disgusting piece of food on the side of my plate and I decided to play with you before finally chucking you to the dogs." Draco repeated carefully, unable to control himself despite the voice banging pleadingly in the back of his mind.
Harry could hear everything that Draco said to him. He wanted to reply, but he couldn't, his body wouldn't let him. What had happened? Why was he in an uncomfortable bed with Draco by his side telling him to wake up? What in the name of Merlin was going on?
The next morning, Harry and Draco walked down to breakfast separately and sat on opposite ends of the table. Barton was sat with the rest of the teachers, a taunting smile set on his face.
"NO!" Draco screamed and threw his wand to the floor. Draco looked up at the raven haired boy who was still standing with his eyes closed and arms opened wide, ready to welcome death. "Harry?" Draco whispered.
Just as he thought this, Madame Pomfrey came in and headed straight for him. "Glad to see you're eating Mr Potter," she smiled and gave Harry all his daily potions. He swallowed the disgusting ones first, just like he always did and gulped the decent ones last.
"Actually, as per usual, Granger is right," A voice came from the doorway. The trio looked around and saw no other than Draco Malfoy at the door. "What are you doing here?" Ron snarled. "Your door was open genius. I came over to close it. Nobody in the common room wants to hear about Potter and the Weaslette's relationship," Draco said, rolling his eyes. Harry's eyes widened and he rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly.
As Petunia continued her tale, there was no sign of forgiveness in her sister's eyes. "I'll see you later for Sirius's trial, Harry." Lily said solemnly and then disappeared. Petunia sat down on the dusty sofa and sighed, putting her face in her hands. "I'm sorry," Harry frowned. "What for?" Petunia replied, looking up at her nephew. "For being such a nuisance, for being just another annoyingly buzzing around your home, unwanted."
Harry took the bottle and just turned it to Draco. He didn't even bother to use magic this time. "Harry, that isn't how you-" but the rest of Draco's sentence was muffled by Harry's hand over his mouth. "Truth or dare, Ferret?" Harry grinned, drawing his hand back.
"Good," Hermione sniffled, wiping away her tears. "I talked to Ron earlier," Harry said, changing the subject and putting his shirt back on. "Asked him what he would do if I turned out to be gay. He said he'd never want to see me again. He said he'd want me to get out of his life and basically come back once I'd learned to be 'normal'. Or you know, just kill myself." He sighed, rolling his eyes.
"It's alright. I love you and Mum so much, I wish I could've grown up with you. In our home. With a loving family!" Harry cried. Sirius and Remus both came over and Sirius wrapped his arm around Harry, giving him the comfort his father couldn't. "Your going to give a family the love we were never able to give you, Harry." A female voice appeared.
"Not that." Said Sirius sharply as Harry took a small bite. "I can't believe your back, Sirius. We all thought that... Well, how?" Hermione smiled, interrupting the awkward silence. "I'll explain later. Harry, why don't you go and get Ginny. She is your girlfriend after all you should be eating with her. You have to get past the just kissing stage at some point!" Sirius winked, and Harry, and Draco who was listening in on their conversation, choked and almost spat out their drinks.
Harry didn't care anymore, in fact he had gotten used to not eating so much, he didn't even want to when he could. Through the break, Harry's beatings just got worse and worse. He could hide during the days seems as Dudley had school and Vernon had work, so it was just him and Petunia, but Harry just did his chores then stayed in his room.
"Who are you taking to the party Harry?" Hermione asked. "We have to take dates? Ugh, this is just a repeat of fourth year." Harry laughed. "Maybe you could take Draco!" Hermione giggled, winking at Harry. "Hermione!" Harry growled, joining in with the laughter.
Draco and Harry showed Ginny and Hermione their disguises and they just burst into hysterics, especially after Hermione gave Draco some boobs. "I am not wearing these!" Draco said in disgust and took them away. "They were a nice firm pair though, the kind you just want to squeeze, you know," Ginny said matter-of-factly. Everyone stared at her as she turned beet red. "Right, I'm the only person in here who likes girls." She laughed.
But it was empty. He ran over to the window and saw some blonde hair walking past the lake. Wherever Harry was, Malfoy probably knew. Ron slightly gagged at the thought of the two boys together but headed out none the less.
They sat next to a couple of Ravenclaws and Harry picked up a couple of grapes. He thought about what Malfoy would say if he was there. In fact, he wouldn't say anything, just pile food onto Harry's plate. Thinking about it now, where was Draco? Harry hadn't seen him since he kind of outed himself last night.

"Oh my gosh," Harry gasped as Draco stepped out from behind a tree. "Did you do all this?" He asked, looking around. "Not even any help from the House Elves." Draco grinned.
"Woah, Harry, slow down!" Draco laughed. "My middle name is, unfortunately, Lucius. My favourite spell is the summoning charm. My birthday is 5th June. If you really need to know, Harry I've never... You know, with a boy but I have with girls. And I've never been able to cast a patronus. Growing up with my Father, I didn't have too many happy memories," he admitted sheepishly.
"I'm fine, Draco, really," Harry pleaded, trying to calm him down before someone comes in wondering what all the shouting is about. "Fine? FINE?" Draco shouted more, now seething at anger. Harry wasn't even sure who it was directed to anymore. "You are clearly not fine Potter. You look like death!"
"Is it true, that you! Mr Malfoy, have a secret sketch book where you draw your most innermost inny desires?" Harry giggled. "What? How did you know about that?" Draco gasped. "The only person I've ever told is Blai- oh. Curse that stupid Italian!"
"-I'm sorry Gin!" Ron shouted. "I really am. I don't know what came over me, and we're working on it!" He sighed. "Working on it isn't enough. Come and find me when you've learned how to pull your head out of your arse and see the world for what it really is. Come and find me, when you're my brother again and not some imposter who thinks one witch or wizard isn't equal to another because of who they love." Ginny snarled, then walked out of the portrait hole.
But, neither of them could even get into bed. "Let's go for a walk. Neither of us are going to be going to sleep very soon anyway." Draco nodded and lead Harry out of their dorm room and through the winding corridors of the castle. It was of course, empty, seeing as it was quite late at night so Harry took his chances and grabbed Draco's hand. Draco looked to his side and smiled, leading Harry out of the entrance hall and into the castle grounds.
Ron looked sympathetic, before realising why they were there in the first place. "Do me a favour? Take this and finish the job. You don't belong here." He spat, chucked something in Harry's hands. Harry looked down to see a shiny, silver blade.
Hermione and Ron never came back, so when the Hogwarts Express pulled up to Hogsmeade station, Harry collected his things and walked off on his own. He got in a carriage with a couple of 3rd years, who seemed to try and sit as far away from him as possible. Everyone filed into the Great Hall, sitting at their houses tables.
Harry lay there as he received slaps, punches and kicks from his uncle, and only did Vernon stop when Dudley called up saying he was hungry. "Go and make dinner you little shit." He spat and stomped out. Harry lay on his floor, aching. At least, this time nothing felt broken, just bruised. He limped down the steps and into the kitchen. Harry turned the grill on and put pork chops in there whilst chopping up potatoes. He went into deep thought about what he was going to do next. He didn't have any muggle money, so couldn't buy an apartment anywhere, after the war, he didn't particularly want to be an auror anymore.
"Thank You, Draco," Harry smiled, looking at the pale boy, his eyes lingering down to his torso again. "Like what you see, Potter?" Draco smirked. "Meh," Harry grinned cheekily. "Oh, really? What about when I move close to you and your breath catches and your heart starts racing?" He whispered, moving towards Harry who was backing up against the wall.
"Uh... Harry?" Hermione said. "What?" He snapped. He couldn't be bothered to put up with another lecture about how he needed to eat more. "You growled Harry. As in, an animal growl!" Harry thought back for a moment, and realised that he had done exactly that!
"Did you, Sirius Oreon Black, murder thirteen persons after betraying James and Lily Potter by selling them out to the Dark Lord?" Fudge asked, an evil twinkle in his eyes. "No, I did not. That was in fact Peter Pettigrew, who is now also dead by his own hand." Sirius replied solemnly.
Carved into the wall were the words 'Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs- together until humanity ends.' Harry looked to see Sirius wiping away a tear. Without thinking, Harry wrapped him in a hug and knew that his Dad was thanking him, wherever he was, for giving his best friend the comfort he needed.
"POTTER! What are you doing, close the door!" Draco shouted stark naked, hands covering his gentle area. But Harry noticed multiple scars along Malfoy's chest and thought back to earlier in the week. "I did that," Harry said blankly. Draco noticed what Harry was looking at and attempted to cover his chest. "I'm a monster." Harry said, the guilt rushing to his head. "You are not a monster, Harry, you didn't know what the spell did. I started the fight anyway. Now, if you please, shut the damn door!"
"A bit late, Potter," Draco whispered as Barton turned around to write notes on the chalkboard. Harry looked at Draco and studied his face, his smile. He had a cute dimple where his smirk went up and perfect plush lips. "You done staring, Potter?" He asked, his smirk growing larger. Harry looked down at his desk as he blushed. "Shove off, Malfoy. We all know you're a little faggot." Ron snapped. Harry drew his head up quickly and looked at Ron confused. "Wait, what?"
It was true. Ron and Harry had been through thick and thin, had fought by each others side for almost 8 years. "Do you wanna call truce mate? Forget everything we said in the bedroom. We both said really stupid things, me mainly. You should know none of us blame you for what happened. I'm sorry mate." Ron sighed, holding his hand out. "I'm sorry too." Harry said, and shook Ron's hand. They smiled at each other and continued the lesson in a much happier mood.
Malfoy hunched over the counter, his back to Harry, his expression hidden.
“What?” Draco asked.
Draco smiled against his will. He didn't voice his gratitude. He didn't even admit to himself that he thought, deep down, that he had acquired a better partner out of the debacle with Edith Solomon.
Draco crosses his arms, he can't avoid sounding defensive. "What? Do you think I've confounded all these muggles?" he says through gritted teeth, his blood rapidly boiling. He waits, expecting some retort from Potter, some venom in his words, it's what they do best; but he doesn't have the chance to listen to Potter's answer because Carl comes jogging.
Harry peered at him through half-closed eyelids. “‘Course. What kind of question is that?”
He only stopped his teasing when Parkinson entered the common room and shouted: "Sweet Salazar, Potter! Where did you hide those muscles?"
She looks suddenly sad and moves her head in affirmative. He stares, itching to ask for more, but he isn’t sure he wants to know any details.
,” Harry muttered, shaking his hands in front of him where a solitary log lay, his broken wand resting between them.
Harry blinked, did Malfoy...? Did he just…?
"If you're going to expediently sanction Malfoy, you should sanction me, too!"
Draco shrugged again. “Don’t mind me, I’m a bit defensive, that’s all,” he muttered. “Would you mind a cuppa? For the karmic equilibrium.”
"Potter, that was wishful thinking on my part, I won't be able to…"
“Hey.” Draco tries to show a reassuring smile, but he suspects he doesn’t really manage. He’s nervous too, but not for the same reasons, probably. He hands him a small package, the manila paper neatly folded over a wooden box with two phials inside. “Here it is, two doses as promised.”
Harry tossed aside the sticks and branches he collected from outside, peeling off his drenched robes and sitting in front of the lonely flame. Draco struggled to sit upright and do the same.
"Something about me missing Neville's rant tonight at the pub — about the correct way to recollect wolfsbane blossoms or something — only because of us being in mortal danger."
TIME PASSES...
Harry snorted. "I'm not moping."
"That's not fair and you know it," Malfoy had said.
“Shut up.”
He would retaliate. He would think of a way to pay the idiot back. Enough was enough.
“We need the stretcher,” he says at the sight of the man.
Draco stood up and looked down at him, taking advantage of his height. “Do you care about me, Potter?”
"C'mon, Malfoy. Let's get out of here."
"Is your cousin… ?" he pauses and finds himself unable to continue. Potter shakes his head and dislodges himself from Draco's arms, leaving him unsettled and feeling utterly awkward. Why in Salazar's name had he reached for Potter?
They run to the ambulance, Potter on their heels, and when they start to get inside, they hear the other ambulance coming. “Good, they can take care of the kid and his mother, let’s go,” Liam urges them.
“Too late.”
Draco raises his head. He forgot to tell him about the potion. Shit.
“I beg your pardon?”
He glares at her, because, come on, as if Potter would give him a chance. But then, he thinks that they have had a couple of civil conversations and maybe, just maybe,...
Malfoy rolled his eyes and stood up. “Hot chocolate?” He asked traipsing to the kitchen.
"Malfoy, you're shivering."
"Observant, aren’t you?" he said through clattering teeth.
“Six is more than zero.”
He put his trousers on and wondered if he had put on some weight as he slid the button on place with difficulty. They were his trousers, the telltale marks here and there said so, but… they were like… two sizes too small.
They found some stairs on the farthest side of the tower, open to the void that seemed to crave victims falling from the uneven steps. The snow covered half of the steps, and Draco reached out to the wall with trembling fingers.
He opens the door and walks briskly through the corridors, looking for Potter, but they are deserted. He could be anywhere. He could have Apparated home already.
“Water, Potter. I’m parched. Is there something useful in that backpack of yours? Or is it just for decor?”
"Well, we made out and he… Well…" Harry looked down.
They had possessed the answer to their troubles with them since the beginning.
“You cheated.”
"What are you talking about? You're my partner." After a pause, he added, "And you're not going to die."
"Dursley."
Potter’s brow furrows. “Don’t you have to drive for…?"
Harry threw his hands in the air and paced. “What are you talking about, Malfoy? This is not real! This…” Harry paused looking around him. “It’s because of this flat? This is what you want? Being surrounded by luxury and… and…”
“From me?”
“Do you like it? I mean, running your own business, and that stuff.”
"Ok, don't tell me, my imagination is probably better anyway. But answer this, how come you decided to work with muggles and endure embarrassing situations on a daily basis?"
Harry exhaled. It would be nice to have someone beside him. An equal. But after Ginny, once he felt ready to try - every time he had actually tried - it was a disaster. His public image preceded him, and Harry found that their preconceived notions set a standard hard to match. One even told him that "Harry Potter is not like that." The date didn't end well, of course.
“I… nothing, just… You’re not that brat anymore.”
"We can't stay here. You need a healer."
"So, tell me, how have you been?" he says, moments later, Lovegood sitting on a green and yellow settee while pouring tea.
“Gotta go, Potter.”
"Why didn't you tell me before?"
He tried to remember his last argument with Edith and couldn’t find a reason for her to go to such extremes. He opened his mouth to argue, but Robards turned a red-tinted parchment towards him. He could read Edith Solomon written in neat letters at the bottom of it. And it stung because he trusted her. In all the months working together, he thought they were good partners. He thought that they were friends.
Draco frowns and makes a mental review of his family tree, and there is only one possibility. “Oh.” That explains things. Like his mother’s scandalized face at some rumours she didn’t want to discuss. Or like Potter’s practiced moves. That struck Draco as oddly endearing and put the git… the young man in front of him in another light.
“You testified in our favour.”
“Sod off.”
“I can send it to you.” Harry’s face falls at Draco’s words. It’s a wonder how he has survived having his heart on his sleeve. More than that, It’s confusing, really, for Draco being so accustomed to pretending and maintaining a facade as his father insisted to teach him. “Or… maybe not?”
It was as exhilarating as the first time. It was perfect.
After sleeping like a log on Draco’s sofa last night, he thought last week’s string of 3 AM awakenings might finally have ended. But it seemed that he would have no such luck. He stood up and dragged his feet to the kitchen rubbing his eyes with one hand. A warm drink would be nice.
"Everything ok?" Carl asks, looking at him sideways, already driving away.
Draco leaves while they complain to one another. He really should stop with the lies. Maybe if he could talk to someone about the weirdness of his life… Perhaps he should write to Pansy… Well, he should apologize first, for not being in contact. What would she say if he told her about Potter?
Soon enough, the idiot stumbles through the sliding doors and Draco's hair raises as the sensation intensifies. He thinks that he can see the tendrils of magic if he squints. Potter's going to get him in trouble because really, any ruckus the Saviour could cause… they would blame Draco just for being there, that's for sure.
"But…"
, they would probably think that it was a remarkable piece of fiction, even if a boring one.
It’s late into his next shift that he finds himself facing Potter again. Draco is sitting in his usual spot, holding and not reading his new book because he's been thinking about this same bespectacled git since they last met.
