When he returns, the customers have left, and Granny beckons him into the back room. He sits down in the big armchair, and Earl jumps into his lap. Perhaps the dog realises he needs comforting.
Harry’s eyes are wide and still a little wet as he levitates Jones through the hallway, to the front door, and chucks him onto the doorstep. Draco’s smile is grim as he looks down at the man, his trouser leg soaking in a puddle.
“Yeah,” says Draco, sitting on the bed. “I’ll just-” Expression glazed over, he doesn’t finish his sentence. Instead he touches himself, moving his hand up and down his cock as he moves his eyes over Harry’s body.
He doesn’t finish his sentence. Not because he doesn’t know how, but because he’s unnerved by the ending. He wants to give Draco control. He already has, a bit, but now he wants to do it consciously.
Luna’s voice is soft and floaty as ever when she greets him. “I wondered if I’d see you today, Draco. I dreamt of you last night, you see.”
He nods, and hastily sits down in the imposing armchair. She reminds him of a terrifying mix of Molly and McGonagall. “Yes, Mrs Lynn. Sorry.”
He thinks of Teddy. He thinks of his colour changing hair and his love of ducks. He thinks of his hatred of parsnips and his big blue eyes. He thinks of the joy and he terror that comes with holding a child in your arms and knowing you would die for them. “New beginnings,” he says.
Draco turns to leave. Harry scrambles to his feet, and grabs his wrist, pulling him round to face him. Their noses are so close he can feel their quick, hot breath between them. “I don’t pity you, Draco. Sometimes I wish I was you.”
“So what brings you to my humble abode, O Chosen One?” he says, casually blasting cobwebs from frames and corners as he walks.
She hums as she boils water in a saucepan; there is no kettle in the kitchen at all. “Yes, Ginny is here of course.”
She smiles. “The twins were the same, they wore more of their dinner than they ate. George still does sometimes. And I told you, Draco, you must call Molly.”
“I manage to pin you down, hold your hands above your head. I’m on top of you, and I realise I’m hard, and it’s pressing into you. I know you can feel it.”
“Are you saying you don’t love me, then? Because I know this is fast, but it’s not like we haven’t known each other for ten years.”
“Well, if you think you’re ready, I have an offer for you.” She says, placing her hands palm down on the table, and he listens to what she has to say.
Harry bristles. “No. Thank you for listening, and thank you for holding out on making fun of me for as long as you did, but we’re not doing this.”
Once the birds have left, Draco perches on the edge of the bed. “Potter,” he says, nudging the sleeping body beside him. “Your fan mail has arrived.”
“Fine,” he says, sliding his thumbs under Potter’s t-shirt to stroke his waist. “Was it the part where I implied I wanted an audience, or the part where I suggested you warm my cock.”
He goes back to his food, and the kettle finishes boiling. The mugs and tea bags sort themselves out, the milk jug hopping about impatiently.
The bird explodes from his wand, and Harry can almost feel the ripples of wind the wings create, illustrated by waves of light in the air. It circles the room several times, searching for somewhere to land, before it perches on the record player. It lifts one leg.
Harry steps back, already apologising, and looks at the other man. He’s handsome. About Harry’s height, but much broader. His grey eyes are very close to Harry’s own, framed with subtle laughter lines.
has a photo of him and Harry taking up half the page. It has to, as there’s very little substance to the article. They’re sat at the back of the Knight Bus, clearly drunk. Harry’s hair is even messier than usual, and he knows its exact texture under his hands. He has his arm around Harry’s shoulders, and Harry is pressing his lips to the underside of his jaw in an endless loop. He doesn’t remember that exact moment, the journey lost in a pleasant haze, but a vague memory scratches at his brain. A flash of light, quickly dismissed. A camera.
This time, when dinner’s over, he doesn’t leave right away. He’s not willing to waste any time in Harry’s presence, whether he’s surrounded by people who hate him or not. They settle back in the living room, and this time he makes sure they’re sat together. Even just having their thighs pressed together, their shoulders touching, makes something settle inside of him. This close, he can smell the familiar scent of him; the one he looks for whenever he buries his nose in Harry’s hair.
Narcissa sits by his bed, her arms folded. At the window, Bunny keeps tapping her beak against the glass.
Harry shouldn’t be listening to this. He picks up Earl and backs off to sit on the waiting room sofa; he feels a sudden curiosity to see what Celestina Warbeck had revealed about the reason for her third divorce exclusively for
She sighs. “I married a Muggle. Or at least I assumed I did, when they moved me up here. Bob and I were already planning to elope when I sat for this portrait. My mother told my father to destroy this too, but he didn’t have the heart. ”
Potter sucks on the head for a last, long second, as if he doesn’t want to stop. Draco hauls him to his feet and back against the books, shoving his thigh between his legs. His jeans are still done up, trapping his erection under tight denim, and it must be killing him. He grabs Potter’s hips, moving them to rub up against him.
They apparate into a dark alleyway, and Harry shivers in his thin jacket. Draco pulls the bag fully out of his pocket, and produces three more bags of bottles from inside, handing one to Harry. The glass rattles ominously, and Harry has to rest a hand underneath so the handles don’t snap under the weight.
Harry turns away from Draco and shrugs off the robe. He hears a small noise of appreciation from behind him and steps into the shower. Looking back, he sees Draco unbuttoning his shirt. “Hurry up, I don’t know how to work all these buttons, and I don’t want a cold shower.”
“Hello, Harry! It looks like rain so we’d better head inside.” As gets closer, Arthur turns to Malfoy. “The roof is intact, isn’t it?”
Simi says goodbye and hangs up, and Draco immediately lets the phone clatter to the floor. Before he knows what’s happening Draco is kissing him, fucking his tongue into Harry’s mouth. He wraps Harry in his arms, pulling him closer, moving him until his dick almost slips out. Draco must be so sensitive, after all this time. Harry certainly is. His rim is throbbing around the intrusion, being unable to close for so long. Even when Draco finally pulls out, it’s going to be open and burning for hours. Funnily enough, he’d barely noticed the ache until now.
“You didn’t darling, that not’s what I meant,” he says, fussing at Harry’s hair. “I meant when he said I didn’t own you, and you kissed me right after. To everyone else, it looked like you were saying I did own you. That’s why he asked me if I’d ‘share’ you- he thought you belonged to me.”
Harry opens his eyes and sees Draco hovering in the doorway, much like he’d appeared in the doorway of the ballroom less than a week ago. His body lacks the confidence of before, he looks almost hesitant now.
He rests his head against Draco’s suit-clad thigh for a moment while he catches his breath, then lets himself be pulled to his feet. Draco kisses him chastely, as if to highlight by contrast how dirty what they just did was. Harry had completely forgotten where they were, that there were even other people in the house, he was so engrossed with Draco.
“It’s rare. I don’t actually believe there’s another person in Britain who repairs wards, currently. It’s something that fell out of use, which is why there’s not as much demand as you might think,” he explains, stirring his tea without clinking it against the porcelain.
When Draco closes his eyes, he sees Terran’s smug bastard face. He drifts off to sweet imaginings of hitting him with every hex and jinx he ever learnt- and his Bellatrix taught him a few.
He’s not sure if Potter’s asking because he thinks the idea is so abhorrent that he’ll run the other way yelling if he finds out Draco wants it as something more than dirty talk, or if it’s something he’s interested in. Draco prays to whoever’s listening that it’s the second one. He pulls back a bit, so he can gauge Potter’s expression.
Aunt Petunia was sat stiffly on a chintz chair, her hands folded in her lap. Her mouth was twisted into what might be a smile; Harry wasn’t sure, as he’d never seen her do such a thing before and so had nothing to compare it to.
Potter disappears to order his drink, and Finch-Fletchley bustles over to Bones to talk about some inane Ministry business. Potter seems surprisingly normal, if he’s honest, considering yesterday’s events. A small seed of hope begins to sprout in his chest, wondering if Potter doesn’t care for Jones as much as he thought.
He swallows. “I mean, I’ve been dreaming that something bad happens to you, and Granny thinks that I might be seeing something that’s going to happen. She gave me this magic tea, and now I’m pretty sure it’s true.”
He has to close his eyes to compose himself. “Unfortunately, that’s one of those things that’s better in theory than practice.”
After he’s been bundled off home, with a promise to Zabini that he won’t try and wash the clothes before he returns them, (My house elf Punty will take care of it, Potter. I don’t trust you not to shrink them three sizes’) he has a few minutes to savour the sudden calm. Zabini and Millicent are a cyclone of bossy-but-helpful orders, acerbic observations, and backhanded compliments. It’s a bit like being lovingly slapped with a wet fish. He’s still reeling when Draco steps through the floo at exactly ten to ten. When he does a doubletake, looking Harry up and down, he knows the ordeal was worth it.
“What do you mean you’re in love with him?” asks Ron, leaning forward in his chair. “We are talking about the same person aren’t we?”
Harry sits down next to him, instead of opposite like he usually does. “What do you think the problem is?”
The heron flies away with his message, and his eyes fall back to Draco where he lies twisted, half on his side. His eyes have closed. The ghostly cat sniffs his face, her whiskers twitching. She rests one paw on his chest, over his heart.
“It doesn’t feel like the War’s over,” he says. “It feels like I’m still there, in the middle of it all. How can I focus on a happy memory when I’m holding my wand, and all I can think about is everything else that wand has done? What I’ve done.”
“Just like you to treat a little fame like a hardship, Potter.” He rolls his eyes. “At least the beer here is decent.”
“What have you got there? A letter?” Dudley snatched it from his hand, a papercut slicing open Harry’s thumb. “So, you’re a thief as well as a freak.”
Harry smiles weakly. “I just wish people would stop congratulating me. I don’t want to be thanked for killing someone, or told how brave I am. I just want some peace and quiet.”
He floos to Grimmauld Place, not stopping to firecall or send an owl first. Immediately, he hears raised voices. There’s no one in the living room he’s tumbled into, so he follows the sounds to the kitchen. Terran Jones has Harry backed up against the countertop, gripping his wrists in large hands. Harry’s still in his pyjamas, hair a dark maelstrom about his face, looking both soft and fierce at once.
Sending the letter off with Roberta, Harry disapparates. His house is relatively tidy; years of the Dursley’s punishments for any speck of dust left on the mantelpiece means he can’t leave a dish or a newspaper lying around without feeling anxious. It’s his house, and he still feels like someone’s going to scream at him if he dares to get it messy. The bedroom however, is a different story. Maybe it’s because he didn’t have a bedroom for so long, and when he did all his things were locked in a cupboard, but this room seems to have different rules. There are shirts strewn over the back of his desk chair, a lone sock on the floor, and a mug on the windowsill. It’s not a tip, but it’s certainly more relaxed. Almost regretfully, Harry tidies up a little. If things go better than he expects they actually will, they might end up back here.
Harry opens his eyes and stares Malfoy down. He knows he heard him the first time. “I want you to fuck me.”
Harry pulls back panting, face alight with a grin, for just long enough to gasp “That means ‘I love you too’, if you were wondering,” before crushing their mouths back together again.
A sound he didn’t know he could make slips past the lip he’s biting. He freezes, and then he melts. Malfoy rubs his palm up and down his back, and Harry wishes he could feel him on his skin. It’s only then he realises they’re both still dressed.
Of course, he’d known this was coming. What he wasn’t expecting was for it to come after a kiss like that, when he’s already so off balance, when he’d spent a few seconds thinking that
“Thanks for telling me that,” he says. “Your dad sounds like he’d get on with my Uncle Vernon. He was always saying stuff like that.”
“Let me hear you, darling,” he chants. “Show me you’re with me- I want you to know who’s fucking you.”
over the new room. Where Malfoy Manor’s wards had given off heat, the Black’s wards are coated in a fine layer of frost. Instead of the twining pipes and sprawling machinery, the objects inside look sharp. Like teeth. Where Draco’s wards had been cobbled together from different metals, everything in here is made from black volcanic glass.
Draco raises an eyebrow, and Harry blushes. Granny smothers a chuckle with a delicate cough, and turns her back to them, going to the counter to put the kettle on. Harry suspects she’s trying to give them an element of privacy.
Terrible taste in men. If Draco has terrible taste in men, then surely that means he’s interested in them? Harry’s heart beats so loudly he doesn’t hear whatever Draco says in reply, and then common sense catches up with him. Apparently there is a strange woman in his attic, and that has to take precedence over obsessing about Draco. Hastily, he climbs the ladder. As he sticks his head through the hatch, he relaxes immediately. Draco has propped a portrait of a woman in an elaborately ruffled dress against a chair, and is sitting cross-legged in front of it.
“Sorry, I don’t I have much experience with Seers who are…” he pauses, casting around for a word that won’t offend her.
Sinking into the warm water, Harry lets out a deep sigh. There’s a faint tingling from the salts, and he can feel them working already, aches he didn’t even know he had disappearing. He submerges himself more deeply, letting the water lap over his chest. His eyes close without his permission, surrounding him in comforting heat and darkness. There’s a creak on the stairs that lets him know Draco got his message, and took him up on his offer. Inviting Draco to Grimmauld, giving him the address, telling him to let himself in. It shows a little more of Harry’s feelings than is probably wise.
It’s so strange to be talked about like he’s not there, or like he can’t understand them, as if he were a baby or a dog. He’d managed to ignore his persistent arousal for so long, but now it seems like the most urgent thing in the world. He needs Draco to touch him, to pay attention to him. More than that, Harry wants him to drag the torture out. To ignore him, leave him waiting.
“Oh?” he says, raising an eyebrow. Out the corner of his eye he can see Potter’s mouth twitching, trying not to smile.
The doors are fully repaired, and even now Harry has to stop and admire them again. Dancers made from rosewood inlays waltz in circles, so animated he can almost hear the rustle of swirling gowns. He opens the heavy doors, ushers Draco through, and shuts the doors behind them. Immediately, he pushes Draco back against them.
Ron and Hermione come for dinner that night, and Harry makes curry. He’s always been a good cook- he had to be, living with the Dursleys- but he only started to enjoy it when he started living on his own. Petunia would never put anything on the table spicier than mustard, and he was eager to reclaim whatever part of his family history he could. Tonight’s experiment is Nani Pothar’s Maharashtrian Chicken curry. He’d salvaged some family recipes from a dusty cookbook left behind to rot in Godric’s Hollow, along with a few other tokens he’d restored and displayed. Fridge magnets, children’s picture books, a record player.
Harry makes a show of looking him up and down. “Yes.” In reality, he doesn’t look like he’s done a day of manual labour in his life.
He huffs a laugh. “We were in a room full of dangerous and temperamental machinery. How was I supposed to kiss you properly?”
Somewhere in the year since the war ended, Harry had forgotten how to be brave. Courage was one of the things he’d defined himself by, at one time. He was a Gryffindor, and so he was brave. In the only months of his life where there’s been nothing to fight for, nothing to struggle against, he’s gotten out of the habit. Like an unused muscle. It’s time to get it back.
. Then he can’t think of a reason not to say it, so he does. Draco leans down. Oh Merlin, he's leaning down, is he going to kiss him? Harry cranes his head up at an awkward angle to reach him, he doesn’t want to disturb whatever is happening by standing up. Draco's grey eyes are dark, determined. They should look like granite, but instead they look liquid. Like they could swallow him whole.
Terran kisses Potter again and pushes him back down on the bed. Potter lets him, and Draco wishes he would shove him off, that he would realise that he doesn’t have to put up with this. When Potter flinches, Draco flinches with him.
Harry sighs, but smiles despite himself. The more time he spends around Slytherins, the more he thinks insults might actually be their way of showing affection. When Millie and Zabini first starting to coming to pub nights, he thought they despised each other. It was only a year later, when he expressed concern to Hermione over a particularly nasty exchange, that she informed him they were actually best friends. And that’s not even starting on Draco’s own individual brand of derision.
The customer exits through the bead curtain, and despite her red-rimmed eyes, gives Harry a weak smile. He finds Granny in the back room shuffling her cards. “Is she okay?” he asks.
“Don’t what? Tell the truth? I could kill that idiot boyfriend of yours for not treating you better.”
Weasley looks about the room, as if checking he is actually in Draco Malfoy’s house, and not some bizarre dream world. Finding nothing of comfort, he looks back at Draco. He opens his mouth again, gearing up to ask a barrage of insensitive questions no doubt, but clamps his jaws shut at the last minute.
As he whisks the eggs, he realises he never even made Draco a drink. A few rushed flicks of his wand later and he sends a mug, a pot of tea, a small milk jug, and a sugar bowl that wiggles its way out of the back of the cupboard, floating up to Draco. Harry’s not exactly sure what he’s doing up there, but he seems happy, and that’s enough for him.
He leans back, attempting to look unaffected but failing miserably. “The letters, Potter. Did you want me to humiliate myself, is that it? Share them with your little Gryffindor friends so you can laugh at where the Death Eater is now?”
“I’d imagine it has something to do with the fraught confrontation with your shitty ex, impromptu and vigorous sex on the floor, and the long hot bath.”
Harry chews his bottom lip. “But what about Death? It can mean endings; what if it means he won’t want to be friends anymore?”
Harry feels a little relieved, but not that much. He might not be able to use magic to defend himself against a muggle, but Draco would never let him try anything. He’s certain of that now. Still, Draco feels rigid underneath him. It’s probably best to separate them.
Draco turns his nose up slightly. “What you don’t understand Harry, is that if you’re important enough, people will wait for you.”
“You know,” says Malfoy. “It’s debatable whether or not you’re still a virgin, given that we never actually shagged.”
Draco woke to the sound of beaks tapping on a window and Potter sprawled across his chest. He rubs the sleep out of his eyes and looks in the direction of the noise; four different owls are jostling for position on the windowsill, nipping at each other viciously. Groaning, he shakes Potter’s shoulder.
“Well, you better go and tell him how you feel,” suggests Granny, after Harry tells her what he’s read.
Harry is hungover. The alarm clock is ringing, stabbing into his head like a crime of passion. He throws it at the wall, and feels a rush of sweet justice. Dragging himself out of bed and into the shower, he tries to remember the night before. It had been afternoon when they arrived at the pub, and getting dark when they left. He thinks they went to a muggle bar after that, but his memories from there are hazy. Draco had a lot he’d rather not think about, and Harry was happy to do the same. By the end of the night they were pleasantly drunk, arms slung over each other’s shoulders for support. Draco had smelled nice, and sort of herbal.
Harry’s never gotten this far before, but he’s determined not to let that stop him this time. Thinking, if he does it fast enough, he can push past any worry not drowned out by arousal, he swallows as much as he can. It feels strange, and hot, and overwhelming in a way he’s never felt before. Malfoy hisses. Harry almost grins, before he remembers to mind his teeth. He wants to make it feel good. Not because he’s worried Malfoy will reject him. He wants to make it feel good because when they were eleven, he got on a broom for the first time and flew circles around Malfoy, who had been flying almost before he could walk. He may be inexperienced, but there’s no accounting for his competitive streak when it comes to Malfoy.
Granny takes his hand, and instead of shaking it, she turns it over to see his palm. She strokes his knuckles and smiles innocently. “You have very longs thumbs.”
Draco blinks, startled out of the strange trance he’d found himself in. He shouldn’t have teased Potter like that- there’s no way he’s ready to go again.
‘Patented Daydream Charm’, and if he’s about to wake up and realise that none of this is real. The rest of him knows that there’s no magic strong enough to create an illusion this powerful. Besides, a daydream would never include the pain of Harry’s glasses digging into his cheek, or the strands of his hair that are trapped in their mouths. Harry leans back, huffing a wry laugh, and pushes his hands through Draco’s hair to hold it out of the way. There’s no enchantment strong enough to conjure up a laugh so awkwardly beautiful, so full of heavy joy. Draco’s eyes sting with the effort of holding back tears once again.
“First things first,” starts Draco. “You need a safeword. Are you aware of the purpose of a safeword?”
She unfreezes and goes to sit with him at the table. She begins to play with her hair, like she always does when she’s uncomfortable. “Luna and I are together.”
I'm currently writing the trickiest chapter of the whole fic. Please pray for me, send good vibes, sacrifice a golden calf, etc. This however, is one of my favourite (and longest) chapters. Let me know what you think!
Ron and Hermione sit at the kitchen table drinking the wine they’ve brought, breathing in the fragrant coconut-sweet steam coming from the pot on the stove. Hermione looks tired as ever with her stressful Ministry job, but not unhappy. She’d swapped her sensible kitten heels for sandals and her suit trousers for jeans. Ron seems more grown up than ever. He’s come straight from an afternoon shift at W
Draco mentally shakes himself. He’s getting carried away. It’s just a kiss. A fucking brilliant kiss, but just a kiss all the same. At any rate, there’s no time for Draco to have a mental breakdown. He’s got someone to look after. He pulls away, running his hands over Potter’s body, grounding him. He’s almost shaking in his arms, coming down from the high. Potter tries to dart back in for a kiss, but Draco stops him.
Harry chews his bottom lip, unsure what exactly Draco needs from him. He’s determined to give it to him all the same. “Then use my wand.”
“Whisky,” he says, surprised at the show of hospitality. After that letter he’d expected they’d go straight to the bedroom.
The emotional confession led to gestures of comfort, which led to something else entirely. They apparated straight from the balcony to Grimmauld Place. Kissing was fine. Harry had always seemed to kiss without any panic, but when Oliver’s hand moved below his belt, he froze. They talked about it, and Oliver said that hooking up drunk was probably a bad idea anyway, but to feel free to send him an owl if he ever wanted to pick up where they left off. Harry never did.
He sighs, and looks down at the dog sniffing his trainers. “Hard luck Earl, it looks like they cropped you out.” Harry chucks the paper onto the waiting room table next to the magazines. “I’m not going to read that drivel, you’ll have to sum it up for me.”
Clutched in Draco’s free hand is Granny’s pocket watch, but it isn’t purring anymore. The broken chain pools on the cobbles, and starts to move like a tail. It starts to hiss. Harry picks it up, hoping that this strange object somehow has the power to save Draco. The links break apart, and where the metal snaps, a silver mist leaks out. Metal turning so cold it burns his fingers, Harry drops the watch. The mist rises, like steam from a kettle, and begins to form the shape of a cat. The spectre lands on its feet, and turns to face the woman. She’s shocked and pale, watching the scene unfold. She looks younger than before, really not much older than him. Out of her depth.
Update 10th December 2020: I’m currently writing a festive sequel, so if you enjoyed this keep your eyes tuned and your ears peeled!
“I- I don’t know,” stammers Harry, unnerved by the question and the compliment alike. “I don’t think so; Simi invited me.”
Draco kneels, looking up at Harry, grey eyes like Eider down. “It’ll be hard for me to check on you like this, so I need you to keep talking. Can you do that for me, darling?”
Aisling licks her lips. “I asked what her brother was called, and she said Rowan. That was my uncle’s name. I accused her of lying, of stealing the watch.”
Tabby throws her hands up and looks at the boy. “See Nick? It’s just you. Everyone else thinks he cut it off.”
“But where would I find someone who I both trust and don’t care about?” he wonders. “And we don’t even know if it would work.”
The man stood before him was dressed all in black, except for the spotless white cravat noose-tight around his throat. His hair was long and lank, brown fading into grey and tied loosely behind him. He seemed short, even to someone as small as Harry, an impression that wasn’t helped by the way his back stooped over. His diminutive stature didn’t make him any less intimidating. His eyes flickered over Harry, then away, then back again in a way that was disconcerting.
“So,” continues Granny. “She tried to tell me that the watch was a family heirloom, and that whoever had sold it to me had no right to it. She tried to buy it from me. I explained that I had made it for my brother, who then left it to me in his will.”
He holds out his wand, and turns it so the hilt is facing Draco. Looking between Harry and the wand, Draco shakes his head. Without warning, he takes it from Harry’s loose grip. Draco twirls it between his long fingers, and blue sparks shoot out, fizzling and crackling. He looks down in surprise.
People start arriving. First Ginny, who lets out a small giggle of hysteria when she sees Draco before clapping a hand over her mouth. Then George, who laughs and claps him a little too hard on the shoulder. Then Percy, who just blinks, before ignoring him completely. Then Bill and Fleur. Bill says greets him with “Malfoy” and shakes hands with him politely, if coolly. Fleur gives him the customary kiss on both cheeks. Granted, it’s in the middle of greeting everyone this way, and Draco’s sort of just gotten lost in the mix, but she does do it.  Finally, Ron and Hermione arrive.
Malfoy’s smile turned a little more genuine. “I didn’t read it for Teddy, I read it for me. It’s charming.”
There may be some credit to the idea that people look like their pets, because this person could not look more like an owl if they tried. Their eyes are round, yellow, and luminous. Their grey hair piled on their head like a nest and just barely held in place with pins. Harry gets the unsettling impression that if they wanted to they could turn their head full-circle. Their name badge reads ‘
ing it. Organised as his products are, one knock would probably have them all falling over in neat lines, like dominoes.
“You didn’t do anything wrong. It’s just- you were just- you were taking care of me!” Tears threaten Harry’s eyes again. “You were taking care of me, and isn’t that ridiculous, considering I’m the one who gave you these?” he says, tracing a finger over the scars on Draco’s chest.
Harry pushes Terran off him, his fingers slipping out. “I went off again, I didn’t even know what you were doing.”
Someone is knocking at his bedroom door. “Harry? Are you awake?” Hermione turns the handle and pushes her way in. “It’s nearly midday.”
Harry shrugs. “I just cooked it. I usually got some baked beans, because my uncle didn’t like them, and Dudley would never eat the tomatoes or the mushrooms.”
“There’s this wonderful new invention, Potter,” says Draco, crossing his arms.  “I don’t know if you’ve heard of it, but apparently it’s called a
Is he? He doesn’t know. Now that he thinks about it his face does seem wet, but surely that could be from when his hair was still dripping. He opens his mouth to deny it, but all that comes out is a sob. Between his legs, his dick is still heavy and sensitive. How can he be crying and aroused at the same time? There truly is something deeply wrong with him.
He can tell Ron’s getting angry. For some reason, Ron gets a little overprotective when it comes to Harry and men. Hermione would say it’s a combination of subconscious misogyny and homophobia, but sometimes he could act like Harry was a little sister who needed protecting. Not that Ginny needs protecting, but he supposes that’s what Hermione means. Harry doesn’t entirely agree with her assessment, but he doesn’t really disagree either. If he’s being honest, he doesn’t mind it. It’s nice to have someone care that much.
Draco rolls his eyes and takes a muggle debit card out of his wallet. Honestly, it’s kind of amusing how people assume he still knows nothing about muggles.
The house looks presentable, he's thought out the request he plans to make to Draco, but it isn’t enough. Before, he didn't know how he felt. He didn't realise what the fluttering in his stomach meant. Now he knows he wants to kiss Draco until they forget to breath, and he has no idea how to act around him. Harry feels sure that Draco will be able to tell with one look what he’s thinking, because it’s written all over his face. He’s always been awkward when he likes someone. Grimacing, he thinks about the fiasco with Cho in Madame Puddifoot’s. Why can he never say the right thing?
If Harry’s learned anything from the nearly two weeks he’s known her, it’s that Granny has her ways. He sighs with relief, and puts his wand away. Through the tall window, he sees a pale blond head weave its way to the front. Draco emerges looking harried, and walks into the shop.
As it happens, that last one was a big mistake, because he remembers at the last minute exactly why both of them didn’t catch that Quidditch match on the wireless. Draco was probably fucking his thighs around the time they released the snitch, and he was probably tossing Harry off as he sat in his lap around the time the seeker caught it.
Malfoy laughs half-heartedly. “I’m reformed, not a saint.” His teeth are oddly perfect; it’s off-putting.
Harry can’t take it anymore. He jerks his chin up to quiet Draco’s dirty mouth with his own. Their feet almost tangle together for a moment as they come to an abrupt stop, Draco forgetting the flimsy pretence of the dance to commit himself to the kiss. Harry flicks out his hand to cast a wandless, wordless
Harry’s mouth twitches into something like a smile, but his mind is busy tracing over the three symbols. “A snitch makes me think of catching something.”
Weasley looks guiltily at his feet, and Draco sighs to himself. Like it or not, this ginger idiot is Harry’s friend. If he wants to keep him in his life, he needs to play nice.
“What are ghosts if not a memory? What is a person?” asks Granny. “We are the product of our experiences, each moment deciding the next.”
“It might just be me and my own tendencies, shaping the way things unfold, but I don’t really believe that’s the case. Is it, darling?”
She looks thoughtful. “Wait there a moment.” She wheels herself through the bead curtain, and returns with the pocket watch. “Are you certain it’s this one? Not one that looks similar.”
Potter’s face is blank as he stares down at the photo of his ex and this other man. The new boyfriend is attractive, to be sure, but nothing compared to Potter. His hair is far too well behaved, for a start.
“When I came to visit you, you kept getting it out and opening and closing it again. I don’t think you even noticed.”
“Potter, wake up. There’s about a thousand blasted owls trying to peck their way through the glass.”
She drifts away like a wisp of cloud on the breeze, and Draco turns his attention to the Slytherins.
He rummages through the fridge and finds a leftover sausage, breaking off a piece small enough for her to swallow. He sets her to perch on top of the fridge while he grabs a pen and paper.
Or maybe it is. He strides forward with purpose, pinning Harry against the doorjamb and swallowing the gasp it forces out of him. Harry winds his arms around his neck, pulling him closer. Draco can feel his warmth through the soft material of his pyjamas, and he slides his hands under the top to grab at his waist. Harry makes a sound that simultaneously reminds him of both a noise you make after a really good stretch or eating a truly decadent desert. Satisfaction, relief, pleasure. He can give him all that and more.
“I’ve always loved Molly’s food, but I find she’s quite reluctant to try new things,” says Luna. “I wanted to give her my recipe for broccoli Battenburg but her face went very strange, and she pretended something was burning.”
Harry takes off his glasses and wipes them on the edge of his t-shirt, flashing a glimpse of smooth skin and a hint of dark hair. The urge to touch becomes irresistible. Draco gets up from the table to hook his chin over Harry’s shoulder, wrapping his arms around him and sliding a hand under his shirt to feel the skin teasing him so cruelly. He’s so warm, but still the feel of Harry in his arms is like a cool palm on a fevered brow. Halting the figure of eight movement of his wooden spoon, Harry leans back into him.
"And take, for example, the wand checking. It's great, so long as the Aurors are using their own wands. I think I told you about Byrnes, yeah? With the hex?"
Their lips touched lightly. Harry was obviously being careful, but Draco still felt the contact down to his toes. Moaning, he clutched Harry’s robes in his fists, pulling him closer and tilting his head so their mouths could slide together more easily.
Draco rested his forehead against Harry's. "I'd really like to take you up on that offer of a private dinner, if that's all right?"
Draco swallowed (she never said his name like that unless he'd done something wrong) and stiffly sat down. Mother smiled charmingly and turned to Harry. "Milk, Mr Potter?"
Rolling his eyes, Draco hunched over his desk, returning to his calculations. “You should be worried about the world,” he muttered. “We’re all doomed.”
He vaguely registered a whooshing sound, but he was too focused on the chart to ponder its origin. He looked up to find Granger and Pansy watching him with matching stares that seemed to eat through his clothing until he was naked before them.
“Salazar, it’s up to me,” he whispered. “I need to talk Harry Potter out of taking over the world or we are all screwed.”
The pub was crowded, but their friends had managed to snag their usual table, and as they approached, both Granger’s and Pansy’s eyes went immediately to their clasped hands. Granger smiled, turning away to talk to Weasley.
Draco shook his head and, as the afternoon faded away, found himself drawn into a conversation with Potter that had nothing to do with Potter becoming a Dark Lord. And he didn't even know.
Mind racing, Draco tried to think of a way out of his dilemma. Not that he wasn’t attracted to Harry, he definitely was, but wouldn’t sleeping with him to turn him from the Dark side be a bit, well, Dark itself? Not to mention that Granger probably knew what he was doing since Pansy no doubt told her. She was sure to tell Harry, and it would suck if
. Maybe he was doing Dark Lord type things. Draco frowned. What did a Dark Lord do anyway when he was just starting out? Was it making connections, finding followers? Or was it more information gathering, seeing where to hit first?
Sauntering past the Minister’s office, Draco took a quick glance inside the foyer. There sat Percy Weasley at his desk, looking for all the world like a gargoyle guarding his master’s door.
"Ron's out." Damn, Granger was near psychic. Draco clouded his mind just in case she was using Legilimency. Although she was far too noble to use it without his consent.
Draco smiled tightly. "She really did mean it when she said you could be her future son-in-law. She's been talking to Pansy and Granger. This is her way of not being subtle."
Potter stared into his coffee for a long moment before his head began nodding. He looked up at Draco with his intense green eyes. "You know, you're right. Hermione is always saying I should stop complaining if I'm not going to do anything about it."
“No, not at all,” Draco replied, flicking another imaginary speck of lint off his robes. “I just appear to have got something on my robes.”
Risking it, Draco backed up a couple of steps, peering around the open door. He exhaled when he saw Potter, who looked relaxed and not as if he was about to murder the Minister and take over in a bloody coup.
"I really do need to finish this report," Potter sounded exhausted, "but I could use a break." He looked up at Draco with appraising green eyes. "Would you mind making it coffee instead?"
There was that word again. Draco opened his mouth to suggest they stay for pudding, but Harry had already signalled the elf, was paying the bill, and dragging Draco out of the restaurant.
Narrowing his eyes, Draco asked, "And what did the Minister say?" He was, admittedly, nervous. It seemed that Potter's frustrations went further than just the bureaucracy.
So, no. Potter wasn't going to just Imperius the Minister. That'd make it too easy for him to be caught, and Potter was smarter than that.
Potter must have felt his presence because he looked up at Draco with weary eyes that widened as he recognised Draco. Draco smiled, which caused Potter to look even more surprised.
Potter laughed. “I suppose. Although I could use a cup of coffee.” He paused. “Or tea, as the case may be.”
"For what?" Harry asked bitterly. "Not telling me the truth? For the...dates? For what are you apologising for, Draco?"
Narcissa lifted the china teacup delicately and admired the pansy painted on the side. She enjoyed taking tea with Pansy, and not just for the quality of her loose leaf and china. The Parkinson girl had grown to be far more interesting than her vapid mother had ever been.
“...appreciate your ideas, Harry. Even though we can’t implement all of them, I do want to hear them. Come and talk with me any time.”
"I had the numbers all wrong." Draco didn't know who he was talking to. He was struggling to process this fundamental change. Harry didn't need saving from being a Dark Lord. He was fine. The world was safe. Draco should have been relieved, but he felt empty. Did this mean he wouldn't see Harry any more? The thought made his chest ache.
Draco resisted rolling his eyes at Potter's terse reply. Apparently Potter wasn't going to open up that easily. "C'mon, Potter. I know we didn't get on in school"—he ignored Potter's rude snort—"but like it or not, we now have the same social circle. We should make an effort for their sake." Playing on Potter's loyalty to his friends seemed to work as Potter gave a little nod and dropped the suspicious look.
at blow jobs, and as he closed his mouth around Draco’s cock and pressed downward, Draco shuddered, his fingers clenching in Harry’s hair as pleasure spiked through him.
“You’re not going to tell me who?” she asks, sitting next to him and folding her legs underneath her.
Aside from the dent in the bell, Granny’s shop looks like nothing has changed. Except for the woman sat in Harry’s purple armchair. He glares, pettily conjuring two more, identical chairs. First she stuns Granny, then she tries to steal her most treasured possession, and finally she curses Draco. No. Finally, she steals his chair. She better have a good explanation.
Malfoy shakes his head. “That’s not the point, Potter. It’s not normal for you. From what I’ve gathered, it’s a pretty massive fucking deal for you.”
“I didn’t think. The only thing I knew about him was that he was a Death Eater, and he was casting something at me. I didn’t know it was just an
Potter shrugs and uncrosses his arms, taking Draco’s hand and letting himself be pulled upright. “It’s okay.”
The toy doesn’t stop when he does, and Potter just keeps sucking through it. He opens his eyes a crack, showing a sliver of green, and looks up at Draco. Sliding out carefully, he feels the come dribbling out after him. He reaches up to stop the toy moving, but when he tries to take it away, Potter shakes his head.
“If the problem is just sex, then couldn’t you get some experience with someone else, and then try and work things out with your ex-boyfriend?”
“Yes, I wanted to apologise for my actions. I’m sure you know everything I’m referring to, so please don’t waste both of our time by asking me to recite such a very long list.”
“Let’s get you inside,” says Draco. “I need to send for the Aurors, and probably the Healers to be safe, but we can’t just stay out here on the street.”
Harry nods again, and then he’s naked. He’s naked in the middle of Malfoy’s kitchen, and somehow the bastard is still fully dressed. Instead of feeling uncomfortable, it only makes him harder. Whereas yesterday he could feel the silk of Malfoy’s waistcoat against his dick, now he can feel the gentle scratch of his trousers, and it’s driving him fucking mad. The rub of the fabric is quickly replaced with Malfoy’s hand, giving him a beautifully brutal squeeze.
“How very maudlin, Harry. You are right, though.” She holds Teddy close to her chest, and buries her nose in his hair. “We were very close once, you know.”
The god of time sits in the corner, deciding not to bother the pair with petty details like seconds and minutes and hours. Draco’s voice is the anchor tethering him to his body, the sounds becoming more important than the words themselves.
When he returns, the shop is quiet except for the gentle clinking and whistling sounds of Granny making tea. He unclips Earl’s lead, and follows him into the back room. Earl wiggles his whole body like he hasn’t seen he in years, not less than an hour. Granny goes back to the tea, and Harry sees she’s not using her usual tin, nor the one with the loose leaves. This time it’s a jar, and the mixture inside is a muted purple. He sits in the armchair, waiting for Granny to start talking; as usual she seems to have a particular topic in mind. She places a cup in front of him, but doesn’t appear to have made one for herself this time. The brew has a dark plum hue, so deep as to almost be black.
Lying in bed, Harry stares up at the ceiling. He has just had sex for the first time. With Draco Malfoy. And it was
Draco pulls Harry up by his hand, and levitates the woman’s struggling body ahead of them. He winds his fingers through Harry’s, not letting go even once he’s standing. They hurry into the shop, the door kicking at the dropped bell where it lies on the floor.
Malfoy’s eyes widen, and for the first time tonight he seems to be speechless. Harry comes to stand in front of where Malfoy’s sitting, and kneels. Grey eyes follow him down, and from Harry’s new position, he can see he is affected. When he undoes his trousers- buttons, instead of a muggle zip- his hands are steady. This is one of things Terran has been angling for for a while. When he looks up at Malfoy, guilt sours his mouth. It’s Malfoy’s hand gripping the back of his neck, and Malfoy he cursed in a bathroom. It’s Malfoy’s wiry thigh he’s resting his hand on, and Malfoy who broke his nose. He wants to get under his skin again, and for a minute he hadn’t thought about Terran at all.
Draco sighs, but reluctantly concedes. He’d much rather tease Harry than eat dinner, but if he wants this relationship to develop, they do need to spend time together that isn’t just having sex. He goes back to watching Harry, listening to him talk, locking the memory away for safekeeping.
“Sometime I’ll take the time to undress you properly,” he says, punctuating his words with a kiss. “But right now-”
“That is not why. I just don’t trust people who say they can do stuff that no one else can. If telling the future is possible, then why isn’t everyone doing it?”
Pansy shakes her head. “If he hurts you, I’ll kill him. I don’t care that he’s Harry Potter, I’ll do it anyway. I can go on the run to Greece after, I’ve always wanted to go.”
Harry hums. She did tell him to tell Draco how he feels, and look how that turned out. “Look, you don’t have to stay and look after me. I’ll be fine.”
He removes his fingers, and Harry almost wants to cry at the loss. Draco whispers the same spell he’d used when he’d ridden him before, the one that leaves him wet and open in an instant. A gasp is punched out of him, and Harry quickly clamps his mouth shut. He’s supposed to be quiet.
- smirks. He flicks his wand, and Harry’s glasses shoot into his hand. He places them carefully onto Harry’s face and chucks his wand away again. “Now, Potter. Fuck yourself on my cock.”
Granny shrugs. “Most people don’t. There’s very few things in life we really need magic for, otherwise muggles would have gone extinct a long time ago.”
“Please, you were so easy to wind up it took barely any time at all. Only about a fifth of my waking hours were spent coming up with ways to destroy you.”
They sit like that for a moment, Harry still in his lap. Draco strokes up and down his back, as if Harry needs comforting. Looking at Draco’s face- a little lost, a little panicked- he wonders if he’s actually trying to comfort himself. His face changes, putting on a mask of smug satisfaction, erasing any lingering traces of distress. Should Harry say something? Before he can think of what to say, or ask, Draco speaks.
“Do you think-” starts Draco, before apparently deciding against asking whatever question he has, and taking a bite of bacon instead.
Narcissa raises one perfect eyebrow in a way Harry has never been able to master. “And what is this plan?”
Harry sinks further into him, feeling cradled and finally relaxed. His anxieties about what they plan to do don’t disappear, but they grow distant and unimportant. He’s not listening to them anymore; he’s much more interested in what Draco has to say.
“I was just going to tell you that, since you’re apparently loaded again, you’ll be bringing most of the alcohol on Saturday.”
Weasley’s frown doesn’t go away, but now it just looks dumbfounded. He scans his eyes over Draco, probably wondering if he gave him brain damage. “Why aren’t you pissed off? I just hit you, I thought you’d be hexing me right now.”
Unable to wait any longer, Harry reaches between his legs and strokes himself at a brutal pace. He releases Draco from his mouth, gasping, before sucking him in again.
“No,” says Harry, shaking his head vehemently. “It’s the same every time, and its of something that hasn’t happened yet.”
“You really should talk to Ron and Hermione in person,” says Harry. “I promise she won’t hit you again.”
Granny shrugs. “That’s alright Harry, remembering isn’t the point. You can use the book if you like.”
As annoying as it is, he’s hit the nail right on the head. One of the most common things he hears when people meet him for the first time is ‘I thought you’d be taller’. Harry is not the larger-than-life hero who can fuck someone like they’re in a romance novel, and he’s never going to be. It sort of puts the pressure on.
“He is quite wild, I’m afraid. My poor Dudley lives quite in terror of him. I’ve done all I can, but unfortunately there’s just no taming him.” Here she sighed, and looked at Harry, continuing to talk as if he wasn’t present. “Furthermore, he is a persistent liar. He’s always spinning tales about wrongs that have been done with him. If he says he has been mistreated, do not listen to him; he only means to hurt us.”
Malfoy’s sadness is still clear in the bags under his eyes, the tightness of his jaw, but lightened by childish humour. Distraction is clearly the way forward, even if it means Harry has to provoke him. It’s not like he doesn’t have practice. “No, you’re right. He’s way funnier than you.”
He takes out his wand and taps Harry’s trainers, before rising to his feet. Sure enough, the laces undo themselves, and Harry lifts his heels so the shoes can slip out from under his feet.
Narcissa sighs. “Draco has always lashed out when upset. I think what he said to you had more to do with his pride, than anything else. This is easier to fix than you think, Harry.”
The Healer hums, and addresses Granny’s niece. “I’m going to take you in to the hospital to stay overnight.”
He starts tracing the counters with his wand absentmindedly. “I used to visit my Great Aunt Walburga here when I was little. I never went in the kitchen though, we always ate in the dining room.”
Just as Harry’s amused smile tips over into a smirk, Draco catches his eye from across the room. His face momentarily relaxes into something fond, before straightening into a stern frown. Draco stalks towards him, and the decorator takes the opportunity to scurry away and hide before Draco remembers his existence. He raises one perfectly groomed eyebrow, and Harry feels a spike low in his belly. It’s basically a Pavlovian response, at this point.
“It certainly made an impression,” he says. “But now Simi and everyone else think that, too. I probably should have said something, corrected them, but I liked Samuel thinking you belonged to me. I’m sorry.”
He shifts uncomfortably in his seat. “It’s not that simple. There were things you did yesterday that would normally set me off, but it didn’t that time. And then, sometimes I think I’m fine with something and suddenly I can’t do it.”
“Please just untie me, Draco,” Potter says, and he sounds tired. Draco falters, caught off balance. Potter’s not the type to lay down -
Hermione looked to Pansy, who rolled her eyes. "The idiot messed up the name. He used his full name and mine, but in doing Potter's chart he left out his middle name." She shook her head, showing the same impatience Narcissa felt. "He made a point to double check his calculations, but didn't go back to make sure he'd started with the correct numbers in the first place."
“But enough about that,” Harry said, brushing his lips against Draco’s. “We have got to get going now or we’ll be hosting everyone here and we’ll never get rid of them.”
“Well, that’s a nice welcome.” Pansy sailed in, smirking at him. “What’s wrong now, darling? Arithmancy project not working out the way you’d hoped?” She leaned over, peering at his parchments.
She was still struggling to understand the details of what the girls had told her so far. "So this chart determines a person's occupation?"
Weasley coughed, looking away from Potter and spotting Draco. His eyes narrowed. “You should know, this conversation is no longer private.”
It figured, he thought with a frown (it wasn't a pout, no matter what Pansy claimed). Of course, just as he was maybe—maybe!—starting to reclaim his reputation, rebuild his family’s name,
“All right, that’s it,” said Pansy. “I need to get you out of here. This project is starting to get to you. What you need is to relax. Let's go to a pub."
She blushed. "Well, we were, but he sent me an owl just before I left." She looked up as Longbottom walked over. "Neville, please, sit. Draco was just leaving. Weren't you?"
Pulling off, Harry leaned up, kissing Draco. His mouth was soft, tender, and Draco responded, moaning as the kiss escalated. When they separated, panting to catch their breath, he smirked. “So I suppose it’s my turn now?” he said, sitting up and pressing Harry into the sofa.
Harry’s smile was bright. “Should we get out of here?” he asked. “I think the next step we take in this relationship should be private, don’t you?”
Harry arrived with drinks, Weasley and Granger in tow, and as they all chatted, Draco did a quick calculation in his head. With a shiver he wondered if Longbottom could have been the Dark Lord he’d been anticipating. I have to go home and do the numbers properly, he thought as conversation flowed around him. Pansy will hex me into tomorrow if I’m wrong, and Harry--
would be foretold in the numbers. “Fuck,” he whispered as the enormity of what his calculations meant hit him. “Fuck, fuck, fuck.”
He stepped into the study and saw the parchment on the desk included Harry's chart that Pansy had all but pried from his hands. He had known she would show Granger, but it was still awkward to see it sitting out on Granger's desk covered in red ink.
"In here," came a voice through the door past the hearth. Draco supposed that was how people handled the lack of elves. Shouting across the house. Charming.
“I can only imagine.” Harry, eyes bright behind his glasses, patted Draco’s hand. “You seem to be thriving under the pressure, though.”
Potter ducked his head and left. Draco watched him go over his shoulder and then, before he could let his head fall forward onto the bar top, he found himself with more company. "Gryffindors. Always where I don't want you."
Harry's hands slid from Draco's arms to his arse and squeezed. Draco squeaked and arched away, except then his hips bumped into Harry's. He swallowed hard and no, he was no longer having any problem there. Harry smirked as he realised that Draco was quickly hardening. "So. Sofa, or one of those ancient looking chairs?"
Hermione chimed in. "They are together all the time. Draco calls them meetings, but they are what anyone else would call dates. Coffee, dinner, walks through the park."
“No, it’s fine,” Potter said briskly. “I really should get back to those reports.” As they headed down in the lift, he hummed. “Are you heading to the pub tonight? It’s the usual night for the gang to all meet up there.”
"I did. I will. Just please consider that his feelings might be genuine despite the nonsense about the chart."
Draco paused at the door, pretending he had something on his robes. Making a show of it, he brushed at them, all the while surreptitiously eyeing Weasley.
Just then Draco didn’t want to go anywhere. He sighed, toying with the collar of Harry’s shirt. “Do we have to? I doubt anyone would miss us if we skip tonight.”
Pansy wasn't home, so Draco sent her an owl. He wouldn't usually include details in a letter sent by owl, but he couldn't risk her taking the matter lightly and blowing him off for Longbottom. Her reply stated that she was actually with Granger and insisted he join them immediately. He didn't much fancy going to Granger's house—Weasley lived there!—but he really needed Pansy's advice before his date with Harry. And, loath as he was to admit it, he could probably benefit from Granger's as well.
It was their second outing to a proper restaurant and it felt distinctly like a date to Draco. In fact, they’d seen each other every night that week. This...thing that was happening between them had all the hallmarks of a relationship, although as soon as he thought it, Draco banished the word from his mind. No, no this was just him distracting Harry from his Dark plans and saving the world in the process. Right?
Even worse, Potter’s looking at him in pity. This ignites a flame in Draco’s chest, kindled by the pride still drilled somewhere deep down inside of him. “Draco, I’m sorry, I just-”
Draco doesn’t realize how drastically things have changed between him and Potter until he looks over at the Gryffindor table and Potter doesn’t look back. He scoots a few inches to the left until Greg’s face is obscuring Potter from view.
“Granger. Weasley,” he says, and they stop. They’re three steps above him, and he has to look up at them awkwardly. “Is - where’s Potter?”
are the only words he can make out from his angle, and he doesn’t even want to read the rest of the headline. Naturally, he scoots closer so he can see.
“Oh, no,” Potter backtracks. “No, I just thought - actually, um great.” He looks absolutely mortified, and the sight almost makes Draco laugh. “I’ll meet you in the Entrance Hall at seven tomorrow?”
It’s nothing new, so it really shouldn’t shake him like it does. The family deserved their fallen grace after the War, after centuries of bribery and hatred. A single bead of nervous sweat rolls down his side.
Draco is knocked off balance, not only by the abrupt change in subject, but by the mundane excuse coming out of The Savior of the Wizarding World’s mouth. He sounds like… he sounds like a regular teenager.
“Are you sure you’re not following me?” Draco says, tilting his head. “It kind of feels like you are.”
“Why don’t you heal them?” she hissed, still taking in the sight of his scarred upper body with something akin to horror.
“You’re not going to break me just by being here,” Draco says with a sigh. The words “I can assure you I’m just fine,” are on the tip of his tongue, but even Potter wouldn’t fall for that. He slips his arms under the covers, almost subconsciously. “Why are you here, Potter?”
“Hey.” Potter sidles up to him in the library, smiling because this is what they do now, apparently.
A minute later, Potter pulls the Invisibility Cloak off his head. “How did you know I was here?” He looks slightly put out.
Harry laughs, and he’s still laughing when Draco takes his arm and rubs a salve - a gift from Pansy, one that she’d been giving since sixth year when she found out - into the cut. It wasn’t even that funny; he’s pretty sure Harry’s just laughing for the sake of it, forcing joy into existence. The sound of it is loud and annoying and he wants to kiss him.
Harry shrugs, sitting on Draco’s bed. “Turns out Parselmouths don’t need a password to get in.” He shifts, laying his head on Draco’s chest, and Draco lights up in a blush. “Well, okay, I’m not one anymore but, you know,” he says with a shrug, “you remember things.”
Draco sighs and takes pity on him. “Give me those.” He reaches for the flowers, transfigures a vase, and places them on the nightstand. To Potter’s credit, they are rather lovely, and they smell delightful.
He pulls his sleeves back down when they slide up as he raises his arms to drink. He chases away Pansy’s concerned looks with a joke. He ignores the empty space where Vincent used to sit. It’s almost like nothing’s changed.
His fist meets the shower wall, clinging to the cold, wet tiles. His fingers, spreading open, scramble desperately across the wall as if in an attempt to ground him. The water rains down onto his skin like sharp pellets of hail, cold and unyielding. In one last-ditch attempt to clear his mind, to cut it clean away from his body until he’s blissfully empty, he brings his head to the wall near his hands, reaching for something concrete and cold.
“I didn’t do it on purpose,” Potter says, and deja vu swoops through Draco again when he remembers telling Pansy the exact same thing.
The implications of Potter’s statement seem to dawn on him after a moment. “Oh, um,” he scrambles as if to adjust his glasses, but his arms are still bound to his sides, and he ends up flopping around like a fish. “Not that I was stalking you. Obviously.”
He never intended for it to get this bad. The urge to gain control, the need for release, turned into something more sinister almost immediately.
Draco shifts so the tear leaking out of his eye hits Potter’s shirt instead of his bare skin. “If Granger doesn’t force you to go to a Mind Healer, I will.”
A sound halfway between a laugh and a sob escapes Potter, and he keels over on Draco’s legs, still sob-laughing. A small smile comes to Draco’s face, despite everything.
There’s no blood. He suspects the scratches might bruise, but he doesn’t mind. If he’s lucky, they might obscure the Mark.
His torso is shredded with long scars, over his chest, his upper arms, his stomach; every inch of his skin that could be hidden under a shirt seems to be scarred over. Directly over his heart is one shining, red, oval. Draco’s chest aches at the violence of it, of something long dead but still visible. If there’s any anger left in Draco now, it leaves in the form of a long, shuddering breath.
Rationally, he knew other people would notice. Morbid curiosity and the need to judge always drew people’s eyes to his left arm. Potter’s realization was inevitable.
, not because Potter told him to, but purely because he was bored. “Are you gonna tell me why you’re following me or am I gonna have to steal your wand? Like you stole mine.” Spite forces the last line out. He only half regrets it. If Pansy were here, she’d roll her eyes and call him petty, but she isn’t, so he mentally applauds himself.
Shaking his head slightly, he makes his way out the doors and they walk side by side, hands in their pockets to keep out the cold. Potter shoots him furtive glances every so often as they walk down the snowy paths, but Draco ignores them, wondering vaguely if his strange new behavior is a byproduct of the War.
“Merlin, it’s depressing looking at you. Just come fucking sit already. God.” Why is Potter looking at him like that? He’s supposed to be brash and annoying; now he’s just meek and annoying. It’s off putting.
Draco nudges Potter with a single shiny boot, rather enjoying the change in dynamic. His shadow falls over Potter’s figure, darkening half of his face. “Why are you stalking me, Potter?”
He blinks, still trying to catch up. “Obviously I want, Harry, don’t be daft. You’re so dramatic. Even a Weasley could see that we can’t keep carrying on the way we have.”
He tries to stop, he really does. All throughout Transfiguration, he holds a cube of ice tight in his hand. The harder he squeezes it, the more pain he wrings out, until it’s melted, and he’s shivering, and it’s just
“I’m not planning another murder, if that’s what you were trying to figure out,” Draco says. He keeps his eyes resolutely looking forward, his voice jaded and hard.
They meander through the streets for a while, stopping at colorful storefronts and cracking jokes as if they’d been friends for - well, as if they were friends. Draco side-eyes Potter every now and then, searching his face for clues about what the fuck is going on. Every time, he’s met with a small smile or a quip, or the intentional bumping of Potter’s shoulder into his. By the time they reach Zonko’s, Draco stops overthinking and relishes in the warmth of the sun on his back, on Potter holding the door open for him instead of slamming it in his face with a sneer.
He’s walking back from his bi-weekly Mind Healer session - the ones McGonagall forced him into - when he runs into Granger and Weasley on the stairs. It’s his first reaction to nod politely and step around them, like he’s been doing all year.
Potter shakes his head disbelievingly, turns, and slams the door on his way out without so much as a last glare back at Draco. The bell on the door swings wildly in his wake and Draco slumps against the shelves, deflating the minute Potter stomps out of sight.
He turns back to his textbook, but Potter is still there. “Really?” he says, shock displayed across his face.
“I’m worried, okay?” The words burst out of Potter like it was killing him to hold them in. Draco smirks in satisfaction, moving back to rest on his elbows and allow the light breeze to massage his scalp. “You barely eat at meals, you’re so quiet all the time, and you’ve lost weight-”
On days like these, he remembers the Fiendfyre: all-consuming, a roaring wave of terror so hot his eyes burned. The sight of his own body, falling into a fiery snake’s mouth had flashed before his eyes, almost like a prophecy. But then: a single hand, outstretched and sweaty, and cold air rushing into his lungs.
He picked up the habit halfway through Fourth Year when the stress of school had finally begun to take a toll on him.
