“You’ll figure something out, Harry. I believe in you.” Draco meant it. He knew Harry would find a way, he always would.
“You better get some sleep now, Harry, you’ll have a hard day tomorrow.”
But for now, he was happy to be able to spend even a little time with him. He knew that neither Harry’s friends nor the Slytherins would understand, and he was glad not to have to deal with the inevitable teasing.
“I’m sure we’ll figure out a way to get to his stash. Let’s just meet outside the magic room after class. We’ll have thought of something by then.”
“I’m not fucking around, Diggory. Tell me, or your father can kiss his monthly income goodbye.”
Fleur pulled the girl out of the water. “Gabrielle, ma chérie!” Then she turned to Harry, who struggled on land. “You saved ’er,” she said breathlessly. “Even though she was not your ’ostage.”
“Ohhhhhh my god, get out of here with your silly romance!” Myrtle. They had completely forgotten about the moaning ghost that lived in the bathroom.
And while you're searching ponder this;
“We’ve got a problem, Snape,” said Amycus, her eyes fixating on Dumbledore, “the boy doesn’t seem able —”
“Yes?”, Harry asked.
“Who would want to bathe in that stuff? Doesn’t this just have normal water?” Harry had found a thick brown hot chocolate-fountain.
That word made Draco break down crying. Harry rushed towards him to comfort him, but not before handing Dumbledore the wand Draco had dropped.
“Just one more thing, you two must not utter a word of all this to anyone, not even your friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry. They must believe Severus a traitor, it’s the only way to ensure Voldemort trusts him, and that is vital. You will understand everything soon, I know it’s a lot to ask, but you need to trust me on this. Take this” Dumbledore handed Harry a golden medallion. Then he touched Harry’s arm and looked at him for a long moment “I am sorry it has to be like this, you deserve better. But I fully believe in you, and that you will be able to fulfil the task that rests on your shoulders. Treasure the relationship that you have with Draco, love is such a rare thing these days. I am so incredibly proud of you, Harry. Goodbye.” And with these words, the bubble dissolved. Then everything happened very quickly.
Harry blushed. “And I love you too, which is why I can’t let you risk your life for me”
“I’m sorry Harry. Maybe you thought once that you knew me, but you didn’t. I never was a good person, you never managed to change me, I always had to put my family first. It’s why we had to break up in the first place. We are simply not compatible. I am a bad person, you are not, so get away from here before you get hurt.” Draco wasn’t sure if he believed his own words.
I can’t continue like this, he thought. I have a quest; I can’t abandon my purpose because I’m feeling lovesick.
“There’s no need. I get it. Just don’t forget about me.”
“Harry, my boy, maybe it’s best if you do what Draco asked you to do and leave us here”, Dumbledore proposed. It was very clear that Harry did not like this answer.
Without thinking too much about it, Draco got up and walked up to the first floor. Madam Pomfrey was already hurrying around the room.
Draco and Harry chat about this and that during their hogsmeade da- i mean platonic meetup.
Harry already sat at the table and was talking to Ron and Hermione. Why did he always have to hang out with them? What was so special about a Weasley and a Mudblood?
“But I can see you… You are right… In front of me…”
“But the song-“
“You would risk your life. Your parents’ lives. You would risk everything!” Harry looked at Draco aghast.
What he meant with the bath-thing, Draco didn’t know. Harry and he would have to figure that out.
“What the hell is wrong with him?”, Pansy asked the remaining Slytherins.
Harry took Draco’s arm, picked it up and put it around his body. He snuggled closely to Harry. With any other relationship, Draco would have thought they were moving too quickly. They had only just had their first date and were already cuddling on a sofa. But this was not like any other love, it was different because it was them. They had been pining over each other forever, they had repressed their emotions for so long, they needed some soft, therapeutic cuddles.
Before they were ready to get up, dawn came and they had to hurry back to their dorms.
Draco buried himself in books. It was difficult concentrating on reading knowing that Harry Potter was just behind that bookshelf. He tried his best to ignore the trio’s murmurs. Before he even got properly into his research, it was time to go to class. Over the next weeks, that was how they mostly spent their time together. They still occasionally went on little dates in that magic room, but not as often as Draco would have liked to.
The door appeared again.
“Yeah sorry I just wanted to look after you, you looked a bit stressed out. Can I please come in?”
“Get out of the way, Potter”, Snape spit.
“You have gorgeous grey eyes and I could get lost in their depth over and over again. Every time I look at you, I see something new that I haven’t cherished with all my heart yet. So I relish every pigment of your skin, every one of your golden hairs that surrounds your head like a halo, every long lash around your eyes until there are no more aspects of your beauty to be relished. Then I will worship all of them again.” Draco had never heard anyone say things so romantic, especially not to him. He was lost for words. Harry Potter, the too cool for school boy who lived could not possibly feel about him this way. Being overly soft and corny was his job!
“Eternity sounds way too short a time if that’s all I get to spend with you” Draco pouted.
“Yeah, in a tiny cupboard under the stairs, I didn’t even have a proper room until I got my Hogwarts letter that was addressed to the cupboard.”
Draco stumbles over the perfect place for a date with Harry.
“No, please” How could Harry tease him so mercilessly?
“Hey, don’t pretend you didn’t enjoy it!” Harry teased and put his forehead on Draco’s while closing his eyes.
“A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?”
“Ha, it does. I wouldn’t even dare thinking anything, I mean I basically forgot about that entire thing already. It’s all in the past.” He was rambling, and aware of it. But he couldn’t stop his stupid, apologetic mouth from babbling.
Ashamed of himself, he quickly got dressed and went to talk to her.
“I love you, Draco. I still do. I’ve always loved you, all this time we were apart I have thought about you, longed for you every day. I still love you, you beautiful idiot, now will you please put that wand down.”
“Mr. Malfoy, I’m afraid I must insist. Professor Dumbledore seems to think that you are the best candidate. It will be perfectly safe. No need to worry. You will just sleep for a while.” Draco really didn’t want to do this, but he felt like it was no use arguing with Snape, so he just said nothing.
Every cell in Draco’s body vibrated with agony until it was finally time to sneak out of the dorm. It was quiet, there wasn’t a soul around. The moon shone brightly through the windows.
Draco, I’m kind of embarrassed to ask you this, but hey, you offered, so I’m just accepting your offer, and the whole thing was your idea anyways. I need to learn how to dance, I can’t figure it out by myself. I need your help, so if you’re still okay with teaching me, then please meet me in the Transfigurations room at midnight.
They were both exhausted and laid down on one of the thick, soft towels next to each other.
“Well I guess she won’t shed a tear over you abandoning her tonight.” Draco said with a smug smile.
“Shh, Harry, it will be okay, remember what he told us”, he whispered into his ear.
1994, Draco’s forth year
“Fuck”, Draco yelled out. “Of course I remember. Hell, I wouldn’t ever want to forget. That was the best year of my life, and it all meant the world to me. But now it’s over and the world has changed. It can never be like that again.”
“Dumbledore can protect them, can’t you Professor?”
“Why would they hate you? You are a part of their family!”
How am I going to survive this? What do people even do on dates? Talk? What can Harry and I talk about? We hardly know each other, well getting to know someone is probably the point of a date. No but this isn’t a date, this is just a friendly meeting with a platonic friend.
How was this lad literally always surrounded by a bunch of moronic girls? Draco had been low key stalking Cedric for hours, but he just couldn’t catch him alone. This swarm of giggling airheads was following his every step. Did he never even have to pee?
Aaaaand that's it! That's the last chapter! Thank you for reading, especially for getting through the first few chapters, I know it wasn't easy.
Draco scarfed down his lunch. He wanted to have as much time as possible in the library researching ways to breath underwater. After all, he had promised Harry he would help him.
In Draco’s opinion, he didn’t do too bad, sure, he didn’t follow the rhythm correctly most of the time and messed up some of the lifts quite badly, but at least he didn’t step on Parvati’s feet more than twice. It could have been worse.
“I want to fix it! Of course I did stupid things, I can’t just undo that! I would, but I can’t, not everyone gets a time turner.” Draco’s eyes became wet and his vision started to blur.
“I mean, you’re not that heavy, but I don’t think I can do that, I’m not that strong!”
He practically inhaled his food and then hurried up to the seventh floor. Harry was already waiting for him.
Other students started pouring into the hall, so they had to end their conversation. Draco squeezed Harry’s hand in goodbye and they parted in order to not catch anyone’s, especially not their friends, attention.
“Really??” Draco beamed. “So, it’s official?” He could hardly contain his excitement.
“Sure, wouldn’t want you to throw your back out before the next task!”
“In fact, Mr Potter seems to like you so much, that Dumbledore has chosen you as his… treasure.”
At a quarter to midnight, everything was quiet. Draco got up quietly, he knew that if he made any noise, he would be in trouble. Big trouble. It was almost completely dark, but Draco knew the dungeona well enough to find his way around it without bigger problems.
When Draco arrived at Snape’s office for the second time this day, the professor was already waiting for him.
I just need somewhere to spend some time with him. Alone, away from anyone who’d look at us weirdly. Somewhere we could chat, and maybe dance. A romantic room, candles, the scent of cinnamon and roses in the air, soft jazz playing in the back, maybe something sweet to eat like mousse au chocolat, and a comfy velvet loveseat where we could make out.
“Come on, Ced, tell us!” She looked at him doe-eyed.
“Okay, let’s see if it worked”, he mumbled and opened the door carefully.
Cedric’s face turned bright red. “Yes, but, I mean no, I am NOT allowed to talk about that! Good day Malfoy.” He attempted to leave but Draco grabbed his arm.
It was five in the morning, but Draco was wide awake. His bed felt cold, cold and lonely. The temperature in the dungeons was never very warm and the Slytherins were used to that, but he was not used to the loneliness that was colder than ice.
“Good, good to hear!” An awkward silence arose between the former enemies.
“If you like.” Draco would get to hold Harry again!
They went to a more secluded dance floor where many other couples were slow dancing to romantic soft rock. They didn’t take note of them; they were too busy with their own teenage romance.
“If Draco won’t do it, I’m more than happy to assist”, rasped Greyback.
“No, I know that, and believe me, I’m scared for my life as much as anyone would be. But I’m scared for your life as well. Yours matters more to me than my life.”
“Potter, come to Myrtle’s bathroom, tomorrow at midnight to. Come alone.”
Now he would go down to the Great Hall, making his fairy tale entrance descending the staircase while everyone was watching and envied him for his handsome looks. Harry would wait at the bottom, then hold out a hand which he would gladly accept. They would walk into the Great Hall together, arm in arm, and all the other guests would clap as they danced underneath a chandelier. Or something like that.
“Avada Kedavra” he said and pointed at the bird. A flash of green light hit the bird, and it fell out of the air, dead.
Draco traced the edges of Harry’s face. It was astonishing how beautiful he was.
“Stupefy”, he whispered and pointed his wand at the ghost before the girl could see him. Of course, a bathroom was not a very romantic location for a first date, so he tried his best to clean the place up. He swept the floor and polished the mirrors until everything was neat and shiny.
“And hopefully the cheesiest words I will ever say. I don’t think that overly cutesy stuff fits me.”
He had already disarmed the old man, so what was stopping him from finally doing the deed he had worked for this whole year?
The distance was a mere matter of millimetres now. Draco felt Harry’s breath on his face and gasped for air as he noticed he had forgotten to breathe.
Harry seemed to finally understand. Draco reached out for his hand.
“Promise.”
“Hmm, let me think about it”
So he had decided to end things with Harry right after Dumbledore had announced the return of the Dark Lord. It hadn’t been an easy decision, but it had come quickly to him. It hadn’t felt like a choice anyway. Harry had been painfully understanding. The poor boy had just seen Cedric Diggory die, but he had been composed and level-headed. It had been Draco who had cried. He still felt tears in his eyes when thinking about the breakup.
“Should we take a break?” Draco held him firmly.
“Operation Dance” was not going to well. Draco didn’t have a lot of experience with courtship. None at all, actually. He had never felt any desire to woo a maiden fair. A week had passed since the announcement, and the only interaction he had with his desired mate was a disgusted “Potter”. The boy needed to come up with a plan.
“With aspiratory spells, like I just said. Ten points from Slytherin.”
“We should really hurry up” Harry said. “Dinner’s almost over”
When he walked into the great hall for breakfast, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle, he looked like his typical, smug self. On the inside, however, he was burning with fear and regret.
Draco could still feel Harry’s lips burn on his cheek way after they had parted.
Ron didn’t even reply, he just wanted to go back to his dorm and get out of this horrible cheesy hall filled with gruesomely happy people.
“I don’t know, he didn’t tell me. He just told me to tell you.”
The boy guided him to Professor McGonagall’s class room which they technically were not allowed to enter, but Harry, The Boy Who Lived, Hogwarts Champion, was above the rules, as usual.
“Of course they do, we have an underwater-window in the dungeons from which you can see them sometimes. Not a very social bunch though.”
“Sure, just get on with the teaching and stuff.” He waived his hand impatiently. “Canitis!” A beautiful waltz tune started playing.
Sighing, he got up and got dressed. It would be another dreary day of trying to fix that damned vanishing cabinet.
He had no idea what would happen. Maybe Potter would run away as soon as he recognized Draco. Maybe he would not believe him, maybe he would laugh. Maybe he would tell the teachers. Or maybe, and that was the worst possibility, Potter would never even come.
His classmates stared at him. Draco didn’t care. A few hours ago, he had spent the best night of his life with Harry Potter, whom he would see again very soon.
“You’re right. It sounds pretty exciting, but then again, I do not envy you.” Draco stared straight ahead for a while. “I get that I could never understand what you went through, and boy, I wouldn’t want to, but no eleven-year-old boy should ever have to do what you had to.”
Yeah so this chapter is quite NSFW and a bit kinky. Enjoy!
I do not know if I can ever make up for my behaviour, but if you want to give me a chance, meet me in the forbidden section of the library, at midnight. By now you know who I am, do you not? Please consider my offer anyways, we have a lot to talk about.
At eleven, almost everybody was sound asleep. A few were still chatting in the common room, but they would go to bed soon, at least Draco hoped that they would.
“No, let’s stay here just a little longer…”
“I already am, but, uhm, why are you holding my hand?”
I don’t know if you want to play love, peace and harmony for real or if this is just the most stupid prank you ever wanted to play on me, but fine! I’ll just play along! It’s not like I have a bloody riddle on which my life might depend to solve or anything.
Draco swallowed, and stepped next to Harry. “And me”.
“Sorry I’m a bit late, Peeves was fucking around with our common room, it’s not looking pretty in there, let me tell you!” He had green stuff smeared on his face and looked as if he had just had to fight Voldemort again.
“That’s none of your business! And I could ask you the same!”
Harry grew more and more frustrated by the day. Draco was sure he’d tried his best not let it out on him, but occasionally, he was a bit too harsh. Draco didn’t take offence to that, though, since he could only guess how difficult this situation was for Harry. Soon, January was over, and the second task approached inevitably. The boys still weren’t any closer to finding a way to spend an hour under water.
“Hey, sorry about just running away yesterday. I was just, uhm, not feeling it. Needed some alone-time.” Hopefully, she hadn’t seen him dancing with Harry. The number one rule of school dances was “Never run away from your date and dance with someone else and get caught”.
“Of course I will, you idiot, I love you after all!” Harry laughed out loud and planted a kiss on Draco’s cheek.
Draco meets Harry again and agonizes over the dance.
He was the first student to enter. It was slightly awkward, sitting at the Slytherin table all alone.
The other Slytherins were continuing to throw mockery at him, but Draco just ignored them and went to sleep. After all, he had tomorrow night to look forward to. A little bit of teasing was nothing compared to a night with Harry.
“Okay”, Draco paused for a second to gather the courage to ask him that question. “I was just wondering if, you know, you’d like to maybe go out sometimes?” Whatever happened to not blurting out these highly vulnerable words but instead waiting for a good moment to be 100% sure that Harry would say yes?
“Me too”, Harry said. “I don’t even think I’ve ever seen any.”
As soon as he sat down, he felt something brushing over his back. He turned around and saw Harry walking away from him, making a subtle “follow me”-gesture.
“Of course, uhm, sorry again.” Forcing these words out was immensely painful. A part of Draco died on the word “Sorry”.
They kissed again. This was the most wonderful night of Draco’s life.
“Well, you know, Sir, I guess we just grew out of the childish squabbles.”
“Pff, I sure will. Take care.” Harry squeezed his hand for a second before they had to part. They would see each other soon enough, but neither one of them could concentrate on their classes for the rest of the day.
Harry took a deep breath. He still cringed at the memory of his performance, but Draco’s words were really comforting. Never had he had anyone to talk freely about his feelings. “Thank you Draco. You’re really… kind for helping me.” He managed a grin.
Harry’s face was a mixture of awe and utter horror. “What the heck? Did you decorate this room? How’s it even here?”
With a smirk, Draco covered the cabinet with the cloth again and left the Room of Requirement to write a letter to his father.
“It’s just, like, you like me, I like you, it’s pretty neat” Draco could feel his face burning. He must be scarlet red.
“How does this thing even work?”, Harry asked.
It was time to go to the Great Hall. Well, it was still a little early, but at least he would see Harry walking through the door.
The lovers celebrate Harry's success at the second task.
He was going to catch him after breakfast. It was still the Christmas holidays so they would have plenty of time to hang out. Draco just wasn’t sure what they should do for a date. It wasn’t like they could simply go see a movie or have dinner together since they were kind of locked into Hogwarts. Maybe just asking him to study together would be a good idea since Harry was surely busy with Champion business. But that would neither be unambiguous nor an official date.
“Tell me Ced. Please. I won’t tell anyone, I swear.”
“Yes?” Harry raised an eyebrow. No, I can’t do this right now, we are just friends, you don’t ask your friend to a dance that’s weird.
He pretended to get some ingredients from the student’s store-cupboard, and while walking past Harry, he slipped the note into his pocket. Hopefully he’d notice it.
“Yeah I don’t think he will do that” Harry said, raising his wand in one hand while grabbing Draco’s hand with the other.
“This room didn’t get much prettier since the last time I’ve been here”, Harry murmured.
In the evening, when he was supposed to write a four-page essay for transfigurations, his classmates were talking about the dance.
“Now please, Mr. Malfoy, go down to the Hospital wing, where you will meet the others.”
“Yeah I guess that’s the problem.” Harry’s mouth jerked sadly. “Sorry to be a downer”
Yours faithfully,
Anyways, Draco still got his satisfaction. With his friends Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, he didn’t miss an opportunity to make Potter’s life miserable. It became Draco’s main purpose, he loved to terrorize, torture, and bully Potter and his little friends.
The soft jazz music was still playing in the background.
“Yeah, I’m fine, uhm, I didn’t mean to ki- to fall on you.”
Harry speed-walked to Draco. “Hey”, he said.
“I already miss you. See you tomorrow? Or, well I mean today, in the afternoon sometimes?” Draco asked.
It took Draco a second to take note of Harry’s words and another one to come to terms with the moment between them being over, in the past, a distant memory.
What Draco didn’t know just yet was how infatuated Harry was with him. Ever since he declined the boy’s offer of friendship on the Hogwarts Express, he had thought that Draco despised him because of it. Harry didn’t want him to be his enemy, he had never wanted to. He had just never had the guts to do what Draco had done and ask him to let the past go. He was fascinated by the other boy’s sudden affection.
“Uhm, detention”, was the best Draco could come up with. Moody didn’t really seem to believe them.
“So, uhm, did you figure out your egg thing yet?” Draco made another attempt at friendly conversation.
A part of Draco wished Harry would just acknowledge their budding relationship in public. All this secrecy was no way to live!
“About what?” Harry rolled his eyes. “That you should be Hogwarts Champion, or your regrets about me not being eaten by that Horntail?”
He opened the door from the inside. “Yes, hey, thanks for coming. I found this amazing room, you’re going to like it!” He took Harry’s hand and led him inside.
“Okay, sounds good.” Harry bit his lip. Why did he do that? “Would be a shame if we studied in Hogwarts for years without ever getting to enjoy the scenery!”
“Are you quite alright Draco? Did he confund you?”, Alecto said with some real concern in her voice.
At least, he walked down the staircase and some people looked at him. Not in awe, more like annoyed and disinterested. Pansy, not Harry, was waiting for him. He didn’t see Harry anywhere. He was probably already in the hall preparing for the dance.
The music started and Harry still looked at Draco’s face when Parvati got his attention by loudly whispering “Take my waist”, audible to most people. Luckily, Harry didn’t have enough time to worry about that embarrassing moment, since the most embarrassing moment of the evening had just begun: The dancing.
Just a head's up - this chapter is a tiny bit NSFW at the end. But we both know that's what you're here for, aren't you?
“I swore an unbreakable vow to your Mother that I would do the deed should you not be able to do it yourself” Snape explained to Draco.
“Screw you, don’t pretend you’re sorry. You already hated me the first time you saw me.” Harry crossed his hands in front of his chest and took a deep breath.
“Wow, we should all know that Hufflepuffs are beneath the great Harry Potter!”
Fenrir Greyback grabbed Draco’s shoulder. “Pull yourself together and do it, boy.”
Their feet stepped the right steps at the same time, their hands held at the right height, their arms were tense, Harry held Draco’s body close enough to his. It looked like they were a couple that goes to dancing classes every week. Somehow, Harry even got the lift right. If he would do this well with Parvati, there was nothing to worry about.
“Yeah” said Harry. Draco could see he was regretting not leaving the girl in the lake. Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek. Harry’s head turned scarlet, and Draco could feel jealousy burn in his chest. Before Fleur could say anything else, he took Harry’s hand and pulled him towards Madam Pomfrey.
Draco slowly lowered his wand.
Pansy gave him a doubting look. “Well then ask him out, officially and unambiguously, silly. We both know you want to, what are you waiting for?”
“Child endangerment is what I call this! There is absolutely no reason to use students for this. Why not just let them bring up some jewellery?” She kept on rambling for several more minutes.
The classes passed in a blur, and before he knew, he was in the magic room which he now knew was the Room of Requirement again. Every time he entered it, he was painfully reminded of his and Harry’s time there together. But that didn’t matter now, all that mattered was fixing the cabinet. He had tried for months. He had even given up and thought of other ways to kill Dumbledore, but none had worked. The necklace had cursed Katie Bell, and the mead had only poisoned Weasley. He was out of options. The cabinet was the only way.
“You… these were the nicest words anyone has ever said to me.” Draco couldn’t think of a nearly as eloquent confession of love.
- Harry
“Mr Malfoy.” Snape looked at him with a stern face.
“And now, since the whole school knows anyways, you know, why not...” The words seem to be stuck somewhere in his throat.
“Tell me about it. You don’t know how nice you have it. How peaceful it must be without constant eminent mortal danger!”
“I do”, said Dumbledore firmly “And I will die soon anyways” He pointed to his blackened hand. “The curse is spreading. I doubt I have more than a week left”
Draco blushed. “We really don’t want to bother you, Myrtle. Let’s go somewhere else” he pulled Harry out of the bathroom. Why did that ghost have to ruin their moment?
“Who else is here?” Draco already knew the answer. There was only one person who would be out with Dumbledore and could turn flawlessly invisible.
Draco stormed out and started to walk away. Halfway down the first staircase, he thought to himself that if Hogwarts had a perfect room for him and Harry to become closer, he might as well use it. He rushed back to see a perfectly plain wall. No door whatsoever.
Draco heard his teacher’s voice as if his head was wrapped in cotton. Something about a dance, at Christmas. Wonderful. As if he didn’t have enough problems already. Now he had to try and get a bloody date! He knew that most Slytherin girls would be more than flattered to go to the dance with him, but there wasn’t one girl he could stand to spend an entire evening with. In fact, he was by far not as fond of girls as the other boys his age were. He didn’t really care about any of them.
“Aw that sucks” Draco faked compassion. Fuck you Chang you don’t bloody deserve him. Diggory is a dumb cunt anyways.
1990, Draco’s first year
“Good evening, Draco”, Dumbledore said. How was he so calm? Draco looked around to ensure that he and Dumbledore were alone. It seemed like it, but there was a second broom on the floor next to Dumbledore.
“No problem.”, the pale, but somewhat blushing boy replied. “I hope you’ll feel better soon.”
“Sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose.”
“If that means helping you defeat him, it’s worth it.” Draco said firmly.
“Maybe we should get back into the dormitories”, Draco murmured, breaking the silence.
“I’ve never been in a swimming pool at all.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Actually I wanted to ask you- “
They stood there like that, in a tight hug, Harry crying, for many minutes until Harry pulled away from Draco and sat down on the sofa. Draco hesitated for a moment, then sat down next to him. They sat there quietly for close to half an hour.
"Harry? Since when do you call me by my first name, Malfoy?"
Draco did as he was ordered and laid down. He tried to breathe calmly and not think of the repercussions of what he was about to do. Then Dumbledore said a spell, and everything became dark.
“Uhh, thank you?” Harry blushed. “You too.”
“Fleur? You mean you and… Fleur Delacour?” Draco was perplexed, he did not expect that.
Yay you made it this far!! Congratulations, from now on, the writing is much better. So you might actually enjoy this chapter!
“Harry, please, don’t make this harder than it has to be”. Draco was close to crying. Harry was right, but he had to try to convince him that he wasn’t. He had to leave so that Draco could finally do the deed. But Harry didn’t even think to give up on him.
It was visible that Harry felt stupid and embarrassed.
A susurrant cover of Aerosmith’s I Don't Want to Miss a Thing came on and Draco led Harry to the middle of the dance floor. In this moment, they didn’t care what the others thought of them. They hardly even acknowledged their presence. The only thing Draco’s eyes saw was Harry’s handsome face.
But past an hour, the prospect's black,
“Yeah you’re right. I had a nice time anyways. It’d be fun to meet up again sometimes.”
“Thank you, Draco, that’s really kind of you.” More awkward silence between the two boys.
Underneath the cloak, they snuck up to the fifth floor of the Hospital Tower. With a shaky hand, Harry opened the door.
“More… harder…”, he whimpered. The whip cracked again. And again. Briefly, Draco thought about how his butt must be scarlet red by now, but another crack of the whip snapped him out of that train of thought.
“You know, I didn’t have the nicest of childhoods either. Have you ever met my father?”
And with these words, he passed out.
“Malfoy”
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, what are you doing in there?”, Professor Moody did not seem pleased to catch them exiting a colleague’s office. Harry quickly slipped the Gillyweed into his pocket.
“Well, Slytherin has some airhead girls who care about this stuff, too.”, Draco said in a dry tone. That triggered a little chuckle in Harry, so he was just teasing earlier, thank god! “So you are not going then?”
“No choice? That’s bullshit, Draco, you don’t need to do this. You’re better than this. I know you are, or at least, I knew you once.” It wasn’t lost on Draco that Harry had used his first name once more. It had been a long time since he had heard him use it.
Even though he knew it was hopeless, he decided he would.
Apparently Diggory had figured out the second task already and was way ahead of Harry. Probably not something he should mention if he wanted to be successful with asking him out.
They walked next to each other in silence for a few minutes. It was painfully awkward.
Supposedly, he also killed a troll that was about to eat a helpless girl, defeated a 3-headed dog, and found a way to get rid of Filch’s feared cat Mrs. Norris, and all that in just a few months. Potter didn’t miss an opportunity to win glory.
“I hope so. Anyways, thanks for dropping that cursed thing, without you I would have never figured that out.” Harry smiled at him and swam closer. “But we still have lots of time here, what’d you say, shall we make the best of it?” Teasingly, he brushed his hand over Draco’s face.
When they had classes together, he could hardly follow the teachers anymore. Draco felt as if he was bewitched. He spent every second awake thinking about Potter. He didn’t even leave him alone while he was asleep, the bastard. But the dreams were a beautiful escape. They were so realistic that Draco started wishing to be with Harry like that in real life as well.
Never before had Draco allowed himself to be this vulnerable, especially not in front of people. Harry cleared his throat.
“Why the hell did you want to talk to me? Is that one of your dirty little tricks?” Malfoy thought of hundreds of things he could say – cheeky comments about what dirty tricks he knew, soft compliments, or medieval-style confessions of his love – but not a word left his lips.
Still, their goodbye kiss left a bitter taste in Draco’s mouth. However, he already knew how he would solve this problem. He would, whatever the cost, get Cedric Diggory to tell him what the last task was.
“No worries, good to see you. And snail- what?”
“Uhm, you know, chill… and stuff”, Draco replied, blushing. They started to chat about this and that. Harry talked about his friends Ron and Hermione quite a lot, and despite not understanding why someone as perfect as him would ever spend time with a Weasly and a Mudb-, a Muggleborn, Draco listened eagerly. Draco got to vent a bit about his father’s big expectations and his mother’s concerning drinking habits. Then, suddenly, silence ensued. It wasn’t the uncomfortable silence from earlier, no, it felt warm and comforting. Draco felt at peace.
Draco made a “Pff” in disbelief. “So why did you even bring her? Don’t you think that maybe she wants to dance? Quite the gentleman, Weasley.”
All his emotions and feelings were hidden behind the mean, sarcastic smile Draco wore like a mask.
“Sure.” He gave him a quick peck at the cheek. “Have fun in Potions!”
Interesting, if that were true, Harry would have the same following. He didn’t, right? Draco would have noticed that. Nevertheless, a little jealousy nipped at his stomach. “Ah, of course. I guess you’re doing a pretty good job at it?”
Somehow, they managed to get closer and closer to each other with every song and at some point, while Elton John was playing, Harry’s head ended up resting on Draco’s shoulder.
“What? Yeah, I mean now I am” She looked mighty pissed off. He hadn’t even said goodnight to her yesterday, he realised, he had just ran away to look for Harry. He had treated her the same way he had criticised Harry and Ron for treating their respective dates.
“Malfoy?” Draco’s presence didn’t exactly cheer Ron up.
“These”, Harry cleared his throat. ”These hills are really pretty”
“Racing. It’s a thing muggles do for fun.”
“Y-you do? After all this time?”
“I’m sure Professor Snape has some in his private cupboard” Draco pondered.
There were only a few that Draco could talk to openly. His Slytherin friends didn’t like Potter either, but mainly because of the Quidditch-loss he caused them. No one had a reason to truly despise, to hate him, like Draco did.
“Yes I know, he is like, so overrated, and that hair, he really needs to be given a haircut – with a sword”
Laying in his bed, he replayed their meeting over and over again in his head. Then it suddenly struck him: Harry had called him “Draco”.
Draco had missed breakfast, because he had spent his morning fantasising about Harry Potter, so he had to wait until lunch to catch him.
“Wait a second, I’m getting dizzy!” Harry stopped to turn. “Whoa, all this spinning, it’s intense!” He lost his balance and Draco had to keep him from falling.
The whole way back to the common room, Draco pondered about their breathing problem. The answer had to be in some book somewhere. They had already worked their way halfway through the library, but without success. If only there was a way to make that one book with the answer appear out of nowhere. Wait! Draco stopped dead in his tracks. He’d just had a brilliant idea.
Come seek us where our voices sound,
Poor Pansy seemed to notice that he was not really focussed on dancing and pulled him to the edge of the dance floor. “Let’s sit down for a minute, shall we?”, she said and released Draco from the burden of having to pretend to be engaged in their awkward slowfox.
“Yes, and we should both really go back to our dorms now, seriously.”
Draco opened it. A bunch of topless, life-sized Harry Potter cardboard cut-outs stared at him seductively. Wow, maybe he got side-tracked while decorating his dream date-room. He’d have to be more careful next time.
“Severus…” It was a sound scarier than anything. Dumbledore, pleading. Draco couldn’t have imagined it.
If not for himself, for Harry.
“Why didn’t you ask her to come as well? It would kind of make sense to practise with the person you will open the dance with.”
“Ah, Mr Malfoy, welcome, and thank you for your participation!”, Dumbledore greeted him. Draco looked around the room. The others were Granger, Cho Chang, and a little, eerily beautiful girl who looked a lot like Fleur Delacour.
They had spent several more afternoons like this over the rest of the Christmas Holidays and enjoyed each more than the last. Draco got quite creative, decorating the room a little differently each time. No important conversations were going on during these dates. Sometimes they were dancing, sometimes they were teasing each other, sometimes they were gossiping, and sometimes they were just lying on the soft red carpet listening to the soft music.
Draco made a decision. He would not mourn long lost times; he would concentrate on the Here and Now.
Ugh so I know the writing in this is still a bit cringy, but you're almost at the part where it gets good! Don't give up now!!
Draco practised two more times, and, for the hell of it, imagined a pink cyberpunk room full of kittens and robots taking care of them while David Bowie’s Let’s Dance was playing on repeat. It was beautiful. He spent over an hour in there, petting kittens and singing along. Maybe he would show this room to Harry sometimes as well. For tonight, though, they would spend time in the other room, if Harry would say yes, that is. Now Draco just needed to wait for the proper moment to ask Harry Potter out. He needed to make sure to not blurt anything out, and only ask him when he was 100% sure he would say yes.
Harry stepped closer. “Hey, it’s okay” he took his hand again. “Thank you for being there for me. You’re a damn better friend than my supposedly best friends.” He pulled him into a hug. It wasn’t the awkward hug he expected. It was a warm, soft, comforting hug. Not in any way unpleasant for either one of the two.
Harry cleared his throat “So, it’s one, two, three, right?” He shoved their bodies around clumsily.
However, after all the time it became more and more tiring to pick on the glorious “Hogwarts Trio”, and Draco didn’t try to bully Potter with all his heart anymore.
“At least? You can’t tell me that Draco “Poshest of Posh Boys” Malfoy didn’t get everything he ever wanted.” Harry surely meant this in a teasing way, but it was still a bit hurtful for Draco.
We've taken what you'll sorely miss
“You know, about us… and stuff” Draco shrugged. Why did the words he wanted to say not come out?
“Well, uhm, I would start with… Flea legs?”
Draco thinks of a creative solution to Harry's breathing problem.
“I’ll think about it. It’s really late now.”
Draco had regained enough composure to stop crying.
These random facts about muggles never failed to amaze Draco. No wonder Muggle Studies was an actual class at Hogwarts.
Draco hurried out of the classroom. Just before the entry to the Great Hall, he ran into Harry, who was with Granger and Weasley.
“Well it was a good start”, Draco remarked. “With a little more practice, you could do it.”
“Wow, that’s messed up. I mean I at least had a room”
“And the lakes look really nice.”
Draco's face turned red. If he could just find the right words to say. If he could just say any coherent string of words. But he was just overwhelmed with anxiety, frustration because of Potter's refusal to listen, and something else that he still could not quite put his finger on. Was it... lust?
Out again. And then he felt a slight pain as something really big entered him. That must be it, finally. Harry thrust his pelvis against Draco again and again. Draco could hear Harry’s moans get louder and louder. He could hardly contain himself, so he bit into the pillow to keep himself from screaming.
They never wanted that night to end, but at around three in the morning they decided to sneak back into their dorms. They couldn’t risk falling asleep here and getting caught not being in their beds in the morning.
At least he said he would come. Hopefully that meant alone, like Draco asked him to.
Draco wasn’t so sure about that. Was this the best they could come up with? However, it was the night before the task and they had already run out of other options.
Then – God was real – he saw Harry enter, also alone. When their eyes met, it was a moment of mutual understanding. They both went to lunch extra early to have a chance to talk alone. Because they were obsessed with each other.
“No, I hate this stupid thing. It just screeches incomprehensible stuff. It makes my ears bleed if I try to listen to it for too long. Even Hermione can’t figure it out.”
The Corridors were dark and silent. Or were they? He was sure he heard steps somewhere. Please don’t be Filch, I can’t deal with him right now, this night was way too great to end in detention… He was in luck, theses weren’t the usual scuffing steps of the caretaker.
“About what?”
The castle was completely empty. At night it was hard to believe that there were ever people in the old corridors. Not even the ghosts were floating through the walls.
“Uhm, almost, just try not to move like a Lumberjack and more like a … graceful swan!”
They both dived down together and listened to the whole sing-song.
A few seconds passed. Their hearts were beating loudly. Draco was slightly dizzy from the tension in the room.
“Oh my God. Now we just have to find some!” Harry’s green eyes were illuminated by that fire Draco had missed so dearly over the last few weeks.
“Yeah, sure. And, also, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about this, but, uhm, the thing that happened. That was just an accident, right?” Harry was talking about the kiss. Well, the almost-kiss, but their lips had touched.
“The world doesn’t revolve around you”, Draco was fighting back tears and his voice was threatening to break. “Yes, He killed your parents, but yours is not the only family who suffered in the war!” This was the first time that Harry truly looked at Draco. He noticed the red of the pale boy’s cheeks, the teary eyes, the way his lower lips were slightly trembling. In this moment, Harry started to believe that Draco didn’t mean any harm.
“Okay, then I’ll ask not so nicely. Your dad has a nice job at the Ministry, right? Would be a shame if my father were to hear about a certain disagreement I had with Amos Diggory’s son. The minister is very fond of my father’s opinion on his staff.” Draco had almost forgotten how much he enjoyed blackmailing people and just being a dick in general, even though an unfamiliar voice in his mind reminded him about how morally wrong this was.
“I said I’d do something I really wanted to do!” Harry beamed with joy.
“What are you doing, weeping like a babe about things you can’t change? If the Dark Lord could see you like this, what would he think? Get your goddamned arse up, before I kick it for you! My son, MY son does not weep”. Then he would slap his face.
Pansy sighed. “Snape is looking for you. You’re supposed to come to his office right away.”
All the other students seemed to love Potter. He was not exactly handsome, but still, the little girls couldn’t stop giggling and blushing when he walked past them.
Am I crazy, he asked himself. He decided to take a look inside.
Harry attempted to smile, but it looked more like a grimace. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t bother you with all this. You have your own problems.” His green eyes looked watery, like he would start to cry any moment.
That truly wasn’t much to work with. “Heyyy... So that dance… Sure was something.”
“I just… I just felt like everyone was constantly looking at me and making fun of me for messing up at the opening.” Harry avoided eye contact and bit his lip.
See you at midnight, asshole.
“I promise.” He took Harry’s hand and kissed it softly. “You are my forever, Harry. We can do this, together. If there is one thing that you-know-who is afraid of, it’s love, and our love is stronger than anything. He doesn’t stand a chance.”
Snape nodded.
"I.. I just wanted to talk to you. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
No, cross that, he could not start that over the top, he needed Harry to take the letter seriously!
“Wow, Harry, look at this! This is it!” Draco couldn’t believe his eyes. “It says here that Gillyweed is a magical plant that, when eaten, allows a human to breathe underwater. When Gillyweed is eaten by a human, it gives them fish-like attributes, including gills to process oxygen from water, webbing between the fingers and toes for easier swimming, removing the need for blinking, and adapting to cold temperatures in water. While under the effects of Gillyweed, one cannot breathe air with their lungs. There is some debate among Herbologists as to the duration of the effects of Gillyweed in fresh water versus salt water, but in fresh water, a sprig of Gillyweed lasts for well over an hour.” Draco looked at Harry triumphantly.
Apologetically, Draco raised his hands.
“Potter”, he spat.
“Aw, are you nervous dancing with a girl?” why did he say that, he sounded like those assholes who freak out if a boy touches a pink shirt.
Two hours until the ball started. Two hours, and Draco hadn’t even begun to get ready yet. Christmas day had been relatively uneventful; he had gotten his presents and letters from his family. Apparently, they missed him. Funny, because usually the holidays were the worst time of the year since he was forced to spend it with his relatives. Being around his father for weeks was draining. He had written a polite thank you note to his mother, hoping she hadn’t drowned herself in eggnog before it arrived.
Yes, that was more like it. That letter won’t scare Harry away. Hopefully. But it was an honest attempt at extending an olive branch, and that was the best Draco could do.
It was the night after Dumbledore’s funeral. They had met up afterwards, the first time they had seen each other since the battle of the astronomy tower. Since Dumbledore’s death. Draco had never cared that much for the whimsical, old professor, but he knew Harry had had a profound relationship with the man, so his heart cried on his behalf.
Harry, Granger and Weasley were already at the library when Draco got there. Harry’s green eyes briefly met his as he entered, but the dark-haired boy didn’t acknowledge him. Draco knew it was for the best of both of them, but it still stung a little.
Draco froze as an insane idea formed in his head.
“I mean, those Dementors last year were pretty scary for all of us.”
“So you couldn’t possibly tell me anything about that? Come on Ced, we both know you figured it out, you smart boy!”
Malfoy,
It was about a minute to midnight.
“Good. I’d love to as well.”
“Shut up, someone might hear us!” Alicia was in obvious agony. She was less than pleased about being caught off guard.
Draco dreaded the holidays. Especially now that his parents were disappointed that Potter was the Hogwarts Champion instead of Draco. He always envied Harry who could just stay at Hogwarts.
“Thank you, Draco. Thank you for being there for me”
“Yeah that’s me. So, where’s your date? If I were you, I wouldn’t miss the chance to dance with Padma Patil!”
“Shut up, I don’t even need a date, dances are for girls and babies anyways. I don’t even want to go.”
“No. It can’t be, I don’t want to believe it”
“Take off those pants”, Harry whispered in his ear. Draco immediately jumped up to comply. The few seconds he needed to wrestle out of his pants felt like an eternity. He took his shirt off as well, for good measure.
“Wow, I don’t know what to say…” Draco blushed again.
He wondered if Harry would give a rose to Parvati, and if, which colour would it be? He probably wouldn’t, Draco didn’t think him much of a romantic. It wasn’t even Parvati, Harry’s actual date, but Cho Chang he was jealous of. He knew that Harry didn’t really want anything from Parvati apart from a partner to open the ball with. But with Cho, things were different. It had been school gossip for a while that Potter had a crush on Chang, and judging by how jealous he was of Cedric, that rumour was to be believed.
So that’s what prostate stimulation feels like, he thought.
“Uhhm” he had absolutely no clue.
Potter was the youngest Quidditch player for 100 years and in his first game, he caught the snitch spectacularly, leading the Gryffindor team to victory.
They played around for a bit, trying to push each other’s heads underwater and competitively holding their breath.
“I’ve never had a proper New Year’s Eve, you know” Draco said while massaging Harry’s shoulders which were a bit sore from the energetic dancing.
“Oh shut up you beautiful idiot”, Harry giggled “Well be together until time itself ends”
“Oh, you want me to use that?” Harry grabbed the whip and brushed over Draco’s backside with it. The leather was cold. Then he cracked it and Draco felt a beautiful pain like never before. Now the whip didn’t feel cold at all, no, it burned.
“You don’t know what you’re saying. He will know you betrayed him. He will want revenge.”
“What did I just say, Baldock! I don’t want a date. I don’t need to talk to you fools. Good night.” He stomped out of the common room and buried his face into his pillow. Bloody jokers, always making fun of him. He would show them. He would go to the ball with the Hogwarts Champion who turned away girl after girl.
“Come, let’s get you a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, you look like you could use it.”
Before he could make up his mind, the bell rang and Harry left the room swiftly as a deer. Well that relieved him of the burden of choice. Frustrated as he was, he packed his books into his bag a bit too eagerly and dropped his edition of An Anthology of Eighteenth Century Charms. When he had picked it up, he was the last person in class, apart from Binns, who seemed to be lost in his own thoughts. As he passed Harry’s desk on his way out, he noticed a crumbled piece of parchment. With shaking hands, he picked it up. He didn’t have the guts to read it in front of Binns, or in the hallway, or anywhere around people, so he rushed to the bathrooms and locked himself into one of the stalls. His heart was almost jumping out of his chest as he unfolded the note.
They walked back to the square in silence.
Silence. Did the other person notice him? There was nowhere to hide, so he decided to tiptoe forwards.
When they reached “2”, Harry put his hand on Draco’s neck and pulled him into a passionate kiss. There were fireworks, both outside the window and in Draco’s heart. He had not expected that. Time seemed to stand still. Draco could taste Harry’s lips, feel his tongue with his tongue, hear his breath. He dug his hand deeper into the dark, messy hair and never wanted this moment to end.
“The song was only to ensure you’d take the task seriously and get back in time! You weren’t supposed to play the hero!”
Finally, their lips brushed over each other. There was no audible sound, no visible spark, but in their hearts, in their souls, the most colourful fireworks danced in the black night sky. It was better than Draco ever imagined, and it wasn’t even a real kiss. Just the brief, delicate contact of two soft pieces of skin connected to two different bodies that could easily be brushed off as unintentional, but they both knew it wasn’t. That knowledge, however, didn’t change the fact that, for some reason psychologically related to forced masculinity, a touch of internalised homophobia and the fear of being honest with one’s self, they felt the need to pretend it was.
But Amycus’ wasn’t the voice that sent chills down Draco’s spine.
The mudblood probably taught him. But how did they know that he would need that spell?
Harry started taking off his clothes, revealing tight red swimming shorts underneath. Draco just stared at him.
“Well she is a nice girl, and very… pretty.”
“Sure, goodnight” Still baffled, he entered the dorms. The entire school was getting more and more curious every day since the Triwizard Tournament had started.
“Why were you even looking for me?”, Draco attempted to change the topic.
When Potter stepped on the field, Draco could tell easily that the black-haired boy couldn’t really comprehend how dangerous the situation was. He stood there alone, with just his wand. It was impossible that a fourteen-year-old could cast spells that were powerful enough to trick a dragon and steal the golden egg in its nest.
The beginning of the fifth year had been awkward, but they both survived. After a while, they both adjusted back into their old rivalry. Even if it had been oddly painful to bully Harry. But it was necessary, he couldn’t let the Dark Lord think he had any sort of affection for him. Even if he couldn’t rip that affection, that longing, that passion out of his heart. The heart wants what it wants.
If you want to accept this peace offering and give me another chance, meet me in the forbidden section of the library, at midnight.
While gazing at Dumbedore with a look that spoke of more pure hatred that words ever could, Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.
“Okay, well, I taught you the steps, and you did alright, considering you never danced before. The lifting should be fine with a skinny girl. I mean I’d be happy to practise but..”
“Wow.” That was all he could say, and Draco didn’t react much more eloquently.
“Nonsense!” shrieked Alecto. “Just kill him already! Do it or stand aside so one of us —” The door to the ramparts burst open once again and Professor Snape had arrived. He clutched his wand and examined the four Death Eaters standing around Draco and Harry and Dumbledore leaning against the wall.
“What is happening here, Draco? What are you doing? Why haven’t you killed him yet?”, Amycus Carrow asked accusingly. Draco couldn’t control his sobs well enough to reply.
“So, what’s this idea you’ve had?”, he asked sceptically.
He excused himself and went to look for Harry. At the very back of the room, he spotted Weasley seemingly dying inside. Even though it wouldn’t lead to anything, he went over to talk to him.
“Open the ball? Wow, what a responsibility!” That was the best he could do. He knew that there was no chance of Harry taking him to the ball now, he would not want to debut on the traditional yule ball with Draco Malfoy in front of everybody. Especially not in front of Granger and Weasley.
“Yes, please, I need it…”
It was awfully quiet in the room. He pulled the cloth cover off the cabinet. Wait, was it actually quiet, or did he just hear something? No, there definitely was a noise. A chirping of sorts. It couldn’t be- or could it? Holding his breath, he opened the cabinet. With a flapping noise, a bird flew out. This was it! The bird had come from the other cabinet at Borgin and Burkes, there was no other way. That means he had done it. The cabinet was working. He caught the bird with a magic spell, locked it into the cabinet, and sent the bird into the other cabinet. When he opened the door, it was gone. A few moments later, it flew out of the cabinet again. Draco couldn’t believe it. He had finally done it. Now there was nothing stopping him from finally executing his plan. He would invite the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and then kill Dumbledore. He just needed to wait for the perfect moment.
“I’m giving up. Maybe it’d be for the best if I just drowned, who would even care?” Harry angrily punched the pink wall of their secret room. It was the 22nd of February, two days before the second task, and they still hadn’t been successful.
“You like that?” Harry asked, and Draco only managed to wordlessly nod in response. Draco felt Harry drag his fingernails down his back and towards his butt. Then he felt a sharp pain as Harry slapped his but hard. He let out a groan. How could pain feel so good? More pain, more glimpses of heaven. If only Harry slapped him even harder, if only he had a whip. Suddenly, a black leather bullwhip materialized out of thin air right next to them. Ah right, the magic room…
“You’ll do great. That last try was basically perfect.”
“Good. I’m glad to hear that. And uhm, if you need to talk about anything, just hit me up, okay, because I doubt that you can have sincere conversations with the Slytherins.” A knot formed in Draco’s stomach. He had never talked about his childhood and even now that Harry offered to listen, he didn’t know if he would ever be able to.
“Yeah, but that’s with you, with Parvati it’s, I don’t know, not that easy.”
Draco’s heart felt as if it was about to jump out of his chest. Awkwardly, he began to undress as well.
“Who says it can never be like that again?” Harry took a step towards Draco. “Draco, I would give everything for it to be like it was. I’d personally kill you-know-who for you if that meant we could be together again.”
Draco couldn’t help but giggle as they pulled Fleur’s sister toward the bank. Maybe Harry had behaved a little stupid, but that was just what he loved about him. His brave hero, his saviour…
“How could you ask her to the dance!” a shrill voice rang through the hall. Some Gryffindor girl, Draco didn’t know her nor did he care, was apparently not too happy with one of her house mates asking another student to the dance. Whew, apparently all that drama wasn’t because of the letter, Draco thought and eventually remembered how to breathe again.
Since he was out of breath, he had to come back up for air. “Harry, get your head under water”, he gasped. “That was the trick all along, you have to listen to it underwater.”
Draco jerked his hand away “Sorry! I didn’t mean to!”
Draco sulks about being rejected by Harry and then comes up with a new plan.
“How’s it going”, the perfect, most boring conversation opener when you have nothing to talk about.
They sat down on the maybe a bit too small couch, so their thighs were pressed together by the sheer lack of space. An awkward silence ensued.
