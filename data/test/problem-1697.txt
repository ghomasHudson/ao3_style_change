And then he thought of Jude, and thought that maybe he had tried to do just that. And, maybe he hadn’t been perfect at it, but he could try again. If Harry was good at nothing else, it was trying again.
“Yeah,” Ginny nodded. “I think they want to do something quiet at the end of the summer, but every time I talk to her about it the guest list keeps getting longer. I think they’re going to have to push it back.”
Hermione seemed to accept that answer, and left him to assemble the laptops while mulling over a lunch invitation. Draco accepted all of her lunch invitations that last week. They went to a pub on Monday, and Hermione complained about the lack of curry (which she was still eating three or four times a week). Draco suggested a sandwich shop on Tuesday which saw them all crowded on a bench in a park enjoying the sunshine. That was the day Astoria had owled, and Draco spent several hours that evening considering his response. He wanted to inform her of his decision without sounding like he was rejecting her, and that was a thin line to walk. She replied right away saying that she understood and hoped they would remain on good terms. A polite and distant response that Draco was grateful for.
“It needs a bandage so it doesn’t get infected,” she said, her voice low and soothing, and Draco couldn’t remember the last time someone had spoken to him like they cared. He put his right hand in his lap.
She read over her memos while Draco wrote out his ingredients. It took ten minutes, but then they were stepping out into the hall. Draco clasped one wrist tightly in the other hand behind his back and squeezed hard, the pain cutting through his anxiety. Which was growing as they approached the destroyed lab. Granger left him at the open door.
“I’m sorry." She had the decency to look truly apologetic to the floor, "I was just going to say that I may have overheard him making a reservation at the Leaky,” she said quietly.
After setting a tray on the table, Ginny perched herself prettily on his lap, and Harry turned his head just slightly to keep her hair out of his face while he took a drink. It gave him a clear look at Neville and Hannah who were holding hands with cheeks that were quite pink, but more importantly, he could just barely see the door.
He listened hard to the house, for a telltale squeak, a muffled shout, the brush of feet on carpeting. There was nothing, and Harry tried to keep his breathing soft and even through his nose, tried to tune out the thumping in his chest, to ignore the knowledge that Greyback might come through the door at any moment.
Sophie waggled her shoulders and gripped the broom to sing into it. “I ain’t got cash, I ain’t got cash” she looked meaningfully at Draco, “I got you, baby!”
“Just when I turned around. Oh god, Bill is going to be a mess,” George said suddenly. “Fleur said he positively raged, tore up her begonias and everything after they found the first one. And now there’s one in the shop!” He clenched his hands tightly. “Those bastards.”
Harry sank to his knees on the cold kitchen tile. “Maybe.” His hand wrapped around Draco’s cock. “Maybe I just want you.” He licked the head experimentally, and then sucked Draco down all the way. Draco sank his hands in Harry’s hair, holding tight.
Because Draco touched him sometimes now, let his fingers rest on top of Harry’s when they talked about Maddox wanting to get into Magical Games and his parents wanting him to help run the family store. He came out from behind the counter and sat on the stool next to Harry, letting their knees brush as Harry talked about June fighting with her father who was muggle and didn’t understand why she didn’t want to go to University like other kids her age.
“Okay.” Malfoy pulled himself up. He grabbed onto Harry’s sleeve as Harry passed by. And then Malfoy trailed after him much like a child might, as Harry pulled a can of soup from the cabinet. He held on as Harry got out butter and cheese and bread. It was difficult to cut the cheese with Malfoy attached to his arm, but when Harry looked at white knuckles of his death grip, he didn’t suggest Malfoy let go.
Hermione pulled back from him, and Ron sat down on the bed next to her, close to Harry, close enough to run his hand down Harry’s arm.
Harry let out a disgruntled sigh. It was familiar because it was what Draco had said, a lonely ex-Death Eater with no one else to talk to. Did everything lead back to Draco? He threw the file down on his desk
Malfoy turned back. “Yes. I have. I had it a few minutes ago. Or was it hours? I’m not sure any more.” He chewed on his thumb.
“Yes, but if she sleeps too long here, we might not be able to get her back to sleep at home,” Hermione said.
“Uh, yeah, this is Detective Potter, I was hoping to speak with Mr. and Mrs. Green about their son Sawyer.”
He burst through her door, startling Hermione into dropping her biro and clutching her wand. “Merlin, Harry, you scared me.”
“Then I guess, you will just have to wait until one of your people manages to crack the code on my journals.” Draco leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. His stomach was cramping again, and his fingers itching, and the urge to throw furniture was barely, barely contained. Anger at Harry for taking that stupid potion, at Weasley for bringing him in, at Dean for asking all the questions, it was starting to boil and wouldn’t be long until Draco was boiling over with it.
“Would you care for some tea?” Atkinson lifted a pot from the table behind him and poured a cup. Harry watched him place the cup right in front of him and then step back expectantly.
They both found their shoes and took the floo to the Leaky. It wasn’t too crowded yet, that would be next weekend, with all the students home from Hogwarts, parents taking them out for treats, letting the older teenagers meet up with friends. But Hannah was behind the bar, and Tom too, and they both waved, calling out happy and loud, “Harry! Ginny! So good to see you!”
He took a long drink while Draco tried to figure out what Harry Potter could possibly feel sorry about. “Why?”
“You don’t know that.” Val pierced him with a hard glare. “You said Malfoy told you about the hyssop. Could be him.”
“I thought Ajax said no.” Ajax usually said no to the mass of them going out together. There was safety in the Pack, but also risk. And Ajax hated the Aurors more than Scotland Yard.
“Did you have a nightmare?” Draco asked, his voice quiet, concerned, hands still by his sides but eyes intent on Harry. “You usually thrash more and I can wake you up.”
But Harry wasn’t listening, was mumbling to himself instead. “The Wizengamot believed me, is that literally the only time in my life people will listen? You’ve all lost your fucking minds.”
But Harry could see the outline Dark Mark on his arm, just blurry lines now, but still distinct. “Don’t say that, like all you’ll ever be is a former Death Eater. You can be more than that.”
“This is where he goes when he doesn’t go to work.” Harry stormed up to the steps, and Parkinson faltered back against the front door. “He’s been in his fucking office all week, and today is Friday, so here is where he is. And so help me, if he doesn’t get out of your fucking house you are definately going to have to call those Ward Keepers!”
He could go to Grimmauld Place, Harry thought, but Jude wasn’t used to people showing up in the middle of the night and had just as many nightmares as Harry. He would go to Draco’s, if he knew where that was. Which just left work, a place that provided no comfort, but at least wasn’t his living room.
The nervous friend seemed less keen on preventing obvious law enforcement of some kind from doing his job. But he stood behind the Blond Beauty all the same.
Draco followed the waitress to the booth and slid in, only to have Harry slide in next to him. He glared at Harry as if it were some sort of surprise. Ron and Hermione had just walked through the door, so he turned towards them and hissed in Harry’s ear. “It’s a dangerous job. All I did was add some protections.” He scowled.
Harry stopped at Josephine’s desk at the entrance to the department. She had worked in the department for nearly twenty years, even during that disastrous year Voldemort had been in charge. Nothing phased her professional tone, which Harry admired. “Mr. Potter, how is the night shift treating you?” she asked with a frown, because Josephine didn’t smile no matter how she felt about the person in front of her desk.
They looked over the menu, ordered, and Harry was half way through his noodles when she finally got to the reason she had stopped by his office. “Are you doing alright, Harry?”
“That’s for sure.” Draco smiled, a real genuine smile. “It’s not like here. I mean, it is, in that way that all big cities are like each other, but there’s pizza and hotdogs and celebrities that no one cares about except tourists. And the people are mean, not mean, but they couldn’t give a shit about you and I like that.”
“Grace offered to take me to the supermarket today. She’s apparently having a staycation and told me she needs a project.”
“It’s not a problem, Gin. I just didn’t know. It’s great, really. Really great. I’m excited for you.”
She gave him a long look. “My other job’s hiring a busboy again. I’ll take you over there tomorrow so you can talk to my boss about it. Pays shit, but money’s money.”
Draco leaned across the table to whisper in Dean’s ear, making sure that Dean’s body was between him and the dictophone and that Weasley would not be able to read his lips through the wall. “Are you sure? It might not go well for you, if I don’t get what I want.”
Harry took a moment and looked him over. His skin was sallow, which might have been the light; his eyes were sunken and red; which still might have been the light. Harry took too long to answer, and another bartender leaned over, said something to Malfoy, lips pressed close to his ear. And Malfoy reached down for two glasses and then grabbed a bottle of tequila.
The man took Draco’s hand and led him down a long hall towards the bathrooms and some sort of employee only door. But they didn’t go far, just around the corner, and Draco had him pushed up against the wall. Hands under his shirt, skirting underneath the waistband on his denims, and mouths pressed openly together. He was moaning as Draco worked open his zip, and pulled everything down. And then Draco wrapped his hand around the man’s cock, feeling the weight of it, considering its size, before pressing several hot kisses along the length of his throat and sinking to his knees.
“I’m not asking a question.” Harry tried again. “But that was some messed up shit, and you can’t expect me to-to deal with you dying on my bathroom floor every other night.”
And Harry realized his own eyes were damp, and looked away from her blinked rapidly. “He does have a bad ex, who convinced him to do something that hurt him very badly. And I,
“Oy! There’s something strange going on in the upstairs loo! All the lights are flickering and-and the toilets are exploding!” The bloke Harry had fallen on called out from behind Harry. He sounded frightened and pointing back towards the stairs where Harry had come from.
“Oh, fine.” She waved her hand dismissively and then picked up her pint. “It’s nice to have someone else pour my drink though.”
“The party’s started without you,” Ron said, jerking Harry physically but not mentally from the pensieve.
“Come on, you’d better get dressed, or we’re going to be late, and who knows what the papers will say about that.” Ron interrupted.
Carefully, Harry peeled one of Malfoy’s hands from his legs. “You’re a man. See? Flesh and bone.” He held up Malfoy’s hand for him to see, ran his fingers over Malfoy’s palm.
Good Friday, just before Harry and Ron were planning to leave to get Ginny and Hermione for Easter Hols, the Auror department received a tip on Fenrir Greyback. He’d apparently been sighted in Tavistock by a particularly brave young wizard visiting distant relatives. He’d attached a tracking charm to the car and then immediately firecalled the Auror headquarters.
Monday dawned bright and easy, and Draco felt light for the first time in what must surely have been months. In fact, he felt so light, he thought he might skip on his way to the cafe near the Ministry. He didn’t, but the important part was that he felt like it.
“Enough!” Harry shouted and deliberately turned away from her. “Ron, why don’t you take Rosie downstairs. Teddy? Why did you bring Rosie up here? I thought we talked about this.”
“Why?” Harry asked, eyeing the sight and trying to decide if he should ask Malfoy to the Stubborn Goat tonight.
“Yeah,” Draco said fondly. “Alright, I’m off, try not to burn the place down in boredom while I’m gone.”
“I can’t wait to sign a lease of my own,” Ron said. “Hermione and Mum do just fine most of the time, but it would be nice to have my own space.”
“It wasn’t just that!” he shouted over Harry. “It was everything, all night! It was Hannah Abbott and the reporter sitting in the corner scribbling notes and your girlfriend shooting me dirty looks, and your friends defending themselves every time they sat down to talk to me! We’re never going to work, not if I can’t be in your world, and I very clearly can’t be there!”
.” He swallowed, looked down at his cards again, then looked at Draco who was smiling, just the littlest bit. “Come back, it’s time to come back without being afraid. What are you waiting for?”
“Atkinson’s a twit,” Harry replied. “But I meant what I said, I am going to get to the bottom of this case.”
Business in the bank picked up around 11am with a gaggle of people coming in dressed as if they were coming from work, and Harry realized they must be doing some Christmas shopping on their lunch breaks. He spotted a flash of blond at about the right height to be Draco, but this angle didn’t show his face. Harry yanked his head out right away, collected the memory and dumped in the next.
He squared his shoulders, straightened his papers, and then slid off his stool, all before turning to face the door head on.
Draco pushed back the blankets and stood up. “Your room? So far from home.” He walked over to the door and ran his hand across the wood. His shoulders were tight, fingers shaking.
Harry frowned, and Draco tried not to notice. “Well, it’s only for a few weeks, and then she has a series of games across Eastern Europe. She said she’ll be gone for two months. Oh, hello Malfoy, I didn’t realize you were going to be here today.”
“Christ those must be some big bones. How big does a Peluda get?” One auror complained as he ducked out of the way.
Harry Potter was in deep, deep trouble. He had lost track of the mission, gotten into a fist fight with a bystander, allowed the person in question to escape, and worst of all allowed himself to be distracted, again, but the idea of Draco Malfoy. Not that anyone knew that last part, but Robards had more than enough ammunition with all the rest of it.
“I’ve never eaten any of this,” he said at last. “I’m not very hungry. You should just pick for yourself.”
Harry started to turn away, not wanting to interrupt this intimate moment between the two of them, but then Teddy made a low whining sort of noise. And Malfoy said, “Come sit with us, Potter.”
“I don’t know, mate.” Ron leaned over them, hands clasped tightly behind his back. “These look too gaudy for her.”
“Why do you think he’s in Wiltshire?” Harry threw off his blankets and rummaged about on the floor for pants one handed.
Meanwhile, Faye closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. One of the wolves behind her was growling low in its throat, but the sound was not really threatening. “Minister,” Faye said before opening her eyes. “You do have a lovely smell.”
It meant that Sawyer, Draco, Alice, Joe, Clarence, and Thomas were all in violation that evening at the club. It meant that they were all in violation when they were in the flat. It meant that Packs couldn’t be together.
Shacklebolt took a deep breath and leaned back in his chair. “I agree absolutely. Those members of the Wizengamot who disagree argue that because a shifted Werewolf is not able to speak, they cannot participate in society, even under the influence of wolfsbane, they lack the ability to communicate effectively.”
It was Narcissa who saw it, who cried out and threw herself on top of Draco as his eyes fluttered open. She buried her face on Draco’s chest, crying loudly now, and everyone in the room stepped forward, except for Val who leaned out the door to shout for the mediwitch.
He puffed up his chest, although in anger or defense Harry wasn’t sure, but Ajax didn’t say anything.
Alright, that posting timeline has clearly gone out the window...And I like to be structured about things...sigh...I like it when the author's I read stick to what they say they'll do...sighs again...
Astoria took a deep breath and straightened her shoulders while Mrs. Greengrass continued to frown and looked as if she might make some sort of rebuttal.
Draco lifted his head, and watched Teddy cross the room, nearly tripping over the rug in his haste to cross the floor. He sank his fingers into the fur along his side, tugging a little harder than Draco liked, but not so painful. “You made your hair grow all over your body.” His voice was soft, almost reverent.
After breakfast, Draco went back to his apartment. He put away the clorox wipes, folded a basket of laundry, ran the dishwasher, and went to bed. Jenkins gave him a look when he arrived for the night shift that evening, but didn’t say anything, and Draco slouched in the back with his hands in his pockets while she read out the assignments.
It was easy enough to slip into Jenkins office and give a quick, “Nothing new, I’m off,” before heading to the Atrium to apparate home before the rush. The sun was over the horizon, but only just, when Harry walked up the steps to Grimmauld Place. He liked the way the old building looked at this time of day, the cream colored bricks all looked fresh in the gentle light. Calm and peaceful, that’s how it looked to Harry.
Tilly sighed and closed her eyes for a moment to let the resignation sink in, took a moment to accept the reality that was her life. “I supposed there’s nothing for it then, you’ll just have to come back to mine.” She took a drink and then pointed a finger at him. “But you’re going to have to get a job and help with the bills and stuff. London’s too expensive for you to just loaf about on the sofa.” God, she was never going to be able to quit this job!
There was something uncertain in Harry’s expression. “What are we doing?” Draco asked, voice low and soothing.
He pulled on a pair of jeans and his maroon robes and arrived in the office in under ten minutes. He beat the on duty Aurors to the conference room.
“Harry,” she reached across the table and put her hand on his. “You can tell her no, you don’t have to do this. The war is over now and you can live your own life.”
At the bar, he found a stool, and several ales later, a warm feeling in his belly radiated out towards his fingers. And the room was warm, and the people were warm, and the delightful little buzzing in his head made him giggle to himself. He rolled up his sleeves and signaled the bartender for another.
There was a burst of something like joy in Draco, and he said, quietly, “I guess you haven’t been talking to Potter, have you?”
Harry recognized that he was in dangerous territory of pushing his luck. “Perhaps someone more impartial?”
Draco sipped at the ‘just water’ while Weasley and the angry Auror engaged in some sort of silent conversation that Draco couldn’t be arsed to try and parse out. This was going to play out the way it was going to play out, and there was very little Draco could do to affect that.
“Yes,” Faye let her hand drop away. “And I am thinking of all of us when I say that I will no longer be treated like I am less.”
And Harry reached across the table and swiped the last of Ron’s pint. “Not yet.” He couldn’t just follow Draco and Parkinson, not this week.
Harry caught sight of him outside the men’s in King’s Cross and picked up the trail. Jude made his way with the commuter crowd down the pavement, and Harry kept pace. They walked for maybe fifteen minutes, before Jude stepped into an alley next to a corner pub. Harry watched as he walked through an unmarked door, and then debated if he ought to go through the same door.
“You were never really one of us.” Ajax let him step away because the rest of them had circled around. There was nowhere for Draco to run.
It was a long walk to Grimmauld Place, and with each block, Harry ended up bearing more and more weight. He cast a discreet Leviosa just to take the weight off, and Malfoy was able to walk a little straighter. It helped, but Malfoy was still grey and gasping when they arrived at Grimmauld Place.
It was like opening the floodgates, but it also wasn’t anything like Draco had expected. The second time he went to Grimmauld Place, this time because Jude asked him to sit in on one of his group meetings, Harry asked if he wanted a tour.
“He’s just living his life, Hermione. He has friends and a job, and they must actually like him. They showed him hair dye.” She was a blurry shape in front of him.
Harry was early to the Fundraiser on Saturday. All the speakers were supposed to arrive first so that they could help greet guests as they arrived. Harry gave a speech every year, but this was the first time he had ever arrived early.
And again Harry watched Draco’s eyes go wide and then narrow, he looked down and then up, the muscles in his cheeks twitched slightly. “What’s it matter to you if I know him or not?” He yanked his arm out of Harry’s hand and crossed his arms across his chest.
“I need to review these cases.” Harry gestured to the papers he had spread across the sofa. “But you are welcome to read any of my books, or I can turn the radio on.” He had a television, but didn’t say anything about that. He waited to see what Malfoy would say, but he just stood there, in the bathroom doorway looking small and lost. “Or, if you want to sleep, you can lay down in my bed.”
It was exceedingly awkward when Potter didn’t retaliate, and Draco realized he’d overreacted. “Why are you here?” he asked rather than apologize for his behavior.
The sun went down, and Draco felt the sick clench in his stomach. It always started in his stomach, the twist and the squish and the pull as organs shrank and moved, and Draco heaved against the chains around his wrists. Then came the tremors, the shaking and pulsing of his skin so that it jumped as the hair started to come in, thickening, poking new holes in his skin. His bones cracked as they changed, and Draco was grateful when he could finally slip from the cuffs and hit the floor with four paws.
Grace nodded hesitantly. “Sometimes, those inpatient programs don’t encourage new patients to contact people for a few weeks, I’m sure he’ll get in touch just as soon as he can.”
“Yes, well.” Draco shoved his hands in his pockets. He looked at the floor and wasn’t sure how to move from this moment to the next. But then, they never had been smooth. “I thought I’d better give you your birthday present while I could.”
“Werewolves, Potter, as in more than one! Greyback himself was seen on the premises! And you were busy what?”
Tilly glanced towards the bar from behind the closed door. “Her parents finally figured it out, kicked her out. And that bloke won’t return her calls.” Tilly rolled her eyes skyward and shook her head angrily. “She hasn’t got a place to stay.”
It was Atkinson’s lab, Harry could tell immediately. It had a clinical efficiency to the organization and lay out. There was a peg board hanging over a table with tools hung inside careful outlines. Bookshelves covered an entire wall with volumes and volumes of journals and books that all looked frighteningly similar. Harry was standing in the middle of a set of tables that smelled like antiseptic. And everything felt clinically cold.
Harry asked Jude about it Thursday morning. “If you want to go, go. Why is it every time Draco’s involved there’s this big debate?”
Draco woke up on Wednesday morning and promptly stumbled towards the toilet in his flat where he spent fifteen minutes dry heaving. After rinsing the taste of bile from his mouth, he shuffled to the kitchen counter for the crackers he had left out for just this reason. Between the rolling in his stomach and the pounding in his head, Draco considered crawling back into bed. But he was hot, and had spent the last hour tossing and turning.
“What was his family life like?” Harry asked, following a loose guideline he’d memorized a long time ago.
So Harry gave her an outline of the case as they made their way to the curry place across the street. Hermione nodded and listened politely, and then, just as they were sitting down at the table said, “It’s the power dynamic.”
“Why are you asking my permission?” Tilly rolled her eyes. “You wanna hang out after work, go hang out. God, I’m your flatmate, not your mother. Help me cut these lemons.”
Harry looked him over. He was nicely shaped, decent shoulders and good legs. He was muscled but in that runner sort of way. And as Harry looked him over, he didn’t think he would be able to count any ribs and was surprised at how that was disappointing.
“No!” Draco cried and tried to pull his hand back. She shouldn’t see that! She shouldn’t ever see that!
He’d made it all the way around, only a small bit, one kiss left, at the base of Draco’s wrist, when Draco finally found the nerve to put a hand on Harry’s face and tilt him up. He wasn’t sure what Harry saw in his expression, wasn’t sure what he saw written across Harry’s face, but it didn’t matter. It only mattered that those lips pressed against his, and Harry’s weight pinned Draco against the mantle. Sure, it cut uncomfortably into Draco, but Harry’s hands were strong and comforting as he put them on Draco’s neck, on his shoulder, slid them down to the curve of his arse.
The crack echoed loudly off the tall, brick buildings, and Draco just did not care. He took the front door as if it were the Great Hall at Hogwarts, back straight and chin impervious. His legs were steady and his shoes clacked reassuringly on the wooden floor. Best of all, Tilly sat behind the desk with her warm smile.
Hermione immediately picked up on the tension in the moment and turned to Astoria. “Hello, Hermione Granger-Weasley, pleased to meet you.” She offered a hand, which Astoria shook as well. “Aren’t you friends with Blaise Zabini? I think I’ve seen you around the canteen.”
Draco nodded stiffly and then turned to his generator, picking up a tool he didn’t need just to have something in his hand. He didn’t look away until he heard the door open and shut.
He wasn’t going to sleep in Harry’s bed until the early morning light washed the color out of his hair.
“I’m tired of waiting,” Draco muttered to the counter. He fussed with toothpicks, and spent at least five minutes debating refilling the half empty bowls of peanuts. But they’d be closing in an hour, and it would be just wasteful. He checked the bottles chilling in the refrigerator, and the kegs in the back, getting out another of the Guinness but not changing it out just yet.
Ron gave Harry a look. “Mate, it’s Hermione.” He rolled his eyes. “And anyway, Hermione said he was not horrible with Rose.”
But the loo wasn’t empty; Potter stood in front of a sink, water running untouched down the drain, knuckles white on the edge of the porcelain, eyes wide but pupils tiny.
“Well,” Tilly gave a one shoulder shrug. “I figured I ought to see what all the fuss was about. I rather like the lights.” She pointed to the arches.
“I am not sure that it is something I can give you.” Draco said carefully. His interest was not a secret in New York, but it wasn’t something he had made public here. And this was the first time he dared to tell someone. “I have never been one to appreciate the female form.
The portrait visibly wobbled on the wall; Sarah glared harder, nostrils flaring. And then, with a great screeching noise not unlike nails on chalkboard, the frame flung itself from the wall to Sarah’s feet so hard that it cracked on two separate corners and the canvass flapped free.
Harry whirled around and began gesturing wildly. “Sarah is in that room! And this moro--” He cut himself off at Hermione’s glare. “Won’t let me or Jude in.”
Vale leaned his chair back on two legs and beamed at her. “We want to live in peace, as long as we are treated fairly.”
They walked in silence the rest of the way, but what Draco had assumed would have been a painfully awkward moment simply wasn’t. It was as if just the mention of tea was enough to thaw, just a little, the icy chasm between them.
“Seriously?” Chorused from the other side of the bar. Sophie and Blake looked at Draco incredulously.
“It’s a bit like being a teaching assistant, I suppose,” Hermione said, thoughtfully. I spend a lot of time grading first year papers and helping Professor Vector with her research. She’s writing a paper on the number 4 and how it affects the focus of students in the classroom. It’s quite fascinating.”
Harry breathed hard, and then pulled his hand away. “Yeah, okay. But I didn’t drink that much, and I didn’t want to go home with Dan. Only a fool would call you convenient, and I am not going to lie. I don’t want to fuck you.” Draco’s expression fell, and Harry leaned in close, lips brushing his ear as he said, “I want you to fuck me, Draco.” He pulled back and started to take off his shirt.
“A girl can only live without chocolate for so long, Harry Potter, before she has to take matters into her own hands.” Ginny flopped back against the arm of the sofa dramatically. “Besides, I want to go on a date. It’s been ages since we had a date.”
“Perhaps you should direct your questions about Packs and Alphas to an Alpha,” Faye called from her seat.
Just as Draco’s parents had groomed him and led him to the same slaughter. And they had done just what had been expected of them, tried to destroy the other. They had left scars, physical and mental, across each other.
Alice took a deep breath, “Not Draco. It’s a bit of an overload, to be honest.” She pressed her lips together.
“I don’t know what that means.” Draco shoved his hands in his pockets and kicked the pebble again. “Is that a muggle thing?”
“And yet, Hermione was the only one injured in the accident. Why were you protected and she wasn’t?”
Why was Draco Malfoy in a Muggle club with his leg thrust between the legs of another man, shuddering and looking utterly taken? His throat was one long line, and so smooth, eyes half lidded, mouth bitten pink. Is that what he looked like in the heat of the moment? Is that what he would look like if, instead of the strange bloke, it were Harry?
“Yeah. Just let me drop this on Savage’s desk. What did you get up to today?” Harry asked, hoping a little small talk would provide a distraction.
“Hey, hey!” Draco put his hands on her shoulders and looked her in the eye. “You’ve gotta breathe. We’ll get you out, I promise. But if you panic, the Aurors are going to be all over you, so you’ve got to breathe.”
So then they talked about work for a little while, and Harry ignored the way Ron didn’t look quite as happy during that conversation, as if he had been hoping Harry would talk about Quidditch or fixing up Sirius’s old bike or going out to the pub. But the conversation wasn’t too heavy, and it carried them right up to the door of Trinkets where Ron was hoping to find a ring.
Draco swayed with the wind, but somehow found himself dressed with shoes that Harry had bought him just last week. And they were moving, but all Draco could feel was the rain in his eyes and under his skin, the thunder in his ears and pounding through his heart, the lightning zipping across his skin. And Grace’s hand, tight around his arm, pulling and pushing and steering him for he could not do that himself.
Harry shook his head and Draco crossed his arms. “Potter thinks I’ve done something amusing, but I can assure you that I haven’t.
“No,” Draco said quietly, defensively, now stuck halfway between the bed and the door. He’d been that guy.
Carefully, Harry slipped out from underneath her and padded silently over to his dresser, to the sock drawer, to look at that small box. Love, loyalty, and friendship. Harry felt all of those things for Ginny, but when he tried to imagine getting that ring out, and presenting it to her, he just--he just couldn’t. His mind went blank.
They stepped through the door not touching but together. A slow silence settled over the room as Harry and Draco made their way to the serving line. Draco whispered to Harry something light and silly about them never having seen two archenemies having lunch before, and Harry laughed loudly, the chuckles echoing through the large room. And then the room was filled with loud gossip.
Harry dithered, leaning to see around Blond Beauty. Tetchy stared out the door straight at Harry and then behind him.
And then, finally, Sophie did bust through the door, wiped her eyes and not looking at anyone as she slipped behind the bar and tried to smile at a customer in a way that was not at all like Sophie. Tilly froze a moment, dithering between the loo and asking Sophie what had happened. The loo won out, but only because it had been thirty minutes.
Draco considered his options. Three days was the maximum time they could hold him without charging him. And if they did charge him, well, all hell might just break loose, he thought vindictively. He could handle three days of Dreamless. He took the potion with an angry, “I didn’t do anything to him, I already told you; Harry did it to himself.” He downed it all in one angry go.
Draco pushed his chair back from the desk. “Don’t be. He was always going to show up, always going to make a scene.”
“She stole the last of his Bertie Botts. Sometimes a man has to defend what’s his, ‘Mione.” Ron came in and took out his coat. “Right, Harry?”
All of a sudden, alfoy’s attention snapped to Harry. He looked down the length of his own body and then looked at Harry again. “I’ll--I’ll--” He licked his lips. “I’m fine now. And I need to think. I can’t do that in your room. Go to bed. I will be here in the morning. And I can promise there won’t be any blood anywhere.” He sat down in the shadows but next to the light streaming through the door, fingers tapping absently on his knee.
Another strange look flickered across McGonagall's face, and then she smiled at him. “Well then, I suppose I had better arrange for some sort of funding. Thank you, Mr. Potter.”
It’s not--” Ron started to back track. “I mean, I’ve heard them say worse about Narcissa Malfoy when she comes in for her monthly meeting with you.”
And Harry could feel the firm muscles of Malfoy’s chest, lean and slender not like his own which had bulked up over the summer, and it certainly wasn’t the softness of Ginny. It was different, and Harry wanted to tear the shirt off.
“Not much. It’s what I know about my brother. See, I know something bad happened to him in high school, and he got into drugs. When he quit school my parents kicked him out. Eventually I learned that he moved in with his boyfriend, and then he died, overdosed. My parents refused to talk about it, they wouldn’t even tell me what happened. I had to figure it out for myself.” She shrugged. “Now I don’t talk to my parents much anymore.”
In truth, Draco would have preferred an earlier hour, but then, he was aware enough of his own emotions to know that he simply did not want to return to the Manor. “That will be just fine. If you could point me in the direction of the floos?”
“I know.” Draco leaned in close and whispered just softly enough for Harry to hear, “It’s my arse, isn’t it?”
Draco eyed the cheap liquor carefully for a moment before counting the stack of notes once more. “I’m on the clock, and that’s a slippery slope.”
He shook his head and went out to the kitchen to make breakfast. Malfoy had left the bathroom door cracked and steam was seeping out. He decided not to think about how nice it was, having another person in the flat. Malfoy came out as Harry was plating up the eggs. The denims were far too big, but the t-shirt seemed to fit a little better.
“And just how do you suggest I do such a thing? Shall I ring her on my mobile?” Faye cocked her head to the side, fists clenched at her sides, the wolves behind her moving restlessly. “This is the problem with your government.” Her voice rang clear through the street, echoing off the walls, and in the distance there was the howl of other wolves.
“That law makes the magical population feel safe.” Granger bit her lip. “It’s going to be a delicate balance, giving you what you need and making them feel safe.”
Hermione had her head in a cupboard. “For one thing, what he managed to create is pretty miraculous. Integrating muggle technology and magic? It’s like finding a way to mix oil and water so they never separate. And I did a lot of research. I don’t think I would have approved the project if I didn’t think he had learned his lesson.”
“If you don’t want to help, I’ll just do it myself,” Draco grumbled, locking his phone and making to put it away.
But then Draco turned back and looked at Harry with his grey eyes and his careful expression that said nothing at all. Sometimes Harry wondered if Draco made that expression on purpose, just to see if Harry could read underneath the mask. Although Harry never could. “Potter,” Draco said.
“The last night I saw my brother, he came into my room while I was studying. He was smiling, but not a happy smile, more like, a loving one. He told me how much he loved me, and he said he was really sorry, and he said a bunch of other things I didn’t understand. I didn’t understand him a lot; I think most people didn’t.” She sighed. “I became a nurse to help people like my brother. I think that’s probably why you got into policing, to help people who can’t help themselves.”
Which sprang open just as Mirabellla opened her mouth for another condescending comment and revealed Malfoy in all his glory. He’d grown, in the three months since Harry had last seen him. Grown, and he’d cut his hair severely, which Harry would have considered an improvement over the unkempt look he’d had at the trial if it weren't for the yellow tinge to his skin.
Draco slid the four drinks across the counter to her with a small smile. “Darling, if I were interested in women, that would be the best offer I’ve had all night.” It was his standard reply.
Draco followed more sedately, having been revived by the black tea and the air. Inside, Andromeda was working in the kitchen, and he could hear Teddy stomping down the hall and into his room. And then he heard the front door.
And Harry wondered if Ron had been involved in the case too. They hadn’t talked about work as much lately, what with Ron always casually saying high profile and changing the subject. Harry figured it had to do with Greyback or other missing Death Eaters, and that Ron just hadn’t wanted to upset him because he wasn’t on that task force anymore.
Ron shrugged. “Mum was just worried when you didn’t show for dinner. I figured you got caught up in a case. Need some help?”
And Luis shrugged. “It took us too long to identify the boats. The boats are La Vitesse, Etoile, Fatima, et Arthur.”
Several things happened at once. People began to scream and cast small Protegos as small bits of the ceiling started to rain down. Quickly, Harry cast his own, larger and more powerful shield that managed to cover most of the people in the room, as long as they stayed huddled together. Vale gave a howl as he tackled Jones to the floor, her wand clattering harmlessly against the marble several meters away. Draco had pulled Faye underneath him, and all of a sudden there was screaming and panic.
She was a cheery sort of woman who smiled brilliantly and immediately intimidated Harry when she said, “How can I help?”
The article had been full of accolades for Potter, although, as far as Draco had been able to tell, he hadn’t actually done much of anything except stand next to that woman Auror, Savage, while she had brought in MacNair.
“That was five days ago. People don’t smile like that for some kid’s birthday for five days, they don’t smile like that for mind blowing orgasms. Unless they’re having them every day.” She raised one eyebrow because she’d been practicing and had just started getting good at it.
“He’ll go to Azkaban for the sheer number of crimes,” Robards growled, and Hermione gave him a look.
“Alice talked him into it. I think mostly by whining in his face until he told her to get out and take her lousy friends with her.”
“Oh hell no. I already raised two teenagers, plus I have you now. I’ve done my time.” She stared him down, and then when Harry didn’t move made a little shooing motion with her hand.
, couldn’t walk the halls without hearing the hiss and slither of things no longer living. Couldn’t stop seeing, right now, behind this rubbish bin, the way the Dark Lord had raised his wand at Draco when he’d failed to identify Potter, as if he knew Draco had been lying.
Draco slipped the money back into his pocket and looked at the paper cup in his hand. His eyes felt damp and there was this fluttering in his stomach that was suspiciously familiar. “I don’t know what to say.”
“What do you want, Potter?” Draco tucked his wilting erection back into his denims and did up the zip and button. “Or do you just get your rocks off ruining orgasms.”
party. Nobody there’s got any money. We won’t even be there that long. One hour and you can come back here and crash on your mattress.”
Her father frowned as Draco accepted. “That sounds quite lovely, Astoria.” He stood and offered her his arm again, and they stepped out into the hall. “Your father seems less than pleased with me.”
Harry thought he looked quite good in them. “Got a bit distracted by the paper.” Harry gestured toward the table as he picked up his tea.
“We were both in the laundry room. She helped me with the coins.” Malfoy put the basket down inside the bedroom and walked over to the balcony door. His happy demeanor was quickly dissipating.
Draco reached out and ran one finger across the leather band. “It’s a beautiful piece, inside and out.” He sighed.
His hands shook as he poured out the shots of liquor into the glasses of ice. And that could not possibly be the light. “You went to see the Greens,” Harry shouted over the din.
He nodded and flopped down into the cushions, curling onto his side as he went. The room spun a bit, and Harry closed his eyes. It wasn’t quite so bad lying down; the pillow was soft, the room dark, and Ginny laid a cool hand against his cheek.
“What the fuck,” Tilly cursed quietly as her phone buzzed, again, in her pocket. She didn’t get it out, didn’t bother to look at it. The messages hadn’t been for her yesterday, or Thursday, or Wednesday, and she would have bet big money that this one wasn’t for her either. “Oi!” she shouted at Draco who was in the midst of switching out a keg. “We’re getting you a mobile tomorrow!”
“If you are interested in Blood Magic, you should read In the Age of Death and Magic.” Dr. Connor crouched down at another shelf, running his hands across the spines in search of the book.
While Harry and Ginny perused the meager beer selection, Malfoy drifted over to the transcript, his fingers brushing over the Hogwarts crest at the top. “Trevor, tell Ginny about your job.” Harry said, a little vengeful and hopeful Malfoy would tell the truth.
Malfoy reached across the table and filched a piece of bacon from Harry’s plate. “Well, I’m not exactly in the Pack.” He sneered and bit the bacon sharply. “And I have issues with authority. You may have noticed in my probation records.”
He was halfway between the bar and the dance floor when Harry saw him, Draco Malfoy. There was no mistaking the bright blond hair no matter the location or level of lighting. With his thigh thrust up between the legs of another bloke, head thrown back, and writhing. He had a plastic cup of something clear in his hand which was draped possessively over the bloke’s shoulder, but his head was thrown back and his eyes closed. And for a moment, Harry completely forgot what he was doing. Malfoy looked so free, so different from the boy he remembered. He was pale but not sullen, he was slender but fit, he had hard lines and was so tall, he wasn’t anything like the boy at school.
“That’s what the blood is for? Making the Philosopher’s Stone?” Draco collapsed back against the wall.
“Can’t.” Malfoy was pacing and rubbing his arms. “Can’t tell anyone. Too dangerous. Have to-have to-no, no, too risky.”
He wiped his hands on a dish towel and then disappeared out the back. The back door opened out into the dark alley where they kept the rubbish bins, and Draco could make out a Harry shaped person at the entryway. For a moment, he stood outside the door and breathed. Just because he’d known Harry would be back didn’t at all mean that he was prepared for Harry to be back today.
He turned back to Granger. “Well, since I’m apparently not leaving and I refuse to wake Potter, I guess we should talk.” He took a seat on the sofa and gestured towards the chair across from him.
He listened carefully to each and every squeak, to the soft footfalls, to his excited breathing, until the door opened and his small face peaked inside. “Ooh,” he sighed and pushed the door. “Wow.”
She sighed. “To be honest? Professor Flitwick and I agree that she needs some control, but we fear that she may never fully grasp the use of a wand, the instinctive use of accidental magic being more innate to her at this point.”
Neil sat straight up, his groin pressed fully against Draco’s, but he didn’t tease when he said, “Not evil. Evil is all World War Two and genocide. A Bad Guy isn’t evil. A
“Thank you,” Atkinson said in a tone that would have sounded like relief, if Harry had been less angry. “This asset, it will prevent anyone like He Who Must Not Be Named from gaining power again.”
Malfoy’s fingers twitched and wrapped themselves around Harry’s hand. “Flesh and bone,” he repeated, squeezing Harry.
“The fuck,” because the whole day had been a shit show. Harry rolled his eyes in exasperation. “Come look at these menus and tell me what you like.”
“If you can get him to stop eating it, I will be impressed,” Aunt Andromeda said over the rim of her cup. “He’s been doing that since he had first discovered grass.”
Was that why it had been so hard for Ron? Because every time he imagined giving Hermione a ring, he just couldn’t. Maybe Harry had just picked the wrong ring?
“Sure.” Harry wiggled his fingers and thought about washing his hands again. “God, this thing is a nightmare.”
“Oh,” Harry looked down at their hands, how she had tangled their fingers together just the way Draco did sometimes, when they were talking about sad things or hard things or Harry had asked one of those questions that made Draco seem a little lost too.
“Well, are you coming in, or are you going to spend the whole afternoon in the doorway?” Draco took off his jacket and hung it up.
“Considering I run the largest Pack in London,” she looked directly at Head Sorceress Malhotra as she said, “at twenty-two members, I think I might be able to answer some of your questions.”
There weren’t many people in the canteen this late in the morning and few food choices remained. But Harry found two bacon rolls and several bananas. He didn’t have hands for a cup of tea, but he squeezed two bottles of water between his arm and his chest, and then hurried back to holding.
Ron huffed, “Yeah, Mum had a field day with that. Thinking we’d have a double wedding. Had to set her down and have a chat about it.”
Draco carefully chewed and swallowed and then took a long sip of his tea, savoring the heat. “That would be a private conversation between Thomas and me. If he would prefer not to tell anyone else, it’s certainly not my place to do so.” He took another sip.
It was a crushing statement because of course Draco was lonely. He didn’t have a full Pack, just a seven year old. His Mate died. And he had just spent the last several hours completely alone listening to a group of people have a party. Of course he was lonely, and it shouldn’t have taken an emphatic declaration from a seven year old for Harry to know that. “Okay. I will take care of him now, Teddy.”
That was typical behavior, and Harry was not surprised. The Alpha comment though, that part Harry didn’t like at all. “I’m not anybody’s Alpha,” he said.
She sagged a little against him. “I’ve spent all week at work listening to people bicker and complain. Is it too much to ask for a pleasant afternoon on my one day off this week?” She sighed, “Maybe I should take a nap.”
“He couldn’t possibly have found your flat!” Harry’s voice was still loud, but had a sort of desperate edge to it now.
Around them, Aurors popped into the lab with loud cracks. From the edge of his vision, Harry could see a team from St. Mungo’s, Robards, Ron. Harry turned his head, hands still around Draco, to see them. “I’m okay,” Harry said, breathing normally.
There was a knock at the door and a second later the whoosh of the floo, and Draco could hear Harry tumbling down the stairs in a rush, probably because he didn’t want Draco to get up. Hermione quickly stepped through the floo and into the room, giving a soft smile at the sight of Draco laying shirtless on the sofa.
“Those are your friends, and I-I haven’t the right to be--” he trailed off, looking for the right words, looking up at the overcast sky. “I’m not your boyfriend.” He didn’t say anything else, but Harry had been thinking it off and on all evening.
“A nightmare.” Draco locked eyes with Harry and said before anyone could ask another question. “It was him.” He sat up and looked out towards Grace’s balcony. “I need help.”
“Okay, okay, just calm down. I’m coming there. I need--I need to call Hermione and send her over to check on Tilly. Fuck, where does Tilly live?”
Sitting down, Harry tried to think about how he liked sitting next to Ginny, how pretty her hair looked, how the loud happy people surrounding him didn’t make him feel wrong and suffocated at all. Ron pressed quick or tender or needy kisses to Hermione’s hand, her check, her mouth, and Ginny pressed her hand against Harry’s knee.
And then there would be the conversation topics, the newest Ministry reform to pass, the latest slight to the Sacred Twenty Eight, the indignities suffered by the pure blood elite. Or, from the more liberal families, the latest victories of the new regime, whatever exciting thing Potter had been seen doing (probably speculation on when he might propose, Ha!), and the audacity of one Draco Malfoy to show his face in public. It would be just like his mother’s dinner parties except with more people and fewer places to panic quietly and alone. Draco took a large swallow of his eggnog and slurred, “No, thanks.”
Malfoy closed his eyes and appeared to be suppressing a groan or a whine or something. “That is very kind of you to offer, but I believe Aunt Andromeda has prepared a room for me.”
Draco let go of the bracelet and went back to the door. “Something’s changed. What?” He looked around the flat, eyes unfocused and unseeing.
Narcissa clucked and shook her head. “I just don’t understand where this Ministry gets these ideas. I understand the Dark Lord was a bit extreme, but that’s no excuse to start dishonoring our ancestors.”
“Like I said, I have a problem with authority. And I don’t like Aurors.” Malfoy cut into that line of thinking.
Draco reached out and touched her knee, drawing her attention back to him. “You’re brave. All the things you’ve been through, you’re one of the bravest people I know.”
Draco flipped back upright when the tingling on his skin made him restless. It was always like this close to the full moon, too much energy and excitement and everyone in the flat itchy and bright. “Why are you in there?” Because usually Sawyer would be out at the movies or the restaurant, or just roaming the streets.
The door was already open and a man in his fifties with greying hair was looking out at them. “The Missus put the pot on,” he said, holding the door open for both of them.
It wasn’t that she did those things that made Harry feel filthy, but the way she phrased the descriptions, even in her journal. Dr. Connor was absolutely right about the length of the skirt...He is just brilliant….I can’t believe I’d never even considered it until Dr. Connor suggested… Was it possible that Connor didn’t even know the effect he’d had on Marie?
And then everyone was getting up, having their assignments, and Val was looking at Harry who was stuffing the toxicology report into his pocket. She raised her eyebrows, and Harry shook his head. This was definitely not the place he wanted to have this conversation. They gathered their things and apparated to West End.
Draco rolled his head to the side to look Teddy in the eye; he’d changed them to be grey like Draco’s. “We’re family because your Grandma, or do you call her Mama, is my aunt, and we’re family because we choose to be.”
“Third floor, then. I believe room eight is empty.” The Healer nodded. “And Mediwitch Halliwell, you will take responsibility for this--this--I won’t have anyone else put at risk.”
But then Malfoy moved. He walked out of the bedroom, picked the shirt up off the floor and began piling papers and replacing utensils that were scattered about the living room. He could have asked, or stated, but Harry decided he really didn’t want to know what had happened out there last night. After a moment more of lounging in bed and trying to will his still very interested erection to give up the chase, his alarm went off, and Harry walked to his closet for clothes.
“Well, I did say he’s a right fucker.” She was quiet for a moment. “I don’t know what to tell you, Harry. I can only say this project is super important to him, and he’s a right shit when he’s pissed. I’d say give him some time, but even when he’s not pissed, he’s still a shit.”
As soon as he couldn’t see Malfoy, he had doubts about this plan. Last time he had done this, the relief had been short lived and quickly replaced by loneliness.
“I hate being there,” Harry admitted out loud, probably for the first time. Had he even said it to his therapist?
“You love your job, why would you quit?” Ginny asked, quieter this time, settling down into her chair.
And she had looked down at the table and said, “Harry will be disappointed that he didn’t get to at least say hello.”
They went back to the Port, the both of them tired, and Evan watched how Draco wrapped his hand around Tilly’s waist, and how Tilly rested her head on his shoulder. “It’s a damned shame you don’t know who Robin Hood is,” Tilly said, as they stepped in time through the door.
“Okay,” Jude held up a calming hand. “Well, I think it’s like that other stuff, just, you know, more?”
“We’re here every sunny Sunday. She knows where to go.” Harry replied. “Let me look at your shoulder.”
Malfoy snorted quietly in Harry’s ear. “And if Malfoy is the thief, why do you need me to track him down? His wand has a trace on it.”
When Draco stepped up to the counter, he slipped the earbuds from his ears, the faint music still audible, and said, “Yes, I’d like to make a withdrawal from my vault, 98. And can I get that in pounds?”
She was discharged later that evening, all the tests normal, and Ron nervously hovering. Harry had put the note in his pocket and kept running his hand along the fold while they ate curry again. Ron tucked Hermione into bed, and Harry took the mobile. He said good night when Ron came back down the stairs, and apparated to Grimmauld Place where he stood on the street and made a phone call.
Draco paused, one arm still in the sleeve and in the process of pulling the shirt on. “I suppose.” It was hard to say that he lived here, hard to admit that truth.
He drew his knees up to his chest and rocked back and forth, face pressed hard into his knees. If he didn’t know better, Harry would have said he was crying. But Harry had seen him crying, and this was different. And it wasn't like earlier in the week which had been anger and desperation and danger. This, this was just desperation.
“Yeah, so I guess the police just found this whole group of people, like twelve of ‘em, all dead in a flat in Clapham. Neighbor’s called the police because of the smell. Apparently they all took some drug that poisoned them on Saturday.”
So they stepped into the Leaky Cauldron, and through the back. Harry let Ron tap the brick even though doing that himself always brought back warm memories of Hagrid. And then they were walking down the street.
Draco pushed his hands as deep into his trouser pockets as he could, left forearm pressed painfully against his body. He could have done something for it, but he hadn’t been able to bear pulling back the bandage Tilly had wrapped so kindly around him. “Yeah, I didn’t think I was going to come back.” For some reason he couldn’t meet Potter’s gaze. “I just wanted to talk to Evan.”
Sophie ducked down and scurried to put away another row of glasses while Tilly busied herself with cutting a pineapple. Draco hadn’t been at the bar that long, but even he knew that Markus had his hand in the till and that Molly and Blake just wanted raises.
Draco had to turn around then. He had to see his mother’s face as he spoke. “And what if there were no grandchildren. What if I wanted to return to New York?”
“Not over her status.” McGonagall was quick to reassure. “Merely that students in similar situations to hers in the past have experienced a degree of hazing.”
“Yeah, I mean, I get it. Beaters got to bulk up, and the Seeker needs to be real lean. I just don’t know what she’s expecting from the Chasers. We’ve got to be agile, but also launch the Quaffle through the hoops, so I don’t know.” Ginny shrugged and nestled in next to Harry, a warm comforting presence at his side.
Damn, but he looked good, shimming back and forth, lean and muscled and not quite as slight as the first day he had arrived. Still too skinny, but he had gained a little weight, and Harry approved. Harry was also full of pent up tension screaming for an outlet. And there was Malfoy, and more importantly Malfoy’s arse moving through the room in that way that drew Harry’s eye. And he was looking over his shoulder at Harry with a smirk and a gleam and Harry stormed into the bedroom, slamming the door as loudly as he could.
He heaved again, this time falling on to his hands and knees on the floor. A tremor ran through his body, and then another, and he yanked at his shirt pulling it off over his head. He’d easily lost four stone, all the muscle and fat seemed suddenly gone from his face, arms, chest, and Harry could see the outline of his ribs and spine. He looked dead, starved, and he heaved violently again.
“What did you do?” Draco asked, forgetting his anger as he mentally reached out to touch the wards. They felt the same.
“Yes, you are. Because we can’t help you if we don’t know what’s going on. Like you said to that girl, you’ve just got to keep breathing. Count your breaths, think of a safe place, and breathe, Draco.”
“Fine.” Draco stood and turned his back. It was true, those pleather trousers were uncomfortable enough when he got hard already in them. They were impossible to pull over an erection. So Draco stared at the white wall and thought about terribly unsexy things, like Ajax during the new moon, or the way Florence liked to flounce about the flat in the nude, or anything to do with the Ministry of Magic. Especially the Werewolf Support Services. Ugh, and wasn’t Granger in charge of that department. And with that, somewhat abhorrent thought, Sawyer tossed Draco his trousers, and Draco was able to put them on.
A knock came from the door, and Draco glared at the cherry wood. Probably just Mimsy, but possibly his mother had come to summon him for supper. And Draco would rather starve than eat in that room.
“Although, I blame you entirely,” she said matter of factly, and Draco suddenly thought he might sick up over the breakfast, “for Rosie’s sudden insistence that we get a big doggie. I thought Ron was going to have convulsions.” She smiled, and Draco’s stomach relaxed. And all three adults sat at the table and listened to Teddy chatter on about how he couldn’t wait for Rosie to turn seven so that she could have a big party and get her very own doggie too.
“We’re boring you with all this work talk!” Astoria chided when Draco failed to join in the conversation.
Draco was lingering outside the pub by design. He hadn’t told Granger that he was going to do this, and she might be inside going a bit spare that he hadn’t arrived yet, but he wanted to make sure the other Weres could see him right away. So, he was leaning up against the wall next to the door nodding at people as they walked inside.
Draco fell into his chair and threw his face into his hands. He stayed that way until Tilly came back looking for him.
“Yes, well, she was deemed the Unspeakable most able to assist me. There might be others with more potion skills or even perhaps more knowledge of muggle technology, but none with both of those.”
Sometimes Harry felt that way. “It’s not so bad. It’s more like an introductory job in the Ministry. You start in Records and then move into another department. What do you think you’d like to do?”
“Oi! Potter!” Aziz called from the front desk. “You’re the Were Whisperer, come take a crack at this one.”
Teddy stuck out his lower lip, and Harry mentally prepared for an argument. “Is it upstairs from mine?” He asked Andromeda.
Draco brought his mouth up to Harry’s ear, bit the lobe and whispered, “You smell like home, because you smell like Andromeda and Teddy, but it’s more.” He dragged his nose across the stubble on Harry’s face. “It’s freedom too, like wide open spaces and running and taking and living.” His lips barely brushed against Harry, and Harry jerked up to press his now aching cock against Draco.
Inside, the room was crowded, but not so much that he couldn’t see from one side to the other. They were happy, the noisy patrons with their glasses of firewhiskey and gillywater and mead, and he breathed in the scent of alcohol and soaked in the sounds of normal people. This was where he wanted to be. Maybe he could be no one in this place.
The tingling rushed over Draco, a curious and reaching sort of of feeling that he had felt before. Felt and not understood. It floated over him, like soft touches, gentle and comforting. And though Draco knew it was a mistake, knew that he should not respond, Teddy was so young, not able to understand. If Draco rejected him, he would not know why. It was only because Draco had felt it before, had felt it and not known what it meant, hadn’t known to be wary of it. Because he had felt it and known the wonder of it, and now knew the loss, he did not reject Teddy, but reached out tentatively himself, let his own scent and magic and awareness linger on Teddy.
Draco didn’t listen to her, Floyd was speaking, "I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the most of us...very hard to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad..." He drifted back over to the turntable.
Ron stared at Harry with one eye a bit pinched in confusion, and Harry tried not to fidget under his gaze. “What’s going on with you today? You’re all over the place.”
Harry touched the watch. “I guess I just disagree. He seems like he’s changed to me. He was patient.” Although, he was also quick to fight. But then, Malfoy was always quick to fight, even as a child. “He seems to have a lot of respect for muggle things, and I know he spends a lot of time around them now. And, and I know he understands why he can’t be in the lab all the time, and even though it frustrates him, I think he’s respectful of that too.” Harry shrugged. “I don’t know that I could be as patient as him in the same situation. He seems different.”
That was something on his to do list, start drinking coffee, it was the drink of choice for the common man. He’d tried once, in Diagon Alley, but it hadn’t gone well. Maybe this would be better?
“If no one else will claim them, I will.” Malfoy reached out and touched the container. “They should go to someone-to someone--” He turned away and stormed towards the door without finishing his sentence, and Harry let him go.
Faye laughed, spitting her drink across the table. “Seriously? 150? They think we represent a third of the entire population?”
That gave Harry pause. What on Earth could possibly be that powerful? “I’ll find your stolen item, Unspeakable Atkinson.”
“That one’s mine.” Harry confirmed, and Malfoy nodded just once before disappearing into the room for him.
Robards shrugged and clasped his hands in front of him. “It’s still closed. I am sure you have lots of other work, and I expect a full report on this one from you.” Harry recognized a dismissal when he heard one, but he sat in the seat for a full minute. “Is there something else you need, Auror Potter?”
There are a few different links in this chapter. If you only look at two, I would recommend the Sound of Silence and the Squirrel obstacle course, because Phat Gus
Something warm tingled in Draco’s belly that felt an awful lot like relief. “Just what are you saying, Potter?”
“The Stubborn Goat.” Hermione exhaled, the reality of everything finally dawning on her. “You used to see him there, that’s why he was there that night.”
Since the war, a lot of witches and wizards had taken to patronizing magical and muggle establishments, which meant that on a Friday night, an Auror could find himself in any part of London having to look the part of a professional or blend into a crowd.
Harry gave him a teasing look. “Don’t be so sure about that. You definitely take up all the space in the bed.”
And Harry thought of Draco two floors up. That was another option although it still hinged on him convincing Draco to talk to Hermione. Was that likely to be more successful than trying to convince a stranger? And even if Harry could convince Draco, would Hermione even agree to meet with him?
“Oh, sometimes there’s Quidditch and Ron and Hermione have me over for dinner or we go to the Burrow. There’s always something to be done around the house.”
Who was saved by Rose. “Mama! Mama! That’s the man I ran into!” she shouted, drawing everyone’s attention to her and Hermione.
Narcissa rolled her eyes and then reached into the bag on her lap producing a bank statement from Gringotts. She unfolded the parchment and laid it out for Harry to read. “As you can see right here, someone has withdrawn a rather sizable sum from my son’s bank account.”
“That was an utter waste of my time!” he raged, throwing the files on Harry’s desk across the room. Harry watched with a sort of disassociation that usually only came during a duel in the field. “Where has he gone?!” he screamed. The other Aurors looked up and then quickly back at their desks.
She narrowed her eyes. “Well, no time like the present to learn. You help him peel those apples while I get these wings in the oven.” And then she turned her stern gaze from him to glare the oven into submission.
Malfoy jerked, knocking his head on something, and then he backed out of the fireplace. “Potter,” he said, wiping his dirty hands on the soft cotton of his trousers. “Thought I’d take a look at your floo.”
When the door shut behind them, and they were out in the silent car park, Val said, “He is skirting the line interfering with the investigation.”
“The fuck it doesn’t! You’re just a piece of trash. You don’t deserve--She’s a million times--Get the fuck out!”
Perhaps he didn’t need to go straight out and look for Draco, after all, he didn’t know where to start in the middle of the day. There was plenty of time to go back to Grimmauld Place, to take a nap, have a meal, take a shower. He’d go out later, when Malfoy would be out at all his usual haunts, terrorizing the local muggles and generally making a nuisance of himself. Harry would find him, put the fear of--of Harry in him, and then send him home to his mother like the petulant child he was.
He couldn’t stop himself from looking over at Ginny Weasley, but he was able to make himself look at Hermione too. Both of them stood up from the floor, and Draco locked eyes on Hermione. “Um, Harry’s still there, with Jude and Sarah, trying to get them out. Weasley said he’s--very angry. I guess they barricaded themselves in a cell.”
And Malfoy smiled at that, cracking more eggs into the skillet and sprinkling in more shredded cheese. “Yes, bleeding over all of London, not half, would most definitely be a blood magic thing.”
The Atrium was empty, save for Draco, he didn’t have his headphones or his mobile, but he could think about Tilly. About the way she smiled at him, about the playlist she’d made when he’d gone to Gringotts. How, even when the world was crashing down around him, she was always there for him, how he would always be there for her. He would be her luck, just like she was his. And suddenly, Draco wanted her fiercely, more than words could express, too much to wait to see her, not one minute longer.
Staring at the file was not going to solve this case. Harry pulled himself up and checked the time. Dr. Connor would be having office hours soon, perhaps Harry ought to pay him another visit.
“He said it last night. He was so angry, and words just kept coming out of his mouth. And it terrified Malfoy.” Ron stopped. “I think Malfoy’s in love with him too. How does that even happen?”
“I could smell you at school. It was just a little, but yesterday I could smell you.” He shrugged. “Mama says I have a good nose.”
Tilly sucked in a breath. “Maybe. I just need to remember that I can’t control her or what she does, I can only control me.” And then Tilly brightened considerably. “I can always leave. It’s my birthday after all, if I decide I don’t want to be there, I can just leave.”
“It’s okay,” Draco called, turning and looking through the room for the source. “I’m not going to hurt you or-or tell anyone. Can you just come out?”
Harry opted to walk home, because Grace was a muggle and it was not a terribly cold day. He could hear them laughing inside the apartment, and Harry paused outside the door just to listen for a moment. Draco had a nice laugh.
Ajax leaned a little to see before taking the bag from Harry. “Where’s Draco? Not like him to not make a delivery himself.”
“Uh-huh.” In Harry’s mind it was a place like their club, although, Harry remembered, Draco had said he went to a martini bar. Maybe he found him there? What did martini bars look like?
“So this potion--” Harry looked over a Teddy who was busy shoveling food into his mouth as fast as he possibly could and decided it was better not to finish that sentence
“Get the fuck out!” Harry shoved him until he stumbled over the hem of his trousers. “Just get the fuck out of my house!” He chased Malfoy from the room, forcing him down the stairs until he was able to shove him out the front door naked with an armful of clothes and only one shoe.
“No!” Hermione recoiled, and then leaned farther across the table. “I’m not going to go out and declare an undying love for him, but I’m not going to condemn you for seeing him either. I don’t know him. You said he’s living with Muggles and doesn’t use magic, and for you to want to spend time with him, he must be different now. I’m willing to give him a chance.”
“Potter,” Robard broke in tiredly, “I know that this is not the type of case our department normally handles or the way we usually handle them. But in this one and very specific situation, I am afraid that you are being assigned to work with the Unspeakable Atkinson until this matter is settled.”
Harry gaped a bit at his boss, and then said, “Isn’t that just what he does? I mean, I’ve seen him out at the clubs, hands all over some bloke. They’re probably just shacked up somewhere.” Of course, that bloke was usually
It might have been Draco’s only chance, so he took it. Darting out quickly and dashing through the kitchen, skidding around the corner to freeze at the sight of George, who stared back at him just as shocked. There was a noise in the kitchen, a scuffle and a shout, and George turned to look, but Draco didn’t. Took the moment to run right out the front door and down the block of row houses, all the pretty front gardens blurring together, until he vomited into a neighbor’s bushes, stomach heaving and heaving and heaving.
Draco took off his glasses to clean them while he blinked rapidly, then put them back on to read the other message. It was from Harry’s solicitor containing his Last Will and Testament as well as the deed to Grimmauld Place.
“The lifts are this way.” Harry pointed vaguely down the hall and they walked in silence for several minutes. “How’s Roxi?” Harry asked while waiting for the lift, because he couldn’t think of anything else to say.
Draco’s gaze quickly flickered to the door, where Grace was now standing. “Am I interrupting?” She asked, looking between Draco and Granger.
“And how do you think Harry Potter feels out there in the stands? Wishing he’d been on a broom Seeking?”
“And his research,” Hermione sighed a little longingly. “I mean, I can’t talk about it, but there are a lot of people who would put up with a rude boss just to be involved in that kind of work. It’s going to completely change the way we think about magic.”
And then he went back to bed, because that is what happened when a Were took wolfsbane. They felt like shit, like they were being poisoned, which is what wolfsbane was. As Draco lay in bed, for the first time ever, he let himself be angry at Sawyer, for being dead, for leaving him alone again, for having been part of Ajax’s Pack and never needing to take that damned wolfsbane.
Draco squeezed his eyes tight and then blinked them open. “Alright, Granger. I’ll try.” God, Sawyer had never asked him to do shit like this! And then, he thought, but maybe if Sawyer had he would have felt part of Ajax’s Pack the way he felt here in Grimmauld Place. He opened the door and stepped out into the hall. “I’m going to eat, Granger. You could join us.”
“It doesn’t have to be you! You don’t have to give up the things that you want just because you’re Harry Potter!” She raised her voice, not quite shouting, but loud and insistent.
“He is a Beast, and not our domain.” The Healer insisted, but softer now, more kindly. “We cannot put our other patients at risk.”
“Yeah, okay,” Jude nodded while staring at the table, and suddenly, Harry wanted fiercely for Jude to come home with him, not over the summer, not at the end of the day, but right now, wanted to make it right as soon as possible, before something could prevent it from happening at all.
“Yes?” Harry stared at her while still standing, and then realized she could only see his feet and dropped to his knees. “Yes, Niamh?”
“Fuck,” she groaned. “I hate dealing with the Police. Why can’t they ever just give us what we need?”
“She’s sleeping.” Teddy announced proudly. He even puffed out his chest, but Harry had a sinking sort of feeling in the pit of his stomach.
After the game, the team went out to celebrate with greasy food and lots of beer because Gwenog was out of the country for a coaching thing, and they had demolished their opponents.
“No,” Draco called from the sofa. “Not for the last half hour.” His hand flopped over the side of the sofa.
“Oh Draco, there is no need to be afraid,” Luis said, his voice smooth and soothing. “I want only to help. I want only to make things better. I am the only one who can make this world better.”
Reluctantly, Malfoy removed his hand, as everyone at the table turned to look at Harry. “Uh, sorry, I just, uh, need the toilet.” He looked at Malfoy who slid out of the seat.
“Yeah.” Harry fingered the small box in his pocket, suddenly nervous. It had seemed like such a good idea earlier, but now--maybe he should have gone with a gift card to that second hand record shop. But he was here now. Harry pulled the box out and tossed it at Draco instead of saying anything.
“The Hospital. But Grace, I can’t heal these people, I don’t have that kind of control.” Draco looked at her honey hair and heard the call of the storm again.
Eventually he could hear voices approaching the door, and a different sort of panic took hold, giving strength to his legs to dash around the corner, to hide.
“Stop that.” Harry lightly pushed Malfoy’s head away. “You need bandages and sleep at the very least.”
Harry stared. “No he doesn’t. He’s literally lived in the Department of Mysteries for the last year and a half and with an Unspeakable since the end of the war!” He shook his head in irritation.
“I can do it,” Draco offered, and Harry gripped his hand fiercely. “I can give interviews and talk to people.” Draco licked his lips. “But I’m only one Were, and I may not drum up much sympathy for people.
Draco stumbled to standing, and the crowd around them backed up. He sneered at them too, but she propelled him forward, stumbling and tripping over his own feet towards the door. He nearly fell when his foot caught on the threshold, and only Potter’s hand, snagged on his arm prevented him from splashing in a dirty puddle. He was oddly grateful for the rescue.
What was Harry doing here? Oh, yes, looking for a serial killer who might be out on the hunt right this very moment looking for an unsuspecting Were, might even be this bloke still pressed from knees to waist against Draco. “You shouldn’t be here!”
“How’s that godson of yours?” Val asked, knowing that it was a sure way to get Harry to talk, so they chatted about Teddy for a good twenty minutes. And then spent twenty minutes trying to explain to some American tourists how to find some pub neither of them had heard of.
They helped a wizarding couple exchange their galleons for pounds at a food truck, and then helped a lost witch find her muggle boyfriend. By then it was close to eleven and the drunken encounters started. Harry disarmed a young wizard silently before he could break the statute of secrecy, and Val talked down an angry witch who’d been about to curse her husband. They broke up a fight in a bar, and completely ignored a public urination because who had time for that paperwork
Was he going to hit him? Was Draco going to let Potter hit him? Should Draco strike first? His heart hammered at his ribs, and he was so
“Yeah,” Harry smiled. They’d gone to Victoire's birthday party a few months ago, back when he’d been on day shift. “They really do grow quick.”
“Would you care to see the gardens, Astoria?” Draco asked suddenly, cutting off any potential disagreement.
Harry nodded sympathetically, but it had been four months of nonstop outreach and she hadn’t made much headway. And while Harry wanted to help Hermione, while Shacklebolt insisted on having an Auror presence at these meetings to show the entire ministry was behind the movement, Harry just couldn’t spend all of his time thinking about outreach. He had cases to handle, and Grimmauld Place needed work, and there was Teddy and Andromeda, and sometimes he wanted to spend time with Ginny and figure out what was going on with that part of his life.
For a brief moment, Draco was confused, and then he realized Harry must mean the incident with the watch. “Oh, yes. I quite like the size of this one and it doesn’t leave lint all over my herbs.”
Sophie gave Harry a long look and sighed visibly. “Well, I met Dray when I was working at this coffee shop, but then Tilly comes into the bar one day, dragging him behind her and insisting Mr. Johnson give him the busboy job.”
Normally, Teddy’s fingers were busy on the pages, pointing out letters from school and talking about the leaves, trying to climb out of bed and demonstrate his own hopping skills. But not tonight, tonight he laid still in the bed, fingers tracing the pages because he was never completely still, but he wasn’t loud or laughing or demanding a third retelling. At the end of the book, he was still awake, but eyes half lidded and his fingers were running through his hair, self-soothing.
It wasn’t crowded inside, just a few people who had stopped by straight after work, and Jude was moving behind the counter greeting the blond woman with a cheery hello, gesturing towards something on the floor, tying an apron around his waist. The bar was long and covered the whole length of the room at the back. Harry turned away from it for a moment to look at the rest of the room, at the group of three clustered in a plain wooden booth, at the older man drinking alone at the far end of the bar, at the door leading to the back. The room was decorated in browns, and tans, and the occasional deep red. It was homey and comfortable, the kind of corner bar that catered towards regulars and people in the neighborhood more than tourists, which was surprising so close to King’s Cross.
“Jeeze, you’d think the Chosen One would have something…” He looked over the faded furniture and sooty rug. “Cleaner. I’d have thought it would definitely be cleaner.”
The conversation shifted from there to Ginny’s upcoming match, and Harry was able to listen without making too many comments. Which was good, as he was experiencing some internal turmoil over having feelings for a suspect. And then some down right horror at the idea that it was not just a suspect but Malfoy. It was easier to lose himself in a conversation over Quidditch. The Harpies were going to play against the Cannon’s, and Ron was innately at war over who to support.
They went to Mama Gigi’s house in Newark that afternoon, a tall redbrick row house that looked terribly run down on the outside. Harry stopped outside the building trying to picture Draco spending much of any time inside. It was hard to reconcile his small, minimalist flat with this rundown monstrosity.
“Great.” Harry moaned and flopped back in his chair. “Let’s get this over with,” he grumbled but stood up.
Teddy walked over to the bed, slipped his small hand inside Draco’s, and said very softly, “No one should be alone.”
How common was it to adjust the wolfsbane to the drinker? How common was it to add other ingredients? How pissed was Robards going to be when Harry went asking those questions? Technically Harry wasn’t pulled from the case yet, but this line of questioning could definitely get him thrown off it.
The other Weres from the raid had already been processed and charged, and now were waiting for their trial dates in Azkaban. But it was policy not to hold minors there, to release them into parental custody.
It wasn’t just coffee. Draco pressed his lips into a thin line and wrapped both hands around the cup as he gathered his courage to look at her and say, “I can’t thank you enough.”
“You are desked, Mr. Potter, two months, followed by a review of your behavior in the workplace. I cannot tolerate this level of insubordination! Now, get out of my office!” Robards shoved his chair back again and glared at Harry with his mouth in a thin pinched line and his face slowly turning the bright red of Teddy's firetruck.
“I can see that.” Harry stopped talking because Malfoy was now prowling towards him, eyes narrowed in a question. He took a step back as Malfoy showed no signs of stopping even though he was clearly invading Harry’s personal space. And then he took another, and another, until he was backed all the way up against the wall next to the door.
Harry wondered if Draco had been here when he’d been consulting last year. He’d known all sorts of interesting Muggle places, always had a recommendation at the ready.
It felt like, as long as Harry didn’t reciprocate, that maybe he was still respecting Draco’s wishes.
It wasn’t until after Neil stormed out of the room, and a cashier came running out with a handful of towels, that Draco stopped laughing enough to wipe the tears from his cheeks and mutter a breathless, “oh my, please tell me you did that on purpose.”
Malfoy put his hand on Harry’s to stop it from wondering any farther, he went a bit still, and Harry knew.
At those words, Draco did look up, looked her in the eye, searched her face for some sort of hidden agenda and found nothing. His stomach tightened, and Draco didn’t think he would be able to eat a single bite of breakfast.
“Excellent!” Harry smiled and held out a hand. “Let’s go to school. Do you think you can skip the whole way?”
They moved slow and careful, a gentle plundering of each other’s mouths, light fingers across skin for long slow minutes, until Ginny was gasping and Harry was half hard.
“So,” Draco looked up at the sky while he tried to find the words. “We may have run across Sarah while she was running from Greyback a while ago, and Neil agreed to take her somewhere safer.”
So Ron talked about helping Arthur sort out some things in the garage and how his Mum had made this huge meal and then it had just been the three of them. So, she badgered Ron into stopping over at the shop to see if George was still working, dragging what had to have been half the leftovers.
“For the love of shit,” scoffed the bloke behind him, and then he reached around to spin Harry and punched him square in the jaw.
at the idea that Harry would marry Ginny. Harry swallowed hard and let his fingers fall from the front of the drawer. He hadn’t been bothered because Harry was supposed to marry Ginny, she was the love of his life. Voldemort had stolen that happy ending from his parents, and Ginny was Harry’s opportunity to right that wrong.
Harry hadn’t really thought about the war in a long time. Of course, he did think about it occasionally, there were the reminders at Hogwarts, in the statues around Wizarding England, in the way the Auror department handled certain suspects or crimes. But that was just how life went. Seeing all that through Malfoy’s eyes, it must be like the war just happened for him with little reminders everywhere that Harry didn’t see anymore.
Roxi reached across the table and put her hands over Draco’s, felt the chill in them despite the warmth of the room. “Do you think he is going to do something?”
Suddenly, for the first time, Harry wanted to tell someone, not just someone but her. He wanted to tell Hermione, and once he started the words just kept falling out of his mouth, one after the other in a torrential downpour that wouldn’t stop until it had run out. “Draco. I’ve been looking for him; it’s my case. It shouldn’t be, but it is, and I finally found him. He withdrew a huge sum from Gringotts. He was there and he had blue hair and he didn’t look like himself. And it wasn’t a glamour because you can’t have that in Gringotts anymore. How did he make his hair blue?”
Harry heard things too. He heard Malfoy complain about not having a microwave, and Andromeda made some sort of approving noise as they both carried dinner into the dinning room. Malfoy was always very attentive to Andromeda, listening carefully when she chose to speak, helping clear the table without asking, inquiring after her evening. Andromeda didn’t hide her animosity or the long considered looks, but her demeanor changed a little after dinner one evening
Draco’s smile wasn’t soft or slow any more, but something sharp and a little bit wicked. “And then I think we should go dancing and drinking, and I am going to shove my tongue down your throat and maybe into another hot, warm place.”
“Jude lives with Harry right now,” Draco answered for him. “And I know Harry. If Jude doesn’t go home, then Harry will call out every Auror. He will tear the city apart to find Jude. You don’t want to go to his place, that’s completely fine. But come to mine. You and Jude. Jude can text Harry he’s staying with me, Harry won’t question it. And we don’t have to say anything about you at all, not until you’ve decided what you want to do.”
They both paused as Andromeda opened the front door and a large group of people stepped inside. They were boisterous and jostling each other as she led them down the hall and through the kitchen into the dining room.
Draco had squealed and flailed and knocked the cup over as Harry had been slipping his hands into Draco’s pants.
There was a moment of stunned silence, and then furious talking. Sophie fell into one of the stools in shock. Blake shook his head and started talking about brushing up his CV. Evan was quietly telling Tilly it would be fine, they’d all get new jobs in no time. Everyone wants to hire a good looking bartender.
“I don’t know this one either.” James repeated his ritual. “May you run forever in the home of our ancestors.”
“But of course.” Astoria smiled prettily up at him, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “My mother is quite proud of dessert, treacle tart. I understand it’s your favorite.”
Harry squeezed his hands tightly. “You were told to leave him alone, that we would go up and say good night at the end of the party. Why didn’t you wait? Why did you bring Rosie up here?”
“Okay,” she tucked herself up close to him, and Harry thought he might jump out of his skin but forced himself to breathe and breathe again. “Why don’t we go sit down, hm?”
“You’re nothing!” Harry’s fingers scrambled to grab something, anything. Draco’s shirt slipped in his tight grip, and he threw it uselessly. But they were back on script now. “Just rubbish who doesn’t understand what it means to love someone!”
The article came out Saturday morning, the day of the big speech, the anniversary Harry had been trying so hard not to think about. He read it over breakfast at the kitchen table in Grimmauld Place. Front page, with two different pictures: the one of Harry holding the bag, of course, but there was also one of Harry leaning over the counter and pointing at a ring. And Harry had to wonder just who had taken that picture.
Harry tried to concentrate on his breathing, he couldn’t really pay attention to the space around him. Ron was talking again, hadn’t stopped actually, except for that brief break to apparate. He said something about Fleur, and Harry fought the urge to grab Ron by the robes and shout that he
“Oh, no, not at all. I’m sure you Aurors are always busy. There must not be a lot of time for all the boring stuff. That’s why I ended up in Booking, I was always good at completing my written assignments. It was the physical stuff that was a challenge. Never did get the hang of a patronus. I heard you managed to conjure one in third year! That’s pretty impressive.”
Draco hesitated in the putrid air as more screaming assaulted his ears and the metal beasts roared across the Black Not-Water. He sniffed, and there was something of the Man-Prey. Not knowing where to find his Pack, he followed the Man-Prey with an easy, loping stride. There was other prey around, and the metal beasts, and the smell of smoke and cooked meat that he ate in his other form. And there was the Man-Prey.
“Admitting you want to change is the first step to actually changing, Harry.” Draco said softly, putting one hand on Harry's face and turning him to press a soft, sweet kiss to his lips. The first kiss in so, so long. It wasn’t fierce or demanding or needy, or any of the other things they had shared before. This was soft and sweet, like the nights they sat at the bar after closing, talking about Draco’s monthly teas with Narcissa. This was the way his fingers still sometimes tangled with Harry’s after a few drinks as they walked from the bar to a chip shop, this was the way those same fingers brushed up against each other oily and salty and perfect.
Harry shook his head as the detection charm fluttered across his skin. "Just a disillusionment." He didn't mentioned the banishing charms, those had been outside the radius, thank Merlin.
Ron stretched and took another sip of his beer. “It’s not. We don’t know what we want, so mostly it’s just looking at adverts and Hermione saying, ‘ooh, this one has heated floors.’ and me saying ‘We have magic, we can have heated floors in any house.’ It’s fun to look though. How’s things at Grimmauld Place? You finally manage to get into that shed yet?”
Harry gathered the tedious forms and glanced over the questions: name, age, age when bitten, distinguishing marks or tattoos, address, vocation, employer, sire, known associates. The questions went on and on thanks to Hermione. The idea was to track and eventually prevent, but Harry was pretty sure most of the data was falsified. But false data was still helpful--according to Hermione.
“You know, this might be a good thing. Hermione has a lot of ideas about legislation for Werewolves and--”
While Harry’s attention flickered between the two of them, Sarah reached out and shoved Harry with every bit of her small frame until Harry tumbled over the back of the sofa and she dashed towards the door.
It jerked Harry back into the present moment painfully. “So what if I am. He’s not the same arsehole he used to be.” He was a very different arsehole.
Hot burning tore through Harry, cut him in two, so painful he couldn’t scream. And blood gushed out, soaking through his clothes and running onto the floor. Harry tried to look, to see the damage, but he couldn’t move his head without nearly blacking out from the pain.
Malfoy flicked the lighter closed, wrapped his hand around the blue plastic. “God knows, but I think I trust you.” He pushed himself off the wall. “You know where the flat is?”
“It itches like mad, and you feel wrong in your own skin, and there’s this nearly overwhelming need to run, but I won’t shift.”
And the four of them all cheered. Sarah froze in the door until Jude wrapped his arms around her fiercely, and she buried her face in his chest for a long while. Draco watched the two of them, a quiet, happy thing blooming in his chest despite the confused thing that had been growing there for the last several weeks. He watched the way that Jude tucked himself around Sarah, how Sarah’s hands gripped tightly at Jude’s shirt.
The Atrium was always crowded at this time of day, people trying to leave early, others coming in to pay fines or drop off paperwork. There were those headed for probation appointments (more and more of those since the end of the war) and those applying for apparition licenses. Harried parents dragging small children with errant creatures on leashes for registration and veterinary appointments on level four. There were even people carrying broomsticks headed to or from the department of Magical Games and Sports to request a pitch reservation.
The first time Longbottom showed up at the Port, on a busy Friday, Draco didn’t say anything to anyone. Longbottom never approached him, just sat at his table, nursing his beer and keeping a clear line of sight on the bartop. Draco tried not to let his nerves show, but his hands shook when he took his own dinner break in the office.
She snatched his left hand and yanked it towards herself, flipping it palm up as she went. “What the fuck?” The both looked at where the blood and yellow bile had stained his shirt, leaving a perfect white oval in the middle. Tilly reached to the cuff, to pull it back.
Granger stood there, caught in the middle of tapping her toe and holding a briefcase. “Oh, I was afraid you wouldn’t answer. Harry told me not to go in if you didn’t answer.”
Harry reached out because there was no way in hell he was going to let this one go, but She tugged the bloke far enough out of Harry’s reach. And then they were dashing down the hall, towards the person running past them and towards Harry. Benson, Harry realized and scowled. He started to chase after them anyway, but Benson latched onto his arm and shouted, “What are you doing?”
He spent the afternoon pretending to do paperwork and watching through the door of Savage’s office for any sign of Malfoy. He listened to the idle conversation of other Aurors as they walked down the hall while pretending to look at crime scene photos. And he watched the door to Robard’s office from the kitchen while a cup of unwanted tea steeped. And he actually argued with Savage about a trip to Records for some stupid file at four thirty because he hadn’t seen Malfoy in the office yet.
“It’s not a big deal.” Ginny shrugged. “The Wimbourne Wasps sent one to our game against Slytherin last month. They said they were very interested in me, but nothing’s been decided. I still have the rest of the year to go.”
And Roxi thought how relieved Draco would be; she’d call him and maybe he’d come over to her mother’s for dinner. An impromptu celebration. “Well, glad we could be of help.” She nodded and reached for her files again because Luis was still smiling and it was actually starting to make her a little uncomfortable.
The tetchy bartender was working and gave Harry a constipated look when he appeared in the doorway. Harry scanned through the patrons, but didn’t see Malfoy. He closed his eyes and gathered some strength to walk over to the counter. Instead of daring sitting on a stool, Harry leaned against the bartop. The bartender rolled his eyes and finished a blue cocktail before raising one eyebrow at Harry.
Hermione picked up her tea cup with both hands, and Harry noticed how very still she was sitting. “Maybe you should drink the tea.” And chills went down Harry’s spine.
They both stared in varying degrees of horror as wires, gears, connectors, and even a crank scattered loudly across the floor.
“I’m not going.” Malfoy shuffled to standing, moving away from Harry and towards the counter. He said it softly but firmly, a quiet tone Harry didn’t think he’d ever heard from Malfoy.
Harry and Val shook their heads. “Thank you, Delores, it was delicious as always. My compliments to the chef.” Shockingly, Malfoy didn’t sneer, but their waitress did just before she turned and left.
“I’m not going to take advantage of you.” Harry sat back on his heels, cock straining out between them, and Malfoy licked his lips at the sight of it.
“It didn’t break you.” Astoria pointed out. “You went abroad, you built a life, you sought to understand that which you had been taught to hate.” They made it to the end of the hall, and Astoria led him around a corner. “These are the private studies. I must confess the reason I was late this evening.”
“Friends?” Draco snarled. “Friends?” He crossed the space between them in one long step and leaned forward, not touching, not nearly close enough for that, and breathed deeply through his nose.
Harry was getting a little breathless himself remembering when Draco did that to him. “Thought you were the one fucking him?”
But Harry took a pinch of powder and stepped into the fire. “The Leaky Cauldron.” And he was popping out into the grimy bar where Ginny was waiting.
“It wasn’t a quarrel.” Harry said sullenly to the pavement. “It’s just dangerous for him to be out, what with a serial killer on the loose and all that.”
“We are trying to instigate some reforms to the Anti-Werewolf legislation and I wanted to speak with all of you to have a better understanding of how these laws impact your lives and what changes could be most beneficial to you and the wizarding populations.”
Draco shrugged again, trying very hard to be casual. “I’m over at Neil’s most nights. I can sleep on the sofa the others. Just until she finds a more permanent thing.”
Draco would never quite be sure. He could only hear the maniacal laughter and the screams of the innocents, of Professor Burbage and that muggle girl who had wandered too close to the Manor. There were the sobs of his mother late a night in the Parlour when everyone but Draco and her were asleep, and there were what Draco realized were his own whimpers of pain. He could hear Doby and Ollivander and Luna crying softly together in the dungeons and Bellatrix’s casting over and over and over.
Hours later, Harry was inspecting the spellwork on the motorcycle when Jude interrupted. “You, uh, got a call,” he hedged from several meters away.
Harry looked down at the journal one last time. He’d lost track of time while reading the damn thing.
Draco knelt down in front of him, took Teddy’s hands in his, and Teddy squeezed with more strength then a six year old should have. “It’s the moon, you know, it’s going to be all gone on Sunday. That’s why you feel like this, itchy and tired and wanting to be near your family.”
The next morning, Tilly called him from the bar early in the morning. Not that Draco was sleeping, not after last night. “I wouldn’t have called if it weren’t--strange.”
That was until he heard the scrap of a shoe frighteningly close behind him. He turned quickly in his chair, heart racing something horrid.
“Yeah.” Harry didn’t say anything about how Robards was making subtle jabs about the Werewolf Support Services or the attempts at moving them from Beasts to Beings classification. And Harry had made one too many impassioned arguments in their favor, and Robards had put him on permanent night shift to prove his own point about the ruckus caused by Weres. It was an exhausting situation.
“Hey! I’m the wizard who defeated Voldemort!” Harry shouted back. “I took on the Ministry during the war and fought in the battle of Hogwarts. I died! And it didn’t take very well, did it?”
Draco waited until he could hear him on the second floor before letting out his breath and inhaling again.
“Sure.” Ron and Hermione moved on, and Harry finished greeting the rest of the guests. Speeches would be next, before the guests became too inebriated to listen but after everyone had a chance to relax. Harry usually went last, a fact he always appreciated and hated. His was the speech people would remember, but it would be through a slightly drunken haze. McGonagal always went first and spoke for a long time about unity and peace, the importance of education and community.
The feeling lingered while he tried to drink tea and when they flooed to King’s Cross to retrieve Hermione and Ginny. A baby cried somewhere on either platform nine or ten, and Harry kept trying to find it. It had to be in some mother’s arms, right? No one had abandoned it underneath a bench somewhere? The people around him could hear it, weren’t ignoring it? Were they?
It was harder for Malfoy to detangle himself as Teddy had grabbed his shirt, and pushed his leg over one of Malfoy’s. And it was with surprising patience, that Harry watched Malfoy slowly uncurl his fingers and carefully ease his leg out of the bed. But he paused before actually getting out of the bed, “He won’t wake, will he?”
Harry looked at Andromeda who shook her head and gave a miniscule shrug. They both heard the back door open and shut. “I’m going to see what’s going on.” And then Harry was carrying his plate to the kitchen before stepping out into the pleasant evening air.
Luckily Harry had pants on. “Get this straight, that--” he pointed at the bed. “That is my space, it’s private and we will not be discussing it. Additionally, I am not going to sleep with someone at the center of an investigation. That’s not going to happen.” He ran his hands through his hair. “Go take a shower and put on those clothes.”
Harry rubbed the scar on his hand again. “I told you, I didn’t do it for you, I’m solving a case. Can’t solve a case without all the facts, and so far, you’re the only fact I have.” He got out a skillet and broke two eggs into a bowl.
It was one thing to look at Malfoy and think he looked like sex, to see him with his trousers and his earrings. It was quite another to witness the rapture on another man’s face while his cock was buried in Malfoy’s mouth. And then they were trading places, and Harry was still stuck staring, what expressions would Malfoy make. Would he make those same faces if it were Harry on his knees?
“Normally, this time of the month, you can hardly keep me out, good thing I have you. You’ll keep me out of trouble, right?”
“Course. Can’t have you rushing off on your own and getting hit by the Knight Bus. The world would never forgive me then.” Malfoy tucked his arm around Harry. “Are you okay to apparate? Or-or can you give me your address?”
All those eager looks suddenly got a lot more cautious. And then one brave soul lowered her camera and said, “It was in Witch Weekly this morning. That-that the reason you and Ginevra Weasley called it quits was because-well, you’re gay.”
Sarah sighed again. “That’s what Jude said. But then he said he was going and he would really like it if I went with him.”
Blaise Zabini lived in Germany, the next closest person on the list, so they went to Germany. And then the Netherlands to see Theodore Nott. Neither of whom had heard a peep from Malfoy in over five years, both with and without the veritaserum.
Draco turned to look at him again, at the sag in his posture and the way he dragged his teeth across his bottom lip. “You know there isn’t anyone else like him. I don’t know if there’s never been, but right now, he’s the only half Were in all of London, probably England.”
“Yes,” Narcissa smiled, something small and genuine. “That’s really all any of us can do, isn’t it? Ask?”
She was an absolute natural, Harry realized listening to her. She was charming and light and happy, and sure, the questions were easy, but the mere idea of standing up there talking off the cuff to an announcer, knowing someone was listening to it on the WWN? The idea of it made Harry feel ill.
They did, and Neville and then Luna and then George all came over to the table, all sat and talked and looked at Harry with concern. Neville made eyes at Ron across the table, and Ron shrugged, “He got a lead on an old case.”
Draco growled a little. He could smell Teddy on the stairs. “I don’t think that is any of your business.” The little footsteps passed the parlour door; the little guy must be more interested in the smell of eggs then Hermione.
And Harry pulled out and pushed back in, couldn’t stop himself even if he wanted, a mindless drive forward and closer and more. He reached underneath to pull Malfoy’s hips tighter against his own, and Malfoy got his own hand underneath to yank at his cock and splutter half words and groans.
Draco heaved another sigh. It had always been serious between them, even at the tender age of eleven. “It’s slow, think Mike will let me leave a little early?”
Harry drank in the sight of him, couldn’t seem to get over his amazement at being able to see Draco at all. He took in the dark trousers and crisp white shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows. He looked so calm, how did he always look so calm? Harry didn’t remember him ever looking calm, not at school, not after the war. He’d always sneered menacingly or frowned excessively or laughed uproariously or walked around with that pinched, fearful expression. How could he be calm?
And Harry played with the condensation on his pint glass and didn’t ask if Draco ever thought about them, if he ever had regrets. If things were different now.
“But sir!” Harry refused to back down. “I am telling you now, if we don’t do something, if we don’t treat them like the people they are and take crimes against them just as seriously they are going to revolt against us! Doing nothing to save Draco will make everyone less safe!”
“Oh Potter, I’ve just heard that Weasley is out, and--” He spotted Malfoy. “I see you’ve already found him. If you could just escort Mr. Malfoy to level Nine, Ms. Granger-Weasley’s office, I would appreciate that.” And then he was hurrying back the way he came shouting for Dean Thomas and his partner Elliot.
Everything hit the floor, the sofa fell so hard a leg broke, as did many of the dishes. And Malfoy turned to face Harry, but couldn’t see him. His pupils were pinpricks and unfocused. He flipped his hand, and the debris parted.
But Draco picked up the conversation. “Having lived through a war, I find the Muggle wars to be interesting. We’ve never really had a war like they have, the kind that encompases nearly the whole planet.”
Tilly gave him a look and then gestured towards the array of fruit in front of her. “I’m doing this, and I can’t help you.”
They were all starting to blur together a bit. Harry rubbed his eyes, and then went to the kitchen for a hot cup of tea. No one else was in the room, no one to distract him from the headache that was forming at the base of his skull. He looked at the posters on the wall and watched the steam rise from his cup as it steeped and tried very hard not to think.
“I wouldn’t ever!” Harry shouted, shoving Draco back. “How dare you compare me to him! I would never ever steal someone’s magic. I wouldn’t--” But there was a voice in the back of his mind, he made Dumbledore drink all that poison, hadn’t he? He’d slept with a suspect in an investigation, hadn’t he? Maybe he hadn’t been as awful as Atkinson, but that didn’t make him innocent either. “I never wanted to hurt you,” Harry said at last.
He groaned loudly and turned back to the floo. “What do you want from me, Harry? I said I’m sorry and it won’t happen again.”
“What are you drinking?” Ginny asked. Malfoy didn’t answer, and Harry wasn’t sure if that was because he wanted one or not.
On Thursday, Harry Potter was seen exiting the esteemed Trinkets carrying a suspiciously small bag. Has our Hero decided it’s time to settle down with his beautiful girlfriend, Ginny Weasley? Here at the Daily Prophet, we sincerely hope so. It’s time for a little happiness to shine down on Harry Potter, and what could be happier than the sound of wedding bells?
“We dated a little,” Ginny admitted. “But then he realized he was gay, and I decided I was into guys who were less rude,” she said pointedly.
Andromeda turned and watched Draco shrug, then moved aside to let Hermione through the floo. She stepped through, brushed nonexistent soot from her clothes, and then looked up to see Draco Malfoy standing in the doorway. “What are you doing here?” She scowled angrily.
Thompson spluttered a bit, it wasn’t strictly procedure for Harry to do this, but he wasn’t exactly willing to let Thompson rile James up again for no reason. James followed Harry sedately down the hall, and when Harry locked the cell he had to quell the urge to apologize.
Draco nodded in agreement. “It’s funny to me, over there, the muggles have all of these race issues and fights about religion that just aren’t as important in England. But they don’t have much pureblood culture. They know about it, but the wizarding families there just aren’t as old as here, and they never had status like here either. So it’s not a thing. The Dark Lord would have had a tough time gaining followers over there.”
Jude walked into the room and flopped down on the bed, dust puffing into the air as he did. “It’s fine. I’ve slept in worse.”
Heroine took another deep breath. “No one wants to put Sarah at risk, but we also need to catch Greyback. Sarah may have information that is helpful, all Robards wants right now is to talk.” She turned her calm gaze from Harry to Sarah. “If you are feeling up to it now, that is.”
He finally dropped his arm, and turned fully towards her. It caused his shoulders to hunch in slightly, and he suddenly looked small. The sight pulled at Roxi; he so rarely dropped the pretense.
Draco debated where to start, and then decided he probably ought to start with answering the questions Weasley hadn’t asked. “I know Harry drank too much sleeping potion last night. He told me he’d been thinking about it.” Draco wouldn’t tell Ron about how Harry wanted to leave Ginny, how he complained about being Head of the DMLE or that he regretted not suggesting Ron take the position. He would not spill Harry’s secrets, only his own. “For fifteen years now, sometimes, when I dream, I dream of Harry.”
Which was the moment two things happened. First, Narcissa Malfoy returned to the room with a gasp and she ran to the side of the bed where, secondly, Draco had shifted. He groaned enthusiastically, his whole face clenched in pain, and he clutched at his side, where the bullet had pierced him. Both Harry and Narcissa reached out at the same moment to clasp his hand and their fingers brushed. They glanced at each other with twin expressions of exhaustion and fear, and Narcissa collapsed in the chair with her hand over Draco’s. Harry leaned over and pressed his lips to Draco’s forehead.
“Yeah,” Draco smiled blissfully at Tilly and Evan at the other end of the bar. “I think it’ll last.”
Harry remembered that he wanted to ask Draco about the Wolfsbane Potion. “Have you ever heard of someone getting really sick after taking the wolfsbane potion?”
He stopped at a street corner, looked at the signs and then up and down the road in either direction. “I think it’s this way.”
And Draco smiled, soft and slow and he breathed, filling his lungs and remembered what his therapist had said. “The kind that’s going to get out of here and eat a stupid amount of thai before dragging the both of you through every aisle of the bookstore.”
Luckily, Ron materialized out of the haze. “Thank Merlin!” He rushed over to them. “Harry and Robards won’t stop screaming, and this infernal mist is making it impossible for any of us to get close to the hold cells!” He hurried them towards the first barrier, waving his wand in some sort of pattern that matched the lights. “We put the barriers up to try and contain the mist, but it’s effects are limited.”
Harry did sit down then, watched as Draco clicked on a small icon, as the word Google showed up on the screen, as he began to type in the white box. “What do you mean?”
Absently, Malfoy reached up to his collarbone. He was quiet for a long moment, running his fingers across the bone to the hollow at his throat and back. “He’s hard but fair, I suppose. The Pack respects him, they’d have to, or they wouldn’t be in the Pack.”
Draco flashed Harry a quick smile and steered Jude to the other side of the store, to look at shirts and trousers leaving Harry to deal with Madam Malkin. “He needs some robes, for Hogwarts.”
“I--” Draco started, shocked at the offer and how much he wanted it. And then he remembered shouting at Harry, was it really just twenty-four hours ago?. “Maybe.”
“I’m dressed,” Draco said, fingers busy with the buttons of his shirt.  He’d left the shoes and one sock on the floor.
But it wasn’t, it wasn’t ever sex between them. And while Draco would have quite happily let Sawyer push him against a wall or into a mattress or down to his knees, Sawyer wasn’t interested in that. And that was okay with Draco because having Sawyer was more important than sex with Sawyer. And if Draco watched Sawyer undress, and thrust languidly up against him in the small hours of the morning while he was still mostly asleep, and laid himself across Sawyer’s lap while they watched telly, that was okay too, because Sawyer needed Draco just as much as Draco needed him and they both knew which lines not to cross.
Where Harry was perfectly framed. With his messy hair and his dirty street clothes and that look of relief, as if he expected Draco to be somewhere else.
No to the hot nurses, she actually has a mole with hair growing out of it.I might pay money to hear you sing. HP
The restaurant was on the first floor of the hotel, just off the lobby, and Tilly looked decidedly out of place. Draco squeezed her hand. “Thank you for coming with me.”
“Wait!” Teddy slapped his hand over the words. “Draco! You have to hear the story too. It’s important to read a story before bed. It helps you sleep.” And then he was patting the space next to him instantly.
“Clearly it is!” Hermione turned, hand on her hip. “Look, I think it’s time you acknowledge that the two of you are just too different to make this work long term!”
“They did this to one of their own?” Harry could hear the hesitation in his own voice, and wondered vaguely if he was more upset that Ajax had beaten someone in his pack or that he hadn't realized Malfoy was a Werewolf.
“Merlin you do!” Harry’s birthday, the sudden change in his demeanor that Ron hadn’t been able to explain, that night at the Port, the way Hermione would never say anything when Ron asked when Harry was going to propose. It all made so much sense now!
Harry put his drink down on the side table and turned to look at the bottles on the bar. “I didn’t mean for us to get in a fight.”
Surprisingly, Malfoy knocked on the door. “Come in.” Harry turned in his chair and watched Malfoy with his bags of parts.
Harry picked up his third drink, determined to make it last a little longer, and began to walk through the room. He spotted the redhead, and managed to make eye contact. “Hello.” Harry said.
Suddenly, Draco’s arms snapped to his sides, his legs sprang together, and his whole body went rigid on the stool. He swayed for a moment and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. His jaw was clenched tight leaving only his eyes to move. He watched, in horror, as Luis’s feet came into view. What had happened to him? Why couldn’t he move? Luis had not cast, he wand had not moved, no words had left his mouth.  How was Draco frozen?
“It doesn’t really matter because at that point Atkinson came into the room and summoned all of Malfoy’s things back and gave the others a real dressing down.”
The bartender gave him a friendly smile. He looked like a thug, with the thick black tattoo curling around his forearm and the well muscled shoulders. “What can I get you?” he asked with a big smile that immediately put Draco at ease.
“That’s what I said, but the girl in the floo insisted her apprentice had shown up but couldn’t find the door.”
And that was how it went until just after 3am, Thompson and Aziz were back again, this time with a young man in a body bind and a muzzle, a Were. Only Weres had to be muzzled. His eyes were fierce and darting through the room. He was muscled and dressed in dark denims and a dark shirt, blood on his knuckles. There was something about the way his eyes moved that caught Harry’s attention, something about the way they looked at everything.
It wasn’t a great place for conversation though, with the roaring of fans and the detailed commentary that blasted overhead, so Harry never did find out what Mrs. Weasley said. Instead, Harry lost himself in the game in a way he hadn’t been able to lose himself in anything lately. He watched the dazzling way Gwenog Jones launched the bludger down the pitch at unsuspecting Chasers and knocked the Quaffle from between their hands with pure awe. Neither Seeker was particularly adept, but Harry found it amusing to realize he had seen the snitch twice while they were circling a bit aimlessly above. He didn’t have to wonder if someone might be cheating or hexing players or wonder whether Dementors were about to storm the pitch.
Malfoy sighed softly and then moved farther up the bed. He laid down on his side next to Teddy, and Teddy pulled the book onto his lap so that Malfoy would be able to see the pictures too. In his normal, low pitched voice, Harry read the first page of Guess How Much I Love You, and Teddy pointed out the big rabbit and the little rabbit while Malfoy huffed softly.
“Yeah, I know, alright!” Draco shouted. “And if you’d been there, then you could have dealt with Potter. But I know him, yeah.” Draco pulled his shirt up. “These aren’t all from Greyback. I know Potter, and he wasn’t about to just let me walk out of there.”
He stood, hands clasped behind his back, as Robards spoke. “I’m assigning you a missing persons.” he tossed a folder onto the desk and leaned back. “Bit high profile. Tracker already on the wand, mother says he hasn’t been home in over three days.”
He threw himself off the bed in defeat and then sat at the table where he spent fifteen minutes unlocking his phone and looking at the wallpaper picture of Sawyer. It didn’t hurt quite as badly, hadn’t since Sunday night, since Teddy. Draco tossed his phone on the table and buried his head in his hands. He was so fucked.
“You shouldn’t have.” Harry reached up and ran his fingers lightly across Draco’s jaw. “You didn’t even say goodbye.”
Harry ignored the sarcasm, but irritation was bubbling up again. “I thought you were sleeping on the sofa.”
Granger wrote that down. “Fifty-fifty? But how did they all survive the bite? It normally kills muggles since they can’t treat it.”
Harry didn’t care much for this part of the job either, although he didn’t like it for muggles or magical people. He’d had more than enough death for this lifetime. He nodded at Val and they walked over to the door where Harry pressed the intercom button.
They were holding hands, and Harry had the basket while Draco considered the breakfast cereals. “He needed you to tell him where you hid what you stole.”
Draco stepped out in the Atrium where a few other people were also making their way out of the ministry for lunch. No one gave him more than a passing glance though. Once outside, he pulled out his mobile (the true inspiration for his computer project, and the first test subject) to look up a hardware store. A and H Brass in Paddington seemed like it might have most of the things Draco needed and according to the internet, a wide range of interesting restaurants within a short distance of the station. Not that there wouldn’t be interesting places near all of the station, but it seemed as good a reason as any to go to Paddington.
