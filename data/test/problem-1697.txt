“Alright,” decided Harry, crossing his arms together just to look intimidating. He'd hope he looked intimidating in Malfoy's eyes. “But whatever you want to say to me, you say it in front of them." He gestured to both Ron and Hermione.
By the time Harry and his friends arrived at the Great Hall, presents were already placed on the table of each house, bright and thoughtful and they were wrapped in their house's colour. The Slytherins were already there at their table, having their breakfast and Harry caught Draco’s eyes and was sent a wink as he walked to the Gryffindor's table.
“Scorp, maybe we should take it slowly.” Albus whispered.
“It's not my place to say!” countered Hermione.
Draco continues to sing, counting down the ducks and restarts when the song ended. He rocks and bounce the baby gently as he whimpers, and soon all Draco hears was silence.
"He fainted while he was working one day, seven years after he gave birth and Hermione was the one who brought him to St Mungos and it was how we found out about it." explained Harry.
"Yes, and I took an advantage on you too." said Harry, with a seriousness. "We're even now."
Malfoy squeaked.
An elegant snort was heard followed by a goodbye kiss that was dropped on Harry's cheek before he can even comprehend what has happened and Hermione quickly shouted; “We'll catch you soon!”
Draco rolled his eyes, "You don't understand, he doesn't need my forgiveness." he sighed then, lips pursed tightly as he threw his gaze towards the open window. "I already forgave him a long time ago."
“Also, because their intention did not disturb the balance of magic.” added Granger.
At the sight, Ginny finally allowed herself to smile fondly. "I will take care of him with my life, Harry."
“Of course we do!” Albus giggled, “You're our uncle!”
All of them surrounded the photo instantly, eager to take a look.
Draco made a face, then made a move of straightening down his robe to cover up the sudden awkwardness he felt; perhaps embarrassed of the way he acted in front of Harry. He brought his gaze down then, hands pinching and pulling the fabric of his robe, as if the piece of clothing he was wearing was a new specimen that he had never seen before.
“Well, do you like girls?” asked Hermione.
"Not in a million years." Harry replied, tilting his head up in a challenging manner. "You need to be supervised. Merlin's knows what else is going to happen if you're not supervised."
“Al, come here!” Scorpius whispered sharply and Albus scrambled to his leg in an instant, walking towards his brother with a quick pace.
A set of identical grins answered her invitation. They were making their way towards the gargoyle when Scorpius timidly tugged down McGonagall’s robe.
It took Hogwarts a year after the war to be reopened; and naturally, along with his fellow friends who didn't managed to complete their seventh year because of the said war, supplementary of not knowing what to do with himself now that he was officially free from the clutch of a lunatic man, Harry figured he might as well take his NEWTs; not that Hermione hadn't been grinding the idea to both Ron and him the moment she heard that Hogwarts has been rebuilt. Thus, they have come with a mutual agreement of coming back to Hogwarts even before they received the official letters from Headmistress Mcgonagall herself.
There were a few moments of silence as the two of them watched as Headmistress McGonagall pressed her lips together as if contemplating the information she has just received. “Harry Potter's son.” she began, and they nodded. “I am sure Mr. Potter is currently sitting at the Great Hall with his friends.”
"Yea, well." shrugged Ron. "You didn't really tell us you already knew Malfoy was the one who has been snogging you senseless so we didn't think it was a matter."
“Make sure we got everything first!” said Scorpius frantically, and Albus groaned in irritation. “We've already checked it, thrice! We got everything! We'd better hurry up before dad comes here!”
"What is?"
"I can, and I will." said Harry. "Why won't you give us a chance?"
“Don't be an idiot. A simple Episkey can heal this.” He runs a finger to his lips and Harry pull it away as he cast the healing spell softly. He smiled in satisfaction when his boyfriend’s face free of blood and injury, so he dropped a soft kisses on the healed face. Harry pulled away to see Draco smiled at him fondly, reaching out to caress his face. They share kisses again, in between smiles and soft laughter when Harry suddenly remembered something.
Draco turned to him, scoffing as he regarded Harry. "Do I need to remind you that we haven't even taken our NEWTs yet?"
A perfect opposite hair colour of black and white-blond.
“I could never be mad at you, Love.” Draco sighed, glancing at the man next to him.
“I'm doing great, thank you. It's been a really graceful month for me.” answered Draco, giving an appreciative grin at the man's attractiveness.
He felt much better already.
Draco’s laughs was immediately died down as Harry dives down to have his own way on his boyfriend.
“Oh, sweet Merlin!” He gasped in shock as he peered down at his sons carefully. “Your dad was not Harry Potter, was he?”
“Honestly, Al. You're going to kill someone one day.” Scorpius rolled his eyes. “What he meant by that was because papa doesn't even know who our dad is!”
“You have no right to demand any of that, Malfoy.” said Ron, stepping up as he sent Malfoy a menacing look.
"He doesn't seem asleep to me."
Scorpius rolled his eyes at his brother's idiocy. “Headmistress McGonagall herself did the magical signature test on us. She tested it twice, and of course we matched.”
"I'm going to do this briefly. Not that you're awake or anything but- shh! Stop rambling, moron!"
“No, I guess not.” Scorpius grinned.
“And you're an attractive man yourself.”
He repressed a smile the second Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance, and decided to slowly step away from the two younger adults who were not aware of his existence at the moment. He shook his head when they continued to bicker; Draco hissing angrily whilst his younger self seemingly tried to find reasons between their arguments.
He bit his lips, thinking that perhaps including Draco in their plan was not a good idea after all. But, even if Harry's feelings were reciprocated somehow, Leo doesn't have to be worried because Draco will always do anything for him, he always has. That includes Harry, right?
Harry shook his head as he appraised the black haired boy. Honestly, that kid was such a baby when it came to his father but like an angry little cat when dealing with other people. Scorpius was much more behaved, polite but Harry knew he would not hesitate to do anything for his family, judging from the way he acted around Albus and Malfoy. Hell, he even found a way to cure his father!
Malfoy frowned in annoyance, though there was some pink dust appearing on his cheeks. “I'll tell you once I meet him later in the future.”
“Malfoy.” Harry warns heavily, as he lets out a small dose of his magic to fills the room.
"Have a, uh, good recovery."
The moment his eyes fell into his bedside table and saw the box of chocolates that was left by Malfoy however, shattered his thoughts altogether. With dim light illuminated the room, Harry reached out the box with heart dropped down to his stomach as he recalled the reason Malfoy was here earlier. He opened the box to see a week worth of heart shaped chocolates was neatly arranged.
Never once Draco got attacked with kisses that fast in his life. He laughed when the twins kiss him wherever they can reach, complete with a smooching sound. He replied by giving them kisses back.
"How did they do all of this?" asked Ron, mouth agape as he took a seat and claimed a present. Seamus, Dean and Neville followed his actions with delighted faces.
Potter shook his head vigorously, panic written in his eyes. “Not like that! I just, I just like having you around.” He said lamely.
“Merlin, you're helpless. I can't believe I was such- You don't have to be worried, Harry.” Henry sighed, exasperated. “Draco’s in a good hand. Aren't you, Draco?”
Ron lets out a snort. “What she meant was you always looked like someone snogged you good.”
“Yes!” Albus rolled his eyes, “Proceed!”
"Male pregnancy is indeed rare in the Wizarding World, some will cause certain complexity to the carrier. The curse should have made a great impact on his pregnancy." explained McGonagall.
Harry gasped, eyes wide with excitement as he dropped his eyes back to the box of chocolates. It's time for him to make the move now, as Malfoy already made his.
Scorpius sighed but agreed, It was their father after all. Now that the excitement has decreased, he can feel hundreds of eyes from all directions were onto them. He quickly grabbed Albus’ robe and they scrambled up to their feet.
Harry frowned, “What should I do then?”
"Good show, Potter." said Zabini, eyes full with mirth and followed his friend's path. Nott and Goyle were steps behind, nodding at Harry with approval that made him grinned stupidly.
He frowned at that.
“I'm just giving you space, Potter.”
Harry nodded, "Take care."
He was quite proud of himself.
“My body?”
The man drew a fond smile when his gaze fell on Malfoy, making the white-blond haired flushed attractively. Harry bit the inside of his cheek.
“Can we please settle down for a moment?” Malfoy loudly interrupted, stepping away from Harry as he went to pick his robes and covered half naked body. “Honestly, both of you, stop acting like children!”
He gaped.
Really nice.
“Of course, papa!” They chorused, and Draco softly shushed them down when Madam Pince shot them a look.
“His father was in an important meeting, and that witch was his babysitter but as you can see, he doesn't do well with her.”
“Dad took this for us!” said Albus, and Scorpius nodded, “Dad loves to take our picture, there's so many of them at home!”
"That was from Draco. This one is to ensure that you can live a good life." said Henry seriously.
His day goes by like that, and when he was done with dinner, he couldn't help but feel like there was something missing. It was not until he was settled down his bed, propped his blanket up to his chest and ready to go to sleep when the thought has finally dawn into him with a realisation; he sat up in an instant as he bore his eyes at Dean, who's hands occupied with a chocolate as he unwrapped them happily without a care in the world and pop them in his mouth, humming in contentment.
Not that he ever wondered what that ‘good valid reason’ is.
“Hello, Professor. It's nice to see you again.”
Draco snapped his eyes to the entrance when his detector chimed, just in time to see his next target of assignment walked through the door confidently, and he appeared to be accompanied by two of his friends.
"Yes, because I want you." answered Harry easily.
“I am, and that's just a sweet talk, Sweetheart.”
“Not if we're trying to save the love of his life.” Albus countered.
“-and I just wanted to see if you were unharmed, you know, just wondering if you were doing okay.”
“Listen, Henry. I don't care if you were his husband or not, you won't be touching Malfoy whatever you want. I won't let you.”
"It's fine." Malfoy flushed suddenly, clearing his throat. "Are you feeling better now?"
“You could just go with him, you know.”
"I'm sorry." Henry took a desperate breath, wiping away the tears formed around his eyes. "Oh dear, I understand why Draco used to hate you so much. Godric! It was so bad to hear it from someone else, now I have to see it myself!"
"I'm sorry," said Malfoy, after he calmed down and Harry just had to roll his eyes because his tone clearly indicated that he was not sorry at all; in fact, the white-blond haired git's eyes were dancing with mirth. "I think I've misheard, you want me to be- what?"
“Might as well,” Potter shrugged. “Seeing all of our friends are rather occupied now.”
As if those words were magical, Draco took a deep breath as he nodded again before he slowly peeled his clothes off one by one. He rested his eyes to the wall, occasionally locked them with Henry who simply gave him a reassuring smile, picking up Draco’s scattered clothes and folding them nicely before he put them aside.
"I thought we were friends, mate!"
“It was that bad?” asked Harry, when none seemed to have the ability to speak.
All of them wore a pinched look, and Draco took a glance at his twins who were sleeping soundly. “They didn't deserve this.” He whispered softly.
Naturally, his eyes moved across the table to sought for a particular white-blond head sitting by the end of the table with his friends, sharing looks with one another while mysterious smiles decorating their faces. He hadn't seen the other male since the last time he saw him, and it was good to see he actually doing well and looked healthy. Harry noted that Malfoy has styled his hair similar to sixth year, where he has let his hair free from those slick hair gel. Harry decided he liked the look on him.
"So, he went back to his dorm?"
"Consider me as a part of the team, then." said Malfoy, crossing his arms as he looked down to Harry. "I'd rather me to be your boyfriend, than Leo. Merlin knows what you'll do to him if I let it happen."
"Yes, Chosen One." declared Draco and Ginny in unison, falling into a fit of laugh when Harry groaned in exasperation.
” Malfoy parroted in annoyance and growled. “I swear to Merlin I'll never make your life easy if you're the reason I failed this class.”
“Anyway!” Henry cut brightly, “I assumed that there's a plan already?” He looked at them, searching for their faces and stopped at Malfoy. He mischievously made his way to him, the twins giggled but stayed on their spot to give their dad and papa some space. The rest of them move to gather around Harry. Ginny had her hand locked with Parkinson, faces filled with excitement to see the interaction.
“I don't think so?” He answered then, but Potter rolled his eyes and waved him to get closer. Draco frowned and sent Granger a questioning look but the bushy haired woman just shrugged, gesturing him to go to Potter.
Draco grimaced, the two can be a nuisance sometimes. He took a seat when Granger patted the empty one next to her, narrowing his eyes to the faces in front of him when they gave him this look, like they knew something he didn't.
“You see, papa,” Scorpius began and Draco immediately braced himself. “Harry Potter owned an Invisibility Cloak, and knowing da- er him, all we have to do is to include him into our plan.”
“Come on, papa! Harry Potter was not the only wizard with these genetic traits! Isn't it Scorp?” said the black haired boy, nudging his brother on his side.
"I need to look for something," said their younger dad, as he started to peek around his bed.
Draco laughed, “And I hate to spoil your surprise.” he said, putting a dramatic hand to his chest. “It won't be fun if I meet your dad at this time, don't you think?”
This is it, isn't it?
“Malfoy?”
He tried to smile up at her despite feeling as if someone just ripped his heart away. It felt hurt, right there. Draco placed his hand to his heart, trying to ease them down as his other hand reached out the wall to balance himself before his leg giving him out. He saw from his peripheral view as Granger blinked her eyes, wiping the corner of her eyes.
Scorpius tugged at Harry's hand, asking for permission as Albus already on his dad's tail. Harry fondly smiled at the small boy, nodding to him to follow his dad. Scorpius grinned and raced off to his twin and dad.
Merlin, that would be embarrassing.
After a few arguments, and another few arguments about Harry's Invisibility Cloak when Malfoy explained his intention, after Scorpius defended his father saying that he was a huge fan of Harry Potter-
"Pardon," said Draco, carefully. A little bit hysterical that his son suddenly dropped the Saviour's name into their discussion. "You were saying we need to get help from Harry Potter?"
Harry bemusedly followed their eyesight to see Draco Malfoy strode down the Great Hall together with his friends approaching the Slytherin’s table. Before he can even comprehend the situation, the sound of fallen chairs caught his ears and he watched in bewilderment as the two boys runs with all their might towards the Malfoy’s heir and knocked him down the floor with an identical shouts of,
"Potter, you can let go of me now." said Malfoy all of a sudden, stiffly and awkwardly it made Harry decide to tease him.
The first few weeks in, dared Harry said that it was just what he had pictured in his head before he came to Hogwarts. The students came to Hogwarts with the same vision of starting a new chapter of life and Harry was thankful for that even though sometimes there will be students who had gawked at him as if he was Merlin himself, some have even dared to be forward by taking a chance to touch him and some were shy enough to give him a grateful smile- he appreciated those the most. Even so, The atmosphere of Hogwarts was gloomy, dark and dreaded with what happened during the War that it has taken a toll on the students which made Hogwarts practically dead.
“Dad?” He heard his voice cracked.
Ron grumbled as they promptly moved to form a small circle. Even Hermione quickly took her place next to Ron- Ginny on his other side. Surprisingly, the twins decided to sit on either Harry's side. He gave them a questioning look and they sheepishly smiled at him.
“We're so glad to see you alive!” Scorpius sobbed into the fabric, clutching to his father tightly.
Her stares were full of distrust, perhaps it's because he's Draco Malfoy - former Death Eater - but he kept his smile steady.
“Ouch,” Draco covered a hand to his heart, faking a devastated look with a tiny drop of his disappointment slipped on his face before he smoothed them out with a teasing smile. “Then I'll just have to keep trying.”
“Yes.” They chorused in a heartbeat.
"Of course, Harry sleeps like a dead log. He won't notice!"
But who he was kidding, if anything, he was looking at Malfoy because-
Is this Potter's way of telling him that he's actually single and not married?
Harry had to agree. The two boys were practically skipping through their steps, as they followed McGonagall proceeding towards the High Table. The boys took their seats when McGonagall conjured a high chair for the both of them and Harry had to admit that the sight was pretty adorable.
He ignored the looks they received from the other occupants of the library. They've become the students' eyes feast ever since they arrived, watching their interaction with curiosity. Some of them would waved and smiled when Albus or Scorpius caught their eyes and some would send Draco a careful smile and curious look when he just happened to look up. It was rather a bizarre experience to say the least. He was a mean Death Eater before all of this, and now he was suddenly harmless as a sleeping Pygmy Puff.
"Then I suggest you learn how to cope."
His voice sound as if he was in pain, and longing at the same time that somehow it hurts Draco when Henry bowed down to hide his face. Draco bit his lips, bending down to carefully cradled the older man's face and tilted his head up to face him.
“They work together in the future?” asked Harry curiously and they nodded, “Close friend, even. They work in the same department.”
"Harry, we found him."
That sneaky git.
“Because papa’s blood from the past is special!” Scorpius chimed in.
Harry, on the other hand, let his eyes rested on his fidgeting little husband, soaking the view of how beautiful his little husband looked as flushes of pink decorated his face. He was aware that Draco was feeling self conscious, awkward and embarrassed at the same time. He knew that Draco doesn't know what to do around him, and he knew that above everything, Draco was still overwhelmed by the information of his life in the future; having a husband, twins and an unfortunate case of an old curse.
"See, feels nice, right?"
“I'm good.” He croaked pathetically, replacing Granger’s hand with his own as he quickly cleaned up his face.
He noticed that the Slytherin managed to avoid any of the returning Gryffindors, and if he suddenly decided to come and see Harry, it must be important then.
Heart skyrocketing, he barely aware of the wide smile carved upon his face as he breathlessly greeted the the white-blond haired Slytherin.
“Sure, come here.”
“He- Hello.” greeted Malfoy back, tongue tied - he fucking tongue tied and Harry had never saw him getting tongue tied because of a stranger before.
“It does count.” said Grangers, giving Weasley an impressive look before she sagged, “But that just one. We need two more.”
“The love of our life.” said Scorpius, eyes flared with determination and Albus grinned.
Granger sighed, “You're a great guy, Draco, and it's a dangerous game you're playing. It's better to stop now before you get hurt.”
"How did you know about that?" frowned Draco.
“You're not mad at me, are you, Sweetheart?”
“I'm sorry, all of you looked funny!”
Harry pressed a hand on his chest, flustered to realise that he was really grateful to know that Malfoy was going to be alright. It was as if a huge boulder was lifted from the depths of his heart, and now he felt at ease.
“You even let Hermione send me those treacle tarts!” Potter huffed, annoyed.
His stomach churned uncomfortably as he took in the sight in front of him, and he slowly pulled the chair next to the bed and sat, just to stare at the figure who was sleeping peacefully.
He had taken his twins to have their breakfast near the Black Lake, and somehow Pansy and Blaise came and joined them with a handful of food in their hands. Not even ten minutes after that, they were joined by the four Gryffindors; Granger and She Weasley’s hands were full with stacks of books while Potter and Weasley brought the food.
"He's doing well, Potter. Madam Promfey made him stay for another night so he'll be back by tomorrow." Parkinson winked, much like the way Seamus did back in their room.
Granger cleared her throat, “The war's over, Malfoy.”
Draco sighed, “Yes, apparently the twins did find the cure, using the old way to reverse the curse by making the victims drink a potion brewed with their own pure blood.”
"Uh, good morning?"
“Do you want me to?”
Well, actually, that would be exactly what would happen if Headmistress McGonagall hadn't approached them with a stern look on her face, though there was a slight tug on her lips when she deducted House points from each of them for displaying inappropriate acts in front teachers and peers and thus, they were sent straight for detention.
“Draco!” greeted Potter enthusiastically, somehow looking too relieved as he gave him a million watts smile that makes Draco almost blind with its brightness.
“Precisely.” Henry smiled.
"Harry!!"
- that led into another argument because apparently Malfoy was always up to no good just like his name-
It was said with a finality, as if Malfoy had no right to decline the request. Pressing his lips into a thin line, Harry sent an exasperated glare towards Hermione who had her chin upwards as she gave Malfoy a challenging look, but the Slytherin male only raised his brows in amusement.
"Right," sniffed Albus, "Let's just hope dad will do as planned."
Feeling excited, they threw compliments to their father but when his face turned hysterical the further they spoke, Scorpius quickly acted and put his palm to Albus’ mouth in order to shut him. Merlin knows how much a chatterbox Albus was when he got excited. He gave Albus a look when his brother questioned his actions.
“But you said you're in love with me.”
“Can't we?” asked Albus, peering to Harry with wide innocent eyes, which instantly copied by Scorpius.
“If you're worried that I might taint your blood, you don't have to worry.” Henry grinned, before he wiggled his eyebrows. “Even though it tempts me so much.”
"Do you want one, mate?" Seamus called, immediately turning to his nightstand and grabbed a small box as he presented them to Harry. "I got them from Pansy."
"H-hey, where do you want to take him?" cried Harry, "He's mine. Give him back!"
Merlin, indeed.
"As if," huffed Draco, though he started to scoot closer to Harry. "Well, since you're so desperate for it." he moved to carefully place his head on Harry's chest, tucking his head under his chin and put a hand on top of his stomach. Harry responded by wrapping his arm around his little husband's shoulder, bringing their bodies close together.
Harry answered with a laugh as he bent down to Draco’s awaiting lips. Smiles drawn on their faces as they exchange their kisses on a bright beautiful Sunday morning.
"Thank you for visiting me, and uhm, spending the night, I suppose." Malfoy timidly smiled, giving Harry a small wave.
He couldn't help but recall the letter he received a few months after the war just ended. It was a few weeks after Malfoy's trial, and whilst his father was found guilty and was sent to Azkaban, Malfoy and his mother were pardoned for their act of assisting Harry and the Light side to win the war - courtesy of Harry's testimony - and were given probation of house arrest for two years, and attending Hogwarts for Malfoy. The white-blond haired man has written him his apologies for his action towards him as well as expressing his appreciation for Harry's act of kindness. Harry knew he had written for everyone who had suffered from his wrongdoing throughout the war too, especially those who had been taken to the Manor as prisoners.
There was nothing that can compare to what Scorpius felt when he saw his father walk down the Great Hall looking handsome as he ever; alive, and most importantly his father looked much healthier than the last time Scorpius saw him.
Draco can't take it anymore.
“Seriously, Draco. I'm not going to do anything to you. There was a reason why I sent our boys to stay with your friends.” explained Henry, carefully placing a hand on Draco’s arm.
"Why, are you jealous?" Harry can't help but ask in a cheeky manner.
Draco’s eyes slightly widened hearing the voice. He recognised that voice anywhere. He blinked quickly, gathering his wits as he turned to see Potter watching him warily.
Draco felt the air sucked out of his lungs as soon as he took a look. It was a photo; he was in it. It was definitely him and he looked much older but happier. Both Albus and Scorpius wrapped tightly in his arms, giggling as he pressed kisses onto their faces.
"Who was he?" asked Hermione, eyes sparkled with interest, mirrored by Ron.
- which led to Albus angrily stomped over to Ron and shouted,
He understood now why he was given this particular assignment on a short notice, and why it was a compulsory assignment that must be executed as soon as possible; these two were a Perfect Match. It was rare for two individuals to become a Perfect Match considering that they needed to be matched above ninety percent, and these two individuals managed to exceed the expectation with the percentages over ninety-eight.
Harry tilted his head, perplexed. “What do yo-"
McGonagall only received a twin of sheepish smiles, that she was pretty sure belonged to Harry Potter. “May I know why the both of you decided to act on your own without getting the help of the adults?”
"No! No, please!" cried Harry, hopelessly holding onto his lover, burying his face into his hair. "Please, please I can save you, I can save you!"
Both of them sat next to each other at the park a couple of blocks away from his apartment. It was a beautiful day for a Sunday morning when Potter unexpectedly showed up in front of his door, ready with a basket of foods and a blinding smile. “I hope you like an outdoor breakfast!” He had said.
"Scorpius, as in the constellation?"
“Wizard.” He corrected it. “He's a wizard and one of a hell brilliant kisser.”
Harry caught Draco’s questioning face and he shrugged as an answer. They both turned when the sight of the small group near the Slytherin table had stopped, placing the boxes on the floor as they raised their wands towards it. When they casted a spell, the content in the boxes jumped out, flew over the Slytherin students and wrapped itself around every student of the Slytherin. Harry watched with fascination to Draco when the white-blond haired male gape as he lifted the sudden present; a knitted scarf. He turned to Harry and blinked, resulting in a laugh from Harry. More so when the other houses suddenly yelled in a rather practiced tempo of; "Happy Christmas!"
Draco blinks.
He abruptly stands up - sending his chair toppled to the floor - and round up his desk as he walks purposely straight out of his office.
“Sweet, food!” exclaimed Albus, who moved in an instant towards them followed by Scorpius and took his spot next to Ginny whilst Scorpius sat next to Harry.
"Very well, then." said Harry, "Go on before I change my mind and lock you in."
There’s a moment of silence before Henry burst out laughing, bending down as he clutched on his stomach. Harry shared a look with Malfoy, both don't know what to comprehend of what to do with the older man.
He took a deep breath as he opened his eyes, and looked down to see identical concerned faces.
Draco hummed playfully, drawing a pattern on the man's chest. “Well, he was an attractive man.”
"Loo!" answered Albus. "What happened, do you need anything?"
Albus whooped and Scorpius dropped his jaw in disbelief, “That's it? You just put your trust in us that easily?”
At that, the twins perk up. Draco watched as the twins' eyes brightened and they shared a quick smile.
“I- I guess if you insist,” Harry swallowed, defenses crumbled down at the sight of the twins.
Potter looked up with an unreadable face. Draco decided not to interpret what it means. “I'm letting you go!” He announced, forcing out a smile.
Three small packages suddenly tossed to each of them and Harry smiled as he received his regular heart shaped chocolate and immediately sunk his teeth in it once he unwrapped it, humming in content as the delicious taste burst in his mouth.
“Your kiss.” Potter repeated, simple and straight towards Draco’s increasing heart beat.
Everywhere he went, there would be clusters of Slytherin down from the first years up to seventh, they would surround him, eating up whatever Malfoy said with eagerness that poked annoyance out of Harry for taking the blond's attention away from him. Of course, his friends were with him the whole time and Harry had noticed how Malfoy was back on his track becoming the Slytherin Prince, though this time it was actually looked like he was leading them into light, proven when there was change in Slytherins' attitude towards other houses.
"Because I realised that I have taken more than I should, more than I deserve."
“Surprisingly, yes.” Harry shrugged.
“Oh, yes!” Draco nods, canceling the charms he put on James and moves closer to Potter who gently peel his son off Draco.
The twins nodded in a perfect synchronisation that got Draco to screamed mentally seeing the confident look upon their faces, proud that they managed to distribute an excellent idea. Draco doesn't think it was an excellent idea, far from it even but not like he can say it out loud in front of his twins. That would be the same as kicking a crup.
“No, I'm fine.” said Malfoy, “Really.” He emphasized when Harry sent him a doubt look. “He didn't do anything to me, it was an accident.”
Hermione and Leo send him a look and he sighed again. "Because you're- you're the only person who can do this."
All of them turned to see Headmistress McGonagall has reached their small group with a stern look on her face.
“You look stupid, Potter.” stated Draco.
Malfoy casted his eyes down at that, and Harry had to tilted his head up just to have those grey eyes back on him.
"Ah, yes." grinned Hermione. "Ginny had mentioned a certain heart shaped chocolates brought by Parkinson when she went to visit Malfoy, said his parcel has arrived. Malfoy got flustered, and that was when she hit Parkinson with Disillusionment Charm. It doesn't take a second for us to connect the dots."
They held their gaze on each other for a moment, and it was Draco who averted his eyes first, dragging them to James who continued to sleep soundly in his father's arm. He can't help but give soft chuckles. “He's a beautiful child.”
“No way!” Weasley suddenly exclaimed out loud, snapping Draco from their staring contest. He threw his gaze at the ginger git, who was also looking at him now. Everyone is apparently looking at him as if he was some kind of a new specimen. Pansy and Blaise however, looked rather amused.
Draco stopped, and stared at Henry. Blush when he realised he was feeling much better than before - less tense, less anxious. Not that he is going to give Henry the satisfaction.
He swallowed down the heavy feeling on his chest, drawing a tight smile. “Then it is time for me to stop.”
“No!” The twins exclaimed in horror.
The moment Draco saw his golden sparks of magic turned pink, he heaved a satisfied sigh. He watched as Ginevra shyly invited Harry to sit together, watched as they started to speak to one another, their companions also decided to merge together and Draco let them be. His magic was working on its own and he only needed them to be interested deeply enough to give each other a kiss because that was when Draco needed to shoot them with the arrow.
Indeed, he was.
"I am sure, Potter." Malfoy gave him a look. "Merlin, you're such a mother hen."
"Harry, I've never seen you getting worked up on something since War." began Hermione, soft smile playing on her lips. "You were much happier ever since the kisses happened. We were worried that Malfoy being the mysterious kisser would break you down but I guess we should have known better."
“Well, if you must be asking. It's been going on well, so far. He's looking much more attractive these days, and more fit than before. I assumed he's been going to the gym.”
“Mr. Malfoy.”
"Both of you will take care of each other." stated Harry, "I want you two to come back safely as soon as the mission is complete."
She braced herself and took a deep breath and closed her eyes when things around the room started to rattles and felt the sudden energy of a powerful magic burst throughout the space, just enough to make her grip on her table tightly.
He startled when Harry suddenly laughed, tensed when the man dropped his head on his shoulder, burying his face into his neck. He squeaked embarrassingly when he felt hot lips brushing his skin before his eyes met with a pair of green eyes full with mirth.
"I will," promised Draco. "The front gate of the Palace will open on its own once the last Horcrux is destroyed. I will see you there."
Harry answered him with a pointed look.
“I'm Scorpius, nice to meet you.” said the boy politely.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, "As I was saying, no picking fight from the both of you."
Henry stared at him blankly, eyes turned glassy before he gave a dejected chuckle, and whispered, “I know.”
Not that he stalked them or anything.
Harry wondered if they felt as soft as it looked, like those kisses he has been receiving.
"No, professor. I-"
“But you believe that we're Harry Potter's sons?” asked Scorpius, feeling a little bit hysterical that they were just granted help from McGonagall herself.
"Do you want to be with me?" asked Harry then, locking his eyes the troubled pair of grey eyes with determination. "because I do, Draco, I really do."
He patted Pansy’s bum off his lap and she complied, pulling Blaise to stand with her. Draco shook his head when his two friends started to walk towards the exit, bidding Granger and Weasley a loud goodbye. He turned to Potter when the two disappeared to the exit, leaning forward to give the man a soft kiss on his cheek.
They simultaneously sat back on their father's lap, and gave him their best smile hoping that they didn't push him too far. Their father hitched a breath with widened eyes, perhaps surprised by their movement.
“Salazar.” said Draco shakily, struggling for air.
“Right,” said Albus, and gave their father a sheepish grin. “Sorry papa.”
"Well I guess it's not our problem, anymore?" said Albus, unsure as he watched their younger dad's dot was already halfway towards the room where their older dad and papa were. "Merlin, it's giving me a headache."
“Thank you, Malfoy.” Potter says and Draco looks up to meet his sincere gaze. He returned them with a small smile. “My pleasure, Potter.”
“Because we're just a distraction so let the brains one do the work and we wait.” A voice said, and Harry looked up to Ginny who was giving him a look, both hands were full with plates of food so Harry quickly took the loads from her and placed it down on the floor.
“And I'm sorry, for my outburst.” He said to the others then.
"Don't make me hex you, Potter."
“Ah.” Harry suddenly felt exposed, when two pairs of eyes locked onto him. Godric, what would Malfoy say if he told him that Harry got worried over him? It's not like he can freely say; “Oh, it's nothing. It's just, I kind of worried that Henry would do things to you, so I went to look for my Marauder’s Map- you know, so I can watch over you but it seemed that I lost that bloody piece of parchment, and I'm dying to know if you're okay so that's why I'm here.”
Draco groaned as he tried to get Potter's attention, but Potter doesn't seem to notice as he kept on talking with Ginevra, tucking the strands of her hair behind her ears gently. They shared soft smiles when their eyes met and Draco just can see the sparks between them. He quietly gasped at the sight, feeling as if someone gutted his stomach. He felt numb all of a sudden, weak to do anything else and let Granger lead him away.
"You'll see." chorused his friends in unison.
“Henry looks familiar, don't you think?”
He caresses the small nest of a black hair, quite sure with himself that the baby has fallen asleep. “You poor little thing, cried yourself to sleep, aren't you?”
They nodded at that, and Harry can't help but stole a glance at Malfoy. The way he concentrated on his task, exchanging words with Hermione. He really did work hard for his twins and promptly reminded that Malfoy was the type of person who would do anything for his family.
“Dean and I arrived when the Slytherins were in the middle of handing out these chocolates around the table.” Seamus grinned, bumping his shoulder to Dean who nodded. “Asked one of them but they were too secretive about it apparently. Just told me to enjoy the chocolate, one for each student.”
“You- someone really has been snogging you?!” asked Ron when he snapped out of his stupor.
“Looking good today, Potter.” greeted Draco, handing out the small box of treacle tart to the man who received it with gleaming eyes.
“So,” Weasley spoke when silence filled the room. “I think we do have one so far.”
"And if we broke the rule?" asked Harry, looking past Malfoy to observe the older man who got his eyes pinned on him in a challenging manner. He narrowed his eyes at the man, annoyed.
"I'm talking from experience, you brat." said Henry, gritting his teeth. "Remember, the key to a happy marriage is-"
It drew a snort from Scorpius, shaking his head at his brother's logic. "You're an idiot."
“You think you're falling in love with me?” asked Draco, who doesn't quite believe his ears. Did Potter just say that he thinks he's falling in love with Draco?
Draco couldn't help but smirked approvingly. He has been keeping his eyes on her from the moment she stepped into the place; her personal information has already imprinted behind his eyelids as he has finished reading her profile just before he entered the place half an hour before her and just by watching her, Draco had the feeling that this would be an interesting assignment.
Frustrated; he has decided to put on a desperate measure. He waited in the hidden alcove near the Slytherin's lair, just a few feet before the stairs down the dungeon with his Cloak draped on his body. He knew Malfoy would always take his time getting done before he started his day and he would always be the last one to leave the dungeon, whilst his friends would wait for him in the Great Hall for breakfast. He knew Malfoy would not function properly without his morning tea and Harry had a higher risk of getting hexed to the next decade but he would take what he needed to take.
“Did you guys see that?” Harry pointed to the boys, ignoring the look on her face. “One of them just looks at me- dead in the eyes- like he's challenging me!”
"Alright. Potter- Harry, I am deeply ashamed for taking an advantage over you and from now on, I am going to stop. I've taken more than I probably should, and you of all people did not deserve to be treated as such. Especially from a person like me."
Harry raised his brows, giving the older man a look. "What, by listening to everything Draco said?"
“Hello, you must be Draco Malfoy.”
“Right.” He said, “As you know, I'm a bit busy during the war and I don't think no one wants to get on with a Death Eater, so.” He lifted a shoulder at them.
Hermione sharply threw her wild gaze at Harry and frowned, lips pursed together but nodded slowly, “Yes.”
Draco tries to whisper loving words to the infant but to no avail, he won't stop his cries.
“This is the tenth time this week that you managed to be involved in a fight. Do you have any excuses for yourself?” Harry asks. He draws a disapproving frown on his face and twist his lips in disappointed manner.
Granger twisted her lips in disapproval. “I just don't want to see you get hurt.”
“Five little ducks went out one day, over the hill and far away.” He gently moves the baby in rocking motion, rubbing his back and continues to sing. “Mother duck said quack, quack, quack, quack. But only four little ducks came back.”
“Draco,” He heard Pansy called, he looked up to her. “Future husband.” She stage whispered and Draco couldn't help but to curl his lips in amusement. Trust Pansy to make him feel better.
"But, why seven years after he gave birth?"
“Ah.” Henry grinned, full of amusement that got Draco narrowed his eyes warily. “You can leave those on. You might lose your virginity sooner if you take it off.”
"Sorry, wrong rule." Henry coughed, though there was amusement twinkled in his eyes.
"How- how did you-" tried Malfoy breathlessly, couldn't even finish his sentence as he made a sound behind his throat, and stared at Harry unblinking.
Several heads turn from Neville to him, and Harry instantly recall the meeting they were having before Neville bursts the door open - rather dramatically in Harry's opinion.
“Hey, it's you again!”
Harry decided he doesn't like the way those pale brows knotted in disapproval, so he dragged his eyes southward to sought for the pink lips which currently pressed in a thin line.
"What kind of bullshit are you talking about?" asked Harry, felt the situation was rather ridiculous. Malfoy shouldn't have acted this way.
“Dad's going to kill us both,” said Scorpius.
Harry scoffed, "I thought rule number one was not picking a fight?"
“We apologize for our rudeness, papa.” said Scorpius, trying to appear polite. “Let us help you.” He nudged Albus’ side as he grabbed one of their father's hands so his brother could grasp the other. With the help of uncle Blaise and aunt Pansy, they pulled their father up to his feet.
“Nonsense!” said Henry, and he had the audacity to smirk at Harry before he turned to Malfoy. “I need you to stay with me tonight.”
“Not really.” said Potter, “but if we can count their clothes as future things, then I guess we only need to find another one.”
“I don't think you're that bad looking.” said She Weasley suddenly. “I mean, I saw some of the students practically drooled over you despite being a Death Eater.”
“Exactly.” Draco smugly lifted his chin up.
"Don't be an imbecile, Potter." Malfoy rolled his eyes, "He's a sweetheart, and you know it."
After what seemed like half an hour waiting, Harry finally saw the top of Malfoy's white-blond head emerging from the stairs, and delighted to note that the male was alone. Harry grinned, feeling mischief when he saw Malfoy walked forward casually, not knowing what awaits him. By the time Malfoy was about four steps away to where he was hiding, Harry braced himself.
He opened his mouth to say something - anything just for the sake of his dignity but nothing has came out which got him opening and closing his mouth like a retarded fish. Eventually, he settled with: “I didn't look too silly, am I?”
Foods forgotten, Harry put his attention towards the boys who were helping themselves with food, while his friends resumed their activities.
Draco had snorted, and Harry tilted his head up knowing the effect of his words and was not disappointed when he saw the pinky dust bloomed on his face.
Draco snapped his fingers at her, appraising her with bright eyes. “Precisely! What a clever woman you are.”
Draco grinned and ran back towards awaiting Granger, who was tapping her foot impatiently and quickly led her out of the cafeteria. Granger shook her head at him, as they walked around the corner to their classroom, “If Harry's into bollocks, the both of you surely are in a loving relationship by now.”
Parkinson and Ginny shared an excited grin and they quickly ran towards the older man, and Hermione cleared her throat. “I need to speak with Henry, for research purposes.” She said, hurriedly following the two girls’ steps.
“Very well,” he continued, and took a deep breath to calm himself, “Alright, three past possessions of the intended. Papa’s robe?”
For now, let's give his culprit the upper hand.
His children.
Harry blinked.
"We need you to be Harry's boyfriend."
"I- I already- use all my power to- so- so I can say, say my farewell to you," whispered Draco, eyes wet with tears, bloodied lips stretch into a small smile. "I, I love you, with all my heart."
"I'm going!" Ron groaned, taking his things with sleep still clouding his mind that got him to stumble into his bed post, cursing loudly all the way to the bathroom.
“Dad, stop flirting with papa.” called Albus, rolling his eyes. Scorpius turned to give Harry a pointed look, “See what we have to suffer everyday?”
"We can use the Invisibility Cloak to sneak into the library!" said Albus, eyes shone with his own idea.
"Farewell, my love."
Harry blinked, processing the information. "So, you're saying that my sons have been providing Draco with their magic?"
“Merlin, Harry. All I want is for this bloke to come out and stop snogging you silly in open places like that.” said Ron, making Hermione burst out laughing and Harry can't help but grinned.
"Mate, why are up so early?" asked Ron groggily, rubbing his eyes.
Draco snorted at the ridiculous scene and turned to Potter to see him watching him closely. He blinked at him, “What?”
“As far as I know, Blood Curse can only be reversed by using the cursed one-” Hermione stopped midway and raised an eyebrow at Malfoy who's cheeks suddenly dusted with pink that made Harry wonder what Scorpius meant by special.
Draco burst out a laugh, and looked up adoringly to Harry's handsome face. “Okay, you got me there.”
"That's my bargain." grinned Harry. "Come on, these arms are made for you. Use it well."
"Well, what do you- oh stop that! stop looking at me like that!"
"Thank you," said Draco suddenly, and Harry turned to him. "Hm?"
Draco presses his lips together, unimpressed. "I'm aware.” He said in a monotone voice.
"Tough luck," nodded Seamus, before he leaned forward. "But I did know it was because they were planning something big, much bigger than those chocolates scheme they pulled."
“Nice to meet you too, Headmistress McGonagall.” replied Albus politely, a beat after his brother.
A Gryffindor, with black hair and green eyes.
Merlin, it was embarrassing enough to ask this insufferable git for help, but having those grey eyes lighten up when they landed on him was way beyond mortifying.
"Yes," supported Scorpius, "Well, hopefully not anyway." he said with a small frown, peeking to his brother. "It's dad, after all."
There's none.
He was only given a mischievous smile when he asked Seamus why he told Harry about it. As if he was certain that Harry would go and sought Malfoy himself.
“Well then, do you think we can continue?” Malfoy tilted his head in a questioning manner, and Henry nodded his head in an instant. "Of course! I'm sorry for earlier."
“Hello.” He cautiously greeted back, glancing around to see delighted faces looking at him. Even Pansy and Blaise were there. He raised an eyebrow at them. The two usually locked up in their own dungeon, hence why Draco always hangs out with Potter's gang.
“Besides,” Albus suddenly stood up, patting his pockets, “We have another proof!” He announced, pulling out a photo. “Here, you can see it yourself!”
"That's a weak bargain." frowned Draco.
Harry huffed, crossing his arms together and raised his brows. "What, that big plan of Slytherins?"
“But I do,” said Potter, as he moved closer to Draco and cupped his cheeks gently, “I do, and I'm sorry for being ignorant all this time but I need to be sure of my feelings too. You've been really wonderful to me, Draco, and I'm sorry for driving you away but it made me realise that I can't take you for granted. I can lose you anytime, and might not get you back if I continue being ignorant. I can't lose you.”
His future husband must be an angel; for accepting Draco into his life, loving and caring for him and the children. He can feel the love radiates from the twins every time they'd mentioned their Dad. Draco can't help but feel his hope for his future brightened.
“Who in the right mind wants to harm children?” Ron snorted, a beat after McGonagall has concluded her speech while eyeing the two boys. “I mean, despite the Slytherin’s robes, they were kind of adorable. Don't you think, Harry?”
“Wonderful! We'll be sharing a room then.” Henry grinned at Malfoy who spluttered, “Wo- Won’t that be inappropriate?”
Harry's insides decided to make a twist at the sight and he slightly frowned at the foreign feeling that poked his heart.
Draco put his hands on the man's sturdy chest, looking up at him. Searching for his eyes. “I can't believe you.” He whispered.
Rejection. Every time.
McGonagall smiled despite herself. “Come now, children. It's dinner time and I'm sure you're hungry.”
“Besides,” said Albus, stage whispering as he gave Draco a reassuring grin. “Dad was the most handsome person you've ever met! You said it yourself, papa!”
Henry shook his head, turning to give Harry a pointed look, “See what I had to suffer everyday?”
Honestly, he'd never imagine the turn of the event would lead to something like this. Before he knows it, a smile blooms upon his face and he quickly searches for his parchment to write a quick reply, rolls them neatly and ties them on the small owl’s leg before the bird gracefully flies away.
Sweet Salazar.
Draco sniffed heavily by the time Potter finished his confession, as fat tears were already running down his cheeks. He wiped them away with his sleeve. Oh, dear, was this really happening? His heart felt like they were about to burst out.
"I know it was really hard for you right now, but believe me when I said that you're going to make it in the future. You're the most stubborn head person I've ever met, and nothing's going to stop you from getting back on top of your feet no matter how deep you were dragged down. You're Draco Malfoy, the husband that I'm proud of, the husband that his children are willing to take their chance to travel back in time for him, the husband that I'm not willing to give up. You're going to make it no matter what."
Harry had laughed, amused by the situation and was gladly let Draco shut him by giving him the best snog in his life.
Draco’s heart clenched seeing Henry's devastated face. It must be hard for the older man to keep on a cheerful facade when his heart was torn open every second he was away from his husband.
Seamus stopped and nodded vigorously. “Sounds about right.”
Blaise smiled at him in a reassurance manner, “I hope you know that there was no way me and Pansy are still in that department.”
“I know!” She beamed. “I've heard so much about you!”
“How come the both of you got two then?” Ron, who already took a bite on his own chocolate frowned in, eyeing Seamus and Dean's extra packages in their hands.
He scoffed when they smugly smirked at him, and crossed his arms together in a sulky manner. He lifted his chin, pointedly stared at something far down the lawn to avoid his friends’ eyes as he muttered, “Someone has been snogging me for weeks now.”
"Thank Merlin you have two wonderful boys to bring you back on track," said McGonagall, proud smile on display. "I believe you need to stop thinking of the difficulties, and think more like a Gryffindor."
"He's damn right!" hollered Pansy at the back getting a rolled eyes from Malfoy, and Harry couldn't help but chuckled.
He watches in astonished as Dixon stumbles on his back and Malfoy quickly climbs onto his body, fisting harshly on his collar to continue throwing punches with his other hand.
“Well, you tell me then if you didn't feel the same.” said Ron instead, giving Zabini a challenging look.
His agony turned into confusion however, when his lover's body was surrounded with lights all of a sudden. He unconsciously tightened his grip when the lights turned brighter, particles of his lover's body suddenly turned into the lights itself, dissipating upwards into thin air.
“Proof?” asked Draco carefully.
He gave the man a smile- no matter what, he was still the apple to his eyes. “Potter, what can I help you with?”
"Right." said Harry as he stood up, looking out the window to see the dark sky was about to change its colour. He gathered his things, bundled them up together and turned to Malfoy, unsure what to say.
Apparently, he was not the only one who saw the smile because he could see the others sharing a look.
“Sorry, I didn't get your name.”
“Dad.” Scorpius sighed, and Albus shook his head.
Henry had the audacity to burst out laughing gleefully.
“Well?” Parkinson probed, handing out a napkin to the small boy and he received it with a small thank you. “Your papa was the kind of person who needed proof if you wanted him to believe in something. So, do you have any?”
"Harry," a soft voice called, and he felt a pair of warm hands cradle his face gently. "No matter what happened, I will come back to you, I promise."
“Yes, but you don't know if they may put something in it!”
"This is amazing." commented Harry, taking the surroundings. Though they used spells to pack the presents and wrap them, it didn't stop the students from working together whilst having fun at the same time. Stacks of presents that were done were piled in the corner, and Harry noted that they have done a literally good job at it.
Zabini laughed as Ron choked into his food, and Harry reached out quickly to pat his back.
"I didn't see any old parchment," commented Albus, far too relieved as he faked a worried look.
Potter stood on his knee immediately, facing Draco as he took a deep breath and looked at Draco dead in his eyes. He opened his mouth, but no words came out.
The twins literally dressed in the same way, as if they were a sole person until they reached fourth year when Malfoy suddenly cut his hair short; cropped at back, longer at the front, and decided to go for a more bad boy appearance which served their personality much better since despite being twins, their personality were the polar opposite.
And he didn't like it at all.
“What is it about this time?”
"You know how Potter is," he softly said. "He felt guilty for what he did to you."
A sudden pair of delighted laughs from the twins grabbed their attention. Albus had his hand on his stomach while Scorpius went to cover his mouth.
“Headmistress, are you saying that they're from,” He paused, and inhaled carefully as he breathed. “The future?”
For Harry, it was the best scene he had ever seen and he couldn't ask for more.
"Yes, well." said Malfoy, sounding slightly hysterical. "There was nothing Madam Promfey couldn't fix."
Malfoy gave him a wild look, wiping his lips in the process before he wailed his arms, gesturing nothing in particular. "I- You, we're not meant to be together!"
Potter stops right in front of him, standing awkwardly as he eyes the baby in Draco’s arms and scratches his head.
Perhaps, he needed to let go of Potter now.
Harry doesn't remember losing control, he doesn't remember unleashing his power as he charged towards Voldemort; having only one purpose in his mind and that was to kill the King of Demon Regime with his own hands. He doesn't remember getting wounded, he doesn't remember summoning his lover's sword, the black blade of Hawthorne as he used all his strength to breach into Voldemort's defenses. He doesn't remember succeeding to steal an opening, using the opportunity to swing the black blade towards the King's neck and cleanly separated the head from its body, he doesn't remember that he had managed to end the life of Voldemort, making him as the new King of the Demon Regime.
The twins give her appreciative smiles, “We've been wondering if one of you will ask that kind of question.” said Scorpius, taking a sip from his pumpkin juice.
They beamed at him.
“Because he was a Slytherin?” asked Harry incredulously. “I'm not that prejudiced.”
And here he thought he was going to marry some pureblood woman despite his sexuality. But instead, he married a man.
“Nevermind that,” He softly said, “You're here now and let's not waste your efforts.”
“No way a Gryffindor wanted to marry Malfoy.” scoffed Ron.
“I am.” Harry narrowed his eyes at him, “I am jealous.”
Draco felt his knees weaken.
Harry felt like he was watching a private moment when they started to stare at each other. He turned to look for Ron's eyes but his friend had his eyes on Henry with a little frown. He nudged Ron, and raised an eyebrow when his friend turned to him.
Screw Draco for having a straight man as his crush. Doesn't stop him from approaching though. Sometimes, you just have to try your luck.
"It's- It's fine."
The four of them turned as Seamus gave them a big smile while munching his chocolate.
They were identical; twins.
Then suddenly Harry felt the lips pull apart, hands leaving his face as one of them dropped to his shoulder and another pulling out a wand as a strong whisper of Protego was casted just in time Hermione’s own Finite hit the invisible shield and dissipated into thin air.
Draco final reason to stop his stupid crush on Harry Potter. He watched as adoration written crystal clear in Potter's eyes every time they landed on the red haired woman. Draco can't blame him, really. She was such a bright woman; beautiful skin- even her freckles looked pretty on her skin. She got gorgeous red hair, with bright brown eyes that matched perfectly with her perfect smile. It was as if the sun shines on her every time she walks by.
"Just feel like doing so." Harry grinned, grabbing a pillow from his bed and chuck it straight to Ron's head receiving a colourful curses from his friend. "Hurry up and get ready, I'm starving already."
He then said, smugly smirked at Albus. He received a blow at his side for that.
“Probably just visiting.” said Hermione.
"He's handsome isn't he, younger dad." commented Albus.
Draco snorted in an instant, slapping the man’s chest lightly. “I don't know, can you?”
He gives himself a few moments to collect himself before he walks back towards his office, blinking in confusion when his table was full of stack of papers. He reaches for one of them, raising his brows to see it was an article from the Prophet, an article of Potter to be exact. He turns his gaze on the rest of the papers, skimming them briefly to see it was all about Potter.
