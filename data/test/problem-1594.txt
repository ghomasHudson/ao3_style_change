Draco found himself speechless yet again.
Harry levered himself out of the bed and brandished his weapon.  "Drop your sword," he ordered.
"Excellent," Draco said with a cheeky grin. "Getting my hands on your vaults was my goal all along."
"I said I'm not hungry!" Draco snapped.
"I've no need to brag, Potter. Pounding your arse is reward enough for me."
"I have no need for the Ministry's Galleons," said Malfoy. "Perhaps you would be interested in bartering?"
"We can still have a big, social event if you like," he said quickly. "I just want you to be happy."
"Geroff!" he snarled, trying to push Malfoy off of himself while at the same time attempting to wriggle out from under him.
Malfoy's eyebrows disappeared beneath the edge of his hat--a fedora-shaped creation that appeared both warm and elegant. He opened his mouth, but Harry wasn't about to wait around to hear what emerged from Malfoy's rude gob. He gripped his grabber, turned his back on Malfoy, and stepped onto the road.
The silence stretched between them until Harry ventured to break it. "What would you like for breakfast?"
"I've been drinking copius amounts of tea," Draco explained. His words ended on a yawn.
Harry elbowed him sharply. "You are such a pain in the arse."
"Piss off," Harry bit out in response.
By the time Harry returned with Hermione in tow, Draco was in a right strop.
"Had I known you were this demanding, I wouldn't have married you."
"How am I supposed to do that?" asked Hagrid.
Draco pushed his hand away. "I'm feeling queer again."
Draco heard two quick cracks of Apparation. He walked out of the cottage and spat twice on the ground. Behind him, Potter chuckled.
Potter sidled closer and pressed against Draco, sharing the warmth of his fur.
"No, of course not," said Hermione. "I simply thought you would like to obtain some goods while on the mainland."
A new concern occurred to Harry. "What if our friends and families murder us?"
The other two hung their heads in shame, and Draco began to despair.  If they killed him, Snaperdinck would, indeed, want to avenge his death.
"But, that's just it," Harry interrupted. "If you injure that shoulder once more, you may never have full use of your arm afterward."
"As you wish," Harry answered.  It was all he ever said to Draco's outrageous demands.
Draco sat up and swept his hair away from his eyes. "I'm sorry, Harry. I didn't mean to fall asleep."
Harry raised his head to see Draco frowning up at him. "I am trying to draw out the moment."
"I don't play games, Malfoy."
"That wasn't our finest moment, I reckon," he said.
"I accept," said Snaperdinck.
"Bloody fucking hell, Malfoy!" Harry was half lying underneath his rival, hip and shoulder throbbing from where he'd made contact with the road again. As Malfoy floundered atop him, another part of Harry's body began to throb.
Harry grinned. "I dare say! We would not want to have compromised potency."
Malfoy himself stood there, familiar sneer twisting his lips and hair falling rakishly over his brow.
When they emerged from the marsh some time later, both of them blinked in the sunshine.  They celebrated with a lingering kiss.  After too many years apart, the press of their lips was sweet relief.  The whinny of a horse alerted Harry and Draco to further danger.
"Won't you have a seat?" Draco invited, gesturing to the table and benches. His mother nodded and took a seat. Draco sat across from her and asked Dobby to bring them some mead.
"Draco! Shame on you!"
"No," Harry replied. "Why don't you go relax, and I'll let you know when dinner is ready?"
Draco froze with his strong teeth still clamped into the witch's tail. He tasted blood, and he could only hope it was hers and not his.
Harry gulped. They were entering dangerous territory here, and he was tempted to scarper off in the direction the waitress had gone. Thinking of Draco's delicate condition helped firm Harry's resolve. He had to protect his unborn baby, even if it meant incurring Draco's legendary wrath. Still, an instinct for self-preservation prompted him to attempt deflection.
"Your trousers were too tight!" Harry accused without thinking. Immediately, he wished the words back. Now that Malfoy knew he'd been ogling his arse, Harry would never hear the end of it.
Harry sought to reassure him. "You don't need to make any life-changing decisions right now," he said. "I'll stabilize your shoulder and then call in one of the Medi-Surgeons."
"I'm not a witch, I'm your daughter," said the young woman.  She beamed at Ineville and Hagrid. "My name is Luna.  Please forgive my father, he's lost his confidence ever since the Half-Blood Prince sacked him."
By the time Draco returned, less than ten minutes later, Grimmauld Place looked like a war zone. Items were scattered across the floor, the cushions had been thrown from the sofa, straight chairs were upended, and his father was flitting about in a rage.
"No."
Draco rolled his head to the side to smile at Harry. "Sounds delightful," he replied. "You're far too kind. Is there something you need to tell me?"
Harry was not so foolish. "Okay, we won't ride the Eye." Over Draco's shoulder, he saw their waitress approaching with his club soda and Draco's cabernet. Harry turned his Death Glare on her, and she pivoted and headed back to the kitchen. He hated to scare the poor girl, but his baby came first.
As Snaperdinck and Rodolphus plotted Draco's demise and the war with Durmstrang, Draco himself swept into Snaperdinck's study.
Draco smirked at him. "No one will murder me," he stated. "I'm...I'm pregnant!"
"I can't breathe, you ponce," growled Harry.
"Nonsense.  You're only saying that because nobody has."
Harry crumpled the paper in his fist and crammed it back in his pocket. He stormed out of the suite, knowing full well he'd be back tomorrow and just what would transpire. Harry adjusted the front of his trousers and ignored the fact that he was looking forward to it.
Harry's eyes opened.  "Where am I?" he asked. "What happened?"  His speech was slurred, and he was incapable of movement.
Yaxley blanched.  "Oh! You mean this gate key," he said, withdrawing it from inside his shirt.
"I was hired to start a war between Hogwarts and Durmstrang," said the one called Zabini.  "The prince's death will guarantee that the people of Hogwarts will want justice."
Draco looked down and plucked at his jumper. "Do you reckon McGonagall would want to hire me?"
"Piss off," Harry grumped. However, Malfoy's sarcastic suggestion was not without merit. Harry swallowed his pride and crawled to the side of the road, where the icy grass wasn't nearly as slick as the icy cobbles. He stood up, wincing as his abused hip protested.
"Why do you look like a mad man?"
and followed Harry's example by crawling to the side of the road.
"Hermione, what are the early symptoms of pregnancy?"
Harry drew his sword, prepared to defend his beloved.
Harry frowned. "No mention was made of paying for your information," he said. "However, I am certain Robards would approve the request, as the information you have is vital to our case."
"What can I say?" teased Harry. "I'm young and randy." He pushed his bench back and stood up.
Daphne returned to the lounge, buttoning her coat on the way. She took little Blossom from Draco's arms, thanked him, and leaned in to kiss his cheek. Daphne waved at Harry and took her leave. As the door closed behind the Zabinis, Harry and Draco both collapsed on the sofa and sighed in unison. They then looked at one another and laughed.
Ineville chased after Rodolphus, catching up to him in the castle's Great Hall.  The Count snatched a knife from the table and threw it.  Ineville groaned in pain as the knife pierced his stomach.  He staggered back and slumped against a wall.  Rodolphus smirked and approached his wounded opponent.  He used his sword to stab Ineville through each shoulder.
"You have no intention of setting me free," said Harry.  "You plan to kill me."
"Inconceivable!" cried Zabini.  "We'll lose him at the Cliffs of Madness."
"Splendid," said Draco. "Go fetch it while I nip off to the Manor for a moment. Leave your Floo open to me." He strode to the Floo with his father floating along behind him.
"You think I should use the name Draco Malfoy?"
"A coward, am I?" snarled Snaperdinck.  He decided it was time to get rid of Draco's beloved, once and for all.  Snaperdinck rushed from his study to the ancient willow tree on the grounds.  He opened the secret entrance in the tree's trunk, revealing a dark tunnel.  Snaperdinck made his way quickly through the tunnel to the Shrieking Shack, where Rodolphus was supervising Harry's torture.
Draco's temper was reaching dangerous levels. The lamp on the table next to him began to wobble as he snapped, "Prove it!"
Ineville seemed disappointed.  "When I was a boy," he said, "my father was killed by a man with six fingers.  The man commissioned a sword from my father, but when he came to get it, he wanted to pay much less than they had agreed upon.  My father refused, and the bastard ran him through.  I took up the sword to avenge my father, but the six-fingered man simply laughed and slashed my cheeks before riding away."
"For luck!" chortled Max.  "I knew it!  You've been gambling, and he owes you money."
Harry's cock throbbed its approval of Draco's edict, and he eagerly joined his boyfriend in bed. They came together slowly, taking time to kiss one another while their hands wandered over familiar planes. Harry moved his lips from Draco's and began stringing little kisses down Draco's neck to his shoulder. He feathered his fingers over his boyfriend's stomach and slid his hand higher. Harry encountered a stiff nipple and gave it a pinch.
"Only the Headmistress can animate the knights," Harry muttered from his cozy nest.
The man in black halted.
"It's iocane," said the masked man.  "Odorless and tasteless, it is nevertheless highly poisonous. Pour the wine that is conveniently placed there with those two goblets."
Harry reacted with a rush of heat. "Ahem, is there room in that bathtub for one more?"
Draco nodded, too astonished to speak.
Potter said with what sounded like forced cheer.
After a moment, Potter declared, "My home, it is. I'll make dinner. Do you like shrimp scampi?"
"Cast a Protego and get your phonograph!" Draco called over his shoulder as he stepped into the Floo.
"Try it, and see what happens," Draco prodded.
"Go away! I'm retired!" he shouted at them.
Draco found himself smiling back at his mother. That tight knot of unhappiness he'd been carrying for years had finally eased inside of him. Draco only wished he'd known sooner why his father had been so disappointed in him.
"It would be a shame to kill you," said the man, "but I can't have you following me."  With that, he struck Ineville on the back of the head with the hilt of his sword, knocking him unconscious.  The masked man then followed the path that the others had taken.
Draco wheeled on his father. "Do you intend to leave this place?"
"Fine," agreed Malfoy. He extended his arm. "Let's go."
Draco was taken aback. "Am I expected to barter for everything?"
Draco jerked away from his touch. "Take that back, arsehole!"
The Count's grin faded, and he brought his sword to bear.
"I had to surrender my wand," Malfoy bit out.
"You can't give up now," scolded Hagrid.
Draco smothered a laugh, while Granger shot them both a quelling glare. "We'll meet you back at the Ministry," she said. "I can't wait to hear the full report on this one." With that, she pivoted and followed her partner out of the cottage.
"Prince Draco is this man's true love," said Ineville.  "If you bring him back, it will ruin Snaperdinck's plans to marry Draco."
"I found your six-fingered man," Hagrid told him with a wide grin.  "He is at the castle."  Indeed, Hagrid had spotted Count Rodolphus while he was training with the Troll Squad.
Draco's breath caught, but he seemed keen on continuing their game. "Are you that pleased to be with me, or did you stuff a baguette down your pants?"
The boys quailed and scampered over by their father, where Blaise berated them some more. He stood up and said, "Draco, Potter, it was good of you to invite us over. It's been an enjoyable evening, but I think it's time these two little hooligans went to bed."
"Do you need any help with dinner?" asked Draco. Typically, he cooked on weekends, while Harry handled kitchen duty during the week. Each of them enjoyed cooking, but Harry liked to allow Draco to relax after toiling all day at Gringott's.
"Hagrid, jar his memory," Ineville said.
Harry couldn't have asked for a better set-up. He opened the drawer of the table on his side of the sofa and produced the pregnancy test. "You can pee on this, and it will indicate if you're pregnant or not."
"It's time we return you to your ship," said Rodolphus.
"With this device, I can literally suck the life out of my prisoners," Rodolphus continued.  "I call it the Dementor.  Now, let's test it, shall we?"
"Yes, but I've yet to decide which of the Chudley Cannons I should invite to join me."
Bereft and bewildered, Draco allowed King Albus and Queen Minerva to escort him to the honeymoon suite.  He squeezed their hands and thanked them for the kindness they had shown him during his stay at the castle.
"Yeah, Harry, that's perfect... oh god, I'm close..."
Potter's toe began to tap, and Draco started to shimmy his hips.
"I was," said Harry.  "I don't know why he chose to spare me.  He said he needed a cabin boy.  Each night, he would tell me to sleep tight, because he may decide to kill me in the morning.  As it turns out, Riddle wanted to retire, and he was grooming me to be his replacement.  He left the pirating business, and I became the Dread Pirate Riddle."
"Malfoy."
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!""
"Harry!"
"Hm, if you're good enough, I may keep you around a bit longer," teased Draco.
"Make it quick."
to get married because of this," he said. "However, I would prefer to be married before the baby is born."
Harry returned his attention to Draco, whose face had gone even more pale.
The masked man quickly removed Draco's blindfold and untied his hands.  Draco looked at Zabini's lifeless body, then back at his rescuer.
"Where would you like to have dinner tonight?"
The man in black checked the giant for a pulse, then continued his pursuit of Zabini and Draco.
Once they'd been served, Narcissa got to the point. She pulled some coins from the pouch on her belt and slid them across the table to Draco. "Your father is on patrol, but he wanted me to give you some Muggle money for your trip to the mainland," she said. "Buy something for yourself; you deserve it. We're both so proud of you."
While Draco was at work that day, Harry went out and bought a pregnancy test. He didn't know if it would work on a male wizard, but there was no harm in trying. Convincing Draco to use it would be the difficult part.
Harry took the rest of the day off to stay with his husband while Draco was undergoing magical surgery. Harry was there to observe, while Healer Liddell performed the intricate spells that would repair Draco's shoulder. She seemed satisfied with the results, and Draco was taken to recovery.
Harry could be exasperating at times, and his youthful enthusiasm in the blankets may yet be the death of Draco, but Draco found he didn't mind so much. Of all the dragonriders in Hogsmeade, he was glad that it was Harry's drake who'd mated with Salzaria.
"How do we get into the Shrieking Shack?" growled Ineville.
"Harry, you are missing the point. I meant you were supposed to rub my feet."
"Draco? What are you doing here?"
Draco acquiesced with a smile and left the kitchen.
"You started it!" Harry hollered, belatedly realizing how childish that made him sound. He didn't care. This truly was Malfoy's fault.
"Looks like the dog was getting its arse handed to it."
"Harry, this is a nightmare," he whispered. "What will I do if I can't play Quidditch any more? I'm not ready to retire!"
"What about-"
"It makes sense," Harry began, but Draco cut him off at the knees.
"Harry, you're worrying me."
"Get on with it," Draco rumbled in response. He felt Harry press a quick kiss to his shoulder before Harry lurched upright again, grabbed Draco's hips, and began to move. Draco relaxed and spread his legs farther apart. The sensation of Harry thrusting into him wasn't unpleasant, and Draco was accustomed to it by now. Harry changed the angle of his strokes, rubbing over that spot that sent sparks of pleasure through Draco. He uttered a low moan and raised his arse higher. Harry remained blissfully silent, but for his own groans of enjoyment. Draco's cock began to fill with blood, rising between his legs and begging for some attention. He was unable to touch himself, braced as he was to withstand the force of Harry's energetic movements behind him.
"No, sometimes I'm hungry."
"Shut your willie washer," growled Malfoy. He'd arrived at the relative safety of the grass, where he levered himself upright once more.
, didn't I?"
"Not a pimple or blemish in sight, Potter. I am impressed. Do you exfoliate your bum?"
"Feeling better, love?"
"He refuses to even consider it!" cried Harry, feeling at his wit's end.
Harry glanced down quickly, only to realize he'd been had. "Prat," he groused. The bubbles came up to his chest; it would have been impressive, had his cock actually been visible above the frothy foam.
"Now that I've avenged my father, I don't know what to do with my life," Ineville admitted to Harry.
"Oh," said Harry before chuckling a little himself. "No, neither of us has been taking potions or anything."
Harry thumped a bowl of oatmeal in front of his boyfriend and scattered fresh blueberries, Draco's favorite, on top of it.
Even Draco's thoughts sounded dispirited.
Harry felt his back teeth grind together and had to consciously relax his jaw. "You expect me to whore myself out for information?" Inwardly, he was seething, but his ruddy cock was reacting with a surge of interest.
"I am not setting foot on that death trap!" Draco exclaimed.
"You do know how to ruin a spot of fun, don't you, Potter?"
Seeing him again was like a punch to Harry's gut. Malfoy was still as arrogant and attractive as Harry remembered.
Harry awoke the following morning to Draco moving restlessly. He reached out and grinned when his hand landed on Draco's thigh. "In the mood?" he asked in a husky voice.
"It was the best I could do for now," said Harry.
Draco joined Potter within the protected space and began flipping through his Mum's record albums. "Father has always loathed The Beatles and John Lennon in particular. No wonder he hated you."
Draco straightened momentarily, only to slump back again. "How would that work out, me living at Hogwarts and you staying in London?"
"Yeah, that's what he said," Harry told her. "But, he has so many symptoms."
Harry stared after him in bemused silence until he realized his eyes were on Malfoy's arse. Giving his head a slight shake, Harry stepped into the suite and closed the door behind him. He settled into an authoritative stance, shoulders squared and hands clasped behind his back.
"I wouldn't dream of it," Harry replied.
Hagrid was hired as one of the Troll Squad, assigned to clear the Forbidden Forest.  There, he found Ineville.  His friend had been drinking heavily, and Hagrid hauled Ineville home to sober him up.
"I'm fine, and if you don't move-OOH!"
"If this bothers you, Father, you are welcome to leave."
Malfoy glared at him from where he sat in the middle of the road. He located his hat and jammed it back on his head. "What about me?"
"That's Malfoy-Potter, thank you," quipped Draco.
"Since it appears this brawl was two against one, I'm going to speculate the cat and the hare are Harry and Malfoy, and the dog is one Mildred Canino."
Draco opened his eyes and smiled. "It sounds as if you're gagging for a shag."
"Go on," said Draco, making a shooing motion at his partner.
The stirring ceased abruptly. Draco's head remained bent, but there was tension in every line of his body. "I don't want to be pregnant," he said in a small voice.
"Let me consult with Hermione and see what she thinks," Harry said, striving to keep his tone soothing and professional.
fault," he growled.
King Albus smiled and nodded.  "Won't that be nice?"
"You're like an angry little cat."
"What's wrong, loves?" she taunted. "Couldn't open the door?" The woman threw her head back and cackled out a laugh. She planted her hands on her hips and sneered. "What a fine pair of Aurors you are."
"Logic says you would place the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I should not drink from the goblet in front of me," said Zabini.  "However, you are clever enough to ascertain that I would know that; therefore, you would have placed the poison in your own goblet, anticipating that I would switch them."  He continued blathering on about the probability of which goblet contained the poison, while the man in black simply sat there.
"I'm not hungry," Draco muttered, slumping into a chair. He accepted a cup of ginger tea with a nod of thanks. "I believe I ate too much last night," he said after his first sip. "Dinner was delightful, Harry, but I fear I overindulged."
Draco cleared his throat, all traces of humour gone. "Well?"
From outside, they heard Hagrid calling.  Harry, Draco and Ineville rushed to the window and peered down into the courtyard.  Hagrid was holding the reins of four white horses.  "I found them in the stable," he said.  "Since there are four of us, I brought them with me."
"You knew what she would say."
"What was that?" gasped Hagrid.
"I'll make you some toast," offered Harry, trying not to sound disappointed. It was clear there would be no shag this morning.
"A shag?! You just had surgery a few hours ago!"
Harry strutted after him and unbelted his tunic. He cocked a brow in Draco's direction as he let the belt fall to the floor. "Are you trying to guilt me into not shagging you?"
"I reckon we both need to be more careful," Harry remarked. His hip still ached, and he didn't fancy falling down again. He took a cautious step and then another while Malfoy was only just regaining his feet. There was a scrap of parchment beside the road, and Harry stabbed it with his grabber. Pleased with his victory, he brought the piece of rubbish to his bag, which he pivoted to reach. The movement caused Harry to lose his footing again. He yelped, flapped about, dropped his grabber and latched onto Malfoy for support.
Draco sucked in a breath. Hogsmeade was known for producing Seers, typically one or two each generation. For the most part, prophecies were not revealed to the person or persons they concerned, but rather to a close family member. "Is it...am I in danger?"
"You never sent your ships after Harry," Draco accused.  "You knew he would return for me, and you were afraid.  You're nothing but a coward!"  Draco stormed out of the study, leaving a fuming Snaperdinck behind.
Harry responded with a pleased grin. "Minerva informed me that Madam Pomfrey is also keen on retiring."
"Stop saying that!" bellowed the Count.  He was back on his heels now as Ineville launched an attack.
"Enough, Harry..."
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and hugged him close and tight, nearly squeezing the breath out of him as he did so. "Do you need some pity?" he teased. Draco petted Harry's head while chanting, "Pity, pity, pity."
"I aim to make Santa's naughty list each year," Harry informed him as solemnly as he was able.
Harry sat up straight, eyes wide with excitement. "They've already put up the Christmas tree?! What are we waiting for?"
Draco was about to lambaste him for his egregious lack of judgment that had landed them in their predicament, but he held his tongue. Potter had saved him in there, even if it was his fault that Draco needed rescuing in the first place. He settled for shrugging and spitting once more.
One of the other guards struck Harry in the head with a sword hilt, and Harry knew no more.
Harry flung his hands in the air and stomped out.
Harry pressed one finger inside, and his cock gave an eager throb when Draco clamped down on his digit. Harry worked his finger in and out before adding a second. Draco's hands moved, gripping the pillow on each side of his head. Harry kept up the slow torment, grinning when Draco bore down on his fingers.
"It takes me forever to warm up; you know that," Harry protested.
Draco dutifully drank the potion, crinkled his nose, then sipped at the water. He lay back and quirked his lips in a grin. "Are you planning to stay here and entertain the invalid?"
"What was that?" taunted Harry. "I can't hear you all the way up here."
"Draco, maybe you should see a Healer," Harry suggested gently. "Your appetite is waning, and this isn't the first time you've been ill."
"Ginger tea?"
Harry sifted his fingers through Draco's short blond hair, and his heart melted when Draco turned to smile at him. Harry hated to start this row, but it had to be done.
Harry returned from his shift at St Mungo's to find Draco sitting in the window seat and staring moodily out at the gardens. "Hey," he said quietly, setting his bag on a chair. "How did your follow-up with Healer Liddell go?"
On the weekend, Harry suggested having Blaise and Daphne Zabini over for dinner. He didn't particularly care for Draco's friends, but they had children, and he hoped that seeing the youngsters would trigger something in Draco.
"I am going to dump the iocane into one of these glasses," said the masked man.  "Your challenge is to guess which one."  He took both goblets and turned his back so that Zabini couldn't see what he was doing.  The man turned back and set one goblet in front of each of them.  "Tell me, which goblet contains the poison?"
"By haunting Grimmauld Place?!" cried Draco. His father used to make sense...when he was alive.
Draco seemed absorbed in stirring his tea. Finally, without looking up, he muttered, "I peed on your ruddy stick."
Heart beating rapidly, Harry told him, "That's a positive sign. It means you're pregnant."
Draco looked back and waved at the villagers who'd come to see them off. Once they were far enough into the channel, Dean and Seamus expertly unfurled the sail. The breeze caught it, and the boat began to skim over the water.
"I have one right here," said Hagrid, pulling the shimmering material out of his shirt.
"It is a fine weapon," praised the masked man.  He drew his own sword and assumed a fighting stance.  The two men began with cautious thrusts and parries, testing one another's skill.
"Do you reckon those stories about SOUSes are true?" Draco wondered.
"Are you feeling okay?" asked Harry.
Draco was in better spirits when he left for his job at Gringott's, and he was no grouchier than usual when he returned. Harry, who crafted brooms in a workshop at the bottom of the garden, was hopeful of making up for the lack of sex that morning. Once Draco had changed out of his suit and tie in favor of jeans and a Weasley jumper, Harry greeted him with a kiss.
"No!" Harry cried, then again more calmly. "No, of course not. I'm, er, I'm asking for a friend."
Harry was happy to oblige and equally happy to let Draco set the pace. Anything for sex. Draco moved to straddle him, but his sexy smile turned to a grimace. He scrambled off Harry and bolted for the en suite. Harry was left aching and confused. He sat up in time to hear Draco being sick. Lust fled in favor of concern. Harry clambered out of bed, stepped into a pair of pyjama bottoms, and grabbed Draco's robe. He had it ready when Draco plodded out of the loo.
"He didn't fall?!  Inconceivable!"
Draco's mood was much improved when he came home that evening. They had a nice dinner and spent the rest of the evening relaxing in the lounge. Harry watched a film on the telly, while Draco sat at the opposite end of the sofa, reading a book. Their legs were tangled together, and Harry took the opportunity to engage in some flirtatious footsie. Draco was sending him heated looks, and Harry's entire body was thrumming with desire by the time they went up to bed.
Harry's heart skipped a beat. He kept his voice even and asked, "What did it say?"
"Are you agreeing to marry me?" asked Harry, his heart in his throat.
"We seriously don't have time," said Draco. "Dinner is in fifteen minutes, and you know there'll be nothing left if we don't arrive at the same time as Goyle and Weasley."
Draco dashed to the entrance in time to see the dragons catch an air current as they made a wide, banking turn and headed in the direction of the sea. Draco watched until they were out of sight, mesmerized as always by how beautiful and graceful Salzaria was in the air. He then returned to his task, ready to take on a new adventure.
"I'm meant to have a surname?" Draco ventured.
Harry's heart beat fast in excitement. A baby! They were going to have a baby. Well, he was almost certain that was the case. Harry only hoped Draco would be equally excited.
Back in the honeymoon suite, Draco calmly seated himself at a vanity table and withdrew an ornamental dagger from a wooden box.  He drew in a deep breath, grasped the dagger with both hands, and aimed it at his chest.
Narcissa sighed and fidgeted with her tunic. "This is not something I should be discussing with you."
"Swear to me that you will spare him," Draco demanded as one of the men disarmed Harry.
Ineville turned to the giant.  "Hagrid, rip his arms off."
"N-nothing," Harry blurted. "It's...I just would prefer to be prepped manually. I, er, I love it when you...when you finger me."
Harry couldn't help but notice that there was a tear in Malfoy's trousers, above his left knee. He hoped Malfoy wouldn't notice, otherwise there-
The hotel staff had strewn rose petals all over it.
Draco exclaimed. He found himself face to face with a black cat. A black cat with green eyes and a faintly guilty expression.
Harry downed the last of his drink and focused his green eyes on Draco. "I believe the next item on our agenda was a celebratory shag," he stated.
"You were taking too long," said Harry. He unbuttoned his fly but paused when he realized Draco was simply standing there and watching him. "Are you going to participate or spectate?"
Harry responded with a lazy hum. "Too bad we don't have the time for that."
Harry scowled and tugged his bobble hat down as far as he could while still being able to see. It didn't help much; it was bloody cold out, and Harry didn't have a wand. Per the stipulations of his community payback, he was not allowed to use magic.
"The odds of it happening without potions are infinitesimal!" Draco exclaimed. "Even you aren't so all-powerful as to impregnate me without the use of potions."
Draco responded with a small, sad smile, and Harry was instantly contrite.
"I have a better idea," said Draco. "Let's go down to the Great Hall for dinner. I believe Hagrid brought in a massive Scottish pine for the hols."
"You know nothing," snarled Draco, taking a step closer to the man.  "You can die, for all I care!" he cried, giving the pirate a shove.
A sudden jostling alerted Harry that Draco was getting out of bed. He propped himself on his elbows and cocked his head. Sounds from the bathroom let him know that Draco was simply relieving himself. He heard the faucet run for a few moments, then Draco returned to bed. He curved into Harry and shivered.
the Troll Squad," he muttered.  "Alright, alright, come on in."  Max opened the door and beckoned them inside.
Draco stepped out of the Floo and into Grimmauld Place. It looked different than the last time he'd been there, which admittedly had been years ago. The house was brighter, lighter, and it didn't seem as oppressive as Draco remembered.
Draco groaned at the silly quip before groaning for an entirely different reason when Harry sank down on him.
"Geroff, you clumsy cunt!" yelled Malfoy. He shoved at Harry and scrabbled to his knees.
Harry slid off of his dragon and entered the cavern, dressed in his flight gear. He picked up his bag and gave it a shake.
"You know I enjoy a bit of rough every now and then," said Draco, wriggling away and draping his body over Harry's. They tussled across the bed, nearly falling off the edge once before Harry gained control by tickling Draco into submission.
Lucius immediately ceased pinging about the lounge. "Draco, I forbid you to play those."
From beneath the Invisibility cloak, Hagrid and Ineville rushed the gate, pushing Harry along in the wheelbarrow.  Hagrid whisked the cloak away, and Ineville grabbed Yaxley's lapels.  "Where is the gate key?" he demanded.
"He was shocked," said Narcissa. "We all were. Your father calmed down eventually, and now that you have been selected to parlay with the Muggles, he is excited about the prophecy all over again."
"Then it wasn't a legal marriage," Harry said.
"Hah! Still here, I see."
"I've been cheating on you with the Chudley Cannons," Harry quipped.
"Yeah, but I'm scared I'll make a mistake and disappoint Minerva and Dumbledore and my family."
"How did you know which goblet he would drink from?" he asked.
"Second best."
Draco refrained from further comment. There was no sense panicking Potter. They both needed to keep their wits about them.
Potter's brow furrowed. "I don't follow you."
Harry didn't stop moving until his groin was snug to Draco's arse. He paused then and rubbed soothing circles at the base of Draco's spine. "Alright there?"
"Do you know what would make it even nicer?"
Harry turned at the unexpected reaction. All he saw was Draco disappearing around the corner. Concerned, he turned off the fire under the skillets and trailed after his boyfriend. Harry heard the door to the half-bath slam shut, and he hovered uncertainly outside. He heard the unmistakable sound of Draco getting sick. Harry raised his hand to knock but thought better of it. He waited until he heard the toilet flush before returning to the kitchen. He had just put the food in the fridge when Draco came back.
That day was one of the longest Draco could remember. He now had absolute certainty that Harry hadn't received the proper vaccinations. Even Draco's sluggish immune system was doing a much better job of fighting this virus than Harry's. The fever reducer worked for a bit, but then Draco had to resort to peeling the blue sweater off of Harry's fevered torso. He spelled a cool wet rag for Harry's head, and the man slept on. Draco could see close to double the pockmarks on Harry as he had on himself, and his skin had turned a dark, foreboding green shade. Draco tried his best to rest in between Harry's fevered tossing and turning, but both of their sneezing fits were becoming more frequent. Seven times he'd had to extinguish fires caused by Harry's sneezes, and only thrice for his own.
* * * * * * *
“Yeah, Ted. I’m in with Papa.” Draco leaned down to press a kiss to Harry’s head. He was going to call a healer if he didn’t see any change soon. Behind him, he could hear Teddy’s little feet padding into the room. “Hey, Buddy. You okay?”
“Fine,” he sighed. “But I wish I'd brought my soup. And don't even bother saying I told you so. I regret it well enough on my own. I've got some granola bars. You want one?”
“You're too hot.”
“I know, Malfoy,” Harry sighed. “But look, I'm not the one who's sick right now. You are. If I get this and we are still locked in here, then we'll just have to deal with that then. But right now, please, just lay back down and let me help you, alright?”
Draco and his mother had both been under Lucius Malfoy's Imperius curse for the majority of Draco's seventh year. Lucius believed so strongly in the Dark Lord's power. He fought both his wife and son for their loyalty to the cause, and when it became evident that they wouldn't give themselves willingly, he took it upon himself to ensure that glory would come to the Malfoy name. Of course, he'd been wrong.
“Daddy, Papa is really sick. And Scorpius is sick too and you have to come home. We need you.”
She could see the tired lines throughout his green-tinged face. She brushed his sweaty hair out of his eyes. “I gotta say, D, I don't think green is really your color.”
“Yes, I’m okay.”
“I don’t feel good,” he said weakly.
He sounded horribly congested. Harry took a deep breath and reached out to pull Draco's hands away, feeling his forehead, and then his flushed cheeks. “You're feverish.”
Harry cursed quietly to himself as the owl flew back out the open window. This was the last thing he wanted to hear right now. He had to just take this one kid at a time.
. . . . . . . . . .
Harry had only a moment to process what Teddy said before he was doubled over, getting sick in the bin next to the bed.
“He slept in for a while this morning, and by lunchtime, he was running a fever. He has been coughing and sicking up all day. And complaining of a sore throat.”
“How many did I pack?”
Harry nodded and held the handkerchief out to him. Draco's fingers grasped it tightly, his hand just centimeters under Harry's. A moment later they both felt a familiar tug on their belly buttons.
Harry began being pulled from the nightmarish memory of his past. He heard Scorpius crying and felt a little hand tugging his shirtsleeve.
“Do something, Healer Lawson.” The healer glanced up over Draco's shoulder. “Before he goes into a full-blown panic attack. Draco barely noticed their interaction.
“Of course, love,” Draco said, stepping back from Harry. With a wink, he added, “I know what a worried mother goose you turn into when the boys are ill.”
“The Weasleys? The hell with them. I need you to keep me updated about him first!”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief as he watched Teddy climb up onto the bed and slide into Harry’s arms. Harry remembered his son, so that was a good sign. He went back to packing in silence. Walking over to the dresser, Draco reached a drawer and pulled out Harry’s favorite pair of flannel pajamas, the red ones with the golden snitch pattern.
“Teddy was sick, and you were working. And then your mother came by and handed off Scorpius after he started showing symptoms.”
“Er, not yet. I fell asleep pretty much right after you left. I’ll go and drink it now.”
That's what Draco was afraid of. His own throat and chest burned, but Harry sounded much worse. At what point would Harry find it too painful to breathe?
The pair was suddenly interrupted by a crash from inside the room.
Some wizard had sent in a tip about strange activity seen at an old abandoned manor which belonged to a Death  Eater in Azkaban. Harry and Draco had been assigned to go to the property in Scotland to check for anything unusual. The wizard reported that he had seen two men wearing dark cloaks carrying a large, heavy piece of furniture into the home. Given the nature of the previous homeowners, Kingsley was concerned about the possibility of it being a dark artifact. He gave Harry and Draco a portkey to get them there, and to Harry's amusement, it was a handkerchief. Seemed rather fitting for Draco at the moment.
“Get your filthy hands off my kid, Malfoy!”
‘Not now.’ He thought.
“I am going to ask you to calm down Mr. Malfoy. Yelling about this isn't going to benefit either of you.” Harry's wide green eyes met Draco's as the Healers pushed him in his bed out of the room.
“We'll be out of here soon. I'm sure of it. Granger's like a bloodhound with these things and Weasley will stop and nothing to protect you. You have good friends who are out there looking for you right now. You know that.”
“Of course, Har.” Draco said, squinting at him. Was it his imagination or was his husband looking a bit peaky? “Did you take the echinacea potion yet?”
“I don’t know...” Draco started, as if in a trance. He stared into the bright and glassy emerald eyes which were glaring back at him. His husband was covered in sweat. He looked sicker than Draco had ever seen him, and he was terrifying. It was as if his husband had transformed back into his sixteen year old self. Draco turned quickly away to start packing Harry a bag to bring with them to St. Mungo’s, but he was so worried he could barely think straight. If Harry’s fever was so high he was forgetting literal years of information, then Draco probably should have gotten him to St. Mungo’s hours ago.
Harry scrunched his eyes shut, willing whoever it was to go away, but the knocking persisted. He realized with a start that it was Narcissa bringing his sick baby Scorpius home. Harry got up slowly, so as to not disturb Teddy. Coughing again, he slowly walked downstairs to the front door, glancing at the grandfather clock as he passed through the living room. It was only noon, but that meant that Draco would be home soon.
“Okay. What do we know ...” Harry mumbled, more to himself than to Draco. “Our portkey didn't bring us to the right place, and it didn't bring us back when it was supposed to.
“Harry! You’re awake!” Draco uncurled himself from the bed and rushed to Harry’s side. “How are you feeling?”
“Good idea. Maybe try Granger as well.” Draco pulled out a granola bar but was only able to eat half before his aching throat decided to protest. He glanced warily at the other half of the bar before deciding to cover it carefully in the wrapper and save it for later. The persistent tickle in his nose and throat was beginning to drive him crazy.
* * * * * * *
Draco frowned. “I know you're hurting. Think you can drink some water for me?” The brunette weakly shook his head.
Harry struggled to get up to help; he needed to help. He knew he needed to take care of his family, but his body had other plans. He leaned over the bin once more.
“We were both going through something traumatic. And I probably had a fever and-”
Potter unconsciously licked his finger to get a better grip on the page he was turning, a Draco realized that he'd been staring again. Potter looked so engrossed in the paperwork, Draco was sure that Potter wouldn't notice if he closed his eyes for a moment. Resting his head on a propped up elbow and listening to the familiar calming sound of Potter's quill, Draco nodded off.
‘Was that Draco?’ Harry wondered. ‘Did Draco come home?’
“You've been hanging out with Molly Weasley too much.”
“-Hermione,” Ron’s voice sounded from another room in the Weasley home. “Do we have any more tissues?”
“You've never received any of your wizarding vaccines?”
Following the war, the Daily Prophet wrote an exclusive on all that Lucius Malfoy had done to his family. Draco had sold the story to them himself. All he had wanted was for him and his mother to have a fair chance at life after his father was finally behind bars. It had taken months of Auror questioning under veritaserum for Draco and his mother to finally be acquitted. They were both ordered to seek out Mind Healers after that, which Draco did, but it took even longer for him to realize the implications the curse had on his health. The specialist at St. Mungo's assured him that with proper food and exercise, his immune system would eventually recover. She'd advised adopting a low-stress lifestyle, but at that point, he was too far in Auror training to turn back. Draco wanted so badly to prove to the public that he could play the hero just as well as anyone who'd fought for the Light side in the war. He was sick and tired of being seen as the villain, or as the victim. And when he and Harry had defied all expectations and had actually become friends, Draco knew he'd never be able to quit his job. Not as long as Harry was his partner.
“I fell,” was all Harry could manage. Draco lifted him back on the bed and helped him pull up the waistband of his pants before Harry even had time to blink. The fall seemed to shake Harry back into reality and he leaned forward, placing his warm forehead against Draco’s chest. “Dray ... I don’t feel good.”
“Good. I’ll be back soon,” Harry said, carrying the crying baby out of Teddy’s room and down the hall into the master bedroom.
“...shit!” Draco scrambled up and away from Harry, but who knows how long he may have been contagious for. They'd been huddled under the same blanket for nearly six hours. “Potter, we've got to get out!” He was breathing heavily from the exertion of standing and Harry could see beads of sweat forming hear his hairline. His green-tinged skin looked almost translucent.
The boy nodded and drank the potion obediently. “There’s a good boy. Any better?”
“Harry! You alright?” Draco came busting in to see Harry sitting on the floor in his boxers, his pajama pants pulled up halfway.
“Of course I can, Ted. Want me to read from one of your books?”
Harry walked slowly up the stairs to Teddy’s room. All of his muscles ached, and it reminded him of his time training to be an Auror. It had been a good job, and he was looking forward to joining the force again someday. But right now, he was happy to spend his days at home with his sons.
“We had to sedate you. But then you got sicker.”
* * * * * * *
Harry coughed again into his elbow. He felt as though he could feel his chest rattling with each cough. Merlin, what he wouldn’t give to just lie down for a bit. Harry sighed wistfully. Later, he promised himself, I will rest. Just as soon as I can get Teddy’s fever down. Harry had forgotten all about his own rising fever.
“Where does it burn?”
Draco nodded, watched suspiciously as Harry and slid up out of the little bed and left the room. ‘Please,’ he thought to himself, ‘please don’t let Harry be catching this flu.”
“Is there any possibility that either you or Mr. Potter frequented The Rainy Bell Tavern in London within the last two weeks?”
“Then get back to work”.
“You did, actually. Although apparently you were being drugged at the time,” Harry smirked. The bastard.
Truth be told, Harry hadn’t been feeling all that well himself since that day.
“I am fine!” Harry said, brushed a strand Scorpius’s wispy blonde hair behind his little ear. “Ted’s been better. I just got his fever under control. Have you spoken to Draco today?”
“Papa...?”
“I’ve already asked Neville! And Theo. Everyone has this damn flu.”
Hermione smiled reassuringly at him, pausing for a moment before answering. If anyone had told her as a teenager that years down the line, her and Draco Malfoy would come to rely on one another, basically as in-laws, she would have laughed in their face.
“Harry, dear,” Narcissa paused, passing the baby to him. “How are you? How is my grandson?”
Draco forcefully swatted Harry's hand. He looked at up with a pained expression before pushing himself up on one elbow and letting out a deafening and very un-Malfoy-like sneeze. Harry's eyes widened in surprise and he moved away just in time; as Draco sneezed, fiery sparks burst out of his nose. One landed on Draco's sleeve, and Harry rushed to pat down the spark before it could catch fire.
“Welcome to my hell, Weasley,” Draco said, getting up to hand Harry their goblet of water, again. Draco overestimated his strength and swayed dangerously. Weasley shot out the hand that wasn't holding up Harry to pull at Draco's wrist before he tumbled sideways. Pansy pushed over to his side and wrapped an arm around his waist to help stabilize him.
Teddy coughed tiredly. “I’m tired Daddy. I just want to sleep.”
Teddy nodded and Harry helped him to sit up. He gave Teddy the potion just as he heard an owl scratch at Teddy’s window. Harry helped Ted back down onto the pillows before walking over to open the window. The small pristine looking grey owl flew in, perching on Teddy’s desk. It was Narcissa’s. Harry took the note from its leg, rubbing the side of its head with his knuckle. He unraveled the note, seeing Narcissa’s elegant scrawling cursive.
Logically, Draco knew that the unusual behavior Harry displayed whenever he was feeling under the weather was attributed to those horrible muggles he’d grown up with. They’d treated him worse than a house elf, and they never cared for him the way a child should be cared for. Most of the time, Harry insisted that the past was in the past and that the Dursley’s behavior didn’t affect him anymore. But whenever Harry was sick, he would isolate himself and try and downplay what was going on. Which made Draco have to work extra hard just to figure out what was going on.
Harry saw that had an IV in his arm, connected to the machine that was endlessly beeping. And then he saw his husband, curled uncomfortably in a chair next to his bed, fast asleep. Although his muscles ached with every move, Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand into his own. Draco’s eyes snapped open at his husband’s touch.
Draco was one of the most prepared people Harry knew, second only to Hermione maybe. In fact, that bag reminded Harry of the one Hermione carried during the year they spent searching for Horcruxes. On more than one occasion Harry wondered if she'd been the one to give it to him in the first place.
“Twice. That only happened twice.” Harry rolled his eyes but stayed quiet, watching the blonde circle around the room in his usual dance to gather everything he wanted. He knew better than to fight Draco on this, the man would over-pack regardless. And if he was being honest, Draco's stupid bag helped them more times than he was willing to admit.
“I'm fine Potter.  It's not that bad. It's not your job to question my dietary habits.”
Draco Malfoy was finally heading to the apparition point after a very long day at work. This year marked his third year of running his own apothecary and pharmacy on Diagon Alley, and as he trudged through the gray and drizzling English streets, he found himself once again annoyed at the Ministry of Magic’s new regulations regarding apparition.
“Mhmm, fine,” Harry took another sip of wine. “Wrong pipe.” While they went back to eating, Harry considered his options. It seemed ridiculous to be pretending like this. He was with his husband, for crying out loud. Draco loved him. He should just tell him he was beginning to feel poorly.
“What about Blaise?”
‘This morning I woke up and discovered that Scorpius is under the weather. I’m so sorry, I had hoped that isolating him from his brother might have prevented him from becoming ill. He is resting now, but when he wakes I will bring him to you. Let me know if there is anything else you need.
“I never said that I loved-”
Draco pulled the edges of his thick wool cloak higher around his neck in an attempt to get warm. The rain drizzled down the edges of his umbrella charm and he shivered. Just one more block until the apparition point. He could’ve taken the floo directly from his office, but he had wanted to bring home some immunity boosting potions for Harry and their sons. The last thing he wanted was for one of them to be down with the flu while Draco was so busy at work. So, apparition it was.
Draco he finally found his husband washing his hands in the bathroom connected to their bedroom.
Only about two hours in, Draco began tossing and turning in his sleep. He was muttering incomprehensibly and it was clear that he was having a nightmare, but Harry wasn't sure whether to wake him up or just let him ride it out on his own. He gently reached out to feel in his fever had risen, but his hand froze in midair as Draco startled awake. His glazed eyes focused on Harry in a panic, and it took a long moment before his brain finally caught on the fact that he was not in any imminent danger.  Breathing heavily, Draco immediately scrunched up his forehead in pain.
“Give Ginny our best!” Draco said, just as Pansy was disappearing from the flames.
Blaise’s booming voice cut into his thoughts from another side of the apothecary. “Oi, Draco, We have a customer over here who wants a flesh-eating slug repellent, and I can’t find any.”
“Yeah, I bet.” Draco bit out, although most of his venom had fallen away. “I know that you are probably still not feeling your best, but do you have any idea how upsetting it is for me that you never seem to let me in and tell me what’s going on?”
“ Okay,” Teddy mumbled, sitting up. Draco could hear the congestion in his voice. Handing Teddy the glass, he watched as Teddy took three small sips before sinking back into the pillows.
“But I’m comfortable!” Harry complained.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and looked down at the comforter.
Teddy thought for a moment. “Where’d papa go?”
“Yes please,” the boy replied, eyes fluttering shut.
“I’ll take it your silence means you know I’m right?” Pansy asked irritatingly.
Eventually Draco came downstairs, dressed in green silk pajama pants and a white t-shirt. “Hey, I didn’t expect you to be making dinner.”
* * * * * *
Harry shut the window and turned back to Teddy, one hand coming up to rub at his temple. He had a serious headache coming on. “That was Nana,” he sighed. “Scorp is sick now too”.
“I know, love. I know. I need you to sit up and take some medicine for me, okay?”
“Har har,” Draco replied, attempting a sneer. Harry just smirked at him.
* * * * * * *
“Malfoy, I never applied to be an Auror! Robards recruited me after the war, and I just accepted. I never applied!”
“Nope. You're not getting out of this that easily.”
“I don’t know,” Draco sighed. “I got him to drink some water. He’s asleep now, but when I left his temp was 101.4. We’ll have to keep checking it. Any higher and I want to give him a fever reducer and...” Draco stopped suddenly. “What are you wearing?”
After staying with Teddy for a little while to reassure him and make him as comfortable as possible, Draco carried Scorpius into the nursery. He peeked in at Harry as he passed the master bedroom and saw that his husband was asleep.
Just as he was about to sit back down, his wand began to buzz, which meant Kingsley had a field assignment for them. He frowned and went through his usual mental checklist to make sure he would be well enough to be out on the field. He wasn't dizzy or nauseous, and he didn't think he had a fever yet. Just a headache, chills, and mild fatigue. Nothing too bad. Some fresh, warm air would probably be good for him right now.
“Do you ... um ...” Draco mumbled, knowing full well how Harry would respond to him. “Do you want some help?” Draco wasn’t convinced that Harry would actually have the strength to change his clothes on his own right now.
“You’re undermining my bravery, Potter?” He smirked down at his sick husband, whose eyes were now fluttering closed. “What are you, scared?”
Harry worked his eyes open to see Draco looming over him. There were bright streaks of mid-day light seeping around the edges of their makeshift window cover. Draco's skin looked even more green and pockmarks were peeking out from the neckline of his robes. His eyes were drawn down to Draco's lips, which were pulled downward in a tight, tense line. “What'sa matter?”
* * * * * * *
Draco put his soup under a stasis charm on his desk but threw a couple of extra protein bars in his bag for good measure. “I'll eat later. As you said, this will be quick.”
“You've been getting too thin.”
“Not anymore. I heard the bartender there came down with dragon pox last week.”
Harry tried to lift himself up off of the bed, but his muscles wouldn’t offer him much support. After a few moments of struggling, he gave up and looking down at the floor, whispered a quiet, “I’m sorry.”
“We need to get him into a pressure chamber and pump the air with potions to clear the smoke in his lungs.”
I’ll be home as soon as I can.
“We can ask Kingsley to assign someone else...”
Walking into the master bedroom, Draco saw that Harry was shivering, even under the mess of blankets. His dark hair laid flat and stuck to his forehead. As much as Draco wanted to let him rest, he needed to check his fever, and probably try to get some potions into him.
“Alright, I suppose I did,” Draco laughed.
Draco looked at the cloak covering the window, swallowing down the burn in his own throat. It had been hours since any light seeped through the fabric, so it must be night again. That meant they'd been there for a day and a half already. What was taking so long?
“What? Potter, don't be daft. Of course, we're friends.” he laughed. “Don't tell Pansy, but we might even be best friends.” Harry nodded, barely reacting, and Draco wondered if he'd remember this conversation when he woke up next. He helped Harry sink back down to the pillow and then laid down himself.
“38.2, he seems to be responding properly.”
“Please?” He asked again with a slight smile, and Draco begrudgingly laid back down, albeit much further from Harry than he had been, to begin with. “Are you warm enough?”
Draco sat with him for over an hour. He used a spell to cool the compress over and over, but it didn’t seem to make a difference. Harry’s fever wouldn’t break. Should he try to spell a fever reducer into him after all? For a moment, Draco considered calling his own mother over to help. Or maybe Molly?
“Can't say they do, mate. Here, give me that.” Harry took the sponge and with a few waved of his wand, transfigured it into a large mattress that would cover most of the floor of their cell. “Up,” he instructed and Draco stood to help him lower the mattress onto the floor.  Harry then took off his outer robes.
* * * * * * *
And just like their night at the pub, Draco had trouble tearing his eyes away. He chalked it up to a developing fever.
Harry turned to look, and squeezed Draco’s hand back.
“Sir,” The Healer to Harry's left spoke to the one who'd been talking with Draco, “The infection has spread to his lungs. It's more advanced than we thought.”
Draco laughed at her, only now realizing how much energy he'd spent worrying over his partner. He was ready to sleep for a week.
“Get away from me!”
“I'll explain later. Please, just take him!”
“The kids and I were over at George and Angelina’s, and then Freddy said he wasn’t feeling well, and... er, yeah. I guess I felt it the next day.”
This, of course, irked Draco to his very core. Anyone who had the slightest bit of potions knowledge would know that freshly brewed potions don’t floo well. They get shaken up too much and it makes them less effective, but having to walk 6 blocks to the nearest apparition point was a major inconvenience for Draco’s customers. For months now Draco had been applying to get an apparition point put into his shop, but he still hadn’t heard back from the ministry. Hermione had assured him that the delay in response had nothing to do with his last name, but he still wasn’t sure.
Shocked, Harry felt the boy’s head and neck again and found that it didn’t feel nearly as warm as the spell suggested. Harry wasn’t sure if that meant that his fever had also risen, or if there was something wrong with his spell.
Draco put the cups of tea on the bedside table and gently shook Harry’s shoulder. Green eyes slowly cracked open to peer up at him.
“But... but I can't take care of you like I'm supposed to if I'm sick.” A big tear-streaked it's way down Harry's cheek.
Draco reached into his bag and pulled out small fleece cloth. He enlarged it into a thick fleece blanket before handing it to Harry. “I suppose we are going to have to make ourselves comfortable.”
“Haven’t you learned to expect the unexpected around me? I mean, you did marry the golden boy,” Harry teased.
“Love you.”
“I made us some pasta. Can you grab us some plates?” He said, coughing once.
The room was quiet for a long moment as Draco scrambled to pack a hospital bag. Finally, the silence was broken by Teddy’s fear-filled voice.
. . . . . . . . . .
“Never...? Malfoy, I don't understand,” Hermione exclaimed, sitting down next to Harry and beginning to fuss over him.
Harry, however, had not woken up, and Draco was worried. His fever was still dangerously high and Draco wanted to bring him to St. Mungo’s, but he needed to find someone to sit with the kids. He firecalled Molly, but she was busy helping Angelina nurse George and baby Fred back to health.
“Get some more rest, I’m just going to be downstairs”, Harry whispered. He picked up the blankets from the floor and tucked them around Teddy, smiling as the boy snuggled down into them.
“It’s okay, Harry”. Hermione interrupted, as Draco just stood there, shocked. “You change your clothes and I’m gonna go bring Teddy back to his room, ok? You change.” Harry allowed Hermione to scoop Teddy into her arm and carry him back to his room.
“No, nothing hot. My insides feel like they are on fire already. Can you spell me a goblet of cold water?”
He stood slowly, bouncing Scorpius in his arms. “Teddy, I’m gonna walk him around and see what’s up. You good for now?”
Draco reached out to grab him under the arms and pulled him up to sitting although his muscles ached with the effort. “Not yet. Take this.” He pushed and uncorked vial of fever reducer into Harry's hands, and watched as the brunette drank obediently. In the year since they'd become friends, Harry had helped Draco recover from illnesses dozens of times. This was the first time Draco had ever seen Harry sick, and he seemed to be much more pliable than Draco had anticipated.
“Who, Harry? There's no one here but us.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“Hermione, he's barely lucid,” Ron complained, trying to pull Harry to his feet while one of the Aurors worked on packing up their makeshift sickroom. Once upright, Harry elbowed Ron away from him to sneeze, making the redhead yelp at the sudden sparks hitting his robes.
* * * * * * *
Draco scowled. Damn hero complex.
‘Good,’ he thought. ‘He needs it.’ Draco sat them both down on the rocking chair and conjured a bottle of warm milk, but after a few moments, he accepted that Scorpius wasn’t interested. Draco didn’t push as it seemed nausea was a major part of this flu. So he just sat there rocking his baby gently and humming to himself as he worried over the harsh coughing he could hear coming from Harry in the next room. It took only about 15 minutes for Scorpius’s eyes begin blinking drowsily up at him. Draco placed him down in his crib just as he was falling asleep, and covered him with a light blanket. He would need to come back to check his temperature soon, but first Draco needed to see to Harry.
“Water?” He choked out, and Draco immediately raised the goblet to his lips. The water helped, but only marginally. “This all just keeps going from bad to worse,” he murmured quietly.  Once Harry was done, Draco set the goblet aside and pulled out their last fever reducer and pain potion. He uncorked them and fed them to Harry one at a time.
“They are both on the mend. They’ve been staying over at Ron and Hermione’s. Thank Merlin for the two of them.”
“Our magic is working, but not to get us out.” Draco's fingers flicked at a piece of lint on the blanket that they'd had to put a heating charm on twice already.
Harry smiled and carefully removed himself from Teddy, who merely coughed a couple of times and rolled over, falling back into a deep sleep. Harry blinked for a moment, swallowing. His throat hurt. Draco handed him a mug of warm tea and took a few sips.
“Expecto Patronum!” Harry sent his stag out through the window, willing it to get to Ron or Hermione quickly. “Alright,” he said turning back to Draco who was still sat on the floor. “What do you have in your bag that we could transfigure to make this place more comfortable?”
“Please! Can't I go with him? I'm not that sick. I'll stay out of your way! I have to be with him!” His heartbeat continued to rev up and he could hear rushing in his years. A Healer who Draco didn't see to his right grasped his chin and held a potion vial to his mouth, knocking the contents of it down his throat. He was only able to yell out one final remark before his world closed into darkness.
“Good thinking. Did Teddy wake up with it? What are his symptoms?”
Harry pulled his arm from Draco’s grasp.
“Potter...” A rough voice called, prying Harry from sleep far too soon. “Come on Harry, wake up for me.” Harry tried to open his eyes, but it was too difficult. His entire body felt like it was too heavy for him to bear.
Harry nodded, hesitantly, sniffing. “What time is it?”
Finally admitting defeat, Harry spelled some wards to wake him if anyone approached the cell, or if they received word from the office. His robes on the window were only doing so much to keep the cold away, and he was wary of putting up another heating charm with Draco's rising fever. In the end, he decided on placing a personal warming charm on the sweater he was wearing. Draco's sweater. Which smelled like him, as did the blanket and pillows, and Draco himself, who lay not a foot from Harry. For all the times' Harry had fantasized about the first time he and Draco might share a bed, this was not what he'd envisioned. He rolled over to face the blonde and saw that his brow was furrowed tightly in his sleep. Another nightmare, Harry supposed. He knew Draco had them regularly. Harry reached out from under the blanket and took Draco's hand into his, his thumb rubbing small circles onto the man's palm in an attempt to calm him. The repetitive motion relaxed Harry, and he soon drifted off to sleep, his hand still entwined with Draco's.
“Oh. Well, can you stay with me until I fall asleep?”
“Do we know what happened? Why they did it? What was going on at that manor in Scotland?
“Yeah, Yeah.” Harry teased, “Thanks Healer Malfoy.” Harry took another long, soothing sip of tea. “Mmm, thanks for this”.
“Here, drink some more water.” Draco picked his wand up from the covers of the bed and conjured Teddy a small glass of water. “Are you hungry? He mentioned with a smile.
“No, you ungrateful little brat!” Petunia snapped at him. “After all we’ve done for you, are you really too lazy to complete a few simple tasks?”
Several hours later, Draco was pacing the length of the hallway, with Scorpius on his hip. Thankfully the baby’s fever hadn’t gone up, and although he was obviously uncomfortable, his body was fighting the virus normally. Teddy had been up for a while reading a storybook, but after taking a few potions, Draco settled him back to his own little bed where he eventually fell back asleep, which Draco was glad for. The boy needed his rest.
“Everything okay?” she replied, entering the room.
Harry turned away from the food he was preparing on the stove. “How’s Ted?”
Harry stopped walking and blinked for a moment. What had he gotten up to go do? His mind went blank as he was hit with a sudden wave of dizziness. Strong arms suddenly reached out to steady him.
“And if something happens to him?”
‘So late!’ He thought.
. . . . . . . . . .
“Promise me,” Harry continued, “Promise me you won't let them take me away.”
“I’d rather be worried like a normal husband than be left guessing when you are about to be on your deathbed.”
“That’s it?” Draco chuckled. “Come on, one more baby sip?”
Go lay down in bed with him for a few hours and don’t overexert yourselves?
“I wonder who he caught it from this time,” Ron said. “I haven't heard of anything going around the office for at least two weeks I think.” Ron was Head Auror, so he was always informed of all the office gossip. He often warned Malfoy when someone in the department called out sick.
“Please,” Draco whispered, begging, although to who, he didn't know. “Please let him be okay. Please let us get out here soon.”
“What's the status of Patient A?”
“Closet in the downstairs bathroom.”
“...Shit.”
“Hey, Teddy. You’ve got a really high fever right now. We’ve got to cool you down.”
“I don't even know anymore. We've been so worried.”
“Patient B is still clocking in at a temperature of 39.8 though. He's burning through the fever-reducing potion.”
“Ronald!”
* * * * * * *
“What? No, Harry. I'm sorry! I'm the one you caught this from.”
“Sorry,” Draco mumbled. “Headache.”
“Yes, of course, dear. Anytime. You take care of yourself.” Narcissa glanced at him knowingly before appariting away.
Harry stared back into the mirror, admiring his handiwork. The glamours gave him a lively, healthy-looking complexion. Harry swallowed roughly before heading downstairs to make dinner for him and Draco.
“Normal headache or coming down with the plague headache?”
“I’m alright,” he choked out.
“Harry, I love you. You aren’t a burden. You aren’t with the Dursley’s anymore.” He squeezed Harry’s hand. “We all cherish you.” Draco pointed to a corner of the room where there were cards and piles of sweets. “You’ve had so many visitors in the past few days.”
“Oh. Well I wouldn't want us to catch that,” Harry laughed, and the sound of it took Draco's breath away.
Although Harry could hear Teddy calling him, it sounded as though he was a million miles away. Harry felt the hot weight of his baby lift off of his chest, and found that he could suddenly breathe again. He tried to take a deep breath in, but instead began coughing and choking up phlegm. When he had finally succeeded in forcing his eyes open, he squinted over at Teddy, who was busy soothing a crying, sick Scorpius. Harry’s stomach lurched dangerously.
Petunia so was busy nursing her little Dudlykins back to health, but the housework still needed to be maintained. Fast forward three days and little Harry was dragging his feet as he tried to accomplish the overwhelming amount of tasks he was told to do. Uncle Vernon had threatened that it better all be done before he got home from work or... well, Harry didn’t want to think of what would happen. But Harry was feeling ill himself.
“No? You love it there.”
* * * * * * *
“You wanna fill me in on why we’re here this time?”
‘And so, the game begins,’ he thought. ‘I just hope I can find someone to cover the apothecary. No way am I going to be able to go to work this week if Harry is sick too.’
Draco looked down a Harry with a smile, holding him close. Even an ounce of the man's usual sarcasm put his heart at ease, though his shallow breathing was sounding increasingly labored.
. . . . . . . . . .
He climbed the stairs to Dudley’s room and knocked on the door. “Aunt Petunia,” Harry sniffed, “I don’t feel so good.”
It was Draco. He was home and... oh no. Draco was home. Harry’s fevered mind began to panic. Draco would be able to tell that he was really sick, and he would worry. Harry had been trying so hard, and he didn’t want to be a burden. He didn’t want to go back to his cupboard.
“I had a lot of tea.”
About an hour later, he was ushering Teddy back into a freshly made bed. It took a while, but he was finally able to lower the boy’s fever with the cool water. After offering Teddy a sip of juice and tucking him back in bed, Harry decided that crawling in with him for a moment wouldn’t hurt. He laid there for a few moments, listening to Teddy’s breathing even out, and for a moment he felt himself drifting as well. That is until he felt his wards shift and heard a knock at the front door.
“Hermione, thank god. I’m surprised you’re home.”
“Would it be alright with you if I rest my eyes for a bit?” Draco asked, his voice sounding incredibly scratchy, probably from the cold air. He had half a mind to be embarrassed about it, but Harry had seen him ill enough times that it hardly made a difference anymore.
Draco frowned. Harry got sick so fast, which made Draco anxious. If it weren't for him and his useless immune system, Harry wouldn't have even gotten sick like this in the first place. He was angry at himself, at his body. He was angry at Harry's good for nothing relatives.
Draco realized dejectedly that he should have taken his conversation with his mother more seriously. Sighing gently, he looked at his oldest son’s glassy eyes. “Everyone’s going be fine, we all just need some rest.”
Teddy slowly opened his eyes.
“Potter, don't. You're going to freeze.“
Draco stripped off his damp robes, laying them on the back of the kitchen chair. Aside from the whistling kettle, the house was unusually quiet. Grabbing two mugs from the cupboard, he began preparing tea for himself and Harry, before going upstairs to look for his family.
“I thought I could handle it, Draco. I didn’t want to be a burden.”
“The Dursleys.”
“Draco, my relatives never took me to any muggle doctors, let alone a wizarding one!”
They were huddled together under Draco's blanket, sitting against the wall furthest from the window, but no matter where they were in the little cell, the walls and floor felt cold and damp against them. It was dark outside, but Draco spelled an orb of light onto the ceiling as a makeshift lamp with a spell Harry wasn't familiar with. They had been there for three hours, and each passing hour left Draco feeling marginally sicker. His head felt heavy, and he leaned sideways to rest it on Harry's shoulder. Of course, Harry let him. This was as close to cuddling as they'd ever done.
“Mr. Malfoy, do you have any idea who you might have caught Dragon Pox from? Who you came in contact with before you began experiencing symptoms?”
“Papa, wake up.”
“As in, like, 2 days before Teddy got sick?” Draco asked incredulously.
Draco was back to pacing the hallway when Hermione returned from tucking Teddy back in bed.
Teddy reluctantly took one more sip of the water before handing the glass back to Draco, who set it on the bedside table.
“Papa’s gonna be okay. He’s sleeping now. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?”
“Well, get up then. We're meeting Ron and Hermione in the cafeteria.” Draco made a face.
“Papa!”
“You wish.”
“So go into work early tomorrow and restock all the potions you will need for a few days. Then Blaise can just sell things.”
“I have good friends,” he agreed, and then after a moment of thought he asked, “We're friends, right Draco?”
Harry made a low sound of sympathy and handed Draco the cool goblet of water. He ran a hand through his hair again, wondering what was taking the Aurors so long to find them. He laid a hand across Draco's brow, which made the man flinch. “You're pretty warm, do you want to take a fever reducer?”
“I’m not going to listen to anything a bloody death eater wannabe has to say.”
“No, Aunt Petunia, but-“
“Look out, Ted. I’m coming through”.
“But just so you know, Potter,” Draco said, poking the brunette jokingly in the ribs, “if you ever scare me like this again, I swear I’ll kill you myself.”
“Not from you, Malfoy! Are you insane? Get the fuck out!”
Although Draco was always awake much before Harry so he could get to work, Harry usually woke fairly early to tend to Scorpius. Harry realized that he had slept the whole night on the couch in his clothes and that at some point Draco must’ve covered him with several warm blankets. Harry wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and curl back into the blankets, but he had to go check on Teddy. Groaning, Harry sat up. He was not feeling well at all. His throat hurt as if he’d been coughing all night, although he knows that if he had been, Draco never would have left.
The men left Kingsley's office and walked back to theirs. As expected, Draco set off quickly to gather random supplies in his brown leather messenger bag.  He brought it with him whenever they went out into the field, and Harry knew it was filled with everything from emergency potions, extra clothes, and even some snacks.
“But did you ever catch the bastards?”
“Ugh... My nose feels like its burning.” Draco moaned, rubbing a hand over his face once again and flopping back down ungracefully onto the pillows. His hand rested over his eyes, and it was a pitiful sight.
“I did?”
Draco shifted them both so that he was lounging next to Harry on the hospital bed. He reached for his husband’s hand, and Harry sniffed once and let his head fall onto Draco’s shoulder.
“The tavern? Yes! I am a regular customer there. Potter and I went together last Friday to celebrate our closing a major case.”
Draco kneeled down in front of the bedroom fireplace and tried firecalling Hermione at her office in the Department of Mysteries, but there was no answer. She must be home then. Draco hoped that their family wasn’t as sick as his was right now. He tried their house.
“Woah, okay Harry. Easy.”
Hermione handed Draco the messenger bag he’d packed for Harry, which he slung over his shoulder. “Okay Har. I’m going to side-along you to St. Mungo’s. Can you stand?”
He could hear Draco's relieved breath. “Come on Potter. Up.”
“Yeah. Thanks, Hermione. I don't know what I’d do without you.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“I know, sweets. I know you aren’t feeling well. I wish I could make things better for you. Just calm down, and you’ll feel better.” He mumbled nonsensically, pausing to let out a few coughs that rattled in his chest.
“You're okay?” His voice sounded awful.
Draco’s brow furrowed in concern. “Okay. We are going to get you straightened out. Are you hungry at all? Nana sent us some sick-day soup for you.”
Even if the spell was glitching, Harry did not want to take chances with such a high temp. He accio’d a fever reducer from Draco’s potion cabinet and conjured a washcloth and a bowl of cool water. Harry stifled a coughing fit of his own and felt his lungs burn in retaliation. Now was not the time. Harry brushed the cool wet cloth across Teddy’s head and neck and Teddy’s eyes blinked up at him.
"Er, yes, but-"
Harry found it difficult to let go. "We're blokes," he stated. "They could have scattered something more manly across the bed."
"Aw, do we have to?" whined one as Blaise led them to the cupboard to fetch their coats.
Harry saved his breath for shagging. Free now to seek his own pleasure, he did so with gusto. In mere moments, he was shouting out loud as he peaked.
After having sex and breakfast with Harry the following morning, Draco bade his partner goodbye and took his precious new book to show it to Hermione. She treated it as reverently as Draco did, turning the pages carefully and exclaiming in delight over each new illustration that was revealed.
Harry dropped forward, his chest meeting Draco's back and his hands coming to rest next to Draco's arms on the pallet. It felt strangely intimate, and Draco squirmed again.
"I have a better idea," said Draco. "Let's both go up to bed, and we can clean up this disaster in the morning."
Harry began to tick items off on his fingers, even though Hermione couldn't see him. "He gets sick two or three mornings a week, some foods turn him right off, he's moody...well, more so than usual, and his...ahem...his nipples are sensitive."
"You are quite the jester, Harry." Draco took another sip of tea and sighed in appreciation. "Mm, just the way I like it."
"Malfoy, thank Godric you're here."
Minerva nodded. "Yes, the Muggles will ask for your surname," she said. "We in Hogsmeade don't put stock in such, but they will expect it. We have found the most simple solution is to use our dragons' names. As a queen's rider, you have several options," Minerva continued. "You may add Salzaria's name to your own, you may use the name of your partner's dragon, or you could choose to take the name of your father's dragon."
“I will touch you, my little prince, of that you can be sure. I will touch every inch of you, I will hold you, I will thrill you, and I will kiss you until you’re breathless, begging me for more. I’ll take such good care of you, my little prince, my sweet, precious boy.”
“Nope. How about a Gin and Tonic without the gin?”
He also told Draco to look at him, and when Draco’s forced his eyes to open fully, an incredible and intense jolt zapped through Harry, pulling a long groan from the depths of his belly. He gripped Draco’s leg hard enough to bruise, and thrust into him, claiming all of that tight and narrow passage for himself.
At this moment in time, Draco’s body language spoke volumes. He was restless and unable to remain calm and composed. So far, Harry had watched him pace up and down, weaving his way between the backstage staff like a caged animal desperately looking for a hidden escape route.
“I do have a ring for you; it’s at home in my nightstand.”
“A moment of your time, if you please?”
Malcolm shrugged.
Harry squeezed his wrists tightly.
“Yes. My great-great-grandmother once witnessed a unicorn birth. When a unicorn foal is born, it is pure gold in colour and looks strikingly similar to a horse.”
Harry smiled.
“We’re good the way we are, aren’t we?” he asked quietly. “It’s a solid deal.”
Lily grinned.
Yes, he’d seen wolves before, and yes, he’d also seen werewolves before, but always from a safe distance and not up close and personal. So far, he’d also always had additional protection, be that in the form of trained healers, Aurors, or special protective gear. Right now, all he had was his wand. There was literally nowhere for him to hide. Well, there was the small space under his desk, but that wasn’t an especially useful option. Running also wasn’t something he could consider since Potter was much closer to the door than he was. Still, though, there was a wilful and headstrong part of Draco that tried its hardest to get him to swallow his fear. It reminded Draco that Potter, despite being a werewolf, wasn’t out to kill him. Or at least Draco fervently hoped that Potter bore him no ill will.
Caleb grinned, then threw an arm around his shoulder, and half sliding off his stool, Harry let his friend pull him into a one-armed hug.
“Brass,” Malfoy countered.
“I got it for you, a reminder of your first ever shift.”
, yes, please, Sir, please.”
Draco crooked an eyebrow at him and smirked.
“You look strangely sexy with your mouth full of toothpaste.”
The sound of the front door falling closed behind him seemed, somehow, louder than it had ever before, and when the wards activated in response to it, Draco shuddered at the sudden onslaught of the powerful magic. He felt rather than heard the clicking of the lock, and in order not to let anticipation overwhelm him, he straightened up, slightly shifting his body weight from his left foot to the right as he did so.
“That’s good because I’m not letting you leave this table until you’ve eaten so much that you’ve got a round belly to prove it.”
Draco mirrored it.
Draco gasped.
“Fascinating, dear,” she said, with a singsong voice.
Instead of taking a moment and offering up an explanation, Draco surprised him further by simply leaning down and capturing his lips in a kiss.
Most of the room’s furniture was covered with shiny, high-quality black satin sheets, instinctively leading Draco to believe that Harry hadn’t brought him up to the room for a scene. Several old, imposing silver candle-holders stood dotted around the place, filled with thick white candles. Surrounded by all the blackness, the warm flicker of the flames was an arc of brilliant gold. Without a draft to disturb them, the tiny fires burnt steadily. Their peacefulness filled Draco with a sense of calmness, and he continued to take in the room.
“I told you that I’d get you. I never lie, Malfoy, you should know that.”
Draco felt the loss like a stinging blow to his arse, but he pressed his lips together and forced himself not to beg, not to ask for more affection, not just yet anyway.
“I promise I won’t go blabbing.”
“I’ve got you, my little prince, I’m right here.”
“Darling, I’ve told him where to shove it more times than I care to remember.”
“I pestered him about making an honest man out of you the night of Arthur’s and my wedding anniversary, you know,” she said.
That was Harry’s speciality; he knew how to fuck with his mind without even consciously doing so. Draco wanted those prickly hairs to scratch him in his most intimate places, leaving behind red marks and a distinctive and thrilling sort of pain. He’d no doubt that Harry would eventually give him what he desired but Draco had no intention of pushing Harry into something he wasn’t quite ready for. Still, the fantasy alone was enough to lead to a heavy ache deep in the centre of his groin, but he wasn’t selfish enough to demand sexual intimacy when Harry wasn’t in the right headspace for it. It went against everything their relationship represented and he believed in.
He chuckled softly under his breath and making his way through the crowd of people, he pulled Draco along with him to a free two-seater sofa that offered an excellent view of the play space. He sat down, sank back into the covers, and throwing one leg over the other, he patted the empty space next to him.
Taking a deep breath, Draco prepared himself to answer.
“You fuck―”
“No, Sir,” he breathed.
Even after all this time, it was a natural reaction; it was Draco’s way of preserving himself.
He watched as Harry dragged the door to the holding cells open and roughly shoved him inside. Thrust forward by the momentum, he stumbled a few steps ahead, then found his balance and turning around, he ran towards the door, but Harry slammed it closed and locked it with an ordinary Muggle key.
It was pleasantly warm inside the winter garden. The late morning winter sun shone rather brightly through the massive windows and the roof, providing the many plants, which filled the spacious conservatory, with much-loved light. All around them were signs of the ebullience of spring, the maturity of summer, and even the majesty of autumn’s colourful coat. Each time, Harry ventured inside the Manor’s winter garden, he always felt awed by its elegance and symmetry. Each pathway, evergreen, pergola, deciduous tree, and large shrub had been planted in an effective and well thought out manner, and despite the effort that had gone into the design of the garden nothing looked forced or fake.
“I missed you too, little man,” Harry said.
Harry shook his head.
Harry casually shook his head no.
There was still not the slightest hint of hesitancy in his eyes and Harry watched, with the greatest admiration, and a chest burning with love, as Draco moved, kneeled beside him, then draped himself all over his thighs, exposing his perfect, milky-white behind to him.
Harry chuckled.
“A Dominant should always learn the basics, true, but there’s no need for you to outright dismiss a somewhat inexperienced Dom. As long as they are open and honest about their inexperience and are willing to learn, I’d say go for it. Besides, the start of any new relationship, especially a kinky one, will always be filled with two people trying to get used to each other and learning how to behave around each other.”
He loved it when Draco thanked him, even more so when he did so without having been asked to do so.
Harry smiled.
There was something about Draco’s playful snide that got him every time. It was also part of the reason why he hardly ever told Draco to rein in his sass.
Draco flushed and gave him a shy smile.
Draco only realised exactly how high-pitched his exclamation had been when both Harry and his mother placed their hands above their ears and grimaced. Biting down hard on his tongue, Draco swallowed his next remark and this time he didn’t hold back. He glowered at Harry and defiantly crossed his arms over his chest.
As such, he opened his mouth, and he made a feeble attempt to protest, but before he managed to utter the first syllable, Draco shook his head, delicately shutting him up. It was like he’d taken a leaf out of their playtime rulebook, and Harry was thoroughly amused that Draco was trying to use his own weapons against him.
Draco swallowed hard.
“Ah, but I do know, my little prince. I know exactly how amazing this feels.”
Harry felt more content than he’d done since before their epic roleplay scene and after the better part of an hour, he was so stuffed full of food that he groaned, leant back in his wicker chair, closed his eyes, and placing his hands on top of his stomach, he promptly fell asleep.
Less than ten minutes later, Draco leant against the kitchen worktop and sipped on a double espresso. He finished it quickly enough and cleaning the small cup, he left it out to dry, then headed back into the living room to check on Teddy. He was still sleeping peacefully and smiling down at him, Draco nodded to himself, turned on his heel and returned to the hallway to take his shoes off.
Harry smiled and turning his attention back to ‘Tom’, he opted for a bit of a daredevil move. He moved as close to the edge of the mire-free safe space, he and Draco occupied, weighed up his options and deciding that jumping across the swamp was out of the question, he raised his wand up and cast a spell that conjured a sturdy vine.
Draco lifted his head, turned it slowly, and focusing on him, he held his gaze for a few moments, then averted his eyes and looked down at their linked hands.
Draco inhaled sharply and just as he did, Harry squeezed and twisted his left nipple. The spell intensified the pressure, and the pain and Draco gasped and arched his back a little. He didn't draw away from the exquisite sensations of pain but rather pushed into it, wordlessly showing Harry that he wanted more, craved to remain on that sweet, fine line that ran between pain and pleasure, a line that was rapidly blurring and slowly disappearing altogether.
It was now Draco’s turn to furrow his brows.
The creases in his forehead were so deep that he was utterly convinced that, by the end of the day, they’d become a permanent addition to his facial features.
Sure, there were spells that kept sleeves rolled up and collars upright, but the perfection with which Draco’s suits complimented his every move, well, there was no magic for that. This, Harry concluded, was solely down to the utterly incredible skills of Draco’s tailor, no doubt the best one in Britain, France, or perhaps even the entire world.
When he couldn’t see much more than a blurry mess, he remembered that he wasn’t wearing his glasses.
He gave a short nod to answer in the affirmative.
Draco didn’t immediately oblige.
Charlie’s praise charmed a smile onto Liam’s face, and when he wrapped his arm around his slave and pulled him into a loving embrace, Liam melted into it.
With that, Draco strode out of the Auror Department’s tearoom and headed down the corridor. He took a left at the end of it, walked about halfway, then stopped in front of the door to his and Potter’s office. Coffee cup still in hand, he took a sip, then reached out and turned the knob. He pushed the door open to find Potter flat on his back on their exquisite black three-seat leather sofa. He hadn’t bothered taking off his robes or Auror-issued dragonhide boots and whooshing his hand, Draco voiced his disapproval with a loud tsk and used magic to push Harry’s manky boots off the sofa.
“That’s so much better, Malfoy. In society, manners are the be-all and end-all. Now, I’m feeling quite inquisitive. How you’re going to explain away the fact that you repeatedly insulted the Head of the Auror Department?”
“I’m not perfect, I just happen to be head over heels in love with you. Come on, I’ll take you home and pamper you like you’ve never been pampered before.”
Harry smiled.
“I need a bit of help.”
“I know you are, my little prince.”
“Is there anything else you would like, my sweet little prince?”
“Might be worth an exclusive with the Prophet.”
Harry stopped for a moment to check in with Draco, and leaning forward, he braced himself on his right hand and looked down at Draco, who looked up at him and gave him a breathless nod.
“I’m not giving you a blowjob, Malfoy! You’re such filth.”
, you drive me crazy. I want to keep you for all eternity. May I?”
For the first three months, they’d met exclusively at munches, then Roísín had asked whether it might be appropriate for them to meet at her favourite coffee shop. Draco had turned to him for advice then, and Harry still fondly remembered giving him the green light, teasingly instructing him to enjoy himself.
Harry smiled.
According to Shacklebolt, the ministry thought Harry to be all these things. While he’d certainly proved his worth as an Auror, the mere thought of those pompous words had made Harry want to roll his eyes, but he knew better than to do so in the middle of a crucial interdepartmental meeting. Despite their long-standing friendship, Shacklebolt, as the Minister for Magic, had to act a certain way in public and at official functions.
Harry praised Draco’s obedience and stepping around him, he stood directly in front of him and brought his hand up to caress Draco’s cheek.
Draco melted against him, and Harry engulfed him in a bone-crushing embrace that knocked whatever tiny amount of air, Draco still had left at the bottom of his lungs, straight out of him.
He felt Harry loosen his hold on his wrists and turned his head from side to side to try and show Harry that he didn’t want him to do that. Not just yet. He didn’t feel ready.
Harry sighed.
Draco laughed.
After granting his son a short respite, he picked Scorpius off the bed, threw him over his shoulder and even though Scorpius protested and tried to smack his backside, Draco ignored his son’s serious objections. He made his way across his bedroom and into his walk-in wardrobe. Once there, he put Scorpius down and laughed when his son placed his hands on his hips and gave him an icy glare.
Applying a bit more pressure to Draco’s tongue, Harry combed his fingers through Draco’s hair, then grabbed a fistful of it. He didn’t pull it or hurt Draco in any way, shape, or form, but the fact that he’d gagged Draco and that his hand was right there in his hair, controlling him, had the desired effect.
“Always,” he said with a smile.
Draco’s throat tightened, and every nerve ending in his body sent signs of distress to his brain which felt like it had lid up like Christmas Tree.
“Kiss my arse, Potter.”
“I thought you might,” she said.
“I’m not most wizards,” he said.
“Yes, that’s the one night of the month I can’t control it. A couple of days before the full moon the urge to shift is so intense that I need to shift at least once a day to appease the werewolf inside me and during a full moon I have no control over it at all, none. It just happens. I shift and that is that.”
“You know damn well that’s not what I mean.”
“I know you will,” he said, “and I can’t wait for the day you and Harry exchange your wedding vows.”
Draco shivered.
Draco nodded.
Potter’s sudden bout of humour―while somewhat ill-placed―was impossible to ignore. It simply got to him, wormed its way underneath his skin and stayed there. He laughed for a good minute or two, then managed to calm himself and waving his hand he spelt a blotch of ink off the parchment.
“That’s a bit of a bombshell,” he mumbled.
Caleb smiled.
Theirs was a TPE relationship which meant that Charlie called the shots, all of them. He had Liam’s full and written consent to do so.
Harry laughed.
“I think you look a bit like Nana Tonks cousin, Sirius, with that beard,” Teddy said.
Teddy was due to start his magical education at Hogwarts next year, and Draco knew for a fact that Harry hated the idea of accompanying his godson to King’s Cross and putting him onto the Hogwarts Express. Teddy living with his grandmother and visiting every other weekend was one thing, Teddy spending most of the year up in Scotland roaming about the corridors of a medieval castle and learning how to wield a wand was a different thing altogether.
“A few,” he said, “not about this, though.”
Draco lifted his head again.
The connection between them was charged with so much emotion that Harry's heart swelled to the point that it felt like it might just have to stop beating.
Draco smiled.
“Missed you,
Selly
Harry smiled.
Harry forced the question out between gritted teeth.
“Well, tell me, my little prince.”
Not wanting to crowd Draco and allow him his own private space, Charlie withdrew his hands and drank a little more tea.
“I am. I’m not entirely sure yet what exactly happened, but I’m on my way to Harry’s place. I’m just around the corner, actually. Draco called me in tears earlier. I’ve no idea why he broke down before he could tell me.”
Scorpius nodded vigorously.
“I don’t know. I still don’t really understand this whole sub drop thing. I’ve dropped after a simple spanking before. If you ask me, this whole crash and burn thing seems to have a mind of its own. It hits you when you least expect it, but when you think it’ll most definitely happen, it doesn’t.”
Draco swallowed and the pressure of Harry’s thumb against his tongue intensified. He wanted to ask about Harry’s intentions, but he also rather enjoyed the possessive way, Harry had robbed him of his ability to speak freely.
Harry flashed him a positively devilish and wicked smile.
Caleb chuckled.
“May your heart always be filled with the knowledge that you are never alone in this life, and the reassurance that you’ll always be cared for, cherished, loved, protected, desired, wanted, and needed. Sir's right here with you and will be for as long as you, my little prince, want me to be, preferably for all eternity. While, as your Dominant, I may not always walk beside you, let me assure you that I won't take a single step without knowing that you'll follow me. I promise you that I’ll never hurt your heart and none of the marks I place on you will ever be permanent. Any pain you receive from me shall be because you sincerely desire it. It shall always be consensual and given to you with love, never hate and never in anger. I wish to bind our souls, to have us walk this earth together, as one. You are mine, little prince, and I love you.”
Draco’s encouragement only served to ignite his burning desire.
“Only for you.”
died on the tip of his tongue.
Harry laughed.
A few seconds later, the swirling stopped, and Draco found himself roughly pushed into a slightly uncomfortable wooden chair. The thin chains around his wrists disappeared but, in its place, leather restraints slithered around his wrists and ankles, securing him to the chair, and a minute or so later, the strange blindfold fell away, and he could both hear and see once more.
The reprimand cut through the pain and the haze, and Draco instantly corrected himself.
He continued to tease every inch of Draco’s arse and the back of his thighs with his fingertips and delighted in all the different tiny sounds Draco made. They were heaven on earth to listen to, and Harry drowned in them. He was utterly lost in the moment, thoroughly enjoying the gift Draco had just given him.
Sucking Harry off and turned him on even more and his cock felt like it was about to explode. His balls were tight, and he was desperate, but he knew that there was no point to ask Harry to allow him to come, he knew the answer already.
By the end of their time at the fair, Harry had consumed decidedly too much coffee. He had been far too hyper to sleep. As a direct result of that, he’d stayed up until the early hours of the morning, hunched over his laptop, furiously typing away on his latest novel. Draco couldn’t help but chuckle at the memory of that night. He’d been thoroughly exhausted but hadn’t been able to stop himself, and instead of being sensible and going to bed, he’d stood in the doorframe to Harry’s study, watching him write.
“Why are you so forgiving?”
“I nearly died that night, I think. The pain was absolutely excruciating. My memories of that night are a bit hazy, but I think I somehow transformed back into my human form and managed to produce a Patronus to send for help. Ron and Hermione rescued me. They took me to Bill and Fleur’s place, patched me up, and― and, well, there’s isn’t really any and.”
“Say it,” he whispered again.
“The tattoos on my back, yes.”
“You don’t scare me, Draco Malfoy. Never have, never will. Go help my boy make us some coffee and tea, he asked you rather nicely, don’t you think?”
“How tough?” he asked.
Charlie insists, and Harry knows better than to turn him down and so he shrugs and motions for Charlie to proceed, which seems to make him very happy, indeed. Harry doesn’t quite understand what sort of pleasure Charlie gets out of setting him up with various wizards and witches, but he thinks, that perhaps, this is Charlie’s way of dealing with the stress of his own job and that makes Harry even more unwilling to tell him to just give it a rest. He supposes that his
Harry laughed.
Being waited on absolutely had its advantages and Harry wasn’t about to deny his little prince the chance to take care of him. As much as he loved doting on Draco, and making him feel loved and cared for, he also thoroughly enjoyed it when Draco reciprocated and showered him with love. His little prince usually did it through taking care of things around the house, ensuring everything was in order, and either cooking or buying delicious meals, and Harry appreciated it wholeheartedly.
Draco tried his best to digest the unexpected surprise but found himself distracted when Stefan and Liam joined Harry, him, Caleb, and Charlie on stage. Stefan handed him a genuinely massive bouquet of deep red long-stemmed roses.
Harry’s words continued in his ear, and even though Harry had fallen silent, Draco could still feel his warm breath on the side of his neck, his cheek, and the outer shell of his ear.
George had volunteered to book a band and DJ. He’d also organised the gifts for the guests, although Harry highly suspected that Angelina had banned any and all of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes’ stock from making it into the gift bags.
As a result, warm sunshine kept flooding through the large floor-length windows, and it was pleasantly cosy inside the room.
“If you want a couple of lashes that actually hurt, I’d be only too happy to supply this later tonight.”
Conscious of the time, Harry decided to postpone revelling in the memories of the milestones of his and Draco’s relationship. Instead, he got to his feet and stretched luxuriously, raising his arms far above his head and thoroughly loosening his muscles.
A nagging little voice tried telling him that he’d pay bitterly for his cheek, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop.
“Dominance in another person will call out to you ― and you will respond in a way that comes naturally. It’s not something that can be learnt, or faked ― it can be beaten into a person via abuse, or endured through sheer self-control, but not learnt. Submission will either come naturally ― because it makes you happy, it makes you wet, it excites the hell out of you ― or it won't. When a Dominant grabs you by the hair, you will fall to your knees because it seems the natural thing to do, because usually you’ve dreamt and fantasised about this for years, and because you want very badly to be on your knees with someone’s fist wrapped around a hank of your hair.”
After what felt like hours of teasing, Harry finally slipped one finger into him and pushed it all the way inside. He crooked it, pressed it against Draco’s prostate and Draco groaned.
“Draco is very level-headed when it comes to his job. I think we can agree that he’s entitled to let me take care of the rest.”
Harry had, without the use of magic, quite expertly whipped both ends of the rope to ensure it wouldn’t fall apart, and Draco dug the fingernail of his index finger into the inconspicuous black whipping.
“Ah, yes, the predicament of being completely naked, dressed only in my ropes, and brimming with excitement, eh? Well, we can’t have you freezing, can we now, my precious little prince?”
Draco shuddered, then frowned.
Harry reached out, ran his fingers through Draco’s hair and pulled him into a slow kiss.
All my love,
It truly was a stark contrast, and one Draco regularly marvelled at. Harry preferred rules and order. He wanted obedience. But when it came to his paperwork, Harry was entirely capable of literally burying himself up to his neck in case files and interrogation reports.
Stopping his musings about Harry’s and his relationship from taking over, Draco focused back on the conversation.
“Mine, all mine,” he whispered.
Harry frowned.
“I thought so too. Turns out my opening statement was so persuasive that the defendant went against his barrister’s advice and pleaded guilty. We had a verdict in less than an hour. Think it was my fastest trial yet.”
Harry curled the fingers of his left hand up tightly, clenching them into a fist, though not because he was angry, but because the sweet undertone of Malfoy’s question wreaked havoc with his emotions.
Love,
“Yes, Sir.”
Draco smoothed out his elegant black prosecutor’s robes, reached for his Eagle feather quill and opened the topmost file on his desk. He glanced at his notes, then lifted his head and addressed the judges in front of him, and after a short speech, he turned his head slightly to the right.
Harry clicked his tongue and slowly stroked his cock, twisting his fist around it as he moved it up and down.
“It’s charmed,” he whispered, staring at Harry with his eyes open wide.
Harry seated himself on the edge of the bed and grinned.
, Harry thought bitterly.
“That same day. I know Harry’s moods. I know what he’s like when he’s grumpy. It never lasts long. He doesn’t avoid problems or pretends they don’t exist; he fixes them. We talk, we communicate, we tell each other stuff. He always gets through to me, and even though he always seems so together and like absolutely nothing can rattle him, he’s only human, and he has his moments too. But like I said; usually we talk about things, so naturally that’s what I tried to do, and I just couldn’t get through to him. It was like he heard me talk but didn’t listen. I can’t explain it.”
He reached out, took Draco’s hand, and placed it between his own two hands, effectively sandwiching it.
Feeling thoroughly alive and free from all of life’s constraints, Harry filled his entire chest with as much air as he could and parted his thick black lips to let out a celebratory roar. It escaped him in the form of a loud and piercing howl, vibrating through the thicket all around him, and running faster still, Harry flew over the ground, fearlessly disappearing into the uncharted, untamed belly of the Forbidden Forest. It felt as though his large paws barely touched the ground, but the sensitive pads on the underside of his feet relished in the softness of the earth beneath him.
He reached for his treacle tart, a spoon, and the bowl of custard and placed everything in front of him.
“I don’t want you in any way. The only one I want is presently sulking inside your cottage.”
, and Harry could tell he was trying his hardest to fight back the urge to cry.
Eventually, he found the resolve to speak, and taking a deep breath, he stopped worrying his bottom lip.
Charlie nodded.
The wolf in him growled in approval and lest he gave himself away, Harry bit back a smug grin.
After a while, and when he had enough, Harry pulled away, and sitting back down on the chair, he unceremoniously tucked his now spent cock back inside his trousers, zipped them up, fiddled with the button and fastened his belt.
Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, then along the side of his arms, and as he did so, his other hand worked to check on the ropes, the ties, and the knots. He worked his way along Draco’s body, and once he’d reached his left calf, Harry took the free rope, ran it over the bamboo rod and applied some tension. So much that Draco’s left leg was inches away from hugging the hardpoint. He secured it, ran his hand along Draco’s leg, felt the taut muscles flex underneath the palm of his hand, and gently squeezed Draco’s bum.
Ron grinned and willingly obliged, giving his wife exactly what she wanted.
Feeling privileged, Charlie treasured the chance to see Draco without all of his masks, and he rather liked this completely unguarded version of Draco. He was full of warmth and trust, and his willingness to be absolutely and completely honest was right there. It was precious.
“I suppose that's fair. But it's not my fault you're alarmingly pointy.” Harry smiled,  peering at him long enough to memorize the pallor of his skin. “I'm bringing you back soup,” he nodded, turning to leave their office. He heard Draco huff loudly at him as he walked away.
“I guess,” Harry replied, giving him a long, hard look.
Draco turned the corner, finally arriving at the apparition point, and apparited home. He emerged in his warm kitchen just in time to hear the tea kettle start whistling.
Meanwhile, Draco was scheming. In an overly exaggerated voice, he stated, “So I was thinking about tomorrow,” Draco started. “Normally I’d close the apothecary for a few days to help out around here, but I don’t know if that’s a good idea this time. There were so many mums who came in to buy potions for their families, I’d hate to not be there for them. They trust me, you know?”
“That’s so nice. But to be honest, all I want to do go home. I want to curl up in our bed with all three of my boys. And I want to have a bowl of your mother’s sick-day-soup.”
Draco inhaled sharply. Harry was so sick he didn’t even...remember?
Harry sat down on the edge of Teddy’s bed, brushing some damp curls off the young boy’s forehead. His forehead and cheeks felt warm to the touch, but Harry wasn’t sure if he should give him a fever reducer just yet. He remembered Draco telling him once that low fevers can be helpful in killing a virus. So instead, Harry just removed the heavy comforter off Teddy’s sleeping form and pushed it to the end of the bed. Teddy stirred, coughing a few times. Harry smiled down at the sleeping boy and decided it would be best to stay with Teddy, so he wearily pulled his legs up to rest properly on the bed, leaned his head against the backboard, and shut his eyes. He forgot all about his tea that was cooling in the kitchen, as well as the immunity booster Draco brought home.
Draco glanced down at the still sleeping Teddy. Normally, Draco loved catching a peek at Teddy when he was asleep, as it was one of the rare times his appearance was untouched and he truly looked like himself. But tonight, he looked white as a sheet. His dark hair was damp around the edges of his hairline, and there were bright pink blotches on both his cheeks. He didn’t like to see him looking so sick. Sure, Teddy was adopted, but the normally vibrant and loud boy was just as much Draco and Harry’s son as Scorpius was. Draco would do anything to keep him healthy and safe.
“Harry didn’t look fit enough to be taking care of my grandchildren on his own.”
“You still look tired.” Draco noticed. “Why don’t you go finish your nap in our bed? I will stay with Teddy”.
Finally, he watched as Hermione’s face appeared in the fire. Draco could see even through the flames that her normally wild hair was even frizzier at the moment.
“We tried! We already tried. There's no way out! We have to wait for help, and you need to sit back down before you collapse or something. You've barely eaten today.”
“Harry?”
Levitating behind Draco was a huge pot of homemade chicken noodle sick-day soup, a centuries-old Malfoy family recipe. Narcissa had asked the house elves to whip it up to moment Harry fire-called to tell her he needed her to take care of her darling grandson. It was the one thing that any Malfoy (or, Malfoy-Potter in this case) needed to recover from any sort of malady. A historic cure-all, from flu to heartbreak. And it was one of Draco’s favorites.
“Oh....um, I was nibbling too much while I was cooking”, Harry lied smoothly. Draco nodded, taking a bite.
Draco cast a charm to check Teddy’s temperature, which read 100.3. Not, great, but not terrible. Although he wanted to let the boy rest, he knew needed to wake up and get him to drink something. It would help keep his fever from worsening. Draco used Aguamenti to conjure fresh water in the glass on Teddy’s bedside table and then gently shook the boy’s shoulder.
Draco pulled back from Harry, leaving both hands to rest on his husband’s shoulders. “Think you can hold down the fort here for just a little longer? I want to pop over to the Manor for a bit. I brought home some Echinacea potion from work today, maybe that will help keep Scorpius from catching it. I took some this morning, but you should take some yourself. It’s in my coat pocket downstairs.”
Harry sat up and held Scorpius closer to himself. He had no idea how long they’d been resting for, but it felt it had been hours. Where was Draco?
‘I’m sorry. I just can’t do it. Can’t you ask someone else?”
“That can't be possible. Besides, we all had to provide proof of immunizations with our application to start Auror training.” Draco watched as Harry's face morphed from confusion to full-blown panic.
Harry sighed. “I sent Scorp to the Manor with your mother this afternoon. Teddy’s sick.”
Tears formed in Teddy’s eyes and he just stared at Draco, not understanding what was going on. To be honest, Draco didn’t understand much of it either. How could Harry remember the boys but not his own husband?
Down the hall, he could hear a few noisy Aurors discussing their plans for the weekend. Potter had invited Draco to join him at the Weasley's for Teddy's fifth birthday party on Saturday, and Draco was considering taking him up on the offer. Last time they'd been over at Andromeda's Teddy nearly talked his ear off about the party, and since the boy was his cousin, he really shouldn't miss it.
Given all their history, it had taken Ron a while to admit that Malfoy was a surprisingly good Auror. When Harry had first gotten paired up with him early on in Auror training, Ron cornered the blonde and grilled him on having Harry's back out in the field. He didn't trust the bloke, but surprisingly Malfoy had never once let him down. Against all odds, it quickly became obvious to the entire office that Harry and Draco were well suited to one another as partners, and eventually, as friends. No one could talk sense into Harry quite like Malfoy could, and Harry needed someone to keep him in line. As much as Ron admired Harry for his Gryffindor bravery, he had to admit that Malfoy helped Harry analyze situations instead of jumping right in and getting hurt. He taught him to be critical, to slow down, and take precautions.
“No, Hermione. It’s really bad. His fever is too high.”
It was cold. Unbearably cold. He was in at Privet Drive, and he couldn’t have been any more than nine years old; the same age as Teddy is now.
Draco buried his face in his hands. “Mhmm. Just don't feel so great.”
Draco sighed. “I'm all not that hungry,” he said earnestly. “And your nagging is driving me a bit mad. I promise you I'll eat when we get back, alright?”
“Fine, yes. That’ll do Pansy. Have fun with the Harpies.”
Draco could feel the green eyes boring into him, and he curled gracefully down into the transfigured mattress, adjusting the pillows and pulling the blanket up to his chin. His eyelids suddenly felt so heavy. “Will you sleep tonight?”
“I know.”
“I just hate it when Teddy is sick,” Harry mumbles into Draco’s shoulder. “And I’m worried about Scorpius, he’s just so little.”
“Harry, why don’t you lay down for a bit? I’m gonna get Scorp and Teddy settled, and then I’ll be back, okay?” Harry just looked up at him for a moment, dazed.
“Are you feeling any better than earlier?”
“Hey.” Draco said, walking in to stand behind Harry and wrapping his arms around the brunette’s waist. He looked at their reflections in the bathroom mirror. Harry looked tired. “Where are the boys?”
Harry winced at the taste and wiped a hand over his mouth. He was startled by the ugly purple and green rash covering his hand and wrist. He pushed up his sleeve and saw that it spread nearly up to his elbow. Draco saw the way Harry's face fell, and it nearly broke his heart when he looked up at him with those sad, glassy green eyes. “I'm sorry...”
Harry stared at the blonde a moment longer. Curiously, in this lighting, his skin seemed to be taking on a greenish hue. Harry didn't think about it much and instead searched through Draco's bag to see what potions and supplies they had on hand. He was embarrassed by how his heart swelled when he saw just how prepared Draco was for such an unexpected situation like this. Once again, they would've been much worse off if not for his stubborn preparedness. They had snacks, empty goblets to Aguamenti water in, and a variety of emergency potions. They would be alright for now.
"Er, yes, I think I have a phonograph in here somewhere," said Potter. "What do you-"
Back at the castle, Snaperdinck began to prepare for his wedding and for the upcoming war with Durmstrang.  He had been the one to orchestrate Draco's initial abduction, and he now planned to murder Draco on their wedding night to drum up support for the war.
"I am," Draco confirmed as he followed Harry into the kitchen. "Did you dispose of those nasty bangers?"
Intrigued, Harry leaned forward. "Before you...what?" He held his breath as he awaited his boyfriend's response. Was Draco willing to accept the reality of his situation?
Draco quickly tied the Half-Blood Prince to the chair, while Harry sagged against the wall.
"Goodness, I must be off," said Narcissa. She drained the last of her mead and stood. "You need to meet up with Molly and Hermione to make the voyage across the channel to the mainland."
"My trousers!" cried Malfoy. "Now look at what you've done!"
Draco's eyes widened in horror.  "Oh, my sweet Harry!" he gasped.  "What have I done?!"  He threw himself down the hill after his love.
"Wait," said Harry. "We don't want to get in more trouble by skiving off. Can't you use your wand to clean up the roadside?"
"Oh, I can be good, but when I'm naughty, I'm even better," said Harry. He reached down to cup Draco's arse and drag him into intimate contact.
Harry smirked at him. "Crawl."
Zabini joined them at the boat's stern, and they all watched another small craft in the distance.  "It is a coincidence," said Zabini.  "Nothing more."
As soon as he saw his patient, Harry faltered.
"Yes, sir," said Harry. He pushed himself away from the vanity sink, paused to admire Draco in bubbles, then left to fetch his husband the promised cup of tea.
Harry was busy scrambling eggs in one skillet and frying bangers in another when Draco shuffled into the kitchen. His bleary eyes lit up.
"Are you barmy? I'd like nothing better," Harry enthused. "You know how much I've always loved Hogwarts. It was my first real home. Besides, I could always return to St Mungo's during the summer months."
Harry looked up just in time to Draco’s face fall in disappointment. He felt a knot of guilt twist up in his stomach that had nothing to do with his flu.
“Harry, you’re sick. You’re obviously confused! I’m trying to help!”
“Let me guess. The flu?” Draco sighed.
Draco sighed. “What do you last remember?”
“I'll be fine,” Draco defended stubbornly. The sides of his mouth turned up and with a single raised eyebrow he muttered under his breath, “Quit worrying, Mum,” before side-stepping Harry and walking into Kingsley's office to get the details of their mission. Harry laughed quietly to himself and followed him in.
“You can say that again. Look, I know this is asking a lot, but could you please watch Teddy and Scorpius-” Draco started, but Harry interrupted Draco’s request with a sudden bout of harsh coughing. After a moment, Draco realized that Harry wasn’t stopping. His coughs were coming out too quickly, and it didn’t sound like Harry was getting much air in between them. Draco swiveled around and rushed to Harry’s side as Hermione looked on from the fire. He pulled Harry up into a sitting position, and rubbed his back, trying to calm him and get his breathing back under control. Finally, Harry’s coughing slowed, and he opened his eyes for the first time in hours.
‘Well,’ Harry thought, ‘I guess there’s no arguing with that.’ He stood up, feeling lightheaded, and realized that there was a layer of sweat across his brow and the back of his neck. He’d have to take a shower after checking Teddy.
“Oh, I plan to.”
It took two days before Harry came out from the haze of the flu. When he did, the first thing he noticed was the annoying beeping he heard, and the second thing was the smell. It was an uncomfortably clean hospital smell, which meant he was at Mungo’s. Harry remembered waking up here often when he was on the field as an Auror. But he hadn’t been admitted here in years, not since he’d left work to stay home with the boys. What happened?
“Daddy?” A little voice called to Draco from down the hall.
“Can I get you anything?”
“I didn't even know the wizarding world had vaccines!”
“The ones who tampered with your portkey and got you two stuck in no-mans-land? Oh yeah. Big time.”
Pansy just sighed. “So dramatic, Draco. It’s unbecoming of you. You really have been spending too much time with Potter.”
“Harry...?” Draco sat down on the bed and rubbed his hand up and down the length of his husband’s arm, to get him to stir, but Harry just moaned incoherently. Draco frowned, looking down at Harry. He could feel the heat radiating off of the man, even though his thick Weasley sweater. Draco used a diagnostic spell to check for a fever. 103.8. That was hot, too hot for an adult. Draco wracked his brain, trying to decide what he should do.
Draco remained standing, and Harry was briefly distracted by the way the blonde was worrying his bottom lip. Now was not the time.
“Daddy...” Teddy called, as Draco was halfway downstairs.
“Malfoy, how am I supposed to answer all your questions with my mouth full?”
“Is he okay?” Teddy sniffed. The nine-year-old was looking extremely pale again, and Draco wondered how long he’d been looking after Scorpio with Harry being so out of it. Thank Merlin Ted wasn’t sicker, and that he’d had the good sense to call for help.
“We need to get him to St. Mungo's right now!” Draco exclaimed as the team barreled their way into the cell. “He never got vaccinated.” Harry was exhaustedly sinking back down onto their makeshift mattress.
“Shh, it’s alright. We just gotta cool you down a little bit, and then you’ll feel better,” Draco sighed. “How did you get so sick so fast, huh? You seemed fine enough yesterday.” Harry was too headstrong for his own good. Draco knew enough about medicine to know that symptoms didn’t usually get this bad overnight and with a jolt, he realized that Harry could have been hiding the brunt of it for days.
“I just don’t feel good Papa.”
“Papa... papa!”
Draco sighed. “My Grandfather did too. But they were old when they caught it. And it really isn't as severe as it used to be. The vaccine should make it relatively mild.”
“Just under two hours.”
Draco dropped his hand from his face and pushed himself back up on his elbows,  speaking slowly. “Yes? We were vaccinated. It was mandatory, written in our initial Hogwarts letter? Don't you remember?”
Another four hours later, and it was evident to Harry that he wouldn't be able to stay awake the entire night. He had eaten a protein bar from the bag, hoping that would give him a burst of energy. It worked for a while, but it was wearing off, and he was developing a persistent headache, though from exhaustion or stress he wasn't sure. He sat still for a long while, listening to Draco's congested breathing and willing his eyes to stay open, but it was a losing battle.
. . . . . . . . . .
“I uh ...” he sighed. “Alright. I’ll go. But please... let me know if you need anything. I’ll be just outside the door.” Draco lingered for a moment, his brow furrowing as more harsh coughs took over Harry’s body. He walked hesitantly out of the room, shutting the door behind him.
“Yeah, one of the ones we were given before Hogwarts.”
Harry chuckled, though he felt himself getting tired again. He pulled the blankets tighter around himself.
Nearly forty minutes later, Harry lulled Scorpius back to sleep on his chest and then drifted into a fitful sleep himself.
Business at his store always picked up around this time of year, but it seemed that more people were catching the flu this year than Draco remembered in flu seasons past. Mothers had been steadily coming in and out all week, buying Pepperup potion and other potions for their sick children at home. Draco was glad to help them, of course. But on a damp, dreary November day like today, he wanted nothing more than to go home, curl up with his family, and enjoy a nice warm cup of tea.
“Of course. I think you should.”
“Go 'way.”
“Any chance you can you think of a place in Scotland where it snows in July?” Draco looked over to Harry and watched as his eyes darted rapidly around the dark room. The Ministry had never given them a faulty portkey before.
“Finish your chores and then you can go back to your cupboard”.
‘This day will never end ...’ Harry thought. He wondered if he should just owl Draco and admit defeat. He’d been napping all day, and after waking up from each nap, he’d felt worse. He didn’t know how much longer he could go on by himself with two sick kids. Harry felt himself start to get emotional, which was a sure sign that his own fever was rising. The boy who lived could usually keep his cool in situations like these.
. . . . . . . . . .
“What about something small? A popsicle?” Draco suggested, and he saw the briefest flash in his son's eyes that told him that a popsicle would do just the trick. He chuckled. “I’ll take that as a yes, what color will it be?”
Surely it was just worry, or exhaustion from his stressful day. He didn’t feel like he was catching the flu, did he?
“My chest mostly, and my nose and throat.”
It took Draco months to realize he had feelings for the prat, but that was all in the past now. He had been married to Harry for five years now, and they were raising two brilliant boys together.
“Water repellent, and a sticking charm. Should stay put for a bit.” It wasn't much, but they could already feel a slight difference in the cell without the gusty wind blowing in on them. Draco pulled out his wand and enlarged the blanket, smoothed it out over the mattress.
“You were sick earlier this month, Malfoy. I believe you've already met your quota.”
Draco frowned. “I said I would be going home to them shortly. I’m doing the best I can. They’ll manage another hour.”
“In fact, I propose we go out for a proper date when they let us out of here. Which is something I should have asked you for a long time ago.”
“Malfoy, you aren't going to need all that. We'll probably be gone for two hours tops.”
“I love you too, you idiot.”
“It’s okay, Papa.” Teddy’s voice sounded frantic. “I’m gonna firecall daddy for us!”
“Of course you can,” he replied, smiling. He leaned down to kiss Teddy’s forehead.
Draco waved a hand at him before scrunching his nose up and sneezing quickly in his elbow, nearly dropping the soup.  He winced, swallowing hard. That definitely felt like it burned.
Theodore Nott had been the first one to suggest that Draco get checked for an immunodeficiency disorder. Draco had visited St. Mungo's on four separate occasions during Theo's first rotation as an Apprentice Healer. He connected Draco to a specialist who agreed that his immune system was impaired, and who theorized that it was due to the extreme stress of enduring the Imperius curse for so long.
“This was supposed to be an easy mission. We were supposed to have been home by now.” Harry whined for the third time that hour. They were trapped, and it was freezing.
Just over an hour later, Draco returned from the manor arms full of baskets containing crackers, fresh fruit, cough drops, throat soothing tea, ginger ale, boxes of tissues, and a plethora of various medicines, all of which his mother insisted he take home. It all made Draco realize that he had much more appreciation for her coddling when it was directed at one of his sons rather than himself. She had really covered everything, there’s not much else Teddy could want for.
Draco was terrified, but he wasn't about to tell that to Harry. The man needed him to be the strong one for once. “It's okay Harry. It's only temporary. You're going to be okay.” Harry was trembling in Draco's arms, though from fear of fever Draco didn't know.
“Three.”
“Not yet, no. You eat. I'm gonna send another Patronus. I was thinking I ought to try Ron this time since Kingsley hasn't gotten back to us.”
She had a point. It wasn’t a bad plan.
“Mal...Malfoy?” Harry choked out. His emerald eyes grew wide as if in shock and he scrambled back from Draco. Draco grabbed his husband’s wrist before he toppled himself over the other side of the bed. Merlin, even his wrist felt like it could burn through Draco’s palm.
“I don't really love that. You can take five minutes and eat.”
“Not this week I don’t. Ginny has her first championship game with the Harpies. In Germany. And I’ll be damned if I don’t get to go see that.”
Harry had begun to feel unwell days ago. It was nothing serious, just general malaise what he couldn’t quite fit his finger on. But in true Gryffindor fashion, he had been determined to not let his husband see that he was beginning to feel sick. Draco shouldn’t be expected to handle a sick child and a sick husband all on his own.
“Better. Thanks.” Draco replied as Harry climbed back under the blanket with him again. Reaching back into his bag, Draco pulled out a thick blue sweater and pushed it into Harry's hands. "Put it on. Please?” he added and was grateful to see that for once, Harry did what he was told. Draco then pulled out some more clothes and transfigured them into pillows. They would be lumpy, but they would elevate his head which would be good for his sinuses. He passed a pillow to harry, who accepted it gratefully.
“Shh, shh, you're okay. I've got you. You're okay.” Draco chanted nonsensically. Though it was only minutes, it felt like hours until Harry stopped coughing.
* * * * * * *
Draco needed to check his husband’s fever. The way he was acting had Draco pretty worried. He helped Harry lay flat on their bed, and then ushered Teddy back into his room. He could feel Scorpius’s head getting heavy on his shoulder. Draco watched as Teddy crawled back under his covers.
Harry used a spell to check the time and realize that he’s only been asleep for twenty minutes.
“It may actually be burning,” Harry said, quickly. The distress was evident in his voice. “I think... Draco, you've caught Dragon Pox!” he said, noticing the beginnings of a green and purple rash spreading its way out from between Draco's fingers.
“Papa, don’t get up,” Teddy yelled, but Harry’s brain processed this request too late. He wrenched himself out of bed, wobbling to the fireplace. His muscles ached, but he had to get the boys warm. He had be useful.
Draco was testing Harry, willing his husband to be honest. No way in hell was he going to go to work if Harry turned up with the flu as well.
“You go on without me. I need to catch up on all this,” he said, gesturing to the neat stack of paperwork in front of him.
“Mr. Malfoy, we need to get him to respond to treatment quickly. It's the most effective way.”
“Yes. Picked it up from George’s kids. They are dealing well enough. Still bickering over their toys, so I take that as a good sign. I did go to pick up some potions at your shop earlier. Blaise said you guys have it too?”
“...Holy fuck” Draco whispered quietly to himself.
“You got it” Draco replied. “Why don’t you lay here next to Papa and I’ll go get us some popsicles, okay?”
As the Healers began to unhook Harry's machines to wheel him away, Draco felt himself panic. “You're taking him away?” He could hear his heartbeat increase rapidly in the beeps of his monitor. What if something happened to Harry, and Draco wasn't there for him? He promised to be there for him.
The next thing Harry knew, he was being shaken awake. It took him a minute before he realized he was lying face down on the kitchen floor, where he’d collapsed midway scrubbing the floor. Vernon was angry, but Harry was so out of it he nearly couldn’t process Vernon’s anger. There had been so much yelling, and then Harry was grabbed by his collar and dragged into his cupboard under the stairs. He barely came out for days. It took weeks for Petunia to stop reminding him of what a useless burden he was, which made him worse than he’d felt when he’d been sick.
“My throat really hurts”.
“It's okay now. We'll take care of him,” Pansy said in her most reassuring tone. She knelt beside Draco and took one of his hands in his. “How are you feeling?”
After settling the soup away, Draco used a charm to reheat their forgotten mugs of tea and carried them both upstairs to find Harry. Once again the house was silent. He first looked in their master bedroom, and then in Teddy’s. What he saw upon entering the room was two very sleepy boys curled up in one very small bed. All the blankets were pushed to the end of the bed, and Teddy had managed to squirm half of himself on top of Harry without either of them waking. Draco could hear soft, congested snores coming from his son. The sight of the two of them made Draco’s heart soar.
Scowling at the blonde, Harry clarified. “Did you eat breakfast?”

“She didn't, I don't think. I would have remembered.”
Ron figured that anyone who saved his best friend's arse out in the field more times than he could count deserved his friendship. And if Harry someday worked up the backbone to ask Malfoy out on a proper date, Ron supposed that would be alright too.
“No, I don’t wanna eat. I don’t wanna make my belly sick”.
* * * * * * *
“Yeah, right,” Harry laughed sleepily. “You wouldn’t have the courage.”
They ate in silence for a while, occasionally hearing some coughing coming from Teddy’s bedroom upstairs. Harry was really not interested in eating anything. His stomach had settled for the time being, and he could only pray it would stay that way. No, his problem at the moment was the tickle in his throat, which was growing more persistent with each bite. He took a sip of wine, willing it to go away. He felt the wine burn down his throat as he swallowed, leaving him no choice but to give in.
He’d really wanted to leave early, but with so many people coming in and out, Draco wasn’t sure if that was possible. He’d spent the morning making all the necessary potions he’d need, but without time to properly train Blaise, he couldn’t trust that the man knew what he was doing. He didn’t have any idea what to prescribe, and his shop had a reputation to uphold. Draco would have admit though if only to himself, that it was nice having a bit of help. Even if Blaise was fairly incompetent.
“No, no we just agreed that it would be better to both stay home with the kids, in case anyone gets any worse. Fleur’s kids had this last week and she was warning us that it comes on rather quickly.”
Angrily, Draco wondered how he had been careless enough as to miss all the signs that his husband hadn’t been doing well before yesterday.
