“I know. He comes in often. He might be rude to everyone, but he doesn’t look at anyone else like that.” She said  with a wink giving me back my change. I left hurriedly not wanting to discuss his habits with a virtual stranger in public.
“Yes, how IS she doing this Severus? I haven’t seen anything like it before. The self control is just remarkable. You know for a mudblood she is quite impressive.” Voldemort said reluctant to give me a compliment, but unable to deny how quiet I had been.
“Long day, I hope you're feeling better?” The Headmaster asked, eating his own food quite slowly with his one good hand.
“She views you as her cold uncaring professor. You have to change how she perceives you if you want to have any chance of bonding with her.”
I could see it. Her future . A family, her in my mansion running around after our black haired child. I could hear her joyful laughter at their insane tactics as if it already existed. She would teach them potions from a young age, feeding their desire to learn with the love and the patience every child deserves.
"Granger, surely you must join in the festivities. Please, drink up!" Voldemort said with what could almost be misconstrued as a smile. I took the fancy goblet nervously glancing to Snape to make sure it was safe. He nodded, but I could tell it wasn't just wine in the goblet. It was spiked with something, I just wasn't sure.
"Fuck you. Fuck this." I said under my breath turning and leaving him alone. He called my name , but I ignored him and ran until I found the door and left not caring where I went to. It was freezing and I had no wand on me, but I was so angry I went out into the cold anyways desperate to get away from him.
Everything had felt so real. So perfect. The things he had said made me feel better than I had ever felt before.
A few doors down I found the kitchens where Severus was cooking in just his sweatpants, looking more attractive than I would have liked to admit. When he saw me he immediately smiled carefree and relaxed.
He grinned a bit, leaning back in his chair thoroughly feeling great it seemed. The only other time I had seen him smile was at the death eater meeting. The dirty and salacious thoughts this brought back made me blush instantly. He noticed and his grin became a full smirk and his eyes grazed over my body hungrily.
When we got to the Headmasters office he gave me a hug goodnight and left me, our friendship on much better terms it seemed.
I hadn't expected it to be that fucking good. It was devilish and now I understood why people thought it was so taboo. To feel such immeasurable pleasure and indulge in it was quite evil in itself.
"I made seven horcruxs Severus. They each had a special meaning to me. I placed protective spells so I would know if they were moved." He said frustrated he didn't have the real thief to punish now.
"What the fuck Minerva!" I yelled trying to get away from her. She chased me around the headmaster's desk, her old features overrun with anger.
"Why can't you just not anger him Severus?" She said accusingly. I started to cry with my own guilt and she gave me one last glare before picking herself up and leaving me sobbing alone.
His tongue danced with mine first gentle, but quickly harder and when he bit my lip it sent a wave of pleasure through my body. I hummed wanting more even as he pulled back.
When I entered his throne room I immediately bowed down kneeling at his feet and kissing the hem of his robe obediently hoping tonight wouldn't be another bad one.
“Severus, what are your thoughts?” Professor McGonagall asked with a huff after arguing with Pomona for a solid twenty minutes.
“I didn’t ask you to develop feelings for her. I know you have a soft spot for muggle born, so I shouldn’t be shocked. Unfortunately I think my plan really has changed. She needs to be killed or she will ruin you. Bring her to me.” He said with a small amount of annoyance at how inconvenient her death would be.
The burned hand on the headmaster was definitely from his family's ring, it made perfect sense. After researching a bit on how horcruxes worked I was sure the diary was one too. It literally had a piece of Voldemort's soul in it.
We stopped when we got to a large dining room already filled with people laughing and chattering away. On the large mahogany table was a feast fit for a king with every inch covered in delicious foods that would put Hogwarts food to shame.
"Why?" The Dark Lord asked after a long pause seeming surprised and slightly less angry realizing I hadn't entirely disobeyed him.
"He wanted the child to have a good mother. His own was very cold and distant. I would have pampered the little brat, but I could never convince him." She said looking at him with annoyance even though he wasn't even paying attention to us.
"That bastard needs to die. You were supposed to be for me." Ron said horrified Snape had taken his property. I glared at him unimpressed by his assessment.
The order immediately started to get their wand out ready to fight, but one death eater stepped forward holding up their hands.
“What old man. I was busy.” He snapped leaning back in his chair taking his hands off me. My shirt was still untucked and my hair was a mess from him. The headmaster raised an eyebrow surprised, but strangely enough didn’t comment. Surely such relations were frowned upon at Hogwarts even if the witch was of age?
He seemed to catch on where my mind was going and he released me as if burned backing up, still angry but not touching me at least.
I for some reason assumed he wouldn't show up and that it was some sort of trick, but I saw his shadow by the lake, the moonlight reflecting off him just enough to see him.
“My mind princess. Your just a figment of my imagination. A beautiful. Wonderful. Enlightening figment.” I said brushing her hair behind her ear . She smiled, but not as brightly as I expected.
“What does it matter to you anyways?” I asked with a huff of annoyance at him making conditions to our arrangement. He gazed at me for a long moment taking me in. The intensity of his gaze was so strong I felt myself shifting nervously.
His body was well filled out but without being overly muscular and he had to be using some sort of potion to stop aging,  or maybe all that potion steam did him good, because he looked like he was in his twenties, not thirties. I had never considered him in any indecent way but had heard the girls gossiping quite often, even going so far as to flirt with him. Something he heavily punished yet they did anyways.
"I'm more than a death eater." He said weakly. My heart stopped realizing how badly I misjudged him. He had a single tear falling down his cheek and I wiped it away shaking my head empathetically.
“I know that. I want to make one.” I said firmly. I expected him to laugh. Me? Make a spell? It was insanity.
"You idiotic filth! Now because of you my most trusted servant is dead! You disgusting trash!" He roared, shaking me violently. My anger couldn't not have been higher than at that very moment.
"You have utterly failed. Congratulations Potter. You get a zero." He groaned loudly and whispered some apologies to Hermione who just giggled and looked at her hair amused.
"Yes please." I said eager to get away from everyone and be able to relax and rant a bit with just them not worrying about anyone else hanging around watching. Draco had blown his cover with Voldemort coming in with Harry, but he still didn't seem apt to tempt fate and have all of Slytherin after him for hanging out with us.
"You accuse me of being dark, yet then drag me off to him every chance you get. Don't you see the issue?" I snapped a bit more loudly since the librarian had wandered off leaving us alone. His eyes narrowed.
The curses continued and I realized he was trying to weaken me from blood loss. It was working. I couldn't even gasp between the curses he hurled at me furiously let alone mount a defense.
“Is Misses hungry? Dobby barely sees Misses plate dirty anymore. Your far too thin also. Dobby will feed you, but you have to promise not to free any elves.” Dobby said with a smile grabbing my hand making the decision for me quite happily. He bounced down the hall to the kitchens which wasn’t far from where I had been.
"You should write to the Prime Minister. Complain. Maybe you can get him sent to Azkaban." Ron mused swallowing an unearthly amount of food at once. I cringed wondering how I used to have a crush on him at all.
“Lavender isn’t the best source for what girls want…and maybe so…but when there is already feelings there. I don’t feel that way for you.” I said bluntly since hinting wasn’t going to work on someone as thick headed as him. He looked at me bewildered then his expression changed and darkened.
"I do. The question is, do you?" She questioned cheekily intentionally riling me up. I expected her to refuse to drink it knowing the side effects would be her hair changing to a pure white color so I could give her detention. I needed an excuse to keep her behind yet again for her lessons and to yell at her in this case for studying the Dark Arts.
"You insufferable git." I said glad when the gates opened and we could head back and I could hide my smile at his ridiculous comment. Perhaps I had been bribed. Everything in life was give and take, and I had gotten a wonderful evening out of standing by his side, and hopefully more to come.
"Yes. Minnie will have baby soon. Minnie can't wait, maybe Mister's friend wants to give baby their first clothes?" She offered to me kindly. I smiled loving the fact she looked forward to freedom for her baby as opposed to despising it.
Neville sullenly packed his things and I couldn’t help but feel pity for him as he left with his head hanging.
“My…haven’t we grown up.” He said hungrily, his eyes raking me even though I was fully clothed. I used to have more curves before stress kicked in, but apparently I still had some left thankfully. He tried to reach for me, but I smacked his hand away forcefully.
The wine was bitter, but that only complimented the pasta even more. I was in heaven in every way and I couldn't stop myself from smiling.
"Nonsense. I want to destroy it." I said having no interest in wearing a piece of Voldemort's soul. The very thought sent shivers up my spine. He relaxed a bit at this.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. I just had to make sure. With your power, you would be unstoppable if you went dark." I explained hoping she would take it as a compliment. She didn't.
I smirked in a very Snape like way and laughed ironically. I felt Snape's power flowing to me and I felt crushed realizing it meant he had passed, but that same feeling empowered me in ways I had never dreamed was possible.
"I thought for sure they would've carted you off to Azkaban!" I said relieved he got off the hook. The corruption of our system was even more apparent then to me than ever.
"Then don't leave me." I said putting the goblet down and kissing him. I wasn't nearly as good as he was, but he kissed me back quickly taking control, his hand going onto my hair tipping my face perfectly.
“It was your magic. I think I felt it go out and come in me. I stole your magic.” I said worried and horrified. He was a death eater and used dark magic all the time. That meant now I held some of his dark magic energy.  He looked as worried as I felt.
"Severus would be more appropriate." I reminded her kissing her neck softly taking in her smell, her soft skin, the way she melted into my touch.
She didn’t respond back any words, but somehow I understood what pained her. Me. It was the strangest feeling of longing that I had ever felt before. I wanted to fix it for her, take away that feeling, but didn’t know how.
Her eyes widened and she backed up slowly, her smile nervous but also still there. I shut the door behind us and in a second had her on the edge of the large four poster bed,
Then why did it feel so right? I should have protested when he slid my robes off smoothly off my shoulders, but I just hummed in the kiss letting him undress my deftly working with one hand and using the other to explore my body.
“Granger, instead of flirting with your classmates, focus will you?” Snape said startling me out of my thoughts. I glared at him matching his rudeness easily.
“I…I…Ron will you let go?” I stammered unable to do it. It was messed up, but there were feelings there much to my dismay. He smiled sarcastically and shook his head.
This ring is my mother's. It opens the door to my home, a place I always wanted filled with laughter and happiness, even if the laughter won't be my own. It will also open my vault. Every moment I spend with you I find my breath taken away by your beauty, inside and out. I know you will one day find your true love that will feel the same for you and will give you the future you desire.
For a moment I could almost believe the fantasy. Us there together, happy and looking forward to a bright future together. It was so close, yet neither of us owned our own destiny. We only had that day knowing it was all we would ever have.
"You know the rules Hermione. I can't go further until you ask for it." He said letting me unbutton his white button up shirt.
“Miss Granger, when you are done with your potions you are to immediately bring me a sample. Don’t wait until the end of the class and don’t empty your cauldron.” He said without even looking up from the papers he was grading.
“Where are you Severus?” She asked me leaning her head against my shoulder letting me lead her in a slow dance to the classical music that played in the background.
The table was being cleared by no less than a dozen house elves, but their appearance surprised me. They were taller than the ones I had seen before and were wearing uniforms that matched each other. They were free. I smiled a bit to myself realizing the heartless man clearly wasn't so heartless after all. He cared for them and they were plump and healthy looking.
"Hermione...Hermione! HERMIONE!" I yelled, becoming more and more panicked with every second. I could almost feel the seconds ticking by in my mind slowly passing, taking her life with it.
"Why do I get the feeling that you're behind the Dark Lord's decision to use Granger? Somehow I feel like this was just your entire plan to make me fall in love with her. Your psychotic version of matchmaking." I said glancing at him as we walked trying to gage his reaction. His cheerful demeanor didn't falter.
"A diadem?" I asked, confused. First his anger was over his horcruxes, now some sort of tiara? It was insane ramblings.
"Well, you know what? If purity means that much to them why don't you marry Malfoy." I said with a smirk at his indignant expression at the very idea.
"Damn it Hermione. Don't scare me like that. Fuck. What are you doing out after curfew anyways?" He asked getting up and helping me up before brushing himself off from the castle's dirt.
He stretched me inside and the pressure slowly became easier to handle, but the fire he had caused burned hotter and hotter. I moaned with desire, sure I couldn't handle it much more, but just as I felt I was about to fall over the edge he pulled back from the kiss slightly.
I skipped all classes the next few weeks between the rampant gossiping and wanting to avoid him. The Headmaster asked me to pull out of the classes and become one of the teachers' apprentices anyways so it wasn't like my Professors should care about my attendance anyways. I couldn't decide who I wanted to apprentice with, but both Professor McGonagall and Lupin had offered.
It wasn't my fault Lucius had kissed me, it took two other people holding me down for him to even get that. He was a selfish bastard and I needed to stop forgetting that. This was all a game to him after all.
We were almost to the room when Snape came down the hall, his dark mood evident before he even got to us. He didn't acknowledge Harry or Ron, he looked me up and down seeming to take in my stress from the day. He stopped in front of me not letting me pass, the musky scent he had taunting me.
It seemed I wasn't the only one who had enjoyed the day, minus the whole getting arrested thing of course.
“I’ve tried Harry. No matter what I do the magic won’t respond. Its like…like someone created a block making sure that no one could ever do exactly what I’m trying to do.” I said frustrated with my lack of progress.
"Snape left this for you." Ginny said, handing me the pocket watch. I nodded numbly and ran upstairs grabbing the diadem. It was in the far corner of my trunk almost forgotten and I had to dig a bit to find it, my hands shaking.
"Get Madame Pomfrey." Draco told Potter who immediately ran off to go get help. It wouldn't help, he wouldn't be back within three minutes so she would suffocate. Her total paralysis included her breathing which had fully stopped.
I hated potions with a vengeance that Harry and Ron would never understand. They assumed that just because I got good grades in the class that I loved it, but the way Professor Snape always made a point to make me miserable had rubbed me the wrong way for so many years I dreaded his class.
"I assumed you asked me down here to yell at me for taking your potions ingredients or for reading dark arts books. I much prefer this." I said after a few moments.
“That’s meant to be dosed at a tablespoon per ten minuets under the cruciatis curse.” I told him breaking the silence. He raised an eyebrow to me.
I looked to Snape while he was distracted. He was in line with the other death eaters and the mask hid his face, but I could see the slightest quirk of smile under his mask, our argument seeming insignificant now in comparison to such an acomplishmemnt.
“Yes Professor.” I responded nervously suddenly feeling all eyes on me curious why he wanted my potion specifically. I was sure it was to taunt it and ridicule it even though I knew it would be passable.
I had never seen something so beautiful. Every hall we went down was carefully decorated with the shite marble floor and hand carved marble trim. Even the lights were stunning, when I looked closely I realized the hundreds of light holders were actually white panther figurines. All the lights made the halls beautiful and bright instead of dark and dreary like most manors I had been in, including Malfoy manor. I could tell great care was put into making it a quality home.
"Of course." She smiled evenly and engaged Bellatrix in a conversation about her husband's upcoming election for minister of magic.
"See, I told you it was him! He deserves to be sent to Azkaban!" A hysterical woman said from the stands, tears running down her face and a handkerchief in hand. Severus's eyes narrowed dangerously to her.
Everyone had their death eater robes on, but the masks were forgotten in the casual atmosphere of the room.
"It's funny how Dumbledore always gets credit for being the leader of the light, when we both know he's only shades better than Voldemort and who the real hero has been this whole time." He said thoughtfully brushing off his old ragged robes absently. My glare narrowed.
I was angry at Ron so didn’t want to talk to him, but Harry and Draco had snuck off to a secluded corner somewhere to hang out uninterrupted. I found myself going into my favorite place, an old bookstore at the very end of Hogsmeade that was neglected and no one ever went in. The books it held were unique and high quality, not like the newer book stores low cost knock offs.
"Of course not empath. You're immune to its effects. It's your bonded's magic that is controlling you. I can feel it." Tom said coolly, turning a mirror towards me so I could see my reflection.
"Fuck, Hermione!" I ran the rest of the distance to her and picked her up. She was limp and lifeless. I whispered the incantation for hot air and let the air hover over her slowly warming her as I rushed to the gates.
“Practicing to become a death eater?” He asked with no small amount of anger. I was at least his same height for once on the stool for one of our arguments.
“Ah, so that’s why Potter keeps falling asleep in class.” He mused nodding appreciative of the ammo for the next lesson. I felt my annoyance getting stronger at his twisting of my words and the exhaustion from studying all night trying to learn enough to stay alive in this war started to eat at me.
"You know dearie, you should really get a social life." The library caretaker said coming over and seeing me still there on lockup time. I had just found a book outlining the destruction of an early version of the philosopher's stone which was the most promising thing I had read in a while. They had used fiendfyre.
All this time I had been wearing a piece of his soul. I wanted to throw up. Luckily I was weak enough I restrained that urge.
"I'm not your toy." I retorted hotly and made to stomp away, but he grabbed me roughly by my wrist pulling me back to him, his dark eyes full of ice.
He wanted me, that was for sure. It was like the line of decency had been crossed with such a force he couldn’t even see it anymore, or maybe didn’t care. I didn’t think the teenagers would be able to keep my attention now that I knew what experience looked and felt like. I had tasted the forbidden apple and I couldn’t forget it.
I slowly crawled to Harry, pulling him aside not wanting him trampled on during the battle that was about to erupt.
"Finally, Minnie has found Mister and his friend!" A slightly annoyed house elf said appearing before us with a start. She wore a nice uniform of black and white that fit her perfectly and she was quite round in the middle, which was something that was uncommon with house elves. She had a tray of hot chocolate she gave to Severus who gave me a hot drink before grabbing his own.
“Unfortunately, concessions have to be made for the endgame result. He has too many supporters right now.” Snape said seriously.
"YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?" He screamed at the top of his lungs, his magic sparking around him with his loss of control. I took a deep breath trying not to panic and in a split second knew what my plan was. I looked up at him looking him in the eyes seeing the anger rolling across his contorted expression.
I shut the outside world out and used my legimancy to separate myself from the pain. It was the only way I could make it through this without going insane. Or perhaps that’s what happened right before you went insane, compensate disassociation. I wasn’t sure.
"Your pregnant?" I asked shocked. Minnie nodded enthusiastically, rubbing her rounded belly quite happily.
"Expecting anyone?" I asked, stiffening a bit realizing they were aurors catching sight of the medallion on their coats. One was a tall thick dark man, and the other quite skinny with his wand already out ready for a fight.
"I knew you were lying. Don't worry. The amusement of your choice of lies to try to convince me not to die was quite funny and actually helped, though not in the way you guessed. You're forgetting I can read minds." He said teasingly, enjoying my reaction to the fullest. I sighed, relieved and thankful I had dodged that bullet.
“I don’t think you see her brilliance really. She’s not just intelligent, but she applies herself too.” Minerva continued fussing me out over her potatoes.
"Should we?" One of them asked the judge, but he shook his head and we passed untouched. When we were in the hall I let out a deep breath I didn't even know I had been holding in.
"Nothing. Just something I have to take care of." I said taking a deep breath not knowing if my plan would succeed at all. My thought that they could be destroyed by fiendfyre was and educated guess at best.
I finished studying the effects of magical exhaustion in my Magical Healing Properties book I was studying and headed to the common room. The halls were empty and silent even though I was heading back before curfew, which was unusual for me.
“Severus!” The headmaster came in the otherwise empty library calling for Snape unable to see him until Snape unwillingly waved his hand dropping his charms around us.
Snape didn’t say anything when we got in, just waved his hand to unlock the supplies cabinet door for us. He seemed broodier than usual. The class was silent, their focus on not failing the first exam of the year, so when Snape finally spoke everyone jumped up.
"I should be angrier. I should hit him or something. I just can't seem to bring myself to actually do it." I admitted hating how weak I was.
"Fuck it." He said, I could feel the warm wetness inside as he came hard forcing me down on his cock several more times. Finally I was able to cum when he released my throat and I leaned against him riding out the wave of pleasure.
"Finally, at last. I get to taste the coveted fruit. You know we have all been quite obsessed with you after your performance with Severus. It's like you draw us in, only for him to be selfish and refuse to share." He said smirking at me struggling against the two death eaters holding me against the wall.
“Yes.” I admitted knowing I couldn’t deny it. I had felt very confident in myself, but something about him always made me nervous. I would be upset if he were mad at me for some odd reason.
The manor was huge and I quickly got lost trying to find a bathroom. There were rooms full of books that made the Hogwarts library look like a thrift store comparatively, lots of fully decorated bedrooms that were warm and inviting. I found an office that held tall bookshelves that went to the ceiling and a large desk in the middle.
“How did she get into Voldemort’s hands?” The headmaster asked again taking a seat on one of my chairs, his grand purple robes sparkling oddly in the firelight.
“We really must stop meeting like this. You climbing on things…” A familiar silky voice said from behind me. I felt my blood run cold realizing I had been caught by him.
“I don’t think that’s really all it is. You called me to your mind. You can deny it all you want, but I know some part of you doesn’t just think of me as another student. I saw your innermost desires.” She said softly, her tone more serious now. She was right, how could I be so weak to allow her into my mind willingly?
"Granger, you go in like that and you will leave with nothing on. No one is to touch you. I repeat, you CANNOT go in there like that." He warned me, his temper showing, his grip on my arm bruising me. I gasped in pain and he released me finally.
"What's this?" Ginny said distractedly looking under my bed now. I felt my heart stop seeing the glint of metal under my bed realizing a split second too late what I forgot. She picked it up and I knew she could feel the dark magic that radiated off of it. Her expression darkened and she dropped it as if burned standing up angrily.
“Neville asked me to go with him to Hogsmeade tomorrow.” She gushed happily the moment we were alone except for our sleeping bunk mates. That’s why she wanted Harry to find me, to gossip. Of course. I had forgotten that today was Friday let alone the fact that we had a Hogsmeade weekend coming up.
As if in slow motion her movements slowed dramatically and she looked at me with surprise. She opened her mouth as if to gasp for air, but then fell back passing out, her body not moving at all on the cold stone floor.
"Tell me you didn't figure out the horcruxes by thinking of what you yourself would use." He said challenging me. My mouth opened, but I just as quickly closed it realizing there was more truth to his words than I liked.
"It's over." He said quietly, sitting beside me enveloping me in his embrace. His warm magic swirled around me and inside me calming me and soothing me gently.
Instead I closed my eyes focusing my magic on what I wanted to accomplish and the memory I had of him from before he was brought from the crux of death.
“Is that so?” He asked silkily. My amusement died down just a bit and I realized I had just stolen one of the most corrupt people I knew magic. Then joked about it. He could kill me and get it back. I was nothing to him, right?
"I have to go." I said leaving him alone in the darkness. Every irrational part of me wanted to run back to him and the safety he promised me, but I knew it was smoke and mirrors. A false mask just like the death eater mask he donned and just like his work as a teacher.
"We should have Miss. Granger pulled out of classes. I think that would be the best thing at this point." The Headmaster said levelly as if this was an everyday decision. I snorted in humor at that.
"Your baby needs rest. Not chaos. You only have two more weeks left, enjoy the time without a screaming elf to watch." He told her a bit harshly annoyed with her defiance.
"Aha! Here it is. Empaths were generally more powerful than a normal witch or wizard. Their power was something that inspired legends, but also inspired fear. They were heavily prosecuted during the early 1200's until the last one died out. The differences between a normal witch or wizard and an empath was subtle.
“I see…I know what this is about…you have feelings now for him, don’t you? I was wondering why you didn’t get him arrested.” He said looking at me disgusted. I didn’t have to ask who he was talking about.
I wasn't quite so cool about it. I felt tears welling up again. He sighed even more drastically whispering 'women dramatics' under his breath and gave me a hug.
I felt dizzy, my mind swirled and I looked down at my potion. Not wanting to look at his glare full of hatred.
"What have I told you about exhausting yourself in your state?" He said with more than a hint of his trademark annoyance. She folded her arms defiantly.
"What do I get out of it? You think I'm a gold digger? What kind of nonsense is that?" I spat angry he could think such a thing of me.
“You missed class twice now. Why are you in the library at ten at night when you can’t even make it to a ten am class?” He asked folding his arms and glaring at me accusingly. I could smell the bourbon on him still, a smell I was familiar with from the copious amounts of bourbon Hagrid drank when we visited him. Hagrid became loud and annoying when drinking, but I could barely tell the difference with Snape.
"Exactly Severus. What else does she need? There's no point in her remaining a student here. It will only cause unwanted drama. She can stay as a teachers apprentice or something." The Headmaster said patiently as if I were a five year old. I tapped my fingers on the chair seething.
"Tell me what's bothering you." I said not answering his question, wanting desperately for such a difficult question to just not exist.
"You went through my memories." She said startled and angry in a split second. I tried to reach for her to pull her back to me and calm her, but she lurched away glaring sharply.
"It's not worth it." I mumbled my irritation increasing exponentially. Harry tried to motion for Ron to shut up, but he continued on his Snape tired oblivious to my mounting anger.
She wasn’t looking at me and I didn’t know how exactly to make my thoughts intentionally get to her, but she glanced up at me almost instantly and I knew she got my message.
Harry would be so happy here. I could see him falling for the ruse easily seeing what he could never have. Even I felt a pang of envy realizing my own family had become so distant that I could hardly claim them as family. I couldn't just openly talk about Hogwarts with them having casual light hearted conversation. They had their life and I had mine. I was isolated in so many ways staying in the Wizarding world and the older I got, the most isolating it became.
I thought back hoping he would get the message somehow. His back was to everyone so I was the only one who could see his face under the mask, but I was still stunned when he smiled amused. He never smiled. Something about the way he pulled me up closer to him and looked down at me daring me to challenge him changed my entire mindset in an instant.
That moment I promised myself I would never hit my child or wife. I would never hurt someone like he hurt us. I would be better than him.
His smile was light and genuine like it had been at his manor and it was only then that I realized how dark the cursed pocket watch had made him.
“What kind of bad feeling?” He asked sounding more concerned than I anticipated. I bit my lip nervously to vocalize it, but at the same time needing to say my fear aloud.
"She doesn't remember how she got like this. Potter told me she tried some of his potion. I get the feeling that isn't all that happened?" Poppy said accusingly to me, her tone clipped unlike its usual firmness she had with me.
I packed up my things to head to lunch over the day already, and the worst was yet to come still. I had to deal with Snape from two until it was almost time for bed, and he had ignored my existence for the last week after giving me my Christmas present, so I didn't expect that to go good. Life couldn't get worse.
"You can feel his magic? Bonded to an empath? Surely you don't mean...I'm not an empath. I create spells, yes, but I can't control magic." I said finally getting my thoughts away from my own reflection to focus on what he was saying.
It got dark outside before I was even halfway done and I didn’t realize how exhausted I was until I stood up to go to the next cauldron and I felt my feet buckle under me and my vision black out. I fell to my knees catching myself somewhat, the air feeling thin around me all of a sudden.
"What were you doing with Snape?" Harry asked with more than a hint of suspicion not as oblivious today as Draco was. Usually Draco was the suspicious one of the two of them.
“I guess love doesn’t care if it takes death to bring people together. It will accomplish its aim regardless.” I mused albeit sadly knowing there would be no real winners in this war once all was said and done.
He was waiting outside when I left though, giving me pause to my thoughts. He was leaned back against the window of a store opposite of me and as soon as I came out he started to come to me, his dark look full of emotions I couldn’t read.
I dreaded explaining to the Headmaster what was going on with his master plan. She had somehow gone from not competent at all with commanding magic to perfection in minutes. We thought we had months still to prepare for an eventual all out war, but with him using her as a tool if we didn't destroy him soon he would be too powerful to kill even with all the horcruxes gone. Potter was the one who was supposed to kill him and he was hardly the strongest wizard anyways.
“Is it though?” I said with a dark grin. He wasn’t scared of me like most of the teachers. Unfortunately. He just rolled his eyes at my comment.
"Oh dear. I think you need to grab the Headmaster, will you?" She asked Draco who left almost immediately. Poppy patted my shoulder confusedly, but tried to console me nonetheless.
I was dreading yet another day of failed spell making, but I tried to keep that out of my head as I got dressed for the day. Ginny was going through my trunk under my bed trying to get a clean shirt out since she had forgotten to wash hers and I was the same size.
"You just stood by while I testified that I killed a man in cold blood for revenge. Your price may no longer be monetary, but I think you have been bought out nonetheless." He said quietly looking up at the wall in the elevator refusing to meet my eyes.
He then put my clothes on for me, his movements confident, yet gentle. It was as if I were simply his doll he had finished using and wanted to put away. I wanted to cry. I wanted to yell at him and tell him how messed up this all was. I opened my mouth to yell, but he looked at me with a deathly silent warning glare daring me to make a sound.
Yet she was going to survive. He couldn’t kill her, because he knew he would loose me. He needed me. My voice vanished as I screamed under the intensity of the pain until it was a soundless scream. I had only ever seen him torture someone so horribly once before, and it didn’t end well.
"No offense…but your boring. Its not like I'm going to tell him you guys are studying spells to defeat him. Not to mention he couldn't stop you even if he tried. He has given up on his whole kill Potter idea and has moved onto way to slowly drive you to insanity I think." Draco said musing the insane man's decisions as if he were a logical being.
"Empaths died out ages ago. You've been locked up for far too long Tom." I said moving to take the diadem off. He stopped me, his expression becoming serious for a moment.
“She wants me to teach her how to make spells. I found her creeping in the dark arts section of the bookstore trying to learn by herself.” I said grumpily. The headmaster grabbed me a coffee cup and tapped his wand to it filling it with hot chocolate before handing it to me which I accepted with a shaky hand.
"Your chosen one is dead fool." Voldemort said, his smile cruel and his attention off me finally. I was losing blood fast and I knew I only had a few minutes of life left. I tried to heal my wounds, but whatever dark curses they were wouldn't heal with normal spells.
"Severus mentioned the events of last night. You don't have to stay for class if you need some time alone." She said kindly after a moment.
I closed my eyes taking a deep breath trying to hold back the pain that was physical, but didn’t have any actual cause. It was the pain of having to love her and then leave her all alone.
His confidence in me was surprising considering I had failed up until that moment every chance. I felt my confidence pick up and I nodded taking the Dark Lord's hands in mine holding back the revulsion I felt at touching him. His dark energy shying from me and I tilted my head , my anxiety gone and replaced by curiosity.
Of course he didn't understand why I wouldn't give in to him and betray my friends. I would rather die than willingly let everyone I knew be enslaved by him.
“The urge to do more advanced and unbound magic will only get stronger the longer she puts it off. I think learning to control the power surge she will have will be important to prevent anyone from getting hurt.” He explained kindly looking me up and down.
"Hermione. We need to stop...people already are gossiping about you. I don't want to make it worse..." He reminded me, pulling back panting, his hands holding me firmly in place even as he told me no. I made a disappointed noise and leaned in whispering in his ear.
"I was hoping you would be slightly less dramatic at being invited to dinner. The company may not be the best, but the Christmas eve dinners are legendary with him." He said not having to explain who he was referring to. I snorted in humor at this following him to the gates.
I stood in silence watching the panther for a moment taking it in. He was gorgeous, his fur was silky black and when he stepped over to me it was silent even with massive paws on the marble.
“I dunno.” I said hazily. He was standing to my left and seemed reluctant to touch me to help me up, but also seemed unwilling to let me die on his floor unattended.
"I can feel it...your drawing the magic to you even from me. Oh it's so terrifying, but exhilarating. You could kill me right now if you wanted to, but I know you won't do that." He said energized just talking about me. I felt like I had the world's greatest hype man and I couldn't help but smile.
"I don't believe that for a moment. Do you see how she's looking at you?" Minerva said accusingly hitting the paper I was still holding for emphasis, her lips drawn into a thin disproving line. I looked at the picture again , her small smile that of angels, and I had been assuming she was the devil. I was so blind in so many ways. Seeing how she looked at me from the point of view of someone else was so surprising I didn't even know how to process.
I got to Hermione's but hers was entirely wrong. I didn't even recognize the concoction she was making. It was a shimmery dark blue and smelled absolutely divine. She bit her lip nervously and shifted uncomfortably under my disproving gaze.
"You sure you didn't put him under a spell, right? That would be some great revenge though. His worst fear is falling in love." Draco said with no small amount of amusement at the idea of Snape in love.
“Yes, well apparently calling her a shrew who couldn’t even keep a bee's attention got to her. She’s quite sensitive.” Minerva explained.
"The way you looked at her." He said sitting down ready to talk about whatever was bothering him. I had unofficially adopted him, even though he was a Ravenclaw. I saw so much of my past in his story and knew how hard it was to grow up without any guardian's.
“Oh gosh.” I mumbled to myself blushing thankful when she left me alone in the middle of the books again. I sighed looking at all the options trying to find one that would suit my needs. I had read most of them, or at least glanced through them and decided they weren’t worth it.
"Of course professor. Wouldn't want people think I was up to no good, wouldn't you?" I sniped back folding my arms across my chest. He ground his teeth at the attitude, but he left quickly not staying to fight like I expected.
"What is this? Why would you have something cursed under your bed?" She asked, horrified. I knew the memories of the diary must have come back to her.
"No. He's too important. He brought me back alive and sane, that's all that matters." I said wishing the world wasn't as cold as that, but it was. Not that I wanted him fired obviously.
I wanted to stop him, yet another part of me was curious what came next. I didn’t know I had a rebellious side to myself, but it came out full throttle and I wanted to continue and push the limits of what I was exposed to.
I tipped her chin up so I could look in her eyes doing just a tad bit of legilimency hating myself for abusing her trust.
"I can do it as long as needed." I said firmly, refusing to admit how close I came to my own death today. The Dark Lord knew he needed me alive, but he was also exceptionally careless when angry and he was royally pissed today.
My mind reeled with what he said and I stood there in the office for what felt like forever. He knew Dumbledore wanted to replace the ministry, but how? Was he being honest? Was this all nothing more than two grown adults fighting over government control? Was magic really going to keep getting weaker until eventually it disappeared with mixing with muggles? The logic wasn't wrong.
“Okay.” I said a bit unwillingly. Part of me wanted to keep his magic. It felt so untamed and playful. He grabbed my wrists and focused on me, his dark eyes focused on me. I felt my breath hitch in my throat not used to anyone paying so much attention to me.
"No. Never. I'm sorry, I forgot myself for a moment." I said emptily turning and walking away. I needed to get distance between myself and her. She was too dangerous. I never lost control. Ever. Everything I did was calculated and intentional.
"You could have called for help BEFORE he put his hands on you. What the actual Fuck Hermione. I swear. I can't take you anywhere." He was beyond furious, but I couldn't help but grin a bit amused at his anger. He was firefly protective of me, that much was for sure.
"If you won't tell, neither will I." I said softly. That was all he needed to hear. He kissed me pulling me back to him hard, but this time thrusting into me. I felt myself gasp in surprise, but he refused to let me out of the kiss continuing to move me against him and fuck me slowly.
"I didn't think you had done such a good job Severus. I was over here thinking you were a failure." The Dark Lord said surprised, his mood shifting incredibly fast realizing the dark was calling to me. This was what he wanted. An empath that was at his command, it was his ultimate dream realized.
I expected the holidays to go by slowly staying at the castle, but they flew by so rapidly I barely had time to catch my breath before school started back up. Mainly it was trying to find ways to destroy the diadem and pocket watch, but I also spent quite a bit of time just relaxing with Harry and Draco.
"Indeed. Well, she's fine, but she will need to take it easy for a few days. She seemed more upset about that then having almost died." Poppy said with a disproving risk before leaving, giving Hermione one last warning not to overdo it, even though we all knew she would ignore it.
"Is that a challenge?" He asked raising and eyebrow making to move away. I grabbed him by the shirt I was unbuttoned pulling him back in.
"Your right. I...I touched them." The cruciatus curse hit me hard, his anger intensifying the curse to an almost immeasurable degree. I curled down into myself holding back the scream that so desperately wanted to come out.
“That’s awesome. What did you say?” I asked sitting on my bed beside her that I didn’t sleep in enough. She brushed her red hair behind her ear looking way too young to be dating. She was fifteen though I shouldn’t be too surprised.
I could feel her light magic swirling with mine, an addictive substance that seemed so different from mine that its presence couldn’t be denied.
“Just leave Granger.” I snapped briskly, turning to go make breakfast not wanting to discuss things further. She laughed softly and left, leaving me alone once again.
I also mused why Snape wasn't addressing what happened at all. He seemed quite content to ignore it and pretend everything was normal. It wasn't. I didn't know if I wanted to talk about things, but it would be nice if he offered at least.
I tried to take off running, but Igor and Yaxley grabbed me roughly and I was pinned against the wall in seconds. I had no wand since it was in my clothes before I transformed and I had no pockets in my dress. I was screwed.
"Perhaps." I said vaguely, wanting to get on edge because he was there, but the spiked wine kept me fully relaxed in the best of ways. His dark gaze lingered on me knowingly.
He had a dozen cereals, it was like my paradise. I couldn't decide which one looked better, they all looked delicious.
“So, how do I do that?” He waved me out of my seat and removed his cloak, rolling up his sleeves. I caught a glimpse of his dark mark, but I tried not to stare. He had never shown it before to me, but it looked rather hot much to my dismay. I shouldn’t have thought that over such a dark tattoo so I tried to block out my thoughts on it and focus.
Harry had told me that he thought Snape was a death eater and mean to keep his cover, but I didn’t believe that for a second. My mood was already sour from tiredness and dealing with the Slytherins bullying me on the way to class since I walked alone instead of with Harry.
"I don't know what you mean." I said dismissively drinking the disgusting blood replenishing potion then savoring the pain relieving one, drinking that one more slowly.
Mine was almost ready, but I stared down into the simmering pot considering my chances. They never combined potions and spell work, it was explicitly taboo. I shouldn’t even try it and I knew Snape would kill me if he found out I did it. I bit my lip nervously before gathering up courage.
"What were you REALLY doing down here? I know you weren't sneaking around with a boy, so come on. Spill it!" He said changing topic, which was fine by me. The less I worried about the death eaters, the better.
"Can you let us pass Professor?" I said with no small amount of snark annoyed at his existence. I wanted to hate him which was hard when he was around me making it hard to think straight. Him not existing would be wonderful. He raised an eyebrow and I realized too late he was reading my thoughts. Crap.
“Truly.” He murmured running his finger on his lip thoughtfully. I had expected him to yell at me love didn’t exist or was just for the weak, but he seemed to agree. I scrubbed the cauldron with slightly less angry energy, my mind swirling with confusion on what to make of him as opposed to worry about not dying.
"Anyways what's up with you lovebirds. I'm surprised your dad didn't kill you coming in with Harry." I said ready to get my mind off Snape. Draco laughed and looked Harry up and down wantonly.
He pushed me into a warm bedroom that looked much like his office rooms and stalked to me with a deadly look in his eyes. I was scared, yet I wanted to see more of him without control.
"Umm...not really." I said trying not to sound suspicious. Her eyes flew to me immediately picking up on my high pitched tone.
“With each spell that exists, there is generally a breakdown that happens.  A suffix and prefix. Levicorpus, Levi meaning levitate, and corpus meaning body.” He explained smoothly, the firelight seeming to flicker in just the right way to make him full of life.
"Nothing. I think it's one of those things you will know when it happens. Or maybe not. I don't think I have read much on empaths since most of their history was scratched out when they were killed off." The headmaster said rubbing his temple showing an uncharacteristic sign of stress. I had to get her to Voldemort's side to save her life, but could I do it without turning her dark? If I bonded with her would she take on my darkness also? Would I be responsible for ruining her and bringing into civilization a dark being worse than Voldemort?
"She hasn't commented. I think she just assumes I have some sort of special skill." I said with a sarcastic chuckle.
“Where is here?” I quirked my head unsure of how to reply. Why would my own mind be so worried about where I was? It was aggravating to say the least.
"I'm looking for something obviously. What are you doing?" I asked, falling into pace beside him yawning widely. I didn't even know what time it was.
I walked outside , the weight of my actions filling me with regret. I would do anything to make it up to her.
Her body called to me like no woman’s had before. If I could have developed the perfect woman for me, I couldn’t have come even close to how much I obsessed over her every curve. The soft smile on her face, the way her intelligent eyes held such depth that was lacking in most women. She wasn’t a normal witch at all.
It wasn't signed, but it didn't need to be signed. I wiped away my tears trying to stop them from ruining the small parchment note. It was a cold reminder of where the future would take us.
"Severus, that's not how...I don't know why you would think...there just wasn't enough evidence to pursue." The judge said adjusting his glasses with a nervous smile.
We got to the front doors and froze. There he was. Standing against the side of the front doors, shaking and pale as death. His eyes locked with mine and I felt my heart leap.
"You realize now he will want you to spy on me…right." Harry said sharing a concerned glance with me.
"Leave her alone, it was me! She didn't do anything." Harry said angrily shoving the Dark Lord away and standing in between us, always the valiant knight. I knew what was going to happen a split second before it did, but I watched in slow motion, my horror building seeing the green curse hit him squarely in the chest.
“Misunderstood what? She had her tongue down the imbeciles throat!” I retorted hotly. He rolled his eyes and gave me his trademark smile.
"Hermione!" The name woke me out of my trance and I realized Professor Lupin had been calling my name for some time. He sighed dramatically.
It was snowing fast and furious and I could barely see a foot in front of me in the darkness. I had no idea if she had gotten through the long walk from the gates or not to leave, or if she was lost somewhere here.
“I see. Thank you Dobby. I learned something new today.” I said patting him kindly on the head. The other house elves excitedly jumped up and down gathering around for me to pat their heads too. I laughed and obliged them unable to deny their adorableness.
Their value had to be more than 100,000 gallons, but where he got this money was a mystery. He certainly didn't earn it from teaching, that was for sure. Not to mention the manor was in the millions of gallons, it was expansive and well cared for in a way that put Malfoy manor to shame.
Or was she? She had blatantly gone through my dark arts books without permission and had seemed drawn to it in an obsessive way that I couldn't quite pinpoint.
"That is the most intelligent thing I've ever heard a drunk person say." I admitted letting my hand grasp her waist to stabilize her so she wouldn't fall on me. Her smile was infectious.
My mind ran through the possibilities and I knew this had to do with my magic consuming her. It would pull her to the dark and wouldn't relent until she went full dark. My worst nightmare.
"You too then? Why does EVERYONE think I'm into that? I'm literally spending every waking moment trying to fight the Dark Lord." She said with tears starting, her feelings quite hurt. I sighed loudly pulling her to me again, this time successfully.
I walked back to him and laid down nervously on the couch next to him. I wasn’t about to sleep in his bed without permission and the couch was more than large enough for us to share. I worried he would get mad, but he stirred slightly and pulled me up to him tightly, his arms winding around me perfectly.
"Luckily Neville's family is rich so I will be able to hire a maid to do my housework." Ginny said only slightly teasing. I knew she would do it in a second.
We had a late lunch then were off to a double potions. Today was the first quarter benchmark and we would be brewing our final batch of our personally developed potions for grading. It should be easy enough for me since I had perfected mine weeks ago. Harry was still struggling to get the timing down for his healing potion that sealed wounds. Right now it just made the wound mucky and sizzle a bit.
The first day back was a Monday so not only did I have potions, but I had my training afterwards. I hadn't made any progress really trying to create my own spells. It was as if my magic was so used to following the rules that it just refused to disobey them.
“No, he’s just…I don’t feel that way about him. Harry is just…different.” I stammered trying to explain it without seeming like I was turning my back on my own friend. I liked Ron, but when it came down to it, Harry would take priority.
"Maybe that's exactly what I want." I said unabashed slowly unbuttoning his cloak. He looked like he wanted to stop me, but his more impure impulses took over and one of his hands trailed up my thigh under my dress.
"Of course you are. You are my hero. Just hold on a bit longer please." I begged him sobbing trying to calm down enough to think of a counter curse or way to fix the curse he was struck with. It was essentially a slow moving death curse that guaranteed a slow painful death.
"Aren't we going to practice deflecting?" I asked confused as the class hurriedly filed out of the classroom talking in hushed whispered.
Ability to change how magic responds to new spells. Normal witches and wizards had to work within the confines that empaths set for magic control
"Severus, I hope there's a good reason for Christmas dinner being interrupted today?" The judge said with a drawn out sigh, rubbing the temple of his forehead annoyed.
"You forgot to chop the Lady's mantle before adding! She's paralyzed!" Draco shouted realizing what happened before I could.
“It’s everything.” He gave no further explanation and swept out handing the book to the old cashier who I only then realized had a full view of our interaction. I couldn’t have blushed deeper if I tried. I grabbed one of the transfiguration books I had been interested in a few weeks ago and took it to the counter to pay.
“Get the headmaster.” I whispered setting down Granger tenderly on the couch in my rooms next to the fireplace. Potter flooed the headmaster as soon as he got back in the building surprisingly put together for the situation. The moment we were at Hogwarts again all of his anger was gone and I only then realized the drama in front of the Dark Lord was a show.
“Ow! Okay women. Bloody hell.” He said gruffly, still following me like an obedient puppy. We walked in a quick silence for a while and I assumed we wouldn’t talk at all which was fine by me until he broke the silence.
I couldn't find any modern day references to it though and had no idea how to even start looking for it.
"Exactly." He said pointedly, squeezing my waist a bit, his eyes drifting over my body, his mind back to a very dirty place.
"Severus. Up." He hissed looking down on me from his throne. I obediently got up and looked at him trying to read his mood. Sometimes he would just start torturing with little to no reason when he was in a bad mood. Today though he seemed calm looking at me thoughtfully toying with his wand.
"POPPY!" I called barging in, the doors slamming open in front of me. She rushed from her office in her gown looking disheveled and exhausted, but she perked up quickly seeing Hermione.
"The plan? You intended to make me fall for you. I'm just one of your pawns aren't I? Forget the headmasters plans. You're the real game player here, aren't you?" I said horrified, taking a step back realizing I was being played. He was absolutely brilliant. I didn't even see it coming. The headmaster at least was obvious in his games.
"I want everyone to redo the beautification potion you were working on before break." I said sharply flicking my wand at the board showing the instructions for everyone to work off of incase they were idiotic and forgot their book.
"HOW DARE YOU DEFILE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL, INNOCENT SOUL YOU DISGUSTING LEECH." She yelled full of a fire I didn't even know she possessed.
I couldn’t do such a thing. Ask him to kiss me? I didn’t want him to kiss me. That’s was preposterous. Insanity. Yet the way his breath tickled my cheek, his fingers threading into my hair waiting…anticipating my request.
"If you don't mind, can we proceed to the trial? I have things to attend to tonight." Severus said impatiently. The judge nodded pulling out some parchment to read off of.
I relaxed letting him pull my dress down, melting into his ministrations easily. His hands explored my body somehow knowing exactly where to go to please me. I couldn't deny that thoughts of his kiss hadn't kept me up at night on more than one occasion. Many potions classes had been spent remembering how right it felt and daydreaming about the next time he would kiss me.
Could he though? It was almost as if Malfoy Sr. knew I would be there. I didn't know how, but he didn't seem that surprised to see me. Snape seemed genuinely surprised to see him, but even Voldemort seemed only mildly shocked at my presence. Almost as if he was waiting for me.
I ignored him for the next week unwilling to let myself be at his mercy. I even skipped Potions class which I never did just to avoid him. I would gladly take the failing grade just to have some semblance of control back. I wasn’t Hermione Granger the slut who was obsessed with men. I was Hermione Granger, the book worm who needed to find a way to protect herself so no one could ever put me in the same position as Malfoy had.
“It’s no fun if she doesn’t scream.” One of the death eaters said depressed. I didn’t recognize his voice, but then again everything was like I was viewing someone else’s life now, not my own.
I got up and put on his shirt since I couldn't find my dress and padded out of the room trying to find where he wandered off to. After a bit of exploring I found myself back in the dinning room where the party was.
"Now, now there Snape. She was just tryin' to get some potions ingredients. No need to get so worked up." Hagrid said giving me a wink so I could slink away while he talked with him.
I was at home. I wanted to hate the death eaters and everything they stood for, but I could see myself also being happy here. A family. Light conversation that was filled with happiness. It called to me in a way that I had never expected and I knew tomorrow I would feel a deep gash knowing what I couldn't have.
“He wanted to know why the feeling of her magic was weaker around me, not stronger. He was unpleased.” I explained not wanting to go into detail about the hour of torture I endured. The headmaster nodded understanding. He got up and poured some bourbon in my drink for me.
"You know he killed your father then gave you a memento and your just...okay with this?" I said aghast at his coldness. He shrugged nonchalantly.
"What are you doing Granger?" I dropped my cereal box shocked and I turned around fast almost loosing balance. Snap was standing there still in his death eater robes, no mask though thankfully, arms folded and his displeasure evident in his glare.
I stormed through the halls barely containing my anger at the idiotic brunette that was ruining all my plans.
“Well with my job its unwise for me to have a relationship.” I said staunchly. I knew it was more than that though.
She was pale and a mess from the cruciatis and then me running my hands into her hair passionately pulling her into me. When I got back to my rooms I sat beside Granger and carefully brushed her hair out of her face. She was an angel compared to me and I had done the most wicked of deeds to her. And wanted more. I was fucked up. Even remembering the way she leaned onto my chest while I fucked her was enough to have me ready for another round. She was passed out and I had no business ever touching her again.
"You have done well bringing the Granger girl to me. I was hoping Lucius would take the hints and bring her, but I anticipated it being harder than it was. He said she was in your office when he arrived." He said surprising me in more than one way. He had planned her being kidnapped? It was a setup?
I sat down and watched her work for a solid hour trying to get her stable. Finally at last Hermione gasped suddenly and her eyes fluttered open. I let out a breath of relief glad I hadn't killed her with my idiocy.
"You can?" I asked excited enough at the possibility of having the horcrux that I didn't mind the exhaustion.
I was sure I was in one of my nightmares. She couldn't be lifeless on the floor pale as death not breathing. Not my Hermione. It wasn't real, I was sure of it.
"I've never heard of anyone telling him no." I mused. He yawned and stretched out not caring in the slightest if he were caught.
"Of course. You have a whole monarchy to plan." I said with a snort of amusement at the thought of him trying to create a whole new government system by himself. I was sure Dumbledore would help, but he was the brains of their plan it seemed.
“Not one that was good looking. It’s a good thing too, I was starting to wonder if I wasn’t straight or something. Definitely straight.” She teased with a smirk. I released her abruptly realizing where she was going with that.
"Thirsty? You mean I'm with him for his looks?" I asked, confused. I was sure she didn't mean thirty for more wine.
I had taught Veelas before and had no trouble keeping my thoughts straight. With her though, my mind knew how soft her kiss was. How sweetly and innocently she played into my whims. So strong, and yet she melted just like ice on a hot day.
He opened his mouth to retort, but quickly closed it unable to figure out what to say. I had made him speechless finally.
"Well, obviously. His personality is dark and nothing like yours. What other reason could you have for liking him? Don't think I'm judging you, we all have tried our chances with him here. He's quite the looker, isn't he?" She said bemused glancing at Snape with a look that betrayed her own thirst.
“That’s impossible. I was the one casting the spell. I was showing you how to do it correctly.” He said twirling his wand absently. My mind started to reel realizing what I felt.
“Goodnight Miss. Granger.” He said dismissing me. I wanted to stay and see where this was headed, but whatever direction things had started to head was clearly gone. I left quietly walking back to my rooms toying with the magic I could feel swirl around me teasingly.
I didn’t even get to counting to ten in my head, he was out like a light.  I couldn’t sleep. I had studying to do now that he was asleep. I waited until the headmaster left before setting my sights on Snape’s massive collection of books. Most of his books were old and covered dark subjects, which was exactly what I needed.
"Drop him now!" She demanded. I didn't remember what they screamed at each other next, but within seconds my fathers fist made its way to her face and she crumpled up defeated on the floor.
"I'm happy you're awake. I was worried you would sleep forever. Not that your tiredness isn't expected, all things considered." He said happily coming to the bedside looking me up and down curiously.
"You aren't dead you foolish girl. I'm just alive. You're still healing, you need to lay down." He explained calmly as if people rose from the dead all the time.
“I wasn’t flirting. My potion is simmering CLEARLY.” I said not in the mood to be the well behaved Gryffindor right then. I normally would simper to his every whim, but just couldn’t bring myself to. The class turned to me shocked and I heard a whisper go around the room. Snape’s eyes darkened dangerously and I saw him change his mood from annoyed to dangerous fast.
My body ached for more than just a kiss, my desire for her was building with each say and her showing she wanted to be with me was enough to test my capabilities of restraining myself. The kiss was hot and intense and sadly far too short. She pulled back panting, slightly out of breath and her smile intoxicating.
"If people want to talk. Let them talk. They can arrest me. I haven't broken any laws. Even if I did, I would just buy my way out of it. It would be worth every cent." I said coldly not ready to negotiate on this. I expected him to argue more and refuse to give in, but to my surprise he sat back with a genuine smile.
"Miss. Granger, you should know better than to be sneaking around outside the grounds at this time of the night. Holiday or not." He snarled, grabbing me roughly by my arm and shoving me inside. I only then realized Hagrid was outside coming to us curiously.
"Trying to what?" I pressed harshly, having a hard time holding back with her. Some part of my brain told me to hold back, I would regret hurting her, but the other part wanted her to fear me and the dark magic she stole from me.
"Why would you search for that cursed object? You're already the smartest person I know. No need to go searching for more intelligence. Remember, everything comes at a cost." He said harshly, assuming I wanted it for myself.
We were barely touching, yet the intimacy of the moment was vividly apparent. The small smile she had was simply divine. Lost in love. Even my expression was calm and happy. I had just saved her from dying, it was a moment of weakness, but that picture managed to capture my heart on my sleeve. I felt the air in my throat catch remembering how I felt in that moment.
"Careful what you ask for Hermione. If we continue I might not be able to stop." He said with a dark grin, kissing me again deeper and more demanding pulling me to him giving no escape.
“Any specific reason for your insolence today Miss Granger?” Snape asked after about an hour of my work. I chanced a glance at him and surprisingly he seemed calm and was watching me almost curiously.
“Neither one would tell me!” Professor McGonagall complained frustrated by our silence on the walk over.
I was fine with that and leapt up from the bed throwing myself into his arms relief of magnitudes I had never understood flooding through me.
"Come in Elijah, let's talk." I said kicking myself mentally and shutting the door warding it from lurkers.
I almost became my father. I took a deep breath letting my hand fall down by my side lamely. She looked at me bewildered at my hesitation and I was sure I had been standing there for some time frozen.
"Common Harry, we should give the lovebirds a moment to make up. Try not to kill each other eh?" Draco said sarcastically leading Harry out after helping Hermione up, so it was just her and I left.
I drank and felt a warm flush that helped ease my gitters at being seated at a table of death eaters.
He pulled up a chair and sat beside me and cast two wandless spells to ensure our privacy I assumed before turning to me.
I indulged in the pain and let it consume me. I didn't have the love of my life anymore. I was alone and it was all my fault. I had doubted him and wasted precious time we could have been enjoying together letting him be mad about such a stupid thing.
"You took it to wear it?" He said with more annoyance than anger. I looked up at him regretfully feeling the tears welling up in my eyes.
I didn't know what to do with the diadem, Ginny wasn't here for the holidays thankfully but I knew she would have even less control than I had. I couldn't let her be around it, so it had to be destroyed within the next two weeks.
"Let me have this one night Miss. Granger." He said formally, leading me to the table. The meal was an Italian pasta in a beautifully sweet red sauce, one of my favorites and something they never served at Hogwarts.
"He is going to be pissed." She said a bit sympathetically for me. I tried to steady my breathing knowing the chances of the ONE time we had sex causing a pregnancy couldn't be very high at all.
“Why did he torture you?” I asked curious what could have made him so angry. I could tell he didn’t want to answer. He was a private person and never answered any question that was more than surface level deep.
"That's a pity. Unfortunately in war there are sacrifices." The Headmaster said only glancing to me for a brief moment.
“That’s enough, no need to make a spectacle. Mr. Wesley you need to go to the infirmary. Miss Granger, straight to the Headmasters office. I have never seen such a barbaric…” I zoned out not caring about her ranting. I felt better than I had in days. I was tired of people deciding what would happen to me in life. I had at least made one decision in life and that was to make sure Ron never insulted me again.
The Dark Lord waved his hand and a mirror appeared and he took in his youthfulness touching each part of his body fascinated by the changes.
I wouldn’t live past the war though. Even in my dreams, I wasn’t there. She was there, alone. Happy without me.
"I can't believe I almost killed her." I said taking a few calming breaths just realizing how worked up I had gotten now that she was okay.
"Oh? You didn't tell her what you were up to yesterday? Funny, I don't think I've ever actually arrested you when you were entertaining a woman before. I've heard the rumors about you being a womanizer and all, but thought they were all nonsense." He said more to Severus than me. Severus just rolled his eyes but smirked a bit, not seeming at all bothered by being arrested.
"The back and forth! One moment I'm ignoring you, the next you're angry at me for nothing. It's like we're two planets rotating around each other, magnetic and attracting the other but unable to touch." She explained stumbling a bit with just standing still, but her explanation was absolutely perfect.
"What about you Granger?" I questioned turning my attention to Hermione. Her smile was back and the confidence I loved so much blazed fiercely.
The Headmaster and Minerva had started a conversation about gardening that I toned out so my focus was just on her.
"Do you ever hear yourself? The Dark Lord? What, are you joining his side or something? Ron was right about you all this time." She said disgustedly. I hadn't even noticed my slip. Apparently I was really spending too much time with Snape. She turned on her heels and stomped off before I could stop her.
"I'm afraid it does look like he has been pulling the strings. I suppose for now there's nothing we can do but go along with his plan. He will kill you otherwise. We just have to hope she doesn't become obsessed with the dark side and can keep up the ruse as just a ruse." He said sullen at the very thought that we were powerless right now.
“Why don’t you want to be set free?” I asked them curiously. I had tried to free them for so long, but they just seemed terrified of it.
I tried to force the curse off of myself, desperate for some relief, but he only intensified the pain with every attempt, his scream audible vaguely from my distorted place in my mind.
I wouldn’t be going with anyone again. Of course I would be alone, I always was. I had no time to socialize just trying to find a way to end a war that I didn’t want to exist and hoping I didn’t get kidnapped again for a madman’s amusement.
"Why would you need to work? He makes more than enough money for you to never have to lift a finger your entire life." She said as if she thought I was daft.
I sighed deeply, the day having taken a bad turn before it could even really start. By the time I had gotten to breakfast she had evidently told Ron who was glaring at me again, and Harry who seemed more concerned than angry. I didn't even bother sitting down, I grabbed a roll and left for my first class which was Herbology.
It was nothing like Snape. It was cold and unyielding. He was harsh and I had never been more disgusted in my life, even when Ron had kissed me.
“Perhaps there’s something she fears more than pain. I can’t imagine someone like her has gotten around much.” Malfoy Sr. said eagerly to get his hands on me. I had little doubt that was his plan from the beginning. Voldemort appeared to consider and came over pushing me with his shoe making sure I was still alive.
"Ignore her, she suffers from a poor memory. I plead guilty." He said, giving me a glare to shut up.
I expected him to have me appearate to Malfoy manor, but he pulled me away suddenly when we got out of the gates and we spun rapidly together.
“Winnefred.” Harry said to the fat lady going into the warm Gryffindor common room thoughtfully. Ginny was still waiting up reading a book and brightened up seeing us.
I sent a quick patronus to the Headmaster to let him know I couldn’t cover my classes before going through the familiar routine of going to the Dark Lords throne room.
“You need to eat. Lord knows if you die everyone will blame me even though its your own idiotic fault.” He said with an annoyed sigh leaving momentarily to get me something from his drawer. A granola bar. I took it hesitantly wondering what the chances of him killing me with poison would be at Hogwarts itself.
“You rarely ever talk back. It’s unlike you.” He said with what could be viewed as something resembling concern if I didn’t know he was a cold selfish bastard. I just scrubbed the cauldron harder.
"You and me both." She said quietly obviously having had similar thoughts as well, a silence falling on us for a long moment.
“I’m taking her. Potter your welcome to stay and be tortured of course, but I rather think Granger should be your first priority.”
"I...I have no idea what you're talking about." I stammered shaking my head. He let out a pent up scream just inches from my face.
"Hermione isn't dark right? She helps me with my homework a lot. I wont get dark if I practice spells with her, right?" Elijah said, unsurely putting down his books. He was only a second year, but he was far more mature than most second years. I went to my desk sitting down defeated and poured myself a whiskey.
“Fine. Go ahead. Make it quick though.” I said reluctantly slowing down my pace of walking so he didn’t have to race to keep up.
“I need some thistle elixir and you know Professor Snape has never liked me much. Harry mentioned you had detention with him today so I was hoping you could get some for me, just say its for sum potion your working on.” Hagrid asked nervously as if we hadn’t been friends for years. I relaxed instantly.
He grabbed me by my waist and put me on the bed roughly, kissing my neck gently trailing kisses access my skin. Every inch that he touched felt alive in a way that was scandalous and yet so addictive. I wanted more.
"What the hell is wrong with me?" I muttered to myself angry I was feeling anything but hatred for him. He was a selfish jerk who had used me for his own good. He could have fought Malfoy Sr. on the idea to go.
"The last time we talked didn't go so well either. I'm not bringing it up." I said decisively not wanting to bother him with what I was sure was nothing. I had a whole war to worry about anyways.
"I need to fatten you up. You're nothing but skin and bones. You can't carry my baby like that." He said squeezing my side playfully. I choked a bit on my food remembering what Bellatrix said.
“In what? Sex ed?” He said with amusement. The comment stung a bit. I had crossed the line more than I should have. I felt slightly guilty, yet a larger part of me felt no guilt at all. Fuck them. They wanted me to spy, and I have done my job perfectly. I was the reason they were still alive with a fighting chance. They should be appreciative.
The hushed whispers flowed through the room shock I had actually managed to change him. I couldn't stop myself from smiling a bit arrogantly at my own power.
