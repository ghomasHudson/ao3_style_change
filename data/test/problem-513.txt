"I'll let him know. Michael was dragged into something similar back where he grew up so he knows what that's like for Aby. I do hope you come back for more work and maybe you'll let me fix you up with a piercing or two," she winks.
“Thanks for the offer to have Michael do it, but honestly I’ll just move it to another day,” he chooses, feel a bit dejected. “I don’t know what happened,” he begins, feeling the need to talk to someone about it since his friends don’t know about Malfoy, and if he brought up even his name, Ron and Hermione would give each other a knowing look Harry wasn’t fond of. “We both wound up at the same bar Friday night and ended up walking out together. We talked, I called him out for avoiding me, I mentioned his mum and he ended up saying that he didn’t want me to waste my time with...someone like him,” he paraphrases, the epithet ringing in his ear.
“It wasn’t a problem. I genuinely enjoyed working on your piece. If you ever need more art or a recommendation for a muggle artist feel free to come back to the shop,” Aby offers, as he begins to clean up his station.
"By worse I meant scarier than walking into a sex shop and asking for some magical toys. Things like killing a megalomaniac, killing a basilisk, dealing with my godfather in Potions," he lists, letting himself enjoy the banter between him and Potter, as if they hadn’t been yelling at each other less than 20 minutes ago.
"Goodness knows with him. If he's in bed already it won't matter," he shrugs, not paying any attention to the hand holding as they walk along the street.
"I just want a tattoo, and from my homework I learned most shops had portfolios and flash so I thought I’d pick something out here and I did," he continues, impressing Aby with his knowledge of the basic vocabulary.
As Aby descends the stairs to the basement he catches sight of Potter leaning against a wall, talking to a couple, enjoying the conversation and a drink. Catching Harry’s eye to check in with him, he sees his friend is alright and goes back to the crowd waiting for the next band to start.
“Well it can be if I’m actually being poisoned. Tonight, I get to be dosed by three poisons by Jane to see if her detection charm works right. I have antidotes, believe me. And a bezoar just in case.”
“Sorry, sorry. I wasn’t even aware you knew what a Tesco was,” Harry replies, a little surprised.
“I’m not drunk,” Harry scoffs, rolling his eyes before getting up to wander over to the small kitchen. He finds Aby staring at the kettle, waiting for it to boil, and places his hands on his hips. “Are you sure all you want to do is cuddle?”
Aby walks back to the front desk, writing down the session in the charge book and opening the schedule for his next week or so.
"I am saying fucking it and forgetting about it Jane! Or at least trying to. But it's complicated..."
"So stay for breakfast, let me get a proper meal in you before you go back to work tomorrow. Then owl the shop this week if you want the patronus tattoo soon. I'm interested in working that charm out," he says and wanders back to the kitchen to make breakfast for them.
“Two whole weeks? Merlin, how are you still alive?” Harry gasps sarcastically. “Try three months, Aby. I’m in a bit of a dry spell unfortunately.”
"No I don't mind. I've shared a bed with plenty of friends just because that's all the space there was. Also sometimes because cuddling is great," he adds, walking towards his room and gesturing for Harry to follow.
“Look, I just wouldn’t even know what to ask for,” he insists. “Not all of us have had the experiences that you apparently have if you can just go in there and ask for what you want, Aby,” he teases.
“Is your husband going to be joining us Jane? I don’t think I’ve met him yet from coming into the shop,” he asks as she returns from the small kitchen with two packs of beer, wanting to change the subject from Luke’s observation.
Harry doesn’t know how to respond, but turns his head a bit and catches sight of the record player in the corner. He doesn’t know much about muggle record players, but he knows enough that they don’t lend themselves to mixes.
“Liam goes by they. I’ll explain pronouns more another day but just go with it.”
“I am Jane, how sweet of you to remember,” she says, taking the younger man in. “How are you today Auror Potter?”
“Why is it complicated?” Luke asks, beckoning him over to the couch with him and Jane, used to communal cuddle piles.
“Well however it happened, I’m happy for you. You seem to have a talent.”
"I was with just Marley for a bit. And there have been times where I've gone out on dates with a guy a few times in a row, but I haven't found anyone that makes me want to settle down," he shrugs. "I don't really need to and if it was with a muggle I'd have to give up a lot. Though I certainly considered snapping my wand once or twice and just integrate into the muggle world."
"Give it time. Tattoos are addicting believe me. I even thought of another one for you if you ever want to add,” he muses and lead him out the front door, grabbing his coat and wallet as he goes, checking for muggle bills.
"Well I don't know you life,” he points out, laying his hand back on Potter’s bicep to keep shading.
"I wasn’t this good at first as Luke can attest to, but I've gotten better over the years. Cooking is like potions in a way so it was a transferable skill after some practice."
“He...he told me my family had me declared dead and I knew that would be the case but...it was hard to hear. And, he offered to reach out to my mother for me and goodness knows I don't need that sort of upheaval in my life...and if I get found. It's bad enough.”
Harry laughs and rolls his eyes, shaking his head at him. “I don’t want that though. I’ve had enough of being treated like I’m some weird god. I just want a relationship that’s an equal partnership honestly. If frequent sex comes as part of the package that would be ideal, but not needed.”
Once inside the house, Aby walked them straight to the kitchen to deposit their booze and Draco began to scan the crowd for people he knew.  Making himself a strong drink, Harry stood beside Aby, and before he knew it he was being introduced to one person after another.
Harry blushes at the obvious flirt, and just smiles at her. “So what does Malfoy have to do with the charms?”
"I wasn't in the mood to put in an effort beyond 'why yes I know you and know you're fun in bed, want to shag?' so there's that. Besides, nothing a wank can't fix," he shrugs, vanishing the butt of his cigarette and stepping out of the alley.
"Yes, well, at least I got enough of it from Severus to know my father's actions we not the norm.”
“Well do I need to take you to bed now to make up for it?,” Harry asks with a cheeky grin, his eyes following Malfoy around the room despite talking to Luke.
Aby smirks and pulls up his shirt to show the blossoms of narcissus that bloom over his chest and up to his collarbone.
“Oh that’s okay, I’m a little early despite thinking I was going to be late, so I don’t mind hanging around the shop,” he assures.
“Good night Harry.”
Aby balks. "You just said last time that you saw her from time to time. I just thought you meant a casual chat and wave if you passed each other in Diagon…”
“Well consider yourself lucky. Maybe I should come hang out here more often since the news doesn’t seem to reach here,” he muses.
“So how many tattoos do you have? I can only see a few,” he inquires, watching Malfoy eat and look over his notes.
“Sorry, my artistic sensibility is getting the best of me. Never pleased with my work,” Aby tries to cover, before letting go of Harry’s arm.
Aby walks him out of the station and into quieter part of the city, knowing the route to Will's house well. Stopping in for some food, he pays for them both informing Potter he could get the alcohol, and leans against the counter with him, eating the vinegary goodness. "So how was your week?"
"I thought I did until I saw a muggle artist in action. My main chest piece isn't magical. My ex did it for me actually. Michael sent me to a shop he was working at to apprentice for a bit. Owner was a squib and lucky for me, Marley, my ex, has a sister who is a witch," he explains getting a hair tie from his dresser to knot his hair up again.
"Potter your history indicates otherwise," Aby points out, remembering each time in school Potter ran head first into something.
“First off, stop moving unless you want to ruin this piece. Second, no. Our tattoos don’t detect poison, but Jane has been experimenting with charmed piercings for safety, and the latest is detecting poison through a charmed piercing,” he explains and sticks out his tongue to show Harry his piercing, before dipping his wand into the ink again.
“This is going to be wicked once it’s all done,” Harry compliments, still staring at the ink as Malfoy leaves the room.

“You’d go to bed with Luke if he wasn’t straight?”
"Because people will find me, first off. Then people will remind him of who I was, and how I'm no good for him, second. So it doesn’t matter if I’d be happier if he was more than a friend. Right now friend is enough."
Aby looks up a little taken aback by the rushed tone, his mouth agape enough that Harry can see the ball holding the ring bar in place. He closes his mouth and thinks for a moment. “I have about eight between my face and ears, and a few more elsewhere…”
“It’s been less than a day. Now sit and let me show you what I have done. I don't think we can start today but if you like the design we can go write you down in the book - it’ll be after hours mind you," he added.
Aby dips his wand as Potter strips, and once he lays out, Aby start pricking his skin, starting at the snitch. He dots the anchors over Potter’s body, tracing a magical line between each point, giving the snitch it’s map. He has to keep a steady hand, making sure that nothing strays from the intended path. Once he gets down to his left foot he works his way up the right leg, using his navel as a central point for his lower body. Soon enough he’s having Potter turn over, repeating the process on his backside until the web is placed. With a final tap of his wand, his web disappears, the ink settling into Potter’s skin.
Settling into the gentle hum that comes from the wand, Harry begins to let his mind relax, and feels himself unwind in the chair, despite the minor pain. He comes to only when he hears someone walk into the station.
"No, only the mild pain potion from earlier I’m afraid. Don’t feel particularly keen on you passing out or worse,” he drawls, looking up at Potter, who looks confused. “I can’t have you block the pain entirely because I need to know how your body is handling it. Things like shock, low blood sugar, or just a bad reaction can happen with more than a mild potion. I need to be able to monitor you,” he explains, remembering the lessons from his ex, a muggle tattoo artist.
"Oh yes! I was able to get six charms into one piercing!” Jane exclaims, but seeing Harry’s confused face, she clarifies. “You see these earrings?” she says as she motions to the case below her. Most have some kind of charm in them. Some simple, some more complex. Anything from protection, translation, to some cheeky and sexy,” she winks.
Out in the front, Harry walks to the counter, feeling dejected. “Hey Jane, I need to pay. He’s done. How much for the last session?,” he asks, barely sparing her a glance as he opens his wallet and begins counting out money. He wants nothing more than to go back in there and demand that this not end now. Problem was, he doesn’t even know what this is. The blonde has given him no indication that he wants to be friends, all Harry knows was that he really likes spending time with him and being rejected fucking sucks.
“Well during the war I learned the Tale of the Three Brotehrs is certainly not a tale. I encountered, the stone, wand, and cloak - the cloak I still have actually - and I most certainly used it to greet Death like an old friend.”
"Leo, Matthew this is Harry. Just finished a tattoo on him a few weeks ago and he didn't entirely annoy me on the chair," he begins as an introduction, eyeing Matthew a bit.
“He does have a talent. I’m really, really glad I came to see him,” Harry replies honestly, as he pulls out his wallet for this session’s payment, and another tip.
“There’s nothing wrong with that though…” he trails off, even though he knows Grimmauld Place was in a more than respectable area. “Do you live with roommates then? You mentioned you had the flat alone to yourself tonight.”
"That because I fuck some of my friends I fuck all of them..."
Soon enough, Aby was done with the main snitch. Lathering a healing ointment over the piece and wrapping it, he taps Potter to let him know it was done, as the other man had clearly zoned out.
“So you never told me where we’re going?”
"Yes I dated a muggle Potter."
Shaking himself out of shock, he clears his throat nervously, and answers the question the man behind the desk had asked as he entered. “I, erm, I have an appointment.”
Harry raises his eyebrows as Malfoy said he had been thinking of one for him. “I will admit that I am already itching for another, so what were you thinking,” he asks, following him outside and down the street.
“I don't have a muggle mobile so I won't be able to do much with a number," he shrugs, taking his gloves off. "Just watch out for my mother will you?” he asks, before Potter leaves his station and the shop.
"He just stayed the night after we drank too much at a party," Aby explains, as he starts the coffee, making sure it’s enough for three.  "It was one of those basement shows at Will's, you know how it goes," he shrugs and roots around in the fridge for two vials of hangover potion, tossing one to Harry.
"Well that was fruitless. I guess I should have told you that when you flirt, focus on the right man."
"I don't know..." Aby finally says, his voice raspy. "I don't know if I still want you around, because I don't know if I can trust you or if I ever want that old life again even if it means my mother. I hated myself back then, even more than I do now and that's saying something."
"So did you come with anyone again tonight?" Aby inquires.
Aby stops in his tracks. "You know that isn't just information you tell people casually. Perhaps under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but not simply as if it's a fun fact Potter. Merlin I swear this explains so many things," he mutters, trying to wrap his mind around this.
When the blonde looks at Harry with an artfully arched brow, there was no doubt in Harry’s mind who he was talking to. Seeing a scowl form on Draco’s mouth as he scans the ledger, he realizes Draco must have spotted Harry’s name - and only his first name - as he’d asked to keep the last name off in case it caused unnecessary fanfare, or in this case, a very awkward encounter.
Aby tries not to watch as Harry leaves. "You like him," Jane say once the door closes.
“Not at all the norm,” Harry agrees and pulls the blonde a bit closer, looking up at him again. “I’m glad that you had Severus growing up. I don’t know what I would have done had I not had Arthur to be such a good influence,” he admits.
But mostly he worked.
Pansy rolled her eyes at the situation and hooked her hand through Draco’s elbow. “Come on then, we’re never going to get a compartment to ourselves at this rate.”
He didn’t say anything to the why. Potter stared at him some more, before letting Malfoy take his hand again and start dabbing. Potter hissed at first but after a second it seemed to help. Draco wiped up the blood and then wrapped the handkerchief around Potter’s hand as best he could before letting it go.
No wonder you aren’t a Slytherin, even if you do blackmail like one!”
Blaise folded up the parchment, making the animation of half a hanging man fold in on itself, and shoved it in his bag. “All done then? What did she say?”
Sure enough, as soon as Pomfrey was next to his bed, “I’m keeping you overnight. I’m worried about that concussion, and I want to make sure I got all the major injuries. You had a broken nose and two cracked ribs, but only bruises otherwise. You were unconscious when you came in so you weren’t able to tell me where it hurt. I don’t need you rolling over in your sleep and finding you had another broken rib I missed.”
Blaise just sighed. “Too bad for me though. Those Weasleys man. Firecrackers.”
He’d almost reached the abandoned classroom he’d told Luna to meet him in when he glimpsed a Gryffindor running up the hall ahead of him, probably heading back to the portrait. Draco stared for a bit, before placing the Gryffindor as Finnigan. Draco couldn’t help but wonder what Finnigan had been doing out of bed on this night in particular.
Luna gave him one more smile before it melted into an intense, thoughtful look and she looked away toward the stairs. “Pandora. Pandora Malfoy Lovegood. I loved her a lot. She was quite smart, and talented. She was always trying to create new spells, I’m not sure she was trying to do anything in particular, I think she just liked the experimentation. The last one she was working on was quite blue. I was in the room, but she was able to shield me when the spell backfired.”
When they were all safely alone in the fifth year boys’ dorm, Draco locked the door and sighed heavily, leaning back against it to glare at Blaise. Blaise gave an uneasy smile. Draco rubbed his eyes. “Please,
Luna smiled one more time as she got up to go. “Goodbye Draco.”
Draco Malfoy
Draco tried for a sneer, but it felt half-hearted at best. “Why, Potter? Do you
“There’s a rumor going around, you see, Edgecombe. One of particular interest to us.” When Draco said the word ‘us’ he heard his Slytherin companions emerge from their hiding places along the hall behind him. After much consideration, he’d decided it was safe enough to invite the whole group of Pansy, Blaise, Milli, Vincent, and Greg, as long as he was careful what he gave away. They all stayed near the walls, leaning unconcernedly.
Draco smirked. “I thought we just established who my father was, you really think he hasn’t taught me anything?”
He was determined to make his father proud. With war imminent he might not have many more chances to do it. He could barely remember the last time he’d made his father proud, it was so long ago. He thought it must have been when he’d gotten his Hogwarts letter, five years ago now. Sometimes his father’s kind smile felt like a children’s story he told himself for motivation.
Draco bared his teeth at Potter. “What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck are
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So when Greg waylaid him after dinner on Wednesday he shouldn’t have been surprised. Greg was oddly shy when he caught Draco’s sleeve just before he turned toward the Defence classroom. “Hey, Draco? I know you’ve been busy, but I don’t understand the Potions essay.”
Draco didn’t let them get very far before he lost another battle with himself and stopped, forcing them to stop too. He glared at the floor and refused to turn around when he addressed Potter. “Umbridge is monitoring all communications.”
They must have been walking for at least ten minutes in silence before Luna cut through it abruptly. “You know, I don’t think it was your fault in the first place.”
He snapped his head in the direction the Bludger had come from, and saw a smug looking Vince waving his Beater’s club around.
It wasn’t until he was lying in bed that night, his last night at home until the winter holidays, that the responsibility he would hold with his badge really hit him.
Draco cleared his throat. “Who was sending Dementors after Potter? He was in muggle territory wasn’t he?”
Draco turned and offered Luna his right arm. She was quick to bounce forward and slide her hand around Draco’s elbow. “How exciting! I’ve never been properly escorted before.”
Draco felt shocked and touched and- “I really want to hug you right now, but that’s too Hufflepuff for anyone’s good, so I’m going to make you take your turn getting your hair pet. Even if that also is way too touchy feely and you’re not nearly dramatic enough to cover for it the way I am.”
That was enough talking for one night, if Draco was getting so mushy. He said his goodnights and put up the journal.
Montague shivered.
He often studied in the back of their library instead of his room because, besides having more space for spreading out several volumes at once, his father often forgot he was in there so Draco got to listen to several floo calls his father made from the library fireplace, since the library fireplace was the biggest in the manor.
It was just like Pansy’s mother, rushing Pansy’s official entrance into society. She wasn’t meant to debut officially until next summer, a year before she came of age. She would have a ball to announce that she was eligible to start receiving marriage offers throughout the following year, and meanwhile she was to start showing up to the adult functions to prove what a capable wife she would be. Pansy’s mother had always been anxious about Pansy though, worried she wouldn’t match well, or worse, that she would refuse an arranged marriage at all in the name of rebellion.
The question wasn’t aimed properly. Both Draco and Pansy answered with a tense and guilty “Yes.”
Draco stopped listening as the conversation around him slowly dissipated. He hoped his Slytherin compatriots heeded him and didn’t follow her around. He planned to keep a close eye on her himself now. She had two courses of action. If Draco scared her properly, she should quit Potter’s group and cease to be a problem. In which case she needed to tell one of Potter’s gang that she quit and Draco had to keep his group from seeing her.
She shot him a sideways look. Draco abruptly recalled that the last time he’d been in the hospital wing was when that hippogriff attacked him. It must have said something bad about her healing technique that he’d claimed she couldn’t heal him. A wave of shame came over him and he merely nodded his agreement.
Draco’s sick feeling intensified when Chang waltzed through the door, a friend in tow. He knew of Potter’s crush on her. On top of that, she was also Cedric’s girlfriend. Draco could imagine why she might want to join a group that was working against both the Dark Lord and the corrupt Ministry, but the sight filled him with something he insisted to himself was pity. She wasn’t likely to reap much benefit from an instructor a year younger, any more than the Gryffindor Quidditch team was.
he was going to keep following me because he thought I was up to something.”
Pansy was careful to look Draco right in the eye when she said that so Draco could not mistake her meaning. No one knew if they were to be ‘punished’ by Umbridge yet. Draco didn’t know what he’d do if it came to that because he got angry over Quidditch.
won. More like
He didn’t know where he was being taken and tried to struggle away. It had no effect on whoever was dragging him around.
Draco turned to address the rest of the Slytherin common room. “Do any of the rest of you have any problems with Blaise or me?”
Special thanks to FerchKalvaNiibi for betaing!
Draco leaned forward. Potter’s eyes got wider the closer he got. Draco felt the sudden tension when he leaned into his ear and hissed. “If I were up to something, Potter, you’d be the first to know.”
Blaise smirked, but his eyes looked guilty. “Well… I wasn’t going to become friends with a future Death Eater on the eve of a war just for protection from pureblood homophobia, no, I didn’t decide to become friends with you until I overheard you and Pansy.”
Greg actually blushed and looked away. “He’s not having as much trouble with it. Besides…”
Edgecombe’s eyes darted from person to person in a wild manner, taking a half-step back. Her voice was shaking worse than ever now. “I- I don’t know what- what you’re talking about.”
She already sounded indignant. Draco allowed his mouth an extra twitch upwards. “I’ve come to thank you, Professor.”
All Draco wanted to do was shove him around until he started fighting back. Until Potter finally looked at him again, with eyes that pierced his soul.
Draco allowed a slow smirk to crawl across his face. “I have a message for you.”
When his eyes finally fluttered open with a groan, it was to be met with the familiar sight of the hospital wing ceiling.
Draco leaned forward. “Just from the sheer emotional impact? That’s a brilliant theory. It could tell us quite a lot about thestrals if someone studied that. Very little has been written about them because they’re considered such bad luck.”
It really would be his best weapon.
Draco’s head was spinning. He knew exactly what would cause a wound like this. “She’s torturing you with a Black Quill.”
The three of them were silent down to the dungeon, or at least Draco thought they were, as lost in his own thoughts as he was.
Blaise flipped Nott the bird and Nott stomped out of the common room.
Only when he was up in the air, though, could he leave his slowly growing fears behind. He’d always loved flying, and being able to fly against Potter only made him more determined to be good at it. Fear and masks were for the ground; up in the sky it was only speed and wind and glorious freedom.
I would like to give an extra huge thank you to my beta FerchKalvaNiibi who still took time to beta this chapter even with all that's going on.
He was speed walking with such a single-minded focus that he collided with what felt like someone’s back head on. Draco managed to keep his feet, but his inadvertent victim let out a shocked screech and tumbled face-down onto the floor.
What would he do if Potter got detention with Umbridge?
Of course Umbridge was in his Care of Magical Creatures class the next day. He was glad that Hagrid was still gone. He could give non-committal answers with little backlash. He was afraid he’d arouse Potter’s anger otherwise and the last thing he wanted was Potter to lose his temper in front of Umbridge.
Even the oblique reference to Pansy’s father made Draco wince internally. The reason Pansy’s mother was allowed so much leeway when it came to raising their daughter was to do with his involvement in the last war. He and Draco’s father had been good friends in school and had both left it and joined the Dark Lord immediately. But while Draco’s father had been able to claim he was under the Imperius Curse, Parkinson could not, having been found by Aurors in the act. He was sentenced to the Dementor’s kiss. A secret Pansy had divulged only at the end of third year when she’d wept in relief that the Dementors were gone.
Draco grit his teeth and bowed his head, submitting to the truth of her words.
They hadn’t been serious though, just a bit of freedom for Draco really. He hadn’t even been mad when he’d stumbled on Hristo with his tongue in a Ravenclaw sixth year’s mouth about a week before the third task, merely shrugged and nodded them on. He’d nearly forgotten about him entirely in the wake of the third task and all the moral conundrums Draco had been contemplating since.
The door knocker seemed rather chuffed about her answer and swung open. Draco gaped at Luna for a few seconds. Then he sighed. “I suppose.”
He could keep an eye on Potter.
Also another thank you to my editor: FerchKalvaNiibi
Over time Draco noticed that Luna was doodling his blot into some sort of picture ... a lion’s mane. Slowly Luna added the other house symbols around it. The eagle was perched on the lion’s back, with the badger half under its paws. The snake curled completely around the front leg opposite the badger. If Draco was being fanciful he might think it looked like the snake was hugging it. Or strangling it. He knew which was more likely.
A new decree
When his mother saw it during their shopping trip after lunch, she’d beamed at him, and offered him a rare hug. Draco was quick to accept.
A vivid image passed behind his eyes of Luna, bent over a parchment stained in blood, tears rushing from her eyes.
Pansy curled up tighter into a ball, her knees up to Draco’s thighs and the hand Blaise wasn’t holding fisted in his shirt. “He was caught torturing and-and, a muggle girl.” Pansy sobbed. “Her neighbors heard the screams. They were magic and called the Aurors, it was the middle of the last war. He got caught in the act and, and they gave him the Dementor’s Kiss!”
Actually doing that though would be tantamount to suicide at this point. Everyone not in Potter’s immediate entourage was giving Potter a wide berth. Mostly out of respect, for both Potter and Dumbledore, who had asked the school to do so before Potter got out of the hospital wing, but also because anyone who didn’t found themselves on the wrong side of far too many Weasleys. A seventh year Slytherin had ended up in a bad spot courtesy of the twins that was so bad it scared off most of his house, and a misguided Hufflepuff had gotten a bad bat-bogey hex from the Weaslette.
Pansy kept him great company, joining him in scowling at the new Gryffindor prefects and not saying a word when Draco followed them past his own reserved compartment to see where the last third of the golden trio was sitting.
He took a few secret passages. Anything to get away from that office it seemed. He didn’t even appear to be heading for the tower.
Draco’s mouth curved up into his signature smirk.
Draco frowned down at the page. He wished he knew some way to convey to Luna how much it would hurt to be rejected a third time, but he didn’t even know how to start explaining. Besides, the anonymity would serve as a good cover if his advice ended up going wrong as well. Luna was hardly the type to cast blame.
Come Monday, Draco refused to even look at Potter. He wasn’t sure if Potter noticed, but it made him feel better that he was slighting Potter in some way, even if he couldn’t tell.
He didn’t know what to feel, what to think. Already it was hard to reconcile the horror he felt with the excited murmurs from certain other Slytherins. His fist tightened around his wand, a couple of green sparks shooting out the end. Everything had only just happened. He still had a little over a week before he went home for the summer. He’d observe for now. He’d decide at the closing feast what role he had to play this time.
Draco frowned, careful to keep his voice down as well. “They didn’t actually wipe Edgecombe’s memory, did they?”
trust them.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Blaise grimaced. “I was hoping you wouldn’t notice for a few more minutes.”
Draco lifted one of his hands, and waved it around vaguely. “I don’t care. That excuse is as good as any other.”
Now Davies was smiling too. “It won’t be a problem. I expect you want me to pretend to be a Ravenclaw and go scout around the Gryffindor’s practices?”
The feeling of flying neck and neck was one of the best memories Draco had of Hogwarts. He would be loath to lose it if Harry- if Potter got expelled.
Blaise finally smiled again. “Damn right I’m not going to marry either of you.”
take place in the Hog’s Head. It was notorious for use by smugglers and any manner of people could overhear what was sure to be a loud meeting of students.
As it was he was quite happy that he had Pansy as his prefect partner. He supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised, no one had the Slytherin house by the balls quite as well as Pansy. Davies had relatives in Ravenclaw house and was seen as having split loyalties. Greengrass was a nice enough pureblood girl, but a little too quiet. Milli stood no chance, unfortunately for her. No matter how her reputation had grown since second year, Slytherin couldn’t be seen to have a half-blood prefect: even if they could intimidate the younger years, they would never get the respect of the older students.
Potter’s arrival had to mean the others would arrive shortly, so Draco positioned himself near the Gryffindor portrait -- where he was actually supposed to be -- until they’d all shown up and he could guard the door.
Pansy
Edgecombe managed to break the tense silence Draco was purposely allowing to drag on. “What was the message? I don’t- I don’t want to be too late.”
Draco went to dab Harry’s hand with it, but Harry drew it away, almost out of Draco’s grasp, his eyes wide. “What is that? And why are you doing this? I don’t understand why you care.”
wasn’t going to be anyway. Although he thought there were several good male candidates. Maybe Thomas. Hell, if Dumbledore and Mcgonagall wanted to give him some confidence, Longbottom would be an all right choice really.
When Dumbledore spoke those words a rushing sound seemed to fill Draco’s ears. He knew his role now.
the Snitch in his grasp already as Potter turned in desperation, their brooms neck and neck as they extended their arms.
Pansy’s smile quickly dropped. “Ugh. I forgot you mentioned that last night. I don’t see why you see fit to up your stalking. Or why I have to help. You can’t do anything to help him you know. If you did you’d risk getting disinherited, or worse, frankly.”
Did you hear the news? I hope you haven’t, I would hate for you to hear this from anyone who might tell you over at your place. I heard from my mother at breakfast. Potter’s been temporarily expelled! He was caught doing underaged magic in front of his muggle relatives. The ministry wanted to expel him outright and break his wand, but Dumbledore was only just able to at least get him a trial. It’s set for next week sometime I think. I couldn’t ask for too many details as you know. I’m so sorry Draco! I hope he does okay if only for your sake.
He made himself sick sometimes. Draco couldn’t help it when it came to flying though. Potter was a natural on a broom, an amazing sight to watch. He didn’t think he’d ever been so scared and horny in his life watching Potter fly against a fucking
His panic was broken by Greg elbowing him. When he turned to see what he wanted Greg just grunted a low, “You okay?’
Greg and Vincent took his reticence to mean they shouldn’t say anything either and Draco clapped them on their shoulders and nodded approval at them on their way up to the castle. They seemed pleased.
It was nice to see Pansy chatting so avidly with another girl. She was constantly complaining that she was surrounded by too many boys all the time hanging out with him. Pansy and everyone else had taken some getting used to when it came to Millicent. She was one of the rare Slytherin half-bloods, one with a muggle parent no less. She was quick to assure that said muggle parent was out of the picture, and that she disliked muggles as much as the next pureblood, but she still hadn’t grown up in the same pureblood circles.
Draco actually leaned back at that last part worried Pansy might do something rash. Montague saw it and leered at him. It gave Draco an idea of what Pansy’s escape plan was.
The wait in the lead-up to the first Hogsmeade weekend was a special kind of torture for Draco. Instead of the anger that had been haunting him since the first day of term, he was now consumed with a gnawing worry. Now that he’d made his first active move against his father’s wishes, he was panicstricken anyone might find out.
On the other hand, he seemed to have given Theo- Nott, that one last shove he’d needed to move completely out of Draco’s orbit. Nott had also been around since Draco was small, and even though they’d never been real friends, Draco wasn’t sure he liked how things had unraveled. He’d already fielded two nasty letters about ostracizing Nott from his father, who was worried about Nott’s father, but Draco wasn’t too worried, having used the excuse of building different political allies. Other than upsetting his father, Nott hadn’t made any attacks on Draco or Blaise’s person, which was probably all the better for Nott, considering Draco’s renewed efforts to retain his popularity.
“What are you doing tonight?” he asks, turning away to not focus on his arm and the blood coming out in tiny droplets from there.
“Ah so it’s sentimental as well. It’s not bad music actually,” Harry admits. “Is this what you normally listen to?”
“What are you doing?,” Harry whispers as Malfoy grabs his hand and begins dragging him over to a group of admittedly good looking men.
Aby sits with his thoughts for a bit, and then just has to know. Moving across the room, he throws in a pinch of floo and calls Jane.
"Oh well I've certainly done a fair amount of those. Aby actually helped design charms for cock piercings," she says casually. "For sex I'd suggest either cock, nipples, or tongue. Up to you," she lists, getting out supplies, and placing it on the tray.
“Well maybe he likes your work and he trusts you to take good care of him during the process,” she counters. “You know as well as I do that it’s important for you to trust your artist and have some sort of connection with them. And I haven’t known him for that long, but Auror Potter doesn’t seem to be the type of person to hold anything against you. He, well, he seems to be almost sickeningly good,” she admits. “Either way, he seemed very hurt that you were pushing him away.”
“Not at all. I only flirt with certain people, so far it’s just you and Jane here,” Harry replies with a chuckle before settling down and closing his eyes as he lets Malfoy concentrate while working.
“No. I’ve been testing similar charms on other pieces, but the ink is a pearlescent kind of color that would take some creative charm work to blend magically, as well as to get the wisp-like movements right.”
After breakfast he waves Harry off at the floo and ignores Luke's knowing look.
“Well that leaves you with nipples or cock, and I’ll say the cock ones are certainly more popular.”
"I'm sorry," he murmurs back, though he knows he doesn’t exactly need to apologize. He rolls out of bed and goes to the kitchen to start the coffee.
“Well you don’t know me,” Aby points out flatly, and begins to remove the hair from Potter’s bicep.
"Rising the ranks at the DMLE already, not surprised. Congratulations," he offers, and moves to steady Potter so he won’t mess up the design. Aby tries not to think about the differences between his and Potter’s life. Potter’s the first person he's seen from his old life since he'd run off and it stings in some ways. He begins to get lost in his thoughts, focusing on just the task before him, until a knock comes at the entrance to his station that pulls him up.
"Why was there shouting?" Luke asks, not looking at the auror but asking Aby instead.
"I'm afraid we've gotten you properly addicted," he teases as he places the transfer onto Potter’s skin, hoping to get the outline at least done today.
"She's getting a mural done based on the Beedle the Bard tale Fountain of Fair Fortune so it's intricate. Not much movement but more art" he explains, pointing at the liquor store across the street.
"Luke is just protective of who he considers his pack. He'll be hard to win over but he's a good man even if he's terribly straight," he huffs. Luke was very tactile just not into men much to Aby’s ire early on. "Now let's go eat whatever Luke ordered and maybe you'll start having proper meals not in your office."
“Well I’ve had my arse kicked a million different ways and I was still never that sore the next day,” Harry replies with a shrug. “What are you going to do to me today then?,” he asks him curiously.
Aby tries to recall the conversation and remembers the throw away line. "I was under the impression that I misheard you or that you misspoke. I value privacy Potter so I didn’t wish to make assumptions," he explains, his haughty self coming out a bit more after a drink and some weed.
"Potter I think you've done worse than walk into a sex shop for some toys!"
"And even if you did help with that, I suggest you keep your eyes to yourself,” he warns with a small growl before Malfoy comes back with the boxes.
When she finally sent it Draco bolted for the empty classroom.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Love,
Neither Draco nor Potter moved for a minute, both panting into the other’s face.
Draco grimaced.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cover, second of all I’m going to give us a great excuse to leave in just a second, and
For all that Draco wanted to hurt Potter, he didn’t want to hurt him like
The other part of his brain was trying to process the nature of the invitation. Just what was Potter trying to do? A defence club. That was bound to get shut down by Umbridge before it did any good. Draco wrote out,
Draco scowled at Potter. “Watch your back Potter.” For some reason that made Potter’s mouth quirk up in a half smile. Draco wanted to smile back. Instead he said, “I think my father had something to do with the bitch’s appointment.”
As soon as Blaise finished Pansy was accosting Draco, her voice shrill. “What do you mean torture? What do you know! Why didn’t you
Draco found it wasn’t too bad.
Draco wanted to grin as he watched Chang turn toward Edgecombe in shock. She clearly hadn’t known that. Potter had been loud enough last year telling everyone he knew that Draco’s father had been in that graveyard. This should put a dent in their friendship. If Potter was intent on having Chang around him, this might help make her less dangerous. The other two girls with them were even tittering over it together behind Chang and Edgecombe.
Luna hummed a bit. “Well… my mother’s maiden name was Malfoy you know. Mother didn’t talk about her family much, but I gathered that she was disowned. We’re probably cousins.” Luna looked back up at Draco in excitement. “I didn’t know I had any cousins.”
Draco gritted his teeth and jerked his head in agreement. She wasn’t a problem that could sit. “I will. You’d best get to bed before we really are caught.”
Davies sat up straighter, her previous smile falling fast. “Yes. But that doesn’t mean I’m any less-”
Just so long as it wasn’t
Far from being put off by his tone the girl seemed to light up at getting any sort of response. It made Draco grimace and wish he hadn’t said anything. “They pull the carriages! They were ever so frightful when I first saw them on my way home the first year, but we’ve become good friends now.”
He didn’t know what else to do though. He wondered as he drifted off if he’d ever figure it out.
Well that wasn’t ideal. Draco was prepared for it though.
He got a few interesting letters from Pansy as well.
He stormed over to Potter and grabbed at his hand, practically screeching, “You’re hurt! Merlin’s beard!”

Once again huge thanks to my beta; FerchKalvaNiibi
If it was Blaise or Pansy and they had told Umbridge all they knew, they might end up taking a hit for becoming so involved and not telling someone sooner. Just saying they had heard a rumor that Potter was gathering people would be enough to earn them plenty of accolades from Umbridge. She hadn’t gotten to Potter since his last detention.
Draco stared at Blaise in horror. “You like gingers?”
His mother actually sighed. It brought Draco up a bit short. He blinked a few times to get over his surprise. “Let us be frank Draco: no beating around the bush when there is war on the horizon. No, Lucius informed me that it wasn’t him nor one of his Death Eater friends. We both know what your father is. We are both going to have to get used to the idea. Again, in my case.”
Luna hummed thoughtfully, looking out of the corner of her eye at him. “It’s not the same. I don’t think you’re affected.”
Blaise and Pansy were both staring at him with stricken expressions, but Draco couldn’t stop. “Some days I care more about the romantic things. Holding his hand while we walk through Hogsmeade and heads turn, stargazing on the Quidditch field at night, kissing on the astronomy tower, one or the other of us on our knees. But- but sometimes that matters so much less than him just
Uncle Severus nodded once and turned to leave, presumably for a class.
Draco stalks
Turning over in bed, Draco was able to admit to himself that some of the things he’d done since to get Potter’s attention were a little much. Maybe even immature. Especially faced with a sudden dead body.
Draco was unsettled to feel tears gathering in his eyes under his mother’s look and his voice almost didn’t make its way up his suddenly tight throat; he quietly choked out,  “I understand.”
Pansy snorted a laugh. “That’s a riot. And revenge for your comment the other day in the common room, don’t think I forgot. It’s not like it’s a privilege to stroke your hair, darling. You’re just needy.”
Draco grimaced and tapped the side of her shoe with his foot at her lack of appreciation for his idea. “I can’t very well follow her around. For one thing, it’s creepy when a man follows a girl around, and for another, I’ve still got Potter following
Draco bit his lip in thought.
be able to block it with Occlumency, but he was glad he didn’t have to try either way.
His voice was sharp and loud. Everyone around them suddenly stopped talking when they registered his tone. Pansy tightened her grip on his forearm.
Remembering Potter clinging onto Diggory in a panic made Draco’s face twist up in a vague horror he couldn’t really place. In all the years they'd been at Hogwarts, through all the things Potter seemed to get involved with, from the Philosopher's stone nonsense in first year, the heir of Slytherin debacle, to the dementors and Sirius Black, hell, even facing down a
Blaise grimaced, but met Draco’s eyes head-on. “No, I didn’t tell anyone about Potter’s group. I hate Umbridge, and you two are the only people I really talk to.” Blaise clenched his jaw as if to stop there, but as the words kept spilling out a look of utter embarrassment came over him. “I’m so grateful to have found people like you two that feel like real friends, in a house of snakes, I never could betray you of my own free will. I might actually die before I gave you a reason to hate me. And does this stuff ever let you stop!? Salazar!”
Draco got up with a sigh. The floor seemed to lurch under him a bit, so Pansy grabbed his shoulder. Draco squeezed his eyes shut for a second to regain his balance; Blaise scrambled to stand on his other side.
He was happy his voice was back to his regular drawl when he addressed Potter again. “What are

Greg trailed off and Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “Besides…. What?”
Draco straightened as much as he could in his chair and accidently cut Milli off mid-sentence when he announced, “Well, We’re going to bed then. Goodnight.”
He and Zabini were coming in the common room entrance when he was knocked back into reality by way of Theo shoulder checking him deliberately on the way out.
Draco was even angrier because he had to act
The words were spit out before Draco could rethink them. “You’ve picked the wrong side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around riffraff like this! Too late now, Potter! They’ll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord’s back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well- second- Diggory was the f-”
What he wasn’t getting a good look at, though, was the thestrals.
on the fact that you
The group started talking about other things and Draco lost track. At some point Pansy slid all the way into his lap. Draco held back a wince and shuffled around uncomfortably.
I'm glad I got this done before I left for my girlfriend's for the long weekend! Be a little bit til the next chapter, but this outline I did is really helping! Once again let me know what you think!
He tried to spend as much time with his parents as he could, especially his mother, as he missed her, missed both of them really, quite a bit while he was gone. Not that he could ever admit it. But his mother had a duty to host several dinner and garden parties with the other ladies of the sacred 28, to stay apprised of the social politics that ran rampant through their circles.
He couldn’t believe that Potter was being so stubborn. He had no doubts that if anyone else was in Potter’s place he’d walk them to the headmaster’s office himself, the prat.
Warrington grunted, when Draco looked over at him with a raised eyebrow he spoke up. “Found out they got another Weasley on the Gryffindor team. Potter’s sidekick.”
Draco frowned. That meant the girl saw her mother die. He couldn’t imagine that and steeled himself against trying to. “No, I can’t.” Draco paused for a second in contemplation. “It’s weird though. That I can’t. Shouldn’t everyone who watched the third task be able to see them because of Diggory?”
Draco saw he looked a bit lost and wanted to scream. He grimaced. “I don’t care. Why would I care?”
Ever since he’d left Potter in that hallway he’d wanted to enact this plan. But now he could feel the blood rushing out of his face with every step he took. His hands were already shaking. He wasn’t a bloody Gryffindor. If he hadn’t felt such a deep, spiraling pit of guilt and fear clawing its way up his stomach like a rabid beast he never could have kept walking.
Draco scowled. “He found me at the start of my patrol last night. I was hiding next to Potter’s meeting place in an alcove behind a tapestry. If he didn’t follow me, I have no idea how he would have found me.” Draco fought down a blush, remembering how close they’d been in that little alcove, how close Draco had dared to step with his self preservation drowned out by his feelings for Potter. “He outright
. And what words did he say
Draco grimaced. “I don’t know why I didn't really. He said he’d tell people I helped him if he found out I told someone about his detentions, but I doubt he’d find out I told you two.” Draco squeezed his eyes shut, pushing back the images that tried to break through his mental shields, and spoke in a barely discernible whisper. “He was bleeding. I’ve never seen him so ....”
Theo grinned maliciously. “Oh? I guess you haven’t heard then? I’m surprised the Great Draco Malfoy would be so slow on the uptake.”
Even though Luna talked like it didn’t hurt, Draco sensed an underlying pain, still, after all these years. Draco wondered if Luna acted like it didn’t hurt because she thought it shouldn’t. Draco kept his voice low as if trying not to be overheard. “I’m sorry she died. I’ve never lost anyone before, so I can’t say I know how it feels, but I am sorry you lost her. She sounds exceptional, I would have loved to meet her. My estranged cousin.”
His Slytherin companions were sending him looks like they expected him to blow up at any moment. He barely noticed, too busy ignoring Potter and seething quietly lest he really did explode.
Both Draco and Pansy flinched hard and turned to look at the source so fast it was a surprise they didn’t pull something. Zabini was sitting in his bed, dressed, with several books around him and a roll of parchment in front of him. His curtains were partially pulled around his bed, so that they looked closed from the side by the door, but were open on the side by the window, presumably so he could look out into the lake.
Draco scoffed. “Really now, you’d think I’d died.”
Draco rolled his eyes and settled back in his chair. It didn’t matter what happened before, he would more than make up for it now. He hoped something was really wrong with Weasley. Giving Weasley hell would hurt Potter just as much as if it were him. Draco would also be able to get some revenge for Weasley having left Potter last year, taking the role of Potter’s best friend and squandering it. Oh, yes, this would be some beautiful revenge.
Blaise winked. Draco thought he might puke. Pansy snickered.
Draco felt more stable, but then, barely out of the office, he lurched forward. Blaise and Pansy jumped to steady him, but Draco wasn’t sure it was exhaustion right then.
Luna pulled back after a few seconds and smiled at him again. Draco attempted a smile back. “Shall we go then?”
if they’re producing offspring like him as a family of
“We wanted to write another couple of verses! But we couldn’t find rhymes for fat and ugly -- we wanted to sing about his mother, see --” Draco was vaguely aware of someone insulting him to the other Gryffindors, but he barely paused. It wasn’t Potter, what should he care? He could hardly even hear it over the pounding in his ears. “ -- we couldn’t fit in
Pansy and Blaise both gave him weird looks, even as he passed Pansy back her mirror to write to Luna. “Her father is the head of the Floo Network. Father talked to him a couple times over the summer. He’s in Fudge’s pocket. Possibly father’s too.”
. I just have high standards.”
It wasn’t Pansy who ended up telling him how the trial went.
It filled Draco with a low simmering hatred. They were clearly trying, but nothing they seemed to do helped. He hated it because it filled his head with familiar what-if’s that he had no time or energy to be thinking about now when he was meant to be coming to some sort of decision.
He’d thought he hated Potter until then. He really had. But he had to admit that maybe the hate really stemmed from getting denied what he had really wanted for the first time. He’d never wanted to be friends with someone so badly as he had that first year. The want had filled his whole being, and being denied it had sent rage burning through his veins the way it never had before.
Draco’s entire torso shook with his sob. Pansy’s hand flinched away and Blaise tensed before bringing his other hand up to stroke through Draco’s hair.
After a couple hours of inane chatting Draco couldn’t stand the cramped compartment anymore. He announced that he was going for a walk down the train and stood up without waiting for anybody to comment.
He was more tentative and gentle than Pansy, but Draco thought he might get used to it. Especially when he saw the suspicious shine in Blaise’s own eyes.
Draco jabbed Pansy in the thigh so she would pass him her mirror under the table. When she did, Draco squinted at the girl. She looked a bit like… He hissed. “Edgecombe.”
Draco groaned but let the words come out. “No, we’re not. Luna Lovegood is clear too. I’ve been talking to her through a two-way journal all year. She’s my inside source. We’ve become good friends. Maybe not like you two are, but good ones. She doesn’t have a duplicitous bone in her body. And little to no friends outside Potter’s group that I can gather. She's safe.”
Luna scuffed her shoe along the floor. “You would have gotten along, I think. I’ve noticed you also like solving puzzles. You don’t have to be sorry though, I wouldn’t be me if it hadn’t happened, so wishing it away is like wishing parts of myself away too. I’m sure I’ll see her again, eventually.”
Potter’s eyebrows lowered back into his usual glare. “What am I doing here? What are
Draco ended up sending her a new pair of expensive dress shoes with a permanent cushioning charm after remembering how she’d ended up barefoot by the end of the Yule Ball with some pretty bad blisters he’d had to make her some dittany for.
The next thing he knew, he was dropped into a chair and his head forced between his knees. Sounds started to seep back into his ears until he could hear an irate Pansy. “Breathe, you idiot! In and out. Come on. In…. and out.”
Potter stilled. His voice was as quiet as Draco’s when he spoke again. “What are you
Draco’s sneer dropped, his exhaustion becoming clear on his face in a way he’d never let happen in front of Potter before. “If you don’t care, leave me alone, Potter. Stop following me around, stop asking questions you don’t want to know the answers to, focus on your own damn problems. I’m sure you’ve got enough of them.”
The longer it took the new Hogwarts lists to arrive the more nervous Draco got. It was far too late to be able to do anything about whatever decision was made, but doing nothing tightened his throat while a horror rose up in the back of his mind.

She flicked him on the ear discreetly, but ran her fingers through his hair anyway. Draco only just stopped himself from humming.
Draco was aware now that Johnson was holding one of the twins back as they caught on to what Draco was saying through the haze of their victory. But Potter still wasn’t reacting. Still wasn’t paying much attention, now focused on his
Pansy snorted. “Think about Gryffindor friendships a lot, Draco?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco felt his heart race, his lungs constrict. He forced himself to breathe as deeply as he could a few times until the feeling faded a bit. “I found out something Umbridge is doing. I can’t tell you what it is, but it’s bad. I can’t let her get away with it without retribution. What if she turned it on the Slytherins? Or-” Draco faltered at just the thought. “Or you. I can’t do nothing.”
Draco hesitantly reached out to shake the offered hand. He hadn’t heard of a Lovegood, but Ravenclaws were all right. About the only other house Slytherins talked to. Her hand was cold in his.
Your Friend,
Draco grinned in anticipation.
Draco stared straight ahead in disbelief. His voice was devoid of feeling. “What do you mean, it wasn’t Edgecombe that told Umbridge?”
Blaise smirked teasingly across the table. “Oh
and you’ll find yourself with more detention and a letter to your father.”
He left a loaded silence in his wake; Draco let the silence carry on for a few minutes before he addressed his friends. “Please tell me that one of you has my letter?”
Draco had a spell that Uncle Severus had taught him when he had gotten his acceptance letter from Hogwarts. The spell,

Crabbe swallowed heavily, pushing Draco’s wand harder into his throat. He started to nod, but upon being unable to move his head, he stuttered out. “Y-yes?”
Pansy rolled her eyes, but her face softened in return and she stepped closer to flick a bit of hair from his face.
Luna turned toward Draco. “What do you think?”
Draco was ashamed to admit that he may have avoided coming into direct contact with him more than usual this summer. While he did seem happier than he had of late, he was also much more critical of Draco than usual.
“-- there’s no way we can lose! With that, and Umbridge knowing about Potter’s club, thanks to me --”
Her voice was just as hard as her glare. “I- We’ve, decided that the only way to fix this is by using extreme measures. Clearly there’s been a misunderstanding somewhere.”
When Draco was just starting his first year he’d been concerned about other students reading his mail, since they would all be getting it at the same time. His mother had wanted him to write regularly despite his fears, and so they’d set up a system, just the two of them. They had never actually used it before.
mail?”
Luna shook her head again, her long hair waving about. “Everyone was there. Hermione examined everyone individually before we left too. Zacharias Smith didn’t like that too much.”
His information from the couple of Slytherin first years he’d managed to slip into the Weasley twins’ trials were a different story. Draco was pleased to find that instead of the out-and-out destructive inventions he’d been half expecting, they were actually developing useful, and in some cases, outright clever, objects. Draco decided to keep the spies working, with the intent to buy any newly for sale items, personally, as soon as they went on the market.
Blaise stifled a noise that may have been a groan of mortification, and might have been a sob. Only the thought that it might be that second one kept Draco from doing more than scowling at himself. And Pansy when she chimed in with a clear sniffle of her own. “I knew you two were giant saps. Here.”
He had never been so bored during the summer following their meeting either. Nothing could seem to interest him the way Potter could.
because Luna is fine and she told you. Every single one of those members could have told a friend and any of those friends could have told Umbridge. It even makes more sense that it was someone who knew less because Umbridge made a blanket ban on clubs instead of coming for Potter directly. She doesn’t even seem to know where the meetings take place or she would have been up there already.”
The two thoughts drifted and collided in his mind in a kind of numb horror. Both thoughts wanted to spiral out into the worst possible outcomes, Draco only just able to block the incoming panic.
Draco just blinked at the notebook for a minute. He suddenly wanted this very much, despite knowing what a bad idea it was.
Draco nodded and started off toward the carriages.
Draco waited several minutes to be sure before he slid his wand back up his sleeve.
Draco’s mouth wanted to drop open, but he forced it shut, his lips pursing. He hadn’t heard about the Dementors. It must have been a Patronus he’d done then. He recalled being on the receiving end of that Patronus. It was beautiful and terrifying. He’d been a little honored when he’d found out it was Potter’s first corporeal patronus that had chased him down. After he got over the embarrassment and the scolding from his father.
Draco immediately felt better. No one had ever accused him of being sweet before. It brought a smile to his face.
He had really thought he could trust them was the thing.
Luna’s question had brought them almost halfway up the stairs. Luna pressed closer to him, in a sort of side-hug. “Thank you for worrying about me, Draco.”
Draco shut the journal for the night and got under his covers. He found he was looking forward to it too.
Draco suppressed the grin, and frowned at the two of them. “I’m afraid it is important.” Draco glared at Chang in a not-at-all-feigned way. “And private. I doubt you want your friends to hear it.”
Milli raised an eyebrow, still leaning against a wall. “Does this mean we have to keep watching her? As much as I enjoyed following the wimp, I don’t fancy continuing.”
Blaise and Pansy both made faces at that.
Pansy’s hand on his back and Blaise’s on his shoulder were a warm weight through his shirt.
He felt his face soften and was glad for his bed curtains.
Draco snorted. “I thought you said he was the one to be suspicious of Edgecombe? It's a bit contradictory to only check her, but blindly trust everyone else.”
Draco snorted, but was quick to unwrap the chocolates, popping one in his mouth. They always waited until the week before Pansy’s birthday on July 9th to deal with their birthdays, despite Draco’s being two days after the end of term, so they could exchange gifts at the same time. Draco didn’t care, he still got his first. He hummed in satisfaction. He supposed he did owe Pansy a nice birthday gift.
He didn’t have to wait long for Luna’s reply.
Draco sat up slowly, and managed to tilt his head back. Several drops of a potion were dropped down the back of his throat. He thought for a second he might drown, before he remembered to swallow.
He paused outside the office door. He took several, long, slow breaths. Then he locked it everything away. Every feeling, every vulnerable thought. The perfect Occlumency wall.
Finnigan’s hand jerked toward his pocket, likely where he was keeping his wand. Draco was quick to slide his down out of his arm holster and into his hand, pointing it at Finnigan, who froze, his glare renewed. He stopped moving his hand and spit. “Get bent.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Blaise laughed a dry laugh. “I suppose. I barely know her anymore. She’s not the same person she was when I was younger. She doesn’t see me anymore, not really. And she’s not happy. She lives only for the game now.” Blaise’s voice was hushed with his next admission. “I’m afraid I’ll end up like her. I know my reputation and how I look.”
Draco cleared his throat and offered his arm again. “We’d best keep moving, the longer we take the more likely we’ll run into someone else.”
If he’d been friends with Potter would he be able to do a better job? If Harry- if Potter had taken his hand first year? He liked to think he’d at least be doing a better job than the Weasel. He almost didn’t believe it when he’d left Potter’s side in the beginning of the year, leaving a perfect opening for Draco to set the school against Potter.
Draco sat up straight from where he was leaning against the window to give the girl his full attention. “That’s a good theory. No one’s ever explored that avenue before, I don’t think. I suppose it also helps that no one in the audience saw him actually die either, we just saw his body. Do you think just seeing the body is enough and next year everyone will see them once we’ve had some time, or that we’d have had to see the moment too?”
It was an exciting prospect to have the ear of the older years, he hadn’t quite managed it before. He was too young as a first and second year to be taken seriously, and Flint, though stupid, held sway better as Quidditch captain in Draco’s third and fourth year than Draco had quite managed to, though he thought he’d been making some progress.
The thought brought Draco up short for a second before he ran a rough, agitated hand through his tangled hair.
SPOILER
Potter was clearly angry by this suggestion. “Why?”
Blaise put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco turned and caught Blaise’s eye, his dark eyes were lacking all the life Daco usually saw there. “What did she do?”
Potter’s voice cut through the silence of the corridor like a knife. “What happened? I saw you leave the Great Hall at breakfast.”
Draco let his hand drift up to the bruise decorating the underside of the left side of his jaw. “Bruises take time to heal properly.”
Malfoy?”
Zabini was sitting on his bed when she left and raised an eyebrow at him. Draco only huffed and looked away.
Draco gave her a dirty look. “Alright, I agree to your terms. As long as Milli agrees to help, it shouldn’t be a problem. But you’ll not tell Milli where you got the glamour. I don’t need the whole damn house knowing I use it.”
Finnigan sneered. “You don’t have the guts. You’re all talk and no action, just like all you Slytherins.”
Draco flushed. “Yes, really! She doesn’t mind when I’m not careful of people’s feelings, she calls me sweet, and she’s incredibly insightful. We talk about Potter and thestrals. Also I think we’re cousins. Her mother was a Malfoy, apparently.”
and it’s stupid! And when he came out of that maze clutching a
Draco grimaced and flushed to the roots of his hair. “He’s not rumpled he’s-! You know what! I don’t care. Pansy I hate you, I can’t believe you said that!”
Apologies for how long this took. I am not stopping any time soon so don't worry about that at least!
From the corner of his eye Draco could see the edge of Severus’s mouth turn down in a sneer. “That isn’t any of your concern. You should be worried about yourself.”
Blaise raised his hands in front of himself as if to ward her off. “I won’t. Who the hell would believe me anyway?”
to tell me?”
If he failed, she was headed straight to Umbridge.
Draco smirked. “Exactly.”
Draco put his glass back down on the table without taking a sip. He was surprised. He’d have guessed  it was a desperate attack by one of the Death Eaters. That someone at the Ministry was behind it was not good. If Potter didn’t have Ministry backing he was as good as alone in his fight against the Dark Lord.
After reading that, Draco held his quill over the page so long he left an ink blot. And still he didn’t know how to respond.
at him. He couldn’t let that stand. He sneered, letting his fury come to the front to block out how shaken he still was from Potter’s fall.
More of Draco's scheming. And what's this? Must be a Weasley.
Pansy told him she’d even overheard Weasley and Granger talking together at a prefects’ meeting about how Potter had begun insisting that Draco was Up To Something -- to the exclusion of almost all else. Draco was oddly flattered.
specifically asked me to watch out for you. Because you’re such a gormless moron that you don’t even realize how little you know.”
Draco was startled out of his thoughts by the door opening. Draco froze, one hand still in his hair. Slowly one large grey eye peaked around the door, followed by a blinding smile and a cloud of blonde hair.
Potter grabbed a couple handfuls of Draco’s robes and shoved him back. Draco stumbled a few steps back and fell. Draco grabbed Potter’s hands and squeezed, hard, to get him to let go, but Potter’s hands barely budged.
Draco had half hoped that the hookups would distract him from Potter, or maybe put him off Potter altogether. The only thing it had done on that front, however, was make Draco’s dreams of Potter more explicit. It was mortifying.
Something dark curled against Draco’s Occlumency walls. He was quick to suppress it.
Blaise slid his arm to Draco’s other shoulder and pulled Draco’s head down onto Blaise’s chest. “It’s not your fault Umbridge found out what Potter was doing. You did everything you could. More than anyone could have expected.”
Blaise laughed again, in that way that said clearly that nothing was funny. “What a class act we are. Coming from families of murderers. All of us are too independent by half and too lonely and scared by far. It’s no wonder we go so well together.”
Draco sat up straighter. “I heard that you had Potter and the Weasley twins banned from Quidditch. This gives Slytherin much better odds for the Quidditch Cup.” Draco paused to shoot Umbridge a delicately disgusted look. “Not to mention the way they attacked me. How dare they touch me with their inferior hands! Dueling like muggles.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When he was sure Edgecombe was gone he turned back toward his friends. “Alright, good job. She shouldn’t be a problem anymore.”
He was taking lackadaisical notes when he noticed that Luna had sent him a message.
He heard Potter’s loud “Malfoy, wait-”, but he hurried down the corridor, almost separating from his friends to escape.
I regret to inform you that due to the current political climate it is unsafe to converse with you in person. However, I find that I still wish to speak with you, and so do formally invite you into a correspondence. About which topic we’ve previously spoken, I find that I still cannot see the thestrals. Have you found out whether Chang or the Diggorys can?
He could have some real power with this. He could DO something.
“Do you have
Blaise paused to take a deep breath. “I don’t really remember him well. I just remember he was always smiling. He had a best friend from school that had followed him into the corps. My godfather. After my father died he was as brokenhearted as my mother. He looked in on us. Said he wanted me to grow up with a father figure. I guess he was around so much, mother and he eventually developed feelings. Mother and him got married when I was eight. I remember him a lot better than my own father. I called him dad before they even got married.”
Draco took a deep breath and closed his eyes. Maybe this would be the worst idea he’d ever had, but damn it, he wanted to trust his friends again. He carefully, purposefully, lowered even his most casual Occlumency shields. When he raised the dropper his hands were steady.
won. The rest of them were useless. Draco had them beat and now Potter wouldn’t even
Potter grimaced. “Why are you telling me this? I don’t understand why you care about this. You wouldn’t even admit last year that your father was a Death Eater and now you’re telling me his plans?”
Draco opened his mouth and closed it again. He knew he hated Umbridge because she was torturing Potter and working with Draco’s father. His own father who was also set on hurting Harry. Potter. But he couldn’t say any of that.
information for me.”
Edgecombe’s eyes widened. Chang must have noticed how uncomfortable Edgecombe was, because she stepped in front of her and addressed Draco with a glare. “Marietta doesn’t want any messages from you. You should leave her alone.”
Draco was no longer amused. “I suggest, Finnigan, that you take your filthy half-blood mouth back to your dorm now. Before I have to use force.”
“Why? This is nice though. Why...why do you keep pushing me away? I know I’m not your type but I thought I was decently attractive at least,” Harry asks him, sounding a bit petulant.
“It is certainly very different to Celestina Warbeck. I’ll admit I don’t listen to much music but I’ve never heard any of the wizarding bands sing about this kind of subject...it’s a bit refreshing actually.”
“You’re right and I kind of hate that. I don’t have much of a life outside of work anymore. It’s kind of pathetic when you think about it,” he says finally with a deep sigh immediately following.
“I’m not answering that. Better question is, how do you know that I eat in my office?”
Walking into the parlour, Harry expects Draco to be back at the front desk, but was instead greeted by a short, curvy witch with cropped hair, and more piercings than Harry had seen on a person before. He recognizes her as the witch who’d come into Draco’s station last time asking about food and poisons.
It was about an hour after he opened that Jane wanders downstairs, yawning and holding a coffee out for him.
Jane frowned. She was torn between her need to run the shop and her desire to protect Aby. "Well then he's avoiding all his other appointment today as well,” she pointed out, wanting to prove Harry wrong in order to preserve Aby a bit. “Best I can do is either have Michael do it for you, and he trained Aby, or move you to another day..." she offered in compromise.
“But regardless. You rescheduled him didn’t you? Was it with me?” he asks, staring her down.
“Well,” he starts, biting his lip a bit unsure of whether or not he could trust Jane with additional information that would be a field day for the media, but seeing as the shop was a bit private, he took a gamble. “Well, I was with a man and Malfoy said that he was just being polite and giving me privacy. Besides there is no reason Malfoy would want me to stick around. I’m sure I’m just a customer to him, and someone from school he’d rather not see again,” he explains, running a tired hand through his curls. “I’m just...I’m so confused. We get along sometimes but other times it’s like he’s gone right back to hating my guts, as if he ever stopped in the first place.”
Harry didn’t bother with any reading material, content to just look around and take in the station, while Malfoy ate. His fascination only lasts so long however, and soon he was breaking the silence with a question.
“Cheers. Tell him if he does it again I’m going to leave snow in his office,” he threatens, through sips of the warm beverage. “Or worse make him deal with customers. By the way I’m on desk until one it seems, then I have a three hour session. But I was wondering if you have time tonight to work on our project? I brewed the antidotes,” he grins, to which Jane immediately shakes her grogginess to jump and hug him enthusiastically.
"Apology accepted. And I'm sorry for being... mercurial," he sighs not knowing what else to really say, as he slips on a t-shirt that shows off what is left of his Mark. The snake and skull is faded and covered in ivy and blossoms. Changing into his joggers, it was a contrast to see that his legs had almost no tattoos in comparison to the other half of his body.
“I feel the same way though,” Harry continues as he boards the train. “I’ve had a hard time in our world and it’s hard for me to find someone who isn’t just with me because of my fame.”
As Aby stepped outside he saw Potter against the wall snogging the blonde he’d been chatting up. Not wanting to interrupt, he ducked into an alley to pull out the weed cigarettes he smoked now and again. He knew it was a horrible habit but he only indulged every so often. He from where he was standing he heard a goodbye and the close of a car door, and thought nothing of it until he heard footsteps coming down the way.
Harry watches a wry smile cross the other man’s face, as he shakes his head. “You were booked under Abraxas...as in Draco Abraxas Malfoy,” he sighs, rubbing his forehead. “So please, take a look again at our other artists' work. They have much more experience than me, and I don't want to lose this shop the commission because of a mistake, so I’ll be sure to give you a priority booking.”
He knew back when Narcissa first came to him, entreating him to find Malfoy, that Lucius had to be involved - but the Malfoy matriarch was reluctant to believe that.
"Sorry not my type both because of your bits and professional," he replies, eyeing the way the auror is looking at his friend.

“Everything alright?”
“Thanks Aby,” he murmurs, stealing another glance at him before he downs the potion and heads back into Malfoy’s room to grab his clothes.
It’s for the better, he thinks, but can’t help to ask after her. "Did you see her then? After it ended?" he asks, missing his mother more than anyone else, rubbing at his chest where his tattooed narcissa blooms were.
"You mentioned that you work too much which leads me to believe you're the sort who eats whatever is on the trolley in the office if no one is inviting you around," he deduces, moving to leave his room.
“I always have time for my friends,” Harry assures, and leads Malfoy out of the shop door, and towards the back streets of Magical London that merged with the muggle world.
"Well that comes with being in a society a few decades or a century behind most things, depending on the subject," Aby smirks, and leans in to focus on a stubborn curve, playing with his tongue ring as he concentrates.
"Nope, just trying for you to have a good time.” As the next band comes on, Aby is pleased to find Potter staying for the show, even jumping around to the music as the night went on.
Making himself a strong drink, Harry stands beside Malfoy, and before he knows it he’s being introduced to one person after another.

A few minutes later, as Aby watched the next act set up, he feels a hand settle on his lower back and turns to find Potter there.
Aby begins to work and puts some music on, opting this time for 70s punk on original records so the room fills with Clash as he works. Murmuring spells under his breath, focusing on the charmwork, he begins to work up a sweat.
By the end of the night both men are rather sloppy but coherent enough to make it onto the tube.
Aby ignores his tone and pulls his stool closer to Potter’s arm to inspect the design, poking it a bit, before getting his tools out. He’d be doing the more gold detailing today as well as some anchor points. Dispensing the ink into his cup, Aby murmurs a spell over it, tapping the liquid, making it shimmer. “This gives it the beautiful swirling effect you saw in the photo,” he explains before beginning.
"I really like your style and I know you're going to laugh but I wanted that snitch you had in your blue album," Harry finishes with a smile and Aby couldn't stop himself from giving a small one in return. He was proud of that snitch. Sure the design was simple, but the magic needed to get the snitch to fly around the designated points was intricate.
Harry blushes and resists the urge to hide his face. “I wasn’t doing it just to hang out more, I was genuinely interested in it,” he grumbles. “And fine, okay, I won’t jump the gun anymore. Though I would like to say that that was never my intention in the first place. I just offhandedly mentioned it. That didn’t mean I was going to run off and immediately try to fix everything,” he points out.
Harry is already awake by the time Maofy starts stirring, his headache lessened by the fact that he is in bed with him. He makes a small noise of contentment as he feels the blonde nuzzle closer, followed by a soft whine when he backs off. Opening his eyes when he feels the other man stretch, Harry rolls over onto his other side and watches him for a moment. “G’morning,” he mumbles softly.
"My mother nor you need to waste anymore time on some death eater gutter punk, so leave it alone" he swallows, turning on his heel to apparate to his flat.
He walks into the shop and greets Jane with a tight smile, walking up to the counter.
"Well yes he's very fit don't you think?"
She cackles, kissing his cheek. “I have indeed seen your cock, so I know what you have all the guys ranting and raving over.”
Jane playfully swats at him from across the desk at the wink. "Oh you, stop. Now off with you and I'll talk to Aby. See if he'll at least finish your tattoo if nothing else."
“Yeah it’s difficult to find a flatmate who’s a wizard and would respect my privacy and I can’t find a Muggle one because I might have to use magic to protect myself and my home one day. So I guess I’ll just continue to be lonely,” Harry replies with a dramatic shrug. “And thank you, I would tell them that you said that but they still think you’re dead. Hermione is pregnant with their second child now though, a boy, his name is going to be Hugo,” he rambles.
Once inside the topic of magic tattoos dies down, focusing on what kind of alcohol to get, settling eventually on a bottle of whiskey and vodka so that they would both have something to bring.
Aby leaves Harry by the door and walks to his drawer to pull out some joggers and a t-shirt. "Look Potter your offer is generous, and I know you mean well in your own way, but it's a lot to process in a matter of days at this point," he mutters, pulling off his shirt to reveal his very tattooed chest and pierced nipples.
“Oh. Well alright,” Harry replied with a nod, putting his clothes back on, a bit disappointed that Malfoy seems to just brush him off like that. He knows he shouldn’t expect anything more though, they aren’t exactly friends or anything, but he doesn’t understand why Malfoy seems drained all of the sudden.
“Trying to get me drunk now, Aby?,” Harry asks with a smirk as he takes the drink, downing half of it in a gulp.
“Hi I’m Harry,” he Auror greets, recognizing the large man from his initial booking. Luke looks at the proffered hand and frowns. “I’ll leave you to it Aby,” he grunts, and turns to walk out.
"Yes he does have that sort of aire of annoying virtuosity about him but I can assure you that Harry Potter has more friends and admirers  than he knows what to do with so I'm certain he'll get over not becoming friends with the man he's paying to mark up his skin. I'm not friends with any of my other clients Jane, so I don't see why this is such a big to do?"
Harry shakes his head, bristling at the fact that Malfoy ignored his comments on the shop. “No, what you and I decided on earlier in the week is still what I want.”
“Ah, so it was your friend that invited us, he was cute though,” Harry muses.
"I didn't know you were in school with him,” she answers, a little surprised. “Honestly I don’t know much about Aby’s past. He’s private like that, but it figures that he went to some fancy school,” she giggles. “But if you want an answer the best I can give you is that he was probably getting on with you while tattooing you and decided to, well do what he did best, and push.”
"Don't worry about it. I do all my work here in long sleeves," he explains and uses his own wand to shoot a cooling charm his way. "Besides I'm almost done here so sooner I finish the sooner you can head out."
“Usually a few days but it can be longer if needed,” he answers, still stunned that Potter was being understanding. Usually at this point half of his clients would wonder why they couldn’t just get it all done in one go.
“Well hello to you too,” he murmurs before slipping his shirt off like he was told and sitting.
"Because you haven't seen him in almost a decade," Luke points out helpfully.
"I'll think about it, how about that," he offers before moving to clean his station before leaving.
Harry shut up as soon as he hears the annoyed tone in Malfoy’s voice, feeling as if he’s put his foot in his mouth - again. He lets out a quiet sigh and decides to close his eyes and try to rest, focusing on the small hum of magic coming off Malfoy’s wand. He doesn’t want to wear out his welcome until his tattoo was finished, after all.
Harry’s mouth falls open a bit at that information. Every time he reacts on an assumption about Draco, the man contradicts him.
"No I don't," he lies, leveling a look at his friend. Jane glares at him with a look that says ‘I know you’re lying,’ causing Aby to huff.
Aby instructs him to sit back down and begins to prepare his tray, were he lays various inks, bottles, and his inking wand. Adjusting the chair, Aby slides his stool over and get ready to work.
“You dated a muggle?” Harry asks, unable to hide the surprise in his question.
He smiles as he walks into the shop, greeting Jane before checking that Malfoy wasn’t busy with a customer before heading back to his station.
“Wait he gave his earnings to Luke?,” he questions.
“Thanks again Aby. Good night.”
When Luke arrived back at their flat that night, he tells Aby that Potter missed their appointment and rescheduled. “I didn’t see his name on the ledger so I don’t know if he’s with you or not, just a heads up,” he says, sitting down on the sofa next to Aby in commiseration.
“Really? You go out into Muggle London often?” Harry asks in disbelief.
Wiping some of the blood that rose up again, he pauses to dab at his face and cast a cooling charm in the room. It was comments like Potter’s that makes Aby to never roll up his sleeves during work hours. It didn’t matter how stuffy it got, he didn’t move those buttons until the doors were closed for the day.
Harry thinks on that, knowing that after the war a lot of magical folks started towing the line between both worlds, mixing a bit more. “So, Malfoy was telling me about your project last time I was here. How did it go?”
“Can I leave you my number? I mean if you ever change your mind about being friends?” asks, as he puts on his shirt, rolling up the sleeves to admire the tattoo.
It didn’t take long for the silence to get to Harry again. “So brewing? Still doing what you love in your spare time I see. You were always really good at potions...”
"He's an old new friend. Knew each other as kids and ran into each other when he booked an appointment at my shop," he explains vaguely. "He's definitely fit but not sure if it's a good idea to make a move on my part. Too much history and still just only know him barely as an adult."
"That’s a pity you’re learning it now. Sex and magic are quiet compatible as it's raw energy fueling magic. Jane knows of a few good magic sex shops if you want something to experiment with,” he winks.
“Right, that’s all done. Just going to place the transfer and you tell me if you like how it looks,” Aby announces, breaking Harry out of his thoughts.
Aby is thankful he is already the kitchen already for that compliment as he could feel the blush taking over his face, despite how corny it is. "As sweet as that is Potter, you're rather drunk for us to do more than cuddle," he balances, not wanting to turn Harry down completely unsure of how drunk Harry reacts.
Just nodding as he walks out, Aby let out a large sigh of relief, and wanders to Luke’s station to ask him what the hell he was thinking booking Potter for him.
“Aby’s my lovely test subject. I was seeing if I could get six different charms into one ring, so Aby brewed the antidotes to some common poisons, and tested the jewelry for me. If the ring does it’s job it can detect up to six kinds of poisons or drugs and gives the drinker an antidote by delaying some effects and identifying what was ingested. Handy for people out at bars or people with very interesting jobs,” she finishes, looking rather pleased with herself.
"Well it was originally Luke's booking, remember, but he was a bigoted arse, so Aby took it so we didn’t lose the business," she reminds. “He’s a softie like that,” she smiles, thinking fondly of her friend.
Aby comes out just as he hears Jane calling him a cheeky slag and just rolls his eyes, his difficult customer trailing behind him. "Jane just ring him up for me please, and stop corrupting the clients," he drawls. Seeing Potter he gives a small nod that means ‘follow me’ and leads him to the back again.
Harry knows he should think about this more, but the high from the tattoo is egging him on, as was the thought that he wouldn’t see Malfoy again unless he keeps coming back for more. “Cock it is then,” he decides. “What can I expect?”
Abraxas wanders with his head low down Horizont Alley. It was far too early and far too cold for the floo at work to not be open, but he needs to open up the shop today. At least he could get a coffee out of Luke or Michael if he guilts them about the shut floo, he thinks as he opens the door to Magus Atramento, one of wizarding London’s three tattoo parlours.
“Apology accepted,” Harry replies flatly, his gaze still on the blonde. What was it about Malfoy that had him unable to keep his eyes off him all of a sudden? “No tattoos on your legs?” he asks suddenly, as he realizes he’s been staring shamelessly.
Harry pulls out his cellphone to check his schedule. “Thursday and Friday are perfect actually. I’ll buy dinner one night and you can buy the other, or maybe you can cook for me again,” he proposes.
“You know as well as I do that I was actually ill. I forgot, again, not to try and keep up with a werewolf post-full moon when it comes to drinking," he sigs, leaving out the part that he coincided that binge with the day before Potter’s appointment. Across the room, Luke sniggers, not helping the argument.
“Is Pansy Parkinson secretly fronting a punk band or is the name a coincidence?” Harry jokes.
Aby had been dreading that question. Shaking his head he explains that he’s never been able to master it.
“Who’s to say that you’d be breaking your heart or your body Aby?” Jane asks, giving him a sad smile. “Personally I think he’s good for you. You haven’t looked this happy since you and Marley dated,” she points at, moving about the front of the shop to close up.
"I think I retain enough Slytherin self-preservation to do anything with you Potter," he shoots back, standing as their station approaches. "Come on. Let's go to the chippy enroute so we can line our stomachs for proper drinking."
"I'd suggest putting out an ad for a flatmate but I see the issue in that, given who you are," he commiserates. "Also congratulations to Granger and Weasley. Didn't know they had a family.”
"No need to bribe me. I'm not turning it down for me, I was giving you an out,” he scowls, taking a step back, still not trusting Jane’s wards after last time. “But if you want to continue, come back. My station is ready, I’ll just eat my lunch after we do the consult,” Aby murmurs, gesturing to the hall for Harry to follow.
"That they are. All science and no magic," Aby nods and takes his own slice of pizza before passing the box around, chasing it down with a beer, allowing himself to enjoy the cheesy goodness.
“Alright,” Harry nods. “They it is. But regarding the other night at the bar it helped that he was already drunk, so it made it easier to talk to him.”
“It’s polite to ask before touching someone Potter. And yes, it’s very pretty. Marley specializes in water color looking art so I asked him to do this. He's very talented,” Aby smiles wistfully. “He also covered my Mark up. Helped me test if muggle ink would work on it and lo and behold it did. Seems the Dark Lord didn't think much of muggle inventions."
“When are you free to start the tattoo? This week?,” he asks as he sits down at the table, ignoring Luke’s glares.
"House show. Friend’s band is putting it on, which means the house will be full of miscreants. Now said miscreants are of varying sexualities, so don't hit on everyone assuming they'd be into you. Bands are downstairs in the basement and the entrance fee is some alcohol."
"What's going on?" he murmurs, instinctively pulling his friend to the couch to curl around him, once he sees his wrung out demeanor.
Sorry for the delay in posting. I spent the last few weeks editing the whole story to change the verb tense, fix a lot of typos, and generally clean it up. I'm not working with a beta so I have to look it over more than a few times to actually like it.
Aby smirks at the reply and continues to walk until they reach the nearest underground station. As they descend the steps, Harry takes in the surroundings, realizing it had been a long time since he’s ridden the tube. “You know, I don’t think I’ve taken the tube since I was still in Hogwarts,” he admits.
"Potter believe me it would be difficult. Just trust me. And don't dwell on our first year. You were right to not take my hand then," he assures, deflating a little. "So just let me finish so you can enjoy your art.”
Liam smirked when Aby lowered his voice. “Oh come on, Aby. What’s history matter when you’re just going to fuck? I could always see if Charlie would be up for a foursome, that way it could break the ice between you two.”
“Oh? Well that’s even juicier. He’d be lucky to have you honestly Aby. If things weren’t getting serious with Charlie I might try my hand at snagging you again,” Liam teases, leaning against him a bit. “I say you should go for it. You haven’t tried to settle down since Marley, love. You could at least use a steady friend with benefits,” he suggested.
“You mean just because we’re getting along while he works he’s pushing me away? That’s a sort of a logic I guess, seeing as I’m part of the past he doesn’t talk about and has been running from,” Harry says, frowning as he tries to follow Malfoy’s thought process.
“And you’re the only snack I feel like going for right now,” he tacks on, silently thanking the alcohol for giving him some courage.
"He was. More than Lucius ever was, but that wasn't a hard bar to surpass," he murmurs, letting Harry bury into him, playing with his hair.
By the time Thursday afternoon came, Harry’s a nice mixture of hurt and pissed off about the entire situation. He wants answers from Malfoy, but he has a feeling that the man is going to make getting answers very difficult.
“Is this what this is about?” Harry calls as he follows him down the hall, “is that why you’re so pissed at me? Because I have lunch with your mum?,” he demands as he moves to block the blonde’s way.

“No! It is! It sounds brilliant. You’re brilliant!” Harry exclaims, catching Aby off guard.
“A combination? I usually go to release energy whether it's through jumping around like a lunatic or getting a blowjob in the backyard," he smirks.
"He always seemed like a good father. Honestly the Weasleys are a lucky bunch and I wanted to send their mother a gift for getting rid of Aunt Bella," he mirthfully admits. "Speaking of the Weasleys, has Granger had her child yet?"
“He doesn’t like me...yet,” Harry mumbles, trying to keep up with Malfoy’s long legs as they walked.
Aby sits at his station trying to get in a meal as usual, eating some leftovers at work rather than waiting to get home.
“Huh, your bed really is pretty comfortable,” he muses, wiggling a bit before he settles down, his breath hitching once he realizes that he and Malfoy are touching.
“It’s been less than a day. Now sit and let me show you what I have done. I don't think we can start today but if you like the design we can go write you down in the book - it’ll be after hours mind you," he added.
“I thought maybe you had grown up in the last decade! And what do you mean strutting about? I won’t apologize for being more confident in myself!” Harry yells back, grabbing his pants following Draco to the floo, leaving Jane in stunned silence.
At the sound of his name, Aby pinked a bit, liking how it sounds coming from Potter.
“That’s fine, eat all you want. I don’t have anything to do for the rest of the day,” he assures as he shrugs off his robe and suit jacket before unbuttoning his shirt.
“Well you are more than welcome to experiment on me any time you want to try out a new technique,” Harry offers, not thinking about how open ended that sounded.
Harry feels a small bit of relief when Malfoy goes right back to the floor, ignoring him, but there is another feeling there too. Hurt, he realizes. He doesn’t know why he feels that, so instead of following that line of thought, he goes back to the bar to find his potential pull for the night. He orders them another round of drinks and resumes their conversation, trying his best to forget that Malfoy is even here. It’s apparent that the blonde doesn’t appreciate his being here and he isn’t going to try and let that bother him.
Harry frowns a little, shaking his head at the blonde, his mind fuzzy. “No...no, I didn’t think you wanted to fuck me. And you won’t cock anything up,” he assures, biting his bottom lip in anxiety.
Harry watches sadly as Malfoy leaves, inwardly cursing himself. Why had he done that? He’d probably just fucked everything up. He heaves himself out of the bed a few moments later, following Malfoy to the kitchen as he tries to think of some way to smooth things over.
“Thank you Jane. I’ll...I’ll see you two there,” Harry nods, unsure of why he was willing to go to Malfoy’s place. He takes one last look at Malfoy and steps into the floo, calling out the address, and a moment later coming out the other grate.
“Can you do it all over? I’d really like it if I’d see it randomly on my foot or shoulder.”
“They.”
Getting up to stretch, Harry walks over to the mirror and examines his side, admiring the art that now adorans him. “Oh Aby...it’s beautiful. I can’t wait to fill it in. This is going to look incredible.”
“While I’m ready to see the finished product, I do like coming here. Everyone is nice and it’s an awesome shop,” Harry began, ignoring how clinical Malfoy was touching him.
"Yes, well the shop doesn't get the paper and I haven't seen news for a few years now other than the occasional wireless bulletin," unsure of how to respond to Potter’s comment.
"My mother is under the impression that her son is dead and he is as good as. After all if my father gets word that I managed to scrape by and even more so if he learns how, my mother will have to mourn me again. Best just let it be. As for his tattoo, if he comes in again tell him that not everyone gets what they want, not even Harry bloody Potter."
"Oh a treat for me? A fit auror showing off his muscles," she winks as she admires the swirling snitch. "He does have such a talent for those doesn't he?" she muses as she begins ringing Harry up and handing him the healing draughts for this session.
"I don't have my ledger on me so either owl or come in," he suggests, getting together some eggs, beans, and toast for everyone, leaving a plate under stasis for Steph when she wanders home.
Seeing as the fic was inspired by the song Common People by Pulp each chapter will be given a song title name.
A week goes by without Potter coming to chat and bother Aby. The absence strangely bothers Aby, even though it had only been seven days and he would see him in a week. But as that thought enters his head he reminds himself it’s best to not get attached as after next week Potter wouldn’t be coming back whatsoever until he wanted a new tattoo.
Harry pulls out of his back pocket the pamphlet he’d been owled with all his preparatory steps, waving it a bit. “I did. I also bathed and took a gentle pain potion.” Harry likes that this place took in all sorts for employees - the parlour was growing on him by the minute.
“Well I knew it was going to hurt, prat. But I didn’t think that today would be that bad,” Harry replies, still surprised to hear that Malfoy had Muggle tattoos, even though he remembers him mentioning it last time.
“I can live with that,” Jane decides, kissing his cheek before turning the closed sign over.
“Nah, I don't have anything to do tomorrow,” Harry answers, hesitating for a moment before finally slipping into bed with Malfoy, sighing happily as he gets comfortable.
“Oddly enough he didn’t curse you last time, even when he mentioned you poisoning him to test out your charms,” Harry replies, leaning against the counter as they spoke.
The song for this chapter is Sight for Sore Eyes by Martha. If you want to follow the playlist go to Spotify [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4I9ADXFyjaxr0t2jQTwNc4?si=_cHybph6SgSKuJyEXfxBcw]
Aby was about to say something when a knock at the door signalled the pizza and he went to get it, taking the muggle money from the jar to pay.
Harry spends the next few days trying to resist the urge to go by the shop, or find a way to run into Malfoy, not wanting to appear too eager. But luckily, Malfoy’s owl arrives before Harry’s patience runs out and gets the best of him. The letter is short and simply, asking Harry if he wants to go out that weekend, with no more detail than that. With a quick yes, Harry sends the owl, looking forward to the end of the week.
"Hey, are we still on for tonight? The monkshood shipment just came in and honestly it's been better since you've started brewing for us," Luke asks, looking at Aby from across the room.
Harry walks over to the mirror and looks as the snitch flutters around his body, his eyes wide with amazement. Waiting until it flits into his hand, he closes it. Lifting all but one finger, Harry sees that the golden ball is still there, struggling under his grip. Turning he thanks Malfoy, beaming.
“Oh wow, that sounds pretty amazing...I take it you’ve never done it before?”
“Oh so I would be a disappointment now? Or maybe you’re worried that you’d disappoint me? What I think is that you’d be too chicken to do anything with me, Aby,” he challenges.
"Did you have a good night Auror Potter?" Aby asks with a giggle.
“How do you like the placement?" he asks, inspecting the alignment from his point of view.
“That’s understandable. The magical world hasn’t given you anything but grief,” Harry agrees, flinching a little as the train came rushing by them.
"I guess I can allow it...” he begins with a small smile, before leveling a stern look at Potter. “Just please don't bring up my old life unless I do first. I need time to think about everything and I don’t like thinking about things out of the proper space. But I understand what it's like to feel alone, and you mentioned you haven’t exactly had a social life lately...so if you want friends, even if it's with degenerates like us, who am I to tell you no. After all you saved my life."
Aby begrudgingly gets up and begins to walk to his room, gesturing at Potter to follow him down the hall and to his bedroom.
“No, I don’t have to go anywhere. I just tried to hit on you and I was even going to kiss you. Why would you want me here?,” he asks,
“Aby is just finish up back and will be out soon," she offers, watching Harry pace the room a little.
Coming out to wash his hands, he sees the unmistakable profile of Malfoy and gives him a smile in the mirror as he turns on the tap. The blonde gives the the auror a curt nod, dries his hands, and heads back out to the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry had almost fallen asleep as Malfoy worked on him, smiling to himself whenever he could hear the blonde singing to himself. He basks in the contentment of the ongoing moment, and is brought to when Malfoy declares himself done for the night.
“No! Sorry, just curious. Wait what fine?” Harry asks, a little confused.
“I always do. We have lunch occasionally,” Harry informs him, a knot of some strange emotion in his stomach as he looks at Malfoy and sees the complicated emotions running over his face.
“Did I say something wrong?” Harry asks, looking back at the blonde curiously.
“I’m sorry that you all have to deal with that. Do you get a lot of arseholes coming here?” he asks curiously.
Aby parks Harry by the wall, takes off his sweatshirt, and as soon as the next song starts up, he throws himself into the rapidly forming mosh pit to work some energy out.
"Potter I essentially branded your skin. It’s going to hurt, magic or not,” he snorts, turning the page.
Aby laughs, not feeling much beyond mild disappointment, but understands. "Yes, yes you slag I understand. Thank you for the snog as always. Enjoy Charlie tonight. I'm heading out as I’ve got no one to pull for the night,” he sighs dramatically.
Ignoring Harry, Aby sits on his stool, stretching his neck at bit. "Just give me a moment. Skipped lunch taking that wanker and I’m rather hungry," he sighs, summoning his lunch from his charmed carry all.
"Part of Michael's apprentice training it to go to a muggle shop and work there a bit. Muggles came up with tattooing not us, so it makes sense that we go to learn from them...and a few of my friends are artists in that area. One of them did about four of my muggle tattoo,” he explains, leaving out the part that his very talented ex had been that muggle.
Aby waits for the protest but none comes. Instead Potter was pulls a small diary from his robe pocket, looking at the weeks ahead. “Yeah I think I can make that work. I mean how far apart do they need to be?”
“What are you talking about? I was flirting with the right guy!”
Clearing his throat he continues, hopeful that the man might not recognize him after so many years. “Apologies, appointment or walk-in?" he finishes.
Aby had to think for a moment to mentally count them. "I think I'm up to fifteen at this point. Some small. Some large," he shrugs, finishing his small sandwich with a final bite.
“No, sleep how you normally do. Do you mind if I sleep in my boxers? I tend to get too hot while I sleep,” he asks, unbuckling his belt and slipping his trousers down his legs, trying his hardest not to stare while Malfoy undresses.
"Yes. And please don't go about telling people who did this. Say the shop's name just not mine okay?" he asks firmly, having done a rather good job of avoiding his father.
“How are you playing a mix on that? The music sounds too modern to be on a record.”
It was a week later that Harry walks back to the shop, taking a deep breath as he steels himself for the consult, only to have his world turned upside down when he sees Draco Malfoy standing in front of him.
"Thank you Potter but I assure you that's just the booze talking," he murmurs as he fall into a state of half slumber until their stop comes up.
"Well sometimes it helps if I know if my friends have slept with him. Reviews of sorts and whatnot. Also a lot of them like to whisper ridiculously filthy things into my ear as the night goes on and most of the time it lives up to the hype," he avidly explains as he stands on the platform.
“I wasn’t going to ask, but I’m fascinated. I honestly never knew it was possible to do so much with magic involving pleasure until I listened to Jane go on about it,” he admits sheepishly, wondering if it would have made parts of his sex life better.
“Thank you for everything Jane. Wish me luck,” Harry salutes, following her directions, and walks back to his station.
The first band ends, and the blonde is still at his side, clearly pleased that Harry was decently fit and buying him drinks. He excuses himself to the loo, but the blonde follows him, pressing him into a wall for a quick makeout. He pulls off to catch his breath and catches the eye of the man passing them to get to the toilet, and the colour drains from his face. He gets pulled back to attention when the man presses against him and says he’ll meet Harry back at the bar, leaving Harry to walk into the toilet to face Malfoy. Luck is on his side though as the bathroom is just a series of single stalls, and he can maybe avoid Malfoy until next week if he was lucky.
Harry snorts and falls into a seat with Aby, leaning heavily against him. “Mmm yeah, Aby. Didn’t get laid though,” he laments, though he grins at the blonde.
Aby is sitting in front of the floo when Harry arrives, sitting cross-legged in worn jeans and a baggy teal sweatshirt with a tank peaking underneath, as he reads a book. "Well look at you. Didn't think I've seen you so casual. You look almost passably not like a professional narc," he muses, his eyes roaming over the auror.
“I don’t think I’ve done anything to give you the impression that I want to be out of the parlour...or at least I hope not,” Harry replies quietly. “I mean I come a bit early to talk to Jane, I ask questions, and honestly, you’re not the Malfoy that I remember. It’s weird and intriguing. You’re Abraxas now and I find myself wanting to get to know you, despite you clearly not wanting to,” he continues, blushing slightly as he makes eye contact with Malfoy.
"Well I wanted everyone to stop shouting in my shop and I wanted you two to keep chatting but somewhere Aby felt safe. His home. Now everyone just sit down and I'll make the tea," she instructs, leaving no room for argument.
"That she is. I'm glad she's going out and not staying cooped up in the manor," he sighs, needing to end this conversation now before he begins to cry. "I need to go home Potter. I hope you have a good weekend and I'll see you in a week to finish your tattoo,” he murmurs, picking up his pace to head home.
Once he found the location in Horizont Alley, he’d walked in, asking the big man behind the desk how he’d make an appointment with an artist. The man had instructs Harry too look through the provided artist portfolios and once he found a style he like he’d be booked with that artist. He found it interesting that names the artists were kept off the portfolios, but the man had explained that it was to prevent bias. After perusing the options, Harry lands on the artist in the blue album - the one with the snitch flash - and books his consultation and session.
Harry laughs incredulously at that news. “We did? By your friend? Are you going to tell me that you accepted on my behalf? But for what it’s worth you weren’t being bitchy, I am pretty damn awkward,” he admits.
“Hey, I’m just asking,” Jane insists, throwing her hands up in surrender, walking to the sofa to sit down next to Luke.
"Potter plenty of customers come in, chat, ask questions. I'm treating you like I would any other customer. You come in for a service, I provide it, and you leave. I don't chat with customers after hours, I don't walk home with them, and I certainly don't discuss my personal life with them," he grouses. "And as for who I am, it doesn't matter. Because being around you brings attention. And that is the last thing I need if I want to keep being alive."
“I’m sorry,” Harry tries, holding his hands up. “I know it isn’t my business I just know she misses you!”
"I think we all need some dinner,” Jane claps. “Luke how about you call for some takeaway and I'll fire call Michael so he doesn't think I've disappeared.”
Harry came to terms with his sexuality about three years ago, finally comfortable with the idea that he was attracted to both men and women. His close friends and family know, but it was more of an open secret with everyone else. He wants the freedom to date and experiment without it all becoming a tabloid article in the Prophet. He found Nellie’s about a year ago when a blind date he’d been set up on took him here, and he comes back every once in a while to listen to the music and find a distraction for the night. When he arrives he goes straight to the bar and after a quick scan, sees a petite blonde guy and begins to chat him up. Turning to the bar to get him a drink, the blonde crowds him in, leaning close so he could chat into Harry’s ear above the music.
"Harry we should get out of bed and eat," he whispers, not knowing what the other man is playing at. Sure Aby is there, an easy target for sex and experimentation but he can’t do that.
“I agree. It definitely suits you,” Harry replies with a smile, reaching up to run his fingers through the longer hair on top.
"I offered, but he's at home tonight working on these muggle toys he likes to collect. Tiny models you glue together and paint. Very tedious but he enjoys them, bless."
“I can’t do dinner tonight but I’d be happy to chat while I worked on the ink notes.”
“It’s gorgeous,” Aby compliments, reaching out to touch the stag, who bows his head for him.
It takes a lot out of Aby to not respond to that comment. Potter was a customer and not someone he could snark at. Instead he just crosses his legs and continues his usual standard questions. "Do you have any drawings you want to serve as inspiration or any way you want the art to display on your body? Size? Location?"
"What happened to Aby?" he asks, almost growling the question, taking steps towards Potter, until a moment later Aby comes through with Jane and he settles a tad.
“I hope if I ever manage a patronus it’s not the same a Lucius’ - that would mean I have a peacock following me around and I don’t care for those horrid things.
“That can be done, just need to put anchor points all over you. Really that’s just a pin prick of magical ink that I make invisible, so no worries on it being seen. You’ll just need to strip more than just your shirt next session.”
"Thanks for the tip,” she says, handing Harry his receipt. “He gave his earnings, from this afternoon's jerk client, tip and all, to Luke so this will make up for it," she beams.
“Oh wow, that’s beautiful,” he breaths, not noticing the way his hand reached up to lightly touch the art on Aby’s chest, which causes the blonde to pull back.
“You seriously think I would hit on everyone? I’m not that kind of person, if that was the case I would hit on you,” Harry notes, dumping Malfoy’s shoulder in return.
He shakes his head and smiles as he mentions Hermione’s baby. “No, not yet. She’s not due for another two months or so, but that doesn’t mean anything,” Harry admits, sighing softly as he presses their foreheads together. This definitely feels like something more than platonic today.
Turning around with a roll of his eyes, Aby shakes his head in response. “Not at all Potter.”
Turning to Aby, Jane suggests, “And why don't you change and go chat with Harry a bit and see if you want him to stay for dinner."
"Do you have a place in mind?” Aby asks as they cross into London proper.
"Then perhaps try to become friends before offering solutions," Jane suggests. "From what Aby told me of that night at the club your walk home was decent enough until you mentioned his mum...so perhaps start over and don't jump into a cock piercing just to hang about more?" she giggles, as Luke groans.
“I’ll definitely be back for more ink and I’ll think about a few piercings. They’ll have to be hidden though,” Harry replies with his own wink, glad that she’s here to make him feel a bit better.
Aby leans into Jane letting her comfort him as it seemed to be the week for his friends to do that. He never showed his much emotion growing up but learned that was not the way to do things any more. "I doubt he thinks like us, but if you want me to do this tattoo so he stops being a nuisance I will. Just to show you that we won't be seeing Harry Potter here again."
Aby frowns and following him back to his room. "Did you have to go somewhere? I was just finishing the coffee and can get a fry up going in a second," he offers.
“Well at least you’re honest about it Malfoy. Do you live in Muggle London?” he asks curiously
Harry sighs and nods. “You’re right. I’m sorry, I’m being wildly inappropriate. I just...nevermind,” he says pulling away.  “I need to respect your wishes. I’m sorry.”
“Oh no, no. I wouldn’t know what I was doing in there. I wouldn’t know what I was looking for,” he stammers nervously.
Harry shakes his head and sighs, looking at Malfoy silently for a moment. “Well I suppose that I appreciate you respecting my privacy. You’re one of the few people from the magical world that knows that I like men too,” he replies, having to bite his tongue in order to not point out how Malfoy’s tone had changes with his intoxication.
"No Potter I didn't know any of that aside from the cloak but I just thought it was a rare invisibility cloak not THE cloak. I just always heard the Dark Lord go on and on about those things around the manor and that is a kind of magic I just stay away from."
“Can you take my 2pm movement charm on Thursday?" He asks after the sun has gone down and the pair began to stir. "He's a good tipper," Aby assures, and Luke agreed.
Harry sits up and goes to the mirror. “Holy shit,” he breathes as he looks at the new additions to his body. The gold swirls around the snitches body, giving the tattoo and ethereal quality, especially on the wings.
“I already did,” Jane admits sheepishly. “He’s your last appointment on Wednesday.”
"Not my fault you can't get your dick wet Potter, but let's see what we can do for you tonight."
“Malfoy!” Harry calls after him, frowning deeply as the blonde walked quickly away from him. “Do...do you want me to tell your Mum?” he asks, unsure of what he had said to upset him.
Jane nods in understanding, having dealt with the harsh way Aby talks about himself, especially when her and Michael discovered his background. "He gets like that sometimes,” she answers in consolation. “It's not my place to say why but if he feels unsafe or doesn’t think people are going to stick around long he does put up some distance. But as for avoiding you I'd probably do the same. It's always odd seeing a customer in public. Never know if someone is going to be alright seeing us or just sees us as someone they pay to do a job and that's all."
When Aby was satisfied with the art, he turns to his prep station before asking, "Anything you wish to change regarding movement before we finish?"
“I still want her to attack my cock with a needle, Aby,” he chuckles. “I want to step up my sex game,” he adds, realizing he’s had a beer too many since he was confessing that so readily. “Anyway, thanks for tonight. I ended up having a lot of fun with you and your friends. Maybe we can do it at mine sometime. I’m at 12 Grimmauld Place. It’s unplottable, but now you have the address.”
“It’s nice that you care about him enough to help him with his potion. Remus had to be self sufficient in that area if I’m not mistaken,” he murmurs.
“Yeah I’ll try not to do any shirtless sunbathing in the next few days,” Harry jokes as he pays for his work as well as the aforementioned generous tip and hands all of the money to Malfoy. “So I’ll see you in a week then Malfoy?”
“Sure,” he agrees, picking up on the flirtatious tone in the man’s voice as he lifts his shirt to show off the snitch. But before Harry's shirt could get all the way up, Aby grips his bicep, murmur the stasis charm and glares at Harry.
“What?”
“All done. Have a look,” Aby instructs, pointing over to the mirror in the corner of the room.
A few songs later Draco comes out, sweaty, satisfied, in need of water. With the tilt of his head he signals Harry to follow him back to the kitchen and pours himself a drink. As he gulps down the water he spotts some guys he knows he could pull and probably help Potter land one too.
Harry felt his stomach swoop as he watches the other man immediately curl up with Malfoy. “I don’t know. Jane told me to come here,” he answers simply and shrugs his shoulders, turning to look expectantly at the woman.
“Yeah, that’s all that happened. And I was just on my way home,” Harry promises, as he easily catches the hangover potion.
“I do. There’s this little diner not too far from here that makes a killer burger,” Harry offers, having a craving for something greasy. “Does that sound good to you?”
Aby apparates to an alley he’d been blown in a few times before, and makes the walk to Nellie’s. Greeting the bouncer, he asks if the music tonight was dance music or if he was lucky and a band was on, and to his great pleasure it’s the latter. Walking inside, he bypasses the bar for not to head to the stage area to see if he knows anyone there tonight. Spotting some familiar faces he goes to say hellos and sits down with them before the set starts. A cute guy with his friend hands him a pint within moments of him sitting down and he figures it’s a good start to the night.
"I think Jane would be the first to point out that there are all sorts of marriages you twat and believe me we don't have a rule against screwing customers just personal preference," he glares, hoping the insult landed.
Giggling as Harry pulls him down onto his lap, Aby sits there for a moment before remembering what he was going to do. "I thought you wanted tea and a snack Potter."
“Seeing as I very much do not want to tattoo anything beneath your pants I think you’re safe. Just strip off your trousers and shoes and I’ll get started. Shouldn’t take more than half an hour.”
Something in Harry’s chest flutters a bit as Malfoy let out the guffaw, surprised by the sound. He had never heard such a genuinely happy and amused sound come from the man. “Oh sorry. I didn’t know. You just spoke so highly of her,” he corrects quickly, blushing furiously.
“God, maybe I just need to take you home with me so that you can take care of me,” he replies, not thinking of what he just said. “Hopefully I’ll just be able to go home and pass out or maybe I’ll go get drunk after this to help with the pain,” Harry muses, shutting his eyes and lying back. His day at work was nothing if not tedious and exhausting.
Walking home that Friday, pay packet in hand, he decides he should go out tonight. None of his roommates were in which gives him the ability to either drunkenly crash or drunkenly shag if he wants. Luke’s out using his friend's safe house for the full moon even with the wolfsbane, and Steph is on a date. Not wanting to put in a ton of effort into getting ready, Aby goes home, changes into a jumper with a tank top underneath, and heads to muggle London to one of his usual bars to see if any good music is playing tonight. And if not? If not he’ll pull and get himself a distraction.
"Thanks Potter. Seeing as you're the only one I've seen from school time in over six years I'll take it," he snarks, not caring for the sentimentality while he worked. He doesn’t need the blessing of the Saviour, he thinks, and focuses on his work instead.
"Want to come back to mine for a tea or snack before flooing home?"
Aby waves his wand to turn the music on, laying back to lounge on the floor, as Potter grins, being welcomed into their fold.
The first band of the night comes on stage, and people begin to make their way to the front. His eyes scan the crowd, his friend talking into his ear to tell him something over the music, only to have his gaze land on a rather fit bloke leaning against the bar who looks like the type he might hit on once he knew the guy was properly beved up so he might not hit Aby if he wasn’t into blokes. But as soon as the guy turns to face the stage, Aby frowns - because of course Potter was here.
"No Potter I didn't think you'd enjoy getting your cock pierced but I didn't know your were doing that,” Aby spat back, ignoring the fact that his misconception was cleared up, and opted to run headfirst into an argument. “Just figured you two were having a moment alone and I was interrupting. After all you brought up how you're looking to date since you’ve got a lot of alone time. Playing the field and such playing the field, which you should certainly know Jane."
"Whoa that’s neat. Not sure what it is, but looks great,” Leo offers, and reaches out to skim Harry's arm, letting his fingers linger.
"Ah I met Aby around shows. He did a poster design for my band once as a favor when I found out he could draw. So usual ways. But it's nice meeting you," he smiles, leaning into Harry a bit.
“All done,” Aby breathes, the process leaving him exhausted. Potter stands, searching for the points and frowning when he doesn’t see anything.
Aby always enjoys sleeping in when he can, and finding himself wrapped around a warm body is even better. Nuzzling into the man's neck he takes him a moment to remember it’s Harry in his bed and he backs off a bit, opting instead to roll over on his back and stretch. He'll need a slight hangover potion soon, but he could be worse off.
Harry stammers, looking away to gather himself. “Sorry. I just...After being around Remus for so long before he passed, I just don’t think about it anymore. He got to be pretty open with me, Hermione and Ron about it,” he tries to justify. “That’s part of the reason that I hated Fenrir Greyback so much,” he adds, glancing up at Luke. “In any case, I’m sorry to hear that it happened. I’ve seen how hard it is to deal with.”
"I’ve been trying to get the ink right for a patronus tattoo. The animal would be mostly stationary, but the ink surrounding the glow would move. I think I have most of the mechanics and spellwork worked out, so if it’s something you’re interested I’d be grateful for a canvass.”
"Yes, just three of us now,” leaving out that that while now it's only the three of them in the flat he had at one point been the fifth person sardined in there when Steph found him sleeping rough. “I bet you live alone,” he snarks.
"Morning. Give me a minute and I'll get us some hangover potion. I don't think my last batch has expired," he yawns, his clothes having shifted in the night to reveal one of the tattoos by his hips - a potion bottle surrounded by script and raw ingredients.
Nodding, Aby puts him in and hands him the potions and receipt for this session. "Be sure to take those and try not to expose yourself to the sun too much until I seal it. They say it's only for muggle tattoos but I know that it affects magic ink as well."
over the summer. I got too used to someone being there. I told myself I wouldn’t get too invested, I was just curious. Merlin. I’m such a liar. I learned from the best.”
“So there’s proof it wasn’t Edgecombe?” Draco raised an eyebrow. He couldn’t help feeling impressed with Granger, even as a rush of relief came over him. It wasn’t his fault.
Pomfrey opened the door with a spell, before bustling back to her office, practically radiating disapproval.
Finally a reaction. Potter grabbed the twin the Chasers hadn’t reached as he lunged for Draco. Draco couldn’t help breaking out in loud, jarring laughter at the sight. He threw up his arms dramatically as he backed away, half sure the twins would throw off their handlers and not caring what they’d do to him as long as his last ditch effort got Potter too.
He thought he caught a hint of worry in his mother’s eyes across the table, before she turned a congratulatory smile onto her husband.
pay for it. Maybe not now, but you will.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco raised an eyebrow at that. He wondered if Luna was serious and Potter was actually invisible or if she meant something else. He supposed it didn’t matter.
Edgecombe shook her head in panicked denial. “No! No! Why would I want anything to do with Potter!? My father would kill me if he thought I was doing anything involving Potter!”
The rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team showed up, their new captain in the lead. Draco huffed and took a drink so he could look elsewhere. Bloody Gryffindors. If this endeavor messed with their Quidditch practice they’d have only themselves to blame.
Draco grit his teeth for a moment and then spit it out. “Did you tell anyone about Potter’s group?”
It didn’t help that it was Pansy’s idea either. “You should give them that spell you always use when you want to rant about Potter.”
She reached into the pocket of her robes and pulled out one of the last things Draco expected to see, a shining crystal bottle of clear liquid that was unmistakably veritaserum. Before Draco had even fully shaken off his disbelief Pansy had taken the dropper out of the top and was dripping the first of three drops onto her tongue.
Draco managed a watery smile.
Later there had been fumbling in an abandoned classroom, Hristo’s stubble on his thighs and his tongue somewhere much more pleasurable. Hristo’s thumb against his bottom lip and his deep voice husky. “They don’t make lips like yours in Bulgaria.” Before Draco had dropped to his knees to return the favor.
“SO OF COURSE I THINK ABOUT GRYFFINDOR FRIENDSHIPS! Friendships where I don’t have to bother with politics and reasoning and swaying allies or tormenting someone I love. Where I can be with Potter and it doesn’t matter because what could other things matter really? Greg and Vince only follow me because I tutor them and our fathers told them too as repayment. I barely know the others. We band together for self preservation. For our parents. Our blood. Until last year I was sure even Pansy was only friends with me because of Slytherin politics and the want of a good marriage match.”
Draco’s head turned a bit too quickly towards his mother to be entirely natural looking for casual conversation and he silently cursed himself while he answered in a neutral tone, trying to seem uninterested. “Oh? What was it?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco saw Potter and a bunch of other Gryffindors poring over the same decree on his way out of the hall. Potter had looked up almost as soon as Draco had spotted him, a glare already on his face. But Potter had only looked at Draco for a second before the glare had melted into surprise. Draco had had to look away, not having the fortitude to deal with Potter. Draco thought he must look truly pathetic to cause such a reaction.
He’d gotten so good at covering he could convince even himself he was fine.
Draco didn’t sleep.
As Finnigan practically snarled at him, Draco had a brilliant idea. It wouldn’t fix things entirely but maybe it would help.
Draco had barely thought about the Floo, more immediately worried about the owl mail, but Blaise was right.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco spent his spare time smarming up to Umbridge, hoping to be around if Edgecombe gave in to the temptation. It was horribly taxing. Everytime he complimented her Ministry reforms he felt the urge to vomit. All he wanted to do was sit her down and make her use her stupid Black Quill on herself.
The big finale of Draco's plan
our O.W.L year. If she ruins all our other classes I’m bound to fail. I’m not as much of a swot as you are after all.”
Draco stared at Montague with a frown. He’d forgotten about that. “Whatever happened to that old cabinet anyway?”
Several people around them gasped and started whispering to each other. Draco did his best to not react, making the most of his Occlumency skills. He had definitely not known this. He could just see Pansy shooting him a concerned look from over Nott’s shoulder.
“Oh!” Luna skipped a bit. “That’s wonderful! Did you tell him you’d be guarding the door?”
Draco couldn’t seem to stop while he was ahead. “What’s it matter to you what happens to me, hmm? It’s none of your business, you made that
Draco,
Thanks again to my beta: FerchKalvaNiibi
Draco whipped his head around to stare at Vincent, his heart practically a stone in his chest. “What. What did you just say?”
Draco’s eyes practically fell out of his head in shock and horror as a Bludger slammed into Potter’s back so hard he was almost folded in half backwards before he fell forward off his broom and to the ground.
Draco turned away from the door to write down some of his observations to Luna.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Let me guess. Potter made that one?” Draco pursed his lips and didn’t answer. “I knew it. You are unbelievable. If you were any more whipped you’d be another Colin Creevey.”
Draco understood the draw in fooling around though, so he couldn’t really blame either Blaise or this Marco. He couldn’t believe it when one of the Durmstrang boys had flirted with him last year. It was like a breath of fresh air to be attracted to someone that wasn’t Potter. Someone that wanted him back, even if neither had any real feelings.
Zabini saw his look and smirked. “It’s eleven in the morning, you can’t blame me. I am, however, very much interested in hearing more. I find it curious that you wouldn’t like Umbridge, Malfoy. I was under the impression your father may have helped put her here.”
Luna moved to retake his arm and gave it an extra squeeze as they walked. They were silent for several minutes as they approached the spiral stairs that led to Ravenclaw tower.
Pansy pursed her lips, then threw herself back across Draco’s bed. Draco crossed his arms at the dramatics. “No, I’m not like you. I do like boys. We’ve made a deal that Draco’s to propose if I get no other offers.”
Draco grit his teeth. He wasn’t sure how to respond. This could not be good.
“I promise!” Edgecombe was practically crying now. Draco half wanted to roll his eyes.
He had thought it was temporary at the time, that boredom. But being back at the manor just reminded him of how much it wasn’t temporary.
“Draco, if you were a bad person you wouldn’t feel you had to make up for it.”
They both figured it wouldn’t be too bad being married. Draco certainly had the fortune Pansy wanted. And the manor. And Pansy would be free to be with whoever she wanted on the side because Draco wouldn’t care. The act of producing an heir would be awkward, but hopefully brief, and Pansy’s feelings wouldn’t get hurt when Draco never wanted a repeat performance.
Draco kept his eyes up while scribbling.
Draco rolled his eyes and went back to his own breakfast, more able to eat now than he had been last night.
Blaise heaved a heavy sigh. “My father was a disgrace of a pureblood. He defied tradition and instead of going into politics he joined the Italian Aurors. Mother and he had been childhood sweethearts. Mother was more of a traditionalist, but she loved him and thought him brave to follow his heart. So they got married. Mother was disowned. It broke her heart, but she thought it was worth it. They had me and were happy until I was about five. He died during a raid.”

Almost all the fifth year prefects had tried to get a post on the seventh floor that night, probably to cover their own absences. Draco had put his name in for the corridor by the Gryffindor portrait again. So no one would expect him to have wandered over to this side of the floor.
There were nods of agreement all around.
Blaise buried his face in his hands as if not seeing them would make them forget what they’d just heard.
