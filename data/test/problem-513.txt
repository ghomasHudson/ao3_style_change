However, Draco is not going to wear his hat any longer than necessary—it flattens his normally fluffy hair—so he quickly stuffs it safely into his bag.
This doesn’t really pertain to Draco, because he has too much on the line to be focusing on this game. He can’t slack off on his studies, because he needs to do well on his NEWTs and get a good job. It’s what is expected of him, so personally, he doesn’t have a preference for who his target is. He’s not obligated to go after them if he doesn’t want to. Besides, he won’t have time since he spends most of his afternoons in the library. He would prefer not to upset Madam Pince and feel her wrath because of this ridiculous game. It’s so juvenile—
Harry laughs, picturing the instance in his mind. It saddens him a bit, thinking about how much simpler that time had been—even with the stress of Buckbeak and Sirius.
He turns his attention stubbornly to the fireplace of the eighth year common room where McGonagall—the new headmistress—is standing, waiting with practiced patience for the students to settle. How this woman has yet to lose her mind from a career of enduring hundreds of rambunctious children nine months out of the year is beyond his intellectual capacity.
“I don’t believe you,” Draco taunts. He can almost feel Potter’s face on his own, his breath tickling his cheek.
Ever since the encounter at the kitchens, Theo has been trying to get the two of them alone. As much as Draco normally enjoys Theo’s company, he doesn’t want to be pestered about leaving Britain with him. He contemplated the offer thoroughly, and he can’t leave Pansy or his mother behind in good conscience. Draco knows they would both refuse to come, insisting they would appear weak to the rest of Wizarding Britain. Both of them have been working to rebuild their social statuses, so fleeing is not an option for either of them. They would never forgive Draco for going without them. A part of him may also be afraid of Theo making another move on him, which could be detrimental to his studies if it escalates past a kiss on the cheek.
Draco shudders, remembering when Peeves dropped them in the corridor during second year. He was just walking back to the dungeons after Quidditch practice when he was completely bombarded. He took five showers that night, and had smelled no better than he did before.
“Close your eyes, and breathe. Only focus on the sound of my voice,” Theo says, rubbing his thumbs into his shoulders. It’s utterly distracting, but Draco doesn’t say so.
He quickly hides in the nearest section, trying to regain his breathing as his chest tightens. Too much is happening at once, and his mind is spinning out of control. He closes his eyes, but rising flames engulf his sight. He quickly opens them, focusing on the books in front of him and taking deep, slow breaths to calm his heart beat.
Theo steps up to him and reaches his hands out. “Can I…?” He trails off, placing his hands on Draco’s shoulders when he nods in assent.
A familiar thrill spreads through his veins, giving him the urge to push Potter further, “Despite what you may think, I don't bow down to you Oh Great Chosen One. I have the right to this common room just as much as you and your—” Suddenly he feels a hand grab his arm, tugging insistently at his robe.
Before Draco has a chance to move, he thinks he sees a figure move in his periphery, which is gone when he turns his head to look. He swears he caught a glimpse of someone, the cuff of dark trousers. Shaking it off, he follows Theo into the kitchen; He has more urgent matters to attend to.
“No, it’s not you, although even as I say that, it could be untrue,” Pansy says slyly and turns to Draco, “But yes, let's meet in your dorm right after Charms so we can brainstorm ideas.”
After stalling as much as possible in the Great Hall—chewing his food slower than a flobberworm according to Pansy—Draco reluctantly heads over to Coach Sylvester’s office, anticipating his potential demise. Summoning him to meet her alone is a terrible sign, so he is not particularly ecstatic for this meeting.
“I just thought we could go study in the Library together,” Theo says, without explicitly rejecting the idea.
The Manor has yet to dissolve the ghosts of the events from months prior. If one pauses long enough in a vacant corridor, they could still feel the once prominent presence of the Dark Lord as he stalked through the dining room, blood-shot eyes piercing through anything they landed on. One could sense the smooth strokes of Nagini’s slender body sweeping the ground, following the man’s gradual, steady stride across the room like a shadow of his inner form. Or the evocation of the familiar chill that travels down along the ridges of one’s spine at the raise of the Dark Lord’s arm, wielding his yew wand, a fatal spell on the tip of his tongue.
“I think Draco can beat Potter,” Greg speaks up, and Draco is thankful he didn’t mention that he thinks Draco’s only bet at winning is dressing up like a dementor to potentially scare Potter off his broom.
“Draco, how do I use this? When I asked Blaise he just shot water at me,” He says defeatedly, and Draco flashes him a compassionate smile, knowing Greg needs it, and shows him his own water gun.
“I’ve been asking myself those same questions at least twice a day for the last seven years, Greg, so unfortunately I have no answer to give you. What I do think, though, is that people most likely feel that they owe him for what he did for them,” Draco sighs. “And though he isn’t as wonderful as people make him sound, be careful of saying that to others. People are looking for any excuse to send us away, and no one trusts Slytherins anymore.”
“Don’t you worry, Draco, I’ll make sure everything gets resolved. Nothing will get in my way, because the Slytherins don’t deserve this kind of treatment. The tide is already pulling in, and the fierce tsunami of Sue Sylvester cannot be obstructed. It will destroy everything in its path, and these foul cretins will not survive it,” Coach Sylvester declares.
“I don’t believe you, insufferable prat.” She says, with no heat behind the words, but doesn’t push the issue. She simply lays beside him and strokes his hair soothingly.
“So, any progress with your Patronus?” Hermione asks, dropping the previous subject like it was never brought up.
“I heard that you ponce,” Blaise says, appearing in the doorway of the bathroom, leaning elegantly against its frame.
“Such a show off as always, Potter. You can never pass up an opportunity can you?” he jibes, striding past him forcefully.
He thinks he can distantly hear Hermione protesting behind him, but he’s not sure, nor does he really care at the moment.
“Alright, have your bloody sickle back,” Ginny concedes, tossing the coin at Ron with enough force that it smacks into his face before he can register it coming.
“We shall see then, won’t we Potty?” Draco simply smiles devilishly and pats his cheek, feeling the slight prickle of stubble covering his jaw. He stalks off before Potter can respond, not daring to look back.
“Already?! It’s been less than an hour!” Pansy shrieks in disbelief, whipping her head to look at Blaise in astonishment.
He misses his drawing materials—his sole comfort within the dreary confines of his home; the memory of Bellatrix burning and destroying them with unrestrained glee still haunts him. The one distraction to pull his mind away from the chaos was stripped away almost as quickly as he found them, hidden deep in the back of his closet. Of the many horrific experiences he had with his Aunt Bella, that had been the worst of all. He hates to recall those rare moments of serenity, now tainted with pain and despair. He pushes those thoughts back down, cursing himself for reigniting the pit in his stomach.
As he waits for her to return, his eyes focus on the lines of the dark wooden doors that reach up to the high ceiling. He guesses it is composed of walnut due to the rich brown hue and the curves of the lines trailing the wood. He wonders who spent the time carving the door into perfection, and imagined the careful process.  His mother returns to his sight, shutting the door behind her. She clasps something in her hand away from his view, something Draco is almost positive he doesn’t want to see. Nothing good could ever come out of that room. Not after that day.
How Greg always manages to find out the menu never ceases to amaze Draco. Perhaps he’s charmed the kitchen elves with his never-ending appetite.
“Hello Granger, it seems that amongst the chaos your books have fallen victim to Seamus’ brutish endeavors, if I may?” He asks, gesturing to the books with his hand and levitating them back onto her desk when he receives no response.
“Morning Pans, yes, thank you, but the coffee has yet to kick in so if you could lower your voice to a proper level that would be ideal,” Draco responds, resisting the temptation to rub his eyes.
“Well…” Draco trails off and just stares at her guiltily until the realization sinks in, her red-rimmed eyes widening even further in shock, “You
Draco groans, pushing himself up into a sitting position. “Fuck you, Potter. You better not have broken my face or else it’s the end of you,” he threatens, putting his fallen hat back on his head. When Potter makes it up the stairs, standing over Draco, he looks up and scowls at him with all his might.
He stares back at her firmly, aware of her implication. “No,” he says, his voice hard and unwavering. He looks down at his textbook, unable to meet her eyes. “Though that doesn’t mean my actions don’t still haunt me every night. However, that was a choice I made. I wouldn’t have done it any differently. Not with my family at stake.”
They both know that neither can stand the sight of the other, so why Potter decided to pick Draco with his patronus during class is beyond comprehension. And of course Potter couldn't leave it at that, he couldn’t resist making a remark about the potential form of Draco’s patronus: “What do you think yours will be, Malfoy? I bet it’ll be a ferret.”
“They’re busy tossing the ball back and forth, but that’s beside the point!” Ginvera snarls, leaping off her broom. “They could have crashed into the stands, or even the Forbidden Forest! That was dangerous!”
Harry closes his eyes, releasing a long breath. He knows she didn’t mean it like that, but sometimes the grief rears its ugly head, and he can’t always contain it. “I know, it’s ok.”
“Oh don’t be such a killjoy, play with us! Tell us who you have and we’ll help you get them out,” Pansy asserts.
“As you say, your heinous—” He cuts off, intentionally clearing his throat, “—highness,” He finishes, his tone playful.
That seems to snap him out of whatever trance he was in, because he blinks furiously, his face flushing slightly. “I— no, uh—” He cuts himself off, pulling his eyes away to scowl down at his food and stab the eggs on his plate.
Draco’s eyes widen at the abrupt transition, and he slowly reaches out, grabbing her shoulders to calm her down, “Hey, listen to me, it’s going to be okay. Everyone knows that Smith is full of it. This is going to blow over, I promise,” He says earnestly.
They turn the corner and see Theo striding towards them, looking as charming as always. Gracing his face is a broad smile that looks natural, effortless. Upon seeing Blaise, realization dawns on him and his warm expression falls. “Did you already tell them?”
Whether the Aurors did this out of twisted humor or just by mere coincidence, Draco would never know. However, what he does know is that he can hardly do more than conjure a light or summon objects—and that’s after at least several attempts. If this was done to make Draco feel just as powerless as before, then the Aurors have proven successful.
“Good one Blaise, I’ll have to remember that. Compliment them and then threaten them with Coach Sylvester,” Draco says dryly.
The three of them stare at each other for a few seconds before Pansy bursts into a fit of high-pitched laughter. Greg joins in a moment later, chuckling lowly. Draco doesn’t quite find this as humorous as the others, so he wipes the water off his face before climbing back onto his bed, waiting for their laughter to die down.
“Of course he’s good at it, the wondrous—” he mutters, resulting in a discrete stamp of Pansy’s foot atop his own that cuts off the rest of his words.
“You know I was actually born here,” she continues. “I’m originally from Yorkshire. But you know why we had to leave? Because there are no accommodations for Squibs here in Wizarding Britain. The Ministry said I’d have to attend a regular non-mag elementary school, but my parents refused, wanting me to have a proper magical education. So, my family was forced to pack up our lives and move to the United States where they have a school designated for us. And yet they’re so worried for those spoiled Muggleborns who weren’t supposed to have magic.”
Draco looks back at Theo who’s frowning slightly as he sips his tea. Despite maintaining appearances, Draco can tell Theo is not very pleased by his efforts to avoid being alone with him, so he quickly relents. “We’ll go together after lunch then,” Draco says.
Draco startles, looking up as Hermione slams her books onto his table across from him, staring at him like she’s seconds away from throwing him out the window.
Draco approaches him once he packs his belongings, his chest out proudly. “Jealous you didn't get picked, Potter? I'm sorry to break the news, but just because you saved the Wizarding World doesn’t mean you’ll get everything you want handed to you on a silver platter. It’s not my fault that Coach Sylvester recognizes my talent.”
“This belonged to your father, though he kept this a secret in fear that—“ She cuts herself off, Draco understanding who she is referring to, “He hoped that if the worst occurred, another chance would be at his disposal. As he is not currently present… it seems the task is left to us. However, between the both of us, I feel as though you would be better suited to take this on, if you so choose,” She finishes, the lines on her forehead more prominent from worry.
Coach Sylvester simply raises her brow, looking at him dubiously. “Okay. And Potter, who I could crush with just my thumb, was the only person able to defeat him?”
In these hours, Draco no longer feels the need to peer over his shoulder at the sudden shift of a dark figure. Light serves him no purpose, for Draco has every crevice, every sharp turn, and every trick step etched into his mind as he roams the halls. Even then, the ghosts don’t fully escape him, but it’s the only form of solace he could find within the barren walls of the place he once called home.
Draco sighs heavily, thinking of how best to explain it to Greg in a way he’ll understand. He struggled for months on this subject, agonizing over it during the summer in the Manor. He felt like his life had been turned completely sideways, unsure of what to believe. He didn't see how any of what he had been taught truly mattered anymore; it seemed pointless. However, he still can’t completely get over his usual revulsion of them, his natural disdain at the mention of Muggles.
While formulating his plan, Draco recalls the information he overhead his father discuss with the residual Death Eaters during his fourth year about the Dark Lord’s return. Eventually, he determines that his main objectives are to prevent Potter from going to the graveyard and to expose Barty Crouch Jr. as Mad-Eye Moody’s impersonator.
“It’s hardly an insult, Weasley, I’m well aware of my fair, porcelain skin. I prefer it over your abundance of freckles, each one fighting tremendously for a spot on your skin,” Draco sneers, “And we’ll see about that Weasley, you underestimate my abilities.”
Draco snorts. “Older students in the other three houses, though mainly from Gryffindor. Just now on the way here, my shoulder got hit with a stinging hex.”
But Coach Sylvester doesn’t budge, and Longbottom takes a moment to collect himself, narrowing his eyes into a defiant glare, “If I could kill a bloody twelve-foot snake with the Sword of Gryffindor, then I think I can handle myself in this game, Madam Sylvester,” He responds boldly, not breaking her gaze. Draco hears a few giggles come from the table of Hufflepuff girls, and that seems to put the growing smirk on Longbottom’s face.
Draco huffs a laugh, shaking his head. “That’s it? Really? Boost your ego so that it floods the entire castle? Stupid, Potter.”
“What’s wrong? Why didn’t you come back downstairs? Greg was worried but I reassured him I would come check on you. Talk to me DD,” She prods. He knows she’s just using his childhood nickname on him to make him talk.
They may not express their affection for one another outwardly, however it is undoubtedly ever-present. In the way she squeezed his hand every time they walked into a room with him. The single tear that traced her cheek the few moments before turning to the red eyes that sealed his fate as a marked man. The warm, reassuring smile she sends across the table as they share a meal together every day. When she led him off to Hogwarts for the last time and held his head between her graceful hands, her words simple yet imploring, “Stay safe for me, my Dragon.”
“Didn’t seem like it when you sat in the stands watching like an overbearing Quidditch Mom, wanting to argue with the coach about overlooking a foul.”
“Exactly. Now you’re catching on,” Draco smirks, poised to stand up, only to be thwarted by Pansy’s yank on his arm.
As Draco reaches the doors, he delights himself in the sound of Pansy’s screech, which may or may not have been caused by his stinging hex.
“Fortunately, I happen to have the answer to both your questions,” Blaise chimes in, appearing suddenly at Draco’s side and sliding into the seat beside him.
- But Draco’s also not having a good morning, as he finds out Pansy wants to smash Flitwick and he gets into an argument with Potter and the Weasel. All before first period.
As he envisioned, none of it felt right. Although Draco realizes that the spell is stronger when he thinks of a person he desires, the memory of Theo wasn’t enough, nor was his actual presence. It dawns on him like a blinding flash of light that he can’t allow himself to lead Theo on like this anymore, not when Theo’s feelings aren’t reciprocated the same way. Without being able to explain it, deep down, Draco knows Theo is not the right person for him. In a perfect world where Draco wasn’t so fucked up, so guarded and cold, perhaps his affections would be different. When Draco gets in his moods, spitting out snarky comments, he would only hurt Theo’s feelings. He wouldn’t push back or challenge him.
As she walks through the corridors, she thinks back to the last few encounters Harry and Draco have had, the fiery tension so thick and tight between them like it’ll snap any second. If all goes according to plan, perhaps she’ll solve more than one problem.
It’s almost as if Draco’s words summon her, because Coach Sylvester herself stalks into the Great Hall seconds after his comment, her stride full of her usual unwavering confidence, as she examines all the eighth years seated at their table. The only people wearing the hats are Potter, Weasley, and of course, Finnigan.
“Now,” Theo starts, moving to the side, keeping one firm hand on his shoulder, “think of your memory, focus, and cast.”
“Anyway,” she says, blatantly ignoring his question as she return to the sofa. “I don’t let anyone try to tell me I’m not worthy. I don’t need to use a wooden stick to gain respect from anyone. People fear me regardless, so it’s unnecessary. My fists are more than sufficient.”
“Don’t even think about it,” Ginny warns, a playful look in her eye. “Anyway, don’t try to change the subject.”
McGonagall clears her throat as she stands in front of him holding the parchment. Draco turns and accepts the parchment doing as she says. Draco stares down at the elegant scrawl of his name, mystified that he will be taking part in an activity so ludicrous. He quickly places the piece of parchment back in the hat without a word, leaning back into the couch with a huff.
A figure appears in front of him, and it’s Zacharias Smith, the second to last person on this planet he wants to see besides Potter.
As Pansy laughs at Blaise’s stupidity, Draco looks up to see Weasley walking in, covering the eye Draco presumes was socked by Millie’s fist just a few minutes ago. He walks up to Hermione, his face scrunched up in pain.
Draco chuckles and places himself onto the bench across from Pansy feeling quite smug. If just the sight of his bed head is enough to disorient Potter that much, then he should wear his hair like this everyday.
If Draco wasn’t completely bent, he would also find her quite attractive. It baffles him that she has affections for the Weasel. He is one lucky tosser.
Draco gasps, widening his eyes in false terror. “Oh, you scare me Potter. I better hold onto my hat or your confidence may blow it away.”
When he’s in the stairwell, out of sight, he chances a glance back at Potter, who looks quite relaxed as he looks down at the name of his target. Draco wonders if the Golden Boy is going to take this game seriously to win and claim the fame once again. It wouldn’t surprise him. He sees Potter glance up at Granger, and Draco presumes she asked him a question.
Hermione grimaces, “Please don’t revert back to your Malfoy obsession from sixth year, that was exhausting.”
“But yeah, yeah, inter-house unity blah blah,” Coach Sylvester revises, “I want to see all of you looking around every corner. Trust no one. Not even your best friend, because they will stab you in the back.”
Greg suddenly appears by his side, oblivious to what just happened, “Ready for lunch? I heard they’re serving steak and kidney pie.”
Draco gives in, knowing he shouldn’t push her. He knows she's right, but the thought of having to act noble for the sake of those who will never see them any differently makes his stomach turn.
Draco hardly takes in a single word coming out of Potter’s mouth, because his eyes have decided to overtake his other senses and focus solely on Potter’s face. For some reason, his eyes insist on taking in every feature in display; the curve of his lips that move around as speaks and spread to reveal his stupidly brilliant teeth, his inquiring, raised eyebrows that appear above his glasses when a student asks him a question, the occasional unconscious wrinkle of his nose when his glasses begin to slip, even his untamable hair that frequently falls down, covering his forehead and concealing his one-of-a-kind blemish that he’s sure every girl of wizard-kind would avada kedavra someone for the chance to kiss.
A dangerous look flashes in her eyes and her lips form a callous grin before she speaks. “I asked the Golden Boy himself, obviously. Terribly annoying with his spluttering ‘Er—uh, yes, and?’ You couldn’t have picked anyone more articulate to obsess over?”
“How’d you do it Malfoy?” Fletchley accuses, sitting beside Smith whose smirking at Draco venomously.
Draco scowls. He refuses to discuss Theo’s offer with the others present. The last thing he needs is for Pansy to find out about it.
Draco had prepared for this, however, and he casts a tripping jinx, sending Smith crashing to the ground, landing flat on his face. As Draco strides up to him, Pansy runs to catch up and shoots Smith in the back with the water gun as he groans on the ground, in pain.
The boys gape at her, and she sighs again, “Draco actually has the right idea, so I’m going to the library to finish reading. I’ll see you both in Potions,” She stands from the table, kisses Ron’s head, and sends Harry a brief smile before departing, putting her head in her book.
Draco sits there, feeling quite awkward at her fierce tone. He may hate Potter with a burning passion, but Coach Sylvester seems ready to commit murder at the thought of her previous adversary. She looks admittedly terrifying.
This rule didn’t nearly affect Harry or Hermione as much as it did Ron. Harry always avoids speaking of the war if he can help it, saying as little as he can get away with when it does come up. But Ron got in the habit of rehashing everything, which Hermione had gathered is his way of dealing with the trauma. On nights when his mood was particularly sour, she would pull him outside and allow him to let everything out, holding him tightly and stroking his head as the words and tears spilled out.
At the end of the clinic, Draco sees Potter standing at the edge of the pitch with his arms crossed, looking put out. But Draco has no ounce of sympathy towards him, because Potter did this to himself by enduring the cold for no reason other than to be a wand in Draco’s arse.
As per usual, the explosions never fail to make Blaise jump—earning a whack from Pansy and a remark from Draco. In the end, Greg wins, and the proud look on his face is enough to make Draco’s whole week.
“No, I say that as a reasonable person who prefers to get the proper amount of sleep. I’d like to be fully awake for my classes, thank you. And my knickers are
Draco doesn’t need to look at her to know she’s smirking. He almost—almost—gasps in shock, but he refrains at the awareness that Smith himself is sitting at a table near the couch, laughing boisterously with Fletchley.
Draco attempts to tug his hand away, to no avail. “Impressive. It seems your seeker skills haven’t abandoned you since the last time we played, lucky you. Now, if you couldn’t already tell, you bespectacled git, I am not a snitch, so if you could get your grubby hand off my wrist, that would be grand. I don’t want to catch your Gryffindor germs.”
,” Pansy groans, “Please don't get into another rant about it. If you do, my ears will finally wilt from all the years they have suffered your incessant whining.”
At the look of terror on Pansy’s face, Draco relents, “Fine,” He breathes, “But you haven't seen the last of me and my evil schemes. Beware of my wicked blood rituals, Weasley you could be next! Watch your fingernails!” He calls as Blaise and Pansy drag him up the stairs to the dorms.
Coach Sylvester’s smirk widens. “Because when I consulted with the Headmistress on who I should ask to help out, she insisted that Potter was the best choice, raving on about him being the youngest seeker in a century or whatever. I wasn’t having it, so I asked her who else played, and she mentioned you. I knew you would be perfect.”
Hermione lets out a heavy sigh, clearly fed up with them. It doesn’t take much to irritate her when she’s focused on her revision timetable.
Draco releases Pansy as she grumbles at him in offense. His scowl deepens from his embarrassment and he crosses his arms. He’s not afraid of her. He just can’t afford to ruin his perfectly sculpted nose is all.
“That’s so daft. As if winning this trivial game will be enough to overshadow the unfortunate matter of his lack of height. It’s not worth the sheer degradation.” Draco mutters.
Pansy clicks her tongue and smacks his arm reprovingly. “I hardly believe I annoyed you enough to the point where you are choosing to subject yourself to pursuing Potter. Although… saying it out loud, it does make sense.”
“Draco, I know your ability to wait is as long as my hair, but you’ll be alright love,” She soothes, flipping her bob with an affectionate eye roll.
“Ah, of course it was about me. Those two couldn’t keep my name out of their mouths if you threatened to banish them to Antarctica.”
As the book lands in front of her, Granger jolts back into reality and looks up at him, schooling her features into a neutral expression. “Thank you, although I could have quite done that myself,” She says with an overly formal tone, but Draco also caught the gratitude behind her words.
Draco nods solemnly in understanding. “True, and in all honesty, I think I haven’t taken you all into consideration either, so I apologize for that. I’ve been reevaluating everything around me the past few months. I’m… getting there.”
“There is something I would like to show you, Draco,” she says, her voice briefly faltering before collecting herself. Draco’s stomach drops at the sight of his mother. He has been with her long enough to know when apprehension is circulating through her body, even when she may be hiding it. The lines of her face have worsened, aging her more in the past few months than in the past several years. Her once long luscious strands have thinned. However, Draco still considers her to be the most beautiful woman he has ever laid his eyes on.
This gives Hermione an idea. No matter how much she badgers Draco about seeking help from Harry, he refuses to do it. She’ll never admit this to Draco, but she knows Harry has a better chance of winning the match than he does. Perhaps if she pushes just a bit, things can work out for the both of them. “Oh, that’s right, he did happen to mention that last I saw him in the Library.”
Draco nods absently before scanning the room, deciding to sit in the chair closest to the door out of precaution. He listens to her as she makes the tea, ensuring she isn’t making any sudden movements.
“I bet you do, I wouldn’t expect a mediocre plan from either of you. So go make the Slytherins proud.”
“I am aware that the name sounds quite alarming, however no real murders will be taking place. In this game, each of you will be given a name of one of your peers, and that person will become your target. I will provide you all with a muggle device referred to as a water gun and you will track your target down and shoot them with water. Once you eliminate your target, you will assume their target. The only way to remain safe is by wearing this hat on your head, and our house elves were kind enough to make them for you all” Professor McGonagall pauses to gesture to a massive, unsightly witch’s hat placed on the coffee table.
“So, I got Bones out of the game,” Theo says shyly. “Without any help,” he specifies, turning to Blaise with a pointed look.
Draco sneers. “That was my intention. And don’t pretend you aren’t already aware of how dramatic you are.”
“Alright, let’s start off with a race. First person to reach the goal on the opposite side of the field and return to me wins. Line up, let’s go!” He shouts, waiting only a few seconds before counting down “Ready, set, GO!”
Draco opens his mouth, an apology on his tongue, but he chokes. Unable to speak, he closes his mouth and simply nods to her again. He can apologize tomorrow, there’s no need to rush. He turns around to return to his table when he nearly runs straight into a familiar figure. Draco’s eyes refocus and take in the upclose sight of round frames. Potter. He takes a second to adjust himself, and narrows his eyes.
She drops the quaffles in her hands to turn toward him, her gaze cold. “I don't know what you did for her to pick you over Harry, but don’t pull anything on the kids, got it?”
“Distressed and happy I get the same result. Fantastic.” He mutters to himself, taking note of his utter failure.
thing I wanted to avoid. And the only person backing us up is Coach Sylvester, but who’s going to believe her? No one likes her!” Pansy cries frantically.
And of course, Blaise insisted on keeping the scarf, deciding he would start a new fashion trend. “I’ll call it: Potter-chic! He’s all the rage right now anyway, what with saving us all, so it will be splendid. I’ll make a fortune.” Draco was not amused by this in the slightest.
“I don't know how one could go about forgetting such a thing. It’s horrendous. It flattens my hair out so horribly that I have to spend extra time fixing it every night. I feel like I’m becoming Blaise and Draco!” She cries in dismay.
“What the hell was that?” She shouts, zooming towards him on her broom, anger radiating off her small figure.
A scoff is heard a few seats over and Draco doesn’t have to look to know it’s Weasley being a git. McGonagall turns her reproving gaze to Weasley, which quickly wipes the disdain from his face and replaces it with fright. She pauses for a beat longer before addressing the rest of the common room once again.
Thanks for reading! Taking a bit of a break because I need to catch up on school, but I will try to update soon. :)
“You think I’m daft? If you paid attention for five minutes you’d see how miserable he is with large crowds. Besides, Harry is a horrible liar.”
The boy gulps, looking more nervous now that he has been directly addressed. “I mean… he was the first player in a
“You really think he’d want to help me?” Draco asks incredulously. “Surely, he has other fangirls to help with their homework. And I don’t need it anyway, I’m perfectly capable of handling this on my own.”
Draco scowls, clenching his fists. “Of course I’m acting unusual, Potter. Isn't that what you all want? For me to simply keep my head down and act properly chastised for my actions? Despite what you may think, I’m not hurting anyone. I’ve been minding my own business, so fuck off, because you have no idea what the past few months have been like for me.”
Draco arches a brow in challenge. “You imply that I’m not to my full potential? That’s no way to charm a suitor. Your skills are a bit rusty.”
“AHH!” Blaise leaps in fright, practically sitting in Draco’s lap while clutching onto him for dear life. “Pansy, stop!”
“Yes, I’ve seen that plenty,” he says dryly into the lip of his mug, taking a long sip of his tea. There’s a brief pause where Draco thinks it’s the proper moment to make his exit when Coach Sylvester breaks the silence.
Theo’s eyebrows shoot up in interest, and he moves to sit at Draco’s desk. “Oh nice! I finally managed to conjure mine a few nights ago. It’s a hummingbird!” He shares, his eyes lit up with pride.
As Draco enters the corridor, he’s already envisioning a glorious post-dinner nap when he almost gets knocked over by a fast-moving force. This is the second time this week, for Merlin’s sake, can he get a break for once? As he composes himself, he sees Thomas booking it down the corridor, running like his life depends on it.
“Well, I’m going to wake Greg now. I’ll see you all in class,” Draco says abruptly, packing his things and standing from his seat. He turns to Pansy who is giving him a pointed look, seeking an explanation from him. There is nothing he can say that won’t reveal the truth, so he gives her a reassuring smile and quickly walks out of the Great Hall.
Great, what a wonderful activity to have these students partake in to forget about the war a few months prior. A game that involves murdering one another.
Pansy knows that Smith is the one person Draco wouldn’t be able to resist going after. Behind Weasley and Potter, Smith is one of the most obnoxious gits to ever exist. When Draco was still a prefect, he gave Smith more detentions than every other person combined, because he never left Draco alone. Smith always cornered him in empty corridors and attacked Draco’s neck with his mouth, firmly grabbing his arse.
McGonagall, who no longer looks very pleased, says “The last student remaining in the game will win 100 galleons and a year long supply of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky, provided generously by Madam Rosemerta.”
Draco slumps over the table, fighting to keep his eyes open. He is not in the mood for chatting this morning, but Pansy has yet to stop talking his ear off.
He exits the castle braced for the cold, and treks over to Coach Sylvester’s cabin placed near the quidditch pitch. He realizes that this was never here before, and he wonders if she demanded she had one built for her. Draco swallows back his panic, reminding himself that Pansy will surely notice his absence… or at least Greg. Well, he hopes so.
“If I’m being honest, I wasn't even planning on doing it, but then today she walked right in front of me without her hat on. I had my muggle water-shooting contraption with me, because Blaise never allows me to leave our dorm without it, so I couldn’t resist. All I did was shoot her from behind,” Theo says.
“Yes you’re right, my Transfiguration textbook. I’ll see you in class,” Draco says, leaping out of his seat.
Theo leans in, placing a soft kiss on his cheek, which leaves a lingering tingle in its place. Draco can’t budge from the spot. They stare at each other for a moment, a heavy intensity in the air.
“I got you, Draco!” She says victoriously, pinching his nose the way they always do at the end of a tussle, signifying a victory.
“Since when have you been a legilimens?” Draco pokes playfully, and Theo sends him an intense expression that he can’t decipher. He’s been doing that a lot recently, actually. Draco turns away uncomfortably, choosing to look out the long window of the corridor instead.
Draco returns to his room, his bones aching with exhaustion. It was only a couple hours in the air, but spending that time with snotty children completely sucked the life out of him, more than a Dementor ever could. When he opens the door, he sees Greg lounging on his bed, frowning down at his homework. Draco kicks off his trainers and stumbles over to his bed, falling face down on it with a thump.
He interlocks his finger in his lap, trying to keep himself from staring at his arm. “Well, my family, we’re Purebloods, and my father was one of his most loyal followers during the first war before I was born. When V-Voldemort returned, my father crawled back to his feet.”
He ignores Potter’s childish remark, instead arching a haughty brow and taking a step closer to him as an intimidation tactic. “Perhaps it’s just that scar of yours infecting your brain, making you act completely mental.”
“Yes, Potter is a complete barbarian, running through the common room at this hour, disturbing everyone who is just trying to mind their business. It’s deplorable.”
Draco had much time to reflect his life during his stay at the Manor as the ministry most likely wanted him to do. He still doesn’t quite understand why some wizards think it is acceptable to mix with the muggles—they are destructive creatures—but he doesn’t believe this justifies murdering them all in cold blood or ruling over them. Draco would just prefer to live separately from them.
“I bet you would, you Death Eater scum,” the boy snarls, eyes scanning over the four of them. “Get out of this school. You all deserve to rot in Azkaban,” he jeers, throwing a hasty jinx before dashing around the corner out of sight.
Pansy scoffs. “I’m insulted that you think I’m daft enough to believe that excuse. What did Potter do? Did he push your shiny buttons a bit too hard?”
Producing a Patronus is something Draco set his mind to before the start of school. He can’t pinpoint the exact moment he came to this decision, but he knows that it’s just something he wants to prove to himself that he can do.
“I’m joking, don’t wet your pants,” Coach Sylvester continues. “But I won't be when you get to try outs and don't make the team. So, each of you split up into groups by which position you want to play. All the Seekers go to Malfoy, Chasers go to the Weasley girl over there, Keepers go to Wood near the goal posts, and I’ll take the Beaters.”
“Shut it, Panties,” he spits. He’s only just met his little group of aspiring seekers, but he feels a bit protective of them now.
“That’s quite enough, thank you.” Blaise says, sliding up next to Draco, slipping his arm around his shoulders, “I think we should all heed McGonagall’s words regarding inter-house unity, yes?”
“Blimey,” Potter grumbles, clambering to his feet. “I know that was you Malfoy, I’ll be back for you!” Potter calls, running out the Portrait.
Draco turns back to see them all neck and neck, with the older Slytherin boy slightly ahead of the rest. He jerks upwards causing the rest to follow suit. They chase after him, bumping elbows and heckling one another to get ahead. Draco purposely slows down a bit, enough where they don’t notice. Eventually, they begin to catch up to him, and once they fly high enough into the air, he turns back into the direction of the goal posts on the far side of the field, putting them off track. Purposefully.
Draco bursts out of Transfiguration class later that morning feeling frustrated that he couldn’t manage to turn his toad into a silky, slytherin green scarf as he intended to. Normally he effortlessly excelled in this class, never struggling to complete the assignments. But today every attempt resulted in a red, woollen scarf filled with small lightning bolts. It didn’t help that Professor McGonagall looked secretly amused by the mishap.
Hermione scowls, “Fine, but it’s not like your obsession actually prevented—” She cuts off, realizing what she’s saying and looks away, cheeks flushed in embarrassment.
Ginny herself hasn’t pushed for anything to happen after the kiss in the common room. He can’t tell if she can tell how he’s feeling and she’s waiting for him to take initiative, or if she feels the same way as him. Harry hopes it’s the latter.
“You guys should do a seeker's match!” The young Hufflepuff girl chimes in, her eyes bulging with excitement as she bounces on her toes. “Also, your hat looks quite silly!” She laughs, and it appears that she has quickly gotten over the Death Eater issue. Isn’t he more intimidating? He’s quite insulted.
“I’m not speaking to you.” Draco glowers, looking resolutely down at his plate, still not feeling much of an appetite.
Draco simply nods his head yes, fearful of opening his mouth, wanting to keep the monsters inside him from clawing their way out towards her. His mother is the only person left in the world he loves. Not that the numbers were ever very high, before.
Blaise gasps, striding over to Draco in a few, short steps, and he snatches the letter out of his hands. Blaise quickly scans the letter before handing it back over, looking very displeased. “
Draco swallows uncomfortably, bracing himself for her potentially negative reaction. “Well, he gave my father a mission and he failed to complete it. At the time, I didn’t realize it, but the Dark Lord allowed me to become a Death Eater as a punishment to my father. He gave me an impossible task and if I failed, he would kill my mother and I. Ultimately, he was setting me up to… to die,” he chokes out.
He agreed to it only because she praised him over his quick reflexes, and it wouldn’t hurt to rub this in Potter’s face.
“Anyway, I also found out from the Savior himself that he doesn’t want to get back together with She-Weasley,” Pansy declares.
“Make sure to get my favorite biscuits. The ones I make sure the houselves keep there for me,” She mumbles before Draco has a chance to even answer.
Potter’s eyes widen comically as he opens his mouth and closes it before speaking. “You’ve just been acting a bit… unusual, that’s all. You’re much quieter,” he stumbles.
“You’re only saying that because you get your knickers in a twist in the mornings, Draco.” Pansy counters.
“No. When Potter suggested you were up to something and Weasley was insulting you, Granger practically told them where they can shove it. She said it’s not right to treat you so harshly after everything that happened last year, which I actually agree with. She did mention though that she hasn’t forgiven you yet.”
Getting to know Draco the past few weeks has been interesting to say the least. For the past seven years, she’s only known him as a prejudiced bully, and part of that still hasn’t left her mind. However, at the trials when she heard what he went through during the war, she began to change her thoughts on him. She thought perhaps he wasn’t as truly evil as she initially thought, and that there was more depth to him than he was allowing others to see. Hermione’s been coming to realize that some things are more complicated than they may appear, and she feels she may as well give people the benefit of the doubt, Draco included. Besides, she can’t resist a competent study partner, not when her NEWTs are on the line.
“If you feel this way, that I’m scum of the earth, then why didn’t you just dispose of me, have me sent away to Azkaban for the rest of my miserable, worthless life? As the beloved Savior, I know they would have taken me in at your word.”
But when he saw her again, blood-stained and exhausted, there was no feeling of utter relief like he had imagined. He thought once he reunited with her, he would feel like a starving man finally receiving a warm meal. Instead he stood before her in Great Hall, the life drained from both of them, and he didn't feel remotely sated.
Blaise tucks his wand away and chuckles. “It seems you were right. Thank you for the valuable information, Pansy.”
- Together, Pansy and Draco plan to ambush Smith after Divination, and when they do, he’s pretty aggravated and in retaliation, he tells everyone it was Draco’s fault
Draco takes a seat in front of the fire, Greg placing himself across from him. He hates spending time in the common room—he gets enough stares and glares in class and the Great Hall—but Greg insisted they play a game of Exploding Snap. Draco can never say no to Greg.
“There isn’t one, Harry,” Hermione interjects. “Draco was helping me with something for a moment. It’s alright.”
“How thoughtful of you, Potter. I admire your morality,” Draco mocks, batting his eyelashes. “Thank you for sparing me, your kindness is
If this silly game is all it’ll take to make his best friend crack a genuine smile again, then he’ll do it ten times over.
“Good morning Draco, how are you this fine morning?” Blaise asks as Draco starts combing his hair at the sink beside his.
They’re lucky this time that it’s four against one; in other instances, they have not been as fortunate. Just yesterday, Greg returned to their room with a broken wrist which Draco promptly mended for him. After spending several months stuck with a madman inside his home, Draco had added a few healing spells to his arsenal. This had been a smart decision, for this knowledge prevented many scars from marring his body after that point.
Hermione makes a noise of disappointment and purses her lip in thought. Eventually, her eyes brighten with an idea, and she meets his gaze, giving him a mischievous look Draco’s not sure he likes. “You know who could help you…?”
“Ron, Riddle is dead. At this point, you should be able to say Voldemort,” Harry says, giving him a side-long glance.
As he begins the incantation, he feels Theo move from his previous spot, his hand sliding to the back of his neck.
“You know, he wasn’t wrong. It’s a bit ridiculous for you to wear the hats in the Great Hall when it’s off limits to strike at your target,” Hermione points out, “And maybe he’s like that because the two of you won’t leave him alone, so he returns the attack in order to stand up for himself?” Hermione offers, looking at them as if they’re five year olds.
“I can when it makes Mum cry and George drink himself to oblivion! It’s clearly not making you feel better when all you’re doing is yelling about it. Enough is enough, we need to move on at some point or we’ll always be stuck in the war,” Ginny had said firmly, putting her foot down.
“Hello, Smith, enjoy Divination? I would assume your grade is suffering if you couldn’t see this coming in your future.” Draco drawls.
He struggles against the bindings, attempting to jerk his limbs around to free himself, but he’s planted firmly against the wall.
Ron chuckles and punches him lightly, “Hey, ‘s not my fault you’re single. Speaking of, when are you gonna get back with Gin?”
“See? Listen to the children. They enjoyed themselves. Now, go tend to your Saviour boyfriend, he looks rather eager to speak with you,” he says, glancing over her shoulder to see a furious looking Potter in the distance. He looks ready to run over and confront them, but Potter would be mistaken, because Draco knows that the girl Weasley is very much capable of taking care of herself, if that bat bogey back in fifth year is anything to go by.
The hat is large and pointy with a bell at the tip. Various patterns poorly sewn into the crown of the hat with red, blue, yellow, and green—Draco assumes to represent all four houses in a disturbing way. Around the band are small, sewn figures of the animals of each house—a lion, badger, eagle, and snake. Hanging from the edge are letters that spell out Hogwarts repeatedly around the brim.
“Of course it would be, it’s why you did it, yes? Anyway, my point stands. You couldn’t last in this game if your life depended on it.” Draco challenges.
. I won't leave the others like that. Feel free to do so yourself, but I don't want to just run away.”
Over the summer, after getting into countless discussions about the events from the previous months, Ginny declared there would be no more speak of it. Everytime a conversation veered towards anything war or Voldemort related, they had to put a sickle into the jar, which was an old watering can Ginny had found in Arthur’s shed. She kept it on the kitchen table and had labeled it “Moldywart Jar,” and Hermione thinks it's the closest she’s seen one of the Weasleys refer to Voldemort’s name.
“Yes, but if he comes back in here and hexes you, we’re not stopping him,” Pansy says, now sitting up properly and engaged with the conversation once again.
Before Draco can doze off into an angry slumber, someone tries to open the door, and bangs on it incessantly when it doesn’t open.
Before starting Hogwarts this summer, he thoroughly considered composing letters consisting of cordial, sincere apologies for those he had harmed in some way. What ultimately stopped him was the realization that none of them would have been very receptive of his words while the wounds were so fresh. The only thought that would course through their heads while reading the letters would be
Coach Sylvester shakes her head disapprovingly. “The praise always goes to those who don’t deserve it.”
“Fine, let’s get on it then. My dorm, now.” He says definitively, until his plan is rudely interrupted by McGonagall who he forgot is still standing there.
“By the way,” Professor McGonagall cuts in as Coach Sylvester passes the supplies out, “the water guns have been spelled to automatically refill themselves so, to the muggleborn students, no, you will not have to do it manually each time they empty. To the Purebloods, all you have to do to squirt the water is point it at your target and pull the trigger with your index finger. That will push the water out of the nozzle towards your desired person at about six feet maximum,” She informs.
Draco groans. “Everyone seems to be keen on examining my appearance these days. Am I that appealing?”
Draco makes his way towards the en suite bathroom, focusing on the feel of his feet pressing against the soft carpet—his attempt to ground himself. As he approaches the sink breathing in deeply, he avoids looking at his reflection in the mirror, unable to meet his own gaze now without seeing Potter standing behind him with his infuriating look of pity sent in his direction. Only seconds before the nearly fatal curse left his lips, permanently slicing Draco’s abdomen, scars extending from his hips up to his sternum. He can never seem to escape that emerald gaze behind the infamous round frames, even while hidden away behind his own cell.
Draco sighs. “I will have to rearrange my revision schedule to accommodate, as I am quite busy, but yes that should be fine then,” he says.
His stomach flips at her words, but Draco ignores it. He knows that Potter will make up with her eventually. It’s practically his destiny after all; you couldn’t make a more perfect match than the Chosen One and his best friend’s sister.
But after a long period of introspection at the Burrow this past summer, he’d only come to one conclusion: he doesn't want to get back together with Ginny.
“Unfortunately, no, not this time,” Blaise says with an exaggerated sigh. He turns to Pansy, signature grin returning to his face, “Let’s just say I’ve finally had an influence on someone.”
“Yes, Hermione, I’m well aware that because I didn’t stop Malfoy in time the Death Eaters got into the castle and Bill’s face got maimed, thank you for the reminder.”
“Well, have you apologized to them all yet?” Pansy asks impatiently, “I feel it’s about time you do. I already have.”
Draco laughs. “Watch out Pans, Blaise is about to swoop in on the object of your affection, and the two of them will ride off into the sunset.”
“Draco!” Pansy shouts when he approaches her, sitting up in her seat. “I was wondering where you were. I need you to help me pick out a new pair of boots. I can’t decide between the suede, over-the-knees or the leather booties.”
“You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting to hear that, Draco,” she says, something heavy present behind her guarded eyes. “Those Gryffindors think they have the moral high ground because they don’t condone the deaths and prejudice of Non-Mages, or Muggles you say, and Muggleborns. But you know who they dont give a rat's ass about? Squibs. They hem and haw about the immorality of treating Muggles as inferiors, and yet overlook us like we’re nothing more than ants on the sidewalk that they can step on.”
The common room remained silent for a moment before conversation broke out, the loud buzz filling the room. Draco quickly sets the hat on the floor and examines the strange object in his hands. It’s small, bright green, and has a tiny lever, one that looks like could be pulled back by a fing—
In the common room, Draco spots Pansy lounging in an armchair in front of the fire, flipping through a fashion magazine.
This chapter is dedicated to all my Theo Thots, so maybe grab something you can squeeze, or a pillow to scream into. Enjoy!
“Alright, it’s game on, starting tomorrow morning at 7 am sharp. Get your stuff and get out of my face.”
Draco taps his fingers anxiously on the wooden table, eyes glued to the front doors of the library. Every time it opens, he tenses in anticipation only to be let down at the sight of unfamiliar students. He chose a table towards the front, which differs from his usual one. Normally, he prefers a table placed against the wall in the middle of the library, near the bookshelves. It’s far enough back to hide him from most of the other students, but not too far back where someone would get away with sending a covert hex at him. Unfortunately, he had to learn this the hard way when he hid at the back table on the first day of term. He still receives them occasionally at his regular table, but they’re not as frequent. He’s gotten into the habit of casting a silent protego around his table when someone walks by, just in case.
Coach Sylvester leans back into the coach and smirks. “I knew you’d see it my way,” she says proudly.
The presence of darkness is a gift. It provides Draco with a blank canvas to fill with his conceived visions of himself in the Slytherin common room, lounged on the couch by the fire, Pansy and Blaise sitting on either side of him. It allows his mind’s eye to escape to a better place. Someplace vast and open where unrestrained laughter echos through the air.
Hermione takes a moment to breathe and compose herself before speaking. “Harry, if you can recall, I can handle him just fine with my fist,” she says with a small smile.
Smith gets to his feet and dashes off without another word. Draco stares at the wild storm in Potter’s eyes, the tense stance of his body, and a pleasant feeling stirs inside him. He can’t handle Potter protecting him like this; he doesn’t want to owe him any more than he already does.
“Draco shut up before I hex you,” Pansy spits in a furious whisper, ”And this time, I won’t grow your eyebrows back.”
Draco makes a soft grunt, before letting her gentle fingers lull him to sleep, his final thoughts before losing consciousness remaining on Potter’s stupid face, lit with joviality towards a joke made at his dispense.
“That’s fine, Greg, most people can’t produce one until their late twenties. I don’t understand how we are expected to produce one
“Did you do so terrible at the club that Coach Sylvester tasked a Hufflepuff to notify you of your termination?” Blaise taunts.
Potter hesitates, his eyes darting around as if searching for words in the air, and something shifts in his expression. “I… had a feeling that I’m your target. You know, in the game… because I was Smith’s target. I just wanted to make sure, that was all. I’m determined to win, you know.”
Draco winces at the touch, Smith’s hands setting his nerves on fire, and Draco wishes he could apparate. “I want your groping as much as I’d like to be kissed by a Dementor. Now, let go!” Smith seems to ignore his words as he starts grinding on him, letting out soft moans with each movement. Draco panics, and grasps at the first thought he has. “Have you forgotten I’m a filthy Death Eater? You wouldn’t want to defile yourself would you?”
“You know,” Pansy says, smirking, “Potty couldn’t stop looking at you all day, I’d say from the different hair look.”
Potter’s gaze suddenly slips away, moving downward. His eyes land on the inner part of Draco’s wrist, peering down through the opening of his robe sleeve. Draco’s mind begins racing, words spilling out of his mouth, desperate to shift his attention back up, for more than one reason.
Draco is shivering in his old quidditch robes as he stands beside Coach Sylvester, currently resenting his entire existence. No person is worth dealing with this kind of weather, it’s unbecoming. Except maybe for Pansy.
Hermione sighs, releasing a held-in breath. “I guess I can’t expect that from you so soon. But I hope that one day you’ll get there.”
“Oh Salazar!” Millie curses, glaring at him before stomping out of the room in a huff, slamming the door as she goes.
“Hey! We haven’t started yet, cheater!” Pansy shrieks, smacking him on the arm in retaliation as water drips down her nose.
“You can thank Millie for scaring me half to death for that. It appears that I’m her target, and Blaise let her into our bathroom to shoot me this morning. Thankfully, I had my hat with me, but I wouldn’t put it past her to tackle me to the ground regardless.”
“He was running away like he saw a dementor, and I sent him a tripping jinx so Pansy could squirt him. Pretty simple.” Draco shrugs.
“It is your choice if you want to wear it or risk your own vulnerability. The only time you are not permitted to wear it is past curfew outside the common room. Now, I’d like to set some ground rules to prevent any disruptions or injuries occurring,” She pauses, reassessing whether she still held everyone’s attention.
“This is a prototype created about 50 years ago when the Unspeakables first began researching time travel. Lucius’ great grandfather was part of it, and he kept one for the family should they ever need it. Lucius told me about this after he returned to the Manor, just in case. Everything is explained in these journals written by Oraios Malfoy. It includes all the research he and his colleagues had found.” She hands him two, leather-bound notebooks, both worn down around the edges. As he stares down at them, the engraved initials O.S.M., made visible by the reflections from the moonlit windows, there’s no doubt in his mind what his decision will be.
“Nice try Blaise, you’re just going to ruin it. I don’t even know who your target is, so why should I tell you mine?” Pansy argues.
“This is preposterous. And McGonagall hasn’t put any of those abhorrent scoundrels in grueling detentions yet? Or any other Professor?”
Draco shuts his mouth and sends her his most scornful glower. Who does she think she is? He isn’t going to let some old hag in a hideous tracksuit intimidate him.
After reading the documents containing his grandfather’s research, Draco learns that this model of a Time-Turner could only take a person back in time, not forwards. Therefore, Draco only has one shot at success. The Time-Turner would take him back to the age he was at that point in time and replace himself, unlike the ones recently developed where one’s previous self is still present. Additionally, it only allows the traveler to go back 5 years from the first usage, and it cannot be used again until the time has caught up to the original point in time it was used.
Draco considers it for a moment. He can’t say that Greg is wrong; she has grown to become a brilliant witch.
Her expression loosens slightly, and the corner of her mouth curves up. “Great. So, about the Charms essay…”
“Is that Potter?!” The young Gryffindor boy—Dacian—calls. “Coach Malfoy, ask him to do a seeker's match!” He pleads.
From the day Draco was sentenced to the empty halls of the Manor for 365 days precisely, the horrors of the past did not escape him. He cannot shake the fear that a Death Eater may barge into his room in the dead of night to do with him as they please. Dark circles developed under his eyes as he could no longer rest properly without feeling the looming terror of his death approaching at a moment’s notice. No individual could shake off that amount of distress after the endurance of such a lifestyle for days upon days that—without notice—stretched into months full of tortured screams resonating from the basement and constant surveillance of his every move.
“Oh, how could I? If it weren’t for you, he would have flunked out of Hogwarts after first year. He’d be sweeping the floors of the Leaky Cauldron by now.”
When neither responds, Draco turns to Pansy and Blaise, “I’ll see you two in a bit,” he says, grabbing a breakfast burrito for Greg before he walks off.
“But it was hilarious! You should have seen his face, he was about ready to soil his pants,” Blaise says, laughter bubbling out of him.
“Yes, I’ll make sure to do that, but it may take four to five business days. And I’ll need payment for shipping,” Pansy says.
But unsurprisingly, Potty and the Weasel have no sense of self-decency. They both sit at the other end of the table, hats still present as they begin filling their plates with food. Draco scoffs quietly at the sight of them. Unfortunately, Weasley catches his stare.
“I… I can’t leave my mother and Pansy behind. I’d feel too guilty, and they would be upset with me. I’d be miserable. I’m sorry.”
“Perfect, I’ll be back in a moment,” He responds, sending another bright smile to Greg who returns it, a faint blush creeping up his cheeks as Pansy crawls off his lap.
“Well I am good at charming clothes, so eat before I charm yours away,” Pansy smirks, returning his challenging look before taking a sip of her pumpkin juice.
He freezes, a flare of panic rising in him at the mention of the Dark Lord. That was the last thing he expected to come out of her mouth. He’s terrified that this conversation could end with his arse getting kicked. Even though he hasn’t known Coach Sylvester for very long, he doesn’t entirely loathe her company. He doesn’t want to get on her bad side, as he suspects she could easily make his life a living hell. He takes a few deep, calming breaths and thinks carefully about his choice of words before he speaks. “He was a merciless, cruel man,” he says coldly. “If you could even call him a man, more a monster. He murdered lots of innocent people and he got what he deserved.”
“Now, if you could all quiet down for a bit longer” McGonagall starts, “I have appointed our new flying instructor, Madam Sylvester, as the moderator of this event. She should be arriving shortly—“
“It’s not a violation when you know you want it too,” Smith breathes out, gripping Draco’s buttcheek firmly. “You’re just playing hard to get,” he breathes against his cheek.
“Well, excellent job. Now, who can tell me how Miss Sullivan made it there first?” Draco asks the group. Every hand shoots up immediately.
“Hush. Anyway, I should be able to call you something that no one else does. That way I’m special. What about Dragon?”
“Enough!” Potter shouts, eyes zeroed in on Draco, his searing tone gaining everyone’s attention. “Zabini is right. What was the point of anything that happened here if we’re just going to accuse people of the worst. This is supposed to be a game that bonds us together rather than one that tears us apart. So everyone just leave Malfoy alone, alright?” He commands firmly.
Theo makes a noise of agreement, knowing all too well what Draco went through during sixth year, and shakes his head in disbelief over the situation. They both pause their conversation once they reach the common room. Draco keeps his gaze forward, avoiding the stares he and Theo are receiving. He can sense Theo’s anxiety, hearing his breaths become more shallow, but Draco knows that he can hide it from others well.
Draco’s owl, Harold—a name completely unrelated to Potter—comes into his sight and lands next to his coffee. He’s carrying a parcel, one that Draco instantly recognizes as his Mother’s. Every year while Draco was away at Hogwarts, she would send him a box of sweets, usually chocolate, a letter, and a flower from the gardens. When he was younger, he would toss aside the letter and flower to dive straight into the chocolate. But in his later years, the letters became the brightest part of his week.
“I was just serving justice for his disruption, Blaise. You have to admit that was quite the entertainment.”
As he strides off, he can feel the heated glare from behind him. It’s almost too easy to rile up those two; he wants more of a challenge. When he reaches the doors, he stops to place the hat on his head. He turns back to Potter and Weasley with a sly grin and gives them a wink before exiting the Great Hall.
Draco snaps his head and sees Potter on his feet, yelling for Coach Sylvester who seems to be ignoring him intently. As soon as Draco reaches the goals, he stops and turns towards the approaching group, holding the snitch out to his side. “Come grab it!”
They remain silent until several minutes later when Greg stumbles into the room, “Draco, did you really use dark magic to get Smith out?”
Hey guys! Longer chapter this time, yay! I really enjoyed writing this chapter, so I hope you all like it! Another lovely thank you to my beta
“Mr. Malfoy, I am sure you have more dire matters to attend to, but I am not quite finished if you could please take your seat for a few more minutes,” she says,
Draco enters his dorm and locks the door behind him with a quick flick of his wand. He stops for a moment. Perhaps...
The next morning as Draco is groggily stumbling into the bathroom, he almost runs into a figure much bulkier than Blaise or Theo. His eyes snap open to focus on Millie who is standing on the other side of the bathroom with her gun pointed straight at him, a fierce look in her eyes. He bolts out of the bathroom and locks the door behind him before she gets a chance to squirt or attack him. It seems his former skills as a seeker do occasionally come in handy.
“Oh coming from a Gryffindor, how hypocritical. And it was not dangerous, they are all capable flyers, clearly, so I don’t see the problem. If there was a real concern, Coach Sylvester would have said so. Seeing as she’s quite occupied with her group, she seems perfectly content with my coaching methods.”
McGonagall is cut off by the sudden crash of the portrait swinging open, hitting the wall, as the Coach in question walks through it.
“Well, it’s the treatment she deserves for how magnificent she is. Shame on you for not doing the same!” he cries, aghast.
I remember!” She snaps, sending Ron a fierce glare, “But that doesn’t mean we should stoop down to his level and treat him the same as he did us. We would be just as bad as him and all the others who treated people like me horribly,” Hermione softens slightly, “Trust me, I get how hard it is going to school with Malfoy again. You don’t need to forgive him, I haven’t either. He’s still prickly like he used to be. But feeding into the hatred will put us right back where we started. It’s not right to treat him poorly. We’re all just kids who got sucked into this war.”
Ron’s fork clatters onto his plate as he stares at Harry in disbelief. “But he almost bloody well took me out with that poisoned drink. And what about what he did to Katie Bell?”
Hermione flushes, grabbing a book and opening it forcefully. “N-no of course not, that’s—anyway! The point is, Harry won’t stop talking about it, on top of how he’s going to get you out of the assassination game, and it’s getting out of hand.” She takes a quick glance around before casting a spell. “Just a silencing charm, relax. But you don’t understand how far he’s taking this. I caught him taking drops of Felix Felicis the other day so he could get out Anthony and then Parvati! And he wouldn’t listen to me when I insisted he didn’t take it, I couldn’t believe it!”
Draco flops onto his bed, head first into his pillow. Stupid Potter. It’s not like Draco wanted to part of this stupid game. If only he could strangle the git without being sent straight to Azkaban. He doesn’t care that Potter spoke in his favor at his trial, it doesn’t make up for his irritable nature. His unruly hair and savior complex make Draco want to shove him against the wall and smother him.
“It’s a gift, I know,” Blaise says suddenly, leaning gracefully on the doorway, the bell on his hat jingling faintly, “What are you two hooligans up to?” He asks, moving to sit on Draco’s bed next to Pansy with Theo hot on his trail, placing himself beside Draco.
“You made a bet over a Seeker’s game with Harry! How many more bets do you need to make with him before you’re satisfied? Or is it never-ending? Will we be eighty when the two of you bet each other to race on your walkers to the nearest bathroom?”
He enjoys the silence of the castle as he walks, glad to have a bit of respite from harassers during school hours. If anyone attempted to ambush him at this hour he would most likely have the advantage, for he did not survive the Manor without learning how to detect a person’s precise placement based on the slightest movement.
The next 94 days are spent resolutely scouring the library for texts that will help him form a plan. Draco does not want to dive straight into this and improvise; he may be a lot of things—a Death Eater for one—but he is no Gryffindor. He has dedicated almost every hour of every day into constructing the most flawless, elaborate plan conceivable in order to prevent Voldemort from coming back to life. His mind whirled of endless possibilities that could occur due to potential actions; he wants to prepare for any and all scenarios so that no curveballs can be thrown his way. Draco knows how risky this plan is, but he officially has nothing to lose at this point, because the worst has already happened.
“Yes, I know. Apparently, Finnigan, in true Gryffindor fashion, is determined to win this poor excuse of a bonding exercise. I’d assume it’s for the free alcohol along with an ego boost…”
“Draco,” Theo says fondly, placing a gentle hand on his arm, which drains all the irritation out of his system.
cheated in) while sitting in front of the common room fire, and knowing smiles across the table at dinner during Blaise’s many vainglorious rambles about his appearance.
Draco fails to comprehend why Potter isn’t off gallivanting with the Aurors, fighting crime and capturing dark wizards like he was always meant to do. It’s no secret that he and a few other noble Gryffindors were offered positions without the need for their NEWTs, so the right choice seems quite obvious to Draco. Potter would fit into the role perfectly, saving innocent people and serving as the Ministry’s poster child; this would simultaneously inflate Potter’s ego as well as tremendously improve the Ministry’s current image. But instead he has returned to Hogwarts simply to brag, rubbing in the fact that he doesn’t have to be here as he already has a set career in place.
“He only completely humiliated me in front of the children! Stomping over to challenge me to a Seeker’s match.”
“It amuses me that you assume I’m powerful enough to break the magic involved. Although, it doesn’t quite surprise me that you think so. You didn't even believe your best friend when he said he didn’t place his name in the Goblet of Fire back in fourth year. You just lack the common sense you
Draco quickly glances down both sides of the hallway just in case Millie is lingering nearby and looks back at Reina when he doesn’t see anyone present. “Draco is acceptable off the pitch,” he says, accepting the parchment, “and thank you.”
Potter is behaving so oddly, Draco can’t put his finger on it. He doesn’t think he’s ever been carried like that by Potter, and he especially never imagined that ever being a possibility—one that he would obviously loathe to ever happen, well,
Draco has been aware of Theo’s feelings for him for quite some time, although it hadn’t affected their friendship back then. He found out during the quidditch game after party in fifth year, their entire house drunk in celebration of Gryffindor’s defeat at the hands of Hufflepuff. Draco was especially inebriated, elated that Potter was unable to play due to his punishment from Umbridge. Draco’s plan to get him removed from the team worked flawlessly; it was quite effortless on his part, as any slights towards the Weasleys causes an instant outburst from Potter and his ginger companions.
She turns to him and crosses her arms, leaning against the counter. “And I hear you have a rivalry with that Gryffintwurp… Potter?”
The sound of Draco’s footsteps bounces off the walls of the hallway as he approaches his bedroom. The incandescent sun has long been set, replaced by the gentle, glowing moon accompanied by stars permeating the night sky. He finds the somber of night more soothing than the radiance of day as the shadows of the sun merge into a singular entity.
Coach Sylvester laughs and settles herself onto the sofa, gazing at Draco intently. “So Draco, I’ve been wanting to ask you something. I figured you’d give me a straight answer.”
Pansy practically skips over to him when she spots him at the doorway of the common room, her face so young and alive. The bell on her hat rings gently in sync with her steps, and she’s sporting it with pride, as if it’s a new trend she’s setting.
“Yes, you should.” Potter winks, and then he’s gone, returning swiftly to his seat with his fellow Gryffindors.
“Ah, well it's true, we are in fact lovers, you see, just shagging like bunnies!” Draco declares, throwing his arms up and turning to walk toward the portrait of the kitchens, which is a few steps away.
A moment later, Potter comes clattering down the stairs like an animal, chasing after Patil, so Draco decides to send a covert tripping jinx his way. Not for any particular reason other than for his own enjoyment. With a yelp, Potter crashes right on his face, and Draco thinks it's the best sight he’s ever seen—this is going straight into the pensive.
“Oh, like you weren’t just violating my ears a few minutes ago when informing me how you want Flitwick to climb your—“
“So, may I ask how do you fly a broom then?” He asks as the thought pops into his head, puzzled at how she manages it with no magic.
At his words, they appear to be moving faster, each of them trying to outdo the other. Draco swallows nervously as they gain speed and quickly approach him. The sudden overwhelming fear that they’ll all crash into him and knock him off the broom to his death floods over him, and he takes a deep, steadying breath to calm his nerves. It will be fine.
As Pansy begins to rail on him he feels a hesitant tap on the shoulder and turns to see Greg sitting beside him with a confused look.
Now, as he sits here peering at her across the Great Hall, he doesn’t feel the compulsion to walk over and greet her with a hug or a kiss like used to at the sight of her.
Pansy ignores him and, in a flash, her face turns furious, “Why did you trip Smith! Now he’s going to tell everyone that we’re cheating Slytherins! That was the
“Do you ever brush your teeth?” Draco wrinkles his nose pointedly. “Your breath is foul, you great slob. Taking after your friend Hagrid are you?”
Draco nods meekly, a wave of embarrassment flooding over him. She’s not wrong, it’s not his business. His mind whirls hastily as he tries to think of an alternative. But there truly is none.
During defense, Draco continuously fails to conjure a patronus, and he can sense that Potter is itching to help him. Every time Draco turns towards him, Potter immediately averts his gaze. After a few more failed attempts, he sees Potter start to approach him, so Draco hastily excuses himself to the bathroom. Thankfully, Potter doesn’t follow him there this time.
The paintings of ancestors that previously fashioned the Manor’s towering enclosures are gone, leaving only barriers that make up the maze of his prison. Draco gives his thanks to any potential omnipotent beings above that he was not given the same fate as his father, but he cannot ignore the cold ache that seeps into every one of his bones as he crosses the floors once touched by the balms of his worst nightmare.
“Yes, I apologize for the disruption from my hooligan children. I found them in the woods as babies, hungry and helpless. I tried raising them the best I could but they’re simply too wild.”
Draco gives her a long look, wishing there was an easy way to explain it all, but he gives it a go. “You see, everyone likes to believe they're open minded simply because they accept Muggles and Muggle-borns, and yet none of them can comprehend the stress we as Slytherins went through during the war. Pansy and Blaise didn’t want any part of the bloodshed, but if you’re Pureblood, you're expected to follow Voldemort or you're considered a Blood Traitor. There was no alternative. No third side. Gryffindors see everything in black and white. I had to do what I needed to for my family, and I didn’t trust our previous Headmaster to get us out of it. So now, our house has been tainted with the image of evil, when that’s simply not true, and they hex us in the halls as if that will satisfy their hunger for vengeance. I may have committed heinous acts, but not everyone in my house has done so. The Greengrasses, for example, fled the country during the peak of the war. Why should they suffer scorn and dirty looks simply for what Hogwarts house they’re associated with?”
Draco retreats to his room to grab his books and head to the library for a quick study session before he has to meet Coach Sylvester. As he walks over to his desk, a small piece of parchment slips out of his trouser pocket. He stares at it for a moment loathingly, then casts an incendio without a second thought, not bothering to watch as the ashes drift to the floor. There’s no need for him to read the name on the parchment when he already knows his target. Besides, Draco has seen Harry Potter’s name enough to last him a lifetime.
“Ah, I will never tire of grumpy, early-morning Draco,” She says, squeezing his cheek. Pansy laughs as he dislodges her, “Let’s go to breakfast, a nice omelet will do the trick.”
Draco can’t contain himself and laughs helplessly, aware that any wrong move will send him straight to Azkaban. “I’m all ears, but I must tell you that there are limitations to what I can do, unfortunately.”
Once they both began Hogwarts, Draco forbade her from using that nickname in front of others, threatening that he would dye her hair bright pink. It didn’t take much for her to comply.
Blaise came up with the nickname Panties back in first year when he had a terrible crush on her—somehow under the belief that it would earn her affections—and it quickly caught on amongst the other Slytherins in their year. Since then, Pansy reigns hell on anyone who ever utters the name, showering the perpetrator with stinging hexes until their eyes are swollen shut. Normally, Draco doesn’t provoke her with it, but on occasion he deems it worth it.
“Oh, like I couldn't have handled it without them?” Draco says, attempting to ease the tension. “You underestimate my outstanding dueling skills, Pansy.”
Harry blinks in disbelief as he hears the door shut. Even after everything, Malfoy still has the audacity to be a complete git. He doesn’t know quite what to think of him anymore. Before the events of the war, it was simple. Malfoy was just a snotty, schoolyard bully who sought to make their lives miserable. It was easy to hate him then, when there was no greater evil directly involved. But during the height of the war, Malfoy was as much a victim of Voldemort’s terror as the rest of them. Although he let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, it was against his will. Harry would never admit this to Ron or Hermione, but if he were given the same options to choose from—bring the Death Eaters in or let Hermione and Ron die—he couldn’t say that his choice would be much different than Malfoy’s.
Hi, so I lied. This took much longer to post than I said I would, because I wrote a lot more than I planned to. Thank you
Draco forces a smile. “Yes, you’re right,” Draco says, swallowing thickly. “I think I’m going to take a break now.”
“Malfoy, you’re not evil or dangerous. I wouldn’t have testified at your trial or returned your wand if I believed that,” Potter says, his tone unreadable.
“Ah, excellent question. You see, he hid in the bathroom connected to his and Fletchley’s room and shot him from behind as he was taking a piss. I can imagine Fletchley wasn’t very pleased to be caught in such a compromising position
In the corner of her eye, Hermione sees Harry glance up from his food in interest. He always has the same look on his face whenever Draco is brought up in conversation or he enters the room, which she finds reminiscent of a dog catching sight of a squirrel. She supposes he’s always kind of been this way about Draco, but it's worsened since the start of eighth year. Part of her is a bit concerned, but “I know he’s a bit… shrewd, but he was still a competent seeker, you have to admit it.”
After the grumbling settles down, McGonagall continues, “In addition, you may not steal or magically summon another person’s hat. That will also result in a detention and removal from the game. Understood?”
“Yeah, I was flying for a bit at the pitch and on my way back he appeared from behind, but startled and dropped his gun once I turned to look at him. Then I punched him.”
Millie shrugs, examining her knuckles. “Weasley tried getting me out of the game. Gave him a nice black eye in return.”
Ron suddenly looks up, his eyes widening in disbelief as a thought seems to pop into his mind, “Hey, wait a minute, why are you taking his side in this? Did you somehow forget that he caused—”
“She’s really smart. The other day in Charms she helped me with my wand movement, and I managed to do the spell. And… she’s pretty,” Greg confesses, a small smile appearing on his face.
Draco sits up and turns to Finnigan whose eyes are glued to Pansy’s chest like they’re his lucky pot of gold.
So no, Harry can’t trust him as far as he could throw him. However, his motives for helping Voldemort weren’t necessarily malicious. Since Harry is still unable to solve this dilemma, he tries his best to avoid thinking about Malfoy altogether, because then there is nothing for him to solve. But that’s a bit difficult when Malfoy is in all his classes and they share a common room. And now somehow he’s engaging with Hermione, which makes it even more of a challenge.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” Pansy yells, her tiny figure radiating enough fury to startle Draco to another dimension.
When Draco walks down to the common room, his hat jingling more obnoxiously than usual, Pansy spots him and immediately looks concerned when she sees his put out expression. She walks towards him and reaches out to hold both sides of his face. “What’s wrong? You didn’t do your hair this morning…” Pansy trails off, pushing the hair falling over his forehead to the side.
Draco fumes, a retort on the tip of his tongue. However, before he gets the chance to tell him off, informing him of how surprising it is Potter can stand considering how enormous his head is, Professor Byron dismisses them.
Draco can feel Potter’s breath on his face, and he inadvertently shivers at the sensation. He berates himself, wishing his body would not betray itself—not that there’s anything to betray. However, he doesn’t want Potter getting any false ideas. He’s already thick in the head, after all.
Pansy pouts, leaning back with her arms crossed, “Well, then I’m not going to tell you who I have.” She says defiantly, but Draco isn’t falling for it.
Draco’s thoughts also occasionally involuntarily drift to the library this morning when Granger stomped in, studying furiously at an empty table near his own. The first week of their return, there were a few instances where the two had been there to study at the same time. However, neither dared to do so at the same table as one another. They both had an unspoken agreement to ignore each other without a single glance, and proceed with their revision.
The boy hesitates slightly before answering, clearly not deterred by Draco’s expression. “Well… he did beat you in every match…” he trails off, looking down at the grass.
“Even in the dead of night, when you least expect it. You’ll be laying in your warm bed, cozy and defenseless, cuddling with your precious teddy bear that your parents gave you when you were a year old, the one that comforts you after a nightmare when BAM!”
“Because if you did you wouldn’t actually dare to go for me. You’d know better than to do that. Especially considering I’m the one who brings you coffee from the kitchens every morning, made perfectly to your liking.”
“No! I—” Potter’s eyes are manic, filled to the brim with anger. He redirects his attention back to Smith with a startling, dark expression. “Smith, you disgust me. Don’t touch him or anyone else again. Next time I won’t let you go as easily. Got it? Get out of here before I hex your bollocks off.”
“What a filthy looking scarf. I believe this would look best in a fire pit, don’t you agree Greg?” he said, loud enough for Potter to hear. He didn’t dare turn in his direction though, fearful of his reaction.
Draco winces, knowing Finnigan has truly fucked himself, and turns to see Madam Pince striding over to him furiously. Students clear a path for her, pure terror across their faces, and she summons Finnigan’s weapon. Finnigan stops in his tracks, turning toward her, completely struck with terror.
His sleep had been interrupted by one of his incessant dreams about the war. This most recent one, which occurred most often, was of the night the Gryffindor trio came to the Manor. In the version conjured by his subconscious, Draco revealed Harry’s identity, which led to his father summoning the Dark Lord. Upon his immediate arrival, he killed the three of them with no hesitation and fed them to Nagini for dinner. Then the Dark Lord put him under the Imperius, forcing Draco to watch as their bodies were slowly and painfully mutilated. Draco would stand there, helpless, fending off the tears that threatened to fall. The dream always ended as soon as Nagini turned and lunged at Draco, jaw unhinged.
?” Blaise gasps dramatically, “What happened to Slytherin loyalty?” He accuses, dropping his utensils with a clatter.
. When Draco moves to stand up on his own, he’s suddenly swept off the ground, now held in Potter’s arms. He looks at Potter, alarmed, and sees he looks quite pleased, showing a bright smile.
“Tell me about it,” Draco mutters, though a small part of him that he shoves away doesn’t fully agree with her about Potter.
Hermione takes a breath before speaking again. “Look, the war is over now, Harry. There is no evil dark lord forcing people to do his dirty work. If Draco has decided to turn a new leaf, then I’m not going to scrutinize him for it. We can’t act suspicious of him forever, otherwise we’re never giving him the chance to change,” Hermione pauses, “And… it’s hard to stay so resentful towards him. Hearing his experience at the trial I—” Hermione chokes back a sob.
Draco braces for an attack, but it never comes. Instead, she grabs his hands and leans in close to his face, “You have to get me out, I can’t get Potter out! Please Draco!” She pleads, the grip of her hands becoming painful.
In fact, for a while now Harry has wondered if Dumbledore knew Malfoy was in that predicament all along and chose not to do anything about it. The thought made him realize how similar their situations were in the war; pawns used as a means to an end.
“Good evening, I hope you all have had a relaxing week back at Hogwarts. I understand how difficult this time must be for everyone, so once again, I want to express my appreciation to all of you for returning here to complete your NEWTs. Your dedication to your studies is not lost on me.”
“What the fuck do you want, Smith? Come to continue pursuing your violation of my body? Let me help you. If you let me turn around, I can give you a better look at my arse, because isn't that what you want?” His breathing shallows with each step Smith takes in his direction, trapping him against the wall.
As soon as they exit the portrait, they both release their breaths and relax their postures. Draco briefly squeezes his shoulder comfortingly, and Theo returns it with a warm smile. After a moment, they both start walking down the corridor side by side, their hands a hair’s breadth away from touching.
Hermione holds back a sigh. She had a feeling Draco wouldn’t follow through with asking him about tutoring, but she couldn’t help but hope that he might. “Nothing important.”
“Well, not many people can handle hearing me speak low of the person who defeated the most dangerous Wizard of all time.”
Draco chuckles and briefly turns to Hermione with a polite smile. “Good day, Hermione.” He moves towards the doors and knocks into Potter’s shoulder as he walks past him. Draco always prided himself in getting the last word, as well as the last move—or in this case, shove.
Draco is cut off by the sudden appearance of Potter, who is sliding into the bench across from him, breathing hard like he ran over here. Blaise startles slightly, leaning away from him as if Potter will infect him with his Gryffindor germs. Draco doesn’t quite blame him for it.
Coach Sylvester blinks at him in surprise. “What? No, I understand remaining loyal to your family. I would murder the world for mine,” she says gravely, a heaviness in her tone. “Nothing to be ashamed of. As long as you don’t think you’re somehow superior to me because you flick a narrow piece of wood in the air to make frogs dance, we’re fine. Otherwise, get the hell out of my living room.”
Pansy doesn’t respond for a moment, and just when Draco is about to dismiss it she answers, “He— he had…
how he did it? Can’t anyone over the age of twelve do that spell? Draco, don’t blow smoke up my ass.”
“You know what I just heard from Blaise?” She asks crossly, stepping over to the end of his bed like a cat creeping up to a mouse. “That you agreed to a Seeker’s match with bloody Potter. But, of course, that sounded ridiculous, so I told him, ‘Draco? No, he would never be stupid enough to do something like that, because he has common sense.’ APPARENTLY I WAS
“Following me again are you, Potter? So predictable. Well, you’ve caught me, I’m up to a devious plot,” Draco drawls.
Draco startles slightly at his tone. Theo has never been so hostile towards him before. “No, Theo. I am just making sure that everyone feels included and earns the best grades they can.”
“Ah look what we have here. This is the moment that separates the imbeciles from the losers,” She turns to Weasley, “Carrot head, you look like you’ve sprouted from the ground, ready to get picked and eaten by a group of vegans. Potter, you look like a hairball that’s too big to fit in the trash bin. And Finnigan, you just look more like a gnome than you already do.”
Draco snaps. “How would you understand that when your mother is—” he cuts himself off, watching in horror as Theo’s face becomes crestfallen. “Theo… I’m so sorry. That was terrible of me.”
Draco stands frozen in place, feeling properly chastised despite not being the intended audience. He realizes the true value of McGonagall’s warning—do this at your own risk—and he’s more glad than ever that he has not dismissed her suggestion.
At the start of fourth year Draco noticed how Blaise started growing into his large frame, the muscles in his arms and abdomen defined. The first time he walked into the bathroom and saw him unclothed, he had to run to the nearest cubicle. Blaise didn't seem phased at the time, he merely laughed jovially and strode out of the bathroom, leaving Draco to deal with his crisis in private. Blaise was kind enough not to ever mention that calamity to him or anyone else, and Draco was immensely grateful. Knowing his friends, they never would have let him down for that. Especially Pansy.
“Who did you get?” Pansy asks eagerly, leaning over to see the name written on the parchment in his hands. Draco hastily crumples it in his hand before incendio-ing it.
“Ladies, ladies, you’re all beautiful, no need to fight over the most desirable one present. Everyone knows that would be me,” Blaise cuts in, “Now quiet down and eat your breakfast in peace before Coach Sylvester shows up and breaks you three in half like broomsticks.”
“I recommend you don't, that would be entirely uncouth of you,” Draco says, keeping his face neutral.
Draco takes an unconscious step back. “Don’t fear, I only planned to sacrifice two of them to the Gods, I suppose now I’ll only do one for your sake…” he drawls.
“I don’t have high hopes for that,” he says wearily, glancing back at her crestfallen expression. “Besides, he doesn’t necessarily have bad reason to suspect me of something nefarious.”
Smith freezes on the ladder before jumping off, landing in a sprint, “Get away from me. Death Eater scum!” He yells, sprinting down the hall.
“Looks like we’re not the only uncivilized ones,” Blaise says, pulling away from Pansy who is still recovering from the tickle attack with deep breaths.
“Oh come on,” Ron says, “I’m just trying to remind Hermione that Malfoy isn’t the knight in shining armor she thinks he is now.”
“Well, I’d say your assessment of Granger’s intellect is accurate, but I’ve come to realize that there will always be exceptions.”
Weasley scoffs, “No, I actually wish you did. It’d serve the Ferret right. Show the tosser who’s boss… bloody death eater—”
“How is it that after everything, Malfoy is still a self-centered prat?” Harry frowns as Malfoy disappears through the doors, furiously fighting the heat spreading in his cheeks.
Draco is failing to comprehend the words that are filtering through his ears. He wanted to learn the charm on his own devices, but now he’s going to have to learn it for a grade, which will be virtually impossible. He doesn’t want to do it in front of the entire class; his bedroom, with no one there, was quite sufficient. He rather liked having privacy, without the fear of someone’s judgement. Everyone is going to expect him to fail due to his unfavorable involvements from the year prior. He’s going to be the laughing stock, they’re going to jeer that “A Death Eater could never produce a patronus!” Draco can already envision Potter with his stupid, infuriating smug that makes his blood boil, and Draco won’t be able to leave his bed for the next week, having to fight the urge to hex him into next year.
They finally begin the game, and in the middle of the first round, the portrait swings open once again. Draco sees Patil reenter the common room with Potter in tow. Draco tenses when he notices a shit-eating grin speading across Potter’s stupid face, staring right at Draco with a predatory look in his eyes. Fuck.
Potter furrows his brows, looking ready to argue but is cut off as Draco’s group dashes over to them.
A second meaning to that phrase comes to mind, but she refrains from mentioning it. “Well, I’m sure if you actually thought this out you could have come up with something,” she says. “Anyway, speaking of Draco, has he asked you about anything recently?”
“Of course he’d help you! He can never resist teaching anyone a Patronus charm. And you realize he avoids them like dungbombs right? He absolutely hates all the attention he gets.”
Draco collapses on his bed, resting his hands behind his head. leaning the back of his head on his hands. “Fruitlessly practicing my patronus.”
