He’s having a light lunch in the garden with Mother when a huge owl flutters above them, casting a shadow over their dishes. It lands on the picnic table with a low hoot. Draco startles at the sight of it and then chuckles as it turns its satellite-shaped face his way and tilts its head. A black envelope is clasped neatly in its beak. Great grays are a rare sight in England--usually bought by some noble hoping to flaunt their connections in being able to get one sent all the way from North America--and Draco has always been tickled by the way they look like they’ve had a great shock.
Draco tosses his head back with a cry on the next deep thrust, free hand flying from the bed to Harry’s side. His moans are pitching higher and higher, pulled from bitten lips with each of Harry’s thrusts.
Draco gives the servant a contrite look. “I apologize for pulling you away from your duties. You may go.”
If they had time, they’d trade quick conversation about how much they were dreading it all, with Al weakly trying to convince them to give it a go. Now that they’re home, the roles have quickly reversed, with tender-hearted Al retreating into himself, Scorpius doing his level best to be a polite conversationalist, and Lily tentatively opening the door to her music for their grandfather to wordlessly listen to her practice.
Harry pinches him on his (unfairly squeezable) arse in retribution, which sends Draco driving against him with a low noise, his knot pulling against Harry's sensitive rim. A pleased tingle runs through him, from his head through his toes. He smiles, kisses Draco’s sweaty temple. There are worse problems to have than someone who needs to be reminded that they’re wanted.
“Mr. Malfoy! Do come in!” Cries Borgin, from the back of the shop. Then, quickly, he adds, “And young Mr. Potter, beautiful as ever!”
Harry raises a brow at him. Draco nods. Harry gives him a big, beaming smile--the kind that makes him feel like there are pixies turning pirouettes in his stomach.
After a few minutes of watching him move, Harry finally takes his bobbing length in hand, pumping quickly.
“Yes, I’ve heard! Congratulations, my dear, well done,” Grandfather Abraxas says, around the large pipe in his mouth. “Please, accept my blessings for the health of your babe.”
“Draco is my best friend,” Harry says, with such assuredness that it makes Draco’s face heat with pride. “Every time I talk to
“It’s good to see you out,” Anezka tells Draco, a hesitant earnestness in her expression. “How are you?”
Draco nods again. Harry tuts and pulls him into a hug, and Draco buries his face in the crook of his neck. They rock back and forth for a few moments, and Harry kisses his forehead when he pulls back. They already exchanged the more important words at home.
Harry is grateful to collect reports from his study, and some of the more expensive ingredients in Draco’s brewery, but not much else is to be salvaged. He makes his careful way into the master suite, unsurprised to see much of it in disarray. Half of the wall is gone, exposed  As he’s stepping in, his foot thunks into something hard. He looks down, and his stomach sinks.
Also, about clothing conventions. Draco hadn’t worn trousers before because it’s generally not something that Omegas of noble blood do, though the more modern (and nouveau riche) families in cities have started doing it. Generally, women and Omegas of all genders might wear robes that are significantly more fform-fitting than others’, though I use the term loosely since I was more thinking more along the lines of 1920s dresses a la the stylized ones worn by the Crawley women in Downton Abbey as seen
This pushes his companions into action, and they gather around him, offering gentle cleaning charms and nervous back pats, and the like. When he looks up, though, many of them won’t meet his eyes, and those who do are visibly shocked.
If Al had to call anything in their family sacred, it’s the Christmas they have before beginning their rounds with family friends. Dad hadn’t had a real Christmas until he started Hogwarts, and Father’s had always been solemn little affairs marked with pomp and circumstance, save the private gifts Nan would give him when they had a moment alone. They sit by the tree and watch those awful old stop-motion animations that Father is so fascinated by, even the one where there’s a donkey with ears too long for its head.
It’s such a silly place to kiss someone, but it makes Draco tremble anyway. Harry’s hair, always so much softer than it looks, ghost over his thighs as kiss after kiss is pressed onto the gauzy fabric. His skin tingles with a strange cold when Harry’s warm lips move away. He squeezes Draco’s knees and gently parts them, and his broad shoulders prevent them from closing again. A prickling heat is building in Draco’s cheeks, traveling slowly down his neck. He squirms, mildly embarrassed to feel himself slicking up. One good look in a mirror and he knows he’d be some silly pink color, from his ears to his collarbone. Almost eight months of being together, and he still feels dangerously indecent when he bares himself for Harry’s eyes. It’s also unfairly arousing to ignore that little voice shrieking that he’s doing something wrong.
He curls his fingers, clearly intent on finding Draco’s prostate. The pads of his fingers brush over it with one especially deep push, and Draco shudders as the intense burst of pleasure rolls through his body. Harry smiles into his skin. He pushes Draco onto his back and kneels, groaning when Draco reaches for his cock again.
“Just stay,” Draco says, throwing one long leg over Harry’s as he shimmies down their large bed. “I want to make you feel good for once.”
He’s wearing a simple green scarf, but the action still exposes the lovely length of his neck, bare and just waiting for some Alpha’s teeth to push in.
A tempus charm informs him that it will soon be afternoon. The shouting itself is not entirely out of the blue, so Harry swallows down the panic that threatens to rush forth. Draco has started shooing the staff off if Harry comes home with the guarantee of a free day. Harry has caught him frowning severely at Colin, who is terrified of him, and redirecting the rest of their staff with firm (and often frivolous) commands. It’d be exasperating if it weren’t so cute.
“And I’m sorry for that. I overreacted. I get that you were upset for me, and I appreciate that,” he adds, squeezing Draco’s hand. Draco squeezing back is a good sign, but he still won’t look up. “It’s just that saying things like that about the Dark Lord is dangerous.”
Blushing furiously, Draco nods. They’ve never nested together before, and the thought of combining it with the pleasantly cloudy headspace of submission is more appealing than he’d like to admit. Chuckling, Harry leads him through the place that will be their home for the next few months.
the first pregnancy. Make sure he doesn’t stress. Scent him if you have to leave for extended periods of time. Sit with him while he nests so he knows you’re there to keep him safe. He may be moody--please do not punish him for it. Indulge the food cravings that aren’t unhealthy, in moderation. Here's a referral for the specialist I mentioned,” The Healer adds, handing Harry a rolled parchment. “She will be able to give you more in-depth advice.”
Alecto Carrow sends her brother Amycus flying until he hits the magical barrier behind him, and then jeers at him until he silences her with an unusually powerful knockback jynx. Amycus is in turn incapacitated by Dolohov, who matters some Russian incantation, watching in casual fascination as Amycus falls to his knees and begins scratching at his eyes. Then he refuses to duel Greyback, not wanting to “risk catching his taint.”
“Er,” Harry says, feeling his brows rise in surprise. “That sounds lovely. Mr. Bolotin was very accommodating. My Draco could use the company.”
The first to fall is Watcher, bound by a jelly-legs hex of all things, but not before he blasts Yaxley with a stunning spell powerful enough that Harry is convinced he’s cracked his skull when he falls. The preliminary is over.
The diary chronicles the adventures of Michel Malfoy. He was as much of a cad as he was of pure blood, and incurably smug. The diary is half grimoire and half autobiography. It’s filled with spells and rituals Draco is almost certainly not allowed to use, as an Omega, and many meandering accounts of sums, conquests, and household matters. He would say he has no idea how the Malfoy line survived to the current day with a person as insufferable as this in charge of its fortunes, but he’s seen the family tree and knows how this particular story ends: with him, struggling not to throw a tantrum in his opulent bedroom.
“I mean, where would we have the celebrations? I was the one serving the food most of the time, and then once the Dark Lord chose me, I never bothered to attend. I wasn’t,” and here he pauses, looking endearingly shy. “I wasn’t expecting to get the chance to marry, actually, so I didn't see the point.”
After a beat, Draco sighs an affirmative and lowers himself further. Harry pulls back and admires the sight of his own come drooling lazily from Draco’s pink hole. He kisses the puckered skin, once, twice, and when Draco hesitantly rolls back into the feeling, swipes his tongue flatly over the skin. He can taste himself mixed with Draco’s slick, salty-sweet. He hums, and Draco sighs his name, rolling back into his mouth once more.
Draco hugs him tightly and mumbles a heartfelt thanks into his neck, seeking his scent. Harry strokes his hair and swallows the rush of guilt in his stomach.
He wants to present--his instincts are screaming at him to do it, even without a direct command from his Alpha--but Harry gently stalls him the moment he notices Draco preparing to turn over, murmuring worriedly about blocking airflows. Draco rather thinks that’s a load of tosh, but he wouldn’t dare say so, feels too averse to proving Harry wrong after he’s gone and called Draco a good boy in that damned
He presses the pad of his thumbs on either side of Draco’s hole, drops his jaw, and thrusts his tongue into the wet ring of muscle. He works with Draco’s growing pace, nibbling over the sensitive skin and sucking and pulling, working over the slowly loosening entrance. Finally, Draco relaxes fully and Harry is able to press further in, enjoying the feeling of fluttering against his mouth.
Later, he will be embarrassed about the scream that’s pulled from his throat, but for now, he lies back on the mattress, chest heaving. Harry curls his body over Draco’s and licks his hand clean, and then licks the rest of his release from his belly, before another cleaning charm follows. He kisses his way up Draco’s stomach, pausing to kiss both pebbled nipples, and then buries his face into Draco’s neck, licking over his throbbing mark. Draco throws his arms around Harry’s neck, holding on as tightly as possible. Harry’s pressing so many kisses onto his neck and jaw that it starts to make him laugh, maybe a little delirious.
Draco glances up at Harry, worry clear on his face. Harry squeezes his shoulder. “It’s alright, love.”
Harry doesn’t say anything for a few minutes, heart in his throat. Draco peeks up at him with reddened eyes, and whatever he sees on Harry’s face sends him into a panic. He sets his dragon aside and shuffles across the hospital bed to be as close to Harry’s side as possible, shaking hands clasping together. He realizes he hasn’t seen Draco look this scared since their wedding day, and curses himself for being tongue-tied.
“I want you to take some from me. And I want you to promise that you won’t show anyone else. I just… think you should see them.” Fred answers.
Harry dips his head to take one of Draco’s nipples between his teeth, nipping just the smallest bit. Draco thrashes powerfully enough that he weakens Harry’s hold over him. Harry pauses, concerned, and Draco lets out a keening noise of protest.
Harry gives him a look that he hopes is coy. It’d be really stupid to say, bananas and books and enthusiasm.He hollows his cheek on a powerful suck, and a litany of curses falls from Draco's mouth.
Colin steps through the nearby floo, looking green around the gills. When Harry calls to him, he smiles weakly and shuffles over. Those in support positions are not generally allowed access to Portkeys on long-term missions like this, and have to hop through a chain of floos, sometimes guided by apparition in between. Harry remembers his days of doing the same as a junior Death Eater. Even now he always gets floo powder stuck in odd places whenever he uses them because his magic goes haywire beneath his skin in a bid to protect him from nausea. At least it makes Draco laugh.
“Now,” Sonja says, guiding them to where the rest are assembled in a mountain of plush blankets and pillows, “tell us what you think of London.”
Several minutes pass in silence before Hermione lets out a rushing breath and turns around. The moment their eyes meet, Hermione’s golden brown eyes fill with tears.
Draco smiles. There was a reason Father gifted him with a diadem absolutely covered in amethysts for their wedding, but it’s nice that Harry noticed--it’s not as though he wears purple often. He rather thinks himself too pale to make it work most of the time. So he’d settled for collecting various purple paraphernalia instead.
Draco insists on trying, but his disgust at the feeling of the spinach between his hands quickly kills his enthusiasm. Laughing, Harry sets him up on oiling the phyllo dough, if only to avoid a trip to the toilets. Draco has had enough vomiting spells to last him a lifetime.
“Sometimes,” Hermione replies. “I’m an alchemist’s assistant. We work on integrating Muggle technology with magic so they can be used in the home. Sometimes it’s necessary to use potions to smooth the process out because magic interacts so poorly with technology at first.”
Voldemort smiles, a facsimile of warmth. Closed-mouth smiles always look comically insincere on his oddly formed face in comparison to the teeth-baring grins that springs forth at the expense of others. “It was my pleasure. Of course, I do have a concern.”
Returning to the Citadel for planning is especially trying on Harry’s patience, given the events of the past week. Theo and his father are a good enough buffer from unwanted conversation while they gather outside of the war room, and it helps that this meeting is going to be attended by senior Death Eaters, who are always eager to curry favor, even when their resentment radiates off of them in waves. Crabbe soon joins him, as cheerfully ill-mannered as ever, which is enough to dissuade most from lingering too long.
Tonight, he beckons one of them over, biting his lip at the flash of fear he sees on her face. As she approaches, he can faintly pick up her warm Alpha scent. It should be ridiculous, an Alpha fearing an Omega that smells sweeter and sweeter with pregnancy as the days go by. If he can smell her, she can certainly smell him, but she still looks tightly wound when Draco comes to a stop in front of her.
They give him a chorus of farewells, and then Harry is dipping his head at them and apparating them home. Traveling side-along while drunk must be the worst thing he’s ever experienced. Harry laughingly guides him to a chair as he groans and cradles his head in his hands.
He falls silent, a considering look on his face. After a pause, Beauregard picks up where he left off. “Mr. Potter, all of the people who were with you in Richmond said that you used a curse on someone. Is that true?”
“Er, yeah,” Harry says. There is no point denying something someone as shrewd as Hermione has figured out.
Draco rolls his eyes, kisses Harry’s cheek, and then takes his leave of them all with a bashful wave.
When one is given a specific target for raids like this, they are not beholden to any particular formation. It is sickening, but Harry knows that he boosts the morale of Death Eaters when his roving bath draws him across their paths. He helps one group spear their opponents with conjured swords with a strong oppugno, and aids to the shower of cascading jinxes fired off by another. At one point, he finds himself pressed back to back with Crabbe, who laughingly asks if he’d like to go for a round of drinks when they get home. He fells a brave but wizened old man with a savagely powerful gouging spell, and Harry sends a woman soaring into a wall with an
Vince and Greg are as vague as possible about their work. That has always infuriated Draco. Father and Harry are much the same. Why hide all of that hard work? Why not share their successes when they happen, instead of months later, in carefully doctored headlines? It seems strangely counterintuitive to building morale. Frustrated, Draco sips at his bubbly champagne and holds his tongue. Then Pansy challenges them all to a couple of rounds, so they order shots and throw them back in waves, hissing through their teeth and goading each other on.
“It’s modeled after the Potter family crest. I found it when I was doing my research for Yuletide and I’ve been working on something ever since.” Draco explains, shyly. “Do you like it?”
He steps into their fireplace with powder in hand and says, “St. Savior’s House!” And then steps out into one of the grandest homes he’s ever laid eyes on.
I really liked this idea for developing Harry and Draco's relationship and some other plot things, but it didn't quite fit into anything else I'd planned, so I decided to just post it as something on its own along with the next "legit" chapter. That's why it's just called an interlude despite the fact that it's... honestly about as long as a regular chapter would be. Don't worry, I don't understand my own thinking either.
“It’s macabre,” Theo repeats, smiling softly. “And I can see how hearing about its contents could alarm you, but… that’s just what we do. We’re taught things that must seem rather barbaric from the outside looking in. Some of the family grimoires I was reading as a child had pages of extremely detailed accounts of dissecting the bodies of servants who’d been killed for impertinence.”
“Are you happy with me?” Harry asks, one night, as Draco walks into their bedroom scrubbing tiredly at his eyes. He soothes Pansy to sleep on a regular basis. Her mother had guilt-tripped him into attending the various parties of the London season with her, and by all accounts, it’s an ordeal and a half.
Her quill and writing pad animate in a shudder of magic, the quill itself zipping over to Draco in playful figure eights. He smiles amusedly down at it.
And then he moves, ignoring Draco’s whine of protest. He shuffles his way out of his chemise with a sigh of relief, and runs a hand over his neck, down his chest. By the time Harry returns to the bed, carrying a few thick blankets and shirts, Draco’s squirming and pinching the hard peaks of his nipples. He’d never known they could be so sensitive until Harry got his mouth on them.
Harry gapes at him. Then, praying for patience, he turns away and pinches the bridge of his nose, upsetting his glasses.
Draco’s biting the inside of his cheek to contain his smile as Harry approaches, looking pleased and warm, steam rising from his glistening skin.
Draco wants to protest that Harry is not living in the bottom rungs of society any longer, wants to say,
A few anticipatory seconds pass before Harry feels one soft thump, and then another. A delighted laugh bursts from his lips, and Draco is smiling up at him with misty eyes.
“Lucius says horrible things about me to my face almost every time he sees me. Don’t worry about that.” Harry says, with a sort of accepting humor on his face.
He glances up at Harry’s face, and his face softens as Harry rubs at his eyes. He kisses the underside of Harry’s jaw. He gently asks if Harry would like to stop, but doesn’t question his quick refusal.
“Of course! Bring me a sample--though I’m sure I don’t need one, by the look of this cauldron!--and be on your way!” Slughorn replies, puttering back towards his desk.
“Not at all. Sometimes I still wake up and wonder if the last, oh, decade or so has been a fever dream.” Harry says, waving a dismissive hand.
“What is it, sweetheart?” Harry asks, feeling some of the tension draining from his body at the sight of Draco’s obvious cheer.
With a wince, Draco aims his wand at the fresh cut and whispers a draining charm, watching in grim fascination as his blood rises from his flesh in a lazy spiral, arcing towards the tip of his wand. Then, glancing down at the diary, he begins the painstaking process of copying the array. To his frustration, he can feel a familiar pang of want building low in his stomach. He truly hadn’t anticipated going into heat so abruptly. He ignores it and stretches his arms wide, guiding his lifeblood onto the neatly trimmed grass below.
Strong arms encircle his waist, and Harry’s rolling him onto his back. After pulling Draco’s legs up into his arms, he leans as close as the position will allow and nips and the curve of Draco’s ear, and begins single-minded, rutting fuck, punching weak moans from his throat.
The swell of defensiveness growing in Draco is so strong that his eyes sting with infuriated tears. A good portion of the anger is directed inward: for making a noise like that for any Alpha but Harry, for the sting of hurt at the blood purity of his children being questioned, and for being so naive. He attempts to tug his hand away, and tenses in fear as Thicknesse renews his hold. Draco looks over one broad shoulder for someone to call out to--a servant, an elf, another late-night wanderer. The corridor is silent.
Fuming, he tucks the letter into a little envelope to be sent off with one of the house owls. The next howler is quieter than the last, and Harry quickly realizes why: it’s the familiar voice of Cantankerous Nott.
,” and with another pointed thrust, he whimpers and comes, painting Harry’s robes with his release once again.
It’s clear in his face that he doesn’t believe what he’s been told. Harry, for the life of him, isn’t quite sure he does either.
“Yes,” Draco says, impatiently. Harry watches his face closely as he lowers his hand, both worried and vindicated when the color briefly drains from Draco’s face.
“Yes,” Draco groans. “I feel like I could fill myself up on feta cheese, most days. Don’t laugh at me! It’s the salt…”
The reporter--a short little woman in an unassuming sundress, Harry has no doubt she’s been shrinking her camera so she looks like a regular citizen and not an absolute vulture--rushes along beside them, asking question after question. She quickly seems to realize that Harry’s not going to give her more than one-word answers, so she focuses her questions on Draco, who blooms under the attention.
Draco makes a point of doing it where Harry can see: at the table for breakfast, or in the rocking chair in Scorpius’ nursery by the window so the light can hit him best, and sometimes in the sitting room. He cherishes the time to bond with their son. He is the best of both of them: blond and already messy haired, and he has Draco’s eyes but Harry’s pouty mouth, and he’s a sleepy, easy-going child. Absurdly, Draco misses him when he sleeps. The time spent together is good. Harry’s eyes on him are good. Maybe he is a deviant for craving both, but it’s nobody’s business.
Harry lifts another slice to his mouth, and Draco nibbles away at the tender flesh before sucking thick fingers into his mouth.
He hears Ginny giggling (he’d recognize that sound anywhere), and it’s like all the tension of the past few hours leaves him in a rush.
Pansy scoffs. “It’s not as though it’s your fault. Besides, I’m not the only one who’s struggling, if the state of your kitchen this morning was any indication--I thought your poor elves were going to faint dead away--”
It only takes the swipe of his thumb over Draco’s drooling slit and a well-aimed thrust for him to begin begging.
Weasley yelps--Kala has almost certainly pricked him with something to collect blood for the wards. Just as Weasley lets out a bleating sound and reaches for his wand, Kala bows first to Harry, then to Draco, grabs Weasley’s hand, and apparates the both of them away.
“Headmistress McGonagall is thinking about pairing up Muggleborn students with students raised with magic to help a cultural exchange, I think. Sounds cool.”
“Will you take me? We’re going back to school soon and I could use some dress robes for the orchestra.”
Harry’s mother is in many of the photos as well. Magical photos hadn’t come in color for a good handful of years after the war, but even without, Draco believes what Harry said about having her eyes. There’s a gleam there that can’t be replicated.
“Of course,” Draco sputters. It takes a lot to shake his composure, and Harry’s not surprised that being caught in the middle of familial drama is the source of it. Harry has always gotten the impression that he has an unshakeable faith in his parents’ word.
Harry holds his hand out for a polite shake. He immediately regrets it when Draco holds his hand out, palm down. Etiquette is ingrained into Pureblood children from their days in leading strings. It’d look wildly rude not to kiss his hand, is what a voice that sounds distressingly like Hermione’s says in his head. So Harry does, brushing his lips against the boy’s soft knuckles, unable to stop himself from pausing at the sweet scent that fills his nose. When he pulls away, Mrs. Malfoy’s smile has widened, and Draco? Draco is suddenly looking at him like he’s hung the moon. Harry curses the very ground he walks on.
Harry keeps pressing the pads of his fingers against the throbbing nub until Draco’s sobbing with it, the almost painful punch of pleasure making his thighs tremble.
Face red, Draco looks back down at his task. He does tilt his head closer when Harry leans over to kiss his cheek, though, and dimples privately down at his work for the rest of the hour. When all is complete, they help a protesting Hilda clean their workspace, and then pack for their picnic.
Harry’s made his way up, up, kissing Draco’s sweaty skin along the way,  finally zeroing in on his target--the nipple he’d left untouched. He blows over it, props himself up on his elbow to nip gently at it through the fabric, and Draco arches his back, mouth opening in a wordless cry.
The first old Daily Prophet article Al ever clipped was one of his grandmother, doing that thing she always did with her shoulders when she was happy or proud: breathing in deep and squaring them back. She’d brought it over to show him, after he asked a question about what she looked like when she was young. She’d tutted and said, “I
It’s as good of an answer as he’s going to get, Draco knows, so he does his best to hide his disappointment at the lack of certainty. He smiles and runs a hand through Harry’s messy hair, upsetting cowlicks and loose curls in one lazy stripe. He’ll have his luck cut out for him if this child inherits this mop.
They are able to exchange a few more pleasantries before they’re swarmed by Draco’s friends and other curious attendees. Greg and Vince look particularly intimidated, but they congratulate Harry all the same, clasping his hand with a newfound respect in their eyes. Blaise and Theo, as usual, want to talk theory, and Harry bashfully admits that he “doesn’t know how any of that stuff works.” Astoria is starry-eyed and quiet by Daphne’s side, and when Harry kindly greets her, she produces a flower crown and places it on his head, which he accepts with a smile. Daphne and Pansy keep asking unsubtle questions about their sex life. Draco threatens to hex them blind if he sees their faces during the fire festival.
“Of course. I might have guessed, considering what you’ve told me about your education. Oh, no, I don’t mean it that way,” He rushes to add, when Harry raises a brow. “I mean that it makes sense that they would keep that from you. Salazar Slytherin was one of the founders of Hogwarts. He was a staunch blood purist and didn’t want to allow mud--Muggleborns to attend. He was also a parselmouth. Parseltongue--that is, talking to snakes--only occurs in a few families around the world, and it’s passed down through the blood. In wizarding Britain, it’s thought that only descendants of Slytherin have the ability.”
The long trek through the labyrinthine citadel halls is finally ended when the servants lead them into a familiar walkway, framed on either side by tall columns. The familiar, sprawling gardens makes Draco sigh in appreciation, taking in the smells of the neatly placed flower patches carried on the breeze. The Dark Lord will not make an appearance until the bonfires begin, so his most trusted associates lead the feast. They’re seated at Aunt Bella’s table, and Draco does his best to pretend he doesn’t see her gesturing them over. Mother and Father flank her, visibly pleased at their place of honor, but Draco tugs on Harry’s arm as the seats fill up, and only lets up when there are a good six people between them on either side. Harry shoots him an amused glance as they take their places. Draco’s relief is short-lived. Pansy plops into the seat across from him, and the rest of their friends follow, looking youthful and happy in their traditional white robes.
“Admirable work as always,” Voldemort says, surveying the remains of their battlefield with muted glee. “I heard tell that this… encampment was causing trouble for our central forces, and thought you might enjoy the opportunity to deal with it personally.”
Draco hums, swallowing again. Harry waits until the warmth pooling in his belly feels like it’s going to snap before ordering Draco to stop, who pulls back and takes in a deep gulp of breath. He crawls into Harry’s outstretched arms, pressing butterfly kisses along his cheek. He’s warm and happy and needy in Harry’s arms. Harry dips a hand down to stroke the back of one damp thigh, and slowly slides it up to dip his fingers past soft cheeks to trace over the wet entrance between. Draco pushes back into his hand with a moan.
It’s all too much--the bounce of Draco’s tits with each punishing thrust, the way his hands curl around Harry’s biceps with his nails leaving stinging imprints behind, the way they don’t kiss so much as breathe each other’s air and Harry can see that Draco’s lips are curling up into a smile, the way his rim catches on Harry’s knot with each push. His walls cling to Harry with each withdrawal and suck him eagerly in when they’re joined again. Draco leans forward, his forehead pressing into Harry’s neck, and something about the display of trust in that simple action has Harry pushing in with one final rough buck of the hips and locking his knot inside, spilling his seed inside Draco’s warm body.
“Of course. I’m sorry I rushed you,” Beauregard says, twisting her lips in a rare show of regret. “Thank you for this. Really.”
“I bought a toy like you suggested the other day,” Draco whispers out of nowhere, nails digging into Harry’s shoulders. “Under your name. A di--you know. A heat aid.”
There are no words between them for a few moments, only harsh breaths and Draco’s fucked out giggles, which only quiet as Harry maneuvers him properly onto his side.
. The hags assembled towards the front rapidly lose what color exists in their skin, their flesh turning to stone. It breaks the tension rippling through the assembled Death Eaters, and with a roar they push forwards, firing wicked hexes and attacks, statuesque figures breaking apart in a shower of reddened fragments. It was enough of a distraction to give them the advantage, but Harry repeats charm countless times as wave after wave of bloodied hags emerge from the barn, moving in tightly controlled swarms, slashing with skeletal fingers and bursts of raw force magic.
Father, who’d scooted close to glance over their shoulders, lets out a sharp little breath. “Thank you, Lucius.”
Harry nods wordlessly. He smiles bemusedly when Draco burrows up against his side, pulling him closer with an arm around his waist. He doesn’t let go until they make it home, and even then, it is only so he can slide his hand into Harry’s and hold on tight.
raised me to be fearful of, better hope he didn’t seem like the type to beat me, and that was that, so I had better be ready!”
“We've been working together since I was given these lands. He’ll teach you, and I will thank him for his hard work and give him a generous pension.” Harry explains. Then his face softens.
“I love my husband,” he gasps out, willing his awe not to steal his words. “That is a rarity for people of my blood. But I have an obligation, and I have not been able to meet it. I am a failure.”
“Come inside me, please, Daddy,” Draco whispers into his ear, feeling a bit power hungry over the way it makes his rhythm falter. “I want your knot. I can take it.”
They all put their money and their secrecy together to present Dad and Father with a pensieve, which earns them all a tight group hug. Coordinating that had been no easy task.
They don’t finish the cake. The same house elf that walked in on them in this very kitchen all those months ago once again finds them half-naked and rutting on the aisle, with the mashed potatoes cold and the chicken burning in the oven.
of the various Smith progeny in his age group. Calliope Potter, according to gossip, was a sweet-tempered Omega woman with a surprisingly powerful singing voice. Story after story follows. Harry is related to far more people, and some of them far more recently, than he ever would have expected. Soon the photos run out, and Draco’s reserve of stories begins to wane the further they travel up the tree. Pureblood families form and die out with the same frequency of tides rolling in, so finding records on a family that had been disgraced because of the actions of its heir had to be a monumental task. Draco refuses to tell him how long he’s been working at it.
“Al, I think you’re forgetting that this was half your idea.” Scorpius points out, in English, like he’s making a point.
Harry licks his palm and takes him in hand.  Draco immediately ruts up into his grasp, a low moan rumbling from his lips. Harry pumps him from the base, slow and steady, eyes heated on Draco’s face. Shy, Draco throws his arm over his eyes. The other hand shoots out to grasp Harry’s arm, enjoying the feel of the flexing muscle beneath warm skin. Harry fists his cock and nibbles along his hipbone as he does. Each time Draco becomes impatient and tries to fuck up into his grip, Harry pauses, humming consolingly in response to his muttered words of complaint.
Once she deems him presentable, he thanks her again and she leaves after dipping into a quick curtsey, and skitters happily away. As promised, Mother is in the main sitting room, perusing the books lined up above the fireplace. She turns around and smiles at him, and his breath catches at the sight of her severe black robes. They’re striking on her pale skin, making her deep red lipstick pop. She was a great beauty in her youth and still turns heads today. She holds her arms out, and he all but throws herself into her arms, taking in her familiar scent. Embarrassed, he pulls back and clears his throat.
“The fact that you assumed your mother would lie for you does you no credit,” Father says. “Unlike you, she knows her place and she knows it well. Now sit.
This gets him the soft laugh he was hoping for. Draco pecks him on the cheek and reluctantly disengages from their embrace.
Harry transferred Fred’s memories into one of Draco’s empty potion vials the moment he’d gotten home, that day, and he hasn’t touched it since.
A rush of sound draws his attention. For a moment, he’s convinced they’ve been caught under a sudden storm and casts an umbrella charm--it wouldn’t be the first time. When he looks up, however, the sky immediately above them is clear. Then he glances back towards the mansion itself, and his brows rise.
He runs the palm of his hands up Draco’s soft belly, and over the hardened peaks of his nipples. Draco shudders, fingers tightening over Harry’s.
Draco smacks him on the shoulder, but his cheeks are dimpling like he’s trying not to give in and laugh. His hips are still rolling absently, and there’s a bright-eyed interest in his eyes that Harry knows well by now. Harry lightly squeezes his arse, and the look darkens with desire.
Albus, nothing if not nosy, walks nervously inside. Lucius’ quarters are sparsely but elegantly decorated, the high walls painted a light turquoise. There’s a writing desk by the window, and a fainting couch nestled into the far corner. Lucius’ large bed is covered with silky curtains. The en suite and attached private room are opposite each other, and Al is briefly thrown by how bare they are. As younger kids, he and his siblings made a competition out of decorating their doors as garishly as possible, and change it every year.
Even with the audience’s seating protected under several layers of sturdy wards, Fiendfyre is not a spell that is pleasant to witness. It grows and it consumes. The heat of it even washes briefly over their section. Draco lets out a gasp and hides his face in Harry’s neck. The emcee, audibly startled, announces that Muggleborn Elias Smith has just killed one of the most promising junior Death Eaters the London duels have ever seen. Harry stands and pulls Draco up almost at the same time as the rest of the audience jumps to their feet with a roar of mixed dismay and excitement. Bliswhick and the Omega woman are quietly collecting sizeable bags of Galleons while the rest of the section looks on enviously.
“Keep going, sweet boy, I know this is what you needed,” Harry tells him, watching greedily as Draco whimpers and begins anew. “Fuck yourself on my cock.”
“I know it’s a bit early for it, but have you thought about what you’d like to do for your birthday?” Harry asks.
James’ favorite newspaper clipping is of dad standing outside the Ministry in casual clothing, tiredly running his hand over his face, before mouthing the headline, “My obligation is to myself and my family first.”
Draco can’t stop himself from wrinkling his nose when he’s sure Harry isn’t looking. No wizard worth their salt has good things to say about Muggle houses of worship. It gives him a little bolt of vindictive pleasure to know that it’s been repurposed for their needs. The Citadel's stalwart bulk, large enough that it's visibile no matter where one is in London, is another reminder of the magical world's triumph. After Muggle Britain fell, The Dark lord razed the former palace of their royal family to the ground and built a larger, grander structure from its ashes in a stunning display of magical power. He recalls Father saying that was the day he knew the Dark Lord would one day have the entire world in his hands.
“No,” Father murmurs, clearly lying. His eyes look strangely beseeching. Draco has never seen such a look on his face before. “No, of course not. Well, I thank you for joining me, my son. I imagine your boor of a husband will be waiting by the fire for you.”
“You ought to train them better,” Daphne says, earnest and tactless as ever. She barrels on before Draco can respond. “Anyways, I was ever so excited to receive an invitation from
He nods in understanding. He wasn’t thinking properly. He’d started the day wrong-footed and allowed it to get to his head. He’ll endeavor not to repeat the mistake.
Harry chuckles to hide the frisson of nerves that dances down his spine. Draco’s hands curl over where Harry’s rest on his thigh.
He crawls over Harry, and god, he looks and smells divine. The sway of his breasts attracts Harry’s gaze as he fussily arranges pillow after pillow beneath him and snuggles into Harry’s side. They never get especially large on male Omegas outside of pregnancy and are hidden easily enough with the proper clothing, but they’re a welcome sight in private. Harry likes that he’s the only one who gets to see them.
before a tight pop sounds and a house elf asks him a question that he just cannot process. Heart racing, Draco slams the book shut on his hand.
He braces himself against the wall and dips his other hand beneath his robes--they really are quite a nuisance, and feel so hot and restrictive it has tears of frustration gathering in the corners of his eyes--to take his sensitive cock in hand. He’s too frustrated to stroke himself with anything approaching finesse, and it barely feels like enough, but the slick slide of the precome drooling from his tip eases the way in a lovely slide. Then the tip of Harry’s tongue is licking firmly over his hole and delving past his rim. A low moan falls from his lips, deeper than any sound that’s ever left him. Harry holds him wide open, fucking his tongue in and in and in, the dirty and slick. He hums into Draco’s skin, sending the vibrations bouncing through his very core. Then he sucks tightly, and the sensation makes Draco cry out. Absently, he hopes that Harry threw up a silencing charm, but he doesn’t care about it enough to try and silence himself. How else will his Alpha know he’s enjoying this?
“It’s no trouble! Hee hee. Besides, I can’t remember, um, haha, all of those verses, and I’m rather afraid of cursing someone’s child by accident, so I thought this would be a good gift for you.” She replies in a nervous rush of words.
Harry stills his restless movements with a guiding hand on his back, stroking his hair. “It wasn’t, though.”
She gives him an odd look, and then the corner of her lips quirk softly upwards. “Erm, a long time ago, yes.”
“Hold tight, love, and you won’t fall. I promise.” Harry says, trying and failing not to laugh at the dubious look Draco shoots his way.
Draco squeezes his eyes shut. He reaches out, hands catching on strong shoulders, then the firmness of Harry’s chest.
The first few minutes are a blur of activity. They’re instructed to leave their shoes lined neatly by the door, and then rushed through several giddy introductions. Draco receives so many kisses on the cheek he’s convinced his skin must be marred with lip rogue by the time they’re done. He discreetly casts a cleaning charm when his head is turned. He recognizes quite a few people. Spouses of Father’s business associates, two fraternal twins of the various blond-haired and brown-eyed Smith brood that look identical anyway, children of Death Eaters, and finally--to his surprise--a former underclassman of theirs, who he last saw at the duels.
They draw tentative plans to prepare a small team to test the method out. Theo fields questions bravely, but is clearly uncomfortable. Cantankerous rests a hand on his shoulder squeezing and shaking gently whenever he falters.
Draco links his fingers together. His tenses shoulders lower the smallest bit when Harry squeezes his upper arm.
“How about a treat and some rest, hm?” Harry asks the owl, reaching out to trail his fingertip gently along its head. It flinches away from him at first, and then contentedly closes its eyes once Harry proves he’s not going to be overly rough.
Harry spends the next few moments of silence containing his temper. He breathes out through his nose. “Thanks for the advice.”
“I don’t want to upset you. It’s just that, when you’re a war orphan, or a muggleborn, you’re not given the same… protections as everyone else. When Omegas started having their first heats, they were given two choices. Either they found someone to help them deal with it, or the staff would do it. And they were never kind.” Harry squeezes his hip, tightly enough to hurt.
Draco nods and leans over, reaching into the deep pockets of his leisure robe to present the elegant black rod. His eyes are longing where they linger over it, Harry notices. The Healer’s magic ban had been firm.
Harry is not at all surprised to find a stack of mail waiting for him in his study when he returns. Colin has worked through what he has clearance to view with rote efficiency, and for that, Harry is grateful. The letters on top are the familiar violent red of howlers, and Harry can’t resist rolling his eyes at the sight of them. Only the ones warded against destruction make their way to his desk, on a technicality that gets them labeled as urgent.
“Be careful and stay warm, sweet boy. I love you.” Harry presses a lingering kiss of farewell on his lips, uncaring of the fact that they’re likely being watched.
Harry’s eyes widen. He sets his whiskey down. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen Narcissa looking anything like angry before.”
He makes note of each guest room, already deciding who to place where during visits. He locates another small library, the kitchens (he’d picked up the habit of popping in for snacks, under Harry’s influence), and a workroom Harry had installed specifically for his use. It’s outfitted with a modest potions supply with several gleaming cauldrons, and cubbies filled with quills, parchment, and the confusing Muggle equivalents ”pens” and “notebooks.”
“We, er, just had one, actually. I feel like I’d be letting him down if it didn't take,” Harry says, staring back over at the fire with a pang in his chest.
“Ma’am, I didn’t know,” the familiar voice of one of the younger maids replies, shaky with fear. “I was startled. Mr. Potter personally closes the floo every night.”
Buckle up, and please forgive me in advance for pulling the wool over your eyes on a Certain Something. I'd love to hear from you on
“I rather think Ron’s very cross with me about a lot of things,” Harry jokes weakly, remembering one of the last explosive conversations he ever had with his best friend.
They laugh softly together. It’s clear in every line of his body that Harry would like to get back into bed, which soothes the hurt just a little bit. He's just dying to say something dramatic in response to Harry's final goodbye, something about being lonely and abandoned, but that's hardly fair. He settles for blowing a kiss and waggling his fingers in a lazy wave. Harry smiles back at him, face open and smitten. That is worth every single hour they will be apart.
When Harry sits beside him, he burrows his face in his Alpha’s neck, licking at the salt tang of his sweat. Then he trails lazy kisses down along his collar, pulling his tunic aside to take one nipple into his mouth. Harry sighs, running a hand through his hair. The hand slides down to the back of his neck, squeezing. He shudders, going almost limp in his hold.
Like he’s read Harry’s thoughts, Draco rolls his eyes, throws a leg over Harry’s hip, and guides Harry’s head to his sternum. He purrs all the same at the wet kiss Harry presses to the curve of his right breast.
Draco arches restlessly in his hold, fucking up and grinding back down, keening noises falling from his lips. There’s a familiar fluttering in his belly, and he’s half convinced he’s ripped their expensive new sheets underneath his hands from how tightly he’s pulling on them. It’s too much, he can feel it coming, can hear the pitch of his own breaths growing higher and higher.
“Then I’ll discuss it with him, at least,” Harry says, at length. And he will, not that he has any plans to accept. He will discuss it mostly in the hopes that an explanation from someone accustomed to this nonsense will make his head stop spinning.
His attention is drawn by someone yelling his name. When he looks over and sees that a reporter is jogging over to them with a large camera in hand, he gives Draco an exaggerated look of exasperation, mostly to make him smile. It has the desired effect, and Harry can hear the reporter saying “Yes, perfect!” as the corner of his gaze is overtaken with an annoyingly bright light.
She’s interrupted by noise so deafening that the walls begin rattling. Pansy lets out a soft cry, and Draco wraps an arm around her waist.
Finally, the magically amplified voice of the master of ceremonies washes over the crowd. Draco takes Harry’s hand again. He’s holding on firmly enough that his dangly bracelets are sure to leave an imprint on Harry’s skin.
Lily doesn’t fancy herself smart, though she does work hard, if only because she doesn’t like letting people down. She’s just weird. When she was small, she’d have these loud, chaotic bursts of accidental magic, shattering windows and scaring neighbors and spelling herself into odd places. It’d felt like all the magic was too much, dancing just underneath the surface of her skin. Some of her earliest memories are being carted to and from friends and family, then mind healers and just regular healers, who’d ask her strange questions and have her feel for her magic. Sometimes she turned people’s skin different colors. Sometimes she’d mumble a word of discomfort and seal someone’s lips shut. Sometimes she’d blow them clear off their feet. They’d leave each meeting just as they started, baffled but kind, tousling her hair and giving her that pained smile adults put on when they don’t want you to think they’re worried.
He’d owled her the address before they even left for London, hoping that she would be coming along as well, now that she no longer has to worry about looking after him.
fills his ears a second later. Being on the other side of that charm is never quite so comforting as being behind it.
“Turn around for me, love,” Harry says, after watching him squirm and complain for an infuriating amount of time.
She flinches. “Merlin. Call me Tonks, please. You make me feel like Matron’s about to spank me in front of the other children for skipping a lesson.”
-The aftereffects of the fight leads to Harry being a bit forceful with Draco when he comes home. I'd call it under negotiated kink, though it's fairly mild
As if on cue, one of his hands slips and the broom wobbles dangerously. Even though they’re maybe two feet above the grass, all of the color leaves his face. It’s at once endearing and hilarious.
He obligingly lifts a foot when Harry works a boot off, and then the other. His socks follow. There’s an intimacy to this. Harry likes doing it. He understands where Draco is coming from.
“Tell me which room Draco Potter is in,” Harry barks to the harried receptionist sat behind the front desk.
Draco weakly smacks at his shoulder, and Harry lets out a proper laugh. He hasn’t let Draco live that down since their conversation all that time ago, back when they were afraid every one might have the potential to be their last.
I’m mostly doing this for my own enjoyment because I’m extremely overwhelmed irl, so generally I’ll pick up what prompts I think I could fill with minimal stress--it is
He’s about to argue that Draco always does that when they’re together, but Draco has chucked Harry’s pants and is in the process of sucking the head of Harry’s cock into his wet mouth, and the words scatter. He hums in encouragement when Harry gently grips his hair and bobs his head. He sinks lower, and lower, and lower, and with a shaky breath through his nose doesn’t stop until the tip of his nose is resting against the curly hair at the base of his shaft.
He spends the next few days in a state of pensive contemplation. Harry picks up on it right away and does his best to accommodate. He brings Draco tea, just the way he likes it, absently massages his shoulders when he has the time, coaxes laughter out of him with amusing anecdotes from work. He's as tender as ever when they make love, generous and encouraging in the way that always makes Draco's face glow with how much he likes it, despite the vague embarrassment it elicits. He's much different from the Alphas Draco had been raised to marry. Maybe it's because he hadn't even realized he was an Alpha, or that he had magic, or anything about his fame until he'd been unceremoniously dumped into the wizarding world. Maybe it's because he's always been stubbornly devoted to breaking every rule that counts. Draco will never know, but he's always grateful that he's not expected to languish away in their home in genteel boredom until the time came for making an heir. Draco doesn't want an heir. He just wants a family.
“Then it’s Azkaban, where the dementors and your cellmates can do what they like with you. When you’re suitably broken, they’ll cart you back out to the Wizengamot, punish you
“It’s not fair you’ve got a bloody junior Potions Master as your partner, Harry,” Ron complains, leaning forward to glance at their cauldron.
“I am not angry with you, and I would never punish you for it if I was. No, please let me finish, love,” he adds, when Draco opens his mouth to protest. He smiles when Draco nods, and the smile widens when Draco reaches for his hands and links their fingers. “I’ll level with you--it would be a lie to say that I wasn’t hurt. It’s nothing that I haven’t heard before, but I guess it threw me off because it was coming from you. Sometimes I worry that my blood status makes you think less of me.”
Sirius' cock throbs. He clasps one hand on his shoulder and then pulls on his magic, and they land in his bed upstairs with Malfoy sputtering and Sirius cackling into the air. Malfoy huffs, and slams his hand down on Sirius chest. Sirius checks any further ire by drawing him close for a slow kiss, enjoying the surprising plush of those lips, and the way he's never quite content to just let Sirius lead, nipping and biting and sighing into the space between them. They part, and Malfoy trails kisses along the underside of his jaw, unabashedly breathing him in. He lets out a purr, and it's such a sound. It's something Sirius remembers pulling out of the cute Omegas at school, snogging in alcoves and empty classrooms, nearly intoxicated from the scent of them. But this is new. Draco Malfoy is nothing like those Omegas. He's proper, to be sure, but he's ill-tempered and blunt and darkly humorous, and not to be impressed by anyone or anything. Sirius reaches for his wand, tucked into his back pocket, and vanishes their clothes, enjoying Malfoy's squawk of surprise. Sirius reaches down to squeeze the arse he's been admiring for some time now, and it's like all the fight leaves Malfoy as he leans in to nibble restlessly at Sirius' collarbone.
Ron’s eyes narrow. The expression is gone in a flash, but not before Draco caught it. He’s not even sure he was meant to miss it, knowing the man’s fits of performative sullenness. Hermione’s cheeks quickly turn bright red. George and Ginny are exchanging glasses.
It takes a bit of coordination with Colin to have their things gathered, but it works out. Harry sticks his head through the green flames of one of St. Mungo’s floos more times than he can count, and somehow finds the time to listen attentively to Draco’s questions about collecting ingredients for his potions. The whole thing leaves him feeling a little exasperated, but in a deeply fond way. The normalcy of it is something he’s been craving for a while. Draco lets out a little noise of surprise when Harry pauses to press a smacking kiss on his cheek, and stares down at his pamphlets with a red face.
The pressure the spell generates is so powerful that Draco can see the air around the dummy ripple, pulled forth into a singular tight spot in a quick, tinny rush of noise. After a beat of silence, a perfectly circular hole blasts itself dead center of the dummy, leaving it wobbling. Draco does not see any debris falling--there simply is a void where there was once material.
“I haven’t forgotten your promise from this morning! Don’t think that a little crying fit would put me off!” Draco huffs. “Unless--well, if you’re tired—”
“You bet I am. Ready to be done with these Russian bastards. Ready to go home to my mate. Thinking about yours?” Crabbe asks. He grins lopsidedly when Harry nods. “Fine Omega, that Draco. And so bossy! Always ordering Vincent around when they were small, like some little drill sergeant. All ruddy-cheeked in his pretty little robes.”
"All I can think about is that chicken in the sweet sauce. And the fried rice. I want so much of the rice." Draco confesses.
“Well? Will you consider it?” Thicknesse presses. There is truly a surprising amount of strength in his spindly fingers.
Black reaches out for him, but the thin shield stretched over his cell flares in a flash of blinding white. His fingertips are smoking as he pulls them back, and Harry notes with a pang in his chest that the skin there looks tough and leathery already. Indeed, Black barely reacts beyond a slight flutter of his eyelids.
Draco’s shoulders rise. He gives Harry a panicked look, who smiles and says, “We’ll think about it.”
Harry has had many enterprising parents throw their newly-of-age children his way, but Draco Malfoy is an interesting one.
Draco purses his lips. “Uncomfortable ones. So, when it was all over, I couldn’t stop thinking about how much I wanted to cut it. Mother was so upset with me that she burst into tears when she first saw it, but Father just said, ‘All the good Alphas prefer someone more modern these days.’ So I was allowed to keep it that way.”
He pulls Draco onto his back as if he weighs nothing, maneuvering him with caring but firm hands. Draco greedily eyes where he can see Harry’s knot forming at the base of his glistening shaft, and sighs in relief the moment Harry slides back inside. He locks his legs around Harry’s waist. The moment Harry finds a good angle then takes pity on him and strokes his oversensitive cock with quick, gentle pumps, Draco moans his name and comes, fingers curling into Harry’s lightly furred chest. Harry kisses his face and follows him not soon after, coming so hard that Draco feels him pulsing, feels some of it trailing out around him before Harry locks his knot inside.
Harry leans down and kisses over his bondmark as he slides a hand beneath Draco’s top leg, lifting it in the air. Draco releases him, not even bothering to help at all, indolent and pliant in his arms.
The garden is more James and Father’s haunt, but Al finds himself spending more time there talking to the snakes. Apparently James got them all up in a tizzy sharing some of the family gossip, so now they all gather like muggles sitting a sermon the moment one of them comes out.
He takes Harry into his mouth, pink lips stretched wide over his girth. The shock of the silky wet heat was unexpected, and Harry only just stops himself from fucking into Draco’s mouth. Letting out a strained curse, he cups the back of Draco’s head as it bobs low. He takes Harry as far in as he can, lips touching his fist, and swallows, throat rippling around Harry’s cock.
A small group of Aurors awaits them, and visibly pale at the sight of the Dark Lord and his inner circle bearing down on them. Harry wonders what would be more frightening: them, or the small army of lower-ranked Death Eaters and soldiers that must certainly be flooding out of the complicated floo network inside the Citadel.
“I’ll thank you not to call me useless! Or yourself. Look at how you saved us,” Sonja says. He hums a discontented noise into his glass. Smiling, she runs her thumb over the back of his hand. “I don’t think I’ve ever been so terrified in my life. But you rose to the occasion and kept us all safe, including your little one!”
,” Father says, severely, bursting through the back door, “if you trample my fluxweed, I’ll have you scrubbing cauldrons until you get back on the train. By hand.”
Every answer Harry is reaching for sounds desperately petty or is for the sake of someone else. The only one that seems even slightly justifiable is that he wants to keep Draco safe and happy. Thinking of his Omega makes Harry’s throat ache. He breaks eye contact, not wanting to share the naked longing that is undoubtedly easy to see.
“Lily had a sister. Absolute piece of work.Had a little boy about a year before you were born with some plump man. Durston? Durley?” Black says, tapping his chin. Then his expression shutters off again. “In any case, Harry, congratulations, really. But I would rather rot in here than ever be brought out into a world like that.”
Harry is surprised to recognize Severus Snape amongst the small crowd. As the headmaster of Hogwarts, he has rarely pulled away from his work. It is always memorable when he is around. Snape’s dislike for Harry is intense. Much of their conversation is characterized by cutting words from Snape and cheerful disrespect from Harry, right up until Snape inevitably hits a nerve and makes him truly angry. The rest love it when they can see a crack in Harry’s mask.
Before they leave, Draco thanks his parents for raising him with care, for their support in the days leading up to his marriage, and for their guidance after. Harry thanks them for welcoming him into the family, and for the honor of one day providing an heir for the Malfoy line. Narcissa surprises him with a quick but powerful hug and then bundles Draco up into a tight, rocking embrace. Lucius squeezes their shoulders and even shakes Harry’s hand before they step through the floo.
Anezka begs for a break, so they tumble into a narrow alleyway between two squat brick buildings. With a gasp, she plops onto the ground, sucking in tinny, wheezing breaths.
Magical builders had been employed to rebuild the homes of nobles that survived the bombings. In a show of benevolence that Harry didn’t buy for a second, Voldemort footed the bill as an “apology for failing his people.” Such acts have always gone a long way towards maintaining the faith of the wizarding public (one of Harry’s earliest memories is of the celebration his orphanage held after receiving a generous donation from the Dark Lord--it’d been the first time he ate candy), but it brings Harry a stab of vindictive pleasure to imagine temper tantrums that probably followed this one.
“We would all benefit from more ‘someones like you,’ my dear. And if you’re really so worried, teach the child some hexes, and damn the consequences! Though, maybe not so many that involve blood.”
Sonja reaches over and squeezes his free hand. “Aveline was lost in service to our Lord, and there is no nobler death. Your Harry is strong! He wouldn’t be in the inner circle if he weren't. You probably won’t have to worry about losing him, darling. We magical folk live for a long time.”
Draco nods. “And then she began to use her wand. I don’t even know what spell she was going to use--she didn’t say anything--and I just panicked. I’m pregnant. I--I’ve really wanted a child, and I didn’t want her to hurt my baby.”
"Holy--what the fuck--what the fuck did you just do?" Al says, around a laugh, letting his head fall back. He's going to die. He
Draco bites his lip. After a moment’s hesitation, he says, “I’ve been here because Hermione can’t find me. It’s so tucked away, you know? She’s taken to our book collection like a fish to water, and she’s always… asking all of these questions if she sees me in there. She likes to debate. It’s a little overwhelming.”
Sometimes, before Voldemort calls them back to sit on his advisory board, the whole of them congregate in tight groups to “prepare.” What it really means is that they gossip. Harry has become an expert at producing polite noises of attentiveness, and is even better at threatening anyone with ill intentions into silence. High society folk generally speak three languages: subterfuge, sex, and violence.
“And what do you have to say about your other poor decisions? Laughing in corners at your peers, leaving,” and here Father pauses to let out an aggrieved noise, “leaving back rooms
Harry kisses his cheek. The four of them spend a few quiet moments cooing over red-faced, infant perfection. Baby Rose, who is sleeping peacefully and according to her parents spends most of her time that way, is passed around from person to person, her soothing baby scent mingling with that of their little mismatched family. For the longest time, it'd been just Draco and his parents, which suited him just fine. Family is extremely important to Purebloods. But he'll always be grateful for Harry gently but insistently bringing him into the lives of so many kind hearted people.
When there are lulls in planning, many settle about and do what they do best: talk. Harry makes his excuses to escape to the floo when he can, but he doesn’t always succeed. They’re all restless with anticipation over what they hope to be the final push into Russia, and the wait for the destruction of the forest has made Harry’s coworkers especially chatty.
Anezka laughs. For all that she looks much younger than she is, she is very pretty, with her wavy red hair and light blue eyes. “That’s him, yes. He still does it at parties, I’m afraid to say.”
“That means you have to let me come,” Draco huffs, sounding so wretchedly upset about the whole thing that Harry can’t help a laugh.
Her eyes stray briefly to his bond mark, and only someone who knows her as well as he does would be able to pick up on the brief tightness of her lips. Then she sighs and gives him a small smile, briefly cupping his face in her hands.
“That’s rough. Think Draco would twist my nipple if I tried to give him a curfew,” Harry admits, amused.
“Harry, I’m sorry, but you are ‘you lot,’ actually,” Theo says. Before Harry can fully process this statement, he barrels on. “And I’m serious. I found some troubling magic while you were away.”
“I will not be lectured by my own child,” Father interrupts him. “Potter will have his heir, I will have my proper Pureblood heir, and so too will Mr. Thicknesse.”
Harry approaches the bed, and brushes Draco’s hair behind his ear. It’s been growing recently and is in a charming awkward phase. Too short to be tied up and too long to go without careful styling, Draco has solved most of the issue by claiming he’d like to grow it out and refusing to leave their quarters altogether. Harry would be more worried about getting him outside if he hadn’t noticed the way Draco flinches at loud sounds and startles quite easily these days. Not for the first time, Harry hates that he wasn’t home to keep his mate safe.
The Omegas are clearly intimidated by the probing, rapid-fire nature of the Wizengamot’s questions. Most people wouldn’t dream of speaking to a high-society Omega with such severity, at least not in public, but the Wizengamot is fiercely dedicated to charging the people the Aurors have captured and have thus defaulted to their usual mode of investigation. Umbridge in particular seems to be delighting in the process. By the time Draco is called down, Harry is able to detect the subtle signs of his fear as they are led down into the chamber.
“It was. I am grateful every day that you were not raised in it,” Father replies, one gloved hand gently patting Draco's where it rests on his arm.
Is Mother okay? Have Harry and Father returned? If they did, were they caught up in it? And what of the rest of his friends, scattered across the city in their own London homes at the Dark Lord’s request? Resentment and shock are battling for seniority in Draco’s mind.
--sure enough, the sound comes rushing back into his ears. The only thing he can hear is himself, wheezing and whimpering, the sound bouncing against the walls.
Harry just kisses him on the crown of his head before rising back to his feet. They can talk about it later. Draco looks up at him, so obviously miserable that it almost hurts to see. Harry cups the back of his neck to soothe him.
After a few moments of cuddling, Draco pulls back and uncorks the vial. He allows himself only a beat of hesitation before tipping it back, swallowing half like it’s a shot glass. Then he presses it into Harry’s hands, watching curiously as Harry shrugs and follows suit. He’s pleasantly surprised to find that it tastes more like mint than anything else--a far cry from the potions Madam Pomfrey has shoved down his throat over the years, and not at all as strong as he would expect from something like this.
The spell does not do quite the damage it usually would on account of its rapidly moving target, and slashes through several fighters on its way. The tail end of it hits true and sends a spray of blood against the walls in an arc, just as Viktorovich is about to turn a corner. He lets out a pained cry. Harry knows enough Russian to recognize the foul words leaving his mouth. Bellatrix smirks at Harry.
Harry sits him down, leaving his legs dangling off the side. After telling Draco to lean back on his hands, Harry kneels on the platform below the bed and lifts one of Draco’s slippered feet into his hands. Draco watches with bated breath as he works it off, and repeats with the other foot. His big hands squeeze Draco’s ankles, and then slide slowly up the length of his stocking-covered legs, pausing behind his knees, which makes him jolt and swallow a giggle at the sensation.
As Harry was hoping, this pointed question chips away at some of Draco’s insistence. He flushes, and leans back.
“I’m afraid I wouldn’t be the best company,” comes Theo’s amused voice. “I tend to ask a lot of questions.”
“No he doesn’t,” James protests, and it sounds weak even to his own ears, “he just doesn’t know us.”
“You have me,” and he couples his words with a harsh rubbing of his fingers over Draco’s prostate and he’s coming, panting so loudly he can hear himself. His cock twitches almost painfully, offering up another spurt of come.
“We’re just people. Muggleborns, too. Have I ever done anything to make you feel unsafe? Have me or the servants ever tried to suck the magic right out of you?” He teases softly, tugging on Draco’s hair.
“We’re glad to finally speak with you, Draco,” Auror Davies says, a charming smile on his face. “May I call you Draco? Just so we don’t get you and your husband confused.”
“It’s quite alright. I can read it to you sometime. Though I warn you, it’s dreadfully macabre. It’ll make a wonderful bedtime story for our children, I bet.” Draco snorts, pulling himself up with a yawn.
“You don’t understand! You had to do all that just to--to have a chance, and they reward you with more fighting. You win a deadly popularity contest and maybe the Dark Lord will take notice of you and send you off wherever he feels fit? It’s ghastly!” Draco says, splaying his hands wide.
The Dark Lord’s conferences have intersected with the Wheel of the Year before, but there’s a certain wonder to participating in his first Yuletide celebrations as a bonded Omega. Honoring his parents was soothing and familiar, but there is something to be said about sweeping into ballroom after parlor after pop-up canopy on Harry’s arm. As a child, he’d lived for the organized chaos of Yuletide. He loved surveying the range of decorations from household to household and pausing by warm fireplaces to honor Yule logs. Yuletide in London is something new entirely.
Harry sighs. “I just have a bad feeling. So, I was going to say, please only work on this when you can reach me. I want to be here so I can intervene in case anything goes sideways.”
“Your grandmother kept quite the record of you all for me to look over. Sometimes she wrote about you. As I shall have no use for it soon, I thought you might want to see it.” He explains.
“One of my spies call you ‘shockingly decent,’ Harry Potter, I say you are a murderer and a coward also.”
The Muggle opens his mouth, and then the runes on his neck pulse yet again, and the only thing that comes out is a pained groan. Mother’s nostrils flare. “And you’re outside of where you’re supposed to be, as well. I should hope that you were trying to make your way back instead of doing something foolish. Stand.”
“Well, yes,” Draco says, blushing, at the same time Theo points out that this wouldn’t be such a surprise. Draco shoots Theo an owlish look of surprise, then smiles yet again. “It’s good to see you, Theo.”
Draco’s breath catches. Harry laughs and leans down to kiss along his neck, vibrations humming right through him.
It scares Harry. So the next day, he presents Draco with a broom, a mop, a duster, a thick brush, and some wood polish.
"If it doesn't work this first time, please don't be frustrated with him. The omega body can be a fickle thing!" She continues, and the way she's wagging her fingers has Draco deeply amused. She's an old Beta witch who has been serving other Purebloods in her private practice for decades. She is used to arguing with Alphas impatient for heirs.
Another gust of wind blows at his back. He shudders in response, and a warmer one hits him, slow and apologetic. Letting out a giddy, tittering laugh, Draco reaches into his pockets with his bloodied hand and clutches his signet ring.
